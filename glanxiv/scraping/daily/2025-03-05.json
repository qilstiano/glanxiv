As a result, nonlinear models are now essential for\nthe design and control of these systems. However, identifying a nonlinear\nsystem is more complicated than identifying a linear one. Therefore, modeling\nand identifying nonlinear systems are crucial for the design, manufacturing,\nand testing of complex systems. This study presents using advanced nonlinear\nmethods based on deep learning for system identification. Two deep neural\nnetwork models, LSTM autoencoder and Normalizing Flows, are explored for their\npotential to extract temporal features from time series data and relate them to\nsystem parameters, respectively. The presented framework offers a nonlinear\napproach to system identification, enabling it to handle complex systems.

    "abstract": "Monitoring polarization dynamics in multimode fibers is critical for a range\nof applications, spanning from optical communication to sensing. Although the\nmodal behavior of multimode fibers is well understood through interferometry\nand advanced detection techniques, most studies focus on a single polarization\nstate of specific modes, leaving the spatial mode dynamics of the other\npolarization state unexplored. A variety of optical phenomena can arise during\nthe transport of spatial modes in fibers, driven by stress-induced fiber\ndeformations. These phenomena include changes in the effective refractive index\nof modes, modal dispersion, and polarization-dependent mode coupling. Observing\nsuch modal behavior typically requires complex systems, such as multi-axis\ninterferometry. In this paper, we present quasi-real-time observation of\nspatial mode dynamics in a two-mode fiber using 2D single-photon avalanche\ndiode (SPAD) arrays configured in a dual-axis setup under different fiber\ndeformation conditions. By utilizing the time-resolved capabilities of the SPAD\narrays, we capture the modal behavior of two spatial modes in the fiber during\nstress induced by uncontrolled deformations, enabling direct observation of\nspatial correlations of the modes. Additionally, we demonstrate\ndual-polarization mode dynamics under controlled fiber conformation, where the\nmodal behavior remains stable within acceptable error limits. Our work opens\nnew avenues for exploring polarization-dependent phenomena in both fundamental\nand applied optics, as well as in biological systems.",

Despite a history of targeting by\nadversaries, relatively little academic work has been done to increase\nvisibility into how voter registration systems keep voters' data secure,\naccurate, and up to date. Enhancing transparency and verifiability could help\nelection officials and the public detect and mitigate risks to this essential\ncomponent of electoral processes worldwide.\n  This work introduces cryptographic verifiability for voter registration\nsystems. Based on consultation with diverse expert stakeholders that support\nelections systems, we precisely define the requirements for cryptographic\nverifiability in voter registration and systematize the practical challenges\nthat must be overcome for near-term deployment.\n  We then introduce VRLog, the first system to bring strong verifiability to\nvoter registration. VRLog enables election officials to provide a transparent\nlog that (1) allows voters to verify that their registration data has not been\ntampered with and (2) allows the public to monitor update patterns and database\nconsistency. We also introduce VRLog$^x$, an enhancement to VRLog that offers\ncryptographic privacy to voter deduplication between jurisdictions - a common\nmaintenance task currently performed in plaintext or using trusted third\nparties. Our designs rely on standard, efficient cryptographic primitives, and\nare backward compatible with existing voter registration systems. Finally, we\nprovide an open-source implementation of VRLog and benchmarks to demonstrate\nthat the system is practical - capable of running on low-cost commodity\nhardware and scaling to support databases the size of the largest U.S. state\nvoter registration systems.",

    "abstract": "Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is widely recognized for enhancing the\nenergy and spectral efficiency through effective radio resource sharing.\nHowever, uplink NOMA systems face greater challenges than their downlink\ncounterparts, as their bit error rate (BER) performance is hindered by an\ninherent error floor due to error propagation caused by imperfect successive\ninterference cancellation (SIC). This paper investigates BER performance\nimprovements enabled by reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) in\nmulti-user uplink NOMA transmission. Specifically, we propose a novel\nRIS-assisted uplink NOMA design, where the RIS phase shifts are optimized to\nenhance the received signal amplitudes while mitigating the phase rotations\ninduced by the channel. To achieve this, we first develop an accurate channel\nmodel for the effective user channels, which facilitates our BER analysis. We\nthen introduce a channel alignment scheme for a two-user scenario, enabling\nefficient SIC-based detection and deriving closed-form BER expressions. We\nfurther extend the analysis to a generalized setup with an arbitrary number of\nusers and modulation orders for quadrature amplitude modulation signaling.\nUsing the derived BER expressions, we develop an optimized uplink NOMA power\nallocation (PA) scheme that minimizes the average BER while satisfying the user\ntransmit power constraints. It will be shown that the proposed NOMA detection\nscheme, in conjunction with the optimized PA strategy, eliminate SIC error\nfloors at the base station. The theoretical BER expressions are validated using\nsimulations, which confirms the effectiveness of the proposed design in\neliminating BER floors.",

The extended acquisition time\nwill further increase the susceptibility to motion artifacts. Existing deep\nlearning-based reconstruction methods have been proven to perform well in image\nreconstruction tasks, but most of them are designed for specific acquisition\nmodality or dedicated imaging parameter, which limits their ability to\ngeneralize across a variety of scan scenarios. To address this issue, the\nCMRxRecon2024 challenge consists of two specific tasks: Task 1 focuses on a\nmodality-universal setting, evaluating the out-of-distribution generalization\nof existing learning-based models, while Task 2 follows a k-space\nsampling-universal setting, assessing the all-in-one adaptability of universal\nmodels. Main contributions of this challenge include providing the largest\npublicly available multi-modality, multi-view cardiac k-space dataset; and\ndeveloping an open benchmarking platform for algorithm evaluation and shared\ncode library for data processing. In addition, through a detailed analysis of\nthe results submitted to the challenge, we have also made several findings,\nincluding: 1) adaptive prompt-learning embedding is an effective means for\nachieving strong generalization in reconstruction models; 2) enhanced data\nconsistency based on physics-informed networks is also an effective pathway\ntoward a universal model; 3) traditional evaluation metrics have limitations\nwhen assessing ground-truth references with moderate or lower image quality,\nhighlighting the need for subjective evaluation methods.

However, chiral materials, such as\norganic chiral molecules and solid-state magnetic materials, exhibit fine\nspectral features which necessitate broadband radiation for their complete\ninterrogation. The generation of radiation that is both broadband and helical\nthrough HHG presents a seemingly paradoxical challenge: while chiral HHG\nemission requires at least two recollisions occurring along different\ndirections in the polarization plane, the Floquet limit might already be\nreached with as few as three recollisions, resulting in a sparse spectrum\ncharacterized by pronounced discrete harmonic peaks. Here we propose a\nstraightforward scheme that enables the interrogation of fine spectral\nfeatures, in principle restricted only by the resolution of the XUV\nspectrometer, with chiral XUV light. Our method is based on using a vectorial\ntwo-color driver with close central-frequencies with slight symmetry breaking.\nIt integrates the time-gating and polarization-gating techniques to generate a\nvectorial driver which induces well-controlled bursts of recollisions,\noccurring along different directions in the polarization plane. The method\nsatisfies the dual requirements of an XUV source which is both broadband and\nhelical. We perform polarization scan and demonstrate that the broadband XUV\nradiation exhibits rapid modulations in its spectral ellipticity, and fast\nalternation in its spectral helicities. The phase of modulations could be\ncontrolled by introducing a slight symmetry breaking. This allows us to control\nand modulate the XUV polarization state, which should enable the detection of\nchiroptical signals with enhanced sensitivity.",

In\nthis work, we demonstrate that while existing nuclear basis sets are sufficient\nfor NEO density-functional calculations, many sets producing proton affinities\nconverged within 0.1 kcal/mol of the complete basis set limit, NEO calculations\nshould always use uncontracted electronic basis sets on the quantum protons,\nsince the contraction coefficients in typical electronic basis sets have been\nderived for point nuclear charge distributions. Uncontracting the basis sets on\nthe quantized protons leads to significantly faster convergence to the basis\nset limit, leading to improvements of 18 kcal/mol and 10 kcal/mol in proton\naffinities employing double-$\\zeta$ aug-pc-1 and triple-$\\zeta$ aug-pc-2\nelectronic basis sets, respectively, with little effect on the computational\neffort.

Similar results are also obtained with Dunning's\ncorrelation-consistent cc-pVXZ basis sets, as well as the Karlsruhe def2-XZP\nbasis sets, albeit at a somewhat slower rate of convergence.

    "abstract": "Diffusion models are the standard toolkit for generative modelling of 3D\natomic systems. However, for different types of atomic systems -- such as\nmolecules and materials -- the generative processes are usually highly specific\nto the target system despite the underlying physics being the same. We\nintroduce the All-atom Diffusion Transformer (ADiT), a unified latent diffusion\nframework for jointly generating both periodic materials and non-periodic\nmolecular systems using the same model: (1) An autoencoder maps a unified,\nall-atom representations of molecules and materials to a shared latent\nembedding space; and (2) A diffusion model is trained to generate new latent\nembeddings that the autoencoder can decode to sample new molecules or\nmaterials. Experiments on MP20, QM9 and GEOM-DRUGS datasets demonstrate that\njointly trained ADiT generates realistic and valid molecules as well as\nmaterials, obtaining state-of-the-art results on par with molecule and\ncrystal-specific models. ADiT uses standard Transformers with minimal inductive\nbiases for both the autoencoder and diffusion model, resulting in significant\nspeedups during training and inference compared to equivariant diffusion\nmodels. Scaling ADiT up to half a billion parameters predictably improves\nperformance, representing a step towards broadly generalizable foundation\nmodels for generative chemistry.

    "abstract": "Recent theoretical results show transformers cannot express sequential\nreasoning problems over long inputs, intuitively because their computational\ndepth is bounded. However, prior work treats the depth as a constant, leaving\nit unclear to what degree bounded depth may suffice for solving problems over\nshort inputs, or how increasing the transformer's depth affects its expressive\npower. We address these questions by analyzing transformers whose depth can\ngrow minimally with context length $n$. We show even highly uniform\ntransformers with depth $\\Theta(\\log n)$ can express two important problems:\nrecognizing regular languages, which captures state tracking abilities and was\nknown to be expressible only by an unconventional, non-uniform model of\ntransformers, and graph connectivity, which underlies multi-step reasoning.\nNotably, both of these problems cannot be expressed by fixed-depth transformers\nunder standard complexity conjectures, demonstrating the expressivity benefit\nof growing depth. Moreover, our theory quantitatively predicts how depth must\ngrow with input length to express these problems, showing that depth scaling is\nmore efficient than scaling width or chain-of-thought steps. Empirically, our\ndetailed experiments designed to bridge the expressivity vs. learnability gap\nreveal that our theoretical depth requirements for regular language recognition\nclosely match the practical depth requirements for successfully training\ntransformers. Thus, our results clarify how depth affects a transformer's\nreasoning capabilities, and provide practical guidance for effective depth\nselection for sequential reasoning.",

Understanding the\nspatiotemporal dynamics of the four closely related dengue serotypes, and their\nimmunological interactions, remains a challenge at a global scale. To\nfacilitate this understanding, we worked with dengue epidemiologists in a\nuser-centered design framework to create GeoDEN, an exploratory visualisation\ntool that empowers experts to investigate spatiotemporal patterns in dengue\nserotype reports. The tool has several linked visualisations and filtering\nmechanisms, enabling analysis at a range of spatial and temporal scales. To\nidentify successes and failures, we present both insight-based and value-driven\nevaluations. Our domain experts found GeoDEN valuable, verifying existing\nhypotheses and uncovering novel insights that warrant further investigation by\nthe epidemiology community. The developed visual exploration approach can be\nadapted for exploring other epidemiology and disease incident datasets.",

    "abstract": "Although very large wars remain an enduring threat in global politics, we\nlack a clear understanding of how some wars become large and costly, while most\ndo not. There are three possibilities: large conflicts start with and maintain\nintense fighting, they persist over a long duration, or they escalate in\nintensity over time. Using detailed within-conflict data on civil and\ninterstate wars 1946--2008, we show that escalation dynamics -- variations in\nfighting intensity within an armed conflict -- play a fundamental role in\nproducing large conflicts and are a generic feature of both civil and\ninterstate wars. However, civil wars tend to deescalate when they become very\nlarge, limiting their overall severity, while interstate wars exhibit a\npersistent risk of continual escalation. A non-parametric model demonstrates\nthat this distinction in escalation dynamics can explain the differences in the\nhistorical sizes of civil vs. interstate wars, and explain Richardson's Law\ngoverning the frequency and severity of interstate conflicts over the past 200\nyears. Escalation dynamics also drive enormous uncertainty in forecasting the\neventual sizes of both hypothetical and ongoing civil wars, indicating a need\nto better understand the causes of escalation and deescalation within\nconflicts. The close relationship between the size, and hence the cost, of an\narmed conflict and its potential for escalation has broad implications for\ntheories of conflict onset or termination and for risk assessment in\ninternational relations.",

Simulations are performed for both single and\ntwo-phase flows for a wide range of the Reynolds (Re) and the Weissenberg (Wi)\nnumbers. It is demonstrated that injection of bubbles into a laminar\nviscoelastic flow introduces streamline curvature that is sufficient to trigger\nan elastic instability leading to a transition to a fully EIT regime. The\ntemporal turbulent kinetic energy spectrum shows a scaling of -2 for this\nmultiphase EIT regime. It is shown that, once the flow is fully transitioned to\na turbulent state by the injection of bubbles, the drag increases for all the\ncases. It is also observed that bubbles move towards the channel centreline and\nform a string-shaped alignment pattern in the core region at the lower values\nof Re=10 and Wi=1. In this regime, the flow exhibits an intermittent behaviour,\ni.e., there are turbulent like fluctuations in the core region while it is\nessentially laminar near the wall.

Fine-tuning was applied to the image encoder and mask decoder.\nWe limited training subsets from 50 to 400 samples per class to better model\nreal-world constraints with data acquisition. The impact of dataset size on\nfine-tuning performance was evaluated with weighted mean Dice coefficient\n(WMDC), and the results were also compared against previously reported\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) results. Results: SurgiSAM 2, a fine-tuned SAM 2 model,\ndemonstrated significant improvements in segmentation performance, achieving a\n17.9% relative WMDC gain compared to the baseline SAM 2.

We then prove that the boundary of\nthe Springer Schubert cell corresponding to a matching consists of the affine\nsubsets of cells corresponding to all ways of cutting arcs in that matching.",

    "abstract": "Detection of undersea threats is a complex problem of considerable importance\nfor maritime regional surveillance and security. Multistatic sonar systems can\nprovide a means to monitor for underwater threats, where fixed sensors, towed\narrays and dipping sonars may be utilised for this purpose. However, it is\nadvantageous to deploy passive sensors to provide a stealthy early warning\nsystem. Hence this paper is concerned with determining where a series of\npassive sonar sensors should be situated in order to provide an initial threat\ndetection capability. In order to facilitate this it is necessary to derive a\nsuitable expression for the probability of threat detection from a passive\nsensor. This is based upon considerations of the passive sonar equation. It\nwill be demonstrated how the stochastic aspects of this equation may be\nmodelled through appropriate random variables capturing the uncertainty in\nnoise levels. Subsequently this is utilised to produce the system-level\nprobability of threat detection. Since the threat location is also unknown an\nappropriate statistical model is introduced to account for this uncertainty.\nThis then permits the specification of the probability of detection as a\nfunction of sensor locations. Consequently it is then possible to determine\noptimal sensor placement to maximise the threat detection probability. This\nprovides a new way in which to determine whether a surveillance region is\ncovered adequately by sensors. The methodology will be illustrated through a\nseries of examples utilising passive sonar characteristics sourced from the\nopen literature.",

In this work, we present protocols for\nimplementing long-range two-qubit gates mediated by either Fock-state or\ntime-bin qubits -- photonic encodings that are both compatible with the\ncoplanar waveguide resonators commonly used in circuit quantum electrodynamics\n(QED). These protocols become deterministic in the limit of vanishing photon\nloss. Additionally, photon loss can be heralded, signaling a failed two-qubit\ngate attempt. We model the loss of a time-bin qubit to a dielectric environment\nconsisting of an ensemble of two-level systems (TLSs), which are believed to be\nthe dominant mechanism for dielectric loss in circuit QED architectures. The\nbackaction (on the stationary qubits) associated with the loss of the time-bin\nqubit is strongly suppressed in a non-Markovian regime where the temporal\nseparation of the time bins is short compared to the dielectric environment's\ncorrelation time. This result suggests strategies based on a combination of\nmaterials-fabrication and time-bin-qubit optimization for ensuring that the\nloss of a time-bin qubit is not only heralded, but also approximately\nbackaction-free.",

We show that quantum Margulis codes, unlike\nbivariate bicycle codes which require ordered statistics decoding for effective\nerror correction, can be efficiently decoded using a standard min-sum decoder\nwith linear complexity, when decoded under depolarizing noise. This is\nattributed to their Tanner graph structure, which does not exhibit group\nsymmetry, thereby mitigating the well-known problem of error degeneracy in\nQLDPC decoding. To further enhance performance, we propose an algorithm for\nconstructing 2BGA codes with controlled girth, ensuring a minimum girth of 6 or\n8, and use it to generate several quantum Margulis codes of length 240 and 642.\nWe validate our approach through numerical simulations, demonstrating that\nquantum Margulis codes behave significantly better than BB codes in the error\nfloor region, under min-sum decoding.",

A\nkey metric for understanding blood glucose dynamics after eating is the\npostprandial area under the curve (AUC). Predicting postprandial AUC in advance\nbased on a person's lifestyle factors, such as diet and physical activity\nlevel, and explaining the factors that affect postprandial blood glucose could\nallow an individual to adjust their lifestyle accordingly to maintain normal\nglucose levels. In this study, we developed an explainable machine learning\nsolution, GlucoLens, that takes sensor-driven inputs and uses advanced data\nprocessing, large language models, and trainable machine learning models to\npredict postprandial AUC and hyperglycemia from diet, physical activity, and\nrecent glucose patterns.

Our machine learning model takes multimodal data from\nwearable activity and glucose monitoring sensors, along with food and work\nlogs, and provides an interpretable prediction of the postprandial glucose\npattern. Our GlucoLens system achieves a normalized root mean squared error\n(NRMSE) of 0.123 in its best configuration.

In response to being\nexposed to the models' functionality, we observed long term behavior changes in\n8 participants.

While recent efforts have applied\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques like low-rank adaptation (LoRA) in\nfederated settings, they typically use single or multiple independent low-rank\nadapters with predefined maximal and minimal ranks, which may not be optimal\nfor diverse data sources over clients.\n  To address this issue, we propose PF2LoRA, a new personalized federated\nfine-tuning algorithm built on a novel \\emph{automatic rank learning approach\nvia two-level LoRA}. Given the pretrained language model whose weight is\nfrozen, our algorithm aims to learn two levels of adaptation simultaneously:\nthe first level aims to learn a common adapter for all clients, while the\nsecond level fosters individual client personalization. A key advantage of\nPF2LoRA is its ability to adaptively determine a suitable rank based on an\nindividual client's data, rather than relying on a predefined rank that is\nagnostic to data heterogeneity. We present a synthetic example that highlights\nhow PF2LoRA automatically learns the ground-truth rank for each client,\ntailoring the adaptation to match the properties of their individual data.\nNotably, this approach introduces minimal additional memory overhead, as the\nsecond-level adaptation comprises a small number of parameters compared to the\nfirst level.

Within a joint\nmodeling framework, this approach connects a latent variable, derived from\nHRQoL data, to cause-specific hazards of dropout. Unlike traditional joint\nmodels, which treat longitudinal data as a covariate in the survival submodel,\nour approach prioritizes the longitudinal data and incorporates the log\nbaseline dropout risks as covariates in the latent process. This leads to a\nmore accurate analysis of longitudinal data, accounting for potential effects\nof dropout risks. Through extensive simulation studies, we demonstrate that\nextJMIRT provides robust and unbiased parameter estimates and highlight the\nimportance of accounting for informative dropout.

    "abstract": "The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in robotic systems presents\nunique safety challenges, particularly in unpredictable environments. Although\nLLMs, leveraging zero-shot learning, enhance human-robot interaction and\ndecision-making capabilities, their inherent probabilistic nature and lack of\nformal guarantees raise significant concerns for safety-critical applications.\nTraditional model-based verification approaches often rely on precise system\nmodels, which are difficult to obtain for real-world robotic systems and may\nnot be fully trusted due to modeling inaccuracies, unmodeled dynamics, or\nenvironmental uncertainties. To address these challenges, this paper introduces\na safety assurance framework for LLM-controlled robots based on data-driven\nreachability analysis, a formal verification technique that ensures all\npossible system trajectories remain within safe operational limits. Our\nframework specifically investigates the problem of instructing an LLM to\nnavigate the robot to a specified goal and assesses its ability to generate\nlow-level control actions that successfully guide the robot safely toward that\ngoal. By leveraging historical data to construct reachable sets of states for\nthe robot-LLM system, our approach provides rigorous safety guarantees against\nunsafe behaviors without relying on explicit analytical models. We validate the\nframework through experimental case studies in autonomous navigation and task\nplanning, demonstrating its effectiveness in mitigating risks associated with\nLLM-generated commands. This work advances the integration of formal methods\ninto LLM-based robotics, offering a principled and practical approach to\nensuring safety in next-generation autonomous systems.",

    "abstract": "Classical asset price forecasting methods primarily rely on numerical data,\nsuch as price time series, trading volumes, limit order book data, and\ntechnical analysis indicators. However, the news flow plays a significant role\nin price formation, making the development of multimodal approaches that\ncombine textual and numerical data for improved prediction accuracy highly\nrelevant. This paper addresses the problem of forecasting financial asset\nprices using the multimodal approach that combines candlestick time series and\ntextual news flow data. A unique dataset was collected for the study, which\nincludes time series for 176 Russian stocks traded on the Moscow Exchange and\n79,555 financial news articles in Russian. For processing textual data,\npre-trained models RuBERT and Vikhr-Qwen2.5-0.5b-Instruct (a large language\nmodel) were used, while time series and vectorized text data were processed\nusing an LSTM recurrent neural network. The experiments compared models based\non a single modality (time series only) and two modalities, as well as various\nmethods for aggregating text vector representations. Prediction quality was\nestimated using two key metrics: Accuracy (direction of price movement\nprediction: up or down) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), which\nmeasures the deviation of the predicted price from the true price. The\nexperiments showed that incorporating textual modality reduced the MAPE value\nby 55%. The resulting multimodal dataset holds value for the further adaptation\nof language models in the financial sector. Future research directions include\noptimizing textual modality parameters, such as the time window, sentiment, and\nchronological order of news messages.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a new framework for computing low-rank solutions to\nnonlinear matrix equations arising from spatial discretization of nonlinear\npartial differential equations: low-rank Anderson acceleration (lrAA). lrAA is\nan adaptation of Anderson acceleration (AA), a well-known approach for solving\nnonlinear fixed point problems, to the low-rank format. In particular, lrAA\ncarries out all linear and nonlinear operations in low-rank form with rank\ntruncation using an adaptive truncation tolerance. We propose a simple\nscheduling strategy to update the truncation tolerance throughout the iteration\naccording to a residual indicator. This controls the intermediate rank and\niteration number effectively. To perform rank truncation for nonlinear\nfunctions, we propose a new cross approximation, which we call Cross-DEIM, with\nadaptive error control that is based on the discrete empirical interpolation\nmethod (DEIM). Cross-DEIM employs an iterative update between the approximate\nsingular value decomposition (SVD) and cross approximation. It naturally\nincorporates a warm-start strategy for each lrAA iterate. We demonstrate the\nsuperior performance of lrAA applied to a range of linear and nonlinear\nproblems, including those arising from finite difference discretizations of\nLaplace's equation, the Bratu problem, the elliptic Monge-Amp\\'ere equation and\nthe Allen-Cahn equation.",

When the ball hits the nick between a vertical wall and\nthe floor, under certain conditions, it rolls without any vertical bounce. We\nstudy this process experimentally. We determined that the ball must hit the\nvertical wall first at a narrow range of heights above the floor, but most\nimportantly, it must touch the floor before finishing its rolling time on the\nvertical wall. When the rolling time is shorter than the contact time, the\nvertical momentum is canceled due to a mechanical frustration condition.

However, experimental methods for determining PPIs are\ncomputationally expensive. Thus, attention has been recently drawn to machine\nlearning approaches. Furthermore, insufficient effort has been made toward\nanalyzing signed PPI networks, which capture both activating (positive) and\ninhibitory (negative) interactions. To accurately represent biological\nrelationships, we present the Signed Two-Space Proximity Model (S2-SPM) for\nsigned PPI networks, which explicitly incorporates both types of interactions,\nreflecting the complex regulatory mechanisms within biological systems. This is\nachieved by leveraging two independent latent spaces to differentiate between\npositive and negative interactions while representing protein similarity\nthrough proximity in these spaces. Our approach also enables the identification\nof archetypes representing extreme protein profiles. S2-SPM's superior\nperformance in predicting the presence and sign of interactions in SPPI\nnetworks is demonstrated in link prediction tasks against relevant baseline\nmethods. Additionally, the biological prevalence of the identified archetypes\nis confirmed by an enrichment analysis of Gene Ontology (GO) terms, which\nreveals that distinct biological tasks are associated with archetypal groups\nformed by both interactions. This study is also validated regarding statistical\nsignificance and sensitivity analysis, providing insights into the functional\nroles of different interaction types.

The fundamental law governing this process is\ndriven by two opposing forces: one proportional to the current state,\nrepresenting the intensity of autocorrelation or contagion, and another\ninversely proportional to the elapsed time, acting as a damping function. The\ninterplay between these forces determines the diffusion regime, characterized\nby the ratio of their proportionality coefficients. This framework encompasses\nvarious regimes, including subdiffusion, Brownian non-Gaussian, superdiffusion,\nballistic, and hyperballistic behaviours. The hyperballistic regime emerges\nwhen the correlation force dominates over damping, whereas a balance between\nthese mechanisms results in a ballistic regime, which is also stationary.\nCrucially, non-stationarity is shown to be necessary for regimes other than\nballistic. The model's ability to describe hyperballistic phenomena has been\ndemonstrated in applications such as epidemics, software reliability, and\nnetwork traffic. Furthermore, deviations from Gaussianity are explored and\nviolations of the Central Limit Theorem are highlighted, supported by\ntheoretical analysis and simulations. It will also be shown that the model\nexhibits a strong autocorrelation structure due to a position dependent jump\nprobability.",

    "abstract": "Although Neptunian-sized (2 - 5 R$_{Earth}$) planets appear to be extremely\ncommon in the Galaxy, many mysteries remain about their overall nature. To\ndate, only 11 Neptunian-sized planets have had their atmospheres\nspectroscopically characterized, and these observations hint at interesting\ndiversity within this class of planets. Much of our understanding of these\nworlds and others derive from transmission spectroscopy with the Hubble Space\nTelescope's Wide Field Camera 3 (HST/WFC3). One key outcome of HST/WFC3\nobservations has been the consistent detection of water but no methane in\nNeptunian atmospheres, though recent James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)\nobservations are potentially starting to overturn this \"missing methane\"\nparadigm. In this work, we present the transmission spectrum of the hot Neptune\nHD 219666 b from 1.1 - 1.6 $\\mu$m from two transit observations using HST/WFC3\nG141. Our fiducial atmospheric retrieval detects water at ~3-$\\sigma$ in HD\n219666 b's atmosphere and prefers no contribution from methane, similar to\nthese previous observations of other planets. Motivated by recent detections of\nmethane in Neptunian atmospheres by JWST, we explore additional models and find\nthat a methane-only scenario could adequately fit the data, though it is not\npreferred and likely unphysical. We discuss the impact of this methane\ndetection challenge on our understanding of planetary atmospheres based on\nHST/WFC3 observations alone, and where JWST observations offer a solution.",

    "abstract": "Cislunar space is the volume between Earth's geosynchronous orbit and beyond\nthe Moon, including the lunar Lagrange points. Understanding the stability of\norbits within this space is crucial for the successful planning and execution\nof space missions. Orbits in cislunar space are influenced by the gravitational\nforces of the Sun, Earth, Moon, and other Solar System planets leading to\ntypically unpredictable and chaotic behavior. It is therefore difficult to\npredict the stability of an orbit from a set of initial orbital elements. We\nsimulate one million cislunar orbits and use a self-organizing map (SOM) to\ncluster the orbits into families based on how long they remain stable within\nthe cislunar regime. Utilizing Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory's (LLNL)\nHigh Performance Computers (HPC) we develop a highly adaptable SOM capable of\nefficiently characterizing observations from individual events. We are able to\npredict the lifetime from the initial three line element (TLE) to within 10\npercent for 8 percent of the test dataset, within 50 percent for 43 percent of\nthe dataset, and within 100 percent for 75 percent of the dataset. The\nfractional absolute deviation peaks at 1 for all lifetimes. Multi-modal\nclustering in the SOM suggests that a variety of orbital morphologies have\nsimilar lifetimes. The trained SOMs use an average of 2.73 milliseconds of\ncomputational time to produce an orbital stability prediction. The outcomes of\nthis research enhance our understanding of cislunar orbital dynamics and also\nprovide insights for mission planning, enabling the rapid identification of\nstable orbital regions and pathways for future space exploration.

In this work,\nwe study the intrinsic ductility of body-centered cubic WTaCrV based high\nentropy alloys (HEAs), which are known to exhibit excellent irradiation\nresistance. The ductility evaluations are carried out using a criterion based\non the competition between the critical stress intensity factors for emission\n(KIe) and cleavage (KIc) in the {110} slip planes and {110} crack planes, which\nare evaluated within the linear elastic fracture mechanics framework and\ncomputed using density functional theory calculations. The results suggest that\nincreasing the alloying concentrations of V and reducing the concentrations of\nW can significantly improve the ductility in these HEAs. The elastic anisotropy\nfor these HEAs is analyzed using the Zener anisotropy ratio and its correlation\nwith the concentration of W in the alloys is studied. Results indicate that\nthese alloys tend to be fairly isotropic independently from the concentration\nof W in them. The computed data for the elastic constants of these HEAs is also\ncompared against the available experimental data. The results are in good\nagreement, hence validating the robustness and accuracy of the computational\nmethods. Multiple phenomenological ductility metrics were also computed and\nanalyzed against the analytical model.

We start by presenting phenomenology\nrevealed by wave-averaged numerical simulations: an accumulation of angular\nmomentum in coherent vortices perpendicular to the direction of wave\npropagation, suppression of kinetic energy dissipation, and the development of\ndepth-alternating jets. We interpret these features through an analogy with\nrotating turbulence (Holm 1996), wherein the curl of the Stokes drift,\n$\\boldsymbol{\\nabla}\\times\\boldsymbol{u}^S$, takes on the role of the\nbackground vorticity (for example, $(f_0 + \\beta y) \\hat{\\boldsymbol{z}}$ on\nthe beta plane). We pursue this thread further by showing that a two-equation\nmodel proposed by Bardina et al. (1985) for rotating turbulence reproduces the\nsimulated evolution of volume-integrated kinetic energy. This success of the\ntwo-equation model -- which explicitly parametrizes wave-driven suppression of\nkinetic energy dissipation -- carries implications for modeling turbulent\nmixing in the ocean surface boundary layer. We conclude with a discussion about\na wave-averaged analogue of the Rossby number appearing in the two-equation\nmodel, which we term the \"pseudovorticity number\" after the pseudovorticity\n$\\boldsymbol{\\nabla}\\times\\boldsymbol{u}^S$.

Given the gas inflow rates in protogalaxies,\nBHs grow episodically at moderate super-Eddington rates and the mass ratio\nincreases early on, despite significant mass loss through feedback.

This behavior defines an attractor in the $M_{\\rm\nBH}-M_{\\star}$ diagram, where overmassive BHs grow more slowly than their\nhosts, while undermassive seeds experience rapid growth before aligning with\nthe attractor.

    "abstract": "Quantum error correction (QEC) protects quantum systems against inevitable\nnoises and control inaccuracies, providing a pathway towards fault-tolerant\n(FT) quantum computation. Stabilizer codes, including surface code and color\ncode, have long been the focus of research and have seen significant\nexperimental progress in recent years. Recently proposed time-dynamical QEC,\nincluding Floquet codes and generalized time-dynamical code implementations,\nopens up new opportunities for FT quantum computation. By employing a periodic\nschedule of low-weight parity checks, Floquet codes can generate additional\ndynamical logical qubits, offering enhanced error correction capabilities and\npotentially higher code performance. Here, we experimentally implement the\nFloquet-Bacon-Shor code on a superconducting quantum processor. We encode a\ndynamical logical qubit within a $3\\times 3$ lattice of data qubits, alongside\na conventional static logical qubit. We demonstrate FT encoding and measurement\nof the two-qubit logical states, and stabilize these states using repeated\nerror detection. We showcase universal single-qubit logical gates on the\ndynamical qubit. Furthermore, by implementing a logical CNOT gate, we entangle\nthe dynamical and static logical qubits, generating an error-detected logical\nBell state with a fidelity of 75.9\\%. Our results highlight the potential of\nFloquet codes for resource-efficient FT quantum computation.",

Isothermal calorimetry\ndemonstrated that pristine BG incorporation delays hydration, whereas silica\ncoatings mitigate this, with type A coating being more effective. Early\ncompressive strength was reduced in BG-containing mixes but normalised after\nseven days. Rheological tests showed that BG additives enhanced thixotropy and\nyield shear stresses, with 2.5 vol% being optimal, especially with method B\ncoating. Green strength properties improved significantly with method B coated\nparticles, showing up to 62.4% and 57.7% increases in strength and modulus,\nrespectively, after 30 minutes. Micro-CT and MIP analyses confirmed reduced\nporosity and refined pore structure with silica coatings. Radiation shielding\ntests indicated superior performance in uncoated BG mixes, with method B\ncoating providing superior shielding performance compared to that of method A\ncoatings due to their higher surface area.

It finds weights for the treatment group which are close\nto uniform, but make the group's covariate means (approximately) equal to those\nof the entire sample. A crucial question is: how approximate should the\nbalancing be, in order to minimize the error of the final estimate? Current\nguidance is derived from heuristic or asymptotic analyses, which are\nuninformative when the size of the sample is small compared to the number of\ncovariates. This paper presents the first rigorous, nonasymptotic analysis of\ncovariate balancing; specifically, we use PAC-Bayesian techniques to derive\nvalid, finite-sample confidence intervals for the treatment effect. More\ngenerally, we prove these guarantees for a flexible form of covariate balancing\nwhere the regularization parameters weighting the tradeoff between bias\n(imbalance) and variance (divergence from uniform) are optimized, not fixed.\nThis gives rise to a new balancing algorithm which empirically delivers\nsuperior adaptivity.

The exponential decay rate in these estimates is\noptimal, in the sense that it cannot be improved based solely on a uniform\nbound on the Ricci curvature.\n  The paper offers two conceptual takeaways. Firstly, in pursuit of decay\nestimates, it may be worth shifting the emphasis from the resolvent kernel to\nits density - a geometrically more natural object. Secondly, contrary to\nexpectations, the exponential decay of the resolvent kernel is driven mainly by\nthe area/volume growth, and the bottom of the spectrum of $\\Delta$ is not a\ndecisive factor. This is in contrast with the heat kernel decay, and shows that\noptimal resolvent kernel estimates cannot be implied from heat kernel\nestimates.",

By combining the\nprinciple of stationary action with maximum entropy production, we show that\ndivergences in dual affine connections naturally give rise to quantum\ninterference and nonlocal correlations. These ideas of maximum entropy and\nstationary align with the framework of entropic dynamics, wherein time\nevolution emerges from information-theoretic principles. A key insight comes\nfrom Berry phases. the mismatch of multiple affine connections leads to a\nnontrivial holonomy or \"area\", explaining how Bell type inequalities can be\nviolated up to the Tsirelson bound. Additionally, we interpret sharply peaked\ndistributions as \"pinning\" or \"sourcing\" curvature in the information manifold,\ndrawing an analogy to a membrane under uniform stress. In this view,\nentanglement and coherence emerge as geometric features, phases and rotations\nwithin an overarching multi affine structure. We conclude that phenomena such\nas wavefunction collapse and quantum steering can be viewed as constraints on\nthe manifold's \"laxity\" or curvature, with far-reaching implications for\nunderstanding quantum behavior in a geometric-information setting.",

    "abstract": "We present photometric and spectroscopic data of the type IIb supernova (SN)\n2024abfo in NGC 1493 (at 11 Mpc). The ATLAS survey discovered the object just a\nfew hours after the explosion, and observed a fast rise on the first day. Signs\nof the sharp shock break-out peak and the subsequent cooling phase are observed\nin the ultraviolet and the bluest optical bands in the first couple of days,\nwhile no peak is visible in the reddest filters. Subsequently, in analogy with\nnormal SNe IIb, the light curve of SN 2024abfo rises again in all bands to the\nbroad peak, with the maximum light reached around one month after the\nexplosion. Its absolute magnitude at peak is $M_r=-16.5\\pm0.1$ mag, making it a\nfaint SN IIb. The early spectra are dominated by Balmer lines with broad\nP-Cygni profiles indicating ejecta velocity of 22,500 km/s. One month after the\nexplosion, the spectra display a transition towards being He-dominated, though\nthe H lines do not completely disappear, supporting the classification of SN\n2024abfo as a relatively H-rich SN IIb. We identify the progenitor of SN\n2024abfo in archival images of the Hubble Space Telescope, the Dark Energy\nSurvey, and the XMM-Newton space telescope, in multiple optical filters. From\nits spectral energy distribution, the progenitor is consistent with being a\nyellow supergiant, having an initial mass of 15 $M_{\\odot}$. This detection\nsupports an emerging trend of SN IIb progenitors being more luminous and hotter\nthan SN II ones, and being primaries of massive binaries. Within the SN IIb\nclass, fainter events such as SN 2024abfo tend to have cooler and more expanded\nprogenitors than luminous SNe IIb.",

Nevertheless, the\nunderlying deformation mechanisms and how cell shape anisotropy induces this\nmechanical anisotropy are not yet fully understood, in particular for the foams\nwith a high cell face fraction and low relative density. Moreover, the impacts\nof mesostructural stochastics are often overlooked. This contribution conducts\na systematic numerical study on the anisotropic compressive behaviour of\nlow-density closed-cell foams, which accounts for cell shape anisotropy, cell\nstructure and different mesostructural stochastics. Representative volume\nelements (RVE) of foam mesostructures are modeled, with cell walls described as\nReissner-Mindlin shells in a finite rotation setting. A mixed stress-strain\ndriven homogenization scheme is introduced, which allows for enforcing an\noverall uniaxial stress state. Quantitative analysis of the cell wall\ndeformation behaviour confirms the dominant role of membrane deformation in the\ninitial elastic region, while the bending contribution gets important only\nafter buckling, followed by membrane yielding. Based on the identified\ndeformation mechanisms, analytical models are developed that relates mechanical\nanisotropy to cell shape anisotropy. It is found that cell shape anisotropy\ntranslates into the anisotropy of compressive properties through three\npathways, cell load-bearing area fraction, cell wall buckling strength and cell\nwall inclination angle. Besides, the resulting mechanical anisotropy is\nstrongly affected by the cell shape anisotropy stochastics while almost\ninsensitive to the cell size and cell wall thickness stochastics. The present\nfindings provide deeper insights into the relationships between the anisotropic\ncompressive properties and mesostructures of low-density closed-cell foams.",

The recent results\nof the ALPHA-g experiment, which show gravitational attraction between\nantihydrogen atoms and the Earth, seem to undermine this success in the\ncosmological field. Analyzing the above theory, we find two solutions that can\nbe consistent with the experimental results, while preserving the large-scale\ngravitational repulsion. The first highlights how repulsive gravity can be the\nresult of the interaction with an inverted space-time, but occupied by matter\nand not antimatter, and therefore the antimatter present in our space-time has\nno reason to exhibit gravitational repulsion. The second retains the original\nCPT transformation, resulting in repulsive gravity between matter and\nantimatter, but with the caveat that antimatter immersed in our space-time\ncannot exhibit the PT transformation which is the cause of the repulsion.\nFinally, it is shown that, in a Newtonian approximation of the geodesic\nequation, time reversal is not a necessary operation for repulsive gravity,\ntherefore opening the possibility of an expanding cosmos with a single time\ndirection.",

While magnetic braking slows\nrotation in single stars, close binaries experience synchronization from tidal\nforces, resulting in high spin rates. Thus, fast rotators often signify\nsynchronized binaries or planetary systems. We analyze stellar rotation in the\nKepler field to photometrically identify non-single systems. Establishing an\ninitial rotation-temperature relationship for individual stars via young\nclusters, we confirm our findings through magnitude excess and prior binary\nstar system studies. Stars rotating faster than this relationship display a\nbimodal distribution in peculiar velocity, indicative of non-single or young\nstars. Leveraging this, we separate non-single stars when peculiar velocity is\nmeasurable, or estimate likelihood for those without. Our method identifies\n2229 potential non-single star systems with rotation periods exceeding 3 days.\nFor ultra-fast rotators ($P_{rot} < 3 days$), we compile a catalog of 1518\nultra-short-period binary candidates, often part of hierarchical triples,\nreinforcing rapid spin's association with multiplicity. Applying our method to\nplanet-host stars uncovers Kepler-1184 as a potential circumbinary system and\nidentifies Kepler-493 and Kepler-957 potentially synchronized by close-in\nplanets, with three others as potential false positives. Analysis of known\nnon-single stars reveals clear tidal effects: period synchronization, orbit\ncircularization, and a minimal pericenter constraint for binaries ($r_p \\propto\n(P_{orb}/P_{rot})^{0.77}$).

However, accessing this particle content in a\ncontrolled laboratory experiment has remained out of experimental reach. Here\nwe propose to overcome this challenge with a quantum mirror made from a\ntwo-dimensional sub-wavelength array of atoms that divides a photonic cavity.\nThe arrays response to light is tunable between transmissive and reflective\nstates by a control atom that is excited to a Rydberg state. We find that\nphoton content from entangled sub-regions of the vacuum causes subtle frequency\nshifts that are accessible to sub-wavelength atom array platforms. This novel\napproach for probing vacuum particle content stems from the systems unique\nability to create coherent dynamics of superpositions of transmissive and\nreflective states, providing a quantum-enhanced platform for observing particle\ncontent from entangled spatial sub-regions of the electromagnetic field vacuum.",

The pair hopping results in a bunching state\nwith superextensive energy and macroscopic particle number fluctuations at\nstrong electric field strengths and weak on-site interactions.

For optimal performance, these\nparameters must be tuned to the specific job being run. Tuning commonly\nrequires multiple executions to collect runtime information for updating\nparameters.

Our method achieves 93.3% of the\nruntime improvement of state-of-the-art one-execution optimization, entirely\navoiding the slow initial execution using default settings. The shift to\nzero-execution tuning results in a lower cumulative runtime over the first 140\nruns, and provides the largest benefit for ad hoc and analytical queries which\nonly need to be executed once.

In this work, we introduce a\nring-theoretic approach for efficiently analyzing topological CSS codes in two\ndimensions, enabling the exploration of generalized toric codes with larger\nlogical dimensions on twisted tori. Using Gr\\\"obner bases, we simplify\nstabilizer syndromes to efficiently identify anyon excitations and their\ngeometric periodicities, even under twisted periodic boundary conditions. Since\nthe properties of the codes are determined by the anyons, this approach allows\nus to directly compute the logical dimensions without constructing large\nparity-check matrices. Our approach provides a unified method for finding new\nquantum error-correcting codes and exhibiting their underlying topological\norders via the Laurent polynomial ring. This framework naturally applies to\nbivariate bicycle codes. For example, we construct optimal weight-6 generalized\ntoric codes on twisted tori with parameters $[[ n, k, d ]]$ for $n \\leq 400$,\nyielding novel codes such as $[[120,8,12]]$, $[[186,10,14]]$, $[[210,10,16]]$,\n$[[248, 10, 18]]$, $[[254, 14, 16]]$, $[[294, 10, 20]]$, $[[310, 10, \\leq\n22]]$, and $[[340, 16, 18]]$. Moreover, we present a new realization of the\n$[[360, 12, \\leq 24]]$ quantum code using the $(3,3)$-bivariate bicycle code on\na twisted torus defined by the basis vectors $(0,30)$ and $(6,6)$, improving\nstabilizer locality relative to the previous construction. These results\nhighlight the power of the topological order perspective in advancing the\ndesign and theoretical understanding of quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC)\ncodes.",

Globally, the\nsimulated systems have HI and molecular hydrogen (H$_2$) masses in good\nagreement with the observations, but only when the H$_2$ recipe of Blitz &\nRosolowsky (2006) is employed. The other recipes that we tested overestimate\nthe H$_2$-to-HI mass fraction by up to an order of magnitude. On a local scale,\nwe find two main discrepancies between observed and simulated data. First, the\nsimulated galaxies show a more irregular HI morphology than the observed ones\ndue to the presence of HI with column density $<10^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$ up to ~100\nkpc from the galaxy centre, in spite of the fact that they inhabit more\nisolated environments than the observed targets. Second, the simulated galaxies\nand in particular those from the FIRE-2 suite, feature more complex and overall\nbroader HI line profiles than the observed ones. We interpret this as being due\nto the combined effect of stellar feedback and gas accretion, which lead to a\nlarge-scale gas circulation that is more vigorous than in the observed\ngalaxies.

We find that all simulations predict strong negative (i.e.,\nradially decreasing) metallicity gradients at early cosmic times, likely due to\ntheir similar treatments of relatively smooth stellar feedback not providing\nsufficient mixing to quickly flatten gradients. The strongest redshift\nevolution occurs in galaxies with stellar masses of\n$10^{10.0}-10^{11.0}M_\\odot$, while galaxies with stellar masses $<\n10^{10}M_\\odot$ and $>10^{11}M_\\odot$ exhibit weaker redshift evolution.

    "abstract": "Population III (Pop III) stars are the first stars in the Universe, forming\nfrom pristine, metal-free gas and marking the end of the cosmic dark ages.\nTheir formation rate is expected to sharply decline after redshift $z \\approx\n15$ due to metal enrichment from previous generations of stars. In this paper,\nwe analyze 14 zoom-in simulations from the THESAN-ZOOM project, which evolves\ndifferent haloes from the THESAN-1 cosmological box down to redshift $z=3$. The\nhigh mass resolution of up to $142 M_\\odot$ per cell in the gas phase combined\nwith a multiphase model of the interstellar medium (ISM), radiative transfer\nincluding Lyman-Werner radiation, dust physics, and a non-equilibrium chemistry\nnetwork that tracks molecular hydrogen, allows for a realistic but still\napproximate description of Pop III star formation in pristine gas. Our results\nshow that Pop III stars continue to form in low-mass haloes ranging from $10^6\nM_\\odot$ to $10^9 M_\\odot$ until the end of reionization at around $z=5$. At\nthis stage, photoevaporation suppresses further star formation in these\nminihaloes, which subsequently merge into larger central haloes. Hence, the\nremnants of Pop III stars primarily reside in the satellite galaxies of larger\nhaloes at lower redshifts. While direct detection of Pop III stars remains\nelusive, these results hint that lingering primordial star formation could\nleave observable imprints or indirectly affect the properties of high-redshift\ngalaxies. Explicit Pop III feedback and specialized initial mass function\nmodelling within the THESAN-ZOOM framework would further help interpreting\nemerging constraints from the James Webb Space Telescope.",

We calculate the spectra that may manifest in\nresonances with ring orbits or in Doppler imaging of Uranus's visible surface,\nusing a wide range of interior models that satisfy the present constraints.\nRecent work has shown that Uranus's fundamental (f) and internal gravity (g)\nmodes have appropriate frequencies to resonate with Uranus's narrow rings.

Two main formation channels are generally considered to explain the\nformation of these merging binary black holes (BBHs): the isolated evolution of\nstellar binaries, and the dynamical assembly in dense environments, namely star\nclusters. Although their relative contributions remain unclear, several\nanalyses indicate that the detected BBH mergers probably originate from a\nmixture of these two distinct scenarios. We study the formation of massive star\nclusters across time and at a cosmological scale to estimate the contribution\nof these dense stellar structures to the overall population of BBH mergers. To\nthis end, we propose three different models of massive star cluster formation\nbased on results obtained with zoom-in simulations of individual galaxies. We\napply these models to a large sample of realistic galaxies identified in the\n$(22.1\\ \\mathrm{Mpc})^3$ cosmological volume simulation \\firebox. Each galaxy\nin this simulation has a unique star formation rate, with its own history of\nhalo mergers and metallicity evolution. Combined with predictions obtained with\nthe Cluster Monte Carlo code for stellar dynamics, we are able to estimate\npopulations of dynamically formed BBHs in a collection of realistic galaxies.\nAcross our three models, we infer a local merger rate of BBHs formed in massive\nstar clusters consistently in the range $1-10\\\n\\mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. Compared with the local BBH merger rate\ninferred by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration (in the range $17.9-44\\\n\\mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ at $z=0.2$), this could potentially\nrepresent up to half of all BBH mergers in the nearby Universe.

    "abstract": "In classic time-dependent 1D accretion disk models, the inner radiation\npressure dominated regime is viscously unstable. However, late-time\nobservations of accretion disks formed in tidal disruption events (TDEs) do not\nexhibit evidence of such instabilities. The common theoretical response is to\nmodify the viscosity parametrization, but typically used viscosity\nparametrization are generally ad hoc. In this study, we take a different\napproach, and investigate a time-dependent 1D $\\alpha$-disk model in which the\npressure is dominated by magnetic fields rather than photons. We compare the\ntime evolution of thermally stable, strongly magnetized TDE disks to the\nsimpler linear viscosity model. We find that the light curves of magnetized\ndisks evolve as $L_{\\rm UV}\\propto t^{-5/6}$ for decades to centuries, and that\nthis same evolution can be reproduced by the linear viscosity model for\nspecific parameter choices. Additionally, we show that TDEs remain UV-bright\nfor many years, suggesting we could possibly find fossil TDEs decades after\ntheir bursts. We estimate that ULTRASAT could detect hundreds of such events,\nproviding an opportunity to study late-stage TDE physics and supermassive black\nhole (SMBH) properties. Finally, we explore the connection between TDE disks\nand quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) suggested by recent observations. One\ntheoretical explanation involves TDE disks expanding to interact with extreme\nmass ratio inspirals (EMRIs), which produce X-ray flares as the EMRI passes\nthrough the disk. Our estimates indicate that magnetized TDE disks should\nexhibit QPEs earlier than those observed in AT2019qiz, suggesting that the QPEs\nmay have begun before their first detection.",

GraphNPE (Graph\nNeural Posterior Estimator), first introduced in Nguyen et al.

Here, we apply GraphNPE to satellite dwarf galaxies in the\nFIRE-2 Latte simulation suite of Milky Way-mass halos, testing it against both\nCold and Self-Interacting DM scenarios. Our method demonstrates superior\nprecision compared to conventional Jeans-based approaches, recovering DM\ndensity profiles to within the 95% confidence level even in systems with as few\nas 30 tracers. Moreover, we present the first evaluation of mass modeling\nmethods in constraining two key parameters from realistic simulations: the peak\ncircular velocity, $V_\\mathrm{max}$, and the peak virial mass,\n$M_\\mathrm{200m}^\\mathrm{peak}$. Using only line-of-sight velocities, GraphNPE\ncan reliably recover both $V_\\mathrm{max}$ and $M_\\mathrm{200m}^\\mathrm{peak}$\nwithin our quoted uncertainties, including those experiencing tidal effects\n($\\gtrsim$ 63% of systems are recovered with our 68% confidence intervals and\n$\\gtrsim$ 92% within our 95% confidence intervals).

This work establishes GraphNPE as a robust\ntool for inferring DM density profiles in dwarf galaxies, offering promising\navenues for constraining DM models.

Camera control, if implemented\nat all, is imprecise, because camera parameters are mere inputs to the neural\nnetwork which must then infer how the video depends on the camera. In contrast,\nGEN3C is guided by a 3D cache: point clouds obtained by predicting the\npixel-wise depth of seed images or previously generated frames. When generating\nthe next frames, GEN3C is conditioned on the 2D renderings of the 3D cache with\nthe new camera trajectory provided by the user. Crucially, this means that\nGEN3C neither has to remember what it previously generated nor does it have to\ninfer the image structure from the camera pose.

    "abstract": "Searches for continuous gravitational waves from isolated compact objects and\nthose in binary systems aim to detect non-axisymmetric, deformed neutron stars\nat particular locations in the Galaxy or all-sky. However, a large fraction of\nknown pulsars have rotational frequencies that lie outside the audio frequency\nband, rendering current detectors insensitive to these pulsars. In this work,\nwe show that DECIGO, a future space-based deci-hertz gravitational-wave\ninterferometer, will be sensitive to severely deformed compact objects, e.g.\nhybrid stars, neutron stars, or magnetars. We estimate the number of possible\ncompact objects that could be detected with such high deformations, both via\ntheir individual continuous gravitational-wave emission and the stochastic\ngravitational-wave background created by a superposition of gravitational waves\nfrom the $\\sim 10^8$ compact objects in the Galaxy. Furthermore, we show that\nthe existence of such compact objects could be probed across a wide parameter\nspace at a fraction of the computational cost of current searches for isolated\ncompact objects and those in binary systems. For known pulsars, we will be able\nto both beat the spin-down limit and probe the Brans-Dicke modified theory of\ngravity parameter $\\zeta<1$ for approximately 85% of known pulsars with $f_{\\rm\ngw}<10$ Hz, the latter of which is currently only possible for $O(10)$ pulsars.\nDECIGO will thus open a new window to probe highly deformed compact objects and\nover half of the known pulsars, both of which are currently inaccessible to\nground-based detectors.",

The large stellar obliquities of these giants have\nlong been considered potential signatures of high-eccentricity migration, which\nis expected to clear out any nearby planetary companions. This scenario\nrequires that only isolated hot Jupiters be spin-orbit misaligned while those\nwith nearby companions, which must have more quiescent histories, maintain\nlow-obliquity orbits, assuming they formed aligned within their primordial\nprotoplanetary disks. Investigations of this stellar obliquity-companionship\nconnection, however, have been severely limited by the lack of hot Jupiters\nfound in compact multi-planet systems. Here we present the sky-projected\nstellar obliquity ($\\lambda$) of a hot Jupiter with a nearby inner companion\nrecently discovered by NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite: TOI-5143\nc. Specifically, we utilize the Doppler shadow caused by the planet's transit,\nenabled by the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect, to find that the planet is\naligned with $\\lambda=2.1 ^{+2.8}_{-2.7} \\circ$. Of the exoplanets with RM\nmeasurements, TOI-5143 c becomes just the third hot Jupiter with a nearby\ncompanion, and is part of the 19th compact multi-planet single-star system,\nwith an RM measurement. The spin-orbit alignment of these 19 systems provides\nstrong support for primordial alignment, and thus implies that large\nobliquities are gained primarily due to post-disk dynamical interactions such\nas those inherent to high-eccentricity migration. As such, the observed\nspin-orbit alignment of hot Jupiters with nearby companions affirms that some\nfraction of these giants instead have quiescent origins.",

In this work, we consider\nthree types of constraints: rate constraints, dimension constraints, and\nchannel constraints, motivated by perception-aware lossy compression,\ngenerative principal component analysis, and deep joint source-channel coding,\nrespectively.

We want to assess the\nimpact of galaxy mergers and the environment on AGN triggering in dwarf\ngalaxies. We use a sample of 3280 dwarf galaxies with integral-field\nspectroscopic data from the MaNGA survey to study the AGN fraction throughout\nthe merger process and how it is affected by the environment (characterized by\ngalaxy isolation, being in a void, and group richness). We also compare the\nfraction of interacting galaxies in AGN and non-AGN dwarf galaxies. We find\nthat dwarf galaxy mergers can ignite AGNs at separations below 20 kpc. The AGN\nfraction increases notoriously after the first pass and remains enhanced until\nthe final stage. Despite this, mergers are not the dominant AGN triggering\nmechanism. We also find that the environment has a non-negligible impact on AGN\nactivity in dwarf galaxies, as the AGN fraction increases when moving to lower\ndensity environments. These findings provide the most statistically robust\nconstraints to date on the effects of dwarf galaxy mergers and environment on\nAGN activity and black hole growth.",

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the challenge of packet-based information routing in\nlarge-scale wireless communication networks. The problem is framed as a\nconstrained statistical learning task, where each network node operates using\nonly local information. Opportunistic routing exploits the broadcast nature of\nwireless communication to dynamically select optimal forwarding nodes, enabling\nthe information to reach the destination through multiple relay nodes\nsimultaneously. To solve this, we propose a State-Augmentation (SA) based\ndistributed optimization approach aimed at maximizing the total information\nhandled by the source nodes in the network. The problem formulation leverages\nGraph Neural Networks (GNNs), which perform graph convolutions based on the\ntopological connections between network nodes. Using an unsupervised learning\nparadigm, we extract routing policies from the GNN architecture, enabling\noptimal decisions for source nodes across various flows. Numerical experiments\ndemonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance when\ntraining a GNN-parameterized model, particularly when compared to baseline\nalgorithms. Additionally, applying the method to real-world network topologies\nand wireless ad-hoc network test beds validates its effectiveness, highlighting\nthe robustness and transferability of GNNs.",

SNe IIb are produced from the core-collapse of massive\nstars whose outermost Hydrogen layer has been partially stripped prior to\nexplosion. These double-peaked light curves, consisting of a shock-cooling\nemission peak (SCE) followed by the main nickel-powered peak, contain more\ncrucial information about the progenitor system than the typical single-peaked\nlight curves. We compiled and analyzed a sample of 14 spectroscopically\nconfirmed SNe IIb -- including previously unpublished and re-classified -- with\npublicly available photometric observations, discovered between 2018--2022,\nfrom the ZTF and ATLAS surveys. We developed and fit a piecewise linear model,\nreferred to as the ``lightning bolt model,'' to describe the early-time\nbehavior of these objects to measure population statistics. Notably, we find\nthe SCE peak lasts, on average, fewer than five days above half-maximum light\nwith a mean rise time of $2.07\\pm1.0$ and $1.1\\pm0.8$ mags/day in the g- and\nr-band respectively. These SCE rise rates are over 10x faster than -- and last\nonly a third the duration of -- the rise to the nickel-powered peak. These rise\ntimes are comparable to those of fast blue optical transient (FBOT) events and\nwe discuss the implications in the text. Finally, we present a proof-of-concept\nalert filter, using the ANTARES broker, to demonstrate how to translate these\npopulation statistics into simple and effective filters to find potential\ndouble-peaked SNe IIb in large-scale survey alert streams, like the imminent\nVera C.

    "abstract": "The recent advances in deep clustering have been made possible by significant\nprogress in self-supervised and pseudo-supervised learning. However, the\ntrade-off between self-supervision and pseudo-supervision can give rise to\nthree primary issues. The joint training causes Feature Randomness and Feature\nDrift, whereas the independent training causes Feature Randomness and Feature\nTwist. In essence, using pseudo-labels generates random and unreliable\nfeatures. The combination of pseudo-supervision and self-supervision drifts the\nreliable clustering-oriented features. Moreover, moving from self-supervision\nto pseudo-supervision can twist the curved latent manifolds. This paper\naddresses the limitations of existing deep clustering paradigms concerning\nFeature Randomness, Feature Drift, and Feature Twist. We propose a new paradigm\nwith a new strategy that replaces pseudo-supervision with a second round of\nself-supervision training. The new strategy makes the transition between\ninstance-level self-supervision and neighborhood-level self-supervision\nsmoother and less abrupt. Moreover, it prevents the drifting effect that is\ncaused by the strong competition between instance-level self-supervision and\nclustering-level pseudo-supervision. Moreover, the absence of the\npseudo-supervision prevents the risk of generating random features. With this\nnovel approach, our paper introduces a Rethinking of the Deep Clustering\nParadigms, denoted by R-DC. Our model is specifically designed to address three\nprimary challenges encountered in Deep Clustering: Feature Randomness, Feature\nDrift, and Feature Twist.

We\nexplore a simple model of hyperbolic diffusion for the radial spread of\nmaterial in planetary rings. The model arises by the introduction of a\nrelaxation time in an advection equation for the radial diffusive angular\nmomentum flux. We show that radial secular forcing, combined with a hyperbolic\ndiffusion equation, leads to sharp gap edges, in which the density of ring\nmaterial drops precipitously down to zero at some critical distance from the\nmoon's orbit. Additionally, we show that our simple model can produce large\n``spikes'' or ``horns'' in the density profile on either side of a ring gap,\nmirroring results of large N-body simulations.

In\nthis work, we propose a comprehensive active perception framework for\nestimating the 6D poses of textureless objects using only RGB images. Our\napproach is built upon a key idea: decoupling the 6D pose estimation into a\nsequential two-step process can greatly improve both accuracy and efficiency.\nFirst, we estimate the 3D translation of each object, resolving scale and depth\nambiguities inherent to RGB images. These estimates are then used to simplify\nthe subsequent task of determining the 3D orientation, which we achieve through\ncanonical scale template matching. Building on this formulation, we then\nintroduce an active perception strategy that predicts the next best camera\nviewpoint to capture an RGB image, effectively reducing object pose uncertainty\nand enhancing pose accuracy. We evaluate our method on the public ROBI dataset\nas well as on a transparent object dataset that we created. When evaluated\nusing the same camera viewpoints, our multi-view pose estimation significantly\noutperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

Additionally, this work presents the\nfirst cross-architecture analysis of soft error-prone Linux kernel components\nin modern SoCs to develop targeted mitigations. The findings establish\nfoundational data on Linux's soft error sensitivity in COTS SoCs, guiding\nmission readiness for space applications.",

The present report examines how these elements interact with each\nother by incorporating OHCs into the simplest local cochlear models. In the\nfrequency range, typically above 1 kHz, where capacitive conductance is greater\nthan the ionic conductance, hair bundle (HB) conductance drives the\npiezoelectric cell body and amplified oscillation by countering viscous drag,\nwhile the cell body increases its stiffness owing to strain-induced\npolarization, elevating the resonance frequency.

They are\ncharacterized by a spin-polarized electronic band structure similar to\nferromagnets, but with net zero magnetization, and touted as a promising\nplatform to host a slew of exotic properties, many of which are yet to be\nexplored. Here we study a new layered triangular lattice altermagnet,\nCo-intercalated NbSe$_2$ using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy\n(STM/S). Differential conductance dI/dV spectra at low temperature reveal a\nsurprising partial gap opening centered at the Fermi level, which is not\ncaptured by density functional theory calculations of the system in the pure\naltermagnetic state. Spatial mapping using spectroscopic-imaging STM and\nspin-polarized STM further reveals emergent tri-directional charge and spin\ndensity modulations with a 2a$_0$ wave length. Interestingly, we discover that\nout-of-plane magnetic field can serve as a knob to tune the amplitudes of the\nmodulations as well as alter the overall electronic density-of-states in a\nmanner that is strongly dependent on the field direction and strength. This can\nbe attributed to the tilting of spins by the external magnetic field, which can\nhave profound implications on the electronic properties of the altermagnet. By\nproviding elusive atomic-scale insights, our work uncovers a tunable density\nwave accompanied by concomitant changes in the electronic band structure, and\nsets the foundation for studies of correlated electronic phenomena in\naltermagnets.",

We substantiate this observation by introducing the Van Vleck\nperturbation theory into the field of many-body localization. The\nappropriateness of this method rests largely on the peculiar Hilbert-space\nstructure enabled by the particles' Bose statistics. The situation is reversed\nin the lower-energy section of the dynamical phase diagram, where the\nsignificant finite-size boundary drift pushes the putative many-body localized\nregime up to the greater disorder strengths. We utilize the algebraic\nprojection method to make a connection linking the disordered Bose-Hubbard\nmodel in the lower-energy section to an intricate disordered spin chain model.\nThis issue of the finite-size drift could hence be analogous to what happens in\nthe disordered Heisenberg chain.

Through gradient-based analysis, we identify these\nshortcomings and propose an improved safety alignment that disentangles DPO\nobjectives into two components: (1) robust refusal training, which encourages\nrefusal even when partial unsafe generations are produced, and (2) targeted\nunlearning of harmful knowledge.

We investigate the distinct features of PRGs by\nanalysing their ring and host components to reveal their unique characteristics\nthrough Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) fitting. Using CIGALE, we performed\nSED fitting to independently analyse the ring and host spatially resolved\nregions, marking the first decomposed SED analysis for PRGs, which examines\nstellar populations using high-resolution observations from AstroSat UVIT at a\nresolved scale. The UV-optical surface profiles provide an initial idea that\ndistinct patterns in the galaxies, with differences in FUV and NUV, suggest\nthree distinct stages of ring evolution in the selected galaxies. The study of\nresolved-scale stellar regions reveals that the ring regions are generally\nyounger than their host galaxies, with the age disparity progressively\ndecreasing along the evolutionary sequence from NGC 3718 to NGC 4262. Star\nformation rates (SFR) also exhibit a consistent pattern, with higher SFR in the\nring of NGC 3718 compared to the others, and a progressive decrease through NGC\n2685 and NGC 4262.

Among these tricks, the most challenging is the precise\ntuning of adversarial training with additional Generative Adversarial Networks\n(GANs) in the final stage, which can hinder stable convergence. In contrast to\nGANs, diffusion models offer more stable training processes and can generate\nhigher-quality results. Inspired by these advantages, we propose CDT, a novel\nConditioned Diffusion-based video Tokenizer, that replaces the GAN-based\ndecoder with a conditional causal diffusion model. The encoder compresses\nspatio-temporal information into compact latents, while the decoder\nreconstructs videos through a reverse diffusion process conditioned on these\nlatents. During inference, we incorporate a feature cache mechanism to generate\nvideos of arbitrary length while maintaining temporal continuity and adopt\nsampling acceleration technique to enhance efficiency. Trained using only a\nbasic MSE diffusion loss for reconstruction, along with KL term and LPIPS\nperceptual loss from scratch, extensive experiments demonstrate that CDT\nachieves state-of-the-art performance in video reconstruction tasks with just a\nsingle-step sampling. Even a scaled-down version of CDT (3$\\times$ inference\nspeedup) still performs comparably with top baselines. Moreover, the latent\nvideo generation model trained with CDT also exhibits superior performance. The\nsource code and pretrained weights are available at\nhttps://github.com/ali-vilab/CDT.",

Moreover, such unreliable or\nunderrepresented strategies can be difficult even for people to discern, and\nsifting through demonstration datasets is time-consuming and costly. On the\nother hand, policy performance when trained on such demonstrations can reflect\nthe reliability of different strategies.

    "abstract": "In recent years, human in silico trials have gained significant traction as a\npowerful approach to evaluate the effects of drugs, clinical interventions, and\nmedical devices. In silico trials not only minimise patient risks but also\nreduce reliance on animal testing. However, the implementation of in silico\ntrials presents several time-consuming challenges. It requires the creation of\nlarge cohorts of virtual patients. Each virtual patient is described by their\nanatomy with a volumetric mesh and electrophysiological and mechanical dynamics\nthrough mathematical equations and parameters. Furthermore, simulated\nconditions need definition including stimulation protocols and therapy\nevaluation. For large virtual cohorts, this requires automatic and efficient\npipelines for generation of corresponding files. In this work, we present a\ncomputational pipeline to automatically create large virtual patient cohort\nfiles to conduct large-scale in silico trials through cardiac electromechanical\nsimulations. The pipeline generates the files describing meshes, labels, and\ndata required for the simulations directly from unprocessed surface meshes. We\napplied the pipeline to generate over 100 virtual patients from various\ndatasets and performed simulations to demonstrate capacity to conduct in silico\ntrials for virtual patients using verified and validated electrophysiology and\nelectromechanics models for the context of use. The proposed pipeline is\nadaptable to accommodate different types of ventricular geometries and mesh\nprocessing tools, ensuring its versatility in handling diverse clinical\ndatasets. By establishing an automated framework for large scale simulation\nstudies as required for in silico trials and providing open-source code, our\nwork aims to support scalable, personalised cardiac simulations in research and\nclinical applications.",

Continued pre-training on paraphrased data\nhas shown empirical promise for enhancing knowledge acquisition. However, this\napproach is often costly and unreliable, as it relies on external models or\nmanual effort for rewriting, and may inadvertently alter the factual content.\nIn this work, we hypothesize and empirically show that an LLM's ability to\ncontinually predict the same factual knowledge tokens given diverse paraphrased\ncontexts is positively correlated with its capacity to extract that knowledge\nvia question-answering. Based on this view and aiming to improve generalization\nto diverse paraphrased contexts, we introduce two strategies to enhance LLMs'\nability to predict the same knowledge tokens given varied contexts, thereby\nenhancing knowledge acquisition. First, we propose formatting-based data\naugmentation, which diversifies documents conveying the same knowledge by\naltering document formats rather than their content, thereby preserving factual\nintegrity. Second, we adopt sharpness-aware minimization as the optimizer to\nbetter improve generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate our methods'\neffectiveness in both continued pre-training and instruction tuning, and\nfurther gains can be achieved by combining with paraphrased data.",

Nonetheless,\nthese existing techniques rely on surface-level string matching, and thus they\nsuffer from the major limitation of not being able to handle orthographic\nvariations and paraphrasing -- notable and common phenomena in any natural\nlanguage. In addition, existing continuous approaches such as dense vector\nsearch tend to be overly coarse, often retrieving texts that are unrelated but\nshare similar topics.

We have\nprepared an efficient implementation, and we provide an accessible web tool.\nOur experiments demonstrate that the proposed method (i) can execute searches\non billion-scale corpora in less than a second, which is comparable in speed to\nsurface-level string matching and dense vector search; (ii) can extract harmful\ninstances that semantically match queries from a large set of English and\nJapanese Wikipedia articles; and (iii) can be effectively applied to\ncorpus-linguistic analyses of Latin, a language with highly diverse\ninflections.",

Despite\nhaving more than 85 million native speakers, Cantonese is still considered a\nlow-resource language in the field of natural language processing (NLP) due to\nfactors such as the dominance of Mandarin, lack of cohesion within the\nCantonese-speaking community, diversity in character encoding and input\nmethods, and the tendency of overseas Cantonese speakers to prefer using\nEnglish. In addition, rich colloquial vocabulary of Cantonese, English\nloanwords, and code-switching characteristics add to the complexity of corpus\ncollection and processing. To address these challenges, we collect Cantonese\ntexts from a variety of sources, including open source corpora, Hong\nKong-specific forums, Wikipedia, and Common Crawl data.

Despite understanding the production mechanism of these\nneutrinos, the lack of direct observations raises questions about particle\nacceleration efficiency and the involved astrophysical conditions. This study\nfocuses on neutrino emission from H-rich SNe with low-mass CSM, such as SN\n2023ixf. We developed a semi-analytical model to characterize the progenitor\nand CSM at the explosion time, allowing us to infer the expected neutrino flux\nat Earth during the SN's interaction phase. Our model shows that neutrino\nemission depends not only on shock velocity and CSM mass but also on the\nspatial matter distribution of the CSM.

    "abstract": "In the field of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), argumentative XAI\napproaches have been proposed to represent the internal reasoning process of\ndeep neural networks in a more transparent way by interpreting hidden nodes as\narguements. However, as the number of layers increases, existing compression\nmethods simplify all layers at once, which lead to high accumulative\ninformation loss. To compensate for this, we propose an iterative\nlayer-by-layer compression technique in which each layer is compressed\nseparately and the reduction error in the next layer is immediately compensated\nfor, thereby improving the overall input-output and structural fidelity of the\nmodel. Experiments on the Breast Cancer Diagnosis dataset show that, compared\nto traditional compression, the method reduces input-output and structural\nunfaithfulness, and maintains a more consistent attack-support relationship in\nthe Argumentative Explanation scheme. This is significant because it provides a\nnew way to make complex MLP models more compact while still conveying their\ninternal inference logic without distortion.",

Instead of relying on post-hoc methods, we present\n\\textbf{MoE-X}, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) language model designed to be\n\\emph{intrinsically} interpretable. Our approach is motivated by the\nobservation that, in language models, wider networks with sparse activations\nare more likely to capture interpretable factors. However, directly training\nsuch large sparse networks is computationally prohibitive. MoE architectures\noffer a scalable alternative by activating only a subset of experts for any\ngiven input, inherently aligning with interpretability objectives. In MoE-X, we\nestablish this connection by rewriting the MoE layer as an equivalent sparse,\nlarge MLP. This approach enables efficient scaling of the hidden size while\nmaintaining sparsity. To further enhance interpretability, we enforce sparse\nactivation within each expert and redesign the routing mechanism to prioritize\nexperts with the highest activation sparsity. These designs ensure that only\nthe most salient features are routed and processed by the experts. We evaluate\nMoE-X on chess and natural language tasks, showing that it achieves performance\ncomparable to dense models while significantly improving interpretability.\nMoE-X achieves a perplexity better than GPT-2, with interpretability surpassing\neven sparse autoencoder (SAE)-based approaches.",

Methane has a higher\nglobal warming potential (GWP) with respect to CO2, and methane emissions of\nhuman origin contribute about 23% to global warming. Emissions from livestock\nfarms play a non-negligible role, as a single cow is capable of emitting about\n110 kg of methane in a year. Several projects have tried to mitigate the\nproblem by intervening on animal feed: CH4rLiE, in contrast, proposes to act on\nthe methane already produced and diffused in the air, using a specially\ndeveloped recovery system. The idea arose from the expertise acquired in the\nLarge Hadron Collider experiments at CERN, where special gas recuperation\nsystems are being developed to extract CF4 from gaseous detectors' exhausted\ngas mixture. The project focuses on the study of gas adsorption by porous\nmaterials and on the development of a prototype system for methane capture,\nwhich will be installed in a real barn. This study is being supported by an\ninitial phase of gas diffusion simulations and by a campaign of measurements of\ngas concentrations in different barn areas. CH4rLiE will also provide an\nopportunity to explore, for the first time, the feasibility of methane recovery\nfrom the farm environment without affecting the animals' feeding or living\nconditions. The social benefits are extremely interesting both in terms of\ndeveloping and implementing low-impact farming production processes, but also\nin terms of recycling expensive or environmentally unfriendly gasses.",

This study examines whether multimodal generative AI systems\ncan reproduce this valence-dominance structure when evaluating facial images\nand how their representations align with those observed across world regions.\nThrough principal component analysis (PCA), we found that the extracted\ndimensions closely mirrored the theoretical structure of valence and dominance,\nwith trait loadings aligning with established definitions. However, many world\nregions and generative AI models also exhibited a third component, the nature\nand significance of which warrant further investigation.

Existing\nmethods predominantly rely on 3D bounding boxes and BEV road maps for\nforeground and background control, which fail to capture the full complexity of\ndriving scenes and adequately integrate multimodal information. In this work,\nwe present DualDiff, a dual-branch conditional diffusion model designed to\nenhance driving scene generation across multiple views and video sequences.\nSpecifically, we introduce Occupancy Ray-shape Sampling (ORS) as a conditional\ninput, offering rich foreground and background semantics alongside 3D spatial\ngeometry to precisely control the generation of both elements. To improve the\nsynthesis of fine-grained foreground objects, particularly complex and distant\nones, we propose a Foreground-Aware Mask (FGM) denoising loss function.\nAdditionally, we develop the Semantic Fusion Attention (SFA) mechanism to\ndynamically prioritize relevant information and suppress noise, enabling more\neffective multimodal fusion. Finally, to ensure high-quality image-to-video\ngeneration, we introduce the Reward-Guided Diffusion (RGD) framework, which\nmaintains global consistency and semantic coherence in generated videos.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that DualDiff achieves state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) performance across multiple datasets.

We characterize its deformations and show\nthat its complex shape changes can be a passive consequence of the deformations\nof the active regions of the embryo that surround it. First, we find an\nintermediate characteristic triangular shape in the 3D deformations of the\nhindgut. We construct a minimal model of the hindgut primordium as an elastic\nring deformed by active midgut invagination and germ band extension on an\nellipsoidal surface, which robustly captures the symmetry-breaking into this\ntriangular shape. We then quantify the 3D kinematics of the tissue by a set of\ncontours and discover that the hindgut deforms in two stages: an initial\ntranslation on the curved embryo surface followed by a rapid breaking of shape\nsymmetry. We extend our model to show that the contour kinematics in both\nstages are consistent with our passive picture. Our results suggest that the\nrole of in-plane deformations during hindgut morphogenesis is to translate the\ntissue to a region with anisotropic embryonic curvature and show that uniform\nboundary conditions are sufficient to generate the observed nonuniform shape\nchange. Our work thus provides a possible explanation for the various\ncharacteristic shapes of blastopore-equivalents in different organisms and a\nframework for the mechanical emergence of global morphologies in complex\ndevelopmental systems.",

We present a joint maximum a posteriori framework that\nsimultaneously reconstructs multiple distortion fields while explicitly\naccounting for their mutual contamination. For cosmic birefringence searches,\nour method achieves up to 2.5 improvement in reconstruction noise compared to\nthe QE, while significantly reducing CMB lensing-induced biases up to a factor\nof 5. These gains in lensing biases manifest not only in deep polarization\nsurveys like CMB-S4 and SPT-3G, but also in higher-noise experiments like\nSimons Observatory, where our method reduces lensing-induced biases by a factor\nof two thanks to the power of delensing.

    "abstract": "The concept of vowel tenseness has traditionally been examined through the\nbinary distinction of tense and lax vowels.

Building on these foundations, Ishizaki (2019,\n2022) proposed an indirect quantification of vowel tenseness using formant\nangles {\\theta}1 and {\\theta}F1 and their first and second derivatives,\ndZ1(t)/dt = lim tan {\\theta}1(t) and d2Z1(t)/dt2 = d/dt lim tan {\\theta}1(t).\nThis study extends this approach by investigating the potential role of a\nforce-related parameter in determining vowel quality. Specifically, we\nintroduce a simplified model based on the Lagrangian equation to describe the\ndynamic interaction of the tongue and jaw within the oral cavity during the\narticulation of close vowels. This model provides a theoretical framework for\nestimating the forces involved in vowel production across different languages,\noffering new insights into the physical mechanisms underlying vowel\narticulation.

    "abstract": "Prominences are cool overdensities of plasma supported by magnetic fields\nthat levitate in the solar corona. The physical characterization of these\nstructures is key for understanding the magnetic field in the corona. Our work\nattempts to shed light on the properties of prominences by using observations\nat high polarimetric sensitivity in the He I D3 multiplet taken with the Zurich\nImaging Polarimeter-3 instrument at the Istituto ricerche solari Aldo e Cele\nDacco observatory. We used the HAZEL inversion code to infer the thermodynamic\nand magnetic properties of an active region prominence, assuming one- and\ntwo-component models. Our observations unveil a great diversity of physical\nconditions in the prominence. The observed Stokes profiles are usually broad\nand show interesting features, which can be described assuming a two-component\nmodel. The contribution of each component and the trends inferred for some\nparameters vary with the distance to the solar limb. While both components have\nanalogous properties and contribute similarly close to the limb, a major\ncomponent mainly describes the properties inferred at 10-40 arcsecs away from\nthe limb. Moreover, both components usually show significant differences in\nthermal broadening, which is essential for ensuring a good fit quality between\nobservations and synthetic profiles. Summarizing, the observed region of the\nprominence shows line-of-sight velocities of 1-3 km/s and rather horizontal\nfields of 20-80 gauss. We also report hints of a twist close to a prominence\nfoot and changes in the magnetic configuration at specific locations. Our\nresults indicate a mainly horizontal magnetic field of a few tens of gauss in\nthe prominence. A model of two components with different thermal broadenings\nand filling factors, depending on the limb distance, is crucial for providing a\nconsistent solution across most of the observed prominence.",

While LLMs demonstrate\nremarkable capabilities across diverse tasks, they often fail to maintain\nadherence to complex, use-case-specific instructions during multi-turn\nconversations, presenting challenges for business-critical applications. ARQs\naddress this limitation by guiding LLMs through systematic reasoning steps with\ntargeted queries that reinstate critical instructions and facilitate\nintermediate reasoning throughout the completion process. In extensive testing\nwithin Parlant, our framework for reliable customer-facing agents in which ARQs\nwere born out of necessity, they achieved a 90.2% success rate across 87 test\nscenarios, outperforming both Chain-of-Thought reasoning (86.1%) and direct\nresponse generation (81.5%). ARQs showed particular strength in addressing\npersistent failure modes like guideline re-application and hallucination\nprevention.

However, existing research lacks comprehensive\ndatasets that capture the full range of pedestrian behaviors, e.g., including\navoidance, neutrality, and attraction in the presence of robots. Such datasets\ncan be used to effectively learn models capable of accurately predicting\ndiverse responses of pedestrians to robot presence, which are crucial for\nadvancing robot navigation strategies and optimizing pedestrian-aware motion\nplanning. In this paper, we address these challenges by collecting a novel\ndataset of pedestrian motion in two outdoor locations under three distinct\nconditions, i.e., no robot presence, a stationary robot, and a moving robot.\nThus, unlike existing datasets, ours explicitly encapsulates variations in\npedestrian behavior across the different robot conditions. Using our dataset,\nwe propose a novel Neural Social Robot Force Model (NSRFM), an extension of the\ntraditional Social Force Model that integrates neural networks and\nrobot-induced forces to better predict pedestrian behavior in the presence of\nrobots. We validate the NSRFM by comparing its generated trajectories on\ndifferent real-world datasets.

The fraction of particles in the force chains network is\nused to quantify the presence of the force chains.\n  The findings show that particle size disparity promotes force chain formation\nin granular media with nearly-regular packing (i.e., an almost-ordered system).\nHowever, as particle size disparities grow, it promotes irregular packing\n(i.e., a disordered systems), leading to fewer force chains carrying larger\nloads than in ordered systems.

By leveraging state-of-the-art\ngenerative models like Stable Diffusion, the methodology translates natural\nlanguage inputs into detailed 3D models through a multi-stage workflow.\n  The reconstruction process begins with the generation of high-quality images\nfrom textual prompts, followed by enhancement by a reinforcement learning agent\nand reflection removal using the Stable Delight model.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a novel model to characterize individual tendencies\nin repeated decision-making scenarios, with the goal of designing model-based\ncontrol strategies that promote virtuous choices amidst social and external\ninfluences. Our approach builds on the classical Friedkin and Johnsen model of\nsocial influence, extending it to include random factors (e.g., inherent\nvariability in individual needs) and controllable external inputs. We\nexplicitly account for the temporal separation between two processes that shape\nopinion dynamics: individual decision-making and social imitation. While\nindividual decisions occur at regular, frequent intervals, the influence of\nsocial imitation unfolds over longer periods. The inclusion of random factors\nnaturally leads to dynamics that do not converge in the classical sense.\nHowever, under specific conditions, we prove that opinions exhibit ergodic\nbehavior. Building on this result, we propose a constrained asymptotic optimal\ncontrol problem designed to foster, on average, social acceptance of a target\naction within a network. To address the transient dynamics of opinions, we\nreformulate this problem within a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework.\nSimulations highlight the significance of accounting for these transient\neffects in steering individuals toward virtuous choices while managing policy\ncosts.",

In this work, we attempt to overcome\nthis shortcoming through (1) a novel synthetic data generation pipeline and (2)\na robust model adaptation algorithm. Starting with seed code examples and\ndiverse editing criteria, our pipeline generates high-quality samples\ncomprising original and modified code, along with natural language instructions\nin different styles and verbosity. Today's code LMs come bundled with strong\nabilities, such as code generation and instruction following, which should not\nbe lost due to fine-tuning. To ensure this, we propose a novel adaptation\nalgorithm, SeleKT, that (a) leverages a dense gradient-based step to identify\nthe weights that are most important for code editing, and (b) does a sparse\nprojection onto the base model to avoid overfitting. Using our approach, we\nobtain a new series of models NextCoder (adapted from QwenCoder-2.5) that\nachieves strong results on five code-editing benchmarks, outperforming\ncomparable size models and even several larger ones. We show the generality of\nour approach on two model families (DeepSeekCoder and QwenCoder), compare\nagainst other fine-tuning approaches, and demonstrate robustness by showing\nretention of code generation and general problem-solving abilities post\nadaptation.

Despite its promise, effective ICL in the multimodal setting\nremains challenging due to the inherent complexity of image-text inputs and the\nhigh sensitivity of ICL performance to input configurations. In this work, we\nshed light on the core mechanism underlying multimodal ICL, identifying task\nmapping as a crucial factor in configuring robust in-context demonstration\n(ICD) sequences. Building on these insights, we propose \\textit{SabER}, a\nlightweight yet powerful decoder-only transformer equipped with task-aware\nattention, which intelligently selects and arranges ICDs from a demonstration\nlibrary in an autoregressive fashion. This design enables fine-grained feature\nextraction and cross-modal reasoning, iteratively refining task mapping to\ngenerate high-quality ICD sequences.

The\ndataset, the SHQ-NPOV dataset, comprises 300 high-quality, human-written\nquadruplets: a query on a sensitive topic, an answer, an NPOV rating, and a set\nof links to source texts elaborating the various points of view. The first key\ncontribution of this paper is a new methodology to create such datasets through\niterative rounds of human peer-critique and annotator training, which we\nrelease alongside the dataset. The second key contribution is the\nidentification of a highly effective training regime for parameter-efficient\nreinforcement learning (PE-RL) to improve NPOV generation. We compare and\nextensively evaluate PE-RL and multiple baselines-including LoRA finetuning (a\nstrong baseline), SFT and RLHF.\n  PE-RL not only improves on overall NPOV quality compared to the strongest\nbaseline ($97.06\\%\\rightarrow 99.08\\%$), but also scores much higher on\nfeatures linguists identify as key to separating good answers from the best\nanswers ($60.25\\%\\rightarrow 85.21\\%$ for presence of supportive details,\n$68.74\\%\\rightarrow 91.43\\%$ for absence of oversimplification). A qualitative\nanalysis corroborates this. Finally, our evaluation finds no statistical\ndifferences between results on topics that appear in the training dataset and\nthose on separated evaluation topics, which provides strong evidence that our\napproach to training PE-RL exhibits very effective out of topic generalization.",

However, adapting to some complex\ndomains remains challenging, especially when these domains require substantial\npaired data to capture the targeted distributions. Since unpaired data from a\nsingle modality, such as vision or language, is more readily available, we\nutilize the bidirectional mappings between vision and language learned by the\nunified generative model to enable training on unpaired data for domain\nadaptation. Specifically, we propose DoraCycle, which integrates two multimodal\ncycles: text-to-image-to-text and image-to-text-to-image. The model is\noptimized through cross-entropy loss computed at the cycle endpoints, where\nboth endpoints share the same modality. This facilitates self-evolution of the\nmodel without reliance on annotated text-image pairs. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that for tasks independent of paired knowledge, such as\nstylization, DoraCycle can effectively adapt the unified model using only\nunpaired data. For tasks involving new paired knowledge, such as specific\nidentities, a combination of a small set of paired image-text examples and\nlarger-scale unpaired data is sufficient for effective domain-oriented\nadaptation.

    "abstract": "TSP is a classic and extensively studied problem with numerous real-world\napplications in artificial intelligence and operations research. It is\nwell-known that TSP admits a constant approximation ratio on metric graphs but\nbecomes NP-hard to approximate within any computable function $f(n)$ on general\ngraphs. This disparity highlights a significant gap between the results on\nmetric graphs and general graphs. Recent research has introduced some\nparameters to measure the ``distance'' of general graphs from being metric and\nexplored FPT approximation algorithms parameterized by these parameters. Two\ncommonly studied parameters are $p$, the number of vertices in triangles\nviolating the triangle inequality, and $q$, the minimum number of vertices\nwhose removal results in a metric graph. In this paper, we present improved FPT\napproximation algorithms with respect to these two parameters. For $p$, we\npropose an FPT algorithm with a 1.5-approximation ratio, improving upon the\nprevious ratio of 2.5. For $q$, we significantly enhance the approximation\nratio from 11 to 3, advancing the state of the art in both cases.",

To\nbetter utilize the spatial information inherent in 4D radar data, recent deep\nlearning methods have transitioned from using sparse point cloud to 4D radar\ntensors. However, the scarcity of publicly available 4D radar tensor datasets\nlimits model generalization across diverse driving scenarios. Previous methods\naddressed this by synthesizing radar data, but the outputs did not fully\nexploit the spatial information characteristic of 4D radar. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose LiDAR-to-4D radar data synthesis (L2RDaS), a framework\nthat synthesizes spatially informative 4D radar tensors from LiDAR data\navailable in existing autonomous driving datasets. L2RDaS integrates a modified\nU-Net architecture to effectively capture spatial information and an object\ninformation supplement (OBIS) module to enhance reflection fidelity. This\nframework enables the synthesis of radar tensors across diverse driving\nscenarios without additional sensor deployment or data collection. L2RDaS\nimproves model generalization by expanding real datasets with synthetic radar\ntensors, achieving an average increase of 4.25\\% in ${{AP}_{BEV}}$ and 2.87\\%\nin ${{AP}_{3D}}$ across three detection models.

By compiling an updated X-ray HFQPO catalog, we found\nthat the ultraluminous X-ray sources support the HFQPO models, similar to black\nhole X-ray binaries. More importantly, we identified two supermassive black\nhole (SMBH) sources (Sgr A and NGC 1365) with possible advection-dominated\naccretion flow (ADAF) configurations that support existing HFQPO models, even\nthough many AGNs still do not.

    "abstract": "In this thesis, we study concepts in quantum computing using graphical\nlanguages, specifically using the ZX-calculus. The core of the research\nrevolves around (graphical) stabilizer decompositions. The first major focus is\non the decomposition of non-stabilizer states created from star edges. We\ndiscuss previous results and then present novel decompositions that yield a\ntheoretical improvement. The second major focus is on weighting algorithms,\napplied to the special class of multi-control Toffoli gate dense quantum\ncircuits. The representation of the corresponding gates is based on star edges.\nThe applicability of known methods, such as CNOT-grouping, traditionally used\nfor other classes, is examined in the context of this specific class. We then\npresent a novel weighting algorithm that attempts to determine the best vertex\nto decompose. A refined version is implemented to simulate a known class of\nquantum querying algorithms, which is used to search for causal configurations\nof multiloop Feynman diagrams. For this case, as well as for a generalized\nbenchmark consisting of randomly generated quantum circuits, we demonstrate\noccasional improvements in the final number of terms against traditional\nmethods. These results are discussed by considering different simplification\nstrategies. This thesis also provides a brief but broad outline of the\nimportant preliminaries.",

For CPU\nefficiency, we set a time limit for MAiNGO, taking the best point as optimal.\nWe perform repeated numerical experiments, initially using the Muller-Brown\npotential as a benchmark function, utilizing the lower confidence bound\nacquisition function; we further validate our findings with three alternative\nbenchmark functions. Statistical analysis reveals that when the acquisition\nfunction is more exploitative (as opposed to exploratory), BO with MAiNGO\nconverges in fewer iterations than with the local solvers.

Surface\nadditivation of the feedstock powder with Ag nanoparticles (NPs) is a concept\nthat has been shown to increase the coercivity of PBF-LB/M-produced Nd-Fe-B\nmagnets. Using atom probe tomography (APT) and transmission electron microscopy\n(TEM), we reveal that Ag nano-additivation promotes heterogeneous nucleation of\nthe Nd2Fe14B phase, leading to refined, equiaxed grains and increased stability\nof the Ti-Zr-B-rich intergranular phase. The intrinsic heat treatment,\ninfluenced by layer-wise processing, further affects the distribution of\nAg-rich regions, impacting grain growth and intergranular phase composition\nacross different regions of the melt pool. Compared to the unadditivated\nsample, the Ag-additivated sample exhibits a significantly finer grain\nstructure and a changed intergranular phase, which contribute to enhanced\ndomain wall pinning and coercivity. These microstructural changes directly\nmodify the magnetic domain structure, as evidenced by Lorentz transmission\nelectron microscopy (TEM).

To fully exploit this flexibility in modern wireless\ncommunication systems, this paper considers a novel tri-hybrid beamforming\narchitecture, which seamlessly integrates pattern-reconfigurable antennas with\nboth analog and digital beamforming. The proposed tri-hybrid architecture\noperates across three layers: (\\textit{i}) a radiation beamformer in the\nelectromagnetic (EM) domain for dynamic pattern alignment, (\\textit{ii}) an\nanalog beamformer in the radio-frequency (RF) domain for array gain\nenhancement, and (\\textit{iii}) a digital beamformer in the baseband (BB)\ndomain for multi-user interference mitigation. To establish a solid theoretical\nfoundation, we first develop a comprehensive mathematical model for the\ntri-hybrid beamforming system and formulate the signal model for a multi-user\nmulti-input single-output (MU-MISO) scenario. The optimization objective is to\nmaximize the sum-rate while satisfying practical constraints. Given the\nchallenges posed by high pilot overhead and computational complexity, we\nintroduce an innovative tri-timescale beamforming framework, wherein the\nradiation beamformer is optimized over a long-timescale, the analog beamformer\nover a medium-timescale, and the digital beamformer over a short-timescale.\nThis hierarchical strategy effectively balances performance and implementation\nfeasibility.

However, running asynchronous ideation faces a\npractical constraint. Whereas trained human facilitators are needed to guide\neffective idea exchange, they cannot be continuously available to engage with\nindividuals joining at varying hours. In this paper, we ask how chatbots can be\ndesigned to facilitate asynchronous ideation. For this, we adopted the\nguidelines found in the literature about human facilitators and designed two\nchatbots: one provides a structured ideation process, and another adapts the\nideation process to individuals' ideation performance. We invited 48\nparticipants to generate and select ideas by interacting with one of our\nchatbots and invited an expert facilitator to review our chatbots. We found\nthat both chatbots can guide users to build on each other's ideas and converge\nthem into a few satisfying ideas. However, we also found the chatbots'\nlimitations in social interaction with collaborators, which only human\nfacilitators can provide. Accordingly, we conclude that chatbots can be\npromising facilitators of asynchronous ideation, but hybrid facilitation with\nhuman facilitators would be needed to address the social aspects of\ncollaborative ideation.",

In\nthe SEI, the solvation environments in the compact electrical double layer\n(EDL) next to the electrode, also known as the Helmholtz layer, determine\n(partially) what species can react to form the SEI, with bulk solvation\nenvironments often being used as a proxy. Here we develop and test a theory of\ncation solvation in the Helmholtz layer of non-aqueous Li-ion battery\nelectrolytes. First, we validate the theory against bulk and diffuse EDL\natomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of LiPF$_6$ EC/EMC mixtures as a\nfunction of surface charge, where we find the theory can capture the solvation\nenvironments well. Next we turn to the Helmholtz layer, where we find that the\nmain effect of the solvation structures next to the electrode is an apparent\nreduction in the number of binding sites between Li$^+$ and the solvents, again\nwhere we find good agreement with our developed theory. Finally, by solving a\nsimplified version of the theory, we find that the probability of Li$^+$\nbinding to each solvent remains equal to the bulk probability, suggesting that\nthe bulk solvation environments are a reasonable place to start when\nunderstanding new battery electrolytes.

    "abstract": "Accretion from protoplanetary or debris disks can contaminate the stellar\nphotosphere, which is detectable in stars with radiative envelopes due to\nrelatively slower photospheric mixing. The contaminated photosphere reflects\nongoing disk processes, detectable through stellar spectroscopy. We investigate\nthe composition of six gas-rich debris disk-hosting A-type stars to understand\npossible links with their debris disk or earlier accretion stages. We used\narchival spectra to estimate the stellar parameters and abundances of our\nsample. We also estimated the stellar photospheric accretion contamination\nparameter, fph which indicates the fraction of accreting material on the\nstellar photosphere. The oxygen abundance in intermediate-mass stars decreases\nwith age until the debris disk stage (< 20 Myr). The downward trend could\nresult from H2O ice accumulating in dust traps or the formation of hydrated\nasteroids in the protoplanetary disk, locking oxygen in solids and reducing its\naccretion onto the star. All stars have similar volatile abundances (C, O), but\nHD 110058 and HD 32297 show refractory depleted abundances. The near-zero fph\nvalues in the six stars suggest that any currently accreted gas would not\noverwhelm mixing in the photosphere and would not impact the observed\ncomposition. The refractory depleted abundances in HD 110058 and HD 32297\nsuggest residual, or even chronic, accretion contamination from their earlier\nprotoplanetary stages when the accretion rates were about five orders of\nmagnitude higher. For HD 110058, with the highest refractory depletion, we\nestimated a lower limit on its earlier protoplanetary accretion rate of 9 x\n10^(-8) Msun/yr, similar to other Herbig stars and equal to the Herbig star -\nHD 100546. This supports our hypothesis that refractory depletion in HD 110058\noriginates from a prior phase of higher accretion of dust-poor material.",

    "abstract": "Despite its prevalent use in image-text matching tasks in a zero-shot manner,\nCLIP has been shown to be highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations added\nonto images. Recent studies propose to finetune the vision encoder of CLIP with\nadversarial samples generated on the fly, and show improved robustness against\nadversarial attacks on a spectrum of downstream datasets, a property termed as\nzero-shot robustness. In this paper, we show that malicious perturbations that\nseek to maximise the classification loss lead to `falsely stable' images, and\npropose to leverage the pre-trained vision encoder of CLIP to counterattack\nsuch adversarial images during inference to achieve robustness. Our paradigm is\nsimple and training-free, providing the first method to defend CLIP from\nadversarial attacks at test time, which is orthogonal to existing methods\naiming to boost zero-shot adversarial robustness of CLIP. We conduct\nexperiments across 16 classification datasets, and demonstrate stable and\nconsistent gains compared to test-time defence methods adapted from existing\nadversarial robustness studies that do not rely on external networks, without\nnoticeably impairing performance on clean images. We also show that our\nparadigm can be employed on CLIP models that have been adversarially finetuned\nto further enhance their robustness at test time.

More than 20\nyears ago Loet Leydesdorff and myself designed a programme for future\ninnovation studies 'Measuring the knowledge base - a programme of innovation\nstudies'. Although, the funding programme we envisioned eventually did not\nmaterialise, the proposal text set out the main lines of our research\ncollaboration over the coming decades. This paper revisits main statements of\nthis programme and discusses their remaining validity in the light of more\nrecent research. Core to the Leydesdorff and Scharnhorst text was a\nsystem-theoretical, evolutionary perspective on science dynamics, newly\nemerging structures and phenomena and addressed the question to which extent\nthey could be meaningful studied using quantitative approaches. This paper\nlooks into three cases - all examples of newly emerging institutional\nstructures and related practices in science. They are all located at the\ninterface between research and research infrastructures. While discussing how\nthe programmatic ideas written up at the beginning of the 2000s still informs\nmeasurement attempts in those three cases, the paper also touches upon\nquestions of epistemological foundations of quantitative studies in general.\nThe main conclusion is that combining measurement experiments with\nphilosophical reflection remains important.",

Due\nto the implicit nature of architectural knowledge in code implementation,\ndevelopers may risk inadvertently altering or removing these tactics during\ncode modifications or optimizations. Such unintended changes can trigger\narchitectural erosion, gradually undermining the system's original design.\nWhile many researchers have proposed machine learning-based methods to improve\nthe accuracy of detecting ATs in code, the black-box nature and the required\narchitectural domain knowledge pose significant challenges for developers in\nverifying the results. Effective verification requires not only accurate\ndetection results but also interpretable explanations that enhance their\ncomprehensibility. However, this is a critical gap in current research. Large\nlanguage models (LLMs) can generate easily interpretable ATs detection comments\nif they have domain knowledge. Fine-tuning LLMs to acquire domain knowledge\nfaces challenges such as catastrophic forgetting and hardware constraints.\nThus, we propose Prmt4TD, a small model-augmented prompting framework to\nenhance the accuracy and comprehensibility of ATs detection. Combining\nfine-tuned small models with In-Context Learning can also reduce fine-tuning\ncosts while equipping the LLM with additional domain knowledge. Prmt4TD can\nleverage the remarkable processing and reasoning capabilities of LLMs to\ngenerate easily interpretable ATs detection results.

These devices are also presently entering\nthe commercial industry. However, nearly all demonstrations and existing\nproducts require bulky external microwave components for interconnection and\napplication of requisite biases. These components -- cabling interconnects,\nbias tees, directional couplers, and diplexers -- increase the overall\namplifier footprint, installation complexity, and reduce already limited\navailable cryogenic volumes. Additionally, these components introduce loss and\nreflections which impact the measurement efficiency and readout system noise\nperformance; thus making it more difficult to operate near the quantum limit.\n  Here we present the design and validation of microfabricated bias tees and\ndirectional couplers for operating three-wave mixing kinetic inductance TWPAs\n(KITs).

This distinct mathematical structure\nleads to fundamental differences in quantum information processing, such as an\nexponentially greater complexity of state tomography [MMB+24] or a factoring\nalgorithm in constant space [BCCRK24]. Yet, it remains unclear whether this\nstructural difference of bosonic systems may also translate to a practical\ncomputational advantage over finite-dimensional quantum computers. Here we take\na step towards answering this question by showing that universal bosonic\nquantum computations can be simulated in polynomial space (and exponential\ntime) on a classical computer, significantly improving the best previous upper\nbound requiring exponential memory [CJMM24]. In complexity-theoretic terms, we\nimprove the best upper bound on $\\textsf{CVBQP}$ from $ \\textsf{EXPSPACE}$ to\n$\\textsf{PSPACE}$. This result is achieved using a simulation strategy based on\nfinite energy cutoffs and approximate coherent state decompositions. While we\npropose ways to potentially refine this bound, we also present arguments\nsupporting the plausibility of an exponential computational advantage of\nbosonic quantum computers over their discrete-variable counterparts.\nFurthermore, we emphasize the role of circuit energy as a resource and discuss\nwhy it may act as the fundamental bottleneck in realizing this advantage in\npractical implementations.",

Existing LLM-based approaches typically suffer\nfrom three critical limitations: Inefficient parameter utilization in handling\nnumerical time series patterns; Modality misalignment between continuous\ntemporal signals and discrete text embeddings; and Inflexibility for real-time\nexpert knowledge integration. We present SMETimes, the first systematic\ninvestigation of sub-3B parameter SLMs for efficient and accurate time series\nforecasting.

    "abstract": "We study the impact of noise on the dynamics of entanglement in the\ntransverse-field Ising chain, with the field quenched linearly across one or\nboth of the quantum critical points of the model. Taking concurrence as a\nmeasure of entanglement, we find that a quench generates entanglement between\nnearest- and next-nearest-neighbor spins, with noise reducing the amount of\nentanglement. Focusing on the next-nearest-neighbor concurrence, known to\nexhibit Kibble-Zurek scaling with the square root of the quench rate in the\nnoiseless case, we find a different result when noise is present: The\nconcurrence now scales logarithmically with the quench rate, with a\nnoise-dependent amplitude. This is also different from the ``anti-Kibble-Zurek\"\nscaling of defect density with quench rate when noise is present, suggesting\nthat noisy entanglement generation is largely independent from the rate of\ndefect formation. Intriguingly, the critical time scale beyond which no\nentanglement is produced by a noisy quench scales as a power law with the\nstrength of noise, with the same exponent as that which governs the optimal\nquench time for which defect formation is at a minimum in a standard quantum\nannealing scheme.",

    "abstract": "Standard detection of entanglement relies on local measurements of the\nindividual particles, evaluating their correlations in post-processing. For\ntime-energy entangled photons, either times $(t_{1},t_{2})$ or energies\n$(E_{1},E_{2})$ are measured, but not both due to the mutual quantum\nuncertainty, providing only partial information of the entanglement. In\nprinciple, a global detector could recover the complete information of\nentanglement in a single shot if it could measure the combined correlated\nvariables $(t_{1}-t_{2})$ and $(E_{1}+E_{2})$ without measuring the individual\nenergies or times. Such a global measurement is possible using the reverse\ndisentangling interaction, like sum-frequency generation (SFG), but nonlinear\ninteractions at the single-photon level are exceedingly inefficient. We\novercome this barrier by stimulating the nonlinear SFG interaction with a\nstrong pump, thereby measuring both the energy-sum (SFG spectrum) and the\ntime-difference (response to group delay/dispersion) simultaneously and\nefficiently. We generate bi-photons with extreme time-energy entanglement\n(octave-spanning spectrum of 113THz) and measure a relative uncertainty between\ntime-difference and energy-sum of\n$\\Delta(t_1-t_2)\\Delta(E_1+E_2)\\approx\\!2\\!\\cdot\\!10^{-13}h$, violating the\nclassical bound by more than 12 orders of magnitude. The presented coherent SFG\ndramatically enhances the detection SNR compared to standard methods since it\nideally rejects erroneous coincidences in both time and energy, paving the way\nfor sensing applications, such as quantum illumination (radar) and more.",

    "abstract": "The adoption of crowdsourced election monitoring as a complementary\nalternative to traditional election monitoring is on the rise. Yet, its\nreliance on digital response volunteers to manually process incoming election\nreports poses a significant scaling bottleneck. In this paper, we address the\nchallenge of scaling crowdsourced election monitoring by advancing the task of\nautomated classification of crowdsourced election reports to multilingual and\ncross-domain classification settings. We propose a two-step classification\napproach of first identifying informative reports and then categorising them\ninto distinct information types. We conduct classification experiments using\nmultilingual transformer models such as XLM-RoBERTa and multilingual embeddings\nsuch as SBERT, augmented with linguistically motivated features. Our approach\nachieves F1-Scores of 77\\% for informativeness detection and 75\\% for\ninformation type classification. We conduct cross-domain experiments, applying\nmodels trained in a source electoral domain to a new target electoral domain in\nzero-shot and few-shot classification settings. Our results show promising\npotential for model transfer across electoral domains, with F1-Scores of 59\\%\nin zero-shot and 63\\% in few-shot settings. However, our analysis also reveals\na performance bias in detecting informative English reports over Swahili,\nlikely due to imbalances in the training data, indicating a need for caution\nwhen deploying classification models in real-world election scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Traditional XR and Metaverse applications prioritize user experience (UX) for\nadoption and success but often overlook a crucial aspect of user interaction:\nemotions. This article addresses this gap by presenting an emotion-aware\nMetaverse application: a Virtual Reality (VR) fire drill simulator designed to\nprepare crews for shipboard emergencies. The simulator detects emotions in real\ntime, assessing trainees responses under stress to improve learning outcomes.\nIts architecture incorporates eye-tracking and facial expression analysis via\nMeta Quest Pro headsets. The system features four levels whose difficulty is\nincreased progressively to evaluate user decision-making and emotional\nresilience. The system was evaluated in two experimental phases. The first\nphase identified challenges, such as navigation issues and lack of visual\nguidance. These insights led to an improved second version with a better user\ninterface, visual cues and a real-time task tracker. Performance metrics like\ncompletion times, task efficiency and emotional responses were analyzed. The\nobtained results show that trainees with prior VR or gaming experience\nnavigated the scenarios more efficiently. Moreover, the addition of\ntask-tracking visuals and navigation guidance significantly improved user\nperformance, reducing task completion times between 14.18\\% and 32.72\\%.\nEmotional responses were captured, revealing that some participants were\nengaged, while others acted indifferently, indicating the need for more\nimmersive elements. Overall, this article provides useful guidelines for\ncreating the next generation of emotion-aware Metaverse applications.",

A detailed abundance\nanalysis was conducted on the nearinfrared spectra from APOGEE-2 DR17,\nencompassing 13 elements. Subsequently, a similar analysis was performed on the\noptical UVES spectra of four P-rich stars, resulting in the abundance\ndetermination of 48 light and heavy elements. This comprehensive analysis\nfurther refined the chemical fingerprint of these peculiar stars, which was\nemployed to evaluate the plausibility of various nucleosynthetic formation\nscenarios. In order to obtain a statistically more reliable chemical\nfingerprint in the future, we explored the use of unsupervised machine learning\nalgorithms to identify additional P-rich stars in extensive spectroscopic\nsurveys, such as APOGEE-2. The primary objective of this research is to\nidentify the progenitor of these stars and determine whether current\nnucleosynthetic models require revision or if a completely new source of P in\nthe Galaxy is responsible for the existence of the P-rich stars.",

    "abstract": "The use of narratives as a means of fusing information from knowledge graphs\n(KGs) into a coherent line of argumentation has been the subject of recent\ninvestigation. Narratives are especially useful in event-centric knowledge\ngraphs in that they provide a means to connect different real-world events and\ncategorize them by well-known narrations. However, specifically for\ncontroversial events, a problem in information fusion arises, namely, multiple\nviewpoints regarding the validity of certain event aspects, e.g., regarding the\nrole a participant takes in an event, may exist. Expressing those viewpoints in\nKGs is challenging because disputed information provided by different\nviewpoints may introduce inconsistencies. Hence, most KGs only feature a single\nview on the contained information, hampering the effectiveness of narrative\ninformation access. This paper is an extension of our original work and\nintroduces attributions, i.e., parameterized predicates that allow for the\nrepresentation of facts that are only valid in a specific viewpoint. For this,\nwe develop a conceptual model that allows for the representation of\nviewpoint-dependent information. As an extension, we enhance the model by a\nconception of viewpoint-compatibility. Based on this, we deepen our original\ndeliberations on the model's effects on information fusion and provide\nadditional grounding in the literature.",

    "abstract": "Robot manipulation is a common task in fields like industrial manufacturing.\nDetecting when objects slip from a robot's grasp is crucial for safe and\nreliable operation. Event cameras, which register pixel-level brightness\nchanges at high temporal resolution (called ``events''), offer an elegant\nfeature when mounted on a robot's end effector: since they only detect motion\nrelative to their viewpoint, a properly grasped object produces no events,\nwhile a slipping object immediately triggers them. To research this feature,\nrepresentative datasets are essential, both for analytic approaches and for\ntraining machine learning models. The majority of current research on slip\ndetection with event-based data is done on real-world scenarios and manual data\ncollection, as well as additional setups for data labeling. This can result in\na significant increase in the time required for data collection, a lack of\nflexibility in scene setups, and a high level of complexity in the repetition\nof experiments. This paper presents a simulation pipeline for generating slip\ndata using the described camera-gripper configuration in a robot arm, and\ndemonstrates its effectiveness through initial data-driven experiments. The use\nof a simulator, once it is set up, has the potential to reduce the time spent\non data collection, provide the ability to alter the setup at any time,\nsimplify the process of repetition and the generation of arbitrarily large data\nsets. Two distinct datasets were created and validated through visual\ninspection and artificial neural networks (ANNs). Visual inspection confirmed\nphotorealistic frame generation and accurate slip modeling, while three ANNs\ntrained on this data achieved high validation accuracy and demonstrated good\ngeneralization capabilities on a separate test set, along with initial\napplicability to real-world data.

To further enhance verification performance, we introduce a Textural\nExpert Interaction Module that dynamically routes textural features among\nexperts to generate refined side textural features. Learnable parameters are\nemployed to model relationships between original and side features, fostering\ncross-texture-expert interaction and improving feature discrimination.\nExtensive experiments validate the effectiveness of FedPalm, demonstrating\nrobust performance across both scenarios and providing a promising foundation\nfor advancing FL-based palmprint verification research.",

We focus on a general beamforming structure with both\ncommunication beams and dedicated sensing beams, whose design is highly\nnon-trivial as more sensing beams provide more flexibility in sensing, but\nintroduce extra interference to communication. To resolve this trade-off, we\nfirst characterize the periodic posterior Cram\\'er-Rao bound (PCRB) as a lower\nbound of the mean-cyclic error (MCE) in multi-target sensing. Then, we optimize\nthe beamforming to minimize the maximum periodic PCRB among all targets to\nensure fairness, subject to individual communication rate constraints at\nmultiple users. Despite the non-convexity of this problem, we propose a general\nconstruction method for the optimal solution by leveraging semi-definite\nrelaxation (SDR), and derive a general bound on the number of sensing beams\nneeded. Moreover, we unveil specific structures of the optimal solution in\nvarious cases, where tighter bounds on the number of sensing beams needed are\nderived (e.g., no or at most one sensing beam is needed under stringent rate\nconstraints or with homogeneous targets). Next, we study the beamforming\noptimization to minimize the sum periodic PCRB under user rate constraints. By\napplying SDR, we propose a general construction method for the optimal solution\nand its specific structures which yield lower computational complexities.

    "abstract": "Occlusion-free video generation is challenging due to surgeons' obstructions\nin the camera field of view. Prior work has addressed this issue by installing\nmultiple cameras on a surgical light, hoping some cameras will observe the\nsurgical field with less occlusion. However, this special camera setup poses a\nnew imaging challenge since camera configurations can change every time\nsurgeons move the light, and manual image alignment is required. This paper\nproposes an algorithm to automate this alignment task. The proposed method\ndetects frames where the lighting system moves, realigns them, and selects the\ncamera with the least occlusion. This algorithm results in a stabilized video\nwith less occlusion. Quantitative results show that our method outperforms\nconventional approaches. A user study involving medical doctors also confirmed\nthe superiority of our method.",

Sometimes guidelines make or require stronger causal\nclaims than those in the references they rely on, a phenomenon we refer to as\n'causal language jump'. We evaluated the strength of expressed causation in\ndiabetes guidelines and the evidence they reference to assess the pattern of\njumps. We randomly sampled 300 guideline statements from four diabetes\nguidelines. We rated the causation strength in the statements and the\ndependence on causation in recommendations supported by these statements using\nexisting scales. Among the causal statements, the cited original studies were\nsimilarly assessed. We also assessed how well they report target trial\nemulation (TTE) components as a proxy for reliability. Of the sampled\nstatements, 114 (38.0%) were causal, and 76 (66.7%) expressed strong causation.\n27.2% (31/114) of causal guideline statements demonstrated a \"causal language\njump\", and 34.9% (29/83) of guideline recommendations cannot be effectively\nsupported. Of the 53 eligible studies for TTE rating, most did not report\ntreatment assignment and causal contrast in detail. Our findings suggest causal\nlanguage jumps were common among diabetes guidelines.

This capability,\nrequired for planning and executing daily activities in a task-oriented manner,\nrelies on commonsense knowledge of object physics and functionalities,\nextending beyond simple object recognition. Current computational models for\naffordance reasoning from perception lack generalizability, limiting their\napplicability in novel scenarios. Meanwhile, comprehensive Large Language\nModels (LLMs) with emerging reasoning capabilities are challenging to deploy on\nlocal devices for task-oriented manipulations. Here, we introduce LVIS-Aff, a\nlarge-scale dataset comprising 1,496 tasks and 119k images, designed to enhance\nthe generalizability of affordance reasoning from perception. Utilizing this\ndataset, we develop Afford-X, an end-to-end trainable affordance reasoning\nmodel that incorporates Verb Attention and Bi-Fusion modules to improve\nmulti-modal understanding. This model achieves up to a 12.1% performance\nimprovement over the best-reported results from non-LLM methods, while also\ndemonstrating a 1.2% enhancement compared to our previous conference paper.\nAdditionally, it maintains a compact 187M parameter size and infers nearly 50\ntimes faster than the GPT-4V API. Our work demonstrates the potential for\nefficient, generalizable affordance reasoning models that can be deployed on\nlocal devices for task-oriented manipulations.

Furthermore, through the present work, we\nprovide a tentative proof for the decidability of one of CoL's numerous\naxiomatisations, namely CL15. Thus, our expedition initially takes off for an\naerial, perusal overview of this fertile steppe. The first chapter introduces\nCoL in a philosophical fashion, exposing and arguing its main key points. We\nthen move over to unfold its semantics and syntax profiles, allowing the reader\nto become increasingly more familiar with this new environment. Landing on to\nthe second chapter, we thoroughly introduce Cirquent Calculus, the new\ndeductive system Japaridze has developed in order to axiomatise Computability\nLogic. Indeed, this new proof-system can also be a useful tool for many other\nlogics. We then review each of the 17 axiomatisations found so far. The third\nchapter zooms-in on CL15, in order to come up with a possible solution to its\nopen problem. We outline its soundness and completeness proofs; then provide\nsome few deductive examples; and, finally, build a tentative proof of its\ndecidability. Lastly, the fourth chapter focuses on the potential and actual\napplications of Computability Logic, both in arithmetic (clarithmetic) and in\nArtificial Intelligence systems (meaning knowledgebase and planning-and-action\nones). We close our journey with some final remarks on the richness of this\nframework and, hence, the research-worthiness it entails.",

This reduces the effective\ntraining set and limits the full use of valuable medical data. While some\nmethods incorporate incomplete samples, they fail to effectively address\ninter-modal feature alignment and knowledge transfer challenges under high\nmissing rates.

    "abstract": "The chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model is widely employed in angiogenesis\nresearch, and distribution of growing blood vessels is the key evaluation\nindicator. As a result, vessel segmentation is crucial for quantitative\nassessment based on topology and morphology. However, manual segmentation is\nextremely time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to inconsistency due to\nits subjective nature. Moreover, research on CAM vessel segmentation algorithms\nremains limited, and the lack of public datasets contributes to poor prediction\nperformance. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative Intermediate\nDomain-guided Adaptation (IDA) method, which utilizes the similarity between\nCAM images and retinal images, along with existing public retinal datasets, to\nperform unsupervised training on CAM images. Specifically, we introduce a\nMulti-Resolution Asymmetric Translation (MRAT) strategy to generate\nintermediate images to promote image-level interaction. Then, an Intermediate\nDomain-guided Contrastive Learning (IDCL) module is developed to disentangle\ncross-domain feature representations. This method overcomes the limitations of\nexisting unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) approaches, which primarily\nconcentrate on directly source-target alignment while neglecting intermediate\ndomain information. Notably, we create the first CAM dataset to validate the\nproposed algorithm. Extensive experiments on this dataset show that our method\noutperforms compared approaches. Moreover, it achieves superior performance in\nUDA tasks across retinal datasets, highlighting its strong generalization\ncapability.

One of the key challenges is ensuring that the ADS is safe\nin the event of Foreseeable Misuse (FM) by the human driver. To address this\nchallenge, a case study on simulation-based testing to mitigate FM by the\ndriver using the driving simulator is presented. FM by the human driver refers\nto potential driving scenarios where the driver misinterprets the intended\nfunctionality of ADS, leading to hazardous behaviour. Safety of the Intended\nFunctionality (SOTIF) focuses on ensuring the absence of unreasonable risk\nresulting from hazardous behaviours related to functional insufficiencies\ncaused by FM and performance limitations of sensors and machine learning-based\nalgorithms for ADS. The simulation-based application of SOTIF to mitigate FM in\nADS entails determining potential misuse scenarios, conducting simulation-based\ntesting, and evaluating the effectiveness of measures dedicated to preventing\nor mitigating FM. The major contribution includes defining (i) test\nrequirements for performing simulation-based testing of a potential misuse\nscenario, (ii) evaluation criteria in accordance with SOTIF requirements for\nimplementing measures dedicated to preventing or mitigating FM, and (iii)\napproach to evaluate the effectiveness of the measures dedicated to preventing\nor mitigating FM. In conclusion, an exemplary case study incorporating\ndriver-vehicle interface and driver interactions with ADS forming the basis for\nunderstanding the factors and causes contributing to FM is investigated.\nFurthermore, the test procedure for evaluating the effectiveness of the\nmeasures dedicated to preventing or mitigating FM by the driver is developed in\nthis work.",

    "abstract": "Motivated by the holographic principle, within the context of the AdS/CFT\nCorrespondence in the large t'Hooft limit, we investigate how the geometry of\ncertain highly symmetric bulk spacetimes can be recovered given information of\nphysical quantities in the dual boundary CFT. In particular, we use the\nexistence of bulk-cone singularities (relating the location of operator\ninsertion points of singular boundary correlation functions to the endpoints of\nboundary-to boundary null geodesics in the bulk spacetime) and the holographic\nentanglement entropy proposal (relating the entanglement entropy of certain\nsubsystems on the boundary to the area of static minimal surfaces) to recover\nthe bulk metric.\n  Using null and zero-energy spacelike boundary-to-boundary geodesic probes, we\nshow that for classes of static, spherically symmetric, asymptotically AdS\nspacetimes, one can find analytic expressions for extracting the metric\nfunctions given boundary data. We find that if the spacetime admits null\ncircular orbits, the bulk geometry can only be recovered from the boundary,\ndown to the radius of null circular orbits. We illustrate this for various\nanalytic and numerical boundary functions of endpoint separation of null and\nspacelike geodesics. We then extend our analysis to higher dimensional minimal\nsurface probes within a class of static, planar symmetric, asymptotically AdS\nspacetimes. We again find analytic and perturbative expressions for the metric\nfunction in terms of the entanglement entropy of straight belt and circular\ndisk subsystems of the boundary theory respectively. Finally, we discuss how\nsuch extractions can be generalised.",

    "abstract": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made remarkable strides in\ncross-modal comprehension and generation tasks. However, they remain vulnerable\nto jailbreak attacks, where crafted perturbations bypass security guardrails\nand elicit harmful outputs. In this paper, we present the first adversarial\ntraining (AT) paradigm tailored to defend against jailbreak attacks during the\nMLLM training phase. Extending traditional AT to this domain poses two critical\nchallenges: efficiently tuning massive parameters and ensuring robustness\nagainst attacks across multiple modalities. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce Projection Layer Against Adversarial Training (ProEAT), an end-to-end\nAT framework. ProEAT incorporates a projector-based adversarial training\narchitecture that efficiently handles large-scale parameters while maintaining\ncomputational feasibility by focusing adversarial training on a lightweight\nprojector layer instead of the entire model; additionally, we design a dynamic\nweight adjustment mechanism that optimizes the loss function's weight\nallocation based on task demands, streamlining the tuning process. To enhance\ndefense performance, we propose a joint optimization strategy across visual and\ntextual modalities, ensuring robust resistance to jailbreak attacks originating\nfrom either modality. Extensive experiments conducted on five major jailbreak\nattack methods across three mainstream MLLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of\nour approach. ProEAT achieves state-of-the-art defense performance,\noutperforming existing baselines by an average margin of +34% across text and\nimage modalities, while incurring only a 1% reduction in clean accuracy.\nFurthermore, evaluations on real-world embodied intelligent systems highlight\nthe practical applicability of our framework, paving the way for the\ndevelopment of more secure and reliable multimodal systems.",

Current evaluation methods are constrained\nby limited public datasets and reliance on proxy tasks. To address these\nchallenges, we propose an application-grounded framework for large-scale,\nonline evaluations of vision-based decision-making tasks. The framework\nintroduces Blockies, a parametric approach for generating datasets of simulated\ndiagnostic tasks, offering control over the traits and biases in the data used\nto train real-world models. These tasks are designed to be easy to learn but\ndifficult to master, enabling participation by non-experts. The framework also\nincorporates storytelling and monetary incentives to manipulate perceived task\nstakes. An initial empirical study demonstrated that the high-stakes condition\nsignificantly reduced healthy distrust of AI, despite longer decision-making\ntimes. These findings underscore the importance of perceived stakes in\nfostering healthy distrust and demonstrate the framework's potential for\nscalable evaluation of high-stakes Human-AI collaboration.",

However, these methods\noften fall short in effectively quantifying the difficulty of hard samples. To\naddress this, we propose Adaptive Sine (AdaSin) loss function, which introduces\nthe sine of the angle between a sample's embedding feature and its ground-truth\nclass center as a novel difficulty metric. This metric enables precise and\neffective penalization of hard samples. By incorporating curriculum learning,\nthe model dynamically adjusts classification boundaries across different\ntraining stages. Unlike previous adaptive-margin loss functions, AdaSin\nintroduce a dual adaptive penalty, applied to both the positive and negative\ncosine similarities of hard samples. This design imposes stronger constraints,\nenhancing intra-class compactness and inter-class separability. The combination\nof the dual adaptive penalty and curriculum learning is guided by a\nwell-designed difficulty metric. It enables the model to focus more effectively\non hard samples in later training stages, and lead to the extraction of highly\ndiscriminative face features.

However, existing studies have only considered\ndifferentiating them from a single, pre-defined context (e.g., time or\nlocation), ignoring the fact that a user's extrinsic factors may be influenced\nby the interplay of various contexts at the same time. In this paper, we\npropose the Intrinsic-Extrinsic Disentangled Recommendation (IEDR) model, a\ngeneric framework that differentiates intrinsic from extrinsic factors\nconsidering various contexts simultaneously, enabling more accurate\ndifferentiation of factors and hence the improvement of recommendation\naccuracy. IEDR contains a context-invariant contrastive learning component to\ncapture intrinsic factors, and a disentanglement component to extract extrinsic\nfactors under the interplay of various contexts.

[1] we have to modify\nthe usual quantum relation of photons in the Doppler effect. But due to the\ncurrent limited information and knowledge, we could not yet determine the\nspecific expression for the correction coefficient in the modified quantum\nrelation of photons. However, the phenomenon called spontaneous radiation in a\ncyclotron maser give us an opportunity to see what the expression for this\ncorrection coefficient might look like. Therefor, under some necessary\nconstraints, we construct a very concise expression for this correction\ncoefficient through the discussion of different cases. And then we use this\nexpression to analyze the wavelength of radiation in the cyclotron maser, which\ntends to a limited value at v is close to c, rather than to 0 as predicted by\nthe Lorentz model. And the inverse Compton scattering phenomenon is also\ndiscussed and we find that there is a limit to the maximum energy that can be\nobtained by photons in the collision between extremely relativistic particles\nand low-energy photons, which conclusion is also very different from that\nobtained from the Lorentz model, in which the energy that can be obtained by\nthe photon tends to be infinite as the velocity of particle is close to c.

Previous studies have shown that models\ntrained on small image datasets often exploit such shortcuts, potentially\nimpairing their generalization performance. However, existing methods for\nidentifying frequency shortcuts require expensive computations and become\nimpractical for analyzing models trained on large datasets. In this work, we\npropose the first approach to more efficiently analyze frequency shortcuts at a\nlarge scale. We show that both CNN and transformer models learn frequency\nshortcuts on ImageNet. We also expose that frequency shortcut solutions can\nyield good performance on out-of-distribution (OOD) test sets which largely\nretain texture information. However, these shortcuts, mostly aligned with\ntexture patterns, hinder model generalization on rendition-based OOD test sets.\nThese observations suggest that current OOD evaluations often overlook the\nimpact of frequency shortcuts on model generalization.

    "abstract": "Molecular optimization is a crucial yet complex and time-intensive process\nthat often acts as a bottleneck for drug development. Traditional methods rely\nheavily on trial and error, making multi-objective optimization both\ntime-consuming and resource-intensive. Current AI-based methods have shown\nlimited success in handling multi-objective optimization tasks, hampering their\npractical utilization. To address this challenge, we present MultiMol, a\ncollaborative large language model (LLM) system designed to guide\nmulti-objective molecular optimization. MultiMol comprises two agents,\nincluding a data-driven worker agent and a literature-guided research agent.\nThe data-driven worker agent is a large language model being fine-tuned to\nlearn how to generate optimized molecules considering multiple objectives,\nwhile the literature-guided research agent is responsible for searching\ntask-related literature to find useful prior knowledge that facilitates\nidentifying the most promising optimized candidates. In evaluations across six\nmulti-objective optimization tasks, MultiMol significantly outperforms existing\nmethods, achieving a 82.30% success rate, in sharp contrast to the 27.50%\nsuccess rate of current strongest methods. To further validate its practical\nimpact, we tested MultiMol on two real-world challenges. First, we enhanced the\nselectivity of Xanthine Amine Congener (XAC), a promiscuous ligand that binds\nboth A1R and A2AR, successfully biasing it towards A1R. Second, we improved the\nbioavailability of Saquinavir, an HIV-1 protease inhibitor with known\nbioavailability limitations. Overall, these results indicate that MultiMol\nrepresents a highly promising approach for multi-objective molecular\noptimization, holding great potential to accelerate the drug development\nprocess and contribute to the advancement of pharmaceutical research.",

Current mitigation strategies rely on activating built-in defence\nmechanisms or fine-tuning the LLMs, but the fundamental distinctions between\nadversarial and benign prompts are yet to be understood. In this work, we\nintroduce CurvaLID, a novel defense framework that efficiently detects\nadversarial prompts by leveraging their geometric properties. It is agnostic to\nthe type of LLM, offering a unified detection framework across diverse\nadversarial prompts and LLM architectures. CurvaLID builds on the geometric\nanalysis of text prompts to uncover their underlying differences. We\ntheoretically extend the concept of curvature via the Whewell equation into an\n$n$-dimensional word embedding space, enabling us to quantify local geometric\nproperties, including semantic shifts and curvature in the underlying\nmanifolds.

    "abstract": "Gait recognition is a computer vision task that identifies individuals based\non their walking patterns. Gait recognition performance is commonly evaluated\nby ranking a gallery of candidates and measuring the accuracy at the top\nRank-$K$. Existing models are typically single-staged, i.e. searching for the\nprobe's nearest neighbors in a gallery using a single global feature\nrepresentation. Although these models typically excel at retrieving the correct\nidentity within the top-$K$ predictions, they struggle when hard negatives\nappear in the top short-list, leading to relatively low performance at the\nhighest ranks (e.g., Rank-1). In this paper, we introduce CarGait, a\nCross-Attention Re-ranking method for gait recognition, that involves\nre-ordering the top-$K$ list leveraging the fine-grained correlations between\npairs of gait sequences through cross-attention between gait strips. This\nre-ranking scheme can be adapted to existing single-stage models to enhance\ntheir final results. We demonstrate the capabilities of CarGait by extensive\nexperiments on three common gait datasets, Gait3D, GREW, and OU-MVLP, and seven\ndifferent gait models, showing consistent improvements in Rank-1,5 accuracy,\nsuperior results over existing re-ranking methods, and strong baselines.",

While massive stars, such as\nWolf-Rayet stars, have been considered potential sources, their UV flux often\nfails to fully explain the observed He II emission. Recent studies suggest that\nX-ray binaries (XRBs) might contribute significantly to this ionization. We\nexplore the relationship between X-ray and $\\rm He~II \\lambda4686$ emission in\na statistically significant sample of galaxies, investigating whether X-ray\nsources, including active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and XRBs, serve as the primary\nmechanism for He II ionization across different galactic environments. We\ncross-matched a sample of known well-detected He II galaxies with the Chandra\nSource Catalog, yielding 165 galaxies with X-ray and $\\rm He~II \\lambda4686$\ndetections. The sources were classified into star-forming galaxies (SFGs) and\nAGNs based on the BPT diagram and a classification scheme defined for He II\ngalaxies. We find a strong, linear correlation between X-ray and He II\nluminosity across AGNs and SFGs spanning over seven orders of magnitude. AGNs\ngenerally exhibit higher He II/H$\\beta$ flux ratios, stronger extinction, and\nharder X-ray spectra. The O32 ratio of SFGs is tightly correlated with the\nH$\\beta$ equivalent width ($\\rm EW_{H\\beta}$) but not with the He II/H$\\beta$\nratio, suggesting a different excitation mechanism. We derive an O32--$\\rm\nEW_{H\\beta}$ line above which only AGNs of our sample reside. The tight\ncorrelation between X-ray and He II luminosity supports X-rays as the primary\ndriver of He II excitation. While AGNs have one common ionization source, the\ncentral black hole, in SFGs low-energy species are mainly excited by UV\nemission related to star-forming activity, however, high-energy species like He\nII require the presence of XRBs.",

The polarisation fraction (PF) of the synchrotron component\nis 2%, while that of the dust component is 0.3%. The B-fields orientation maps\nin both bands at common resolution show that the same B-fields structure is\ntraced by dust and synchrotron emission at scales of 25 pc.

A negative correlation between PF and\ndispersion angle function was observed in Band 4 but was nearly absent in Band\n7 at native resolution, suggesting that the tangling of B-field geometry along\nthe plane of the sky is the main cause of depolarisation at 25 pc scales, while\nother factors play a role at 5 pc scales.",

Specifically, we analyze the reduction chains\n$\\mathfrak{so}(3) \\subset \\mathfrak{su}(3)$, corresponding to the Elliott model\nin nuclear physics, the chain $\\mathfrak{o}(3) \\subset\n\\mathfrak{sl}(3,\\mathbb{C})$ associated with the decomposition of the\nenveloping algebra of $\\mathfrak{sl}(3,\\mathbb{C})$ as a sum of modules, and\nthe reduction chain $\\mathfrak{h} \\subset \\mathfrak{sl}(3,\\mathbb{C})$\nconnected to the Racah algebra $R(3)$. In addition, a description of the\nclassification of the centralizer with respect to the Cartan subalgebra\n$\\mathfrak{h}$ associated with the classical series $A_n$ in connection with\nits root system is reconsidered. As an illustration of the procedure, the case\nof $S(A_3)^\\mathfrak{h}$ is considered in detail, which is connected with the\nrank-two Racah algebra for specific realizations of the generators as vector\nfields. This case has attracted interest with regard to orthogonal polynomials.",

The prediction of MCI to dementia conversion has been\nwell studied, but previous studies have almost always focused on traditional\nMachine Learning (ML) based methods that require sharing sensitive clinical\ninformation to train predictive models. This study proposes a privacy-enhancing\nsolution using Federated Learning (FL) to train predictive models for MCI to\ndementia conversion without sharing sensitive data, leveraging socio\ndemographic and cognitive measures. We simulated and compared two network\narchitectures, Peer to Peer (P2P) and client-server, to enable collaborative\nlearning. Our results demonstrated that FL had comparable predictive\nperformance to centralized ML, and each clinical site showed similar\nperformance without sharing local data. Moreover, the predictive performance of\nFL models was superior to site specific models trained without collaboration.\nThis work highlights that FL can eliminate the need for data sharing without\ncompromising model efficacy.",

    "abstract": "The term \"researcher degrees of freedom\" (RDF), which was introduced in\nmetascientific literature in the context of the replication crisis in science,\nrefers to the extent of flexibility a scientist has in making decisions related\nto data analysis. These choices occur at all stages of the data analysis\nprocess. In combination with selective reporting, RDF may lead to\nover-optimistic statements and an increased rate of false positive findings.\nEven though the concept has been mainly discussed in fields such as\nepidemiology or psychology, similar problems affect methodological statistical\nresearch. Researchers who develop and evaluate statistical methods are left\nwith a multitude of decisions when designing their comparison studies. This\nleaves room for an over-optimistic representation of the performance of their\npreferred method(s). The present paper defines and explores a particular RDF\nthat has not been previously identified and discussed. When interpreting the\nresults of real data examples that are most often part of methodological\nevaluations, authors typically tell a domain-specific \"story\" that best\nsupports their argumentation in favor of their preferred method. However, there\nare often plenty of other plausible stories that would support different\nconclusions. We define the \"storytelling fallacy\" as the selective use of\nanecdotal domain-specific knowledge to support the superiority of specific\nmethods in real data examples. While such examples fed by domain knowledge play\na vital role in methodological research, if deployed inappropriately they can\nalso harm the validity of conclusions on the investigated methods. The goal of\nour work is to create awareness for this issue, fuel discussions on the role of\nreal data in generating evidence in methodological research and warn readers of\nmethodological literature against naive interpretations of real data examples.",

It also\npresents an algorithm for generating the coordinated non-stop trajectories. The\nproposed method builds upon two pillars: (1)~the choice of $n$ special linearly\nindependent directions of internal forces within the $3n-6$-dimensional\nnullspace of the grasp matrix of the load, chosen as the edges of a Hamiltonian\ncycle on the graph that connects the cable attachment points on the load.\nAdjacent pairs of directions are used to generate $n$ forces evolving on\ndistinct 2D affine subspaces, despite the attachment points being generically\nin 3D; (2)~the construction of elliptical trajectories within these subspaces\nby mapping, through appropriate graph coloring, each edge of the Hamiltonian\ncycle to a periodic coordinate while ensuring that no adjacent coordinates\nexhibit simultaneous zero derivatives. Combined with conditions for load\nstatics and attachment point positions, these choices ensure that each of the\n$n$ force trajectories projects onto the corresponding cable constraint sphere\nwith non-zero tangential velocity, enabling perpetual motion of the carriers\nwhile the load is still.

Even ASIFT,\nwhich is built upon SIFT and entails a considerable number of image comparisons\nsimulated by affine transformations, inevitably exhibits the drawbacks of being\ntime-consuming and imposing high demands on memory usage. And the stability of\nfeature extraction drops rapidly under large-view affine transformations.\nConsequently, we propose a method that represents an improvement over ASIFT. On\nthe premise of improving the precision and maintaining the affine invariance,\nit currently ranks as the fastest feature extraction method for extra-affine\nimages that we know of at present. Simultaneously, the stability of feature\nextraction regarding affine transformation images has been approximated to the\nmaximum limits. Both the angle between the shooting direction and the normal\ndirection of the photographed object (absolute tilt angle), and the shooting\ntransformation angle between two images (transition tilt angle) are close to 90\ndegrees. The central idea of the method lies in obtaining the optimal parameter\nset by simulating affine transformation with the reference image. And the\nsimulated affine transformation is reproduced by combining it with the Lanczos\ninterpolation based on the optimal parameter set. Subsequently, it is combined\nwith ORB, which exhibits excellent real-time performance for rapid orientation\nbinary description.

Inspired\nby introspective learning, we propose Progressive Adversarial Self-Imitation\nSkill Transition (PASIST), a novel method that eliminates the need for complete\nexpert datasets. PASIST autonomously explores and selects high-quality\ntrajectories based on predefined target poses instead of demonstrations,\nleveraging the Generative Adversarial Self-Imitation Learning (GASIL)\nframework. To further enhance learning, We develop a skill selection module to\nmitigate mode collapse by balancing the weights of skills with varying levels\nof difficulty. Through these methods, PASIST is able to reproduce skills\ncorresponding to the target pose while achieving smooth and natural transitions\nbetween them. Evaluations on both simulation platforms and the Solo 8 robot\nconfirm the effectiveness of PASIST, offering an efficient alternative to\nexpert-driven learning.",

In this work, we present a new framework for velocity disturbance\nmodeling near no-slip walls, suited for dilute gas-solid flows characterized by\nlarge Stokes numbers. For small disturbance Reynolds numbers, the velocity\ndisturbance governing equations reduce to the steady Stokes equations. To\nexactly satisfy the no-slip and no-penetration boundary conditions for the\nvelocity disturbance at the location of the planar wall, we employ the method\nof images to derive the Green's functions of the Stokes equations for Wendland\nand Gaussian force regularization kernels. An additional convolution product\nwith a mesh-spacing dependent Gaussian kernel is performed to match the\nsolution produced by a discrete flow solver. We verify the proposed analytical\nmodel by comparing the velocity disturbance generated on a computational mesh\nwith the model predictions. An extension of the model for finite particle\nReynolds numbers is proposed by multiplying an Oseen correction factor in an\nunbounded domain. The correction scheme is validated using canonical test cases\ninvolving the motion of a single particle parallel and perpendicular to a wall\nat various Stokes numbers, particle Reynolds numbers, and particle diameter to\nmesh-spacing ratios.

    "abstract": "The prevailing paradigm in the domain of Open-Domain Dialogue agents\npredominantly focuses on the English language, encompassing both models and\ndatasets. Furthermore, the financial and temporal investments required for\ncrowdsourcing such datasets for finetuning are substantial, particularly when\nmultiple languages are involved. Fortunately, advancements in Large Language\nModels (LLMs) have unveiled a plethora of possibilities across diverse tasks.\nSpecifically, instruction-tuning has enabled LLMs to execute tasks based on\nnatural language instructions, occasionally surpassing the performance of human\ncrowdworkers. Additionally, these models possess the capability to function in\nvarious languages within a single thread. Consequently, to generate new samples\nin different languages, we propose leveraging these capabilities to replicate\nthe data collection process. We introduce a pipeline for generating Open-Domain\nDialogue data in multiple Target Languages using LLMs, with demonstrations\nprovided in a unique Source Language. By eschewing explicit Machine Translation\nin this approach, we enhance the adherence to language-specific nuances. We\napply this methodology to the PersonaChat dataset. To enhance the openness of\ngenerated dialogues and mimic real life scenarii, we added the notion of speech\nevents corresponding to the type of conversation the speakers are involved in\nand also that of common ground which represents the premises of a conversation.",

    "abstract": "Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with first-order methods like\nback-propagation is computationally intensive. Zeroth-Order (ZO) optimisation\nuses function evaluations instead of gradients, reducing memory usage, but\nsuffers from slow convergence in high-dimensional models. As a result, ZO\nresearch in LLMs has mostly focused on classification, overlooking more complex\ngenerative tasks. In this paper, we introduce ZOPrO, a novel ZO algorithm\ndesigned for Preference Optimisation in LLMs. We begin by analysing the\ninterplay between policy and reward models during traditional (first-order)\nPreference Optimisation, uncovering patterns in their relative updates. Guided\nby these insights, we adapt Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation\n(SPSA) with a targeted sampling strategy to accelerate convergence. Through\nexperiments on summarisation, machine translation, and conversational\nassistants, we demonstrate that our method consistently enhances reward signals\nwhile achieving convergence times comparable to first-order methods. While it\nfalls short of some state-of-the-art methods, our work is the first to apply\nZeroth-Order methods to Preference Optimisation in LLMs, going beyond\nclassification tasks and paving the way for a largely unexplored research\ndirection.

First, we investigate the use of GMRES-based iterative refinement\n(GMRES-IR) to solve the equation using implicitly its Kronecker product form:\nwe propose an efficient scheme to use the Schur factors of the coefficient\nmatrices as preconditioners, but we demonstrate that this approach is not\nsuitable in the case of the Sylvester equation. By revisiting a stationary\niteration for linear systems, we therefore derive a new iterative refinement\nscheme for the quasi-triangular Sylvester equation, and our rounding error\nanalysis provides sufficient conditions for convergence and a bound on the\nattainable relative residual. We leverage this iterative scheme to solve the\ngeneral Sylvester equation in mixed precision. The new algorithms compute the\nSchur decomposition of the matrix coefficients in low precision, use the\nlow-precision Schur factors to obtain an approximate solution to the\nquasi-triangular equation, and iteratively refine it to obtain a\nworking-precision solution to the quasi-triangular equation. However, being\nonly orthonormal to low precision, the unitary Schur factors of $A$ and $B$\ncannot be used to recover the solution to the original equation. We propose two\neffective approaches to address this issue: one is based on\nre-orthonormalization in the working precision, and the other on explicit\ninversion of the almost-unitary factors. We test these mixed-precision\nalgorithms on various Sylvester and Lyapunov equations from the literature. Our\nnumerical experiments show that, for both classes of equations, the new\nalgorithms are at least as accurate as existing ones. Our cost analysis, on the\nother hand, suggests that they would typically be faster than mono-precision\nalternatives if implemented on hardware that natively supports low precision.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI)\nsystems has raised concerns about our ability to ensure their fairness, that\nis, how to avoid discrimination based on protected characteristics such as\ngender, race, or age. While algorithmic fairness is well-studied in simple\nbinary classification tasks on tabular data, its application to complex,\nreal-world scenarios-such as Facial Expression Recognition (FER)-remains\nunderexplored. FER presents unique challenges: it is inherently multiclass, and\nbiases emerge across intersecting demographic variables, each potentially\ncomprising multiple protected groups. We present a comprehensive framework to\nanalyze bias propagation from datasets to trained models in image-based FER\nsystems, while introducing new bias metrics specifically designed for\nmulticlass problems with multiple demographic groups. Our methodology studies\nbias propagation by (1) inducing controlled biases in FER datasets, (2)\ntraining models on these biased datasets, and (3) analyzing the correlation\nbetween dataset bias metrics and model fairness notions. Our findings reveal\nthat stereotypical biases propagate more strongly to model predictions than\nrepresentational biases, suggesting that preventing emotion-specific\ndemographic patterns should be prioritized over general demographic balance in\nFER datasets. Additionally, we observe that biased datasets lead to reduced\nmodel accuracy, challenging the assumed fairness-accuracy trade-off.",

In the dynamic version of the problem, the goal is to design\na data structure that supports both efficient queries and updates, i.e.\ninsertions and deletions in $S$. This problem has been widely studied in\nvarious settings, ranging from points in the plane to more general distance\nmeasures and even points within simple polygons. When the sites do not live in\nthe plane but in some domain, another dynamic problem arises: what happens if\nnot the sites, but the domain itself is subject to updates?\n  Updating sites often results in local changes to the solution or data\nstructure, while updating the domain may incur many global changes. For\nexample, in the closest pair problem, inserting a point only requires us to\ncheck if this point is in the new closest pair, while updating the domain might\nchange the distances between most pairs of points in our set. Presumably, this\nis the reason that this form of dynamization has received much less attention.\nOnly some basic problems, such as shortest paths and ray shooting, have been\nstudied in this setting.\n  Here, we tackle the nearest neighbor problem in a dynamic simple polygon. We\nallow insertions into both the set of sites and the polygon. An insertion in\nthe polygon is the addition of a line segment starting at the boundary of the\npolygon.

Although infinite-layer nickelates (ILNs)\nshare similar crystalline structure and the same nominal 3d-electron\nconfigurations with cuprates, they have significant differences in Fermi\nsurface topology, electronic band characteristics, and charge order.

In\nthis paper, by viewing SMOTE as sampling from the edges of a geometric\nneighborhood graph and borrowing tools from the topological data analysis, we\npropose a novel technique, Simplicial SMOTE, that samples from the simplices of\na geometric neighborhood simplicial complex. A new synthetic point is defined\nby the barycentric coordinates w.r.t. a simplex spanned by an arbitrary number\nof data points being sufficiently close rather than a pair. Such a replacement\nof the geometric data model results in better coverage of the underlying data\ndistribution compared to existing geometric sampling methods and allows the\ngeneration of synthetic points of the minority class closer to the majority\nclass on the decision boundary. We experimentally demonstrate that our\nSimplicial SMOTE outperforms several popular geometric sampling methods,\nincluding the original SMOTE. Moreover, we show that simplicial sampling can be\neasily integrated into existing SMOTE extensions. We generalize and evaluate\nsimplicial extensions of the classic Borderline SMOTE, Safe-level SMOTE, and\nADASYN algorithms, all of which outperform their graph-based counterparts.",

However, as users interact with claims\nonline, they often introduce edits, and it remains unclear whether current\nembedding models used in retrieval are robust to such edits. To investigate\nthis, we introduce a perturbation framework that generates valid and natural\nclaim variations, enabling us to assess the robustness of a wide-range of\nsentence embedding models in a multi-stage retrieval pipeline and evaluate the\neffectiveness of various mitigation approaches. Our evaluation reveals that\nstandard embedding models exhibit notable performance drops on edited claims,\nwhile LLM-distilled embedding models offer improved robustness at a higher\ncomputational cost. Although a strong reranker helps to reduce the performance\ndrop, it cannot fully compensate for first-stage retrieval gaps. To address\nthese retrieval gaps, we evaluate train- and inference-time mitigation\napproaches, demonstrating that they can improve in-domain robustness by up to\n17 percentage points and boost out-of-domain generalization by 10 percentage\npoints. Overall, our findings provide practical improvements to claim-matching\nsystems, enabling more reliable fact-checking of evolving misinformation.

    "abstract": "In 1954, I. Kaplansky proposed three test problems for deciding the strength\nof structural understanding of a class of mathematical objects in his treatise\n\"Infinite abelian groups\", which can be formulated for very general\nmathematical systems. In this paper, we focus on Kaplansky's second test\nproblem in a context of complex geometry. Let $H^2_{\\beta}$ be a weighted Hardy\nspace. The Cowen-Douglas operator theory tells us that each\n$h\\in\\textrm{Hol}(\\overline{\\mathbb{D}})$ induces a Hermitian holomorphic\nvector bundle on $H^2_{\\beta}$, denoted by $E_{h(S_\\beta)}(\\Omega)$, where\n$\\Omega$ is a domain. We show that the vector bundle $E_{h(S_\\beta)}$ is a\npush-forwards Hermitian holomorphic vector bundle and study the similarity\ndeformation problems. Our main theorem is that if $H^2_{\\beta}$ is a weighted\nHardy space of polynomial growth, then for any $f\\in\n\\textrm{Hol}(\\overline{\\mathbb{D}})$, there exists a unique positive integer\n$m$ and an function $h\\in\\textrm{Hol}(\\overline{\\mathbb{D}})$ inducing an\nindecomposable vector bundle $E_{h(S_{\\beta})}$, such that $E_{f(S_\\beta)}$ is\nsimilar to $\\bigoplus_1^m E_{h(S_\\beta)}$, where $h$ is unique in the sense of\nanalytic automorphism group action. That could be seemed as a Jordan\ndecomposition theorem for the push-forwards Hermitian holomorphic vector\nbundles. Furthermore, we give the similarity classification of those\npush-forwards Hermitian holomorphic vector bundles induced by analytic\nfunctions, and give an affirmative answer to Kaplansky's second test problem\nfor those objects. We also give an affirmative answer to the geometric version\nand generalized version of a problem proposed by R. Douglas in 2007, and obtain\nthe $K_0$-group of the commutant algebra of a multiplication operator on a\nweighted Hardy space of polynomial growth. In addition, we give an example to\nshow the setting of polynomial growth condition is necessary.",

A\nconflicting observation, which termed anti-Kibble-Zurek dynamics has been\nreported in several studies, specifically in the driven systems with an\nuncorrelated stochastic (white) noise. Here, we study the defect generation in\nthe driven transverse field/anisotropy quantum $XY$ model in the presence of a\ncorrelated (colored) Gaussian noise. We propose a generic conjecture that\nproperly capture the noise-induced excitation features, which shows good\nagreement with the numerical simulations. We show that, the dynamical features\nof defect density are modified by varying the noise correlation time. Our\nnumerical simulations confirm that, for fast noises, the dynamics of the defect\ndensity is the same as that of the uncorrelated (white) noise, as is expected.\nHowever, the larger ratio of noise correlation time to the annealing time\nresults in larger defects density formation and reforms the universal dynamical\nfeatures. Our finding reveals that, the noise-induced defects scale linearly\nwith the annealing time for fast noises, while in the presence of the slow\nnoises, the noise-induced defects scale linearly with the square of the\nannealing time. The numerical simulations confirm that, the optimal annealing\ntime, at which the defects density is minimum, scales linearly in logarithmic\nscale with the total noise power having different exponents for the fast and\nslow noises.",

Also, its GC system was\nfound to be unusually bright, with a GC luminosity function peak at least one\nmagnitude brighter than expected for a galaxy at a distance of 20 Mpc. In this\nwork we present an updated view of the GC system of NGC1052-DF2. We analysed\narchival MUSE data of NGC1052-DF2 to confirm the membership of four additional\nGCs based on their radial velocities, thereby raising the number of\nspectroscopically confirmed GCs to 16. We measured the ages and metallicities\nof 11 individual GCs, finding them to be old ($> 9$ Gyr) and with a range of\nmetallicities from [M/H] = $-0.7$ to $-1.8$ dex. The majority of GCs are found\nto be more metal-poor than the host galaxy, with some metal-rich GCs sharing\nthe metallicity of the host ([M/H] = $-$1.09$^{+0.09}_{-0.07}$ dex). The host\ngalaxy shows a flat age and metallicity gradient out to 1 $R_\\text{e}$. Using a\ndistance measurement based on the internal GC velocity dispersions ($D = 16.2$\nMpc), we derived photometric GC masses and find that the peak of the GC mass\nfunction compares well with that of the Milky Way. From updated GC velocities,\nwe estimated the GC system velocity dispersion of NGC1052-DF2 with a simple\nkinematic model and find $\\sigma_\\text{GCS} = 14.86^{+3.89}_{-2.83}$ km\ns$^{-1}$. However, this value is reduced to $\\sigma_\\text{GCS} =\n8.63^{+2.88}_{-2.14}$ km s$^{-1}$ when the GC that has the highest relative\nvelocity based on a low S/N spectrum is considered an interloper.

    "abstract": "We employ a new way to measure the distance to NGC1052-DF2 via internal\nstellar velocity dispersions ($\\sigma$) of its globular clusters (GCs). We\nobtained deep (15.1h), R=18,200, Ca Triplet integrated-light spectra for 10 GCs\nin NGC1052-DF2 using FLAMES GIRAFFE on VLT. For five GCs we measure $\\sigma$,\nalong with precision velocities for the whole sample. We also present a new\nphotometric analysis based on 40 orbits of archival Hubble Space Telescope\nimaging for 16 spectroscopically confirmed GCs. Assuming that the NGC1052-DF2\nGCs obey the $M_V$ -- log($\\sigma$) relation followed by the Milky Way and M31\nGCs, the NGC1052-DF2 GCs give a distance, $d=16.2\\pm1.3$ (stat.) $\\pm1.7$\n(sys.) Mpc. By contrast, using a literature distance of $d=21.7$ Mpc from\nforward modelling of the TRGB, the GCs lie above the Milky Way + M31 relation\nby $\\sim0.6$ magnitudes. For a shorter literature distance of 13 Mpc, the GCs\nfall below the relation by $\\sim0.4$ mag. At $d = 16.2$ Mpc, we obtain mean\ndynamical $M/L_V = 1.61\\pm0.44 M_\\odot/L_\\odot$, and median half-light radii,\n$r_h =3.0\\pm0.5$ pc. This is entirely consistent with Milky Way GCs, with mean\n$M/L_V = 1.77\\pm0.10 M_\\odot/L_\\odot$, median $r_h =3.2\\pm0.6$ pc. For the\nfurther distance of 21.7 Mpc, we obtain low $M/L_V$ ratios ($M/L_V =\n1.19\\pm0.33 M_\\odot/L_\\odot$) which could suggest ages of $\\sim6$ Gyr.. Such\nyoung ages are inconsistent with our MUSE stellar population (companion paper,\nFahrion et al.) analysis of the NGC1052-DF2 GCs which indicates they are\n$\\sim10$ Gyr old. For $d = 16.2$ Mpc, coupled with our new photometry, we find\nthat the properties of the GCs in NGC1052-DF2 appear entirely consistent with\nthose in the Milky Way and other Local Group galaxies. In order to reconcile\nthe further distance with our results, a mass function more dwarf-depleted than\nthe Milky Way GCs must be invoked for the GCs of NGC1052-DF2.",

Such a transformation requires an\naccurate and precise estimate of the velocity of the solar system barycentre.\nIt was argued that the Gaia catalogue construction should account for this\neffect and also for the aberrational effect due to acceleration of the solar\nsystem barycentre. We argue that these two effects should not be accounted for\nin the construction of the Gaia astrometric catalogue. We briefly review the\nGaia catalogue reference frame, the concepts of stellar aberration and secular\naberration drift, and their observable consequences. The Gaia catalogue is (and\nshould be) constructed in the Barycentric Celestial Reference System: the\nreference system with the origin at the solar system barycentre as defined by\nthe underlying solar system ephemerides. We explain that the Gaia catalogue is\nconsistent with the International Celestial Reference System despite the\npresence of proper motion terms due to the acceleration of the solar system\nbarycentre. We also explain why transformation of the astrometry to a frame in\nwhich the observer is at rest with respect to the Galactic centre or distant\nuniverse is not needed for the interpretation of stellar kinematics, and that\nthere are practical concerns with such a transformation. The estimation of the\nvelocity and acceleration of the solar system barycentre, although important as\na matter of scientific investigation, are not needed for the construction of\nthe Gaia astrometric catalogue.",

Previous simulations\nof a chiral molecular model with an energetic bias towards homochiral\ninteractions show a spontaneous symmetry-breaking transition from a\nsupercritical racemic liquid into a subcritical liquid enriched in one of the\ntwo enantiomers. Here, we employ molecular dynamics simulations in order to\ntest the possible existence of this phenomenon in hydrogen peroxide, the\nsmallest chiral molecule. For this purpose, we study the fluid phase of this\nsubstance between 100 K and 1500 K, and from $10^{-4}$ GPa to 1 GPa. We find a\nglass transition and we suggest that hydrogen bonds play a central role in such\nbehavior. We also test the possibility of observing chiral symmetry breaking by\nperforming both constant temperature and cooling simulations at multiple\npressures, and we do not observe the phenomenon. An analysis of the structure\nof the liquid shows negligible differences between homochiral and heterochiral\ninteractions, supporting the difficulty in observing chiral symmetry breaking.\nIf hydrogen peroxide manifests spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking, it likely\ntakes place significantly below room temperature and is hidden by other\nphenomena, such as the glass transition or crystallization. More broadly, our\nresults, and recent experimental observations, suggest that greater molecular\ncomplexity is needed for spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in the liquid\nphase to occur.",

From these observations, we measure\nFaraday rotation. Using our measurement of Faraday rotation, we also derive the\nintrinsic electric vector position angle (EVPA0) for the source. As a\ncomplementary measurement we determine the behavior of polarization as a\nfunction of observed frequency. The polarization from NRAO150 only comes from\nthe core region, with a peak polarization intensity occurring at 24GHz. Across\nthe core region of NRAO150 we see clear gradients in Faraday rotation and EVPA0\nvalues that are aligned with the direction of the jet curving around the core\nregion. We find that for the majority of the polarized region the polarization\nfraction is greater at higher frequencies, with intrinsic polarization\nfractions in the core 3%. The Faraday rotation gradients and circular patterns\nin EVPA0 are strong evidence for a helical/toroidal magnetic field, and the\npresence of low intrinsic polarization fractions indicate that the polarized\nemission and hence the helical/toroidal magnetic field, occur within the\ninnermost jet.",

This\nenhances interpretability, particularly in when visualising spatial data, as\nusers can select the most appropriate map projection without distorting the\nglyphs' shape. Pie-glyphs are also particularly well-suited for visualising\ncompositional data, where there is a natural sum-to-one constraint on the data\nattributes. PieGlyph is developed under the Grammar of Graphics paradigm using\nthe ggplot2 framework and supports the generation of interactive pie-glyphs\nthrough the ggiraph package. Designed to integrate seamlessly with all features\nand extensions offered by ggplot2 and ggiraph, PieGlyph provides users with\nfull flexibility in customising every aspect of the visualisation. This paper\noutlines the conceptual framework of PieGlyph, compares it with existing\nalternatives, and demonstrates its applications through example visualisations.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the ground state and dynamical properties of ultracold gases\nin optical lattices with an aperiodic external potential-a scenario motivated\nby recent experiments on twisted bilayer optical lattices and optical\nquasicrystals. Our study reveals that the interplay between on-site repulsive\ninteractions and a quasiperiodic potential gives rise to rich physics. At low\nfilling factors, increasing the interaction strength induces a delocalization\neffect that transforms a Bose glass (BG) phase, characterized by disconnected\nsuperfluid (SF) regions, into a SF phase with a percolated network of SF\nclusters. This transition is quantitatively characterized by monitoring the\npercolation probability. At higher filling factors, we uncover a reentrant\nbehavior: as the on-site interaction increases, the system initially\ntransitions from BG to SF, but further increase restores the BG phase. This\nreentrance is ascribed to an interaction-driven rearrangement of particles,\nwhere a once percolated SF network fragments into isolated SF islands as\nrepulsive interactions dominate. Furthermore, our analysis of quench dynamics\ndemonstrates distinct transient behaviors. Intra-phase quenches yield minimal\nvariations in both the percolation probability and the inverse participation\nratio (IPR) of the particle density distribution. In contrast, inter-phase\nquenches produce pronounced effects; for instance, a quench from the SF to BG\nphase is marked by an abrupt loss of global SF connectivity, while a BG-to-SF\nquench features oscillatory changes in the percolation probability and a\ngradual decrease in the IPR, eventually stabilizing the SF phase. Our findings\nunveil the complex interplay between disorder and interaction in ultracold Bose\ngases, offering valuable insights that are highly pertinent to current\nexperimental efforts employing twisted bilayer and quasicrystalline optical\nlattice platforms.",

This early learning comes together\nwith an initial understanding of aspects of the meaning of concepts, e.g.,\ntheir implications, causality, and using them to predict likely future events.\nAll this is accomplished in many cases with little or no supervision, and from\nrelatively few examples, compared with current network models. In learning\nabout objects and human-object interactions, early acquired and possibly innate\nconcepts are often used in the process of learning additional, more complex\nconcepts. In the current work, we model how early-acquired concepts are used in\nthe learning of subsequent concepts, and compare the results with standard deep\nnetwork modeling. We focused in particular on the use of the concepts of\nanimacy and goal attribution in learning to predict future events. We show that\nthe use of early concepts in the learning of new concepts leads to better\nlearning (higher accuracy) and more efficient learning (requiring less data).\nWe further show that this integration of early and new concepts shapes the\nrepresentation of the concepts acquired by the model. The results show that\nwhen the concepts were learned in a human-like manner, the emerging\nrepresentation was more useful, as measured in terms of generalization to novel\ndata and tasks.

    "abstract": "Over the past six years, molecular transformer models have become key tools\nin drug discovery. Most existing models are pre-trained on large, unlabeled\ndatasets such as ZINC or ChEMBL. However, the extent to which large-scale\npre-training improves molecular property prediction remains unclear. This study\nevaluates transformer models for this task while addressing their limitations.\nWe explore how pre-training dataset size and chemically informed objectives\nimpact performance. Our results show that increasing the dataset beyond\napproximately 400K to 800K molecules from large-scale unlabeled databases does\nnot enhance performance across seven datasets covering five ADME endpoints:\nlipophilicity, permeability, solubility (two datasets), microsomal stability\n(two datasets), and plasma protein binding. In contrast, domain adaptation on a\nsmall, domain-specific dataset (less than or equal 4K molecules) using\nmulti-task regression of physicochemical properties significantly boosts\nperformance (P-value less than 0.001). A model pre-trained on 400K molecules\nand adapted with domain-specific data outperforms larger models such as\nMolFormer and performs comparably to MolBERT. Benchmarks against Random Forest\n(RF) baselines using descriptors and Morgan fingerprints show that chemically\nand physically informed features consistently yield better performance across\nmodel types. While RF remains a strong baseline, we identify concrete practices\nto enhance transformer performance. Aligning pre-training and adaptation with\nchemically meaningful tasks and domain-relevant data presents a promising\ndirection for molecular property prediction. Our models are available on\nHuggingFace for easy use and adaptation.",

The rim of the Bar shows very\ncorrugated structures made of small-scale H2 dissociation fronts (DFs). The\n[CI] 609 um emission peaks very close (~0.002 pc) to the main H2-emitting DFs,\nsuggesting the presence of gas density gradients. These DFs are also bright and\nremarkably similar in C2H emission, which traces \"hydrocarbon radical peaks\"\ncharacterized by very high C2H abundances, reaching up to several x10^-7. The\nhigh abundance of C2H and of related hydrocarbon radicals, such as CH3, CH2,\nand CH, can be attributed to gas-phase reactions driven by elevated\ntemperatures, the presence of C+ and C, and the reactivity of FUV-pumped H2.\nThe hydrocarbon radical peaks roughly coincide with maxima of the 3.4/3.3 um\nAIB intensity ratio, a proxy for the aliphatic-to-aromatic content of PAHs.\nThis implies that the conditions triggering the formation of simple\nhydrocarbons also favor the formation (and survival) of PAHs with aliphatic\nside groups, potentially via the contribution of bottom-up processes in which\nabundant hydrocarbon radicals react in situ with PAHs. Ahead of the DFs, in the\natomic PDR zone (where [H]>>[H2]), the AIB emission is the brightest, but small\nPAHs and carbonaceous grains undergo photo-processing due to the stronger FUV\nfield. Our detection of trace amounts of C2H in this zone may result from the\nphotoerosion of these species. This study provides a spatially resolved view of\nthe chemical stratification of key carbon carriers in a PDR. Overall, both\nbottom-up and top-down processes appear to link simple hydrocarbon molecules\nwith PAHs in molecular clouds; however, the exact chemical pathways and their\nrelative contributions remain to be quantified.",

Most existing methods address wind disturbances in either\ntrajectory planning or control, which may lead to hazardous situations during\nflight. The emergence of dynamic obstacles would further worsen the situation.\nTherefore, we propose an efficient and reliable framework for quadrotors that\nincorporates wind disturbance estimations during both the planning and control\nphases via a generalized proportional integral observer. First, we develop a\nreal-time adaptive spatial-temporal trajectory planner that utilizes\nHamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis for error dynamics resulting from\nwind disturbances. By considering the forward reachability sets propagation on\nan Euclidean Signed Distance Field (ESDF) map, safety is guaranteed.\nAdditionally, a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) controller\nconsidering wind disturbance compensation is implemented for robust trajectory\ntracking. Simulation and real-world experiments verify the effectiveness of our\nframework. The video and supplementary material will be available at\nhttps://github.com/Ma29-HIT/SEAL/.",

Control experiments in AUG\nsuggest that the self-regulating magnetic flux pumping mechanism, characterized\nby anomalous current redistribution, is responsible for clamping the central\nsafety factor (q_0) close to unity, thereby preventing the sawtooth onset. This\nwork presents a numerical and theoretical investigation of flux pumping in the\nAUG hybrid scenario based on the two-temperature, visco-resistive, full\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model with the JOREK code. To quantitatively model\nthe flux pumping, we choose realistic parameters, plasma configurations, and\nsource terms based on AUG experiments. During the initial saturation stage of\nthe unstable 1/1 quasi-interchange mode (on millisecond timescales), q_0\nexhibits fast under-damped oscillation and reaches a value closer to unity,\nwhich is attributed to the self-regulation of core plasma and the fast dynamo\neffect on the order of V/m. On the longer resistive diffusion timescale of\nseconds, the slow negative dynamo effect on the order of mV/m induced by the\n1/1 MHD instability plays an effective role in flux pumping, which provides\nquantitative agreement with experimental observations for the first time. The\nfinal saturated 1/1 MHD instability exhibits features of the quasi-interchange\nmode and tearing mode, and the associated convective plasma flow velocity is a\nfew m/s. The toroidal negative electric field from the slow dynamo dominantly\noffsets the positive current drive and continuously redistributes the current\ndensity and pressure. As a result, q_0 is maintained close to unity due to the\nlow-shear profiles of current density and pressure in the plasma core, and the\nsystem enters a sawtooth-free and quasi-stationary helical state.",

In this study, we compare cotemporal HMI and SOLIS magnetograms to\nillustrate the instrument-dependence of even qualitative features of the energy\nand helicity spectra. Around the minimum between solar cycles 24 and 25, we\nfind that the magnetic energy spectrum computed from HMI observations exhibits\ntwo distinct peaks. One of these peaks is only present near the cycle minimum,\nand corresponds to large-scale magnetic fields at high latitudes. Nevertheless,\nsuch magnetic fields are not present in contemporaneous synoptic vector\nmagnetograms from SOLIS. Further, even when magnetograms from both the\ninstruments are apodized, the helicity spectra calculated using the two-scale\nmethod disagree (on both the sign and the value of the fractional helicity).\nThis suggests that currently available synoptic magnetograms are not reliable\nenough for such studies.",

    "abstract": "Link prediction is a crucial task in many downstream applications of graph\nmachine learning. To this end, Graph Neural Network (GNN) is a widely used\ntechnique for link prediction, mainly in transductive settings, where the goal\nis to predict missing links between existing nodes. However, many real-life\napplications require an inductive setting that accommodates for new nodes,\ncoming into an existing graph. Thus, recently inductive link prediction has\nattracted considerable attention, and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is the\npopular choice of most studies to learn node representations. However, these\napproaches have limited expressivity and do not fully capture the graph's\nstructural signal. Therefore, in this work we propose LEAP, an inductive link\nprediction method based on LEArnable toPology augmentation. Unlike previous\nmethods, LEAP models the inductive bias from both the structure and node\nfeatures, and hence is more expressive. To the best of our knowledge, this is\nthe first attempt to provide structural contexts for new nodes via learnable\naugmentation in inductive settings. Extensive experiments on seven real-world\nhomogeneous and heterogeneous graphs demonstrates that LEAP significantly\nsurpasses SOTA methods. The improvements are up to 22\\% and 17\\% in terms of\nAUC and average precision, respectively. The code and datasets are available on\nGitHub (https://github.com/AhmedESamy/LEAP/)",

It plays a crucial role in neuroscience\nand clinical fields by facilitating the study of brain connectivity and\nneurological disorders.

Recently, deep learning methods have been\napplied to improve tractograms for better white matter coverage, but often\ncomes at the expense of generating excessive false-positive connections. This\nis largely due to their reliance on local information to predict long range\nstreamlines. To improve the accuracy of streamline propagation predictions, we\nintroduce a novel deep learning framework that integrates image-domain spatial\ninformation and anatomical information along tracts, with the former extracted\nthrough convolutional layers and the later modeled via a Transformer-decoder.\nAdditionally, we employ a weighted loss function to address fiber class\nimbalance encountered during training.

    "abstract": "We address the problem of safety verification for nonlinear stochastic\nsystems, specifically the task of certifying that system trajectories remain\nwithin a safe set with high probability. To tackle this challenge, we adopt a\nset-erosion strategy, which decouples the effects of stochastic disturbances\nfrom deterministic dynamics. This approach converts the stochastic safety\nverification problem on a safe set into a deterministic safety verification\nproblem on an eroded subset of the safe set. The success of this strategy\nhinges on the depth of erosion, which is determined by a probabilistic tube\nthat bounds the deviation of stochastic trajectories from their corresponding\ndeterministic trajectories. Our main contribution is the establishment of a\ntight bound for the probabilistic tube of nonlinear stochastic systems. To\nobtain a probabilistic bound for stochastic trajectories, we adopt a\nmartingale-based approach. The core innovation lies in the design of a novel\nenergy function associated with the averaged moment generating function, which\nforms an affine martingale, a generalization of the traditional c-martingale.\nUsing this energy function, we derive a precise bound for the probabilistic\ntube. Furthermore, we enhance this bound by incorporating the union-bound\ninequality for strictly contractive dynamics. By integrating the derived\nprobabilistic tubes into the set-erosion strategy, we demonstrate that the\nsafety verification problem for nonlinear stochastic systems can be reduced to\na deterministic safety verification problem.

Ideally,\nthese models should focus on key visual information relevant to the text token.\nHowever, recent findings indicate that LMMs have an extraordinary tendency to\nconsistently allocate high attention weights to specific visual tokens, even\nwhen these tokens are irrelevant to the corresponding text. In this study, we\ninvestigate the property behind the appearance of these irrelevant visual\ntokens and examine their characteristics. Our findings show that this behavior\narises due to the massive activation of certain hidden state dimensions, which\nresembles the attention sink found in language models. Hence, we refer to this\nphenomenon as the visual attention sink. In particular, our analysis reveals\nthat removing the irrelevant visual sink tokens does not impact model\nperformance, despite receiving high attention weights. Consequently, we recycle\nthe attention to these tokens as surplus resources, redistributing the\nattention budget to enhance focus on the image. To achieve this, we introduce\nVisual Attention Redistribution (VAR), a method that redistributes attention in\nimage-centric heads, which we identify as innately focusing on visual\ninformation. VAR can be seamlessly applied across different LMMs to improve\nperformance on a wide range of tasks, including general vision-language tasks,\nvisual hallucination tasks, and vision-centric tasks, all without the need for\nadditional training, models, or inference steps.

Here we resolve this conundrum. First, we show that the coupling\nobserved in two dimensions is an artifact of cage correction introduced to\naccount for Mermin-Wagner fluctuations. Instead, the relative relaxation time\nof small and large particles in two dimensions remains constant or slightly\ndecouples with temperature, as opposed to the substantial decoupling observed\nin three dimensions. Investigating these dimensional differences further, we\nfind through mobile cluster analysis that small particles initiate relaxation\nin both dimensions. As the clusters grow larger, they remain dominated by small\nparticles in three dimensions whereas in two cluster growth becomes\nparticle-size agnostic. We explain these findings with a minimal model by\nstudying the distributions of single-particle barrier heights in the system,\nshowing there is a clear difference in the environments of small and large\nparticles, depending on the dimensionality.

    "abstract": "We measure the luminosity functions (LFs) and stellar mass functions (SMFs)\nof photometric satellite galaxies around spectroscopically identified isolated\ncentral galaxies (ICGs). The photometric satellites are from the DESI Legacy\nImaging Surveys (DR9), while the spectroscopic ICGs are selected from the DESI\nYear-1 BGS sample. We can measure satellite LFs down to $r$-band absolute\nmagnitudes of $M_{r,\\mathrm{sat}}\\sim-7$, around ICGs as small as\n$7.1<\\log_{10}M_{\\ast,\\mathrm{ICG}}/\\mathrm{M_\\odot}<7.8$, with the stellar\nmass of ICGs measured by the DESI Fastspecfit pipeline. The satellite SMF can\nbe measured down to $\\log_{10}M_{\\ast,\\mathrm{sat}}/\\mathrm{M_\\odot}\\sim 5.5$.\nInterestingly, we discover that the faint/low-mass end slopes of satellite\nLFs/SMFs become steeper with the decrease in the stellar masses of host ICGs,\nwith smaller and nearby host ICGs capable of being used to probe their fainter\nsatellites.. The steepest slopes are $-2.298\\pm0.656$ and $-$2.888$\\pm$0.916\nfor satellite LF and SMF, respectively. Detailed comparisons are performed\nbetween the satellite LFs around ICGs selected from DESI BGS or from the SDSS\nNYU-VAGC spectroscopic Main galaxies over\n$7.1<\\log_{10}M_{\\ast,\\mathrm{ICG}}/\\mathrm{M_\\odot}<11.7$, showing reasonable\nagreements, but we show that the differences between DESI and SDSS stellar\nmasses for ICGs play a role to affect the results. We also compare measurements\nbased on DESI Fastspecfit and Cigale stellar masses used to bin ICGs, with the\nlatter including the modeling of AGN based on WISE photometry, and we find good\nagreements in the measured satellite LFs by using either of the DESI stellar\nmass catalogs.",

In this study, we unveil a whole new form of edge states that transcends\nthe established paradigms of band-gap topology. In contrast to the traditional\nstable edge states in topological insulators with specific band gaps, the\none-dimensional systems we investigate are inherently gapless with the\nBrillouin zones being mapped to the loops encircling hypersurface singularities\nin a higher-dimensional space with parity-time symmetry. These hypersurface\nsingularities are nonisolated degeneracies embedded entirely on exceptional\nsurfaces, rendering the energy gaps in our systems inevitably closed at the\nintersections of the Brillouin zone loop and the exceptional surfaces.\nUnexpectedly, such gapless systems still afford topologically protected edge\nstates at system boundaries, challenging the conventional understanding based\non band gaps. To elucidate the existence of these edge states in the absence of\na band-gap-based invariant, we propose a theoretical framework based on\neigen-frame rotation and deformation that incorporates non-Bloch band theory.\nFinally, we experimentally demonstrate this new form of topological edge states\nwith nonreciprocal circuits for the first time.

    "abstract": "Asymptomatic infection has gained notoriety as an important feature of\ninfectious disease dynamics. Despite increasing attention, there have been few\nrigorous examinations of how asymptomatic transmission influences pathogen\nevolution. In this study, we apply evolutionary invasion analysis to compute\noptimal strategies for viruses evolving in a system with a distinct\nasymptomatic transmission stage. We ask how pathogens would evolve under three\nconditions: with an increase in the mean infectious period in the symptomatic\nstate, with an increase in the mean infectious period in the asymptomatic\nstage, and an increase in proportion proceeding through the ``mild recovery\nroute\" (where the symptomatic state was bypassed entirely). We find that an\nincreased proportion of cases moving through a ``mild recovery route\" -- which\ncan occur with different host susceptibility or increased public health\nintervention -- leads to a model structure in which mutant pathogens are\ntransmitted largely through the asymptomatic route, with slightly increased\nevolved virulence levels. In addition, we find that an increase in the mean\ninfectious period of the symptomatic state has a small overall influence on the\nfitness of the pathogen, when effective transmission can occur via the\nasymptomatic route. Further, we find that virulence levels change very slightly\nfor both the asymptomatic and symptomatic populations. In sum, our results\nhighlight the evolutionary implications of variation in host susceptibility and\npublic health interventions in the context of asymptomatic transmission. More\ngenerally, the findings speak to the need for more nuanced interrogations of\nsubtle routes of transmission, as they can have profound implications in\ndisease evolution, ecology, and epidemiology.",

We analyse a suite\nof stratified box simulations modelling a realistic ISM that aims to probe\nenvironments similar to those found in the Milky Way. Turbulence is injected\nthrough stellar feedback and an external large-scale driving force. We find\nthat star formation can be either boosted or reduced when increasing the\nexternal driving strength, depending on the environment. When the density is\nsufficiently high, warm neutral gas naturally transitions to the cold phase,\nleading to high cold neutral medium (CNM) fractions of around 40\\%. Under these\nconditions, excessive large-scale driving leads to a slight reduction of the\nCNM fraction and an increase in the amount of gas that is thermally unstable.\nWhat limits the star formation in this regime is a reduced fraction of dense\ngas due to additional turbulent support against collapse. For low density\nregions, overdensities in which cooling is efficient are much rarer and we find\nthat star formation is regulated by the formation of cold gas. In such cases,\nturbulence can significantly boost star formation by compressing gas in shocks\nand increasing the CNM fraction dramatically. In our simulations we see an\nincrease from almost no CNM to up to a fraction of 15 \\% when including\nexternal turbulence driving; leading to an associated increase in the star\nformation rate. We provide a model to quantify this behaviour and predict the\nCNM fraction by combining the standard ISM cooling/heating model with the\ndensity PDF generated by turbulence.

    "abstract": "Neural audio signal codecs have attracted significant attention in recent\nyears. In essence, the impressive low bitrate achieved by such encoders is\nenabled by learning an abstract representation that captures the properties of\nencoded signals, e.g., speech. In this work, we investigate the relation\nbetween the latent representation of the input signal learned by a neural codec\nand the quality of speech signals. To do so, we introduce\nLatent-representation-to-Quantization error Ratio (LQR) measures, which\nquantify the distance from the idealized neural codec's speech signal model for\na given speech signal. We compare the proposed metrics to intrusive measures as\nwell as data-driven supervised methods using two subjective speech quality\ndatasets. This analysis shows that the proposed LQR correlates strongly (up to\n0.9 Pearson's correlation) with the subjective quality of speech. Despite being\na non-intrusive metric, this yields a competitive performance with, or even\nbetter than, other pre-trained and intrusive measures. These results show that\nLQR is a promising basis for more sophisticated speech quality measures.",

    "abstract": "Automatic evaluation for Open Domain Event Detection (ODED) is a highly\nchallenging task, because ODED is characterized by a vast diversity of\nun-constrained output labels from various domains. Nearly all existing\nevaluation methods for ODED usually first construct evaluation benchmarks with\nlimited labels and domain coverage, and then evaluate ODED methods using\nmetrics based on token-level label matching rules. However, this kind of\nevaluation framework faces two issues: (1) The limited evaluation benchmarks\nlack representatives of the real world, making it difficult to accurately\nreflect the performance of various ODED methods in real-world scenarios; (2)\nEvaluation metrics based on token-level matching rules fail to capture semantic\nsimilarity between predictions and golden labels. To address these two problems\nabove, we propose a scalable and reliable Semantic-level Evaluation framework\nfor Open domain Event detection (SEOE) by constructing a more representative\nevaluation benchmark and introducing a semantic evaluation metric.\nSpecifically, our proposed framework first constructs a scalable evaluation\nbenchmark that currently includes 564 event types covering 7 major domains,\nwith a cost-effective supplementary annotation strategy to ensure the\nbenchmark's representativeness. The strategy also allows for the supplement of\nnew event types and domains in the future. Then, the proposed SEOE leverages\nlarge language models (LLMs) as automatic evaluation agents to compute a\nsemantic F1-score, incorporating fine-grained definitions of semantically\nsimilar labels to enhance the reliability of the evaluation. Extensive\nexperiments validate the representatives of the benchmark and the reliability\nof the semantic evaluation metric. Existing ODED methods are thoroughly\nevaluated, and the error patterns of predictions are analyzed, revealing\nseveral insightful findings.",

    "abstract": "With the advancement of conversational large language models (LLMs), several\nLLM-based Conversational Shopping Agents (CSA) have been developed to help\ncustomers smooth their online shopping. The primary objective in building an\nengaging and trustworthy CSA is to ensure the agent's responses about product\nfactoids are accurate and factually grounded. However, two challenges remain.\nFirst, LLMs produce hallucinated or unsupported claims. Such inaccuracies risk\nspreading misinformation and diminishing customer trust. Second, without\nproviding knowledge source attribution in CSA response, customers struggle to\nverify LLM-generated information. To address both challenges, we present an\neasily productionized solution that enables a ''citation experience'' to our\ncustomers. We build auto-evaluation metrics to holistically evaluate LLM's\ngrounding and attribution capabilities, suggesting that citation generation\nparadigm substantially improves grounding performance by 13.83%. To deploy this\ncapability at scale, we introduce Multi-UX-Inference system, which appends\nsource citations to LLM outputs while preserving existing user experience\nfeatures and supporting scalable inference. Large-scale online A/B tests show\nthat grounded CSA responses improves customer engagement by 3% - 10%, depending\non UX variations.",

Additionally, unpredictable workloads and resource\nlimitations lead to fluctuating performance and violated SLOs. To improve SLO\ncompliance in DCCS, one possibility is to apply machine learning; however, the\ndesign choices are often left to the developer. To that extent, we provide a\nbenchmark of Active Inference -- an emerging method from neuroscience --\nagainst three established reinforcement learning algorithms (Deep Q-Network,\nAdvantage Actor-Critic, and Proximal Policy Optimization). We consider a\nrealistic DCCS use case: an edge device running a video conferencing\napplication alongside a WebSocket server streaming videos. Using one of the\nrespective algorithms, we continuously monitor key performance metrics, such as\nlatency and bandwidth usage, to dynamically adjust parameters -- including the\nnumber of streams, frame rate, and resolution -- to optimize service quality\nand user experience. To test algorithms' adaptability to constant system\nchanges, we simulate dynamically changing SLOs and both instant and gradual\ndata-shift scenarios, such as network bandwidth limitations and fluctuating\ndevice thermal states.

    "abstract": "Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have shown their competence in handling\nspatial-temporal event-based data with low energy consumption. Similar to\nconventional artificial neural networks (ANNs), SNNs are also vulnerable to\ngradient-based adversarial attacks, wherein gradients are calculated by\nspatial-temporal back-propagation (STBP) and surrogate gradients (SGs).\nHowever, the SGs may be invisible for an inference-only model as they do not\ninfluence the inference results, and current gradient-based attacks are\nineffective for binary dynamic images captured by the dynamic vision sensor\n(DVS). While some approaches addressed the issue of invisible SGs through\nuniversal SGs, their SGs lack a correlation with the victim model, resulting in\nsub-optimal performance. Moreover, the imperceptibility of existing SNN-based\nbinary attacks is still insufficient. In this paper, we introduce an innovative\npotential-dependent surrogate gradient (PDSG) method to establish a robust\nconnection between the SG and the model, thereby enhancing the adaptability of\nadversarial attacks across various models with invisible SGs. Additionally, we\npropose the sparse dynamic attack (SDA) to effectively attack binary dynamic\nimages. Utilizing a generation-reduction paradigm, SDA can fully optimize the\nsparsity of adversarial perturbations. Experimental results demonstrate that\nour PDSG and SDA outperform state-of-the-art SNN-based attacks across various\nmodels and datasets. Specifically, our PDSG achieves 100% attack success rate\non ImageNet, and our SDA obtains 82% attack success rate by modifying only\n0.24% of the pixels on CIFAR10DVS.

    "abstract": "Dementia, a neurological disorder impacting millions globally, presents\nsignificant challenges in diagnosis and patient care. With the rise of privacy\nconcerns and security threats in healthcare, federated learning (FL) has\nemerged as a promising approach to enable collaborative model training across\ndecentralized datasets without exposing sensitive patient information. However,\nFL remains vulnerable to advanced security breaches such as gradient inversion\nand eavesdropping attacks. This paper introduces a novel framework that\nintegrates federated learning with quantum-inspired encryption techniques for\ndementia classification, emphasizing privacy preservation and security.\nLeveraging quantum key distribution (QKD), the framework ensures secure\ntransmission of model weights, protecting against unauthorized access and\ninterception during training. The methodology utilizes a convolutional neural\nnetwork (CNN) for dementia classification, with federated training conducted\nacross distributed healthcare nodes, incorporating QKD-encrypted weight sharing\nto secure the aggregation process. Experimental evaluations conducted on MRI\ndata from the OASIS dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves\nidentical accuracy levels to a baseline model while enhancing data security and\nreducing loss by almost 1% compared to the classical baseline model. The\nframework offers significant implications for democratizing access to AI-driven\ndementia diagnostics in low- and middle-income countries, addressing critical\nresource and privacy constraints.

Polydispersity of the fluid as well as strong\ncoupling of rotational and translational motion of the rods are two of the\nvarious hurdles in interpreting the experimental results in a complex fluid\nenvironment. Furthermore, influence of volume fraction, $\\phi$, and absolute\nfree volume, $V_{\\rm free}$, which changes inherently with $\\delta$ on the\ndynamics are not adequately discussed in the literature. Thus, we investigate\nthe dynamical behaviour of the rods under two different conditions: (i)\nconstant pressure (in which $\\phi$ changes with $\\delta$), and (ii) constant\n$\\phi$. Under constant pressure it is observed that the rotational relaxation\ntime and hence the diffusion constant, $D_R$, varies with rod length as $D_R\n\\sim l^{-\\alpha}$, where the value of exponent $\\alpha$ increases from\n$3.0-3.2$ while varying $\\delta$ from $0-40\\%$.

    "abstract": "Multiple previous studies have reported suboptimal performance of LLMs in\nbiomedical text mining. By analyzing failure patterns in these evaluations, we\nidentified three primary challenges for LLMs in biomedical corpora: (1) LLMs\nfail to learn implicit dataset-specific nuances from supervised data, (2) The\ncommon formatting requirements of discriminative tasks limit the reasoning\ncapabilities of LLMs particularly for LLMs that lack test-time compute, and (3)\nLLMs struggle to adhere to annotation guidelines and match exact schemas, which\nhinders their ability to understand detailed annotation requirements which is\nessential in biomedical annotation workflow. We experimented with prompt\nengineering techniques targeted to the above issues, and developed a pipeline\nthat dynamically extracts instructions from annotation guidelines. Our results\nshow that frontier LLMs can approach or surpass the performance of SOTA\nBERT-based models with minimal reliance on manually annotated data and without\nfine-tuning. Furthermore, we performed model distillation on a closed-source\nLLM, demonstrating that a BERT model trained exclusively on synthetic data\nannotated by LLMs can also achieve a practical performance. Based on these\nfindings, we explored the feasibility of partially replacing manual annotation\nwith LLMs in production scenarios for biomedical text mining.",

    "abstract": "State-of-the-art stereo matching methods typically use costly 3D convolutions\nto aggregate a full cost volume, but their computational demands make mobile\ndeployment challenging. Directly applying 2D convolutions for cost aggregation\noften results in edge blurring, detail loss, and mismatches in textureless\nregions. Some complex operations, like deformable convolutions and iterative\nwarping, can partially alleviate this issue; however, they are not\nmobile-friendly, limiting their deployment on mobile devices. In this paper, we\npresent a novel bilateral aggregation network (BANet) for mobile stereo\nmatching that produces high-quality results with sharp edges and fine details\nusing only 2D convolutions. Specifically, we first separate the full cost\nvolume into detailed and smooth volumes using a spatial attention map, then\nperform detailed and smooth aggregations accordingly, ultimately fusing both to\nobtain the final disparity map. Experimental results demonstrate that our\nBANet-2D significantly outperforms other mobile-friendly methods, achieving\n35.3\\% higher accuracy on the KITTI 2015 leaderboard than MobileStereoNet-2D,\nwith faster runtime on mobile devices.

By leveraging\nLLMs as predictors, GFMs have demonstrated impressive generalizability across\nvarious tasks and datasets. However, existing research on LLMs as predictors\nhas predominantly focused on static graphs, leaving their potential in dynamic\ngraph prediction unexplored. In this work, we pioneer using LLMs for predictive\ntasks on dynamic graphs. We identify two key challenges: the constraints\nimposed by context length when processing large-scale historical data and the\nsignificant variability in domain characteristics, both of which complicate the\ndevelopment of a unified predictor. To address these challenges, we propose the\nGraphAgent-Dynamic (GAD) Framework, a multi-agent system that leverages\ncollaborative LLMs. In contrast to using a single LLM as the predictor, GAD\nincorporates global and local summary agents to generate domain-specific\nknowledge, enhancing its transferability across domains. Additionally,\nknowledge reflection agents enable adaptive updates to GAD's knowledge,\nmaintaining a unified and self-consistent architecture. In experiments, GAD\ndemonstrates performance comparable to or even exceeds that of full-supervised\ngraph neural networks without dataset-specific training. Finally, to enhance\nthe task-specific performance of LLM-based predictors, we discuss potential\nimprovements, such as dataset-specific fine-tuning to LLMs. By developing\ntailored strategies for different tasks, we provide new insights for the future\ndesign of LLM-based predictors.",

From extensive experiments, we find\nthat easy databases narrow the gap between the performance of BPIQA and BIQA\nmodels, which is unconducive to the development of BPIQA. And the easy\ndatabases make the BPIQA models be closed to saturation, therefore the\neffectiveness of the associated specific designs can not be well verified.\nBesides, the BPIQA models trained on our recently proposed databases with\ncomplicated degradation show better generalization ability.

We find no\nevidence for CO emission in the central $\\sim$kpc and place an upper limit of\n$M_\\mathrm{H_2} < 2.3\\times 10^5$ $M_\\odot$ in the atomic gas CND region, a\nfactor of 20$\\times$ lower than previous surveys. During this search, we\ndiscovered extragalactic CO absorption lines in the $J$ = 1$-$0, 2$-$1, and\n3$-$2 transitions against the bright (Jy-scale) active nucleus. These CO lines\nare narrow ($\\sim$5 km s$^{-1}$) and blueshifted with respect to the galaxy's\nsystemic velocity by $-$75 to $-$84 \\kms. This CO absorber appears to be\nkinematically distinct from outflowing atomic gas seen in absorption. Low\nintegrated opacities ranging from $\\tau_\\mathrm{CO} \\sim 0.02-0.06$ \\kms\\ and a\ncolumn density $N_\\mathrm{CO} \\approx (1.2\\pm0.2)\\times 10^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$\ntranslate to $N_\\mathrm{H_2} \\sim (1-2) \\times 10^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$.

Taken together, the observed CO absorption lines are most\nconsistent with a thin, pressure-confined filament seen slightly off-center\nfrom the M87 nucleus.

    "abstract": "The last few years have seen an explosion of interest in autonomous cyber\ndefence agents based on deep reinforcement learning. Such agents are typically\ntrained in a cyber gym environment, also known as a cyber simulator, at least\n32 of which have already been built. Most, if not all cyber gyms provide dense\n\"scaffolded\" reward functions which combine many penalties or incentives for a\nrange of (un)desirable states and costly actions. Whilst dense rewards help\nalleviate the challenge of exploring complex environments, yielding seemingly\neffective strategies from relatively few environment steps; they are also known\nto bias the solutions an agent can find, potentially towards suboptimal\nsolutions. This is especially a problem in complex cyber environments where\npolicy weaknesses may not be noticed until exploited by an adversary. In this\nwork we set out to evaluate whether sparse reward functions might enable\ntraining more effective cyber defence agents. Towards this goal we first break\ndown several evaluation limitations in existing work by proposing a ground\ntruth evaluation score that goes beyond the standard RL paradigm used to train\nand evaluate agents. By adapting a well-established cyber gym to accommodate\nour methodology and ground truth score, we propose and evaluate two sparse\nreward mechanisms and compare them with a typical dense reward. Our evaluation\nconsiders a range of network sizes, from 2 to 50 nodes, and both reactive and\nproactive defensive actions. Our results show that sparse rewards, particularly\npositive reinforcement for an uncompromised network state, enable the training\nof more effective cyber defence agents. Furthermore, we show that sparse\nrewards provide more stable training than dense rewards, and that both\neffectiveness and training stability are robust to a variety of cyber\nenvironment considerations.",

Existing methods often suffer from compromised performance due to\nredundant information in graph structures, which impairs their ability to\neffectively differentiate between ID and OOD data. To address this challenge,\nwe propose SEGO, an unsupervised framework that integrates structural entropy\ninto OOD detection regarding graph classification.

The obtained coding tree\neffectively removes redundant information from graphs while preserving\nessential structural information, enabling the capture of distinct graph\npatterns between ID and OOD samples. Furthermore, we present a multi-grained\ncontrastive learning scheme at local, global, and tree levels using triplet\nviews, where coding trees with essential information serve as the anchor view.\nExtensive experiments on real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of\nSEGO, demonstrating superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines in OOD\ndetection.

We allow for various\ninitial speeds, from a standstill to a launched start. We accomplish this by\ngeneralizing the discontinuous piecewise constant speed model to a continuous\npiecewise linear speed model. Regardless of the initial speed, steepness or\nprofile of the ascent the optimal strategy tends to a constant ground speed, in\nagreement with the conclusion of the previous, more restricted, formulation.\nThis new formulation allows us to compare various initial-speed strategies and,\nhence, has a direct application to competitive cycling. Notably, in timetrials\ncomposed of flat and steep sections, it helps one decide whether or not to\nchange bicycle, which requires stopping and restarting, from one that is more\nappropriate for flats to one that is more appropriate for uphills.",

Cortical surface reconstruction (CSR), including the inner whiter\nmatter (WM) and outer pial surfaces, is one of the key tasks in dMRI analyses\nsuch as fiber tractography and multimodal MRI analysis. Existing CSR methods\nrely on anatomical T1-weighted data and map them into the dMRI space through\ninter-modality registration. However, due to the low resolution and image\ndistortions of dMRI data, inter-modality registration faces significant\nchallenges. This work proposes a novel end-to-end learning framework, DDCSR,\nwhich for the first time enables CSR directly from dMRI data. DDCSR consists of\ntwo major components, including: (1) an implicit learning module to predict a\nvoxel-wise intermediate surface representation, and (2) an explicit learning\nmodule to predict the 3D mesh surfaces. Compared to several baseline and\nadvanced CSR methods, we show that the proposed DDCSR can largely increase both\naccuracy and efficiency.

However, there\nare a few dwarf galaxies with purely gaseous bars: NGC3741, NGC2915 and DDO168.\nThis is a puzzle as gas is a collisional medium, and a gaseous bar is expected\nto be ripped off by shock waves. We study the formation of gaseous bars in\nthese galaxies by constructing dynamical models constrained by stellar\nphotometry and HI observations already available. We first analytically study\nthe dynamical stability of the galactic disks against global $m=2$\nperturbations. Our results indicate that the stellar and the gas disks are\nmoderately unstable against these bar modes. Using N-body + hydrodynamical\nsimulations employing $RAMSES$, we next find that a purely gaseous bar is\nformed in an oblate dark matter halo of vertical-to-planar axes ratio $c/a =\n0.6 - 0.8$, with a relatively high-spin parameter $\\Lambda = 0.04 - 0.07$,\nwhich survives for more than ten dynamical times. Further, the low values of\nour calculated Mach numbers $M=2-6$ of the gaseous medium comply with the\nsurvival of the gaseous bars, unaffected by shock waves. Interestingly, our\nsimulations show the formation of a tiny stellar bar in each case. However, the\ntemporal evolution of the change in angular momentum $L_z$ of the different\ndisk components indicates the exchange of $L_z$ between the gas disk and the\ndark matter halo only; the $L_z$ of the stellar disk remained unchanged,\nindicating a weak stellar bar.",

    "abstract": "While Large Language Models (LLMs) are fundamentally next-token prediction\nsystems, their practical applications extend far beyond this basic function.\nFrom natural language processing and text generation to conversational\nassistants and software use, LLMs have numerous use-cases, and have already\nacquired a significant degree of enterprise adoption. To evaluate such models,\nstatic evaluation datasets, consisting of a set of prompts and their\ncorresponding ground truths, are often used to benchmark the efficacy of the\nmodel for a particular task. In this paper, we provide the basis for a more\ncomprehensive evaluation framework, based upon a traditional game and\ntool-based architecture that enables a more overarching measurement of a\nmodel's capabilities. For simplicity, we provide a generalized foundation that\ncan be extended, without significant alteration, to numerous scenarios, from\nspecific use cases such as supply chain management or financial reasoning, to\nabstract measurements such as ethics or safety.",

Existing AI-driven translation models prioritize efficiency but\noften fail to capture cultural nuances, idiomatic expressions, and historical\nsignificance, leading to translations that marginalize linguistic diversity. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a multi-agent AI framework designed for\nculturally adaptive translation in underserved language communities.

Theoretical\nmodels suggest that the spin of supermassive black holes drives relativistic\njets. Therefore, we investigate the relationship between black hole spin, star\nformation rate, and black hole mass using a sample of 48 low-redshift\nsupermassive black holes. By performing multiband fitting of spectral energy\ndistribution, we derive the star formation rates and stellar masses of the host\ngalaxies harbouring these supermassive black holes. Our main results are as\nfollows: (i) For black holes with masses \\(M_{\\rm BH} \\lesssim 10^{6.5}\nM_{\\odot}\\), the spin increases with increasing black hole mass, suggesting\nthat black hole growth is primarily driven by gas accretion, particularly in\nthe coherent gas accretion regime. Conversely, for black holes with masses\n\\(M_{\\rm BH} \\gtrsim 10^{7.5} M_{\\odot}\\), the spin decreases with increasing\nblack hole mass, indicating that growth occurs mainly through mergers, inducing\nchaotic accretion. (ii) At low star formation rates, black hole spin increases\nwith increasing star formation rates, consistent with gas accretion. However,\nat high star formation rates, black hole spin decreases with increasing star\nformation rates, suggesting black hole mergers. The value of the black hole\nspin may be used to diagnose the star formation rate of the host galaxies\nthrough active galactic nuclei activities. (iii) Our data and analysis confirm\nthe well-known relation between stellar mass and black hole mass, with the\nfitting function $\\log M_{\\rm BH}=0.57\\log M_{*}+1.94$.",

First, existing methods depend on 3D training data collected\nfrom limited environments, constraining out-of-distribution generalization. The\nsecond issue is the difficulty of estimating metric-scale poses from monocular\ninput. To address these challenges, we introduce Mocap-2-to-3, a novel\nframework that performs multi-view lifting from monocular input by leveraging\n2D data pre-training, enabling the reconstruction of metrically accurate 3D\nmotions with absolute positions. To leverage abundant 2D data, we decompose\ncomplex 3D motion into multi-view syntheses. We first pretrain a single-view\ndiffusion model on extensive 2D datasets, then fine-tune a multi-view model\nusing public 3D data to enable view-consistent motion generation from monocular\ninput, allowing the model to acquire action priors and diversity through 2D\ndata. Furthermore, to recover absolute poses, we propose a novel human motion\nrepresentation that decouples the learning of local pose and global movements,\nwhile encoding geometric priors of the ground to accelerate convergence. This\nenables progressive recovery of motion in absolute space during inference.\nExperimental results on in-the-wild benchmarks demonstrate that our method\nsurpasses state-of-the-art approaches in both camera-space motion realism and\nworld-grounded human positioning, while exhibiting superior generalization\ncapability.

The model is splitted to avoid data uploading to the server and reduce\ncomputing requirements while ensuring data privacy and security. However, the\ntransmission of data between clients and server creates a potential\nvulnerability. In particular, model is vulnerable to intellectual property (IP)\ninfringement such as piracy. Alarmingly, a dedicated copyright protection\nframework tailored for Split Learning models is still lacking. To this end, we\npropose the first copyright protection scheme for Split Learning model,\nleveraging fingerprint to ensure effective and robust copyright protection. The\nproposed method first generates a set of specifically designed adversarial\nexamples. Then, we select those examples that would induce misclassifications\nto form the fingerprint set. These adversarial examples are embedded as\nfingerprints into the model during the training process. Exhaustive experiments\nhighlight the effectiveness of the scheme. This is demonstrated by a remarkable\nfingerprint verification success rate (FVSR) of 100% on MNIST, 98% on CIFAR-10,\nand 100% on ImageNet, respectively. Meanwhile, the model's accuracy only\ndecreases slightly, indicating that the embedded fingerprints do not compromise\nmodel performance.

Verifiers that directly\nrun on mainstream programming languages are currently customized for single\nlanguages. Thus, to verify polyglot systems, one usually translates them into a\ncommon verification language or formalism on which the verifier runs. In this\npaper, we present an alternative approach, PolyVer, which employs abstraction,\ncompositional reasoning, and synthesis to directly perform polyglot\nverification. PolyVer constructs a formal model of the original polyglot system\nas a transition system where the update functions associated with transitions\nare implemented in target languages such as C or Rust. To perform verification,\nPolyVer then connects a model checker for transition systems with\nlanguage-specific verifiers (e.g., for C or Rust) using pre/post-condition\ncontracts for the update functions. These contracts are automatically generated\nby synthesis oracles based on syntax-guided synthesis or large language models\n(LLMs), and checked by the language-specific verifiers. The contracts form\nabstractions of the update functions using which the model checker verifies the\noverall system-level property on the polyglot system model. PolyVer iterates\nbetween counterexample-guided abstraction-refinement (CEGAR) and\ncounterexample-guided inductive synthesis (CEGIS) until the property is\nverified or a true system-level counterexample is found.

Extending the\nanalysis to deep linear networks and circulant full-width convolutions shows\nthat weight sharing merely multiplies learning rates accelerating but not\neliminating the bias whereas local convolution introduces a qualitatively\ndifferent bias. Experiments on Gaussian and natural-image datasets confirm the\nspectral law persists in deep MLP-based UNet.

We\ndemonstrate that our method is able to achieve an F1-score of 92.4% on data\ncollected in a commercial apple orchard and outperforms all baselines and\nablations.",

Yet\nthe subtlety and complexity of texts sourced from online platforms often\ncontaining sarcastic language pose significant challenges for SD algorithms in\naccurately determining the authors stance. This paper addresses this by\nemploying sarcasm for SD. It also tackles the issue of insufficient annotated\ndata for training SD models on new targets by conducting Cross-Target SD\n(CTSD). The proposed approach involves fine-tuning BERT and RoBERTa models\nfollowed by concatenating additional deep learning layers. The approach is\nassessed against various State-Of-The-Art baselines for SD demonstrating\nsuperior performance using publicly available datasets. Notably our model\noutperforms the best SOTA models on both in-domain SD and CTSD tasks even\nbefore the incorporation of sarcasm-detection pre-training. The integration of\nsarcasm knowledge into the model significantly reduces misclassifications of\nsarcastic text elements in SD allowing our model to accurately predict 85% of\ntexts that were previously misclassified without sarcasm-detection pre-training\non in-domain SD. This enhancement contributes to an increase in the models\naverage macro F1-score. The CTSD task achieves performance comparable to that\nof the in-domain task despite using a zero-shot finetuning.

These effects involve integrals over the\ndensity and internal gravitational potentials of the bodies that are\nindependent of the mass and radius of the bodies, but dependent on their\nequations of state. These effects could alter the coefficients in the 3PN\nequations derived using ``point mass'' methods by as much as 100 percent. They\nwere found in independent calculations done at Washington University using the\nDirect Integration of the Relaxed Einstein Equations (DIRE) approach, and at\nthe Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris using the Multipolar post-Minkowskian\n(MPPM) approach. Neither calculation was completed because of the enormous\ncomplexity of the algebraic computations and the limitations of software of the\nday (Maple, Mathematica), and because of an assumption that the effects would\nsomehow cancel or be removable by some transformation. This assumption was\nrooted in the Strong Equivalence Principle (SEP), which would suppress such\neffects up to the stage where tidal interactions become important, effectively\n5PN order for compact bodies. SEP was well supported at lower PN orders and in\nspecial examples. We argue that this assumption needs to be verified by\ncalculations. If the results show that these terms exactly cancel or can be\nabsorbed into renormalized masses or shifted positions of each body, this would\nprovide support for the Strong Equivalence Principle.

We,\nin the present work have modeled liquid Li-Bi system using model potential\nformalism in conjunction with the established theoretical models along with\nsuitable modifications to study structural, elastic and transport properties.\nIn particular, we have treated the effective valence of pure Li and Bi as\nparameters and we have calculated the phase shifts using model potentials\nrather than muffin-tin potential. The results are compared with the results of\nmolecular dynamics simulation and other theoretical models. It is observed that\nthe t-matrix formulation in conjunction with the model potential formalism is\nable to reproduce the correct trends in the electrical resistivity isotherm.\nWhereas the results of Faber-Ziman and Morgan theory are highly underestimated,\nthe non-metallic behavior near the critical composition can be explained\nclearly from the present results of electrical resistivity. Further, phonon\nfrequencies and sound velocities are also estimated.",

    "abstract": "Stance Detection (SD) on social media has emerged as a prominent area of\ninterest with implications for social business and political applications\nthereby garnering escalating research attention within NLP. The inherent\nsubtlety and complexity of texts procured from online platforms pose challenges\nfor SD algorithms in accurately discerning the authors stance. Mostly the\ninclusion of sarcastic and figurative language drastically impacts the\nperformance of SD models. This paper addresses this by employing sarcasm\ndetection intermediate-task transfer learning tailored for SD. The proposed\nmethodology involves the finetuning of BERT and RoBERTa and the concatenation\nof convolutional BiLSTM and dense layers. Rigorous experiments are conducted on\npublicly available datasets to evaluate our transfer-learning framework. The\nperformance of the approach is assessed against various State-Of-The-Art\nbaselines for SD providing empirical evidence of its effectiveness. Notably our\nmodel outperforms the best SOTA models even prior to sarcasm-detection\npretraining. The integration of sarcasm knowledge into the model proves\ninstrumental in mitigating misclassifications of sarcastic textual elements in\nSD. Our model accurately predicts 85% of texts that were previously\nmisclassified by the model without sarcasm-detection pretraining thereby\namplifying the average F1-score of the model. Our experiments also revealed\nthat the success of the transfer-learning framework is contingent upon the\ncorrelation of lexical attributes between the intermediate task and the target\ntask. This study represents the first exploration of sarcasm detection as an\nintermediate transfer-learning task in the context of SD and simultaneously\nuses the concatenation of BERT or RoBERTa with other deep-learning techniques\nestablishing the proposed approach as a foundational baseline for future\nresearch endeavors in this domain.",

    "abstract": "The observations documented in Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) reports play a\ncritical role in describing adversarial behaviors, providing valuable insights\nfor security practitioners to respond to evolving threats. Recent advancements\nof Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in\nvarious cybersecurity applications, including CTI report understanding and\nattack knowledge graph construction. While previous works have proposed\nbenchmarks that focus on the CTI extraction ability of LLMs, the sequential\ncharacteristic of adversarial behaviors within CTI reports remains largely\nunexplored, which holds considerable significance in developing a comprehensive\nunderstanding of how adversaries operate. To address this gap, we introduce\nAttackSeqBench, a benchmark tailored to systematically evaluate LLMs'\ncapability to understand and reason attack sequences in CTI reports. Our\nbenchmark encompasses three distinct Question Answering (QA) tasks, each task\nfocuses on the varying granularity in adversarial behavior. To alleviate the\nlaborious effort of QA construction, we carefully design an automated dataset\nconstruction pipeline to create scalable and well-formulated QA datasets based\non real-world CTI reports. To ensure the quality of our dataset, we adopt a\nhybrid approach of combining human evaluation and systematic evaluation\nmetrics. We conduct extensive experiments and analysis with both fast-thinking\nand slow-thinking LLMs, while highlighting their strengths and limitations in\nanalyzing the sequential patterns in cyber attacks. The overarching goal of\nthis work is to provide a benchmark that advances LLM-driven CTI report\nunderstanding and fosters its application in real-world cybersecurity\noperations.

We\nhave recently shown that the losses in Ta-based resonators are dominated by\ntwo-level systems (TLSs) at low microwave powers and millikelvin temperatures.\nWe also observe that some devices exhibit loss that is exponentially activated\nat a lower temperature inconsistent with the superconducting critical\ntemperature (Tc) of the constituent film. Specifically, dc resistivity\nmeasurements show a Tc of over 4 K, while microwave measurements of resonators\nfabricated from these films show losses that increase exponentially with\ntemperature with an activation energy as low as 0.3 K. Here, we present a\ncomparative study of the structural and thermodynamic properties of Ta-based\nresonators and identify vortex motion-induced loss as the source of thermally\nactivated microwave loss. Through careful magnetoresistance and x-ray\ndiffraction measurements, we observe that the increased loss occurs for films\nthat are in the clean limit, where the superconducting coherence length is\nshorter than the mean free path. Vortex motion-induced losses are suppressed\nfor films in the dirty limit, which show evidence of structural defects that\ncan pin vortices. We verify this hypothesis by explicitly pinning vortices via\npatterning and find that we can suppress the loss by microfabrication.",

The electrification of\nbuildings, manufacturing, and transportation is expected to grow electricity\ndemand substantially over the next decade. Without effectively managed EV\ncharging, EVs could strain energy grid infrastructure and increase electricity\ncosts. Drawing on de-identified 2023 EV telematics data from Rivian Automotive,\nthis study found that 72% of home charging commenced after the customer plugged\nin their vehicle regardless of utility time of use (TOU) tariffs or managed\ncharging programs. In fewer than 26% of charging sessions in the sample, EV\nowners actively scheduled charging times to align or participate in utility\ntariffs or programs. With a majority of drivers concurrently plugged in during\noptimal charging periods yet not actively charging, the study identified an\nopportunity to reduce individual EV owner costs and carbon emissions through\nsmarter charging habits without significant behavioral modifications or\nsacrifice in user preferences. By optimizing home charging schedules within\nexisting plug-in and plug-out windows, the study suggests that EV owners can\nsave an average of $140 annually and reduce the associated carbon emissions of\ncharging their EV by as much as 28%.",

    "abstract": "In the era of time-domain, multi-messenger astronomy, the detection of\ntransient events on the high-energy electromagnetic sky has become more\nimportant than ever. The Gravitational wave high-energy Electromagnetic\nCounterpart All-sky Monitor (GECAM) is a dedicated mission to monitor gamma-ray\ntransients, launched in December, 2020. A real-time on-board trigger and\nlocation software, using the traditional signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) method for\nblind search, is constrained to relatively bright signals due to the\nlimitations in on-board computing resources and the need for real-time search.\nIn this work, we developed a ground-based pipeline for GECAM to search for\nvarious transients, especially for weak bursts missed by on-board software.\nThis pipeline includes both automatic and manual mode, offering options for\nblind search and targeted search. The targeted search is specifically designed\nto search for interesting weak bursts, such as gravitational wave-associated\ngamma-ray bursts (GRBs). From the ground search of the data in the first year,\nGECAM has been triggered by 54 GRBs and other transients, including soft\ngamma-ray repeaters, X-ray binaries, solar flares, terrestrial gamma-ray\nflashes. We report the properties of each type of triggers,such as trigger time\nand light curves. With this search pipeline and assuming a soft Band spectrum,\nthe GRB detection sensitivity of GECAM is increased to about 1.1E-08 erg cm-2\ns-1 (10 keV - 1000 keV, burst duration of 20 s). These results demonstrate that\nthe GECAM ground search system (both blind search and targeted search) is a\nversatile pipeline to recover true astrophysical signals which were too weak to\nbe found in the on-board search.",

Various\nmethods have been proposed for testing, diagnosing, and repairing ML systems.\nHowever, the big picture informing important research directions that really\naddress the dire needs of developers is yet to unfold, leaving several key\nquestions unaddressed: (1) What faults have been targeted in the ML debugging\nresearch that fulfill developers needs in practice? (2) How are these faults\naddressed? (3) What are the challenges in addressing the yet untargeted faults?\n  In this paper, we conduct a systematic study of debugging techniques for\nmachine learning systems. We first collect technical papers focusing on\ndebugging components in machine learning software. We then map these papers to\na taxonomy of faults to assess the current state of fault resolution identified\nin existing literature. Subsequently, we analyze which techniques are used to\naddress specific faults based on the collected papers. This results in a\ncomprehensive taxonomy that aligns faults with their corresponding debugging\nmethods. Finally, we examine previously released transcripts of interviewing\ndevelopers to identify the challenges in resolving unfixed faults. Our analysis\nreveals that only 48 percent of the identified ML debugging challenges have\nbeen explicitly addressed by researchers, while 46.9 percent remain unresolved\nor unmentioned. In real world applications, we found that 52.6 percent of\nissues reported on GitHub and 70.3% of problems discussed in interviews are\nstill unaddressed by research in ML debugging. The study identifies 13 primary\nchallenges in ML debugging, highlighting a significant gap between the\nidentification of ML debugging issues and their resolution in practice.",

We\ndemonstrate this behavior using stochastic simulations as well as the numerical\nintegration of a Fokker-Planck equation that approximates the finite\nsystem-size limit. By combining piecewise-deterministic-Markov and linear-noise\napproximations, we further find analytic expressions for the stationary\ndistributions of the different molecular species when stochastic switching is\nfaster than the dynamics in the total population size.

To address this, we propose a determinantal point process-based\nlearning (DPPL) framework for efficiently solving general subset selection\nproblems in massive networks. The key idea is to model the optimal subset as a\nrealization of a determinantal point process (DPP), which balances the\ntrade-off between quality (signal strength) and similarity (mutual\ninterference) by enforcing negative correlation in the selection of {\\em\nsimilar} links (those that create significant mutual interference).

The effectiveness of the proposed\napproach is demonstrated by applying it to two canonical wireless network\nsettings: an ad hoc network in 2D and a cellular network serving drones in 3D.\nSimulation results show that DPPL selects near-optimal subsets that maximize\nnetwork sum-rate while significantly reducing computational complexity compared\nto traditional optimization methods, demonstrating its scalability for\nlarge-scale networks.",

Depthwise onvolution (DWConv) is widely used\nin efficient CNNs or ViTs, but it needs frequent memory access during\ninference, which leads to low throughput. FasterNet attempts to introduce\npartial convolution (PConv) as an alternative to DWConv but compromises the\naccuracy due to underutilized channels. To remedy this shortcoming and consider\nthe redundancy between feature map channels, we introduce a novel Partial\nvisual ATtention mechanism (PAT) that can efficiently combine PConv with visual\nattention. Our exploration indicates that the partial attention mechanism can\ncompletely replace the full attention mechanism and reduce model parameters and\nFLOPs. Our PAT can derive three types of blocks: Partial Channel-Attention\nblock (PAT_ch), Partial Spatial-Attention block (PAT_sp) and Partial\nSelf-Attention block (PAT_sf). First, PAT_ch integrates the enhanced Gaussian\nchannel attention mechanism to infuse global distribution information into the\nuntouched channels of PConv. Second, we introduce the spatial-wise attention to\nthe MLP layer to further improve model accuracy. Finally, we replace PAT_ch in\nthe last stage with the self-attention mechanism to extend the global receptive\nfield. Building upon PAT, we propose a novel hybrid network family, named\nPATNet, which achieves superior top-1 accuracy and inference speed compared to\nFasterNet on ImageNet-1K classification and excel in both detection and\nsegmentation on the COCO dataset.

The performance of the model\nis validated on two ADS-B datasets, one near the airport terminal area and the\nother in dense airspace. Experimental results demonstrate a notable improvement\nover current 4D trajectory prediction methods, achieving a 20% and 30%\nreduction in the Average Displacement Error (ADE) and Final Displacement Error\n(FDE), respectively. The incorporation of a Dual-Attention module has been\nshown to significantly enhance the extraction of node correlations, as verified\nby ablation experiments.",

Remarkably, the nonlinear VHE has\nmagnitude surpassing the linear VHE and is highly tunable via a gate voltage,\nwhich exhibits a pair of opposite peaks on the two sides of a Dirac gap. The\nnonlinear signal shows quadratic scaling with driving current and quartic\nscaling with local resistance, setting it apart from the linear counterpart.\nThese experimental features are consistent with the theoretical picture of\nnonlocal transport mediated by nonlinear VHE and linear inverse VHE. We further\nreveal a nonlinear inverse VHE by observing the third- and fourth-harmonic\nnonlocal voltages. The nonlinear VHE provides a novel mechanism for valley\nmanipulation and enables a novel valleytronic device, the valley rectifier,\nthat converts AC charge current into DC valley current.",

In\norder to ensure compatibility with the detector's operating temperature range,\nmodules are subjected to thermal cycling as part of their quality control\nprocess. Ten cycles between -35C and +40C are performed for each module, with\nfull electrical characterisation tests at each high and low temperature point.\nAs part of an investigation into the stress experienced by modules during\ncooling, it was observed that modules generally showed a change in module shape\nbefore and after thermal cycling.

Traditionally, 4D surfaces are discretized, in\nspace and time, before computing their spatiotemporal registrations, geodesics,\nand statistics.

The descriptor utilizes local lattice and angular\ndistortions obtained from structural optimization of experimentally known\ncrystalline phases within state-of-the-art density-functional theory method.\nThe predictive power of the descriptor was tested on lanthanide based RE2In\n(RE=rare-earth) compounds known for a variety of phase transformations. We show\nthat the inclusion of quantum-mechanical effects through local-charge, bonding,\nsymmetry, and electronic-structure enhances the robustness of the descriptor in\npredicting structural phase transformation. To gain further insights, we\nanalyzed phononic and electronic behavior of Y2In, and show that experimentally\nobserved phase transformation can only be predicted when atomic strains are\nincluded. The descriptor was used to predict structural phase change in couple\nof new compounds, i.e., (Yb1-xErx)2In and Gd2(In1-xAlx), which was validated by\nX-ray powder diffraction measurements. Finally, we demonstrated the generality\nof the proposed descriptor by predicting phase transformation behavior in\ndifferent classes of compounds indicating the usefulness of our approach in\nmapping desired phase changes in novel functional materials.",

    "abstract": "We study string formation and dynamics in a scalar field theory with a global\n$U(1)$ symmetry. If a scalar field $\\Phi$ is initially displaced from the\nminimum of a wine-bottle potential, even if uniformly over large spatial\npatches, small spatial perturbations to $\\Phi$ grow via parametric resonance as\n$\\Phi$ oscillates; this occurs for a wide range of initial $U(1)$ charge\ndensities. The growth of perturbations leads to the formation of spatially\ncoherent, temporally stable \"counter-rotating regions\" (CRR): spatially\nconnected regions exhibiting $\\Phi$ evolution with large, opposite-sign\nrotation speeds in field space which persist over long durations. These CRR are\nseparated by domain boundaries that have a large field gradient and zero\nrotational speed in field space. String or vortex topological defects form, are\nconfined to, and then annihilate periodically on these boundaries. We\ndemonstrate these periodic dynamics with numerical simulations in both 2+1 and\n3+1 dimensions, in both Minkowski spacetime and in a radiation-dominated FLRW\nuniverse, and we explain some features of the evolution (semi-)analytically. At\nlate times in an expanding universe, when $\\Phi$ approaches the potential\nminimum, the CRR and vortices dissipate into scalar radiation.\nPhenomenologically, periodic bursts of string formation and annihilation can\nlead to periodic bursts of gravitational-wave production. For small initial\n$U(1)$ charge density, these gravitational-wave bursts can be synchronized\nacross the whole Universe. Owing to their periodic nature, they could give rise\nto a gravitational-wave frequency spectrum consisting of a forest of peaks.\nThese periodic scalar field dynamics also occur with large, untuned initial\n$U(1)$ charge density; they may thus have implications for models that depend\non a coherent field rotation, such as kination and the axion\nkinetic-misalignment mechanism.

    "abstract": "Recently, Provenance-based Intrusion Detection Systems (PIDSes) have been\nwidely used for endpoint threat analysis. These studies can be broadly\ncategorized into rule-based detection systems and learning-based detection\nsystems. Among these, due to the evolution of attack techniques, rules cannot\ndynamically model all the characteristics of attackers. As a result, such\nsystems often face false negatives. Learning-based detection systems are\nfurther divided into supervised learning and anomaly detection. The scarcity of\nattack samples hinders the usability and effectiveness of supervised\nlearning-based detection systems in practical applications. Anomaly-based\ndetection systems face a massive false positive problem because they cannot\ndistinguish between changes in normal behavior and real attack behavior. The\nalert results of detection systems are closely related to the manual labor\ncosts of subsequent security analysts. To reduce manual analysis time, we\npropose OMNISEC, which applies large language models (LLMs) to anomaly-based\nintrusion detection systems via retrieval-augmented behavior prompting. OMNISEC\ncan identify abnormal nodes and corresponding abnormal events by constructing\nsuspicious nodes and rare paths. By combining two external knowledge bases,\nOMNISEC uses Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to enable the LLM to\ndetermine whether abnormal behavior is a real attack. Finally, OMNISEC can\nreconstruct the attack graph and restore the complete attack behavior chain of\nthe attacker's intrusion. Experimental results show that OMNISEC outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods on public benchmark datasets.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of the Internet, the information dissemination\nparadigm has changed and the efficiency has been improved greatly. While this\nalso brings the quick spread of fake news and leads to negative impacts on\ncyberspace. Currently, the information presentation formats have evolved\ngradually, with the news formats shifting from texts to multimodal contents. As\na result, detecting multimodal fake news has become one of the research\nhotspots. However, multimodal fake news detection research field still faces\ntwo main challenges: the inability to fully and effectively utilize multimodal\ninformation for detection, and the low credibility or static nature of the\nintroduced external information, which limits dynamic updates. To bridge the\ngaps, we propose ERIC-FND, an external reliable information-enhanced multimodal\ncontrastive learning framework for fake news detection. ERIC-FND strengthens\nthe representation of news contents by entity-enriched external information\nenhancement method. It also enriches the multimodal news information via\nmultimodal semantic interaction method where the multimodal constrative\nlearning is employed to make different modality representations learn from each\nother. Moreover, an adaptive fusion method is taken to integrate the news\nrepresentations from different dimensions for the eventual classification.\nExperiments are done on two commonly used datasets in different languages, X\n(Twitter) and Weibo.

There appears to\nbe a gap between the largest grains that can be produce by coagulation, and the\nsmallest grains that are needed for the streaming instability (SI) to form\nplanetesimals. Here we explore a novel hypothesis: That dust coagulation and\nthe SI work in tandem. That they form a feedback loop where each one boosts the\naction of the other to bridge the gap between dust grains and planetesimals. We\ndevelop a semi-analytical model of dust concentration due to the SI, and an\nanalytic model of how the SI affects the fragmentation and radial drift\nbarriers. We then combine those to model our proposed feedback loop. In the\nfragmentation-limited regime, we find a powerful synergy between the SI and\ndust growth that drastically increases both grain sizes and densities. We find\nthat a midplane dust-to-gas ratio of $\\epsilon \\ge 0.3$ is a sufficient\ncondition for the feedback loop to reach the planetesimal-forming region for\nturbulence values $10^{-4} \\le \\alpha \\le 10^{-3}$ and grain sizes $0.01 \\le\n{\\rm St} \\le 0.1$.

One of the most advanced\nmodels for this task is Vertical Attention Network (VAN), which utilizes a\nVertical Attention Module (VAM) to implicitly segment paragraph text images\ninto text lines, thereby reducing the difficulty of the recognition task.\nHowever, from a network structure perspective, VAM is a single-branch module,\nwhich is less effective in learning compared to multi-branch modules.

The features learned by the multi-branch structure are fused\ninto the single-branch structure through a special fusion method named\nRe-parameterization Fusion (RF) without any loss of information.

Closed-form expressions for\nlong-term average AoI and energy efficiency are derived, explicitly accounting\nfor spatial correlation and state-dependent power consumption. By constraining\nsensors to adopt the same transmission probability, three unified transmission\nstrategies are derived: the age-optimal strategy (q_A^), the energy-efficiency\noptimal strategy (q_E^), and the Pareto-optimal strategy (q^), which jointly\noptimizes AoI and energy efficiency. A bounded exhaustive search with O(1/(n\nq_epsilon)) complexity guarantees efficient computation of q^. Theoretically,\nthe correlation gain is proven to significantly enhance both metrics under\nspatial correlation. To exploit sensor heterogeneity, a gradient-based\niterative algorithm, Multi-Start Projected Adaptive Moment Estimation\n(MS-PAdam), is proposed to jointly optimize all sensors' transmission\nprobabilities, efficiently converging to the optimal AoI-energy-efficiency\ntradeoff. Crucially, MS-PAdam adaptively suppresses transmissions where\nmarginal gains are outweighed by correlated neighbors' contributions,\nsubstantially alleviating competition. Numerical results show MS-PAdam\noutperforms unified strategies, achieving harmonious operation that mitigates\nAoI/energy degradation in contention-intensive scenarios.",

The nature of a\nblack hole can be completely defined by specifying the mass and dimensionless\nspin parameter. Therefore, accurate measurement of the two fundamental\nparameters is important for understanding the nature of black holes. The joint\nspectral fitting of a reflection component with simultaneous observations from\nInsight-HXMT, NICER and NuSTAR reveals for the first time a black hole\ndimensionless spin of $0.84^{+0.17}_{-0.26}$ and an inclination angle of\n$21.1^{+4.5}_{-3.6}$ degree for this system. Monitoring of the soft state by\nNICER results in disk flux and temperature following $F_{\\rm disk} \\propto\nT_{\\rm in}^{3.83\\pm 0.17}$. For the standard thin disk, $L_{\\rm disk}\\approx\n4\\pi R_{\\rm in}^{2}\\sigma T_{\\rm in}^{4}$, so the relationship between the flux\nand temperature of the disk we measured indicates that the inner radius of the\ndisk is stable and the disk is in the Innermost Stable Circular Orbit. With an\nempirical relation built previously between the black hole outburst profile and\nthe intrinsic power output, the source distance is estimated as $5.8\\pm 2.5$\nkpc according to the outburst profile and peak flux observed by Insight-HXMT\nand NICER. Finally, a black hole mass of $3.67\\pm1.79-8.07\\pm 4.20 M_\\odot$ can\nbe inferred from a joint diagnostic of the aforementioned parameters measured\nfor this system. This system is also consistent with most black hole X-ray\nbinaries with high spin and a mass in the range of 5--20 $M_\\odot$",

Traditional embedding-based methods, such as TransE and\nComplEx, have improved tail entity prediction but struggle to generalize to\nunseen entities during testing. Textual-based models mitigate this issue by\nleveraging additional semantic context; however, their reliance on negative\ntriplet sampling introduces high computational overhead, semantic\ninconsistencies, and data imbalance. Recent approaches, like KG-BERT, show\npromise but depend heavily on entity descriptions, which are often unavailable\nin KGs. Critically, existing methods overlook valuable structural information\nin the KG related to the entities and relationships.

Post-training\nquantization (PTQ) has emerged as an effective strategy for efficient\ndeployment, but we identify two key challenges in SAM that hinder the\neffectiveness of existing PTQ methods: the heavy-tailed and skewed distribution\nof post-GELU activations, and significant inter-channel variation in linear\nprojection activations. To address these challenges, we propose AHCPTQ, an\naccurate and hardware-efficient PTQ method for SAM. AHCPTQ introduces\nhardware-compatible Hybrid Log-Uniform Quantization (HLUQ) to manage post-GELU\nactivations, employing log2 quantization for dense small values and uniform\nquantization for sparse large values to enhance quantization resolution.\nAdditionally, AHCPTQ incorporates Channel-Aware Grouping (CAG) to mitigate\ninter-channel variation by progressively clustering activation channels with\nsimilar distributions, enabling them to share quantization parameters and\nimproving hardware efficiency. The combination of HLUQ and CAG not only\nenhances quantization effectiveness but also ensures compatibility with\nefficient hardware execution.

Similarly, key\nproportionality axioms such as Justified Representation (JR), Extended JR\n(EJR), and their strengthened variants (PJR+, EJR+), along with core stability,\ncan fit within this linear structure as well.\n  Leveraging PAC learning theory, we establish general and novel upper bounds\non the sample complexity of learning linear mappings. Our approach yields\nnear-optimal guarantees for diverse classes of rules, including Thiele methods\nand ordered weighted average rules, and can be applied to analyze the sample\ncomplexity of learning proportionality axioms such as approximate core\nstability. Furthermore, the linear structure allows us to leverage prior work\nto extend our analysis beyond worst-case scenarios to study the likelihood of\nvarious properties of linear rules and axioms. We introduce a broad class of\ndistributions that extend Impartial Culture for approval preferences, and show\nthat under these distributions, with high probability, any Thiele method is\nresolute, CORE is non-empty, and any Thiele method satisfies CORE, among other\nobservations on the likelihood of commonly-studied properties in social choice.\n  We believe that this linear theory offers a new perspective and powerful new\ntools for designing and analyzing multi-winner rules in modern social choice\napplications.",

    "abstract": "Cygnus X-1 is a high-mass black hole binary extensively studied since its\ndiscovery in 1964. Its rapid X-ray variability provides insights into accretion\nphysics. Unlike other black hole X-ray binaries, its power spectra are\ngenerally featureless and modeled with two broad Lorentzians, without requiring\nnarrow quasi-periodic oscillations. We investigate the possibility that some\nundetected variability components in power spectra may appear in the imaginary\npart of the cross spectra and the coherence function. Using NICER observations\nup to Cycle 6, we study the power, cross, and lag spectra, along with the\ncoherence function, searching for these \"imaginary\" components. We\nsimultaneously fit the power spectra in two energy bands, 0.3-2 keV and 2-12\nkeV, and the real and imaginary parts of the cross-spectrum with a\nmulti-Lorentzian model. Assuming each Lorentzian is coherent between the two\nbands but incoherent with others, we predict intrinsic coherence and phase\nlags. he intrinsic coherence shows a narrow dip at a frequency increasing from\n~1 Hz to ~6 Hz as the power-law index of the Comptonized component increases\nfrom ~1.8 to ~2.4. Simultaneously, the phase lags exhibit a steep increase (the\n\"cliff\") at the same frequencies. These features vanish when using energy bands\nsimilar to RXTE (e.g., 3-5 keV and 5-12 keV). A narrow Lorentzian component\nwith low fractional rms and large phase lag is required to reproduce the\ncoherence drop. Its rms and phase-lag spectra evolve systematically in the\nhardness-intensity diagram. This \"imaginary\" QPO behaves like a type-C QPO\ndespite being undetectable in power spectra alone. Similar features in MAXI\nJ1348-630 and MAXI J1820+070 support this interpretation, suggesting this may\nbe the first detection of a type-C QPO in Cygnus X-1.",

With the development of automated driving, vehicles\nequipped with Level 2/3 automated driving capabilities will also become a\ncommon presence on the roads. When these vehicles pass through work zones,\nautomated driving may disengage, which can have complex effects on traffic\nsafety. This paper explores the impact of Level 2/3 automated driving\ntechnology on road safety in high-speed highway work zone environments. Through\nmicroscopic traffic simulation method and using full-type traffic conflict\ntechnique, factors such as market penetration rate (MPR), traffic volume level,\ndisengagement threshold, and driver takeover style are studied to understand\ntheir impact on work zone safety. The study found that the impact of automated\ndriving technology on work zone safety is complex. Disengagement of automated\nvehicles in work zones reduces the proportion of vehicles that can maintain\nautomated driving status. If takeover is not timely or adequate, it can easily\nlead to new traffic conflicts. Different factors have varying degrees of impact\non work zone safety.

The ejection of the transient\njet knots coincided with a bright X-ray flare and a drastic change in the X-ray\nspectral and timing properties as seen by HXMT, which is the clearest\nassociation ever seen between the launching of transient relativistic jets in\nan X-ray binary and a sudden change in the X-ray properties of the accretion\ninflow.",

Their\nintrinsic nonlinearities can be strengthened further by coupling QDs to low\nmode-volume photonic nanocavities, enabling low-power, on-chip nonlinear\noptics. In this paper, we demonstrated cavity-enhanced second harmonic\ngeneration via integration of colossal QDs with a silicon nitride nanobeam\ncavity. By pumping the cavity-QD system with an ultrafast pulsed laser, we\nobserved a strong second harmonic generation from the cavity-coupled QD, and we\nestimate an enhancement factor of ~3,040.

Existing approaches either rely on\nheuristics for instantaneous foothold selection--compromising safety and\nversatility--or solve expensive trajectory optimization problems with complex\nterrain features and long time horizons. In contrast, our framework leverages\nreactive synthesis to generate correct-by-construction controllers at the\nsymbolic level, and mixed-integer convex programming (MICP) for dynamic and\nphysically feasible footstep planning for each symbolic transition. We use a\nhigh-level manager to reduce the large state space in synthesis by\nincorporating local environment information, improving synthesis scalability.\nTo handle specifications that cannot be met due to dynamic infeasibility, and\nto minimize costly MICP solves, we leverage a symbolic repair process to\ngenerate only necessary symbolic transitions. During online execution,\nre-running the MICP with real-world terrain data, along with runtime symbolic\nrepair, bridges the gap between offline synthesis and online execution. We\ndemonstrate, in simulation, our framework's capabilities to discover missing\nlocomotion skills and react promptly in safety-critical environments, such as\nscattered stepping stones and rebars.",

In this paper, we propose\nan environment-aware dynamic pruning system that handles the unpredictability\nof edge inference pipelines. While traditional pruning approaches can reduce\nmodel footprint and compute requirements, they are often performed only once,\noffline, and are not designed to react to transient or post-deployment device\nconditions. Similarly, existing pipeline placement strategies may incur high\noverhead if reconfigured at runtime, limiting their responsiveness. Our\napproach allows slices of a model, already placed on a distributed pipeline, to\nbe ad-hoc pruned as a means of load-balancing. To support this capability, we\nintroduce two key components: (1) novel training strategies that endow models\nwith robustness to post-deployment pruning, and (2) an adaptive algorithm that\ndetermines the optimal pruning level for each node based on monitored\nbottlenecks. In real-world experiments on a Raspberry Pi 4B cluster running\ncamera-trap workloads, our method achieves a 1.5x speedup and a 3x improvement\nin service-level objective (SLO) attainment, all while maintaining high\naccuracy.",

    "abstract": "Tomography is a central tool in medical applications, allowing doctors to\ninvestigate patients' interior features. The Radon transform (in two\ndimensions) is commonly used to model the measurement process in parallel-beam\nCT. Suitable discretization of the Radon transform and its adjoint (called the\nbackprojection) is crucial. The most commonly used discretization approach\ncombines the ray-driven Radon transform with the pixel-driven backprojection,\nas anecdotal reports describe these as showing the best approximation\nperformance. However, there is little rigorous understanding of induced\napproximation errors. These methods involve three discretization parameters:\nthe spatial-, detector-, and angular resolutions. Most commonly, balanced\nresolutions are used, i.e., the same (or similar) spatial- and detector\nresolutions are employed. We present a novel interpretation of ray- and\npixel-driven discretizations as `convolutional methods'. This allows for a\nstructured analysis that can explain observed behavior. In particular, we prove\nconvergence in the strong operator topology of the ray-driven Radon transform\nand the pixel-driven backprojection under balanced resolutions, thus\ntheoretically justifying this approach. In particular, with high enough\nresolutions one can approximate the Radon transform arbitrarily well.",

    "abstract": "In the early stages of architectural design, shoebox models are typically\nused as a simplified representation of building structures but require\nextensive operations to transform them into detailed designs. Generative\nartificial intelligence (AI) provides a promising solution to automate this\ntransformation, but ensuring multi-view consistency remains a significant\nchallenge. To solve this issue, we propose a novel three-stage consistent image\ngeneration framework using generative AI models to generate architectural\ndesigns from shoebox model representations. The proposed method enhances\nstate-of-the-art image generation diffusion models to generate multi-view\nconsistent architectural images. We employ ControlNet as the backbone and\noptimize it to accommodate multi-view inputs of architectural shoebox models\ncaptured from predefined perspectives. To ensure stylistic and structural\nconsistency across multi-view images, we propose an image space loss module\nthat incorporates style loss, structural loss and angle alignment loss. We then\nuse depth estimation method to extract depth maps from the generated multi-view\nimages. Finally, we use the paired data of the architectural images and depth\nmaps as inputs to improve the multi-view consistency via the depth-aware 3D\nattention module. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework\ncan generate multi-view architectural images with consistent style and\nstructural coherence from shoebox model inputs.",

    "abstract": "Studying the gas content of post-starburst (PSB) galaxies can provide\nvaluable clues regarding the process of fast quenching. Although previous works\nhave studied the molecular gas content of PSBs, only a handful of HI\nmeasurements exist. Here, we present new Five hundred metre Aperture Spherical\nTelescope (FAST) 21cm observations of 44 PSBs, leading to 43 detections or\nsensitive upper limits of HI, which we combine with 25 archival measurements,\nfor a total sample of 68 PSB MHI measurements. HI is detected in 57/68\ngalaxies, with HI masses ranging from MHI ~10^8.5 up to 10^10 Msun and gas\nfractions (fHI = MHI/M*) from a few percent up to almost 30 percent.\nPost-starbursts therefore retain ample atomic gas reservoirs, despite no longer\nforming stars. By comparing with a stellar mass-matched sample of star-forming\ngalaxies in xGASS, we find that PSBs have, on average, gas fractions lower by\n~0.2-0.4 dex, consistent with a mild reduction compared with their progenitor\npopulation. However, PSBs show a diversity of HI properties; about half have HI\ngas masses within the expected scatter of the star-forming population with the\nremaining 50 per cent up to a factor of 10 more gas-poor. Compared with\ngalaxies in the green valley, about two thirds of PSBs have gas fractions\nwithin the expected range, with the remaining third up to a factor of 10 more\ngas-rich. Our results demonstrate that quenching in PSBs is not the result of\nwholesale removal of the atomic gas reservoir and that the population has\natomic gas fractions that span the range from star-forming to green valley\ngalaxies. We find no correlation between HI gas mass and time since burst; even\ngalaxies a Gyr past their burst can remain HI-normal. The significant gas\nreservoirs remaining in many PSBs leaves open the possibility for future\nrekindling of star formation.",

However, applying conventional inverse-variance weighted methods to\nmeta-analyze outcome measures based on median survival is often challenging\nbecause within-study standard error estimates are typically not available in\nthis setting. In this article, we consider an inverse-variance weighted\napproach to meta-analyze median survival times that estimates the within-study\nstandard errors from the reported confidence intervals. We conduct a series of\nsimulation studies evaluating the performance of this approach at the study\nlevel (i.e., for estimating the standard error of median survival) and the\nmeta-analytic level (i.e., for estimating the pooled median, difference of\nmedians, and ratio of medians). We find that this approach often performs\ncomparable to a benchmark approach that uses the true within-study standard\nerrors for meta-analyzing median-based outcome measures.
