    "abstract": "Interacting particle systems of interest in evolutionary game theory\nintroduced in the probability literature consist of variants of the voter model\nin which each site is occupied by one player. The goal of this paper is to\ninitiate the study of evolutionary games based more realistically on the\nmultitype contact process in which each site is either empty or occupied by a\nplayer following one of two possible competing strategies. Like in the\nsymmetric multitype contact process, players have natural death rate one and\nnatural birth rate $\\lambda$. Following the traditional modeling approach of\nevolutionary game theory, the process also depends on a payoff matrix $A =\n(a_{ij})$ where $a_{ij}$ represents the payoff a type $i$ player receives from\neach of its type $j$ neighbors, and the actual birth rate is an increasing\nfunction of the payoff. Using various couplings and block constructions, we\nfirst prove the existence of a phase transition in the direction of the intra\npayoff $a_{11}$ or $a_{22}$ while the other three payoffs are fixed. We also\nlook at the behavior near the critical point where all four payoffs are equal\nto zero, in which case the system reduces to the symmetric multitype contact\nprocess. The effects of the intra payoffs $a_{11}$ and $a_{22}$ are studied\nusing various couplings and duality techniques, while the effects of the inter\npayoffs $a_{12}$ and $a_{21}$ are studied in one dimension using a coupling\nwith the contact process to control the interface between the 1s and the 2s.",

Model performance was compared by simulation of\npassive flexion, knee laxity and a clinically relevant pivot shift. Performance\nwas similar with differences during simulated anterior-posterior laxity tests\nof less than 2.5 mm. Additionally, model predictions of a pivot shift were\nsimilar with differences less than 3 deg or 3 mm for rotations and\ntranslations, respectively. Still, differences in the predicted ligament loads\nand calibrated material properties emerged, highlighting a need for methods to\ninclude ligament load as part of the underlying calibration process.

However, these methods\ncan be slow in high-dimensional and complex scenes and produce non-smooth\nsolutions. Given previously solved path-planning problems, it is highly\ndesirable to learn their distribution and use it as a prior for new similar\nproblems. Several works propose utilizing this prior to bootstrap the motion\nplanning problem, either by sampling initial solutions from it, or using its\ndistribution in a maximum-a-posterior formulation for trajectory optimization.\nIn this work, we introduce Motion Planning Diffusion (MPD), an algorithm that\nlearns trajectory distribution priors with diffusion models. These generative\nmodels have shown increasing success in encoding multimodal data and have\ndesirable properties for gradient-based motion planning, such as cost guidance.\nGiven a motion planning problem, we construct a cost function and sample from\nthe posterior distribution using the learned prior combined with the cost\nfunction gradients during the denoising process. Instead of learning the prior\non all trajectory waypoints, we propose learning a lower-dimensional\nrepresentation of a trajectory using linear motion primitives, particularly\nB-spline curves.

    "abstract": "Adversarial Training (AT) has been demonstrated to improve the robustness of\ndeep neural networks (DNNs) against adversarial attacks. AT is a min-max\noptimization procedure where in adversarial examples are generated to train a\nmore robust DNN. The inner maximization step of AT increases the losses of\ninputs with respect to their actual classes. The outer minimization involves\nminimizing the losses on the adversarial examples obtained from the inner\nmaximization. This work proposes a standard-deviation-inspired (SDI)\nregularization term to improve adversarial robustness and generalization. We\nargue that the inner maximization in AT is similar to minimizing a modified\nstandard deviation of the model's output probabilities. Moreover, we suggest\nthat maximizing this modified standard deviation can complement the outer\nminimization of the AT framework. To support our argument, we experimentally\nshow that the SDI measure can be used to craft adversarial examples.\nAdditionally, we demonstrate that combining the SDI regularization term with\nexisting AT variants enhances the robustness of DNNs against stronger attacks,\nsuch as CW and Auto-attack, and improves generalization.",

Previous efforts have\nprimarily focussed on spontaneously occurring electro-mechanical failures in\nthe sensors and actuators of a minority sub-population of robots. While the\nsystems that enable this function are valuable, they have not yet considered\nthat many failures arise from gradual wear and tear with continued operation,\nand that this may be more challenging to detect than sudden step changes in\nperformance. This paper presents the Artificial Antibody Population Dynamics\n(AAPD) model -- an immune-inspired model for the detection and diagnosis of\ngradual degradation in robot swarms. The AAPD model is demonstrated to reliably\ndetect and diagnose gradual degradation, as well as spontaneous changes in\nperformance, among swarms of robots of varying sizes while remaining tolerant\nof normally behaving robots. The AAPD model is distributed, offers supervised\nand unsupervised configurations, and demonstrates promising scalable\nproperties. Deploying the AAPD model on a swarm of foraging robots undergoing\ngradual degradation enables the swarm to operate on average at between 70% -\n97% of its performance in perfect conditions and is able to prevent instances\nof robots failing in the field during experiments in most of the cases tested.",

Complex\norganic molecules (COMs) offer an avenue for studying star formation across the\nlow- to high-mass spectrum because COMs are found in every young stellar object\nphase and offer insight into the structure and temperature. We aim to unveil\nevolutionary patterns of COM chemistry in 41 massive young stellar objects\n(MYSOs) sourced from diverse catalogues, using ALMA Band 6 spectra. Previous\nline analysis of these sources showed the presence of CH$_3$OH, CH$_3$CN, and\nCH$_3$CCH with diverse excitation temperatures and column densities, indicating\na possible evolutionary path across sources. However, this analysis usually\ninvolves manual line extraction and rotational diagram fitting. Here, we\nimprove upon this process by directly retrieving the physicochemical state of\nMYSOs from their dimensionally-reduced spectra. We use a Locally Linear\nEmbedding to find a lower-dimensional projection for the physicochemical\nparameters obtained from individual line analysis. We identify clusters of\nsimilar MYSOs in this embedded space using a Gaussian Mixture Model. We find\nthree groups of MYSOs with distinct physicochemical conditions: i) cold,\nCOM-poor sources, ii) warm, medium-COM-abundance sources, and iii) hot,\nCOM-rich sources. We then apply principal component analysis (PCA) to the\nspectral sample, finding further evidence for an evolutionary path across MYSO\ngroups. Finally, we find that the physicochemical state of our sample can be\nderived directly from the spectra by training a simple random forest model on\nthe first few PCA components.

Besides proposing this new property, we propose the\noptimization problem of finding a winning committee that achieves the maximum\npossible (E)JR degree, called \\MDJR and \\MDEJR, corresponding to JR and EJR\nrespectively.\n  We study the computational complexity and approximability of \\MDJR of \\MDEJR.\nAn (E)JR committee, which can be found in polynomial time, straightforwardly\ngives a $(k/n)$-approximation. We also show that the original algorithms for\nfinding a JR and an EJR winner committee are also $1/k$ and $1/(k+1)$\napproximation algorithms for \\MDJR and \\MDEJR respectively. On the other hand,\nwe show that it is NP-hard to approximate \\MDJR and \\MDEJR to within a factor\nof $\\left(k/n\\right)^{1-\\epsilon}$ and to within a factor of\n$(1/k)^{1-\\varepsilon}$, for any $\\epsilon>0$, which complements the positive\nresults. Next, we study the fixed-parameter-tractability of this problem. We\nshow that both problems are W[2]-hard if $k$, the size of the winning\ncommittee, is specified as the parameter. However, when $c_{\\text{max}}$, the\nmaximum value of $c$ such that a committee that provides an (E)JR degree of $c$\nexists, is additionally given as a parameter, we show that both \\MDJR and\n\\MDEJR are fixed-parameter-tractable.",

    "abstract": "The landscape of digital servitization in the manufacturing sector is\nevolving, marked by a strategic shift from traditional product-centric to\nplatform business models (BMs). Manufacturing firms often employ a blend of\napproaches to develop business-to-business (B2B) platforms, leading to\nsignificant reconfigurations in their BMs. However, they frequently encounter\nfailures in their B2B platform development initiatives, leading them to abandon\ninitial efforts and pivot to alternative platform strategies. Therefore, this\nstudy, through an in-depth case study of a manufacturer in the energy sector,\narticulates a three-phase pivoting framework for B2B platform BMs, including\nplatform development and platform strategy. Initially, the manufacturer focused\non asset-based product sales supplemented by asset maintenance services and\nfollowed an emergent platformization strategy characterized by the rise of\nmultiple, independent B2B platforms catering to diverse functions. Next,\nfocusing on the imposed customer journey strategy, the firm shifted towards a\nstrategic multi-platform integration into an all-encompassing platform\nsupported by artificial intelligence (AI), signaling a maturation of the\nplatform BM to combine a wide range of services into an\nenergy-performance-based contract. Finally, the last step of the firm's\nplatform BM evolution consisted of a deliberate platform strategy open to\nexternal stakeholders and enveloping its data-driven offerings within a broader\nplatform ecosystem. This article advances B2B platform BMs and digital\nservitization literature, highlighting the efficacy of a progressive approach\nand strategic pivoting.",

    "abstract": "The precise simulation of turbulent flows holds immense significance across\nvarious scientific and engineering domains, including climate science,\nfreshwater science, and energy-efficient manufacturing. Within the realm of\nsimulating turbulent flows, large eddy simulation (LES) has emerged as a\nprevalent alternative to direct numerical simulation (DNS), offering\ncomputational efficiency. However, LES cannot accurately capture the full\nspectrum of turbulent transport scales and is present only at a lower spatial\nresolution. Reconstructing high-fidelity DNS data from the lower-resolution LES\ndata is essential for numerous applications, but it poses significant\nchallenges to existing super-resolution techniques, primarily due to the\ncomplex spatio-temporal nature of turbulent flows. This paper proposes a novel\nflow reconstruction approach that leverages physical knowledge to model flow\ndynamics. Different from traditional super-resolution techniques, the proposed\napproach uses LES data only in the testing phase through a degradation-based\nrefinement approach to enforce physical constraints and mitigate cumulative\nreconstruction errors over time. Furthermore, a feature sampling strategy is\ndeveloped to enable flow data reconstruction across different resolutions. The\nresults on two distinct sets of turbulent flow data indicate the effectiveness\nof the proposed method in reconstructing high-resolution DNS data, preserving\nthe inherent physical attributes of flow transport, and achieving DNS\nreconstruction at different resolutions.",

    "abstract": "With increasing aging problems of advanced technologies, in-field testing\nbecomes an inevitable challenge, on top of the already demanding requirements,\nsuch as the ISO26262 for automotive safety. SOCs used in space, automotive or\nmilitary applications in particular are worst affected as the in-field failures\nin these applications could even be life threatening. We focus on on-line and\nin-field testing for Single Event Upsets (SEU, caused by a single ionizing\nparticle) and aging defects (such as delay variation and stuck-at faults) which\nmay appear during normal operation of the device. Interrupting normal\noperations for aging defects testing is a major challenge for the OS.\nAdditionally, checkpointing with rollback-recovery can be costly and mission\ncritical data can be lost in case of an SEU event. We eliminate many of these\nproblems with our non-interfering in-field testing and recovery solution.\n  We apply a hardware performance improvement technique called System Hyper\nPipelining (SHP), which combines well-known context switching (Barrel CPU) and\nC-slow retiming techniques. The SoC is enhanced with an SEU detection and\nultra-fast recovery mechanism. We also use an RTL ATPG framework that enables\nthe generation of software-based self-tests to achieve 100% coverage of all\ntestable stuck-at-faults. The paper finishes with very promising\nperformance-per-area and test-cycles-per-net results.

The data\nwere collected at COMPASS at CERN using 160 GeV/$c$ longitudinally polarised\n$\\mu^+$ and $\\mu^-$ beams scattering off a 2.5 m long liquid hydrogen target.\nFrom the average of the measured $\\mu^+$ and $\\mu^-$ cross sections, the\nvirtual-photon--proton cross section is determined as a function of the squared\nfour-momentum transfer between the initial and final state proton in the range\n0.08 (GeV/$c$)$^{\\rm\\, 2}$ $< |t| <$ 0.64 (GeV/$c$)$^{\\rm\\, 2}$. From its\nangular distribution, the combined contribution of transversely and\nlongitudinally polarised photons are determined, as well as\ntransverse--transverse and longitudinal--transverse interference contributions.\nThey are studied as functions of four-momentum transfer $|t|$, photon\nvirtuality $Q^2$ and virtual-photon energy $\\nu$. The longitudinal--transverse\ninterference contribution is found to be compatible with zero. The significant\ntransverse--transverse interference contribution reveals the existence of a\ndominant contribution by transversely polarized photons. This provides clear\nexperimental evidence for the chiral-odd GPD $\\overline{E}_T$. In addition, the\nexistence of a non-negligible contribution of longitudinally polarized photons\nis suggested by the $|t|$-dependence of the cross section at $x_{\\rm Bj} < $\n0.1 .

Our approach derives\nthe electron's stochastic equation of motion from the Fokker-Planck equation\nwhile ensuring the particle always maintains a definite - albeit random -\nposition. This feature obviates the need for wave function collapse as invoked\nin the Copenhagen interpretation. Instead, the wave function serves as a tool\nto compute the electron's drift velocity. Building on this, we develop modified\nstochastic equations in spherical coordinates, tailored to the spherical\nsymmetry of the hydrogen atom. We show that these equations reproduce the\ncorrect average radial and angular kinetic energies, matching operator-based\nquantum mechanical predictions. Numerical simulations confirm the stability of\nelectron trajectories and, as expected, recover the probability distribution\nprescribed by the Born rule. At very short timescales, however, single-electron\nprobability distributions may deviate from wave function-based predictions due\nto insufficient ensemble averaging. Taken together, these findings offer an\nalternative perspective on atomic structure and highlight the potential of\nusing wave function-derived drift velocities within a single stochastic process\nto capture quantum dynamics in the hydrogen atom.",

    "abstract": "Due to the exponential growth of information and the need for efficient\ninformation consumption the task of summarization has gained paramount\nimportance. Evaluating summarization accurately and objectively presents\nsignificant challenges, particularly when dealing with long and unstructured\ntexts rich in content. Existing methods, such as ROUGE (Lin, 2004) and\nembedding similarities, often yield scores that have low correlation with human\njudgements and are also not intuitively understandable, making it difficult to\ngauge the true quality of the summaries. LLMs can mimic human in giving\nsubjective reviews but subjective scores are hard to interpret and justify.\nThey can be easily manipulated by altering the models and the tones of the\nprompts. In this paper, we introduce a novel evaluation methodology and tooling\ndesigned to address these challenges, providing a more comprehensive, accurate\nand interpretable assessment of summarization outputs. Our method (SumAutoEval)\nproposes and evaluates metrics at varying granularity levels, giving objective\nscores on 4 key dimensions such as completeness, correctness, Alignment and\nreadability. We empirically demonstrate, that SumAutoEval enhances the\nunderstanding of output quality with better human correlation.",

Two-dimensional\nsteady flow problem in a vertical channel is considered, in which both the\npressure gradient and gravity drive the suspension flow. Dependence of the\nvelocity profile and particle concentration across the channel on the fluid\nrheology parameters and orientation of the pressure gradient is investigated.\nIt is found that the non-uniform particle distribution in the flow across the\nchannel leads to the non-uniform density of the suspension, which causes\nsinkage of the denser regions and promotes downward migration of the particles\neven without slip velocity. Particle and suspension fluxes are calculated for\nvarious fluid rheologies and pressure gradient orientations. The effect of slip\nvelocity between the phases is added via filtration term that captures fluid\nflow once particles reach the maximum concentration and stall, and via the\nsettling term that describes gravitational particle settling.",

    "abstract": "Establishing a robust connection model between emission-line galaxies (ELGs)\nand their host dark haloes is of paramount importance in anticipation of\nupcoming redshift surveys. We propose a novel halo occupation distribution\n(HOD) framework that incorporates galaxy luminosity, a key observable\nreflecting ELG star-formation activity, into the galaxy occupation model. This\ninnovation enables prediction of galaxy luminosity functions (LFs) and\nfacilitates joint analyses using both angular correlation functions (ACFs) and\nLFs. Using physical information from luminosity, our model provides more robust\nconstraints on the ELG-halo connection compared to methods relying solely on\nACF and number density constraints. Our model was applied to [O II]-emitting\ngalaxies observed at two redshift slices at $z=1.193$ and $1.471$ from the\nSubaru Hyper Suprime-Cam PDR2. Our model effectively reproduces observed ACFs\nand LFs observed in both redshift slices. Compared to the established\n\\citeauthor{geach12} HOD model, our approach offers a more nuanced depiction of\nELG occupation across halo mass ranges, suggesting a more realistic\nrepresentation of ELG environments. Our findings suggest that ELGs at\n$z\\sim1.4$ may evolve into Milky-Way-like galaxies, as their inferred halo\nmasses evolve accordingly based on the extended Press--Schechter formalism,\nhighlighting their role as potential building blocks in galaxy formation\nscenarios. By incorporating the LF as a constraint linking galaxy luminosity to\nhalo properties, our HOD model provides a more precise understanding of\nELG-host halo relationships. Furthermore, this approach facilitates the\ngeneration of high-quality ELG mock catalogues of for future surveys. As the LF\nis a fundamental observable, our framework is potentially applicable to diverse\ngalaxy populations, offering a versatile tool for analysing data from\nnext-generation galaxy surveys.",

Specifically,\nsub-MeV ALPs would generate photons with energies $\\sim 30$ MeV, which could be\nobserved by Super-Kamiokande and Hyper-Kamiokande as a delayed signal after a\nfuture detection of SN neutrinos. We apply this to a hypothetical neighbouring\nSN (at a maximum distance of 100 kpc) and demonstrate that the region in the\nparameter space with ALP masses between $10^{-4}$ MeV and $1$ MeV and\nALP-proton couplings in the range $3 \\times 10^{-6}-4 \\times 10^{-5}$ could be\nprobed.

Intuitively, it should become increasingly difficult to\nestimate the precise value of time by making measurements on the state. We use\na quantity called the Fisher information from quantum metrology to quantify the\nminimum uncertainty in estimating time. Due to unitarity, the uncertainty in\nthe time estimate does not grow with time if we have access to optimal\nmeasurements on the full system. Restricting the measurements to act on a small\nsubsystem or to have low computational complexity leads to results expected\nfrom equilibration, where the time uncertainty becomes large at late times.\nWith optimal measurements on a subsystem larger than half of the system, we\nregain the ability to estimate the time very precisely, even at late times.\n  Hawking's calculation for the reduced density matrix of the black hole\nradiation in semiclassical gravity contradicts our general predictions for\nunitary quantum chaotic systems. Hawking's state always has a large uncertainty\nfor attempts to estimate the time using the radiation, whereas our general\nresults imply that the uncertainty should become small after the Page time.\nThis gives a new version of the black hole information loss paradox in terms of\nthe time estimation task. By restricting to simple measurements on the\nradiation, the time uncertainty becomes large. This indicates from a new\nperspective that the observations of computationally bounded agents are\nconsistent with the semiclassical effective description of gravity.",

However, quantum mechanical\nfluctuations of the optical carrier impose fundamental performance limits on\nthe precision of traditional classical laser frequency combs, particularly in\ntheir use for interferometry and spectroscopy. Entanglement, as a\nquintessential quantum resource, allows for surpassing the fundamental limits\nof classical systems. Here, we introduce and experimentally demonstrate\nentangled dual-comb spectroscopy (EDCS) that surmounts the fundamental limits\nof classical DCS. EDCS builds on tailored entangled spectral structures of the\nfrequency combs, enabling simultaneous detection of all comb lines below the\nstandard quantum limit of classical DCS. Applying EDCS in gas detection, we\nachieve a 2.6 dB enhancement in signal-to-noise ratio and a 1.7-fold reduction\nin integration time over classical DCS, rendering EDCS particularly suited for\ndynamic chemical and biological sensing, where fast, precise measurements\nsubject to power constraints are required. EDCS represents a new paradigm for\nquantum frequency combs, underscoring their prospects in a plethora of\napplications in precision metrology, spectroscopy, and timekeeping.",

    "abstract": "One of the simplest extensions of the Standard Model is the Higgs portal\nextension involving a dark Higgs. Dark sectors that include dark matter\ncandidates, WIMPs, axions, and dark photons, can naturally have this type of\ninteraction, where the dark Higgs is charged under some symmetry, which may or\nmay not be spontaneous broken by the vacuum expectation value. In this paper,\nusing lattice simulations, I show that if the reheating temperature of the\nUniverse is sufficiently high, topological defects such as domain walls and\ncosmic strings associated with these symmetries are naturally formed even if\nthe symmetries are never restored due to negative thermal mass squareds. This\noccurs due to the early Universe's non-adiabatic oscillation of the Higgs\naround the onset of oscillation, which overshoots the origin, and tachyonic\ninstability that enhances fluctuations. The gravitational waves generated by\nthese topological defects may be very significant due to the energetic\nprocesses induced by matter effects in the hot and dense Universe irrelevant to\nthe typical energy scale of the dark sector in the vacuum or whether the\nsymmetry is broken in the vacuum. Alongside earlier studies such as usual phase\ntransition, melting domain walls and melting cosmic strings scenarios that\nassume a symmetric phase in the early Universe, the Higgs portal models\nnaturally predict local overdensities from topological defects, which may\ninduce miniclusters and primordial black holes, as well as the gravitational\nwaves.These phenomena provide novel opportunities to search for such scenarios.\nI also perform various numerical simulations for the relevant topic including\nmelting domain walls and cosmic strings with inflationary and Gaussian\nfluctuations, for comparison--which have not been performed previously.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning is currently reaching outstanding performances on different\ntasks, including image classification, especially when using large neural\nnetworks. The success of these models is tributary to the availability of large\ncollections of labeled training data. In many real-world scenarios, labeled\ndata are scarce, and their hand-labeling is time, effort and cost demanding.\nActive learning is an alternative paradigm that mitigates the effort in\nhand-labeling data, where only a small fraction is iteratively selected from a\nlarge pool of unlabeled data, and annotated by an expert (a.k.a oracle), and\neventually used to update the learning models. However, existing active\nlearning solutions are dependent on handcrafted strategies that may fail in\nhighly variable learning environments (datasets, scenarios, etc). In this work,\nwe devise an adaptive active learning method based on Markov Decision Process\n(MDP). Our framework leverages deep reinforcement learning and active learning\ntogether with a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) in order to\ndynamically adapt sample selection strategies to the oracle's feedback and the\nlearning environment. Extensive experiments conducted on three different image\nclassification benchmarks show superior performances against several existing\nactive learning strategies.",

We introduce novel feature engineering techniques\nincluding indicator-price slope ratios and differences of close and open prices\ndivided by the corresponding 14-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA),\ndesigned to capture market dynamics and enhance predictive accuracy.\nAdditionally, we test seven different feature and target variable\ntransformation methods, including returns, logarithmic returns, EMA ratios and\ntheir standardized counterparts as well as EMA difference ratios, so as to\nidentify the most effective ones weighing in both efficiency and accuracy. The\nresults demonstrate Log Returns, Returns and EMA Difference Ratio constitute\nthe best target variable transformation methods, with EMA ratios having a lower\npercentage of correct directional forecasts, and standardized versions of\ntarget variable transformations requiring significantly more training time.\nMoreover, the introduced features demonstrate high feature importance in\npredictive performance across all target variable transformation methods.

    "abstract": "Recent developments for the consistent embedding of general 4D static and\nspherically-symmetric spacetimes in arbitrary single-brane braneworld models in\nthe form of the General Embedding Algorithm (GEA) [Phys.Rev.D 109 (2024) 4,\nL041501], initiated the program of studying the bulk structure of braneworld\nwormholes. In this article, adopting a completely generic approach, we derive\nthe general conditions that the metric functions of any braneworld spacetime\nmust satisfy to describe a wormhole structure in the bulk. Particular emphasis\nis placed on clarifying the proper uplift of 4D spacetimes, expressed in terms\nof arbitrary radial coordinates on the brane, and we demonstrate the important\nrole of the circumferential radius metric function $r(u)$ for the embedding. To\nensure applicability even when $r(u)$ is non-invertible, we develop an extended\nformulation of the GEA. Additionally, the flare-out conditions for braneworld\nwormholes are presented for the first time and are found to differ from the\ncase of flat extra dimensions. To illustrate the method, we first perform the\nuplift into both thin (Randall-Sundrum II) and thick braneworld models for four\nwell-known 4D wormhole spacetimes: the effective braneworld wormhole solutions\nof Casadio-Fabbri-Mazzacurati and Bronnikov-Kim, the Simpson-Visser spacetime,\nand the Ellis-Bronnikov or \"anti-Fisher\" solution. Subsequently, we study their\nbulk features by means of curvature invariants, flare-out conditions, energy\nconditions and embedding diagrams. Our analysis reveals that the assumption of\na warped extra dimension has non-trivial implications for the structure of 5D\nwormholes.",

To do this we build on\nprevious work to identify and correct for errors that arise from limited sample\nsize. Importantly, our approach accurately recovers $D_{KL} = 0$ in systems\nthat adhere to detailed balance, and the correct nonzero $D_{KL}$ for data\ngenerated by well understood models of nonequilibrium systems. We apply our\nmethod to trajectories of neural activity in the retina as it responds to\nnaturalistic inputs, and find evidence of irreversibility in single neurons,\nemphasizing the non-Markovian character of these data.

We argue,\nhowever, that FFDE and FN4 can better represent the development of inconsistent\nand incomplete information states (i.e., configurations of a database) over\ntime than their non-free versions. First, because they allow for empty domains,\nwhich corresponds to the idea that a database may acknowledge no individual at\nall at an early stage of its development. Second, because they allow for empty\nnames, which get interpreted as information about new individuals is inserted\ninto the database.

In cooperative scenarios, the cost function of the\nlocalization problem becomes increasingly nonlinear and nonconvex due to the\nheightened interaction between sensor nodes, making the estimation of the\npositions of the target nodes more challenging. Although most of existing\ncooperative localization algorithms assure acceptable localization accuracy,\ntheir computational complexity increases dramatically, which may restrict their\napplicability. To reduce the computational complexity and provide competitive\nlocalization accuracy at the same time, we propose a localization algorithm\nbased on the differential evolution with multiple populations, opposite-based\nlearning, redirection, and anchoring. In this work, the cooperative\nlocalization cost function is split into several simpler cost functions, each\nof which accounts only for one individual target node. Then, each cost function\nis solved by a dedicated population of the proposed algorithm. In addition, an\nenhanced version of the proposed algorithm which incorporates the population\nmidpoint scheme for further improvement in the localization accuracy is\ndevised.

    "abstract": "Cognitive diagnosis represents a fundamental research area within intelligent\neducation, with the objective of measuring the cognitive status of individuals.\nTheoretically, an individual's cognitive state is essentially equivalent to\ntheir cognitive structure state. Cognitive structure state comprises two key\ncomponents: knowledge state (KS) and knowledge structure state (KUS). The\nknowledge state reflects the learner's mastery of individual concepts, a widely\nstudied focus within cognitive diagnosis. In contrast, the knowledge structure\nstate-representing the learner's understanding of the relationships between\nconcepts-remains inadequately modeled. A learner's cognitive structure is\nessential for promoting meaningful learning and shaping academic performance.\nAlthough various methods have been proposed, most focus on assessing KS and\nfail to assess KUS. To bridge this gap, we propose an innovative and effective\nframework-CSCD (Cognitive Structure State-based Cognitive Diagnosis)-which\nintroduces a novel framework to modeling learners' cognitive structures in\ndiagnostic assessments, thereby offering new insights into cognitive structure\nmodeling. Specifically, we employ an edge-feature-based graph attention network\nto represent the learner's cognitive structure state, effectively integrating\nKS and KUS. Extensive experiments conducted on real datasets demonstrate the\nsuperior performance of this framework in terms of diagnostic accuracy and\ninterpretability.",

    "abstract": "This paper examines whether artificial intelligence (AI) acts as a substitute\nor complement to human labour, drawing on 12 million online job vacancies from\nthe United States spanning 2018-2023. We adopt a two-pronged approach: first,\nanalysing \"internal effects\" within roles explicitly requiring AI, and second,\ninvestigating \"external effects\" that arise when industries, occupations, and\nregions experience increases in AI demand. Our focus centres on whether\ncomplementary skills-such as digital literacy, teamwork, resilience, agility,\nor analytical thinking-become more prevalent and valuable as AI adoption grows.\nResults show that AI-focused roles are nearly twice as likely to require skills\nlike resilience, agility, or analytical thinking compared to non-AI roles.\nFurthermore, these skills command a significant wage premium; data scientists,\nfor instance, are offered 5-10% higher salaries if they also possess resilience\nor ethics capabilities. We observe positive spillover effects: a doubling of\nAI-specific demand across industries correlates with a 5% increase in demand\nfor complementary skills, even outside AI-related roles. Conversely, tasks\nvulnerable to AI substitution, such as basic data skills or translation,\nexhibit modest declines in demand. However, the external effect is clearly net\npositive: Complementary effects are up to 1.7x larger than substitution\neffects. These results are consistent across economies, including the United\nKingdom and Australia. Our findings highlight the necessity of reskilling\nworkers in areas where human expertise remains increasingly valuable and\nensuring workers can effectively complement and leverage emerging AI\ntechnologies.",

Because of the gauge\nsinglet nature, the production of RHNs at the LHC is typically suppressed by\nthe tiny light-heavy neutrino mixing angles. In this study, we explore a\npromising scenario where the presence of an LQ mediator significantly enhances\nRHN production. We focus on first-generation scalar and vector LQs interacting\nwith the first-generation RHN. The prospects are better for the\nfirst-generation scenario than the other generations because of the enhanced\nparton distribution functions (PDFs) of first-generation quarks. The enhanced\nPDFs boost the production cross sections of LQs, particularly their single and\nindirect productions. Incorporating all production modes of LQs that result in\na pair of RHNs, we estimate the discovery prospects by analysing the\nmonoelectron and dielectron channels arising from the decay of the RHN pair. We\nfind that the indirect production of LQs is crucial in determining the\ndiscovery reach at the HL-LHC for the first-generation scenario.",

While it is interesting to understand\nthese relations and their IR characterization for theories that have less\nidealized properties, it is also more difficult to derive analyticity bounds in\nthese cases. For theories that spontaneously break Lorentz symmetry, recent\nprogress was made by considering correlators of conserved currents and their\nanalyticity properties. In this work, we focus on such theories and close the\ngap from the IR side, deriving bounds from the speed of propagation that are\nequivalent to the known analyticity bounds. Our bounds require that gapped\nexcitations have a slower speed than gapless ones, at least for momenta that\nare low with respect to the mass gap.

    "abstract": "We discuss the landscape of flavor physics at the Circular Electron-Positron\nCollider (CEPC), based on the nominal luminosity outlined in its Technical\nDesign Report. The CEPC is designed to operate in multiple modes to address a\nvariety of tasks. At the $Z$ pole, the expected production of 4 Tera $Z$ bosons\nwill provide unique and highly precise measurements of $Z$ boson couplings,\nwhile the substantial number of boosted heavy-flavored quarks and leptons\nproduced in clean $Z$ decays will facilitate investigations into their flavor\nphysics with unprecedented precision. We investigate the prospects of measuring\nvarious physics benchmarks and discuss their implications for particle theories\nand phenomenological models. Our studies indicate that, with its highlighted\nadvantages and anticipated excellent detector performance, the CEPC can explore\nbeauty and $\\tau$ physics in ways that are superior to or complementary with\nthe Belle II and Large-Hadron-Collider-beauty experiments, potentially enabling\nthe detection of new physics at energy scales of 10 TeV and above. This\npotential also extends to the observation of yet-to-be-discovered rare and\nexotic processes, as well as testing fundamental principles such as lepton\nflavor universality, lepton and baryon number conservation, etc., making the\nCEPC a vibrant platform for flavor physics research. The $WW$ threshold scan,\nHiggs-factory operation and top-pair productions of the CEPC further enhance\nits merits in this regard, especially for measuring the\nCabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix elements, and Flavor-Changing-Neutral-Current\nphysics of Higgs boson and top quarks. We outline the requirements for detector\nperformance and considerations for future development to achieve the\nanticipated scientific goals.",

The\nleft-invariant random walk driven by a probability measure $w$ on $G$ is the\nMarkov chain in which from any state $x \\in G$, the probability of stepping to\n$xg \\in G$ is $w(g)$. The initial state is chosen randomly according to a given\ndistribution. The walk is said to lump weakly on left cosets if the induced\nprocess on $G/H$ is a time-homogeneous Markov chain. We characterise all the\ninitial distributions and weights $w$ such that the walk is irreducible and\nlumps weakly on left cosets, and determine all the possible transition matrices\nof the induced Markov chain. In the case where $H$ is abelian we refine our\nmain results to give a necessary and sufficient condition for weak lumping by\nan explicit system of linear equations on $w$, organized by the double cosets\n$HxH$. As an application we consider shuffles of a deck of $n$ cards such that\nrepeated observations of the top card form a Markov chain. Such shuffles\ninclude the random-to-top shuffle, and also, when the deck is started in a\nuniform random order, the top-to-random shuffle. We give a further family of\nexamples in which our full theory of weak lumping is needed to verify that the\ntop card sequence is Markov.",

These properties allow to\nunderstand macroscopic behaviors experimentally observed in thin films and\nsuperlattices where the surface and the interface play a crucial role. The\nchapter begins with a review on 2D magnets, their spin structures and phase\ntransitions. Next, the case of thin films is considered. The theory of surface\nspin waves is discussed in various situations with and without surface\nreconstruction of spin ordering. Various interactions are taken into account:\nsurface interaction different from the bulk one, competing interactions,\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Surface phase transitions are shown in some\nparticularly striking cases. Finally, some cases of topological spin textures\ncalled \"skyrmions\" are reviewed. All the results shown in this chapter have\nbeen published in various research papers cited in the text. Therefore, we will\ndiscuss some important results but avoid to enter complicated methods.

We obtain a moderate description of\nthe photon triggered jet $I_{AA}$, as measured by STAR. A noticeable\nimprovement in the comparison is observed when one goes beyond prompt photons\nand includes bremsstrahlung and decay photons, revealing their significance in\ncertain kinematic regions, particularly at $X_{J\\gamma} > 1$. Moreover,\nazimuthal angle correlations demonstrate a notable impact of non-prompt photons\non the distribution, emphasizing their role in accurately describing\nexperimental results. This work highlights the success of the multistage model\nof jet modification to straightforwardly predict (this set of) photon triggered\njet observables. This comparison, along with the role played by non-prompt\nphotons, has important consequences on the inclusion of such observables in a\nfuture Bayesian analysis.",

The level spacing\nratio and the generalized participation ratio of the Floquet Hamiltonian reveal\na drive-induced fractal phase accompanied by diffusive transport on the\ndelocalized side of the undriven PLRBM model. On the localized side, the\ntime-periodic model remains localized - the average spacing ratio corresponds\nto Poisson statistics and logarithmic transport is observed in the dynamics.\nExtending our analysis to the aperiodic Thue-Morse (TM) driven system, we find\nthat the aperiodically driven clean long-range hopping model (clean counterpart\nof the PLRBM model) exhibits the phenomenon of \\textit{exact dynamical\nlocalization} (EDL) on tuning the drive-parameters at special points. The\ndisordered time-aperiodic system shows diffusive transport followed by\nrelaxation to the infinite-temperature state on the delocalized side, and a\nprethermal plateau with subdiffusion on the localized side.

    "abstract": "Data-driven learning is prevalent in many fields of science, mathematics and\nengineering. The goal of data-driven learning of dynamical systems is to\ninterpret timeseries as a continuous observation of an underlying dynamical\nsystem. This task is not well-posed for a variety of reasons. A dynamical\nsystem may have multiple sub-systems co-existing within it. The nature of the\ndataset depends on the portion of the phase space being viewed, and may thus be\nconfined to a sub-system. Secondly these sub-systems may be topologically\ninter-weaved, so may be inseparable computationally. Thirdly, two timeseries\nsampled separately from different dynamical systems may be close or even\nindistinguishable. Thus a timeseries may not have a unique source. We show how\nthese ambiguities are circumvented if one considers dynamical systems and\nmeasurement maps collectively. This is made possible in a category theoretical\nframework, in which reconstruction is unique up to equivalences.

To test\nthis, we conduct experiments on five typologically diverse language pairs\nspanning distinct families: Semitic (Modern Standard Arabic to Levantine\nArabic), Bantu (Hausa to Zulu), Romance (Spanish to Catalan), Slavic (Slovak to\nMacedonian), and a language isolate (Eastern Armenian to Western Armenian).\nResults show that transfer learning consistently improves translation quality\nacross all pairs, confirming its applicability beyond closely related\nlanguages. As a secondary analysis, we vary key hyperparameters learning rate,\nbatch size, number of epochs, and weight decay to ensure results are not\ndependent on a single configuration. We find that moderate batch sizes (e.g.,\n32) are often optimal for similar pairs, smaller sizes benefit less similar\npairs, and excessively high learning rates can destabilize training.

To overcome this, we propose a\nprincipled, data-driven approach by introducing a novel forgetting mechanism\nfor signatures.

To achieve this, we revisit the recently\nintroduced Random Fourier Signature Features, and develop Random Fourier\nDecayed Signature Features (RFDSF) with Gaussian processes (GPs). This results\nin a Bayesian time series forecasting algorithm with variational inference,\nthat offers a scalable probabilistic algorithm that processes and transforms a\ntime series into a joint predictive distribution over time steps in one pass\nusing recurrence.

We expect that humans will engage in a consistent\nreasoning process across various questions about a situation, but this is known\nto not be the case for current LLMs. Most theory of mind benchmarks only\nmeasure what we call literal theory of mind: the ability to predict the\nbehavior of others. However, this type of metric is only informative when\nagents exhibit self-consistent reasoning. Thus, we introduce the concept of\nfunctional theory of mind: the ability to adapt to agents in-context following\na rational response to their behavior. We find that many open source LLMs are\ncapable of displaying strong literal theory of mind capabilities, but seem to\nstruggle with functional theory of mind -- even with exceedingly simple partner\npolicies. Simply put, strong literal theory of mind performance does not\nnecessarily imply strong functional theory of mind performance or vice versa.\nAchieving functional theory of mind, particularly over long interaction\nhorizons with a partner, is a significant challenge deserving a prominent role\nin any meaningful LLM theory of mind evaluation.",

    "abstract": "Signed Distance Functions (SDFs) are vital implicit representations to\nrepresent high fidelity 3D surfaces. Current methods mainly leverage a neural\nnetwork to learn an SDF from various supervisions including signed distances,\n3D point clouds, or multi-view images. However, due to various reasons\nincluding the bias of neural network on low frequency content, 3D unaware\nsampling, sparsity in point clouds, or low resolutions of images, neural\nimplicit representations still struggle to represent geometries with high\nfrequency components like sharp structures, especially for the ones learned\nfrom images or point clouds. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a method\nto sharpen a low frequency SDF observation by recovering its high frequency\ncomponents, pursuing a sharper and more complete surface. Our key idea is to\nlearn a mapping from a low frequency observation to a full frequency coverage\nin a data-driven manner, leading to a prior knowledge of shape consolidation in\nthe frequency domain, dubbed frequency consolidation priors. To better\ngeneralize a learned prior to unseen shapes, we introduce to represent\nfrequency components as embeddings and disentangle the embedding of the low\nfrequency component from the embedding of the full frequency component. This\ndisentanglement allows the prior to generalize on an unseen low frequency\nobservation by simply recovering its full frequency embedding through a\ntest-time self-reconstruction. Our evaluations under widely used benchmarks or\nreal scenes show that our method can recover high frequency component and\nproduce more accurate surfaces than the latest methods.

    "abstract": "Phages use bacterial host resources to replicate, intrinsically linking phage\nand host survival. To understand phage dynamics, it is essential to understand\nphage-host ecology. A key step in this ecology is infection of bacterial hosts.\nPrevious work has explored single and multiple, sequential infections. Here we\nfocus on the theory of simultaneous infections, where multiple phages\nsimultaneously attach to and infect one bacterial host cell. Simultaneous\ninfections are a relevant infection dynamic to consider, especially at high\nphage densities when many phages attach to a single host cell in a short time\nwindow. For high bacterial growth rates, simultaneous infection can result in\nbi-stability: depending on initial conditions phages go extinct or co-exist\nwith hosts, either at stable densities or through periodic oscillations of a\nstable limit cycle. This bears important consequences for phage applications\nsuch as phage therapy: phages can persist even though they cannot invade.\nConsequently, through spikes in phage densities it is possible to infect a\nbacterial population even when the phage basic reproductive number is less than\none. In the regime of stable limit cycles, if timed right, only small densities\nof phage may be necessary.",

More precisely, this involves the search of the\npossibly-unique axiomatic logical proposition calculus to apply simultaneously\nboth to classical and quantum realms of physics and to be consistent with the\ncorresponding mathematical and filosophysical setups. Based on the recent\nestablishment of quantum logic, which has been shown to apply both to Quantum\nMechanics and Quantum Gravity, the crucial remaining step involves the\nidentification of the appropriate axiomatic logical proposition calculus to be\nassociated with Classical Mechanics. In this paper the issue is posed for a\nfundamental example of Classical Mechanics, which is represented by the\nso-called Boltzmann-Sinai dynamical system. This is realized by the ensemble of\nclassical smooth hard-spheres, which is set at the basis of Classical\nStatistical Mechanics and is also commonly regarded as a possible realization\nof Classical Newtonian Cosmology. Depending on the initial conditions which are\nprescribed for such a system, its classical state is shown to obey the\npropositional calculus of non-classical logic. In particular, the latter is\nexpressed by the 3-way Principle of Non-Contradiction, namely the same logical\nprinciple that holds for quantum logic. The result therefore permits to\nquestion on a mathematical basis the principles of deterministic classical\nlogic and the validity of their character within the domain of Classical\nPhysics. Such a conclusion represents a potential notable innovation in the\nlogical dicotomy true/false, a crucial topic which has crossed millennia\nthrough philosophy, logic, mathematics and physics.",

While many existing architectures offer strong performance,\nthey often face challenges such as overfitting and excessive computational\ncosts. An adjustable and flexible architecture that strikes a balance between\ntime efficiency and model complexity remains an unmet requirement. In this\npaper, we introduce proKAN, a progressive stacking methodology for\nKolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) designed to address these challenges. Unlike\ntraditional architectures, proKAN dynamically adjusts its complexity by\nprogressively adding KAN blocks during training, based on overfitting behavior.\nThis approach allows the network to stop growing when overfitting is detected,\npreventing unnecessary computational overhead while maintaining high accuracy.\nAdditionally, proKAN utilizes KAN's learnable activation functions modeled\nthrough B-splines, which provide enhanced flexibility in learning complex\nrelationships in 3D medical data. Our proposed architecture achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in liver segmentation tasks, outperforming\nstandard Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) and fixed KAN architectures. The\ndynamic nature of proKAN ensures efficient training times and high accuracy\nwithout the risk of overfitting. Furthermore, proKAN provides better\ninterpretability by allowing insight into the decision-making process through\nits learnable coefficients. The experimental results demonstrate a significant\nimprovement in accuracy, Dice score, and time efficiency, making proKAN a\ncompelling solution for 3D medical image segmentation tasks.",

Although recent studies have developed various generative\nmodels for graphic design, they usually face the following limitations: they\nonly focus on certain subtasks and are far from achieving the design\ncomposition task; they do not consider the hierarchical information of graphic\ndesigns during the generation process. To tackle these issues, we introduce the\nlayered design principle into Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) and propose a\nnovel approach, called LaDeCo, to accomplish this challenging task.\nSpecifically, LaDeCo first performs layer planning for a given element set,\ndividing the input elements into different semantic layers according to their\ncontents. Based on the planning results, it subsequently predicts element\nattributes that control the design composition in a layer-wise manner, and\nincludes the rendered image of previously generated layers into the context.\nWith this insightful design, LaDeCo decomposes the difficult task into smaller\nmanageable steps, making the generation process smoother and clearer. The\nexperimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of LaDeCo in design\ncomposition.

However, the structure of intermediate reasoning\nsteps, or thoughts, is rigid and unidirectional, such as chains, trees, or\nacyclic-directed graphs. Consequently, the resulting inflexible and\nforward-only reasoning may not address challenging tasks and fail when the LLM\nfrequently gives false responses, i.e., ``hallucinations''. This paper proposes\na new reasoning framework, called Thought Rollback (TR), allowing LLMs to\nadaptively build thought structure while maintaining effective reasoning toward\nproblem-solving under ``hallucinations''. The core mechanism of TR is rolling\nback thoughts, which allows LLMs to perform error analysis on thoughts, and\nthus roll back to any previously mistaken thought for revision. Subsequently,\nby including such trial-and-error in the prompt to guide the LLM, each rollback\nleads to one more reliable reasoning path. Therefore, starting with a simple\nprompt without human annotations, LLM with TR adaptively and gradually explores\nthoughts for a correct solution. Comprehensive experiments on mathematical\nproblems and multi-task reasoning demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance\nof TR in terms of problem-solving rate and interaction cost.

    "abstract": "We study the Freeze-Tag Problem (FTP), introduced by Arkin et al. (SODA'02),\nwhere the goal is to wake up a group of $n$ robots, starting from a single\nactive robot. Our focus is on the geometric version of the problem, where\nrobots are positioned in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, and once activated, a robot can move\nat a constant speed to wake up others. The objective is to minimize the time it\ntakes to activate the last robot, also known as the makespan.\n  We present new upper bounds for the $l_1$ and $l_2$ norms in $\\mathbb{R}^2$\nand $\\mathbb{R}^3$. For $(\\mathbb{R}^2, l_2)$, we achieve a makespan of at most\n$5.4162r$, improving on the previous bound of $7.07r$ by Bonichon et al.\n(DISC'24). In $(\\mathbb{R}^3, l_1)$, we establish an upper bound of $13r$,\nwhich leads to a bound of $22.52r$ for $(\\mathbb{R}^3, l_2)$. Here, $r$ denotes\nthe maximum distance of a robot from the initially active robot under the given\nnorm. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first known bounds for the\nmakespan in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ under these norms.\n  We also explore the FTP in $(\\mathbb{R}^3, l_2)$ for specific instances where\nrobots are positioned on a boundary, providing further insights into practical\nscenarios.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the noise sensitivity of the semidefinite program\n(SDP) proposed for direct data-driven infinite-horizon linear quadratic\nregulator (LQR) problem for discrete-time linear time-invariant systems. While\nthis SDP is shown to find the true LQR controller in the noise-free setting, we\nshow that it leads to a trivial solution with zero gain matrices when data is\ncorrupted by noise, even when the noise is arbitrarily small. We then study a\nvariant of the SDP that includes a robustness promoting regularization term and\nprove that regularization does not fully eliminate the sensitivity issue. In\nparticular, the solution of the regularized SDP converges in probability also\nto a trivial solution.",

    ],
    "abstract": "We perform the Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) quantization of a $(0 +\n1)$-dimensional cosmological Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) model. This\nquantization leverages the classical infinitesimal and continuous\nre-parameterization symmetry transformations of the system. To derive the\nnilpotent re-parameterization invariant BRST-anti-BRST symmetry transformations\nfor the scale factor and corresponding momentum variables present in the\ncosmological FRW model, we employ the modified Bonora-Tonin supervariable\napproach (MBTSA) to BRST formalism. Through this approach, we also establish\nthe BRST-anti-BRST invariant Curci-Ferrari (CF)-type restriction for this\ncosmological re-parameterization invariant model. Further, we obtain the\noff-shell nilpotent quantum BRST-anti-BRST symmetry transformations for other\nvariables within the model using the (anti-)chiral supervariable approach\n(ACSA) to BRST formalism. Within the framework of ACSA, the CF-type restriction\nis demonstrated through two key aspects: $(i)$ the invariance of the coupled\nLagrangians under symmetry transformations, and $(ii)$ the absolute\nanti-commutativity of the conserved BRST-anti-BRST charges. Notably, applying\nthe MBTSA to a physical cosmological system, specifically a one-dimensional\none, constitutes a novel contribution to this work. Additionally, in the\napplication of ACSA, we restrict our analysis to (anti-)chiral super expansions\nof supervariables, leading to the unique observation of the absolute\nanti-commutativity of the conserved BRST-anti-BRST charges. Moreover, we\nhighlight that the CF-type restriction demonstrates a universal nature,\nremaining consistent across any re-parameterization invariant models in general\nD-dimensional spacetime.",

The Riemann--Hilbert problem associated to the inverse\ntransform is solved numerically by means of appropriate contour deformations in\nthe complex plane following the numerical implementation of the Deift-Zhou\nnonlinear steepest descent method. In this work, the box parameters are chosen\nso that there is no discrete spectrum (i.e., no solitons). The numerical method\nis demonstrated to be accurate within the two asymptotic regimes corresponding\nto two different regions of the $(x,t)$-plane depending on whether $|x/(2t)| <\nq_o$ or $|x/(2t)| > q_o$, as $t \\to \\infty$.",

Earlier investigations of L328 mapped cloud/envelope\n(parsec-scale) magnetic fields (B-fields). In this work, we used JCMT/POL-2\nsubmillimeter (sub-mm) polarisation measurements at 850 $\\mu$m to map\ncore-scale B-fields in L328. The B-fields were found to be ordered and\nwell-connected from cloud to core-scales, i.e., from parsec- to\nsub-parsec-scale. The connection in B-field geometry is shown using $Planck$\ndust polarisation maps to trace large-scale B-fields, optical and near-infrared\n(NIR) polarisation observations to trace B-fields in the cloud and envelope,\nand 850 $\\mu$m polarisation mapping core-scale field geometry. The core-scale\nB-field strength, estimated using the modified Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi\nrelation, was found to be 50.5 $\\pm$ 9.8 $\\mu$G, which is $\\sim$2.5 times\nhigher than the envelope B-field strength found in previous studies. This\nindicates that B-fields are getting stronger on smaller (sub-parsec) scales.\nThe mass-to-flux ratio of 1.1 $\\pm$ 0.2 suggests that the core is magnetically\ntranscritical. The energy budget in the L328 core was also estimated, revealing\nthat the gravitational, magnetic, and non-thermal kinetic energies were\ncomparable with each other, while thermal energy was significantly lower.",

    "abstract": "Controlled introduction of oxygen vacancies offers an effective route to\ninduce metal-to-insulator transition in strongly correlated rare-earth\nnickelates ($R$NiO$_3$) at room temperature. However, the role played by the\nrare-earth cations on the structure, thermodynamic stability, and electronic\nproperties of oxygen-deficient nickelates remains unclear. Here, we employ\ndensity functional theory calculations with Hubbard corrections (DFT + $U$) to\ninvestigate the whole family of $R$NiO$_{2.5}$ ($R$ = Pr-Er) compounds in two\ncommonly observed oxygen-vacancy ordered configurations, namely brownmillerite,\nand square planar. We find that square planar polymorph is always more stable\n($\\sim$0.4 eV/u.f) than the brownmillerite for all rare-earth cations, owing to\nthe exceedingly low volumetric strains (< 1\\%). Formation energy of\n$R$NiO$_{2.5}$ gradually increases with decreasing size of $R$ owing to\nstronger Ni-O covalent interactions in pristine $R$NiO$_3$ with small $R^{3+}$\ncations. This necessitates more oxygen-lean environments for synthesis of\n$R$NiO$_{2.5}$ with smaller $R^{3+}$ cations. Analysis of the density of states\nand band structures reveals that electronic structure of $R$NiO$_{2.5}$ is\ngoverned by two factors: (a) localization of electron on NiO$_6$ octahedra\nyielding a Mott insulating state with strong correlations as Ni $e_g$ is half\nfilled, and (b) crystal field splitting in the NiO$_4$ tetrahedra/square planar\npolyhedra. Brownmillerite $R$NiO$_{2.5}$ is metallic, while square planar\n$R$NiO$_{2.5}$ is an insulator with a predicted gap of $\\sim$ 0.2-0.3 eV,\ndepending on the $R^{3+}$ cation. Crystal orbital Hamilton population (COHP)\nanalysis indicates that the Ni-O bond belonging to square-planar NiO$_4$\npolyhedra exhibit much greater covalent character than those in NiO$_6$\noctahedra in square planar $R$NiO$_{2.5}$.",

    "abstract": "In quantum resource theory, one is often interested in identifying which\nstates serve as the best resources for particular quantum tasks. If a relative\ncomparison between quantum states can be made, this gives rise to a partial\norder, where states are ordered according to their suitability to act as a\nresource. In the literature, various different partial orders for a variety of\nquantum resources have been proposed. In discrete variable systems, vector\nmajorization of Wigner functions in discrete phase space provides a natural\npartial order between quantum states. In the continuous variable case, a\nnatural counterpart would be continuous majorization of Wigner functions in\nquantum phase space. Indeed, this concept was recently proposed and explored\n(mostly restricting to the single-mode case) in Van Herstraeten, Jabbour, Cerf,\nQuantum 7, 1021 (2023). In this work, we develop the theory of continuous\nmajorization in the general $N$-mode case. In addition, we propose extensions\nto include states with finite Wigner negativity. For the special case of the\nconvex hull of $N$-mode Gaussian states, we prove a conjecture made by Van\nHerstraeten, Jabbour and Cerf. We also prove a phase space counterpart of\nUhlmann's theorem of majorization.",

Its sections can be identified with the invariant\nvector fields on the groupoid, which are closed under the Lie bracket. We\ngeneralize this differentiation procedure to groupoid objects in any category\nwith an abstract tangent structure in the sense of Rosick\\'{y} and a scalar\nmultiplication by a ring object that plays the role of the real numbers. We\nidentify the categorical conditions that the groupoid object must satisfy to\nadmit a natural notion of invariant vector fields. Then we show that invariant\nvector fields are closed under the Lie bracket defined by Rosick\\'{y} and\nsatisfy the Leibniz rule with respect to ring-valued morphisms on the base of\nthe groupoid. The result is what we define axiomatically as an abstract Lie\nalgebroid, by generalizing the underlying vector bundle to a module object in\nthe slice category over its base. Examples include diffeomorphism groups,\nbisection groups of Lie groupoids, the diffeological symmetry groupoids of\ngeneral relativity (Blohmann/Fernandes/Weinstein), symmetry groupoids in\nLagrangian Field Theory, holonomy groupoids of singular foliations, elastic\ndiffeological groupoids, groupoid objects in differentiable stacks, and affine\ngroupoid schemes.",

The pipeline uses anonymized\ndata from 2010 to 2018, obtained from the Human Fertilization and Embryology\nAuthority (HFEA). We evaluated the prediction performance of live birth success\nas a binary outcome (success/failure) by integrating different feature\nselection methods, such as principal component analysis (PCA) and particle\nswarm optimization (PSO), with different traditional machine learning-based\nclassifiers including random forest (RF) and decision tree, as well as deep\nlearning-based classifiers including custom transformer-based model and a tab\ntransformer model with an attention mechanism. Our research demonstrated that\nthe best performance was achieved by combining PSO for feature selection with\nthe TabTransformer-based deep learning model, yielding an accuracy of 99.50%\nand an AUC of 99.96%, highlighting its significant performance to predict live\nbirths.

Thereby, the final state of collision\nevents can be predicted at the level of stable particles, which serve as input\nfor full detector simulations.\n  This article investigates the impact of nonperturbative effects on two\nprocesses that may be used for precision determinations of the strong coupling\nconstant and the proton structure: the triple-differential dijet and Z+jet\nproduction. While nonperturbative effects impact both processes, significant\ndifferences among them are observed and further investigated. Indications are\nfound that the Underlying Event and hadronisation cannot fully explain these\ndifferences and the perturbative modelling may play a significant role as well.",

Our findings reveal that, in general spatial\ndimensions, either 8 copies of staggered Majorana fermions or 4 copies of\nstaggered Dirac fermions admit SMG.

In particular, AI shows significant promise in supporting\ndecision-making during the ovarian stimulation phase of the IVF process. This\nreview evaluates studies focused on the applications of AI combined with\nmedical imaging in ovarian stimulation, examining methodologies, outcomes, and\ncurrent limitations. Our analysis of 13 studies on this topic reveals that,\nreveal that while AI algorithms demonstrated notable potential in predicting\noptimal hormonal dosages, trigger timing, and oocyte retrieval outcomes, the\nmedical imaging data utilized predominantly came from two-dimensional (2D)\nultrasound which mainly involved basic quantifications, such as follicle size\nand number, with limited use of direct feature extraction or advanced image\nanalysis techniques. This points to an underexplored opportunity where advanced\nimage analysis approaches, such as deep learning, and more diverse imaging\nmodalities, like three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound, could unlock deeper\ninsights. Additionally, the lack of explainable AI (XAI) in most studies raises\nconcerns about the transparency and traceability of AI-driven decisions - key\nfactors for clinical adoption and trust. Furthermore, many studies relied on\nsingle-center designs and small datasets, which limit the generalizability of\ntheir findings. This review highlights the need for integrating advanced\nimaging analysis techniques with explainable AI methodologies, as well as the\nimportance of leveraging multicenter collaborations and larger datasets.\nAddressing these gaps has the potential to enhance ovarian stimulation\nmanagement, paving the way for efficient, personalized, and data-driven\ntreatment pathways that improve IVF outcomes.",

Traditional approaches\noften model this challenge as a variant of image segmentation, treating the\nbinary segmentation of forged areas as the end product. We argue that the basic\nbinary forgery mask is inadequate for explaining model predictions. It doesn't\nclarify why the model pinpoints certain areas and treats all forged pixels the\nsame, making it hard to spot the most fake-looking parts. In this study, we\nmitigate the aforementioned limitations by generating salient region-focused\ninterpretation for the forgery images. To support this, we craft a Multi-Modal\nTramper Tracing (MMTT) dataset, comprising facial images manipulated using\ndeepfake techniques and paired with manual, interpretable textual annotations.\nTo harvest high-quality annotation, annotators are instructed to meticulously\nobserve the manipulated images and articulate the typical characteristics of\nthe forgery regions. Subsequently, we collect a dataset of 128,303 image-text\npairs. Leveraging the MMTT dataset, we develop ForgeryTalker, an architecture\ndesigned for concurrent forgery localization and interpretation. ForgeryTalker\nfirst trains a forgery prompter network to identify the pivotal clues within\nthe explanatory text. Subsequently, the region prompter is incorporated into\nmultimodal large language model for finetuning to achieve the dual goals of\nlocalization and interpretation.

    "abstract": "We study deep ReLU feed forward neural networks (NN) and their injectivity\nabilities. The main focus is on \\emph{precisely} determining the so-called\ninjectivity capacity. For any given hidden layers architecture, it is defined\nas the minimal ratio between number of network's outputs and inputs which\nensures unique recoverability of the input from a realizable output. A strong\nrecent progress in precisely studying single ReLU layer injectivity properties\nis here moved to a deep network level. In particular, we develop a program that\nconnects deep $l$-layer net injectivity to an $l$-extension of the $\\ell_0$\nspherical perceptrons, thereby massively generalizing an isomorphism between\nstudying single layer injectivity and the capacity of the so-called\n(1-extension) $\\ell_0$ spherical perceptrons discussed in [82]. \\emph{Random\nduality theory} (RDT) based machinery is then created and utilized to\nstatistically handle properties of the extended $\\ell_0$ spherical perceptrons\nand implicitly of the deep ReLU NNs. A sizeable set of numerical evaluations is\nconducted as well to put the entire RDT machinery in practical use. From these\nwe observe a rapidly decreasing tendency in needed layers' expansions, i.e., we\nobserve a rapid \\emph{expansion saturation effect}. Only $4$ layers of depth\nare sufficient to closely approach level of no needed expansion -- a result\nthat fairly closely resembles observations made in practical experiments and\nthat has so far remained completely untouchable by any of the existing\nmathematical methodologies.",

However, relying solely on the global attention mechanism is\ninsufficient for capturing the fine-grained local details, which are crucial\nfor accurate pose estimation. To address this, we propose SSR-STF, a\ndual-stream model that effectively integrates local features with global\ndependencies to enhance 3D human pose estimation. Specifically, we introduce\nSSRFormer, a simple yet effective module that employs the skeleton selective\nrefine attention (SSRA) mechanism to capture fine-grained local dependencies in\nhuman pose sequences, complementing the global dependencies modeled by the\nTransformer. By adaptively fusing these two feature streams, SSR-STF can better\nlearn the underlying structure of human poses, overcoming the limitations of\ntraditional methods in local feature extraction. Extensive experiments on the\nHuman3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets demonstrate that SSR-STF achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance, with P1 errors of 37.4 mm and 13.2 mm\nrespectively, outperforming existing methods in both accuracy and\ngeneralization.

To tackle the first issue, we\nutilize a similarity learning network that maps sampled points into a\nrepresentation space.

This suggests that the shape of the spectral form factor\ncould serve as an indicator of chaos in various quantum systems. It has been\nshown recently that the dip-ramp-plateau structure appears in the spectral form\nfactor when the normal modes of a massless scalar field theory in the\nbrick-wall model of the BTZ black hole are treated as eigenvalues of a quantum\nHamiltonian. At the same time, the level spacing distribution of these normal\nmodes differs from that associated with random matrix theory ensembles. In this\npaper, we extend the results for BTZ background to the case of non-zero mass of\nthe field, study the generalized spectral form-factor, and consider the same\ncontext for another non-trivial background -- de Sitter space. We compare the\ngeneralized spectral form factor for simple integrable quantum systems and for\nbackgrounds with a horizon to the behavior predicted by random matrix theory.\nAs a result, we confirm that BTZ and de Sitter brick-wall models are highly\ndistinct integrable systems that exhibit the dip-ramp-plateau structure of the\nSFF but differ in the structure of the three-level generalized spectral form\nfactor from the one predicted by random matrix theory.

Generative linguistic\nsteganography leverages the probability distribution of language models (LMs)\nand applies steganographic algorithms to generate stego tokens, gaining\nattention with recent Large Language Model (LLM) advancements. To enhance\nsecurity, researchers develop distribution-preserving stego algorithms to\nminimize the gap between stego sampling and LM sampling. However, the reliance\non language model distributions, coupled with deviations from real-world cover\ntexts, results in insufficient imperceptibility when facing steganalysis\ndetectors in real-world scenarios. Moreover, LLM distributions tend to be more\ndeterministic, resulting in reduced entropy and, consequently, lower embedding\ncapacity.

Existing methods attempt to optimize input text\nprompts for improved alignment of images and text, by finely adjusting text\nprototypes to facilitate semantic matching. Nevertheless, given the modality\ngap between text and vision spaces, the text prototypes employed by these\nmethods have not effectively established a close correspondence with\npixel-level vision features. In this work, our theoretical analysis indicates\nthat the inherent modality gap results in misalignment of text and region\nfeatures, and that this gap cannot be sufficiently reduced by minimizing\ncontrast loss in CLIP. To mitigate the impact of the modality gap, we propose a\nVision Prototype Learning (VPL) framework, by introducing more representative\nvision prototypes. The core of this framework is to learn class-specific vision\nprototypes in vision space with the help of text prototypes, for capturing\nhigh-quality localization maps. Moreover, we propose a regional semantic\ncontrast module that contrasts regions embedding with corresponding prototypes,\nleading to more comprehensive and robust feature learning.

However, these methods often struggle to maintain consistent\nsubject appearance due to suboptimal feature extraction and injection\ntechniques. In this paper, we reveal that VDM inherently possesses the force to\nextract and inject subject features. Departing from previous heuristic\napproaches, we introduce a novel framework that leverages VDM's inherent force\nto enable high-quality zero-shot customized video generation. Specifically, for\nfeature extraction, we directly input reference images into VDM and use its\nintrinsic feature extraction process, which not only provides fine-grained\nfeatures but also significantly aligns with VDM's pre-trained knowledge. For\nfeature injection, we devise an innovative bidirectional interaction between\nsubject features and generated content through spatial self-attention within\nVDM, ensuring that VDM has better subject fidelity while maintaining the\ndiversity of the generated video.

Sacrificing Hermiticity, we construct several\nsymmetric, frustration-free, gapped Hamiltonians with real spectra and analyse\ntheir ground state subspaces. Our study reveals two intriguing phenomena.\nFirst, we identify an $\\mathbb{S}^1$-parametrised family of symmetric states,\nall of which belong to the same gapped phase with respect to the invertible\nsubsymmetry, yet transform inequivalently under the non-semisimple symmetry.\nSecond, we find a model where a product state and the so-called W state\nspontaneously break the symmetry. We further relate the indistinguishability of\nthese two states in the infinite-volume limit to the notion that they are\nassociated with a simple object and its projective cover, respectively, in a\nnon-semisimple module category.",

    "abstract": "Marked temporal point processes (MTPPs) are used to model sequences of\ndifferent types of events with irregular arrival times, with broad applications\nranging from healthcare and social networks to finance. We address shortcomings\nin existing point process models by drawing connections between modern deep\nstate-space models (SSMs) and linear Hawkes processes (LHPs), culminating in an\nMTPP that we call the deep linear Hawkes process (DLHP). The DLHP modifies the\nlinear differential equations in deep SSMs to be stochastic jump differential\nequations, akin to LHPs. After discretizing, the resulting recurrence can be\nimplemented efficiently using a parallel scan. This brings parallelism and\nlinear scaling to MTPP models. This contrasts with attention-based MTPPs, which\nscale quadratically, and RNN-based MTPPs, which do not parallelize across the\nsequence length. We show empirically that DLHPs match or outperform existing\nmodels across a broad range of metrics on eight real-world datasets. Our\nproposed DLHP model is the first instance of the unique architectural\ncapabilities of SSMs being leveraged to construct a new class of MTPP models.",

Compared to pristine gCN,\nthe BP-gCN heterostructure demonstrates a significantly improved\nelectrochemical surface area (ECSA) and nearly two-fold reduction in charge\ntransfer resistance (Rct), achieving remarkable glucose sensitivity of 1.1 uA\nmM(^-1) cm(^-2) at physiological pH.

These theoretical\ninsights complement the experimental findings, highlighting the superior\nelectrocatalytic performance of the heterostructure and the role of oxidized BP\nsurface. Furthermore, the BP-gCN sensor is integrated into a wearable device\nplatform with microfluidic layers and a Near Field Communication (NFC) chip,\nforming a conformal skin patch that enables real-time sweat glucose monitoring.\nThis demonstration of a high-performance, non-enzymatic wearable glucose sensor\nbased on a heterostructure design underscores the potential of the device for\nseamless health management and paves the way for next generation biosensing\nplatforms aimed at improving personalized and continuous health monitoring.",

Using the extended Press-Schechter\nformalism, we show that non-Gaussianity modifies both the curvature\nperturbation profile $\\mathcal{R}(r)$ and the integration path in probability\nspace, significantly impacting PBH abundance. Our results reveal that the\nabundance initially increases with the parameter $h$, which characterizes the\nrelaxation stage after the step. However, beyond a critical value ($h \\simeq\n5.9$), it sharply declines before rising again. Furthermore, we demonstrate\nthat non-Gaussianity introduces uncertainties in indirect PBH observations via\ngravitational waves. Notably, we present an example where a positive $f_{\\rm\nNL}$ does not necessarily enhance PBH production, contrary to conventional\nexpectations. Finally, by accounting for non-perturbative effects, we resolve\nthe overproduction of PBHs suggested by pulsar timing array (PTA) data,\nunderscoring the critical importance of incorporating non-Gaussianity in future\nstudies.",

Our experimental\nresults on UPMEM hardware demonstrate performance gains of up to 6.18$\\times$\nfor various UPMEM benchmark kernels and 8.21$\\times$ for GPT-J layers. To the\nbest of our knowledge, ATiM is the first tensor compiler to provide fully\nautomated, autotuning-integrated code generation support for a DRAM-PIM system.\nBy bridging the gap between high-level tensor computation abstractions and\nlow-level hardware-specific requirements, ATiM establishes a foundation for\nadvancing DRAM-PIM programmability and enabling streamlined optimization.",

This paper introduces RecConv, a recursive\ndecomposition strategy that efficiently constructs multi-frequency\nrepresentations using small-kernel convolutions. RecConv establishes a linear\nrelationship between parameter growth and decomposing levels which determines\nthe effective receptive field $k\\times 2^\\ell$ for a base kernel $k$ and $\\ell$\nlevels of decomposition, while maintaining constant FLOPs regardless of the ERF\nexpansion. Specifically, RecConv achieves a parameter expansion of only\n$\\ell+2$ times and a maximum FLOPs increase of $5/3$ times, compared to the\nexponential growth ($4^\\ell$) of standard and depthwise convolutions.\nRecNeXt-M3 outperforms RepViT-M1.1 by 1.9 $AP^{box}$ on COCO with similar\nFLOPs.

Despite the success of the theory at showing\nintractability of problems such as computing Brouwer fixed points and Nash\nequilibria, subclasses of TFNP remain arguably few and far between. In this\nwork, we define two new subclasses of TFNP borne of the study of complex\npolynomial systems: Multi-homogeneous Systems (MHS) and Sparse Fundamental\nTheorem of Algebra (SFTA). The first of these is based on B\\'ezout's theorem\nfrom algebraic geometry, marking the first TFNP subclass based on an algebraic\ngeometric principle. At the heart of our study is the computational problem\nknown as Quantum SAT (QSAT) with a System of Distinct Representatives (SDR),\nfirst studied by [Laumann, L\\\"auchli, Moessner, Scardicchio, and Sondhi 2010].\nAmong other results, we show that QSAT with SDR is MHS-complete, thus giving\nnot only the first link between quantum complexity theory and TFNP, but also\nthe first TFNP problem whose classical variant (SAT with SDR) is easy but whose\nquantum variant is hard. We also show how to embed the roots of a sparse,\nhigh-degree, univariate polynomial into QSAT with SDR, obtaining that SFTA is\ncontained in a zero-error version of MHS. We conjecture this construction also\nworks in the low-error setting, which would imply SFTA is contained in MHS.",

Recent research has shown\npredictive signals can be revealed in pre-onset ECoG activity during\nnaturalistic narrative listening, by building encoding models based on word\nembeddings from Large Language Models (LLMs). Similarly, evidence for\nlong-range predictive encoding has been observed in fMRI data, where\nincorporating embeddings for multiple upcoming words in a narrative improves\nalignment with brain activity. This study examines whether similar predictive\ninformation can be detected in MEG, a technique with higher temporal resolution\nthan fMRI but a lower signal-to-noise ratio than ECoG. Our findings indicate\nthat MEG captures pre-onset representations up to 1 second before word onset,\nconsistent with ECoG results. However, unlike fMRI findings, incorporating\nfuture word embeddings did not enhance MEG encoding, even for one word into the\nfuture, which suggests that the pre-onset encoding may not reflect predictive\nprocessing.

    "abstract": "Recently, Hadfield et al. proposed the quantum alternating operator ansatz\nalgorithm (QAOA+), an extension of the quantum approximate optimization\nalgorithm (QAOA), to solve constrained combinatorial optimization problems\n(CCOPs). Compared with QAOA, QAOA+ enables the search for optimal solutions\nwithin a feasible solution space by encoding problem constraints into the mixer\nHamiltonian, thus reducing the search space and eliminating the possibility of\nyielding infeasible solutions. However, QAOA+ may require substantial gates and\ncircuit depth when the mixer is applied to all qubits in each layer, and the\nimplementation cost of the mixer is high. To address these challenges, we\npropose the adaptive mixer allocation (AMA) algorithm. AMA constructs a\nfeasible space by selectively applying the mixer to partial qubits in each\nlayer based on the evolution of the optimization process. The performance of\nAMA in solving the maximum independent set (MIS) problem is investigated.\nNumerical simulation results demonstrate that, under the same number of\noptimization runs, AMA achieves a higher optimal approximation ratio--$1.82\\%$\n($3.02\\%$) higher than QAOA+ on ER (3-regular) graphs. Additionally, AMA\nsignificantly reduces the resource consumption, achieving only $34.08\\%$\n($29.77\\%$) of QAOA+ circuit depth and $15.05\\%$ ($18.72\\%$) of the number of\nCNOT gates, respectively, on ER (3-regular) graphs. These results highlight the\nability of AMA to enhance computational efficiency and solution quality, making\nit particularly valuable for resource-constrained quantum devices.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance across various\ntasks, but the escalating demands on computational resources pose significant\nchallenges, particularly in the extensive utilization of full fine-tuning for\ndownstream tasks. To address this, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)\nmethods have been developed, but they often underperform compared to full\nfine-tuning and struggle with memory efficiency. In this work, we introduce\nGradient Weight-Normalized Low-Rank Projection (GradNormLoRP), a novel approach\nthat enhances both parameter and memory efficiency while maintaining comparable\nperformance to full fine-tuning. GradNormLoRP normalizes the weight matrix to\nimprove gradient conditioning, facilitating better convergence during\noptimization. Additionally, it applies low-rank approximations to the weight\nand gradient matrices, significantly reducing memory usage during training.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our 8-bit GradNormLoRP reduces optimizer\nmemory usage by up to 89.5% and enables the pre-training of large LLMs, such as\nLLaMA 7B, on consumer-level GPUs like the NVIDIA RTX 4090, without additional\ninference costs. Moreover, GradNormLoRP outperforms existing low-rank methods\nin fine-tuning tasks. For instance, when fine-tuning the RoBERTa model on all\nGLUE tasks with a rank of 8, GradNormLoRP achieves an average score of 80.65,\nsurpassing LoRA's score of 79.23. These results underscore GradNormLoRP as a\npromising alternative for efficient LLM pre-training and fine-tuning.

While metal-nitrogen-carbon (M-N-C) single-atom\ncatalysts have emerged as promising candidates for NO3RR, the\nstructure-activity relations underlying their catalytic behavior remain to be\nelucidated. Through systematic analysis of reported experimental data and\npH-field coupled microkinetic modelling on a reversible hydrogen electrode\n(RHE) scale, we reveal that the coordination-dependent activity originates from\ndistinct scaling relations governed by metal-intermediate interactions.\nM-N-Pyrrolic catalysts demonstrate higher turnover frequencies for ammonia\nproduction, whereas M-N-Pyridinic catalysts exhibit broader activity ranges\nacross the activity volcano plot. Meanwhile, the adsorption and protonation of\nnitrate, which is a step often dismissed and/or assumed to be simultaneous in\nmany previous reports, is identified to be the rate-determining step (RDS) in\nNO3RR. Remarkably, our subsequent experimental validation confirms the\ntheoretical predictions under both neutral and alkaline conditions. This study\noffers a comprehensive mechanistic framework for interpreting the\nelectrocatalytic activity of M-N-C catalysts in NO3RR, showing that a classical\nthermodynamic limiting-potential model is not sufficiently accurate to capture\nthe RDS and the catalytic performance trends of different materials (even on\nM-N-Pyrrolic and M-N-Pyridinic catalysts).

We propose that clustered DSBs\nin DNA segments with high interaction frequencies are more susceptible to\nleading to cell death than isolated DSBs. Topologically associating domains\n(TAD) can be regarded as the reference unit for evaluating the impact of DSB\nclustering in the 3D genome. To quantify this correlation between the DSB\ndistribution in 3D genome and radiation-induced effect, we developed a\nsimplified model considering the DSB distribution across TADs. Utilizing\ntrack-structure Monte Carlo codes to simulate the electron and carbon ion\nirradiation, we calculated the incidence of each case across a variety of\nradiation doses and LETs. Our simulation results indicate that DSBs in TADs\nwith frequent interactions (case 3) are significantly more likely to induce\ncell death than clustered DSBs within a single TAD (case 2). Moreover, case 2\nis significantly more likely to induce cell death than isolated DSBs (case 1).\nThe curves of the incidence of case 2 and case 3 versus LETs have a similar\nshape to the radiation quality factor used in radiation protection.

We study a new family of graph games which combine\nstochastic environmental uncertainties and auction-based interactions among the\nagents, formalized as bidding games on (finite) Markov decision processes\n(MDP). Normally, on MDPs, a single decision-maker chooses a sequence of\nactions, producing a probability distribution over infinite paths. In bidding\ngames on MDPs, two players -- called the reachability and safety players -- bid\nfor the privilege of choosing the next action at each step. The reachability\nplayer's goal is to maximize the probability of reaching a target vertex,\nwhereas the safety player's goal is to minimize it. These games generalize\ntraditional bidding games on graphs, and the existing analysis techniques do\nnot extend. For instance, the central property of traditional bidding games is\nthe existence of a threshold budget, which is a necessary and sufficient budget\nto guarantee winning for the reachability player. For MDPs, the threshold\nbecomes a relation between the budgets and probabilities of reaching the\ntarget. We devise value-iteration algorithms that approximate thresholds and\noptimal policies for general MDPs, and compute the exact solutions for acyclic\nMDPs, and show that finding thresholds is at least as hard as solving\nsimple-stochastic games.",

In this paper, we propose a\npolynomial-time algorithm for ground state preparation which only relies on the\n$\\textit{existence}$ of a physical bath which achieves the same task, while a\ndetailed description of the environment may remain $\\textit{unknown}$. In\nparticular, we show that this ``super-bath quantum eigensolver algorithm''\nprepares the ground state of the system by combining a Gaussian stabilization\ndephasing procedure with the simulation of the interaction between the system\nand a super-bath which only requires minimal knowledge of the physical\nenvironment. Based on our algorithmic framework, we establish a partial order\nrelation among environments. Supported by experimental lifetime data of nuclear\nmetastable states, we suggest that our algorithm is applicable to determine\nnuclear ground states in polynomial time. These results highlight the potential\nadvantage of quantum computing in addressing ground state problems in\nreal-world physical systems.",

The results of the Hubbard+U algorithm indicate\nthat the band gap of BZCT is reduced. Concurrently, the enhanced ferroelectric\npolarization increases the built-in electric field of the material,\nfacilitating the separation of photogenerated carriers and improving optical\nabsorption.

A distinct origin of the PLexp is suggested by significant\ndifferences between its time histories and those of the PL and nuclear\ncomponents. RHESSI imaging/spectroscopy of the 2005 January 20 flare, reveals\nthat the PL and nuclear components come from the footpoints while the PLexp\ncomponent comes from the corona. While the index and flux of the anisotropic PL\ncomponent are strongly dependent on the flares' heliocentric angle, the PLexp\nparameters show no such dependency and are consistent with a component that is\nisotropic. The PLexp spectrum is flat at low energies and rolls over at a few\nMeV.

The novelty of this work stems from aiming to address the task of\nmaintaining an intuitive and multi-resolution scene representation, while\nsimultaneously offering a tractable foundation for planning and scene\nunderstanding during an ongoing inspection mission of apriori unknown\ntargets-of-interest in an unknown environment. The proposed LSG scheme is\ncomposed of locally nested hierarchical graphs, at multiple layers of\nabstraction, with the abstract concepts grounded on the functionality of the\nintegrated FLIE planner. Furthermore, LSG encapsulates real-time semantic\nsegmentation models that offer extraction and localization of desired semantic\nelements within the hierarchical representation. This extends the capability of\nthe inspection planner, which can then leverage LSG to make an informed\ndecision to inspect a particular semantic of interest. We also emphasize the\nhierarchical and semantic path-planning capabilities of LSG, which could extend\ninspection missions by improving situational awareness for human operators in\nan unknown environment. The validity of the proposed scheme is proven through\nextensive evaluations of the proposed architecture in simulations, as well as\nexperimental field deployments on a Boston Dynamics Spot quadruped robot in\nurban outdoor environment settings.",

Recently, to tackle with\nunoriented edges or latent assumptions violation suffered by conventional\nmethods, researchers formulated a reinforcement learning (RL) procedure for\ncausal discovery, and equipped REINFORCE algorithm to search for the\nbest-rewarded directed acyclic graph. The two keys to the overall performance\nof the procedure are the robustness of RL methods and the efficient encoding of\nvariables. However, on the one hand, REINFORCE is prone to local convergence\nand unstable performance during training. Neither trust region policy\noptimization, being computationally-expensive, nor proximal policy optimization\n(PPO), suffering from aggregate constraint deviation, is decent alternative for\ncombinatory optimization problems with considerable individual subactions. We\npropose a trust region-navigated clipping policy optimization method for causal\ndiscovery that guarantees both better search efficiency and steadiness in\npolicy optimization, in comparison with REINFORCE, PPO and our prioritized\nsampling-guided REINFORCE implementation. On the other hand, to boost the\nefficient encoding of variables, we propose a refined graph attention encoder\ncalled SDGAT that can grasp more feature information without priori\nneighbourhood information.

Recent AIS research focuses on\nenhancing proposal adaptation for high-dimensional problems, while addressing\nthe challenge of multi-modal targets. In this paper, a new class of AIS methods\nis presented, utilizing a hybrid approach that incorporates weighted samples\nand proposal distributions to enhance performance. This approach belongs to the\nfamily of population Monte Carlo (PMC) algorithms, where a population of\nproposals is adapted to better approximate the target distribution. The\nproposed hybrid population Monte Carlo (HPMC) implements a novel two-step\nadaptation mechanism. In the first step, a hybrid method is used to generate\nthe population of the preliminary proposal locations based on both weighted\nsamples and location parameters. We use Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) to\ngenerate the preliminary proposal locations. HMC has a good exploratory\nbehavior, especially in high dimension scenarios. In the second step, the novel\ncooperation algorithms are performing to find the final proposals for the next\niteration.

To efficiently achieve a specified error tolerance, we introduce an\nadaptive quadrature method with automatic parameter adjustment for axisymmetric\nsurfaces, facilitated by error estimation. Notably, while each surface must be\naxisymmetric, the integrand itself need not be, allowing for applications with\ncomplex geometries featuring multiple axisymmetric bodies.\n  The proposed quadrature method utilizes so-called interpolatory\nsemi-analytical quadrature in conjunction with a singularity swap technique in\nthe azimuthal angle. In the polar angle, such a technique is used as needed,\ndepending on the integral kernel, combined with an adaptive subdivision of the\nintegration interval. The method is tied to a regular quadrature method that\nemploys a trapezoidal rule in the azimuthal angle and a Gauss-Legendre\nquadrature rule in the polar angle, which will be used whenever deemed\nsufficiently accurate, as determined by a quadrature error estimate [C.\nSorgentone and A.-K.

    "abstract": "Planning safe paths in 3D workspace for high DoF robotic systems, such as\nmanipulators, is a challenging problem, especially when the environment is\npopulated with the dynamic obstacles that need to be avoided. In this case the\ntime dimension should be taken into account that further increases the\ncomplexity of planning. To mitigate this issue we suggest to combine\nsafe-interval path planning (a prominent technique in heuristic search) with\nthe randomized planning, specifically, with the bidirectional rapidly-exploring\nrandom trees (RRT-Connect) - a fast and efficient algorithm for\nhigh-dimensional planning. Leveraging a dedicated technique of fast computation\nof the safe intervals we end up with an efficient planner dubbed SI-RRT. We\ncompare it with the state of the art and show that SI-RRT consistently\noutperforms the competitors both in runtime and solution cost.\n  Our implementation of SI-RRT is publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/PathPlanning/ManipulationPlanning-SI-RRT",

We employ a single, unifying\ngeneralisation for this purpose: in essence, a lowest Landau level projection\ndefining a non-commutative, fuzzy sphere with position coordinates proportional\nto SU(2) generators of matrix representation size $N\\times N$, may host an\nintrinsically 2+1 dimensional, topologically non-trivial many-body state for\nsmall $N$ as well as large $N$. That is, isospin degrees of freedom associated\nwith a matrix Lie algebra with $N \\times N$ generators potentially encode some\nfinite number of spatial dimensions for $N\\ge 2$, a regime in which isospin has\npreviously been treated as a label. This statement extends to more general\n$p$-branes subjected to severe fuzzification as well as membranes. As a\nconsequence of this generalisation, systems with $d$ Cartesian spatial\ncoordinates and isospin degrees of freedom encoding an additional $\\delta$\nfuzzy coset space coordinates can realise topologically non-trivial states of\nintrinsic dimensionality up to $d$+$\\delta$+1. We therefore identify gauge\ntheories with extra fuzzy dimensions generalised to retain dependence upon\ngauge fields over fuzzy coset spaces even for severe fuzzification (small $N$),\nas EFTs for the QSkHE. We furthermore generalise these EFTs to space manifolds\nwith local product structure exploiting the dimensional hierarchy of (fuzzy)\nspheres. For this purpose, we introduce methods of anisotropic fuzzification\nand propose formulating topological invariants on fuzzy coset spaces as\nartifacts of projecting matrix Lie algebras to occupied subspaces. Importantly,\nwe focus on phenomenology indicating the 2+1 D SU(2) gauge theory should be\ngeneralised using this machinery, and serves as a minimal EFT of the QSkHE.",

The\ninterplay between coupling strength and diffusivity of bath particle\nsignificantly impacts both the tracer's relaxation dynamics and search time,\nwith external forces further modulating these effects. Our analysis identifies\ndistinct hot and cold bath particles based on their diffusivities, revealing\nthat coupling to a hot particle facilitates the searching process, whereas\ncoupling to a cold particle hinders it.

Single-qubit\ngates using Rabi oscillation, which is based on the rotating wave approximation\n(RWA), satisfy this bound in the form that the gate time $T$ is inversely\nproportional to the Rabi frequency $\\Omega$, characterizing the driving\nstrength. However, if the gate time is comparable or shorter than the qubit\nperiod $T_{0} \\equiv 2\\pi / \\omega_{0}$, the RWA actually breaks down since the\nRabi frequency has to be large compared to the qubit frequency $\\omega_{0}$ due\nto the QSL, which is given as $T \\gtrsim \\pi/\\Omega$.

    "abstract": "Wet extreme mass-ratio inspirals (wet EMRIs), which arise from stellar-mass\nblack holes (sBHs) inspiral into supermassive black holes (SMBHs) within the\ngas-rich environments of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), are primary sources of\ngravitational waves (GWs) for space-borne detectors like LISA, TianQin, and\nTaiji. Unlike \"dry EMRIs\", which form through gravitational scattering in\nnuclear star clusters, wet EMRIs are naturally accompanied by interactions with\naccretion disks, offering rich multi-messenger science opportunities. They are\ndistinct in generating transient electromagnetic (EM) signals, such as\nquasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs), which serve as valuable probes of accretion\ndisk physics and SMBH environments. Their GW signals provide an unprecedented\nprecision of the order of $O(10^{-4}\\sim 10^{-6})$ in measuring SMBH mass and\nspin, enabling the calibration of traditional EM techniques and offering\ninsights into jet formation models. Additionally, wet EMRIs serve as bright and\ndark sirens for cosmology, facilitating percent-level precision measurements of\nHubble parameter through AGN host identification or statistical association.\nThese systems hold immense potential for advancing our understanding of black\nhole dynamics, accretion physics, and cosmology.",

For MR-Fingerprinting-like approaches, this problem can\nbe addressed with self-navigated retrospective motion correction based on\nreconstructions in a singular value decomposition (SVD) subspace. However, the\nSVD promotes high signal intensity in all tissues, which limits the contrast\nbetween tissue types and ultimately reduces the accuracy of registration. The\npurpose of this paper is to rotate the subspace for maximum contrast between\ntwo types of tissue and improve the accuracy of motion estimates.\n  Methods: A subspace is derived that promotes contrasts between brain\nparenchyma and CSF, achieved through the generalized eigendecomposition of mean\nautocorrelation matrices, followed by a Gram-Schmidt process to maintain\northogonality. We tested our motion correction method on 85 scans with varying\nmotion levels, acquired with a 3D hybrid-state sequence optimized for\nquantitative magnetization transfer imaging.\n  Results: A comparative analysis shows that the contrast-optimized basis\nsignificantly improve the parenchyma-CSF contrast, leading to smoother motion\nestimates and reduced artifacts in the quantitative maps.\n  Conclusion: The proposed contrast-optimized subspace improves the accuracy of\nthe motion estimation.",

However, considering that the knowledge state is\ninfluenced by various learning factors in the interaction process, such as the\nexercises similarities, responses reliability and the learner's learning state.\nPrevious models still face two major limitations. First, due to the exercises\ndifferences caused by various complex reasons and the unreliability of\nresponses caused by guessing behavior, it is hard to locate the historical\ninteraction which is most relevant to the current answered exercise. Second,\nthe learning state is also a key factor to influence the knowledge state, which\nis always ignored by previous methods. To address these issues, we propose a\nnew method named Learning State Enhanced Knowledge Tracing (LSKT). Firstly, to\nsimulate the potential differences in interactions, inspired by Item Response\nTheory~(IRT) paradigm, we designed three different embedding methods ranging\nfrom coarse-grained to fine-grained views and conduct comparative analysis on\nthem. Secondly, we design a learning state extraction module to capture the\nchanging learning state during the learning process of the learner. In turn,\nwith the help of the extracted learning state, a more detailed knowledge state\ncould be captured.

These strategies are experimentally feasible,\nefficient and possess a concise analytical expression for the sample complexity\nof the rotation strategy, which scales approximately as\n$2.248\\epsilon^{-1}\\ln\\delta^{-1}$, where $\\epsilon$ is the infidelity and\n$1-\\delta$ is the confidence level. Furthermore, we comprehensively analyze the\ntwo-dimensional two-qubit subspaces and classify them into three distinct\ntypes, which include unverifiable entangled subspaces, revealing intrinsic\nlimitations in local verification of entangled subspaces.",

Quantization of\ndiffusion models has been explored in recent works to reduce compute costs and\nmemory bandwidth usage. To further improve inference time, fast convolution\nalgorithms such as Winograd can be used for convolution layers, which account\nfor a significant portion of computations in diffusion models. However, the\nsignificant quality loss of fully quantized Winograd using existing\ncoarser-grained post-training quantization methods, combined with the\ncomplexity and cost of finetuning the Winograd transformation matrices for such\nlarge models to recover quality, makes them unsuitable for large-scale\nfoundation models. Motivated by the presence of a large range of values in\nthem, we investigate the impact of finer-grained group-wise quantization in\nquantizing diffusion models. While group-wise quantization can largely handle\nthe fully quantized Winograd convolution, it struggles to deal with the large\ndistribution imbalance in a sizable portion of the Winograd domain computation.\nTo reduce range differences in the Winograd domain, we propose finetuning only\nthe scale parameters of the Winograd transform matrices without using any\ndomain-specific training data. Because our method does not depend on any\ntraining data, the generalization performance of quantized diffusion models is\nsafely guaranteed. For text-to-image generation task, the 8-bit fully-quantized\ndiffusion model with Winograd provides near-lossless quality (FID and CLIP\nscores) in comparison to the full-precision model.

These limitations impede their practicality in various real-world\nscenarios, including the use on devices like iPhones and laptops.

Using magneto-Raman spectroscopy as an\noptical probe of magnetic structure, we show that one of these Raman-active\nmodes in the magnetically ordered state is a magnon with a frequency of 3.7 THz\n(~ 122 cm-1). In addition, one magnon band and three phonon bands are coupled\nvia the magneto-elastic coupling evidenced by anti-crossing in the complete\nspectra. We consider a simple model involving only in-plane nearest neighbor\nexchange couplings (designed to give rise to a similar magnetic structure) and\nperpendicular anisotropy in presence of an out-of-plane magnetic field. Exact\ndiagonalization of the Hamiltonian leads to energy bands which show that the\ninteraction term gives rise to avoided crossings between the hybridized magnon\nand phonon branches.

Thus we focus here on scenarios where\nthere is high uncertainty about term probabilities, and explore how this\nuncertainty influences the comparative inferential conclusions of the two\nsystems.

Although some successes have been made, existing\nmethods are either Sparse-View but require accurate camera parameters (i.e.,\nintrinsic and extrinsic), or SfM-free but need densely captured images. To\ncombine the advantages of both methods while addressing their respective\nweaknesses, we propose Dust to Tower (D2T), an accurate and efficient\ncoarse-to-fine framework to optimize 3DGS and image poses simultaneously from\nsparse and uncalibrated images. Our key idea is to first construct a coarse\nmodel efficiently and subsequently refine it using warped and inpainted images\nat novel viewpoints. To do this, we first introduce a Coarse Construction\nModule (CCM) which exploits a fast Multi-View Stereo model to initialize a 3D\nGaussian Splatting (3DGS) and recover initial camera poses. To refine the 3D\nmodel at novel viewpoints, we propose a Confidence Aware Depth Alignment (CADA)\nmodule to refine the coarse depth maps by aligning their confident parts with\nestimated depths by a Mono-depth model. Then, a Warped Image-Guided Inpainting\n(WIGI) module is proposed to warp the training images to novel viewpoints by\nthe refined depth maps, and inpainting is applied to fulfill the ``holes\" in\nthe warped images caused by view-direction changes, providing high-quality\nsupervision to further optimize the 3D model and the camera poses. Extensive\nexperiments and ablation studies demonstrate the validity of D2T and its design\nchoices, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both tasks of novel view\nsynthesis and pose estimation while keeping high efficiency.

Traditionally, the parameters in DEs are\nadjusted to fit data from system observations. However, in fields such as\npolitics, economics, and biology, available data are often independently\ncollected at distinct time points from different subjects (i.e., repeated\ncross-sectional (RCS) data). Conventional optimization techniques struggle to\naccurately estimate DE parameters when RCS data exhibit various\nheterogeneities, leading to a significant loss of information. To address this\nissue, we propose a new estimation method called the emulator-informed\ndeep-generative model (EIDGM), designed to handle RCS data. Specifically, EIDGM\nintegrates a physics-informed neural network-based emulator that immediately\ngenerates DE solutions and a Wasserstein generative adversarial network-based\nparameter generator that can effectively mimic the RCS data. We evaluated EIDGM\non exponential growth, logistic population models, and the Lorenz system,\ndemonstrating its superior ability to accurately capture parameter\ndistributions. Additionally, we applied EIDGM to an experimental dataset of\nAmyloid beta 40 and beta 42, successfully capturing diverse parameter\ndistribution shapes.

Recently, machine learning models with radiomic features have improved\nradiation pneumonitis prediction by capturing spatial information. To further\nsupport clinical decision-making, this study explores the role of post hoc\nuncertainty quantification methods in enhancing model uncertainty estimate.\nMethods: We retrospectively analyzed a cohort of 101 esophageal cancer\npatients. This study evaluated four machine learning models: logistic\nregression, support vector machines, extreme gradient boosting, and random\nforest, using 15 dosimetric, 79 dosiomic, and 237 radiomic features to predict\nradiation pneumonitis. We applied uncertainty quantification methods, including\nPlatt scaling, isotonic regression, Venn-ABERS predictor, and conformal\nprediction, to quantify uncertainty. Model performance was assessed through an\narea under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), area under the\nprecision-recall curve (AUPRC), and adaptive calibration error using\nleave-one-out cross-validation. Results: Highest AUROC is achieved by the\nlogistic regression model with the conformal prediction method (AUROC\n0.75+-0.01, AUPRC 0.74+-0.01) at a certainty cut point of 0.8. Highest AUPRC of\n0.82+-0.02 (with AUROC of 0.67+-0.04) achieved by The extreme gradient boosting\nmodel with conformal prediction at the 0.9 certainty threshold. Radiomic and\ndosiomic features improve both discriminative and calibration performance.\nConclusions: Integrating uncertainty quantification into machine learning\nmodels with radiomic and dosiomic features may improve both predictive accuracy\nand calibration, supporting more reliable clinical decision-making.

The large parameter size of VLMs brings large memory and\ncomputation overhead which poses significant challenges for deployment.\nPost-Training Quantization (PTQ) is an effective technique to reduce the memory\nand computation overhead. Existing PTQ methods mainly focus on large language\nmodels (LLMs), without considering the differences across other modalities. In\nthis paper, we discover that there is a significant difference in sensitivity\nbetween language and vision tokens in large VLMs. Therefore, treating tokens\nfrom different modalities equally, as in existing PTQ methods, may\nover-emphasize the insensitive modalities, leading to significant accuracy\nloss. To deal with the above issue, we propose a simple yet effective method,\nModality-Balanced Quantization (MBQ), for large VLMs. Specifically, MBQ\nincorporates the different sensitivities across modalities during the\ncalibration process to minimize the reconstruction loss for better quantization\nparameters. Extensive experiments show that MBQ can significantly improve task\naccuracy by up to 4.4% and 11.6% under W3 and W4A8 quantization for 7B to 70B\nVLMs, compared to SOTA baselines.

Existing constraint-based\nlocal causal discovery methods use AND or OR rules in constructing the local\ncausal skeleton, but using either rule alone is prone to produce cascading\nerrors in the learned local causal skeleton, and thus impacting the inference\nof local causal relationships. On the other hand, directly applying score-based\nglobal causal discovery methods to local causal discovery may randomly return\nincorrect results due to the existence of local equivalence classes. To address\nthe above issues, we propose a Hybrid Local Causal Discovery algorithm, called\nHLCD. Specifically, HLCD initially utilizes a constraint-based approach\ncombined with the OR rule to obtain a candidate skeleton and then employs a\nscore-based method to eliminate redundant portions in the candidate skeleton.\nFurthermore, during the local causal orientation phase, HLCD distinguishes\nbetween V-structures and equivalence classes by comparing the local structure\nscores between the two, thereby avoiding orientation interference caused by\nlocal equivalence classes. We conducted extensive experiments with seven\nstate-of-the-art competitors on 14 benchmark Bayesian network datasets, and the\nexperimental results demonstrate that HLCD significantly outperforms existing\nlocal causal discovery algorithms.",

Current researches on privacy assessment for LVLMs is limited in\nscope, with gaps in both assessment dimensions and privacy categories. To\nbridge this gap, we propose Multi-P$^2$A, a comprehensive benchmark for\nevaluating the privacy preservation capabilities of LVLMs in terms of privacy\nawareness and leakage.

Engineering\nhigh-coherence qubits requires materials optimization. In this work, we present\ntwo superconducting thin film systems, grown on silicon (Si), and one obtained\nfrom the other via annealing. Cobalt (Co) thin films grown on Si were found to\nbe superconducting [EPL 131 (2020) 47001]. These films also happen to be a\nself-organised hybrid superconductor/ferromagnet/superconductor (S/F/S)\nstructure. The S/F/S hybrids are important for superconducting $\\pi$-qubits\n[PRL 95 (2005) 097001] and in quantum information processing. Here we present\nour results on the superconductivity of a hybrid Co film followed by the\nsuperconductivity of a CoSi$_2$ film, which was prepared by annealing the Co\nfilm. CoSi$_2$, with its $1/f$ noise about three orders of magnitude smaller\ncompared to the most commonly used superconductor aluminium (Al), is a\npromising material for high-coherence qubits. The hybrid Co film revealed\nsuperconducting transition temperature $T_c$ = 5 K and anisotropy in the upper\ncritical field between the in-plane and out-of-plane directions. The anisotropy\nwas of the order of ratio of lateral dimensions to thickness of the\nsuperconducting Co grains, suggesting a quasi-2D nature of superconductivity.\nOn the other hand, CoSi$_2$ film showed a $T_c$ of 900 mK. In the resistivity\nvs. temperature curve, we observe a peak near $T_c$. Magnetic field scan as a\nfunction of $T$ shows a monotonic increase in intensity of this peak with\ntemperature. The origin of the peak has been explained in terms of parallel\nresistive model for the particular measurement configuration. Although our\nCoSi$_2$ film contains grain boundaries, we observed a perpendicular critical\nfield of 15 mT and a critical current density of 3.8x10$^7$ A/m$^2$, comparable\nwith epitaxial CoSi$_2$ films.",

However, these methods usually rely on a pre-defined\nsemantic class set, thus needing additional image annotation and model training\nwhen adapting to new classes. More importantly, they are unable to segment\narbitrary semantic classes. In this work, we introduce Open-Vocabulary Remote\nSensing Image Semantic Segmentation (OVRSISS), which aims to segment arbitrary\nsemantic classes in remote sensing images. To address the lack of OVRSISS\ndatasets, we develop LandDiscover50K, a comprehensive dataset of 51,846 images\ncovering 40 diverse semantic classes. In addition, we propose a novel framework\nnamed GSNet that integrates domain priors from special remote sensing models\nand versatile capabilities of general vision-language models. Technically,\nGSNet consists of a Dual-Stream Image Encoder (DSIE), a Query-Guided Feature\nFusion (QGFF), and a Residual Information Preservation Decoder (RIPD). DSIE\nfirst captures comprehensive features from both special models and general\nmodels in dual streams. Then, with the guidance of variable vocabularies, QGFF\nintegrates specialist and generalist features, enabling them to complement each\nother. Finally, RIPD is proposed to aggregate multi-source features for more\naccurate mask predictions. Experiments show that our method outperforms other\nmethods by a large margin, and our proposed LandDiscover50K improves the\nperformance of OVRSISS methods.

    "abstract": "Live animation has gained immense popularity for enhancing online engagement,\nyet achieving high-quality, real-time, and stable animation with diffusion\nmodels remains challenging, especially on consumer-grade GPUs. Existing methods\nstruggle with generating long, consistent video streams efficiently, often\nbeing limited by latency issues and degraded visual quality over extended\nperiods. In this paper, we introduce RAIN, a pipeline solution capable of\nanimating infinite video streams in real-time with low latency using a single\nRTX 4090 GPU. The core idea of RAIN is to efficiently compute frame-token\nattention across different noise levels and long time-intervals while\nsimultaneously denoising a significantly larger number of frame-tokens than\nprevious stream-based methods. This design allows RAIN to generate video frames\nwith much shorter latency and faster speed, while maintaining long-range\nattention over extended video streams, resulting in enhanced continuity and\nconsistency. Consequently, a Stable Diffusion model fine-tuned with RAIN in\njust a few epochs can produce video streams in real-time and low latency\nwithout much compromise in quality or consistency, up to infinite long. Despite\nits advanced capabilities, the RAIN only introduces a few additional 1D\nattention blocks, imposing minimal additional burden. Experiments in benchmark\ndatasets and generating super-long videos demonstrating that RAIN can animate\ncharacters in real-time with much better quality, accuracy, and consistency\nthan competitors while costing less latency.

This issue is addressed using cross-interactive\nresidual smoothing (CIRS). This approach improves convergence behavior and\nreduces the residual gap. Similar to how the standard Lanczos-type solvers have\nbeen extended to global and block versions for solving systems with multiple\nright-hand sides, CIRS can also be extended to these versions.

SCI is a cost-effective method that enables the\nrecording of high-dimensional data, such as hyperspectral or temporal\ninformation, into a single image using low-cost 2D imaging sensors. To achieve\nthis, a series of specially designed 2D masks are usually employed, reducing\nstorage and transmission requirements and offering potential privacy\nprotection. Inspired by this, we take one step further to recover the encoded\n3D scene information leveraging powerful 3D scene representation capabilities\nof neural radiance fields (NeRF). Specifically, we propose SCINeRF, in which we\nformulate the physical imaging process of SCI as part of the training of NeRF,\nallowing us to exploit its impressive performance in capturing complex scene\nstructures.

    "abstract": "Legal question answering (QA) has attracted increasing attention from people\nseeking legal advice, which aims to retrieve the most applicable answers from a\nlarge-scale database of question-answer pairs. Previous methods mainly use a\ndual-encoder architecture to learn dense representations of both questions and\nanswers. However, these methods could suffer from lacking domain knowledge and\nsufficient labeled training data. In this paper, we propose a three-stage\n(\\underline{p}re-training, \\underline{f}ine-tuning and \\underline{r}e-ranking)\nframework for \\underline{l}egal \\underline{QA} (called PFR-LQA), which promotes\nthe fine-grained text representation learning and boosts the performance of\ndense retrieval with the dual-encoder architecture. Concretely, we first\nconduct domain-specific pre-training on legal questions and answers through a\nself-supervised training objective, allowing the pre-trained model to be\nadapted to the legal domain. Then, we perform task-specific fine-tuning of the\ndual-encoder on legal question-answer pairs by using the supervised learning\nobjective, leading to a high-quality dual-encoder for the specific downstream\nQA task. Finally, we employ a contextual re-ranking objective to further refine\nthe output representations of questions produced by the document encoder, which\nuses contextual similarity to increase the discrepancy between the anchor and\nhard negative samples for better question re-ranking. We conduct extensive\nexperiments on a manually annotated legal QA dataset. Experimental results show\nthat our PFR-LQA method achieves better performance than the strong competitors\nfor legal question answering.",

    "abstract": "Active noise control typically employs adaptive filtering to generate\nsecondary noise, where the least mean square algorithm is the most widely used.\nHowever, traditional updating rules are linear and exhibit limited\neffectiveness in addressing nonlinear environments and nonstationary noise. To\ntackle this challenge, we reformulate the active noise control problem as a\nmeta-learning problem and propose a meta-learning-based delayless subband\nadaptive filter with deep neural networks. The core idea is to utilize a neural\nnetwork as an adaptive algorithm that can adapt to different environments and\ntypes of noise. The neural network will train under noisy observations,\nimplying that it recognizes the optimized updating rule without true labels. A\nsingle-headed attention recurrent neural network is devised with learnable\nfeature embedding to update the adaptive filter weight efficiently, enabling\naccurate computation of the secondary source to attenuate the unwanted primary\nnoise. In order to relax the time constraint on updating the adaptive filter\nweights, the delayless subband architecture is employed, which will allow the\nsystem to be updated less frequently as the downsampling factor increases. In\naddition, the delayless subband architecture does not introduce additional time\ndelays in active noise control systems. A skip updating strategy is introduced\nto decrease the updating frequency further so that machines with limited\nresources have more possibility to board our meta-learning-based model.\nExtensive multi-condition training ensures generalization and robustness\nagainst various types of noise and environments.

However, existing ISAC\nsystems are based on fixed-position antennas (FPAs), which inevitably incur a\nloss in performance when balancing the trade-off between sensing and\ncommunication. Movable antenna (MA) technology offers promising potential to\nenhance ISAC performance by enabling flexible antenna movement. Nevertheless,\nexploiting more spatial channel variations requires larger antenna moving\nregions, which may invalidate the conventional far-field assumption for\nchannels between transceivers. Therefore, this paper utilizes the MA to enhance\nsensing and communication capabilities in near-field ISAC systems, where a\nfull-duplex base station (BS) is equipped with multiple transmit and receive\nMAs movable in large-size regions to simultaneously sense multiple targets and\nserve multiple uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) users for communication.

Methods: To\naddress these limitations, we propose a novel Multiscale Network with\nSpatial-enhanced Attention (MNet-SAt) for polyp segmentation in colonoscopy\nimages. This framework incorporates four key modules: Edge-Guided Feature\nEnrichment (EGFE) preserves edge information for improved boundary quality;\nMulti-Scale Feature Aggregator (MSFA) extracts and aggregates multi-scale\nfeatures across channel spatial dimensions, focusing on salient regions;\nSpatial-Enhanced Attention (SEAt) captures spatial-aware global dependencies\nwithin the multi-scale aggregated features, emphasizing the region of interest;\nand Channel-Enhanced Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (CE-ASPP) resamples and\nrecalibrates attentive features across scales. Results: We evaluated MNet-SAt\non the Kvasir-SEG and CVC-ClinicDB datasets, achieving Dice Similarity\nCoefficients of 96.61% and 98.60%, respectively. Conclusion: Both quantitative\n(DSC) and qualitative assessments highlight MNet-SAt's superior performance and\ngeneralization capabilities compared to existing methods.

The velocity vector (components and magnitude) undergoes a change too,\nakin to a `velocity kick'. The cause behind this permanent change appears to be\nlinked to the difference between the vector potentials before and after the\nduration of the electric pulse.

    "abstract": "Simulating open quantum systems is an essential technique for understanding\ncomplex physical phenomena and advancing quantum technologies. Some quantum\nalgorithms for simulating Lindblad dynamics achieve logarithmically short\ncircuit depth in terms of accuracy $\\varepsilon$ by coherently encoding all\npossible jump processes with a large ancilla consumption. Minimizing the space\ncomplexity while achieving such a logarithmic depth remains an important\nchallenge. In this work, we present a quantum algorithm for simulating general\nLindblad dynamics with multiple jump operators aimed at an observable\nestimation, that achieves both a logarithmically short circuit depth and a\nminimum ancilla size. Toward simulating an exponentially accurate Taylor\nexpansion of the Lindblad propagator to ensure the circuit depth of\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\log(1/\\varepsilon))$, we develop a novel random circuit\ncompilation method that leverages dissipative processes with only a single jump\noperator; importantly, the proposed method requires the minimal-size, $4 +\n\\lceil \\log M \\rceil$, ancilla qubits where each single jump operator has at\nmost $M$ Pauli strings. Furthermore, the gate complexity depends on neither the\nnumber of terms in Hamiltonian nor the number of jump operators, owing to the\nrandom compilation. This work represents a significant step towards making open\nquantum system simulations more feasible on early fault-tolerant quantum\ncomputing devices.",

Herein, we report a study of the optical properties and application in\nthe field enhancement of silver nanoplates (Ag-Nplates) obtained by two-step\nchemical synthesis. Optical Extinction Spectroscopy (OES), together with a\ndetailed theoretical analysis of the experimental spectra, was used to\ncharacterize the size distribution, morphology, and optical spectral behavior\nof the obtained suspensions.

A decrease in the Ag-Seed amount produces an infrared\nshift of the main plasmon peak with respect to the neat Ag-Seeds suspension,\nwhich is related to the size growth of Ag-Nplates showing size distributions\ncentered in the edge length range of 12-15 nm and 34-36 nm for the experimental\nspectra, whose plasmon peak positions are at 543 nm (higher Ag-Seeds\nconcentration) and 815 nm (lower Ag-Seed concentration), respectively.

    "abstract": "Existing asteroseismic rotational measurements assume that stars rotate\naround a single axis. However, tidal torques from misaligned companions, or\ntheir possible engulfment, may bring the rotational axis of a star's envelope\nout of alignment with its core, breaking azimuthal symmetry. I derive\nperturbative expressions for asteroseismic signatures of such hitherto\nunexamined rotational configurations, under the ``shellular approximation'' of\nconstant rotation rates on radially stratified mass shells. In the aligned\ncase, the distribution of power between multiplet components is determined by\nthe inclination of the rotational axis; radial differential misalignment causes\nthis to vary from multiplet to multiplet. I examine in particular detail the\nphenomenology of gravitoacoustic mixed modes as seen in evolved sub- and red\ngiants, where near-resonance avoided crossings may break geometrical\ndegeneracies. Upon applying the revised asteroseismic observational methodology\nthat results from this theoretical discussion to revisit Kepler-56 -- a red\ngiant with a misaligned planetary system -- I find that its core and envelope\nrotate around different rotational axes. While the rotational axis of its core\nis indeed misaligned from the orbit normal of its transiting planets\n(consistently with earlier studies), its envelope's rotational axis is close to\nlying in the sky plane, and may well be aligned with them. More detailed\nasteroseismic modelling, and spectroscopic follow-up, will be required to fully\nelucidate the full spin-orbit geometry of the Kepler-56 system, and potentially\ndiscriminate between hypotheses for how it formed.",

    "abstract": "This study proposes a knowledge distillation algorithm based on large\nlanguage models and feature alignment, aiming to effectively transfer the\nknowledge of large pre-trained models into lightweight student models, thereby\nreducing computational costs while maintaining high model performance.\nDifferent from the traditional soft label distillation method, this method\nintroduces a multi-layer feature alignment strategy to deeply align the\nintermediate features and attention mechanisms of the teacher model and the\nstudent model, maximally retaining the semantic expression ability and context\nmodeling ability of the teacher model. In terms of method design, a multi-task\nloss function is constructed, including feature matching loss, attention\nalignment loss, and output distribution matching loss, to ensure multi-level\ninformation transfer through joint optimization. The experiments were\ncomprehensively evaluated on the GLUE data set and various natural language\nprocessing tasks. The results show that the proposed model performs very close\nto the state-of-the-art GPT-4 model in terms of evaluation indicators such as\nperplexity, BLEU, ROUGE, and CER. At the same time, it far exceeds baseline\nmodels such as DeBERTa, XLNet, and GPT-3, showing significant performance\nimprovements and computing efficiency advantages. Research results show that\nthe feature alignment distillation strategy is an effective model compression\nmethod that can significantly reduce computational overhead and storage\nrequirements while maintaining model capabilities.

    "abstract": "We consider a classical field theory whose equations of motion follow from\nthe least action principle, but the class of admissible trajectories is\nrestricted by differential equations. The key element of the proposed\nconstruction is the complete gauge symmetry of these additional equations. The\nunfree variation of the trajectories reduces to the infinitesimal gauge\nsymmetry transformation of the equations, restricting the trajectories. We\nexplicitly derive the equations that follow from the requirement that this\ngauge variation of the action vanishes. The system of equations for conditional\nextrema is not a Lagrangian system as such, but it admits an equivalent\nHamiltonian formulation with a non-canonical Poisson bracket. The bracket is\ndegenerate, in general. Alternatively, the equations restricting the dynamics\ncould be added to the action with Lagrange multipliers with unrestricted\nvariation of the original variables. In this case, we would arrive at the\nLagrangian equations for the original variables involving Lagrange multipliers\nand for Lagrange multipliers themselves. In general, these two methods are not\nequivalent because the multipliers can bring extra degrees of freedom compared\nto the case of equations derived by unfree variation of the action. We\nillustrate the general method with two examples. The first example is a\nparticle in a central field with varying trajectories restricted by the\nequation of conservation of angular momentum. The phase space acquires one more\ndimension, and there is an extra conserved quantity $K$ which is responsible\nfor the precession of trajectories. The second example is linearized gravity\nwith the Einstein-Hilbert action, and the class of varying fields is restricted\nby the linearized Nordstr\\\"om equation. This conditional extrema problem is\nshown to lead to the linearized Cotton gravity equations.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of colour vision is captivating, as it reveals the adaptive\nstrategies of extinct species while simultaneously inspiring innovations in\nmodern imaging technology. In this study, we present a simplified model of\nvisual transduction in the retina, introducing a novel opsin layer. We quantify\nevolutionary pressures by measuring machine vision recognition accuracy on\ncolour images shaped by specific opsins. Building on this, we develop an\nevolutionary conservation optimisation algorithm to reconstruct the spectral\nsensitivity of opsins, enabling mutation-driven adaptations to to more\neffectively spot fruits or predators. This model condenses millions of years of\nevolution within seconds on GPU, providing an experimental framework to test\nlong-standing hypotheses in evolutionary biology , such as vision of early\nmammals, primate trichromacy from gene duplication, retention of colour\nblindness, blue-shift of fish rod and multiple rod opsins with bioluminescence.\nMoreover, the model enables speculative explorations of hypothetical species,\nsuch as organisms with eyes adapted to the conditions on Mars. Our findings\nsuggest a minimalist yet effective approach to task-specific camera filter\ndesign, optimising the spectral response function to meet application-driven\ndemands. The code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has become a cornerstone\nfor aligning large language models with human preferences. However, the\nheterogeneity of human feedback, driven by diverse individual contexts and\npreferences, poses significant challenges for reward learning. To address this,\nwe propose a Low-rank Contextual RLHF (LoCo-RLHF) framework that integrates\ncontextual information to better model heterogeneous feedback while maintaining\ncomputational efficiency. Our approach builds on a contextual preference model,\nleveraging the intrinsic low-rank structure of the interaction between user\ncontexts and query-answer pairs to mitigate the high dimensionality of feature\nrepresentations. Furthermore, we address the challenge of distributional shifts\nin feedback through our Pessimism in Reduced Subspace (PRS) policy, inspired by\npessimistic offline reinforcement learning techniques. We theoretically\ndemonstrate that our policy achieves a tighter sub-optimality gap compared to\nexisting methods. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of\nLoCo-RLHF, showcasing its superior performance in personalized RLHF settings\nand its robustness to distribution shifts.",

However,\nphase segregation during metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) on\nsubstrates like r-TiO2 has posed a significant barrier to achieving\nhigh-quality films. Conventional optimization of growth parameters has been\nfound so far not very insufficient in film coverage and film quality. To\naddress this, a seed-driven stepwise crystallization (SDSC) growth approach was\nemployed in this study, featuring multiple sequential deposition steps on a\npre-templated substrate enriched with r-GeO2 seeds. The process began with an\ninitial 180-minute deposition to establish r-GeO2 nucleation seeds, followed by\na sequence of shorter deposition steps (90, 60, 60, 60, 60, and 60 minutes).\nThis stepwise growth strategy progressively increased the crystalline coverage\nto 57.4%, 77.49%, 79.73%, 93.27%, 99.17%, and ultimately 100%. Concurrently,\nthe crystalline quality improved substantially, evidenced by a ~30% reduction\nin the Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of X-ray diffraction rocking curves.\nThese findings demonstrate the potential of the SDSC approach for overcoming\nphase segregation and achieving high-quality, large-area r-GeO2 films.",

Initially, the concept of uniform measure attractors is\nrecalled, and thereafter, the existence and uniqueness of such attractors are\ndemonstrated. Uniform tail estimates are employed to establish the asymptotic\ncompactness of the processes, thereby overcoming the non-compactness issue\ninherent in the usual Sobolev embedding on unbounded thin domains.

In this work, we investigate\nthe issue of QCD axion DM within the context of the dark dimension and\ndemonstrate that the QCD axion in this scenario can account for the entire DM\nabundance through a simple two-axion mixing mechanism. Specifically, we\nconsider the resonant conversion of an axion-like particle (ALP) into the QCD\naxion. We find that, in a scenario where the ALP possesses a mass of\napproximately $m_A \\sim 10^{-5} \\, \\rm eV$ and a decay constant of $f_A \\sim\n10^{11} \\, \\rm GeV$, the QCD axion in the dark dimension can account for the\noverall DM.

Although dimensionality reduction\nhas traditionally focused on the variable space-achieving notable success in\nminimizing data redundancy and computational complexity-less attention has been\npaid to reducing the temporal dimension. In this study, we revisit Principal\nComponent Analysis (PCA), a classical dimensionality reduction technique, to\nexplore its utility in temporal dimension reduction for time series data. It is\ngenerally thought that applying PCA to the temporal dimension would disrupt\ntemporal dependencies, leading to limited exploration in this area. However,\nour theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate that applying\nPCA to sliding series windows not only maintains model performance, but also\nenhances computational efficiency. In auto-regressive forecasting, the temporal\nstructure is partially preserved through windowing, and PCA is applied within\nthese windows to denoise the time series while retaining their statistical\ninformation. By preprocessing time-series data with PCA, we reduce the temporal\ndimensionality before feeding it into TSA models such as Linear, Transformer,\nCNN, and RNN architectures. This approach accelerates training and inference\nand reduces resource consumption. Notably, PCA improves Informer training and\ninference speed by up to 40% and decreases GPU memory usage of TimesNet by 30%,\nwithout sacrificing model accuracy. Comparative analysis against other\nreduction methods further highlights the effectiveness of PCA in improving the\nefficiency of TSA models.",

The algorithm recursively mines frequent\nitemsets through matrix operations and can flexibly adapt to different data\nscales and support thresholds. In the experiment, the public Groceries dataset\nwas selected, and the running efficiency test and frequent itemset mining\neffect test were designed to evaluate the algorithm's performance indicators\nsuch as running time, memory usage, and number of frequent itemsets under\ndifferent transaction numbers and support thresholds. The experimental results\nshow that the algorithm can efficiently mine a large number of frequent\nitemsets when the support threshold is low, and focus on strong association\nrules with high support when the threshold is high. In addition, the changing\ntrends of running time and memory usage show that the Boolean matrix method can\nstill maintain good running efficiency when the number of transactions\nincreases significantly and has high scalability and robustness.

To explore and extend these advancements to\npoint-cloud-based 3D shape generation, we propose a novel Multi-scale Latent\nPoint Consistency Model (MLPCM). Our MLPCM follows a latent diffusion framework\nand introduces hierarchical levels of latent representations, ranging from\npoint-level to super-point levels, each corresponding to a different spatial\nresolution. We design a multi-scale latent integration module along with 3D\nspatial attention to effectively denoise the point-level latent representations\nconditioned on those from multiple super-point levels. Additionally, we propose\na latent consistency model, learned through consistency distillation, that\ncompresses the prior into a one-step generator. This significantly improves\nsampling efficiency while preserving the performance of the original teacher\nmodel. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks ShapeNet and ShapeNet-Vol\ndemonstrate that MLPCM achieves a 100x speedup in the generation process, while\nsurpassing state-of-the-art diffusion models in terms of both shape quality and\ndiversity.",

In practice, the modality gap caused by different\nimaging systems/styles poses great challenges to the matching task. Existing\nworks try to extract invariant features for specific modalities and train on\nlimited datasets, showing poor generalization. In this paper, we present\nMINIMA, a unified image matching framework for multiple cross-modal cases.\nWithout pursuing fancy modules, our MINIMA aims to enhance universal\nperformance from the perspective of data scaling up. For such purpose, we\npropose a simple yet effective data engine that can freely produce a large\ndataset containing multiple modalities, rich scenarios, and accurate matching\nlabels. Specifically, we scale up the modalities from cheap but rich RGB-only\nmatching data, by means of generative models. Under this setting, the matching\nlabels and rich diversity of the RGB dataset are well inherited by the\ngenerated multimodal data. Benefiting from this, we construct MD-syn, a new\ncomprehensive dataset that fills the data gap for general multimodal image\nmatching. With MD-syn, we can directly train any advanced matching pipeline on\nrandomly selected modality pairs to obtain cross-modal ability. Extensive\nexperiments on in-domain and zero-shot matching tasks, including $19$\ncross-modal cases, demonstrate that our MINIMA can significantly outperform the\nbaselines and even surpass modality-specific methods.

Of particular interest\nis that dynamic regrets, whose offline benchmarks are to find the solution at\neach time, are employed to measure the performance of the algorithm. Under mild\nassumptions on the graph and the bifunctions, we prove that if the deviation in\nthe solution sequence grows within a certain rate, then both the dynamic regret\nand the violation of coupled inequality constraints increase sublinearly.\nSecond, considering the case where each agent only has access to a noisy\nestimate on the accurate gradient, we propose an online distributed algorithm\ninvolving the stochastic gradients. The result shows that under the same\nconditions as in the first case, if the noise distribution satisfies the\nsub-Gaussian condition, then dynamic regrets, as well as constraint violations,\nincrease sublinearly with high probability. Finally, several simulation\nexamples are presented to corroborate the validity of our results.",

This system\ncould increase efficiency, reduce emissions, and improve service reliability.\nThe two-echelon electric vehicle routing problem (2E-EVRP), an extension of the\ntraditional two-echelon vehicle routing problem (2E-VRP), addresses EV-specific\nchallenges such as battery constraints and recharging stations to tackle\nenvironmental impacts, urban congestion, and e-commerce demands. While\neffectively reducing costs, energy use, and emissions, the 2E-EVRP faces\nmodeling challenges due to multi-echelon structures, EV limitations, and\nrecharging station selection.

Evolving the full-$f$ pressure with delta-$f$ magnetic\nperturbations can cause inconsistency since the latter contain background\ncomponents such as the Shafranov shift, which are actually parts of the\nequilibrium magnetic field. Such background components ($B_s$) contained in the\nmagnetic perturbations undermine the field-aligned numerics when treated as\nflutter: errors arise if $B_s/B_0\\ll l_\\perp/h_\\parallel$ is not satisfied,\nwith the perpendicular turbulence scale $l_\\perp$ and the parallel grid\ndistance $h_\\parallel$.
