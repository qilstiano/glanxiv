Linear recurrent\nmodels have proven to be a viable competitor due to their computational\nefficiency. However, such models still demonstrate a sizable gap compared to\nTransformers in terms of in-context learning among other tasks that require\nrecalling information from a context. In this work, we introduce Resona, a\nsimple and scalable framework for augmenting linear recurrent models with\nretrieval. Resona augments models with the ability to integrate retrieved\ninformation from the provided input context, enabling tailored behavior to\ndiverse task requirements. Experiments on a variety of linear recurrent models\ndemonstrate that Resona-augmented models observe significant performance gains\non a variety of synthetic as well as real-world natural language tasks,\nhighlighting its ability to act as a general purpose method to improve the\nin-context learning and language modeling abilities of linear recurrent LLMs.",

    "abstract": "Clothes-changing person re-identification (CC-ReID) aims to recognize\nindividuals under different clothing scenarios. Current CC-ReID approaches\neither concentrate on modeling body shape using additional modalities including\nsilhouette, pose, and body mesh, potentially causing the model to overlook\nother critical biometric traits such as gender, age, and style, or they\nincorporate supervision through additional labels that the model tries to\ndisregard or emphasize, such as clothing or personal attributes. However, these\nannotations are discrete in nature and do not capture comprehensive\ndescriptions.\n  In this work, we propose DIFFER: Disentangle Identity Features From Entangled\nRepresentations, a novel adversarial learning method that leverages textual\ndescriptions to disentangle identity features. Recognizing that image features\ninherently mix inseparable information, DIFFER introduces NBDetach, a mechanism\ndesigned for feature disentanglement by leveraging the separable nature of text\ndescriptions as supervision. It partitions the feature space into distinct\nsubspaces and, through gradient reversal layers, effectively separates\nidentity-related features from non-biometric features. We evaluate DIFFER on 4\ndifferent benchmark datasets (LTCC, PRCC, CelebreID-Light, and CCVID) to\ndemonstrate its effectiveness and provide state-of-the-art performance across\nall the benchmarks. DIFFER consistently outperforms the baseline method, with\nimprovements in top-1 accuracy of 3.6% on LTCC, 3.4% on PRCC, 2.5% on\nCelebReID-Light, and 1% on CCVID. Our code can be found here.",

This strategy\npermitted to reveal the importance of hyperbolic geometry in colorimetry.\nStarting from these premises, we show how Resnikoff's construction can be\nextended to a geometrically rich quantum framework, where the concepts of\nachromatic color, hue and saturation can be rigorously defined. Moreover, the\nanalysis of pure and mixed quantum chromatic states leads to a deep\nunderstanding of chromatic opposition and its role in the encoding of visual\nsignals.

However, most\nworks in the literature focus on analyzing it only from an ethical perspective,\nfocusing on moral principles and values that should be considered in the design\nand evaluation of algorithms, while disregarding the epistemic dimension\nrelated to knowledge transmission and validation. However, this aspect of\nalgorithmic fairness should also be included in the debate, as it is crucial to\nintroduce a specific type of harm: an individual may be systematically excluded\nfrom the dissemination of knowledge due to the attribution of a credibility\ndeficit/excess. In this work, we specifically focus on characterizing and\nanalyzing the impact of this credibility deficit or excess on the diffusion of\ninnovations on a societal scale, a phenomenon driven by individual attitudes\nand social interactions, and also by the strength of mutual connections.\nIndeed, discrimination might shape the latter, ultimately modifying how\ninnovations spread within the network. In this light, to incorporate, also from\na formal point of view, the epistemic dimension in innovation diffusion models\nbecomes paramount, especially if these models are intended to support fair\npolicy design. For these reasons, we formalize the epistemic properties of a\nsocial environment, by extending the well-established Linear Threshold Model\n(LTM) in an epistemic direction to show the impact of epistemic biases in\ninnovation diffusion.

However, solutions to these PDEs often do not converge\nto a unique equilibrium, but instead converge to non-stationary trajectories\nexisting in the nullspace of the spatial differential operator (e.g.\n$\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2}$). To analyse this convergence behaviour, in\nthis paper, it is shown how such trajectories can be modeled for a broad class\nof linear, 2nd order, 1D PDEs with periodic as well as more general boundary\nconditions, using the Partial Integral Equation (PIE) representation. In\nparticular, it is first shown how any PDE state satisfying these boundary\nconditions can be uniquely expressed in terms of two components, existing in\nthe image and the nullspace of the differential operator\n$\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2}$, respectively. An equivalent representation\nof linear PDEs is then derived as a PIE, explicitly defining the dynamics of\nboth state components. Finally, a notion of exponential stability is defined\nthat requires only one of the state components to converge to zero, and it is\nshown how this stability notion can be tested by solving a linear operator\ninequality. The proposed methodology is applied to examples of heat and wave\nequations, demonstrating that exponential stability can be verified with tight\nbounds on the rate of decay.",

    "abstract": "Evolutionary game theory has traditionally employed deterministic models to\ndescribe population dynamics. These models, due to their inherent\nnonlinearities, can exhibit deterministic chaos, where population fluctuations\nfollow complex, aperiodic patterns. Recently, the focus has shifted towards\nstochastic models, quantifying fixation probabilities and analysing systems\nwith constants of motion. Yet, the role of stochastic effects in systems with\nchaotic dynamics remains largely unexplored within evolutionary game theory.\nThis study addresses how demographic noise -- arising from probabilistic birth\nand death events -- impacts chaotic dynamics in finite populations. We show\nthat despite stochasticity, large populations retain a signature of chaotic\ndynamics, as evidenced by comparing a chaotic deterministic system with its\nstochastic counterpart. More concretely, the strange attractor observed in the\ndeterministic model is qualitatively recovered in the stochastic model, where\nthe term deterministic chaos loses its meaning. We employ tools from nonlinear\ndynamics to quantify how the population size influences the dynamics. We\nobserve that for small populations, stochasticity dominates, overshadowing\ndeterministic selection effects. However, as population size increases, the\ndynamics increasingly reflect the underlying chaotic structure. This resilience\nto demographic noise can be essential for maintaining diversity in populations,\neven in non-equilibrium dynamics. Overall, our results broaden our\nunderstanding of population dynamics, and revisit the boundaries between chaos\nand noise, showing how they maintain structure when considering finite\npopulations in systems that are chaotic in the deterministic limit.",

While excelling at zero-shot generation of robust\nbehaviors, BFMs often require meticulous prompt engineering for specific tasks,\npotentially yielding suboptimal results. We introduce \"Task Tokens\", a method\nto effectively tailor BFMs to specific tasks while preserving their\nflexibility. Our approach leverages the transformer architecture of BFMs to\nlearn a new task-specific encoder through reinforcement learning, keeping the\noriginal BFM frozen. This allows incorporation of user-defined priors,\nbalancing reward design and prompt engineering. By training a task encoder to\nmap observations to tokens, used as additional BFM inputs, we guide performance\nimprovement while maintaining the model's diverse control characteristics. We\ndemonstrate Task Tokens' efficacy across various tasks, including\nout-of-distribution scenarios, and show their compatibility with other\nprompting modalities. Our results suggest that Task Tokens offer a promising\napproach for adapting BFMs to specific control tasks while retaining their\ngeneralization capabilities.",

To\novercome this, quantizing SSMs with low bit-width data formats can reduce model\nsize and benefit from hardware acceleration. As SSMs are prone to\nquantization-induced errors, recent efforts have focused on optimizing a\nparticular model or bit-width for efficiency without sacrificing performance.\nHowever, distinct bit-width configurations are essential for different\nscenarios, like W4A8 for boosting large-batch decoding speed, and W4A16 for\nenhancing generation speed in short prompt applications for a single user. To\nthis end, we present Quamba2, compatible with W8A8, W4A8, and W4A16 for both\nMamba1 and Mamba2 backbones, addressing the growing demand for SSM deployment\non various platforms. Based on the channel order preserving and activation\npersistence of SSMs, we propose an offline approach to quantize inputs of a\nlinear recurrence in 8-bit by sorting and clustering for input $x$, combined\nwith a per-state-group quantization for input-dependent parameters $B$ and $C$.\nTo ensure compute-invariance in the SSM output, we rearrange weights offline\naccording to the clustering sequence. The experiments show that Quamba2-8B\noutperforms two state-of-the-art SSM quantization methods and delivers\n1.3$\\times$ and 3$\\times$ speed-ups in the pre-filling and generation stages,\nrespectively, while offering 4$\\times$ memory reduction with only a $1.6\\%$\naverage accuracy drop.

The interest in this system comes from the fact that, in the\nhomopolymer case, it has analogies with self-dual anyon field theory models and\nhas conformations that minimize the static energy and bear particular\nsymmetries and properties. In the first part of this work we provide a\nprocedure for deriving the equations of motion in the case of replica field\ntheories in the limit of zero replicas. We compute also the partition function\nof the [2]catenane at the lowest order in the frame of the so-called background\nfield method. In the second part the statistical mechanics of the system is\ninvestigated using numerical simulations based on the Wang-Landau Monte Carlo\nmethod. At equilibrium, independently of the temperature, it turns out that the\nconformations of the system are elongated in the height directions. The two\nrings composing the [2]catenanes have approximately the same heights and are\naligned. The thermodynamic properties of the system are discussed and the\nresults coming from the field theoretical approach are compared with those of\nthe numerical simulations.",

This study leverages Natural Language\nProcessing (NLP), specifically Opioid Named Entity Recognition (ONER-2025), to\nextract actionable information from these platforms. Our research makes four\nkey contributions. First, we created a unique, manually annotated dataset\nsourced from Reddit, where users share self-reported experiences of opioid use\nvia different administration routes. This dataset contains 331,285 tokens and\nincludes eight major opioid entity categories. Second, we detail our annotation\nprocess and guidelines while discussing the challenges of labeling the\nONER-2025 dataset. Third, we analyze key linguistic challenges, including\nslang, ambiguity, fragmented sentences, and emotionally charged language, in\nopioid discussions. Fourth, we propose a real-time monitoring system to process\nstreaming data from social media, healthcare records, and emergency services to\nidentify overdose events.

Estimating model\nparameters from one bit quantized data can be challenging, particularly when\nthe quantization process is explicitly accounted for in the estimator. In many\ncases, the estimator disregards quantization effects, leading to model\nmisspecification. Consequently, estimation errors arise from both quantization\nand misspecification. Traditional performance bounds, such as the Cramer-Rao\nbound (CRB), fail to capture the impact of misspecification on estimation\nperformance. To address this limitation, we derive the misspecified CRB (MCRB)\nfor parameter estimation in a quantized data model consisting of a signal\ncomponent in additive Gaussian noise. We apply this bound to\ndirection-of-arrival estimation using quantized measurements from a sensor\narray and to frequency estimation with oversampled quantized data. The\nsimulations show that the MCRB is asymptotically achieved by the\nmean-squared-error of the misspecified maximum-likelihood estimator.

The refractive index of KTA being higher than that of\nKTP, this couple of materials could allow light to be guided in the deposited\nlayer. To grow the KTA film, the chosen technique is pulsed laser deposition\n(PLD) that allows nonlinear complex oxides layer of optical quality to be\ngrown. In this study, we show that the growth is well oriented for layers with\na thickness up to 200 nm after deposition. Then, after annealing, the crystal\nstate is improved as well as the surface. In this study we demonstrate the\nfeasibility of KTA epitaxy over KTP by PLD with good epitaxial quality, good\norientation and theoretical phase-matching conditions for a planar KTA\nwaveguide.",

We report the first detection of multi-frequency and multi-epoch\nESEs revealed with the RATAN-600 daily light curves of the quasar 2005$+$403.\nThe most prominent ESE flux density modulations are found in 2011, 2015, and\n2020 and each lasted about $4-5$ months. We fitted the detected ESEs jointly at\n4.7/4.8, 7.7/8.2, and 11.2~GHz using the models, which allowed us to constrain\nthe angular and linear size of the scattering lens averaged over the three ESEs\n$0.3\\pm0.1$ mas and $0.6\\pm0.1$ au, proper motion $8.3\\pm0.7$ mas yr$^{-1}$ and\ntransverse velocity $70.1\\pm5.7$ km s$^{-1}$ assuming that the lens distance is\n1.8 kpc, maximum free-electron density on the line of sight $1183\\pm124$\ncm$^{-3}$ and lens mass $(0.8\\pm0.4)\\times10^{-15}\\,\\rm M_\\odot$.

Synthesis of TM ternary nitride films by physical vapor\ndeposition often favors disordered 3D structures rather than the predicted\n2D-like layered structure. In this study, we investigate the structural\ninterplay in the Sc-Ta-N material system, focusing on ScTaN2. We use a two-step\ncombinatorial approach to deposit Sc-Ta-N films by RF co-sputtering and then\nprocess the resulting 3D-structured precursor with RTA.

Interestingly, we find\nthat the structure can accommodate large off-stoichiometry in the Ta-rich\nregion (x < 0.5), facilitated by making an alloy with the nearly isostructural\nTa5N6 compound that exists on a composition tie-line. Transport measurements on\nScTaN2 reveal a nearly temperature-independent high carrier density (1021\ncm-3), suggesting a heavily doped semiconductor or semimetallic character. The\ncarrier mobility is relatively small (9.5 cm2V-1s-1 at 2 K) and the\nresidual-resistivity ratio is small, suggesting that electrical conduction is\ndominated by defects or disorder. Measured magnetoresistance is indicative of\nweak antilocalization at low temperatures. We highlight the interplay between\nScTaN2 and Ta5N6 in stabilizing layered structures, emphasizes the importance\nof cation order/disorder for potential tunable alloys, and suggests that ScTaN2\nis promising platform for exploring electronic properties in a tie line of\nstoichiometry.",

    "abstract": "Tweets provides valuable semantic context for earth observation tasks and\nserves as a complementary modality to remote sensing imagery. In building\nfunction classification (BFC), tweets are often collected using geographic\nheuristics and labeled via external databases, an inherently weakly supervised\nprocess that introduces both label noise and sentence level feature noise\n(e.g., irrelevant or uninformative tweets). While label noise has been widely\nstudied, the impact of sentence level feature noise remains underexplored,\nlargely due to the lack of clean benchmark datasets for controlled analysis. In\nthis work, we propose a method for generating a synthetic oracle dataset using\nLLM, designed to contain only tweets that are both correctly labeled and\nsemantically relevant to their associated buildings. This oracle dataset\nenables systematic investigation of noise impacts that are otherwise difficult\nto isolate in real-world data. To assess its utility, we compare model\nperformance using Naive Bayes and mBERT classifiers under three configurations:\nreal vs. synthetic training data, and cross-domain generalization. Results show\nthat noise in real tweets significantly degrades the contextual learning\ncapacity of mBERT, reducing its performance to that of a simple keyword-based\nmodel. In contrast, the clean synthetic dataset allows mBERT to learn\neffectively, outperforming Naive Bayes Bayes by a large margin. These findings\nhighlight that addressing feature noise is more critical than model complexity\nin this task. Our synthetic dataset offers a novel experimental environment for\nfuture noise injection studies and is publicly available on GitHub.",

We propose RobuNFR for evaluating the robustness\nof LLMs in NFR-aware code generation across four NFR dimensions: design,\nreadability, reliability, and performance, using three methodologies: prompt\nvariation, regression testing, and diverse workflows. Our experiments show that\nRobuNFR reveals robustness issues in the tested LLMs when considering NFRs in\ncode generation. Specifically, under prompt variation, including NFRs leads to\na decrease in Pass@1 by up to 39 percent and an increase in the standard\ndeviation from 0.48 to 2.48 compared to the baseline without NFRs (i.e.,\nFunction-Only). While incorporating NFRs generally improves overall NFR\nmetrics, it also results in higher prompt sensitivity. In regression settings,\nsome LLMs exhibit differences across versions, with improvements in one aspect\n(e.g., reduced code smells) often accompanied by regressions in another (e.g.,\ndecreased correctness), revealing inconsistencies that challenge their\nrobustness.

The\nsecond class arises from thinking of complex weighted glued trees as rhombi\nthat can then be used to tile two dimensional space, giving rise to the\nfamiliar dice lattice and infinitely many generalizations thereof, of which\nsome are Euclidian while others are hyperbolic.",

VP is at the basis of the study of the gravitational instability of\ncosmological density perturbations in Dark-Matter (DM), but its range of\napplication extends to other fields, such as plasma physics.\n  In the case of Cold Dark Matter, a single velocity is associated with each\nfluid-element (or particle) , the initial condition presents a stiff\ndiscontinuity. This creates problems such as diffusion or negative distribution\nfunction when a grid based method is used to solve VP. In this work we want to\nhighlight this problem, focusing on the technical aspects of this phenomenon.\nBy comparing different finite volume methods and a spectral method we observe\nthat, while all integration schemes preserve the invariants of the system (e.g,\nenergy), the physical observable of interest, i.e., the density, is not\ncorrectly reproduced. We thus compare the density obtained with the different\nEulerian integration schemes with the result obtained from a reference N-body\nmethod.

This\nquantity has a well-known dilution feature, where it is small when uncertainty\nis large, giving rise to false confidence that a conjunction is safe when it is\nnot. An alternative approach to conjunction assessment is to assess the missed\ndetection probability that the best available information indicates the\nconjunction to be safe, when it is actually unsafe. In other words, the\nalternative seeks to answer the question of whether unknowable errors in the\nbest available data might be especially unlucky. A proper implementation of\nthis alternative avoids dilution and false confidence. Implementations of the\nalternative use either significance probabilities (p-values) associated with a\nnull hypothesis that the miss distance is small, or confidence intervals on the\nmiss distance. Both approaches rely on maximum likelihood principles to deal\nwith nuisance variables, rather than marginalization. This paper discusses the\nproblems with the traditional approach, and summarizes other work that\ndeveloped the alternative approach. The paper presents examples of application\nof the alternatives using data from actual conjunctions experienced in\noperations, including synthetic scaling to highlight contrasts between the\nalternative and the traditional approach.",

Close to the planet the surface coincides with the equator of the\nplanet, while far from the planet it coincides with the orbital plane of the\nplanet. We determine the shape of the Laplace surface of a circumplanetary disc\nthat results from accretion of circumstellar gas and experiences the effects of\ngas pressure, self-gravity, and viscosity, as well as the gravitational effects\ndue to the planetary spin and the star. We apply the linear theory of warped\ndiscs in the wavelike regime for a small-obliquity planet such as Jupiter. As a\nresult of dissipation, a disc that begins slightly away from its Laplace\nsurface will evolve to it. Because of pressure effects in typically warm\ncircumplanetary discs, the disc is highly flattened compared with the classical\nLaplace surface, meaning that it is much less warped but still significantly\ntilted. For the case of Jupiter, the disc does not align anywhere with the\nequator of the planet. For such discs, the effects of self-gravity and\nviscosity on warping are typically small. The disc tilt is intermediate between\nthe planet's equatorial and orbital planes. Circumplanetary discs that are much\ncooler than expected can undergo warping and alignment with the planet's\nequator at small radii. The results have implications for the orbital evolution\nof satellites in the solar system that are observed to be somewhat aligned with\ntheir classical Laplace surface.",

To address these challenges, we propose a novel\napproach utilizing STU-Net with transfer learning to leverage knowledge\ntransferred from human brain MRI data to enhance segmentation accuracy in the\nNHP brain MRI, particularly when training data is limited. The combination of\nSTU-Net and transfer learning effectively delineates complex tissue boundaries\nand captures fine anatomical details specific to NHP brains. Notably, our\nmethod demonstrated improvement in segmenting small subcortical structures such\nas putamen and thalamus that are challenging to resolve with limited spatial\nresolution and tissue contrast, and achieved DSC of over 0.88, IoU over 0.8 and\nHD95 under 7. This study introduces a robust method for multi-class brain\ntissue segmentation in NHPs, potentially accelerating research in evolutionary\nneuroscience and preclinical studies of neurological disorders relevant to\nhuman health.",

Particle shape changes are\ncontrolled by these interactions, in conjunction with a uniform particle core\nstiffness. We calibrate and verify this model by comparing the deformation of\nconstrained beams under load with theoretical predictions.

To further illustrate the model's capabilities, we apply it to the\nuniaxial compaction of a granular material composed of core-shell particles. We\nshow that, depending on the core stiffness and shell plasticity, the compaction\nleads to either a significant reduction of particle volumes or an improved pore\nfilling due to particle shape changes. At high compaction, particle shapes\nvary: elastic particles without core stiffness become mostly elongated, elastic\nparticles with core stiffness form polygonal shapes, while plastic particles\ndevelop elliptical or highly irregular forms.

In particular, we define various\nnew quantum Doeblin coefficients, one of which has several desirable\nproperties, including concatenation and multiplicativity, in addition to being\nefficiently computable.

Our interpretations of quantum Doeblin coefficients as either\nentanglement-assisted or unassisted exclusion values are particularly\nappealing, indicating that they are proportional to the best possible error\nprobabilities one could achieve in state-exclusion tasks by making use of the\nchannel. We also outline various applications of quantum Doeblin coefficients,\nranging from limitations on quantum machine learning algorithms that use\nparameterized quantum circuits (noise-induced barren plateaus), on error\nmitigation protocols, on the sample complexity of noisy quantum hypothesis\ntesting, and on mixing, distinguishability, and decoupling times of\ntime-varying channels. All of these applications make use of the fact that\nquantum Doeblin coefficients appear in upper bounds on various trace-distance\ncontraction coefficients of a channel.

This paper presents the first\ncomprehensive study of API misuse patterns in LLM-generated code, analyzing\nboth method selection and parameter usage across Python and Java. Through\nextensive manual annotation of 3,892 method-level and 2,560 parameter-level\nmisuses, we develop a novel taxonomy of four distinct API misuse types specific\nto LLMs, which significantly differ from traditional human-centric misuse\npatterns.

Purpose: This study evaluates the accuracy of standard radiotherapy\nbeam symmetry metrics and compares them to a proposed cross-correlation-based\nmetric called the Correlative Symmetric Index (CSI), as well as the Structural\nSimilarity Index (SSIM). We aim to demonstrate that CSI is less susceptible to\nnoise than traditional methods. Methods: Simulated non-symmetric beam profiles\nwith similar left and right areas were analyzed using both standard and\nproposed symmetry metrics. To test the robustness of each method to noise, a\nnoisy non-symmetric beam profile was also generated. Measured beam profiles at\nvarious depths in a water tank were used to compare the performance of each\nsymmetry metric under realistic clinical conditions. Results: In the noisy,\nnon-symmetric case, CSI and SSIM values were 0.387 and 0.5401, respectively.\nTraditional metrics such as the Point Difference Quotient (PDQ) and area-based\nsymmetry yielded values of 0.312 and 0.400. The percentage change between the\nnon-symmetric (no noise) and non-symmetric (with noise) cases for PDQ,\narea-based symmetry, SSIM, and CSI were 11.1%, 5.6%, 16.25%, and 1.43%,\nrespectively. For clinically measured symmetric profiles, all metrics produced\nvalues above 0.9. Conclusion: The Correlative Symmetric Index (CSI)\ndemonstrates greater robustness to noise than both pointwise and area-based\nsymmetry methods. CSI provides a reliable measure for quantifying beam\nsymmetry, particularly under noisy conditions.",

    "abstract": "The experimental identification of optically addressable spin defects in\nhexagonal boron nitride has opened new possibilities for quantum sensor\ntechnologies in two-dimensional materials and structures. Despite numerous\nfundamental and theoretical studies on the electronic structure of defects, the\ndynamics of the excited states are yet to be comprehensively investigated. The\nnon-radiative relaxation pathways from the triplet excited states to the\ntriplet ground states, particularly the one via a metastable intermediate\nstate, remain largely presumed. A detailed identification, let alone a direct\nmeasurement of the rate constants, is still lacking. In this work, we\ninvestigate the relaxation dynamics of the excited and intermediate states in\nthe optical cycle under pulsed laser excitation in a broad temperature range.\nThe focus is on the shelving intermediate state and resulting ground state spin\npolarization of an ensemble of optically pumped negatively charged boron\nvacancies. Our experiments show a relaxation time of 24 ns from the metastable\nstate back to the ground state at room temperature. For low temperatures we\nfind this time to approximately double - in accordance with a doubling of\nphotoluminescence lifetime and intensity. Simulations show the evolution of the\nspin-populations in the five-level system and the polarization of the ground\nstate depending on excitation rates. We thus optimize pulsed optically detected\nmagnetic resonance sequences to account for the relaxation of the intermediate\nstate. This yields significantly increased efficiency of the spin manipulation\nand hence, the sensitivity of the quantum sensor based on boron vacancies can\nbe optimized considerably.",

    "abstract": "Divide-and-conquer methods use large-sample approximations to provide\nfrequentist guarantees when each block of data is both small enough to\nfacilitate efficient computation and large enough to support approximately\nvalid inferences. When the overall sample size is small or moderate, likely no\nsuitable division of the data meets both requirements, hence the resulting\ninference lacks validity guarantees. We propose a new approach, couched in the\ninferential model framework, that is fully conditional in a Bayesian sense and\nprovably valid in a frequentist sense. The main insight is that existing\ndivide-and-conquer approaches make use of a Gaussianity assumption twice: first\nin the construction of an estimator, and second in the approximation to its\nsampling distribution. Our proposal is to retain the first Gaussianity\nassumption, using a Gaussian working likelihood, but to replace the second with\na validification step that uses the sampling distributions of the block\nsummaries determined by the posited model. This latter step, a type of\nprobability-to-possibility transform, is key to the reliability guarantees\nenjoyed by our approach, which are uniquely general in the divide-and-conquer\nliterature. In addition to finite-sample validity guarantees, our proposed\napproach is also asymptotically efficient like the other divide-and-conquer\nsolutions available in the literature. Our computational strategy leverages\nstate-of-the-art black-box likelihood emulators. We demonstrate our method's\nperformance via simulations and highlight its flexibility with an analysis of\nmedian PM2.5 in Maryborough, Queensland, during the 2023 Australian bushfire\nseason.",

In this work, we assess the ability of EP to learn on\nhardware that contain physical uncertainties. This is particularly important\nfor researchers concerned with hardware implementations of self-learning\nsystems that utilize EP. Our results demonstrate that deep, multi-layer neural\nnetwork architectures can be trained successfully using EP in the presence of\nfinite uncertainties, up to a critical limit. This limit is independent of the\ntraining dataset, and can be scaled through sampling the network according to\nthe central limit theorem. Additionally, we demonstrate improved model\nconvergence and performance for finite levels of uncertainty on the MNIST,\nKMNIST and FashionMNIST datasets. Optimal performance is found for networks\ntrained with uncertainties close to the critical limit. Our research supports\nfuture work to build self-learning hardware in situ with EP.",

In this study, a practical system was developed to calculate the\nefficiency of pickers in commercial strawberry harvesting. Instrumented picking\ncarts were developed to record the harvested fruit weight, geolocation, and\ncart movement in real time. These carts were deployed during the commercial\nstrawberry harvest season in Santa Maria, CA. The collected data was then used\nto train a CNN-LSTM-based deep neural network to classify a picker's activity\ninto \"Pick\" and \"NoPick\" classes. Experimental evaluations showed that the\nCNN-LSTM model showed promising activity recognition performance with an F1\nscore accuracy of over 0.97. The recognition results were then used to compute\npicker efficiency and the time required to fill a tray. Analysis of the\nseason-long harvest data showed that the average picker efficiency was 75.07%\nwith an estimation accuracy of 95.22%. Furthermore, the average tray fill time\nwas 6.79 minutes with an estimation accuracy of 96.43%.

    "abstract": "We provide an effective solution of the 1D crossing equation. We begin by\narguing that crossing constraints can be recast in terms of bases of sum rules\nassociated to special sets of CFT data -- extremal solutions -- which solve\nthese constraints in a minimal way and naturally saturate positivity bounds on\nthe space of CFTs. We conjecture, argue and check extensively that any extremal\nsolution behaves as a generalized free field in the UV. This allows us to\nreconstruct the entirety of their CFT data using a rapidly convergent ``hybrid\nbootstrap'' method, which combines numerics and analytics. Strikingly, as we\napproach special corners in the space of extremal solutions we find that their\nCFT data can present non-trivial structure up to arbitrarily large energies. We\ninterpret these corners as flat space limits of QFTs in AdS$_2$, which extremal\nsolutions naturally describe. This picture allows us to bootstrap their CFT\ndata in these limits in terms of 2d S-matrices, and conversely provide a\nmicroscopic CFT construction of the latter. Further evidence for this QFT in\nAdS description of extremal solutions comes from an explicit construction of\nbulk QFT operators solving an AdS locality problem. Concretly we show that it\nis possible to canonically associate one or more such operators to any extremal\nsolution by explicitly solving for their BOE data. In the special case where\nthis operator is the bulk stress-tensor we combine crossing and bulk locality\nconstraints to derive stronger bounds on the OPE and BOE data, including an\nexact bootstrap lower bound on the central charge $C_T\\geq 1/2$.",

One such constraint\nis that a 3D object should be self-supporting, i.e., remain balanced under\ngravity. Previous approaches to generating stable 3D objects relied on\ndifferentiable physics simulators to optimize geometry at test time, which is\nslow, unstable, and prone to local optima. Inspired by the literature on\naligning generative models with external feedback, we propose Direct Simulation\nOptimization (DSO). This framework leverages feedback from a\n(non-differentiable) simulator to increase the likelihood that the 3D generator\ndirectly outputs stable 3D objects. We construct a dataset of 3D objects\nlabeled with stability scores obtained from the physics simulator. This dataset\nenables fine-tuning of the 3D generator using the stability score as an\nalignment metric, via direct preference optimization (DPO) or direct reward\noptimization (DRO) - a novel objective we introduce to align diffusion models\nwithout requiring pairwise preferences. Our experiments demonstrate that the\nfine-tuned feed-forward generator, using either the DPO or DRO objective, is\nsignificantly faster and more likely to produce stable objects than test-time\noptimization.

Unlike prior\napproaches, our framework requires doctor agents to actively engage with\npatients through multi-turn conversations, requesting relevant medical\nexaminations (e.g., temperature, blood pressure, ECG) and imaging results\n(e.g., MRI, X-ray) from a measurement agent to mimic the real-world diagnostic\nprocess. Additionally, we incorporate self improvement mechanisms that allow\nmodels to iteratively refine their diagnostic strategies. We enhance LLM\nperformance in our simulated setting by integrating multi-agent discussions,\nchain-of-thought reasoning, and experience-based knowledge retrieval,\nfacilitating progressive learning as doctor agents interact with more patients.\nWe also introduce an evaluation benchmark for assessing the LLM's ability to\nengage in dynamic, context-aware diagnostic interactions. While MedAgentSim is\nfully automated, it also supports a user-controlled mode, enabling human\ninteraction with either the doctor or patient agent.

    "abstract": "We present TranSplat, a 3D scene rendering algorithm that enables realistic\ncross-scene object transfer (from a source to a target scene) based on the\nGaussian Splatting framework. Our approach addresses two critical challenges:\n(1) precise 3D object extraction from the source scene, and (2) faithful\nrelighting of the transferred object in the target scene without explicit\nmaterial property estimation. TranSplat fits a splatting model to the source\nscene, using 2D object masks to drive fine-grained 3D segmentation. Following\nuser-guided insertion of the object into the target scene, along with automatic\nrefinement of position and orientation, TranSplat derives per-Gaussian radiance\ntransfer functions via spherical harmonic analysis to adapt the object's\nappearance to match the target scene's lighting environment. This relighting\nstrategy does not require explicitly estimating physical scene properties such\nas BRDFs. Evaluated on several synthetic and real-world scenes and objects,\nTranSplat yields excellent 3D object extractions and relighting performance\ncompared to recent baseline methods and visually convincing cross-scene object\ntransfers. We conclude by discussing the limitations of the approach.",

    "abstract": "Sequential Recommendation (SeqRec) aims to predict the next item by capturing\nsequential patterns from users' historical interactions, playing a crucial role\nin many real-world recommender systems. However, existing approaches\npredominantly adopt a direct forward computation paradigm, where the final\nhidden state of the sequence encoder serves as the user representation. We\nargue that this inference paradigm, due to its limited computational depth,\nstruggles to model the complex evolving nature of user preferences and lacks a\nnuanced understanding of long-tail items, leading to suboptimal performance. To\naddress this issue, we propose \\textbf{ReaRec}, the first inference-time\ncomputing framework for recommender systems, which enhances user\nrepresentations through implicit multi-step reasoning. Specifically, ReaRec\nautoregressively feeds the sequence's last hidden state into the sequential\nrecommender while incorporating special reasoning position embeddings to\ndecouple the original item encoding space from the multi-step reasoning space.\nMoreover, we introduce two lightweight reasoning-based learning methods,\nEnsemble Reasoning Learning (ERL) and Progressive Reasoning Learning (PRL), to\nfurther effectively exploit ReaRec's reasoning potential. Extensive experiments\non five public real-world datasets and different SeqRec architectures\ndemonstrate the generality and effectiveness of our proposed ReaRec.\nRemarkably, post-hoc analyses reveal that ReaRec significantly elevates the\nperformance ceiling of multiple sequential recommendation backbones by\napproximately 30\\%-50\\%.

    "abstract": "Recently, a large amount of work has focused on improving large language\nmodels' (LLMs') performance on reasoning benchmarks such as math and logic.\nHowever, past work has largely assumed that tasks are well-defined. In the real\nworld, queries to LLMs are often underspecified, only solvable through\nacquiring missing information. We formalize this as a constraint satisfaction\nproblem (CSP) with missing variable assignments. Using a special case of this\nformalism where only one necessary variable assignment is missing, we can\nrigorously evaluate an LLM's ability to identify the minimal necessary question\nto ask and quantify axes of difficulty levels for each problem. We present\nQuestBench, a set of underspecified reasoning tasks solvable by asking at most\none question, which includes: (1) Logic-Q: Logical reasoning tasks with one\nmissing proposition, (2) Planning-Q: PDDL planning problems with initial states\nthat are partially-observed, (3) GSM-Q: Human-annotated grade school math\nproblems with one missing variable assignment, and (4) GSME-Q: a version of\nGSM-Q where word problems are translated into equations by human annotators.\nThe LLM is tasked with selecting the correct clarification question(s) from a\nlist of options. While state-of-the-art models excel at GSM-Q and GSME-Q, their\naccuracy is only 40-50% on Logic-Q and Planning-Q. Analysis demonstrates that\nthe ability to solve well-specified reasoning problems may not be sufficient\nfor success on our benchmark: models have difficulty identifying the right\nquestion to ask, even when they can solve the fully specified version of the\nproblem. Furthermore, in the Planning-Q domain, LLMs tend not to hedge, even\nwhen explicitly presented with the option to predict ``not sure.'' This\nhighlights the need for deeper investigation into models' information\nacquisition capabilities.",

The polarisation was measured in the 2--8 keV\nband with 5.2$\\sigma$ statistical confidence. We report a polarisation degree\n(PD) of $9.1\\pm1.6$ per cent and a polarisation angle of $83^{\\circ} \\pm\n5^{\\circ}$ (errors are $1\\sigma$ confidence). There is a hint of a positive\ncorrelation of PD with energy that is not statistically significant. We report\nthat the source is in the corona-dominated hard state, which is confirmed by a\nhard power-law dominated spectrum with weak reflection features and the\npresence of a Type-C quasi-periodic oscillation at $\\sim0.2$~Hz. The\norientation of the emitted radio jet is not known, and so we are unable to\ncompare it with the direction of X-ray polarization, but we predict the two to\nbe parallel if the geometry is similar to that in Cygnus X-1 and Swift\nJ1727.8-1613, the two hard state black hole binaries previously observed by\nIXPE. In the Comptonisation scenario, the high observed PD requires a very\nfavourable geometry of the corona, a high inclination angle (supported by the\npresence of a dip in the light curve) and possibly a mildly relativistic\noutflow and/or scattering in an optically thick wind.",

NetSSM\naccomplishes this by learning from and producing traces 8x and 78x longer than\nexisting transformer-based approaches. Evaluation results show that our method\ngenerates high-fidelity traces that outperform prior efforts in existing\nbenchmarks.

We focus here on promising variational\nmethods derived from scientific machine learning: differentiable quantum\ncircuits (DQC), addressing specifically their cost in number of circuit\nevaluations. Reducing the number of quantum circuit evaluations is particularly\nvaluable in hybrid quantum/classical protocols, where the time required to\ninterface and run quantum hardware at each cycle can impact the total wall-time\nmuch more than relatively inexpensive classical post-processing overhead. Here,\nwe propose and test two sample-efficient protocols for solving non-linear DEs,\nachieving exponential savings in quantum circuit evaluations. These protocols\nare based on redesigning the extraction of information from DQC in a\n``measure-first\" approach, by introducing engineered cost operators similar to\nthe randomized-measurement toolbox (i.e. classical shadows). In benchmark\nsimulations on one and two-dimensional DEs, we report up to $\\sim$ 100 fold\nreductions in circuit evaluations.

    "abstract": "Chebyshev Filtered Subspace Iteration (ChFSI) has been widely adopted for\ncomputing a small subset of extreme eigenvalues in large sparse matrices. This\nwork introduces a residual-based reformulation of ChFSI, referred to as\nR-ChFSI, designed to accommodate inexact matrix-vector products while\nmaintaining robust convergence properties. By reformulating the traditional\nChebyshev recurrence to operate on residuals rather than eigenvector estimates,\nthe R-ChFSI approach effectively suppresses the errors made in matrix-vector\nproducts, improving the convergence behaviour for both standard and generalized\neigenproblems. This ability of R-ChFSI to be tolerant to inexact matrix-vector\nproducts allows one to incorporate approximate inverses for large-scale\ngeneralized eigenproblems, making the method particularly attractive where\nexact matrix factorizations or iterative methods become computationally\nexpensive for evaluating inverses. It also allows us to compute the\nmatrix-vector products in lower-precision arithmetic allowing us to leverage\nmodern hardware accelerators. Through extensive benchmarking, we demonstrate\nthat R-ChFSI achieves desired residual tolerances while leveraging\nlow-precision arithmetic. For problems with millions of degrees of freedom and\nthousands of eigenvalues, R-ChFSI attains final residual norms in the range of\n10$^{-12}$ to 10$^{-14}$, even with FP32 and TF32 arithmetic, significantly\noutperforming standard ChFSI in similar settings. In generalized eigenproblems,\nwhere approximate inverses are used, R-ChFSI achieves residual tolerances up to\nten orders of magnitude lower, demonstrating its robustness to approximation\nerrors. Finally, R-ChFSI provides a scalable and computationally efficient\nalternative for solving large-scale eigenproblems in high-performance computing\nenvironments.",

Within the context\nof quantum information theory, where tensors are interpreted as multiparticle\nquantum states, freeness corresponds to a type of multiparticle Schmidt\ndecomposition. In particular, if a state is free in a given basis, the reduced\ndensity matrices are diagonal. Although generic tensors in $\\mathbb{C}^n\n\\otimes \\mathbb{C}^n \\otimes \\mathbb{C}^n$ are non-free for $n \\geq 4$ by\nparameter counting, no explicit non-free tensors were known until now. We solve\nthis hay in a haystack problem by constructing explicit tensors that are\nnon-free for every $n \\geq 3$. In particular, this establishes that non-free\ntensors exist in $\\mathbb{C}^n \\otimes \\mathbb{C}^n \\otimes \\mathbb{C}^n$,\nwhere they are not generic.\n  To establish non-freeness, we use results from geometric invariant theory and\nthe theory of moment polytopes. In particular, we show that if a tensor $T$ is\nfree, then there is a tensor $S$ in the GL-orbit closure of $T$, whose support\nis free and whose moment map image is the minimum-norm point of the moment\npolytope of $T$. This implies a reduction for checking non-freeness from\narbitrary basis changes of $T$ to unitary basis changes of $S$. The unitary\nequivariance of the moment map can then be combined with the fact that tensors\nwith free support have diagonal moment map image, in order to further restrict\nthe set of relevant basis changes.",

Combining ideas from\nKoopman theory and spectral model order reduction, the stochastic\nlow-dimensional inflated convolutional Koopman model (SLICK) accurately\nforecasts short-time transient dynamics while preserving long-term statistical\nproperties. A discrete Koopman operator is used to evolve convolutional\ncoordinates that govern the temporal dynamics of spectral orthogonal modes,\nwhich in turn represent the energetically most salient large-scale coherent\nflow structures. Turbulence closure is achieved in two steps: first, by\ninflating the convolutional coordinates to incorporate nonlinear interactions\nbetween different scales, and second, by modeling the residual error as a\nstochastic source. An empirical dewhitening filter informed by the data is used\nto maintain the second-order flow statistics within the long-time limit. The\nmodel uncertainty is quantified through either Monte Carlo simulation or by\ndirectly propagating the model covariance matrix. The model is demonstrated on\nthe Ginzburg-Landau equations, large-eddy simulation (LES) data of a turbulent\njet, and particle image velocimetry (PIV) data of the flow over an open cavity.\nIn all cases, the model is predictive over time horizons indicated by a\ndetailed error analysis and integrates stably over arbitrary time horizons,\ngenerating realistic surrogate data.",

However, the rarity of\nsurgical errors makes their detection and analysis challenging using artificial\nintelligence. To tackle this issue, we leveraged videos from the EyeSi Surgical\ncataract surgery simulator to learn to predict errors and transfer the acquired\nknowledge to real-world surgical contexts. By employing deep learning models,\nwe demonstrated the feasibility of making real-time predictions using simulator\ndata with a very short temporal history, enabling on-the-fly computations. We\nthen transferred these insights to real-world settings through unsupervised\ndomain adaptation, without relying on labeled videos from real surgeries for\ntraining, which are limited. This was achieved by aligning video clips from the\nsimulator with real-world footage and pre-training the models using pretext\ntasks on both simulated and real surgical data. For a 1-second prediction\nwindow on the simulator, we achieved an overall AUC of 0.820 for error\nprediction using 600$\\times$600 pixel images, and 0.784 using smaller\n299$\\times$299 pixel images. In real-world settings, we obtained an AUC of up\nto 0.663 with domain adaptation, marking an improvement over direct model\napplication without adaptation, which yielded an AUC of 0.578.

In particular, deploying\nthis framework on HPC systems does not require system-level changes. We\nbenchmark our proposed framework against a standalone SLURM approach using GS2\nand a Gaussian Process surrogate thereof.

    "abstract": "Property-based testing has been previously proposed for quantum programs in\nQ# with QSharpCheck; however, this implementation was limited in functionality,\nlacked extensibility, and was evaluated on a narrow range of programs using a\nsingle property. To address these limitations, we propose QuCheck, an enhanced\nproperty-based testing framework in Qiskit. By leveraging Qiskit and the\nbroader Python ecosystem, QuCheck facilitates property construction, introduces\nflexible input generators and assertions, and supports expressive\npreconditions. We assessed its effectiveness through mutation analysis on five\nquantum programs (2-10 qubits), varying the number of properties, inputs, and\nmeasurement shots to assess their impact on fault detection and demonstrate the\neffectiveness of property-based testing across a range of conditions. Results\nshow a strong positive correlation between the mutation score (a measure of\nfault detection) and number of properties evaluated, with a moderate negative\ncorrelation between the false positive rate and number of measurement shots.\nAmong the most thorough test configurations, those evaluating three properties\nachieved a mean mutation score ranging from 0.90 to 0.92 across all five\nalgorithms, with the false positive rate between 0 and 0.04. QuCheck identified\n36.0% more faults than QSharpCheck, with execution time reduced by 81.1%,\ndespite one false positive. These findings underscore the viability of\nproperty-based testing for verifying quantum systems.",

Here, a planner\nmanages multiple inventories to meet stochastic demand while minimizing costs\nthat are coupled through nonlinear ordering functions reflecting economies of\nscale. Our main contributions are: (i) a surprising equivalence result showing\nthat optimal stationary base-stock levels for individual locations remain\nunchanged despite the coupling when restricting attention to decoupled\nstrategies; (ii) tight performance bounds for simple decoupled policies\nrelative to optimal coupled policies, revealing that the worst-case ratio\ndepends primarily on the degree of nonlinearity in the cost function and scales\nwith the number of locations for systems with fixed costs; and (iii) analysis\nof practical online algorithms that achieve competitive performance without\nsolving complex dynamic programs.

Thus,\nthe BRST transformations simply accommodate the gauge consistency of the gauge\nfixing sector, while the quantum part of the effective action is gauge and BRST\ninvariant. We apply this physics-informed approach to Yang-Mills theory and\ngravity and show how the flowing gauge fields arrange for full gauge\ninvariance. We also embed the background field approximation to the functional\nrenormalisation group (fRG) in an exact gauge invariant PIRG flow. This allows\nus to discuss the dynamics of the correction terms, and the non-trivial\nultraviolet or infrared relevant terms are elucidated within a one-loop\napproximation. The background field approximation of the latter is known for\nviolating one-loop universality for specific regulators and we show how the\npresent setup reinstates universality in a constructive way.

We\nfound that at temperatures not much lower than the transition temperature\n$T_c$, losses are dominated by quasiparticle excitations and are well described\nby the BCS theory. The exponential decrease of the quasiparticle density below\n$T_c$ results in a 1000-fold increase of the quality factor, as well as a shift\nof the resonance frequency due to the change of the kinetic inductance of the\nsuperconductor. At very low temperatures, losses due to two-level systems begin\nto dominate giving a peak in the quality factor of about 27.6 million at 130\nmK.

These generalized nudging\nstrategies are notably useful for problems which possess limited or even no\nadditional regularity beyond the minimal framework. We demonstrate that a\nspatially discretized nudged solution converges exponentially fast in time to\nthe true solution with the rate guaranteed by the choice of the nudging\nstrategy independent of the discretization. Furthermore, the long-term discrete\nerror is optimal as it matches the estimates available for problems of limited\nregularity with known initial conditions. Three particular strategies --\nnudging by a conforming finite element subspace, nudging by piecewise constants\non the boundary mesh, and nudging by the mean value -- are explored numerically\nfor three test cases, including a problem with Dirac delta forcing and the\nKellogg problem with discontinuous conductivity.",

Here, we present a numerical model for the\ninteraction of weak, low-density cometary impactors with planetary atmospheres,\nwhich includes semi-analytical parameterisations for the ablation, deformation,\nand fragmentation of comets. Deformation is described by a pancake model, as is\nappropriate for weakly cohesive, low-density bodies, while fragmentation is\ndriven by the growth of Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities. The model retains\nsufficient computational simplicity to investigate cometary impacts across a\nlarge parameter space, and permits simple description of the key physical\nprocesses controlling the interaction of comets with the atmosphere. We apply\nour model to two case studies. First, we consider the cometary delivery of\nprebiotic feedstock molecules. This requires the survival of comets during\natmospheric entry, which is determined by three parameters: the comet's initial\nradius, bulk density, and atmospheric surface density. There is a sharp\ntransition between the survival and catastrophic fragmentation of comets at a\nradius of about 150m, which increases with increasing atmospheric surface\ndensity and decreasing cometary density. Second, we consider the deposition of\nmass and kinetic energy in planetary atmospheres during cometary impacts, which\ndetermines the strength and duration of any atmospheric response. We\ndemonstrate that mass loss is dominated by fragmentation, not ablation. Small\ncomets deposit their entire mass within a fraction of an atmospheric scale\nheight, at an altitude determined by their initial radius. Large comets lose\nonly a small fraction of their mass to ablation in the lower atmosphere.",

We show that the turbulent von Karman flow displays\nvorticity-strain alignment behavior across a large range of Reynolds numbers,\nwhich are very similar to previous studies on homogeneous, isotropic\nturbulence. We observe that this behavior is amplified for the largest\ndownscale energy transfer events, which tend to be associated with sheet-like\ngeometries. These events are also shown to have characteristics previously\nassociated with high flow field non-linearity and singularities. In contrast\nthe largest upscale energy transfer events display much different structures\nwhich showcase a strong preference for vortex-compression. We then show further\nevidence to the argument that strain-self-amplification is the most salient\nfeature in characterizing cascade direction. Finally, we identify possible\ninvariant behavior for the largest energy transfer events, even at scales near\nthe Kolmogorov scale.",

In scenarios\nwhere supermassive black holes (SMBHs) form through the accretion of matter\nonto black hole seeds, a critical question arises: what role does dark matter\nplay in this process? We conduct a numerical investigation into the nonlinear\ndynamical evolution of black hole shadows and gravitational lensing effects\nresulting from the accretion of an ultralight, real scalar field onto a\nnon-rotating black hole. The scalar field is minimally coupled to Einstein's\ngravity, and our simulations focus on wave packets, parameterized by their wave\nnumber and width, as they interact with and are accreted by a dynamic black\nhole. Our results demonstrate significant growth in the apparent horizon,\nphoton ring, and Einstein ring sizes compared to those of a Schwarzschild black\nhole. These findings suggest that the observed photon ring and black hole\nshadow in Sgr\\,A*, and M87* may be influenced by the gravitational interaction\nbetween the black hole and ultralight scalar field dark matter.",

To address these challenges, here we propose the first\ntraining-free 4D video generation method that leverages the off-the-shelf video\ndiffusion models to generate multi-view videos from a single input video. Our\napproach consists of two key steps: (1) By designating the edge frames in the\nspatio-temporal sampling grid as key frames, we first synthesize them using a\nvideo diffusion model, leveraging a depth-based warping technique for guidance.\nThis approach ensures structural consistency across the generated frames,\npreserving spatial and temporal coherence. (2) We then interpolate the\nremaining frames using a video diffusion model, constructing a fully populated\nand temporally coherent sampling grid while preserving spatial and temporal\nconsistency. Through this approach, we extend a single video into a multi-view\nvideo along novel camera trajectories while maintaining spatio-temporal\nconsistency.

We applied\nvarious unsupervised clustering algorithms, including K-Means, Hierarchical\nClustering, GMM, and Spectral Clustering, to classify the spectral profiles.\nPrincipal Component Analysis revealed distinct spectral signatures associated\nwith specific minerals, facilitating precise identification. Clustering\nperformance varied by region, with K-Means achieving the highest\nsilhouette-score of 0.47, whereas GMM performed poorly with a score of only\n0.25. Non-negative Matrix Factorization aided in identifying similarities among\nclusters across different methods and reference spectra for olivine and\npyroxene. Hierarchical clustering emerged as the most reliable technique,\nachieving a 94\\% similarity with the olivine spectrum in one sample, whereas\nGMM exhibited notable variability. Overall, the analysis indicated that both\nHierarchical and K-Means methods yielded lower errors in total measurements,\nwith K-Means demonstrating superior performance in estimated dispersion and\nclustering. Additionally, GMM showed a higher root mean square error compared\nto the other models. The RMSE analysis confirmed K-Means as the most consistent\nalgorithm across all samples, suggesting a predominance of olivine in the\nVulcano region relative to pyroxene. This predominance is likely linked to\nhistorical formation conditions similar to volcanic processes on the Moon,\nwhere olivine-rich compositions are common in ancient lava flows and impact\nmelt rocks.",

Despite strong leadership\nprioritization of security (73%), automation gaps persist, with only 12% of\norganizations conducting security scans per commit.\n  Our findings highlight a growing integration of security tools, particularly\nAPI security (63%) and software composition analysis (62%), although container\nsecurity adoption remains low (34%). Looking ahead, SMEs anticipate artificial\nintelligence and machine learning to significantly influence DevSecOps,\nunderscoring the need for proactive adoption of AI-driven security\nenhancements.

Recently, Multi-Objective Quality-Diversity (MOQD)\nextends QD to problems with several objectives while preserving solution\ndiversity. MOQD has shown promise in fields such as robotics and materials\nscience, where finding trade-offs between competing objectives like energy\nefficiency and speed, or material properties is essential. However, existing\nmethods in MOQD rely on tessellating the feature space into a grid structure,\nwhich prevents their application in domains where feature spaces are unknown or\nmust be learned, such as complex biological systems or latent exploration\ntasks. In this work, we introduce Multi-Objective Unstructured Repertoire for\nQuality-Diversity (MOUR-QD), a MOQD algorithm designed for unstructured and\nunbounded feature spaces. We evaluate MOUR-QD on five robotic tasks.\nImportantly, we show that our method excels in tasks where features must be\nlearned, paving the way for applying MOQD to unsupervised domains. We also\ndemonstrate that MOUR-QD is advantageous in domains with unbounded feature\nspaces, outperforming existing grid-based methods.

    "abstract": "We present a $f(G,T)$ gravity-based reconstruction of Barrow Holographic Dark\nEnergy (BHDE). This approach extends the conventional HDE model by replacing\nthe Bekenstein-Hawking entropy with Barrow entropy, which encapsulates quantum\ngravitational corrections to the geometry of black hole horizons. We explore\nthe cosmological dynamics of a flat FRW background filled with a pressureless\ndust fluid, considering both conserved and non-conserved energy-momentum tensor\nmodels. To this end, we employ the Hubble horizon as the infrared cutoff and\nadopt a power-law ansatz for the scale factor. We then investigate the\nevolution of key cosmological parameters, including the equation-of-state\nparameter \\( \\omega_{GT} \\), the deceleration parameter \\( q \\), and the\nsquared sound speed $v_s^2$. Furthermore, we explore the dynamical behavior in\nthe $\\omega_{GT}-\\omega'_{GT}$ space. In the case of conserved energy-momentum\ntensor, our findings indicate that the BHDE model evolves from a\nquintessence-like regime into the phantom domain. This transition supports the\ncurrent accelerated expansion of the Universe and offers an improvement over\nthe original HDE model, which does not adequately account for the observed\nphenomenology. The corresponding $\\omega_{GT}-\\omega'_{GT}$ trajectory lies\nwithin the freezing region. On the other hand, within the non-conserved\nframework, the BHDE model exhibits phantom-like behavior in the early Universe,\nsubsequently evolving toward either a cosmological constant-like state or a\nquintessence-like regime. Notably, unlike the conserved scenario, the squared\nsound speed $v_s^2$ asymptotically attains positive values in the far future.\nMoreover, the trajectory in the $\\omega_{GT}-\\omega'_{GT}$ phase space displays\na thawing behavior. Finally, we evaluate the observational viability of our\nresults and compare them with predictions from alternative reconstructed DE\nmodels.",

The inclusion of leading-edge\nshedding restores physical dynamics to vortex-sheet models of falling bodies,\nand for the first time large-amplitude fluttering and tumbling are observed in\ninviscid simulations. Leading-edge shedding is achieved by introducing a novel\nquadrature rule and smoothing procedure for the Birkhoff-Rott equations. The\nsmoothing error is controlled by a novel fencing procedure. We find a\ntransition point between fluttering and tumbling that is consistent with\nprevious viscous simulations and experiments, and other falling motions such as\nlooping, autorotation are also observed as the plate density increases. The\ndipole street wakes behind the fluttering plates resemble those in experiments.\nWe consider plates bent into V shapes and study the effects of density and\nbending angle on the qualitative falling dynamics. At small densities,\nincreasing the bending angle stabilizes the falling motion into fluttering,\nwhile at large densities, decreasing the bending angle stabilizes the falling\nmotion into autorotation. In the autorotation regime, the magnitude of angular\nvelocity increases as time cubed before it reaches a terminal angular velocity,\nand in the fluttering regime, the fluttering frequency scales as the $-1/2$\npower of $R_1$, the plate density.",

    "abstract": "Talking head synthesis has emerged as a prominent research topic in computer\ngraphics and multimedia, yet most existing methods often struggle to strike a\nbalance between generation quality and computational efficiency, particularly\nunder real-time constraints. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that\nintegrates Gaussian Splatting with a structured Audio Factorization Plane\n(Audio-Plane) to enable high-quality, audio-synchronized, and real-time talking\nhead generation. For modeling a dynamic talking head, a 4D volume\nrepresentation, which consists of three axes in 3D space and one temporal axis\naligned with audio progression, is typically required. However, directly\nstoring and processing a dense 4D grid is impractical due to the high memory\nand computation cost, and lack of scalability for longer durations. We address\nthis challenge by decomposing the 4D volume representation into a set of\naudio-independent spatial planes and audio-dependent planes, forming a compact\nand interpretable representation for talking head modeling that we refer to as\nthe Audio-Plane. This factorized design allows for efficient and fine-grained\naudio-aware spatial encoding, and significantly enhances the model's ability to\ncapture complex lip dynamics driven by speech signals. To further improve\nregion-specific motion modeling, we introduce an audio-guided saliency\nsplatting mechanism based on region-aware modulation, which adaptively\nemphasizes highly dynamic regions such as the mouth area. This allows the model\nto focus its learning capacity on where it matters most for accurate\nspeech-driven animation. Extensive experiments on both the self-driven and the\ncross-driven settings demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art\nvisual quality, precise audio-lip synchronization, and real-time performance,\noutperforming prior approaches across both 2D- and 3D-based paradigms.",

This paper introduces a novel\nmethod for VAT prediction in pre-cystectomy CT, which is fully automated and\ndoes not require ground-truth VAT masks for training, overcoming aforementioned\nlimitations. Methods: We introduce the Kernel density Enhanced VAT Segmentator\n( KEVS), combining a DL semantic segmentation model, for multi-body feature\nprediction, with Gaussian kernel density estimation analysis of predicted\nsubcutaneous adipose tissue to achieve accurate scan-specific predictions of\nVAT in the abdominal cavity. Uniquely for a DL pipeline, KEVS does not require\nground-truth VAT masks. Results: We verify the ability of KEVS to accurately\nsegment abdominal organs in unseen CT data and compare KEVS VAT segmentation\npredictions to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in a dataset of 20\npre-cystectomy CT scans, collected from University College London Hospital\n(UCLH-Cyst), with expert ground-truth annotations. KEVS presents a 4.80% and\n6.02% improvement in Dice Coefficient over the second best DL and\nthresholding-based VAT segmentation techniques respectively when evaluated on\nUCLH-Cyst.

Traditionally, the creation of these\nmodels has been a manual process requiring not only deep modeling expertise but\nalso substantial domain knowledge of target systems. With the rapid advancement\nof generative artificial intelligence, large language models (LLMs) show\npotential for automating model generation. This work explores the generation of\ninstance models using LLMs, focusing specifically on producing XMI-based\ninstance models from Ecore metamodels and natural language specifications. We\nobserve that current LLMs struggle to directly generate valid XMI models. To\naddress this, we propose a two-step approach: first, using LLMs to produce a\nsimplified structured output containing all necessary instance model\ninformation, namely a conceptual instance model, and then compiling this\nintermediate representation into a valid XMI file. The conceptual instance\nmodel is format-independent, allowing it to be transformed into various\nmodeling formats via different compilers. The feasibility of the proposed\nmethod has been demonstrated using several LLMs, including GPT-4o, o1-preview,\nLlama 3.1 (8B and 70B). Results show that the proposed method significantly\nimproves the usability of LLMs for instance model generation tasks.

We demonstrate the utility of this approach for simulating the\ndynamics of Nile blue in ethanol, where we experimentally validate and\ndecompose the simulated 2DES to establish the nuclear motions of the\nchromophore and the solvent that couple to the excited state, connecting the\nspectroscopic signals to their molecular origin.",

However, conventional single-stage fine-tuning\nmethods struggle in extremely low-resource NMT settings, where training data is\nvery limited. This paper contributes to artificial intelligence by proposing\ntwo approaches for adapting msLLMs in these challenging scenarios: (1)\ncontinual pre-training (CPT), where the msLLM is further trained with\ndomain-specific monolingual data to compensate for the under-representation of\nLRLs, and (2) intermediate task transfer learning (ITTL), a method that\nfine-tunes the msLLM with both in-domain and out-of-domain parallel data to\nenhance its translation capabilities across various domains and tasks. As an\napplication in engineering, these methods are implemented in NMT systems for\nSinhala, Tamil, and English (six language pairs) in domain-specific, extremely\nlow-resource settings (datasets containing fewer than 100,000 samples). Our\nexperiments reveal that these approaches enhance translation performance by an\naverage of +1.47 bilingual evaluation understudy (BLEU) score compared to the\nstandard single-stage fine-tuning baseline across all translation directions.\nAdditionally, a multi-model ensemble further improves performance by an\nadditional BLEU score.",

Current radiotherapy imaging protocols are insufficient to\ndecouple and quantify cardiac motion, limiting substructure-specific motion\nconsiderations in treatment planning. We propose a 5D-MRI workflow for\nsubstructure-specific motion analysis, with future extension to margin\ncalculation.\n  Approach: Our 5D-MRI workflow was implemented for 10 healthy volunteers,\nranging from 23 to 65 years old, reconstructing images for end-exhale/inhale\nand active-exhale/inhale for end-systole/diastole. For motion assessment,\nproximal coronary arteries, chambers, great vessels, and cardiac valves/nodes\nwere contoured across all images and verified. Centroid/bounding box excursion\nwas calculated for cardiac, respiratory, and hysteresis motion. Distance\nmetrics were tested for statistical independence across substructure pairings.\n  Main Results: 5D-MRI images were successfully acquired and contoured for all\nvolunteers. Cardiac motion was greatest for the coronary arteries (specifically\nthe right coronary) and smallest for the great vessels. Respiratory motion was\ndominant in the S-I direction and largest for the inferior vena cava.\nRespiratory hysteresis was generally <5 mm but exceeded 5 mm for some\nvolunteers. For cardiac motion, there were statistical differences between the\ncoronary arteries, chambers, and great vessels, and between the right/left\nheart. Respiratory motion differed significantly between the base and apex of\nthe heart.\n  Significance: Our 5D-MRI workflow successfully decouples cardiorespiratory\nmotion with one ~5-minute acquisition. Cardiac motion was >5mm for the coronary\narteries and chambers, while respiratory motion was >5mm for all substructures.\nStatistical considerations and inter-patient variability indicate a\nsubstructure and patient-specific approach may be needed for PRV assessment.",

MV-TSG has two main challenges. First, the\nvariance metric is neither additive nor Markovian in a dynamic setting. Second,\nsimultaneous policy updates of all agents lead to a non-stationary environment\nfor each individual agent. Both challenges make dynamic programming\ninapplicable. In this paper, we study MV-TSGs from the perspective of\nsensitivity-based optimization. The performance difference and performance\nderivative formulas for joint policies are derived, which provide optimization\ninformation for MV-TSGs. We prove the existence of a deterministic Nash policy\nfor this problem.

We prove that the\nMV-MAPI algorithm converges to a first-order stationary point of the objective\nfunction.

We present a comparative\nanalysis of three distinct methods for bias mitigation: data sparsification,\nfeature modification, and synthetic data augmentation. Through experimental\nanalysis using the german credit dataset, we evaluate these approaches using\nmultiple fairness metrics, including statistical parity, equality of\nopportunity, and false positive rates. Our research demonstrates that while all\nmethods improve fairness metrics compared to the original dataset, stratified\nsampling and synthetic data augmentation using GraphSAGE prove particularly\neffective in balancing demographic representation while maintaining model\nperformance.

During levitation, the floater magnet is locked in a conical orbit at\nthe same frequency as the rotor. This rotation allows the sides of the same\npolarity of each magnet to face each other, which is responsible for the\ndynamic equilibrium of the floater magnet. Here, we theoretically explain the\nmotion of the floater in-axis and off-axis and highlight levitation stability\nconditions and their dependence on the size of the floater and the speed of the\nrotor. We experimentally studied the levitation conditions with respect to the\nangular velocity of the rotor for different floater's sizes and shapes. We\nobserved and analyzed the lower and upper limits of levitation.

Building on this perspective, we first introduce an alternating\ndesign approach to minimize idle time while preserving qubit efficiency in\nShor's algorithm. By strategically reordering tasks for simultaneous execution,\nwe achieve a substantial reduction in overall execution time. Extending this\napproach to distributed implementations, we demonstrate how task rearrangement\nenhances execution efficiency in the presence of multiple distribution\nchannels. Furthermore, to effectively evaluate the impact of design choices, we\nemploy static timing analysis (STA) -- a technique from classical circuit\ndesign -- to analyze circuit delays while accounting for hardware-specific\nexecution characteristics, such as measurement and reset delays in monolithic\narchitectures and ebit generation time in distributed settings. Finally, we\nvalidate our approach by integrating modular exponentiation circuits from QRISP\nand constructing circuits for factoring numbers up to 64 bits.

So far, Ni(Mo)/Ti SMs have been used in experiments that\nrequire to transport a polarized neutron beam due to their lower saturation\nmagnetization compared to Ni/Ti SMs. However, next generation $\\beta$ decay\nexperiments require SMs that depolarize below $10^{-4}$ per reflection to reach\ntheir targeted precision. The depolarization of a polarized neutron beam due to\nreflection from Ni(Mo)/Ti SMs has not yet been measured to that precision.\nRecently developed Cu/Ti SMs with a very low saturation magnetization compared\nto Ni(Mo)/Ti may serve as an alternative. In this paper, we test the\nperformance of both mirrors. At a first stage, we present four-states polarized\nneutron reflectivity (PNR) curves of Ni(Mo) and Cu monolayers measured at the\nneutron reflectometer SuperADAM and perform a full polarization analysis,\nshowing a difference between the magnetic scattering length density (mSLD) of\nboth materials, with Cu having a lower mSLD than Ni(Mo). These results are\ncorroborated with the full polarization analysis of four-states PNR curves of\n$m=2$ Ni(Mo)/Ti and Cu/Ti SMs. In a second stage, we measured the\ndepolarization ($D$) that a polarized neutron beam suffers after reflection\nfrom the same Ni(Mo)/Ti and Cu/Ti SMs by using the Opaque Test Bench setup. We\nfind upper limits for the depolarization of $D_\\text{Cu/Ti(4N5)}<7.6\\times\n10^{-5}$, $D_\\text{Ni(Mo)/Ti}<8.5\\times 10^{-5}$, and\n$D_\\text{Cu/Ti(2N6)}<6.0\\times 10^{-5}$ at the $1\\sigma$ confidence level,\nwhere (4N5) corresponds to a Ti purity of $99.995\\%$ and (2N6) to $99.6\\%$. The\nuncertainties are statistical. These results show that all three SMs are\nsuitable for being used in next generation $\\beta$ decay experiments.

We consider\nthe following semantic properties: zeroness and equivalence, input\nindependence, linearity, and analyticity. Our approach is based on Chen-Fliess\nseries, which provide a unique representation of the dynamics of such systems\nvia their formal generating series.\n  Our starting point is Fliess' seminal work showing how the semantic\nproperties above are mirrored by corresponding combinatorial properties on\ngenerating series. Next, we observe that the generating series of polynomial\nsystems coincide with the class of shuffle-finite series, a nonlinear\ngeneralisation of Sch\\\"utzenberger's rational series which has recently been\nstudied in the context of automata theory and enumerative combinatorics. We\nexploit and extend recent results in the algorithmic analysis of shuffle-finite\nseries (such as zeroness, equivalence, and commutativity) to show that the\nsemantic properties above can be decided exactly and in finite time for\npolynomial systems.

A potential strategy for improving their aerodynamic efficiency and\nreducing emissions is through active adaptation of their exterior shapes to the\naerodynamic environment. In this study, we present a reduced-scale morphing\nvehicle prototype capable of actively interacting with the aerodynamic\nenvironment to enhance fuel economy. Morphing is accomplished by retrofitting a\ndeformable structure actively actuated by built-in motors. The morphing vehicle\nprototype is integrated with an optimization algorithm that can autonomously\nidentify the structural shape that minimizes aerodynamic drag. The performance\nof the morphing vehicle prototype is investigated through an extensive\nexperimental campaign in a large-scale wind tunnel facility. The autonomous\noptimization algorithm identifies an optimal morphing shape that can elicit an\n8.5% reduction in the mean drag force. Our experiments provide a comprehensive\ndataset that validates the efficiency of shape morphing, demonstrating a clear\nand consistent decrease in the drag force as the vehicle transitions from a\nsuboptimal to the optimal shape. Insights gained from experiments on\nscaled-down models provide valuable guidelines for the design of full-size\nmorphing vehicles, which could lead to appreciable energy savings and\nreductions in GHG emissions.

In this regard, the Collision Avoidance Manoeuvre (CAM) has emerged as\na critical requirement for spacecraft operators, aiming to efficiently navigate\nthrough potentially hazardous encounters. Currently, when a conjunction is\npredicted, operators dedicate a considerable amount of time and resources to\ndesigning a CAM. Given the increased frequency of conjunctions, autonomous\ncomputation of fuel-efficient CAMs is crucial to reduce costs and improve the\nperformance of future operations. To facilitate the transition to an autonomous\nCAM design, it is useful to provide an overview of its state-of-the-art. In\nthis survey article, a collection of the most relevant research contributions\nin the field is presented. We review and categorize existing CAM techniques\nbased on their underlying principles, such as (i) analytic, semi-analytic, or\nnumerical solutions; (ii) impulsive or continuous thrust; (iii) deterministic\nor stochastic approaches, (iv) free or fixed manoeuvring time; (v) free or\nfixed thrust direction. Finally, to determine the validity of the algorithms\npotentially implementable for autonomous use, we perform a numerical comparison\non a large set of conjunctions. With this analysis, the algorithms are\nevaluated in terms of computational efficiency, accuracy, and optimality of the\ncomputed policy.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we are concerned with stationarity conditions and\nqualification conditions for optimization problems with disjunctive\nconstraints. This class covers, among others, optimization problems with\ncomplementarity, vanishing, or switching constraints which are notoriously\nchallenging due to their highly combinatorial structure. The focus of our study\nis twofold. First, we investigate approximate stationarity conditions and the\nassociated strict constraint qualifications which can be used to infer\nstationarity of local minimizers. While such concepts are already known in the\ncontext of so-called Mordukhovich-stationarity, we introduce suitable\nextensions associated with strong stationarity. Second, a qualification\ncondition is established which, based on an approximately Mordukhovich- or\nstrongly stationary point, can be used to infer its Mordukhovich- or strong\nstationarity, respectively. In contrast to the aforementioned strict constraint\nqualifications, this condition depends on the involved sequences justifying\napproximate stationarity and, thus, is not a constraint qualification in the\nnarrower sense. However, it is much easier to verify as it merely requires to\ncheck the (positive) linear independence of a certain family of gradients. In\nfact, it provides a characterization of stationarity and, thus, is weaker than\nthese strict constraint qualifications. In order to illustrate the obtained\nfindings, they are applied to optimization problems with complementarity\nconstraints where they can be naturally extended to the well-known concepts of\nweak and Clarke-stationarity.",

Predictiveness curve is\ncommonly used as a graphical tool to measure the predictive ability of a risk\nprediction model on a single continuous biomarker.

Through simulation, we\ncompared the performance of the predictiveness U to other three summary\nindices: R square, Total Gain, and Average Entropy, and showed that\nPredictiveness U outperformed the other three indexes in terms of unbiasedness\nand robustness. Moreover, we simulated a series of rare-variants disease model,\nfound partial predictiveness U performed better than global predictiveness U.\nFinally, we conducted a real data analysis, using predictiveness curve and\npredictiveness U to evaluate a risk prediction model for Nicotine Dependence.",

To resolve this\nparadox, this work bridges this conceptual gap by developing a geometric\nframework that tracks token dynamics across Transformers layers. Through\nlayer-wise analysis of intrinsic dimensions across multiple architectures, we\nreveal an expansion-contraction pattern where tokens diffuse to a \"working\nspace\" and then progressively project onto lower-dimensional submanifolds. Our\nfinding implies a negative correlation between the working space dimension and\nparameter-sensitive performance of the LLMs, and indicates that effective\nmodels tend to compress tokens into approximately 10-dimensional submanifolds,\nclosely resembling human semantic spaces.

The main motivation for investigating such\nentities comes from their connection with the classification of regular\nlanguages via Eilenberg's correspondence. This connection prompted the study of\nvarious natural operators on pseudovarieties and led to several important\nquestions, both algebraic and algorithmic. The most important of these\nquestions is decidability: given a finite semigroup is there an algorithm that\ntests whether it belongs to the pseudovariety? Since the most relevant\noperators on pseudovarieties do not preserve decidability, one often seeks to\nestablish stronger properties. A key role is played by relatively free\nprofinite semigroups, which is the counterpart of free algebras in universal\nalgebra.

As this curvature-based analysis framework is sampling\nbased, it also allows further statistical analyses of the time evolution of the\nkinetic energies and curvatures considered. The main findings of these analyses\nare that the slope for the inertial range also appears as a salient point in\nthe probability density distribution of the angle of the vector comprising the\ntwo time evolution components. This density distribution further exhibits\nchanging features of its shape depending on the Rayleigh number. This Rayleigh\nnumber evolution allows to observe a change in the flow regime between the\nRayleigh numbers $10^6$ and $10^7$. Insight into this regime change is gathered\nby conditionally sampling the salient time evolution behaviours and projecting\nthem back into physical space.

We exploit\nStAGE to compute the cosmic star formation rate (SFR) density contributed by\nthe progenitors of local QGs, and show it to remarkably agree with that\nestimated for high-$z$ dusty star-forming galaxies which are faint/dark in the\nNIR, so pointing toward a direct progenitor-descendant connection among these\ngalaxy populations.

Focusing on\nthe supermassive black holes (BHs) hosted by massive QGs, we exploit StAGE to\nreconstruct the average BH mass assembly history, the cosmic BH accretion rate\ndensity as a function of redshift, and the evolution of the Magorrian-like\nrelationship between the relic stellar and BH masses.

We evaluate LIM on various dynamic\ndatasets, benchmarking against image-space interpolation methods (e.g., FiLM)\nand direct triplane linear interpolation, and demonstrate clear advantages. In\nsummary, LIM is the first feed-forward model capable of high-speed tracked 4D\nasset reconstruction across diverse categories.",

    "abstract": "Evaporation-driven salt precipitation occurs in different contexts and leads\nto challenges in case of e.g. soil salinization or stress-introducing\nprecipitation in building material. During evaporation, brine in porous media\ngets concentrated due to the loss of water until the solubility limit is\nreached and salt precipitates. Different models on the REV-scale are available,\nwhich describe the effective behavior of the system. But several studies\nindicate that the controlling processes of evaporation-driven salt\nprecipitation act on the pore scale. Thus, pore-scale models are necessary for\na detailed understanding. In this paper, we present a dynamic, two-phase,\nnon-isothermal pore-network model for evaporation-driven salt precipitation.\nSalt precipitation is modeled with a kinetic reaction and the resulting\npore-space alteration is considered. Further, the model includes influence of\nthe salt concentration on the fluid properties and liquid corner films. The\ncapabilities of the model are demonstrated in several numerical evaporation\nexperiments. The model is able to represent the effects of the decrease of pore\nspace due to precipitation on the flow, phase displacement and salt transport.\nFurther, the influence of the location of the brine-air interface and its\ndependency on the presence of liquid corner flow is described. Additionally,\npore-scale heterogeneities and their effects like capillary pumping can be\nmodeled. All these pore-scale effects have an influence on the salt\nprecipitation process and the global behavior of the porous system. The\npresented model provides a general tool for further investigations of salt\nprecipitation on the pore scale and transfer to the REV scale.",

In this\npaper, we study the problem of forming complex shapes with functionally limited\nmobile robots, which have to rely on other robots to precisely locate\nthemselves. The goal is to decide whether a given shape can be filled by a\ngiven set of robots; in case the answer is yes, to complete a shape formation\nprocess as fast as possible with a minimum amount of communication. Traditional\napproaches either require global coordinates for each robot or are prone to\nfailure when attempting to form complex shapes beyond the capability of given\napproaches - the latter calls for a decision procedure that can tell whether a\ntarget shape can be formed before the actual shape-forming process starts. In\nthis paper, we develop a method that does not require global coordinate\ninformation during the execution process and can effectively decide whether it\nis feasible to form the desired shape. The latter is achieved via a planning\nprocedure that is capable of handling a variety of complex shapes, in\nparticular, those with holes, and assigning a simple piece of scheduling\ninformation to each robot, facilitating subsequent distributed execution, which\ndoes not rely on the coordinates of all robots but only those of neighboring\nones.

    "abstract": "We analyse the dynamics within the stability boundary between laminar and\nturbulent square duct flow with the aid of an edge-tracking algorithm. As for\nthe circular pipe, the edge state turns out to be a chaotic attractor within\nthe edge if the flow is not constrained to a symmetric subspace. The chaotic\nedge state dynamics is characterised by a sequence of alternating quiescent\nphases and regularly occurring bursting episodes. These latter reflect the\ndifferent stages of the well-known streak-vortex interaction in near-wall\nturbulence: The edge states feature most of the time a single streak with a\nnumber of flanking quasi-streamwise vortices attached to one of the four\nsurrounding walls. The initially straight streak undergoes the classical linear\ninstability and eventually breaks in an intense bursting event due to the\naction of the quasi-streamwise vortices. At the same time, the vortices give\nrise to a new generation of low-speed streaks at one of the neighbouring walls,\nthereby causing the turbulent activity to `switch' from one wall to the other.\nWhen restricting the edge dynamics to a single or twofold mirror-symmetric\nsubspace, on the other hand, the outlined bursting and wall-switching episodes\nbecome self-recurrent in time. These edge states thus represent the first\nperiodic orbits found in the square duct. In contrast to the chaotic edge\nstates in the non-symmetric case, the imposed symmetries enforce analogue\nbursting cycles to simultaneously appear at two parallel opposing walls in a\nmirror-symmetric configuration. Both localisation of the turbulent activity to\none or two walls and wall switching are shown to be a common phenomenon in low\nReynolds number duct turbulence. We therefore argue that the marginally\nturbulent trajectories transiently visit the identified edge states during\nthese episodes, so that the edge states become actively involved in the\nturbulent dynamics.",

This\nnarrow focus creates a significant gap in repair capabilities across the\nprogramming language spectrum, where the full potential of LLMs for\ncomprehensive multilingual program repair remains largely unexplored. To\naddress this limitation, we introduce a novel cross-language program repair\napproach LANTERN that leverages LLMs' differential proficiency across languages\nthrough a multi-agent iterative repair paradigm. Our technique strategically\ntranslates defective code from languages where LLMs exhibit weaker repair\ncapabilities to languages where they demonstrate stronger performance, without\nrequiring additional training. A key innovation of our approach is an LLM-based\ndecision-making system that dynamically selects optimal target languages based\non bug characteristics and continuously incorporates feedback from previous\nrepair attempts. We evaluate our method on xCodeEval, a comprehensive\nmultilingual benchmark comprising 5,068 bugs across 11 programming languages.\nResults demonstrate significant enhancement in repair effectiveness,\nparticularly for underrepresented languages, with Rust showing a 22.09%\nimprovement in Pass@10 metrics.

This has severely affected the survivability of many\nnow-deemed vulnerable or endangered languages, such as Occitan and Sicilian.\nThese languages often share some characteristics, such as elements of their\ngrammar and lexicon, with other high-resource languages, e.g. French or\nItalian. They can be clustered into groups of language varieties with various\ndegrees of mutual intelligibility. Current search systems are not usually\ntrained on many of these low-resource varieties, leading search users to\nexpress their needs in a high-resource language instead. This problem is\nfurther complicated when most information content is expressed in a\nhigh-resource language, inhibiting even more retrieval in low-resource\nlanguages. We show that current search systems are not robust across language\nvarieties, severely affecting retrieval effectiveness.

    "abstract": "The design of robust controllers for triple inverted pendulum systems\npresents significant challenges due to their inherent instability and nonlinear\ndynamics. Furthermore, uncertainties in system parameters further complicate\nthe control design. This paper investigates a robust control strategy for\ntriple inverted pendulums under parameter uncertainty. Two control approaches,\nnamely the $H_\\infty$ controller and the $\\mu$-synthesis controller, are\ncompared in terms of their ability to achieve reference tracking and\ndisturbance rejection. Simulation results demonstrate that the $H_\\infty$\ncontroller provides superior transient performance, making it a promising\nsolution for the robust stabilization of such complex systems.",

    "abstract": "Many searches for continuous gravitational waves face significant\ncomputational challenges due to the need to explore large parameter spaces\ncharacterized by unknown parameters. Parameter-space metrics are used to\npredict the relative loss of signal power when the searched parameters differ\nfrom the true signal parameters. In this paper we present generalized\nparameter-space metrics for the $\\mathcal{F}$-statistic (a detection statistic\nused in many searches) that improve upon previous idealized metrics by\nincorporating realistic effects such as data gaps and varying noise floors. We\nderive a new marginalized $\\mathcal{F}$-statistic metric that is more accurate\nthan the previous averaged $\\mathcal{F}$-statistic metric, especially for short\ncoherent segments. We also derive a more accurate semi-coherent metric that\nproperly accounts for the signal-power variability over segments. We provide\nnumerical tests illustrating that the new generalized metrics provide more\naccurate mismatch predictions than previous expressions. More accurate metrics\ncan result in a reduced number of templates needed for a given search, a\nfeature that could improve the sensitivity of future searches.",

    "abstract": "We report a Mueller matrix ellipsometer design using dual continuously\nrotating anisotropic meta wave plates which determines the full set of Mueller\nmatrix elements in the terahertz spectral range. The instrument operates in the\nfrequency domain and employs a frequency tunable, solid state synthesizer\nbased, continuous wave terahertz source with sub-MHz bandwidth. The implemented\nsource permits operation within 82-125 GHz and 170-250 GHz, without and with an\nadditional frequency doubler, respectively. The terahertz transparent meta wave\nplates consist of 3D-printed polymer based columnar thin film structures with\nsubwavelength dimensions. The rotating wave plates produce sufficient\nmodulation of the Stokes vector components of transmitted terahertz light to\nuse the wave plates in polarization state generator and polarization state\ndetector devices. Fast terahertz light detection rate of a quasi optical solid\nstate detector permits acquisition with few microsecond temporal resolution and\nelectronic sweeping control of the source frequency. We develop a fast\nfrequency sweeping scheme while continuously rotating the terahertz wave\nplates. Subsequent sorting of measured data permits measurements of Mueller\nmatrix elements at hundreds of different wavelengths. The Mueller matrix\nelements are obtained by forward numerical reduction of the measured data using\nan algorithm developed by Ruder et al.[Opt. Lett. 45, 3541 (2020)]. The\ninstrument is combined with a magnetocryostat capable of reaching magnetic\nfield strengths at the sample position of -8 T...8 T and sample temperatures\nfrom 4 K...400 K. Hence, the instrument is suitable to measure the full Mueller\nmatrix of samples with magnetic resonances as demonstrated recently by Rindert\net al. [Phys. Rev. B 110, 054413 (2024)].

    "abstract": "Neural networks have emerged as a powerful paradigm for tasks in high energy\nphysics, yet their opaque training process renders them as a black box. In\ncontrast, the traditional cut flow method offers simplicity and\ninterpretability but requires extensive manual tuning to identify optimal cut\nboundaries. To merge the strengths of both approaches, we propose the Learnable\nCut Flow (LCF), a neural network that transforms the traditional cut selection\ninto a fully differentiable, data-driven process. LCF implements two cut\nstrategies-parallel, where observable distributions are treated independently,\nand sequential, where prior cuts shape subsequent ones-to flexibly determine\noptimal boundaries. Building on this strategy, we introduce the Learnable\nImportance, a metric that quantifies feature importance and adjusts their\ncontributions to the loss accordingly, offering model-driven insights unlike\nad-hoc metrics. To ensure differentiability, a modified loss function replaces\nhard cuts with mask operations, preserving data shape throughout the training\nprocess. LCF is tested on six varied mock datasets and a realistic diboson vs.\nQCD dataset. Results demonstrate that LCF 1. accurately learns cut boundaries\nacross typical feature distributions in both parallel and sequential\nstrategies, 2. assigns higher importance to discriminative features with\nminimal overlap, 3. handles redundant or correlated features robustly, and 4.\nperforms effectively in real-world scenarios. In the diboson dataset, LCF\ninitially underperforms boosted decision trees and multiplayer perceptrons when\nusing all observables. LCF bridges the gap between traditional cut flow method\nand modern black-box neural networks, delivering actionable insights into the\ntraining process and feature importance.

    "abstract": "Autonomous exploration in mobile robotics often involves a trade-off between\ntwo objectives: maximizing environmental coverage and minimizing the total path\nlength. In the widely used information gain paradigm, exploration is guided by\nthe expected value of observations. While this approach is effective under\nbudget-constrained settings--where only a limited number of observations can be\nmade--it fails to align with quality-constrained scenarios, in which the robot\nmust fully explore the environment to a desired level of certainty or quality.\nIn such cases, total information gain is effectively fixed, and maximizing it\nper step can lead to inefficient, greedy behavior and unnecessary backtracking.\nThis paper argues that information gain should not serve as an optimization\nobjective in quality-constrained exploration. Instead, it should be used to\nfilter viable candidate actions. We propose a novel heuristic, distance\nadvantage, which selects candidate frontiers based on a trade-off between\nproximity to the robot and remoteness from other frontiers. This heuristic aims\nto reduce future detours by prioritizing exploration of isolated regions before\nthe robot's opportunity to visit them efficiently has passed. We evaluate our\nmethod in simulated environments against classical frontier-based exploration\nand gain-maximizing approaches. Results show that distance advantage\nsignificantly reduces total path length across a variety of environments, both\nwith and without access to prior map predictions. Our findings challenge the\nassumption that more accurate gain estimation improves performance and offer a\nmore suitable alternative for the quality-constrained exploration paradigm.",

    "abstract": "We introduce Scenario Dreamer, a fully data-driven generative simulator for\nautonomous vehicle planning that generates both the initial traffic scene -\ncomprising a lane graph and agent bounding boxes - and closed-loop agent\nbehaviours. Existing methods for generating driving simulation environments\nencode the initial traffic scene as a rasterized image and, as such, require\nparameter-heavy networks that perform unnecessary computation due to many empty\npixels in the rasterized scene. Moreover, we find that existing methods that\nemploy rule-based agent behaviours lack diversity and realism. Scenario Dreamer\ninstead employs a novel vectorized latent diffusion model for initial scene\ngeneration that directly operates on the vectorized scene elements and an\nautoregressive Transformer for data-driven agent behaviour simulation. Scenario\nDreamer additionally supports scene extrapolation via diffusion inpainting,\nenabling the generation of unbounded simulation environments. Extensive\nexperiments show that Scenario Dreamer outperforms existing generative\nsimulators in realism and efficiency: the vectorized scene-generation base\nmodel achieves superior generation quality with around 2x fewer parameters, 6x\nlower generation latency, and 10x fewer GPU training hours compared to the\nstrongest baseline. We confirm its practical utility by showing that\nreinforcement learning planning agents are more challenged in Scenario Dreamer\nenvironments than traditional non-generative simulation environments,\nespecially on long and adversarial driving environments.",

Large-scale\nanalysis of model forecasts during the COVID-19 pandemic has shown that the\nmodel rank distribution with respect to accuracy is heterogeneous and that\nensemble forecasts have the highest average accuracy. Building on that work we\ngenerated a maximally diverse synthetic dataset of 324 different\nhospitalisation time-series that correspond to different disease\ncharacteristics and public health responses. We evaluated forecasts from 14\ncomponent models and 6 different ensembles. Our results show that component\nmodel accuracy was heterogeneous and varied depending on the current rate of\ndisease transmission. Going from 7 day to 14 day forecasts mechanistic models\nimproved in relative accuracy compared to statistical models. A novel adaptive\nensemble method outperforms all other ensembles, but is closely followed by a\nmedian ensemble. We also investigated the relationship between ensemble error\nand variability of component forecasts and show that the coefficient of\nvariation is predictive of future error. Lastly, we validated the results on\ndata from the COVID-19 pandemic in Sweden.

This quality increase also\nrequires additional power and computation to capture and encode high-quality\nmedia. We propose a method to reduce the overall power consumption for\ncapturing high-quality videos in mobile devices. Using video frame\ninterpolation (VFI), sensors can be driven at lower frame rate, which reduces\nsensor power consumption. With modern RGB hybrid event-based vision sensors\n(EVS), event data can be used to guide the interpolation, leading to results of\nmuch higher quality. If applied naively, interpolation methods can be expensive\nand lead to large amounts of intermediate data before video is encoded. This\npaper proposes a video encoder that generates a bitstream for high frame rate\nvideo without explicit interpolation. The proposed method estimates encoded\nvideo data (notably motion vectors) rather than frames. Thus, an encoded video\nfile can be produced directly without explicitly producing intermediate frames.",

    "abstract": "Residential electricity demand forecasting is critical for efficient energy\nmanagement and grid stability. Accurate predictions enable utility companies to\noptimize planning and operations. However, real-world residential electricity\ndemand data often exhibit intricate temporal variability, including multiple\nseasonalities, periodicities, and abrupt fluctuations, which pose significant\nchallenges for forecasting models. Previous models that rely on statistical\nmethods, recurrent, convolutional neural networks, and transformers often\nstruggle to capture these intricate temporal dynamics. To address these\nchallenges, we propose the Seasonal-Periodic Decomposition Network (SPDNet), a\nnovel deep learning framework consisting of two main modules. The first is the\nSeasonal-Trend Decomposition Module (STDM), which decomposes the input data\ninto trend, seasonal, and residual components. The second is the Periodical\nDecomposition Module (PDM), which employs the Fast Fourier Transform to\nidentify the dominant periods. For each dominant period, 1D input data is\nreshaped into a 2D tensor, where rows represent periods and columns correspond\nto frequencies. The 2D representations are then processed through three\nsubmodules: a 1D convolution to capture sharp fluctuations, a transformer-based\nencoder to model global patterns, and a 2D convolution to capture interactions\nbetween periods. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world residential\nelectricity load data demonstrate that SPDNet outperforms traditional and\nadvanced models in both forecasting accuracy and computational efficiency.

    "abstract": "Since black holes lack a straightforward notion of geometrical volume due to\ntheir event horizon structure and coordinate dependence, various approaches\nhave been proposed to introduce a meaningful geometric and thermodynamic\nvolume. There is no volume in classical black hole thermodynamics, the\nnonextensivity of black holes is a consequence. Extensivity of such systems can\nbe restored by introducing a new thermodynamic state variable, typically the\nvolume, the mass or the number of particles. Smarr relations show that black\nhole thermodynamics is nonextensive. However, restored extensivity leads to a\nvolume which corresponds to geometric concepts and is also meaningful from a\nphysical point of view. The article examines various volume definitions in the\ncontext of Anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes and their implications for phase\ntransitions, focusing on the Hawking-Page transition in Kerr-AdS spacetime,\nincluding the Christodoulou-Rovelli volume.",

We discuss the applicability of the\nanalytical formula for doublon-holon (DH) pair production, previously derived\nfor the one-dimensional Hubbard model, which highlights the relationship\nbetween the tunneling threshold, the charge gap, and the correlation length. We\ntest the formulas ability to predict both DH pair production and energy\nincrease rate. Using tensor-network-based approaches, we demonstrate that the\nformula provides accurate predictions in the absence of excitonic states\nfacilitated by the nearest-neighbor interaction $V$.

We investigate the role of chaotic instabilities on single particle\norbits in leading to nearly-invariant phase-space distributions, aiming at\ndisentangling it from the chaos induced by collective oscillations in the\nself-consistent potential. We explore as function of the systems size (i.e.\nnumber of particles $N$) the chaoticity in terms of the largest Lyapunov\nexponent of test trajectories in a simplified model of gravitational cold\ncollapse, mimicking a $N-$body calculation via a time dependent smooth\npotential and a noise-friction process accounting for the discreteness effects.\nA new numerical method to evaluate effective Lyapunov exponents for stochastic\nmodels is presented and tested. We find that the evolution of the phase-space\nof independent trajectories reproduces rather well what observed in\nself-consistent $N-$body simulations of dissipationless collapses. The\nchaoticity of test orbits rapidly decreases with $N$ for particles that remain\nweakly bounded in the model potential, while it decreases with different power\nlaws for more bound orbits, consistently with what observed in previous\nself-consistent $N$-body simulations. The largest Lyapunov exponents of\nensembles of orbits starting from initial conditions uniformly sampling the\naccessible phase-space are somewhat constant for $N\\lesssim 10^9$, while\ndecreases towards the continuum limit with a power-law trend.

    "abstract": "Fatigue life characterizes the duration a material can function before\nfailure under specific environmental conditions, and is traditionally assessed\nusing stress-life (S-N) curves. While machine learning and deep learning offer\npromising results for fatigue life prediction, they face the overfitting\nchallenge because of the small size of fatigue experimental data in specific\nmaterials. To address this challenge, we propose, DeepOFormer, by formulating\nS-N curve prediction as an operator learning problem. DeepOFormer improves the\ndeep operator learning framework with a transformer-based encoder and a mean L2\nrelative error loss function. We also consider Stussi, Weibull, and Pascual and\nMeeker (PM) features as domain-informed features. These features are motivated\nby empirical fatigue models. To evaluate the performance of our DeepOFormer, we\ncompare it with different deep learning models and XGBoost on a dataset with 54\nS-N curves of aluminum alloys. With seven different aluminum alloys selected\nfor testing, our DeepOFormer achieves an R2 of 0.9515, a mean absolute error of\n0.2080, and a mean relative error of 0.5077, significantly outperforming\nstate-of-the-art deep/machine learning methods including DeepONet,\nTabTransformer, and XGBoost, etc. The results highlight that our Deep0Former\nintegrating with domain-informed features substantially improves prediction\naccuracy and generalization capabilities for fatigue life prediction in\naluminum alloys.",

Expectedly, the simplest route is via the\ngenerating functional of time ordered N-point functions which requires a\nLorentzian version of the Wetterich equation and heat kernel methods employed\nin ASQG.\n  In the present contribution we consider gravity coupled to Gaussian dust\nmatter. This is a generally covariant Lorentzian signature system, which can be\nconsidered as a field theoretical implementation of the idealisation of a\ncongruence of collision free test observers in free fall, filling the universe.\nThe field theory version correctly accounts for geometry -- matter backreaction\nand thus in principle serves as a dark matter model. Moreover, the intuitive\ngeometric interpretation selects a preferred reference frame that allows to\ndisentangle gauge degrees of freedom from observables. The CQG treatment of\nthis theory has already been considered in the past.\n  For this particular matter content it is possible to formulate the quantum\nfield theory of observables as a non-linear $\\sigma$ model described by a\nhighly non-linear conservative Hamiltonian. This allows to apply techniques\nfrom Euclidean field theory to derive the generating functional of Schwinger\nN-point functions which can be treated with the standard Euclidean version of\nthe heat kernel methods employed in ASQG. The corresponding Euclidean action is\nclosely related to Euclidean signature gravity but not identical to it despite\nthe fact that the underlying Hamiltonian is for Lorentzian signature gravity.",

As the number of variables in the model (of\nentities in the network) grow, the network inference and interpretation become\nmore complex. The Normal-Block model is introduced, a new model that clusters\nvariables and consider a network at the cluster level. Normal-Block both adds\nstructure to the network and reduces its size.

In our framework, ultra high energy\nneutrinos originate from the decay of a super-heavy sterile neutrino produced\nvia the Hawking evaporation of primordial black holes (PBHs) in the early\nUniverse. Employing an ultraviolet complete type-I seesaw model, we demonstrate\nthat while two sterile neutrinos are responsible for light neutrino masses as\nrequired by oscillation data, one sterile neutrino can have an exceedingly\nfeeble coupling, allowing its lifetime to be tuned so that its decay yields a\nneutrino flux consistent with the observed event. Furthermore, our scenario\npredicts two distinct GW signatures: one arising from gravitons emitted during\nPBH evaporation and another from the Bremsstrahlung process during the decay of\nthe sterile neutrino. These complementary signals provide a multi-messenger\nprobe of the underlying physics. Our results thus offer a compelling\nexplanation for the KM3-230213A event and open new avenues for investigating\nthe interplay between high-energy neutrino astronomy and gravitational wave\ncosmology.",

In particular, we identify a nonempty subset of\nthe RUM spectrum which derives from the joint eigenvalues of generators for the\nlinear part of the symmetry group. These joint eigenvalues give rise to\n$\\chi$-symmetric flexes which span the space of translations for the framework.\nWe show that the RUM spectrum is a union of Bohr-Fourier spectra arising from\ntwisted almost-periodic flexes of the framework.

The matrix-free approach enables full compatibility with high order IIM\ndiscretizations of boundary and interface conditions, as well as high order\nwavelet-adapted multiresolution grids. Through verification and analysis on 2D\ndomains, we demonstrate the ability of the algorithm to provide high order\naccurate results to Laplace and Poisson problems with Dirichlet, Neumann,\nand/or interface jump boundary conditions, all effectively preconditioned using\nthe multigrid method. We further show that the proposed method is able to\nefficiently solve high order discretizations of Laplace and Poisson problems on\ncomplex 3D domains using thousands of compute cores and on multiresolution\ngrids. To our knowledge, this work presents the largest problem sizes tackled\nwith high order immersed methods applied to elliptic partial differential\nequations, and the first high order results on 3D multiresolution adaptive\ngrids.

    "abstract": "Fairness studies of algorithmic decision-making systems often simplify\ncomplex decision processes, such as bail or loan approvals, into binary\nclassification tasks. However, these approaches overlook that such decisions\nare not inherently binary (e.g., approve or not approve bail or loan); they\nalso involve non-binary treatment decisions (e.g., bail conditions or loan\nterms) that can influence the downstream outcomes (e.g., loan repayment or\nreoffending). In this paper, we argue that non-binary treatment decisions are\nintegral to the decision process and controlled by decision-makers and,\ntherefore, should be central to fairness analyses in algorithmic\ndecision-making. We propose a causal framework that extends fairness analyses\nand explicitly distinguishes between decision-subjects' covariates and the\ntreatment decisions. This specification allows decision-makers to use our\nframework to (i) measure treatment disparity and its downstream effects in\nhistorical data and, using counterfactual reasoning, (ii) mitigate the impact\nof past unfair treatment decisions when automating decision-making. We use our\nframework to empirically analyze four widely used loan approval datasets to\nreveal potential disparity in non-binary treatment decisions and their\ndiscriminatory impact on outcomes, highlighting the need to incorporate\ntreatment decisions in fairness assessments. Moreover, by intervening in\ntreatment decisions, we show that our framework effectively mitigates treatment\ndiscrimination from historical data to ensure fair risk score estimation and\n(non-binary) decision-making processes that benefit all stakeholders.",

    "abstract": "Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have become very widespread and are\nused to solve a wide variety of tasks. To successfully handle these tasks, LLMs\nrequire longer training times and larger model sizes. This makes LLMs ideal\ncandidates for pruning methods that reduce computational demands while\nmaintaining performance. Previous methods require a retraining phase after\npruning to maintain the original model's performance. However, state-of-the-art\npruning methods, such as Wanda, prune the model without retraining, making the\npruning process faster and more efficient. Building upon Wanda's work, this\nstudy provides a theoretical explanation of why the method is effective and\nleverages these insights to enhance the pruning process. Specifically, a\ntheoretical analysis of the pruning problem reveals a common scenario in\nMachine Learning where Wanda is the optimal pruning method. Furthermore, this\nanalysis is extended to cases where Wanda is no longer optimal, leading to the\ndevelopment of a new method, STADE, based on the standard deviation of the\ninput. From a theoretical standpoint, STADE demonstrates better generality\nacross different scenarios. Finally, extensive experiments on Llama and Open\nPre-trained Transformers (OPT) models validate these theoretical findings,\nshowing that depending on the training conditions, Wanda's optimal performance\nvaries as predicted by the theoretical framework. These insights contribute to\na more robust understanding of pruning strategies and their practical\nimplications. Code is available at: https://github.com/Coello-dev/STADE/",

    "abstract": "A comparison between neural network clustering (NNC), hierarchical clustering\n(HC) and K-means clustering (KMC) is performed to evaluate the computational\nsuperiority of these three machine learning (ML) techniques for organizing\nlarge datasets into clusters. For NNC, a self-organizing map (SOM) training was\napplied to a collection of wavefront sensor reconstructions, decomposed in\nterms of 15 Zernike coefficients, characterizing the optical aberrations of the\nphase front transmitted by fluidic lenses. In order to understand the\ndistribution and structure of the 15 Zernike variables within an input space,\nSOM-neighboring weight distances, SOM-sample hits, SOM-weight positions and\nSOM-weight planes were analyzed to form a visual interpretation of the system's\nstructural properties. In the case of HC, the data was partitioned using a\ncombined dissimilarity-linkage matrix computation. The effectiveness of this\nmethod was confirmed by a high cophenetic correlation coefficient value\n(c=0.9651). Additionally, a maximum number of clusters was established by\nsetting an inconsistency cutoff of 0.8, yielding a total of 7 clusters for\nsystem segmentation. In addition, a KMC approach was employed to establish a\nquantitative measure of clustering segmentation efficiency, obtaining a\nsillhoute average value of 0.905 for data segmentation into K=5 non-overlapping\nclusters. On the other hand, the NNC analysis revealed that the 15 variables\ncould be characterized through the collective influence of 8 clusters. It was\nestablished that the formation of clusters through the combined linkage and\ndissimilarity algorithms of HC alongside KMC is a more dependable clustering\nsolution than separate assessment via NNC or HC, where altering the SOM size or\ninconsistency cutoff can lead to completely new clustering configurations.",

(2024); b) discover at\nleast 11 new late L- and T-type dwarfs by a specific spectral index search in\nQ1 data; and c) spectroscopically confirm one hundred more candidates from a\nnew photometric selection conducted by Zerjal et al. (in prep.). We present a\npreliminary list of Euclid ultracool dwarf templates built by the combination\nof the best spectra from all these searches. We include the first spectral\nanalysis of confirmed ultracool dwarfs from Q1 data; spectral classifications;\ndetermination of effective temperatures; H2O, CH4 and NH3 spectral indices; and\nmeasurements of the KI absorption doublet. This paper is a first step in the\nstudy of Euclid ultracool dwarfs and will be improved with each subsequent data\nrelease.",

Similar coupling of edge\nmodes propagating along a boundary of 2D material with the substrate\nexcitations remains unexplored. This paper aims to bridge this gap by\ninvestigating the edge-substrate hybrid modes using the exact Wiener-Hopf\nanalytical approach. We analyze dispersions, decay rate, and confinement of\nsuch hybrid modes both without magnetic field (plasmon-phonon and phonon-phonon\nhybrid modes) and in quantizing magnetic field where edge magnetoplasmons\nhybridize with substrate phonons. The hybrid modes are predicted to occur in\nTHz and far-IR ranges for several combinations of quasi-2D materials (single-\nand bilayer graphene, quantum wells, thin-film semiconductors) and substrates\nwith polar-phonon resonances.",

While sharing some characteristics with\ngases, liquids, and solids, granular matter exhibits a wealth of phenomena that\ndefy these analogies and are yet to be fully understood. Advancing granular\nphysics requires experimental observation at the level of individual particles\nand over a wide range of dynamics. Specifically, it calls for the ability to\ntrack large numbers of particles simultaneously, in three dimensions (3D), and\nwith high spatial and temporal resolution. Here, we introduce magnetic\nresonance particle tracking (MRPT) and show it to achieve such recording with\nresolution on the scale of micrometers and milliseconds. Enabled by MRPT, we\nreport the direct study of granular glassy dynamics in 3D. Tracking a vibrated\ngranular system over six temporal orders of magnitude revealed dynamical\nheterogeneities, two-step relaxation, and structural memory closely akin to 3D\nglass formation in supercooled liquids and colloids. These findings illustrate\nbroad prospective utility of MRPT in advancing the exploration, theory, and\nnumerical models of granular matter.",

Issue localization forms the\nbasis for accurate patch generation. However, because of limitations caused by\nthe context window length of LLMs, existing issue localization methods face\nchallenges in balancing concise yet effective contexts and adequately\ncomprehensive search spaces. In this paper, we introduce CoSIL, an LLM driven,\nsimple yet powerful function level issue localization method without training\nor indexing. CoSIL reduces the search space through module call graphs,\niteratively searches the function call graph to obtain relevant contexts, and\nuses context pruning to control the search direction and manage contexts\neffectively. Importantly, the call graph is dynamically constructed by the LLM\nduring search, eliminating the need for pre-parsing. Experiment results\ndemonstrate that CoSIL achieves a Top-1 localization success rate of 43 percent\nand 44.6 percent on SWE bench Lite and SWE bench Verified, respectively, using\nQwen2.5 Coder 32B, outperforming existing methods by 8.6 to 98.2 percent.

Second, oversimplified metrics\nsuch as simply averaging accuracy per question answering (QA) pair, cannot\nreveal true model capability due to their vulnerability to language variations.\nThird, existing benchmarks isolate the grounding and QA tasks, disregarding the\nunderlying coherence that QA should be based on solid grounding capabilities.\nTo unveil the \"mist\", we propose Beacon3D, a benchmark for 3D-VL grounding and\nQA tasks, delivering a perspective shift in the evaluation of 3D-VL\nunderstanding. Beacon3D features (i) high-quality test data with precise and\nnatural language, (ii) object-centric evaluation with multiple tests per object\nto ensure robustness, and (iii) a novel chain-of-analysis paradigm to address\nlanguage robustness and model performance coherence across grounding and QA.\nOur evaluation of state-of-the-art 3D-VL models on Beacon3D reveals that (i)\nobject-centric evaluation elicits true model performance and particularly weak\ngeneralization in QA; (ii) grounding-QA coherence remains fragile in current\n3D-VL models, and (iii) incorporating large language models (LLMs) to 3D-VL\nmodels, though as a prevalent practice, hinders grounding capabilities and has\nyet to elevate QA capabilities.

    "abstract": "Negations are key to determining sentence meaning, making them essential for\nlogical reasoning. Despite their importance, negations pose a substantial\nchallenge for large language models (LLMs) and remain underexplored.\n  We constructed and published two new textual entailment datasets NoFEVER-ML\nand NoSNLI-ML in four languages (English, Czech, German, and Ukrainian) with\n  examples differing in negation. It allows investigation of the root causes of\nthe negation problem and its exemplification: how popular LLM model properties\nand language impact their inability to handle negation correctly.\n  Contrary to previous work, we show that increasing the model size may improve\nthe models' ability to handle negations. Furthermore, we find that both the\nmodels' reasoning accuracy and robustness to negation are language-dependent\nand that the length and explicitness of the premise have an impact on\nrobustness. There is better accuracy in projective language with fixed order,\nsuch as English, than in non-projective ones, such as German or Czech.\n  Our entailment datasets pave the way to further research for explanation and\nexemplification of the negation problem, minimization of LLM hallucinations,\nand improvement of LLM reasoning in multilingual settings.",

Common to these methods is the\nselection of a privacy budget (i.e., the $\\varepsilon$ parameter), which\ngoverns the degree to which a text is privatized. One major limitation of\nprevious works, stemming directly from the unique structure of language itself,\nis the lack of consideration of $\\textit{where}$ the privacy budget should be\nallocated, as not all aspects of language, and therefore text, are equally\nsensitive or personal. In this work, we are the first to address this\nshortcoming, asking the question of how a given privacy budget can be\nintelligently and sensibly distributed amongst a target document. We construct\nand evaluate a toolkit of linguistics- and NLP-based methods used to allocate a\nprivacy budget to constituent tokens in a text document. In a series of privacy\nand utility experiments, we empirically demonstrate that given the same privacy\nbudget, intelligent distribution leads to higher privacy levels and more\npositive trade-offs than a naive distribution of $\\varepsilon$. Our work\nhighlights the intricacies of text privatization with DP, and furthermore, it\ncalls for further work on finding more efficient ways to maximize the\nprivatization benefits offered by DP in text rewriting.",

To overcome this problem, we propose a channel-independent\nRFF extraction method inspired by the idea of 'fighting fire with fire'.\nSpecifically, we derive the linear differential spectrum and the logarithmic\ndifferential spectrum of the channel frequency responses (CFRs) from the\nreceived signals at different times, and then calculate the ratio of the two\nspectrums. It is found that the division operation effectively counteracts the\nchannel effects, while simultaneously preserving the integrity of the RFFs.

Here, we map the phase diagram of MA$_{1-x}$FA$_x$PbI$_3$ using a\nmachine-learned interatomic potential in molecular dynamics simulations. We\nidentify a morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) at approximately 27% FA content,\ndelineating the transition between out-of-phase and in-phase octahedral tilt\npatterns. Phonon mode projections reveal that this transition coincides with a\nmode crossover composition, where the free energy landscapes of the M and R\nphonon modes become nearly degenerate. This results in nanoscale layered\nstructures with alternating tilt patterns, suggesting minimal interface energy\nbetween competing phases. Our results provide a systematic and consistent\ndescription of this important system, complementing earlier partial and\nsometimes conflicting experimental assessments. Furthermore, density functional\ntheory calculations show that band edge fluctuations peak near the MPB,\nindicating an enhancement of electron-phonon coupling and dynamic disorder\neffects. These findings establish a direct link between phonon dynamics, phase\nbehavior, and electronic structure, providing a further composition-driven\npathway for tailoring the optoelectronic properties of perovskite materials.

When such a scientific workflow needs to\nbe scheduled on a parallel or distributed system, one usually represents the\nworkflow as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). The vertices of the DAG represent\nthe tasks, while its edges model the dependencies between the tasks (data to be\ncommunicated to successor tasks). When executed, each task requires a certain\namount of memory and if it exceeds the available memory, the execution fails.\nThe typical goal is to execute the workflow without failures (satisfying the\nmemory constraints) and with the shortest possible execution time (minimize its\nmakespan). To address this problem, we investigate the memory-aware scheduling\nof DAG-shaped workflows on heterogeneous platforms, where each processor can\nhave a different speed and a different memory size. We propose a variant of\nHEFT (Heterogeneous Earliest Finish Time) that accounts for memory and includes\neviction strategies for cases when it might be beneficial to remove some data\nfrom memory in order to have enough memory to execute other tasks. Furthermore,\nwhile HEFT assumes perfect knowledge of the execution time and memory usage of\neach task, the actual values might differ upon execution. Thus, we propose an\nadaptive scheduling strategy, where a schedule is recomputed when there has\nbeen a significant variation in terms of execution time or memory. The\nscheduler has been integrated with a runtime system, allowing us to perform a\nthorough experimental evaluation on real-world workflows. The runtime system\nwarns the scheduler when the task parameters change, so a schedule is\nrecomputed on the fly. The memory-aware strategy allows us to schedule task\ngraphs that would run out of memory with a state-of-the-art scheduler, and the\nadaptive setting allows us to significantly reduce the makespan.",

Traditional methods\ndepend on specialized equipment such as force plates and sensors, which makes\naccurate assessments both expensive and restricted to laboratory settings. In\nthis paper, we introduce ForcePose, a novel deep learning framework that\nestimates applied forces by combining human pose estimation with object\ndetection. Our approach leverages MediaPipe for skeletal tracking and SSD\nMobileNet for object recognition to create a unified representation of\nhuman-object interaction. We've developed a specialized neural network that\nprocesses both spatial and temporal features to predict force magnitude and\ndirection without needing any physical sensors. After training on our dataset\nof 850 annotated videos with corresponding force measurements, our model\nachieves a mean absolute error of 5.83 N in force magnitude and 7.4 degrees in\nforce direction. When compared to existing computer vision approaches, our\nmethod performs 27.5% better while still offering real-time performance on\nstandard computing hardware. ForcePose opens up new possibilities for force\nanalysis in diverse real-world scenarios where traditional measurement tools\nare impractical or intrusive.

Given that most\npre-training datasets are inaccessible, we leverage the fully open-source OLMo\nseries by indexing its Dolma dataset to estimate entity frequencies.

Our experiments reveal that facts with a\nhigh-frequency subject and a low-frequency object are better recognised than\ntheir inverse, despite their logical equivalence. The pattern reverses in\nlow-to-high frequency settings, and no statistically significant asymmetry\nemerges when both entities are high-frequency.

TIME3D achieves a\n$\\sim 15\\%$ improvement with regard to the standard tail-cut cleaning for $E <\n300$ GeV, with a $\\sim 200\\%$ improvement for the first energy bin (36.5 GeV <\nE < 64.9 GeV), providing a more stable performance across a wider energy range\nby preserving more signal.

We demonstrate that\nusing first-order estimations of the performance of a cleaning, such as image\nsize retaining or NSB pixel reduction, cannot provide a full picture of the\nexpected result in the final sensitivity.

The limited training samples in a single dataset commonly\nresult in fragile robustness in this field. To mitigate knowledge discrepancies\namong different datasets and train a task-agnostic unified face alignment\n(TUFA) framework, this paper presents a strategy to unify knowledge from\nmultiple datasets. Specifically, we calculate a mean face shape for each\ndataset. To explicitly align these mean shapes on an interpretable plane based\non their semantics, each shape is then incorporated with a group of semantic\nalignment embeddings. The 2D coordinates of these aligned shapes can be viewed\nas the anchors of the plane. By encoding them into structure prompts and\nfurther regressing the corresponding facial landmarks using image features, a\nmapping from the plane to the target faces is finally established, which\nunifies the learning target of different datasets. Consequently, multiple\ndatasets can be utilized to boost the generalization ability of the model. The\nsuccessful mitigation of discrepancies also enhances the efficiency of\nknowledge transferring to a novel dataset, significantly boosts the performance\nof few-shot face alignment. Additionally, the interpretable plane endows TUFA\nwith a task-agnostic characteristic, enabling it to locate landmarks unseen\nduring training in a zero-shot manner.

    "abstract": "The Shapley value, originating from cooperative game theory, has been\nemployed to define responsibility measures that quantify the contributions of\ndatabase facts to obtaining a given query answer.

While conceptually simple,\nthis approach suffers from a notable drawback: the problem of computing such\nShapley values is #P-hard in data complexity, even for simple conjunctive\nqueries. This motivates us to revisit the question of what constitutes a\nreasonable responsibility measure and to introduce a new family of\nresponsibility measures -- weighted sums of minimal supports (WSMS) -- which\nsatisfy intuitive properties. Interestingly, while the definition of WSMSs is\nsimple and bears no obvious resemblance to the Shapley value formula, we prove\nthat every WSMS measure can be equivalently seen as the Shapley value of a\nsuitably defined cooperative game. Moreover, WSMS measures enjoy tractable data\ncomplexity for a large class of queries, including all unions of conjunctive\nqueries.

However, existing\nmodels struggle with high-resolution images due to the discrepancy in image\nresolutions of training (with smaller resolutions) and inference (for high\nresolutions). Processing them at full resolution leads to decreased estimation\naccuracy on depth with tremendous memory consumption, while downsampling to the\ntraining resolution results in blurred edges in the estimated depth images.\nPrevailing high-resolution depth estimation methods adopt a patch-based\napproach, which introduces depth discontinuity issues when reassembling the\nestimated depth patches, resulting in test-time inefficiency. Additionally, to\nobtain fine-grained depth details, these methods rely on synthetic datasets due\nto the real-world sparse ground truth depth, leading to poor generalizability.\nTo tackle these limitations, we propose Patch Refine Once (PRO), an efficient\nand generalizable tile-based framework. Our PRO consists of two key components:\n(i) Grouped Patch Consistency Training that enhances test-time efficiency while\nmitigating the depth discontinuity problem by jointly processing four\noverlapping patches and enforcing a consistency loss on their overlapping\nregions within a single backpropagation step, and (ii) Bias Free Masking that\nprevents the DE models from overfitting to dataset-specific biases, enabling\nbetter generalization to real-world datasets even after training on synthetic\ndata. Zero-shot evaluations on Booster, ETH3D, Middlebury 2014, and NuScenes\ndemonstrate that our PRO can be seamlessly integrated into existing depth\nestimation models.",

    "abstract": "Accurate surface reconstruction from unposed images is crucial for efficient\n3D object or scene creation. However, it remains challenging, particularly for\nthe joint camera pose estimation. Previous approaches have achieved impressive\npose-free surface reconstruction results in dense-view settings, but could\neasily fail for sparse-view scenarios without sufficient visual overlap. In\nthis paper, we propose a new technique for pose-free surface reconstruction,\nwhich follows triplane-based signed distance field (SDF) learning but\nregularizes the learning by explicit points sampled from ray-based diffusion of\ncamera pose estimation. Our key contribution is a novel Geometric Consistent\nRay Diffusion model (GCRayDiffusion), where we represent camera poses as neural\nbundle rays and regress the distribution of noisy rays via a diffusion model.\nMore importantly, we further condition the denoising process of RGRayDiffusion\nusing the triplane-based SDF of the entire scene, which provides effective 3D\nconsistent regularization to achieve multi-view consistent camera pose\nestimation. Finally, we incorporate RGRayDiffusion into the triplane-based SDF\nlearning by introducing on-surface geometric regularization from the sampling\npoints of the neural bundle rays, which leads to highly accurate pose-free\nsurface reconstruction results even for sparse-view inputs. Extensive\nevaluations on public datasets show that our GCRayDiffusion achieves more\naccurate camera pose estimation than previous approaches, with geometrically\nmore consistent surface reconstruction results, especially given sparse-view\ninputs.",

Due to the short gravitational timescale for Sgr A*, variable\nemissions near the galactic center are expected in the observations, including\nvariability in the Sgr A* images and flare motions within ten times\ngravitational radius. In this paper, we investigate the spatiotemporal auto-\nand cross-correlations for multiple images of a long-lived corotating hotspot\nnear the black hole. Using the recently developed efficient ray-tracing scheme\nfor point-like sources, we extensively consider multiple images from primary to\neighth-order in the correlations. We show that these correlations exhibit a\nrepeated inclined band-like structure in the $\\Delta \\Phi$-$\\Delta t$ plane.\nAnd there is a periodic modulation of width of the correlated bands, with the\nmaximum bandwidth increasing with the inclination angles. The point-slope of\ncorrelated bands is determined by the lapse in azimuthal angle and time of\nmultiple images, as well as the apparent rotation speed of hotspots. By\ncomparing correlations for lower-order with those for higher-order images, it\nis found that the fixed points for cross-correlations between lower-order\nimages depend on the orbital configurations of hotspots.

We start again from the basic concept that the spring tides\nof the three pairs of the tidally dominant planets Venus, Earth and Jupiter\nexcite magneto-Rossby waves at the solar tachocline. While the quadratic action\nof the sum of these three waves comprises the secondary beat period of 11.07\nyears, the main focus is now on the action of the even more pronounced period\nof 1.723 years. Our dynamo model provides oscillations with exactly that\nperiod, which is also typical for the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO). Most\nremarkable is its agreement with Ground Level Enhancement (GLE) events which\npreferentially occur in the positive phase of an oscillation with a period of\n1.724 years. While bimodality of the sunspot distribution is shown to be a\ngeneral feature of synchronization, it becomes most strongly expressed under\nthe influence of the QBO. This may explain the observation that the solar\nactivity is relatively subdued when compared to that of other sun-like stars.\nWe also discuss anomalies of the solar cycle, and subsequent phase jumps by 180\ndegrees. In this connection it is noted that the very 11.07-year beat period is\nrather sensitive to the time-averaging of the quadratic functional of the waves\nand prone to phase jumps of 90 degrees. On this basis, we propose an\nalternative explanation of the observed 5.5-year phase jumps in algae-related\ndata from the North Atlantic and Lake Holzmaar that were hitherto attributed to\noptimal growth conditions.",

In this work, we propose\nWMCopier, an effective watermark forgery attack that operates without requiring\nany prior knowledge of or access to the target watermarking algorithm.

We also incorporate an\niterative optimization procedure that refines the reconstructed image to\nfurther trade off the fidelity and forgery efficiency. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that WMCopier effectively deceives both open-source and\nclosed-source watermark systems (e.g., Amazon's system), achieving a\nsignificantly higher success rate than existing methods.

    "abstract": "Cosmic birefringence (CB) is the rotation of the photons' linear polarisation\nplane during propagation. Such an effect is a tracer of parity-violating\nextensions of standard electromagnetism and would probe the existence of a new\ncosmological field acting as dark matter or dark energy. It has become\ncustomary to employ cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarised data to probe\nsuch a phenomenon. Recent analyses on Planck and WMAP data provide a hint of\ndetection of the isotropic CB angle with an amplitude of around $0.3^\\circ$ at\nthe level of $2.4$ to $3.6\\sigma$. In this work, we explore the LiteBIRD\ncapabilities in constraining such an effect, accounting for the impact of the\nmore relevant systematic effects, namely foreground emission and instrumental\npolarisation angles. We build five semi-independent pipelines and test these\nagainst four different simulation sets with increasing complexity in terms of\nnon-idealities. All the pipelines are shown to be robust and capable of\nreturning the expected values of the CB angle within statistical fluctuations\nfor all the cases considered. We find that the uncertainties in the CB\nestimates increase with more complex simulations. However, the trend is less\npronounced for pipelines that account for the instrumental polarisation angles.\nFor the most complex case analysed, we find that LiteBIRD will be able to\ndetect a CB angle of $0.3^\\circ$ with a statistical significance ranging from\n$5$ to $13 \\, \\sigma$, depending on the pipeline employed, where the latter\nuncertainty corresponds to a total error budget of the order of $0.02^\\circ$.",

The framework leverages Bayesian statistical inference\nintegrated with Energy Signature (ES) models to characterize thermal\nperformance in buildings. This approach quantifies key parameters such as the\nHeat Loss Coefficient (HLC), solar gain, and wind infiltration, while providing\nfull posterior distributions to reflect parameter uncertainty.\n  Three model variants are developed: a baseline ES model, an auto-regressive\nmodel (ARX-ES) to account for thermal inertia, and an auto-regressive moving\naverage model (ARMAX-ES) that approximates stochastic gray-box dynamics.\nResults show that model complexity improves one-step-ahead predictive\nperformance, with the ARMAX-ES model achieving a median Bayesian R^2 of 0.94\nacross the building stock. At the single-building level, the Bayesian approach\nyields credible intervals for yearly energy demand within $\\pm1\\%$, enabling\nmore robust diagnostics than deterministic methods.\n  Beyond improved accuracy, the Bayesian framework enhances decision-making by\nexplicitly representing uncertainty in building performance parameters. This\nprovides a more realistic foundation for investment prioritization, demand\nforecasting, and long-term energy planning. The method is readily applicable to\nother building typologies or geographies, offering a scalable tool for\ndata-driven energy management under uncertainty.",

    "abstract": "We introduce the open-source Python-based code openKARST for flow in karst\nconduit networks. Flow and transport in complex karst systems remain a\nchallenging area of hydrogeological research due to the heterogeneous nature of\nconduit networks. Flow regimes in these systems are highly dynamic, with\ntransitions from free-surface to fully pressurized and laminar to turbulent\nflow conditions with Reynolds numbers often exceeding one million. These\ntransitions can occur simultaneously within a network, depending on conduit\nroughness properties and diameter distributions. openKARST solves the transient\ndynamic wave equation using an iterative scheme and is optimized with an\nefficient vectorized structure. Transitions from free-surface to pressurized\nflows in smooth and rough circular conduits are realized via a Preissmann slot\napproach in combination with an implementation of the Darcy-Weisbach and\nManning equations to compute friction losses. To mitigate numerical\nfluctuations commonly encountered in the Colebrook-White equation, the dynamic\nswitching from laminar to turbulent flows is modeled with a continuous\nChurchill formulation for the friction factor computation. openKARST supports\ncommon boundary conditions encountered in karst systems, as well as\nfunctionalities for network import, export and visualization. The code is\nverified via comparison against several analytical solutions and validated\nagainst a laboratory experiment. Finally, we demonstrate the application of the\nopenKARST by simulating a synthetic recharge event in one of the largest\nexplored karst networks, the Ox Bel Ha system in Mexico.",

    "abstract": "The nature of the elusive dark matter can be probed by comparing the\npredictions of the cold dark matter framework with the gravitational field of\nmassive galaxy clusters. However, a robust test of dark matter can only be\nachieved if the systematic uncertainties in the reconstruction of the\ngravitational potential are minimized. Techniques based on the properties of\nintracluster gas rely on the assumption that the gas is in hydrostatic\nequilibrium within the potential well, whereas gravitational lensing is\nsensitive to projection effects. Here we attempt to minimize systematics in\ngalaxy cluster mass reconstructions by jointly exploiting the weak\ngravitational lensing signal and the properties of the hot intracluster gas\ndetermined from X-ray and millimeter (Sunyaev-Zel'dovich) observations. We\nconstruct a model to fit the multi-probe information within a common framework,\naccounting for non-thermal pressure support and elongation of the dark matter\nhalo along the line of sight. We then apply our framework to the massive\ncluster Abell 1689, which features unparalleled multi-wavelength data. In\naccordance with previous works, we find that the cluster is significantly\nelongated along the line of sight. Accounting for line-of-sight projections, we\nrequire a non-thermal pressure support of $30\\text{-}40\\%$ at $r_{500}$ to\nmatch the gas and weak lensing observables. The joint model retrieves a\nconcentration $c_{200}\\sim7$, which is lower and more realistic than the high\nconcentration retrieved from weak lensing data alone under the assumption of\nspherical symmetry ($c_{200}\\sim15$). Application of our method to a larger\nsample will allow us to study at the same time the shape of dark matter mass\nprofiles and the level of non-thermal pressure support in galaxy clusters.",

In this paper, we leverage two\ncutting-edge Large Language Models (LLMs) for the coding of democracy\nindicators from the V-Dem project. With access to a huge amount of information,\nthese models may be able to rate the many \"soft\" characteristics of regimes\nwithout the cognitive biases that humans potentially possess. While\nLLM-generated codings largely align with expert coders for many countries, we\nshow that when these models deviate from human assessments, they do so in\ndifferent but consistent ways: Some LLMs are too pessimistic, while others\nconsistently overestimate the democratic quality of these countries. While the\ncombination of the two LLM codings can alleviate this concern, we conclude that\nit is difficult to replace human coders with LLMs, since the extent and\ndirection of these attitudes is not known a priori.",

The class $c(E)$ is not a characteristic class in the classical sense in\nthe sense that it lives in a pointed cohomology torsor $\\operatorname{Ext}^1(L,\n\\operatorname{End}_A(E))$. Most characteristic classes lives in a cohomology\ngroup. The pointed cohomology torsor $\\operatorname{Ext}^1(L,\n\\operatorname{End}_A(E))$ is a torsor on the abelian group\n$\\operatorname{H}^2(L, Z(\\operatorname{End}_A(E)))$ where\n$Z(\\operatorname{End}_A(E))$ is the center of the ring of endomorphisms of $E$\nand where the cohomology is the Lie-Rinehart cohomology of the center. The\nclass $c(E)$ is trivial if and only if $E$ has a flat algebraic connection.\nHence the class $c(T_S)$ where $T_S$ is the tangent bundle, is an an\nobstruction for $S$ to be algebraically parallelizable. I use a connection\n$\\nabla$ to define $c(E)$ and I also prove the class $c(E)$ is independent of\nchoice of connection, hence $c(E)$ is an invariant of the vector bundle $E$.\nThe class generalize the Chern class, the Pontryagin class, the Euler class and\nthe Teleman characteristic class.

High-resolution\nspectroscopy can help, but systematic discrepancies hinder model\ninterpretation. In this study, we evaluate the performance of semi-analytical\nline transfer (SALT) and empirical partial covering models (PCMs) to recover\nthe properties of outflows in the FIRE-2 simulation suite from synthetic Si II\nlines (1190 $\\AA$, 1193 $\\AA$, 1260 $\\AA$, 1304 $\\AA$, 1527 $\\AA$). When\napplicable, we assess each model's ability to recover mass, energy, and\nmomentum outflow rates, as well as radial density and velocity profiles, column\ndensities, and flow geometries. We find that the PCM underestimates column\ndensities by 1.3 dex on average in the range $15 < \\log N\\ [\\text{cm}^{-2}] <\n17$ with dispersion 1.3 dex. We attribute this bias to instrumental smoothing.\nSince the PCM underestimates column densities, it also underestimates flow\nrates, though its predictions are independent of radius, with a dispersion of\n0.55 dex. We detect no bias in the SALT estimates of the column density with\ndispersion 1.3 dex. When the velocity and density field obey power laws, SALT\ncan constrain the mass, momentum, and energy outflow rates to 0.36 (0.63), 0.56\n(0.56), and 0.97 (0.80) dex at $0.15(0.30)R_{\\text{vir}}$, respectively.\nHowever, certain profiles in FIRE-2 fall outside the SALT framework, where the\nmodel breaks down. We find that SALT effectively tracks the flow geometry,\ncapturing the temporal evolution of the photon escape fraction that is out of\nphase with the star formation rate, fully consistent with hydrodynamic\nsimulations.

Both elastic and inelastic reactions are evaluated at leading order\nusing DQPM-based effective propagators and vertices, accounting for all\nchannels and their interferences. Based on the obtained matrix elements, we\ncalculate various observables connected to a charm quark. First, we calculate\nthe total cross section of a charm quark with the medium partons as functions\nof temperature and collision energy. Second, we obtain the drag $\\mathcal{A}$\ncoefficient and $\\hat{q}$ coefficient of a charm quark as functions of\ntemperature and momentum and also compare our results with those obtained using\nthe Zakharov model for the momentum-dependent strong coupling for the elastic\nand radiative vertices with a heavy quark, highlighting the importance of the\nchoice of the strong coupling in the determination of transport coefficients.\nThird, we calculate the spatial diffusion coefficient of a charm quark and\ncompare our results with those obtained using other approaches. Finally, we\nexplore the mass dependence of the diffusion coefficient by comparing the\nresults for charm quark, bottom quark, and infinitely-heavy quark. We found\nthat inelastic processes can play a significant role in the determination of\nthe transport coefficients at large transverse momenta, but are strongly\nsuppressed at low transverse momenta.",

    "abstract": "During the wear process of surfaces in sliding friction, there is a\nrunning-in period during which the topography of surfaces changes with time\nbefore reaching the steady wear regime. In the steady wear regime, the\nstatistical parameters used to describe the topography of the surfaces remain\nalmost constant. Some experimental studies have shown that starting friction\ntests with different surface finish levels leads to the same final topography\nof surfaces in the regime of steady wear. This article proposes an analytical\nmodel to describe the evolution of the topography of surfaces during sliding\nwear. First of all, the Greenwood and Williamson approach is used to describe\nthe contact between nominally flat rough surfaces. The asperities in contact\nmay undergo plastic deformation or adhesion with the opposing surface. Using a\nplasticity criterion and an adhesion criterion, it is possible to obtain a\ndifferential equation for the evolution of the standard deviation of the\nasperities of the surfaces. This equation has an analytical solution that is in\ngood agreement with experimental results from the literature. It is shown that\nthe final surface topography is the result of the competition between abrasive\nwear and adhesive wear. The model is then used to describe different wear\nprocesses from polishing to galling.",

    "abstract": "Observations of the line-of-sight component of emitter velocities in galaxies\nare valuable for reconstructing their 2D velocity fields, albeit requiring\ncertain assumptions. A common one is that radial flows can be neglected in the\nouter regions of galaxies, while their geometry can be deformed by a warp. A\nspecular approach assumes that galactic discs are flat but allows for the\npresence of radial flows. This approach enables the reconstruction of 2D\nvelocity maps that encompass both the transversal and radial velocity fields.\nThrough the study of velocity fields in toy disc models, we find that the\npresence of warps is manifested as a dipolar correlation between the two\nvelocity components obtained by assuming a flat disc. This shows that the\nanalysis of angular velocity anisotropies provides an effective tool for\nbreaking the degeneracy between warps and radial flows. We have applied these\nfindings to the analysis of velocity fields of the galaxies from the THINGS\nsample and M33. Many of these galaxies exhibit such a dipolar correlation,\nindicating the presence of warps. However, we have found that the warp alone\ncannot explain all variations in the velocity field, suggesting that intrinsic\nperturbations are common. Furthermore, we have observed that the spatial\ndistribution of the line-of-sight velocity dispersion may correlate with both\nvelocity components providing independent evidence of non-trivial velocity\nfields. These findings offer a robust approach to reconstructing the velocity\nfields of galaxies, allowing us to distinguish between the presence of warps\nand complex velocity structures assessing their relative amplitude.",

Specifically, we consider the\nreaction diffusion equation as well as Helmholtz problems in waveguides with\nperfectly matched layers. The usual procedure to deal with such problems is to\nfirst consider a modeling error due to the introduction of the artificial\nboundary, and estimate the remaining discretization error with a standard a\nposteriori technique. A shortcoming of this method, however, is that it is\ntypically hard to obtain sharp bounds on the modeling error. In this work, we\npropose a new technique that allows to control the whole error by an a\nposteriori error estimator. Specifically, we propose a flux-equilibrated\nestimator that is slightly modified to handle the truncation boundary. For the\nreaction diffusion equation, we obtain fully-computable guaranteed error\nbounds, and the estimator is locally efficient and polynomial-degree-robust\nprovided that the elements touching the truncation boundary are not too\nrefined. This last condition may be seen as an extension of the notion of\nshape-regularity of the mesh, and does not prevent the design of efficient\nadaptive algorithms. For the Helmholtz problem, as usual, these statements\nremain valid if the mesh is sufficiently refined.

The standard\nnonparametric estimator of this measure is the empirical measure of the\nobserved angles of the $k$ random vectors with largest norm, for a suitably\nchosen number $k$. Due to the curse of dimensionality, for moderate or large\n$d$, this estimator is often inaccurate. If the angular measure is concentrated\non a vicinity of a lower dimensional subspace, then first projecting the data\non a lower dimensional subspace obtained by a principal component analysis of\nthe angles of extreme observations can substantially improve the performance of\nthe estimator.\n  We derive the asymptotic behavior of such PCA projections and the resulting\nexcess risk. In particular, it is shown that, under mild conditions, the excess\nrisk (as a function of $k$) decreases much faster than it was suggested by\nempirical risk bounds obtained in \\cite{DS21}. Moreover, functional limit\ntheorems for local empirical processes of the (empirical) reconstruction error\nof projections uniformly over neighborhoods of the true optimal projection are\nestablished. Based on these asymptotic results, we propose a data-driven method\nto select the dimension of the projection space. Finally, the finite sample\nperformance of resulting estimators is examined in a simulation study.",

Detailed X-ray\ndiffraction measurements demonstrate that the strain occurring in SLs generally\ndecreases with an increase of well/barrier thickness. Fitting of X-ray\ndiffraction curves allowed determining the real thicknesses of the GaN wells\nand AlN barriers. Since blurring of the interfaces causes deviation of\ncalculated data from experimental results the quality of the interfaces has\nbeen evaluated as well and compared with results of TEM measurements. For the\nsamples with thinner wells/barriers the presence of pin-holes and threading\ndislocations has been observed in TEM measurements. The best quality of\ninterfaces has been found for the sample with a well/barrier thickness of 3 nm.\nFinally, PL spectra showed that due to Quantum-Confined Stark Effect the PL\npeak energies of the SLs decreased with increasing the width of the GaN quantum\nwells and AlN barriers.

As entanglement requests arrive, they join\ndedicated queues corresponding to the nodes from which they originate. We\npropose a load-balancing policy wherein the EGS queries nodes for entanglement\nrequests by randomly sampling d of all available request queues and choosing\nthe longest of these to service. This policy is an instance of the well-known\npower-of-d-choices paradigm previously introduced for classical systems such as\ndata-centers. In contrast to previous models, however, we place queues at nodes\ninstead of directly at the EGS, which offers some practical advantages.\nAdditionally, we incorporate a tunable back-off mechanism into our\nload-balancing scheme to reduce the classical communication load in the\nnetwork. To study the policy, we consider a homogeneous star network topology\nthat has the EGS at its center, and model it as a queueing system with requests\nthat arrive according to a Poisson process and whose service times are\nexponentially distributed. We provide an asymptotic analysis of the system by\nderiving a set of differential equations that describe the dynamics of the\nmean-field limit and provide expressions for the corresponding unique\nequilibrium state. Consistent with analogous results from randomized\nload-balancing for classical systems, we observe a significant decrease in the\naverage request processing time when the number of choices d increases from one\nto two during the sampling process, with diminishing returns for a higher\nnumber of choices. We also observe that our mean-field model provides a good\napproximation to study even moderately-sized systems.",

    "abstract": "In the context of fact-checking, claims are often repeated across various\nplatforms and in different languages, which can benefit from a process that\nreduces this redundancy. While retrieving previously fact-checked claims has\nbeen investigated as a solution, the growing number of unverified claims and\nexpanding size of fact-checked databases calls for alternative, more efficient\nsolutions. A promising solution is to group claims that discuss the same\nunderlying facts into clusters to improve claim retrieval and validation.\nHowever, research on claim clustering is hindered by the lack of suitable\ndatasets. To bridge this gap, we introduce \\textit{MultiClaimNet}, a collection\nof three multilingual claim cluster datasets containing claims in 86 languages\nacross diverse topics. Claim clusters are formed automatically from\nclaim-matching pairs with limited manual intervention. We leverage two existing\nclaim-matching datasets to form the smaller datasets within\n\\textit{MultiClaimNet}. To build the larger dataset, we propose and validate an\napproach involving retrieval of approximate nearest neighbors to form candidate\nclaim pairs and an automated annotation of claim similarity using large\nlanguage models. This larger dataset contains 85.3K fact-checked claims written\nin 78 languages. We further conduct extensive experiments using various\nclustering techniques and sentence embedding models to establish baseline\nperformance. Our datasets and findings provide a strong foundation for scalable\nclaim clustering, contributing to efficient fact-checking pipelines.",

The proposed framework also helps to avoid artificial\nerrors in the UWB-anchor position estimation and improves the accuracy and\nrobustness of the robot-pose. The experimental results of the robot\nlocalization using LiDAR and a UWB network in a 3D environment are discussed,\ndemonstrating the performance of the proposed method.

RL has since been extended to more complex\nturbulent flows and has shown significant potential in learning complex control\nstrategies. However, such applications remain computationally challenging due\nto its sample inefficiency and associated simulation costs. This fact is\nworsened by the lack of generalization capabilities of these trained policy\nnetworks, often being implicitly tied to the input configurations of their\ntraining conditions. In this work, we propose the use of graph neural networks\nto address this particular limitation, effectively increasing the range of\napplicability and getting more value out of the upfront RL training cost. GNNs\ncan naturally process unstructured, threedimensional flow data, preserving\nspatial relationships without the constraints of a Cartesian grid.\nAdditionally, they incorporate rotational, reflectional, and permutation\ninvariance into the learned control policies, thus improving generalization and\nthereby removing the shortcomings of commonly used CNN or MLP architectures. To\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, we revisit the well-established\ntwo-dimensional cylinder benchmark problem for active flow control. The RL\ntraining is implemented using Relexi, a high-performance RL framework, with\nflow simulations conducted in parallel using the high-order discontinuous\nGalerkin framework FLEXI.

Significant results are (a)\nprimary bifurcation into a quasistationary periodic instability with its\nvoltage threshold Uc and wave vector qc along the initial director being,\nrespectively, quadratic and linear functions of f over 10-150 kHz, and with an\nazimuthal distortion of the director which changes sign between adjacent\nstripes, (b) transition from the modulated planar state to a homogeneous state\nat higher voltages, and (c) third bifurcation into travelling wave periodic\nstate on further rise in U in the region 10-40 kHz. We interpret these findings\nas follows. The low voltage instability is very similar to that seen in the\nhigher temperature apolar nematic phase, and is the electrohydrodynamic (EHD)\ninstability possibly belonging to the region of dielectric inversion frequency.\nThe azimuthal distortions of n result from an undulatory distortion of the SmZA\nlayers in the book-shelf geometry. The intermediate homogeneous state of SmZA\nin which the periodic structure is absent results from a linear coupling\nbetween the layer polarization P and applied field E, giving rise to a\nscissoring type mutual P reorientation in adjacent layers. Finally, at even\nhigher voltages, the medium goes over to a field induced transition to the\nferroelectric nematic, with the polarization following the AC field, and the\nperiodic EHD instability being similar to that of the dielectric regime. The\npolar vector symmetry of the medium leads in general to travelling waves.",

In the video-to-audio benchmarks, video-to-audio quality, semantic\nalignment, and audio-visual synchronization are effectively achieved. However,\nin real-world scenarios, speech and audio often coexist in videos\nsimultaneously, and the end-to-end generation of synchronous speech and audio\ngiven video and text conditions are not well studied. Therefore, we propose an\nend-to-end multi-modal generation framework that simultaneously produces speech\nand audio based on video and text conditions. Furthermore, the advantages of\nvideo-to-audio (V2A) models for generating speech from videos remain unclear.\nThe proposed framework, DeepAudio, consists of a video-to-audio (V2A) module, a\ntext-to-speech (TTS) module, and a dynamic mixture of modality fusion (MoF)\nmodule. In the evaluation, the proposed end-to-end framework achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on the video-audio benchmark, video-speech\nbenchmark, and text-speech benchmark. In detail, our framework achieves\ncomparable results in the comparison with state-of-the-art models for the\nvideo-audio and text-speech benchmarks, and surpassing state-of-the-art models\nin the video-speech benchmark, with WER 16.57% to 3.15% (+80.99%), SPK-SIM\n78.30% to 89.38% (+14.15%), EMO-SIM 66.24% to 75.56% (+14.07%), MCD 8.59 to\n7.98 (+7.10%), MCD SL 11.05 to 9.40 (+14.93%) across a variety of dubbing\nsettings.",

    "abstract": "Typically, for analysing and modelling social phenomena, networks are a\nconvenient framework that allows for the representation of the\ninterconnectivity of individuals. These networks are often considered\ntransmission structures for processes that happen in society, e.g. diffusion of\ninformation, epidemics, and spread of influence. However, constructing a\nnetwork can be challenging, as one needs to choose its type and parameters\naccurately. As a result, the outcomes of analysing dynamic processes often\nheavily depend on whether this step was done correctly. In this work, we\nadvocate that it might be more beneficial to step down from the tedious process\nof building a network and base it on the level of the interactions instead. By\ntaking this perspective, we can be closer to reality, and from the cognitive\nperspective, human beings are directly exposed to events, not networks.\nHowever, we can also draw a parallel to stream data mining, which brings a\nvaluable apparatus for stream processing. Apart from taking the interaction\nstream perspective as a typical way in which we should study social phenomena,\nthis work advocates that it is possible to map the concepts embodied in human\nnature and cognitive processes to the ones that occur in interaction streams.\nExploiting this mapping can help reduce the diversity of problems that one can\nfind in data stream processing for machine learning problems. Finally, we\ndemonstrate one of the use cases in which the interaction stream perspective\ncan be applied, namely, the social learning process.",

    "abstract": "The increasing emphasis on privacy and data security has driven the adoption\nof federated learning, a decentralized approach to train machine learning\nmodels without sharing raw data. Prompt learning, which fine-tunes prompt\nembeddings of pretrained models, offers significant advantages in federated\nsettings by reducing computational costs and communication overheads while\nleveraging the strong performance and generalization capabilities of\nvision-language models such as CLIP. This paper addresses the intersection of\nfederated learning and prompt learning, particularly for vision-language\nmodels. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive framework, named FLIP, to\nevaluate federated prompt learning algorithms. FLIP assesses the performance of\n8 state-of-the-art federated prompt learning methods across 4 federated\nlearning protocols and 12 open datasets, considering 6 distinct evaluation\nscenarios. Our findings demonstrate that prompt learning maintains strong\ngeneralization performance in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution\nsettings with minimal resource consumption. This work highlights the\neffectiveness of federated prompt learning in environments characterized by\ndata scarcity, unseen classes, and cross-domain distributional shifts.

Recent works introduce\npretrained Diffusion Models (DMs) into this task. However, due to the scarcity\nof large-scale training data and comprehensive benchmarks, the optimal\nmethodologies for employing DMs in stereo conversion and the accurate\nevaluation of stereo effects remain largely unexplored. In this work, we\nintroduce the Mono2Stereo dataset, providing high-quality training data and\nbenchmark to support in-depth exploration of stereo conversion. With this\ndataset, we conduct an empirical study that yields two primary findings. 1) The\ndifferences between the left and right views are subtle, yet existing metrics\nconsider overall pixels, failing to concentrate on regions critical to stereo\neffects. 2) Mainstream methods adopt either one-stage left-to-right generation\nor warp-and-inpaint pipeline, facing challenges of degraded stereo effect and\nimage distortion respectively. Based on these findings, we introduce a new\nevaluation metric, Stereo Intersection-over-Union, which prioritizes disparity\nand achieves a high correlation with human judgments on stereo effect.\nMoreover, we propose a strong baseline model, harmonizing the stereo effect and\nimage quality simultaneously, and notably surpassing current mainstream\nmethods. Our code and data will be open-sourced to promote further research in\nstereo conversion. Our models are available at mono2stereo-bench.github.io.",

    "abstract": "We report the results obtained with a XMM-Newton observation, performed in\nApril 2023, of the poorly known Galactic Be X-ray binary pulsar 4U 0728-25. It\nwas revealed at a flux level (not corrected for the absorption) $f_{\\rm\nX}$(0.2-12 keV) = 1.7$\\times 10^{-11}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, which implies an\nunabsorbed source luminosity $L_{\\rm X} \\simeq 1.3 \\times 10^{35}$ erg\ns$^{-1}$: this is the minimum luminosity ever observed for this source. We\nmeasured a pulse period $P_{\\rm spin}$ = 103.301(5) s, a value $\\simeq $ 0.15 %\nlonger than that estimated in 2016 with AstroSat. The pulse profile shows a\nbroad single peak at all energies, with a limited energy dependence and a small\nincrease in the pulsed fraction with energy. The time-averaged EPIC spectrum\ncan be described equally well by four different emission models, either with a\nsingle non-thermal component (a partially covered power law or a cut-off power\nlaw), or with a thermal component in addition to the non-thermal one (a black\nbody plus a power law, or a collisionally ionised gas plus a cut-off power\nlaw). All of them provided an equally good fit and, in the case of the\npower-law plus black-body model, the thermal component is characterized by a\nhigh temperature ($kT_{\\rm BB} \\simeq$ 1.5 keV) and a small size ($R_{\\rm BB}\n\\simeq$ 240 m), comparable with that of the neutron-star polar caps. A spectral\nvariability along the pulse phase is present, which suggests a flux variation\nof the black-body component. These results show that, for its luminosity level,\nflux variabilty over long time scales, and spectral properties, 4U 0728-25 is\nvery similar to most of the persistent Be X-ray binaries. Therefore, it can be\nconsidered a member of this class of sources.",

Graph models allow us to capture the hidden dependencies of the\nmultivariate time-series when the graphs are constructed in a similar dynamic\nmanner. Previous dynamic graph models require a pre-defined and/or static graph\nstructure, which is unknown in most cases, or they only capture the spatial\nrelations between the features. Furthermore in healthcare, the interpretability\nof the model is an essential requirement to build trust with clinicians. In\naddition to previously proposed attention mechanisms, there has not been an\ninterpretable dynamic graph framework for data from multivariate electronic\nhealth records (EHRs). Here, we propose DynaGraph, an end-to-end interpretable\ncontrastive graph model that learns the dynamics of multivariate time-series\nEHRs as part of optimisation. We validate our model in four real-world clinical\ndatasets, ranging from primary care to secondary care settings with broad\ndemographics, in challenging settings where tasks are imbalanced and\nmulti-labelled. Compared to state-of-the-art models, DynaGraph achieves\nsignificant improvements in balanced accuracy and sensitivity over the nearest\ncomplex competitors in time-series or dynamic graph modelling across three ICU\nand one primary care datasets.

Existing applications, however, are\nmostly restricted to cases where the domain is time-invariant. The present work\nextends the application of graph neural network-based modeling to fluid flow\naround structures rotating with respect to a certain axis. Specifically, we\npropose to apply a graph neural network-based surrogate modeling for fluid flow\nwith the mesh corotating with the structure. Unlike conventional data-driven\napproaches that rely on structured Cartesian meshes, our framework operates on\nunstructured co-rotating meshes, enforcing rotation equivariance of the learned\nmodel by leveraging co-rotating polar (2D) and cylindrical (3D) coordinate\nsystems. To model the pressure for systems without Dirichlet pressure\nboundaries, we propose a novel local directed pressure difference formulation\nthat is invariant to the reference pressure point and value. For flow systems\nwith large mesh sizes, we introduce a scheme to train the network in single or\ndistributed graphics processing units by accumulating the backpropagated\ngradients from partitions of the mesh. The effectiveness of our proposed\nframework is examined on two test cases: (i) fluid flow in a 2D rotating mixer,\nand (ii) the flow past a 3D rotating cube. Our results show that the model\nachieves stable and accurate rollouts for over 2000 time steps in periodic\nregimes while capturing accurate short-term dynamics in chaotic flow regimes.\nIn addition, the drag and lift force predictions closely match the CFD\ncalculations, highlighting the potential of the framework for modeling both\nperiodic and chaotic fluid flow around rotating structures.",

Leveraging\nadvanced prompt engineering, including behavioral prompts, author's notes, and\nstubbornness mechanisms, we developed virtual patients (VPs) that embody\nnuanced emotional and conversational traits. Medical professionals evaluated\nthese VPs, rating their authenticity (accuser: $3.8 \\pm 1.0$; rationalizer:\n$3.7 \\pm 0.8$ on a 5-point Likert scale (from one to five)) and correctly\nidentifying their styles. Emotion analysis revealed distinct profiles: the\naccuser exhibited pain, anger, and distress, while the rationalizer displayed\ncontemplation and calmness, aligning with predefined, detailed patient\ndescription including medical history. Sentiment scores (on a scale from zero\nto nine) further validated these differences in the communication styles, with\nthe accuser adopting negative ($3.1 \\pm 0.6$) and the rationalizer more neutral\n($4.0 \\pm 0.4$) tone. These results underscore LLMs' capability to replicate\ncomplex communication styles, offering transformative potential for medical\neducation.

Achieving high performance in whole-body control remains a\nchallenge for RL methods that rely solely on task rewards. In this paper, we\npropose a Foundation model-based method for humanoid Locomotion And\nManipulation (FLAM for short). FLAM integrates a stabilizing reward function\nwith a basic policy. The stabilizing reward function is designed to encourage\nthe robot to learn stable postures, thereby accelerating the learning process\nand facilitating task completion. Specifically, the robot pose is first mapped\nto the 3D virtual human model. Then, the human pose is stabilized and\nreconstructed through a human motion reconstruction model. Finally, the pose\nbefore and after reconstruction is used to compute the stabilizing reward. By\ncombining this stabilizing reward with the task reward, FLAM effectively guides\npolicy learning. Experimental results on a humanoid robot benchmark demonstrate\nthat FLAM outperforms state-of-the-art RL methods, highlighting its\neffectiveness in improving stability and overall performance.",

It has recently drawn research interest for accommodating varying\nuser preferences. Recent approaches primarily use CLIP embeddings with proxy\nlearning to extract representations biased toward user clustering preferences.\nHowever, CLIP primarily focuses on coarse image-text alignment, lacking a deep\ncontextual understanding of user interests. To overcome these limitations, we\npropose an agent-centric personalized clustering framework that leverages\nmulti-modal large language models (MLLMs) as agents to comprehensively traverse\na relational graph to search for clusters based on user interests. Due to the\nadvanced reasoning mechanism of MLLMs, the obtained clusters align more closely\nwith user-defined criteria than those obtained from CLIP-based representations.\nTo reduce computational overhead, we shorten the agents' traversal path by\nconstructing a relational graph using user-interest-biased embeddings extracted\nby MLLMs. A large number of weakly connected edges can be filtered out based on\nembedding similarity, facilitating an efficient traversal search for agents.\nExperimental results show that the proposed method achieves NMI scores of\n0.9667 and 0.9481 on the Card Order and Card Suits benchmarks, respectively,\nlargely improving the SOTA model by over 140%.",

Our approach\nleverages the heuristics that verifiers producing correct results typically\nimplement certain appropriate algorithms, and the supported algorithms by these\nverifiers indirectly reflect which ones are potentially applicable.\nSpecifically, MFH embeds the code property graph (CPG) of a semantic-preserving\ntransformed program to enhance the robustness of the prediction model.\nFurthermore, our approach decomposes the selection task into the sub-tasks of\npredicting potentially applicable algorithms and matching the most appropriate\nverifiers. Additionally, MFH also introduces a feedback loop on incorrect\npredictions to improve model prediction accuracy. We evaluate MFH on 20\nverifiers and over 15,000 verification tasks. Experimental results demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of MFH, achieving a prediction accuracy of 91.47% even\nwithout ground truth algorithm labels provided during the training phase.\nMoreover, the prediction accuracy decreases only by 0.84% when introducing 10\nnew verifiers, indicating the strong scalability of the proposed approach.",

It utilizes techniques such as parallel\nexecuted operations, well-defined layout patterns of cipher data, kernel\nfusion/segmentation, and dual GPU pools to enhance the overall execution\nefficiency. In addition, a memory management mechanism ensures server-side\nsuitability and prevents data leakage.\n  Based on our framework, we implement three widely used FHE schemes: CKKS,\nBFV, and BGV.

What's\nmore, we offer a scenario validation with CKKS-based Privacy Database Queries,\nachieving a 33$\\times$ speedup over its CPU counterpart. All query tasks can\nhandle datasets up to $10^3$ rows on a single GPU within 1 second, using 2-5 GB\nstorage.\n  Our implementation has undergone extensive stability testing and can be\neasily deployed on commercial GPUs.

However, they often face challenges with temporal\nconsistency, particularly in the talking head domain, where continuous changes\nin facial expressions intensify the level of difficulty. These issues stem from\nthe independent editing of individual images and the inherent loss of temporal\ncontinuity during the editing process. In this paper, we introduce Follow Your\nMotion (FYM), a generic framework for maintaining temporal consistency in\nportrait editing. Specifically, given portrait images rendered by a pre-trained\n3D Gaussian Splatting model, we first develop a diffusion model that\nintuitively and inherently learns motion trajectory changes at different scales\nand pixel coordinates, from the first frame to each subsequent frame. This\napproach ensures that temporally inconsistent edited avatars inherit the motion\ninformation from the rendered avatars. Secondly, to maintain fine-grained\nexpression temporal consistency in talking head editing, we propose a dynamic\nre-weighted attention mechanism. This mechanism assigns higher weight\ncoefficients to landmark points in space and dynamically updates these weights\nbased on landmark loss, achieving more consistent and refined facial\nexpressions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms\nexisting approaches in terms of temporal consistency and can be used to\noptimize and compensate for temporally inconsistent outputs in a range of\napplications, such as text-driven editing, relighting, and various other\napplications.",

Traditional denoising\ntechniques primarily rely on parameter selection strategies, which are\ninsufficient for processing field data in noisy environments. With the advent\nof deep learning, various neural networks have been employed for SATEM signal\ndenoising. However, existing deep learning methods typically use single-mapping\nlearning approaches that struggle to effectively separate signal from noise.\nThese methods capture only partial information and lack interpretability.

To address the limitations of CNN and Transformer\narchitectures, we utilize the RWKV architecture for data processing and\nintroduce the Contextual-WKV mechanism, which allows unidirectional WKV to\nperform bidirectional signal modeling. Our proposed Covering Embedding\ntechnique retains the strong local perception of convolutional networks through\nstacked embedding.

In order to avoid a need for a manual identification of the appropriate\nanalytical forms - hindering past attempts at its parametrization - we take\nadvantage of the versatile machine learning techniques.

The accurate depth estimation\nfacilitates multi-image consistency for intrinsic image decomposition by\naligning different view coordinate systems, while the decomposition process\nidentifies reflective areas and excludes corrupted gradients from the depth\ntraining process. Furthermore, our framework introduces a pseudo-depth\ngeneration and knowledge distillation technique to further enhance the\nperformance of the student model across both reflective and non-reflective\nsurfaces.

Unlike instance-specific\nadversarial examples, UAPs present a greater challenge as they must generalize\nacross different samples and models. Generating UAPs typically requires access\nto numerous examples, which is a strong assumption in real-world tasks. In this\npaper, we propose a novel data-free method called Intrinsic UAP (IntriUAP), by\nexploiting the intrinsic vulnerabilities of deep models. We analyze a series of\npopular deep models composed of linear and nonlinear layers with a Lipschitz\nconstant of 1, revealing that the vulnerability of these models is\npredominantly influenced by their linear components. Based on this observation,\nwe leverage the ill-conditioned nature of the linear components by aligning the\nUAP with the right singular vectors corresponding to the maximum singular value\nof each linear layer. Remarkably, our method achieves highly competitive\nperformance in attacking popular image classification deep models without using\nany image samples. We also evaluate the black-box attack performance of our\nmethod, showing that it matches the state-of-the-art baseline for data-free\nmethods on models that conform to our theoretical framework. Beyond the\ndata-free assumption, IntriUAP also operates under a weaker assumption, where\nthe adversary only can access a few of the victim model's layers. Experiments\ndemonstrate that the attack success rate decreases by only 4% when the\nadversary has access to just 50% of the linear layers in the victim model.",

One challenge for the HWP\nsystem in the SAT-LF is the large 35 kg load on the SMB due to the thicker HWP\nthan in previous telescopes.

Unlike traditional task-specific AI solutions, these new AI\nmodels are developed through two stages: 1) self-supervised pre-training on a\nlarge amount of unlabeled data to learn intrinsic circuit properties; and 2)\nefficient fine-tuning for specific downstream applications, such as early-stage\ndesign quality evaluation, circuit-related context generation, and functional\nverification. This new paradigm brings many advantages: model generalization,\nless reliance on labeled circuit data, efficient adaptation to new tasks, and\nunprecedented generative capability. In this paper, we propose referring to AI\nmodels developed with this new paradigm as circuit foundation models (CFMs).\nThis paper provides a comprehensive survey of the latest progress in circuit\nfoundation models, unprecedentedly covering over 130 relevant works. Over 90%\nof our introduced works were published in or after 2022, indicating that this\nemerging research trend has attracted wide attention in a short period.

For our\nintroduced works, we cover their input modalities, model architecture,\npre-training strategies, domain adaptation techniques, and downstream design\napplications.

While gradient-ascent-based optimization is a natural choice for\nreward-based guidance, it struggles to maintain image realism.

    "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks and supervised learning have achieved\nremarkable success in various fields but are limited by the need for large\nannotated datasets. Few-shot learning (FSL) addresses this limitation by\nenabling models to generalize from only a few labeled examples. Transductive\nfew-shot learning (TFSL) enhances FSL by leveraging both labeled and unlabeled\ndata, though it faces challenges like the hubness problem. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose the Unbiased Max-Min Embedding Classification (UMMEC)\nMethod, which addresses the key challenges in few-shot learning through three\ninnovative contributions. First, we introduce a decentralized covariance matrix\nto mitigate the hubness problem, ensuring a more uniform distribution of\nembeddings. Second, our method combines local alignment and global uniformity\nthrough adaptive weighting and nonlinear transformation, balancing intra-class\nclustering with inter-class separation. Third, we employ a Variational Sinkhorn\nFew-Shot Classifier to optimize the distances between samples and class\nprototypes, enhancing classification accuracy and robustness. These combined\ninnovations allow the UMMEC method to achieve superior performance with minimal\nlabeled data. Our UMMEC method significantly improves classification\nperformance with minimal labeled data, advancing the state-of-the-art in TFSL.",

The presented framework is aimed to\nsubstantially utilize the advantages of each model which would allow for\nachieving the identification of both linear and non-linear relations in stock\nprice movements. To improve the accuracy of its predictions it uses rich set of\ntechnical indicators and it scales its predictors based on the current market\nsituation. By trying out the framework on several stock data sets, and\nbenchmarking the results against single models and conventional forecasting,\nthe ensemble method exhibits consistently high accuracy and reliability. The\nVAE is able to learn linear representation on high-dimensional data while the\nTransformer outstandingly perform in recognizing long-term patterns on the\nstock price data. LSTM, based on its characteristics of being a model that can\ndeal with sequences, brings additional improvements to the given framework,\nespecially regarding temporal dynamics and fluctuations. Combined, these\ncomponents provide exceptional directional performance and a very small\ndisparity in the predicted results. The present solution has given a probable\nconcept that can handle the inherent problem of stock price prediction with\nhigh reliability and scalability. Compared to the performance of individual\nproposals based on the neural network, as well as classical methods, the\nproposed ensemble framework demonstrates the advantages of combining different\narchitectures.

Typical measures to contain the rapid spread usually include\neffective vaccination and strict interventions (Nature Human Behaviour, 2021).\nMotivated by such circumstances, we study the problem of limiting the spread of\na disease over a social network system.\n  In their seminal work (KDD 2003), Kempe, Kleinberg, and Tardos introduced two\nfundamental diffusion models, the linear threshold and independent cascade, for\nthe influence maximization problem. In this work, we adopt these models in the\ncontext of disease spreading and study effective vaccination mechanisms. Our\nbroad goal is to limit the spread of a disease in human networks using only a\nlimited number of vaccines. However, unlike the influence maximization problem,\nwhich typically does not require spatial awareness, disease spreading occurs in\nspatially structured population networks. Thus, standard Erdos-Renyi graphs do\nnot adequately capture such networks. To address this, we study networks\nmodeled as generalized random geometric graphs, introduced in the seminal work\nof Waxman (IEEE J. Sel. Areas Commun. 1988).\n  We show that for disease spreading, the optimization function is neither\nsubmodular nor supermodular, in contrast to influence maximization, where the\nfunction is submodular. Despite this intractability, we develop novel\nalgorithms leveraging local search and greedy techniques, which perform\nexceptionally well in practice. We compare them against an exact ILP-based\napproach to further demonstrate their robustness. Moreover, we introduce an\niterative rounding mechanism for the relaxed LP formulation.

This behavior is in sharp contrast to\npreviously reported results in HfO2, where both the longitudinal and transverse\npiezoelectric coefficients are negative. These unusual positive transverse\npiezoelectric coefficients originate from the domination of the positive\ninternal-strain contribution.

However, constrained by the weak interaction between the\nquantum nodes, the implementations of QB networks exhibit limited charging\nperformance. In this work, we propose an efficient approach to improving\ncharging in multi-battery systems by capitalizing on nonreciprocity. By\nconstructing non-Hermitian Aharonov-Bohm triangles to establish unidirectional\nenergy transfer in both cascaded and parallel configurations, we can achieve a\nsignificant enhancement of the stored energy in QBs especially in the weak\ninteraction regime. Remarkably, the nonreciprocal cascaded setups display an\nexponentially increasing gain in the battery energy as the charging distance\nlengthens compared to the reciprocal counterparts. Furthermore, we demonstrate\nthat nonreciprocity can also lead to the same enhancement in the charging power\nof QBs, accelerating the charging processes. Our findings provide a practical\npathway for enhancing the charging performance of QBs and exhibit the\npotentials for constructing efficient QB networks.",

From this we obtain a lower bound\nfor the growth of the volume of geodesic balls, if the manifold is also assumed\nto be K\\\"ahler. Our primary applications concern the spectrum of the Laplacian.\nWe use the strictly convex function which we construct to show that the\nspectrum of the Laplacian is absolutely continuous on a class of asymptotically\nharmonic manifolds. In fact, we completely determine the spectrum of the\nLaplacian on simply connected noncompact nonflat harmonic manifolds without\nfocal points. For asymptotically harmonic manifolds we also show that equality\nholds in Cheeger's inequality for the bottom of the spectrum, where Cheeger's\nconstant is equal to the constant mean curvature of the horospheres.

Collective flow is one of\nthe most important observables in heavy-ion collision experiments to study the\nbulk behavior of the created matter. Even though the standard event plane\nmethod has been widely used for collective flow measurements, it remains\ncrucial to validate and optimize this method for the CEE spectrometer. In this\npaper, we study the experimental procedures of measuring directed flow in\n$^{238}$U+$^{238}$U collisions at 500 MeV/$u$ using event planes reconstructed\nby Multi Wire Drift Chamber and Zero Degree Calorimeter, respectively. Jet AA\nMicroscopic (JAM) transport generator is used to generate events, and the\ndetector response is simulated by the CEE Fast Simulation (CFS) package.\nFinally, the optimal kinetic region for proton directed flow measurements is\ndiscussed for the future CEE experiment.",

Intelligent detection of bleeding areas can\nquantify the blood loss to assist decision-making, while locating bleeding\npoints helps surgeons quickly identify the source of bleeding and achieve\nhemostasis in time to improve surgical success rates. In this study, we first\nconstruct a real-world laparoscopic surgical bleeding detection dataset, named\nSurgBlood, comprising 5,330 frames from 95 surgical video clips with bleeding\nregion and point annotations. Accordingly, we develop a dual-task synergistic\nonline detector called BlooDet, designed to perform simultaneous detection of\nbleeding regions and points in laparoscopic surgery. Our framework embraces a\ndual-branch bidirectional guidance design based on Segment Anything Model 2\n(SAM 2). The mask branch detects bleeding regions through adaptive edge and\npoint prompt embeddings, and the point branch leverages mask memory to induce\nbleeding point memory modeling and capture the direction of bleed point\nmovement via inter-frame optical flow. By bidirectional guidance, the two\nbranches explore potential spatial-temporal relationships while leveraging\nmemory modeling to infer the current bleeding condition.

Thus, we propose T-CIL, a novel temperature scaling approach for\nclass-incremental learning without a validation set for old tasks, that\nleverages adversarially perturbed exemplars from memory. Directly using\nexemplars is inadequate for temperature optimization, since they are already\nused for training. The key idea of T-CIL is to perturb exemplars more strongly\nfor old tasks than for the new task by adjusting the perturbation direction\nbased on feature distance, with the single magnitude determined using the\nnew-task validation set. This strategy makes the perturbation magnitude\ncomputed from the new task also applicable to old tasks, leveraging the\ntendency that the accuracy of old tasks is lower than that of the new task.

    "abstract": "In this work, we investigate possible supersymmetric extensions of the\nCarrollian algebra and the Carrollian conformal algebra in both $d=4$ and\n$d=3$. For the super-Carrollian algebra in $d=4$, we identify multiple\nadmissible structures, depending on the representations of the supercharges\nwith respect to the Carrollian rotation. Some of these structures can be\nderived by taking the speed of light $c\\to 0$ limit from super-Poincar\\'e\nalgebra, but others are completely novel. In the conformal case, we demonstrate\nthat the nontrivial Carrollian superconformal algebras for $d=4$ and $d=3$ are\nisomorphic to super-Poincar\\'e algebra of $d=5$ and $d=4$ respectively.\nRemarkably, neither of these constructions requires R-symmetry to ensure the\nalgebraic closure. Furthermore, we discover two distinct classes of\nsuper-BMS$_4$ algebras, i.e. one singlet super-BMS$_4$ algebra and two\nmultiplet chiral super-BMS$_4$ algebras. The singlet case arises from extending\nthe $3$D Carrollian superconformal algebra, whereas the multiplet cases do not\nadmit this pathology due to their finite-dimensional subalgebra containing\nsupercharges with conformal dimension $\\Delta=\\pm\\frac{3}{2}$.",

    "abstract": "Novel-view synthesis (NVS) for dynamic scenes from 2D images presents\nsignificant challenges due to the spatial complexity and temporal variability\nof such scenes. Recently, inspired by the remarkable success of NVS using 3D\nGaussian Splatting (3DGS), researchers have sought to extend 3D Gaussian models\nto four dimensions (4D) for dynamic novel-view synthesis. However, methods\nbased on 4D rotation and scaling introduce spatiotemporal deformation into the\n4D covariance matrix, necessitating the slicing of 4D Gaussians into 3D\nGaussians. This process increases redundant computations as timestamps\nchange-an inherent characteristic of dynamic scene rendering. Additionally,\nperforming calculations on a four-dimensional matrix is computationally\nintensive. In this paper, we introduce Disentangled 4D Gaussian Splatting\n(Disentangled4DGS), a novel representation and rendering approach that\ndisentangles temporal and spatial deformations, thereby eliminating the\nreliance on 4D matrix computations. We extend the 3DGS rendering process to 4D,\nenabling the projection of temporal and spatial deformations into dynamic 2D\nGaussians in ray space. Consequently, our method facilitates faster dynamic\nscene synthesis. Moreover, it reduces storage requirements by at least 4.5\\%\ndue to our efficient presentation method. Our approach achieves an\nunprecedented average rendering speed of 343 FPS at a resolution of\n$1352\\times1014$ on an RTX 3090 GPU, with experiments across multiple\nbenchmarks demonstrating its competitive performance in both monocular and\nmulti-view scenarios.",

The third study\npresents a quantum plasmonic sensing method, using conditional detection to\nboost signal-to-noise ratio and improve phase estimation. The final study\nextends this approach to quantum imaging with natural light: by isolating\nmultiphoton correlations from thermal light via photon-number-resolving\ndetection and a single-pixel protocol, we enhance image contrast under noisy\nconditions.

Representing\npatient anatomy and associated motion fields as 3D Gaussians, we developed a\nGaussian representation-based framework (PMF-STGR) for fast and accurate\ndynamic CBCT reconstruction. PMF-STGR comprises three major components: a dense\nset of 3D Gaussians to reconstruct a reference-frame CBCT for the dynamic\nsequence; another 3D Gaussian set to capture three-level, coarse-to-fine\nmotion-basis-components (MBCs) to model the intra-scan motion; and a CNN-based\nmotion encoder to solve projection-specific temporal coefficients for the MBCs.\nScaled by the temporal coefficients, the learned MBCs will combine into\ndeformation vector fields to deform the reference CBCT into\nprojection-specific, time-resolved CBCTs to capture the dynamic motion. Due to\nthe strong representation power of 3D Gaussians, PMF-STGR can reconstruct\ndynamic CBCTs in a 'one-shot' training fashion from a standard 3D CBCT scan,\nwithout using any prior anatomical or motion model. We evaluated PMF-STGR using\nXCAT phantom simulations and real patient scans.

Our analysis reveals\nthe most critical weaknesses that pose significant threats to developers and\ntheir projects as they look to streamline their development tasks through code\nreuse. We show risky weaknesses, those unique to Maven, and emphasize those\nbecoming increasingly dangerous over time. Furthermore, we reveal how\nvulnerabilities subtly propagate, impacting 31.39% of the 635,003 latest\nreleases through direct dependencies and 62.89% through transitive\ndependencies. Our findings suggest that improper handling of input and\nmismanagement of resources pose the most risk. Additionally, Insufficient\nsession-ID length in J2EE configuration and no throttling while allocating\nresources uniquely threaten the Maven ecosystem. We also find that weaknesses\nrelated to improper authentication and managing sensitive data without\nencryption have quickly gained prominence in recent years.

However, microbiome engineering\nfaces several challenges including successful establishment of the organism\ninto the community, its persistence in the microbiome to serve a specified\npurpose, and constraint of the organism and its activity to the intended\nenvironment. A theoretical framework is needed to represent the complex\ninteractions that drive these dynamics. Building on the concept of the\ncommunity functional landscape, we define the persistence landscape as the\nmetabolic, genetic, and broader functional composition and ecological context\nof the target microbiome that can be used to predict the environmental fitness\nof an introduced organism. Here, we discuss critical aspects of persistence\nlandscapes that impact interactions between an introduced organism and the\ntarget microbiome, including the communitys genetic and metabolic\ncomplementation potential, cellular defense strategies, spatial and temporal\ndynamics, and the introduced organisms ability to compete for resources to\nsurvive. Finally, we highlight important knowledge gaps in the fields of\nmicrobial ecology and microbiome engineering that limit characterization and\nengineering of persistence landscapes. As a model for understanding microbiome\nstructure and interaction in the context of microbiome engineering, the\npersistence landscape model should enable development of novel containment\napproaches while improving controlled colonization of a complex microbiome\ncommunity to address pressing challenges in human health, agronomy, and\nbiomanufacturing.",

    "abstract": "This study proposes a novel framework for long-term electricity demand\nprediction based solely on historical consumption data, without relying on\nexternal variables such as temperature or economic indicators. The method\ncombines Non-negative Tensor Factorization (NTF) to extract low-dimensional\ntemporal features from multi-way electricity usage data, with a Genetic\nAlgorithm that optimizes the hyperparameters of time series models applied to\nthe latent annual factors. We model the dataset as a third-order tensor\nspanning electric utilities, industrial sectors, and years, and apply canonical\npolyadic decomposition under non-negativity constraints. The annual component\nis forecasted using autoregressive models, with hyperparameter tuning guided by\nthe prediction error or reconstruction accuracy on a validation set.\nComparative experiments using real-world electricity data from Japan\ndemonstrate that the proposed method achieves lower mean squared error than\nbaseline approaches without tensor decomposition or evolutionary optimization.\nMoreover, we find that reducing the model's degrees of freedom via tensor\ndecomposition improves generalization performance, and that initialization\nsensitivity in NTF can be mitigated through multiple runs or ensemble\nstrategies. These findings suggest that the proposed framework offers an\ninterpretable, flexible, and scalable approach to long-term electricity demand\nprediction and can be extended to other structured time series forecasting\ntasks.",

Newton-PIPG integrates the Proportional-Integral Projected\nGradient (PIPG) method with the Newton method, thereby achieving both global\nconvergence and local quadratic convergence. The PIPG method, an\noperator-splitting algorithm, seeks a fixed point of the PIPG operator. Under\nmild assumptions, we demonstrate that this operator is locally smooth, enabling\nthe application of the Newton method to solve the corresponding nonlinear\nfixed-point equation. Furthermore, we prove that the linear system associated\nwith the Newton method is locally nonsingular under strict complementarity\nconditions. To enhance efficiency, we design a specialized matrix factorization\ntechnique that leverages the typical sparsity of optimal control problems in\nsuch systems. Numerical experiments demonstrate that Newton-PIPG achieves high\naccuracy and reduces computation time, particularly when feasibility is easily\nguaranteed.",

    "abstract": "JWST reveals numerous high-z galaxies and Supermassive Black Holes (SMBHs),\nsuggesting that stars and SMBH seeds formation at $z \\gtrsim 10$ may be more\nefficient than previously derived. One popular SMBH seed scenario is the Direct\nCollapse Black Holes (DCBHs) formed in pristine atomic-cooling halos irradiated\nby nearby galaxies. Therefore, the efficient star formation likely facilitates\nthe formation of DCBH. We calculate the first critical $k_{\\rm H_2}-k_{\\rm\nH^-}$ curves for DCBH formation under the influence of X-ray radiation using\nthe one-zone model. We then build the UV luminosity function consistent with\nJWST observations and incorporate it into the model that calculates the\nDCBH-triggering probability. We confirm that enhanced star formation promotes\nthe DCBH formation. However, the DCBH abundance $n_{\\rm DCBH}$ is significantly\ninfluenced by the X-ray radiation that is also related to star formation. Since\nthe 21 cm global spectrum is also X-ray dependent, the 21 cm absorption depth\n$\\delta T_b^{\\rm trough}$ at Cosmic Dawn encodes the DCBH abundance\ninformation. We provide a tentative trend in the $n_{\\rm DCBH}$ - $\\delta\nT^{\\rm trough}_{\\rm b}$ relation, which could be a useful guide. In our\nfiducial model, if $\\delta T_b^{\\rm trough}\\gtrsim -100$ mK, then the DCBH is\nrather rare; if $-150~{\\rm mK} \\lesssim \\delta T_b^{\\rm trough}\\lesssim -100$\nmK, $ n_{\\rm DCBH} \\sim \\mathcal{O}(10^{-2}-10^{-3})$ cMpc$^{-3}$ (comoving\n$\\rm Mpc^{-3}$), consistent with the HST/JWST observed SMBHs abundance at\n$z\\gtrsim 6$; if $\\delta T_b^{\\rm trough}\\lesssim -150$ mK, $n_{\\rm DCBH}$ can\nlargely exceed $\\mathcal{O}(10^{-2})$ cMpc$^{-3}$.

The general approach requires a time domain model of the\ncomponent, and is most applicable where a conversion to the frequency domain is\nimpractical prior to linearisation. The outcome is a Norton equivalent current\nsource, which expresses linear coupling between harmonic frequencies with\nadmittance matrices. These are the so-called frequency coupling matrices. The\ngeneral approach is demonstrated for magnetic hysteresis, where a Preisach\nmodel has been developed for this purpose. A new data driven approach is used\nto fit the test results of a small physical transformer to the Preisach model.\nResults show an improved accuracy in the frequency coupling matrices over\nmodels that only considered magnetic saturation. Maximum improvement is\nobserved in the odd harmonic current to odd harmonic voltage couplings.",

For\nthe first time, we show that the population balance equation in steady state\ncan be interpreted within the Lifshitz-Slezov-Wagner theory when the\ndistribution function is redefined as the density distribution of the\nbuoyancy-induced flux. Notably, in this form of Ostwald ripening, the\ndistribution function approaches a scaled universal distribution, not over\ntime, but as a function of height. We analytically derive the scaled universal\ndistribution and show that the fifth power of the mean radius of the bubbles\ngrows linearly with height.",

Many LPVs in the Large\nMagellanic Cloud (LMC) and Galactic Bulge (BLG) have been continuously observed\nover a time span of 26 years by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment\n(OGLE) survey. Using OGLE-IV data, we applied Gaussian Processes with kernels\ntailored for solar-like oscillations to extract two global asteroseismic\nparameters: the frequency of maximum power (numax) and the large frequency\nseparation (Dnu), for LPVs with primary mode periods (P1) between 10 and 100\ndays in the LMC and BLG. We found that the numax-Dnu relation for LPVs in this\nwork aligns with that of lower-luminosity Kepler red giants, confirming that\nthe pulsations of these LPVs are likely solar-like. We found that numax and Dnu\ncan serve as luminosity indicators. Compared to P1, numax and Dnu exhibit\nsignificantly tighter correlations with the absolute magnitude in the 2MASS K_s\nband (M_{K}), with corresponding scatter of 0.27 mag and 0.21 mag,\nrespectively. Using the calibrated numax-mk and Dnu-mk relations for LPVs in\nthe LMC, we determined the M_{K} values for individual stars in the BLG. By\naccounting for extinction, we further calculated the distances to 4,948 BLG\nstars. The peak of the resulting distance distribution corresponds to an\nestimated distance to the Galactic center of approximately 9.1 kpc, which\nappears to be overestimated, suggesting that the seismic luminosity relation\ncalibrated from the LMC may not be directly applicable to BLG stars.",

In this paper, the strong-phase differences are determined in a\nmodel-independent way with quantum-correlated $D^0$-$\\bar{D}^0$ decays from\n7.93 fb$^{-1}$ of $e^+e^-$ annihilation data at $\\sqrt{s}$=3.773 GeV by the\nBESIII experiment. These results are the most precise to date and are expected\nto significantly reduce associated uncertainties in determining the $C\\!P$\nviolating angle $\\gamma$ and related charm mixing parameters.",

    "abstract": "Automated construction is one of the most promising areas that can improve\nefficiency, reduce costs and minimize errors in the process of building\nconstruction. In this paper, a comparative analysis of three neural network\nmodels for semantic segmentation, U-Net(light), LinkNet and PSPNet, is\nperformed. Two specialized datasets with images of houses built from wooden\ncubes were created for the experiments. The first dataset contains 4 classes\n(background, foundation, walls, roof ) and is designed for basic model\nevaluation, while the second dataset includes 44 classes where each cube is\nlabeled as a separate object. The models were trained with the same\nhyperparameters and their accuracy was evaluated using MeanIoU and F1 Score\nmetrics. According to the results obtained, U-Net(light) showed the best\nperformance with 78% MeanIoU and 87% F1 Score on the first dataset and 17% and\n25% respectively on the second dataset. The poor results on the second dataset\nare due to the limited amount of data, the complexity of the partitioning and\nthe imbalance of classes, making it difficult to accurately select individual\ncubes. In addition, overtraining was observed in all experiments, manifested by\nhigh accuracy on the training dataset and its significant decrease on the\nvalidation dataset. The present work is the basis for the development of\nalgorithms for automatic generation of staged building plans, which can be\nfurther scaled to design complete buildings. Future research is planned to\nextend the datasets and apply methods to combat overfitting (L1/L2\nregularization, Early Stopping). The next stage of work will be the development\nof algorithms for automatic generation of a step-by-step plan for building\nhouses from cubes using manipulators.

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been advancing rapidly and with the advent\nof large language models (LLMs) in late 2022, numerous opportunities have\nemerged for adopting this technology across various domains, including\nmedicine. These innovations hold immense potential to revolutionize and\nmodernize medical education. Our research project leverages large language\nmodels to enhance medical education and address workflow challenges through the\ndevelopment of MediTools - AI Medical Education.

In contrast to the approaches\nbased on mixed-integer optimization models in existing works, our approach\nfocuses on the minimum separation times between aircraft by introducing some\nnecessary assumptions and new concepts including relevance, breakpoint\naircraft, path and class-monotonically-decreasing sequence. Four scheduling\nproblems are discussed including landing scheduling problem, takeoff scheduling\nproblem, and mixed landing and takeoff scheduling problems on a same runway and\non dual runways with the consideration of conversions between different\naircraft sequences in typical scenarios. Two real-time optimal algorithms are\nproposed for the four scheduling problems by fully exploiting the combinations\nof different classes of aircraft, and necessary definitions, lemmas and\ntheorems are presented for the optimal convergence of the algorithms. Numerical\nexamples are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. In\nparticular, when 100 aircraft are considered, by using the algorithm in this\npaper, the optimal solution can be obtained in less than 5 seconds, while by\nusing the CPLEX software to solve the mix-integer optimization model, the\noptimal solution cannot be obtained within 1 hour.",

    "abstract": "Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in\nrobotic planning, particularly for long-horizon tasks that require a holistic\nunderstanding of the environment for task decomposition. Existing methods\ntypically rely on prior environmental knowledge or carefully designed\ntask-specific prompts, making them struggle with dynamic scene changes or\nunexpected task conditions, e.g., a robot attempting to put a carrot in the\nmicrowave but finds the door was closed. Such challenges underscore two\ncritical issues: adaptability and efficiency. To address them, in this work, we\npropose an adaptive multi-agent planning framework, termed REMAC, that enables\nefficient, scene-agnostic multi-robot long-horizon task planning and execution\nthrough continuous reflection and self-evolution. REMAC incorporates two key\nmodules: a self-reflection module performing pre-condition and post-condition\nchecks in the loop to evaluate progress and refine plans, and a self-evolvement\nmodule dynamically adapting plans based on scene-specific reasoning. It offers\nseveral appealing benefits: 1) Robots can initially explore and reason about\nthe environment without complex prompt design. 2) Robots can keep reflecting on\npotential planning errors and adapting the plan based on task-specific\ninsights. 3) After iterations, a robot can call another one to coordinate tasks\nin parallel, maximizing the task execution efficiency. To validate REMAC's\neffectiveness, we build a multi-agent environment for long-horizon robot\nmanipulation and navigation based on RoboCasa, featuring 4 task categories with\n27 task styles and 50+ different objects. Based on it, we further benchmark\nstate-of-the-art reasoning models, including DeepSeek-R1, o3-mini, QwQ, and\nGrok3, demonstrating REMAC's superiority by boosting average success rates by\n40% and execution efficiency by 52.7% over the single robot baseline.",

Beyond traditional face swapping and\nreenactment, an emerging trend in recent state-of-the-art deepfake generation\nmethods involves localized edits such as subtle manipulations of specific\nfacial features like raising eyebrows, altering eye shapes, or modifying mouth\nexpressions. These fine-grained manipulations pose a significant challenge for\nexisting detection models, which struggle to capture such localized variations.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first detection approach\nexplicitly designed to generalize to localized edits in deepfake videos by\nleveraging spatiotemporal representations guided by facial action units.

    "abstract": "Driving cycles are a set of driving conditions and are crucial for the\nexisting emission estimation model to evaluate vehicle performance, fuel\nefficiency, and emissions, by matching them with average speed to calculate the\noperating modes, such as braking, idling, and cruising. While existing emission\nestimation models, such as the Motor Vehicle Emission Simulator (MOVES), are\npowerful tools, their reliance on predefined driving cycles can be limiting, as\nthese cycles often do not accurately represent regional driving conditions,\nmaking the models less effective for city-wide analyses. To solve this problem,\nthis paper proposes a modular neural network (NN)-based framework to estimate\noperating mode distributions bypassing the driving cycle development phase,\nutilizing macroscopic variables such as speed, flow, and link infrastructure\nattributes. The proposed method is validated using a well-calibrated\nmicrosimulation model of Brookline MA, the United States. The results indicate\nthat the proposed framework outperforms the operating mode distribution\ncalculated by MOVES based on default driving cycles, providing a closer match\nto the actual operating mode distribution derived from trajectory data.\nSpecifically, the proposed model achieves an average RMSE of 0.04 in predicting\noperating mode distribution, compared to 0.08 for MOVES. The average error in\nemission estimation across pollutants is 8.57% for the proposed method, lower\nthan the 32.86% error for MOVES. In particular, for the estimation of CO2, the\nproposed method has an error of just 4%, compared to 35% for MOVES. The\nproposed model can be utilized for real-time emissions monitoring by providing\nrapid and accurate emissions estimates with easily accessible inputs.",

Now let us suppose one of these companies invests\nin new scientific tools that make it unusually good at critical progression\ndecisions, while the other company does not. How do we assess the difference in\nvalue between the two programs? Surprisingly, standard discounted cash flow\nvaluation methods, such as risk-adjusted net present value (rNPV), ubiquitous\nin drug industry portfolio management and venture capital, are largely useless\nin this case. They fail to value the decisions that make drug candidates more\nor less valuable because rNPV conflates wrong decisions to progress bad\ncandidates with right decisions to progress good ones. The purpose of this\npaper is to set out a new class of valuation model that logically links the\nvalue of therapeutic assets with the value of \"decisions tools\" that are used\nto design, optimize, and test those assets. Our model makes clear the\ninteraction between asset value and decision tool value. It also makes clear\nthe downstream consequences of better, or worse, upstream decisions.

Here, based on the concept of critical slowing down, AMOC stability\ndecline that can be interpreted as a warning signal of AMOC tipping is\nidentified in the eastern SPNA in both observations and ESMs. This warning\nsignal is in accordance with a physical indicator of AMOC stability,\nAMOC-induced freshwater convergence into the Atlantic basin. The observed\nsignal can be reconciled with the modeled one only under warming exceeding the\nParis Agreement goal, suggesting that AMOC stability is overestimated in ESMs.\nOur results suggest that the observed AMOC may indeed be losing stability and\ncould thus reach a tipping point much earlier than state-of-the-art ESMs\nsuggest.",

Dense stellar systems like globular\nclusters (GCs) or nuclear star clusters offer unique laboratories for studying\nthe existence and impact of IMBHs. IMBHs residing in GCs have been under\nspeculation for decades, with their broad astrophysical implications for the\ncluster's dynamical evolution, stellar population, GW signatures, among others.\nWhile existing GW observatories such as the Advanced Laser Interferometer\nGravitational-wave Observatory (aLIGO) target binaries with relatively modest\nmass ratios, $q \\lesssim 10$, future observatories such as the Einstein\nTelescope (ET) and the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will detect\nintermediate-mass ratio inspirals (IMRIs) with $q > 10$.

Most standard schemes assume no knowledge of the underlying\ndevice noise and rely on general-purpose quantum error-correcting (QEC) codes\ncapable of handling arbitrary errors. Biased-noise alternatives focus on only\ncorrecting a subset of some generic error basis (e.g., Pauli error basis), and\nlower resource needs by channeling the redundancy to dealing only with that\nsubset. Yet, the most resource-efficient codes are expected to be those that\ndirectly target the specific noise process that afflicts the quantum device,\nrather than using a generic error-basis description.

While CLAP addresses general audio-language tasks, its audio\nfeatures do not generalize well in audio tasks. In contrast, self-supervised\nlearning (SSL) models learn general-purpose audio features that perform well in\ndiverse audio tasks. We pursue representation learning that can be widely used\nin audio applications and hypothesize that a method that learns both general\naudio features and CLAP features should achieve our goal, which we call a\ngeneral-purpose audio-language representation. To implement our hypothesis, we\npropose M2D2, a second-generation masked modeling duo (M2D) that combines an\nSSL M2D and CLAP. M2D2 learns two types of features using two modalities (audio\nand text) in a two-stage training process.

In the\nfirst stage, M2D2 learns generalizable audio features from M2D and CLAP, where\nCLAP aligns the features with the fine LLM-based semantic embeddings. In the\nsecond stage, it learns CLAP features using the audio features learned from the\nLLM-based embeddings.

As a result, most existing research\nrelies on heuristics and trial-and-error methods or focuses on the independent\ndesign of stimuli or structures under static conditions. We propose a topology\noptimization framework for magnetic soft robots that simultaneously designs\nstructures, location-specific material magnetization and time-varying magnetic\nstimuli, accounting for large deformations, dynamic motion, and solid contacts.\nThis is achieved by integrating generalized topology optimization with the\nmagneto-elastic material point method, which supports GPU-accelerated parallel\nsimulations and auto-differentiation for sensitivity analysis.

We demonstrate that a multi-photon exchange during\nnuclear orbiting is responsible for an atomic excitation. Furthermore,\nproximity of the projectile and target nucleus during the nuclear orbiting\nmodifies the effective charge of the projectile.

Building on the close relationship\nbetween the unraveled Lindblad dynamics, stochastic Magnus integrators, and\nvariational quantum simulation, we propose a high-order scheme for solving the\nquantum state diffusion equation using exponential integrators. This\nformulation facilitates the simulation of wavefunction trajectories within the\nestablished framework of variational quantum algorithms for time evolution. Our\nalgorithm significantly enhances robustness in two key aspects: the stability\nof the simulation with large time steps, and the reduction in the number of\nquantum trajectories required to accurately simulate the Lindblad dynamics in\nterms of the ensemble average. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nalgorithm through numerical examples in both classical and quantum\nimplementations, including the transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) with\ndamping, the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex, and the radical pair model\n(RPM). The simulation accuracy can be systematically improved, and the\nalgorithm remains reliable even in highly oscillatory regimes. These methods\nare expected to be applicable to a broader class of open quantum systems beyond\nthe specific models considered in this study.",

However, acquiring high-quality\nlabeled nodes in text-attributed graphs (TAGs) is challenging and costly due to\ntheir complex textual and structural characteristics. Large language models\n(LLMs), known for their powerful zero-shot capabilities in textual tasks, show\npromise but struggle to naturally capture the critical structural information\ninherent to TAGs, limiting their direct effectiveness.\n  To address these challenges, we propose LLM-GOOD, a general framework that\neffectively combines the strengths of LLMs and GNNs to enhance data efficiency\nin graph OOD detection. Specifically, we first leverage LLMs' strong zero-shot\ncapabilities to filter out likely OOD nodes, significantly reducing the human\nannotation burden. To minimize the usage and cost of the LLM, we employ it only\nto annotate a small subset of unlabeled nodes. We then train a lightweight GNN\nfilter using these noisy labels, enabling efficient predictions of ID status\nfor all other unlabeled nodes by leveraging both textual and structural\ninformation. After obtaining node embeddings from the GNN filter, we can apply\ninformativeness-based methods to select the most valuable nodes for precise\nhuman annotation. Finally, we train the target ID classifier using these\naccurately annotated ID nodes. Extensive experiments on four real-world TAG\ndatasets demonstrate that LLM-GOOD significantly reduces human annotation costs\nand outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of both ID classification\naccuracy and OOD detection performance.",

The corresponding non-interacting 1D\nlattice model is known to have single-particle localization with mobility\nedges. Using exact diagonalization, we find that the MBL of this model has\nsimilar features to the conventional MBL of extensively studied random or\nquasiperiodic (QP) models, including the transitions of eigenstate entanglement\nentropy (EE) and level statistics, and the logarithmic growth of EE. To further\ninvestigate the universal properties of this MBL transition in the asymptotic\nregime, we implement a real-space renormalization group (RG) method. RG\nanalysis shows a subvolume scaling $\\sim L^{d_{\\rm MBL}}$ with $d_{\\rm MBL}\n\\approx 1-s$ of the localization length (length of the largest thermal\nclusters) in this MBL phase. In addition, we explore the critical properties\nand find universal scalings of the EE and localization length. From these\nquantities, we compute the critical exponent $\\nu$ using different parameters\n$s$ (characterizing different degrees of spatial variation of the imposed\npotential), finding the critical exponent staying around $\\nu\\approx2$. This\nexponent $\\nu \\approx 2$ is close to that of the QP model within the error bars\nbut differs from the random model.

This study thus seeks to determine what files consume the\nmost space in users' storage, and from this, to propose an automated method to\nselect candidate files for removal.

    "abstract": "Recent breakthroughs in single-cell technology have ushered in unparalleled\nopportunities to decode the molecular intricacy of intricate biological\nsystems, especially those linked to diseases unique to humans. However, these\nprogressions have also ushered in novel obstacles-specifically, the efficient\nannotation of extensive, long-tailed single-cell data pertaining to disease\nconditions. To effectively surmount this challenge, we introduce Celler, a\nstate-of-the-art generative pre-training model crafted specifically for the\nannotation of single-cell data. Celler incorporates two groundbreaking\nelements: First, we introduced the Gaussian Inflation (GInf) Loss function. By\ndynamically adjusting sample weights, GInf Loss significantly enhances the\nmodel's ability to learn from rare categories while reducing the risk of\noverfitting for common categories. Secondly, we introduce an innovative Hard\nData Mining (HDM) strategy into the training process, specifically targeting\nthe challenging-to-learn minority data samples, which significantly improved\nthe model's predictive accuracy. Additionally, to further advance research in\nthis field, we have constructed a large-scale single-cell dataset: Celler-75,\nwhich encompasses 40 million cells distributed across 80 human tissues and 75\nspecific diseases. This dataset provides critical support for comprehensively\nexploring the potential of single-cell technology in disease research.

Building on recent work by von Davier (2025), we\npropose an adjusted estimator that corrects this bias by modifying both the\nnumerator and denominator of the traditional formula. The new approximation\nincorporates a weighted average of component degrees of freedom and a scaling\nfactor that ensures consistency as the number of components or their degrees of\nfreedom increases. We demonstrate the utility of this adjustment in practical\nsettings, including Rubin's (1987) total variance estimation in multiple\nimputations, where weighted variance combinations are common.

Our density-functional theory calculations reveal that the\nsemimetallic nature of trigonal PtBi$_2$ can be interpreted as stemming from a\nnoncentrosymmetric crystal distortion of a parent structure, that drives a\nmetal to semimetal transition. This distortion breaks inversion symmetry and,\ncrucially, reduces translational symmetry. Due to its interplay with\ntranslational symmetry, inversion-symmetry breaking emerges as the dominant\nenergy scale producing substantial asymmetries ($\\sim$ 0.6\\,eV) in certain\nshort-range hopping amplitudes, superseding the effects of SOC, whose primary\nrole is to define the characteristics of the low-energy nodal structure.

In the compression stage, we decompose the LLM's weight matrices\ninto local low-rank \"rank blocks\" and arrange these blocks in a Penrose-like\nnon-periodic tiling pattern. Each block is then compacted via spectral\ntransformations (e.g., discrete cosine or Fourier transforms), and a\nKullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-based alignment loss preserves the\ndistributional similarity between the compressed model's representations and\nthose of the original full model.

We consider the\nnonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger-Poisson-Boltzmann system under a quasi-neutral\nscaling and establish the convergence of its solutions to the isothermal Euler\nequations. Different from the previous results that dealt with the linear\nPoisson equations, the system under our consideration accounts for the\nexponential nonlinearity in the potential. A modulated energy method is\nadopted, allowing us to derive the stability estimates and asymptotics.\nFurthermore, we focus our analysis on the many-body quantum problem via the von\nNeumann equation and establish a mean-field limit in one dimension by using\nSerfaty's functional inequalities, and thus connecting the quantum many-body\ndynamics with the macroscopic hydrodynamic equations. A refined analysis of the\nquasi-neutral scaling for the massless systems is presented, and the\nwell-posedness of the underlying quantum dynamics is established. Moreover, the\nconstruction of general admissible initial data is obtained. Our results\nprovide a rigorous mathematical analysis for the derivation of quantum\nhydrodynamic models and their limits, contributing to the broader understanding\nof interactions between quantum mechanics and compressible fluid dynamics.",

This study\ndevelops and validates a deep learning-based diagnostic model for PH, designed\nto classify patients as non-PH, pre-capillary PH, or post-capillary PH. This\nretrospective study analyzed data from 204 patients (112 with pre-capillary PH,\n32 with post-capillary PH, and 60 non-PH controls) at the First Affiliated\nHospital of Nanjing Medical University. Diagnoses were confirmed through right\nheart catheterization. We selected 6 samples from each category for the test\nset (18 samples, 10%), with the remaining 186 samples used for the training\nset. This process was repeated 35 times for testing. This paper proposes a deep\nlearning model that combines Graph convolutional networks (GCN), Convolutional\nneural networks (CNN), and Transformers. The model was developed to process\nmultimodal data, including short-axis (SAX) sequences, four-chamber (4CH)\nsequences, and clinical parameters.

    "abstract": "Unsupervised representation learning has been widely explored across various\nmodalities, including neural architectures, where it plays a key role in\ndownstream applications like Neural Architecture Search (NAS). These methods\ntypically learn an unsupervised representation space before generating/\nsampling architectures for the downstream search. A common approach involves\nthe use of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to map discrete architectures onto a\ncontinuous representation space, however, sampling from these spaces often\nleads to a high percentage of invalid or duplicate neural architectures. This\ncould be due to the unnatural mapping of inherently discrete architectural\nspace onto a continuous space, which emphasizes the need for a robust discrete\nrepresentation of these architectures. To address this, we introduce a Vector\nQuantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to learn a discrete latent space\nmore naturally aligned with the discrete neural architectures. In contrast to\nVAEs, VQ-VAEs (i) map each architecture into a discrete code sequence and (ii)\nallow the prior to be learned by any generative model rather than assuming a\nnormal distribution. We then represent these architecture latent codes as\nnumerical sequences and train a text-to-text model leveraging a Large Language\nModel to learn and generate sequences representing architectures. We experiment\nour method with Inception/ ResNet-like cell-based search spaces, namely\nNAS-Bench-101 and NAS-Bench-201. Compared to VAE-based methods, our approach\nimproves the generation of valid and unique architectures by over 80% on\nNASBench-101 and over 8% on NASBench-201.

Our scheme supports QKD in a 545-dimensional Hilbert space-the highest\nreported for spatial encoding-achieving 5.07 bits per coincidence in an\noptimized 90-mode configuration. This work demonstrates a scalable route to\nhigh-dimensional, spatially encoded quantum communication.",

    "abstract": "To achieve digital intelligence transformation and carbon neutrality,\neffective production planning is crucial for integrated refinery-petrochemical\ncomplexes. Modern refinery planning relies on advanced optimization techniques,\nwhose development requires reproducible benchmark problems. However, existing\nbenchmarks lack practical context or impose oversimplified assumptions,\nlimiting their applicability to enterprise-wide optimization. To bridge the\nsubstantial gap between theoretical research and industrial applications, this\npaper introduces the first open-source, demand-driven benchmark for\nindustrial-scale refinery-petrochemical complexes with transparent model\nformulations and comprehensive input parameters. The benchmark incorporates a\nnovel port-stream hybrid superstructure for modular modeling and broad\ngeneralizability. Key secondary processing units are represented using the\ndelta-base approach grounded in historical data. Three real-world cases have\nbeen constructed to encompass distinct scenario characteristics, respectively\naddressing (1) a stand-alone refinery without integer variables, (2) chemical\nsite integration with inventory-related integer variables, and (3) multi-period\nplanning. All model parameters are fully accessible. Additionally, this paper\nprovides an analysis of computational performance, ablation experiments on\ndelta-base modeling, and application scenarios for the proposed benchmark.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates the autoresonant acceleration of electrons using the\nGYRAC mechanism in a cylindrical cavity excited in the TE$_{011}$ microwave\nmode, under a slowly increasing external magnetic field. The acceleration\nprocess is driven by the interaction between electrons and the right-hand\ncircularly polarized (RHP) component of the electric field, maintained in phase\nthrough electron cyclotron resonance (ECR). A simplified single-particle model\nand numerical simulations based on the relativistic Newton-Lorentz equation\nwere employed to evaluate particle dynamics under different values of the\nmagnetic field growth parameter $ \\alpha $.\n  The results demonstrate that efficient trapping and energy transfer can be\nachieved for appropriate values of $ \\alpha $, and that the spatial\nnon-uniformity of the TE$_{011}$ mode introduces critical sensitivity to\ninitial particle positioning. The study further identifies a ring-shaped region\nin which electrons are consistently captured in the GYRAC regime, and shows how\nthe evolution of the Larmor radius, phase shift, and energy distribution\ndepends on the electromagnetic configuration.\n  Simulations involving disk-like and ring-like electron clouds reveal the\nfraction of captured, escaped, and uncaptured particles, confirming that\nprecise control of the magnetic field variation is essential to optimize the\nefficiency of the acceleration process. These findings provide a basis for\nfuture self-consistent plasma simulations and support the development of\ncompact radiation sources based on GYRAC-TE$_{011}$ acceleration.",

    "abstract": "As a fundamental task in computer vision, semantic segmentation is widely\napplied in fields such as autonomous driving, remote sensing image analysis,\nand medical image processing. In recent years, Transformer-based segmentation\nmethods have demonstrated strong performance in global feature modeling.\nHowever, they still struggle with blurred target boundaries and insufficient\nrecognition of small targets. To address these issues, this study proposes a\nMask2Former-based semantic segmentation algorithm incorporating a boundary\nenhancement feature bridging module (BEFBM). The goal is to improve target\nboundary accuracy and segmentation consistency. Built upon the Mask2Former\nframework, this method constructs a boundary-aware feature map and introduces a\nfeature bridging mechanism. This enables effective cross-scale feature fusion,\nenhancing the model's ability to focus on target boundaries. Experiments on the\nCityscapes dataset demonstrate that, compared to mainstream segmentation\nmethods, the proposed approach achieves significant improvements in metrics\nsuch as mIOU, mDICE, and mRecall. It also exhibits superior boundary retention\nin complex scenes. Visual analysis further confirms the model's advantages in\nfine-grained regions. Future research will focus on optimizing computational\nefficiency and exploring its potential in other high-precision segmentation\ntasks.",
