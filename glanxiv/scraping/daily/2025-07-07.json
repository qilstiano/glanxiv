    "abstract": "Current studies of non-reciprocal superconducting (SC) transport have\ncentered on the forward-backward asymmetry of the critical current measured\nalong a single axis. In most realizations, this diode effect is achieved via\nintroducing ferromagnetism or applying an external magnetic field, which drives\nsystem into an effective Fulde-Ferrell (FF) state but often at the cost of\nseverely suppressing the SC gap and thus compromising device robustness. Here\nwe propose and theoretically demonstrate that coupling a conventional $s$-wave\nSC thin film to a $d$-wave altermagnet offers a more resilient alternative. The\nmomentum-dependent spin splitting inherent to altermagnets induces a\nnon-collinear SC-diode effect in the BCS state, with the critical-current\nanisotropy exhibiting a fourfold ($C_4$) symmetry. Upon entering the FF state\nat large splitting, this anisotropy gradually evolves into a unidirectional\n($C_1$) pattern. Crucially, the FF pairing momentum locks to the discrete\ncrystal axes, eliminating the rotational Goldstone mode and preserving a\nsizable SC gap without any abrupt or significant suppression. These combined\nfeatures make the altermagnetic proximity an appealing platform to engineer\nsymmetry-protected, energy-efficient and programmable SC diodes for\nnext-generation electronic devices.",

This paper addresses\nthe Top-k Representative Similar Subtrajectory Query (TRSSQ) problem, which\naims to find the k most representative subtrajectories similar to a query.\nExisting methods rely on costly filtering-validation frameworks, resulting in\nslow response times. Addressing this, we propose GTRSS, a novel Graph-based\nTop-k Representative Similar Subtrajectory Query framework. During the offline\nphase, GTRSS builds a dual-layer graph index that clusters trajectories\ncontaining similar representative subtrajectories. In the online phase, it\nefficiently retrieves results by navigating the graph toward query-relevant\nclusters, bypassing full-dataset scanning and heavy computation. To support\nthis, we introduce the Data Trajectory Similarity Metric (DTSM) to measure the\nmost similar subtrajectory pair. We further combine R-tree and grid filtering\nwith DTSM pruning rules to speed up index building. To the best of our\nknowledge, GTRSS is the first graph-based solution for top-k subtrajectory\nsearch. Experiments on real datasets demonstrate that GTRSS significantly\nenhances both efficiency and accuracy, achieving a retrieval accuracy of over\n90 percent and up to two orders of magnitude speedup in query performance.",

    "abstract": "Wastewater surveillance has emerged as a critical public health tool,\nenabling early detection of infectious disease outbreaks and providing timely,\npopulation-level insights into community health trends. However, variability in\nsample collection and processing, for example between wastewater influent and\nsettled solids, can introduce methodological noise that differentially impacts\ntrue epidemiological signals and limits cross-site comparability. To address\nthis challenge, we aimed to discern underlying disease trends from\nmethodological variability in SARS-CoV-2 wastewater data using discrete wavelet\ntransform (DWT), with a focus on comparing influent and solids samples from the\nsame geographic locations. We applied DWT to longitudinal SARS-CoV-2 RNA\nconcentrations in wastewater from five California cities, each with paired\ninfluent and solids samples. DWT decomposes each signal into two components:\n(1) approximation coefficients that capture smoothed long-term trends, and (2)\ndetail coefficients that isolate high-frequency fluctuations and transient\nvariations in the signal. We reconstructed signals by progressively removing\nthe high-frequency components and assessed similarity between sample types\nusing hierarchical clustering. Clustering of raw signals did not yield\ncity-specific groupings, indicating that methodological noise obscured the\nunderlying epidemiological signal. Intermediate reconstructions that retained\nsome high-frequency components continued to show mixed groupings. In contrast,\nreconstructions based solely on low-frequency approximation coefficients\nrevealed clear, city-specific clustering, with influent and solids samples from\nthe same city aligning closely. These findings support our hypothesis that\nhigh-frequency components are primarily driven by sample processing and\nlaboratory noise, while low-frequency components reflect shared epidemiological\ntrends.",

A plethora of hardware accelerators has been\nintroduced to meet the performance demands of GNNs in real-world applications.\nHowever, security challenges of hardware-based attacks have been generally\noverlooked. In this paper, we investigate the vulnerability of GNN models to\nhardware-based fault attack, wherein an attacker attempts to misclassify output\nby modifying trained weight parameters through fault injection in a memory\ndevice. Thus, we propose Gradual Bit-Flip Fault Attack (GBFA), a layer-aware\nbit-flip fault attack, selecting a vulnerable bit in each selected weight\ngradually to compromise the GNN's performance by flipping a minimal number of\nbits. To achieve this, GBFA operates in two steps. First, a Markov model is\ncreated to predict the execution sequence of layers based on features extracted\nfrom memory access patterns, enabling the launch of the attack within a\nspecific layer. Subsequently, GBFA identifies vulnerable bits within the\nselected weights using gradient ranking through an in-layer search. We evaluate\nthe effectiveness of the proposed GBFA attack on various GNN models for node\nclassification tasks using the Cora and PubMed datasets. Our findings show that\nGBFA significantly degrades prediction accuracy, and the variation in its\nimpact across different layers highlights the importance of adopting a\nlayer-aware attack strategy in GNNs.

We introduce a dataset of 114,296 teacher-learner\nconversations grounded in 14,287 tutorials across 17 domains and 727 topics.\nOur evaluation protocol combines computational and rubric-based metrics with\nhuman judgment alignment. Results demonstrate the workflow's effectiveness in\ndiverse setups, offering insights into LLM capabilities across domains. Our\ndatasets and implementations are fully open-sourced.",

This reliance hinders generalization on minority examples, where such\ncorrelations do not hold. Existing shortcut mitigation approaches are\nmodel-specific, difficult to tune, computationally expensive, and fail to\nimprove learned representations. To address these issues, we propose\nInterpoLated Learning (InterpoLL) which interpolates the representations of\nmajority examples to include features from intra-class minority examples with\nshortcut-mitigating patterns. This weakens shortcut influence, enabling models\nto acquire features predictive across both minority and majority examples.\nExperimental results on multiple natural language understanding tasks\ndemonstrate that InterpoLL improves minority generalization over both ERM and\nstate-of-the-art shortcut mitigation methods, without compromising accuracy on\nmajority examples.

In the\nabsence of this domain knowledge, the causal structure must be discovered from\nthe available observational data. However, observational data are often\ncompatible with multiple causal graphs, making methods that commit to a single\nstructure prone to overconfidence. A principled way to manage this structural\nuncertainty is via Bayesian inference, which averages over a posterior\ndistribution on possible causal structures and functional mechanisms.\nUnfortunately, the number of causal structures grows super-exponentially with\nthe number of nodes in the graph, making computations intractable. We propose\nto circumvent these challenges by using meta-learning to create an end-to-end\nmodel: the Model-Averaged Causal Estimation Transformer Neural Process\n(MACE-TNP). The model is trained to predict the Bayesian model-averaged\ninterventional posterior distribution, and its end-to-end nature bypasses the\nneed for expensive calculations. Empirically, we demonstrate that MACE-TNP\noutperforms strong Bayesian baselines.

Recent studies show\nthat the informal accuracy exceeds 80% while formal success remains below 8% on\nbenchmarks like PutnamBench. We argue this gap persists because current\nstate-of-the-art provers, by tightly coupling reasoning and proving, are\ntrained with paradigms that inadvertently punish deep reasoning in favor of\nshallow, tactic-based strategies.

    "abstract": "Robots struggle to understand object properties like shape, material, and\nsemantics due to limited prior knowledge, hindering manipulation in\nunstructured environments. In contrast, humans learn these properties through\ninteractive multi-sensor exploration. This work proposes fusing visual and\ntactile observations into a unified Gaussian Process Distance Field (GPDF)\nrepresentation for active perception of object properties. While primarily\nfocusing on geometry, this approach also demonstrates potential for modeling\nsurface properties beyond geometry. The GPDF encodes signed distance using\npoint cloud, analytic gradient and Hessian, and surface uncertainty estimates,\nwhich are attributes that common neural network shape representation lack. By\nutilizing a point cloud to construct a distance function, GPDF does not need\nextensive pretraining on large datasets and can incorporate observations by\naggregation. Starting with an initial visual shape estimate, the framework\niteratively refines the geometry by integrating dense vision measurements using\ndifferentiable rendering and tactile measurements at uncertain surface regions.\nBy quantifying multi-sensor uncertainties, it plans exploratory motions to\nmaximize information gain for recovering precise 3D structures.

Existing interpretability methods\nlike Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) produce latent concepts individually for each\nmodel, resulting in incompatible concept spaces and limiting cross-model\ninterpretability. To address this, we introduce SPARC (Sparse Autoencoders for\nAligned Representation of Concepts), a new framework that learns a single,\nunified latent space shared across diverse architectures and modalities (e.g.,\nvision models like DINO, and multimodal models like CLIP). SPARC's alignment is\nenforced through two key innovations: (1) a Global TopK sparsity mechanism,\nensuring all input streams activate identical latent dimensions for a given\nconcept; and (2) a Cross-Reconstruction Loss, which explicitly encourages\nsemantic consistency between models. On Open Images, SPARC dramatically\nimproves concept alignment, achieving a Jaccard similarity of 0.80, more than\ntripling the alignment compared to previous methods. SPARC creates a shared\nsparse latent space where individual dimensions often correspond to similar\nhigh-level concepts across models and modalities, enabling direct comparison of\nhow different architectures represent identical concepts without requiring\nmanual alignment or model-specific analysis. As a consequence of this aligned\nrepresentation, SPARC also enables practical applications such as text-guided\nspatial localization in vision-only models and cross-model/cross-modal\nretrieval.

It shares clinical similarities\nwith Alzheimer's disease (AD), as both progress through stages of normal\ncognition, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia. A major obstacle in LBD\ndiagnosis is data scarcity, which limits the effectiveness of deep learning. In\ncontrast, AD datasets are more abundant, offering potential for knowledge\ntransfer. However, LBD and AD data are typically collected from different sites\nusing different machines and protocols, resulting in a distinct domain shift.\nTo effectively leverage AD data while mitigating domain shift, we propose a\nTransferability Aware Transformer (TAT) that adapts knowledge from AD to\nenhance LBD diagnosis. Our method utilizes structural connectivity (SC) derived\nfrom structural MRI as training data. Built on the attention mechanism, TAT\nadaptively assigns greater weights to disease-transferable features while\nsuppressing domain-specific ones, thereby reducing domain shift and improving\ndiagnostic accuracy with limited LBD data. The experimental results demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of TAT. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study\nto explore domain adaptation from AD to LBD under conditions of data scarcity\nand domain shift, providing a promising framework for domain-adaptive diagnosis\nof rare diseases.",

To address this, we propose LoomNet, a novel multi-view\ndiffusion architecture that produces coherent images by applying the same\ndiffusion model multiple times in parallel to collaboratively build and\nleverage a shared latent space for view consistency. Each viewpoint-specific\ninference generates an encoding representing its own hypothesis of the novel\nview from a given camera pose, which is projected onto three orthogonal planes.\nFor each plane, encodings from all views are fused into a single aggregated\nplane. These aggregated planes are then processed to propagate information and\ninterpolate missing regions, combining the hypotheses into a unified, coherent\ninterpretation. The final latent space is then used to render consistent\nmulti-view images. LoomNet generates 16 high-quality and coherent views in just\n15 seconds. In our experiments, LoomNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods on\nboth image quality and reconstruction metrics, also showing creativity by\nproducing diverse, plausible novel views from the same input.",

The limited\ninteroperability of these twins has prompted calls for a universal framework\nenabling observability across model aggregations. Here we show how a new\nmathematical formalism called a constraint hypergraph serves as such a\nframework by representing system behavior as the composition of set-based\nfunctions. A digital twin is shown to be the second of two coupled systems\nwhere both adhere to the same constraint hypergraph, permitting the properties\nof the first to be observable from the second. Interoperability is given by\ndeconstructing models into a structure enabling autonomous, white-box\nsimulation of system properties. The resulting digital twins can interact\nimmediately with both human and autonomous agents. This is demonstrated in a\ncase study of a microgrid, showing how both measured and simulated data from\nthe aggregated twins can be provided regardless of the operating environment.\nBy connecting models, constraint hypergraphs supply scientists and modelers\nrobust means to capture, communicate, and combine digital twins across all\nfields of study.

Thought to be formed due to\nsublimational erosion of methane ice, bladed terrain represents an active\nresponse of Pluto's landscape to current and past climates. The observation of\na strong methane signature within the low latitudes of Pluto's non-encounter\nhemisphere points to the possibility that this terrain type is also present\nthere. To test this hypothesis, in the absence of high resolution images of\nPluto's non-encounter hemisphere, we employ photometric analysis of the methane\nrich regions. We specifically focus on determining the macroscopic surface\nroughness in selected images, whose photometric-effect can be apparent even in\nlow-resolution images. We employ the `crater-roughness' photometric model of\nBuratti & Veverka (1985), which assumes that the surface is covered with\nparabolic depressions defined by a depth-to-radius ratio parameter $q$ (higher\n$q$ values correspond to rougher surfaces). Despite the high uncertainty in the\nretrieved roughness values from our analysis, we can safely conclude that the\nhypothesized bladed terrain region on the non-encounter hemisphere of Pluto is\nvery rough ($q = 0.47_{-0.11}^{+0.10}$, 2$\\sigma$), with the median roughness\nmore than twice that of other broad regions of Pluto studied in this work,\nincluding the encounter-hemisphere bladed terrain region ($q =\n0.21_{-0.18}^{+0.08}$, 2$\\sigma$).",

    "abstract": "Energy conversion in materials can be considered as a sequence of elementary\nsteps initiated by a primary excitation. While these steps are quite well\nunderstood in classical semiconductors in terms of quasiparticle (QP)\nexcitations and interactions, their understanding in strongly correlated\nmaterials is still elusive. Here, we review the progress which has been\nachieved over recent years by studies of manganite perovskite oxides as a model\nsystem for materials with strong correlations. They show a subtle interplay of\ndifferent types of correlations, i.e., electron-phonon, electron-electron and\nspin-spin, resulting in rich physical phenomena due to competition between\ndifferent ground states accompanied by temperature- and field-induced phase\ntransitions. They strongly impact various types of energy conversion and\ntransport processes including friction at surfaces, thermal transport, time-,\nenergy- and power-dependent optical excitations as well as photovoltaic energy\nconversion. The underlying microscopic processes can be broken down to the\nbehavior of the low-energy thermal and high-energy optical excitations, their\ninteractions, transport and conversion which are theoretically analyzed by\nusing models of interacting and tunable QPs: Their nature and interactions can\nchange during excitation, transport and phase transitions, thus modifying\nelectronic structure. At sufficiently high stimulation, QP excitations can even\ninduce or actuate phase transitions. As a result, we obtained a comprehensive\nunderstanding of energy conversion steps going far beyond single QP pictures\nand rigid band approximations well-known for conventional semiconductors.",

In\nanalogy, electronic nematicity refers to a state whose electronic properties\nspontaneously break rotation symmetries of the host crystalline lattice,\nleading to anisotropic electronic properties. In this work, we demonstrate that\nthe layered antiferromagnet CoTa$_3$S$_6$ exhibits a switchable nematic order,\nevidenced by the emergence of both resistivity anisotropy and optical\nbirefringence. This nematic state sets in at a temperature $T^*$ distinct from\nthat of the antiferromagnetic transitions in the system, indicating a separate\nsymmetry-breaking mechanism. The nematic order can be manipulated either by an\nin-plane rotation symmetry-breaking strain or in-plane magnetic field, with the\nlatter exhibiting a pronounced non-volatile memory effect. Remarkably, we find\nthat the broken three-fold rotation symmetry in electronic transport is\nrestored with a moderate out-of-plane field. We hypothesize that the nematicity\nis of electronic origin and emerges from instabilities associated with van Hove\nsingularities. The resulting phase diagram points to an intertwined interplay\nbetween the electronic nematicity and the proposed underlying collinear and\nnon-coplanar spin orders.

Many cloud condensates form as nonspherical particles and their\noptical properties can be very different from those of spheres. In this study,\nwe focus on KCl particles, which likely form as cuboids in warm (T=500-1000K)\nexoplanet atmospheres. We compare the phase functions (at 532 nm wavelength) of\nKCl particles computed with Mie theory, the two-term Henyey-Greenstein (TTHG)\napproximation, laboratory data, and the discrete dipole approximation (DDA).\nMie theory assumes scattering from spheres, while TTHG functions are used to\napproximate cloud scattering in two-stream radiative transfer models like\nPICASO. Laboratory measurements and DDA allow for a robust understanding of\nscattering from cuboid and deformed cuboid particle shapes. We input these\nphase functions into PICASO using cloud distributions from the cloud model\nVirga, to determine how different phase functions can impact the\nreflected-light intensities of the benchmark sub-Neptune, GJ 1214b. Simulated\nreflected light phase curves of GJ1214b produced using the TTHG, laboratory,\nand DDA phase curves differ by less than 3ppm. Our findings suggest that TTHG\nphase functions may be useful for approximating the scattering intensity of\ncertain cuboid and irregular particle shapes.

However, its dependence on\ncomputationally intensive simulations makes it impractical for fast sampling.\nIn parallel, a class of training-free approaches has been developed that guides\ndiffusion models using off-the-shelf classifiers on predicted clean samples,\nbypassing the need to train classifiers on noisy data. These methods can be\ninterpreted as approximate SOC schemes, using Tweedie's formula to estimate\ndiffusion posteriors. In practice, however, such direct approximations can\nintroduce significant errors, leading to unreliable guidance. In this work, we\nunify the strengths of both paradigms by proposing a novel training-free\ndiffusion guidance framework based on a surrogate stochastic optimal control\nobjective. We derive a new theoretical bound on the value function that reveals\nthe necessity of correcting the approximate posteriors to remain faithful to\nthe true diffusion posterior. To this end, we connect the problem with Stein\nvariational inference, which seeks the steepest descent direction that\nminimizes the Kullback-Leibler discrepancy between the two posteriors. Our\nmethod, which we refer to as Stein Diffusion Guidance (SDG), introduces a\nprincipled correction mechanism and incorporates a novel running cost\nfunctional to enable effective guidance in low-density regions.

In the opposite direction, if\n$G$ is an amenable group which is not finitely generated, we show that there is\nno comeager conjugacy class in the space of all actions and if $G$ is locally\nfinite, also in the space of minimal actions.\n  Finally, we study the question of existence of a dense conjugacy class in the\nspace of topologically transitive actions. We show that if $G$ is free or\nvirtually polycyclic, then such a dense conjugacy class exists iff $G$ is\nvirtually cyclic.",

In this case, the motion is governed by\na system of differential-algebraic equations (DAE), often with large and sparse\nsystem matrices. The problem dimension strongly influences the effectiveness of\nsimulations for system analysis, optimization, and control, given limited\ncomputational resources. Therefore, we aim to obtain a simplified surrogate\nmodel with a few degrees of freedom that is able to accurately represent the\nmotion and other important properties of the original high-dimensional DAE\nmodel. Classical model reduction methods intrusively exploit the system\nmatrices to construct the projection of the high-fidelity model onto a\nlow-dimensional subspace. In practice, the dynamical equations are frequently\nan inaccessible part of proprietary software products. In this work, we show an\napplication of the non-intrusive operator inference (OpInf) method to DAE\nsystems of index 2 and 3. Considering the fact that for proper DAEs there\nexists an ODE realization on the so-called hidden manifold, the OpInf\noptimization problem directly provides the underlying ODE representation of the\ngiven DAE system in the reduced subspace. A significant advantage is that only\nthe DAE solution snapshots in a compressed form are required for identification\nof the reduced system matrices. Stability and interpretability of the\nreduced-order model is guaranteed by enforcing the symmetric positive definite\nstructure of the system operators using semidefinite programming. The numerical\nresults demonstrate the implementation of the proposed methodology for\ndifferent examples of constrained mechanical systems, tested for various\nloading conditions.",

Given a first-order method, a function class, and a noise\nmodel with prescribed expectation and variance properties, we present a range\nof semidefinite programs (SDPs) of increasingly large size, whose solutions\nyield increasingly strong convergence guarantees on the problem. Eventually, we\npropose SDPs whose size depends on $2^N$, with $N$ the number of iterations\nanalyzed, that yield tight guarantees, attained by specific functions and noise\ndistributions within these classes. On the other side of the spectrum, we\npropose SDPs whose size depends linearly on $N$, and numerically show that, on\nmany problems, they already provide tight guarantees.\n  The framework accommodates a wide range of stochastic settings, with finite\nor infinite support, including the unstructured noise model with bounded\nvariance, finite-sum optimization, and block-coordinate methods, in a unified\nmanner, as guarantees apply to any setting consistent with the noise model,\ni.e., its expectation and variance. It covers both non-variance-reduced and\nvariance-reduced methods. Using the framework, we analyze the stochastic\ngradient method under several noise models, and illustrate how the resulting\nnumerical and analytical convergence rates connect with existing results.

The second stage\nenables legitimate receivers to retrieve encrypted phase data using entangled\nquantum states, eliminating the need for classical key transfer.

We argue that LLMs develop internal structures that are\nfunctionally analogous to the kind of understanding that consists in seeing\nconnections. To sharpen this idea, we propose a three-tiered conception of\nunderstanding. First, conceptual understanding emerges when a model forms\n\"features\" as directions in latent space, learning the connections between\ndiverse manifestations of something. Second, state-of-the-world understanding\nemerges when a model learns contingent factual connections between features and\ndynamically tracks changes in the world. Third, principled understanding\nemerges when a model ceases to rely on a collection of memorized facts and\ndiscovers a \"circuit\" connecting these facts. However, these forms of\nunderstanding remain radically different from human understanding, as the\nphenomenon of \"parallel mechanisms\" shows.

In this paper, we\npresent a novel sensemaking system, Group of LLMs for Open-ended Sensemaking\n(GLOSS), capable of open-ended sensemaking and performing complex multimodal\ntriangulation to derive insights. We demonstrate that GLOSS significantly\noutperforms the commonly used Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique,\nachieving 87.93% accuracy and 66.19% consistency, compared to RAG's 29.31%\naccuracy and 52.85% consistency. Furthermore, we showcase the promise of GLOSS\nthrough four use cases inspired by prior and ongoing work in the UbiComp and\nHCI communities. Finally, we discuss the potential of GLOSS, its broader\nimplications, and the limitations of our work.",

    "abstract": "Current quantum communication protocols rely heavily on classical\nauthentication for message origin verification, leaving them vulnerable to\nevolving attacks that exploit classical trust assumptions. In this work, we\npropose a novel framework for secure quantum relay networks that completely\navoids classical authentication. Instead, we leverage pre-distributed\nentanglement graphs and non-classical correlation-assisted decoding to enable\nexclusive message retrieval by designated nodes without broadcasting any key or\nhandshake. The system routes messages across multiple relay nodes, yet ensures\nthat no intermediate node can access the message unless it possesses the\nentangled state partner. We demonstrate that even in multi-path scenarios with\nasynchronous entanglement distribution, the protocol guarantees quantum-forward\nsecrecy and end-to-end origin integrity without trusted intermediaries.\nSimulation results confirm both functionality and robustness under entanglement\nloss and imperfect detection. This architecture paves the way for scalable\nquantum communication systems where physical quantum states replace classical\nauthentication mechanisms entirely.",

Tokamak plasmas are\nin a self-organized state, especially when fusion rather than external heating\ndominates. Stellarator optimization focuses on the magnetic fields produced by\nthe coils. Tokamak optimization considers plasma profiles, which are not easily\ncontrolled. A deviation of the profile of the plasma current over its full\nstability range produces only a small change, $\\sim 16\\%$, in the poloidal flux\nproduced by the plasma current. This offers a simple explanation of why\ndisruptions in tokamaks are so common, and why current-profile control though\ndifficult seems to be required, especially during shutdown. The rapid temporal\ndecay of $n\\tau_ET$ in high performance tokamak experiments shows the need for\nthe careful control for other profiles. Here the focus is on the implications\nof Faraday's Law since important but new implications are easily derived. The\ncontext of the paper is twofold: (1) Simplified statements of the implications\nof the laws of physics, in particular Faraday's Law, should be helpful in the\ndesign of tokamak power plants.

Two core bottlenecks dominate: accessing Feed-Forward Network (FFN)\nweights and reading long KV caches. While Tensor Parallelism (TP) helps\nmitigate the cost of FFN weight reads, it does not scale well for attention.\nWhen TP width exceeds the number of KV heads, it leads to inefficient KV\nduplication, limits parallelism, and constrains batch size. Simultaneously,\nDRAM reads for long KV histories scale linearly with batch size, further\ncapping efficiency.\n  We introduce Helix Parallelism, a hybrid execution strategy that applies KV\nparallelism during attention to shard KV caches across GPUs, then reuses the\nsame GPUs for TP in dense LLMs or TPxExpert Parallel (EP) in MoEs during FFN\ncomputation. To preserve exact attention behavior, Helix includes a lightweight\ncommunication step. To minimize the exposed communication cost, we introduce\nHelix HOP-B. Helix HOP-B effectively minimizes communication overhead through\nbatchwise overlap, preserving low TTL while improving GPU efficiency. Compared\nto conventional parallelism approaches, Helix reduces TTL by up to 1.5x at\nfixed batch sizes and supports up to 32x larger batches under the same latency\nbudget for DeepSeek-R1, pushing forward the throughput-latency Pareto on\nBlackwell and making real-time inference with ultra-long-sequence practical.",

    "abstract": "Estimating the mean annual power of a wave energy converter (WEC) through the\nmethod of bins relies on a parametric representation of all possible sea\nstates. In practice, two-parameter spectra based on significant wave height and\nenergy period are ubiquitous. Two-parameter spectra have been shown\ninsufficient in capturing the range of spectral shapes that can occur in an\nactual ocean environment. Furthermore, through sensitivity analysis, these\ntwo-parameters have been shown to be insufficient for predicting power\nperformance of WECs. Four parameter spectra, which expand the parameter space\nto include two additional shape parameters have been shown sufficient in\ncapturing sea state variance, but their effect on mean power estimates has not\nbeen presented. This work directly looks at the effects of incorporating\n4-parameter spectra into annual power estimates compared to using the\ntraditional 2-parameter spectra. We use two different 4-parameter spectra: one\nfrom the literature and a novel machine learning-based autoencoder, presented\nhere. Both are shown to improve the information retained when parameterizing\nspectra. The site-specific autoencoder performs consistently the best across\ntwo case studies of mean annual power prediction, achieving an error around 1%\nin each instance. The 2-parameter spectra resulted in less consistent\npredictive performance, with errors of -8% and 1% in the two case studies. For\nthe case study where all three models performed well, it is shown that the low\nerror in the 2-parameter model is attributable to a symmetrical distribution of\nlarge errors whereas both 4-parameter spectra result in relatively low errors\nthroughout the parametric space. These results highlight the need for more\nsophisticated resource characterization methods for estimating the power\nperformance of WECs and suggest site-specific machine learning-based spectra\nare an adequate option.",

DeepRetro is a novel, open-source framework that\ntightly integrates large language models (LLMs), traditional retrosynthetic\nengines, and expert human feedback in an iterative design loop. Prior\napproaches rely solely on template-based methods or unconstrained LLM outputs.\nIn contrast, DeepRetro combines the precision of template-based methods with\nthe generative flexibility of LLMs, controlled by rigorous chemical validity\nchecks and enhanced by recursive refinement. This hybrid system dynamically\nexplores and revises synthetic pathways, guided by both algorithmic checks and\nexpert chemist feedback through an interactive user interface. While DeepRetro\nachieves strong performance on standard retrosynthesis benchmarks, its true\nstrength lies in its ability to propose novel, viable pathways to highly\ncomplex natural products-targets that have historically eluded automated\nplanning. Through detailed case studies, we illustrate how this approach\nenables new routes for total synthesis and facilitates human-machine\ncollaboration in organic chemistry.

    "abstract": "The near infrared (NIR, >800 nm) or short wave infrared (SWIR) range of the\nelectromagnetic spectrum overlays with the tissue transparency window and the\ntelecommunication window, which makes it important for fluorescence-based\nimaging and photonics in general. Additionally, there are NIR absorption\nfeatures related to vibrational overtone or combination modes and\nautofluorescence in photosynthetic organisms such as plants. Here, we report a\npersistent NIR tail and feature at 923 nm that is observed during the\nphotochemical generation of singlet oxygen using various photosensitizers. This\nfeature initially appears to originate from singlet oxygen as its energy fits\nto known higher order optical and vibrational transitions, and it occurs\nsimultaneously with the characteristic singlet oxygen phosphorescence at 1275\nnm. To determine its origin, a systematic investigation is carried out using\ndifferent photosensitizers (Rose Bengal, a ruthenium complex, Methylene Blue,\nchlorophyll), solvents, excitation sources and optical setups. The emission is\npresent under all photochemical conditions, but it is not observed for\nchemically generated singlet oxygen. Its intensity correlates with\nphotosensitizer concentration (1 uM - 1 mM), excitation intensity and the\nvisible fluorescence intensity, but does not require the presence of oxygen as\nthe 1275 nm phosphorescence of singlet oxygen. A simulation shows that this\nfeature arises from the NIR-tail of (visible) photosensitizer emission and the\nnon-linear increase of detector sensitivity in the range between 900 nm - 950\nnm. At the same time this feature and the whole NIR tail correlates with\nphotochemically generated singlet oxygen concentration under certain\nconditions. Thus, careful interpretation of NIR emission is crucial but it also\ncontains valuable information.",

    "abstract": "Uniform and excessive herbicide application in modern agriculture contributes\nto increased input costs, environmental pollution, and the emergence of\nherbicide resistant weeds. To address these challenges, we developed a vision\nguided, AI-driven variable rate sprayer system capable of detecting weed\npresence, estimating canopy size, and dynamically adjusting nozzle activation\nin real time. The system integrates lightweight YOLO11n and YOLO11n-seg deep\nlearning models, deployed on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano for onboard inference,\nand uses an Arduino Uno-based relay interface to control solenoid actuated\nnozzles based on canopy segmentation results. Indoor trials were conducted\nusing 15 potted Hibiscus rosa sinensis plants of varying canopy sizes to\nsimulate a range of weed patch scenarios. The YOLO11n model achieved a mean\naverage precision (mAP@50) of 0.98, with a precision of 0.99 and a recall close\nto 1.0. The YOLO11n-seg segmentation model achieved a mAP@50 of 0.48, precision\nof 0.55, and recall of 0.52. System performance was validated using water\nsensitive paper, which showed an average spray coverage of 24.22% in zones\nwhere canopy was present. An upward trend in mean spray coverage from 16.22%\nfor small canopies to 21.46% and 21.65% for medium and large canopies,\nrespectively, demonstrated the system's capability to adjust spray output based\non canopy size in real time. These results highlight the potential of combining\nreal time deep learning with low-cost embedded hardware for selective herbicide\napplication. Future work will focus on expanding the detection capabilities to\ninclude three common weed species in South Dakota: water hemp (Amaranthus\ntuberculatus), kochia (Bassia scoparia), and foxtail (Setaria spp.), followed\nby further validation in both indoor and field trials within soybean and corn\nproduction systems.",

Combined HST\nand JWST observations reveal a haze free, H/He dominated atmosphere with a\nlarge scale height (~1500km), allowing detection of CO2 (35 sigma), H2O (30\nsigma), CO (10 sigma), CH4 (6 sigma), SO2 (4 sigma) and OCS (3.5 sigma). Our\nobservations probe several scale heights (~4.4 in the CO2 4.3 microns and ~3 in\nthe 2.7 micron water band). The planet's mass, inferred from atmospheric scale\nheight using free retrieval and grid modelling is 12+/-1 and 15+/-1.7Me\nrespectively which is significantly lower than previous radial velocity\nestimates and confirm it as a 'gas-dwarf' sub-Neptune progenitor. We find an\natmospheric super-solar metallicity (logZ=0.6^+0.4_-0.6 x solar) and a\nsub-solar C/O ratio (0.22^+0.06_-0.05). The atmospheric metallicity is low\ncompared to matured sub-Neptunes by an order of magnitude. The CH4 abundance\n([CH4]=-6.2^+0.3_-0.5) is ~7 sigma lower than equilibrium chemistry prediction.\nTo adjust for the low methane abundance, the self-consistent grids favour a\nhigh internal temperature (~500K) and vertical mixing (Kzz ~10^7-10^8 cm2/s).\nThese internal temperatures are inconsistent with predictions from evolutionary\nmodels, which expect ~100 - 200K at the current system age. We estimate a\ngas-to-core mass fraction between 0.1 - 8 %, with a core mass of 11 - 12 Me,\nconsistent with in-situ gas dwarf formation. A deep atmospheric metallicity\ngradient may explain both the high internal temperature and low observable\nmetallicity. Over time, mass loss from such an atmosphere could enhance its\nmetallicity, potentially reconciling V1298 Tau b with mature sub-Neptunes.",

    "abstract": "The Fast Beam Condition Monitor (FBCM) is a standalone luminometer for the\nHigh Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) program of the CMS Experiment at CERN. The\ndetector is under development and features a new, radiation-hard, front-end\napplication-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) designed for beam monitoring\napplications. The achieved timing resolution of a few nanoseconds enables the\nmeasurement of both the luminosity and the beam-induced background. The ASIC,\ncalled FBCM23, features six channels with adjustable shaping times, enabling\nin-field fine-tuning. Each ASIC channel outputs a single binary asynchronous\nsignal encoding time of arrival and time over threshold information. The FBCM\nis based on silicon-pad sensors, with two sensor designs presently being\nconsidered. This paper presents the results of tests of the FBCM detector\nprototype using both types of silicon sensors with hadron, muon, and electron\nbeams. Irradiated FBCM23 ASICs and silicon-pad sensors were also tested to\nsimulate the expected conditions near the end of the detector's lifetime in the\nHL-LHC radiation environment. Based on test results, direct bonding between the\nsensor and ASIC was chosen, and an optimal bias voltage and ASIC threshold for\nFBCM operation were proposed. The current design of the front-end test board\nwas validated following the beam test and is now being used for the first\nfront-end module, which is expected to be produced in summer 2025. These\nresults represent a major step forward in validating the FBCM concept, first\nversion of the firmware and establishing a reliable design path for the final\ndetector.",

    "abstract": "Coverage-guided fuzzers are powerful automated bug-finding tools. They mutate\nprogram inputs, observe coverage, and save any input that hits an unexplored\npath for future mutation. Unfortunately, without knowledge of input\nformats--for example, the relationship between formats' data fields and\nsizes--fuzzers are prone to generate destructive frameshift mutations. These\ntime-wasting mutations yield malformed inputs that are rejected by the target\nprogram. To avoid such breaking mutations, this paper proposes a novel,\nlightweight technique that preserves the structure of inputs during mutation by\ndetecting and using relation fields.\n  Our technique, FrameShift, is simple, fast, and does not require additional\ninstrumentation beyond standard coverage feedback. We implement our technique\nin two state-of-the-art fuzzers, AFL++ and LibAFL, and perform a 12+ CPU-year\nfuzzer evaluation, finding that FrameShift improves the performance of the\nfuzzer in each configuration, sometimes increasing coverage by more than 50%.\nFurthermore, through a series of case studies, we show that our technique is\nversatile enough to find important structural relationships in a variety of\nformats, even generalizing beyond C/C++ targets to both Rust and Python.",

    "abstract": "Disks of two sizes are confined to a long and narrow channel. The axis and\nthe plane of the channel are horizontal. The channel is closed off by pistons\nthat freeze jammed microstates out of loose disk configurations, agitated\nrandomly at calibrated intensity and subject to moderate pressure. Disk sizes\nand channel width are such that under jamming no disks remain loose and all\ndisks touch one wall. The protocol permits disks to move past each other prior\nto jamming, which facilitates randomness in the sequence of large and small\ndisks. We present exact results for the characterization of jammed macrostates\nincluding volume and entropy for given fractions of small and large disks as\nfunctions of energy parameters which depend on the jamming protocol. Our\nanalysis divides the disk sequence of jammed microstates into overlapping tiles\nout of which we construct 17 species of statistically interacting\nquasiparticles. Jammed macrostates then depend on the fractions of small and\nlarge disks and on a dimensionless control parameter inferred from measures for\nexpansion work against the pistons and intensity of random agitations. Two\nmodels are introduced for comparison of key technical aspects: one model\nemphasizes symmetry and the other mechanical stability. We distinguish regimes\nfor the energy parameters that either enhance or suppress mixing of disk sizes\nin jammed macrostates. The latter case, if realizable, is a manifestation of\ngrain segregation driven by steric forces alone, without directional bias.",

As a\nnatural generalization of the model and motivated by the Anderson\nlocalization-delocalization transition in mathematical physics, we consider the\ninvertibility of a class of random band matrices with independent entries where\nthe bandwidth $d_n$ scales like $n^\\alpha$, for some $\\alpha\\in(0,1)$. The band\nmatrix model we consider is sufficiently general and covers existing models\nsuch as the block band matrix and periodic band matrix, allowing great\nflexibility in the variance profile. As the bandwidth is sublinear in the\ndimension, estimating the invertibility and least singular values of these\nmatrices is a well-known open problem. We make a progress towards the\ninvertibility problem by showing that, when $\\alpha>\\frac{2}{3}$ and when the\nrandom variables are i.i.d. uniformly distributed on $\\{\\pm 1\\}$, then the band\nmatrix is invertible with probability $1-\\exp(-\\Omega(n^{\\alpha/2}))$.\nPreviously, even invertibility with probability $1-o(1)$ was not known for\nthese band matrix models except in the very special case of block band\nmatrices.",

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of learning robust discriminative representations of\ncausally-related latent variables. In addition to observational data, the\ntraining dataset also includes interventional data obtained through targeted\ninterventions on some of these latent variables to learn representations robust\nagainst the resulting interventional distribution shifts. Existing approaches\ntreat interventional data like observational data, even when the underlying\ncausal model is known, and ignore the independence relations that arise from\nthese interventions. Since these approaches do not fully exploit the causal\nrelational information resulting from interventions, they learn representations\nthat produce large disparities in predictive performance on observational and\ninterventional data, which worsens when the number of interventional training\nsamples is limited. In this paper, (1) we first identify a strong correlation\nbetween this performance disparity and adherence of the representations to the\nindependence conditions induced by the interventional causal model. (2) For\nlinear models, we derive sufficient conditions on the proportion of\ninterventional data in the training dataset, for which enforcing interventional\nindependence between representations corresponding to the intervened node and\nits non-descendants lowers the error on interventional data. Combining these\ninsights, (3) we propose RepLIn, a training algorithm to explicitly enforce\nthis statistical independence during interventions. We demonstrate the utility\nof RepLIn on a synthetic dataset and on real image and text datasets on facial\nattribute classification and toxicity detection, respectively. Our experiments\nshow that RepLIn is scalable with the number of nodes in the causal graph and\nis suitable to improve the robust representations against interventional\ndistribution shifts of both continuous and discrete latent variables.",

    "abstract": "The ability to transfer knowledge from prior experiences to novel tasks\nstands as a pivotal capability of intelligent agents, including both humans and\ncomputational models. This principle forms the basis of transfer learning,\nwhere large pre-trained neural networks are fine-tuned to adapt to downstream\ntasks. Transfer learning has demonstrated tremendous success, both in terms of\ntask adaptation speed and performance. However there are several domains where,\ndue to lack of data, training such large pre-trained models or foundational\nmodels is not a possibility - computational chemistry, computational\nimmunology, and medical imaging are examples. To address these challenges, our\nwork focuses on designing architectures to enable efficient acquisition of\npriors when large amounts of data are unavailable. In particular, we\ndemonstrate that we can use neural memory to enable adaptation on\nnon-stationary distributions with only a few samples. Then we demonstrate that\nour hypernetwork designs (a network that generates another network) can acquire\nmore generalizable priors than standard networks when trained with Model\nAgnostic Meta-Learning (MAML). Subsequently, we apply hypernetworks to 3D scene\ngeneration, demonstrating that they can acquire priors efficiently on just a\nhandful of training scenes, thereby leading to faster text-to-3D generation. We\nthen extend our hypernetwork framework to perform 3D segmentation on novel\nscenes with limited data by efficiently transferring priors from earlier viewed\nscenes. Finally, we repurpose an existing molecular generative method as a\npre-training framework that facilitates improved molecular property prediction,\naddressing critical challenges in computational immunology.",

Here, we consider $[n,k,d]$-classical stabilizer codes addressing\nbit-flip errors where $n$, $k$ and $d$ are the numbers of physical and logical\nqubits, and the code distance respectively. We prove that operations essential\nfor achieving a universal logical gate set necessarily require complex unitary\ncircuits to be implemented. Specifically, these implementation circuits either\nconsists of $h$ layers of $r$-transversal operations on $c$ codeblocks such\nthat $c^{h-1}r^h \\geq d$ or of $h$ gates, each operating on at most $r$\nphysical qubits on the same codeblock, such that $hr\\geq d$. Similar\nconstraints apply not only to classical codes designed to correct phase-flip\nerrors, but also to quantum stabilizer codes tailored to biased noise. This\nmotivates a closer examination of alternative logical gate constructions using\neg.~magic state distillation and cultivation within the framework of\nbiased-noise stabilizer codes.",

Despite this difference, the two models show good qualitative agreement\nfor both satellite disruption fractions and timescales, and quenching. The\nnumber of satellites rises rapidly until $z=1$ and then remains nearly\nconstant. The fraction of satellites from each epoch that are disrupted by\n$z=0$ decreases steadily from nearly 100% to 0% during $4>z>0.1$. These\nfractions are higher for VINTERGATAN than IllustrisTNG, except for massive\nsatellites ($M_{*}>10^{7}\\,M_{\\odot}$) at $z>0.5$. This difference is largely\ndue to varying distributions of pericentric distance, orbital period and number\nof orbits, in turn determined by which sub(haloes) are populated with galaxies\nby the two models.

In this work, the accuracy, feasibility, and\ntime of simulation of FEM and FDM are compared by simulating the vibration of a\nguitar string. Python simulations for both methods are implemented, and their\nresults are compared against analytical solutions and experimental data.\nAdditionally, FDM is applied to analyze the sound of a cycling bell to assess\nits reliability compared to a real cycling bell. Final results show that both\nFEM and FDM yield similar error margins and accurately predict the system's\nbehavior. Moreover, the errors from FEM and FDM follow the same periodicity\nwith a phase shift when varying the assumed analytical tension and without a\nphase shift when changing the time interval. However, FEM converges faster with\nincreasing mesh complexity, whereas FDM demonstrates quicker computational\nperformance and achieves stable solutions even with bigger time intervals.\nDespite this FDM is limited to simpler configurations and often demands\nextensive mathematical formulation, which can become cumbersome for intricate\nshapes. For example, modeling a hemispherical object using FDM results in\nsignificant simulation times and big calculations.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in deep learning, particularly neural networks, have\nsignificantly impacted a wide range of fields, including the automatic\nenhancement of underwater images. This paper presents a deep learning-based\napproach to improving underwater image quality by integrating human subjective\nassessments into the training process. To this end, we utilize publicly\navailable datasets containing underwater images labeled by experts as either\nhigh or low quality. Our method involves first training a classifier network to\ndistinguish between high- and low-quality images. Subsequently, generative\nadversarial networks (GANs) are trained using various enhancement criteria to\nrefine the low-quality images. The performance of the GAN models is evaluated\nusing quantitative metrics such as PSNR, SSIM, and UIQM, as well as through\nqualitative analysis. Results demonstrate that the proposed model --\nparticularly when incorporating criteria such as color fidelity and image\nsharpness -- achieves substantial improvements in both perceived and measured\nimage quality.",

Methods: A multi-region segmentation nnUNet was\ntrained on 146 bSSFP images of 73 fetal subjects (coronal and axial\norientations) for the parcellation of the fetal head, fetal body, placenta,\namniotic fluid and umbilical cord from whole uterus bSSFP stacks.

Results: The segmentation pipeline was\nquantitatively and retrospectively evaluated on 36 stacks of 18 fetal subjects\nand demonstrated sufficient performance for all labels, with high scores\n(>0.98) for the fetus, placenta and amniotic fluid, and 0.91 for the umbilical\ncord.

While\nprior studies suggest that intermediate layers often yield more generalizable\nrepresentations than final layers, how this generalization ability emerges and\npropagates across layers during training remains unclear. To address this gap,\nwe propose InfoRidge, an information-theoretic framework, to characterize how\npredictive information-the mutual information between hidden representations\nand target outputs-varies across depth. Estimating this quantity enables us to\ntrace the flow of task-relevant information throughout the model during\ntraining. Our experiments across various models and datasets reveal a\nconsistent non-monotonic trend: predictive information peaks in upper-middle\nlayers-forming a generalization ridge-before declining in final layers,\nreflecting a transition between generalization and memorization. To further\ninvestigate this phenomenon, we introduce residual scaling\ncoefficients-trainable scalar parameters applied to each residual block-which\nserve as functional probes for assessing the relative importance of individual\ntransformer layers. These coefficients reveal that, under distribution shift,\nmodels downweight final layers and increasingly rely on ridge layers,\nhighlighting their role in generalization. Together, these findings offer new\ninsights into the internal mechanisms of transformers and underscore the\ncritical role of intermediate layers in supporting generalization.",

    "abstract": "Continual post-training (CPT) is a popular and effective technique for\nadapting foundation models like multimodal large language models to specific\nand ever-evolving downstream tasks. While existing research has primarily\nconcentrated on methods like data replay, model expansion, or parameter\nregularization, the fundamental role of the learning paradigm within CPT\nremains largely unexplored. This paper presents a comparative analysis of two\ncore post-training paradigms: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement\nfine-tuning (RFT), investigating their respective impacts on knowledge\nretention during CPT. Our experiments are conducted on a benchmark comprising\nseven diverse multimodal tasks, utilizing Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct as the base\nmodel for continual post-training. The investigation yields two significant\nfindings: (1) When continuously learning on downstream tasks, SFT leads to\ncatastrophic forgetting of previously learned tasks. In contrast, RFT\ninherently preserves prior knowledge and achieve performance comparable to\nmulti-task training. (2) RFT successfully protects and even enhances the\nmodel's general knowledge on standard benchmarks (e.g., MMMU and MMLU-Pro).\nConversely, SFT degrades general model capabilities severely. Further analysis\nshows that explicit mechanisms, such as KL penalty and chain-of-thought\nreasoning, are not the primary factors. Instead, we find that the implicit\nregularization inherent to RFT is a key factor in mitigating forgetting.\nFinally, we propose a rollout-based instance filtering algorithm to improve the\nstability and efficiency of RFT. Our comprehensive study demonstrates the\nsuperiority of RFT as a robust paradigm for continual post-training.",

    "abstract": "A fraction of active galactic nuclei (AGN) have double-peaked H$\\alpha$,\nH$\\beta$ and Mg II broad lines attributed to emission from rotating gas in the\naccretion disk. Using optical spectroscopy of a flux-limited sample of AGN\nselected via ultrahard X-rays from the BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey (BASS), we\nsystematically identify 71 double-peaked emitters amongst 343 broad-line AGN\nwith redshifts $0.004<z<0.297$ and 2-10 KeV X-ray luminosities of log 40-45.7\n(erg/s), and provide their best-fit accretion disk geometry parameters. We find\nthat ~21% of X-ray selected broad-line AGN are double-peaked emitters (DPEs),\nconsistent with rates previously reported for $z<0.2$ broad-line AGN selected\nfor strong optical variability in ZTF. 11 of 71 DPEs (15%) exhibited a\nsingle-peaked Gaussian component to the broad line profile in addition to the\ndouble-peaked disk profile. In this sample, DPEs have intrinsically higher\nmasses by ~0.4 dex and lower Eddington ratios by ~0.3 dex than other broad-line\nAGN, and have a preference for elliptical host galaxies, higher X-ray\nluminosities, and higher [OI] $\\lambda$6302 to narrow H$\\alpha$ flux ratios\nthan other broad-line AGN. We find that DPEs are not segregated from other\nbroad-line AGN in the $L_{\\rm bol}$ vs $M_{\\rm BH}$ relation or their X-ray to\nradio luminosity ratios, and do not show a preference for intermediate Seyfert\ntypes over Seyfert 1s. We do not find differences in a wide range of\nmulti-wavelength properties when comparing DPEs to other broad-line AGN,\nincluding optical and mid-IR variability levels, and the rate of changing-look\nevents. We discuss the two populations in the context of multi-component\ndisk-wind models of the AGN broad line region and consider how unrecognized\ncontributions of disk emission to the broad lines introduce biases in virial\nSMBH mass estimates.",

This paper introduces\nYOLO-APD, a novel deep learning architecture enhancing the YOLOv8 framework\nspecifically for this challenge. YOLO-APD integrates several key architectural\nmodifications: a parameter-free SimAM attention mechanism, computationally\nefficient C3Ghost modules, a novel SimSPPF module for enhanced multi-scale\nfeature pooling, the Mish activation function for improved optimization, and an\nIntelligent Gather & Distribute (IGD) module for superior feature fusion in the\nnetwork's neck.

Comprehensive\nevaluations on a custom CARLA dataset simulating complex scenarios demonstrate\nthat YOLO-APD achieves state-of-the-art detection accuracy, reaching 77.7%\nmAP@0.5:0.95 and exceptional pedestrian recall exceeding 96%, significantly\noutperforming baseline models, including YOLOv8. Furthermore, it maintains\nreal-time processing capabilities at 100 FPS, showcasing a superior balance\nbetween accuracy and efficiency. Ablation studies validate the synergistic\ncontribution of each integrated component. Evaluation on the KITTI dataset\nconfirms the architecture's potential while highlighting the need for domain\nadaptation.

Geometrically, we employ the hyperboloidal framework to\nexplicitly implement Geroch's rigorous limiting procedures for families of\nspacetimes. This enables a controlled transition between Schwarzschild, de\nSitter, and Nariai geometries. Numerically, we introduce the analytical mesh\nrefinement technique into quasinormal mode calculations, successfully\nrecovering -- within the appropriate limiting scenarios -- both known families\nof quasinormal modes: complex light-ring modes and purely imaginary de Sitter\nmodes. We interpret these results in terms of spectral instability, where the\nnotions of stable and unstable modes depends on the specific spacetime limit\nunder consideration. In the Schwarzschild limit, de Sitter modes appear as a\ndestabilizing effect on the continuous branch cut at $\\omega = 0$. Conversely,\nthe branch cut can be understood as emerging from an infinite accumulation of\ndiscrete modes at $\\omega = 0$ in the transitional regime. We propose a\nheuristic measure of QNM density to characterize this accumulation and\nhighlight the need for a more rigorous study of potential branch cut\ninstabilities--especially relevant in the context of late-time gravitational\nwave signals.

    "abstract": "Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in nanodiamonds have emerged as a promising\nquantum sensing platform for biomedical imaging applications, yet random\norientations of individual particles present significant challenges in\nlarge-scale sensor calibration. In this study, we demonstrate a novel approach\nto simultaneously determine each particle's crystallographic axes and the\nsurrounding local vector magnetic field. Specifically, a minimum of four\ndistinct bias fields is required to unambiguously extract both the orientation\nand the local field. We validate our method experimentally using NV centers in\ntwo scenarios: (1) in a bulk diamond with known crystal orientation as a proof\nof concept, and (2) on various single nanodiamonds to mimic real-world\napplications. Our work represents a crucial step towards unlocking the full\npotential of nanodiamonds for advanced applications such as in-situ biomedical\nimaging and nanoscale sensing in complex environments.",

We consider the scenario in which orbital\ndecay via tidal dissipation led to the merger, and find that tidal heating\nwithin the star was likely unobservable in the archival image of the system\ntaken $12\\mathrm{yr}$ before the merger. The observed dust formation months\nbefore the merger is consistent with a planet of mass $M_\\mathrm{p} \\gtrsim\n5M_\\mathrm{J}$ ejecting material as it skims the stellar surface. This\ninteraction gradually intensifies, leading to significant mass ejection on a\ndynamical timescale ($ \\approx $ hours) as the planet plunges into the stellar\ninterior. Part of the recombination transient associated with this dynamical\nmass ejection might be inaccessible to the optical observations because its\nduration ($ \\approx $ hours) is comparable to the cadence. Correspondingly, the\nobserved duration of the transient $\\approx100\\mathrm{d}$ is inconsistent with\na single episode of dynamical mass ejection. Instead, the transient could be\npowered by the recombination of $ \\approx 3.4\\times10^{-5}M_\\odot $ of hydrogen\nin an outflow, or the contraction of an inflated envelope of mass $ \\approx\n10^{-6}M_\\odot $ that formed during the merger. The observed ejecta mass\n$320\\mathrm{d}$ after the peak of the optical transient is $ \\approx\n1.3\\times10^{-4}M_\\odot$, consistent with the idea that a fraction of the\nejecta might be unobservable in the light curve. Energetically, this\npost-merger ejecta mass suggests a planet at least as massive as Jupiter. Our\nresults suggest that ZTF SLRN-2020 was the result of a merger between a star\nclose to the main sequence and a planet with mass at least several times that\nof Jupiter.",

The\nfull catalog contains over 400k detected clusters with richnesses, Ngals, above\n5 and that reach redshifts up to 1.3. We also provide a version of the catalog\nwhere the observation depth and richness computation are homogenized to be used\nfor cosmology, containing 33k rich (Ngals >25) clusters. We compare our results\nwith the previous WaZP catalog obtained from the DES first-year data release\n(DES-Y1). We find that essentially all clusters within the common footprint and\ndepth limit are recovered. The deeper observations on DES-Y6 and the more\ncomplete available spectroscopic redshift sample lead to improvements in the\nredshifts of the clusters, resulting in an average scatter of 1.4% and offset\nof 0.2%. The optical clusters are also cross-matched with Sunyaev Zel'dovich\nEffect (SZE) cluster samples detected by the South Pole Telescope (SPT) and the\nAtacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). We find that essentially all SZE clusters\nwith reasonable overlapping footprint have a corresponding WaZP cluster.\nConversely, 90% of the optical detections with richness greater than 150 have a\ncounterpart in the deeper regions of the SZE surveys. Based on cross-match with\nthe SZE catalogs, we also find that 15-20% of the SZE matched systems have more\nthan one possible WaZP counterpart at the same redshift and within the SZE\nR500c, indicating possible interacting or unrelaxed systems. Finally, given the\noptical and SZE beams, WaZP and SZE centerings are found to be consistent. A\nmore detailed study of the SZE-WaZP mass-richness relation will be presented in\na separate paper.",

We measure a hot molecular gas mass of $\\sim 8.0 \\times 10^{5}$\nM$_{\\odot}$, which is $\\sim 10^{5}-10^{6}$ times lower than the cold molecular\ngas mass. cid_346 is located in an environment with extended gas structures and\nsatellite galaxies. This is supported by detection of hot and cold molecular\ngas out to distances $>$10 kpc in MIRI/MRS and ALMA data, respectively and\nancillary NIRCam imaging that reveals two satellite galaxies at distances of\n$\\sim$0.4 arcsec (3.3 kpc) and $\\sim$0.9 arcsec (7.4 kpc) from the AGN. Our\nresults tentatively indicate that while the CO(3-2)-based cold gas phase\ndominates the molecular gas mass at Cosmic Noon, H$_{2}$ ro-vibrational\ntransitions are effective in tracing hot molecular gas locally in regions that\nmay lack CO emission.",

We conduct two sets of simulations with\nidentical initial conditions: the Fiducial model, which includes a three-phase\nSN mechanical wind, and the weak SN feedback model, where nearly all SN energy\nis released as thermal energy with a reduced SN wind velocity. Our comparison\nshows minimal differences in the elliptical host galaxies, but significant\nvariations in the physical properties of satellite galaxies. The weak SN\nfeedback model produces a larger number of satellite galaxies compared to the\nFiducial model, and significantly more than observed. For satellite galaxies\nwith stellar masses above $10^{8}$ $M_{\\odot}$, the weak SN feedback model\ngenerates approximately five times more satellites than observed in the xSAGA\nsurvey. Most of these overproduced satellites have small stellar masses, below\n$10^{10}$ $M_{\\odot}$. Additionally, satellites in the weak SN feedback model\nare about 3.5 times more compact than those observed in the SAGA survey and the\nFiducial model, with metallicities nearly 1 dex higher than observed values. In\nconclusion, the satellite galaxies in the Fiducial model, which includes\nmechanical SN feedback, exhibit properties more closely aligned with\nobservations.

Over the following months, the X-ray\nflux started decaying, with significant flaring activity on both hour- and\nyear-timescales. By inspecting the multiwavelength light curves of time-domain\nwide-field facilities, we detected a strong mid-infrared flare, evolving over 2\nyears, and a weaker optical counterpart. Follow-up optical spectroscopy\nrevealed transient features, including redshifted Balmer lines (FWHM ~1500\nkm/s), strong Fe II emission, He II and Bowen lines, and high-ionization iron\ncoronal lines. One spectrum showed a triple-peaked H-beta line, consistent with\nemission from a face-on elliptical disk. The spectroscopic features and the\nslow evolution of the event place J012026 within the classifications of Bowen\nfluorescence flares (BFFs) and extreme coronal line emitters (ECLEs). BFFs have\nbeen associated with rejuvenated accreting SMBHs, although the mechanism\ntriggering the onset of the new accretion flow is still unclear, while ECLEs\nhave been linked to the disruption of stars in gas-rich environments. The\nassociation of J012026 to both classes, combined with the multi-wavelength\ninformation, suggests that BFFs could be, at least in some cases, due to tidal\ndisruption events (TDEs). The observed X-ray variability, uncommon in standard\nTDEs, adds complexity to these families of nuclear transients. These results\nhighlight the diverse phenomenology of nuclear accretion events and demonstrate\nthe value of systematic X-ray surveys, such as eROSITA and Einstein Probe, for\nuncovering such transients and characterizing their physical origin.",

Recent\nstudies suggest that crystallization may magnetize white dwarf interiors with a\nstrong magnetic field $B_0$ up to a radius $r_{\\rm out}^0$, either through a\nmagnetic dynamo or by transporting a pre-existing fossil field. We demonstrate\nthat seismology can probe these buried fields before they break out at the\nsurface, because even the weak exponential tail of the outwardly diffusing\nfield can disrupt the propagation of gravity waves near the surface. Based on\nthe observed oscillation modes of WD J0135+5722 - the richest pulsating UMWD to\ndate - we constrain its surface field $B_{\\rm surf}\\lesssim 2\\,\\textrm{kG}$.

For a carbon-oxygen (CO) core we find $B_{\\rm surf}\\ll\nB_0\\lesssim 0.6\\,\\textrm{MG}$, consistent with the crystallization dynamo\ntheory.

This low magnetic field rules out an ONe\ncomposition or, alternatively, an intense dynamo during crystallization or\nmerger.

We argue that in GKP-like 4D\nno-scale vacua, accounting for this field dependence generates one-loop,\npositive-definite potentials for the otherwise unfixed moduli, with local\nMinkowski minima at the desert points in moduli space with $z_i \\sim\n\\mathcal{O}(1)$. As these no-scale moduli grow, a dS plateau emerges and, for\nlarger moduli, the potential runs away to zero, consistent with Swampland\nexpectations. This may have important consequences for the moduli fixing\nproblem. In particular non-perturbative superpotentials may not be necessary\nfor fixing the K\\\"ahler moduli in a Type IIB setting. Although one loses\ncontrol over non-perturbative corrections, we argue that modular invariance\n(more generally, dualities) of the species scale may give us information about\nthe behaviour at small moduli in some simple cases.

Despite its remarkable properties, at this point it is\nstringently constrained by the body of flavor- and CP-violation tests, so that\nthe compositeness scale must be at least $O(100)$ TeV, beyond the direct reach\nof proposed colliders. On the other hand, Composite Higgs theories with\nflavor-symmetric strong dynamics, but with realistic flavor-violating\nhierarchies introduced in an ad hoc manner, can extend the GIM mechanism of the\nstandard model and thereby be far less constrained, at the edge of LHC reach\nand well within reach of future colliders.

While this approach has seen remarkable success in\ndescribing gapped and gapless pure-state phases in $1+1$d, its applicability to\nopen quantum systems remains entirely unexplored. In this work, we propose a\nnatural extension of the SymTFT framework to mixed-state phases by introducing\nthe \\textit{symmetry taco}: a bilayer topological order in $2+1$d whose folded\ngeometry naturally encapsulates both strong and weak symmetries of the $1+1$d\ntheory. We use this perspective to identify a series of correspondences,\nincluding a one-to-one map between intrinsically gapless SPTs (igSPTs) and\ncertain gapped SPTs, and a mapping between igSPTs and intrinsically average\nSPTs (iASPTs) arising in $1+1$d mixed states. More broadly, our framework\nyields a classification of short-range correlated $G$-symmetric Choi states in\n$1+1$d, provides a route for systematically generating mixed-state SPTs via\nlocal decoherence of igSPTs, and allows us to identify a new mixed-state\n``anomaly\". Besides folding in mixed-state phases into the SymTFT paradigm, the\nsymmetry taco opens new avenues for exploring dualities, anomalies, and\nnon-equilibrium criticality in mixed-state quantum matter.",

However, recent work suggests that holographic maps\nshould post-select on such closed universes, and we argue that this is\nconsistent with the extrapolate dictionary.

Symmetry enhancement refers to situations\nwhere bootstrap studies initialised with a certain symmetry end up allowing\ntheories with higher symmetry.

The same mechanism can\nalso be used to differentiate between decoupled and fully coupled theories\nwhich otherwise have the same global symmetry. A systematic understanding of\nthis mechanism is developed and applied to distinguish the cubic from the\n$O(3)$ model in three dimensions, where a strip of disallowed parameter space,\nreferred to as the cubic redundancy channel, emerges once a gap associated with\na redundant operator of the cubic theory is imposed.

Combining weak\nlensing surveys with spatial and kinematic observations of HI could help\nconstrain key properties of dark matter, such as its mass, clustering behavior,\nand spatial distribution.

Methods that use empirical relations, often\ncalibrated via numerical simulations, do not use full field-level information\nto model the complex relation between dark matter and HI. We address this\nshortcoming with a data-driven approach, leveraging the recently introduced\nEMBER-2 model to learn the HI-dark matter mapping at the field level for a wide\nredshift range, z=6-0. After training on cosmological galaxy formation\nsimulations run with FIRE-2, EMBER-2 accurately recovers key statistics,\nincluding dark matter mass fractions and surface density profiles. The HI-dark\nmatter density cross-correlation is reconstructed at an accuracy of 10% down to\nscales of k = 100 h/cMpc, a significant improvement over traditional\napproaches.

    "abstract": "Hyperuniform structures are spatial patterns whose fluctuations disappear on\nlong length scales, making them effectively homogeneous when observed from\nafar. Mathematically, this means that their spectral density,\n$\\tilde{\\rho}({\\bf k})$, approaches zero for low wavenumber, $|\\textbf{k}|$.\nCrystalline lattices are hyperuniform, as are certain quasicrystals, maximally\nrandom jammed packing of spheres, and electrons in the fractional quantum Hall\nstate. Stealthy-hyperuniformity is an even stronger constraint on the spectral\ndensity: it requires that $\\tilde{\\rho}({\\bf k})$ is strictly zero in a finite\nrange of wavevectors around $\\mathbf{k}=\\mathbf{0}$, called the stealthy\nregime, or exclusion region. Since the degree of scattering by disorder is, to\nleading order, proportional to $\\tilde{\\rho}({\\bf k})$, waves propagating\nthrough such structures may do so without scattering for sufficiently long\nwavelengths and short distances. Here, we measure scattering by disorder in\nphotonic crystal slabs with stealthy-hyperuniform disorder by measuring the\nlinewidths of the photonic bands. We observe the transition between the\nstealthy and non-stealthy regimes, marked by a sharp increase in linewidth. We\nalso observe the effects of multiple scattering in the stealthy regime, which\nimplies diminishing transparency. Moreover, we show that residual single\nscattering in the stealthy regime arises from an intrinsically non-Hermitian\neffect: propagating light has a complex effective mass due to radiative loss\nout of the slab.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising framework for autonomous\ndriving by enabling agents to learn control policies through interaction with\nenvironments. However, large and high-dimensional action spaces often used to\nsupport fine-grained control can impede training efficiency and increase\nexploration costs. In this study, we introduce and evaluate two novel\nstructured action space modification strategies for RL in autonomous driving:\ndynamic masking and relative action space reduction. These approaches are\nsystematically compared against fixed reduction schemes and full action space\nbaselines to assess their impact on policy learning and performance. Our\nframework leverages a multimodal Proximal Policy Optimization agent that\nprocesses both semantic image sequences and scalar vehicle states. The proposed\ndynamic and relative strategies incorporate real-time action masking based on\ncontext and state transitions, preserving action consistency while eliminating\ninvalid or suboptimal choices. Through comprehensive experiments across diverse\ndriving routes, we show that action space reduction significantly improves\ntraining stability and policy performance. The dynamic and relative schemes, in\nparticular, achieve a favorable balance between learning speed, control\nprecision, and generalization. These findings highlight the importance of\ncontext-aware action space design for scalable and reliable RL in autonomous\ndriving tasks.",

To address this,\nwe have developed a self-supervised machine-learning approach for source\nseparation using a dual implicit neural representation framework that jointly\ntrains two neural networks: one for approximating distortions of the physical\nsignal of interest and the other for learning the effective background\ncontribution. Our method learns directly from the raw data by minimizing a\nreconstruction-based loss function without requiring labeled data or\npre-defined dictionaries. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by\nconsidering a challenging case study involving large-scale simulated as well as\nexperimental momentum-energy-dependent inelastic neutron scattering data in a\nfour-dimensional parameter space, characterized by heterogeneous background\ncontributions and unknown distortions to the target signal. The method is found\nto successfully separate physically meaningful signals from a complex or\nstructured background even when the signal characteristics vary across all four\ndimensions of the parameter space. An analytical approach that informs the\nchoice of the regularization parameter is presented. Our method offers a\nversatile framework for addressing source separation problems across diverse\ndomains, ranging from superimposed signals in astronomical measurements to\nstructural features in biomedical image reconstructions.",

    "abstract": "Robot manipulation has seen tremendous progress in recent years, with\nimitation learning policies enabling successful performance of dexterous and\nhard-to-model tasks. Concurrently, scaling data and model size has led to the\ndevelopment of capable language and vision foundation models, motivating\nlarge-scale efforts to create general-purpose robot foundation models. While\nthese models have garnered significant enthusiasm and investment, meaningful\nevaluation of real-world performance remains a challenge, limiting both the\npace of development and inhibiting a nuanced understanding of current\ncapabilities. In this paper, we rigorously evaluate multitask robot\nmanipulation policies, referred to as Large Behavior Models (LBMs), by\nextending the Diffusion Policy paradigm across a corpus of simulated and\nreal-world robot data. We propose and validate an evaluation pipeline to\nrigorously analyze the capabilities of these models with statistical\nconfidence. We compare against single-task baselines through blind, randomized\ntrials in a controlled setting, using both simulation and real-world\nexperiments. We find that multi-task pretraining makes the policies more\nsuccessful and robust, and enables teaching complex new tasks more quickly,\nusing a fraction of the data when compared to single-task baselines. Moreover,\nperformance predictably increases as pretraining scale and diversity grows.\nProject page: https://toyotaresearchinstitute.github.io/lbm1/",

    "abstract": "In collaborative tasks, being able to adapt to your teammates is a necessary\nrequirement for success. When teammates are heterogeneous, such as in\nhuman-agent teams, agents need to be able to observe, recognize, and adapt to\ntheir human partners in real time. This becomes particularly challenging in\ntasks with time pressure and complex strategic spaces where the dynamics can\nchange rapidly. In this work, we introduce TALENTS, a strategy-conditioned\ncooperator framework that learns to represent, categorize, and adapt to a range\nof partner strategies, enabling ad-hoc teamwork. Our approach utilizes a\nvariational autoencoder to learn a latent strategy space from trajectory data.\nThis latent space represents the underlying strategies that agents employ.\nSubsequently, the system identifies different types of strategy by clustering\nthe data. Finally, a cooperator agent is trained to generate partners for each\ntype of strategy, conditioned on these clusters. In order to adapt to\npreviously unseen partners, we leverage a fixed-share regret minimization\nalgorithm that infers and adjusts the estimated partner strategy dynamically.\nWe assess our approach in a customized version of the Overcooked environment,\nposing a challenging cooperative cooking task that demands strong coordination\nacross a wide range of possible strategies. Using an online user study, we show\nthat our agent outperforms current baselines when working with unfamiliar human\npartners.",

    "abstract": "In many reinforcement learning (RL) applications, augmenting the task rewards\nwith heuristic rewards that encode human priors about how a task should be\nsolved is crucial for achieving desirable performance. However, because such\nheuristics are usually not optimal, much human effort and computational\nresources are wasted in carefully balancing tasks and heuristic rewards.\nTheoretically rigorous ways of incorporating heuristics rely on the idea of\n\\textit{policy invariance}, which guarantees that the performance of a policy\nobtained by maximizing heuristic rewards is the same as the optimal policy with\nrespect to the task reward. However, in practice, policy invariance doesn't\nresult in policy improvement, and such methods are known to empirically perform\npoorly. We propose a new paradigm to mitigate reward hacking and effectively\nuse heuristics based on the practical goal of maximizing policy improvement\ninstead of policy improvement. Our framework, Heuristic Enhanced Policy\nOptimization (HEPO), effectively leverages heuristics while avoiding the\npitfall of prior methods for mitigating reward hacking. HEPO achieves superior\nperformance on standard benchmarks with well-engineered reward functions. More\nsurprisingly, HEPO allows policy optimization to achieve good performance even\nwhen heuristics are not well-engineered and designed by non-expert humans,\nshowcasing HEPO's ability to reduce human effort in reward design. % HEPO is a\nplug-and-play optimization method for leveraging heuristics in reinforcement\nlearning.

By directly\naddressing the intricacies of modal loss in a fully quantum theory of\nmagnetodielectric cQED, our approach enables the exploration of modern, quantum\nnano-optical experiments utilizing dielectric, plasmonic, magnetic or hybrid\ncQED architectures, and paves the way towards a rigorous assessment of\nroom-temperature quantum nanophotonic technologies without recourse to ad hoc\nquantization schemes.",

    "abstract": "Polarizability plays an essential role in characterizing the key phenomena,\nsuch as the screening effects, collective excitations, and dielectric functions\npresent in the system. In this study, we investigate the intraband and\ninterband polarizability within the random phase approximation for the\nthree-dimensional nodal line semimetals, specifically for Ca$_3$P$_2$ and\nZrSiS. We find both intraband and interband contributions show tunable behavior\nwith the chemical potential, which adds a resonance signature in the behavior\nof the polarizability. Further, in the long wavelength limit, the results\nreveal the quadratic dependence on the wave vector by the non-resonant\nintraband and interband parts of the polarizability. On the other hand, the\nresonant interband part gives a cubic dependence on the wave vector. In\naddition, the total polarizability is dominated by the intraband part in the\nlow frequency regime, while in the mid and high frequency regimes, the\ninterband part takes the lead. This study opens avenues for further theoretical\nand experimental exploration of frequency dependent dielectric properties,\npaving the way for potential applications in tunable plasmonic devices.",

    "abstract": "This work studies gradient coding (GC) in the context of distributed training\nproblems with unreliable communication. We propose cooperative GC (CoGC), a\nnovel gradient-sharing-based GC framework that leverages cooperative\ncommunication among clients. This approach ultimately eliminates the need for\ndataset replication, making it both communication- and computation-efficient\nand suitable for federated learning (FL). By employing the standard GC decoding\nmechanism, CoGC yields strictly binary outcomes: either the global model is\nexactly recovered, or the decoding fails entirely, with no intermediate\nresults. This characteristic ensures the optimality of the training and\ndemonstrates strong resilience to client-to-server communication failures when\nthe communication channels among clients are in good condition. However, it may\nalso result in communication inefficiency and hinder convergence due to its\nlack of flexibility, especially when communication channels among clients are\nin poor condition. To overcome this limitation and further harness the\npotential of GC matrices, we propose a complementary decoding mechanism, termed\nGC$^+$, which leverages information that would otherwise be discarded during GC\ndecoding failures. This approach significantly improves system reliability\nunder unreliable communication, as the full recovery of the global model\ntypically dominates in GC$^+$. To conclude, this work establishes solid\ntheoretical frameworks for both CoGC and GC$^+$. We provide complete outage\nanalyses for each decoding mechanism, along with a rigorous investigation of\nhow outages affect the structure and performance of GC matrices. Building on\nthese analyses, we derive convergence bounds for both decoding mechanisms.\nFinally, the effectiveness of CoGC and GC$^+$ is validated through extensive\nsimulations.",

Associating objects in low-frame-rate videos captured by\nmoving unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in actual combat scenarios is complex\ndue to rapid changes in object appearance and position within the frame. The\ntask becomes even more challenging due to image degradation caused by cloud\nvideo streaming and compression algorithms. We present how instance association\nlearning from single-frame annotations can overcome these challenges. We show\nthat global features of the scene provide crucial context for low-FPS instance\nassociation, allowing our solution to be robust to distractors and gaps in\ndetections. We also demonstrate that such a tracking approach maintains high\nassociation quality even when reducing the input image resolution and latent\nrepresentation size for faster inference. Finally, we present a benchmark\ndataset of annotated military vehicles collected from publicly available data\nsources.

    "abstract": "As LLMs continue to increase in parameter size, the computational resources\nrequired to run them are available to fewer parties. Therefore, third-party\ninference services -- where LLMs are hosted by third parties with significant\ncomputational resources -- are becoming increasingly popular. However, third\nparty inference raises critical concerns about user data privacy. To mitigate\nthese risks, privacy researchers have developed provably secure schemes for\nthird-party inference, such as Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC). However,\nSMPC protocols have significant computational and communication overhead, and\ndo not scale to large models. In this work, we propose a new multi-party\ninference protocol, Cascade, that avoids these punitive costs by leveraging\nsharding in the sequence dimension to maintain privacy, trading off\ncryptographic privacy guarantees for increased performance and scalability. We\ndemonstrate that Cascade is resistant to a generalization of a recent attack\nthat is highly effective against other statistical privacy schemes, and that it\nis further resistant to learning-based attacks. As Cascade is orders of\nmagnitude faster than existing schemes, our findings offer practical solutions\nfor secure deployment of modern state-of-the-art LLMs.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous driving systems have made significant advances in Q&A, perception,\nprediction, and planning based on local visual information, yet they struggle\nto incorporate broader navigational context that human drivers routinely\nutilize. We address this critical gap between local sensor data and global\nnavigation information by proposing NavigScene, an auxiliary navigation-guided\nnatural language dataset that simulates a human-like driving environment within\nautonomous driving systems. Moreover, we develop three complementary paradigms\nto leverage NavigScene: (1) Navigation-guided Reasoning, which enhances\nvision-language models by incorporating navigation context into the prompting\napproach; (2) Navigation-guided Preference Optimization, a reinforcement\nlearning method that extends Direct Preference Optimization to improve\nvision-language model responses by establishing preferences for\nnavigation-relevant summarized information; and (3) Navigation-guided\nVision-Language-Action model, which integrates navigation guidance and\nvision-language models with conventional driving models through feature fusion.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our approaches significantly improve\nperformance across perception, prediction, planning, and question-answering\ntasks by enabling reasoning capabilities beyond visual range and improving\ngeneralization to diverse driving scenarios.

Gemini 2.5 Pro is our most capable model yet, achieving SoTA\nperformance on frontier coding and reasoning benchmarks. In addition to its\nincredible coding and reasoning skills, Gemini 2.5 Pro is a thinking model that\nexcels at multimodal understanding and it is now able to process up to 3 hours\nof video content. Its unique combination of long context, multimodal and\nreasoning capabilities can be combined to unlock new agentic workflows. Gemini\n2.5 Flash provides excellent reasoning abilities at a fraction of the compute\nand latency requirements and Gemini 2.0 Flash and Flash-Lite provide high\nperformance at low latency and cost. Taken together, the Gemini 2.X model\ngeneration spans the full Pareto frontier of model capability vs cost, allowing\nusers to explore the boundaries of what is possible with complex agentic\nproblem solving.",

This study\ninvestigates empathy in SE from practitioners' perspectives, aiming to\ncharacterize its meaning, identify barriers, discuss practices to overcome\nthem, and explore its effects. Method. A qualitative content analysis was\nconducted on 55 web articles from DEV and Medium, two communities widely used\nby practitioners. To strengthen our findings, we conducted a follow-up survey\nwith empathy experts. Results. The study proposes a definition of empathy in\nSE, identifies barriers such as toxic culture and excessive technical focus,\npractices to foster empathy in teams, and outcomes, including improved\ncollaboration, communication, and reduced anxiety, frustration, and stress.\nThese findings are synthesized into a conceptual framework. Conclusion. Survey\nresults indicate the framework is clear, valuable, and raises empathy\nawareness, with suggestions for improvements and integration into training.\nThis study paves the way for improving team dynamics by addressing barriers and\noffering strategies to cultivate empathy. Future work will explore empathy's\nbroader implications in SE practice.",

Pre-perihelion measurements provide a unique opportunity to study\nits activity and composition, which may alter as it is heated in the coming\nmonths. We provide an initial baseline from optical spectroscopic observations\nobtained only two days after discovery, using the MUSE instrument on the VLT on\n2025 July 3, while 3I was at 4.47 au from the Sun and 3.46 au from the Earth.\nThese observations confirm the cometary nature of 3I, and reveal a red coma\nwith a spectral slope of $(18\\pm4)\\%/1000$~\\AA, redder than most Solar System\ncomets but similar to the surface colour of some Solar System Trans-Neptunian\nObjects or Centaurs. We searched for but did not detect gas emission from\nC$_2$, NH$_2$, CN, and [OI], which is consistent with volatile non-detections\nfor Solar System comets at this heliocentric distance. At present, the coma\nappears entirely dusty. Future observations of 3I as it comes closer to the Sun\nwill provide an invaluable opportunity to witness the evolution of its\nactivity, study its composition, test predictions of interstellar object\npopulation models, and compare 3I to Solar System comets.",

Moreover, if the\nembedding dimension of $R$ is at least 3, eventually the ideals of minors\nbecome the powers of the maximal ideal, yielding the 1-periodicity. Moreover,\nif the embedding dimension of $R$ is at least 3, these ideals of minors are\neventually 1-periodic. These are analogs of results obtained over complete\nintersections and Golod rings by Brown, Dao, and Sridhar. We also prove that\nthe eventual periodicity of ideals of minors can be lifted from $R$ to $R[[x]]$\nfor all finitely generated modules over $R$. More generally, we prove that for\nany local ring $(R,\\mathfrak{m})$, the property of the asymptotic behaviour of\nideals of minors being periodic can be lifted from $R/(x)$ to $R$ whenever $x\n\\in \\mathfrak{m}$ is a super-regular element for certain classes of modules.",

    "abstract": "The apparent invariance of the strong nuclear force under combined charge\nconjugation and parity (CP) remains an open question in modern physics.\nPrecision experiments with heavy atoms and molecules can provide stringent\nconstraints on CP violation via searches for effects due to permanent electric\ndipole moments and other CP-odd properties in leptons, hadrons, and nuclei.\nRadioactive molecules have been proposed as highly sensitive probes for such\nsearches, but experiments with most such molecules have so far been beyond\ntechnical reach. Here we report the first production and spectroscopic study of\na gas-phase actinium molecule, $^{227}$AcF. We observe the predicted strongest\nelectronic transition from the ground state, which is necessary for efficient\nreadout in searches of symmetry-violating interactions. Furthermore, we perform\nelectronic- and nuclear-structure calculations for $^{227}$AcF to determine its\nsensitivity to various CP-violating parameters, and find that a realistic,\nnear-term experiment with a precision of 1 mHz would improve current\nconstraints on the CP-violating parameter hyperspace by three orders of\nmagnitude. Our results thus highlight the potential of $^{227}$AcF for\nexceptionally sensitive searches of CP violation.",

For black holes, mass accretion of CPL and JBP DE shows transitions\nbetween quintessence and phantom eras, while BA and LambdaCDM strictly exhibit\nquintessence-like behavior, driving cosmic acceleration. In contrast, wormholes\nexhibit the opposite trend, favoring a phantom-dominated era for the BA and\nLambdaCDM models. The study highlights the dynamic nature of DE in 4D EGB\ngravity and its role in cosmic expansion.",

    "abstract": "We introduce an algorithmic framework based on tensor networks for computing\nfluid flows around immersed objects in curvilinear coordinates. We show that\nthe tensor network simulations can be carried out solely using highly\ncompressed tensor representations of the flow fields and the differential\noperators and discuss the numerical implementation of the tensor operations\nrequired for computing fluid flows in detail. The applicability of our method\nis demonstrated by applying it to the paradigm example of steady and transient\nflows around stationary and rotating cylinders. We find excellent quantitative\nagreement in comparison to finite difference simulations for Strouhal numbers,\nforces and velocity fields. The properties of our approach are discussed in\nterms of reduced order models. We estimate the memory saving and potential\nruntime advantages in comparison to standard finite difference simulations. We\nfind accurate results with errors of less than 0.3% for flow-field compressions\nby a factor of up to 20 and differential operators compressed by factors of up\nto 1000 compared to sparse matrix representations. We provide strong numerical\nevidence that the runtime scaling advantages of the tensor network approach\nwith system size will provide substantial resource savings when simulating\nlarger systems. Finally, we note that, like other tensor network-based fluid\nflow simulations, our algorithmic framework is directly portable to a quantum\ncomputer leading to further scaling advantages.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning models have demonstrated exceptional performance across a wide\nrange of computer vision tasks. However, their performance often degrades\nsignificantly when faced with distribution shifts, such as domain or dataset\nchanges. Test-Time Training (TTT) has emerged as an effective method to enhance\nmodel robustness by incorporating an auxiliary unsupervised task during\ntraining and leveraging it for model updates at test time. In this work, we\nintroduce CTA (Cross-Task Alignment), a novel approach for improving TTT.\nUnlike existing TTT methods, CTA does not require a specialized model\narchitecture and instead takes inspiration from the success of multi-modal\ncontrastive learning to align a supervised encoder with a self-supervised one.\nThis process enforces alignment between the learned representations of both\nmodels, thereby mitigating the risk of gradient interference, preserving the\nintrinsic robustness of self-supervised learning and enabling more semantically\nmeaningful updates at test-time. Experimental results demonstrate substantial\nimprovements in robustness and generalization over the state-of-the-art on\nseveral benchmark datasets.",

In support of\nthis paradigm, algorithms have emerged to combine a small amount of\nhigh-fidelity observed data with a much larger set of imputed model outputs to\nestimate some quantity of interest. Yet current hybrid-inference tools target\nonly means or single quantiles, limiting their applicability for many critical\ndomains and use cases. We present QuEst, a principled framework to merge\nobserved and imputed data to deliver point estimates and rigorous confidence\nintervals for a wide family of quantile-based distributional measures. QuEst\ncovers a range of measures, from tail risk (CVaR) to population segments such\nas quartiles, that are central to fields such as economics, sociology,\neducation, medicine, and more.

    "abstract": "Reasoning with quantifier expressions in natural language combines logical\nand arithmetical features, transcending strict divides between qualitative and\nquantitative. Our topic is this cooperation of styles as it occurs in common\nlinguistic usage and its extension into the broader practice of natural\nlanguage plus \"grassroots mathematics\".\n  We begin with a brief review of first-order logic with counting operators and\ncardinality comparisons. This system is known to be of high complexity, and\ndrowns out finer aspects of the combination of logic and counting. We move to a\nsmall fragment that can represent numerical syllogisms and basic reasoning\nabout comparative size: monadic first-order logic with counting. We provide\nnormal forms that allow for axiomatization, determine which arithmetical\nnotions can be defined on finite and on infinite models, and conversely, we\ndiscuss which logical notions can be defined out of purely arithmetical ones,\nand what sort of (non-)classical logics can be induced.\n  Next, we investigate a series of strengthenings, again using normal form\nmethods. The monadic second-order version is close, in a precise sense, to\nadditive Presburger Arithmetic, while versions with the natural device of tuple\ncounting take us to Diophantine equations, making the logic undecidable. We\nalso define a system that combines basic modal logic over binary accessibility\nrelations with counting, needed to formulate ubiquitous reasoning patterns such\nas the Pigeonhole Principle.\n  We return to our starting point in natural language, confronting the\narchitecture of our formal systems with linguistic quantifier vocabulary and\nsyntax. We conclude with some general thoughts on yet further entanglements of\nlogic and counting in formal systems, on rethinking the\nqualitative/quantitative divide, and on connecting our analysis to empirical\nfindings in cognitive science.",

While previous investigations have\nfocused mainly on the intensity characteristics of optical cirrus, their\nmorphological properties remain largely unexplored. In this study, we employ\nseveral complementary statistical approaches -- local intensity statistics,\nangular power spectrum / $\\Delta$-variance analysis, and Wavelet Scattering\nTransform analysis -- to characterize the morphology of cirrus in deep optical\nimaging data. We place our investigation of optical cirrus into a\nmulti-wavelength context by comparing the morphology of cirrus seen with the\nDragonfly Telephoto Array to that seen with space-based facilities working at\nlonger wavelengths (Herschel 250~$\\mu m$, WISE 12~$\\mu m$, and Planck\nradiance), as well as with structures seen in the DHIGLS {\\HI} column density\nmap. Our statistical methods quantify the similarities and the differences of\ncirrus morphology in all these datasets. The morphology of cirrus at visible\nwavelengths resembles that of far-infrared cirrus more closely than that of\nmid-infrared cirrus; on small scales, anisotropies in the cosmic infrared\nbackground and systematics may lead to differences. Across all dust tracers,\ncirrus morphology can be well described by a power spectrum with a common\npower-law index $\\gamma\\sim-2.9$. We demonstrate quantitatively that optical\ncirrus exhibits filamentary, coherent structures across a broad range of\nangular scales. Our results offer promising avenues for linking the analysis of\ncoherent structures in optical cirrus to the underlying physical processes in\nthe ISM that shape them. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these morphological\nsignatures can be leveraged to distinguish and disentangle cirrus from\nextragalactic light.",

In this work,\nwe consider the ways in which we must shift from a prediction-focused paradigm\nto an interventionist paradigm when considering the impact of ADS within social\nsystems. We argue this requires a new default problem setup for ADS beyond\nprediction, to instead consider predictions as decision support, final\ndecisions, and outcomes. We highlight how this perspective unifies modern\nstatistical frameworks and other tools to study the design, implementation, and\nevaluation of ADS systems, and point to the research directions necessary to\noperationalize this paradigm shift. Using these tools, we characterize the\nlimitations of focusing on isolated prediction tasks, and lay the foundation\nfor a more intervention-oriented approach to developing and deploying ADS.",

    "abstract": "Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the most powerful transient objects in the\nUniverse, and they are a primary target for the MAGIC Collaboration.\nRecognizing the challenges of observing these elusive objects with Imaging\nAtmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs), we implemented a dedicated\nobservational strategy that included an automated procedure for rapid\nre-pointing to transient sources. Since 2013, this automated procedure has\nenabled MAGIC to observe GRBs at a rate of approximately ten per year, which\nled to the successful detection of two GRBs at very high energies (VHE; E > 100\nGeV). We present a comprehensive analysis of 42 non-detected GRBs (4 short\nGRBs) observed by MAGIC from 2013 to 2019. We derived upper limits (ULs) on the\nobserved energy flux as well as on the intrinsic energy flux corrected for\nabsorption by the extragalactic background light (EBL) from the MAGIC\nobservations in selected energy and time intervals. We conducted a\ncomprehensive study of their properties to investigate the reasons for these\nnon-detections, including the possible peculiar properties of TeV-detected\nGRBs. We find that strong EBL absorption significantly hinders TeV detection\nfor the majority of GRBs in our sample. For a subset of 6 GRBs with redshift z\n< 2, we compared the UL on the intrinsic flux in the VHE domain with the\nsimultaneous X-ray flux, which is observed to be at the same level in the\ncurrent population of TeV-detected GRBs. Based on these inferred MAGIC ULs, we\nconclude that a VHE component with a luminosity comparable to the\nsimultaneously observed X-ray luminosity cannot be ruled out for this sample.",

    "abstract": "Modern applications routinely collect high-dimensional data, leading to\nstatistical models having more parameters than there are samples available. A\ncommon solution is to impose sparsity in parameter estimation, often using\npenalized optimization methods. Bayesian approaches provide a probabilistic\nframework to formally quantify uncertainty through shrinkage priors. Among\nthese, the Dirichlet-Laplace prior has attained recognition for its theoretical\nguarantees and wide applicability. This article identifies a critical yet\noverlooked issue in the implementation of Gibbs sampling algorithms for such\npriors. We demonstrate that ambiguities in the presentation of key algorithmic\nsteps, while mathematically coherent, have led to widespread implementation\ninaccuracies that fail to target the intended posterior distribution -- a\ntarget endowed with rigorous asymptotic guarantees. Using the normal-means\nproblem and high-dimensional linear regressions as canonical examples, we\nclarify these implementation pitfalls and their practical consequences and\npropose corrected and more efficient sampling procedures.",

This yields a new nonparametric method for overcoming\nselection bias in the absence of instrumental variables, panel data, or other\npopular research designs for causal inference. The method leverages the change\nof variables theorem from integration theory, relating the selection bias to\nthe ratio of the density of the treatment and the density of the part of the\noutcome that varies with confounders. At the bunching point, the treatment\nlevel is constant, so the variation in the outcomes is due entirely to\nunobservables, allowing us to identify the denominator. Our main result\nidentifies the average causal response to the treatment among individuals who\nmarginally select into the bunching point.

However, in this work, we show that hierarchical subtraction can\nachieve accurate results with a sufficient number of iterations, and on the\nother hand, neural density estimators, being able to generate posterior samples\nrapidly, make it possible to perform signal subtraction and inference\nrepeatedly.

    "abstract": "Hot Jupiters (HJs) are commonly thought to host the strongest\ndynamo-generated magnetic fields among exoplanets, up to one order of magnitude\nlarger than Jupiter. Thus, they have often been regarded as the most promising\nexoplanets to display magnetic star-planet interaction signals and\nmagnetically-driven coherent radio emission, which unfortunately remains\nelusive, despite many diversified observational campaigns. In this work, we\ninvestigate the evolution of the internal convection and dynamo properties of\nHJs via one-dimensional models. We explore the dependency on orbital distance,\nplanetary and stellar masses, and types of heat injection. We employ\none-dimensional evolutionary models to obtain internal convective structures.\nSpecifically, we obtain the Rossby number $\\mathrm{Ro}$ as a function of\nplanetary depth and orbital period, after showing that tidal synchronization is\nlikely valid for all HJs. When the heat is applied uniformly, the convective\nlayers of almost all HJs remain in the fast rotator regime, $\\mathrm{Ro}\n\\lesssim 0.1$, except possibly the most massive planets with large orbital\ndistances (but still tidally locked). We recover magnetic field strengths for\ninflated HJs by applying well-known scaling laws for fast rotators. When strong\nheat sources are applied mostly in the outer envelope and outside the dynamo\nregion, as realistic Ohmic models predict, convection in the dynamo region\noften breaks down. Consequently, the heat flux and the derived surface magnetic\nfields can be greatly reduced to or below Jovian values, contrary to what is\ncommonly assumed, thus negatively affecting estimates for coherent radio\nemission, and possibly explaining the failure in detecting it so far.",

Just as a user selects a relevant document from a ranked\nlist of retrieved ones, a software generation workflow requires a developer to\nchoose (and potentially refine) a generated solution from a ranked list of\nalternative solutions, ordered by their posterior likelihoods. This implies\nthat estimating the quality of a ranked list -- akin to estimating \"relevance\"\nfor query performance prediction (QPP) in IR -- is also crucial for generative\nsoftware development, where quality is defined in terms of \"functional\ncorrectness\". In this paper, we propose an in-context learning (ICL) based\napproach for code quality estimation. Our findings demonstrate that providing\nfew-shot examples of functionally correct code from a training set enhances the\nperformance of existing QPP approaches as well as a zero-shot-based approach\nfor code quality estimation.",

However, collecting such embodied\ndata remains costly and inefficient. As a result, simulation environments have\nbecome a crucial surrogate for training robot policies. Yet, the significant\nReal2Sim2Real gap remains a critical bottleneck, particularly in terms of\nphysical dynamics and visual appearance. To address this challenge, we propose\nEmbodieDreamer, a novel framework that reduces the Real2Sim2Real gap from both\nthe physics and appearance perspectives. Specifically, we propose PhysAligner,\na differentiable physics module designed to reduce the Real2Sim physical gap.\nIt jointly optimizes robot-specific parameters such as control gains and\nfriction coefficients to better align simulated dynamics with real-world\nobservations. In addition, we introduce VisAligner, which incorporates a\nconditional video diffusion model to bridge the Sim2Real appearance gap by\ntranslating low-fidelity simulated renderings into photorealistic videos\nconditioned on simulation states, enabling high-fidelity visual transfer.\nExtensive experiments validate the effectiveness of EmbodieDreamer. The\nproposed PhysAligner reduces physical parameter estimation error by 3.74%\ncompared to simulated annealing methods while improving optimization speed by\n89.91\\%. Moreover, training robot policies in the generated photorealistic\nenvironment leads to a 29.17% improvement in the average task success rate\nacross real-world tasks after reinforcement learning.

    "abstract": "We offer a novel perspective on reward modeling by formulating it as a policy\ndiscriminator, which quantifies the difference between two policies to generate\na reward signal, guiding the training policy towards a target policy with\ndesired behaviors. Based on this conceptual insight, we propose a scalable\npre-training method named Policy Discriminative Learning (POLAR), which trains\na reward model (RM) to discern identical policies and discriminate different\nones. Unlike traditional reward modeling methods relying on absolute\npreferences, POLAR captures the relative difference between one policy and an\narbitrary target policy, which is a scalable, high-level optimization objective\nsuitable for modeling generic ranking relationships. Leveraging the POLAR\npre-training paradigm, we present a series of RMs with parameter scales from\n1.8B to 7B. Empirical results show that POLAR substantially outperforms\ntraditional non-pre-trained methods, significantly enhancing RM performance.\nFor instance, POLAR-7B could improve preference accuracy from 54.8% to 81.0% on\nSTEM tasks and from 57.9% to 85.5% on creative writing tasks compared to SOTA\nbaselines. POLAR also shows robust generalization capabilities in RLHF using\nReinforcement Fine-tuning (RFT), providing reliable reward signals and markedly\nenhancing policy performance--improving LLaMa3.1-8B from an average of 47.36%\nto 56.33% and Qwen2.5-32B from 64.49% to 70.47% on 20 benchmarks. Moreover,\nscaling experiments reveal a clear power-law relationship between computation\nand performance, supported by linear correlation coefficients approaching 0.99.\nThe impressive performance, strong generalization, and scaling properties\nsuggest that POLAR is a promising direction for developing general and strong\nreward models.",

For the past five decades,\nsolar polarimetric studies at low radio frequencies have almost always assumed\nthe absence of linear polarization. This has been based on the expectations\nfrom coronal propagation effects. Here we present the first robust evidence of\nlinear polarization from solar emissions at meter wavelengths using\nsimultaneous measurements with two telescopes of very different designs\nseparated by thousands of kilometers - the Murchison Widefield Array and the\nupgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope. Both datasets show consistent linear\npolarization fractions, confirming this detection. Rapid changes in morphology,\nas well as the fractional linear polarization at small time and frequency\nspans, further rule out any possibilities of an instrumental origin. Assuming\nthe absence of linear polarization in solar radio emissions can result in\nincorrect interpretation of solar observations as well as those of other flare\nstars, which are often guided by learnings from solar studies. This discovery\nhighlights the need for relaxing this assumption, and is essential for precise\nestimation of polarization signatures, ultimately leading to a better\nunderstanding of the plasma conditions in the Sun and other stars.",

This dilemma of conflicting\nrankings hampers model selection, clouds model comparisons, and adds confusion\nto a growing ecosystem of competing models. Recent work attributed ranking\ndisagreement to the phenomenon of training on the test task: As released,\ndifferent models exhibit a different level of preparation for any given test\ntask. A candidate solution to the problem is train-before-test: Give each model\nthe same benchmark-specific finetuning before evaluation. Our primary\ncontribution is a broad empirical evaluation of train-before-test across 24\nbenchmarks and 61 models. We show that train-before-test significantly improves\nranking agreement consistently across all benchmarks. Whereas rankings have\nlittle external validity to start with, they enjoy a significant degree of\nexternal validity when applying train-before-test: Model rankings transfer\ngracefully from one benchmark to the other. Even within the same model family,\ntrain-before-test reduces strong ranking disagreement to near-perfect\nagreement. In addition, train-before-test reduces the model-score matrix to\nessentially rank one, revealing new insights into the latent factors of\nbenchmark performance. Our work supports the recommendation to make\ntrain-before-test a default component of LLM benchmarking.",

In\nclinical settings, conventional radiography (CR) is widely used for the\nscreening and evaluation of RA due to its low cost and accessibility. The wrist\nis a critical region for the diagnosis of RA. However, CAD research in this\narea remains limited, primarily due to the challenges in acquiring high-quality\ninstance-level annotations. (i) The wrist comprises numerous small bones with\nnarrow joint spaces, complex structures, and frequent overlaps, requiring\ndetailed anatomical knowledge for accurate annotation. (ii) Disease progression\nin RA often leads to osteophyte, bone erosion (BE), and even bony ankylosis,\nwhich alter bone morphology and increase annotation difficulty, necessitating\nexpertise in rheumatology. This work presents a multi-task dataset for wrist\nbone in CR, including two tasks: (i) wrist bone instance segmentation and (ii)\nSharp/van der Heijde (SvdH) BE scoring, which is the first public resource for\nwrist bone instance segmentation. This dataset comprises 621 wrist conventional\nradiographs of 227 patients from four medical centers, with pixel-level\ninstance segmentation annotations for 443 images and SvdH BE scores for 548\nimages. This dataset can potentially support a wide range of research tasks\nrelated to RA, including joint space narrowing (JSN) progression\nquantification, BE detection, bone deformity evaluation, and osteophyte\ndetection.

    "abstract": "Real-time hair simulation is a vital component in creating believable virtual\navatars, as it provides a sense of immersion and authenticity. The dynamic\nbehavior of hair, such as bouncing or swaying in response to character\nmovements like jumping or walking, plays a significant role in enhancing the\noverall realism and engagement of virtual experiences. Current methods for\nsimulating hair have been constrained by two primary approaches: highly\noptimized physics-based systems and neural methods. However, state-of-the-art\nneural techniques have been limited to quasi-static solutions, failing to\ncapture the dynamic behavior of hair. This paper introduces a novel neural\nmethod that breaks through these limitations, achieving efficient and stable\ndynamic hair simulation while outperforming existing approaches. We propose a\nfully self-supervised method which can be trained without any manual\nintervention or artist generated training data allowing the method to be\nintegrated with hair reconstruction methods to enable automatic end-to-end\nmethods for avatar reconstruction. Our approach harnesses the power of compact,\nmemory-efficient neural networks to simulate hair at the strand level, allowing\nfor the simulation of diverse hairstyles without excessive computational\nresources or memory requirements.

Current approaches to value alignment, which rely on centralized,\ntop-down definitions, lack the mechanisms for meaningful contestability. This\nleaves users and communities unable to challenge or shape the values embedded\nin the systems that govern their digital lives, creating a crisis of legitimacy\nand trust. This paper introduces Community-Defined AI Value Pluralism (CDAVP),\na socio-technical framework that addresses this gap. It reframes the design\nproblem from achieving a single aligned state to infrastructuring a dynamic\necosystem for value deliberation and application. At its core, CDAVP enables\ndiverse, self-organizing communities to define and maintain explicit value\nprofiles - rich, machine-readable representations that can encompass not only\npreferences but also community-specific rights and duties. These profiles are\nthen contextually activated by the end-user, who retains ultimate control\n(agency) over which values guide the AI's behavior. AI applications, in turn,\nare designed to transparently interpret these profiles and moderate conflicts,\nadhering to a set of non-negotiable, democratically-legitimated meta-rules. The\ndesigner's role shifts from crafting static interfaces to becoming an architect\nof participatory ecosystems.

A widely\nrecognized framework for deriving such representations is the information\nbottleneck method, which yields the optimal strategy for encoding a random\nvariable, such as the signal, in a way that preserves maximal information about\na functionally relevant variable, subject to an explicit constraint on the\namount of information encoded. While in its general formulation the method is\nnumerical, it admits an analytical solution in an important special case where\nthe variables involved are jointly Gaussian. In this setting, the solution\npredicts discrete transitions in the dimensionality of the optimal\nrepresentation as the encoding capacity is increased. Although these signature\ntransitions, along with other features of the optimal strategy, can be derived\nfrom a constrained optimization problem, a clear and intuitive understanding of\ntheir emergence is still lacking. In our work, we advance our understanding of\nthe Gaussian information bottleneck method through multiple mutually enriching\nperspectives, including geometric and information-theoretic ones. These\nperspectives offer novel intuition about the set of optimal encoding\ndirections, the nature of the critical points where the optimal number of\nencoding components changes, and about the way the optimal strategy navigates\nbetween these critical points. We then apply our treatment of the method to a\npreviously studied signal prediction problem, obtaining new insights on how\ndifferent features of the signal are encoded across multiple components to\nenable optimal prediction of future signals. Altogether, our work deepens the\nfoundational understanding of the information bottleneck method in the Gaussian\nsetting, motivating the exploration of analogous perspectives in broader,\nnon-Gaussian contexts.",

The physical and mental burden of this task is considerable, and\nrecent challenges such as the growing shortage of nurses and increasingly\ndiverse working styles have further complicated the scheduling process.\nConsequently, there is a growing demand for automated nurse scheduling systems.\nTechnically, modern integer programming solvers can generate feasible schedules\nwithin a practical timeframe.

This is largely because tacit knowledge, considerations\nunconsciously applied by head nurses, cannot be fully formalized into explicit\nconstraints, often resulting in automatically generated schedules that are not\npractically usable. To address this issue, we propose a novel \"two-stage\nscheduling method.\" This approach divides the scheduling task into night shift\nand day shift stages, allowing head nurses to make manual adjustments after the\nfirst stage. This interactive process makes it possible to produce nurse\nschedules that are suitable for real-world implementation.

In addition to good neutron-gamma discrimination, this setup\nallows the detector to be highly segmented; the basic detection unit is a 5 cm\ncube. High segmentation provides numerous advantages including precise\nlocalisation of the Inverse Beta Decay (IBD) products, the derivation of an\nantineutrino energy estimator based on the isolated positron energy, and a\npowerful background reduction tool that relies on the topological signature of\nthe signal. Finally, the system is read out by a network of WLS fibres coupled\nto photosensors. A relative electromagnetic calibration is performed with\nhorizontal cosmic muons. This source poses the simplest calibration problem in\nwhich a single detection unit is involved. In addition, large muon energy\ndeposits allow us to perform a calibration at the most detailed level (i.e. per\nfibre) and to accurately define the fraction of energy escaping to neighbouring\ndetection cells. A statistical precision at the sub-percent level is reached.\nThe paper also discusses two methods to calibrate the absolute energy scale.\nThe first method relies on horizontal muons, though the precision is limited to\naround 10\\% because of the uncertainty in the energy distribution of such\nmuons.

We implement and\nevaluate several state-of-the-art LLM-based multi-agent Agentic AI frameworks,\nuncovering significant performance gaps that highlight the unsolved challenges\nin large-scale coordination, communication, spatial reasoning, and long-horizon\nplanning under uncertainty. By providing more realistic complexity, scalable\narchitecture, and behavioral evaluation metrics, CREW-Wildfire establishes a\ncritical foundation for advancing research in scalable multi-agent Agentic\nintelligence.

    "abstract": "Empathetic interaction is a cornerstone of human-machine communication, due\nto the need for understanding speech enriched with paralinguistic cues and\ngenerating emotional and expressive responses. However, the most powerful\nempathetic LSLMs are increasingly closed off, leaving the crucial details about\nthe architecture, data and development opaque to researchers. Given the\ncritical need for transparent research into the LSLMs and empathetic behavior,\nwe present OpenS2S, a fully open-source, transparent and end-to-end LSLM\ndesigned to enable empathetic speech interactions. Based on our empathetic\nspeech-to-text model BLSP-Emo, OpenS2S further employs a streaming interleaved\ndecoding architecture to achieve low-latency speech generation. To facilitate\nend-to-end training, OpenS2S incorporates an automated data construction\npipeline that synthesizes diverse, high-quality empathetic speech dialogues at\nlow cost. By leveraging large language models to generate empathetic content\nand controllable text-to-speech systems to introduce speaker and emotional\nvariation, we construct a scalable training corpus with rich paralinguistic\ndiversity and minimal human supervision. We release the fully open-source\nOpenS2S model, including the dataset, model weights, pre-training and\nfine-tuning codes, to empower the broader research community and accelerate\ninnovation in empathetic speech systems.

    "abstract": "Major advertising platforms recently increased privacy protections by\nlimiting advertisers' access to individual-level data. Instead of providing\naccess to granular raw data, the platforms only allow a limited number of\naggregate queries to a dataset, which is further protected by adding\ndifferentially private noise. This paper studies whether and how advertisers\ncan design effective targeting policies within these restrictive privacy\npreserving data environments. To achieve this, I develop a probabilistic\nmachine learning method based on Bayesian optimization, which facilitates\ndynamic data exploration. Since Bayesian optimization was designed to sample\npoints from a function to find its maximum, it is not applicable to aggregate\nqueries and to targeting. Therefore, I introduce two innovations: (i) integral\nupdating of posteriors which allows to select the best regions of the data to\nquery rather than individual points and (ii) a targeting-aware acquisition\nfunction that dynamically selects the most informative regions for the\ntargeting task. I identify the conditions of the dataset and privacy\nenvironment that necessitate the use of such a \"smart\" querying strategy. I\napply the strategic querying method to the Criteo AI Labs dataset for uplift\nmodeling (Diemert et al., 2018) that contains visit and conversion data from\n14M users. I show that an intuitive benchmark strategy only achieves 33% of the\nnon-privacy-preserving targeting potential in some cases, while my strategic\nquerying method achieves 97-101% of that potential, and is statistically\nindistinguishable from Causal Forest (Athey et al., 2019): a state-of-the-art\nnon-privacy-preserving machine learning targeting method.",

    "abstract": "Generating intermediate video content of varying lengths based on given first\nand last frames, along with text prompt information, offers significant\nresearch and application potential. However, traditional frame interpolation\ntasks primarily focus on scenarios with a small number of frames, no text\ncontrol, and minimal differences between the first and last frames. Recent\ncommunity developers have utilized large video models represented by Wan to\nendow frame-to-frame capabilities. However, these models can only generate a\nfixed number of frames and often fail to produce satisfactory results for\ncertain frame lengths, while this setting lacks a clear official definition and\na well-established benchmark. In this paper, we first propose a new practical\nSemantic Frame Interpolation (SFI) task from the perspective of academic\ndefinition, which covers the above two settings and supports inference at\nmultiple frame rates. To achieve this goal, we propose a novel SemFi model\nbuilding upon Wan2.1, which incorporates a Mixture-of-LoRA module to ensure the\ngeneration of high-consistency content that aligns with control conditions\nacross various frame length limitations. Furthermore, we propose SFI-300K, the\nfirst general-purpose dataset and benchmark specifically designed for SFI. To\nsupport this, we collect and process data from the perspective of SFI,\ncarefully designing evaluation metrics and methods to assess the model's\nperformance across multiple dimensions, encompassing image and video, and\nvarious aspects, including consistency and diversity. Through extensive\nexperiments on SFI-300K, we demonstrate that our method is particularly\nwell-suited to meet the requirements of the SFI task.",

Accurate\nmodeling of this current is essential for understanding the magnetohydrodynamic\n(MHD) equilibrium and stability of these configurations. This study expands the\nmodeling capabilities of M3D-C1, an extended-MHD code, by implementing\nself-consistent physics models for bootstrap current. It employs two analytical\nframeworks: a generalized Sauter model (Sauter et al. (1999)), and a revised\nSauter-like model (Redl et al. (2021)). The isomorphism described by Landreman\net al. (2022) is employed to apply these models to quasisymmetric stellarators.\nThe implementation in M3D-C1 is benchmarked against neoclassical codes,\nincluding NEO, XGCa, and SFINCS, showing excellent agreement. These\nimprovements allow M3D-C1 to self-consistently calculate the neoclassical\ncontributions to plasma current in axisymmetric and quasisymmetric\nconfigurations, providing a more accurate representation of the plasma behavior\nin these configurations. A workflow for evaluating the neoclassical transport\nusing SFINCS with arbitrary toroidal equilibria calculated using M3D-C1 is also\npresented. This workflow enables a quantitative evaluation of the error in the\nSauter-like model in cases that deviate from axi- or quasi-symmetry (e.g.,\nthrough the development of an MHD instability).",

    "abstract": "Social networks can be a valuable source of information during crisis events.\nIn particular, users can post a stream of multimodal data that can be critical\nfor real-time humanitarian response. However, effectively extracting meaningful\ninformation from this large and noisy data stream and effectively integrating\nheterogeneous data remains a formidable challenge. In this work, we explore\nvision language models (VLMs) and advanced fusion strategies to enhance the\nclassification of crisis data in three different tasks. We incorporate\nLLaVA-generated text to improve text-image alignment. Additionally, we leverage\nContrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP)-based vision and text embeddings,\nwhich, without task-specific fine-tuning, outperform traditional models. To\nfurther refine multimodal fusion, we employ Guided Cross Attention (Guided CA)\nand combine it with the Differential Attention mechanism to enhance feature\nalignment by emphasizing critical information while filtering out irrelevant\ncontent. Our results show that while Differential Attention improves\nclassification performance, Guided CA remains highly effective in aligning\nmultimodal features. Extensive experiments on the CrisisMMD benchmark data set\ndemonstrate that the combination of pretrained VLMs, enriched textual\ndescriptions, and adaptive fusion strategies consistently outperforms\nstate-of-the-art models in classification accuracy, contributing to more\nreliable and interpretable models for three different tasks that are crucial\nfor disaster response.

    "abstract": "In this chapter, we utilize dynamical systems to analyze several aspects of\nmachine learning algorithms. As an expository contribution we demonstrate how\nto re-formulate a wide variety of challenges from deep neural networks,\n(stochastic) gradient descent, and related topics into dynamical statements. We\nalso tackle three concrete challenges. First, we consider the process of\ninformation propagation through a neural network, i.e., we study the\ninput-output map for different architectures. We explain the universal\nembedding property for augmented neural ODEs representing arbitrary functions\nof given regularity, the classification of multilayer perceptrons and neural\nODEs in terms of suitable function classes, and the memory-dependence in neural\ndelay equations. Second, we consider the training aspect of neural networks\ndynamically. We describe a dynamical systems perspective on gradient descent\nand study stability for overdetermined problems. We then extend this analysis\nto the overparameterized setting and describe the edge of stability phenomenon,\nalso in the context of possible explanations for implicit bias. For stochastic\ngradient descent, we present stability results for the overparameterized\nsetting via Lyapunov exponents of interpolation solutions. Third, we explain\nseveral results regarding mean-field limits of neural networks. We describe a\nresult that extends existing techniques to heterogeneous neural networks\ninvolving graph limits via digraph measures. This shows how large classes of\nneural networks naturally fall within the framework of Kuramoto-type models on\ngraphs and their large-graph limits. Finally, we point out that similar\nstrategies to use dynamics to study explainable and reliable AI can also be\napplied to settings such as generative models or fundamental issues in gradient\ntraining methods, such as backpropagation or vanishing/exploding gradients.",

However, the\nmajority of 4D capture systems are limited to frame rates below 30 FPS (frames\nper second), and a direct 4D reconstruction of high-speed motion from low FPS\ninput may lead to undesirable results. In this work, we propose a high-speed 4D\ncapturing system only using low FPS cameras, through novel capturing and\nprocessing modules. On the capturing side, we propose an asynchronous capture\nscheme that increases the effective frame rate by staggering the start times of\ncameras. By grouping cameras and leveraging a base frame rate of 25 FPS, our\nmethod achieves an equivalent frame rate of 100-200 FPS without requiring\nspecialized high-speed cameras. On processing side, we also propose a novel\ngenerative model to fix artifacts caused by 4D sparse-view reconstruction, as\nasynchrony reduces the number of viewpoints at each timestamp. Specifically, we\npropose to train a video-diffusion-based artifact-fix model for sparse 4D\nreconstruction, which refines missing details, maintains temporal consistency,\nand improves overall reconstruction quality. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat our method significantly enhances high-speed 4D reconstruction compared to\nsynchronous capture.",

Recent theoretical studies suggest that intrinsic\nantisite defects push the topological surface state away from the MBT surface,\nclosing its gap and making it less accessible to scanning probe experiments.\nHere, we report on the local effect of defects on the MBT surface states and\ndemonstrate that high defect concentrations lead to a displacement of the\nsurface states well into the MBT crystal, validating the theorized mechanism.\nThe local and global influence of antisite defects on the topological surface\nstates are studied with samples of varying defect densities by combining\nscanning tunneling microscopy (STM), angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES), and\ndensity functional theory (DFT).

While general-purpose FMs such as GPT-4 and Gemini have\ndemonstrated promising performance in tasks ranging from financial report\nsummarization to sentiment-aware forecasting, many financial applications\nremain constrained by unique domain requirements such as multimodal reasoning,\nregulatory compliance, and data privacy. These challenges have spurred the\nemergence of Financial Foundation Models (FFMs) - a new class of models\nexplicitly designed for finance. This survey presents a comprehensive overview\nof FFMs, with a taxonomy spanning three key modalities: Financial Language\nFoundation Models (FinLFMs), Financial Time-Series Foundation Models\n(FinTSFMs), and Financial Visual-Language Foundation Models (FinVLFMs). We\nreview their architectures, training methodologies, datasets, and real-world\napplications. Furthermore, we identify critical challenges in data\navailability, algorithmic scalability, and infrastructure constraints, and\noffer insights into future research opportunities. We hope this survey serves\nas both a comprehensive reference for understanding FFMs and a practical\nroadmap for future innovation.

    "abstract": "The interaction of light with optical and mechanical systems is influenced by\nmaterial properties, geometrical configurations, and surface topographies.\nDesigning these systems necessitates a careful balance of conflicting\nrequirements, such as minimising size and weight while simultaneously improving\nheat transfer and reducing stray light from illuminated peripheral mounting\nsurfaces. Stray light is typically mitigated by apertures, coatings, and\nmicroscopic structures, alongside maintaining cleanliness. However, using\napertures may not always be feasible, and effective optical absorber coatings\nor microscopic light absorbing structures can be costly and sensitive to\nenvironmental factors such as abrasion, radiation heating, or cleaning agents.\n  In a proof-of-concept investigation, we design and analyse macroscopic\nstructural light absorbers realised as periodic minimal surface approximations\nand quasi-stochastic lattices. The term \"macroscopic\" refers to minimal\nstructural dimensions of approximately 100 micrometres. By increasing the\nnumber of reflections before residual reflected light reaches a hemispherical\nreceiver, we achieve reductions in received peak intensities by factors of less\nthan 0.39 and average intensities by factors of less than 0.65, without\naltering the surface properties.\n  Macroscopic structural light absorbers support cost-effective and robust\nlight-absorbing materials, such as black anodised aluminium or ABS polymers,\nwhile still achieving satisfactory stray light suppression. This approach is\napplicable to aerospace optical systems (such as telescopes and imaging\nspectrometers), as well as general scientific and industrial optical\ninstruments and commercial products (including projectors and luminaires). The\ndemonstrated structures can be sustainably fabricated through additive\nmanufacturing processes like laser powder bed fusion.",

Engineering quantities of interest\ntypically take the form of time-average statistics such as $ \\frac{1}{t}\n\\int_0^t f ( u(x,\\tau; \\theta) ) d\\tau \\overset{t \\rightarrow\n\\infty}{\\rightarrow} F(x; \\theta)$, where $u(x,t; \\theta)$ are solutions of the\nNavier--Stokes equations with parameters $\\theta$. Optimizing over $F(x;\n\\theta)$ has many engineering applications including geometric optimization,\nflow control, and closure modeling. However, this remains an open challenge, as\nexisting computational approaches are incapable of scaling to physically\nrepresentative numbers of grid points. The fundamental obstacle is the\nchaoticity of turbulent flows: gradients calculated with the adjoint method\ndiverge exponentially as $t \\rightarrow \\infty$.\n  We develop a new online gradient-flow (OGF) method that is scalable to large\ndegree-of-freedom systems and enables optimizing for the steady-state\nstatistics of chaotic, unsteady, turbulence-resolving simulations. The method\nforward-propagates an online estimate for the gradient of $F(x; \\theta)$ while\nsimultaneously performing online updates of the parameters $\\theta$. A key\nfeature is the fully online nature of the algorithm to facilitate faster\noptimization progress and its combination with a finite-difference estimator to\navoid the divergence of gradients due to chaoticity. The proposed OGF method is\ndemonstrated for optimizations over three chaotic ordinary and partial\ndifferential equations: the Lorenz-63 equation, the Kuramoto--Sivashinsky\nequation, and Navier--Stokes solutions of compressible, forced, homogeneous\nisotropic turbulence. In each case, the OGF method successfully reduces the\nloss based on $F(x; \\theta)$ by several orders of magnitude and accurately\nrecovers the optimal parameters.",

This framework: (1) trains a\nspecific class of hardware-efficient \\emph{deterministic} PCs, chosen for the\nsymbolic task; (2) \\emph{compresses} this PC until it can be computed on TinyML\nhardware with minimal accuracy degradation, using our $n^{th}$-root compression\ntechnique, and (3) \\emph{deploys} the complete NSAI model on TinyML hardware.\nCompared to a 64b precision baseline necessary for the PC without compression,\nour workflow leads to significant hardware reduction on FPGA (up to 82.3\\% in\nFF, 52.6\\% in LUTs, and 18.0\\% in Flash usage) and an average inference speedup\nof 4.67x on ESP32 microcontroller.",

Given that high circular polarization ($>90$\\%) has been observed in\nFRB~20201124A and in some giant pulses of PSR~B1937+21, we discuss the\nimplications of the high circular polarization of CHIME J1634+44 and conclude\nits emission mechanism is likely to be ``pulsar-like''. While CHIME J1634+44\nhas a pulse period of 841 s, its burst arrival patterns are indicative of a\nsecondary 4206 s period, probably associated with binary activity. The timing\nproperties suggest it has a significantly negative period derivative of\n$\\dot{P}=-9.03(0.11)\\times 10^{-12}$ s s$^{-1}$. Few systems have been known to\nspin-up, most notably transitional millisecond pulsars and cataclysmic\nbinaries, both of which seem unlikely progenitors for CHIME J1634+44. If the\nperiod was only associated with the spin of the object, then the spin up is\nlikely generated by accretion of material from a companion. If, however, the\nradio pulse period and the orbital period are locked, as appears to be the case\nfor two other LPTs, the spin up of CHIME J1634+44 could be driven by\ngravitational wave radiation.",

To address these challenges, we propose LERa - Look,\nExplain, Replan - a Visual Language Model-based replanning approach that\nutilizes visual feedback. Unlike existing methods, LERa requires only a raw RGB\nimage, a natural language instruction, an initial task plan, and failure\ndetection - without additional information such as object detection or\npredefined conditions that may be unavailable in a given scenario. The\nreplanning process consists of three steps: (i) Look, where LERa generates a\nscene description and identifies errors; (ii) Explain, where it provides\ncorrective guidance; and (iii) Replan, where it modifies the plan accordingly.\nLERa is adaptable to various agent architectures and can handle errors from\nboth dynamic scene changes and task execution failures. We evaluate LERa on the\nnewly introduced ALFRED-ChaOS and VirtualHome-ChaOS datasets, achieving a 40%\nimprovement over baselines in dynamic environments. In tabletop manipulation\ntasks with a predefined probability of task failure within the PyBullet\nsimulator, LERa improves success rates by up to 67%.

    "abstract": "Estimating causal effects in quasi-experiments with spatio-temporal panel\ndata often requires adjusting for unmeasured confounding that varies across\nspace and time. Gaussian Processes (GPs) offer a flexible, nonparametric\nmodeling approach that can account for such complex dependencies through\ncarefully chosen covariance kernels. In this paper, we provide a practical and\ninterpretable framework for applying GPs to causal inference in panel data\nsettings. We demonstrate how GPs generalize popular methods such as synthetic\ncontrol and vertical regression, and we show that the GP posterior mean can be\nrepresented as a weighted average of observed outcomes, where the weights\nreflect spatial and temporal similarity.

    "abstract": "Logical rule learning, a prominent category of knowledge graph (KG) reasoning\nmethods, constitutes a critical research area aimed at learning explicit rules\nfrom observed facts to infer missing knowledge. However, like all KG reasoning\nmethods, rule learning suffers from a critical weakness-its dependence on the\nI.I.D. assumption. This assumption can easily be violated due to selection bias\nduring training or agnostic distribution shifts during testing (e.g., as in\nquery shift scenarios), ultimately undermining model performance and\nreliability. To enable robust KG reasoning in wild environments, this study\ninvestigates logical rule learning in the presence of agnostic test-time\ndistribution shifts. We formally define this challenge as out-of-distribution\n(OOD) KG reasoning-a previously underexplored problem, and propose the Stable\nRule Learning (StableRule) framework as a solution. StableRule is an end-to-end\nframework that combines feature decorrelation with rule learning network, to\nenhance OOD generalization in KG reasoning. By leveraging feature\ndecorrelation, StableRule mitigates the adverse effects of covariate shifts\narising in OOD scenarios, improving the robustness of the rule learning\nnetwork. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark KGs demonstrate the\nframework's superior effectiveness and stability across diverse heterogeneous\nenvironments, highlighting its practical significance for real-world\napplications.",

    "abstract": "Juno and Cassini have shown that Jupiter and Saturn likely contain extended\ngradients of heavy elements. Yet, how these gradients can survive over billions\nof years remains an open question. Classical convection theories predict rapid\nmixing and homogenization, which would erase such gradients on timescales far\nshorter than the planets' ages. To address this, we estimate the energy\nrequired to erode both dense and fuzzy cores, and compare it to what the planet\ncan realistically supply. If the entire cooling budget is available to drive\nmixing, then even a compact core can, in principle, be destroyed. But if mixing\nis limited to the thermal energy near the core, which is another plausible\nscenario, the energy falls short. In that case, Jupiter can erode a fuzzy core\nby up to approximately $10~\\mearth$, but a compact one remains intact. Saturn's\ncore is more robust. Even in the fuzzy case, only about $1~\\mearth$ is lost,\nand if the core is compact, erosion is negligible. The outcome depends\nsensitively on the assumed initial temperature and entropy profiles. Hotter and\nmore superadiabatic interiors are more prone to mixing. We suggest that 3D\nsimulations of convection driven from above, with realistic stratification and\nenough depth (i.e., many density scale heights) would be of great interest to\nfurther constrain the energy budget for core erosion.",

    "abstract": "Accurate trajectory prediction is critical for safe autonomous navigation,\nyet the impact of dataset design on model performance remains understudied.\nThis work systematically examines how feature selection, cross-dataset\ntransfer, and geographic diversity influence trajectory prediction accuracy in\nmulti-agent settings. We evaluate a state-of-the-art model using our novel L4\nMotion Forecasting dataset based on our own data recordings in Germany and the\nUS. This includes enhanced map and agent features. We compare our dataset to\nthe US-centric Argoverse 2 benchmark. First, we find that incorporating\nsupplementary map and agent features unique to our dataset, yields no\nmeasurable improvement over baseline features, demonstrating that modern\narchitectures do not need extensive feature sets for optimal performance. The\nlimited features of public datasets are sufficient to capture convoluted\ninteractions without added complexity. Second, we perform cross-dataset\nexperiments to evaluate how effective domain knowledge can be transferred\nbetween datasets. Third, we group our dataset by country and check the\nknowledge transfer between different driving cultures.",

      "Alexander Migdal"
    ],
    "abstract": "We construct an exact solution to the planar QCD loop equation in\nfour-dimensional Euclidean space using a novel matrix-valued momentum loop\nformalism. Central to this construction is a new loop calculus, in which\nfunctional derivatives act directly on the loop velocity $ \\dot{C}(\\theta) $.\nThis framework yields finite, well-defined expressions for point and area\nderivatives in loop space and reveals the role of the loop-space Bianchi\nidentity in ensuring gauge consistency.\n  The Wilson loop is expressed as an average over matrix-valued momentum loops\n$ P(\\theta) $ tracing closed paths in a compact complex manifold, constrained\nby self-duality and boundary conditions. Self-duality dynamically nullifies the\nclassical Yang--Mills term in the loop equation, while the boundary constraints\neliminate the contact terms in the planar ($ N \\to \\infty$)) limit. Thus, the\nfull planar QCD loop equation is satisfied exactly and without modification.\n  We further argue that these random walks define a self-dual minimal surface\nin an extended matrix space, and \\textbf{prove} that the area of this matrix\nminimal surface scales proportionally to the Euclidean minimal area bounded by\nthe same loop $ C $, thereby providing a sufficient condition for quark\nconfinement. In the example of an circular loop, we construct the exact surface\nand compute its area analytically, finding that it equals the Euclidean area\nmultiplied by a universal factor of $ 6 \\sqrt{2}$.\n  These results provide the first known explicit construction of a\nquark-confining minimal surface that solves the planar QCD loop equation\nexactly, and open a new path toward understanding gauge--string duality from\nfirst principles.",

    "abstract": "The bulk-boundary correspondence, which relates topological properties of a\nmaterial in the bulk to the presence of robust modes localized on the edge, is\nat the core of the now mature field of topological wave physics. More recently,\nit was realized that in crystalline structures, certain types of defects can\nhost localized modes, in which case the bulk-boundary correspondence has to be\nreplaced by a bulk-defect correspondence. These defect-localized modes are\nexpected to have robust properties owing to their topological origin. In this\nwork, we show how to obtain topological defect modes in a lattice possessing\nboth mirror and chiral symmetry. The defect is obtained by endowing a plaquette\nwith a non-trivial gauge flux. We show that the bulk-defect correspondence is\nsatisfied by introducing appropriate topological invariants. Moreover, the\ntopological defect modes are shown to be highly robust to the introduction of\nsymmetry-preserving disorder. The model is then realized in an acoustic system\nmade of a network of tubes, and the presence of topological defect mode is\nexperimentally clearly demonstrated.",

This paper exposes a critical security gap at the data loading\nstage, where malicious actors can stealthily corrupt RAG pipelines by\nexploiting document ingestion.\n  We propose a taxonomy of 9 knowledge-based poisoning attacks and introduce\ntwo novel threat vectors -- Content Obfuscation and Content Injection --\ntargeting common formats (DOCX, HTML, PDF). Using an automated toolkit\nimplementing 19 stealthy injection techniques, we test five popular data\nloaders, finding a 74.4% attack success rate across 357 scenarios. We further\nvalidate these threats on six end-to-end RAG systems -- including white-box\npipelines and black-box services like NotebookLM and OpenAI Assistants --\ndemonstrating high success rates and critical vulnerabilities that bypass\nfilters and silently compromise output integrity.

    "abstract": "Audio-driven talking head generation is critical for applications such as\nvirtual assistants, video games, and films, where natural lip movements are\nessential. Despite progress in this field, challenges remain in producing both\nconsistent and realistic facial animations. Existing methods, often based on\nGANs or UNet-based diffusion models, face three major limitations: (i) temporal\njittering caused by weak temporal constraints, resulting in frame\ninconsistencies; (ii) identity drift due to insufficient 3D information\nextraction, leading to poor preservation of facial identity; and (iii)\nunnatural blinking behavior due to inadequate modeling of realistic blink\ndynamics. To address these issues, we propose MoDiT, a novel framework that\ncombines the 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) with a Diffusion-based Transformer. Our\ncontributions include: (i) A hierarchical denoising strategy with revised\ntemporal attention and biased self/cross-attention mechanisms, enabling the\nmodel to refine lip synchronization and progressively enhance full-face\ncoherence, effectively mitigating temporal jittering. (ii) The integration of\n3DMM coefficients to provide explicit spatial constraints, ensuring accurate\n3D-informed optical flow prediction and improved lip synchronization using\nWav2Lip results, thereby preserving identity consistency. (iii) A refined\nblinking strategy to model natural eye movements, with smoother and more\nrealistic blinking behaviors.",

During hadronization, different\ntype of hadrons are produced including D mesons and light-flavoured hadrons,\nlike pion ($\\pi$), kaon ($K$), proton ($p$) etc. We can observe different\ninteractions between these hadrons based on the size of collision systems. Such\nas, hadron re-scattering, suppression of charm quarks and collective effects\nare weak or missing in $p+p$ system in comparison to $Au+Au$ or $Pb+Pb$\ncollision system.\n  Femtoscopy is one of the most significant and unique tools for examining the\nfinal state interaction behaviors between correlated pair of particles at low\nmomentum in a pair rest frame. It is also possible to explore the size and\ngeometry of emission source through the measurements of femtoscopic correlation\nfunctions. Here we report the studies of correlations between neutral charmed\nmeson ($D^0$ / $\\overline{D^0}$) and identified charged hadrons ($\\pi^{\\pm}$,\n$K^{\\pm}$, $p^{\\pm}$) in Au+Au collisions at STAR experiment using femtoscopy\ntechnique. This is the first measurement of heavy-flavor femtoscopy in\nheavy-ion collisions at 200 GeV.

    "abstract": "Flexible bandwidth needlets offer a versatile multiscale framework for\nanalyzing functions on the sphere. A key element in their construction is the\ndilation sequence, which controls how the multipole consecutive scales are\nspaced and overlapped. At any resolution level, this sequence determines the\ncenter positions of the needlet weight functions and influences their\nlocalization in the spatial domain and spectral concentration properties by\nmeans of the relative bandwidth ratio. In this paper, we explore the different\nasymptotic regimes that arise when the dilation sequence exhibits shrinking,\nstable (standard), or spreading behavior. Moreover, we assume the dilation\nsequence grows regularly enough to ensure well-defined asymptotic properties.\nFor each regime, we characterize the impact on the geometry of the center\nscales and the shape of the multipole windows, with particular attention to\ntheir overlap structure and spectral coverage. These insights help to clarify\nthe trade-offs between localization, redundancy, and scalability in the design\nof needlet-type systems, particularly in relation to the study of the\nasymptotic uncorrelation of needlet coefficients when applied to random fields.",

However, these developments also raise\nsignificant concerns regarding data privacy and copyright. In response,\ntraining data detection has emerged as a critical task for identifying\nunauthorized data usage in model training. To better understand the\nvulnerability of autoregressive image generative models to such detection, we\nconduct the first study applying membership inference to this domain. Our\napproach comprises two key components: implicit classification and an adaptive\nscore aggregation strategy. First, we compute the implicit token-wise\nclassification score within the query image. Then we propose an adaptive score\naggregation strategy to acquire a final score, which places greater emphasis on\nthe tokens with lower scores. A higher final score indicates that the sample is\nmore likely to be involved in the training set. To validate the effectiveness\nof our method, we adapt existing detection algorithms originally designed for\nLLMs to visual autoregressive models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\nsuperiority of our method in both class-conditional and text-to-image\nscenarios. Moreover, our approach exhibits strong robustness and generalization\nunder various data transformations. Furthermore, sufficient experiments suggest\ntwo novel key findings: (1) A linear scaling law on membership inference,\nexposing the vulnerability of large foundation models.

In this work, we use Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to\ndevelop first-principles metrics for quantifying the spatiotemporal resolution\nlimits of inferring differentiable profiles of temperature, pressure, or other\nquantities from experimental measurements. Although we focus on pedestals, the\nmethods are fully general and can be applied to any setting involving the\ninference of profiles from discrete measurements.

Second, we introduce a novel information-theoretic metric,\n\\(N_{eff}\\), which measures the effective number of data points contributing to\nthe inferred value of a profile or its derivative. These metrics enable a\nquantitative assessment of the trade-off between `over-fitting' and\n`over-regularization', providing both practitioners and consumers of GPR with a\nsystematic way to evaluate the credibility of inferred profiles.

We argue that this discrepancy\narises from humans' ability to effectively leverage multimodal interaction\ninformation in data samples. Specifically, humans typically first gather\nmultimodal information, analyze the interactions across modalities for\nunderstanding, and then express their understanding through language. Motivated\nby this observation, we conduct extensive experiments on popular LVLMs and\nobtained insights that surprisingly reveal human-like, though less pronounced,\ncognitive behavior of LVLMs on multimodal samples. Building on these findings,\nwe further propose \\textbf{INTER}: \\textbf{Inter}action Guidance Sampling, a\nnovel training-free algorithm that mitigate hallucinations without requiring\nadditional data. Specifically, INTER explicitly guides LVLMs to effectively\nreapply their understanding of multimodal interaction information when\ngenerating responses, thereby reducing potential hallucinations. On six\nbenchmarks including VQA and image captioning tasks, INTER achieves an average\nimprovement of up to 3.4\\% on five LVLMs compared to the state-of-the-art\ndecoding strategy.

We analyze such games within the context of matchgate\ndynamics, which equivalently corresponds to evolutions of non-interacting\nfermions. We first investigate general entanglement properties of fermionic\nGaussian states (FGS). We introduce a representation of FGS using a minimal\nmatchgate circuit capable of preparing the state and derive an algorithm based\non a generalized Yang-Baxter relation for updating this representation as\nunitary operations are applied. This representation enables us to define a\nnatural disentangling procedure that reduces the number of gates in the\ncircuit, thereby decreasing the entanglement contained in the system. We then\nexplore different strategies to disentangle the systems and study the unitary\ncircuit game in two different scenarios: with braiding gates, i.e., the\nintersection of Clifford gates and matchgates, and with generic matchgates. For\neach model, we observe qualitatively different entanglement transitions, which\nwe characterize both numerically and analytically.",

The method employs a divide-and-conquer strategy,\ndecomposing the computational domain into hierarchical units with varying cell\nsizes. James's algorithm is used to compute the zero-boundary potentials of\nlower-level units, which are systematically integrated to reconstruct the\nzero-boundary potential over the entire domain. These calculations are\nperformed efficiently via matrix-vector operations using various precomputed\nkernel matrices. The open-boundary potential is then obtained by applying a\ndiscrete Green's function to the effective screening density induced at the\ndomain boundaries. The overall algorithm achieves a computational complexity of\n$\\mathcal{O}(N^3 \\log N)$, where $N$ denotes the number of cells in one\ndimension. We implement the solver in the FARGO3D magnetohydrodynamics code and\ndemonstrate its performance and second-order accuracy through a series of test\nproblems.",

We\nanalyze the world trade data to investigate strong adverse fluctuations,\ncharacterized here as `collapsed trades' -- individual trades that experience\nsignificant declines in annual trade volume compared to the previous year.\nAdopting a hypergraph framework for a fine-scale trade-centric representation\nof international trade, we find that collapsed trades are clustered similar to\ninfectious disease outbreaks in societies. Moreover, the portion of collapsed\ntrades is found to be negatively correlated with trade volume. We develop a\ncollapse propagation model, an epidemic-like model with a weight-dependent\ninfection rate, that reproduces all the essential empirical features. Through\nboth analytical and numerical analysis, we identify two key factors that\nsynergistically suppress the onset of global collective collapse and serve as a\njoint stabilizing mechanism for the international economy: i) a positive\ncorrelation between a trade's degree (the number of adjacent trades) and its\nvolume and ii) an algebraically decaying infection rate with trade volume. In\nparticular, the second factor weakened during the 2008--2009 global economic\nrecession, possibly explaining the broader spread of collapse.",

    "abstract": "Ruthenium dioxide (RuO$_2$) has been in the focus of contemporary condensed\nmatter research as a prototypical candidate material for altermagnetism. In the\nface of daunting evidence for bulk magnetic order despite promising theoretical\npredictions, it naturally suggests the focus on thin films where Coulomb\ninteractions are dimensionally quenched and may yield a more strongly\ncorrelated environment prone to magnetic ordering. Here, we combine scanning\ntunneling microscopy (STM), density functional theory (DFT), and density matrix\nrenormalization group (DMRG) methods to investigate atomically ordered\nultrathin RuO$_2$(110) grown on Ru(0001). Contrary to predictions of magnetic\norder, we observe a nonmagnetic charge density wave (CDW) instability that is\ndriven by Fermi surface nesting within the flat-band surface state, and\nstabilized by the incommensurate moir\\'e stacking with the substrate. We\nfurther identify a nonmagnetic and metastable 2 $\\times$ 2 surface\nreconstruction that breaks in-plane mirror symmetry and can be reversibly\ntoggled via STM tip manipulation. Our spin-polarized STM measurements find no\nsign of any magnetic instability at the RuO$_2$ surface. As much as our\nfindings refute proposals for either bulk or surface magnetism in RuO$_2$, we\nestablish ultrathin RuO$_2$(110) as an intriguing platform for exploring\nMoir\\'e-assisted electronic surface order.",

    "abstract": "This mixed-methods inquiry examined four domains that shape university\nstudents' trust in ChatGPT: user attributes, seven delineated trust dimensions,\ntask context, and perceived societal impact. Data were collected through a\nsurvey of 115 UK undergraduate and postgraduate students and four complementary\nsemi-structured interviews. Behavioural engagement outweighed demographics:\nfrequent use increased trust, whereas self-reported understanding of\nlarge-language-model mechanics reduced it. Among the dimensions, perceived\nexpertise and ethical risk were the strongest predictors of overall trust; ease\nof use and transparency had secondary effects, while human-likeness and\nreputation were non-significant. Trust was highly task-contingent; highest for\ncoding and summarising, lowest for entertainment and citation generation, yet\nconfidence in ChatGPT's referencing ability, despite known inaccuracies, was\nthe single strongest correlate of global trust, indicating automation bias.\nComputer-science students surpassed peers only in trusting the system for\nproofreading and writing, suggesting technical expertise refines rather than\ninflates reliance. Finally, students who viewed AI's societal impact positively\nreported the greatest trust, whereas mixed or negative outlooks dampened\nconfidence. These findings show that trust in ChatGPT hinges on task\nverifiability, perceived competence, ethical alignment and direct experience,\nand they underscore the need for transparency, accuracy cues and user education\nwhen deploying LLMs in academic settings.",

A detailed\nstudy is conducted on applying this criterion to three canonical flows:\nCouette, plane Poiseuille, and Blasius flows, considering three input-output\napproaches: unstructured, structured with non-repeated blocks, and structured\nwith repeated blocks. By covering a wide range of Reynolds numbers for each\nflow, we reveal a complex interplay between dominant flow structures that\ndetermine the stability threshold bound, arising from both unstructured and\nstructured input-output approaches. The obtained thresholds comply with a\nhierarchical relationship derived from our theoretical analysis, in which the\nunstructured approach provides a stricter bound, i.e., a lower threshold on\ndisturbance magnitude to trigger instability, compared to structured\napproaches. The latter are accounting (to some extent) for the flow system\nnonlinearity. This threshold can be triggered through various transition\nroutes, such as the presence of a finite-size perturbation in the flow or via a\ntransient growth scenario. We demonstrate that our analysis converges to linear\nstability theory when an infinitesimally small threshold is imposed. Our\nstability analysis is more general, allowing for finite-amplitude perturbations\nand nonlinear interactions, which enables us to explain the observed transition\nin various shear flows at both subcritical and supercritical Reynolds numbers,\nas observed in experimental and direct numerical simulation studies. In\nparticular, we utilize our stability criterion to demonstrate that Couette flow\ncan become unstable and transition can be triggered at different Reynolds\nnumbers, which is consistent with past experimental observations.",

Some results in this setting have been extended to\nsuper Ricci flows, revealing a unified approach to analysis on Ricci\nnonnegative manifolds and Ricci flows. However we observe that the monotonicity\nof Perelman's functionals ($\\mathcal{F}$, $\\mathcal{W}$, reduced volume), which\nhold true for Ricci flows and Ricci nonnegative manifolds, cannot be strictly\ngeneralized to super Ricci flows. In 2010 Buzano introduced a condition which\nstill generalizes Ricci flows and Ricci nonnegative manifolds, and on which\nPerelman's monotonicities do hold. We provide characterizations of this\ncondition using optimal transport and understand it heuristically as Ricci\nnonnegativity of the space-time. This interpretation is consistent with its\nequivalence to Ricci nonnegativity on Perelman's infinite dimensional manifold.\n  More precisely, we prove that for smooth evolutions of Riemannian manifolds,\nthis condition is equivalent to a Bochner inequality (resembling Perelman's\nHarnack inequality but for the forward heat flow), a gradient estimate for the\nheat flow, a Wasserstein contraction along the adjoint heat flow, the convexity\nof a modified entropy along Wasserstein geodesics, and an Evolutionary\nVariational Inequality (EVI). The optimal transport statements use Perelman's\n$L$ distance as cost, as first studied on Ricci flows by Topping and by Lott.\nWe also consider dimensionally improved and weighted versions of these\nconditions. The dimensional Bochner inequality and all gradient estimates for\nthe forward heat equation, along with the EVIs, appear to be new even for\ngeneral Ricci flows, and are related to the Hamiltonian perspective on the $L$\ndistance.

In addition, we identify two promising\nnanopyramidal reconstructions at highly reducing conditions, a stoichiometric\nand a Cu-rich one. Surface energy calculations performed using spin-polarized\nPBE, PBE+U, r$^{2}$SCAN, and HSE06 functionals show that the previously known\nCu-deficient configuration and nanopyramidal configurations are at the convex\nhull (and, thus, equilibrium structures) for all functionals, whereas the\nstability of the other structures depends on the functional and is therefore\nuncertain.

Traditional models, built for one task at a time, lack\nflexibility, requiring a separate model for each. To address this, we introduce\nMML-SurgAdapt, a unified multi-task framework with Vision-Language Models\n(VLMs), specifically CLIP, to handle diverse surgical tasks through natural\nlanguage supervision. A key challenge in multi-task learning is the presence of\npartial annotations when integrating different tasks. To overcome this, we\nemploy Single Positive Multi-Label (SPML) learning, which traditionally reduces\nannotation burden by training models with only one positive label per instance.\nOur framework extends this approach to integrate data from multiple surgical\ntasks within a single procedure, enabling effective learning despite incomplete\nor noisy annotations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on a\ncombined dataset consisting of Cholec80, Endoscapes2023, and CholecT50,\nutilizing custom prompts. Extensive evaluation shows that MML-SurgAdapt\nperforms comparably to task-specific benchmarks, with the added advantage of\nhandling noisy annotations. It also outperforms the existing SPML frameworks\nfor the task. By reducing the required labels by 23%, our approach proposes a\nmore scalable and efficient labeling process, significantly easing the\nannotation burden on clinicians.

The reconstruction is done by the minimization of a loss\nfunctional formed as the sum of a convex data fidelity functional and a\ntotal-variation-based regularizer involving a suitable matrix L of differential\noperators. Here, the total variation is a norm on the space of vector measures.\nThese are split into two categories: inner, and outer norms. The minimization\nis performed over an infinite-dimensional Banach search space. When the\nmeasurement operator is weakstar-continuous over the search space, our main\nresult is that the solution set of the loss functional is the closed convex\nhull of adaptive L-splines, with fewer knots than the number of measurements.\nWe reveal the effect of the total-variation norms on the structure of the\nsolutions and show that inner norms yield sparser solutions.

Traditional models for CVS recognition depend on\nvision-only models learning with costly, labor-intensive spatial annotations.\nThis study investigates how text can be harnessed as a powerful tool for both\ntraining and inference in multi-modal surgical foundation models to automate\nCVS recognition. Unlike many existing multi-modal models, which are primarily\nadapted for multi-class classification, CVS recognition requires a multi-label\nframework. Zero-shot evaluation of existing multi-modal surgical models shows a\nsignificant performance gap for this task. To address this, we propose\nCVS-AdaptNet, a multi-label adaptation strategy that enhances fine-grained,\nbinary classification across multiple labels by aligning image embeddings with\ntextual descriptions of each CVS criterion using positive and negative prompts.\nBy adapting PeskaVLP, a state-of-the-art surgical foundation model, on the\nEndoscapes-CVS201 dataset, CVS-AdaptNet achieves 57.6 mAP, improving over the\nResNet50 image-only baseline (51.5 mAP) by 6 points. Our results show that\nCVS-AdaptNet's multi-label, multi-modal framework, enhanced by textual prompts,\nboosts CVS recognition over image-only methods. We also propose text-specific\ninference methods, that helps in analysing the image-text alignment. While\nfurther work is needed to match state-of-the-art spatial annotation-based\nmethods, this approach highlights the potential of adapting generalist models\nto specialized surgical tasks.

By\nconsidering the distinctive feature characteristics of OCT and fundus images,\nwe emphasize the alignment of semantic features within the same category and\nexplicitly learn soft matching between modalities, allowing the missing\nmodality to utilize existing modality information, achieving robust cross-modal\nfeature alignment under the missing modality. Specifically, we leverage the\nOptimal Transport for multi-scale modality feature alignment: class-wise\nalignment through predicted class prototypes and feature-wise alignment via\ncross-modal shared feature transport. Furthermore, we propose an asymmetric\nfusion strategy that effectively exploits the distinct characteristics of OCT\nand fundus modalities. Extensive evaluations on three large ophthalmic\nmultimodal datasets demonstrate our model's superior performance under various\nmodality-incomplete scenarios, achieving Sota performance in both complete\nmodality and inter-modality incompleteness conditions.

Accordingly,\nautonomous vehicles (AuVs) are viewed as vehicular systems capable of\nperceiving their environment and executing pre-programmed tasks independently\nof external input. However, both research and real-world deployments\nincreasingly showcase vehicles that demonstrate behaviors beyond this\ndefinition (including the SAE levels 0 to 5); Examples of this outpace include\nthe interaction with humans with natural language, goal adaptation, contextual\nreasoning, external tool use, and unseen ethical dilemma handling, largely\nempowered by multi-modal large language models (LLMs). These developments\nreveal a conceptual gap between technical autonomy and the broader cognitive\nand social capabilities needed for future human-centered mobility systems. To\naddress this gap, this paper introduces the concept of agentic vehicles (AgVs),\nreferring to vehicles that integrate agentic AI systems to reason, adapt, and\ninteract within complex environments. This paper proposes the term AgVs and\ntheir distinguishing characteristics from conventional AuVs. It synthesizes\nrelevant advances in integrating LLMs and AuVs and highlights how AgVs might\ntransform future mobility systems and ensure the systems are human-centered.\nThe paper concludes by identifying key challenges in the development and\ngovernance of AgVs, and how they can play a significant role in future agentic\ntransportation systems.",

Many DL approaches rely on semi-supervised methods, which focus\non constructing large datasets that require only a minimal amount of\nhuman-labelled data. Since DL training algorithms can tolerate moderate label\nnoise, it has generally been acceptable for the accuracy of labels in large\ntraining datasets to fall well short of a perfect 100%. However, when it comes\nto testing DL models, achieving high label accuracy-as close to 100% as\npossible-is paramount for reliable verification. In this article, we introduce\nOPAL, a human-assisted labelling method that can be configured to target a\ndesired accuracy level while minimizing the manual effort required for\nlabelling. The main contribution of OPAL is a mixed-integer linear programming\n(MILP) formulation that minimizes labelling effort subject to a specified\naccuracy target. We evaluate OPAL for two tasks in the context of testing\nvision systems: automatic labelling of test data and automated validation of\ntest data. Our evaluation, based on more than 2500 experiments performed on\nseven datasets, comparing OPAL with eight baseline methods, shows that OPAL,\nrelying on its MILP formulation, achieves an average accuracy of 98.8%, just\n1.2% below perfect accuracy, while cutting manual labelling by more than half.\nFurther, OPAL significantly outperforms automated labelling baselines in\nlabelling accuracy across all seven datasets, with large effect sizes, when all\nmethods are provided with the same manual-labelling budget. For automated\ntest-input validation, on average, OPAL reduces manual effort by 28.8% while\nachieving 4.5% higher accuracy than the SOTA validation baselines.

    "abstract": "Controlling the size and shape of assembled structures is a fundamental\nchallenge in self-assembly, and is highly relevant in material design and\nbiology. Here, we show that specific, but promiscuous, short-range binding\ninteractions make it possible to economically assemble linear filaments of\nuser-defined length. Our approach leads to independent control over the mean\nand width of the filament size distribution and allows us to smoothly explore\ndesign trade-offs between assembly quality (spread in size) and cost (number of\nparticle species). We employ a simple hierarchical assembly protocol to\nminimize assembly times, and show that multiple stages of hierarchy make it\npossible to extend our approach to the assembly of higher-dimensional\nstructures. Our work provides a simple and experimentally straightforward\nsolution to size control that is immediately applicable to a broad range of\nsystems, from DNA origami assemblies to supramolecular polymers and beyond.",

    "abstract": "Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) aims to predict the intermediate frame $I_n$\n(we use n to denote time in videos to avoid notation overload with the timestep\n$t$ in diffusion models) based on two consecutive neighboring frames $I_0$ and\n$I_1$. Recent approaches apply diffusion models (both image-based and\nvideo-based) in this task and achieve strong performance. However, image-based\ndiffusion models are unable to extract temporal information and are relatively\ninefficient compared to non-diffusion methods. Video-based diffusion models can\nextract temporal information, but they are too large in terms of training\nscale, model size, and inference time. To mitigate the above issues, we propose\nTemporal-Aware Latent Brownian Bridge Diffusion for Video Frame Interpolation\n(TLB-VFI), an efficient video-based diffusion model. By extracting rich\ntemporal information from video inputs through our proposed 3D-wavelet gating\nand temporal-aware autoencoder, our method achieves 20% improvement in FID on\nthe most challenging datasets over recent SOTA of image-based diffusion models.\nMeanwhile, due to the existence of rich temporal information, our method\nachieves strong performance while having 3times fewer parameters. Such a\nparameter reduction results in 2.3x speed up. By incorporating optical flow\nguidance, our method requires 9000x less training data and achieves over 20x\nfewer parameters than video-based diffusion models.

An accurate and robust\nevaluation of its severity is vital to ensure prompt management and care.\nOrdinal regression leverages the underlying inherent order between categories\nto achieve superior performance beyond traditional classification. However,\nthere exist challenges leading to lower DR classification performance: 1) The\nuneven distribution of DR severity levels, characterized by a long-tailed\npattern, adds complexity to the grading process. 2)The ambiguity in defining\ncategory boundaries introduces additional challenges, making the classification\nprocess more complex and prone to inconsistencies. This work proposes a novel\nautoregressive ordinal regression method called AOR-DR to address the above\nchallenges by leveraging the clinical knowledge of inherent ordinal information\nin DR grading dataset settings. Specifically, we decompose the DR grading task\ninto a series of ordered steps by fusing the prediction of the previous steps\nwith extracted image features as conditions for the current prediction step.\nAdditionally, we exploit the diffusion process to facilitate conditional\nprobability modeling, enabling the direct use of continuous global image\nfeatures for autoregression without relearning contextual information from\npatch-level features. This ensures the effectiveness of the autoregressive\nprocess and leverages the capabilities of pre-trained large-scale foundation\nmodels. Extensive experiments were conducted on four large-scale publicly\navailable color fundus datasets, demonstrating our model's effectiveness and\nsuperior performance over six recent state-of-the-art ordinal regression\nmethods.

While numerous advancements have been proposed to enhance the\nvideo understanding capabilities of these models, they are predominantly\ntrained on questions generated directly from video content.

Performance metrics,\nparticularly TSS (0.74), recall (0.95) and the area under the curve (AUC=0.87)\nin the receiver operating characteristic (ROC), indicate that DLSTM with an\nensemble approach on regularized time series outperforms other models, offering\nmore accurate large-flare forecasts with fewer false errors compared to models\ntrained on irregular time series. The superior performance of DLSTM is\nattributed to its ability to decompose time series into trend and seasonal\ncomponents, effectively isolating random noise. This study underscores the\npotential of advanced machine learning techniques for solar flare prediction\nand highlights the importance of incorporating various solar cycle phases and\nresampling strategies to enhance forecasting reliability.",

A wireless network with multiple\nBSs, operating on non-overlapping channels, is considered. The channels of the\nBSs are susceptible to jamming by attackers. During every time slot, a user\narrives with a certain probability. There exists a holding cost in each slot\nfor every user associated with a BS. The goal here is to design a user\nassociation scheme, which assigns a BS to each user upon arrival with the\nobjective of minimizing the long-run total average holding cost borne within\nthe network. This objective results in low average delays attained by the\nusers. This association problem is an instance of restless multi-armed bandit\nproblems, and is known to be hard to solve. By making use of the framework\npresented by Whittle, the hard per-stage constraint that every arriving user\nmust connect to exactly one BS in a time slot is relaxed to a long-term\ntime-averaged constraint. Subsequently, we employ the Lagrangian multiplier\nstrategy to reformulate the problem into an unconstrained form and decompose it\ninto separate Markov Decision Processes at the BSs. Further, the problem is\nproven to be Whittle indexable and a method for calculating the Whittle indices\ncorresponding to different BSs is presented. We design a user association\npolicy under which, upon arrival of a user in a time slot, it is assigned to\nthe BS having the least Whittle index in that slot. Through extensive\nsimulations, we show that our proposed association policy based on the Whittle\nindex outperforms various user association policies proposed in previous work\nin terms of different metrics such as average cost, average delay, and Jain's\nfairness index.",

Such biases mislead the model into associating textual cues with\nincorrect visual moments, resulting in unreliable predictions and poor\ngeneralization to out-of-distribution examples. To overcome these limitations,\nwe propose a novel TSG framework, causal intervention and counterfactual\nreasoning that utilizes causal inference to eliminate spurious correlations and\nenhance the model's robustness. Specifically, we first formulate the TSG task\nfrom a causal perspective with a structural causal model. Then, to address\nunobserved confounders reflecting textual biases toward specific verbs or\nphrases, a textual causal intervention is proposed, utilizing do-calculus to\nestimate the causal effects. Furthermore, visual counterfactual reasoning is\nperformed by constructing a counterfactual scenario that focuses solely on\nvideo features, excluding the query and fused multi-modal features. This allows\nus to debias the model by isolating and removing the influence of the video\nfrom the overall effect. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate the\nsuperiority of the proposed method.

Then, the Betti numbers of the neighbor subnetwork of\neach node are computed, which are used to perform Hk-core decomposition of the\nnetwork homology.

    "abstract": "Despite remarkable progress in image quality and prompt fidelity,\ntext-to-image (T2I) diffusion models continue to exhibit persistent\n\"hallucinations\", where generated content subtly or significantly diverges from\nthe intended prompt semantics. While often regarded as unpredictable artifacts,\nwe argue that these failures reflect deeper, structured misalignments within\nthe generative process. In this work, we propose a cognitively inspired\nperspective that reinterprets hallucinations as trajectory drift within a\nlatent alignment space. Empirical observations reveal that generation unfolds\nwithin a multiaxial cognitive tension field, where the model must continuously\nnegotiate competing demands across three key critical axes: semantic coherence,\nstructural alignment, and knowledge grounding. We then formalize this\nthree-axis space as the \\textbf{Hallucination Tri-Space} and introduce the\nAlignment Risk Code (ARC): a dynamic vector representation that quantifies\nreal-time alignment tension during generation. The magnitude of ARC captures\noverall misalignment, its direction identifies the dominant failure axis, and\nits imbalance reflects tension asymmetry. Based on this formulation, we develop\nthe TensionModulator (TM-ARC): a lightweight controller that operates entirely\nin latent space. TM-ARC monitors ARC signals and applies targeted,\naxis-specific interventions during the sampling process. Extensive experiments\non standard T2I benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces\nhallucination without compromising image quality or diversity. This framework\noffers a unified and interpretable approach for understanding and mitigating\ngenerative failures in diffusion-based T2I systems.",

Therefore, a facile and\naccurate detection of $\\mathrm{Ni}^{2+}$, especially in environmental and\nbiological settings, is of huge significance. As an efficient detection method,\nassaying $\\mathrm{Ni}^{2+}$ using optical (colorimetric and/or fluorogenic)\nsensors has experienced quite a vigorous growth period, with a large number of\nexcellent research contributions. Nanomaterial-based optical sensors, including\nmetal nanoparticles (MNPs), quantum dots (QDs), and carbon dots (CDs), offer\ndistinct advantages over conventional small-molecule organic and inorganic\nsensors. This study mainly provides an overview of the recent advancements and\nchallenges related to the design strategies of various optical nanosensors to\nselectively detect the $\\mathrm{Ni}^{2+}$ ion.

    "abstract": "While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable\nprogress in open-ended visual question answering, they remain vulnerable to\nhallucinations. These are outputs that contradict or misrepresent input\nsemantics, posing a critical challenge to the reliability and factual\nconsistency. Existing methods often rely on external verification or post-hoc\ncorrection, lacking an internal mechanism to validate outputs directly during\ntraining. To bridge this gap, we propose ReLoop, a unified closed-loop training\nframework that encourages multimodal consistency for cross-modal understanding\nin MLLMs. ReLoop adopts a ring-shaped structure that integrates three\ncomplementary consistency feedback mechanisms, obliging MLLMs to \"seeing twice\nand thinking backwards\". Specifically, ReLoop employs the frozen Consistency\nFeedback Plugin (CFP), comprising semantic reconstruction, visual description,\nand an attention supervision module for attention alignment. These components\ncollectively enforce semantic reversibility, visual consistency, and\ninterpretable attention, enabling the model to correct its outputs during\ntraining. Extensive evaluations and analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of\nReLoop in reducing hallucination rates across multiple benchmarks, establishing\na robust method for hallucination mitigation in MLLMs. We will release our\nsource code and data in the camera-ready version.",

Arguments are presented using an\neffective field theory anchored on a renormalization-group approach to\ninteracting baryons on the Fermi surface coupled with hidden symmetric heavy\nmesonic degrees of freedom that enables one to go beyond Weinberg's nuclear\neffective field theory involving nucleon and pion fields only, referred hereon\nto as $\\chi$EFT$_\\pi$.

Going beyond the density regime applicable to normal nuclear matter\n$n_0$, the notion of ``hadron-quark continuity HQC)\" is brought in via the\nskyrmion structure of the nucleon argued to be valid in QCD at large $N_c$\nlimit and the large $N^\\prime$ limit of the Grassmannian model $G/H=\n[O(N^\\prime)/O(N^\\prime-p) \\times O(p)]$ where $N^\\prime=4$ and $p=2$ for\nhidden local symmetry and the IR fixed point in QCD for $N_f \\leq 3$ involving\n``genuine/QCD-conformal dilaton\" for hidden scale symmetry.

Thus, when\nmaking decisions regarding the installation of bicycle infrastructure, it is\ncrucial to understand if and to what extent different bicycle-lane types\nincrease bicycle ridership. However, associations between bicycle\ninfrastructure and bicycle ridership have primarily been studied in the context\nof individual lanes and corridors, or when analyzed at the scale of entire\ncities, generalized across different bike-lane types. Drawing upon 72 million\nbikeshare trips from Citi Bike in New York, we demonstrate that there is an\napproximately 18% increase in bikeshare trips at adjacent stations in the 12\nmonths following the installation of protected bike lanes (those with a\nphysical barrier between cyclists and automobile traffic) and a 14% increase\nassociated with painted bike lanes (where a line of pavement marking is\npresent) and `sharrows' (where a normal traffic lane is marked with a bike\nstencil). However, using a difference-in-differences analysis, we detect a\ncausal effect on bikeshare ridership only following the installation of\nprotected bike lanes, with an average monthly increase of 379 rides per station\n(p<0.001). Despite this causal effect being pronounced among census block\ngroups with higher percentages of older adults (688 rides per month per\nstation, p<0.001), the causal effect of protected bike lanes on bikeshare\nridership is absent in census block groups where the percentage of Black\nresidents is medium to high. Taken together, these findings indicate that\nplanners must emphasize protected bike lanes to spur ridership, and\nsimultaneously target policies and programming to communities of color, to\nensure that such infrastructure makes urban cycling a viable option for all\nresidents.",

Deep\nlearning-based super-resolution models offer a promising solution to downscale\nESM outputs to higher resolutions by learning from data. Yet, due to regional\nvariations in climatic processes, these models typically require retraining for\neach geographical area-demanding high-resolution observational data, which is\nunevenly available across the globe. This highlights the need to assess how\nwell these models generalize across geographic regions.

We evaluate state-of-the-art downscaling\napproaches including GANs and diffusion models in generalizing across data gaps\nbetween the Global North and Global South. Our findings reveal substantial\nperformance drops in out-of-distribution regions, depending on model and\ngeographic area.

We show that addressing these shifts through, for example,\ndata alignment can improve spatial generalization.

    "abstract": "Varying annotation costs among data points and budget constraints can hinder\nthe adoption of active learning strategies in real-world applications. This\nwork introduces two Bayesian active learning strategies for batch acquisition\nunder constraints (ConBatch-BAL), one based on dynamic thresholding and one\nfollowing greedy acquisition. Both select samples using uncertainty metrics\ncomputed via Bayesian neural networks. The dynamic thresholding strategy\nredistributes the budget across the batch, while the greedy one selects the\ntop-ranked sample at each step, limited by the remaining budget. Focusing on\nscenarios with costly data annotation and geospatial constraints, we also\nrelease two new real-world datasets containing geolocated aerial images of\nbuildings, annotated with energy efficiency or typology classes. The\nConBatch-BAL strategies are benchmarked against a random acquisition baseline\non these datasets under various budget and cost scenarios. The results show\nthat the developed ConBatch-BAL strategies can reduce active learning\niterations and data acquisition costs in real-world settings, and even\noutperform the unconstrained baseline solutions.",

These observations offer\ncrucial insights into the physical processes driving early galaxy formation. In\nthis work, we introduce the Phoebos hydrodynamical cosmological simulation, a\nstate-of-the-art 100 Mpc volume designed to study the formation and evolution\nof galaxies at the end of cosmic dawn and into the epoch of reionization.\nPhoebos includes a stellar feedback model that is intentionally weak, in order\nto address the high abundance of massive galaxies seen by JWST at early epochs.\nAt variance with most large cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, we do not\nemploy an effective equation of state model, instead our radiative cooling\nmodel allows us to capture the multi-phase nature of the gas inside and around\ngalaxies. Phoebos reproduces key observables of early galaxy formation at $z\n\\gtrsim 8$, including the stellar mass function and the stellar-to-halo mass\nrelation. It also recovers the observed slope of the stellar size-to-mass\nrelation and matches the specific star formation rate remarkably well. These\nresults suggest that highly efficient star formation in the presence of only\nmild regulation from stellar feedback, drives early galaxy growth, supporting a\nscenario of rapid stellar mass assembly during cosmic dawn. There are\nindications in the cosmic star formation density that, at lower redshifts,\nPhoebos might overpredict the stellar mass within the systems, suggesting that\na transition to a stronger stellar feedback may be necessary to reproduce\nlater-time observations. These results highlight the potential of Phoebos to\ninterpret JWST observations and to probe the evolving physical processes that\nshape galaxy formation.",

In BECs, dark solitons emerge as exact stationary solutions\nof the one-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation. While they can be long-lived\nin elongated traps, their stability is compromised in higher dimensions due to\nthe snake instability, which leads to the decay of the soliton into vortex\nstructures among other excitations. We investigate the dynamics of a dark\nsoliton in a Bose-Einstein condensate confined in an anisotropic harmonic trap.\nUsing a variational ansatz that incorporates both the transverse bending of the\nsoliton plane and the emergence of vortices along the nodal line, we derive\nequations of motion governing the soliton's evolution. This approach allows us\nto identify stable oscillation modes as well as the growth rates of the\nunstable perturbations. In particular, we determine the critical trap\nanisotropy required to suppress the snake instability.

However, the structure of this emerging\nfield - both in terms of its constituent disciplines and researcher dynamics -\nremains poorly understood. To address this gap, we analyze over 25,000\nCE-related publications from Scopus by combining conventional bibliometric\napproaches with advanced machine learning techniques, including text embeddings\nand clustering. This hybrid method enables both a macro-level mapping of\nresearch domains and a micro-level investigation of individual researchers'\ndisciplinary backgrounds and collaborations.\n  We classify CE research into 16 distinct clusters, identifying the original\ndisciplines of researchers and visualizing patterns of interdisciplinary\ncollaboration. Building on this foundation, we ask: Which CE-related research\ndomains receive the most attention in academic and policy contexts? And how are\ndifferent types of interdisciplinary collaboration associated with research\nimpact?\n  Our findings show that research in business and management attracts\nsubstantial academic and policy attention, while engineering research - though\nless visible - tends to achieve higher funding success. This suggests a\npositive dynamic in which the former draws attention to CE issues and the\nlatter secures the economic resources necessary to realize them.\n  We further demonstrate that CE papers co-authored by researchers from\ndifferent disciplines tend to show higher research impact than\nintradisciplinary work. Qualitative case analyses also highlight this tendency.\nCentered particularly on collaborations between business-oriented and\nengineering-oriented disciplines, our findings underscore the importance of\ninterdisciplinary efforts in CE research and offer insights for guiding future\ncross-disciplinary engagement in the field.",

Additionally, we present the implementation of a simple but complete\npipeline that showcases the main features of LBS. We also discuss how we\nensured that LBS lets people develop pipelines whose results are accurate and\nreproducible. A full end-to-end pipeline has been developed using LBS to\ncharacterize the scientific performance of the LiteBIRD experiment. This\npipeline and the results of the first simulation run are presented in Puglisi\net al. (2025).",

    "abstract": "Understanding leadership dynamics in collective behavior is a key challenge\nin animal ecology, swarm robotics, and intelligent transportation. Traditional\ninformation-theoretic approaches, including Transfer Entropy (TE) and\nTime-Lagged Mutual Information (TLMI), have been widely used to infer\nleader-follower relationships but face critical limitations in noisy or\nshort-duration datasets due to their reliance on robust probability\nestimations. This study proposes a method based on dynamic network inference\nusing time-lagged correlations across multiple kinematic variables: velocity,\nacceleration, and direction. Our approach constructs directed influence graphs\nover time, enabling the identification of leadership patterns without the need\nfor large volumes of data or parameter-sensitive discretization. We validate\nour method through two multi-agent simulations in NetLogo: a modified Vicsek\nmodel with informed leaders and a predator-prey model featuring coordinated and\nindependent wolf groups. Experimental results demonstrate that the\nnetwork-based method outperforms TE and TLMI in scenarios with limited\nspatiotemporal observations, ranking true leaders at the top of influence\nmetrics more consistently than TE and TLMI.",

    "abstract": "Identifying regions affected by disasters is a vital step in effectively\nmanaging and planning relief and rescue efforts. Unlike the traditional\napproaches of manually assessing post-disaster damage, analyzing images of\nUnmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) offers an objective and reliable way to assess\nthe damage. In the past, segmentation techniques have been adopted to identify\npost-flood damage in UAV aerial images. However, most of these supervised\nlearning approaches rely on manually annotated datasets. Indeed, annotating\nimages is a time-consuming and error-prone task that requires domain expertise.\nThis work focuses on leveraging self-supervised features to accurately identify\nflooded regions in UAV aerial images. This work proposes two\nencoder-decoder-based segmentation approaches, which integrate the visual\nfeatures learned from DINOv2 with the traditional encoder backbone. This study\ninvestigates the generalization of self-supervised features for UAV aerial\nimages. Specifically, we evaluate the effectiveness of features from the DINOv2\nmodel, trained on non-aerial images, for segmenting aerial images, noting the\ndistinct perspectives between the two image types. Our results demonstrate that\nDINOv2's self-supervised pretraining on natural images generates transferable,\ngeneral-purpose visual features that streamline the development of aerial\nsegmentation workflows. By leveraging these features as a foundation, we\nsignificantly reduce reliance on labor-intensive manual annotation processes,\nenabling high-accuracy segmentation with limited labeled aerial data.",

In this work, variations in weak magnetic fields of the\nphotosphere were investigated, which required the use of special data\nprocessing methods. Synoptic maps of the photospheric magnetic field for the\nperiod 1978-2016 (NSO Kitt Peak) were used. To highlight the contribution of\nweak magnetic fields, the saturation threshold for synoptic maps was set at 5\nG. Based on thus transformed synoptic maps, a time-latitude diagram was\nconstructed. For the selected latitude intervals, smoothing, trend removal and\nFast Fourier Transform (FFT) were performed. In the time-latitude diagram, 6\nspatiotemporal regions with distinct cyclic structure were observed during 4\nsolar cycles (21-24). The periods ranged from 0.5 to 4 years with a maximum at\n1.2 years. The amplitude of ripples is significantly higher for those intervals\nin which the polar field had positive sign.

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) systems are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where\nadversaries train their local models on poisoned data and submit poisoned model\nupdates to compromise the global model. Despite numerous proposed attacks and\ndefenses, divergent experimental settings, implementation errors, and\nunrealistic assumptions hinder fair comparisons and valid conclusions about\ntheir effectiveness in real-world scenarios. To address this, we introduce\nBackFed - a comprehensive benchmark suite designed to standardize, streamline,\nand reliably evaluate backdoor attacks and defenses in FL, with a focus on\npractical constraints. Our benchmark offers key advantages through its\nmulti-processing implementation that significantly accelerates experimentation\nand the modular design that enables seamless integration of new methods via\nwell-defined APIs. With a standardized evaluation pipeline, we envision BackFed\nas a plug-and-play environment for researchers to comprehensively and reliably\nevaluate new attacks and defenses. Using BackFed, we conduct large-scale\nstudies of representative backdoor attacks and defenses across both Computer\nVision and Natural Language Processing tasks with diverse model architectures\nand experimental settings. Our experiments critically assess the performance of\nproposed attacks and defenses, revealing unknown limitations and modes of\nfailures under practical conditions. These empirical insights provide valuable\nguidance for the development of new methods and for enhancing the security of\nFL systems. Our framework is openly available at\nhttps://github.com/thinh-dao/BackFed.",

    "abstract": "A refined Brill--Noether theory seeks to determine which linear series are\nadmitted by a ``general'' curve in a particular Brill--Noether locus. However,\nas Brill--Noether loci are not irreducible in general, a coarse answer is given\nby the relative positions of Brill--Noether loci. Via an analysis of unstable\nLazarsfeld--Mukai bundles on K3 surfaces, we distinguish Brill--Noether loci\nand provide expectations for the relative positions of Brill--Noether loci in\ngeneral. Together with classical results, the refined Brill--Noether theory for\ncurves of fixed gonality and on Hirzebruch surfaces, and explicit\nconstructions, we identify the relative positions of all Brill--Noether loci in\ngenus $g\\leq 12$.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates the torsional mechanical properties of pristine iron\n(Fe) and carbon-doped iron (FeC) nanowires with [001] orientation through\nmolecular dynamics simulations utilizing the Modified Embedded Atom Method\n(MEAM) potential developed by Liyanage et al. for accurately modeling Fe-C\ninteractions in body-centered cubic structures. Systematic analysis across\ncarbon concentrations (0 - 10%), temperatures (1 - 900 K), and cross-sectional\ndimensions 10a, 13a, 15a, ( where a = 2.81 Angstrom represents the lattice\nconstant ) within the LAMMPS environment reveals that increasing carbon content\nweakens grain boundaries, reducing the maximum shear stress required to reach\nthe critical torsional angle, while higher temperatures promote phase\ntransitions from elastic to plastic deformation due to enhanced atomic\nvibrations, and larger cross-sections exhibit higher shear stress resistance\nattributed to strengthening effects from the outer atomic layers. By\nelucidating these interrelationships between carbon content, temperature, and\ndimensional factors, this work provides fundamental insights into the\nmechanical behavior of FeC nanowires under torsional loading conditions,\noffering valuable guidance for their potential applications in\nnanoelectromechanical systems, nanorobotic actuators, and advanced structural\nmaterials where precise control of mechanical properties is essential.",

    "abstract": "Accident severity prediction plays a critical role in transportation safety\nsystems but is a persistently difficult task due to incomplete data, strong\nfeature dependencies, and severe class imbalance in which rare but\nhigh-severity cases are underrepresented and hard to detect. Existing methods\noften rely on monolithic models or black box prompting, which struggle to scale\nin noisy, real-world settings and offer limited interpretability. To address\nthese challenges, we propose MARBLE a multiagent rule based LLM engine that\ndecomposes the severity prediction task across a team of specialized reasoning\nagents, including an interchangeable ML-backed agent. Each agent focuses on a\nsemantic subset of features (e.g., spatial, environmental, temporal), enabling\nscoped reasoning and modular prompting without the risk of prompt saturation.\nPredictions are coordinated through either rule-based or LLM-guided consensus\nmechanisms that account for class rarity and confidence dynamics. The system\nretains structured traces of agent-level reasoning and coordination outcomes,\nsupporting in-depth interpretability and post-hoc performance diagnostics.\nAcross both UK and US datasets, MARBLE consistently outperforms traditional\nmachine learning classifiers and state-of-the-art (SOTA) prompt-based reasoning\nmethods including Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Least-to-Most (L2M), and\nTree-of-Thought (ToT) achieving nearly 90% accuracy where others plateau below\n48%. This performance redefines the practical ceiling for accident severity\nclassification under real world noise and extreme class imbalance. Our results\nposition MARBLE as a generalizable and interpretable framework for reasoning\nunder uncertainty in safety-critical applications.",

Rectifying identifiability through\nsimplification can seemingly yield more precise parameter estimates, albeit, as\nwe explore in this perspective, at the potentially catastrophic cost of\nintroducing model misspecification and poor accuracy. We demonstrate how\nuncertainty in model structure can be propagated through to uncertainty in\nparameter estimates using a semi-parametric Gaussian process approach that\ndelineates parameters of interest from uncertainty in model terms.\nSpecifically, we study generalised logistic growth with an unknown crowding\nfunction, and a spatially resolved process described by a partial differential\nequation with a time-dependent diffusivity parameter. Allowing for structural\nmodel uncertainty yields more robust and accurate parameter estimates, and a\nbetter quantification of remaining uncertainty.

Recently, a so-called hybrid-NPG\n(hNPG) was synthesized, featuring an alternating sequence of doped and\nnon-doped GNRs, resulting in a band staggering effect in its electronic\nstructure. Such a feature is appealing for photo-catalysis, photovoltaics and\neven carbon nanocircuitry. However, to date, little is known about the\ntransport properties of hNPG and its derivatives, which is key for most\napplications. Here, via Green's functions simulations, we study the quantum\ntransport properties of hNPGs. We find that injected carriers in hNPG spread\nlaterally through a number of GNRs, though such spreading may take place\nexclusively through GNRs of one type (doped or non-doped). We propose a simple\nmodel to discern the key parameters determining the electronic propagation in\nhNPGs and explore alternative hNPG designs to control the spreading/confinement\nand anisotropy of charge transport in these systems. For one such design, we\nfind that it is possible to send directed electric signals with sub-nanometer\nprecision for as long as one micrometer - a result first reported for any NPG.",

    "abstract": "Cancer survival prediction requires integrating pathological Whole Slide\nImages (WSIs) and genomic profiles, a challenging task due to the inherent\nheterogeneity and the complexity of modeling both inter- and intra-modality\ninteractions. Current methods often employ straightforward fusion strategies\nfor multimodal feature integration, failing to comprehensively capture\nmodality-specific and modality-common interactions, resulting in a limited\nunderstanding of multimodal correlations and suboptimal predictive performance.\nTo mitigate these limitations, this paper presents a Multimodal Representation\nDecoupling Network (MurreNet) to advance cancer survival analysis.\nSpecifically, we first propose a Multimodal Representation Decomposition (MRD)\nmodule to explicitly decompose paired input data into modality-specific and\nmodality-shared representations, thereby reducing redundancy between\nmodalities. Furthermore, the disentangled representations are further refined\nthen updated through a novel training regularization strategy that imposes\nconstraints on distributional similarity, difference, and representativeness of\nmodality features. Finally, the augmented multimodal features are integrated\ninto a joint representation via proposed Deep Holistic Orthogonal Fusion (DHOF)\nstrategy.

As the activity is increased, we observe a clear structural\ntransition marked by the formation of intense, spatially organized vortices\nwith the appearance of giant number fluctuations. This transition is\naccompanied by the emergence of local polar ordering, an increase in velocity\ncorrelations, and a shift in the velocity distribution from unimodal to\nbimodal. Beyond activity, reducing the instability timescale leads to similar\nstructural changes in the flow. This suggests that both activity and\ninstability dynamics can serve as control parameters for pattern formation.

    "abstract": "Deploying language models (LMs) in customer-facing speech applications\nrequires conversational fluency and adherence to specific stylistic guidelines.\nThis can be challenging to achieve reliably using complex system prompts due to\nissues like instruction following limitations and in-context bias. This study\ninvestigates the effectiveness of fine-tuning versus system prompting for\naligning LMs with a specific behavioral target: responding in a natural,\nconversational tone suitable for voice interactions. We fine-tuned a small,\nopen-weights model (`Llama3.2-1B-Instruct`) using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on\na synthetically generated dataset derived from Wikipedia. Additionally, we\nfine-tuned two closed-source models (`gpt-4o-mini`, `gpt-4.1-mini`). Our\nresults demonstrate that fine-tuning outperformed system prompting, achieving a\nhigh percentage of conversational responses, even when trained on only 100 data\nsamples. Semantic similarity analysis confirmed that fine-tuning did not\ndegrade content quality. Interestingly, fine-tuning with 8-bit integer\nquantization converged faster towards the target style than using bfloat16\nprecision, potentially due to implicit regularization effects. We conclude that\nfine-tuning small, open-weights LMs on simulated data is a highly effective and\ndata-efficient method for instilling specific stylistic behaviors, offering a\npreferable alternative to complex system prompting for practical applications\nrequiring nuanced response styles.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the locus of semantic representation in large language models\n(LLMs) is crucial for interpretability and architectural innovation. The\ndominant paradigm posits that trainable input embeddings serve as foundational\n\"meaning vectors.\" This paper challenges that view. We construct Transformer\nmodels where the embedding layer is entirely frozen, with vectors derived not\nfrom data, but from the visual structure of Unicode glyphs. These non-semantic,\nprecomputed visual embeddings are fixed throughout training. Our method is\ncompatible with any tokenizer, including a novel Unicode-centric tokenizer we\nintroduce to ensure universal text coverage. Despite the absence of trainable,\nsemantically initialized embeddings, our models converge, generate coherent\ntext, and, critically, outperform architecturally identical models with\ntrainable embeddings on the MMLU reasoning benchmark. We attribute this to\n\"representational interference\" in conventional models, where the embedding\nlayer is burdened with learning both structural and semantic features. Our\nresults indicate that high-level semantics are not inherent to input embeddings\nbut are an emergent property of the Transformer's compositional architecture\nand data scale. This reframes the role of embeddings from meaning containers to\nstructural primitives. We release all code and models to foster further\nresearch.",

In\nparticular, we show that image-space preconditioning (ISP) and data-space\npreconditioning (DSP) can be formulated as non-conventional inner-products. The\nmain gain of our reformulation is an embedding of ISP in the variational\nformulation of the MRI reconstruction problem (in an algorithm-independent way)\nwhich allows in principle to naturally and systematically propagate ISP in all\niterative reconstructions, including many iterative DL and CS reconstructions\nwhere preconditioning is lacking. The way in which we apply linear algebraic\ntools to MRI reconstructions as presented in this article is a novelty.\n  A secondary aim of our article is to offer a certain didactic material to\nscientists who are new in the field of MRI reconstruction. Since we explore\nhere some mathematical concepts of reconstruction, we take that opportunity to\nrecall some principles that may be understood for experts, but which may be\nhard to find in the literature for beginners.

This approach fundamentally guarantees identical results\nbetween serial and parallel computations.

In practice, pattern matching is\nchallenging, since common applications rely on a large set of patterns that\nshall be evaluated with tight latency bounds. At the same time, matching needs\nto maintain state, i.e., intermediate results, that grows exponentially in the\ninput size. Hence, systems turn to best-effort processing, striving for maximal\nrecall under a latency bound. Existing techniques, however, consider each\npattern in isolation, neglecting the optimization potential induced by state\nsharing in pattern matching.\n  In this paper, we present SHARP, a library that employs state reduction to\nachieve efficient best-effort pattern matching. To this end, SHARP incorporates\nstate sharing between patterns through a new abstraction, coined\npattern-sharing degree (PSD). At runtime, this abstraction facilitates the\ncategorization and indexing of partial pattern matches. Based thereon, once a\nlatency bound is exceeded, SHARP realizes best-effort processing by selecting a\nsubset of partial matches for further processing in constant time. In\nexperiments with real-world data, SHARP achieves a recall of 97%, 96% and 73%\nfor pattern matching in CEP, OLAP, and RAG applications, under a bound of 50%\nof the average processing latency.",

    "abstract": "Cold-start node classification on multimodal graphs is challenging because\ncold-start nodes are isolated (i.e., no edges) and often have missing\nmodalities (e.g., absent text or image features). Existing methods address\nstructural isolation by degrading graph learning models to MLPs for cold-start\ninference, using a teacher model (with graph access) to guide the MLP. However,\nthis results in limited model capacity in the student, which is further\nchallenged when modalities are missing. In this paper, we propose\nNeighbor-to-Self Graph Transformer (NTSFormer), a unified Graph Transformer\nframework that jointly tackles the isolation and missing-modality issues via a\nself-teaching paradigm. Specifically, NTSFormer uses a cold-start attention\nmask to simultaneously make two predictions for each node: a \"student\"\nprediction based only on self-information (i.e., the node's own features), and\na \"teacher\" prediction incorporating both self and neighbor information. This\nenables the model to supervise itself without degrading to an MLP, thereby\nfully leveraging the Transformer's capacity to handle missing modalities. To\nhandle diverse graph information and missing modalities, NTSFormer performs a\none-time multimodal graph pre-computation that converts structural and feature\ndata into token sequences, which are then processed by a Mixture-of-Experts\n(MoE) Input Projection and Transformer layers for effective fusion.\nExperimental results on public datasets show that NTSFormer achieves superior\nperformance on multimodal cold-start node classification tasks.",

We present\na data-driven method for estimating the largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE) from\none-dimensional chaotic time series using machine learning. A predictor is\ntrained to produce out-of-sample, multi-horizon forecasts; the LLE is then\ninferred from the exponential growth of the geometrically averaged forecast\nerror (GMAE) across the horizon, which serves as a proxy for trajectory\ndivergence. We validate the approach on four canonical 1D maps-logistic, sine,\ncubic, and Chebyshev-achieving R2pos > 0.99 against reference LLE curves with\nseries as short as M = 450. Among baselines, KNN yields the closest fits (KNN-R\ncomparable; RF larger deviations). By design the estimator targets positive\nexponents: in periodic/stable regimes it returns values indistinguishable from\nzero. Noise robustness is assessed by adding zero-mean white measurement noise\nand summarizing performance versus the average SNR over parameter sweeps:\naccuracy saturates for SNRm > 30 dB and collapses below 27 dB, a conservative\nsensor-level benchmark. The method is simple, computationally efficient, and\nmodel-agnostic, requiring only stationarity and the presence of a dominant\npositive exponent.

SELD is a complex task that combines\ntemporal event classification with spatial localization, requiring reasoning\nacross spatial, temporal, and semantic dimensions. The last is arguably the\nmost challenging to model. Traditional SELD architectures rely on multichannel\ninput, which limits their ability to leverage large-scale pre-training due to\ndata constraints. To address this, we enhance standard SELD architectures with\nsemantic information by integrating pre-trained, contrastive language-aligned\nmodels: CLAP for audio and OWL-ViT for visual inputs. These embeddings are\nincorporated into a modified Conformer module tailored for multimodal fusion,\nwhich we refer to as the Cross-Modal Conformer. Additionally, we incorporate\nautocorrelation-based acoustic features to improve distance estimation. We\npre-train our models on curated synthetic audio and audio-visual datasets and\napply a left-right channel swapping augmentation to further increase the\ntraining data. Both our audio-only and audio-visual systems substantially\noutperform the challenge baselines on the development set, demonstrating the\neffectiveness of our strategy.

On-satellite machine learning (ML) offers a potential\nsolution, by reducing latency associated with transmission of these large data\nvolumes to ground stations, but state-of-the-art models are often too large or\npower-hungry for satellite deployment. Vessel detection using Synthetic\nAperture Radar (SAR) is a critical time-sensitive task for maritime security\nthat exemplifies this challenge.

Most of the existing metrics that are used for comparing the local and\nglobal shape of the embedding against the original one are highly expensive in\nterms of time and space complexity. In order to address this issue, the\nobjective of this study is to formulate a novel metric, called Clustering\nguided METric (CMET), for quantifying embedding quality. It is effective to\nserve the purpose of quantitative comparison between an embedding and the\noriginal data. CMET consists of two scores, viz., CMET_L and CMET_G, that\nmeasure the degree of local and global shape preservation capability,\nrespectively.

In contrast to conventional training regimes\nthat depend heavily on artificial transformations, pre-generated models, or 3D\ndata, RIPE requires only a binary label indicating whether paired images\nrepresent the same scene. This minimal supervision significantly expands the\npool of training data, enabling the creation of a highly generalized and robust\nkeypoint extractor.\n  RIPE utilizes the encoder's intermediate layers for the description of the\nkeypoints with a hyper-column approach to integrate information from different\nscales.

By integrating Tsallis\nnon-extensive statistics with topological thermodynamics, we analyze the local\nand global stability of various black hole solutions, including Schwarzschild,\nReissner-Nordstrom, and higher-dimensional black holes. The introduction of\nTsallis entropy, parameterized by the non-extensive parameter delta, results in\ndistinct thermodynamic behaviors depending on its value. Employing Duan's\nphi-mapping theory, we classify the thermodynamic topology of four-dimensional\nSchwarzschild black holes and non-charged higher-dimensional black holes into\nthree distinct classes based on their topological number W: stable (W = +1),\nunstable (W = -1), and critical (W = 0). Additionally, the thermodynamic\ntopology of Reissner-Nordstrom and charged higher-dimensional black holes is\ncategorized into two classes, where W = +1 indicates a stable class and W = 0\nrepresents a less stable class. Our study further demonstrates that the number\nof dimensions does not affect the topological thermodynamics within the context\nof non-extensive statistics.

This study fundamentally questions whether such\nartificial inductive biases are, in fact, over-engineering. Through experiments\nwith the ``AI Mother Tongue'' (AIM) framework, based on a Vector Quantized\nVariational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE), we demonstrate that when agents possess an\nendogenous symbol system, their neural representations naturally exhibit\nspontaneous semantic compression and Nash equilibrium-driven semantic\nconvergence, achieving effective symbolic communication without external\ninductive biases.

Processing\nunder high pressure via the high-pressure torsion (HPT) method offers new\npathways for severe plastic deformation (SPD) of ceramics. This article reviews\nrecent advances in HPT processing of ceramics, focusing primarily on\ntraditional ceramics (e.g., oxides, carbides, nitrides, oxynitrides) and to a\nlesser extent advanced ceramics (e.g., silicon, carbon, perovskites,\nclathrates). Key structural and microstructural features of SPD-processed\nceramics are discussed, including phase transformations and the generation of\nnanograins and defects such as vacancies and dislocations. The properties and\napplications of these deformed ceramics are summarized, including powder\nconsolidation, photoluminescence, bandgap narrowing, photovoltaics,\nphotocatalysis (dye degradation, plastic waste degradation, antibiotic\ndegradation, hydrogen production, CO2 conversion), electrocatalysis,\nthermoelectric performance, dielectric performance, and ion conductivity for\nLi-ion batteries. Additionally, the article highlights the role of HPT in\nsynthesizing novel materials, such as high-entropy ceramics (particularly\nhigh-entropy oxides), black oxides, and high-pressure polymorphs, which hold\npromise for energy and environmental applications.",

    "abstract": "Weyl quasiparticles, as gapless low-energy excitations with nontrivial\nchirality, have garnered extensive interest in recent years. However,\narchieving effective and reversible control over their chirality (topological\ncharge) remains a major challeng due to topological protection. In this work,\nwe propose a ferroelectric mechanism to switch the chirality of Weyl phonons,\nwhere the reversal of ferroelectric polarization is intrinsically coupled to a\nsimultaneous reversal of the chirality of Weyl points. This enables\nelectric-field-driven control over the topological properties of phonon\nexcitations. Through a comprehensive symmetry analysis of polar space groups,\nwe identify 27 groups capable of hosting symmetry-protected Weyl phonons with\nchiral charges $C = 1$, $2$, and $3$, whose chirality can be reversed via\npolarization switching. The first-principles calculations are performed to\nscreen feasible material candidates for each type of chirality, yielding a set\nof prototypical ferroelectric compounds that realize the proposed mechanism. As\na representative example, K$_2$ZnBr$_4$ hosts the minimal configuration of two\npairs of Weyl phonons. Upon polarization reversal, the chirality of all Weyl\npoints is inverted, accompanied by a reversal of associated topological\nfeatures such as Berry curvature and surface phonon arcs. These findings\nprovide a viable pathway for dynamic, electrical control of topological band\ncrossings and open new avenues for chirality-based phononic applications.",

The core was observed in the two lowest\nrotational lines of ortho- and para-NH2D using the APEX and the IRAM 30 m\ntelescopes. The ground-state lines of ortho- and para-NHD2 were observed with\nAPEX. The distributions of chemical abundances in the core were predicted using\na gas-grain chemistry model with two different scenarios concerning proton\ntransfer reactions in the gas. One of the scenarios, the so-called full\nscrambling (FS), allows protons and deuterons to be completely mixed in the\nintermediate reaction complex before dissociation, whereas the other describes\nthese reactions as proton or deuteron hops (PH). We also tested assumed\nabundance profiles independent of the chemistry models. Radiative transfer\ncalculations were used to simulate the observed NH2D and NHD2 lines from the\npredicted and assumed abundance profiles. Our modelling efforts suggest that\nthe ground-state lines of NH2D and NHD2 at the wavelength 0.9 mm that are\nobservable with the same beam and in the same spectrometer band are the most\nreliable probes of the o/p ratios. Simulations using the PH reaction scheme\nshow systematically better agreement with the observations than simulations\nwith the FS model. Simulations using a broken power law abundance profile as a\nfunction of the gas density give spin ratios that are close to the predictions\nof the PH scenario: o/p-NH2D=2.85+-0.05, o/p-NHD2=2.10+-0.06 (1 sigma). The o/p\nratios predicted by the PH scenario in the gas phase correspond to the nuclear\nspin statistical weights, that is, o/p-NH2D=3, o/p-NHD2=2. In view of the fact\nthat H and D atom addition reactions on grain surfaces also result in these\nratios, it is reasonable to assume that the spin ratios of interstellar ammonia\nand its deuterated forms are in general equal to their statistical values.",

While the optimal probe for estimating a single unitary phase is\nwell understood - being a pure state that is an equal superposition of the\neigenvectors of the encoding Hamiltonian corresponding to its maximum and\nminimum eigenvalues - the structure of optimal probes in the multiparameter\nsetting remains more intricate. We investigate the simultaneous estimation of\ntwo phases, each encoded through arbitrary qubit Hamiltonians, using arbitrary\nweight matrices, and considering single-qubit probes. We also consider\nsingle-qutrit probes, for which the encoding Hamiltonians are chosen as SU(2)\ngenerators. We find that in both the qubit and qutrit scenarios, the optimal\nprobe is a coherent superposition of the eigenstates corresponding to the\nlargest and smallest eigenvalues of the total encoding Hamiltonian, with a\nfixed - and not arbitrary - relative phase. Remarkably, this optimal probe is\nindependent of the specific choice of weight matrix, making it a universally\noptimal input state for the estimation of any pair of SU(2) parameters, which\ncan be reparameterized to the phase estimation problem. Furthermore, we show\nthat this probe also maximizes the determinant of the quantum Fisher\ninformation matrix, providing a handy tool for identifying the optimal probe\nstate. We also examine the role of commutativity between the generators of the\nunitary encodings. Our results demonstrate that a high degree of commutativity\ndegrades the achievable precision, rendering estimation infeasible in the\nextreme case. However, maximal noncommutativity does not necessarily yield\noptimal precision.",

Existing attacks typically target the entire user group, which\ncompromises stealth and increases the risk of detection. In contrast,\nreal-world adversaries may prefer to prompt target items to specific user\nsubgroups, such as recommending health supplements to elderly users. Motivated\nby this gap, we introduce Spattack, the first targeted poisoning attack\ndesigned to manipulate recommendations for specific user subgroups in the\nfederated setting. Specifically, Spattack adopts a two-stage\napproximation-and-promotion strategy, which first simulates user embeddings of\ntarget/non-target subgroups and then prompts target items to the target\nsubgroups. To enhance the approximation stage, we push the inter-group\nembeddings away based on contrastive learning and augment the target group's\nrelevant item set based on clustering. To enhance the promotion stage, we\nfurther propose to adaptively tune the optimization weights between target and\nnon-target subgroups. Besides, an embedding alignment strategy is proposed to\nalign the embeddings between the target items and the relevant items. We\nconduct comprehensive experiments on three real-world datasets, comparing\nSpattack against seven state-of-the-art poisoning attacks and seven\nrepresentative defense mechanisms. Experimental results demonstrate that\nSpattack consistently achieves strong manipulation performance on the specific\nuser subgroup, while incurring minimal impact on non-target users, even when\nonly 0.1\\% of users are malicious.

However, bulk grain size shows significant stability\nagainst SHI in all cases. These findings align with thermal spike simulations\nand indicate the formation of ion tracks due to electronic excitation by Swift\nHeavy Ion beam irradiation.",

    "abstract": "The task of describing video content in natural language is commonly referred\nto as video captioning. Unlike conventional video captions, which are typically\nbrief and widely available, long-form paragraph descriptions in natural\nlanguage are scarce. This limitation of current datasets is due to the\nexpensive human manual annotation required and to the highly challenging task\nof explaining the language formation process from the perspective of the\nunderlying story, as a complex system of interconnected events in space and\ntime. Through a thorough analysis of recently published methods and available\ndatasets, we identify a general lack of published resources dedicated to the\nproblem of describing videos in complex language, beyond the level of\ndescriptions in the form of enumerations of simple captions. Furthermore, while\nstate-of-the-art methods produce impressive results on the task of generating\nshorter captions from videos by direct end-to-end learning between the videos\nand text, the problem of explaining the relationship between vision and\nlanguage is still beyond our reach. In this work, we propose a shared\nrepresentation between vision and language, based on graphs of events in space\nand time, which can be obtained in an explainable and analytical way, to\nintegrate and connect multiple vision tasks to produce the final natural\nlanguage description. Moreover, we also demonstrate how our automated and\nexplainable video description generation process can function as a fully\nautomatic teacher to effectively train direct, end-to-end neural student\npathways, within a self-supervised neuro-analytical system. We validate that\nour explainable neuro-analytical approach generates coherent, rich and relevant\ntextual descriptions on videos collected from multiple varied datasets, using\nboth standard evaluation metrics, human annotations and consensus from\nensembles of state-of-the-art VLMs.",

In the concluding Part II of\nthe paper, we carry out the deduction of the formalism from the\nphenomenological inputs described in Part I.

Analogues of the\nobtained elementary building blocks -- such as projection operators -- are\nreadily identifiable within the standard formalism.

These differences do\nnot negate the fact that both formalisms are in perfect agreement with respect\nto empirically testable predictions.

The realization of this vision\nrelies heavily on efficient interactions with nonlinear systems. Therefore,\nKoopman learning, which leverages the power of deep learning to linearize\nnonlinear systems, has been one of the most successful examples of mitigating\nthe complexity inherent in nonlinearity. However, the existing literature\nassumes access to accurate system states and abundant high-quality data for\nKoopman analysis, which is usually impractical in real-world scenarios. To fill\nthis void, this paper considers the case where only observations of the system\nare available and where the observation data is insufficient to accomplish an\nindependent Koopman analysis. To this end, we propose Kalman Filter aided\nFederated Koopman Learning (KF-FedKL), which pioneers the combination of Kalman\nfiltering and federated learning with Koopman analysis. By doing so, we can\nachieve collaborative linearization with privacy guarantees. Specifically, we\nemploy a straightforward yet efficient loss function to drive the training of a\ndeep Koopman network for linearization. To obtain system information devoid of\nindividual information from observation data, we leverage the unscented Kalman\nfilter and the unscented Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoother. To achieve collaboration\nbetween clients, we adopt the federated learning framework and develop a\nmodified FedAvg algorithm to orchestrate the collaboration.

Using random forests (RFs) with extreme gradient boosting (XGB) trained\non WRF-SLUCM output over Zurich, Switzerland, during heatwave (HW) periods in\n2017 and 2019, this study proposes LUT-based (LB) models that categorize\nfeatures by scales and practical controllability, allowing optional categorical\nweighting. This approach enables category-specific feature ranking and\nsensitivity estimation of T2 and TSK to most important small-scale drivers -\nmost notably surface emissivity, albedo, and leaf area index (LAI). Models\nemploying the LB framework are statistically significantly more accurate than\nmodels that do not, with higher performance when more HW data is included in\ntraining. With RF-XGB robustly performing optimal with unit weights, the method\nsubstantially increase interpretability. Despite the needs to reduce\nstatistical uncertainties and testing the method on other cities, the proposed\napproach offers urban planners a direct framework for feasibility-centered UHI\nmitigation assessment.",

    "abstract": "Most masked point cloud modeling (MPM) methods follow a regression paradigm\nto reconstruct the coordinate or feature of masked regions. However, they tend\nto over-constrain the model to learn the details of the masked region,\nresulting in failure to capture generalized features. To address this\nlimitation, we propose \\textbf{\\textit{PointGAC}}, a novel clustering-based MPM\nmethod that aims to align the feature distribution of masked regions.\nSpecially, it features an online codebook-guided teacher-student framework.\nFirstly, it presents a geometry-aware partitioning strategy to extract initial\npatches. Then, the teacher model updates a codebook via online k-means based on\nfeatures extracted from the complete patches. This procedure facilitates\ncodebook vectors to become cluster centers. Afterward, we assigns the unmasked\nfeatures to their corresponding cluster centers, and the student model aligns\nthe assignment for the reconstructed masked features. This strategy focuses on\nidentifying the cluster centers to which the masked features belong, enabling\nthe model to learn more generalized feature representations. Benefiting from a\nproposed codebook maintenance mechanism, codebook vectors are actively updated,\nwhich further increases the efficiency of semantic feature learning.\nExperiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method on various\ndownstream tasks.

High-fidelity control is achieved by co-simulating the\noptimizer with a BESS electro-thermal simulation that models spatial thermal\ndynamics of the battery, providing real-time State of Charge (SOC) and\ntemperature feedback. The optimizer prioritizes reliability by enforcing power\navailability as a hard constraint and penalizing battery thermal derating.\nWithin these bounds, the controller performs a Pareto sweep on the relative\nweights of inverter and battery losses to balance the trade-off between\ninverter efficiency and battery efficiency. The inverter loss model is based on\nan empirical lookup table (LUT) derived from a commercial inverter system,\nwhile the battery thermal loss model uses SOC and temperature-dependent\ninternal resistance, with electric current computed from the battery Equivalent\nCircuit Model (ECM). When the optimization was applied to a two-string BESS,\nthe competing effects of inverter and battery losses on system availability and\nthermal derating were observed. The balanced operation yielded improvements of\n1% in battery efficiency, 1.5% in inverter efficiency, and 2% in derating\nefficiency, while maintaining higher availability. Additionally, a 5 degrees C\nreduction in BESS peak temperature also suggests reduced thermal stress without\ncompromising availability.",

One of the primary objectives is\nto construct codes with minimal redundancy. Currently, the best known\nconstructions of $q$-ary codes correcting a burst of at most $t$ deletions\n($(\\le t)$-burst-deletion correcting codes) achieve redundancy $\\log\nn+8\\log\\log n+o(\\log\\log n)$ (for any $q$ and $t$) or $\\log n+t\\log\\log n+O(1)$\n(for even $q$).

Here, $n$ denotes the code-length,\nand $q$ and $t$ are fixed. These codes employ a position-estimation component\nto approximate error positions, augmented by additional constraints that enable\nerror-correction given the information about error positions.\n  In this work, we select codewords from the set of sequences whose\ndifferential sequences are strong-$(\\ell,\\epsilon)$-locally-balanced.

In the attempting step, we attempt to prune a pre-defined\nnumber of channels from one layer by using any existing channel pruning methods\nand estimate the accuracy drop for this layer based on the labelled samples in\nthe validation set. In the selecting step, based on the estimated accuracy\ndrops for all layers, we propose a greedy strategy to automatically select a\nset of layers that will lead to less overall accuracy drop after pruning these\nlayers. In the pruning step, we prune a small number of channels from these\nselected layers. We further extend our PCP framework to prune channels for the\ndeep transfer learning methods like Domain Adversarial Neural Network (DANN),\nin which we effectively reduce the data distribution mismatch in the channel\npruning process by using both labelled samples from the source domain and\npseudo-labelled samples from the target domain.

    "abstract": "When approached by predators, prey must decide whether to flee or remain and\nfight. The economics of such decisions are underlain by the trade-off between\ncurrent and residual fitness. The trade-off predicts that (i) breeders should\nbe less prone than non-breeders to flee from approaching predators, as breeders\ncan lose their investment into current reproduction; (ii) among breeders,\nparents should increasingly defend their offspring with increasing investment\ninto the brood (brood value hypothesis), at least until the offspring can\nindependently take part in anti-predator defenses; and (iii) for a similar\ninvestment into reproduction, breeders with lower perspectives to fledge or\nwean their young should invest less into offspring defense. We tested these\npredictions in a colonially breeding seabird, the king penguin (Aptenodytes\npatagonicus). Specifically, we considered how antipredator behaviors varied\naccording to life history stage (molting, courting, breeding), offspring age\nand their dependence on parents for antipredator defenses, and the timing of\nbreeding, with late breeders being very unlikely to fledge offspring in this\nspecies. Using non-lethal human approaches to mimic the threat of predation, we\napproached >500 penguins and measured their alert and flight initiation\ndistances, as well as the distance fled. We found that birds show increasingly\nstronger antipredator behaviors as they initiate and increase their investment\ninto reproduction, from non-reproductive stages to courting and brooding small,\nthermo-dependent chicks. However, once offspring gained thermal independence\nand freedom of movement, parents reduced their antipredator behaviors. Late\nbreeders were more likely to flee from the approaching threat than early\nbreeders. Altogether, our results demonstrate that parental antipredator\nresponses are dynamic and shaped by the levels 3 of investment into current\nreproduction, the ability of offspring to defend themselves, and the perceived\nfuture value of the brood.",

This material has been\nincorporated into electronic processes since the mid-2000s.

The Fe-JoFET exhibits\nsignificant hysteresis in the switching current and normal-state resistance\ntransfer characteristics, which depend on the range of gate voltages. This\nphenomenon opens a new research area exploring the interaction between\nferroelectricity and superconductivity in hybrid superconducting-semiconducting\nsystems, with potential applications in cryogenic data storage and computation.\nSupporting this, the Fe-JoFET was operated as a cryogenic superconducting\nsingle memory cell, exhibiting both dissipative and non-dissipative states. Its\nnon-volatility was tested over a 24-hour measurement period. We also\ndemonstrated that the Fe-JoFET can retain information at temperatures above the\nsuperconductor critical temperature, resulting in a temperature-fault-tolerant\nmemory cell resistant to temperature oscillations or, in the worst case,\ncryostat faults.",

    "abstract": "Emotion alignment between music and palettes is crucial for effective\nmultimedia content, yet misalignment creates confusion that weakens the\nintended message. However, existing methods often generate only a single\ndominant color, missing emotion variation. Others rely on indirect mappings\nthrough text or images, resulting in the loss of crucial emotion details. To\naddress these challenges, we present Music2Palette, a novel method for\nemotion-aligned color palette generation via cross-modal representation\nlearning. We first construct MuCED, a dataset of 2,634 expert-validated\nmusic-palette pairs aligned through Russell-based emotion vectors. To directly\ntranslate music into palettes, we propose a cross-modal representation learning\nframework with a music encoder and color decoder. We further propose a\nmulti-objective optimization approach that jointly enhances emotion alignment,\ncolor diversity, and palette coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nour method outperforms current methods in interpreting music emotion and\ngenerating attractive and diverse color palettes. Our approach enables\napplications like music-driven image recoloring, video generating, and data\nvisualization, bridging the gap between auditory and visual emotion\nexperiences.",

    "abstract": "Personalized text generation has become crucial for adapting language models\nto diverse and evolving users' personal context across cultural, temporal, and\ncontextual dimensions. While existing methods often rely on centralized\nfine-tuning or static preference alignment, they struggle to achieve real-time\nadaptation under resource constraints inherent to personal devices. This\nlimitation creates a dilemma: large cloud-based models lack access to localized\nuser-specific information, while small on-device models cannot match the\ngeneration quality of their cloud counterparts. To address this dichotomy, we\npresent CoSteer, a novel collaborative framework that enables decoding-time\npersonalization through localized delta steering. Our key insight lies in\nleveraging the logits difference between personal context-aware and -agnostic\noutputs from local small models as steering signals for cloud-based LLMs.\nSpecifically, we formulate token-level optimization as an online learning\nproblem, where local delta vectors dynamically adjust the remote LLM's logits\nwithin the on-device environment. This approach preserves privacy by\ntransmitting only the final steered tokens rather than raw data or intermediate\nvectors, while maintaining cloud-based LLMs' general capabilities without\nfine-tuning. Through comprehensive experiments on various personalized\ngeneration tasks, we demonstrate that CoSteer effectively assists LLMs in\ngenerating personalized content by leveraging locally stored user profiles and\nhistories, ensuring privacy preservation through on-device data processing\nwhile maintaining acceptable computational overhead.",

This is accomplished by\nadding a simple decoder-only module to the head of an existing decoder block\nthat can be arbitrarily complex. The module learns to process concept\ninformation by implicitly inverting linear representations from an encoder.\nInspired by the notion of intervention in causal graphical models, our module\nselectively modifies its architecture during training, allowing it to learn a\ncompact joint model over different contexts. We show how adding this module\nleads to disentangled representations that can be composed for\nout-of-distribution generation.

In the binary setting, recent work has focused on\nunderstanding the impact of the non-linearity of the logistic model (Faury et\nal., 2020; Abeille et al., 2021). They introduced a problem-dependent constant\n$\\kappa_*$, that may be exponentially large in some problem parameters and\nwhich is captured by the derivative of the sigmoid function.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning when they include\nintermediate steps, known as \"chains of thought\" (CoTs). However, these\nrationales are often overly verbose, even for simple problems, leading to\nwasted context, increased latency, and higher energy consumption. We observe\nthat verbose, English-heavy CoTs and concise, math-centric CoTs occupy distinct\nregions in the model's residual-stream activation space. By extracting and\ninjecting a \"steering vector\" to transition between these modes, we can\nreliably shift generation toward more concise reasoning, effectively\ncompressing CoTs without retraining. We formalize this approach as\nActivation-Steered Compression (ASC), an inference-time technique that shortens\nreasoning traces by directly modifying hidden representations. In addition, we\nprovide a theoretical analysis of the impact of ASC on the output distribution,\nderived from a closed-form KL-divergence-bounded constraint to regulate\nsteering strength. Using only 100 paired verbose and concise examples, ASC\nachieves up to 67.43% reduction in CoT length on MATH500 and GSM8K datasets,\nwhile maintaining accuracy across 7B, 8B, and 32B parameter models. As a\ntraining-free method, ASC introduces negligible runtime overhead and, on\nMATH500, delivers an average 2.73x speedup in end-to-end reasoning wall-clock\ntime on an 8B model. This makes ASC a practical and efficient tool for\nstreamlining the deployment of reasoning-capable LLMs in latency- or\ncost-sensitive settings.

This work\naddresses the problem of linking ballistic capture trajectories - exploiting\nmulti-body dynamics for temporary lunar orbit insertion - with bounded periodic\nmotion described in the circular restricted three-body problem (CR3BP). A\nunified framework is developed for optimizing bi-impulsive transfers to\nfamilies of periodic orbits via a high-order polynomial expansion of the CR3BP\ndynamics. That same expansion underlies a continuous 'abacus' parameterization\nof orbit families, enabling rapid targeting and analytic sensitivity. Transfers\nto planar periodic-orbit families (Lyapunov L1 and L2, and distant retrograde\norbits) are addressed first, followed by extension to spatial families, such as\nbutterfly and halo L1/L2 orbits, with an emphasis towards Near-Rectilinear Halo\nOrbits (NRHOs). Numerical results demonstrate low-cost solutions and validate\nthe method's adaptability for the design of lunar missions. The optimized\ntrajectories can inform an established low-energy transfer database, enriching\nit with detailed cost profiles that reflect both transfer feasibility and\nunderlying dynamical relationships to specific periodic-orbit families.\nFinally, the proposed transfers provide reliable initial guesses for rapid\nrefinement, readily adaptable for further optimization across mission-specific\nneeds.",

However, current approaches face\na critical challenge: they can not simultaneously optimize for functional\ncorrectness and hardware quality (Power, Performance, Area - PPA). Methods\nbased on supervised fine-tuning often generate functionally correct but\nPPA-suboptimal code, lacking mechanisms to learn optimization principles. In\ncontrast, post-processing techniques that attempt to improve PPA metrics after\ngeneration are often inefficient because they operate externally without\nupdating the LLM's parameters, thus failing to enhance the model's intrinsic\ndesign capabilities.\n  To bridge this gap, we introduce ChipSeek-R1, a hierarchical reward-driven\nreinforcement learning framework to train LLMs to generate RTL code that\nachieves both functional correctness and optimized PPA metrics. ChipSeek-R1\nemploys a hierarchical reward system, which incorporates direct feedback on\nsyntax, functional correctness (from simulators) and PPA metrics (from\nsynthesis tools) during reinforcement learning. This enables the model to learn\ncomplex hardware design trade-offs via trial-and-error, generating RTL code\nthat is both functionally correct and PPA-optimized. Evaluating ChipSeek-R1 on\nstandard benchmarks (VerilogEval, RTLLM), we achieve state-of-the-art results\nin functional correctness. Notably, on the RTLLM benchmark, ChipSeek-R1\ngenerated 27 RTL designs surpassing the PPA metrics of the original\nhuman-written code. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating\ntoolchain feedback into LLM training and highlight the potential for\nreinforcement learning to enable automated generation of human-surpassing RTL\ncode.

    "abstract": "Human guidance has emerged as a powerful tool for enhancing reinforcement\nlearning (RL). However, conventional forms of guidance such as demonstrations\nor binary scalar feedback can be challenging to collect or have low information\ncontent, motivating the exploration of other forms of human input. Among these,\nrelative feedback (i.e., feedback on how to improve an action, such as \"more to\nthe left\") offers a good balance between usability and information richness.\nPrevious research has shown that relative feedback can be used to enhance\npolicy search methods. However, these efforts have been limited to specific\npolicy classes and use feedback inefficiently. In this work, we introduce a\nnovel method to learn from relative feedback and combine it with off-policy\nreinforcement learning. Through evaluations on two sparse-reward tasks, we\ndemonstrate our method can be used to improve the sample efficiency of\nreinforcement learning by guiding its exploration process. Additionally, we\nshow it can adapt a policy to changes in the environment or the user's\npreferences. Finally, we demonstrate real-world applicability by employing our\napproach to learn a navigation policy in a sparse reward setting.",

Recently, a unique hidden Rashba effect attracts tremendous\nattention, which arises from the compensation of opposite spin polarizations of\na Rashba bilayer in inversion symmetric crystals with dipole fields, such as\nbismuth oxyselenide ($\\mathrm{Bi}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{2}\\mathrm{Se}$). However,\ninvestigating this effect utilizing conductance quantization is still\nchallenging. Here we report the conductance quantization observed in a chemical\nvapor deposition (CVD)-grown high-mobility\n$\\mathrm{Bi}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{2}\\mathrm{Se}$ nanoribbon, where quantized\nconductance plateaus up to $44\\cdot 2e^{2}/{h}$ ($e$ is the elementary charge,\n$h$ is the Planck constant, and the factor $2$ results from spin degeneracy)\nare achieved at zero magnetic field. Due to the hidden Rashba effect, the\nquantized conductance remains in multiples of $2e^{2}/{h}$ without Zeeman\nsplitting even under magnetic field up to $12$ T. Moreover, within a specific\nrange of magnetic field, the plateau sequence exhibits the Pascal triangle\nseries, namely $(1,3,6,10,15\\dots )\\cdot 2e^{2}/{h}$, reflecting the interplay\nof size quantization in two transverse directions. These observations are well\ncaptured by an effective hidden Rashba bilayer model.

An empirical analysis of DCRS and statistics on the REDIAL\ncorpus show that only 10% of head movies account for nearly half of all\nmentions, whereas about 70% of tail movies receive merely 26% of the attention.\nThis imbalance gives rise to three critical challenges: head over-fitting, body\nrepresentation drift, and tail sparsity. To address these issues, we propose\nLumiCRS, an end-to-end framework that mitigates long-tail imbalance through\nthree mutually reinforcing layers: (i) an Adaptive Comprehensive Focal Loss\n(ACFL) that dynamically adjusts class weights and focusing factors to curb head\nover-fitting and reduce popularity bias; (ii) Prototype Learning for Long-Tail\nRecommendation, which selects semantic, affective, and contextual prototypes to\nguide clustering and stabilize body and tail representations; and (iii) a\nGPT-4o-driven prototype-guided dialogue augmentation module that automatically\ngenerates diverse long-tail conversational snippets to alleviate tail sparsity\nand distribution shift. Together, these strategies enable LumiCRS to markedly\nimprove recommendation accuracy, diversity, and fairness: on the REDIAL and\nINSPIRED benchmarks, LumiCRS boosts Recall@10 and Tail-Recall@10 by 7-15% over\nfifteen strong baselines, while human evaluations confirm superior fluency,\ninformativeness, and long-tail relevance.

In contrast to the\nnumerically suppressed Jarlskog invariant, this expression is computationally\nsimple and less sensitive to approximations. We apply the formula to derive\ngeneral perturbative corrections from charged-lepton mixing $s_{ij}^{e}$ to the\nunderlying CP phase of neutrinos $\\delta_{\\nu}$. A compact analytic expressions\n$\\delta = \\delta_{\\nu} + s_{12}^{e} D_{12} + s_{13}^{e} D_{13} + s_{23}^{e}\nD_{23}$ shows that these corrections can substantially exceed $O(10^{\\circ})$,\npotentially within the reach of future long-baseline experiments such as DUNE\nand T2HK.",

After addressing this, we move to\nthe general theory of number games. We analyze Conway's original definition and\na later refinement by Siegel, and highlight conceptual gaps that have largely\ngone unnoticed.

We benchmark SPATIA\nagainst 13 existing models across 12 individual tasks, which span several\ncategories including cell annotation, cell clustering, gene imputation,\ncross-modal prediction, and image generation.

    "abstract": "We present the results of a deep neutral hydrogen (Hi) observation of the\nearly-type galaxy NGC 2768 using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical\nradio Telescope (FAST). Leveraging the high sensitivity of FAST, we discover an\nextended gas envelope around NGC 2768. The total Hi mass is measured to be 8.1\nx 10^8 M_sun , representing a magnitude increase compared to previous\nWesterbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT) studies. Position-velocity (PV)\ndiagram indicates the envelope mainly involves two components: an Hi disk of\nNGC 2768 and a newly discovered satellite galaxy without detectable\ncounterparts in currently deep optical surveys. The center of the gas disk is\nmis-aligned with the optical disk of NGC 2768, with more gas redshifted,\nindicating it has been disturbed. Our study indicates NGC 2768 is currently\nundergoing a transition from a spiral galaxy to an S0. Previous deep WSRT\nobservations reveal two dense clumps (named as Clumps A and Clump B throughout\nthis paper) in the center of the envelope. We find Clump A corresponds to the\ndensest part of the disk, while Clump B might be a newly discovered satellite\ngalaxy which probably collided NGC 2768 about 0.38 Gyr ago. We also find tidal\ninteractions between Clump B and PGC 2599651, NGC 2768 and UGC 4808. Based on\nthese new findings, we finally analyze hierarchical accretion history of NGC\n2768.",

The continuum limit reproduces free\nfermion correlators, with diagrammatic expansions confirming anticommutation.\nThe work provides the first explicit mapping from neural architectures to\nfermionic QFT at the level of correlation functions and generating functional.\nIt extends NN-QFT beyond bosonic theories and opens avenues for encoding\nfermionic symmetries into machine learning models, with potential applications\nin quantum simulation and lattice field theory.",

Unlike previous methods, we cast shadow\nremoval as diffusion-based inpainting. To this end, we first train a\nshadow-independent structure extraction network on a real-world portrait\ndataset with various synthetic lighting conditions, which allows to generate a\nshadow-independent structure map including facial details while excluding the\nunwanted shadow boundaries. The structure map is then used as condition to\ntrain a structure-guided inpainting diffusion model for removing shadows in a\ngenerative manner. Finally, to restore the fine-scale details (e.g., eyelashes,\nmoles and spots) that may not be captured by the structure map, we take the\ngradients inside the shadow regions as guidance and train a detail restoration\ndiffusion model to refine the shadow removal result. Extensive experiments on\nthe benchmark datasets show that our method clearly outperforms existing\nmethods, and is effective to avoid previously common issues such as facial\nidentity tampering, shadow residual, color distortion, structure blurring, and\nloss of details.

In this paper, we propose the\nModulation Joint KAN (MJKAN), a novel neural network layer designed to overcome\nthese challenges. MJKAN integrates a FiLM (Feature-wise Linear Modulation)-like\nmechanism with Radial Basis Function (RBF) activations, creating a hybrid\narchitecture that combines the non-linear expressive power of KANs with the\nefficiency of Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs). We empirically validated MJKAN's\nperformance across a diverse set of benchmarks, including function regression,\nimage classification (MNIST, CIFAR-10/100), and natural language processing (AG\nNews, SMS Spam). The results demonstrate that MJKAN achieves superior\napproximation capabilities in function regression tasks, significantly\noutperforming MLPs, with performance improving as the number of basis functions\nincreases. Conversely, in image and text classification, its performance was\ncompetitive with MLPs but revealed a critical dependency on the number of basis\nfunctions. We found that a smaller basis size was crucial for better\ngeneralization, highlighting that the model's capacity must be carefully tuned\nto the complexity of the data to prevent overfitting.

In\nthis paper, we propose Soft Weight Rescaling (SWR), a novel approach that\nprevents unbounded weight growth without losing information.

The core idea behind ChangeBridge is to modeling the noise-to-image\ndiffusion model, as a pre-to-post diffusion bridge. Conditioned on multimodal\ncontrols, ChangeBridge leverages a stochastic Brownian-bridge diffusion,\ndirectly modeling the spatiotemporal evolution between pre-event and post-event\nstates. To the best of our knowledge, ChangeBridge is the first spatiotemporal\ngenerative model with multimodal controls for remote sensing.

In this paper, we address the problem of efficiently approximating ER on\na graph $\\mathcal{G}=(\\mathcal{V},\\mathcal{E})$ with $n$ vertices and $m$\nedges. First, we focus on local online-computation algorithms for ER\napproximation, aiming to improve the dependency on the approximation error\nparameter $\\epsilon$. Specifically, for a given vertex pair $(s,t)$, we propose\na local algorithm with a time complexity of $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{d}/\\epsilon)$ to\ncompute an $\\epsilon$-approximation of the $s,t$-ER value for expander graphs,\nwhere $d=\\min \\{d_s,d_t\\}$.

Our method\nachieves this improvement by combining deterministic search with random walk\nsampling to reduce variance. Second, we establish a lower bound for ER\napproximation on expander graphs. We prove that for any $\\epsilon\\in (0,1)$,\nthere exist an expander graph and a vertex pair $(s,t)$ such that any local\nalgorithm requires at least $\\Omega(1/\\epsilon)$ time to compute the\n$\\epsilon$-approximation of the $s,t$-ER value.

These\nlensing B-modes can be removed -- i.e., delensed -- using observations of the\nE-modes and a proxy of the matter fluctuations along the line of sight that\ncaused the deflections. The number density and redshift reach of galaxy surveys\nsuch as the upcoming Rubin observatory offer attractive prospects for using\nthem to delens B-mode data from CMB experiments such as the Simons Observatory,\nLiteBIRD or CMB-S4. However, stochasticity and non-linear galaxy bias may in\nprinciple decorrelate the galaxy field from the matter distribution responsible\nfor the lensing effect, thus hindering efforts to delens B-modes. In addition,\nnon-linear gravitational evolution and bias introduce non-Gaussianities in the\nlarge-scale structure which further complicate the modelling. We quantify these\neffects by populating an N-body simulation with a magnitude-limited,\nphotometric sample of galaxies similar to Rubin's gold selection, and using\nthem to delens CMB maps lensed by the same matter distribution.

In this work, we demonstrate the\nfirst uniquely nonlinear manifestation of this correspondence: fractional\nThouless pumping of solitons. Through systematic investigation of nonlinear\nThouless pumping in an extended Rice-Mele model with next-nearest-neighbor\n(NNN) couplings, we discover that the NNN parameters can induce fractional\ntopological phases despite quantized topological invariants from conventional\napproaches. Crucially, these fractional phases are explained within the\nauxiliary eigenvalue framework, linking nonlinear spectral features directly to\nbulk-boundary correspondence.

This understanding might be applied to formulate a new class of\nprotocols for distilling quantum magic from contextually and nonlocally\nentangled photons within inseparable field modes.",

    "abstract": "Navigation is a fundamental capacity for mobile robots, enabling them to\noperate autonomously in complex and dynamic environments. Conventional\napproaches use probabilistic models to localize robots and build maps\nsimultaneously using sensor observations. Recent approaches employ\nhuman-inspired learning, such as imitation and reinforcement learning, to\nnavigate robots more effectively. However, these methods suffer from high\ncomputational costs, global map inconsistency, and poor generalization to\nunseen environments. This paper presents a novel method inspired by how humans\nperceive and navigate themselves effectively in novel environments.\nSpecifically, we first build local frames that mimic how humans represent\nessential spatial information in the short term. Points in local frames are\nhybrid representations, including spatial information and learned features,\nso-called spatial-implicit local frames. Then, we integrate spatial-implicit\nlocal frames into the global topological map represented as a factor graph.\nLastly, we developed a novel navigation algorithm based on Rapid-Exploring\nRandom Tree Star (RRT*) that leverages spatial-implicit local frames and the\ntopological map to navigate effectively in environments. To validate our\napproach, we conduct extensive experiments in real-world datasets and in-lab\nenvironments.

The BVM approach introduces a novel\nsuperconductor-based methodology for in-memory arithmetic, achieving\nultra-high-speed and energy-efficient computation by utilizing BVM arrays for\nin-memory computation. The design employs a tiled multiplier structure where\nBVM's inherent current summation capability is combined with Quantizer Buffer\n(QB) cells to convert the analog accumulated current into a variable number of\ndigital Single Flux Quantum (SFQ) pulses. These pulses are then processed by T1\nadder cells, which handle binary addition and carry propagation, thereby\nforming a complete functional multiplier unit. This paper thus presents an\nefficient MVM architecture that uses these BVM-based multipliers in a systolic\narray configuration to enable parallel computation. A key innovation is an\noptimized BVM array structure specifically tailored for multiplication\napplications, involving a restructuring of Sense Lines (SLs) with diagonal\nconnections to reduce area and an adjusted input scheme to enhance\ncomputational efficiency compared to the general-purpose BVM array design. We\ndemonstrate the efficacy of this approach with a 4-bit multiplier operating at\n20 GHz with 50 ps latency and an MVM structure demonstrating operation at 20\nGHz. Furthermore, we showcase how this multiplier design can be extended to\nsupport Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) operations.

Existing methods primarily aim to improve identification\nperformance, but often overlook the uncertainty arising from inherent defects,\nsuch as intra-modal noise and inter-modal conflicts. This uncertainty is\nparticularly significant in the case of fine-grained local occlusion and frame\nloss, which becomes a challenge in multi-modal learning. To address the above\nchallenge, we propose a robust approach named Uncertainty-Guided Graph model\nfor multi-modal object ReID (UGG-ReID). UGG-ReID is designed to mitigate noise\ninterference and facilitate effective multi-modal fusion by estimating both\nlocal and sample-level aleatoric uncertainty and explicitly modeling their\ndependencies. Specifically, we first propose the Gaussian patch-graph\nrepresentation model that leverages uncertainty to quantify fine-grained local\ncues and capture their structural relationships. This process boosts the\nexpressiveness of modal-specific information, ensuring that the generated\nembeddings are both more informative and robust. Subsequently, we design an\nuncertainty-guided mixture of experts strategy that dynamically routes samples\nto experts exhibiting low uncertainty. This strategy effectively suppresses\nnoise-induced instability, leading to enhanced robustness. Meanwhile, we design\nan uncertainty-guided routing to strengthen the multi-modal interaction,\nimproving the performance. UGG-ReID is comprehensively evaluated on five\nrepresentative multi-modal object ReID datasets, encompassing diverse spectral\nmodalities.

To this end, we introduce Edge ultra-lIte BERT\nframework (EI-BERT) with a novel cross-distillation method. EI-BERT efficiently\ncompresses models through a comprehensive pipeline including hard token\npruning, cross-distillation and parameter quantization. Specifically, the\ncross-distillation method uniquely positions the teacher model to understand\nthe student model's perspective, ensuring efficient knowledge transfer through\nparameter integration and the mutual interplay between models. Through\nextensive experiments, we achieve a remarkably compact BERT-based model of only\n1.91 MB - the smallest to date for Natural Language Understanding (NLU) tasks.\nThis ultra-compact model has been successfully deployed across multiple\nscenarios within the Alipay ecosystem, demonstrating significant improvements\nin real-world applications. For example, it has been integrated into Alipay's\nlive Edge Recommendation system since January 2024, currently serving the app's\nrecommendation traffic across \\textbf{8.4 million daily active devices}.",

Advanced methods predominantly focus on\nlanguage-centric tuning while less exploring multimodal tokens mixed through\nattention, posing challenges in high-level tasks that require fine-grained\ncognition and emotion understanding. In this work, we identify the attention\ndeficit disorder problem in multimodal learning, caused by inconsistent\ncross-modal attention and layer-by-layer decayed attention activation. To\naddress this, we propose a novel attention mechanism, termed MOdular Duplex\nAttention (MODA), simultaneously conducting the inner-modal refinement and\ninter-modal interaction. MODA employs a correct-after-align strategy to\neffectively decouple modality alignment from cross-layer token mixing. In the\nalignment phase, tokens are mapped to duplex modality spaces based on the basis\nvectors, enabling the interaction between visual and language modality.\nFurther, the correctness of attention scores is ensured through adaptive masked\nattention, which enhances the model's flexibility by allowing customizable\nmasking patterns for different modalities. Extensive experiments on 21\nbenchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of MODA in perception, cognition,\nand emotion tasks. Source code and demo are available in\nhttps://zzcheng.top/MODA.",

The optimization process often requires numerous iterations to\nachieve satisfactory performance, resulting in high computational costs due to\nthe need for frequent prompt evaluations under intensive LLM interactions and\nrepeated policy updates. Appropriate online prompt selection methods reduce\niteration steps by prioritizing informative prompts during training, while the\npipeline's reliance on exhaustive prompt evaluation and subset selection for\noptimization still incurs substantial computational overhead due to frequent\nLLM inference calls. Distinguished from these direct evaluate-then-select\nschemes, this work investigates iterative approximate evaluation for arbitrary\nprompts and introduces Model Predictive Prompt Selection (MoPPS), a Bayesian\nrisk-predictive framework that online estimates prompt difficulty without\nrequiring costly LLM interactions.

Our framework\ndemonstrates strong compatibility with existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models,\nwhich effectively address the initialization and prior subproblem. Extensive\nexperiments validate the superiority of the proposed DDU framework, showcasing\nimproved performance while maintaining comparable parameter counts and\ncomputational complexity. These results suggest that DDU provides a solid\nfoundation for future unfolding-based methods in DSSI.",

    "abstract": "6G networks promise revolutionary immersive communication experiences\nincluding augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and holographic\ncommunications. These applications demand high-dimensional multimodal data\ntransmission and intelligent data processing in real-time, which is extremely\nchallenging over resource-limited wireless communication systems. Moreover, a\njoint understanding of the environment, context, and user intent is essential\nto deliver task-relevant content effectively. This article presents a novel\nmultimodal large language model (MLLM) integrated semantic communications\nframework, termed MLLM-SC, which fully leverages reasoning and generative\ncapabilities of pre-trained foundation models for context-aware and\ntask-oriented wireless communication. The MLLM-SC framework adopts a\ndevice-edge collaborative architecture. At the edge, MLLM-empowered semantic\nguidance module analyzes multimodal inputs, user intents, and channel\nconditions to generate importance-aware attention maps prioritizing\nsemantically critical information. An importance-aware semantic encoder and a\nresource-adaptive semantic decoder are jointly designed and optimized, which\ncan utilize the semantic guidance for adaptive bandwidth allocation and\nhigh-quality content reconstruction or generation. Extensive case studies on\nvisual question answering for AR/VR applications and diffusion-driven image\ngeneration validate the effectiveness of MLLM-SC.",

To address these issues, we propose an Intent-Driven Adaptive\nGeneralized Collaboration (IDAGC) framework that leverages multimodal data and\nhuman intent estimation to facilitate adaptive policy learning across\nmulti-tasks in diverse scenarios, thereby facilitating autonomous inference of\ncollaboration modes and dynamic adjustment of robotic actions. This framework\novercomes the limitations of existing HRC methods, which are typically\nrestricted to a single collaboration mode and lack the capacity to identify and\ntransition between diverse states. Central to our framework is a predictive\nmodel that captures the interdependencies among vision, language, force, and\nrobot state data to accurately recognize human intentions with a Conditional\nVariational Autoencoder (CVAE) and automatically switch collaboration modes. By\nemploying dedicated encoders for each modality and integrating extracted\nfeatures through a Transformer decoder, the framework efficiently learns\nmulti-task policies, while force data optimizes compliance control and intent\nestimation accuracy during physical interactions.

Diffusion models (DMs) have\nshown promise for this task but struggle in low images-per-class (IPC)\nsettings, where generated samples lack diversity. In this paper, we address\nthis issue from an information-theoretic perspective by identifying two key\ntypes of information that a distilled dataset must preserve: ($i$) prototype\ninformation $\\mathrm{I}(X;Y)$, which captures label-relevant features; and\n($ii$) contextual information $\\mathrm{H}(X | Y)$, which preserves intra-class\nvariability. Here, $(X,Y)$ represents the pair of random variables\ncorresponding to the input data and its ground truth label, respectively.\nObserving that the required contextual information scales with IPC, we propose\nmaximizing $\\mathrm{I}(X;Y) + \\beta \\mathrm{H}(X | Y)$ during the DM sampling\nprocess, where $\\beta$ is IPC-dependent. Since directly computing\n$\\mathrm{I}(X;Y)$ and $\\mathrm{H}(X | Y)$ is intractable, we develop\nvariational estimations to tightly lower-bound these quantities via a\ndata-driven approach. Our approach, information-guided diffusion sampling\n(IGDS), seamlessly integrates with diffusion models and improves dataset\ndistillation across all IPC settings.

    "abstract": "Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has gradually emerged as a promising\nparadigm for enhancing the accuracy and factual consistency of content\ngenerated by large language models (LLMs). However, existing RAG studies\nprimarily focus on retrieving isolated segments using similarity-based matching\nmethods, while overlooking the intrinsic connections between them. This\nlimitation hampers performance in RAG tasks. To address this, we propose QMKGF,\na Query-Aware Multi-Path Knowledge Graph Fusion Approach for Enhancing\nRetrieval Augmented Generation. First, we design prompt templates and employ\ngeneral-purpose LLMs to extract entities and relations, thereby generating a\nknowledge graph (KG) efficiently. Based on the constructed KG, we introduce a\nmulti-path subgraph construction strategy that incorporates one-hop relations,\nmulti-hop relations, and importance-based relations, aiming to improve the\nsemantic relevance between the retrieved documents and the user query.\nSubsequently, we designed a query-aware attention reward model that scores\nsubgraph triples based on their semantic relevance to the query. Then, we\nselect the highest score subgraph and enrich subgraph with additional triples\nfrom other subgraphs that are highly semantically relevant to the query.\nFinally, the entities, relations, and triples within the updated subgraph are\nutilised to expand the original query, thereby enhancing its semantic\nrepresentation and improving the quality of LLMs' generation. We evaluate QMKGF\non the SQuAD, IIRC, Culture, HotpotQA, and MuSiQue datasets. On the HotpotQA\ndataset, our method achieves a ROUGE-1 score of 64.98\\%, surpassing the\nBGE-Rerank approach by 9.72 percentage points (from 55.26\\% to 64.98\\%).\nExperimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the QMKGF\napproach.",

It is well known that\nany particle may be torn up near a singularity at the center of a black hole\ndue to the divergent tidal force. However, we find that singularity is not the\nonly cause of tidal force divergence. Even on the surface of the Earth, the\ntidal force experienced by a particle could be arbitrarily large if the\nparticle moves arbitrarily close to the speed of light in a nonradial\ndirection. Usually, a curvature singularity implies geodesic incompleteness\nsince in many cases the metric cannot be defined at the location of the\nsingularity. Counterexamples have been found in recent years, suggesting that\ngeodesics could pass through curvature singularities. By taking into account\nthe fact that any real particle is an extended body, we calculate the tidal\nforce acting on the particle in a static and spherically symmetric spacetime.\nWe explicitly show that an infinite tidal force always occurs near such a\nsingularity. Therefore, no particle can actually reach the curvature\nsingularity even if the metric is well defined at that point. We also show that\nthe tidal acceleration along a null geodesic at the coordinate origin is\ndivergent. For a wormhole solution that has a curvature singularity at the\nthroat but possesses a regular metric, we show that the tidal force on any\nparticle passing through the throat is divergent.",

Despite notable success, existing approaches are limited by their\nreliance on sparse slide-level labels, which hinders the learning of\ndiscriminative repre-sentations from gigapixel WSIs. Recently, vision language\n(VL) models, which incorporate additional language supervision, have emerged as\na promising solu-tion. However, VL-based survival prediction remains largely\nunexplored due to two key challenges. First, current methods often rely on only\none simple lan-guage prompt and basic cosine similarity, which fails to learn\nfine-grained associ-ations between multi-faceted linguistic information and\nvisual features within WSI, resulting in inadequate vision-language alignment.\nSecond, these methods primarily exploit patch-level information, overlooking\nthe intrinsic hierarchy of WSIs and their interactions, causing ineffective\nmodeling of hierarchical interac-tions. To tackle these problems, we propose a\nnovel Hierarchical vision-Language collaboration (HiLa) framework for improved\nsurvival prediction. Specifically, HiLa employs pretrained feature extractors\nto generate hierarchical visual features from WSIs at both patch and region\nlevels. At each level, a series of language prompts describing various\nsurvival-related attributes are constructed and aligned with visual features\nvia Optimal Prompt Learning (OPL). This ap-proach enables the comprehensive\nlearning of discriminative visual features cor-responding to different\nsurvival-related attributes from prompts, thereby improv-ing vision-language\nalignment. Furthermore, we introduce two modules, i.e., Cross-Level Propagation\n(CLP) and Mutual Contrastive Learning (MCL) to maximize hierarchical\ncooperation by promoting interactions and consistency be-tween patch and region\nlevels. Experiments on three TCGA datasets demonstrate our SOTA performance.",

    "abstract": "We study equilibrium feedback strategies for a family of dynamic\nmean-variance problems with competition among a large group of agents. We\nassume that the time horizon is random and each agent's risk aversion depends\ndynamically on the current wealth. We consider both the finite population game\nand the corresponding mean-field one. Each agent can invest in a risk-free\nasset and a specific individual stock, which is correlated with other stocks by\na common noise. By applying stochastic control theory, we derive the extended\nHamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) system of equations for both $n$-agent and\nmean-field games. Under an exponentially distributed random horizon, we\nexplicitly obtain the equilibrium feedback strategies and the value functions\nin both cases. Our results show that the agent's equilibrium feedback strategy\ndepends not only on his/her current wealth but also on the wealth of other\ncompetitors. Moreover, when the risk aversion is state-independent and the\nrisk-free interest rate is set to zero, the equilibrium strategies degenerate\nto constants, which is identical to the unique equilibrium obtained in\n\\citet{lacker2019mean} with exponential risk preferences; when the competition\nparameter goes to zero and the risk aversion equals some specific value, the\nequilibrium strategies coincide with the ones derived in\n\\citet{landriault2018equilibrium}.",

These cycles\nconsist of active and inactive windows, with peak activity centered within the\nactive phase. For FRB 20180916B, studies have reported a frequency-dependent-or\n``chromatic''-behaviour, where the activity window starts earlier and becomes\nnarrower at higher frequencies. The activity across frequencies is typically\nmodeled with a power law. In this work, we develop a simple model that combines\nthe phase and frequency dependence of the activity windows of FRB 20121102A and\nFRB 20180916B. Our goal is to perform a chromaticity study for FRB 20121102A,\nincorporating model improvements to account for the cyclic nature of its\nactivity window, and to compare the chromatic behaviour between both periodic\nFRBs. We standardise the detections from the 425 observing epochs for FRB\n20121102A and the 214 epochs for FRB 20180916B to account for differences in\nradio telescope sensitivity. To the normalised detection rate phase\ndistribution, we fit a von Mises distribution and extract the peak activity\nphase and activity width. These quantities, as a function of frequency, are\nthen modelled as power-laws to construct the chromatic model. For both sources,\nthe activity window starts earlier at higher frequencies. However, FRB\n20121102A shows an activity window broadening at higher frequencies, while FRB\n20180916B broadens at lower frequencies. FRB 20121102A appears to remain active\nduring at least 80% of the cycle at C-band. The observed chromatic behaviour of\nFRB 20180916B is consistent with previous findings. For FRB 20121102A, a\nchromaticity in its activity window is also seen; however, the source appears\nto be active for longer at higher frequencies, opposite to the behaviour of FRB\n20180916B.",

Light emission as a function of position and\ntime is measured through red, green, blue, and broad-band filters. The\nspatially encoded and temporally sheared image normally used in CUP is now\nenhanced by the introduction of a constraint given by a spatially integrated\nand temporally sheared unencoded signal. The data yield insights into the\ntemperature, opacity, the plasma formation process, and heat flow within the\nplasma and to the surrounding ambient gas. Contours of constant emission\nindicate that plasmas formed from sufficiently dense gas contract rather than\nexpand despite having a temperature of a few eV. Plasmas formed from relatively\nlow pressure gases such as 7atm argon can radiate with emissivity near unity.\nModeling transport and opacity as arising from inverse Bremsstrahlung requires\na degree of ionization that strongly exceeds expectations based on Saha's\nequation even as customarily modified to include density and screening.\nAccording to this model, both electrons and ions are strongly coupled with a\nplasma coefficient >1. During the first few nanoseconds after formation,\nStefan-Boltzmann radiation and thermal conduction to ambient gas are too weak\nto explain the observed cooling rates, suggesting that transport within the\nplasma dominates its evolution. Yet, thermal conduction within the plasma\nitself is also small as indicated by the persistence of thermal inhomogeneities\nfor far longer timescales.

Most attempts at efficient exploration tackle this problem in a\nsetting where learning begins from scratch, without prior information available\nto bootstrap learning. However, such approaches fail to leverage expert\ndemonstrations and simulators that can reset to arbitrary states. These\naffordances are valuable resources that offer enormous potential to guide\nexploration and speed up learning. In this paper, we explore how a small number\nof expert demonstrations and a simulator allowing arbitrary resets can\naccelerate learning during online RL. We find that training with a suitable\nchoice of an auxiliary start state distribution that may differ from the true\nstart state distribution of the underlying Markov Decision Process can\nsignificantly improve sample efficiency.

In\nthis regime, the fluid domain decomposes into two regions: a thin-film region\ngoverned by one-dimensional mass and momentum equations, and a small tip region\nnear the free edge described by a self-similar Stokes flow. Asymptotic matching\nbetween these regions yields an effective boundary condition for the thin-film\nregion, representing a balance between viscous and capillary forces at the free\nedge. Surface tension drives the thin-film flow only through this boundary\ncondition, while the local momentum balance is dominated by viscous and\ninertial stresses. We show that the thin-film flow possesses a conserved\nquantity, reducing the equation of thickness to heat equation with\ntime-dependent boundary conditions. The reduced problem depends on a single\ndimensionless parameter $\\mathcal{L} = l_0 / (4 h_0 \\mathrm{Oh})$. Numerical\nsolutions of the reduced model agree well with previous studies and reveal that\nthe sheet undergoes distinct retraction regimes depending on $\\mathcal{L}$ and\na dimensionless time after rupture $T$. We derive asymptotic approximations for\nthe thickness profile, velocity profile, and retraction speed during the early\nand late stages of retraction. At early times, the retraction speed grows as\n$T^{1/2}$, while at late times it decays as $1/T^2$. An intermediate regime\narises for very long sheets ($\\mathcal{L} \\gg 1$). During this phase, the\nretraction speed approaches the Taylor-Culick value.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in diffusion models have enabled high-quality generation and\nmanipulation of images guided by texts, as well as concept learning from\nimages. However, naive applications of existing methods to editing tasks that\nrequire fine-grained control, e.g., face editing, often lead to suboptimal\nsolutions with identity information and high-frequency details lost during the\nediting process, or irrelevant image regions altered due to entangled concepts.\nIn this work, we propose S$^2$Edit, a novel method based on a pre-trained\ntext-to-image diffusion model that enables personalized editing with precise\nsemantic and spatial control. We first fine-tune our model to embed the\nidentity information into a learnable text token. During fine-tuning, we\ndisentangle the learned identity token from attributes to be edited by\nenforcing an orthogonality constraint in the textual feature space. To ensure\nthat the identity token only affects regions of interest, we apply object masks\nto guide the cross-attention maps. At inference time, our method performs\nlocalized editing while faithfully preserving the original identity with\nsemantically disentangled and spatially focused identity token learned.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of S$^2$Edit over\nstate-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively. Additionally,\nwe showcase several compositional image editing applications of S$^2$Edit such\nas makeup transfer.",

    "abstract": "Small area estimation models are typically based on the normality assumption\nof response variables. More recently, attention has been drawn to the\ntransformation of the original variables to justify the assumption of\nnormality. Variance stabilizing transformation of observation serves the dual\npurpose of reaching closer to normality, as well as known variance of the\ntransformed variables in contrast to the assumption of known variances of the\noriginal variables, the latter needed to avoid non-identifiability. However,\nthe existing literature on the topic ignores a certain bias introduced in the\nseemingly correct back transformation. The present paper rectifies this\ndeficiency by introducing asymptotically unbiased empirical Bayes (EB)\nestimators of small area means. Mean squared errors (MSEs) and estimated MSEs\nof such estimators are provided. The theoretical results were accompanied with\nsimulations and data analysis. A somewhat surprising phenomenon is a finding\nwhich connects one of our results to the natural exponential family quadratic\nvariance function (NEF-QVF) family of distributions introduced by Morris\n(1982,1983).",
