    "abstract": "Achieving controlled burning plasma in tokamaks requires precise regulation\nof external particle and energy sources to reach and maintain target core\ndensities and temperatures. This work presents an inverse modeling approach\nusing a multinodal plasma dynamics model based on neural ordinary differential\nequations (Neural ODEs). Given a desired time evolution of nodal quantities\nsuch as deuteron density or electron temperature, we compute the external\nsource profiles, such as neutral beam injection (NBI) power, that drive the\nplasma toward the specified behavior. The approach is implemented within the\nNeuralPlasmaODE framework, which models multi-region, multi-timescale transport\nand incorporates physical mechanisms including radiation, auxiliary heating,\nand internodal energy exchange. By formulating the control task as an\noptimization problem, we use automatic differentiation through the Neural ODE\nsolver to minimize the discrepancy between simulated and target trajectories.\nThis framework transforms the forward simulation tool into a control-oriented\nmodel and provides a practical method for computing external source profiles in\nboth current and future fusion devices.",

Traditional ME inversion methods, though widely used, are\ncomputationally intensive, sensitive to noise, and often struggle to accurately\ncapture complex profile asymmetries resulting from gradients in magnetic field\nstrength, orientation, and line-of-sight velocities. By embedding the ME\nradiative transfer equations directly into the neural network training as\nphysics-informed constraints, our MVPinn method robustly and efficiently\nretrieves magnetic field parameters, significantly outperforming traditional\ninversion methods in accuracy, noise resilience, and the ability to handle\nasymmetric and weak polarization signals. After training, MVPinn infers one\nmagnetogram in about 15 seconds, compared to tens of minutes required by\ntraditional ME inversion on high-resolution spectropolarimetric data.\nQuantitative comparisons demonstrate excellent agreement with well-established\nmagnetic field measurements from the SDO/HMI and Hinode/SOT-SP instruments,\nwith correlation coefficients of approximately 90%. In particular, MVPINN\naligns better with Hinode/SOT-SP data, indicating some saturation of HMI data\nat high magnetic strengths. We further analyze the physical significance of\nprofile asymmetries and the limitations inherent in the ME model assumption.\nOur results illustrate the potential of physics-informed machine learning\nmethods in high-spatial-temporal solar observations, preparing for more\nsophisticated, real-time magnetic field analysis essential for current and\nnext-generation solar telescopes and space weather monitoring.",

Adopting this perspective highlights the core challenge:\ndefining an optimal low-compute submanifold (or subset) and projecting onto it.\nWe argue that many successful model compression approaches can be understood as\nimplicitly approximating information divergences for this projection.

In such scenarios,\ntrainability of bottlenecked models turns out to be far more important for\nachieving high compression ratios with minimal performance degradation,\nnecessitating adoption of iterative methods. In this context, we prove\nconvergence of iterative singular value thresholding for training neural\nnetworks subject to a soft rank constraint.

The\nNEATEST framework has been used for automated testing in Scratch games,\nemploying neuroevolution-based test generation optimized for statement\ncoverage. However, statement coverage alone is often insufficient for fault\ndetection, as it does not guarantee execution of all logical branches. This\npaper introduces a branch coverage-based fitness function to enhance test\neffectiveness in automated game testing. We extend NEATEST by integrating a\nbranch fitness function that prioritizes control-dependent branches, guiding\nthe neuroevolution process to maximize branch exploration. To evaluate the\neffectiveness of this approach, empirical experiments were conducted on 25\nScratch games, comparing Neatest with Statement Coverage (NSC) against Neatest\nwith Branch Coverage (NBC). A mutation analysis was also performed to assess\nthe fault detection capabilities of both techniques. The results demonstrate\nthat NBC achieves higher branch coverage than NSC in 13 out of 25 games,\nparticularly in programs with complex conditional structures. Moreover, NBC\nachieves a lower false positive rate in mutation testing, making it a more\nreliable approach for identifying faulty behavior in game programs.

We define two equilibrium concepts:\nreasoning and behavioral equilibrium, which aligns an agent's internal\nprompt-based reasoning with observable behavior, and conjectural reasoning\nequilibrium, which accounts for epistemic uncertainty through parameterized\nmodels over an opponent's response. These layered constructs capture bounded\nrationality, asymmetric information, and meta-cognitive adaptation.

The data reveal a\nring-like morphology, with a radial peak located between those previously\nobserved at infrared wavelengths and longer millimetre observations.\nAdditionally, we detect a tentative outer shoulder in Band 9 that is not\nobserved at longer wavelengths. These findings suggest that small grains ($\\sim\n100 \\mu$m) traced by Band 9 may be escaping from the pressure bump both\nradially inwards and outwards, or may be tracing different disc layers than\nthose probed at longer wavelengths. A multi-wavelength analysis of the disc at\nmillimetre wavelengths and the best fit to the spectral energy distribution\nshows the presence of centimetre grains around the ring location, where the\ndust surface density also peaks, compatible with dust trap models. The grain\nsize in the disc cavity is not well constrained but is consistent with grains\nas small as 10 $\\mu$m, supporting the hypothesis that small dust grain filters\nthrough the cavity. We use dust evolution models to demonstrate that a\nturbulent viscosity of $\\alpha \\gtrsim 10^{-3}$ allows small grains to filter\nthrough the disc gap, while $\\alpha \\lesssim 5 \\times 10^{-3}$ is required to\nretain large grains in the pressure bump.

Tight bounds on the complex\neffective permittivity of such metamaterials are critical for predicting and\noptimizing their macroscopic electromagnetic response.

In the considered schemes, a non-negligible\nvariation of about $4\\%$ is found when the mass is varied within its current\nexperimental uncertainty. In the second part of the paper, we analyze the\nleading-order contributions to the same process within the Minimal\nSupersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). The spectrum of soft SUSY-breaking\nparameters and SUSY particle masses at the electroweak scale, which enter the\ncomputation of the one-loop amplitudes contributing to the decay width, is\nobtained by evolving the GUT-scale parameters of a Radiatively-Driven Natural\nSupersymmetry (RNS) model with non-universal Higgs boson masses. Variations of\nthe RNS parameters can enhance the average SM prediction by up to $\\sim20\\%$,\nreaching a value of $\\sim7.5~$keV, while still satisfying the Higgs boson mass\nconstraint. However, this comes at the cost of allowing a moderately large\nfine-tuning parameter, with values exceeding $100$, thereby placing the model\noutside its most natural parameter region.

Evaluation cases are presented to demonstrate the\nmethodology using five widely used satellite and reanalysis rainfall products\nand ground-based measurements from 12 stations in Africa and the Caribbean. The\ncase studies demonstrate how the methodology can be applied to examine multiple\naspects of the rainfall estimates.

In this paper, we approach the problem from two sides:\nTowards decidability, we give a procedure to compute the Zariski closure of\nsets of matrices given by one-counter languages (that is, languages accepted by\none-dimensional vector addition systems with states and zero tests), a proper\nsubclass of context-free languages. On the other side, we show that the problem\nbecomes undecidable for indexed languages, a natural extension of context-free\nlanguages corresponding to nested pushdown automata. One of our main technical\ntools is a novel adaptation of Simon's factorization forests to infinite\nmonoids of matrices.",

    "abstract": "Multiplex networks are increasingly common across diverse domains, motivating\nthe development of clustering methods that uncover patterns at multiple levels.\nExisting approaches typically focus on clustering either entire networks or\nnodes within a single network. We address the lack of a unified latent space\nframework for simultaneous network- and node-level clustering by proposing a\nlatent position co-clustering model (LaPCoM), based on a hierarchical\nmixture-of-mixtures formulation. LaPCoM enables co-clustering of networks and\ntheir constituent nodes, providing joint dimension reduction and two-level\ncluster detection. At the network level, it identifies global homogeneity in\ntopological patterns by grouping networks that share similar latent\nrepresentations. At the node level, it captures local connectivity and\ncommunity patterns. The model adopts a Bayesian nonparametric framework using a\nmixture of finite mixtures, which places priors on the number of clusters at\nboth levels and incorporates sparse priors to encourage parsimonious\nclustering. Inference is performed via Markov chain Monte Carlo with automatic\nselection of the number of clusters. LaPCoM accommodates both binary and\ncount-valued multiplex data. Simulation studies and comparisons with existing\nmethods demonstrate accurate recovery of latent structure and clusters.\nApplications to real-world social multiplexes reveal interpretable\nnetwork-level clusters aligned with context-specific patterns, and node-level\nclusters reflecting social patterns and roles.",

We assess the possible modulation of burst\nfrequency with the primary and secondary periods, and discuss the properties of\nthese bursts, favoring electron cyclotron maser over plasma emission as the\nlikely underlying mechanism. We compare DG CVn's dynamic spectrum to other\nyoung M dwarfs and find many similarities.

The displacement response, at points both within and\noutside the basin is represented alternatively in integral (for basins of\ngeneral shape) and partial wave (for basins of semi-circular shape) forms, the\nintegral representation leading to an expression of a sort of conservation of\nenergy relation, and an explanation of how the energetic gain provided by the\nincident wave, is divided essentially into two sources of loss: radiation\ndamping (taking place in the bedrock) and volumic material damping (taking\nplace within the basin), whereas the partial wave representation enables a\ndetailed theoretical demonstration of the resonant nature of the response,\nmarked by amplification and concentration of the displacement field essentially\nwithin the basin at certain (eigen-)frequencies and very little, or no\namplification and concentration, at other frequencies. These phenomena carry\nover to the volumic material damping and radiation damping loss functions (of\nfrequency), with the equivalent of resonant displacement response residing in\npeaks of the volumic material damping loss function and troughs of the\nradiation damping loss function. Maps, for the semi-circular basin, are\ncomputed herein of the displacement field both at resonant and non-resonant\nfrequencies which strongly evoke those (of numerical nature resulting from the\nboundary element scheme) appearing in two publications by other authors for\nbasins of more realistic shape, so as to suggest that the results in the\npresent study are applicable, for a large part, to basins of general shape.",

    "abstract": "The retirement funding problem addresses the question of how to manage a\nretiree's savings to provide her with a constant post-tax inflation adjusted\nconsumption throughout her lifetime. This consists of choosing withdrawals and\ntransfers from and between several accounts with different tax treatments,\ntaking into account basic rules such as required minimum distributions and\nlimits on Roth conversions, additional income, liabilities, taxes, and the\nbequest when the retiree dies. We develop a retirement funding policy in two\nsteps. In the first step, we consider a simplified planning problem in which\nvarious future quantities, such as the retiree's remaining lifetime, future\ninvestment returns, and future inflation, are known. Using a simplified model\nof taxes, we pose this planning problem as a convex optimization problem, where\nwe maximize the bequest subject to providing a constant inflation adjusted\nconsumption target. Since this problem is convex, it can be solved quickly and\nreliably. We leverage this planning method to form a retirement funding policy\nthat determines the actions to take each year, based on information known at\nthat time. Each year the retiree forms a new plan for the future years, using\nthe current account values and life expectancy, and optionally, updated\ninformation such as changes in tax rates or rules. The retiree then carries out\nthe actions from the first year of the current plan. This update-plan-act cycle\nis repeated each year, a general policy called model predictive control (MPC).\nThe MPC retirement policy reacts to the effects of uncertain investment returns\nand inflation, changes in the retiree's expected lifetime or external income\nand liabilities, and changes in tax rules and rates. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the MPC retirement policy using Monte Carlo simulation.",

    "abstract": "Efficient cooling is vital for the performance and reliability of modern\nsystems such as electronics, nuclear reactors, and industrial equipment. Jet\nimpingement cooling is widely used for its high local heat transfer rates.\nAccurate estimation of convective heat transfer coefficient (CHTC) is essential\nfor design, simulation, and control of thermal systems. However, estimating\nspatially varying CHTCs from limited and noisy temperature data poses a\nchallenging inverse problem. This study presents a physics-informed neural\nnetwork (PINN) framework to estimate both averaged and spatially varying CHTCs\nat the fluid-solid interface in a jet impingement setup at Reynolds number\n5000. The model uses sparse and noisy temperature data from within the solid\nand embeds the transient heat conduction equation along with boundary and\ninitial conditions into its loss function. This enables inference of unknown\nboundary parameters without explicit modeling of the fluid domain. Validation\nis performed using synthetic temperature data from high-fidelity conjugate heat\ntransfer (CHT) simulations. The framework is tested under various additive\nGaussian noise levels (up to 30 percent) and sampling rates 0.25 to 4.0 per\nsecond. For noise levels up to 10% and sampling rates of 0.5 per second or\nhigher, estimated CHTCs match CHT-derived benchmarks with relative errors below\n8 percent. Even under high-noise scenarios, the framework maintains predictive\naccuracy when time resolution is sufficient. These results highlight the\nmethod's robustness to noise and sparse data, offering a scalable alternative\nto traditional inverse methods, experimental measurements, or full CHT modeling\nfor estimating boundary thermal parameters in real-world cooling applications.",

A minimal realization of\nthis scenario is described by a Bianchi I geometry, where each spatial\ndirection evolves at a different rate, and the degree of anisotropy is\nquantified by the shear parameter $\\Sigma$. In this work, we constrain the\npresent-day value of the shear, $\\Sigma_0$, by confronting theoretical\npredictions with recent cosmological data. We implement various anisotropic\nmodels within the Boltzmann code \\texttt{CLASS} and explore their parameter\nspace using the sampler \\texttt{MontePython}. Although our results show that\n$\\Sigma_0$ is model-dependent, notably, in one specific scenario considering a\nhomogeneous scalar field coupled to a 2-form field, $\\Sigma_0 = 0$ is excluded\nat the $2\\sigma$ confidence level, with mean value around $|\\Sigma_0| \\sim\n10^{-4}$ while remaining consistent with observations. These findings challenge\nthe conventional assumption that cosmic shear is negligible in the present\nuniverse. Moreover, the anisotropic expansion in this model is driven by a\nsteep scalar field potential, a feature often found in supergravity-inspired\nscenarios. While anisotropic models offer interesting alternatives and could\nhelp explain some cosmological anomalies, they generally introduce additional\nparameters, making the standard $\\Lambda$CDM model statistically favored in\nmost cases.

We propose\nan integrated approach that combines advanced statistical methodologies with\nmachine learning models to enhance the identification and exploitation of\npredictive relationships between equities. Methods: We employed a Gaussian\nMixture Model (GMM) to cluster nine prominent stocks based on their mid-range\nhistorical volatility profiles over a three-year period. From the resulting\nclusters, we constructed a multi-stage causal inference pipeline, incorporating\nthe Granger Causality Test (GCT), a customised Peter-Clark Momentary\nConditional Independence (PCMCI) test, and Effective Transfer Entropy (ETE) to\nidentify robust, predictive linkages. Subsequently, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)\nand a K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) classifier were utilised to determine the\noptimal time lag for trade execution. The resulting strategy was rigorously\nbacktested. Results: The proposed volatility-based trading strategy, tested\nfrom 8 June 2023 to 12 August 2023, demonstrated substantial efficacy. The\nportfolio yielded a total return of 15.38%, significantly outperforming the\n10.39% return of a comparative Buy-and-Hold strategy. Key performance metrics,\nincluding a Sharpe Ratio up to 2.17 and a win rate up to 100% for certain\npairs, confirmed the strategy's viability. Conclusion: This research\ncontributes a systematic and robust methodology for identifying profitable\ntrading opportunities derived from volatility-based causal relationships. The\nfindings have significant implications for both academic research in financial\nmodelling and the practical application of algorithmic trading, offering a\nstructured approach to developing resilient, data-driven strategies.",

    "abstract": "Fixed a polarised variety $X$, we can ask if it admits Ulrich bundles and, in\ncase, what is their minimal possible rank. In this thesis, after recalling\ngeneral properties of Ulrich sheaves, we show that any finite covering of\n$\\mathbb{P}^n$ that embeds as a divisor in a weighted projective space with\nweights $(1^{n+1},m)$ admits Ulrich sheaves, by using matrix factorisations.\nAmong these varieties, we focus on double coverings of with $n\\ge3$. Through\nHartshorne--Serre correspondence, which we review along the way, we prove that\nthe general such $X$ admits a rank $2$ Ulrich sheaf if and only if $n=3$ and\n$m=2,3,4$, and characterise the zero loci of their sections. Moreover, we\nconstruct generically smooth components of the expected dimension of their\nmoduli spaces, analyse the action of the natural involution on them and the\nrestriction of those bundles to low degree hypersurfaces. For $m=2,3$, we\nverify the existence of slope-stable Ulrich bundles of all the possible ranks.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous systems across diverse domains have underscored the need for\ndrift-resilient state estimation. Although satellite-based positioning and\ncameras are widely used, they often suffer from limited availability in many\nenvironments. As a result, positioning must rely solely on inertial sensors,\nleading to rapid accuracy degradation over time due to sensor biases and noise.\nTo counteract this, alternative update sources-referred to as information\naiding-serve as anchors of certainty. Among these, the zero-velocity update\n(ZUPT) is particularly effective in providing accurate corrections during\nstationary intervals, though it is restricted to surface-bound platforms. This\nwork introduces a controlled ZUPT (C-ZUPT) approach for aerial navigation and\ncontrol, independent of surface contact. By defining an uncertainty threshold,\nC-ZUPT identifies quasi-static equilibria to deliver precise velocity updates\nto the estimation filter. Extensive validation confirms that these\nopportunistic, high-quality updates significantly reduce inertial drift and\ncontrol effort. As a result, C-ZUPT mitigates filter divergence and enhances\nnavigation stability, enabling more energy-efficient hovering and substantially\nextending sustained flight-key advantages for resource-constrained aerial\nsystems.",

The planets exhibit a diverse range of sizes (0.8-1.6 R$_{\\oplus}$),\nmasses (0.5-3 M$_{\\oplus}$), and likely compositions (Earth-like to possibly\nwater-rich), prompting atmospheric characterization studies with HST and JWST.\nHere, we analyze 16 new TESS sectors and improve radial velocity (RV) precision\nof archival ESPRESSO and HARPS data using a line-by-line framework, enabling\nstellar activity detrending via a novel differential temperature indicator.

Thus,\nin this study, we curated the Bilingual English-to-Yoruba Speech-to-Speech\nTranslation Corpus Version 1 (BENYO-S2ST-Corpus-1). The corpus is based on a\nhybrid architecture we developed for large-scale direct S2ST corpus creation at\nreduced cost. To achieve this, we leveraged non speech-to-speech Standard\nYoruba (SY) real-time audios and transcripts in the YORULECT Corpus as well as\nthe corresponding Standard English (SE) transcripts. YORULECT Corpus is small\nscale(1,504) samples, and it does not have paired English audios. Therefore, we\ngenerated the SE audios using pre-trained AI models (i.e. Facebook MMS). We\nalso developed an audio augmentation algorithm named AcoustAug based on three\nlatent acoustic features to generate augmented audios from the raw audios of\nthe two languages. BENYO-S2ST-Corpus-1 has 12,032 audio samples per language,\nwhich gives a total of 24,064 sample size. The total audio duration for the two\nlanguages is 41.20 hours. This size is quite significant. Beyond building S2ST\nmodels, BENYO-S2ST-Corpus-1 can be used to build pretrained models or improve\nexisting ones. The created corpus and Coqui framework were used to build a\npretrained Yoruba TTS model (named YoruTTS-1.5) as a proof of concept. The\nYoruTTS-1.5 gave a F0 RMSE value of 63.54 after 1,000 epochs, which indicates\nmoderate fundamental pitch similarity with the reference real-time audio.\nUltimately, the corpus architecture in this study can be leveraged by\nresearchers and developers to curate datasets for multilingual\nhigh-resource-to-low-resource African languages. This will bridge the huge\ndigital divides in translations among high and low-resource language pairs.\nBENYO-S2ST-Corpus-1 and YoruTTS-1.5 are publicly available at\n(https://bit.ly/40bGMwi).",

These include heavy\ncomputational burdens for mapping, sensor occlusion failures for UAVs, and\ntraversal challenges on irregular terrain for UGVs, all compounded by a lack of\nperception-aware strategies. To address these challenges, we introduce Random\nMapping and Random Projection (RMRP). This method constructs a lightweight\nlinear parametric map by first mapping data to a high-dimensional space,\nfollowed by a sparse random projection for dimensionality reduction. Our novel\nResidual Energy Preservation Theorem provides theoretical guarantees for this\nprocess, ensuring critical geometric properties are preserved. Based on this\nmap, we propose the RPATR (Robust Perception-Aware Trajectory Planner)\nframework. For UAVs, our method unifies grid and Euclidean Signed Distance\nField (ESDF) maps. The front-end uses an analytical occupancy gradient to\nrefine initial paths for safety and smoothness, while the back-end uses a\nclosed-form ESDF for trajectory optimization. Leveraging the trained RMRP\nmodel's generalization, the planner predicts unobserved areas for proactive\nnavigation. For UGVs, the model characterizes terrain and provides closed-form\ngradients, enabling online planning to circumvent large holes. Validated in\ndiverse scenarios, our framework demonstrates superior mapping performance in\ntime, memory, and accuracy, and enables computationally efficient, safe\nnavigation for high-speed UAVs and UGVs.

    "abstract": "While 3D Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable\nscene understanding capabilities, their practical deployment faces critical\nchallenges due to computational inefficiency. The key bottleneck stems from\nprocessing excessive object-centric visual tokens required for comprehensive 3D\nscene representation. Although visual token pruning has shown promise in\naccelerating 2D MLLMs, its applicability to 3D domains remains largely\nunexplored due to fundamental disparities in token structures. In this paper,\nwe reveal two critical insights: (1) Significant redundancy exists in\nobject-level 3D token representations, analogous to patch-level redundancy in\n2D systems; (2) Global attention patterns exhibit strong predictive power for\nidentifying non-essential tokens in 3D contexts. Building on these\nobservations, we propose Fast3D, a plug-and-play visual token pruning framework\nfor 3D MLLMs featuring two technical innovations: (1) Global Attention\nPrediction (GAP), where a lightweight neural network learns to predict the\nglobal attention distributions of the target model, enabling efficient token\nimportance estimation for precise pruning guidance; (2) Sample-Adaptive visual\ntoken Pruning (SAP), which introduces dynamic token budgets through\nattention-based complexity assessment, automatically adjusting layer-wise\npruning ratios based on input characteristics. Both of these two techniques\noperate without modifying the parameters of the target model.

    "abstract": "Two-tower neural networks are a popular architecture for the retrieval stage\nin recommender systems. These models are typically trained with a softmax loss\nover the item catalog. However, in web-scale settings, the item catalog is\noften prohibitively large, making full softmax infeasible. A common solution is\nsampled softmax, which approximates the full softmax using a small number of\nsampled negatives.\n  One practical and widely adopted approach is to use in-batch negatives, where\nnegatives are drawn from items in the current mini-batch. However, this\nintroduces a bias: items that appear more frequently in the batch (i.e.,\npopular items) are penalized more heavily.\n  To mitigate this issue, a popular industry technique known as logQ correction\nadjusts the logits during training by subtracting the log-probability of an\nitem appearing in the batch. This correction is derived by analyzing the bias\nin the gradient and applying importance sampling, effectively twice, using the\nin-batch distribution as a proposal distribution. While this approach improves\nmodel quality, it does not fully eliminate the bias.\n  In this work, we revisit the derivation of logQ correction and show that it\noverlooks a subtle but important detail: the positive item in the denominator\nis not Monte Carlo-sampled - it is always present with probability 1. We\npropose a refined correction formula that accounts for this. Notably, our loss\nintroduces an interpretable sample weight that reflects the model's uncertainty\n- the probability of misclassification under the current parameters. We\nevaluate our method on both public and proprietary datasets, demonstrating\nconsistent improvements over the standard logQ correction.",

    "abstract": "Topological data analysis (TDA) is a rapidly evolving field in applied\nmathematics and data science that leverages tools from topology to uncover\nrobust, shape-driven insights in complex datasets. The main workhorse is\npersistent homology, a technique rooted in algebraic topology. Paired with\ntopological deep learning (TDL) or topological machine learning, persistent\nhomology has achieved tremendous success in a wide variety of applications in\nscience, engineering, medicine, and industry. However, persistent homology has\nmany limitations due to its high-level abstraction, insensitivity to\nnon-topological changes, and reliance on point cloud data. This paper presents\na comprehensive review of TDA and TDL beyond persistent homology. It analyzes\nhow persistent topological Laplacians and Dirac operators provide spectral\nrepresentations to capture both topological invariants and homotopic evolution.\nOther formulations are presented in terms of sheaf theory, Mayer topology, and\ninteraction topology. For data on differentiable manifolds, techniques rooted\nin differential topology, such as persistent de Rham cohomology, persistent\nHodge Laplacian, and Hodge decomposition, are reviewed. For one-dimensional\n(1D) curves embedded in 3-space, approaches from geometric topology are\ndiscussed, including multiscale Gauss-link integrals, persistent Jones\npolynomials, and persistent Khovanov homology. This paper further discusses the\nappropriate selection of topological tools for different input data, such as\npoint clouds, sequential data, data on manifolds, curves embedded in 3-space,\nand data with additional non-geometric information. A review is also given of\nvarious topological representations, software packages, and machine learning\nvectorizations. Finally, this review ends with concluding remarks.",

In the analysis of logically constrained term rewrite systems\n(LCTRSs), rewriting constrained terms plays a crucial role. However, this\ncombines rewrite rule applications and equivalence transformations in a closely\nintertwined way. This intertwining makes it difficult to establish useful\ntheoretical properties for this kind of rewriting and causes problems in\nimplementations -- namely, that impractically large search spaces are often\nrequired. To address this issue, we propose in this paper a novel notion of\nmost general constrained rewriting, which operates on existentially constrained\nterms, a concept recently introduced by the authors. We define a class of\nleft-linear, left-value-free LCTRSs that are general enough to simulate all\nleft-linear LCTRSs and exhibit the desired key property: most general\nconstrained rewriting commutes with equivalence. This property ensures that\nequivalence transformations can be deferred until after the application of\nrewrite rules, which helps mitigate the issue of large search spaces in\nimplementations. In addition to that, we show that the original rewriting\nformalism on constrained terms can be embedded into our new rewriting formalism\non existentially constrained terms. Thus, our results are expected to have\nsignificant implications for achieving correct and efficient implementations in\ntools operating on LCTRSs.",

We are able to circumvent this problem for some important ecological\nmodels by noticing that the per-capita growth rates at stationarity are zero,\nsomething which can sometimes yield information about the invariant probability\nmeasure. For more complicated models we use a recent result by Cuello to\nexplore how small noise influences the population size. We are able to show\nthat environmental fluctuations can decrease, increase, or leave unchanged the\nexpected population size. The results change according to the dynamical model\nand, within a fixed model, also according to which parameters (growth rate,\ncarrying capacity, etc) are affected by environmental fluctuations. Moreover,\nwe show that not only do things change if we introduce noise differently in a\nmodel, but it also matters what one takes as the deterministic `no-noise'\nbaseline for comparison.",

Tractometry is an\nadvanced tractography analysis technique for along-tract profiling to\ninvestigate the morphology and microstructural properties along the fiber\ntracts. Tractometry has become an essential tool for studying local along-tract\ndifferences between different populations (e.g., health vs disease). In this\nstudy, we propose a novel atlas-guided fine-scale tractometry method, namely\nAGFS-Tractometry, that leverages tract spatial information and permutation\ntesting to enhance the along-tract statistical analysis between populations.\nThere are two major contributions in AGFS-Tractometry. First, we create a novel\natlas-guided tract profiling template that enables consistent, fine-scale,\nalong-tract parcellation of subject-specific fiber tracts. Second, we propose a\nnovel nonparametric permutation testing group comparison method to enable\nsimultaneous analysis across all along-tract parcels while correcting for\nmultiple comparisons. We perform experimental evaluations on synthetic datasets\nwith known group differences and in vivo real data. We compare AGFS-Tractometry\nwith two state-of-the-art tractometry methods, including Automated Fiber-tract\nQuantification (AFQ) and BUndle ANalytics (BUAN). Our results show that the\nproposed AGFS-Tractometry obtains enhanced sensitivity and specificity in\ndetecting local WM differences.

Fokas\nachieved progress in 2006 by constructing integrable nonlinear equations in 4+2\ndimensions, but the reduction to 3+1 dimensions remained open until 2022 when\nhe introduced a suitable nonlinear Fourier transform to achieve this reduction\nfor the Kadomtsev-Petiashvili (KP) equation. Here, the integrable\ngeneralization of the modified KP (mKP) equation has been presented which has\nthe novelty that it involves complex time and preserves Laplace's equation. The\n(3+1)-dimensional mKP equation is obtained by imposing the requirement of real\ntime. Then, the spectral analysis of the eigenvalue equation is given and the\nsolution of the $\\bar{\\partial}$-problem is demonstrated based on Cauchy-Green\nformula. Finally, a novel $\\bar{\\partial}$-formalism for the initial value\nproblem of the (3+1)-dimensional mKP equation is worked out.",

There is a hope that the\nsignal of these biotic interactions can be observed and retrieved by\ninvestigating the spatial associations between species while accounting for the\ndirect effects of the environment. By definition, biotic interactions can be\nboth symmetric and asymmetric. Yet, most models that attempt to retrieve\nspecies associations from co-occurrence or co-abundance data internally assume\nsymmetric relationships between species. Here, we propose and validate a\nmachine-learning framework able to retrieve bidirectional associations by\nanalyzing species community and environmental data.\n  Our framework (1) models pairwise species associations as directed influences\nfrom a source to a target species, parameterized with two species-specific\nlatent embeddings: the effect of the source species on the community, and the\nresponse of the target species to the community; and (2) jointly fits these\nassociations within a multi-species conditional generative model with different\nmodes of interactions between environmental drivers and biotic associations.\nUsing both simulated and empirical data, we demonstrate the ability of our\nframework to recover known asymmetric and symmetric associations and highlight\nthe properties of the learned association networks. By comparing our approach\nto other existing models such as joint species distribution models and\nprobabilistic graphical models, we show its superior capacity at retrieving\nsymmetric and asymmetric interactions.

Since model responses are generated\nat varying timestamps, we further propose PAUC, the first metric that accounts\nfor the temporal dynamics of model responses.

Through extensive\nbenchmarking of various baseline systems on ProactiveVideoQA and a user study\nof human preferences, we show that PAUC is in better agreement with human\npreferences than traditional evaluation metrics, which typically only consider\nthe textual content of responses.

In this paper, we introduce a novel learning method, termed\ndeep angular A* (DAA*), by incorporating the proposed path angular freedom\n(PAF) into A* to improve path similarity through adaptive path smoothness. The\nPAF aims to explore the effect of move angles on path node expansion by finding\nthe trade-off between their minimum and maximum values, allowing for high\nadaptiveness for imitation learning. DAA* improves path optimality by closely\naligning with the reference path through joint optimization of path shortening\nand smoothing, which correspond to heuristic distance and PAF, respectively.\nThroughout comprehensive evaluations on 7 datasets, including 4 maze datasets,\n2 video-game datasets, and a real-world drone-view dataset containing 2\nscenarios, we demonstrate remarkable improvements of our DAA* over neural A* in\npath similarity between the predicted and reference paths with a shorter path\nlength when the shortest path is plausible, improving by 9.0% SPR, 6.9% ASIM,\nand 3.9% PSIM. Furthermore, when jointly learning pathfinding with both path\nloss and path probability map loss, DAA* significantly outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art TransPath by 6.3% SPR, 6.0% PSIM, and 3.7% ASIM.

We perform one-dimensional general relativistic\nmagnetohydrodynamic simulations of the supernova fallback onto a magnetized\nproto-neutron star, while considering neutrino cooling. In our simulations, the\ninfalling material compresses the magnetic field and drives a strong shock. The\nshock initially expands outward, but eventually stalls and recedes as neutrino\ncooling becomes significant. After the shock stalls, the gas density above the\nmagnetosphere increases rapidly, potentially leading to the formation of a new\ncrust. To understand the shock dynamics, we develop semi-analytic models that\ndescribe the resulting magnetospheric and shock radii when the shock stalls. By\ncomparing the fallback time scale with the shock stalling time scale,\ncorresponding to the waiting time for the new crust formation, we derive a\nnecessary condition for the submergence of the PNS magnetic field.

However, the precise physical mechanisms\nunderlying this correlation remain an active area of research. Although\nmagnetars, highly magnetized neutron stars, have been proposed as central\nengines powering GRB afterglows, traditional dipole spin-down radiation models\nfail to account for the full diversity of observed behaviors. This limitation\nnecessitates a more comprehensive framework. We propose that multipolar\nmagnetic field emissions from magnetars offer a plausible explanation for the\nDainotti relation. Unlike simple dipole fields, higher-order multipolar\nconfigurations enable more complex energy dissipation processes. The\ncoexistence of multiple components can plausibly explain the range of afterglow\ndecay indices found from a sample of 238 GRBs with plateau features from the\nSwift-XRT database up to the end of December 2024, the majority of which\ndeviate from the dipolar prediction of $\\alpha = -2$, and more crucially, the\nspin-down physics yields a link between $L_X$ and $T_a^*$ in a way that\npreserves the Dainotti correlation with a slope of $b = - 1$, independent of\nthe specific multipole order. Moreover, we find that the inclusion of higher\norder multipoles can explain the range of plateau energies found in the\nDainotti relations.

We\nintroduce two novel approaches for incorporating QKD into Internet Key Exchange\nversion 2 (IKEv2) with support for both ETSI GS QKD 004 stateful and ETSI GS\nQKD 014 stateless API specifications: (1) a pure QKD approach that replaces\ncomputational key derivation with identifier-based quantum key coordination,\nand (2) a unified QKD-KEM abstraction that enables parallel composition of\nquantum and post-quantum cryptographic methods within existing protocol\nframeworks. Our key insight is that parallel hybrid approaches eliminate the\nmultiplicative latency penalties inherent in sequential methods mandated by RFC\n9370, achieving significant performance improvements under realistic network\nconditions. Performance evaluation using a Docker-based testing framework with\nIDQuantique QKD hardware demonstrates that the parallel hybrid approach\nsignificantly outperforms sequential methods under network latency conditions,\nwhile pure QKD achieves minimal bandwidth overhead through identifier-based key\ncoordination.

To address this issue,\nwe propose a novel framework for BMD that leverages a deep generative model to\nencode the kernel prior and induce a better initialization for the blur kernel.\nSpecifically, we pre-train a kernel generator based on a generative adversarial\nnetwork (GAN) to aptly characterize the kernel's prior distribution, as well as\na kernel initializer to provide a well-informed and high-quality starting point\nfor kernel estimation. By combining these two components, we constrain the BMD\nsolution within a compact latent kernel manifold, thus alleviating the\naforementioned sensitivity for kernel initialization. Notably, the kernel\ngenerator and initializer are designed to be easily integrated with existing\nBMD methods in a plug-and-play manner, enhancing their overall performance.\nFurthermore, we extend our approach to tackle blind non-uniform motion\ndeblurring without the need for additional priors, achieving state-of-the-art\nperformance on challenging benchmark datasets.

However, the screening process\nremains computationally cumbersome due to the need of solving numerous linear\nprogramming (LP) problems. To reduce the number of LPs to solve, we introduce a\nnovel perspective on such classic LP-based screening. Our key insights lie in\nthe principle that redundant constraints will be satisfied by all vertices of\nthe screened feasible region. Using the UC decision variables' bounds tightened\nby solving much fewer LPs, we build an outer approximation for the UC feasible\nregion as the screened region. A matrix operation is then designed and applied\nto the outer approximation's vertices to identify all redundant constraints\non-the-fly. Adjustments for the outer approximation are further explored to\nimprove screening efficiency by considering the load operating range and\ncutting planes derived from UC cost and discrete unit status prediction.\nExtensive simulations are performed on a set of testbeds up to 2,383 buses to\nsubstantiate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.

This work explores the prospect of utilizing three degenerate\nmodes for scanning the three dimensions of space in order to mitigate the low\nform factor expected in the detection of the dark photon due to their unknown\npolarization. The employment of an haloscope with three orthogonal and\ndegenerate modes in conjunction with the coherent sum of signals is\ndemonstrated in this work in order to enhance the dark photon form factor up to\nthe axion form factor, and to determine the direction of the dark photon\npolarization vector.

    "abstract": "Superposition is an essential feature of quantum mechanics. From the\nSchrodinger's cat to quantum algorithms such as Deutsch-Jorsza algorithm,\nquantum superposition plays an important role. It is one fundamental and\ncrucial question how to quantify superposition. Until now, the framework of\ncoherence has been well established as one typical instance of quantum resource\ntheories. And the concept of coherence has been generalized into linearly\nindependent basis, projective measurements and POVMs. In this work, we will\nfocus on coherence measures for projective measurements or orthogonal\nsubspaces. One new condition, order-preserving condition, is proposed for such\nmeasures. This condition is rooted in the mathematical structure of Hilbert\nspaces' orthogonal decomposition. And by generalizing the 1/2-affinity of\ncoherence into subspace cases, we verify that this generalized coherence\nmeasure satisfies the order-preserving condition. And it also satisfies other\nreasonable conditions to be a good coherence measure. As the partial order\nrelationship exists for not only projective measurements, but also POVMs, it's\nnatural to study the order-preserving condition in POVM cases, which will be\nthe last part of this work.",

Unlike prior work, this paper explores the\npotential of bull and bear regimes in investor-driven market dynamics. Through\nempirical analysis on real-world financial datasets, we uncover a dynamic\nrelationship between bias variation and behavioral adaptation, which enhances\ntrend prediction under evolving market conditions. To model this mechanism, we\npropose the Bias to Behavior from Bull-Bear Dynamics model (B4), a unified\nframework that jointly embeds temporal price sequences and external contextual\nsignals into a shared latent space where opposing bull and bear forces\nnaturally emerge, forming the foundation for bias representation. Within this\nspace, an inertial pairing module pairs temporally adjacent samples to preserve\nmomentum, while the dual competition mechanism contrasts bullish and bearish\nembeddings to capture behavioral divergence. Together, these components allow\nB4 to model bias-driven asymmetry, behavioral inertia, and market\nheterogeneity.

To solve the Hubble\nconstant ($H_0$) tension, usually an unknown mechanism is considered that\nshifts the sound horizon at the decoupling era. On the other hand, dynamical\ndark energy models are also considered to resolve the problems of the\ncosmological constant, and the additional degrees of freedom require initial\nconditions for a solution. In this article we have considered a coupled\nquintessence dark energy model with a special focus on its early-time\nbehaviour. In our solution the initial conditions are naturally decided by\nsetting the value of the sound horizon at the recombination time, $\\theta^*$.\nWe find that during this process, $H_0$ could be derived and its value rises\nwith the coupling strength of the interaction. We also performed the background\nand cosmic microwave background power spectrum analysis, and find that the\nexistence of the interaction term affects the energy density during a narrow\ntime interval range and shifts the early cosmic microwave background spectrum.\nWe also constrained the parameter space of the underlying scenario using the\nmarkov chain monte carlo analysis.

    "abstract": "Image-text matching is crucial for bridging the semantic gap between computer\nvision and natural language processing. However, existing methods still face\nchallenges in handling high-order associations and semantic ambiguities among\nsimilar instances. These ambiguities arise from subtle differences between soft\npositive samples (semantically similar but incorrectly labeled) and soft\nnegative samples (locally matched but globally inconsistent), creating matching\nuncertainties. Furthermore, current methods fail to fully utilize the\nneighborhood relationships among semantically similar instances within training\nbatches, limiting the model's ability to learn high-order shared knowledge.\nThis paper proposes the Ambiguity-Aware and High-order Relation learning\nframework (AAHR) to address these issues. AAHR constructs a unified\nrepresentation space through dynamic clustering prototype contrastive learning,\neffectively mitigating the soft positive sample problem. The framework\nintroduces global and local feature extraction mechanisms and an adaptive\naggregation network, significantly enhancing full-grained semantic\nunderstanding capabilities. Additionally, AAHR employs intra-modal and\ninter-modal correlation matrices to investigate neighborhood relationships\namong sample instances thoroughly. It incorporates GNN to enhance semantic\ninteractions between instances. Furthermore, AAHR integrates momentum\ncontrastive learning to expand the negative sample set. These combined\nstrategies significantly improve the model's ability to discriminate between\nfeatures. Experimental results demonstrate that AAHR outperforms existing\nstate-of-the-art methods on Flickr30K, MSCOCO, and ECCV Caption datasets,\nconsiderably improving the accuracy and efficiency of image-text matching.

The positioning\nof both pairs of lobes with the central core supports its classification as a\nDDRG. Spectral age estimates for the inner and outer lobes indicate two\ndistinct episodes of active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity interspaced by a\nshort quiescent phase.

With a projected linear size of 1.08 Mpc,\nJ2349-0003 is classified as a giant radio galaxy (GRG), although its moderate\nradio power (~10^24 W/Hz) suggests a sparse surrounding environment.

Recently, topological defects have been identified in the\ndisplacement field and in the eigenvectors of amorphous solids.

    "abstract": "We consider algorithmic determination of the $n$-dimensional\nSherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) spin glass model ground state free energy. It\ncorresponds to a binary maximization of an indefinite quadratic form and under\nthe \\emph{worst case} principles of the classical NP complexity theory it is\nhard to approximate within a $\\log(n)^{const.}$ factor. On the other hand, the\nSK's random nature allows (polynomial) spectral methods to \\emph{typically}\napproach the optimum within a constant factor. Naturally one is left with the\nfundamental question: can the residual (constant) \\emph{computational gap} be\nerased?\n  Following the success of \\emph{Controlled Loosening-up} (CLuP) algorithms in\nplanted models, we here devise a simple practical CLuP-SK algorithmic procedure\nfor (non-planted) SK models. To analyze the \\emph{typical} success of the\nalgorithm we associate to it (random) CLuP-SK models. Further connecting to\nrecent random processes studies [94,97], we characterize the models and CLuP-SK\nalgorithm via fully lifted random duality theory (fl RDT) [98]. Moreover,\nrunning the algorithm we demonstrate that its performance is in an excellent\nagrement with theoretical predictions. In particular, already for $n$ on the\norder of a few thousands CLuP-SK achieves $\\sim 0.76$ ground state free energy\nand remarkably closely approaches theoretical $n\\rightarrow\\infty$ limit\n$\\approx 0.763$. For all practical purposes, this renders computing SK model's\nnear ground state free energy as a \\emph{typically} easy problem.",

We compute characteristic observables\nincluding the shadow radius, Lyapunov exponent, innermost stable circular orbit\n(ISCO) frequency, and binding energy.

    "abstract": "Intelligent fault diagnosis (IFD) plays a crucial role in ensuring the safe\noperation of industrial machinery and improving production efficiency. However,\ntraditional supervised deep learning methods require a large amount of training\ndata and labels, which are often located in different clients. Additionally,\nthe cost of data labeling is high, making labels difficult to acquire.\nMeanwhile, differences in data distribution among clients may also hinder the\nmodel's performance. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a\nsemi-supervised federated learning framework, SSFL-DCSL, which integrates dual\ncontrastive loss and soft labeling to address data and label scarcity for\ndistributed clients with few labeled samples while safeguarding user privacy.\nIt enables representation learning using unlabeled data on the client side and\nfacilitates joint learning among clients through prototypes, thereby achieving\nmutual knowledge sharing and preventing local model divergence. Specifically,\nfirst, a sample weighting function based on the Laplace distribution is\ndesigned to alleviate bias caused by low confidence in pseudo labels during the\nsemi-supervised training process. Second, a dual contrastive loss is introduced\nto mitigate model divergence caused by different data distributions, comprising\nlocal contrastive loss and global contrastive loss. Third, local prototypes are\naggregated on the server with weighted averaging and updated with momentum to\nshare knowledge among clients. To evaluate the proposed SSFL-DCSL framework,\nexperiments are conducted on two publicly available datasets and a dataset\ncollected on motors from the factory. In the most challenging task, where only\n10\\% of the data are labeled, the proposed SSFL-DCSL can improve accuracy by\n1.15% to 7.85% over state-of-the-art methods.",

To address this, we introduce a method that leverages deep\nlearning to infer a suitable sub-THz RU candidate from a set of sub-THz RUs\nusing the sub-10 GHz channel characteristics. A novel aspect of this work is\nthe consideration of inter-band beam configuration (IBBC), defined as the\nbroadside angle between the low-band and high-band antenna patterns of the user\nequipment (UE). Since IBBC indicates the beamforming information or UE's\norientation, it is typically not shared with the network as a part of\nsignalling.

First, we derive the field equations in this framework. Then, we\nstudy the cosmological evolution in a spatially flat, homogeneous, and\nisotropic universe described by the FRW metric, containing radiation and\nnon-relativistic matter with energy densities rho_r and rho_m, respectively. We\nanalyze the system as an autonomous dynamical model of dark energy. The\ncosmological behavior depends on the coupling function sigma =\nf'(phi)/sqrt(f(phi)) and the potential parameter lambda = [V'(phi) * f(phi)] /\n[V(phi) * f'(phi)]. A constant coupling sigma leads to a quadratic form f(phi)\nproportional to (phi + c)^2, while a constant lambda results in a power-law\npotential V(phi) proportional to f(phi)^lambda. These forms are supported by\nmathematical and physical considerations. We perform phase space analysis and\nshow that lambda much greater than 1 is a necessary condition to obtain a\nradiation-dominated era with effective equation of state w_eff approximately\n1/3 and a matter-dominated era with w_eff approximately 0.

They have been applied to\ndifferent WL surveys successfully. To further facilitate their high precision\napplications, it is very timely to investigate the impacts of different\nsystematics on WL peak statistics and how to mitigate them. Concerning the\ninfluence from galaxy intrinsic alignments (IAs), in this paper, we develop a\ntheoretical model for WL high peaks taking into account the IA effects. It is\nan extension of our previous halo-based model. The IA corrections mainly\ninclude the modification of the lensing profile of clusters of galaxies due to\nthe alignments of satellite galaxies and the additional shape noise\ncorrelations. We validate our model using simulations with the semi-analytical\ngalaxy formation. We consider the cases where the satellite galaxies are\naveragely radially aligned toward the centers of their host clusters but with\ndifferent dispersions $\\sigma_{\\theta}$. We show that our model works well for\n$\\sigma_{\\theta}>45^{\\circ}$. If the IA corrections are not included in the\nmodel, for the Euclid/CSST-like source galaxy distribution and the survey area\nof $\\sim 1000 deg^2$, the IA induced bias on $S_8$ can reach $\\sim 8\\sigma$\neven for $\\sigma_{\\theta}=75^{\\circ}$.

Efficient beam alignment is essential for initial access, but\ndeep learning (DL) solutions face challenges, including high data collection\noverhead, hardware constraints, lack of explainability, and susceptibility to\nadversarial attacks. This paper proposes a robust and explainable DL-based beam\nalignment engine (BAE) for mmWave multiple-input multiple output (MIMO)\nsystems. The BAE uses received signal strength indicator (RSSI) measurements\nfrom wide beams to predict the best narrow beam, reducing the overhead of\nexhaustive beam sweeping. To overcome the challenge of real-world data\ncollection, this work leverages a site-specific digital twin (DT) to generate\nsynthetic channel data closely resembling real-world environments. A model\nrefinement via transfer learning is proposed to fine-tune the pre-trained model\nresiding in the DT with minimal real-world data, effectively bridging\nmismatches between the digital replica and real-world environments. To reduce\nbeam training overhead and enhance transparency, the framework uses deep\nShapley additive explanations (SHAP) to rank input features by importance,\nprioritizing key spatial directions and minimizing beam sweeping. It also\nincorporates the Deep k-nearest neighbors (DkNN) algorithm, providing a\ncredibility metric for detecting out-of-distribution inputs and ensuring\nrobust, transparent decision-making. Experimental results show that the\nproposed framework reduces real-world data needs by 70%, beam training overhead\nby 62%, and improves outlier detection robustness by up to 8.5x, achieving\nnear-optimal spectral efficiency and transparent decision making compared to\ntraditional softmax based DL models.",

TorC is a case\nof Poincar\\'e gauge theory -- a formulation of gravity motivated by the gauge\nfield theories underlying fundamental forces in the standard model of particle\nphysics. Unlike general relativity, TorC incorporates intrinsic torsion degrees\nof freedom while maintaining second-order field equations. At specific\nparameter values, it reduces to the $\\Lambda$CDM model, providing a natural\nextension to standard cosmology. The base model of TorC introduces two\nparameters beyond those in $\\Lambda$CDM: the initial value of the torsion\nscalar field and its time derivative -- one can absorb the latter by allowing\nthe dark energy density to float. To constrain these parameters, `PolyChord`\nnested sampling algorithm is employed, interfaced via `Cobaya` with a modified\nversion of `CAMB`. Our results indicate that TorC allows for a larger inferred\nHubble constant, offering a potential resolution to the Hubble tension. Tension\nanalysis using the $R$-statistic shows that TorC alleviates the statistical\ntension between the Planck 2018 and SH0Es 2020 datasets, though this\nimprovement is not sufficient to decisively favour TorC over $\\Lambda$CDM in a\nBayesian model comparison. This study highlights TorC as a compelling theory of\ngravity, demonstrating its potential to address cosmological tensions and\nmotivating further investigations of extended theories of gravity within a\ncosmological context. As current and upcoming surveys -- including Euclid,\nRoman Space Telescope, Vera C.

For each image, we collected values of\ndifficulty, efficacy, artistic quality, and emotional arousal from human\nrating, as well as number of tags generated by participants to summarize the\nmessage. Semantic and emotion variables were further derived from the tags via\nNatural Language Processing. Visual metaphors were rated as more difficult to\nunderstand, yet more aesthetically pleasant than literal images, but did not\ndiffer in efficacy and arousal. The latter for visual metaphors, however, was\nhigher in participants with higher Need For Cognition. Furthermore, visual\nmetaphors received more tags, often referring to entities not depicted in the\nimage, and elicited words with more positive valence and greater dominance than\nliteral images. These results evidence the greater cognitive load of visual\nmetaphors, which nevertheless might induce positive effects such as deeper\ncognitive elaboration and abstraction compared to literal stimuli. Furthermore,\nwhile they are not deemed as more effective and arousing, visual metaphors seem\nto generate superior aesthetic appreciation and a more positively valenced\nexperience.

This flexible information exchange mechanism contrasts with\nfixed protocols such as always sharing or never sharing. We formulate a joint\noptimization of inventory control and communication strategies, aiming to\nbalance the trade-off between communication overhead and operational\nperformance (service levels, holding, and stockout costs). We adopt a common\ninformation framework and derive a centralized Partially Observable Markov\nDecision Process (POMDP) model for a supply chain coordinator. Solving this\ncoordinator's POMDP via dynamic programming characterizes the structure of\noptimal policies, determining when retailers should communicate and how they\nshould adjust orders based on available information. We show that, in this\nsetting, retailers can often act optimally by sharing only limited summaries of\ntheir private data, reducing communication frequency without compromising\nperformance.

While these AI tools,\nparticularly those based on Natural Language Processing (NLP), promise to\nimprove efficiency, their adoption remains limited in regulated industries\nwhere transparency and traceability are essential. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the explainability gap in AI-driven design artifact generation\nthrough semi-structured interviews with ten practitioners from safety-critical\nindustries. We examine how current AI-based tools are integrated into workflows\nand the challenges arising from their lack of explainability. We also explore\nmitigation strategies, their impact on project outcomes, and features needed to\nimprove usability. Our findings reveal that non-explainable AI outputs\nnecessitate extensive manual validation, reduce stakeholder trust, struggle to\nhandle domain-specific terminology, disrupt team collaboration, and introduce\nregulatory compliance risks, often negating the anticipated efficiency\nbenefits. To address these issues, we identify key improvements, including\nsource tracing, providing clear justifications for tool-generated decisions,\nsupporting domain-specific adaptation, and enabling compliance validation.

Despite its promising potential, a major challenge in bistatic\ncooperative sensing lies in the degradation of sensing accuracy, primarily\ncaused by the inherently weak received signals resulting from high reflection\nlosses in complex environments. Traditional methods have predominantly relied\non adaptive filtering techniques to enhance the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) by\ndynamically adjusting the filter coefficients. However, these methods often\nstruggle to adapt effectively to the increasingly complex and diverse network\ntopologies. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Image\nSuper-Resolution-based Signal Enhancement (ISR-SE) framework that significantly\nimproves the recognition and recovery capabilities of ISAC signals.\nSpecifically, we first perform a time-frequency analysis by applying the\nShort-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) to the received signals, generating\nspectrograms that capture the frequency, magnitude, and phase components. These\ncomponents are then mapped into RGB images, where each channel represents one\nof the extracted features, enabling a more intuitive and informative\nvisualization of the signal structure. To enhance these RGB images, we design\nan improved denoising network that combines the strengths of the UNet\narchitecture and diffusion models. This hybrid architecture leverages UNet's\nmulti-scale feature extraction and the generative capacity of diffusion models\nto perform effective image denoising, thereby improving the quality and clarity\nof signal representations under low-SNR conditions.",

    "abstract": "Point tracking aims to identify the same physical point across video frames\nand serves as a geometry-aware representation of motion. This representation\nsupports a wide range of applications, from robotics to augmented reality, by\nenabling accurate modeling of dynamic environments. Most existing long-term\ntracking approaches operate in an offline setting, where future frames are\navailable to refine predictions and recover from occlusions. However,\nreal-world scenarios often demand online predictions: the model must operate\ncausally, using only current and past frames. This constraint is critical in\nstreaming video and embodied AI, where decisions must be made immediately based\non past observations. Under such constraints, viewpoint invariance becomes\nessential. Visual foundation models, trained on diverse large-scale datasets,\noffer the potential for robust geometric representations. While they lack\ntemporal reasoning on their own, they can be integrated into tracking pipelines\nto enrich spatial features. In this thesis, we address the problem of long-term\npoint tracking in an online setting, where frames are processed sequentially\nwithout access to future information or sliding windows. We begin by evaluating\nthe suitability of visual foundation models for this task and find that they\ncan serve as useful initializations and be integrated into tracking pipelines.\nHowever, to enable long-term tracking in an online setting, a dedicated design\nis still required. In particular, maintaining coherence over time in this\ncausal regime requires memory to propagate appearance and context across\nframes. To address this, we introduce Track-On, a transformer-based model that\ntreats each tracked point as a query and processes video frames one at a time.\nTrack-On sets a new state of the art across seven public benchmarks,\ndemonstrating the feasibility of long-term tracking without future access.",

However, a significant\nchallenge in bistatic cooperative sensing is clock asynchronism, arising from\nthe use of different clocks at far separated transmitters and receivers. This\nasynchrony leads to Timing Offsets (TOs) and Carrier Frequency Offsets (CFOs),\npotentially causing sensing ambiguity. Traditional synchronization methods\ntypically rely on static reference links or GNSS-based timing sources, both of\nwhich are often unreliable or unavailable in UAVbased bistatic ISAC scenarios.\nTo overcome these limitations, we propose a Time-Varying Offset Estimation\n(TVOE) framework tailored for clock-asynchronous bistatic ISAC systems, which\nleverages the geometrically predictable characteristics of the Line-of-Sight\n(LoS) path to enable robust, infrastructure-free\n  synchronization.

    "abstract": "3D detection technology is widely used in the field of autonomous driving,\nwith its application scenarios gradually expanding from enclosed highways to\nopen conventional roads. For rare anomaly categories that appear on the road,\n3D detection models trained on closed sets often misdetect or fail to detect\nanomaly objects. To address this risk, it is necessary to enhance the\ngeneralization ability of 3D detection models for targets of arbitrary shapes\nand to possess the capability to filter out anomalies. The generalization of 3D\ndetection is limited by two factors: the coupled training of 2D and 3D, and the\ninsufficient diversity in the scale distribution of training samples. This\npaper proposes a Stereo-based 3D Anomaly object Detection (S3AD) algorithm,\nwhich decouples the training strategy of 3D and 2D to release the\ngeneralization ability for arbitrary 3D foreground detection, and proposes an\nanomaly scoring algorithm based on foreground confidence prediction, achieving\ntarget-level anomaly scoring. In order to further verify and enhance the\ngeneralization of anomaly detection, we use a 3D rendering method to synthesize\ntwo augmented reality binocular stereo 3D detection datasets which named\nKITTI-AR. KITTI-AR extends upon KITTI by adding 97 new categories, totaling 6k\npairs of stereo images. The KITTI-AR-ExD subset includes 39 common categories\nas extra training data to address the sparse sample distribution issue.\nAdditionally, 58 rare categories form the KITTI-AR-OoD subset, which are not\nused in training to simulate zero-shot scenarios in real-world settings, solely\nfor evaluating 3D anomaly detection.

This design\nsignificantly reduces memory footprint, data movement, and energy consumption.\nOur comprehensive evaluation demonstrates SLIM's effectiveness, achieving\n13-18x throughput improvements over SSD-GPU systems and 9-10x better energy\nefficiency over DRAM-GPU systems while maintaining low latency, making\ncost-effective LLM deployment viable for edge computing environments.",

OpenCAMS is designed to support\nadvanced research in transportation safety, mobility, and cybersecurity by\ncombining the strengths of each simulation domain. Specifically, SUMO provides\nlarge-scale, microscopic traffic modeling; CARLA offers high-fidelity 3D\nperception, vehicle dynamics, and control simulation; and OMNeT++ enables\nmodular, event-driven network communication, such as cellular\nvehicle-to-everything (C-V2X). OpenCAMS employs a time-synchronized,\nbidirectional coupling architecture that ensures coherent simulation\nprogression across traffic, perception, and communication domains while\npreserving modularity and reproducibility. For example, CARLA can simulate and\nrender a subset of vehicles that require detailed sensor emulation and control\nlogic; SUMO orchestrates network-wide traffic flow, vehicle routing, and\ntraffic signal management; and OMNeT++ dynamically maps communication nodes to\nboth mobile entities (e.g., vehicles) and static entities (e.g., roadside\nunits) to enable C-V2X communication.

This paper reveals the negative impact of the long-term\ndecay in Rotary Position Encoding (RoPE), used for positional modeling in\nLVLMs, on multimodal alignment. Concretely, under long-term decay, instruction\ntokens exhibit uneven perception of image tokens located at different positions\nwithin the two-dimensional space: prioritizing image tokens from the\nbottom-right region since in the one-dimensional sequence, these tokens are\npositionally closer to the instruction tokens. This biased perception leads to\ninsufficient image-instruction interaction and suboptimal multimodal alignment.\nWe refer to this phenomenon as image alignment bias. To enhance instruction's\nperception of image tokens at different spatial locations, we propose\nMCA-LLaVA, based on Manhattan distance, which extends the long-term decay to a\ntwo-dimensional, multi-directional spatial decay. MCA-LLaVA integrates the\none-dimensional sequence order and two-dimensional spatial position of image\ntokens for positional modeling, mitigating hallucinations by alleviating image\nalignment bias. Experimental results of MCA-LLaVA across various hallucination\nand general benchmarks demonstrate its effectiveness and generality.

However, despite recent work on\nboundary-integrated GPs, such models largely cannot accommodate boundary\ninformation on irregular (i.e., non-hypercube) domains, and do not provide\nsample path smoothness control or approximation error analysis, both of which\nare important for reliable surrogate modeling.

    "abstract": "Accurate extrinsic calibration of multiple LiDARs is crucial for improving\nthe foundational performance of three-dimensional (3D) map reconstruction\nsystems. This paper presents a novel targetless extrinsic calibration framework\nfor multi-LiDAR systems that does not rely on overlapping fields of view or\nprecise initial parameter estimates. Unlike conventional calibration methods\nthat require manual annotations or specific reference patterns, our approach\nintroduces a unified optimization framework by integrating LiDAR bundle\nadjustment (LBA) optimization with robust iterative refinement. The proposed\nmethod constructs an accurate reference point cloud map via continuous scanning\nfrom the target LiDAR and sliding-window LiDAR bundle adjustment, while\nformulating extrinsic calibration as a joint LBA optimization problem. This\nmethod effectively mitigates cumulative mapping errors and achieves\noutlier-resistant parameter estimation through an adaptive weighting mechanism.\nExtensive evaluations in both the CARLA simulation environment and real-world\nscenarios demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art calibration\ntechniques in both accuracy and robustness. Experimental results show that for\nnon-overlapping sensor configurations, our framework achieves an average\ntranslational error of 5 mm and a rotational error of 0.2{\\deg}, with an\ninitial error tolerance of up to 0.4 m/30{\\deg}. Moreover, the calibration\nprocess operates without specialized infrastructure or manual parameter tuning.\nThe code is open source and available on GitHub\n(\\underline{https://github.com/Silentbarber/DLBAcalib})",

Using the FUKA initial data framework, we\ndetermine the location of ISCO (Innermost Stable Circular Orbit) and radius of\nmass shedding. In most of the cases studied here the innermost stable orbit is\nlocated at larger separations. This is consistent with the fact that for those\ntwo events no electromagnetic counterparts have been observed since it is\nbelieved that the NS will enter into the plunge phase in a short time once the\nseparation of the components of the binary will be smaller of ISCO. In analogy\nwith classical binaries, we have associated to these QE sequences a Newtonian\nand Post Newtonian Roche Lobe analysis to verify whether the NS is filling its\nRoche Lobe before approaching the ISCO. For selected configurations explored\nhere, the location of ISCO and of the orbit at which mass shedding occurs are\nat separation smaller than the last converged solution of our sequences. Our\nanalysis shows that in such cases the neutron star is filling its Roche lobe\nsuggesting that mass transfer might occur well before encountering the last\nstable orbit, and this should happen in catastrophic way in order to prevent\nany electromagnetic emissions.

While graph-based methods have achieved\nstrong predictive performance, most approaches treat drug pairs independently,\noverlooking the complex, context-dependent interactions unique to drug pairs.\nAdditionally, these models struggle to integrate biological interaction\nnetworks and molecular-level structures to provide meaningful mechanistic\ninsights. In this study, we propose MolecBioNet, a novel graph-based framework\nthat integrates molecular and biomedical knowledge for robust and interpretable\nDDI prediction. By modeling drug pairs as unified entities, MolecBioNet\ncaptures both macro-level biological interactions and micro-level molecular\ninfluences, offering a comprehensive perspective on DDIs. The framework\nextracts local subgraphs from biomedical knowledge graphs and constructs\nhierarchical interaction graphs from molecular representations, leveraging\nclassical graph neural network methods to learn multi-scale representations of\ndrug pairs. To enhance accuracy and interpretability, MolecBioNet introduces\ntwo domain-specific pooling strategies: context-aware subgraph pooling\n(CASPool), which emphasizes biologically relevant entities, and\nattention-guided influence pooling (AGIPool), which prioritizes influential\nmolecular substructures. The framework further employs mutual information\nminimization regularization to enhance information diversity during embedding\nfusion.

We advance VLAs' implicit knowledge beyond\nidentifying what to do, towards guiding how to physically interact with real\nworld. This paper introduces Tactile-VLA, a novel framework that deeply fuses\nvision, language, action, and tactile sensing. This framework incorporates a\nhybrid position-force controller to translate the model's intentions into\nprecise physical actions and a reasoning module that allows the robot to adapt\nits strategy based on tactile feedback. Experiments demonstrate Tactile-VLA's\neffectiveness and generalizability in three key aspects: (1) enabling\ntactile-aware instruction following, (2) utilizing tactile-relevant\ncommonsense, and (3) facilitating adaptive tactile-involved reasoning. A key\nfinding is that the VLM's prior knowledge already contains semantic\nunderstanding of physical interaction; by connecting it to the robot's tactile\nsensors with only a few demonstrations, we can activate this prior knowledge to\nachieve zero-shot generalization in contact-rich tasks.",

To address these\nchallenges, we propose a demand-driven communication system supported by High\nAltitude Platform Stations (HAPS) to restore communication in an affected area\nand enable effective disaster relief. The proposed emergency response network\nis a promising solution as it provides a rapidly deployable, resilient\ncommunications infrastructure.

This quasi-van der Waals (vdW) layered material with\nintercalated Cr atoms possesses many peculiar features that depend on the\namount of Cr intercalation, although the microscopic magnetic ground state is\nstill elusive. We reveal the structural and magnetic properties of\ntr-Cr$_{1.22}$Te$_{2}$ by low-temperature x-ray diffraction, magnetization,\ntemperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy, and single-crystal neutron\ndiffraction studies. Magnetization measurements under small applied magnetic\nfield indicate two successive magnetic transitions, one from a ferromagnetic\n(FM) state to an antiferromagnetic (AFM) state (T$_\\mathrm{C}=197$ K), and\nsecond from AFM to a paramagnetic state (T$_\\mathrm{N}=211$ K). The FM\ntransition is sharp with a strong presence of magnetoelastic coupling, but is\nnot accompanied by any structural phase transition. The magnetic structure\nobtained from zero-field single crystal neutron diffraction reveals that the\nCr1 and Cr2 moments are ferromagnetically aligned along the c-axis, while the\nCr3 and intercalated Cr4 atoms induce an AFM component in the ab-plane leading\nto an umbrella-like spin structure which possesses a finite spin chirality. The\npresence of a finite spin chirality is responsible for the observation of the\ntopological Hall effect (THE).",

While tokenization has revolutionized\nimage and video generation, efficiently tokenizing complex 3D scenes remains a\ncritical challenge for 3D world models. To address this, we propose\n$I^{2}$-World, an efficient framework for 4D occupancy forecasting. Our method\ndecouples scene tokenization into intra-scene and inter-scene tokenizers. The\nintra-scene tokenizer employs a multi-scale residual quantization strategy to\nhierarchically compress 3D scenes while preserving spatial details. The\ninter-scene tokenizer residually aggregates temporal dependencies across\ntimesteps. This dual design preserves the compactness of 3D tokenizers while\nretaining the dynamic expressiveness of 4D tokenizers. Unlike decoder-only\nGPT-style autoregressive models, $I^{2}$-World adopts an encoder-decoder\narchitecture. The encoder aggregates spatial context from the current scene and\npredicts a transformation matrix to enable high-level control over scene\ngeneration. The decoder, conditioned on this matrix and historical tokens,\nensures temporal consistency during generation. Experiments demonstrate that\n$I^{2}$-World achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing\nmethods by 25.1\\% in mIoU and 36.9\\% in IoU for 4D occupancy forecasting while\nexhibiting exceptional computational efficiency: it requires merely 2.9 GB of\ntraining memory and achieves real-time inference at 37.0 FPS.

    "abstract": "Nonlinearly stable flux reconstruction (NSFR) combines the key properties of\nprovable nonlinear stability with the increased time step from energy-stable\nflux reconstruction. The NSFR scheme has been successfully applied to unsteady\ncompressible flows. Through the use of a bound-preserving limiter, positivity\nof thermodynamic quantities is preserved, and this enables the extension of\nNSFR to hyperbolic conservation laws. We extend the limiter of Zhang and Shu\n[1] to ensure robustness for the proposed scheme. The limiter is modified to\nconsider the minimum density and pressure at the solution nodes when\ndetermining the value to scale the solution. The modifications are thoroughly\ntested with a suite of test cases. In addition to these modifications, this\npaper conducts a thorough investigation into the shock-capturing capabilities\nof the NSFR scheme and the advantages it presents over standard discontinuous\nGalerkin (DG) methods, where, on select variants of the flux reconstruction\n(FR) scheme, essentially oscillation-free solutions are demonstrated. Various\nparameters of the scheme are extensively tested and analyzed through several 1D\nand 2D compressible Euler tests that verify the high-order accuracy, entropy\nstability, time step advantage and shock-capturing capabilities of the NSFR\nscheme. These parameters include the two-point flux, quadrature nodes and the\nstrength of the FR parameter. In addition to investigating the impact of the\nvarious two-point fluxes, this paper also presents numerical studies to\ndetermine the CFL condition required to maintain positivity for the two-point\nflux of choice. The investigation yields insightful results for all parameters,\nwith the results pertaining to the type of FR scheme being of special interest.\nThe tests showcase increased robustness, time step advantages and\noscillation/overshoot mitigation when employing a stronger FR parameter.",

Existing\nimputation methods for attribute-missing graphs often fail to account for the\nvarying amounts of information available across node neighborhoods, leading to\nunreliable results, especially for nodes with insufficient known neighborhood.\nTo address this issue, we propose a novel method named Divide-Then-Rule Graph\nCompletion (DTRGC). This method first addresses nodes with sufficient known\nneighborhood information and treats the imputed results as new knowledge to\niteratively impute more challenging nodes, while leveraging clustering\ninformation to correct imputation errors. Specifically, Dynamic Cluster-Aware\nFeature Propagation (DCFP) initializes missing node attributes by adjusting\npropagation weights based on the clustering structure. Subsequently,\nHierarchical Neighborhood-aware Imputation (HNAI) categorizes attribute-missing\nnodes into three groups based on the completeness of their neighborhood\nattributes. The imputation is performed hierarchically, prioritizing the groups\nwith nodes that have the most available neighborhood information. The cluster\nstructure is then used to refine the imputation and correct potential errors.\nFinally, Hop-wise Representation Enhancement (HRE) integrates information\nacross multiple hops, thereby enriching the expressiveness of node\nrepresentations. Experimental results on six widely used graph datasets show\nthat DTRGC significantly improves the clustering performance of various DGC\nmethods under attribute-missing graphs.",

    "abstract": "Dexterous intelligence -- the ability to perform complex interactions with\nmulti-fingered hands -- is a pinnacle of human physical intelligence and\nemergent higher-order cognitive skills. However, contrary to Moravec's paradox,\ndexterous intelligence in humans appears simple only superficially. Many\nmillion years were spent co-evolving the human brain and hands including rich\ntactile sensing. Achieving human-level dexterity with robotic hands has long\nbeen a fundamental goal in robotics and represents a critical milestone toward\ngeneral embodied intelligence. In this pursuit, computational sensorimotor\nlearning has made significant progress, enabling feats such as arbitrary\nin-hand object reorientation. However, we observe that achieving higher levels\nof dexterity requires overcoming very fundamental limitations of computational\nsensorimotor learning.\n  I develop robot learning methods for highly dexterous multi-fingered\nmanipulation by directly addressing these limitations at their root cause.\nChiefly, through key studies, this disseration progressively builds an\neffective framework for reinforcement learning of dexterous multi-fingered\nmanipulation skills. These methods adopt structured exploration, effectively\novercoming the limitations of random exploration in reinforcement learning. The\ninsights gained culminate in a highly effective reinforcement learning that\nincorporates sampling-based planning for direct exploration. Additionally, this\nthesis explores a new paradigm of using visuo-tactile human demonstrations for\ndexterity, introducing corresponding imitation learning techniques.",

    "abstract": "Despite improvements in automatic speech recognition, performance drops with\naccented speech. Generative error correction (GER) leverages the linguistic\nknowledge of large language models (LLMs), outperforming typical language model\nmethods. However, it lacks specificity in accented speech scenarios. Accents\nrepresent deviations from standard pronunciation, making multi-granularity\npronunciation and semantic information essential for accented speech\nrecognition. Moreover, accents exhibit considerable diversity, with each accent\npossessing distinct characteristics. In this study, we leverage GER to improve\ntranscription accuracy by addressing the two primary features. We propose the\nmulti-modal GER, which integrates pronunciation information from the speech\nmodality, and the multi-granularity GER, which incorporates fine-grained\nphoneme-level pronunciation information. These methods enable the LLM to\nutilize the pronunciation information of accented speech and the semantic\ninformation from word-level hypotheses for accurate transcription predictions\nthrough low-rank adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning. We employ a three-stage\nstrategy to train separate multi-modal GER models for each accent to obtain\nmono-accent LoRA experts. By adopting our proposed HDMoLE method, which\nincorporates hierarchical routing and dynamic thresholds within the mixture of\nLoRA experts, we effectively merge mono-accent LoRA experts within a single\nmulti-modal GER to overcome accent diversity challenges. Furthermore,\nmulti-granularity GER leverages N-best word-level and phoneme-level hypotheses\nfrom the HDMoLE model to predict final transcriptions. Experiments on a\nmulti-accent English dataset show that our methods reduce word error rate by\n67.35% compared to the baseline vanilla Whisper-large-v3 model.",

The small-signal transfer function from the\nduty cycle to the output voltage is obtained to support control development. In\naddition, the Proportional-Integral (PI) control based on the frequency-domain\nmethod was explored. The PI controller was tuned to achieve various phase\nmargins and is evaluated through Bode plots, step responses, and performance\nmetrics, revealing trade-offs between overshoot, settling time, and\nsteady-state error.

    "abstract": "Among techniques for high-dimensional linear regression, Sorted L-One\nPenalized Estimation (SLOPE) generalizes the LASSO via an adaptive $l_1$\nregularization that applies heavier penalties to larger coefficients in the\nmodel. To achieve such adaptivity, SLOPE requires the specification of a\ncomplex hierarchy of penalties, i.e., a monotone penalty sequence in $R^p$, in\ncontrast to a single penalty scalar for LASSO. Tuning this sequence when $p$ is\nlarge poses a challenge, as brute force search over a grid of values is\ncomputationally prohibitive. In this work, we study the 2-level SLOPE, an\nimportant subclass of SLOPE, with only three hyperparameters. We demonstrate\nboth empirically and analytically that 2-level SLOPE not only preserves the\nadvantages of general SLOPE -- such as improved mean squared error and\novercoming the Donoho-Tanner power limit -- but also exhibits computational\nbenefits by reducing the penalty hyperparameter space. In particular, we prove\nthat 2-level SLOPE admits a sharp, theoretically tight characterization of the\ntrade-off between true positive proportion (TPP) and false discovery proportion\n(FDP), contrasting with general SLOPE where only upper and lower bounds are\nknown. Empirical evaluations further underscore the effectiveness of 2-level\nSLOPE in settings where predictors exhibit high correlation, when the noise is\nlarge, or when the underlying signal is not sparse. Our results suggest that\n2-level SLOPE offers a robust, scalable alternative to both LASSO and general\nSLOPE, making it particularly suited for practical high-dimensional data\nanalysis.",

The CoVAE encoder learns a progressive\nseries of latent representations with increasing encoding noise levels,\nmirroring the forward processes of diffusion and flow matching models. This\nsequence of representations is regulated by a time dependent $\\beta$ parameter\nthat scales the KL loss. The decoder is trained using a consistency loss with\nvariational regularization, which reduces to a conventional VAE loss at the\nearliest latent time. We show that CoVAE can generate high-quality samples in\none or few steps without the use of a learned prior, significantly\noutperforming equivalent VAEs and other single-stage VAEs methods. Our approach\nprovides a unified framework for autoencoding and diffusion-style generative\nmodeling and provides a viable route for one-step generative high-performance\nautoencoding.

    "abstract": "Diffusion-based models, widely used in text-to-image generation, have proven\neffective in 2D representation learning. Recently, this framework has been\nextended to 3D self-supervised learning by constructing a conditional point\ngenerator for enhancing 3D representations. However, its performance remains\nconstrained by the 3D diffusion model, which is trained on the available 3D\ndatasets with limited size. We hypothesize that the robust capabilities of\ntext-to-image diffusion models, particularly Stable Diffusion (SD), which is\ntrained on large-scale datasets, can help overcome these limitations. To\ninvestigate this hypothesis, we propose PointSD, a framework that leverages the\nSD model for 3D self-supervised learning. By replacing the SD model's text\nencoder with a 3D encoder, we train a point-to-image diffusion model that\nallows point clouds to guide the denoising of rendered noisy images. With the\ntrained point-to-image diffusion model, we use noise-free images as the input\nand point clouds as the condition to extract SD features. Next, we train a 3D\nbackbone by aligning its features with these SD features, thereby facilitating\ndirect semantic learning. Comprehensive experiments on downstream point cloud\ntasks and ablation studies demonstrate that the SD model can enhance point\ncloud self-supervised learning.

Leveraging\nrecipe knowledge to recommend complementary ingredients based on a partial\nbasket is essential for improving the culinary experience. Traditional recipe\ncompletion methods typically predict a single missing ingredient using a\nleave-one-out strategy.

We introduce\nS2SRec2, a set-to-set ingredient recommendation framework based on a Set\nTransformer and trained in a multitask learning paradigm.

    "abstract": "In recent years, the existence of a gap in the mass spectrum of compact\nobjects formed from stellar collapse, between the heaviest neutron stars and\nthe lightest black holes, has been a matter of significant debate. The presence\nor absence of a mass gap has implications for the supernova mechanism, as well\nas being a fundamental property of the compact object mass function. In X-ray\nbinaries containing black holes a gap is observed, but it is not known whether\nthis is representative of a true gap in the mass function or due to selection\neffects or systematic biases in mass estimation. Binary black hole mergers\ndetected from gravitational waves in the GWTC-3 transient catalog furnish a\nlarge sample of several tens of low-mass black holes with a well-understood\nselection function. Here we analyze the \\nevts{} GWTC-3 merger events (along\nwith GW230529\\_181500) with at least one black hole ($3 \\, M_\\odot < m_1$) and\nchirp masses below those of a $20\\,M_\\odot$--$20\\,M_\\odot$ merger ($\\mathcal{M}\n< 17.41 M_{\\odot}$) to uncover the structure of the low-mass black hole mass\nfunction. Using flexible parameterized models for the mass function, we find,\nsimilar to existing studies, a sharp peak in the mass function at $m \\simeq\n(8-10 M_{\\odot})$. We observe a steady decline in the merger rate to lower\nmasses, but by less than an order of magnitude in total, and find that the\nfirst percentile of black hole masses in our most flexible model is $m_{1\\%}\n=3.13^{+0.18}_{-0.04}$. In other words, this sample of low-mass black holes is\nnot consistent with the existence of a mass gap.",

    "abstract": "Rotational acceleration of the head has long been posited as the primary\ncause of concussion due to its ability to generate shear strains that disrupt\nneuronal structure and function [1,2]. Linear acceleration, by contrast, is\nconsidered less injurious due to the brain's suspension in cerebrospinal fluid\nwithin the rigid skull [3,4]. As a result, the rotational acceleration\nhypothesis has predominantly driven international safety standards and\nprotective equipment design. However, direct measurements of rotational\nacceleration during human concussion remain limited, leaving the rotational\nhypothesis largely untested in vivo. Here we show that linear acceleration is a\nsignificantly more precise predictor of concussion than rotational\nacceleration. We used mouthguards instrumented with inertial sensors to\ndirectly measure head kinematics during concussions occurring in children and\nadults of both sexes. Surprisingly, we found that rotational acceleration was\nnot a significant independent predictor of concussion. Finite-element computed\nbrain strains also had little predictive power, suggesting limitations in\nmodeling the intracranial contents purely as solid materials. We suspect that\nmodeling cerebrospinal fluid flow might reveal a protective effect that is\nlimited by the magnitude of linear acceleration and the size of the\nsubarachnoid space. Inspired by the protective role of cerebrospinal fluid, we\ninvented a liquid shock absorbing technology and modeled it in a bicycle\nhelmet. Using linear acceleration as a concussion risk function, we predict\nthat our liquid technology can reduce the risk of concussion by up to 73\npercent compared to a conventional foam helmet. Together, our findings support\nthe inclusion of linear acceleration in concussion safety regulations and the\nneed for advanced technologies to reduce impact forces and injury risk.",

    "abstract": "The connection between the drag and vorticity dynamics for viscous flow over\na bluff body is explored using the Josephson-Anderson (J-A) relation for\nclassical fluids. The instantaneous rate of work on the fluid, associated with\nthe drag force, is related to the vorticity flux across the streamlines of a\nbackground potential flow. The vorticity transport itself is examined by aid of\nthe Huggins vorticity flux tensor. The analysis is performed for three flows:\nflow over a sphere at Reynolds numbers $Re=\\{200,3700\\}$ and flow over a\nprolate spheroid at $Re=3000$ and $20^{\\circ}$ incidence. In these flows, the\nvorticity transport shifts the flow away and towards the ideal potential flow,\nwith a net balance towards the former effect thus making an appreciably\ncontribution to the drag. The J-A relation is first demonstrated for the flow\nover a sphere at $Re=200$. The drag is related to the viscous flux of azimuthal\nvorticity from the wall into the fluid and the advection of vorticity by the\nshear layer. In the wake, the azimuthal vorticity is advected towards the wake\ncenterline and is annihilated by viscous effects, which contributes a reduction\nto drag. The analysis of the flow over a sphere at $Re=3700$ is reported for\nthe impulsively started and stationary stages, with emphasis on the effects of\nunsteady separation and turbulent transport in the wake. The turbulent flux in\nthe wake enhances the transport of mean azimuthal vorticity towards the wake\ncenterline, and is the driver of the recovery of enthalpy downstream. The drag\nforce for a prolate spheroid is mostly due to the transport of vorticity along\nthe separated boundary layers. Primary and secondary separation contribute\noppositely to the drag force, while the large-scale vortices only re-distribute\nvorticity. A mechanism for secondary separation is proposed based on the theory\nof vortex-induced separation.",

In this paper, we introduce\nDejaVu, a novel attack that exploits network-induced delays to create subtle\ntemporal misalignments across sensor streams, severely degrading downstream\nMMF-based perception tasks. Our comprehensive attack analysis across different\nmodels and datasets reveals these sensors' task-specific imbalanced\nsensitivities: object detection is overly dependent on LiDAR inputs while\nobject tracking is highly reliant on the camera inputs. Consequently, with a\nsingle-frame LiDAR delay, an attacker can reduce the car detection mAP by up to\n88.5%, while with a three-frame camera delay, multiple object tracking accuracy\n(MOTA) for car drops by 73%. To detect such attacks, we propose AION, a defense\npatch that can work alongside the existing perception model to monitor temporal\nalignment through cross-modal temporal consistency. AION leverages multimodal\nshared representation learning and dynamic time warping to determine the path\nof temporal alignment and calculate anomaly scores based on the alignment. Our\nthorough evaluation of AION shows it achieves AUROC scores of 0.92-0.98 with\nlow false positives across datasets and model architectures, demonstrating it\nas a robust and generalized defense against the temporal misalignment attacks.",

In\nthe proposed framework, a set of controlled UAVs cooperatively estimate the\nreal-time 3D position of a target UAV. Here, the active UAV transmits a\nmeasurement signal to the passive UAVs via the reflection from the target UAV.\nEach passive UAV estimates the distance of the active-target-passive UAV link\nand selects an antenna port to share the distance information with the base\nstation (BS) that calculates the real-time position of the target UAV.

We formulate this problem as an\noptimization problem to minimize the target UAV positioning error via\noptimizing the trajectories of all controlled UAVs and antenna port selection\nof passive UAVs. Here, an attention-based recurrent multi-agent reinforcement\nlearning (AR-MARL) scheme is proposed, which enables each controlled UAV to use\nthe local Q function to determine its trajectory and antenna port while\noptimizing the target UAV positioning performance without knowing the\ntrajectories and antenna port selections of other controlled UAVs. Different\nfrom current MARL methods, the proposed method uses a recurrent neural network\n(RNN) that incorporates historical state-action pairs of each controlled UAV,\nand an attention mechanism to analyze the importance of these historical\nstate-action pairs, thus improving the global Q function approximation accuracy\nand the target UAV positioning accuracy.

To combat the heavy-tailed\nnoise, a general black-box nonlinear framework is considered, subsuming\nnonlinearities like sign, clipping, normalization and their smooth\ncounterparts. Our first result shows that nonlinear SGD (N-SGD) achieves the\nrate $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(t^{-1/2})$, for any noise with unbounded moments\nand a symmetric probability density function (PDF).

    "abstract": "Despite widespread adoption, the impact of AI tools on software development\nin the wild remains understudied. We conduct a randomized controlled trial\n(RCT) to understand how AI tools at the February-June 2025 frontier affect the\nproductivity of experienced open-source developers. 16 developers with moderate\nAI experience complete 246 tasks in mature projects on which they have an\naverage of 5 years of prior experience. Each task is randomly assigned to allow\nor disallow usage of early 2025 AI tools. When AI tools are allowed, developers\nprimarily use Cursor Pro, a popular code editor, and Claude 3.5/3.7 Sonnet.\nBefore starting tasks, developers forecast that allowing AI will reduce\ncompletion time by 24%. After completing the study, developers estimate that\nallowing AI reduced completion time by 20%. Surprisingly, we find that allowing\nAI actually increases completion time by 19%--AI tooling slowed developers\ndown. This slowdown also contradicts predictions from experts in economics (39%\nshorter) and ML (38% shorter). To understand this result, we collect and\nevaluate evidence for 20 properties of our setting that a priori could\ncontribute to the observed slowdown effect--for example, the size and quality\nstandards of projects, or prior developer experience with AI tooling. Although\nthe influence of experimental artifacts cannot be entirely ruled out, the\nrobustness of the slowdown effect across our analyses suggests it is unlikely\nto primarily be a function of our experimental design.",

    "abstract": "We present a general, constructive procedure to find the basis for tensors of\narbitrary order subject to linear constraints by transforming the problem to\nthat of finding the nullspace of a linear operator. The proposed method\nutilizes standard numerical linear algebra techniques that are highly optimized\nand well-behaved. Our primary applications are in mechanics where modulus\ntensors and so-called structure tensors can be used to characterize anisotropy\nof functional dependencies on other inputs such as strain. Like modulus\ntensors, structure tensors are defined by their invariance to transformations\nby symmetry group generators but have more general applicability. The fully\nautomated method is an alternative to classical, more intuition-reliant methods\nsuch as the Pipkin-Rivlin polynomial integrity basis construction. We\ndemonstrate the utility of the procedure by: (a) enumerating elastic modulus\ntensors for common symmetries, and (b) finding the lowest-order structure\ntensors that can represent all common point groups/crystal classes.\nFurthermore, we employ these results in two calibration problems using neural\nnetwork models following classical function representation theory: (a) learning\nthe symmetry class and orientation of a hyperelastic material given\nstress-strain data, and (b) representing strain-dependent anisotropy of the\nstress response of a soft matrix-stiff fiber composite in a sequence of\nuniaxial loadings. These two examples demonstrate the utility of the method in\nmodel selection and calibration by: (a) determining structural tensors of a\nselected order across multiple symmetry groups, and (b) determining a basis for\na given group that allows the characterization of all subgroups. Using a common\norder in both cases allows sparse regression to operate on a common function\nrepresentation to select the best-fit symmetry group for the data.",

    "abstract": "Achieving fast and stable off-policy learning in deep reinforcement learning\n(RL) is challenging. Most existing methods rely on semi-gradient\ntemporal-difference (TD) methods for their simplicity and efficiency, but are\nconsequently susceptible to divergence. While more principled approaches like\nGradient TD (GTD) methods have strong convergence guarantees, they have rarely\nbeen used in deep RL. Recent work introduced the Generalized Projected Bellman\nError ($\\GPBE$), enabling GTD methods to work efficiently with nonlinear\nfunction approximation. However, this work is only limited to one-step methods,\nwhich are slow at credit assignment and require a large number of samples. In\nthis paper, we extend the $\\GPBE$ objective to support multistep credit\nassignment based on the $\\lambda$-return and derive three gradient-based\nmethods that optimize this new objective. We provide both a forward-view\nformulation compatible with experience replay and a backward-view formulation\ncompatible with streaming algorithms. Finally, we evaluate the proposed\nalgorithms and show that they outperform both PPO and StreamQ in MuJoCo and\nMinAtar environments, respectively.

    "abstract": "We present a study of the effects of biofouling and sedimentation on\npathfinder instrumentation for the Pacific Ocean Neutrino Experiment (P-ONE),\nwhich will be located in the Cascadia Basin region of the North Pacific Ocean.\nP-ONE will look for high-energy neutrinos by observing the light produced when\nthese neutrinos interact in the water, detecting and digitizing single photon\nsignals in the ultraviolet-visible range. We measure that biofouling and\nsedimentation caused a decrease in the transparency of upward-facing optical\nsurfaces over 5 years of operations. A majority of downward-facing optical\nsurfaces, which will dominate P-ONE's sensitivity to astrophysical sources,\nshowed no visible biofouling. Extrapolations motivated by biological growth\nmodels estimated that these losses started around 2.5 years after deployment,\nand suggest a final equilibrium transparency ranging between 0$\\%$ and 35$\\%$\nof the original for the upward-facing modules.",

    "abstract": "We argue that the \"Little Red Dots\" (LRDs) discovered with the James Webb\nSpace Telescope are quasi-stars in their late stages of evolution. Quasi-stars\nare hypothetical objects predicted to form following the core collapse of\nsupermassive stars, and consist of black holes accreting from massive envelopes\nat a super-Eddington rate. We show that models of late-stage quasi-stars, with\nblack hole masses exceeding $\\sim 10\\%$ of the total, predict thermal and\nradiative properties that are insensitive to both black hole and envelope mass,\nand spectrally resemble LRDs. Specifically, we show that they are likely to\nexhibit reddish colors, a strong Balmer break, and possess conditions favorable\nto the production of Balmer lines that are broadened by electron scattering.\nTheir huge electron column densities suppress any X-rays. Late-stage\nquasi-stars, with black hole masses $\\gtrsim 10^6 M_\\odot$, should dominate the\noverall quasi-star population. Their short predicted lifetimes (tens of Myr),\ncoupled with the high observed comoving density of LRDs, suggest that most or\nall supermassive black holes go through a quasi-star/LRD phase during their\nformation and growth.",

    "abstract": "Flight delays are a significant challenge in the aviation industry, causing\nmajor financial and operational disruptions. To improve passenger experience\nand reduce revenue loss, flight delay prediction models must be both precise\nand generalizable across different networks. This paper introduces a novel\napproach that combines Queue-Theory with a simple attention model, referred to\nas the Queue-Theory SimAM (QT-SimAM). To validate our model, we used data from\nthe US Bureau of Transportation Statistics, where our proposed QT-SimAM\n(Bidirectional) model outperformed existing methods with an accuracy of 0.927\nand an F1 score of 0.932. To assess transferability, we tested the model on the\nEUROCONTROL dataset. The results demonstrated strong performance, achieving an\naccuracy of 0.826 and an F1 score of 0.791. Ultimately, this paper outlines an\neffective, end-to-end methodology for predicting flight delays. The proposed\nmodel's ability to forecast delays with high accuracy across different networks\ncan help reduce passenger anxiety and improve operational decision-making",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the behavior of simulated AI agents (large language\nmodels, or LLMs) in auctions, introducing a novel synthetic data-generating\nprocess to help facilitate the study and design of auctions. We find that LLMs\n-- when endowed with chain of thought reasoning capacity -- agree with the\nexperimental literature in auctions across a variety of classic auction\nformats. In particular, we find that LLM bidders produce results consistent\nwith risk-averse human bidders; that they perform closer to theoretical\npredictions in obviously strategy-proof auctions; and, that they succumb to the\nwinner's curse in common value settings. On prompting, we find that LLMs are\nnot very sensitive to naive changes in prompts (e.g., language, currency) but\ncan improve dramatically towards theoretical predictions with the right mental\nmodel (i.e., the language of Nash deviations). We run 1,000$+$ auctions for\nless than $\\$$400 with GPT-4 models (three orders of magnitude cheaper than\nmodern auction experiments) and develop a framework flexible enough to run\nauction experiments with any LLM model and a wide range of auction design\nspecifications, facilitating further experimental study by decreasing costs and\nserving as a proof-of-concept for the use of LLM proxies.",
