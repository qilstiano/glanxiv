Although existing\nmethods have shown promising results, they often struggle to capture complex\nhigh-order relationships and effectively adapt to diverse user behaviors,\nparticularly when addressing the cold-start issue. To address these challenges,\nwe propose Hypergraph-enhanced Meta-learning Adaptive Network (HyperMAN), a\nnovel framework that integrates heterogeneous hypergraph modeling with a\ndifficulty-aware meta-learning mechanism for next POI recommendation.\nSpecifically, three types of heterogeneous hyperedges are designed to capture\nhigh-order relationships: user visit behaviors at specific times (Temporal\nbehavioral hyperedge), spatial correlations among POIs (spatial functional\nhyperedge), and user long-term preferences (user preference hyperedge).\nFurthermore, a diversity-aware meta-learning mechanism is introduced to\ndynamically adjust learning strategies, considering users behavioral diversity.\nExtensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that HyperMAN achieves\nsuperior performance, effectively addressing cold start challenges and\nsignificantly enhancing recommendation accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) augmented with\nchain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning demonstrate impressive problem-solving\nabilities. However, in this work, we identify a recurring issue where these\nmodels occasionally generate overly short reasoning, leading to degraded\nperformance on even simple mathematical problems. Specifically, we investigate\nhow reasoning length is embedded in the hidden representations of reasoning\nmodels and its impact on accuracy. Our analysis reveals that reasoning length\nis governed by a linear direction in the representation space, allowing us to\ninduce overly short reasoning by steering the model along this direction.\nBuilding on this insight, we introduce \\textbf{\\textit{ThinkEdit}}, a simple\nyet effective weight-editing approach to mitigate the issue of overly short\nreasoning. We first identify a small subset of attention heads (approximately\n4%) that predominantly drive short reasoning behavior. We then edit the output\nprojection weights of these heads to remove the short reasoning direction. With\nchanges to only 0.2% of the model's parameters, \\textbf{\\textit{ThinkEdit}}\neffectively reduces overly short reasoning and yields notable accuracy gains\nfor short reasoning outputs (+6.39%), along with an overall improvement across\nmultiple math benchmarks (+3.34%).

    "abstract": "This paper discusses a framework to parametrize and decompose operator matrix\nelements for particles with higher spin $(j > 1/2)$ using chiral\nrepresentations of the Lorentz group, i.e. the $(j,0)$ and $(0,j)$\nrepresentations and their parity-invariant direct sum. Unlike traditional\napproaches that require imposing constraints to eliminate spurious degrees of\nfreedom, these chiral representations contain exactly the $2j+1$ components\nneeded to describe a spin-$j$ particle. The central objects in the construction\nare the $t$-tensors, which are generalizations of the Pauli four-vector\n$\\sigma^\\mu$ for higher spin. For the generalized spinors of these\nrepresentations, we demonstrate how the algebra of the $t$-tensors allows to\nformulate a generalization of the Dirac matrix basis for any spin. For on-shell\nbilinears, we show that a set consisting exclusively of covariant multipoles of\norder $0\\leq m \\leq 2j$ forms a complete basis. We provide explicit expressions\nfor all bilinears of the generalized Dirac matrix basis, which are valid for\nany spin value. As a byproduct of our derivations we present an efficient\nalgorithm to compute the $t$-tensor matrix elements.

This method minimizes the accuracy trade-off\ntypically associated with parameter compression, allowing CIMPool to achieve a\nsignificantly larger compression ratio compared to the traditional quantization\nmethod with iso-accuracy.\n  Furthermore, CIMPool co-optimizes the compression algorithm, hardware, and\ndataflow to efficiently implement the hardware permutation required by weight\npool compression, with negligible area and throughput overhead.

    "abstract": "Tomography is a powerful technique for recovering the three-dimensional (3D)\ndensity structure of the global solar corona. In this work, we present an\nimproved tomography method by introducing radial weighting in the\nregularization term. Radial weighting provides balanced smoothing of density\nvalues across different heights, helping to recover finer structures at lower\nheights while also stabilizing the solution and preventing oscillatory\nartifacts at higher altitudes. We apply this technique to reconstruct the 3D\nelectron density of Carrington Rotation (CR) 2098 using two weeks of polarized\nbrightness (pB) observations from the inner coronagraph (COR1) onboard\nspacecraft-B of the twin Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO),\nwhere the radial weighting function is taken as the inverse intensity\nbackground, calculated by averaging all the pB images used. Comparisons between\ndensity distributions at various heights from the tomography and\nmagnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations show good agreement. We find that radial\nweighting not only effectively corrects the over-smoothing effect near the\ninner boundary in reconstructions using second-order smoothing but also\nsignificantly improves reconstruction quality when using zeroth-order\nsmoothing. Additionally, comparing reconstructions for CR 2091 from\nsingle-satellite data with that from multi-viewpoint data suggests that coronal\nevolution and dynamics may have a significant impact on the reconstructed\ndensity structures. This improved tomography method has been used to create a\ndatabase of 3D densities for CRs 2052 to 2154, based on STEREO/COR1-B data,\ncovering the period from 08 January 2007 to 17 September 2014.",

Rather than treating countability as an absolute cardinal\nnotion, we redefine it as a stratified, process-relative closure over definable\nsubsets, generated by a sequence of conservative extensions to a base formal\nsystem. This yields a structured, internally growing hierarchy of constructive\ndefinability that remains within the countable realm but approximates the\nexpressive richness of the continuum. We compare fractally countable sets to\nclassical countability and the hyperarithmetical hierarchy, and interpret the\ncontinuum not as a completed object, but as a layered definitional horizon.\nThis framework provides a constructive reinterpretation of power set-like\noperations without invoking non-effective principles.",

Subsequently, we pre-train ObscuraCoder models,\nranging in size from 255M to 2.8B parameters, on a 272B-token corpus that\nincludes ObscuraX and demonstrate that our obfuscation-based pre-training\nrecipe leads to consistent improvements in Code-LMs' abilities compared to both\nvanilla autoregressive pre-training as well as existing de-obfuscation (DOBF)\nobjectives. ObscuraCoder demonstrates sizeable gains across multiple tests of\nsyntactic and semantic code understanding, along with improved capabilities in\nmultilingual code completion, multilingual code commit summarization, and\nmulti-purpose library-oriented code generation.",

    "abstract": "The rise of Network Function Virtualization (NFV) has transformed network\ninfrastructures by replacing fixed hardware with software-based Virtualized\nNetwork Functions (VNFs), enabling greater agility, scalability, and cost\nefficiency. Virtualization increases the distribution of system components and\nintroduces stronger interdependencies. As a result, failures become harder to\npredict, monitor, and manage compared to traditional monolithic networks.\nReliability, i.e. the ability of a system to perform regularly under specified\nconditions, and availability, i.e. the probability of a system of being ready\nto use, are critical requirements that must be guaranteed to maintain seamless\nnetwork operations. Accurate modeling of these aspects is crucial for designing\nrobust, fault-tolerant virtualized systems that can withstand service\ndisruptions. This survey focuses on reliability and availability attributes of\nvirtualized networks from a modeling perspective. After introducing the NFV\narchitecture and basic definitions, we discuss the standardization efforts of\nthe European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), which provides\nguidelines and recommendations through a series of standard documents focusing\non reliability and availability. Next, we explore several formalisms proposed\nin the literature for characterizing reliability and availability, with a focus\non their application to modeling the failure and repair behavior of virtualized\nnetworks through practical examples. Then, we overview numerous references\ndemonstrating how different authors adopt specific methods to characterize\nreliability and/or availability of virtualized systems. Moreover, we present a\nselection of the most valuable software tools that support modeling of reliable\nvirtualized networks. Finally, we discuss a set of open problems with the aim\nto encourage readers to explore further advances in this field.",

In this paper, we\nexperimentally measured the pressure broadening of methane in a\nhigh-temperature hydrogen-helium background atmosphere in the H band, which had\nnot been previously measured. The experiment used glass cells, inserted in a\ntube furnace, filled with methane in a hydrogen-helium background atmosphere or\npure methane gas.

A full Bayesian\nanalysis was performed on the obtained spectra, using the differentiable\nspectral model ExoJAX and the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo for inferring a large\nnumber of parameters, allowing us to infer the H2/He pressure broadening for 22\ntransitions mainly in the R-branch of the 2$\\nu_3$ band. As a result, we found\na temperature exponent of approximately 0.27 and a reference width at 296 K of\naround 0.040 for $ J_{lower} $ = 13-20.

This enables a detailed study of\nthe thermal transport and development of velocity transformations and Reynolds\nanalogies for compressible turbulent flows in swept-like conditions. Extensions\nof velocity transformations to three-dimensional flows demonstrate near-wall\nself-similarity of the velocity, providing evidence for Morkovin's hypothesis\nin nonequilibrium conditions.

Cybersickness\nis marked by symptoms such as dizziness and nausea, which previous work\nprimarily assessed via subjective post-immersion questionnaires and\nmotion-restricted controlled setups. In this paper, we investigate the\n\\emph{dynamic nature} of cybersickness while users experience and freely\ninteract in VR. We propose a novel method to \\emph{continuously} identify and\nquantitatively gauge cybersickness levels from users' \\emph{passively\nmonitored} electroencephalography (EEG) and head motion signals. Our method\nestimates multitaper spectrums from EEG, integrating specialized EEG processing\ntechniques to counter motion artifacts, and, thus, tracks cybersickness levels\nin real-time. Unlike previous approaches, our method requires no user-specific\ncalibration or personalization for detecting cybersickness. Our work addresses\nthe considerable challenge of reproducibility and subjectivity in cybersickness\nresearch.",

Owing to the unique properties of the microscope, our results imply that\nthe evolution of deformation fields can now be imaged non-destructively, in\nsitu, and within deeply embedded crystalline elements. The derived regression\nframework and sampling scheme operate under the kinematic diffraction\napproximation and are well-suited for studying microstructure evolution during\nplastic deformation. We derive the deformation conditions under which\ndiffraction vectors extracted from DFXM images can be uniquely associated to\nthe deformation gradient tensor field of the sample. The analysis concludes\nthat the deformation gradient tensor field must vary linearly over line\nsegments defined by the X-ray beam width and the diffracted ray path. The\nproposed algorithms are validated against numerical simulations for realistic\nnoise levels. Reconstructions of a simulated single straight-edge dislocation\nshow that the Burgers vector components can be recovered with an error of <2%.\nThe mean absolute error of the reconstructed elastic distortion field was found\nto be <10^-6. By taking the curl of the elastic distortion field, local\ndislocation densities are derived, yielding a reconstructed dislocation core\nposition with sub-pixel accuracy. The significance of directly measuring the\nelastic distortion and the dislocation density tensor fields is discussed in\nthe context of continuum theory of dislocations. Such measurements can also be\ninterfaced with continuum dislocation dynamics by providing data that can guide\nthe development and validation, thus extending the relevant models to finite\nstrain regimes.",

While DRAM offers low latency and\nhigh throughput, it is constrained by high costs, scalability challenges, and\nvolatility, making it less viable for capacity-bound and persistent\napplications in modern datacenters.\n  Recently, Compute Express Link (CXL) has emerged as a promising alternative,\nenabling high-speed, cacheline-granular communication between CPUs and external\ndevices. By leveraging CXL technology, NAND flash can now be used as memory\nexpansion, offering three-fold benefits: byte-addressability, scalable\ncapacity, and persistence at a low cost. Samsung's CXL Memory Module Hybrid\n(CMM-H) is the first product to deliver these benefits through a hardware-only\nsolution, i.e., it does not incur any OS and IO overheads like conventional\nblock devices. In particular, CMM-H integrates a DRAM cache with NAND flash in\na single device to deliver near-DRAM latency. This paper presents the first\npublicly available study for comprehensive characterizations of an FPGA-based\nCMM-H prototype. Through this study, we address users' concerns about whether a\nwide variety of applications can successfully run on a memory device backed by\nNAND flash medium.

In this work, we focus on\ndetermining the extent to which network structures derived from the spatial\ntessellations of hyperuniform point patterns inherit the hyperuniformity of the\nprogenitor point patterns. In particular, we examine the Delaunay, Voronoi,\nDelaunay-Centroidal, and Gabriel tessellations of nonhyperuniform and\nhyperuniform point patterns in two- and three-dimensional Euclidean space. We\nuse the spectral density to characterize the density fluctuations of two-phase\nmedia created by thickening the edges of these tessellations in two dimensions\nand introduce a novel variance-based metric to characterize the network\nstructures directly in two and three dimensions.

Superconductivity, for example, enables\ndissipationless transport through macroscopic phase twisting. Similarly, in\ncharge-density waves, once the phase degree of freedom-representing the\ncollective position of electrons relative to the lattice-is depinned, it\ngenerates characteristic broadband noise and intriguing AC-DC interference\npatterns. In this work, we point out a phase-coherent dynamics in the\nintervalley coherent (IVC) state, also known as the bond-ordered or Kekul\\'e\ndistorted state, frequently reported in rhombohedral multilayer graphene. Under\na static magnetic field, the IVC state responds with an oscillating intervalley\ncurrent, which in turn causes oscillating orbital magnetization, thereby\ninducing a detectable AC Hall effect. This mechanism mirrors the AC Josephson\neffect observed in superconductors but now happening in momentum space. In this\nanalogy, the static magnetic field acts as the DC voltage, while the\noscillating intervalley current assumes the role of the AC Josephson current.\nWe present detailed microscopic calculations for all the parameters of the\nphase-number free-energy in rhombohedral trilayer graphene, predicting an\norbital magnetization oscillation frequency of approximately 12 GHz at 0.1\nTesla.

Here, we\npresent the first direct experimental and theoretical demonstration of large\nintrinsic quantum flexoelectricity in graphene nanowrinkles, exhibiting\npolarization densities (P_{th} ~ 4 C/m^{2}, P_{exp} ~ 1 C/m^{2}) that exceed\nthose of mesoscale systems by 5 to 7 orders of magnitude.

We find that such\nsystems can undergo a long-lasting, stable mass-transfer phase, even if none of\nthe angular momentum of the transferred material returns to the orbit to\ncounterbalance the GW-driven decay. We show an example where a 2 Msun subgiant\nis stripped before entering the LISA band and loses almost its entire hydrogen\nenvelope. The remaining helium core undergoes a prolonged GW-driven inspiral,\nbecoming a loud LISA source. If formed in our galaxy, the system would be\ndetectable for several hundred thousand years, ultimately reaching extreme\nsignal-to-noise ratios of a million. Hydrogen shell flashes in the residual\nenvelope cause temporary radial expansions of the stripped star. As a result, a\nfew additional phases of rapid mass transfer occur at orbital periods of 20 -\n30 hours. Eventually, the core possibly undergoes circular partial tidal\ndisruption at an orbital period of ~10 minutes, corresponding to a GW emission\nfrequency of a few mHz. We estimate a chance of about 1% that such a detectable\nLISA source exists in our own galactic center.

We then fitted Ca 8662 with a relativistic\nelliptical line-emitting disk model. The line profiles are double-peaked with a\nFWHM of approx. 3700 km/s and exhibit a redward asymmetry with a red-to-blue\npeak ratio of 4:3. The Ca II triplet lines have an intensity ratio of 1:1:1 and\nshow no evidence of a central narrow or intermediate-width component. The\nprofiles of Ca II and O I are remarkably similar, suggesting a common region of\norigin. Given the 1:1:1 ratio of the Ca II triplet, this region is likely a\nhigh-density emission zone, and the Ca II 8662 profile is well described by a\nmildly eccentric, low-inclination relativistic disk with minimal internal\nturbulence.

Spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking is automatically fulfilled by\nsupersymmetric Light-Front QCD. The light-front holographic approach (HLFQCD)\nalso predicts the behavior of the QCD running coupling and other observables\nfrom the nonperturbative color-confining domain to the perturbative domain. One\ncan determine the QCD running coupling to high precision from the data of just\na single experiment over the entire perturbative regime by using the Principle\nof Maximum Conformality (PMC). The PMC, which generalizes the conventional\nGell-Mann-Low method for scale-setting in perturbative QED to non-Abelian QCD,\nprovides a rigorous method for achieving unambiguous scheme-independent,\nfixed-order Standard Model predictions, consistent with the principles of the\nrenormalization group.

However, the effect of\nmedication state on AI model learning and generalization remains poorly\nunderstood, potentially limiting EEG-based AI models clinical applicability.\nThis study evaluates how medication state influences the training and\ngeneralization of EEG-based AI models. Paired EEG recordings were utilized from\nindividuals with PD in both ON- and OFF-medication states. AI models were\ntrained on recordings from each state separately and evaluated on independent\ntest sets representing both ON- and OFF-medication conditions. Model\nperformance was assessed using multiple metrics, with accuracy (ACC) as the\nprimary outcome. Statistical significance was assessed via permutation testing\n(p-values<0.05). Our results reveal that models trained on OFF-medication data\nexhibited consistent but suboptimal performance across both medication states\n(ACC_OFF-ON=55.3\\pm8.8 and ACC_OFF-OFF=56.2\\pm8.7). In contrast, models trained\non ON-medication data demonstrated significantly higher performance on\nON-medication recordings (ACC_ON-ON=80.7\\pm7.1) but significantly reduced\ngeneralization to OFF-medication data (ACC_ON-OFF=76.0\\pm7.2).

Our findings suggest that medication state\nsignificantly influences the patterns learned by AI models. Addressing this\nchallenge is essential to enhance the robustness and clinical utility of AI\nmodels for PD characterization and management.",

    "abstract": "Agricultural imaging often requires individual images to be stitched together\ninto a final mosaic for analysis. However, agricultural images can be\nparticularly challenging to stitch because feature matching across images is\ndifficult due to repeated textures, plants are non-planar, and mosaics built\nfrom many images can accumulate errors that cause drift. Although these issues\ncan be mitigated by using georeferenced images or taking images at high\naltitude, there is no general solution for images taken close to the crop. To\naddress this, we created a user-friendly and open source pipeline for stitching\nground-based images of a linear row of crops that does not rely on additional\ndata. First, we use SuperPoint and LightGlue to extract and match features\nwithin small batches of images. Then we stitch the images in each batch in\nseries while imposing constraints on the camera movement. After straightening\nand rescaling each batch mosaic, all batch mosaics are stitched together in\nseries and then straightened into a final mosaic. We tested the pipeline on\nimages collected along 72 m long rows of crops using two different agricultural\nrobots and a camera manually carried over the row. In all three cases, the\npipeline produced high-quality mosaics that could be used to georeference real\nworld positions with a mean absolute error of 20 cm. This approach provides\naccessible leaf-scale stitching to users who need to coarsely georeference\npositions within a row, but do not have access to accurate positional data or\nsophisticated imaging systems.",

While the state-of-the-art safe RL approaches mitigate risks\nthrough safe exploration or high-level recovery mechanisms, they often overlook\nlow-level execution safety, where reflexive responses to potential hazards are\ncrucial. Similarly, variable impedance control (VIC) enhances safety by\nadjusting the robot's mechanical response, yet lacks a systematic way to adapt\nparameters, such as stiffness and damping throughout the task. In this paper,\nwe propose Bresa, a Bio-inspired Reflexive Hierarchical Safe RL method inspired\nby biological reflexes. Our method decouples task learning from safety\nlearning, incorporating a safety critic network that evaluates action risks and\noperates at a higher frequency than the task solver. Unlike existing\nrecovery-based methods, our safety critic functions at a low-level control\nlayer, allowing real-time intervention when unsafe conditions arise. The\ntask-solving RL policy, running at a lower frequency, focuses on high-level\nplanning (decision-making), while the safety critic ensures instantaneous\nsafety corrections. We validate Bresa on multiple tasks including a\ncontact-rich robotic task, demonstrating its reflexive ability to enhance\nsafety, and adaptability in unforeseen dynamic environments. Our results show\nthat Bresa outperforms the baseline, providing a robust and reflexive safety\nmechanism that bridges the gap between high-level planning and low-level\nexecution.

However, equivariant networks cannot break symmetries: the\noutput of an equivariant network must, by definition, have at least the same\nself-symmetries as the input. This poses an important problem, both (1) for\nprediction tasks on domains where self-symmetries are common, and (2) for\ngenerative models, which must break symmetries in order to reconstruct from\nhighly symmetric latent spaces. This fundamental limitation can be addressed by\nconsidering equivariant conditional distributions, instead of equivariant\nfunctions. We present novel theoretical results that establish necessary and\nsufficient conditions for representing such distributions. Concretely, this\nrepresentation provides a practical framework for breaking symmetries in any\nequivariant network via randomized canonicalization. Our method, SymPE\n(Symmetry-breaking Positional Encodings), admits a simple interpretation in\nterms of positional encodings. This approach expands the representational power\nof equivariant networks while retaining the inductive bias of symmetry, which\nwe justify through generalization bounds.

The resulting algorithm\nmaintains feasibility with respect to the manifold structure while enabling\nexploration beyond local neighborhoods.

In a\nstandard experiment using, for example, a synchrotron light source, shake-up\nstates are populated incoherently and their relative excitation intensities\ndescribe the process completely. In this work, we use high-accuracy ab initio\ntheoretical methods to show that the physics of shake-up differs qualitatively\nwhen ionisation is achieved with an attosecond pulse such as those produced by\nfree-electron laser or high-harmonic generation sources. These coherent light\nsources possess sufficient bandwidth to enable the new phenomenon of coherent\nshake-up, a process whose result cannot be described solely by the shake-up\nstate populations. We show theoretically that the ensuing coherent\nmany-electron wavepackets exhibit attosecond quantum beats in the form of a\nradial expansion and contraction of the electron density which we term\n\"breathing ions\". We predict that such attosecond oscillatory dynamics will\npersist for as long as nanoseconds before being damped by radiative decay.

The key technical innovation is its LLM-based regression\nmodel, which uniquely integrates a large language model (LLM) with a\nmixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture composed of multilayer perceptrons\n(MLPs). The LLM interprets the input HDL code and then utilizes its final\nhidden-layer representations to predict PPA metrics.

Experimental\nresults on the VerilogEval benchmark demonstrate that RocketPPA achieves\nsignificant improvements in the accuracy of PPA estimation compared to previous\nstate-of-the-art methods like Llama3-MetRex-8B. Specifically, at a 10% relative\nerror threshold, RocketPPA enhances the pass rate for area prediction by 13.6%,\ndelay by 9.4%, and power by 14.7%. At a 20% threshold, the improvements are\n9.6% for area, 10.8% for delay, and 18.5% for power.

However, deploying SSMs to\nedge devices is challenging due to the constraints in memory, computing\ncapacity, and power consumption, underscoring the need for efficient\ncompression strategies. While low-bit quantization is an efficient model\ncompression strategy for reducing size and accelerating IR tasks, SSM suffers\nsubstantial performance drops at ultra-low bit-widths (2-4 bits), primarily due\nto outliers that exacerbate quantization error. To address this challenge, we\npropose Q-MambaIR, an accurate, efficient, and flexible Quantized Mamba for IR\ntasks. Specifically, we introduce a Statistical Dynamic-balancing Learnable\nScalar (DLS) to dynamically adjust the quantization mapping range, thereby\nmitigating the peak truncation loss caused by extreme values. Furthermore, we\ndesign a Range-floating Flexible Allocator (RFA) with an adaptive threshold to\nflexibly round values. This approach preserves high-frequency details and\nmaintains the SSM's feature extraction capability. Notably, RFA also enables\npre-deployment weight quantization, striking a balance between computational\nefficiency and model accuracy. Extensive experiments on IR tasks demonstrate\nthat Q-MambaIR consistently outperforms existing quantized SSMs, achieving much\nhigher state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy results with only a negligible increase\nin training computation and storage saving.",

Most of these studies use deep learning-based\nmodels to directly forecast a solar irradiance or photovoltaic power value\ngiven an input of sky image sequences. Recently, however, advances in\ngenerative modeling have led to approaches that divide the forecasting problem\ninto two sub-problems: 1) future event prediction, i.e. generating future sky\nimages; and 2) solar irradiance or photovoltaic power nowcasting, i.e.\npredicting the concurrent value from a single image. One such approach is the\nSkyGPT model, where they show that the potential for improvement is much larger\nfor the nowcasting model than for the generative model. Thus, in this paper, we\nfocus on the solar irradiance nowcasting problem and conduct an extensive\nbenchmark of deep learning architectures across the widely-used Folsom, SIRTA\nand NREL datasets.

To this end, we\npropose and analyze a novel compartment-based transmission model that\nintegrates phytoplankton-zooplankton interactions into a human-bacteria cholera\nmodel.

Its structural, electronic, and lithium/sodium\nstorage properties were comprehensively investigated. PLG exhibits a high\ntheoretical capacity of 1004 mAh/g for Li, Na, and mixed Li/Na ions, surpassing\nconventional graphite anodes. The material remains metallic, with multiple band\ncrossings at the Fermi level. The optimal energy barriers for Li (0.28 eV) and\nNa (0.25 eV) on PLG and favorable diffusion coefficients in both monolayer and\nmultilayer configurations are unveiled. The open circuit voltages are 0.47 V\nfor Li, 0.51 V for Na, and 0.54 V for mixed-ion storage, suggesting stable\nelectrochemical performance. These results highlight PLG as a promising\ncandidate for next-generation lithium and sodium-ion batteries, combining high\nstorage capacity and efficient ion transport.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a NeRF-based framework for point cloud (PCD)\nreconstruction, specifically designed for indoor high-throughput plant\nphenotyping facilities. Traditional NeRF-based reconstruction methods require\ncameras to move around stationary objects, but this approach is impractical for\nhigh-throughput environments where objects are rapidly imaged while moving on\nconveyors or rotating pedestals. To address this limitation, we develop a\nvariant of NeRF-based PCD reconstruction that uses a single stationary camera\nto capture images as the object rotates on a pedestal. Our workflow comprises\nCOLMAP-based pose estimation, a straightforward pose transformation to simulate\ncamera movement, and subsequent standard NeRF training. A defined Region of\nInterest (ROI) excludes irrelevant scene data, enabling the generation of\nhigh-resolution point clouds (10M points). Experimental results demonstrate\nexcellent reconstruction fidelity, with precision-recall analyses yielding an\nF-score close to 100.00 across all evaluated plant objects. Although pose\nestimation remains computationally intensive with a stationary camera setup,\noverall training and reconstruction times are competitive, validating the\nmethod's feasibility for practical high-throughput indoor phenotyping\napplications. Our findings indicate that high-quality NeRF-based 3D\nreconstructions are achievable using a stationary camera, eliminating the need\nfor complex camera motion or costly imaging equipment. This approach is\nespecially beneficial when employing expensive and delicate instruments, such\nas hyperspectral cameras, for 3D plant phenotyping. Future work will focus on\noptimizing pose estimation techniques and further streamlining the methodology\nto facilitate seamless integration into automated, high-throughput 3D\nphenotyping pipelines.",

Experimentally, material properties\nare commonly probed through scattering measurements, which also provide access\nto static and dynamic structure factors. However, it is not trivial to decode\nthese due to complex interactions between atomic motion and the probe.\nAtomistic simulations can help bridge this gap, allowing for detailed\nunderstanding of the underlying dynamics. In this paper, we illustrate how\ncorrelation functions provide structural and dynamical insights from simulation\nand showcase the strong agreement with experiment. To compute the correlation\nfunctions, we have updated the Python package dynasor with a new interface and,\nimportantly, added support for weighting the computed quantities with form\nfactors or cross sections, facilitating direct comparison with probe-specific\nstructure factors. Additionally, we have incorporated the spectral energy\ndensity method, which offers an alternative view of the dispersion for\ncrystalline systems, as well as functionality to project atomic dynamics onto\nphonon modes, enabling detailed analysis of specific phonon modes from\natomistic simulation. We illustrate the capabilities of dynasor with diverse\nexamples, ranging from liquid Ni3Al to perovskites, and compare computed\nresults with X-ray, electron and neutron scattering experiments.

    "abstract": "Reward functions are central in reinforcement learning (RL), guiding agents\ntowards optimal decision-making. The complexity of RL tasks requires\nmeticulously designed reward functions that effectively drive learning while\navoiding unintended consequences. Effective reward design aims to provide\nsignals that accelerate the agent's convergence to optimal behavior. Crafting\nrewards that align with task objectives, foster desired behaviors, and prevent\nundesirable actions is inherently challenging. This thesis delves into the\ncritical role of reward signals in RL, highlighting their impact on the agent's\nbehavior and learning dynamics and addressing challenges such as delayed,\nambiguous, or intricate rewards. In this thesis work, we tackle different\naspects of reward shaping. First, we address the problem of designing\ninformative and interpretable reward signals from a teacher's/expert's\nperspective (teacher-driven). Here, the expert, equipped with the optimal\npolicy and the corresponding value function, designs reward signals that\nexpedite the agent's convergence to optimal behavior. Second, we build on this\nteacher-driven approach by introducing a novel method for adaptive\ninterpretable reward design. In this scenario, the expert tailors the rewards\nbased on the learner's current policy, ensuring alignment and optimal\nprogression. Third, we propose a meta-learning approach, enabling the agent to\nself-design its reward signals online without expert input (agent-driven). This\nself-driven method considers the agent's learning and exploration to establish\na self-improving feedback loop.",

Thus,\nit is challenging to adopt security practices and activities in modern\ndevelopment practices. Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) is a\nsecurity practice within software development frameworks that bolsters system\nsecurity. This study delves into the intersection of Agile development and\nDAST, exploring how a software organization attempted to integrate DAST into\ntheir Kanban workflows and CI/CD pipelines to identify and mitigate security\nvulnerabilities within the development process. Through an action research case\nstudy incorporating interviews among team members, this research elucidates the\nchallenges, mitigation techniques, and best practices associated with\nincorporating DAST into Agile methodologies from developers' perspectives.

A particular example is the antiferromagnet Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ containing\n$d^4$ Ru$^{4+}$ ions. Here the spin-orbit interaction stabilizes the\nnon-magnetic $J=0$ singlet ionic ground state, which gets dynamically mixed -\nvia exchange interactions - with low-energy $J=1$ ionic excitations. Thanks to\na sufficient strength of the exchange, these excitations condense and a\nlong-range order emerges. The resulting ordered moments are soft and prone to\nfluctuations of their effective length. The corresponding amplitude mode\nappears as a prominent magnetic excitation and complements the conventional\nmagnons involving rotations of the moments. Motivated by this peculiar kind of\nmagnetic order and the specific spectrum of magnetic excitations, we study\ntheir influence on the propagation of doped carriers. To this end, we construct\na microscopic model including both $d^4$ and $d^5$ degrees of freedom and\naddress the propagation of an injected electron by employing self-consistent\nBorn approximation. We find that the electron shows a combination of both free\nand a polaronic type of motion, where the mobile carrier strongly interacts\nwith an accompanying cloud of magnetic excitations. Remarkably, in the latter\ncase it is the exotic excitation - the amplitude mode - that is found to\ndominate over the contribution of magnons. Our soft-spin situation thus largely\ncontrasts with spin polarons widely discussed in the context of doped\nHeisenberg-like magnets based on rigid spin moments.",

    "abstract": "Deep generative models such as flow and diffusion models have proven to be\neffective in modeling high-dimensional and complex data types such as videos or\nproteins, and this has motivated their use in different data modalities, such\nas neural network weights. A generative model of neural network weights would\nbe useful for a diverse set of applications, such as Bayesian deep learning,\nlearned optimization, and transfer learning. However, the existing work on\nweight-space generative models often ignores the symmetries of neural network\nweights, or only takes into account a subset of them. Modeling those\nsymmetries, such as permutation symmetries between subsequent layers in an MLP,\nthe filters in a convolutional network, or scaling symmetries arising with the\nuse of non-linear activations, holds the potential to make weight-space\ngenerative modeling more efficient by effectively reducing the dimensionality\nof the problem.\n  In this light, we aim to design generative models in weight-space that more\ncomprehensively respect the symmetries of neural network weights. We build on\nrecent work on generative modeling with flow matching, and weight-space graph\nneural networks to design three different weight-space flows. Each of our flows\ntakes a different approach to modeling the geometry of neural network weights,\nand thus allows us to explore the design space of weight-space flows in a\nprincipled way. Our results confirm that modeling the geometry of neural\nnetworks more faithfully leads to more effective flow models that can\ngeneralize to different tasks and architectures, and we show that while our\nflows obtain competitive performance with orders of magnitude fewer parameters\nthan previous work, they can be further improved by scaling them up.

    "abstract": "Early B-type stars ($M_i=8-15$ M$_\\odot$) are frequently in multiple systems,\nas evidenced by spectroscopic campaigns in the Milky Way (MW) and the Large\nMagellanic Cloud (LMC). Previous studies have shown no strong metallicity\ndependence in the close-binary (a>10 au) fraction or orbital-period\ndistributions between the MW's solar metallicity (Z$_\\odot$) and that of the\nLMC (Z=0.5 Z$_\\odot$). However, similar analyses in more metal-poor\nenvironments are still scarce. We focus on 309 early B-type stars (luminosity\nclasses III-V) from the Binarity at LOw Metallicity campaign in the Small\nMagellanic Cloud (SMC, Z=0.2 Z$_\\odot$) using VLT/FLAMES multi-epoch\nspectroscopy. By applying binary detection criteria consistent with previous\nworks, we identify 153 stars (91 SB1, 59 SB2, 3 SB3) exhibiting significant\nradial-velocity (RV) variations, resulting in an observed multiplicity fraction\nof $f^{obs}_{mult}=50\\pm3\\%$. Using Monte Carlo simulations to account for\nobservational biases, we infer an intrinsic close-binary fraction of\n$f_{mult}=80\\pm8\\%$. A Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis of the peak-to-peak RV\ndistribution ($\\Delta{\\rm RV}_{\\rm max}$) confirms a high multiplicity fraction\nof $f_{mult}=78\\pm5\\%$. These findings suggest a possible anti-correlation\nbetween metallicity and the fraction of close B-type binaries, with the SMC\nmultiplicity fraction significantly exceeding previous measurements in the LMC\nand MW. The enhanced fraction of close binaries at SMC's low metallicity may\nhave broad implications for massive-star evolution in the early Universe. More\nfrequent mass transfer and envelope stripping could boost the production of\nexotic transients, stripped supernovae, gravitational-wave progenitors, and\nsustained UV ionising flux, potentially affecting cosmic reionisation.\nTheoretical predictions of binary evolution under metal-poor conditions will\nprovide a key test of our results.",

In addition to the previously derived divergence\nand correlator forms of the exact relations, a Banerjee-Galtier type\ndivergence-free form of the exact relation is derived under the explicit\nassumption of homogeneity. By performing three-dimensional direct numerical\nsimulations with up to $1024^3$ grid points, we show that the sum of the\nkinetic and active energy associates a Kolmogorov-like universal cascade with\nconstant flux rate across inertial scales. Despite term-by-term deviations, the\ncascade rates computed from all three exact laws show excellent agreement,\nthereby confirming the equivalence of different exact relations and hence the\nfeasibility of determining the net cascade rate from any of the three\nformulations. Notably, the two dominant flux rates of the divergence form are\nfound to cross each other roughly at the domain size, which also serves as an\ninfrared cut-off for the inverse cascade of the small scale active energy.

Here, we investigate how these structures (hence\nthe dust torque) change when the effect of turbulent dust diffusion and dust\nfeedback are included, and the direct implications on the migration of\nEarth-like planets. Using the \\textsc{Fargo3D} code, we perform 2D and 3D\nmultifluid hydrodynamic simulations, focusing on a non-migrating planet with\nthe mass $M_p=1.5\\,M_\\oplus$ in 2D and on migrating planets with\n$M_p\\in[1.5,12]\\,M_\\oplus$ in 3D. We vary the $\\delta$-dimensionless\ndiffusivity parameter in the range $[0,3\\times10^{-3}]$ and consider three\ndifferent Stokes numbers $\\mathrm{St}=\\{0.04,0.26,0.55\\}$, which are\nrepresentative of the gas, transitional and gravity-dominated regimes,\nrespectively. In our 2D models, we find that turbulent diffusion of dust\nprevents the formation of the dust-void and filamentary structures when\n$\\delta>3\\times10^{-4}$. Otherwise, dust structures survive turbulent diffusion\nflow. However, dust and total torques become positive only in transitional and\ngravity-dominated regimes. In our 3D models, we find that the dust-void is\ndrastically modified and the high-density ring-shaped barrier delineating the\ndust-void disappears if $\\delta\\gtrsim10^{-4} $, due to the effect of dust\nturbulent diffusion along with the back-reaction of the dust. For all values of\n$\\delta$, the filament in front of the planet is replaced by a low-density\ntrench. Remarkably, as we allow the planets to migrate, the evolving dust-void\ncan drive either runaway migration or outward (inward) oscillatory-torque\nmigration. Our study thus suggests that low-mass Earth-like planets can undergo\nrunaway migration in dusty disks.",

We trace the properties of the\nmulti-phase medium, from cold and warm molecular gas to hot ionised gas, using\nemission lines such as CO(2-1), H2 S(1), [OIII]5007, [NeIII]15, and [NeV]14.\nThese lines reveal the intricate interplay between the different gas phases\nwithin the circumnuclear region, spanning approximately 1.4x1.4 kpc^2, with a\nresolution of 10 pc. Exploiting the multi-wavelength and multi-scale\nobservations of gas emission we model the galaxy disc rotation curve from\nscales of a few parsec up to 5 kpc from the nucleus and infer a dynamical mass\nof 1.09\\pm0.08x10^10 M_{\\odot} with a disc scale radius of 0.48\\pm0.02 kpc. We\ndetect a compact ionised outflow with velocities up to 10^3 km/s, traced by the\n[OIII], [NeIII], and [NeV] transitions, with no evidence of cold or warm\nmolecular outflows. We suggest that the ionised outflow might be able to inject\na significant amount of energy into the circumnuclear region, potentially\nhindering the formation of a molecular wind, as the molecular gas is observed\nto be denser and less diffuse. The combined multi-band observations also\nreveal, in all gas phases, a strong enhancement of the gas velocity dispersion\ndirected along the galaxy minor axis, perpendicular to the high-velocity\nionised outflow, and extending up to 1 kpc from the nucleus. Our findings\nsuggest that the outflow might play a key role in such enhancement by injecting\nenergy into the host disc and perturbing the ambient material.",

In this study, we develop a global goodness-of-fit test to\nassess parametric covariance structures in multivariate sparse functional data.\nOur contribution is twofold. First, we extend the univariate goodness-of-fit\ntest proposed by Chen et al.

These corrections ensure appropriate Type I\nerror control under sparse designs. Second, we introduce a multivariate\nextension of the improved test that jointly evaluates covariance structures\nacross multiple outcomes, employing novel test statistics based on the maximum\nand $\\ell_2$ norms to account for inter-outcome dependencies and enhance\nstatistical power. Through extensive simulation studies, we demonstrate that\nthe proposed methods maintain proper Type I error rates and achieve greater\npower than univariate tests with multiple testing adjustments. Applications to\nlongitudinal neuroimaging and clinical data from the Alzheimer's Disease\nNeuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and the Parkinson's Progression Marker\nInitiative (PPMI) illustrate the practical utility of the proposed methods for\nevaluating covariance structures in sparse multivariate longitudinal data.",

Analyzing the\ncareer trajectories of 32,977 tenure-track faculty members who earned their\nPh.D. degrees after 2005 and their initial faculty placement at 355 U.S.\nuniversities, we find that faculty newly hired by top-ranked universities tend\nto be less interdisciplinary in their Ph.D. research, particularly when they\nobtained Ph.D. from top universities and remain in their Ph.D. research field.\nExploring the underlying reasons, we find that at top universities, the\nexisting faculty's research is generally less interdisciplinary, and their\nacademic priorities are more aligned with the Ph.D. research of less\ninterdisciplinary new hires. This preference may disadvantage women Ph.D.\ngraduates' faculty placement, who exhibit higher interdisciplinarity on\naverage. Furthermore, we show that newly hired faculty with greater\ninterdisciplinarity, when placed at top universities, tend to achieve higher\nlong-term research productivity.

    "abstract": "Traditional super-resolution (SR) methods assume an ``ideal'' downscaling\nSR-kernel (e.g., bicubic downscaling) between the high-resolution (HR) image\nand the low-resolution (LR) image. Such methods fail once the LR images are\ngenerated differently. Current blind-SR methods aim to remove this assumption,\nbut are still fundamentally restricted to rather simplistic downscaling\nSR-kernels (e.g., anisotropic Gaussian kernels), and fail on more complex (out\nof distribution) downscaling degradations. However, using the correct SR-kernel\nis often more important than using a sophisticated SR algorithm. In\n``KernelFusion'' we introduce a zero-shot diffusion-based method that makes no\nassumptions about the kernel. Our method recovers the unique image-specific\nSR-kernel directly from the LR input image, while simultaneously recovering its\ncorresponding HR image. KernelFusion exploits the principle that the correct\nSR-kernel is the one that maximizes patch similarity across different scales of\nthe LR image. We first train an image-specific patch-based diffusion model on\nthe single LR input image, capturing its unique internal patch statistics. We\nthen reconstruct a larger HR image with the same learned patch distribution,\nwhile simultaneously recovering the correct downscaling SR-kernel that\nmaintains this cross-scale relation between the HR and LR images. Empirical\nresults show that KernelFusion vastly outperforms all SR baselines on complex\ndownscaling degradations, where existing SotA Blind-SR methods fail miserably.\nBy breaking free from predefined kernel assumptions, KernelFusion pushes\nBlind-SR into a new assumption-free paradigm, handling downscaling kernels\npreviously thought impossible.",

    "abstract": "Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) is a ubiquitous quantity with applications\nranging from quantum metrology and resource theories to condensed matter\nphysics. In equilibrium local quantum many-body systems, the QFI of a subsystem\nwith respect to an extensive observable is typically proportional to the\nsubsystem's volume. Specifically, in large subsystems at equilibrium, the QFI\nper unit volume squared becomes negligible. We reveal a natural mechanism that\namplifies the QFI in a quantum spin chain with a zero-temperature ordered\nphase. At zero or sufficiently low temperatures, a transient localized\nperturbation enhances the QFI, causing it to scale quadratically with the\nsubsystem's length. Furthermore, this enhancement can be controlled through\nmore general localized kicking protocols. We also revisit the behavior of the\nquantum Fisher information after a global quench in the thermodynamic limit,\nfocusing on the generation of localized -- confined within compact subsystems\n-- multipartite entanglement. We show that the density of localized\nmultipartite entanglement approaches zero at late times, but there is an\noptimal time frame proportional to the length in which subsystems fall into\nmacroscopic quantum states. We test our predictions against numerical data\nobtained using a novel technique, based on a remarkable identity between\nquantum Fisher information and Wigner-Yanase-Dyson skew information, that\nallows one to compute the quantum Fisher information with respect to the order\nparameter in noninteracting spin chains.",

To bridge this gap and facilitate the practical deployment of\nLLM-based VAD, we introduce AssistPDA, the first online video anomaly\nsurveillance assistant that unifies video anomaly prediction, detection, and\nanalysis (VAPDA) within a single framework.

To enhance the\nability to model intricate spatiotemporal relationships in anomaly events, we\npropose a Spatio-Temporal Relation Distillation (STRD) module. STRD transfers\nthe long-term spatiotemporal modeling capabilities of vision-language models\n(VLMs) from offline settings to real-time scenarios.

Wakes generated at\n$C_T \\in \\{0.5, 0.7,0.9\\}$ are exposed to turbulent inflows with varying FST\nintensity ($1\\% \\lesssim TI_{\\infty} \\lesssim 11\\%$) and integral length scale\n($0.1 \\lesssim \\mathcal{L}_x/D \\lesssim 2$, $D$ is the rotor diameter). For\nhigh-$TI_{\\infty}$ inflows, a flow region within the wake is observed several\ndiameters downstream, where a mean momentum deficit persists despite the\nturbulence intensity having already homogenised with the freestream,\nchallenging traditional wake definitions. A ``turning point'' in the mean wake\nwidth evolution is identified, beyond which wakes spread at slower rates.\nNear-field ($x/D \\lesssim 7$) wake growth rate increases with higher\n$TI_{\\infty}$ and $C_T$, while far-field ($x/D \\gtrsim 15$) wake growth rate\ndecreases with higher $TI_{\\infty}$ -- a finding with profound implications for\nwind turbine wake modelling that also bridges the gap with entrainment\nbehaviours observed in bluff and porous body wakes exposed to FST. Increasing\n$\\mathcal{L}_x$ delays wake recovery onset and reduces the mean wake width,\nwith minimal effect on the spreading rate. Both $C_T$ and FST influence high-\nand low-frequency wake dynamics, with varying contributions in the near and far\nfields. For low-$TI_{\\infty}$ and small-$\\mathcal{L}_x$ inflows, wake\nmeandering is minimal, sensitive to $C_T$, and appears to be triggered by shear\nlayer instabilities. Wake meandering is enhanced for high-$TI_{\\infty}$ and\nlarge-$\\mathcal{L}_x$ inflows and is dominated by background turbulence. This\nemphasises the complex role of FST integral length scale: while increasing\n$\\mathcal{L}_x$ amplifies meandering, it does not necessarily translate to\nlarger mean wake width due to the concurrent suppression of entrainment rate.",

The temperature profile,\ncharacterized by an increase with pressure in the upper region and an inversion\nin the lower, is influenced by Rosseland opacity, spectral bands, and chemical\ncomposition. The atmosphere consists of five distinct layers: a\npseudo-adiabatic zone shaped by mixing flux, two convective layers driven by\nconvective flux with a smaller adiabatic gradient, and two radiative layers. In\nscenarios with lower Rosseland opacity, vertical mixing significantly reduces\nthe width of temperature inversion, counteracting the cooling effect of the\nconvective layers and driving the deep convective layer inward. The convective\nflux lowers the upper temperature and expands the upper convective layer. In\nthe low-Rosseland-opacity five-band model, these fluxes significantly cool the\nmid-atmosphere when temperature increases with pressure, enlarging the\npseudo-adiabatic region. Without TiO/VO, the pseudo-adiabatic region shrinks,\nindicating that TiO/VO enhances the mixing effect. Moreover, less mixing\nintensity is essential to maintain a stable five-layer structure.

E-IRFS\nadjusts sampling probabilities using an exponential function applied to the\ngeometric mean of image and instance frequencies, ensuring a more adaptive\nrebalancing strategy. We evaluate E-IRFS on a dataset derived from the\nFireman-UAV-RGBT Dataset and four additional public datasets, using YOLOv11\nobject detection models to identify fire, smoke, people and lakes in emergency\nscenarios. The results show that E-IRFS improves detection performance by 22\\%\nover the baseline and outperforms RFS and IRFS, particularly for rare\ncategories. The analysis also highlights that E-IRFS has a stronger effect on\nlightweight models with limited capacity, as these models rely more on data\nsampling strategies to address class imbalance. The findings demonstrate that\nE-IRFS improves rare object detection in resource-constrained environments,\nmaking it a suitable solution for real-time applications such as UAV-based\nemergency monitoring.

    "abstract": "Stellar occultations by asteroids observed from several stations are\nroutinely used to reconstruct the asteroid's sky-plane projections. Together\nwith the asteroid's shape model reconstructed from photometry, such\noccultations enable us to precisely determine its size and reveal details of\nits shape. When reducing occultation timings, the usual assumption is that the\nstar has a negligible angular diameter compared to the asteroid, so it is\nmodeled as a point source. The occultation of Betelgeuse (alpha Orionis) by\nasteroid (319) Leona on 12 December 2023 was a rare exception - the apparent\nangular diameter of the star was $\\sim 50$ mas, about the same as that of the\nasteroid. This work aimed to reconstruct the shape and spin model of asteroid\nLeona. Then, the projection of that model for the time of the occultation can\nbe computed, which is necessary to interpret the occultation timings and infer\nvaluable information about Betelgeuse itself. We collected available\nphotometric data of Leona, carried out new observations, and reconstructed a\nunique convex shape model. Using three other occultations observed in 2023, we\nscaled this convex model. We also reconstructed an alternative nonconvex model\nwith the same spin parameters and size but showing some surface details that\nexplain better one of the occultations. We confirmed the tumbling rotation\nstate of Leona and uniquely determined the rotation period $P_\\psi = 1172.2 \\pm\n0.3$ h and the precession period $P_\\phi = 314.27 \\pm 0.02$ h. The\nvolume-equivalent diameter determined by occultations is $59.1 \\pm 0.9$ km. The\nreconstructed shape model of Leona enabled us to compute its sky-plane\nprojection for the time of the Betelgeuse occultation. A reliable shape model\ncan be used to interpret the observed occultation of Betelgeuse by Leona.",

Using a total of ~50 hours of ALMA observations of Proxima Cen at 1.3 mm\n(233 GHz), we add a new piece to the stellar flaring picture and report the\nfirst cumulative flare frequency distribution (FFD) at millimeter wavelengths\nof any M dwarf.

The brightest and most energetic flare in our sample reached a\nflux density of 119 $\\pm$ 7 mJy, increasing by a factor of 1000x the quiescent\nflux, and reaching an energy of 10$^{27}$ erg in the ALMA bandpass, with\nt$_{1/2}$~16s.

In this paper, we propose a\ntwo-phase head avatar reconstruction network that incorporates a refined 3D\nmesh representation. Our approach, in contrast to existing methods that rely on\ncoarse template-based 3D representations derived from 3DMM, aims to learn a\nrefined mesh representation suitable for a NeRF that captures complex facial\nnuances. In the first phase, we train 3DMM-stored NeRF with an initial mesh to\nutilize geometric priors and integrate observations across frames using a\nconsistent set of latent codes. In the second phase, we leverage a novel mesh\nrefinement procedure based on an SDF constructed from the density field of the\ninitial NeRF. To mitigate the typical noise in the NeRF density field without\ncompromising the features of the 3DMM, we employ Laplace smoothing on the\ndisplacement field. Subsequently, we apply a second-phase training with these\nrefined meshes, directing the learning process of the network towards capturing\nintricate facial details. Our experiments demonstrate that our method further\nenhances the NeRF rendering based on the initial mesh and achieves performance\nsuperior to state-of-the-art methods in reconstructing high-fidelity head\navatars with such input.",

Traditionally, a\ntemperature is assigned to an energy \\emph{eigenvalue} through the textbook\ncanonical temperature-energy relationship. However, in this work, we use the\n\\emph{eigenstate subsystem temperature} -- a recently developed quantity that\nassigns a temperature to an energy eigenstate, based on the structure of its\nreduced density matrix. For a thermal state, the eigenstate subsystem\ntemperature is approximately equal to its canonical temperature. Given that\nquantum many-body scars have a ground-state-like entanglement structure, it is\nnot immediately clear that their eigenstate subsystem temperature would be\nclose to their canonical temperature.

    "abstract": "We investigate the spectral behavior of scalar fluctuations generated by\ngravity during inflation and the subsequent reheating phase. We consider a\nnon-perturbative Bogoliubov treatment within the context of pure gravitational\nreheating. We compute both long and short-wavelength spectra, first for a\nmassless scalar field, revealing that the spectral index in part of the\ninfrared (IR) regime varies between $-6$ and $-3$, depending on the\npost-inflationary equation of state (EoS), $0\\leq w_\\phi\\leq1$. Furthermore, we\nstudy the mass-breaking effect of the IR spectrum by including finite mass,\n$m_{\\chi}$, of the daughter scalar field. We show that for $m_{\\chi}/H_{\\rm e}\n\\gtrsim 3/2$, where $H_{\\rm e}$ is the Hubble parameter during inflation, the\nIR spectrum of scalar fluctuations experiences exponential mass suppression,\nwhile for smaller masses, $m_{\\chi}/H_{\\rm e}<3/2$, the spectrum remains flat\nin the IR regime regardless of the post-inflationary EoS. For any general EoS,\nwe also compute a specific IR scale, $k_m$, of fluctuations below which the IR\nspectrum will suffer from this finite mass effect. In the UV regime,\noscillations of the inflaton background lead to interference terms that explain\nthe high-frequency oscillations in the spectrum. Interestingly, we find that\nfor any EoS, $1/9 \\lesssim w_\\phi \\lesssim 1$, the spectral behavior turns out\nto be independent of the EoS, with a spectral index $ -6$. We have compared\nthis Bogoliubov treatment for the UV regime to perturbative computations with\nsolutions to the Boltzmann equation and found an agreement between the two\napproaches for any EoS, $0 \\lesssim w_\\phi \\lesssim 1$. We also explore the\nrelationship between the gravitational reheating temperature and the reheating\nEoS employing the non-perturbative analytic approach, finding that reheating\ncan occur for $w_\\phi \\gtrsim 0.6$.",

However, naively increasing computation in techniques like\nBest-of-N sampling can lead to performance degradation due to reward hacking.\nToward a theoretical understanding of how to best leverage additional\ncomputation, we focus on inference-time alignment, which we formalize as the\nproblem of improving the quality of responses drawn from a pre-trained policy,\ngiven a prompt of interest and access to an imperfect reward model. We analyze\nthe performance of inference-time alignment algorithms in terms of (i) response\nquality, and (ii) compute, and provide new results that highlight the\nimportance of the pre-trained policy's coverage over high-quality responses for\nperformance and compute scaling:\n  1.

Detailed spectral analysis hold the potential to\nreveal their progenitors and underlying energy sources. This paper presents the\nlargest compilation of SLSN photospheric spectra to date, encompassing data\nfrom ePESSTO+, the FLEET search and all published spectra up to December 2022.\nThe dataset includes a total of 974 spectra of 234 SLSNe. By constructing\naverage phase binned spectra, we find SLSNe initially exhibit high temperatures\n(10000 to 11000 K), with blue continua and weak lines. A rapid transformation\nfollows, as temperatures drop to 5000 to 6000 K by 40 days post peak, leading\nto stronger P-Cygni features. These averages also suggest a fraction of SLSNe\nmay contain some He at explosion. Variance within the dataset is slightly\nreduced when defining the phase of spectra relative to explosion, rather than\npeak, and normalising to the population's median e-folding time. Principal\nComponent Analysis (PCA) supports this, requiring fewer components to explain\nthe same level of variation when binning data by scaled days from explosion,\nsuggesting a more homogeneous grouping. Using PCA and K-Means clustering, we\nidentify outlying objects with unusual spectroscopic evolution and evidence for\nenergy input from interaction, but find not support for groupings of two or\nmore statistically significant subpopulations. We find Fe II {\\lambda}5169\nlines velocities closely track the radius implied from blackbody fits,\nindicating formation near the photosphere. We also confirm a correlation\nbetween velocity and velocity gradient, which can be explained if all SLSNe are\nin homologous expansion but with different scale velocities. This behaviour\naligns with expectations for an internal powering mechanism.",

We perform the first dedicated analysis of the role of wave\ninterference on this evolution due to self-interactions in FDM and vice versa,\ndeveloping a perturbative treatment applicable at early times and then\ncomparing against a suite of fully nonlinear benchmark simulations, varying the\ndark matter density, interaction strength, and fiducial momentum scale.

We find that in such scenarios, density\nperturbations are unable to grow on the expected self interaction time scale\nbecause of interference effects, instead saturating on the much shorter de\nBroglie crossing time, with a dependence on the sign of the interaction.\nFinally, we comment on the implications of our results for astrophysical\nsystems such as high-density ultra-faint dwarf galaxies where wave interference\nplays an important role.",

The\ndistribution of S\\'ersic indices for these featureless systems suggests that\nthey truly are dynamically cold: disc-dominated systems have existed since at\nleast $z\\sim 7.4$. We place upper limits on the featureless disc fraction as a\nfunction of redshift, and show that up to $75\\%$ of discs are featureless at\n$3.0<z<7.4$.

    "abstract": "Source inference for deterministic gravitational waves is a computationally\ndemanding task in LISA. In a novel approach, we investigate the capability of\nGaussian Processes to learn the posterior surface in order to reconstruct\nindividual signal posteriors. We use GPry, which automates this reconstruction\nthrough active learning, using a very small number of likelihood evaluations,\nwithout the need for pretraining. We benchmark GPry against the cutting-edge\nnested sampler nessai, by injecting individually three signals on LISA noisy\ndata simulated with Balrog: a white dwarf binary (DWD), a stellar-mass black\nhole binary (stBHB), and a super-massive black hole binary (SMBHB). We find\nthat GPry needs $\\mathcal O(10^{-2})$ fewer likelihood evaluations to achieve\nan inference accuracy comparable to nessai, with Jensen-Shannon divergence\n$D_{\\scriptscriptstyle \\mathrm{JS}} \\lesssim 0.01$ for the DWD, and\n$D_{\\scriptscriptstyle \\mathrm{JS}} \\lesssim 0.05$ for the SMBHB. Lower\naccuracy is found for the less Gaussian posterior of the stBHB:\n$D_{\\scriptscriptstyle \\mathrm{JS}} \\lesssim 0.2$. Despite the overhead costs\nof GPry, we obtain a speed-up of $\\mathcal O(10^2)$ for the slowest cases of\nstBHB and SMBHB. In conclusion, active-learning Gaussian process frameworks\nshow great potential for rapid LISA parameter inference, especially for costly\nlikelihoods, enabling suppression of computational costs without the trade-off\nof approximations in the calculations.",

Source code and pre-trained models will be released upon acceptance.\nProject Page: https://stylemotif.github.io",

    "abstract": "It is one of the most fundamental objectives in quantum information science\nto understand the boundary between the computational power of classical and\nquantum computers. One possible avenue to explore this boundary is to identify\nclasses of quantum circuits that can be efficiently simulated on a classical\ncomputer. Instead of simulating a general quantum circuit with a classical\ndevice, new schemes have recently emerged to simulate them on a quantum device\nthat is restricted in some manner. As such, these techniques allow us to study\nhow the restrictions impact the computational power of the device. One such\ntechnique is called quasiprobability simulation (QPS) and it estimates the\nresult of a quantum circuit with a Monte Carlo procedure that randomly replaces\ncircuit elements with ones that can be executed on the restricted quantum\ndevice.\n  The main focus of this thesis is dedicated to the QPS-based simulation of\nnonlocal quantum computation using local quantum operations. On the practical\nside, this enables the simulation of large quantum circuits using multiple\nsmaller quantum devices - a procedure that is sometimes called circuit\nknitting. We uncover a rich mathematical formalism with many connections to the\nresource theory of entanglement. We characterize the optimal simulation\noverhead for a broad range of practically relevant nonlocal states and channels\nand we explicitly provide achieving protocols. Moreover, we also investigate\nthe utility of classical communication between the local parties. Our results\naddress both the single-shot and asymptotic regime.\n  We frame QPS in a quantum resource theoretic framework, which highlights\nsimilarities that arise in the different instantiations of the technique.\nFurthermore, we study the importance of classical side information in the QPS\nprocedure and how it impacts the overhead and expressibility of QPS.",

Compared to\nexisting methods that perform pair-wise similarity estimation with local\ndescriptors or list-wise re-ranking with global descriptors, LOCORE is the\nfirst method to perform list-wise re-ranking with local descriptors.

Nevertheless, high-quality and large-scale underwater\ndatasets with dense annotations remain scarce because of the complex\nenvironment and the exorbitant data collection costs. This paper proposes a\nunified Text-to-Image and DEnse annotation generation method (TIDE) for\nunderwater scenes. It relies solely on text as input to simultaneously generate\nrealistic underwater images and multiple highly consistent dense annotations.\nSpecifically, we unify the generation of text-to-image and text-to-dense\nannotations within a single model. The Implicit Layout Sharing mechanism (ILS)\nand cross-modal interaction method called Time Adaptive Normalization (TAN) are\nintroduced to jointly optimize the consistency between image and dense\nannotations. We synthesize a large-scale underwater dataset using TIDE to\nvalidate the effectiveness of our method in underwater dense prediction tasks.\nThe results demonstrate that our method effectively improves the performance of\nexisting underwater dense prediction models and mitigates the scarcity of\nunderwater data with dense annotations.

    "abstract": "In this work, we aim to compress the vision tokens of a Large Vision Language\nModel (LVLM) into a representation that is simultaneously suitable for (a)\ngenerative and (b) discriminative tasks, (c) is nearly lossless, and (d) is\nstorage-efficient. We propose a novel compression approach, called Fwd2Bot,\nthat uses the LVLM itself to compress the visual information in a task-agnostic\nmanner. At the core of Fwd2bot there exists a \"double-forward pass\" training\nstrategy, whereby, during the first forward pass, the LLM (of the LVLM) creates\na bottleneck by condensing the visual information into a small number of\nsummary tokens. Then, using the same LLM, the second forward pass processes the\nlanguage instruction(s) alongside the summary tokens, used as a direct\nreplacement for the image ones. The training signal is provided by two losses:\nan autoregressive one applied after the second pass that provides a direct\noptimization objective for compression, and a contrastive loss, applied after\nthe first pass, that further boosts the representation strength, especially for\ndiscriminative tasks. The training is further enhanced by stage-specific\nadapters. We accompany the proposed method by an in-depth ablation study.\nOverall, Fwd2Bot results in highly-informative compressed representations\nsuitable for both generative and discriminative tasks. For generative tasks, we\noffer a 2x higher compression rate without compromising the generative\ncapabilities, setting a new state-of-the-art result. For discriminative tasks,\nwe set a new state-of-the-art on image retrieval and compositionality.",

The application areas of the bridge problem are enormous,\namong which the recent generative modeling (e.g., conditional or unconditional\nimage generation) is the most popular. Also the famous Schr\\\"{o}dinger bridge\nproblem, a widely known problem for a century, is a special instance of the\nbridge problem. Two most popular algorithms to tackle the bridge problems in\nthe deep learning era are: (conditional) flow matching and iterative fitting\nalgorithms, where the former confined to ODE solutions, and the latter\nspecifically for the Schr\\\"{o}dinger bridge problem. The main contribution of\nthis article is in two folds: i) We provide concise reviews of these algorithms\nwith technical details to some extent; ii) We propose a novel unified\nperspective and framework that subsumes these seemingly unrelated algorithms\n(and their variants) into one. In particular, we show that our unified\nframework can instantiate the Flow Matching (FM) algorithm, the (mini-batch)\noptimal transport FM algorithm, the (mini-batch) Schr\\\"{o}dinger bridge FM\nalgorithm, and the deep Schr\\\"{o}dinger bridge matching (DSBM) algorithm as its\nspecial cases.

To evaluate these video generative models, benchmarks such\nas VBench have been developed to assess their faithfulness, measuring factors\nlike per-frame aesthetics, temporal consistency, and basic prompt adherence.\nHowever, these aspects mainly represent superficial faithfulness, which focus\non whether the video appears visually convincing rather than whether it adheres\nto real-world principles. While recent models perform increasingly well on\nthese metrics, they still struggle to generate videos that are not just\nvisually plausible but fundamentally realistic. To achieve real \"world models\"\nthrough video generation, the next frontier lies in intrinsic faithfulness to\nensure that generated videos adhere to physical laws, commonsense reasoning,\nanatomical correctness, and compositional integrity. Achieving this level of\nrealism is essential for applications such as AI-assisted filmmaking and\nsimulated world modeling. To bridge this gap, we introduce VBench-2.0, a\nnext-generation benchmark designed to automatically evaluate video generative\nmodels for their intrinsic faithfulness. VBench-2.0 assesses five key\ndimensions: Human Fidelity, Controllability, Creativity, Physics, and\nCommonsense, each further broken down into fine-grained capabilities. Tailored\nto individual dimensions, our evaluation framework integrates generalists such\nas SOTA VLMs and LLMs, and specialists, including anomaly detection methods\nproposed for video generation.

Using this dataset, we further train a\nCLIP-based scoring model, 3DGen-Score, and a MLLM-based automatic evaluator,\n3DGen-Eval. These two models innovatively unify the quality evaluation of\ntext-to-3D and image-to-3D generation, and jointly form our automated\nevaluation system with their respective strengths. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate the efficacy of our scoring model in predicting human preferences,\nexhibiting a superior correlation with human ranks compared to existing\nmetrics. We believe that our 3DGen-Bench dataset and automated evaluation\nsystem will foster a more equitable evaluation in the field of 3D generation,\nfurther promoting the development of 3D generative models and their downstream\napplications.

Although LIM experiments ultimately\naim to provide powerful cosmological constraints via auto-correlation, many LIM\nexperiments are also designed to take advantage of overlapping galaxy surveys,\nenabling joint analyses of the two datasets. We introduce a flexible simulation\npipeline that can generate mock galaxy surveys and mock LIM data simultaneously\nfor the same population of simulated galaxies. Using this pipeline, we explore\na simple joint analysis technique: three-dimensional co-addition (stacking) of\nLIM data on the positions of galaxies from a traditional galaxy catalogue. We\ntest how the output of this technique reacts to changes in experimental design\nof both the LIM experiment and the galaxy survey, its sensitivity to various\nastrophysical parameters, and its susceptibility to common systematic errors.\nWe find that an ideal catalogue for a stacking analysis targets as many\nhigh-mass dark matter halos as possible. We also find that the signal in a LIM\nstacking analysis originates almost entirely from the large-scale clustering of\nhalos around the catalogue objects, rather than the catalogue objects\nthemselves. While stacking is a sensitive and conceptually simple way to\nachieve a LIM detection, thus providing a valuable way to validate a LIM\nauto-correlation detection, it will likely require a full cross-correlation to\nachieve further characterization of the galaxy tracers involved, as the\ncosmological and astrophysical parameters we explore here have degenerate\neffects on the stack.",

In this work, we study the\nexact non-Markovian dynamics of a driven cavity coupled to an anisotropic\nthree-dimensional photonic-crystal environment via counterrotating-wave\ninteractions. We derive an exact analytical expression for the cavity amplitude\nsatisfying the integro-differential equation, which includes the contributions\nof the bound states outside the continuum and the dissipative parts with the\ncontinuum spectrum. Based on the characteristic function method, we derive the\nexact non-Markovian master equation for the cavity, which contributes to the\ngain of the cavity. We give the physical origin of non-Markovian gain in the\npresence of bound states in the system consisting of cavity and environment,\nwhich has no Markovian counterparts due to the nonexponential gain in the\nnon-Markovian structured environment. We find that three different types of\nbound states can be formed in the system, containing one bound state with no\ninversion of photon number, two bound states with the periodic equal-amplitude\noscillation, and the gain with two complex roots without the bound states\nformation. We derive a current equation including the source from the driving\nfield, the transient current induced by the change in the number of photons,\nand the two-photon current caused by the counterrotating-wave term. The results\nare compared with those given by the rotating-wave interactions and extended to\na more general quantum network involving an arbitrary number of coupled\ncavities.

Internal drivers of such flows, such as bars and spiral arms,\nknown to mediate gas flows in the local Universe, are now observable at high\nredshift thanks to JWST's unobscured view. We investigated the morphology of\nmassive star-forming galaxies at 0.8<z<1.3 and 2.0<z<2.5, epochs marking the\npeak and decline of cosmic star formation, both well covered by kinematic\nsurveys. Using JWST/NIRCam imaging, we visually classified 1,451 galaxies,\nidentified nonaxisymmetric features, counted the number of spiral arms,\nanalyzed nonparametric morphological indicators, and studied the dynamical\nsupport of the sample covered by kinematics ($\\approx$ 11% of the sample) as\nmeasured via $v/\\sigma$. Disks dominate the sample (fraction $0.82 \\pm 0.03$);\namong them, $0.48 \\pm 0.04$ exhibit spiral structure and $0.11 \\pm 0.03$ host\nbars. Both fractions decline with redshift, in agreement with previous studies.\nThe proportion of two- and three-armed spirals remains largely unchanged across\nour redshift bins: approximately two-thirds show two arms and one-third show\nthree arms in both bins. Notably, we find a higher incidence of three-armed\nspirals ($\\approx 0.30$) than reported in the local Universe ($\\approx 0.20$),\nsuggesting a mild evolution in spiral arm multiplicity. Nonparametric\nmorphological metrics strongly correlate with stellar mass but show no\nsignificant redshift evolution. Finally, kinematic analysis reveals a\ncorrelation between disk morphology and rotational support: most disks exhibit\n$v/\\sigma > 3$ and median values of $v/\\sigma > 7$ for spirals and $v/\\sigma >\n5$ for barred galaxies.

Industrial\ndeployment shows over 80% reduction in analysis time while maintaining high\naccuracy across test result interpretation, impact assessment, and release\ncandidate evaluation. GateLens operates effectively in zero-shot settings\nwithout requiring few-shot examples or agent orchestration.

    "abstract": "We present a deterministic fully-dynamic data structure for maintaining\ninformation about the cut-vertices in a graph; i.e. the vertices whose removal\nwould disconnect the graph. Our data structure supports insertion and deletion\nof edges, as well as queries to whether a pair of connected vertices are either\nbiconnected, or can be separated by a cutvertex, and in the latter case we\nsupport access to separating cutvertices. All update operations are supported\nin amortized $O(\\log^2 n \\log^2 \\log n)$ time, and queries take worst-case\n$O(\\log n \\log^2 \\log n)$ time. Note that these time bounds match the current\nbest for deterministic dynamic connectivity up to $\\log \\log n$ factors.\n  We obtain our improved running time by a series of reductions from the\noriginal problem into well-defined data structure problems. While we do apply\nthe well-known techniques for improving running time of two-edge connectivity\n[STOC'00, SODA'18], these techniques alone do not lead to an update time of\n$\\tilde{O}(\\log^3 n)$, let alone the $\\tilde{O}(\\log^2 n)$ we give as a final\nresult.\n  Our contributions include a formally defined transient expose operation,\nwhich can be thought of as a cheaper read-only expose operation on a top tree.\nFor each vertex in the graph, we maintain a data structure over its neighbors,\nand in this data structure we apply biasing (twice) to save two $\\tilde{O}(\\log\nn)$ factors. One of these biasing techniques is a new biased disjoint sets data\nstructure, which may be of independent interest. Moreover, in this neighborhood\ndata structure, we facilitate that the vertex can select two VIP neighbors that\nget special treatment, corresponding to its potentially two neighbors on an\nexposed path, improving a $\\log n$-time operation down to constant time. It is\nthis combination of VIP neighbors with the transient expose that saves an\n$\\tilde{O}(\\log n)$-factor from another bottleneck.",

Existing\nimplicit field methods often require costly and detail-degrading watertight\nconversion, while other approaches struggle with high resolutions. This paper\nintroduces SparseFlex, a novel sparse-structured isosurface representation that\nenables differentiable mesh reconstruction at resolutions up to $1024^3$\ndirectly from rendering losses. SparseFlex combines the accuracy of Flexicubes\nwith a sparse voxel structure, focusing computation on surface-adjacent regions\nand efficiently handling open surfaces. Crucially, we introduce a frustum-aware\nsectional voxel training strategy that activates only relevant voxels during\nrendering, dramatically reducing memory consumption and enabling\nhigh-resolution training. This also allows, for the first time, the\nreconstruction of mesh interiors using only rendering supervision. Building\nupon this, we demonstrate a complete shape modeling pipeline by training a\nvariational autoencoder (VAE) and a rectified flow transformer for high-quality\n3D shape generation. Our experiments show state-of-the-art reconstruction\naccuracy, with a ~82% reduction in Chamfer Distance and a ~88% increase in\nF-score compared to previous methods, and demonstrate the generation of\nhigh-resolution, detailed 3D shapes with arbitrary topology.

Understanding the mechanisms behind their abilities and\nimplementing controls over them is becoming increasingly important for\ndeveloping better models. In this paper, we focus on skill unlearning in LLMs,\nspecifically unlearning a particular skill while retaining their overall\ncapabilities. We introduce two lightweight, training-free machine skill\nunlearning techniques for LLMs. First, we observe that the pre-activation\ndistribution of neurons in each Feed-Forward Layer (FFL) differs when the model\ndemonstrates different skills. Additionally, we find that queries triggering\nthe same skill cluster within the FFL key space and can be separated from other\nqueries using a hypercube. Based on these observations, we propose two\nlightweight, training-free skill unlearning methods via \\textit{intervention}\nand \\textit{abstention} respectively: \\texttt{Neuron Adjust} and \\texttt{Key\nSpace Detection}. We evaluate our methods on unlearning math-solving,\nPython-coding, and comprehension skills across seven different languages.

While recent\nworks equip reinforcement learning (RL)-based LRMs with retrieval capabilities,\nthey suffer from overthinking and lack robustness in reasoning, reducing their\neffectiveness in question answering (QA) tasks. To address this, we propose\nReaRAG, a factuality-enhanced reasoning model that explores diverse queries\nwithout excessive iterations. Our solution includes a novel data construction\nframework with an upper bound on the reasoning chain length.

For Search action, a query\nis executed against the RAG engine, where the result is returned as observation\nto guide reasoning steps later. This process iterates until a Finish action is\nchosen. Benefiting from ReaRAG's strong reasoning capabilities, our approach\noutperforms existing baselines on multi-hop QA.

    "abstract": "Radio-frequency interference (RFI) is a major systematic limitation in radio\nastronomy, particularly for science cases requiring high sensitivity, such as\n21 cm cosmology. Traditionally, RFI is dealt with by identifying its signature\nin the dynamic spectra of visibility data and flagging strongly affected\nregions. However, for RFI sources that do not occupy narrow regions in the\ntime-frequency space, such as persistent local RFI, modeling these sources\ncould be essential to mitigating their impact. This paper introduces two\nmethods for detecting and characterizing local RFI sources from radio\ninterferometric visibilities: matched filtering and maximum a posteriori (MAP)\nimaging. These algorithms use the spherical wave equation to construct\nthree-dimensional near-field image cubes of RFI intensity from the\nvisibilities. The matched filter algorithm can generate normalized maps by\ncross-correlating the expected contributions from RFI sources with the observed\nvisibilities, while the MAP method performs a regularized inversion of the\nvisibility equation in the near field. We developed a full polarization\nsimulation framework for RFI and demonstrated the methods on simulated\nobservations of local RFI sources. The stability, speed, and errors introduced\nby these algorithms were investigated, and, as a demonstration, the algorithms\nwere applied to a subset of NenuFAR observations to perform spatial, spectral,\nand temporal characterization of two local RFI sources. We used simulations to\nassess the impact of local RFI on images, the uv plane, and cylindrical power\nspectra, and to quantify the level of bias introduced by the algorithms in\norder to understand their implications for the estimated 21 cm power spectrum\nwith radio interferometers.

    "abstract": "The accurate navigation of autonomous underwater vehicles critically depends\non the precision of Doppler velocity log (DVL) velocity measurements. Recent\nadvancements in deep learning have demonstrated significant potential in\nimproving DVL outputs by leveraging spatiotemporal dependencies across multiple\nsensor modalities. However, integrating these estimates into model-based\nfilters, such as the extended Kalman filter, introduces statistical\ninconsistencies, most notably, cross-correlations between process and\nmeasurement noise. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing a\ncross-correlation-aware deep INS/DVL fusion framework. Building upon BeamsNet,\na convolutional neural network designed to estimate AUV velocity using DVL and\ninertial data, we integrate its output into a navigation filter that explicitly\naccounts for the cross-correlation induced between the noise sources. This\napproach improves filter consistency and better reflects the underlying sensor\nerror structure. Evaluated on two real-world underwater trajectories, the\nproposed method outperforms both least squares and cross-correlation-neglecting\napproaches in terms of state uncertainty. Notably, improvements exceed 10% in\nvelocity and misalignment angle confidence metrics. Beyond demonstrating\nempirical performance, this framework provides a theoretically principled\nmechanism for embedding deep learning outputs within stochastic filters.",

Our method includes first localising\nthe hand joints using a CNN based model and then refining them by extracting\ncontextual information.

This helps the model to identify\nthe hand belongingness of a particular joint which helps to detect the joint\neven in the occluded region. Further, these joints with hand identity are then\nused to estimate the pose using cross attention mechanism. Thus, by identifying\nthe joints in the occluded region, the obtained network becomes robust to\nocclusion.

    "abstract": "Evaluating text-to-image and text-to-video models is challenging due to a\nfundamental disconnect: established metrics fail to jointly measure visual\nquality and semantic alignment with text, leading to a poor correlation with\nhuman judgments. To address this critical issue, we propose cFreD, a general\nmetric based on a Conditional Fr\\'echet Distance that unifies the assessment of\nvisual fidelity and text-prompt consistency into a single score. Existing\nmetrics such as Fr\\'echet Inception Distance (FID) capture image quality but\nignore text conditioning while alignment scores such as CLIPScore are\ninsensitive to visual quality. Furthermore, learned preference models require\nconstant retraining and are unlikely to generalize to novel architectures or\nout-of-distribution prompts. Through extensive experiments across multiple\nrecently proposed text-to-image models and diverse prompt datasets, cFreD\nexhibits a higher correlation with human judgments compared to statistical\nmetrics , including metrics trained with human preferences. Our findings\nvalidate cFreD as a robust, future-proof metric for the systematic evaluation\nof text conditioned models, standardizing benchmarking in this rapidly evolving\nfield. We release our evaluation toolkit and benchmark.",

    "abstract": "Alignment of Large Language models (LLMs) is crucial for safe and trustworthy\ndeployment in applications. Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)\nhas emerged as an effective technique to align LLMs to human preferences and\nbroader utilities, but it requires updating billions of model parameters, which\nis computationally expensive. Controlled Decoding, by contrast, provides a\nmechanism for aligning a model at inference time without retraining. However,\nsingle-agent decoding approaches often struggle to adapt to diverse tasks due\nto the complexity and variability inherent in these tasks. To strengthen the\ntest-time performance w.r.t the target task, we propose a mixture of\nagent-based decoding strategies leveraging the existing off-the-shelf aligned\nLLM policies. Treating each prior policy as an agent in the spirit of mixture\nof agent collaboration, we develop a decoding method that allows for\ninference-time alignment through a token-level selection strategy among\nmultiple agents. For each token, the most suitable LLM is dynamically chosen\nfrom a pool of models based on a long-term utility metric. This\npolicy-switching mechanism ensures optimal model selection at each step,\nenabling efficient collaboration and alignment among LLMs during decoding.\nTheoretical analysis of our proposed algorithm establishes optimal performance\nwith respect to the target task represented via a target reward for the given\noff-the-shelf models. We conduct comprehensive empirical evaluations with\nopen-source aligned models on diverse tasks and preferences, which demonstrates\nthe merits of this approach over single-agent decoding baselines. Notably,\nCollab surpasses the current SoTA decoding strategy, achieving an improvement\nof up to 1.56x in average reward and 71.89% in GPT-4 based win-tie rate.",

The\nstellar mass of the cluster grows through star formation within the cluster and\naccretion of new stars and star forming gas from a nearby filament. This growth\nresults in an enhancement in the cluster's rotation and anisotropic expansion\ncompared to simulations without star formation. We also analyze the internal\nkinematics of the cluster once it has lost most of its gas and find that the\nrotational velocity and the velocity anisotropy profiles are qualitatively\nsimilar to those expected of clusters that have undergone violent relaxation.\nAs well, rotation and anisotropic expansion are still present by the time of\ngas removal.

Typically, pruning focuses on the resulting\nefficiency gains at the cost of effectiveness. However, when looking at how\nindividual data points are affected by pruning, it turns out that a particular\nsubset of data points always bears most of the brunt (in terms of reduced\naccuracy) when pruning, but this effect goes unnoticed when reporting the mean\naccuracy of all data points. These data points are called PIEs and have been\nstudied in image processing, but not in NLP. In a study of various NLP\ndatasets, pruning methods, and levels of compression, we find that PIEs impact\ninference quality considerably, regardless of class frequency, and that BERT is\nmore prone to this than BiLSTM. We also find that PIEs contain a high amount of\ndata points that have the largest influence on how well the model generalises\nto unseen data. This means that when pruning, with seemingly moderate loss to\naccuracy across all data points, we in fact hurt tremendously those data points\nthat matter the most. We trace what makes PIEs both hard and impactful to\ninference to their overall longer and more semantically complex text.

The generation of additional nodes, along with control over their\npositions and shapes, is highly desirable in biomedical applications and could\nsignificantly enhance particle manipulation capabilities. To explore this\npotential, we numerically demonstrate the formation of additional,\ncomplex-shaped, nodes alongside the primary one, by a circular scatterer within\na rectangular cavity. We identify three distinct types: ring, protuberant, and\ncrescent nodes, whose formation depends on the size of the scatterer, its\nplacement in the middle of the channel, and its corresponding resonant\nfrequency. The key mechanism behind this formation is the enhancement of\ninternal reflections, increasing destructive interference to promote node\ngeneration. To achieve this, we employ three key concepts: using a low-aspect\nratio channel, positioning a rigid circular scatterer in the middle of the\nchannel, and modeling all surfaces as perfect reflectors. Furthermore, we\nanalyze the impact of the scatterer on acoustic pressure and quality factor,\nwhich is defined as the ratio of stored acoustic energy to damped acoustic\nenergy per cycle. We show that additional nodes emerge in the presence of a\nscatterer, but they come at the cost of reduced acoustic pressure and energy in\nthe channel. In summary, this study provides information on generating complex\nnodes in a standing wave acoustic cavity at the fundamental frequency, which\nhas numerous applications for particle manipulation in acoustofluidic devices.",

    "abstract": "The Flashlights program with the Hubble Space Telescope imaged the six Hubble\nFrontier Fields galaxy clusters in two epochs and detected twenty transients.\nThese are primarily expected to be caustic-crossing events (CCEs) where bright\nstars in distant lensed galaxies, typically at redshift $z\\approx1$--3, get\ntemporarily magnified close to cluster caustics. Since CCEs are generally\nbiased toward more massive and luminous stars, they offer a unique route for\nprobing the high end of the stellar mass function. We take advantage of the\nFlashlights event statistics to place preliminary constraints on the stellar\ninitial mass function (IMF) around cosmic noon. The photometry (along with\nspectral information) of lensed arcs is used to infer their various stellar\nproperties, and stellar synthesis models are used to evolve a recent stellar\npopulation in them. We estimate the microlens surface density near each arc\nand, together with existing lens models and simple formalism for CCEs,\ncalculate the expected rate for a given IMF. We find that, on average, a\nSalpeter-like IMF ($\\alpha=2.35$) underpredicts the number of observed CCEs by\na factor of ${\\sim}0.7$, and a top-heavy IMF ($\\alpha=1.00$) overpredicts by a\nfactor of ${\\sim}1.7$, suggesting that the average IMF slope may lie somewhere\nin between. However, given the large uncertainties associated with estimating\nthe stellar populations, these results are strongly model-dependent.\nNevertheless, we introduce a useful framework for constraining the IMF using\nCCEs. Observations with JWST are already yielding many more CCEs and will soon\nenable more stringent constraints on the IMF at a range of redshifts.",

Adding to this complexity,\ndecision-making processes can differ considerably between individuals, and\nmethods aimed at predicting human decisions need to take individual differences\ninto account. Behavioral science offers methods by which to measure individual\ndifferences (e.g., questionnaires, behavioral models), but these are often\nnarrowed down to low dimensions and not tailored to specific prediction tasks.\nThis paper investigates the use of representation learning to measure\nindividual differences from behavioral experiment data. Representation learning\noffers a flexible approach to create individual embeddings from data that are\nboth structured (e.g., demographic information) and unstructured (e.g., free\ntext), where the flexibility provides more options for individual difference\nmeasures for personalization, e.g., free text responses may allow for\nopen-ended questions that are less privacy-sensitive. In the current paper we\nuse representation learning to characterize individual differences in human\nperformance on an economic decision-making task. We demonstrate that models\nusing representation learning to capture individual differences consistently\nimprove decision predictions over models without representation learning, and\neven outperform well-known theory-based behavioral models used in these\nenvironments.

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) offers unprecedented\nspectral precision, resolution, and wavelength coverage, unlocking\ntransformative insights into the formation, evolution, climate, and potential\nhabitability of planetary systems. However, this opportunity is accompanied by\nchallenges: modeling assumptions and unaccounted-for noise or signal sources\ncan bias retrieval outcomes and their interpretation. To address these\nlimitations, we introduce a Gaussian Process (GP)-aided atmospheric retrieval\nframework that flexibly accounts for unmodeled features and correlated noise in\nexoplanet spectra. We validate this method on synthetic JWST observations and\nshow that GP-aided retrievals reduce bias in inferred abundances and better\ncapture model-data mismatches than traditional approaches. We also introduce\nthe concept of mean squared error to quantify the trade-off between bias and\nvariance, arguing that this metric more accurately reflects retrieval\nperformance than bias alone. We then reanalyze the NIRISS/SOSS JWST\ntransmission spectrum of WASP-96 b, finding that GP-aided retrievals yield\nbroader constraints on CO2 and H2O, possibly alleviating tension between\nprevious retrieval results and equilibrium predictions. Our GP framework\nprovides precise and accurate constraints while highlighting regions where\nmodels fail to explain the data. As JWST matures and future facilities come\nonline, a deeper understanding of the limitations of both data and models will\nbe essential, and GP-enabled retrievals like the one presented here offer a\nprincipled path forward.",

Whereas the\nsynthesis approach has the potential to change the development of reactive\nsystems significantly due to the avoidance of manual implementation, it still\nsuffers from a lack of efficient synthesis algorithms for many application\nscenarios. The translation of the system specification into an automaton that\nallows for strategy construction (if a winning strategy exists) is\nnonelementary in the length of the specification in S1S and doubly exponential\nfor LTL, raising the need of highly specialized algorithms. In this article, we\npresent an approach on how to reduce this state space explosion in the\nconstruction of this automaton by exploiting a monotonicity property of\nspecifications. For this, we introduce window counting constraints that allow\nfor step-wise refinement or abstraction of specifications. In an iterative\nsynthesis procedure, those window counting constraints are used to construct\nautomata representing over- or under-approximations (depending on the counting\nconstraint) of constraint-compliant behavior. Analysis results on winning\nregions of previous iterations are used to reduce the size of the next\nautomaton, leading to an overall reduction of the state space explosion extent.\nWe present the implementation results of the iterated synthesis for a zero-sum\ngame setting as proof of concept.

Here, we propose using\ncircularly polarized light to tune the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY)\ninteraction in two-dimensional $d$-wave altermagnets. Using the real-space\nretarded Green's functions approach, our results show that while the Heisenberg\nand Ising exchanges dominate, a notable Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction\nalso plays a key role. Furthermore, the inherent strength of altermagnetism\nimprints chirp-like signatures into the magnetic responses, which can be\ndynamically tuned via light. We mainly demonstrate that gate-induced Rashba\nspin-orbit coupling is essential in response to light -- light selectively and\nanisotropically adjusts the DM interaction without affecting the other\nexchanges. Our findings further indicate that rotating the altermagnet by\n$45^\\circ$ relative to the light's polarization direction generates a\nDirac-like dispersion and different DM interactions. We finally extract\ncritical thresholds where light reverses DM interactions along one axis or\nbalances both in-plane components. The anisotropic light-driven control of RKKY\ninteractions in 2D altermagnets not only highlights their unique properties but\nalso opens new avenues for engineering tailored magnetic characteristics in\nspintronic applications.",

    "abstract": "Traditional image classification requires a predefined list of semantic\ncategories. In contrast, Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) can sidestep this\nrequirement by classifying images directly using natural language (e.g.,\nanswering the prompt \"What is the main object in the image?\"). Despite this\nremarkable capability, most existing studies on LMM classification performance\nare surprisingly limited in scope, often assuming a closed-world setting with a\npredefined set of categories. In this work, we address this gap by thoroughly\nevaluating LMM classification performance in a truly open-world setting. We\nfirst formalize the task and introduce an evaluation protocol, defining various\nmetrics to assess the alignment between predicted and ground truth classes. We\nthen evaluate 13 models across 10 benchmarks, encompassing prototypical,\nnon-prototypical, fine-grained, and very fine-grained classes, demonstrating\nthe challenges LMMs face in this task. Further analyses based on the proposed\nmetrics reveal the types of errors LMMs make, highlighting challenges related\nto granularity and fine-grained capabilities, showing how tailored prompting\nand reasoning can alleviate them.",

    "abstract": "A formal series in noncommuting variables $\\Sigma$ over the rationals is a\nmapping $\\Sigma^* \\to \\mathbb Q$. We say that a series is commutative if the\nvalue in the output does not depend on the order of the symbols in the input.\nThe commutativity problem for a class of series takes as input a (finite\npresentation of) a series from the class and amounts to establishing whether it\nis commutative. This is a very natural, albeit nontrivial problem, which has\nnot been considered before from an algorithmic perspective.\n  We show that commutativity is decidable for all classes of series that\nconstitute a so-called effective prevariety, a notion generalising Reutenauer's\nvarieties of formal series. For example, the class of rational series,\nintroduced by Sch\\\"utzenberger in the 1960's, is well-known to be an effective\n(pre)variety, and thus commutativity is decidable for it.\n  In order to showcase the applicability of our result, we consider classes of\nformal series generalising the rational ones. We consider polynomial automata,\nshuffle automata, and infiltration automata, and we show that each of these\nmodels recognises an effective prevariety of formal series. Consequently, their\ncommutativity problem is decidable, which is a novel result. We find it\nremarkable that commutativity can be decided in a uniform way for such\ndisparate computation models.\n  Finally, we present applications of commutativity outside the theory of\nformal series. We show that we can decide solvability in sequences and in power\nseries for restricted classes of algebraic difference and differential\nequations, for which such problems are undecidable in full generality. Thanks\nto this, we can prove that the syntaxes of multivariate polynomial recursive\nsequences and of constructible differentially algebraic power series are\neffective, which are new results which were left open in previous work.",

While recent attempts have adapted\npre-trained text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion (SD), into\ngenerators of 3D representations (e.g., Triplane), they often suffer from poor\nquality due to the lack of sufficient high-quality 3D training data. Aiming at\novercoming the data shortage, we propose a novel training scheme, termed as\nProgressive Rendering Distillation (PRD), eliminating the need for 3D\nground-truths by distilling multi-view diffusion models and adapting SD into a\nnative 3D generator. In each iteration of training, PRD uses the U-Net to\nprogressively denoise the latent from random noise for a few steps, and in each\nstep it decodes the denoised latent into 3D output. Multi-view diffusion\nmodels, including MVDream and RichDreamer, are used in joint with SD to distill\ntext-consistent textures and geometries into the 3D outputs through score\ndistillation. Since PRD supports training without 3D ground-truths, we can\neasily scale up the training data and improve generation quality for\nchallenging text prompts with creative concepts. Meanwhile, PRD can accelerate\nthe inference speed of the generation model in just a few steps. With PRD, we\ntrain a Triplane generator, namely TriplaneTurbo, which adds only $2.5\\%$\ntrainable parameters to adapt SD for Triplane generation. TriplaneTurbo\noutperforms previous text-to-3D generators in both efficiency and quality.\nSpecifically, it can produce high-quality 3D meshes in 1.2 seconds and\ngeneralize well for challenging text input.

    "abstract": "Path integral methods, like the quasi-adiabatic propagator path integral\n(QUAPI), are widely used in general-purpose and highly accurate numerical\nbenchmark simulations of open quantum systems, particularly in regimes\ninaccessible to perturbative methods. Nevertheless, the applicability of the\nQUAPI method to realistic systems of interest is restricted by the\nexponentially growing computer memory requirements with respect to the size of\nthe quantum system and the time range of non-Markovian correlation effects.\nThis exponential ''wall'' becomes even more severe for multiple non-commuting\nfluctuating environments. In the present work, we address the numerical\nefficiency and accuracy of approximations that have been introduced for the\nQUAPI method with a single general environment, for the case of two independent\nnon-commuting environments where one of them is considered as a pure dephasing\nenvironment. Specifically, we consider a sharply defined cut-off of the memory\ntime, path filtering and mask assisted coarse graining of influence functional\ncoefficients (MACGIC-QUAPI) as approximations. We demonstrate that commonly\napplied numerical techniques such as path filtering cannot be straightforwardly\ntransferred to the two bath case even in the weak-coupling and quasi-Markovian\nlimits. On the other hand, the sharply defined memory cut-off can be accurately\nhandled with the mask assisted coarse graining (MACGIC-QUAPI) approach. Our\nfindings demonstrates that if system coupling operators to different baths do\nnot commute, the additive nature of the statistically independent environments\nmay be misleading. Particularly, the quasi-Markovian nature of a pure dephasing\nbath is lost, once there simultaneously exists another non-commuting source of\nfluctuations.",

To understand how randomness in the selection mechanism\naffects the long-term patterns of evolution, we studied an idealized evolution\nmodel.

To enhance model\nrobustness, we incorporate the proposed DER strategy, which equips the model\nwith dual capabilities of noise resistance and cross-domain generalization,\nthereby improving the naturalness and fluency of zero-shot motion generation\nfor unseen speech inputs. To mitigate inherent limitations of autoregressive\ninference, including error accumulation and limited self-correction, we propose\nan iterative reconstruction inference (IRI) strategy. IRI refines motion\nsequences via cyclic pose reconstruction, driven by two key components: (1)\nclassifier-free guidance improves distribution alignment between generated and\nreal gestures without auxiliary supervision, and (2) a temporal smoothing\nprocess eliminates abrupt inter-frame transitions while ensuring kinematic\ncontinuity. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate ReCoM's\neffectiveness, achieving state-of-the-art performance across metrics. Notably,\nit reduces the Fr\\'echet Gesture Distance (FGD) from 18.70 to 2.48,\ndemonstrating an 86.7% improvement in motion realism. Our project page is\nhttps://yong-xie-xy.github.io/ReCoM/.",

    "abstract": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are highly regarded for their energy\nefficiency, inherent activation sparsity, and suitability for real-time\nprocessing in edge devices. However, most current SNN methods adopt\narchitectures resembling traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs), leading\nto suboptimal performance when applied to SNNs. While SNNs excel in energy\nefficiency, they have been associated with lower accuracy levels than\ntraditional ANNs when utilizing conventional architectures. In response, in\nthis work we present LightSNN, a rapid and efficient Neural Network\nArchitecture Search (NAS) technique specifically tailored for SNNs that\nautonomously leverages the most suitable architecture, striking a good balance\nbetween accuracy and efficiency by enforcing sparsity. Based on the spiking NAS\nnetwork (SNASNet) framework, a cell-based search space including backward\nconnections is utilized to build our training-free pruning-based NAS mechanism.\nOur technique assesses diverse spike activation patterns across different data\nsamples using a sparsity-aware Hamming distance fitness evaluation. Thorough\nexperiments are conducted on both static (CIFAR10 and CIFAR100) and\nneuromorphic datasets (DVS128-Gesture). Our LightSNN model achieves\nstate-of-the-art results on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100, improves performance on\nDVS128Gesture by 4.49\\%, and significantly reduces search time most notably\noffering a $98\\times$ speedup over SNASNet and running 30\\% faster than the\nbest existing method on DVS128Gesture.

However, the adoption of computing\nin these domains is hindered by strict area and power constraints, limiting the\neffectiveness of general-purpose microprocessors. This paper proposes a bespoke\nmicroprocessor design approach to address these challenges, by tailoring the\ndesign to specific applications and eliminating unnecessary logic. Targeting\nmachine learning applications, we further optimize core operations by\nintegrating a SIMD MAC unit supporting 4 precision configurations that boost\nthe efficiency of microprocessors. Our evaluation across 6 ML models and the\nlarge-scale Zero-Riscy core, shows that our methodology can achieve\nimprovements of 22.2%, 23.6%, and 33.79% in area, power, and speed,\nrespectively, without compromising accuracy. Against state-of-the-art printed\nprocessors, our approach can still offer significant speedups, but along with\nsome accuracy degradation. This work explores how such trade-offs can enable\nlow-power printed microprocessors for diverse ML applications.",

This capability enables us to\npredict events, plan action and navigate environments, all of which rely on a\ncomposite sense of objecthood. Despite its importance, there is no single,\nunified account of objecthood, though multiple theoretical frameworks provide\ninsights. In the first part of this paper, we present a comprehensive overview\nof the main theoretical frameworks in objecthood research - Gestalt psychology,\nenactive cognition, and developmental psychology - and identify the core\ncapabilities each framework attributes to object understanding, as well as what\nfunctional roles they play in shaping world models in biological agents. Given\nthe foundational role of objecthood in world modelling, understanding\nobjecthood is also essential in AI. In the second part of the paper, we\nevaluate how current AI paradigms approach and test objecthood capabilities\ncompared to those in cognitive science. We define an AI paradigm as a\ncombination of how objecthood is conceptualised, the methods used for studying\nobjecthood, the data utilised, and the evaluation techniques. We find that,\nwhilst benchmarks can detect that AI systems model isolated aspects of\nobjecthood, the benchmarks cannot detect when AI systems lack functional\nintegration across these capabilities, not solving the objecthood challenge\nfully. Finally, we explore novel evaluation approaches that align with the\nintegrated vision of objecthood outlined in this paper. These methods are\npromising candidates for advancing from isolated object capabilities toward\ngeneral-purpose AI with genuine object understanding in real-world contexts.",

    "abstract": "Bode plots represent an essential tool in control and systems engineering. In\norder to perform an initial qualitative analysis of the considered systems, the\nconstruction of asymptotic Bode plots is often sufficient. The standard methods\nfor constructing asymptotic Bode plots are characterized by the same drawbacks:\nthey are not systematic, may be not precise and time-consuming. This is because\nthey require the detailed analysis of the different factors composing the\nconsidered transfer function, meaning that more and more intermediate steps are\nrequired as the number of factors increases. In this paper, a new method for\nthe construction of asymptotic Bode plots is proposed, which is based on the\nsystematic calculations of the so-called generalized approximating functions\nand on the use of well defined properties. The proposed method is referred to\nas a direct method since it allows to directly draw the asymptotic Bode\nmagnitude and phase plots of the complete transfer function without requiring\nthe detailed analysis nor the plots construction of each factor. This latter\nfeature also makes the proposed direct method more systematic, potentially more\nprecise and less time-consuming compared to standard methods, especially when\ndealing with a large number of factors in the transfer function. The comparison\nof the proposed direct method with the standard approaches is performed, in\norder to examine the benefits offered by the direct method.",

Firstly, we explore enhancing DETR-like detectors by explicit\nposition relation prior from point-level to instance-level, since map elements\ncontain strong shape priors. Secondly, we propose a key-frame-based\nhierarchical temporal fusion module, which interacts temporal information from\nlocal to global. Lastly, the separate classification branch and regression\nbranch lead to the problem of misalignment in the output distribution. We\ninteract semantic information with geometric information by introducing a novel\ngeometric-aware classification loss in optimization and a geometric-aware\nmatching cost in label assignment. InteractionMap achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance on both nuScenes and Argoverse2 benchmarks.",

A validated numerical model is used\nto study the impact of particle seeding fluctuations on flame stability.\nSimulations are conducted for the Bunsen setup in the right-side up and up-side\ndown configuration. No significant differences in flame response are identified\nin flame stability between the right-side up and up-side down configurations.\nWe find that the Bunsen flame is surprisingly robust to abrupt changes in\nparticle loading. The sudden change in particle loading does not excite any\nintrinsic instabilities in the flame. Based on our results, the iron dust\nflames are robust to imposed fluctuations. We hypothesize that this is due to\nthe lack of a feedback mechanism between the burned temperature and the heat\nrelease rate. This mechanism is present in conventional, chemistry-driven,\ngaseous flames. However, such a mechanism is absent in iron dust flames because\nthe combustion of individual iron particles is limited by oxygen diffusion,\nwhich is insensitive to temperature.",

In light\nof the LCFT connection, we investigate such infinite series in terms of the\nphysics data, i.e., the operator spectrum and OPE coefficients of the CFT and\nthe conformal block expansion. These considerations lead to novel\napproximations for $1/\\pi$.

To achieve this, we use the\nparametric crossing symmetric dispersion relation which was recently developed\nfor string amplitudes. Quite strikingly, we find remarkable simplifications in\nthe new representations, where, in the Legendre relation, the entire\ncontribution to $1/\\pi$ comes from the logarithmic identity operator, hinting\nat a universal property of LCFTs.

Their\nresult is a reduction from approximately counting the number of hyperedges in\nan implicit $k$-partite hypergraph to a polylogarithmic number of calls to a\nhyperedge oracle that returns whether a given subhypergraph contains an edge.\n  The main result of this paper is a generalization of the DLM result for {\\em\noutput-sensitive} approximate counting, where the running time of the desired\ncounting algorithm is inversely proportional to the number of witnesses. Our\ntheorem is a reduction from approximately counting the (unknown) number of\nhyperedges in an implicit $k$-partite hypergraph to a polylogarithmic number of\ncalls to a hyperedge oracle called only on subhypergraphs with a small\n``measure''. If a subhypergraph has $u_i$ nodes in the $i$th node partition of\nthe $k$-partite hypergraph, then its measure is $\\prod_i u_i$.\n  Using the new general reduction and by efficiently implementing\nmeasure-bounded colorful independence oracles, we obtain new improved\noutput-sensitive approximate counting algorithms for $k$-clique, $k$-dominating\nset and $k$-sum.

    "abstract": "This paper explores the risk that a large language model (LLM) trained for\ncode generation on data mined from software repositories will generate content\nthat discloses sensitive information included in its training data. We\ndecompose this risk, known in the literature as ``unintended memorization,''\ninto two components: unintentional disclosure (where an LLM presents secrets to\nusers without the user seeking them out) and malicious disclosure (where an LLM\npresents secrets to an attacker equipped with partial knowledge of the training\ndata). We observe that while existing work mostly anticipates malicious\ndisclosure, unintentional disclosure is also a concern. We describe methods to\nassess unintentional and malicious disclosure risks side-by-side across\ndifferent releases of training datasets and models. We demonstrate these\nmethods through an independent assessment of the Open Language Model (OLMo)\nfamily of models and its Dolma training datasets. Our results show, first, that\nchanges in data source and processing are associated with substantial changes\nin unintended memorization risk; second, that the same set of operational\nchanges may increase one risk while mitigating another; and, third, that the\nrisk of disclosing sensitive information varies not only by prompt strategies\nor test datasets but also by the types of sensitive information. These\ncontributions rely on data mining to enable greater privacy and security\ntesting required for the LLM training data supply chain.",

DiplomaticMonitor\nconsistently outperforms its counterparts in structure, completeness, and\ntimeliness, accurately reflecting ambassadorial appointment cycles and\nmaintaining high precision across contact and personnel records. EmbassyPages,\ndespite strong search engine visibility and widespread usage, exhibits\nsignificant data currency issues, with markedly diminished ambassadorial\naccuracy attributable to delayed refresh cycles. WikiData offers valuable\nhistorical documentation and open-source accessibility but lacks the\nconsistency and verification protocols necessary for reliable real-time\ndiplomatic information. Our findings highlight the critical challenge posed by\nthe absence of a standardized global diplomatic mission registry.

Streamline engineering enables customizable rotational\ndynamics, including hybrid orbital_cyclonic motions reminiscent of tropical\nstorms, with promising applications in precision optomechanics, optofluidics,\nand optical analogues of fluid dynamics. This energy-flow perspective offers a\nversatile platform for designing and quantifying OAM across structured light.",

Our approach employs a diffusion model to integrate latent motion\nfeatures, enabling more precise and nuanced gesture representation. By\nleveraging weakly supervised deviations in latent space, we effectively\ngenerate hand gestures and mouth movements, crucial for realistic video\nproduction. Experiments show our method significantly improves video quality,\nsurpassing current state-of-the-art techniques.",

Employing a diverse set of books and\nmultiple LLM architectures, we examine whether these models can synthesize\nmeaningful narratives that align with established human interpretations.\nEvaluation is performed with a LLM-as-a-judge paradigm: each AI-generated\nsummary is compared against a high-quality, human-written summary via a\ncross-model assessment, where all participating LLMs evaluate not only their\nown outputs but also those produced by others. This methodology enables the\nidentification of potential biases, such as the proclivity for models to favor\ntheir own summarization style over others. In addition, alignment between the\nhuman-crafted and LLM-generated summaries is quantified using ROUGE and\nBERTScore metrics, assessing the depth of grammatical and semantic\ncorrespondence. The results reveal nuanced variations in content representation\nand stylistic preferences among the models, highlighting both strengths and\nlimitations inherent in relying on internal knowledge for summarization tasks.\nThese findings contribute to a deeper understanding of LLM internal encodings\nof factual information and the dynamics of cross-model evaluation, with\nimplications for the development of more robust natural language generative\nsystems.",

A simple theoretical model provides a physical understanding of\nthe major experimentally observed features. With experimentally fitted\nparameter values, the dominant contribution to the degree of circular\npolarization is shown to arise from spin polarization and not from valley\npolarization, a consequence of the spin-valley-layer coupling characteristic of\na TMDC bilayer.

    "abstract": "The threads of photonics are eagerly awaited to redefine the future of\nneuromorphic data processing, especially as the computing-intensive artificial\nintelligence models become an unavoidable part of our everyday lives. Still,\nthere is much to be improved within the domain of photonic nonlinear activation\nfunctions, as the programmable, all-optical, energy-efficient nonlinearities\nremain beyond the grasp of today's state of the art. In this paper, we address\nthe issue at hand and propose a novel approach in the realization of\nhigh-performing all-optical photonic activations. Through simulations and\nexperiments, we show that Fabry-Perot laser diodes (FP-LDs) exhibit richness\nand high programmability of their nonlinear response to input optical pulses\nwith widths as low as 25 ps. We demonstrate a variety of sigmoid-like and\ninverted PReLU-like trends to be used as all-optical activation functions in\nphotonic neural networks, testing their performance in stringent, real-life\ntraining scenarios with randomized data patterns at repetition rates up to 10\nGHz. The programmability of activations is shown using a multitude of\nexperimental operating parameters, among which we highlight the power variation\nof an additional continuous wave laser, injected into the FP-LD, enriching our\napproach with all-optical control of all-optical activations. With very low\nstatic power consumption of our active element, we achieve a record-breaking\nenergy draw on the order of pJ to hundreds of fJ per nonlinear operation.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in Text-to-SQL, driven by large language models, are\ndemocratizing data access. Despite these advancements, enterprise deployments\nremain challenging due to the need to capture business-specific knowledge,\nhandle complex queries, and meet expectations of continuous improvements. To\naddress these issues, we designed and implemented GenEdit: our Text-to-SQL\ngeneration system that improves with user feedback. GenEdit builds and\nmaintains a company-specific knowledge set, employs a pipeline of operators\ndecomposing SQL generation, and uses feedback to update its knowledge set to\nimprove future SQL generations.\n  We describe GenEdit's architecture made of two core modules: (i) decomposed\nSQL generation; and (ii) knowledge set edits based on user feedback. For\ngeneration, GenEdit leverages compounding operators to improve knowledge\nretrieval and to create a plan as chain-of-thought steps that guides\ngeneration. GenEdit first retrieves relevant examples in an initial retrieval\nstage where original SQL queries are decomposed into sub-statements, clauses or\nsub-queries. It then also retrieves instructions and schema elements. Using the\nretrieved contextual information, GenEdit then generates step-by-step plan in\nnatural language on how to produce the query. Finally, GenEdit uses the plan to\ngenerate SQL, minimizing the need for model reasoning, which enhances complex\nSQL generation. If necessary, GenEdit regenerates the query based on syntactic\nand semantic errors. The knowledge set edits are recommended through an\ninteractive copilot, allowing users to iterate on their feedback and to\nregenerate SQL queries as needed. Each generation uses staged edits which\nupdate the generation prompt. Once the feedback is submitted, it gets merged\nafter passing regression testing and obtaining an approval, improving future\ngenerations.",

To address\nthis gap, we propose {\\bf PS-ReID}, a multimodal model that combines image and\ntext inputs to enhance ReID performance. In contrast to existing ReID methods\nlimited by cropped pedestrian images, our PS-ReID focuses on full-scene\nsettings and introduces a multimodal ReID task that incorporates segmentation,\nenabling precise feature extraction of the queried individual, even under\nchallenging conditions such as occlusion. To this end, our model adopts a\ndual-path asymmetric encoding scheme that explicitly separates query and target\nroles: the query branch captures identity-discriminative cues, while the target\nbranch performs holistic scene reasoning. Additionally, a token-level ReID loss\nsupervises identity-aware tokens, coupling retrieval and segmentation to yield\nmasks that are both spatially precise and identity-consistent. To facilitate\nsystematic evaluation, we construct M2ReID, currently the largest full-scene\nmultimodal ReID dataset, with over 200K images and 4,894 identities, featuring\nmultimodal queries and high-quality segmentation masks. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that PS-ReID significantly outperforms unimodal query-based models\nin both ReID and segmentation tasks.

Results: We collected a\ndataset of 972 trials performed by 18 residents of different surgical\nspecializations. Participants demonstrated consistent performance improvement\nacross all tasks. In addition, we found variations in between-shift learning\nand forgetting across metrics and tasks, and hints for possible effects of\nfatigue. Conclusion: The findings from our first analysis shed light on the\nlong-term learning processes of robotic surgical skills with extended intervals\nand varying levels of fatigue. Significance: This study lays the groundwork for\nfuture research aimed at optimizing training protocols and enhancing AI\napplications in surgery, ultimately contributing to improved patient outcomes.\nThe dataset will be made available upon acceptance of our journal submission.",

Under certain assumptions, it allows us to describe each\nmultidimensional oscillator by a single phase variable, giving rise to simple\nphase models such as the Kuramoto model. Classically, the method has been\napplied in the case where the interactions are only pairwise (two-body).\nHowever, increasing evidence shows that interactions in real-world systems are\nnot pairwise but higher-order, i.e., many-body. Although synchronization in\nhigher-order systems has received much attention, analytical results are scarce\nbecause of the highly nonlinear nature of the framework. In this paper, we fill\nthe gap by presenting a general theory of phase reduction for the case of\nhigher-order interactions. We show that the higher-order topology is preserved\nin the phase reduced model at the first order and that only odd couplings have\nan effect on the dynamics when certain symmetries are present. Additionally, we\nshow the power and ductility of the phase reduction approach by applying it to\na population of Stuart-Landau oscillators with an all-to-all configuration and\nwith a ring-like hypergraph topology; in both cases, only the analysis of the\nphase model can provide insights and analytical results.",

We investigate the consequences of competing\ninteractions in a half-filled one-band Hubbard model on a simple cubic lattice,\nincorporating hopping processes up to third-nearest-neighbors, to explore the\nunderlying magnetotransport properties. Our magnetic phase diagrams at low\ntemperatures, obtained using semi-classical Monte Carlo analysis, reveal that\nthe long-range interactions can disrupt one form of magnetic phase while\ncreating a new type of magnetic order. For the nonperturbative regime (on-site\nHubbard repulsive strength $U \\sim$ bandwidth) the C-type antiferromagnetic\nground state is preferred over the G-type antiferromagnetic phase when the\ninteraction between second-nearest neighbor sites becomes significant to the\nnearest-neighbor interactions. However, interactions beyond the\nsecond-nearest-neighbors are required to stabilize the A-type antiferromagnetic\nground state.

Be it in particle\nsimulations or observations, filaments are always tracers of a perturbation in\nthe equilibrium of the studied system and hold essential information on its\nhistory and future evolution. However, the recovery of such structures is often\ncomplicated by the presence of a large amount of background and transverse\nnoise in the observation space. While the former is generally detrimental to\nthe analysis, the latter can be attributed to measurement errors and it can\nhold essential information about the structure. To further complicate the\nscenario, 1D manifolds (filaments) are generally non-linear and their geometry\ndifficult to extract and model. In order to study hidden manifolds within the\ndataset, particular care has to be devoted to background noise removal and\ntransverse noise modelling, while still maintaining accuracy in the recovery of\ntheir geometrical structure. We propose 1-DREAM: a toolbox composed of five\nmain Machine Learning methodologies whose aim is to facilitate manifold\nextraction in such cases. Each methodology has been designed to address issues\nwhen dealing with complicated low-dimensional structures convoluted with noise\nand it has been extensively tested in previously published works. In this work\nall methodologies are presented in detail, joint within a cohesive framework\nand demonstrated for three interesting astronomical cases: a simulated\njellyfish galaxy, a filament extracted from a simulated cosmic web and the\nstellar stream of Omega-Centauri as observed with the GAIA DR2. Two newly\ndeveloped visualization techniques are also proposed, that take full advantage\nof the results obtained with 1-DREAM. The code is made publicly available to\nbenefit the community.

We propose AlignDiff, a diffusion model conditioned on geometric\npriors, enabling the simultaneous estimation of camera distortions and scene\ngeometry. To enhance distortion prediction, we incorporate edge-aware\nattention, focusing the model on geometric features around image edges, rather\nthan semantic content. Furthermore, to enhance generalizability to real-world\ncaptures, we incorporate a large database of ray-traced lenses containing over\nthree thousand samples. This database characterizes the distortion inherent in\na diverse variety of lens forms.

I discuss supersymmetric solutions of this\ntheory, based on limits of the M2 and M5 solutions. These limits involve either\na scaling of the number of branes or a smearing in certain directions, and have\nbeen argued to produce non-Lorentzian bulk geometries appearing in novel\nversions of the AdS/CFT correspondence. I show that the scaled solutions are\nsolutions of the maximally supersymmetric version of the non-relativistic\nsupergravity, while the smeared solutions only give solutions of the\nhalf-maximally supersymmetric version. I show these solutions are all\nsupersymmetric by solving the Killing spinor equations, and discuss usual and\nunusual forms of supersymmetry enhancement. I also discuss a simple\nsupersymmetric AdS_3 background, and point out that the BTZ black hole is a\nsolution of non-relativistic 11-dimensional supergravity.",

It states that for every IID sequence of random variables, the\nempirical measure converges to the underlying distribution (in the sense of\nuniform convergence of the CDF). In this work, we provide tools to study such\nlimits of empirical measures in categorical probability.\n  We propose two axioms, permutation invariance and empirical adequacy, that a\nmorphism of type $X^\\mathbb{N} \\to X$ should satisfy to be interpretable as\ntaking an infinite sequence as input and producing a sample from its empirical\nmeasure as output. Since not all sequences have a well-defined empirical\nmeasure, ``such empirical sampling morphisms'' live in quasi-Markov categories,\nwhich, unlike Markov categories, allow partial morphisms. Given an empirical\nsampling morphism and a few other properties, we prove representability as well\nas abstract versions of the de Finetti theorem, the Glivenko-Cantelli theorem\nand the strong law of large numbers.\n  We provide several concrete constructions of empirical sampling morphisms as\npartially defined Markov kernels on standard Borel spaces. Instantiating our\nabstract results then recovers the standard Glivenko-Cantelli theorem and the\nstrong law of large numbers for random variables with finite first moment. Our\nwork thus provides a joint proof of these two theorems in conjunction with the\nde Finetti theorem from first principles.",

The\nMinistry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, has introduced the\nElectronic Health Record Minimum Data Set (EHRMDS) to facilitate uniformity in\nclinical documentation. However, the compatibility of Open-Source Electronic\nHealth Record Systems (OS-EHRS) with EHRMDS remains largely unexplored. This\nstudy conducts a systematic assessment of the alignment between EHRMDS and\ncommonly utilized OS-EHRS to determine the most appropriate system for\nhealthcare environments in India. A quantitative closeness analysis was\nperformed by comparing the metadata elements of EHRMDS with those of 10\nselected OS-EHRS. Using crosswalk methodologies based on syntactic and semantic\nsimilarity, the study measured the extent of metadata alignment. Results\nindicate that OpenEMR exhibits the highest compatibility with EHRMDS, covering\n73.81% of its metadata elements, while OpenClinic shows the least alignment at\n33.33%. Additionally, the analysis identified 47 metadata elements present in\nOS-EHRS but absent in EHRMDS, suggesting the need for an extended metadata\nschema. By bridging gaps in clinical metadata, this study contributes to\nenhancing the interoperability of EHR systems in India. The findings provide\nvaluable insights for healthcare policymakers and organizations seeking to\nadopt OS-EHRS aligned with national standards. Keywords.

Next, a\nfeature-separating self-supervised learning (FS-SSL) model generates\nself-supervised embeddings for the magnitude and phase components separately.\nThese embeddings are fused to create cross-domain feature representations.\nFinally, two parallel RNN-enhanced multi-attention (REMA) mask decoders refine\nthe features, apply them to the mask, and reconstruct the speech signal.

Videos of people cooking are a valuable source of information for\nsuch task, but introduces a lot of variability in terms of how to translate\nthis data to a robotic environment. This research aims to streamline this\nprocess, focusing on the task plan generation step, by using a Large Language\nModel (LLM)-based Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) framework to autonomously\ngenerate cooking task plans from videos with subtitles, and execute them.\nConventional LLM-based task planning methods are not well-suited for\ninterpreting the cooking video data due to uncertainty in the videos, and the\nrisk of hallucination in its output. To address both of these problems, we\nexplore using LLMs in combination with Functional Object-Oriented Networks\n(FOON), to validate the plan and provide feedback in case of failure.

To overcome the limitations of 3D\nimaging, parametric stochastic 3D microstructure modeling is a powerful tool to\ngenerate many virtual but realistic structures at the cost of computer\nsimulations. The present paper uses 90,000 virtually generated 3D\nmicrostructures of porous media derived from literature by systematically\nvarying parameters of stochastic 3D microstructure models. Previously, this\ndata set has been used to establish quantitative microstructure-property\nrelationships. The present paper extends these findings by applying a hybrid AI\nframework to this data set. More precisely, symbolic regression, powered by\ndeep neural networks, genetic algorithms, and graph attention networks, is used\nto derive precise and robust analytical equations. These equations model the\nrelationships between structural descriptors and effective transport properties\nwithout requiring manual specification of the underlying functional\nrelationship. By integrating AI with traditional computational methods, the\nhybrid AI framework not only generates predictive equations but also enhances\nconventional modeling approaches by capturing relationships influenced by\nspecific microstructural features traditionally underrepresented.

By measuring both the particle imbalance\nand subsystem entanglement entropy, we monitor the entire heating process over\n1,000 driving cycles and observe the existence of the prethermal plateau. The\nprethermal lifetime is `doubly tunable': one way by driving frequency, the\nother by multipolar order; it grows algebraically with the frequency with the\nuniversal scaling exponent $2n{+}1$. Using quantum state tomography on\ndifferent subsystems, we demonstrate a non-uniform spatial entanglement\ndistribution and observe a crossover from area-law to volume-law entanglement\nscaling.

We address\ntwo central challenges: clarifying the connections between different deep\ngenerative models and deepening our understanding of their learning mechanisms.\nWe focus on Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), known for their universal\napproximation capabilities for discrete distributions. By introducing a\nreciprocal space formulation, we reveal a connection between RBMs, diffusion\nprocesses, and coupled Bosons. We show that at initialization, the RBM operates\nat a saddle point, where the local curvature is determined by the singular\nvalues, whose distribution follows the Marcenko-Pastur law and exhibits\nrotational symmetry. During training, this rotational symmetry is broken due to\nhierarchical learning, where different degrees of freedom progressively capture\nfeatures at multiple levels of abstraction. This leads to a symmetry breaking\nin the energy landscape, reminiscent of Landau theory. This symmetry breaking\nin the energy landscape is characterized by the singular values and the weight\nmatrix eigenvector matrix. We derive the corresponding free energy in a\nmean-field approximation. We show that in the limit of infinite size RBM, the\nreciprocal variables are Gaussian distributed. Our findings indicate that in\nthis regime, there will be some modes for which the diffusion process will not\nconverge to the Boltzmann distribution. To illustrate our results, we trained\nreplicas of RBMs with different hidden layer sizes using the MNIST dataset.

The significant contribution of this study lies in deriving its\nasymptotic properties. The proposed method ensures high efficiency in the model\nestimation while providing reliable inference despite data contamination.\nMoreover, the density power divergence measure is governed by a tuning\nparameter $\\gamma$, which controls the trade-off between robustness and\nefficiency. To effectively determine the optimal value of $\\gamma$, this study\nemploys a generalized score-matching technique, marking considerable progress\nin the data analysis. Simulation studies and real data examples are provided to\nillustrate the performance of the estimator and to substantiate the theory\ndeveloped.",

    "abstract": "Classical general relativity predicts a singularity at the center of a black\nhole, where known laws of physics break down. This suggests the existence of\ndeeper, yet unknown principles of Nature. Among various theoretical\npossibilities, one of the most promising proposals is a transition to a de\nSitter phase at the BH core. This transition, originally proposed by Gliner and\nSakharov, ensures the regularity of metric coefficients and avoids the\nsingularity. In search for such a regular BH solution with finite curvature\nscalar, we propose a metric $g_{rr}$ that exhibits a dS core in the central\nregion. An appealing feature of this metric is the existence of a $single$\nevent horizon resembling the Schwarzschild black hole. Furthermore, the entire\nspacetime geometry is determined by the black hole mass alone, in agreement\nwith the Isarel-Carter $no-hair$ $theorem$ for a charge-less, non-rotating\nblack hole. To determine the gravitational action consistent with such a\nsolution, we consider a general Lagrangian density $f(R)$ in place of the\nEinstein-Hilbert action. By numerically solving the resulting field equation,\nwe find that, in addition to the Einstein-Hilbert term, a Pad\\'e approximant in\nthe Ricci scalar $R$ can produce such regular black hole solutions. To assess\nthe physical viability of these black hole solutions, we verify that the\nproposed metric satisfies the principal energy conditions: DEC, WEC, and NEC,\nthroughout spacetime. Furthermore, in agreement with Zaslavskii's regularity\ncriterion, the metric satisfies the SEC in the range $r\\geq r_h/2$, where $r_h$\nis the event horizon. Furthermore, with the proposed regularized metric, the\nexpansion scalar in the Raychaudhuri equation remains finite and its derivative\nvanishes at $r=0$, thereby preventing formation of caustic. This confirms that\nthe spacetime is geodesically complete and free from true physical\nsingularities.",

    "abstract": "Imperfect detection efficiency remains one of the major obstacles in\nachieving loophole-free Bell tests over long distances. At the same time, the\nchallenge of establishing a common reference frame for measurements becomes\nmore pronounced as the separation between parties increases. In this work, we\ntackle both of these issues by examining the impact of limited detection\nefficiency on the probability of Bell inequality violation with Haar random\nmeasurement settings. We derive analytical lower bounds on the violation\nprobability for a two-qubit maximally entangled state, which is tight for\ncorrelation inequalities and perfect detection efficiencies. We further\ninvestigate it numerically for more qubits and settings using two detection\nefficiency models and an original method based on linear programming. Beyond\nthat, we show that the so-called typicality of Bell inequality violation, i.e.,\nalmost certain violation of local realism with sufficiently many particles or\nrandom measurement directions, holds even if the detection efficiency is\nlimited. Our findings reveal that increasing the number of measurement settings\ncan compensate for efficiency losses above the critical threshold. We determine\ncritical detection efficiencies for both two-party and three-party scenarios.\nFor two parties, we recover previously established results, while for three\nparties, we derive a symmetric critical efficiency of $\\eta_{crit} = 2/3$ for\nthe W and GHZ states within the binning model. In cases involving the\nno-detection outcome, we present a modified inequality using a pair of\northogonal observables for each party with $\\eta_{crit} \\approx 0.7208$, which\nis notably less than 0.75 for the GHZ state. These results offer deeper\ninsights into the limitations and possibilities for certifying non-locality in\nthe presence of limited detection efficiency, shedding light on its robustness\nin practical Bell tests.",

While it gives a useful description of chiral dynamics (mainly in\nQCD), it nonetheless omits the crucially important internal wave-function of a\ntwo-body bound state, $\\phi(r)$. This becomes significant near critical\ncoupling where $\\phi(r)$ extends to large distance, leading to dilution and\nsuppression of induced couplings $\\propto \\phi(0)$, such as the Yukawa and\nquartic couplings, as well as reduced fine-tuning of a hierarchy. In top quark\ncondensation, where the BEH boson is a $\\bar{t}t$ bound state and we have a UV\ncompletion such as topcolor, we must go beyond the NJL model and include\neffects of $\\phi(r)$. We provide a formulation of this for the\nBrout-Englert-Higgs boson, and find that it leads to an extended $\\phi(r)$, a\nsignificantly reduced and natural composite scale of $M_0 \\sim 6$ TeV, a\nsuccessful prediction for the quartic coupling, $\\lambda$, and fine tuning that\nis reduced to a few percent, providing a compelling candidate solution to the\nnaturalness problem of the BEH boson.

A common solution leverages generative models as\npriors for both the images and the imaging system parameters (e.g., a class of\npoint spread functions). To learn these priors in a straightforward manner\nrequires access to a dataset of clean images as well as samples of the imaging\nsystem.

The LC EoR 21-cm signal ceases\nto be ergodic along the LoS, and the Fourier transform-based three-dimensional\npower spectrum (PS) fails to capture the full two-point statistics. Several\nearlier studies have used the multi-frequency angular power spectrum (MAPS)\n$\\mathcal{C}_\\ell(\\nu_1,\\nu_2)$ to overcome this limitation. However, we do not\nhave a simple interpretation of $\\mathcal{C}_\\ell(\\nu_1,\\nu_2)$ in terms of\ncomoving length scale, and the data volume is large. Here we introduce the\nevolving power spectrum (ePS) to quantify the two-point statistics of the LC\nEoR 21-cm signal. This has a simple interpretation in terms of redshift\nevolution and comoving length scales, and the binned ePS reduces the data\nvolume by several orders of magnitude compared to MAPS. Considering\nsimulations, we study the first three even angular multipoles of ePS to\nquantify the LoS anisotropy of the signal. We find that as reionization\nprogresses, at large $k$ ($ \\ge 0.6 \\, {\\rm Mpc}^{-1}$), $P_{e\\,0}(k,z)$ the\nmonopole moment decreases as $\\propto \\bar{x}_{\\rm H I}$ the mean neutral HI\nfraction, which, in principle, can be used to observationally determine the\nreionization history. Furthermore, $P_{e\\,2}(k,z)$ the quadrupole moment is\nnegative at small $k$ and positive at large $k$.

To achieve this, we first developed a competence model capturing\nthe situated and developmental nature of CT, guiding the design of activities\ntailored to cognitive abilities, age, and context. This framework clarifies how\nactivity characteristics influence CT development and how to assess these\ncompetencies. Additionally, we developed an activity for large-scale assessment\nof AT skills, offered in two variants: one based on non-digital artefacts\n(unplugged) and manual expert assessment, and the other based on digital\nartefacts (virtual) and automatic assessment. To provide a more comprehensive\nevaluation of students' competencies, we developed an IAS based on BNs with\nnoisy gates, which offers real-time probabilistic assessment for each skill\nrather than a single overall score. The results indicate that the proposed\ninstrument can measure AT competencies across different age groups and\neducational contexts in Switzerland, demonstrating its applicability for\nlarge-scale use.

We consider two\nstraightforward calibration models, linear regression (LR) and non-homogeneous\nGaussian regression (NHGR), incorporating deterministic, control and ensemble\nmean forecast covariates. We show that relatively simple calibration models\n(with at most three covariates) provide good calibration and that addition of\nfurther covariates cannot be justified. Optimal calibration models (for the\nforecast mean of a physical quantity) always make use of the deterministic\nforecast and ensemble mean forecast for the same quantity, together with a\ncovariate associated with a different physical quantity. The selection of\noptimal covariates is performed independently per forecast horizon, and the set\nof optimal covariates shows a large degree of consistency across forecast\nhorizons. As a result, it is possible to specify a consistent model to\ncalibrate a given physical quantity, incorporating a common set of three\ncovariates for all horizons. For NHGR models of a given physical quantity, the\nensemble forecast standard deviation for that quantity is skilful in predicting\nforecast error standard deviation, strikingly so for Hs. We show that the\nconsistent LR and NHGR calibration models facilitate reduction in forecast bias\nto near zero for all of Hs, W and Tm, and that there is little difference\nbetween LR and NHGR calibration for the mean. Both LR and NHGR models\nfacilitate reduction in forecast error standard deviation relative to naive\nadoption of the (uncalibrated) deterministic forecast, with NHGR providing\nsomewhat better performance.",

    "abstract": "Two of the main challenges of image restoration in real-world scenarios are\nthe accurate characterization of an image prior and the precise modeling of the\nimage degradation operator. Pre-trained diffusion models have been very\nsuccessfully used as image priors in zero-shot image restoration methods.\nHowever, how to best handle the degradation operator is still an open problem.\nIn real-world data, methods that rely on specific parametric assumptions about\nthe degradation model often face limitations in their applicability. To address\nthis, we introduce Invert2Restore, a zero-shot, training-free method that\noperates in both fully blind and partially blind settings -- requiring no prior\nknowledge of the degradation model or only partial knowledge of its parametric\nform without known parameters. Despite this, Invert2Restore achieves\nhigh-fidelity results and generalizes well across various types of image\ndegradation. It leverages a pre-trained diffusion model as a deterministic\nmapping between normal samples and undistorted image samples. The key insight\nis that the input noise mapped by a diffusion model to a degraded image lies in\na low-probability density region of the standard normal distribution. Thus, we\ncan restore the degraded image by carefully guiding its input noise toward a\nhigher-density region. We experimentally validate Invert2Restore across several\nimage restoration tasks, demonstrating that it achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance in scenarios where the degradation operator is either unknown or\npartially known.",

The proposed approach is based on\nEuler angles representing orientations of the crystals. Two pairs of the angles\nare directly related to two vectors normal to the boundary plane in the crystal\nreference frames, and the new boundary representation can be viewed as a\ntriplet composed of these vectors and the angle of rotation about the axis\nperpendicular to the plane. The representation resembles the `interface-plane\nscheme', but unlike the latter, it is a proper parameterization. Basic\npractical aspects of the parameterization (such as equivalences due to\nsymmetries, fundamental regions, uniform distribution of boundaries) are\nconsidered. The parameterization is applied to examination of\nBulatov-Reed-Kumar model of grain boundary energy and reveals its previously\nunknown features.

As in the\nclassical case [Girardi et al., arXiv:2503.18910], this definition allows for a\nclosed-form expression and has an operational interpretation as the asymptotic\nerror exponent in the hypothesis testing task of deciding whether a given\nbipartite state is product or not. We generalise the umlaut information to\nquantum channels, where it also extends the notion of `oveloh information'\n[Nuradha et al., arXiv:2404.16101]. We prove that channel umlaut information is\nadditive for classical-quantum channels, while we observe additivity violations\nfor fully quantum channels. Inspired by recent results in entanglement theory,\nwe then show as our main result that the regularised umlaut information\nconstitutes a fundamental measure of the quality of classical information\ntransmission over a quantum channel -- as opposed to the capacity, which\nquantifies the quantity of information that can be sent. This interpretation\napplies to coding assisted by activated non-signalling correlations, and the\nchannel umlaut information is in general larger than the corresponding\nexpression for unassisted communication as obtained by Dalai for the\nclassical-quantum case [IEEE Trans.

Combined with\nprior works on non-signalling--assisted zero-error channel capacities, our\nfindings imply a dichotomy between the settings of zero-rate error exponents\nand zero-error communication.

However, the inference time of DNNs is typically uncertain and cannot\nbe precisely determined in advance, presenting significant challenges in\nensuring timely task processing within deadlines. To address the uncertain\ninference time, we propose a robust optimization scheme to minimize the total\nenergy consumption of mobile devices while meeting task probabilistic\ndeadlines. The scheme only requires the mean and variance information of the\ninference time, without any prediction methods or distribution functions. The\nproblem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) that\ninvolves jointly optimizing the DNN model partitioning and the allocation of\nlocal CPU/GPU frequencies and uplink bandwidth. To tackle the problem, we first\ndecompose the original problem into two subproblems: resource allocation and\nDNN model partitioning. Subsequently, the two subproblems with probability\nconstraints are equivalently transformed into deterministic optimization\nproblems using the chance-constrained programming (CCP) method. Finally, the\nconvex optimization technique and the penalty convex-concave procedure (PCCP)\ntechnique are employed to obtain the optimal solution of the resource\nallocation subproblem and a stationary point of the DNN model partitioning\nsubproblem, respectively.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces the Procedural Content Generation Benchmark for\nevaluating generative algorithms on different game content creation tasks. The\nbenchmark comes with 12 game-related problems with multiple variants on each\nproblem. Problems vary from creating levels of different kinds to creating rule\nsets for simple arcade games. Each problem has its own content representation,\ncontrol parameters, and evaluation metrics for quality, diversity, and\ncontrollability. This benchmark is intended as a first step towards a\nstandardized way of comparing generative algorithms. We use the benchmark to\nscore three baseline algorithms: a random generator, an evolution strategy, and\na genetic algorithm. Results show that some problems are easier to solve than\nothers, as well as the impact the chosen objective has on quality, diversity,\nand controllability of the generated artifacts.",

Landmark\nscientific discoveries have enabled the transition from short message\ntransmissions via single-wire electrical telegraphs to voice communications\nthrough coaxial cables, and ultimately to the optical fibres that powered the\ninternet revolution. Central to these advancements was the invention of novel\nwaveguides to transport electromagnetic waves with lower attenuation over\nbroader spectral ranges. In the past four decades, despite extensive research,\nthe spectral bandwidth and attenuation of silica-based telecommunication fibres\nhave remained relatively unchanged. In this work, we report an optical\nwaveguide with an unprecedented bandwidth and attenuation. Its measured loss\nreaches 0.091 dB/km at 1550 nm and remains below 0.2 dB/km over 66 THz,\nsubstantially better than the 0.14 dB/km and 26 THz achievable with existing\ntechnology. Our innovative, microstructured optical fibre replaces the\ntraditional glass core with air, employing a meticulously engineered tubular\nglass structure to guide light. This approach not only reduces attenuation and\nother signal degradation phenomena, but it also increases transmission speeds\nby 50%. Furthermore, it theoretically enables further loss reductions and\noperation at wavelengths where broader bandwidth amplifiers exist, potentially\nheralding a new era in long-distance communications.",

However, most\nexisting research focuses on task assignment at the current moment, overlooking\nthe fluctuating demand and supply between tasks and workers over time. To\naddress this issue, we introduce an adaptive task assignment problem, which\naims to maximize the number of assigned tasks by dynamically adjusting task\nassignments in response to changing demand and supply. We develop a spatial\ncrowdsourcing framework, namely demand-based adaptive task assignment with\ndynamic worker availability windows, which consists of two components including\ntask demand prediction and task assignment. In the first component, we\nconstruct a graph adjacency matrix representing the demand dependency\nrelationships in different regions and employ a multivariate time series\nlearning approach to predict future task demands. In the task assignment\ncomponent, we adjust tasks to workers based on these predictions, worker\navailability windows, and the current task assignments, where each worker has\nan availability window that indicates the time periods they are available for\ntask assignments. To reduce the search space of task assignments and be\nefficient, we propose a worker dependency separation approach based on graph\npartition and a task value function with reinforcement learning.

Solid Isotropic Material with\nPenalization (SIMP) is a Topology Optimization (TO) method offering a trade-off\nbetween minimum compliance (i.e., maximum stiffness) and a fixed material\namount for a given set of boundary conditions. Since TO is a non-convex\nproblem, its gradient can be tuned by filtering the topology's contour,\ncreating sharper material profiles without necessarily compromising optimality.\nHowever, despite simplifying the layout, some filters fail to address\nmanufacturability concerns such as capillarity (thin tweaks as struts)\ngenerated by uncertain loading, vibration or fatigue.\n  A tailored density-based filtering strategy is offered to tackle this issue.\nAdditionally, volume fraction is left unconstrained so material can be\nstrategically replenished through a logarithmic rule acting on the updated\ncompliance. In doing so, an interpolation space with three degrees of freedom\n(volume, compliance, minimum thickness) is created, yielding diverse topologies\nfor the same boundary conditions and design values along different stages of\nevolving topological families with distinct features.\n  The optimization process is further accelerated by introducing the\nvolume-compliance iterative scheme as a physical loss function in a Double\nDistance Neural Network (D$^2$NN), obtaining similar results to 2,000 steps\nworth of vanilla iteration within 500 training epochs. This proposal offers a\nnovel topology optimization design space based on minimum strut thickness - via\nfiltering - and topological families defined by minimum volume fraction and\ncompliance.

To address this gap, we observed\nand interviewed ten experienced reviewers while they performed 25 code reviews\nfrom their review queue. Since comprehending code changes is essential to\nperform code review and the primary challenge for reviewers, we focused our\nanalysis on this cognitive process. Using Letovsky's model of code\ncomprehension, we performed a theory-driven thematic analysis to investigate\nhow reviewers apply code comprehension to navigate changes and provide\nfeedback. Our findings confirm that code comprehension is fundamental to code\nreview. We extend Letovsky's model to propose the Code Review Comprehension\nModel and demonstrate that code review, like code comprehension, relies on\nopportunistic strategies. These strategies typically begin with a\ncontext-building phase, followed by code inspection involving code reading,\ntesting, and discussion management. To interpret and evaluate the proposed\nchange, reviewers construct a mental model of the change as an extension of\ntheir understanding of the overall software system and contrast mental\nrepresentations of expected and ideal solutions against the actual\nimplementation. Based on our findings, we discuss how review tools and\npractices can better support reviewers in employing their strategies and in\nforming understanding.

In autonomous driving, 3D semantic segmentation plays an\nimportant role for enabling safe navigation. Despite significant advances in\nthe field, the complexity of collecting and annotating 3D data is a bottleneck\nin this developments. To overcome that data annotation limitation, synthetic\nsimulated data has been used to generate annotated data on demand. There is\nstill however a domain gap between real and simulated data. More recently,\ndiffusion models have been in the spotlight, enabling close-to-real data\nsynthesis. Those generative models have been recently applied to the 3D data\ndomain for generating scene-scale data with semantic annotations. Still, those\nmethods either rely on image projection or decoupled models trained with\ndifferent resolutions in a coarse-to-fine manner. Such intermediary\nrepresentations impact the generated data quality due to errors added in those\ntransformations. In this work, we propose a novel approach able to generate 3D\nsemantic scene-scale data without relying on any projection or decoupled\ntrained multi-resolution models, achieving more realistic semantic scene data\ngeneration compared to previous state-of-the-art methods. Besides improving 3D\nsemantic scene-scale data synthesis, we thoroughly evaluate the use of the\nsynthetic scene samples as labeled data to train a semantic segmentation\nnetwork.

In response, Pricing-driven Development and Operation has emerged\nto integrate pricing considerations across the software lifecycle. Among its\nmost challenging objectives is regulating feature access according to users'\nsubscriptions -- a process that requires managing a multitude of conditions\nthroughout the system's codebase. Feature toggles have traditionally been\nemployed to manage dynamic system behavior, but their application to\npricing-driven constraints presents unique challenges. When used to enforce\nsubscription-based restrictions, toggles must adapt -- among other factors --\nto individual user's use of features, ensuring that subscription limits are not\nexceeded.

This paper contributes to fill this gap by introducing HORIZON,\na classification and comparison framework for feature toggling tools tailored\nto pricing-driven environments.

Recent advances in scene modeling have made\nsignificant progress, with NeRF and 3DGS techniques emerging as powerful tools\nfor reconstructing complex scenes. However, while effective for novel view\nsynthesis, these methods typically struggle with challenging scene editing\ntasks, such as physics-based rain simulation. In contrast, traditional\nphysics-based simulations can generate realistic rain effects, such as\nraindrops and splashes, but they often rely on skilled artists to carefully set\nup high-fidelity scenes. This process lacks flexibility and scalability,\nlimiting its applicability to broader, open-world environments. In this work,\nwe introduce RainyGS, a novel approach that leverages the strengths of both\nphysics-based modeling and 3DGS to generate photorealistic, dynamic rain\neffects in open-world scenes with physical accuracy. At the core of our method\nis the integration of physically-based raindrop and shallow water simulation\ntechniques within the fast 3DGS rendering framework, enabling realistic and\nefficient simulations of raindrop behavior, splashes, and reflections. Our\nmethod supports synthesizing rain effects at over 30 fps, offering users\nflexible control over rain intensity -- from light drizzles to heavy downpours.\nWe demonstrate that RainyGS performs effectively for both real-world outdoor\nscenes and large-scale driving scenarios, delivering more photorealistic and\nphysically-accurate rain effects compared to state-of-the-art methods.

The HITRAN molecular spectroscopic database provides these parameters,\nalthough originally they were associated only with the Voigt profile\nparameterization. However, in the HITRAN2016 and HITRAN2020 editions, Voigt,\nspeed-dependent Voigt and Hartmann-Tran (HT) profiles have been incorporated,\nthanks to the new relational structure of the database. The HT profile was\nintroduced in HITRAN in 2016 as a recommended profile for the most accurate\nspectral interpretations and modeling. It was parameterized with a\nfour-temperature-range temperature dependence. Since then, however, some\nfeatures of the HT profile have been revealed that are problematic from a\npractical perspective. These are: the singular behavior of the temperature\ndependencies of the velocity-changing parameters when the shift parameter\ncrosses zero and the difficulty in evaluating the former for mixtures. In this\narticle, we summarize efforts to eliminate the above-mentioned problems that\nled us to recommend using the quadratic speed-dependent hard-collision (qSDHC)\nprofile with double-power-law (DPL) temperature dependencies. We refer to this\nprofile as a modified Hartmann-Tran (mHT) profile. The computational cost of\nevaluating it is the same as for the HT profile.

Differential privacy (DP) is a rigorous standard for\nprotecting individual privacy in data analysis. Nevertheless, when applying\ndifferential privacy to skip-gram in graphs, it becomes highly challenging due\nto the complex link relationships, which potentially result in high sensitivity\nand necessitate substantial noise injection. To tackle this challenge, we\npresent AdvSGM, a differentially private skip-gram for graphs via adversarial\ntraining. Our core idea is to leverage adversarial training to privatize\nskip-gram while improving its utility. Towards this end, we develop a novel\nadversarial training module by devising two optimizable noise terms that\ncorrespond to the parameters of a skip-gram. By fine-tuning the weights between\nmodules within AdvSGM, we can achieve differentially private gradient updates\nwithout additional noise injection.

    "abstract": "Recently, various automated testing approaches have been proposed that use\nspecialized test oracles to find hundreds of logic bugs in mature, widely-used\nDatabase Management Systems (DBMSs). These test oracles require database and\nquery generators, which must account for the often significant differences\nbetween the SQL dialects of these systems. Since it can take weeks to implement\nsuch generators, many DBMS developers are unlikely to invest the time to adopt\nsuch automated testing approaches. In short, existing approaches fail to scale\nto the plethora of DBMSs. In this work, we present both a vision and a\nplatform, SQLancer++, to apply test oracles to any SQL-based DBMS that supports\na subset of common SQL features. Our technical core contribution is a novel\narchitecture for an adaptive SQL statement generator. This adaptive SQL\ngenerator generates SQL statements with various features, some of which might\nnot be supported by the given DBMS, and then learns through interaction with\nthe DBMS, which of these are understood by the DBMS. Thus, over time, the\ngenerator will generate mostly valid SQL statements. We evaluated SQLancer++\nacross 17 DBMSs and discovered a total of 195 unique, previously unknown bugs,\nof which 180 were fixed after we reported them.

Using\nUM's employment data and OpenAlex publication records, the study examines the\nrelationship between employed researcher numbers and unique authors publishing\nunder the UM affiliation. Despite a substantial decrease in researcher\nemployment during the 2009-2013 economic recession and austerity phase, the\nnumber of unique authors publishing with UM affiliation surprisingly increased.\nThis growth was driven by factors such as a shift towards project-based\nfunding, contributions from an expanding doctoral student cohort, and increased\ninternational collaborations. Analysis of author turnover reveals a notable\ncontrast: high short-term volatility (annual churn rates of ~40-50%) versus\nsignificant mid-term stability (5-year churn rates of ~8-10%). Survival\nanalysis confirms this trend, showing high initial attrition among publishing\nauthors but long-term persistence for a core group. Furthermore, co-authorship\nnetwork analysis indicates the UM research network has become more resilient\nover time.

In the last 15 years, many quantum linear solvers (QLS) have been\ndeveloped, competing to achieve the best asymptotic worst-case complexity. Most\nQLS assume fault-tolerant quantum computers, so they cannot yet be benchmarked\non real hardware. Because an algorithm with better asymptotic scaling can\nunderperform on instances of practical interest, the question of which of these\nalgorithms is the most promising remains open. In this work, we implement a\nmethod to partially address this question. We consider four well-known QLS\nalgorithms which directly implement an approximate matrix inversion function:\nthe Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd algorithm, two algorithms utilizing a linear\ncombination of unitaries, and one utilizing the quantum singular value\ntransformation (QSVT). These methods, known as functional QLS, share nearly\nidentical assumptions about the problem setup and oracle access. Their\ncomputational cost is dominated by query calls to a matrix oracle encoding the\nproblem one wants to solve. We provide formulas to count the number of queries\nneeded to solve specific problem instances; these can be used to benchmark the\nalgorithms on real-life instances without access to quantum hardware. We select\nthree data sets: random generated instances that obey the assumptions of\nfunctional QLS, linear systems from simplex iterations on MIPLIB, and Poisson\nequations. Our methods can be easily extended to other data sets and provide a\nhigh-level guide to evaluate the performance of a QLS algorithm.

    "abstract": "We prove a formula for the spectrum of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on\nfunctions for compact naturally reductive homogeneous spaces in terms of\neigenvalues of a generalized Casimir operator and spherical representations. We\napply this result to a large family of canonical variations of normal\nhomogeneous metrics, thus allowing for the first time to study how the spectrum\ndepends on the deformation parameters of the metric. As an application, we\nprovide a formula for the full spectrum of compact positive homogeneous\n$3$-$(\\alpha,\\delta)$-Sasaki manifolds (a family of metrics which includes, in\nparticular, all homogeneous $3$-Sasaki manifolds).\n  The second part of the paper is devoted to the detailed computation and\ninvestigation of the spectrum of this family of metrics on the Aloff-Wallach\nmanifold $W^{1,1}=SU(3)/S^{1}$; in particular, we provide a documented Python\nscript that allows the explicit computation in any desired range. We recover\nUrakawa's eigenvalue computation for the $SU(3)$-normal homogeneous metric on\n$W^{1,1}$ as a limiting case and cover all the positively curved $SU(3)\\times\nSO(3)$-normal homogeneous realizations discovered by Wilking. By doing so, we\ncomplete Urakawa's list of the first eigenvalue on compact, simply conntected,\nnormal homogeneous spaces with positive sectional curvature.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated age-related changes in functional connectivity using\nresting-state fMRI and explored the efficacy of traditional deep learning for\nclassifying brain developmental stages (BDS). Functional connectivity was\nassessed using Seed-Based Phase Synchronization (SBPS) and Pearson correlation\nacross 160 ROIs. Clustering was performed using t-SNE, and network topology was\nanalyzed through graph-theoretic metrics. Adaptive learning was implemented to\nclassify the age group by extracting bottleneck features through mobileNetV2.\nThese deep features were embedded and classified using Random Forest and PCA.\nResults showed a shift in phase synchronization patterns from sensory-driven\nnetworks in youth to more distributed networks with aging. t-SNE revealed that\nSBPS provided the most distinct clustering of BDS. Global efficiency and\nparticipation coefficient followed an inverted U-shaped trajectory, while\nclustering coefficient and modularity exhibited a U-shaped pattern. MobileNet\noutperformed other models, achieving the highest classification accuracy for\nBDS. Aging was associated with reduced global integration and increased local\nconnectivity, indicating functional network reorganization. While this study\nfocused solely on functional connectivity from resting-state fMRI and a limited\nset of connectivity features, deep learning demonstrated superior\nclassification performance, highlighting its potential for characterizing\nage-related brain changes.",

    "abstract": "Modern transportation systems face pressing challenges due to increasing\ndemand, dynamic environments, and heterogeneous information integration. The\nrapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers transformative potential\nto address these challenges. Extensive knowledge and high-level capabilities\nderived from pretraining evolve the default role of LLMs as text generators to\nbecome versatile, knowledge-driven task solvers for intelligent transportation\nsystems. This survey first presents LLM4TR, a novel conceptual framework that\nsystematically categorizes the roles of LLMs in transportation into four\nsynergetic dimensions: information processors, knowledge encoders, component\ngenerators, and decision facilitators. Through a unified taxonomy, we\nsystematically elucidate how LLMs bridge fragmented data pipelines, enhance\npredictive analytics, simulate human-like reasoning, and enable closed-loop\ninteractions across sensing, learning, modeling, and managing tasks in\ntransportation systems. For each role, our review spans diverse applications,\nfrom traffic prediction and autonomous driving to safety analytics and urban\nmobility optimization, highlighting how emergent capabilities of LLMs such as\nin-context learning and step-by-step reasoning can enhance the operation and\nmanagement of transportation systems. We further curate practical guidance,\nincluding available resources and computational guidelines, to support\nreal-world deployment. By identifying challenges in existing LLM-based\nsolutions, this survey charts a roadmap for advancing LLM-driven transportation\nresearch, positioning LLMs as central actors in the next generation of\ncyber-physical-social mobility ecosystems.

These methods typically require at\nleast a parametric form of the degradation model. However, in real-world\nscenarios, the degradation may be too complex to define explicitly. To handle\nthis general case, we introduce the Diffusion Image Prior (DIIP). We take\ninspiration from the Deep Image Prior (DIP)[16], since it can be used to remove\nartifacts without the need for an explicit degradation model. However, in\ncontrast to DIP, we find that pretrained diffusion models offer a much stronger\nprior, despite being trained without knowledge from corrupted data. We show\nthat, the optimization process in DIIP first reconstructs a clean version of\nthe image before eventually overfitting to the degraded input, but it does so\nfor a broader range of degradations than DIP. In light of this result, we\npropose a blind image restoration (IR) method based on early stopping, which\ndoes not require prior knowledge of the degradation model. We validate DIIP on\nvarious degradation-blind IR tasks, including JPEG artifact removal, waterdrop\nremoval, denoising and super-resolution with state-of-the-art results.",

    "abstract": "Lip Reading, or Visual Automatic Speech Recognition (V-ASR), is a complex\ntask requiring the interpretation of spoken language exclusively from visual\ncues, primarily lip movements and facial expressions. This task is especially\nchallenging due to the absence of auditory information and the inherent\nambiguity when visually distinguishing phonemes that have overlapping visemes\nwhere different phonemes appear identical on the lips. Current methods\ntypically attempt to predict words or characters directly from these visual\ncues, but this approach frequently encounters high error rates due to\ncoarticulation effects and viseme ambiguity. We propose a novel two-stage,\nphoneme-centric framework for Visual Automatic Speech Recognition (V-ASR) that\naddresses these longstanding challenges. First, our model predicts a compact\nsequence of phonemes from visual inputs using a Video Transformer with a CTC\nhead, thereby reducing the task complexity and achieving robust speaker\ninvariance. This phoneme output then serves as the input to a fine-tuned Large\nLanguage Model (LLM), which reconstructs coherent words and sentences by\nleveraging broader linguistic context. Unlike existing methods that either\npredict words directly-often faltering on visually similar phonemes-or rely on\nlarge-scale multimodal pre-training, our approach explicitly encodes\nintermediate linguistic structure while remaining highly data efficient. We\ndemonstrate state-of-the-art performance on two challenging datasets, LRS2 and\nLRS3, where our method achieves significant reductions in Word Error Rate (WER)\nachieving a SOTA WER of 18.7 on LRS3 despite using 99.4% less labelled data\nthan the next best approach.",

This paper\naddresses this challenge by proposing a neuro-symbolic imitation learning\nframework. Using task demonstrations, the system first learns a symbolic\nrepresentation that abstracts the low-level state-action space. The learned\nrepresentation decomposes a task into easier subtasks and allows the system to\nleverage symbolic planning to generate abstract plans. Subsequently, the system\nutilizes this task decomposition to learn a set of neural skills capable of\nrefining abstract plans into actionable robot commands.

Although\nboth wavefunctions obey the Dirac equation (one directly and the other through\na Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation) they lead to different dynamics and\nproperties, such as the presence or absence of spin-orbit interactions. In this\nwork we investigate wavepacket dynamics for the Klein-Gordon equation, which\ndisplays the same ambiguity regarding the choice of different densities, in a\nsetting involving Klein tunneling across a series of supercritical potential\nbarriers. Relying on the superradiant character of this setting, we obtain\nsolutions to the wavepacket dynamics indicating that the density based on a\nFoldy-Wouthuysen transformation of the wavefunction can be locally amplified\noutside the light-cone. In principle, the exponential increase of the charge\ndue to the field inhomogeneities can lead to an arbitrarily large amplification\nover macroscopic distances.

    "abstract": "Population genetic processes, such as the adaptation of a quantitative trait\nto directional selection, may occur on longer time scales than the sweep of a\nsingle advantageous mutation. To study such processes in finite populations,\napproximations for the time course of the distribution of a beneficial mutation\nwere derived previously by branching process methods. The application to the\nevolution of a quantitative trait requires bounds for the probability of\nsurvival $\\Sn$ up to generation $n$ of a single beneficial mutation. Here, we\npresent a method to obtain a simple, analytically explicit, either upper or\nlower, bound for $\\Sn$ in a supercritical Galton-Watson process. We prove the\nexistence of an upper bound for offspring distributions including Poisson and\nbinomial. They are constructed by bounding the given generating function,\n$\\varphi$, by a fractional linear one that has the same survival probability\n$\\Sinf$ and yields the same rate of convergence of $\\Sn$ to $\\Sinf$ as\n$\\varphi$. For distributions with at most three offspring, we characterize when\nthis method yields an upper bound, a lower bound, or only an approximation.\nBecause for many distributions it is difficult to get a handle on $\\Sinf$, we\nderive an approximation by series expansion in $s$, where $s$ is the selective\nadvantage of the mutant. We briefly review well-known asymptotic results that\ngeneralize Haldane's approximation $2s$ for $\\Sinf$, as well as less well-known\nresults on sharp bounds for $\\Sinf$. We apply them to explore when bounds for\n$\\Sn$ exist for a family of generalized Poisson distributions. Numerical\nresults demonstrate the accuracy of our and of previously derived bounds for\n$\\Sinf$ and $\\Sn$.

    "abstract": "T-cells are a crucial subset of white blood cells that play a central role in\nthe immune system. When T-cells bind antigens, it leads to cell activation and\nthe induction of an immune response. If T-cells are activated by antigens in\nvivo or artificially in vitro, they form multicellular aggregates. The\nmechanical properties of such clusters provide valuable information on\ndifferent T-cell activation pathways. Furthermore, the aggregate mechanics\ncapture how T-cells are affected by mechanical forces and interact within\nlarger conglomerates, such as lymph nodes and tumours. However, an\nunderstanding of collective T-cell adhesion and mechanics following cell\nactivation is currently lacking. Probing the mechanics of fragile and\nmicroscopically small living samples is experimentally challenging. Here, the\nmicropipette force sensor technique was used to stretch T-cell aggregates and\ndirectly measure their Young's modulus and ultimate tensile strength. A\nmechanistic model was developed to correlate how the stiffness of the mesoscale\nmulticellular aggregate emerges from the mechanical response of the individual\nmicroscopic cells within the cluster. We show how the aggregate elasticity is\naffected by different activators and relate this to different activation\npathways in the cells. Our soft matter mechanics study of multicellular T-cell\naggregates contributes to our understanding of the biology behind immune cell\nactivation.",

In contrast, dogs and cats can\nadopt limping gaits when injured, demonstrating their remarkable ability to\nadapt to physical conditions. Inspired by such adaptability, this paper\npresents Action Learner (AcL), a novel teacher-student reinforcement learning\nframework that enables quadrupeds to autonomously adapt their gait for stable\nwalking under multiple joint faults. Unlike conventional teacher-student\napproaches that enforce strict imitation, AcL leverages teacher policies to\ngenerate style rewards, guiding the student policy without requiring precise\nreplication. We train multiple teacher policies, each corresponding to a\ndifferent fault condition, and subsequently distill them into a single student\npolicy with an encoder-decoder architecture. While prior works primarily\naddress single-joint faults, AcL enables quadrupeds to walk with up to four\nfaulty joints across one or two legs, autonomously switching between different\nlimping gaits when faults occur. We validate AcL on a real Go2 quadruped robot\nunder single- and double-joint faults, demonstrating fault-tolerant, stable\nwalking, smooth gait transitions between normal and lamb gaits, and robustness\nagainst external disturbances.",

Vacancy-mediated diffusion\npathways were analyzed using the SIESTA code, with minimum energy paths (MEPs)\nand activation barriers determined via the nudged elastic band (NEB) method.\nThe results indicate that Si diffusion barriers vary with crystallographic\ndirection, with the lowest barrier of 3.2 eV along [11-20] and the highest\nbarrier of ~9.9 eV along [1-100], rendering diffusion in this direction highly\nimprobable. Alternative diffusion mechanisms, including direct exchange and\nring-like migration, exhibit prohibitively high barriers ($>$12 eV). Phonon\ncalculations confirm that temperature-induced reductions in effective diffusion\nbarriers are minimal. Experimental validation using SIMS analysis on\nSi-implanted GaN samples subjected to UHPA (1450{\\deg}C, 1 GPa) confirms\nnegligible Si diffusion under these extreme conditions.

    "abstract": "Supervised training for real-world denoising presents challenges due to the\ndifficulty of collecting large datasets of paired noisy and clean images.\nRecent methods have attempted to address this by utilizing unpaired datasets of\nclean and noisy images. Some approaches leverage such unpaired data to train\ndenoisers in a supervised manner by generating synthetic clean-noisy pairs.\nHowever, these methods often fall short due to the distribution gap between\nsynthetic and real noisy images. To mitigate this issue, we propose a solution\nbased on input sparsification, specifically using random input masking. Our\nmethod, which we refer to as Mask, Inpaint and Denoise (MID), trains a denoiser\nto simultaneously denoise and inpaint synthetic clean-noisy pairs. On one hand,\ninput sparsification reduces the gap between synthetic and real noisy images.\nOn the other hand, an inpainter trained in a supervised manner can still\naccurately reconstruct sparse inputs by predicting missing clean pixels using\nthe remaining unmasked pixels. Our approach begins with a synthetic Gaussian\nnoise sampler and iteratively refines it using a noise dataset derived from the\ndenoiser's predictions. The noise dataset is created by subtracting predicted\npseudo-clean images from real noisy images at each iteration. The core\nintuition is that improving the denoiser results in a more accurate noise\ndataset and, consequently, a better noise sampler. We validate our method\nthrough extensive experiments on real-world noisy image datasets, demonstrating\ncompetitive performance compared to existing unsupervised denoising methods.",

We disuse and examine algebraic properties for each case, related to\nthe actions of addition and multiplication of points in $\\ell^{OI}$ line in\nDesargues affine planes, which are produced by these map sets.",

AIMS: In this study, we aim to probe the\nextended subsonic region observed around the pre-stellar core H-MM1 in L1688\nusing multi-component kinematical analysis of very high-sensitivity NH3 data.\nMETHODS: We used observations of NH3 (1,1) and (2,2) using GBT. We then fitted\nup to two components towards the core and its surrounding molecular cloud.\nRESULTS: We detect an extended region of subsonic turbulence in addition to the\nambient cloud, which show supersonic turbulence. This extended subsonic region\nis approximately 12 times the size of and more than two times as massive as the\npreviously detected subsonic material. The subsonic region is further split\ninto two well-separated, velocity-coherent components, one of which is\nkinematically and spatially connected to the dense core. The two subsonic\ncomponents are red- and blue-shifted with respected to the cloud component. We\nalso detect a flow of material onto the dense core from the extended subsonic\nregion via a streamer of length ~0.15 pc (~30000 au). CONCLUSIONS: We find that\nthe extended subsonic component kinematically associated with the dense core\ncontains 27% more mass than the core. This material could be further accreted\nby the core. The other subsonic component contains a mass similar to that of\nthe core mass, and could be tracing material in the early stage of core\nformation. The H-MM1 streamer is kinematically similar to the ones observed\ntowards protostellar systems, but is the first instance of such an accretion\nfeature onto a core in its pre-stellar phase. This accretion of chemically\nfresh material by the pre-stellar core challenges our current understanding of\na core evolving with a mass unchanged since the time of its formation.",

For the primary\nruns, two independent pipelines are adopted to construct subhaloes and merger\ntrees. On top of them, four sets of mock galaxy light-cone catalogs are\nproduced from semi-analytical models and subhalo abundance matching, providing\na variety of observational properties including galaxy SED, emission lines,\nlensing distortions, and mock images. The 129 emulator runs are used to train\nthe CSST emulator, achieving one percent accuracy in predicting the matter\npower spectrum over $k\\leq 10h{\\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ and $z\\leq 2$. The reconstruction\nruns employ a number of subgrid baryonic models to predict the evolution and\ngalaxy population resembling certain regions in the real Universe with\nconstrained initial conditions, enabling controlled investigation of galaxy\nformation on top of structure formation. The extension runs cover models with\nwarm dark matter, $f(R)$ gravity, interacting dark energy, and nonzero neutrino\nmasses, revealing differences in the cosmic structure under alternative\ncosmological models. We introduce the specifications for each run, the data\nproducts derived from them, the corresponding pipeline developments, and\npresent some main tests. Using the primary runs, we also show that the subhalo\npeak mass functions of different levels are approximately universal.

Knots are a\nprimary factor affecting the quality of sawn timber, making their detection\nfundamental to any timber grading or cutting optimization system. While X-ray\ncomputed tomography provides accurate knot locations and internal structures,\nit is often too slow or expensive for practical use. An attractive alternative\nis to use fast and cost-effective log surface measurements, such as laser\nscanners or RGB cameras, to detect surface knots and estimate the internal\nstructure of wood. However, due to the small size of knots and noise caused by\nfactors, such as bark and other natural variations, detection accuracy often\nremains low when only one measurement modality is used. In this paper, we\ndemonstrate that by using a data fusion pipeline consisting of separate streams\nfor RGB and point cloud data, combined by a late fusion module, higher knot\ndetection accuracy can be achieved compared to using either modality alone. We\nfurther propose a simple yet efficient sawing angle optimization method that\nutilizes surface knot detections and cross-correlation to minimize the amount\nof unwanted arris knots, demonstrating its benefits over randomized sawing\nangles.",

(iii) The GSMF of group galaxies\ndoes not depend on the position within a filament, but for groups outside of\nfilaments, the characteristic mass of the GSMF is lower. Finally, our global\nGSMF is well described by a double Schechter function with the following\nparameters: $\\log [M^{\\star} / (M_{\\odot} \\, h_{70}^{-2})] = 10.76 \\pm 0.01$,\n$\\Phi_1^{\\star} = (3.75 \\pm 0.09) \\times 10^{-3}$ Mpc$^{-3}$ $h_{70}^3$,\n$\\alpha_{1} = -0.86 \\pm 0.03$, $\\Phi_2^{\\star} = (0.13 \\pm 0.05) \\times\n10^{-3}$ Mpc$^{-3}$ $h_{70}^3$, and $\\alpha_{2} = -1.71 \\pm 0.06$.

These energy releases are associated with coronal\nmagnetic loops, which are rooted in dense photospheric plasma and are passively\ntransported by surface advection. Their emissions cover a wide range of\nwavelengths, with soft X-rays being the primary diagnostic for the past fifty\nyears. Despite the efforts of multiple authors, we are still far from a\ncomplete theory, capable of explaining the observed statistical and individual\nproperties of flares. Here, we exploit the availability of stable and long-term\nsoft x-ray measurements from NASA's GOES mission to build a new solar flare\ncatalogue, with a novel approach to linking sympathetic events. Furthermore,\nfor the most energetic events since 2010, we have also provided a method to\nidentify the origin of the observed flare and eventual link to the photospheric\nactive region by exploiting the array of instruments onboard NASA's Solar\nDynamic Observatory.

    "abstract": "The wastage of perishable items has led to significant health and economic\ncrises, increasing business uncertainty and fluctuating customer demand. This\nissue is worsened by online food delivery services, where frequent and\nunpredictable orders create inefficiencies in supply chain management,\ncontributing to the bullwhip effect. This effect results in stockouts, excess\ninventory, and inefficiencies. Accurate demand forecasting helps stabilize\ninventory, optimize supplier orders, and reduce waste. This paper presents a\nThird-Party Logistics (3PL) supply chain model involving restaurants, online\nfood apps, and customers, along with a deep learning-based demand forecasting\nmodel using a two-phase Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network.\n  Phase one, intra-day forecasting, captures short-term variations, while phase\ntwo, daily forecasting, predicts overall demand. A two-year dataset from\nJanuary 2023 to January 2025 from Swiggy and Zomato is used, employing discrete\nevent simulation and grid search for optimal LSTM hyperparameters. The proposed\nmethod is evaluated using RMSE, MAE, and R-squared score, with R-squared as the\nprimary accuracy measure. Phase one achieves an R-squared score of 0.69 for\nZomato and 0.71 for Swiggy with a training time of 12 minutes, while phase two\nimproves to 0.88 for Zomato and 0.90 for Swiggy with a training time of 8\nminutes.\n  To mitigate demand fluctuations, restaurant inventory is dynamically managed\nusing the newsvendor model, adjusted based on forecasted demand. The proposed\nframework significantly reduces the bullwhip effect, improving forecasting\naccuracy and supply chain efficiency. For phase one, supply chain instability\ndecreases from 2.61 to 0.96, and for phase two, from 2.19 to 0.80. This\ndemonstrates the model's effectiveness in minimizing food waste and maintaining\noptimal restaurant inventory levels.",

The\nradio and optical data indicate that on parsec scales the magnetic field is\nprimarily orthogonal to the jet direction.

However, most existing VPR datasets are\nlimited to single-viewpoint scenarios, leading to reduced recognition accuracy,\nparticularly in multi-directional driving or feature-sparse scenes. Moreover,\nobtaining additional data to mitigate these limitations is often expensive.\nThis paper introduces a novel training paradigm to improve the performance of\nexisting VPR networks by enhancing multi-view diversity within current datasets\nthrough uncertainty estimation and NeRF-based data augmentation. Specifically,\nwe initially train NeRF using the existing VPR dataset. Then, our devised\nself-supervised uncertainty estimation network identifies places with high\nuncertainty. The poses of these uncertain places are input into NeRF to\ngenerate new synthetic observations for further training of VPR networks.\nAdditionally, we propose an improved storage method for efficient organization\nof augmented and original training data. We conducted extensive experiments on\nthree datasets and tested three different VPR backbone networks. The results\ndemonstrate that our proposed training paradigm significantly improves VPR\nperformance by fully utilizing existing data, outperforming other training\napproaches.

Despite the\npopularity of PFs, the study of the time evolution of their estimates has\nreceived barely attention in the literature. Denoting by\n$(\\hat{\\eta}_t^N)_{t\\geq 1}$ the PF estimate of $(\\hat{\\eta}_t)_{t\\geq 1}$ and\nletting $\\kappa\\in (0,1)$, in this work we first show that for any number of\nparticles $N$ it holds that, with probability one, we have $\\|\\hat{\\eta}_t^N-\n\\hat{\\eta}_t\\|\\geq \\kappa$ for infinitely many $t\\geq 1$, with $\\|\\cdot\\|$ a\nmeasure of distance between probability distributions.

A common practical approach for\nproducing such droplets relies on the Plateau Rayleigh instability to break up\na liquid compound jet in air.

The X-rays from the\nshock region observed by the X-ray astronomy satellite Suzaku/XIS in the energy\nrange of 2-8 keV are well described by the absorbed power-law model and can be\nparameterized with flux and photon index. The X-ray flux and photon index are\nbimodally distributed in relation to the azimuthal angle. To understand its\norigin, we examined three possible causes: azimuthal variation by (1) the\ngalactic magnetic field, (2) cloud density, and (3) shock velocity. From the\npolarization observations of stars near the SNR, we find that the Galactic\nmagnetic field around the SNR is not aligned. This result leads us to conclude\nthat the azimuthal variation of the X-ray spectrum is most likely not caused by\nthe Galactic magnetic field. The X-ray fluxes are positively correlated with\nthe cloud density with a significance of $\\sim 5\\sigma$, and the azimuthal\ndistributions of these physical quantities are particularly pronounced in the\nnorthern part of the SNR. In addition, the X-ray fluxes on the southern part of\nthe SNR are positively correlated with the shock velocity. This phenomenon can\nbe qualitatively explained by the increase in roll-off energy due to the\namplification of the magnetic field by (A) the interaction between the shock\nand dense clouds in the north and (B) the fast shock velocity in the south of\nthe SNR. Since the shock velocity is likely related to the cloud density\ninteracting with the shock, we conclude that the azimuthal variation of cloud\ndensity most likely causes the azimuthal variations of the X-ray flux and\nphoton index.",

The\nprocedure relies on a precise abstract interpretation of inspection\nrequirements and a dedicated earliest normal form for linear as well as\nuniform-copying transducers which can be constructed in polynomial time. As a\nconsequence, equivalence of these transducers can be decided in polynomial\ntime.

    "abstract": "A range of generative machine learning models for the design of novel\nmolecules and materials have been proposed in recent years. Models that can\ngenerate three-dimensional structures are particularly suitable for quantum\nchemistry workflows, enabling direct property prediction. The performance of\ngenerative models is typically assessed based on their ability to produce\nnovel, valid, and unique molecules. However, equally important is their ability\nto learn the prevalence of functional groups and certain chemical moieties in\nthe underlying training data, that is, to faithfully reproduce the chemical\nspace spanned by the training data. Here, we investigate the ability of the\nautoregressive generative machine learning model G-SchNet to reproduce the\nchemical space and property distributions of training datasets composed of\nlarge, functional organic molecules. We assess the elemental composition, size-\nand bond-length distributions, as well as the functional group and chemical\nspace distribution of training and generated molecules. By principal component\nanalysis of the chemical space, we find that the model leads to a biased\ngeneration that is largely unaffected by the choice of hyperparameters or the\ntraining dataset distribution, producing molecules that are, on average, more\nunsaturated and contain more heteroatoms. Purely aliphatic molecules are mostly\nabsent in the generation. We further investigate generation with functional\ngroup constraints and based on composite datasets, which can help partially\nremedy the model generation bias. Decision tree models can recognize the\ngeneration bias in the models and discriminate between training and generated\ndata, revealing key chemical differences between the two sets. The chemical\ndifferences we find affect the distributions of electronic properties such as\nthe HOMO-LUMO gap, which is a common target for functional molecule design.",

    "abstract": "In a context of constant increase in competition and heightened regulatory\npressure, accuracy, actuarial precision, as well as transparency and\nunderstanding of the tariff, are key issues in non-life insurance.\nTraditionally used generalized linear models (GLM) result in a multiplicative\ntariff that favors interpretability. With the rapid development of machine\nlearning and deep learning techniques, actuaries and the rest of the insurance\nindustry have adopted these techniques widely. However, there is a need to\nassociate them with interpretability techniques. In this paper, our study\nfocuses on introducing an Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM) model that\ncombines intrinsically interpretable characteristics and high prediction\nperformance. This approach is described as a glass-box model and relies on the\nuse of a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) and a cyclic gradient boosting\nalgorithm. It accounts for univariate and pairwise interaction effects between\nfeatures and provides naturally explanations on them. We implement this\napproach on car insurance frequency and severity data and extensively compare\nthe performance of this approach with classical competitors: a GLM, a GAM, a\nCART model and an Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) algorithm.

    "abstract": "The treatment of breast cancer using radiotherapy involves uncertainties\nregarding breast positioning. As the studies progress, more is known about the\nexpected breast positioning errors, which are taken into account in the\nPlanning Target Volume (PTV) in the form of the margin around the clinical\ntarget volume. However, little is known about the non-rigid deformations of the\nbreast in the course of radiotherapy, which is a non-negligible factor to the\ntreatment. Purpose: Taking into account such inter-fractional breast\ndeformations would help develop a promising future direction, such as\npatient-specific adjustable irradiation plannings. Methods: In this study, we\ndevelop a geometric approach to analyze inter-fractional breast deformation\nthroughout the radiotherapy treatment. Our data consists of 3D surface scans of\npatients acquired during radiotherapy sessions using a handheld scanner. We\nadapt functional map framework to compute inter-and intra-patient non-rigid\ncorrespondences, which are then used to analyze intra-patient changes and\ninter-patient variability. Results: The qualitative shape collection analysis\nhighlight deformations in the contralateral breast and armpit areas, along with\npositioning shifts on the head or abdominal regions. We also perform extrinsic\nanalysis, where we align surface acquisitions of the treated breast with the\nCT-derived skin surface to assess displacements and volume changes in the\ntreated area. On average, displacements within the treated breast exhibit\namplitudes of 1-2 mm across sessions, with higher values observed at the time\nof the 25 th irradiation session. Volume changes, inferred from surface\nvariations, reached up to 10%, with values ranging between 2% and 5% over the\ncourse of treatment. Conclusions: We propose a comprehensive workflow for\nanalyzing and modeling breast deformations during radiotherapy using surface\nacquisitions, incorporating a novel inter-collection shape matching approach to\nmodel shape variability within a i shared space across multiple patient shape\ncollections. We validate our method using 3D surface data acquired from\npatients during External Beam Radiotherapy (EBRT) sessions, demonstrating its\neffectiveness.

Method:\nWe analyzed 2,258 colonoscopy images with corresponding pathology reports from\n428 patients.

The data included in the fit are from single inclusive\n$e^+ e^-$ annihilation (SIA), semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering (SIDIS)\nand proton-proton collisions, with kinematic cuts carefully applied to ensure\nvalidity of collinear factorization and perturbative QCD expansion. For the\nfirst time, data from SIDIS and hadron-in-jet production in SIA have been\nincorporated into the extraction of FFs for light-flavor neutral hadrons. Our\nanalysis reveals that these data play a critical role in constraining the gluon\ndistribution, and in distinguishing between different quark flavors. Pulls from\ndifferent datasets are also studied by performing alternative fits with\nsystematically subtracting groups of data from the nominal fit. For the quality\nof the fit, good $\\chi^2$ values are achieved for most of the datasets, and FFs\nare generally well constrained within the momentum fraction region $\\pqty{0.1,\n0.5}$. The extracted $K_S^0$ fragmentation functions, together with the $K_S^0$\nFFs constructed from $K^{\\pm}$ FFs via isospin symmetry, are used to test\nisospin symmetry in kaon fragmentation.

    "abstract": "Most multimodal large language models (MLLMs) treat visual tokens as \"a\nsequence of text\", integrating them with text tokens into a large language\nmodel (LLM). However, a great quantity of visual tokens significantly increases\nthe demand for computational resources and time. In this paper, we propose\nInternVL-X, which outperforms the InternVL model in both performance and\nefficiency by incorporating three visual token compression methods. First, we\npropose a novel vision-language projector, PVTC. This component integrates\nadjacent visual embeddings to form a local query and utilizes the transformed\nCLS token as a global query, then performs point-to-region cross-attention\nthrough these local and global queries to more effectively convert visual\nfeatures. Second, we present a layer-wise visual token compression module,\nLVTC, which compresses tokens in the LLM shallow layers and then expands them\nthrough upsampling and residual connections in the deeper layers. This\nsignificantly enhances the model computational efficiency. Futhermore, we\npropose an efficient high resolution slicing method, RVTC, which dynamically\nadjusts the number of visual tokens based on image area or length filtering.\nRVTC greatly enhances training efficiency with only a slight reduction in\nperformance. By utilizing 20% or fewer visual tokens, InternVL-X achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on 7 public MLLM benchmarks, and improves the\naverage metric by 2.34% across 12 tasks.",

Despite its\nrelatively widespread usage, there is a lack of experimental data determining\nits thermodynamic properties. This challenges numerical simulations to predict\nthe acoustic response of agents developed using this material. In this study,\nwe employ the well-established method of shock compression of materials at\nrelatively high pressures (100--400 MPa) to estimate a kinematic equation of\nstate for perfluorohexane. We use multi-objective optimization to obtain the\nNoble-Abel Stiffened-Gas equation of state, which is suitable for hydrodynamic\nnumerical simulations. We then apply the extrapolated equation of state to\nsimulate shock-wave propagation within a perfluorohexane droplet showing\nexcellent agreement with equivalent experiments. This validates the equation of\nstate and promotes the use of numerical simulations as a valuable tool for\nunderstanding the complex acoustic interactions involved in these biomedical\nagents, ultimately facilitating their translation for clinical purposes.",

In this paper, we consider a practical scenario where\na developer obtains a deep model from a third party and uses it as part of a\nsafety-critical system. The developer wants to inspect the model for potential\nbackdoors prior to system deployment. We find that most existing detection\ntechniques make assumptions that are not applicable to this scenario. In this\npaper, we present a novel framework for detecting backdoors under realistic\nrestrictions. We generate candidate triggers by deductively searching over the\nspace of possible triggers. We construct and optimize a smoothed version of\nAttack Success Rate as our search objective. Starting from a broad class of\ntemplate attacks and just using the forward pass of a deep model, we reverse\nengineer the backdoor attack. We conduct extensive evaluation on a wide range\nof attacks, models, and datasets, with our technique performing almost\nperfectly across these settings.",

We study their colours, their derived stellar masses and\nstar-formation rates, and we estimate their halo mass lower limits. We\ninvestigate whether we are intercepting these galaxy overdensities in their\n`dying' phase, such that the high star-formation rates would be due to their\nlast unsustainable starburst before transitioning to groups or clusters of\ngalaxies. Indeed, some galaxy members are found to lie above the main sequence\nof galaxies (star-formation rate versus stellar mass). These overdense regions\noccupy a specific position in the dark matter halo mass / redshift plane where\nforming galaxy clusters are expected to have experienced a transition between\ncold flows to shock heating in the halo. Finally, we empirically update the\npotential for galaxy protocluster discoveries at redshift up to $z \\simeq3$\n(wide survey) and $z \\simeq5.5$ (deep survey) with $\\textit{Euclid}$ for the\nnext data release (DR1).",

SIMPGEN leverages\nwavelet-informed neural metrics to distinguish noisy from clean fields, guiding\nrealistic SSH reconstructions. Applied to SWOT data, SIMPGEN effectively\nremoves noise, preserving fine-scale features better than existing neural\nmethods.

    "abstract": "Stoichiometric silicon nitride has emerged as a widely used integrated\nphotonic material owing to its high index of refraction, nonlinear optical\nproperties, and broad transparency window spanning visible to mid-IR\nfrequencies. However, silicon nitride is generally more resistant to reactive\nion etching than are typical etch masks made of polymer-based resist. This\nnecessitates resist layers that are significantly thicker than the silicon\nnitride and results in mask patterns which are tall and narrow. These\nhigh-aspect-ratio patterns inhibit the plasma transport of reactive ion\netching, which leads to difficulties in accurately reproducing dimensions and\ncreating well-defined, vertical waveguide sidewalls. In this work, we overcome\nthese challenges by developing a metallic etch mask deposited via metal\nlift-off that provides a 30 : 1 nitride-to-metal etch rate ratio, representing\na near 45-fold reduction in the required mask thickness. We demonstrate the\nvalidity of this technique by etching microring resonators with near-vertical\nwaveguide sidewalls and intrinsic quality factors of over 1 million. Leveraging\nthe low optical loss of our resonators, we generate optical frequency combs\nwith more than an octave of bandwidth and dual dispersive waves. These results\nestablish metal lift-off as a viable and easy-to-implement technique capable of\nproducing low optical loss waveguides.",

For the next years, both systems will probably coexist in the same\nfrequency band since the migration from GSM-R to FRMCS is planned to be done\nprogressively until the GSM-R system is completely shut down, mainly due to\nsafety and budget constraints.

Existing DSE tools, which rely on predefined hardware\ntemplates to explore parameters for specific architectures, fall short in\nexploring diverse organizations, spatial hierarchies, and architectural\npolymorphisms inherent in multi-level hardware. To address these limitations,\nwe present Multi-Level Design Space Exploror (MLDSE), a novel infrastructure\nfor domain-specific DSE of multi-level hardware.

When applied to guide mathematical reasoning, R-PRM achieves\nconsistent accuracy improvements of over 8.5 points across six challenging\ndatasets.

The CO\nvelocity field shows a regularly rotating disk with a flat rotation velocity of\n256 kms$^{-1}$ with no clear signatures of interaction or gas accretion.

Furthermore, recognizing the need to\nensure procedural safety, we limit interaction forces by scaling the motion\nreferences provided to the admittance controller based solely on measured\ncontact forces. This ensures effective force limitation in all contact states\nwithout requiring prior knowledge of the environment. The proposed FH-HBTS is\nvalidated in a dental scaling procedure using a dental phantom.

Using Hamilton's variational principle, the system is modeled as a\nrotating slender Timoshenko beam under thermal and aerodynamic loads, described\nby a coupled system of 2*2 hyperbolic PIDEs, parabolic PDE, and ODEs, where the\nnonlocal terms exist in the hyperbolic PDE domain, and where the external\ndisturbance (heat flux) flows into one boundary of the heat PDE. For the\ngeneral form of such mixed systems, we present the state-feedback control\ndesign based on the PDE backstepping method, and then design an extended state\nobserver for the unmeasurable distributed states and external disturbances\nusing only available boundary measurements. In the resulting output-feedback\nclosed-loop system, the state of the uncontrolled boundary, i.e., the furthest\nstate from the control input, is proved to be exponentially convergent to zero,\nand all signals are proved to be uniformly ultimately bounded.

While\nthese protocols have proven effective in wired networks, their adaptation to\nwireless environments presents significant challenges. Asynchronous BFT\nconsensus, characterized by its N parallel consensus components (e.g.,\nasynchronous Byzantine agreement, reliable broadcast), suffers from high\nmessage complexity, leading to network congestion and inefficiency, especially\nin resource-constrained wireless networks. Asynchronous Byzantine agreement\n(ABA) protocols, a foundational component of asynchronous BFT, require careful\nbalancing of message complexity and cryptographic overhead to achieve efficient\nimplementation in wireless settings. Additionally, the absence of dedicated\ntestbeds for asynchronous wireless BFT consensus protocols hinders development\nand performance evaluation. To address these challenges, we propose a consensus\nbatching protocol (ConsensusBatcher), which supports both vertical and\nhorizontal batching of multiple parallel consensus components. We leverage\nConsensusBatcher to adapt three asynchronous BFT consensus protocols\n(HoneyBadgerBFT, BEAT, and Dumbo) from wired networks to resource-constrained\nwireless networks. To evaluate the performance of ConsensusBatcher-enabled\nconsensus protocols in wireless environments, we develop and open-source a\ntestbed for deployment and performance assessment of these protocols.

    "abstract": "One proposed black hole formation channel involves hierarchical mergers,\nwhere black holes form through repeated binary mergers. Previous studies have\nshown that such black holes follow a near-universal spin distribution centered\naround 0.7. However, gravitational-wave kicks can eject remnants from their\nhost environments, meaning only retained black holes can participate in\nsubsequent mergers. We calculate the spin distribution of retained black holes\nin typical globular clusters, accounting for remnant kick velocities. Since the\nkick magnitude depends on the binary's mass ratio and spin orientations,\ncertain configurations are more likely to be retained than others. This\npreferentially selects certain remnant spin magnitudes, skewing the spin\ndistribution of second-generation black holes away from the universal\ndistribution. In low escape velocity environments, the distribution can become\nbimodal, as remnants with spins of 0.7 typically receive larger kicks than\nother configurations. Regarding higher-generation black holes, their spin\ndistribution does not converge to a unique form, and can span a broad range of\nspins, $a_f \\in (0.4,1)$, depending on their merger history, birth spins and\nthe escape velocity. Additionally, we find that the presence of a small\nfraction of binaries with near-aligned spins can produce a second, more\ndominant peak, whose position depends on the birth spin magnitude. Our findings\nidentify observable features of hierarchical merger black holes, which is\nessential for understanding their contribution to the gravitational-wave\npopulation. Moreover, the dependence of the spin distribution on astrophysical\nparameters means that precise spin measurements could provide insights into\ntheir formation environments.",

    "abstract": "The success of large language models has garnered widespread attention for\nmodel merging techniques, especially training-free methods which combine model\ncapabilities within the parameter space. However, two challenges remain: (1)\nuniform treatment of all parameters leads to performance degradation; (2)\nsearch-based algorithms are often inefficient. In this paper, we present an\ninnovative framework termed Reinforced Model Merging (RMM), which encompasses\nan environment and agent tailored for merging tasks. These components interact\nto execute layer-wise merging actions, aiming to search the optimal merging\narchitecture. Notably, RMM operates without any gradient computations on the\noriginal models, rendering it feasible for edge devices. Furthermore, by\nutilizing data subsets during the evaluation process, we addressed the\nbottleneck in the reward feedback phase, thereby accelerating RMM by up to 100\ntimes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RMM achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance across various vision and NLP datasets and effectively overcomes\nthe limitations of the existing baseline methods.

By leveraging semantic components, \\ie, superpixels, SeRKD enables a\nmore comprehensive and context-aware transfer of knowledge, which skillfully\nintegrates superpixel-based semantic extraction with relation-based knowledge\ndistillation for a sophisticated model compression and distillation.\nParticularly, the proposed method is naturally relevant in the domain of Vision\nTransformers (ViTs), where visual tokens serve as fundamental units of\nrepresentation.

This is partly due to the limited availability of climbing motion\ndatasets, especially large-scale and challenging 3D labeled datasets. To\naddress the insufficiency of climbing motion datasets, we collect AscendMotion,\na large-scale well-annotated, and challenging climbing motion dataset. It\nconsists of 412k RGB, LiDAR frames, and IMU measurements, including the\nchallenging climbing motions of 22 skilled climbing coaches across 12 different\nrock walls. Capturing the climbing motions is challenging as it requires\nprecise recovery of not only the complex pose but also the global position of\nclimbers. Although multiple global HMR methods have been proposed, they cannot\nfaithfully capture climbing motions. To address the limitations of HMR methods\nfor climbing, we propose ClimbingCap, a motion recovery method that\nreconstructs continuous 3D human climbing motion in a global coordinate system.\nOne key insight is to use the RGB and LiDAR modalities to separately\nreconstruct motions in camera coordinates and global coordinates and to\noptimize them jointly.

The resulting surface of thin and\nthick cloudy patches has been put forward to explain the observed variability,\nJ-band brightening, and re-emergence of FeH absorption. We study the closest\nbrown dwarf binary, Luhman 16A and B, in an effort to constrain their chemical\nand cloud compositions. As this binary consists of an L7.5 and T0.5 component,\nwe gain insight into the atmospheric properties at the L-T transition. As part\nof the ESO SupJup Survey, we observed Luhman 16AB at high spectral resolution\nin the J-band ($1.1-1.4\\ \\mathrm{\\mu m}$) using CRIRES$^+$. To analyse the\nspectra, we employ an atmospheric retrieval framework, coupling the radiative\ntransfer code petitRADTRANS with the MultiNest sampling algorithm. For both\nobjects, we report detections of H$_2$O, K, Na, FeH, and, for the first time in\nthe J-band, hydrogen-fluoride (HF). The K doublet at $1250\\ \\mathrm{nm}$ shows\nasymmetric absorption in the blue line wings, which are reproduced via\npressure- and temperature-dependent shifts of the line cores. We find evidence\nfor clouds in both spectra and we place constraints on an FeH-depletion in the\nLuhman 16A photosphere. The inferred over-abundance of FeH for Luhman 16B\nopposes its predicted rainout into iron clouds. A two-column model, which\nemulates the patchy surface expected at the L-T transition, is weakly preferred\n($\\sim 1.8\\sigma$) for component B but disfavoured for A ($\\sim 5.5\\sigma$).\nThe results suggest a uniform surface on Luhman 16A, which is in good agreement\nwith the reduced variability observed for this L-type component. While the\npresented evidence is not sufficient to draw conclusions about any\ninhomogeneity on Luhman 16B, future observations covering a broader wavelength\nrange could help to test the cloud-clearing hypothesis.",

    "abstract": "This document summarises discussions on future directions in theoretical\nneutrino physics, which are the outcome of a neutrino theory workshop held at\nCERN in February 2025. The starting point is the realisation that neutrino\nphysics offers unique opportunities to address some of the most fundamental\nquestions in physics. This motivates a vigorous experimental programme which\nthe theory community fully supports. \\textbf{A strong effort in theoretical\nneutrino physics is paramount to optimally take advantage of upcoming neutrino\nexperiments and to explore the synergies with other areas of particle,\nastroparticle, and nuclear physics, as well as cosmology.} Progress on the\ntheory side has the potential to significantly boost the physics reach of\nexperiments, as well as go well beyond their original scope. Strong\ncollaboration between theory and experiment is essential in the precision era.\nTo foster such collaboration, \\textbf{we propose to establish a CERN Neutrino\nPhysics Centre.} Taking inspiration from the highly successful LHC Physics\nCenter at Fermilab, the CERN Neutrino Physics Centre would be the European hub\nof the neutrino community, covering experimental and theoretical activities.",

    "abstract": "Using a novel high-performance computing implementation of a nonlinear\ncontinuum damage breakage model, we explore interactions between 3D co-seismic\noff-fault damage, seismic radiation, and rupture dynamics. Our simulations\ndemonstrate that off-fault damage enhances high-frequency wave radiation above\n1~Hz, reduces rupture speed and alters the total kinetic energy. We identify\ndistinct damage regimes separated by solid-granular transition, with smooth\ndistributions under low damage conditions transitioning to localized,\nmesh-independent shear bands upon reaching brittle failure. The shear band\norientations depend systematically on the background stress and agree with\nanalytical predictions. The brittle damage inhibits transitions to supershear\nrupture propagation and the rupture front strain field results in locally\nreduced damage accumulation during supershear transition. The dynamically\ngenerated damage yields uniform and isotropic ratios of fault-normal to\nfault-parallel high-frequency ground motions. Co-seismic damage zones exhibit\ndepth-dependent width variations, becoming broader near the Earth's surface\nconsistent with field observations, even under uniform stress conditions. We\ndiscover a new delayed dynamic triggering mechanism in multi-fault systems,\ndriven by reductions in elastic moduli and the ensuing stress heterogeneity in\n3D tensile fault step-overs. This mechanism affects the static and dynamic\nstress fields and includes the formation of high shear-traction fronts around\nlocalized damage zones. The brittle damage facilitates rupture cascading across\nfaults, linking delay times directly to damage rheology and fault zone\nevolution. Our results help explain enhanced high-frequency seismic radiation\nand delayed rupture triggering, improving our understanding of earthquake\nprocesses, seismic radiation and fault system interactions.",

These artifacts degrade image quality, resulting in suboptimal\nvisualization and complicating the accurate interpretation of tissues adjacent\nto metal implants. To address these issues, we introduce the Latent Gemstone\nSpectral Imaging (GSI) Alignment Framework, which effectively reduces metal\nartifacts while avoiding the introduction of noise information. Our work is\nbased on a key finding that even artifact-affected ordinary CT sequences\ncontain sufficient information to discern detailed structures. The challenge\nlies in the inability to clearly represent this information. To address this\nissue, we developed an Alignment Framework that adjusts the representation of\nordinary CT images to match GSI CT sequences. GSI is an advanced imaging\ntechnique using multiple energy levels to mitigate artifacts caused by metal\nimplants. By aligning the representation to GSI data, we can effectively\nsuppress metal artifacts while clearly revealing detailed structure, without\nintroducing extraneous information into CT sequences. To facilitate the\napplication, we propose a new dataset, Artifacts-GSI, captured from real\npatients with metal implants, and establish a new benchmark based on this\ndataset. Experimental results show that our method significantly reduces metal\nartifacts and greatly enhances the readability of CT slices.

We\npropose a novel distributed nonlinear transform source-channel coding (D-NTSCC)\nframework. Unlike existing learning-based approaches that implicitly learn\nsource correlation in a purely data-driven manner, our method explicitly models\nthe source correlation through joint distribution. Specifically, the correlated\nimages are separately encoded into latent representations via an encoding\ntransform function, followed by a JSCC encoder to produce channel input\nsymbols. A learned joint entropy model is introduced to determine the\ntransmission rates, which more accurately approximates the joint distribution\nof the latent representations and captures source dependencies, thereby\nimproving rate-distortion performance. At the receiver, a JSCC decoder and a\ndecoding transform function reconstruct the images from the received signals,\neach serving as side information for recovering the other image. Therein, a\ntransformation module is designed to align the latent representations for\nmaximal correlation learning. Furthermore, a loss function is derived to\njointly optimize encoding, decoding, and the joint entropy model, ensuring that\nthe learned joint entropy model approximates the true joint distribution.\nExperiments on multi-view datasets show that D-NTSCC outperforms\nstate-of-the-art distributed schemes, demonstrating its effectiveness in\nexploiting source correlation.",

We\ndevelop an automated framework that extracts critical components - research\nquestions, background surveys, inspirations, and hypotheses - from scientific\npapers across 12 disciplines, with expert validation confirming its accuracy.\nTo prevent data contamination, we focus exclusively on papers published in\n2024, ensuring minimal overlap with LLM pretraining data. Our evaluation\nreveals that LLMs perform well in retrieving inspirations, an\nout-of-distribution task, suggesting their ability to surface novel knowledge\nassociations.

However, adapting DiT for\npose-guided human image animation faces two core challenges: (a) existing\nU-Net-based pose control methods may be suboptimal for the DiT backbone; and\n(b) removing text guidance, as in previous approaches, often leads to semantic\nloss and model degradation. To address these issues, we propose DynamiCtrl, a\nnovel framework for human animation in video DiT architecture. Specifically, we\nuse a shared VAE encoder for human images and driving poses, unifying them into\na common latent space, maintaining pose fidelity, and eliminating the need for\nan expert pose encoder during video denoising. To integrate pose control into\nthe DiT backbone effectively, we propose a novel Pose-adaptive Layer Norm\nmodel. It injects normalized pose features into the denoising process via\nconditioning on visual tokens, enabling seamless and scalable pose control\nacross DiT blocks. Furthermore, to overcome the shortcomings of text removal,\nwe introduce the \"Joint-text\" paradigm, which preserves the role of text\nembeddings to provide global semantic context. Through full-attention blocks,\nimage and pose features are aligned with text features, enhancing semantic\nconsistency, leveraging pretrained knowledge, and enabling multi-level control.\nExperiments verify the superiority of DynamiCtrl on benchmark and\nself-collected data (e.g., achieving the best LPIPS of 0.166), demonstrating\nstrong character control and high-quality synthesis.

A stronger version of the conjecture, also widely studied and often\ncalled ``the stable De Giorgi conjecture'', proposes that every stable solution\nin \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\) must be one-dimensional for \\(n \\leq 7\\). To this date,\nboth conjectures remain open for \\(3 \\leq n \\leq 7\\).\n  An elegant variant of this problem, advocated by Caffarelli, C\\'ordoba, and\nJerison since the 1990s, considers a free boundary version of the Allen--Cahn\nequation. This variant features a step-like double-well potential, leading to\nmultiple free boundaries. Locally, near each free boundary, the solution\nsatisfies the Bernoulli free boundary problem. However, the interaction of the\nfree boundaries causes the global behavior of the solution to resemble that of\nthe Allen--Cahn equation.\n  In this paper, we establish the validity of the stable De Giorgi conjecture\nin dimension 3 for the free boundary Allen--Cahn equation and, as a corollary,\nwe prove the corresponding De Giorgi conjecture for monotone solutions in\ndimension 4. To obtain these results, a key aspect of our work is to address a\nclassical open problem in free boundary theory of independent interest: the\nclassification of global stable solutions to the one-phase Bernoulli problem in\nthree dimensions. This result, which is the core of our paper, implies\nuniversal curvature estimates for local stable solutions to Bernoulli, and\nserves as a foundation for adapting some classical ideas from minimal surface\ntheory -- after significant refinements -- to the free boundary Allen--Cahn\nequation.",

A key aspect of sensing integration is\nparameter estimation, which involves extracting information about the\nsurrounding environment, such as the direction, distance, and velocity of\nvarious objects within. This is typically of a high-dimensional nature, which\nleads to significant computational complexity, if performed jointly across\nmultiple sensing dimensions, such as space, frequency, and time. Additionally,\ndue to the incorporation of sensing on top of the data transmission, the time\nwindow available for sensing is likely to be short, resulting in an estimation\nproblem where only a single snapshot is accessible. In this work, we propose\nPLAIN, a tensor-based estimation architecture that flexibly scales with\nmultiple sensing dimensions and can handle high dimensionality, limited\nmeasurement time, and super-resolution requirements. It consists of three\nstages: a compression stage, where the high dimensional input is converted into\nlower dimensionality, without sacrificing resolution; a decoupled estimation\nstage, where the parameters across the different dimensions are estimated in\nparallel with low complexity; an input-based fusion stage, where the decoupled\nparameters are fused together to form a paired multidimensional estimate.

After establishing the\nexistence, uniqueness and regularity of the solution, we prove its exponential\nconvergence with respect to the time. Additionally, we extend the CDA to\naddress the problem of missing viscosity coefficients and analyze its\nconvergence order, too. Furthermore, utilizing the predictive capabilities of\npartial evolutionary tensor neural networks (pETNNs) for time-dependent\nproblems, we propose a novel CDA by replacing observational data with\npredictions got by pETNNs. Compared with the classical CDA, the new one can\nachieve similar approximation accuracy but need much less computational cost.\nSome numerical experiments are presented, which not only validate the\ntheoretical results, but also demonstrate the efficiency of the CDA.",

Studies suggest that EMS modulates dendritic cell\n(DC) maturation in adjuvant arthritis (AA) rats, though the precise mechanisms\nremain unclear. Prostaglandin receptor 4 (EP4) is critical in inflammation and\nDC function, while cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) regulates cellular\nsignaling, potentially influencing RA pathogenesis via protein kinase A (PKA)\nand cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) activation. EMS exerts\nprotective effects in RA rats by suppressing DC functions, including reduced\nEP4 mRNA/protein expression, diminished cAMP levels, and impaired CREB\nphosphorylation. Additionally, serum from EMS-treated rats inhibited antigen\nuptake by bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs), downregulating CD40, CD80, and CD86\nexpression and altering pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion. Mechanistically,\nEMS-treated serum suppressed the EP4-cAMP pathway by decreasing EP4 protein\nexpression and CREB activation, alongside reduced intracellular cAMP and PKA\nlevels in BMDCs co-stimulated with PGE2 and TNF-a. These findings indicate that\nEMS alleviates RA by inhibiting the EP4-cAMP-CREB signaling axis in DCs,\nproviding a scientific rationale for its clinical application in RA treatment.",

    "abstract": "The inability of autonomous vehicles (AVs) to infer the material properties\nof obstacles limits their decision-making capacity. While AVs rely on sensor\nsystems such as cameras, LiDAR, and radar to detect obstacles, this study\nsuggests combining sensors with a knowledge graph (KG)-based world model to\nimprove AVs' comprehension of physical material qualities. Beyond sensor data,\nAVs can infer qualities such as malleability, density, and elasticity using a\nsemantic KG that depicts the relationships between obstacles and their\nattributes. Using the CARLA autonomous driving simulator, we evaluated AV\nperformance with and without KG integration. The findings demonstrate that the\nKG-based method improves obstacle management, which allows AVs to use material\nqualities to make better decisions about when to change lanes or apply\nemergency braking. For example, the KG-integrated AV changed lanes for hard\nimpediments like traffic cones and successfully avoided collisions with\nflexible items such as plastic bags by passing over them. Compared to the\ncontrol system, the KG framework demonstrated improved responsiveness to\nobstacles by resolving conflicting sensor data, causing emergency stops for\n13.3% more cases. In addition, our method exhibits a 6.6% higher success rate\nin lane-changing maneuvers in experimental scenarios, particularly for larger,\nhigh-impact obstacles.

    "abstract": "Solar flares are frequently accompanied by coronal mass ejections (CMEs) that\nrelease significant amount of energetic plasma into interplanetary space,\npotentially causing geomagnetic disturbances on Earth. However, many solar\nflares have no association with CMEs. The relationship between solar flare and\nCME occurrences remains unclear. Therefore, it is valuable to distinguish\nbetween active regions that potentially produce flares and CMEs and those that\ndo not. It is believed that the eruptivity of a flare can be characterized by\nthe properties of the active region from which it originates. In this study, we\nanalyzed selected active regions that produced solar flares with and without\nCMEs during solar cycle 24. We carefully calculated the electric current\nneutralization of each active region by selecting relevant magnetic fluxes\nbased on their connectivities using nonlinear force-free field models.\nAdditionally, we analyzed their stabilities against the torus instability by\nestimating the proxies of critical heights of the active regions. We found that\nseveral non-eruptive active regions, which lacked clear signatures of neutral\nelectric currents, exhibited a more apparent relationship with high critical\nheights of torus instability. Furthermore, we introduced a new non-dimensional\nparameter that incorporates current neutralization and critical height. We\nfound that analysing ARs based on this new parameter can better discriminate\neruptive and non-eruptive flare events compared to analysis that relied solely\non current neutralization or torus instability. This indicates that torus\ninstability analysis is necessary to complement electric current neutralization\nin characterizing the eruptivity of solar flares.",

The\ncore idea behind our method is to express the number of infectious individuals\nas a function of the proportion of contacts that were with infected individuals\nand use this number as a starting point to initialize the remaining\ncompartments of the model. As an important consequence, using our method, we\ncan estimate key indicators such as the effective reproduction number using\nonly two types of daily aggregated contact information, namely the average\nnumber of contacts and the average number of those contacts that were with an\ninfected individual. We apply our method to the recent COVID-19 epidemic in the\nNetherlands, using self-reported data from the health surveillance app COVID\nRADAR and proximity-based data from the contact tracing app CoronaMelder. For\nboth data sources, our corresponding estimates of the effective reproduction\nnumber agree both in time and magnitude with estimates based on other more\ndetailed data sources such as daily numbers of cases and hospitalizations. This\nsuggests that the use of DCM data in transmission models, regardless of the\nprecise data type and for example via our method, offers a promising\nalternative for estimating the state of an epidemic, especially when more\ndetailed data are not available.",

As new tasks arrive, naive model expansion leads to\nrapid parameter growth, while modifying shared routing components often causes\ncatastrophic forgetting, undermining previously learned knowledge. To address\nthese issues, we propose LLaVA-CMoE, a continual learning framework for LLMs\nthat requires no replay data of previous tasks and ensures both parameter\nefficiency and robust knowledge retention. Our approach introduces a\nProbe-Guided Knowledge Extension mechanism, which uses probe experts to\ndynamically determine when and where new experts should be added, enabling\nadaptive and minimal parameter expansion tailored to task complexity.\nFurthermore, we present a Probabilistic Task Locator that assigns each task a\ndedicated, lightweight router. To handle the practical issue that task labels\nare unknown during inference, we leverage a VAE-based reconstruction strategy\nto identify the most suitable router by matching input distributions, allowing\nautomatic and accurate expert allocation. This design mitigates routing\nconflicts and catastrophic forgetting, enabling robust continual learning\nwithout explicit task labels. Extensive experiments on the CoIN benchmark,\ncovering eight diverse VQA tasks, demonstrate that LLaVA-CMoE delivers strong\ncontinual learning performance with a compact model size, significantly\nreducing forgetting and parameter overhead compared to prior methods.

That expectation is unfair to quantum algorithms: in\nclassical ILP solvers, after many decades of evolution, many different\nalgorithms work together as a robust machine to get the best result. This is\nthe approach we would like to follow now with our quantum 'solver' solutions.\nIn this study we wrap any suitable quantum optimization algorithm into a\nquantum informed classical constraint generation framework. First we relax our\nproblem by dropping all constraints and encode it into an Ising Hamiltonian for\nthe quantum optimization subroutine. Then, by sampling from the solution state\nof the subroutine, we obtain information about constraint violations in the\ninitial problem, from which we decide which coupling terms we need to introduce\nto the Hamiltonian. The coupling terms correspond to the constraints of the\ninitial binary linear program. Then we optimize over the new Hamiltonian again,\nuntil we reach a feasible solution, or other stopping conditions hold. Since\none can decide how many constraints they add to the Hamiltonian in a single\nstep, our algorithm is at least as efficient as the (hybrid) quantum\noptimization algorithm it wraps. We support our claim with results on small\nscale minimum cost exact cover problem instances.",

In industrial environments, especially the food processing\nindustries, the components maintained at specific temperatures can act as a\nsubstrate, leading to the fomite mode of infection. We hypothesize that\nsubstrate temperature influences the desiccation dynamics, bacterial deposition\npatterns, and bacterial viability and infectivity. Experiments We conducted a\nnovel study on the desiccation behaviour of bacteria-laden droplets on\nhydrophilic substrates at different temperatures, an area rarely explored. Such\nstudies have been rarely attempted. We analysed bacterial deposition patterns,\nmass transport dynamics, and viability across various base fluids used in food\nindustry, such as Milli-Q water, LB media, and meat extract. Thermal imaging,\nconfocal microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and\noptical profilometry characterized pattern formations, while bacterial\nviability and infectivity were assessed post-desiccation Findings Our results\nindicate that substrate temperature significantly affects bacterial deposition\nand viability. With Milli-Q water, lower temperatures resulted in ring-like\ndeposits, while higher temperatures led to thinner rings with inner deposits\ndue to Marangoni convection. Radial velocities at 50{\\deg}C were an order of\nmagnitude higher than 25{\\deg}C. For LB media, dendritic patterns varied with\ntemperature, whereas meat extract patterns remained unchanged. At 60{\\deg}C,\nbacterial surface area was significantly reduced compared to 25{\\deg}C while\nmaintaining a constant aspect ratio. Higher temperatures reduced bacterial\nviability in precipitates, but bacterial infectivity remained nearly unchanged\nacross all base fluids.

By varying the scale radius and mass of the progenitor's dark\nmatter halo (DMH), around the range predicted by the $\\Lambda$CDM model, we\nsuccessfully reproduce the spatial features of these substructures. Across the\nlimited range of parameters considered in this study, our analysis shows that\nthe spatial evolution of NES and WS is independent of the gravitational\npotential of the DMH associated with the progenitor, while a shallower\npotential shifts EE further north. The simulations clearly demonstrate that the\nprogenitor with a DMH mass of $9\\times10^9M_\\odot$ colliding with M31 850 Myr\nago could simultaneously form al thes esubstructures. The simulation results\nindicate that EE lies several 10kpc closer to us than the aligned Stream Cp,\nwhich is actually a metal-poor component of Stream C, whose farther distance\nsuggests overlapping debris from distinct collision events, while both remain\nclosely aligned in celestial coordinates. Furthermore, we predict the existence\nof a positive stream along the AGSS, characterized by positive line-of-sight\nvelocities relative to M31, which complements an already observed negative\nstream exhibiting negative line-of-sight velocities. Finally, we propose that\nthree objects, namely Stream B, a metal-rich component of Stream C known as\nStream Cr, and EE, are components of the Andromeda Giant Southern Arc (AGSA)\nconnected to the AGSS.

To reduce the fine-tuning costs on\nresource-constrained devices, FedLoRA is proposed to fine-tune only a small\nsubset of model parameters by integrating low-rank adaptation (LoRA) into\nFedLLM. However, apart from resource constraints, there is still another\ncritical challenge, i.e., data heterogeneity, severely hindering the\nimplementation of FedLoRA in practical applications. Herein, inspired by the\nprevious group-based federated learning paradigm, we propose a hierarchical\nFedLoRA framework, termed HierFedLoRA, to address these challenges.\nSpecifically, HierFedLoRA partitions all devices into multiple near-IID groups\nand adjusts the intra-group aggregation frequency for each group to eliminate\nthe negative effects of non-IID data. Meanwhile, to reduce the computation and\ncommunication cost, HierFedLoRA dynamically assigns diverse and suitable\nfine-tuning depth (i.e., the number of continuous fine-tuning layers from the\noutput) for each group. HierFedLoRA explores jointly optimizing aggregation\nfrequency and depth upon their coupled relationship to better enhance the\nperformance of FedLoRA. Extensive experiments are conducted on a physical\nplatform with 80 commercial devices.

    "abstract": "Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) has become fundamental to modern\ndeep learning applications, having gained particular prominence through its\nintegration into recent generative models that work with increasingly complex\ndatasets and higher vector dimensions. Existing CPU-only solutions, even the\nmost efficient graph-based ones, struggle to meet these growing computational\ndemands, while GPU-only solutions face memory constraints. As a solution, we\npropose PilotANN, a hybrid CPU-GPU system for graph-based ANNS that utilizes\nboth CPU's abundant RAM and GPU's parallel processing capabilities. Our\napproach decomposes the graph traversal process of top-$k$ search into three\nstages: GPU-accelerated subgraph traversal using SVD-reduced vectors, CPU\nrefinement and precise search using complete vectors. Furthermore, we introduce\nfast entry selection to improve search starting points while maximizing GPU\nutilization. Experimental results demonstrate that PilotANN achieves $3.9 - 5.4\n\\times$ speedup in throughput on 100-million scale datasets, and is able to\nhandle datasets up to $12 \\times$ larger than the GPU memory. We offer a\ncomplete open-source implementation at https://github.com/ytgui/PilotANN.",

Beyond their chemical composition, these polymers often exhibit spatial\nvariations in physical properties. For instance, in biopolymers such as\nchromatin, stiffness heterogeneity arises from inherent molecular features as\nwell as extensile or contractile active forces. In this letter, we develop a\ntheoretical framework that extends the physics of flexible polymers, a widely\nused tool to describe biopolymer dynamics, to incorporate spatially varying\nstiffness. Using this approach, we specifically analyze the structure and\ndynamics of flexible heteropolymers with periodic stepwise stiffness profiles.\nWe find that stiffness heterogeneity leads to qualitative deviations in\ndynamical observables such as mean squared displacement while also increasing\nstructural anisotropy. Altogether, this framework provides a platform to\ninterpret stiffness heterogeneity from experimental data especially for\nbiopolymers as well as to design heteropolymers with tailored structural and\ndynamic properties.",

Recent advancements in\nthe geospatial-temporal modelling field have focused on the inclusion of\ngeographical weighting in their deep learning models to account for nonspatial\nstationarity, which is often apparent in spatial data. We formulate a novel\nsemi-analytical approach to solving Geographically and Temporally Weighted\nRegression (GTWR), and applying it to London crime data.

This paper presents\nmathematical advances to the Geographically and Temporally Weighted Neural\nNetwork (GTWNN) framework, which offers a novel contribution to the field.\nInsights from past literature are harmoniously employed with the assumptions\nand approximations to generate three mathematical extensions to GTWNN's\nframework. Combinations of these extensions produce five novel ANNs, applied to\nthe London and Detroit datasets. The results suggest that one of the extensions\nis redundant and is generally surpassed by another extension, which we term the\nhistory-dependent module. The remaining extensions form three novel ANN designs\nthat pose potential GTWNN improvements.

This paper proposes a multi-scale feature collabora-tion\nframework guided by DINOv2 for SAM2, with core innovations in three aspects:\n(1) Establishing a feature collaboration mechanism between DINOv2 and SAM2\nbackbones, where high-dimensional semantic features extracted by the\nself-supervised model guide multi-scale feature fusion; (2) Designing\nlightweight adapter modules and cross-modal, cross-layer feature fusion units\nto inject cross-domain knowledge while freezing the base model parameters; (3)\nConstructing a U-shaped network structure based on U-net, which utilizes\nattention mechanisms to achieve adaptive aggregation decoding of\nmulti-granularity features.

VELC is designed to carry\nout imaging and spectroscopic observations (the latter in three emission lines\nof the corona), simultaneously. Images of the solar corona in the continuum at\n5000 A, with a field of view (FoV) from 1.05 Ro to 3 Ro can be obtained at\nvariable intervals depending on the data volume that can be downloaded.\nSpectroscopic observations of the solar corona in three emission lines, namely\n5303 A Fexiv, 7892 A Fexi, and 10747 A Fexiii are possible simultaneously, with\ndifferent exposure times and cadence. Four slits, each of width 50 um,\nseparated by 3.75 mm help to simultaneously obtain spectra at four positions in\nthe solar corona at all the aforementioned lines. A Linear Scan Mechanism (LSM)\nmakes it possible to scan the solar corona up to +/-1.5 Ro. The instrument has\nthe facility to carry out spectropolarimetric observations at 10747 A also in\nthe FoV range 1.05 - 1.5 Ro. Various components of the instrument were tested\ninterferometrically on the optical bench before installation.

In this work, we present a scalable Python implementation\nof a recently proposed shadow molecular dynamics scheme based on a charge\nequilibration model, which avoids the convergence problem while maintaining\nlong-term energy stability and accuracy of observable properties. To deliver a\nfunctional and user-friendly Python-based library, we implemented an efficient\nneighbor list algorithm, Particle Mesh Ewald, and traditional Ewald summation\ntechniques, leveraging the GPU-accelerated power of Triton and PyTorch. We\nintegrated these approaches with the Python-based shadow molecular dynamics\nscheme, enabling fast charge equilibration for scalable machine learning\npotentials involving systems with hundreds of thousands of atoms.",

    "abstract": "In many service markets, expert providers possess an information advantage\nover consumers regarding the necessary services, creating opportunities for\nfraudulent practices. These may involve overtreatment through unnecessary\nservices or undertreatment with ineffective solutions that fail to address\nconsumers' problems. When issues are resolved, consumers exit the market; when\nunresolved, they must decide whether to revisit the initial provider or seek a\nnew one. Little is known about how repeated interactions and the consumer\nsearch process influence expert fraud and consumer welfare in such markets. We\ndevelop a dynamic game-theoretic model to examine the role of consumer search\nbehavior and repeated interactions between consumers and service providers. We\nfind that overtreatment and undertreatment can arise simultaneously in\nequilibrium. Interestingly, undertreatment-being less costly for the\nconsumer-can initially act as a \"hook\" to induce acceptance of a minor\ntreatment recommendation. When this minor treatment fails to resolve the issue,\nit can generate additional demand for a more expensive and serious treatment.\nThis would arise when the cost of revisiting the initial provider is lower than\nthat of searching for a new one. The extent of undertreatment exhibits a\nnon-monotonic relationship with consumers' ex ante belief about the nature of\ntheir problems and the market's ethical level. Our results can shed light on\nhow market ethical levels, provider capabilities and capacities, and consumer\nprivacy protection policies interact with undertreatment and affect consumer\nwelfare. Specifically, consumer welfare can decrease as the market becomes more\nethical. Enhancing providers' diagnostic capabilities and capacities can\nexacerbate undertreatment. Providing access to consumers' diagnosis histories\ncan help mitigate the undertreatment issue and improve consumer welfare.",

Our earlier research revealed a\nsignificant correlation between the distribution of double-strand breaks (DSBs)\nwithin the 3D genome and radiation-induced cell death, which offers valuable\ninsights into the oxygen effect. In this study, we formulate a model where the\nreaction of oxygen is represented as the probability of inducing DNA strand\nbreaks. Then it is integrated into a track-structure Monte Carlo simulation to\ninvestigate the impact of oxygen on the spatial distribution of DSBs within the\n3D genome. Results show that the incidence ratios of clustered DSBs in a single\ntopologically associating domain (TAD) (case 2) and DSBs in\nfrequently-interacting TADs (case 3) under aerobic and hypoxic conditions\nclosely align with the trend of the OER of cell survival across various LET\nvalues. By utilizing the parameters derived from our previous study, we\ncalculate the OER values related to cell survival. Our OER curves exhibit good\ncorrespondence with experimental data. This study provides a potentially\nmechanistic explanation for the changes in OER across different LET levels.\nHigh-LET irradiation leads to dense ionization events, resulting in an\noverabundance of lesions that readily induce case 2 and case 3. The\nprobabilities of cell death associated with case 2 and case 3 are substantially\nhigher than other damage patterns. This may contribute to the main mechanism\ngoverning the variation of OER for high LET.

    "abstract": "Robot navigation in densely populated environments presents significant\nchallenges, particularly regarding the interplay between individual and group\ndynamics. Current navigation models predominantly address interactions with\nindividual pedestrians while failing to account for human groups that naturally\nform in real-world settings. Conversely, the limited models implementing\ngroup-aware navigation typically prioritize group dynamics at the expense of\nindividual interactions, both of which are essential for socially appropriate\nnavigation. This research extends an existing simulation framework to\nincorporate both individual pedestrians and human groups. We present Tangent\nAction for Group Avoidance (TAGA), a modular reactive mechanism that can be\nintegrated with existing navigation frameworks to enhance their group-awareness\ncapabilities. TAGA dynamically modifies robot trajectories using tangent\naction-based avoidance strategies while preserving the underlying model's\ncapacity to navigate around individuals. Additionally, we introduce Group\nCollision Rate (GCR), a novel metric to quantitatively assess how effectively\nrobots maintain group integrity during navigation. Through comprehensive\nsimulation-based benchmarking, we demonstrate that integrating TAGA with\nstate-of-the-art navigation models (ORCA, Social Force, DS-RNN, and AG-RL)\nreduces group intrusions by 45.7-78.6% while maintaining comparable success\nrates and navigation efficiency.

    "abstract": "The presence of adversarial examples in the physical world poses significant\nchallenges to the deployment of Deep Neural Networks in safety-critical\napplications such as autonomous driving. Most existing methods for crafting\nphysical-world adversarial examples are ad-hoc, relying on temporary\nmodifications like shadows, laser beams, or stickers that are tailored to\nspecific scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a new class of physical-world\nadversarial examples, AdvWT, which draws inspiration from the naturally\noccurring phenomenon of `wear and tear', an inherent property of physical\nobjects. Unlike manually crafted perturbations, `wear and tear' emerges\norganically over time due to environmental degradation, as seen in the gradual\ndeterioration of outdoor signboards. To achieve this, AdvWT follows a two-step\napproach. First, a GAN-based, unsupervised image-to-image translation network\nis employed to model these naturally occurring damages, particularly in the\ncontext of outdoor signboards. The translation network encodes the\ncharacteristics of damaged signs into a latent `damage style code'. In the\nsecond step, we introduce adversarial perturbations into the style code,\nstrategically optimizing its transformation process. This manipulation subtly\nalters the damage style representation, guiding the network to generate\nadversarial images where the appearance of damages remains perceptually\nrealistic, while simultaneously ensuring their effectiveness in misleading\nneural networks. Through comprehensive experiments on two traffic sign\ndatasets, we show that AdvWT effectively misleads DNNs in both digital and\nphysical domains. AdvWT achieves an effective attack success rate, greater\nrobustness, and a more natural appearance compared to existing physical-world\nadversarial examples. Additionally, integrating AdvWT into training enhances a\nmodel's generalizability to real-world damaged signs.",

    "abstract": "In the era of data-driven machine-learning applications, privacy concerns and\nthe scarcity of labeled data have become paramount challenges. These challenges\nare particularly pronounced in the domain of few-shot learning, where the\nability to learn from limited labeled data is crucial. Privacy-preserving\nfew-shot learning algorithms have emerged as a promising solution to address\nsuch pronounced challenges. However, it is well-known that privacy-preserving\ntechniques often lead to a drop in utility due to the fundamental trade-off\nbetween data privacy and model performance. To enhance the utility of\nprivacy-preserving few-shot learning methods, we introduce a novel approach\ncalled Meta-Clip. This technique is specifically designed for meta-learning\nalgorithms, including Differentially Private (DP) model-agnostic meta-learning,\nDP-Reptile, and DP-MetaSGD algorithms, with the objective of balancing data\nprivacy preservation with learning capacity maximization. By dynamically\nadjusting clipping thresholds during the training process, our Adaptive\nClipping method provides fine-grained control over the disclosure of sensitive\ninformation, mitigating overfitting on small datasets and significantly\nimproving the generalization performance of meta-learning models. Through\ncomprehensive experiments on diverse benchmark datasets, we demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our approach in minimizing utility degradation, showcasing a\nsuperior privacy-utility trade-off compared to existing privacy-preserving\ntechniques.

The methodology involved constructing network graphs\nusing distance correlation coefficients at varying thresholds (0.4, 0.5, 0.6,\nand 0.8) and analyzing the time-series data of network density and clustering\ncoefficients. Results revealed three key findings: (1) an inverse relationship\nbetween the threshold values and network metrics, indicating that higher\nthresholds provide more meaningful keyword relationships; (2) exceptionally\nhigh network connectivity during the initial pandemic months followed by\ngradual decline; and (3) distinct patterns in keyword relationships,\ntransitioning from policy-focused searches to more symptom-specific queries as\nthe pandemic temporally progressed. The 30-day window analysis showed more\nstable, but less search activities compared to the 15-day windows, suggesting\nstronger correlations in immediate search behaviors.

While evolutionary computation is well-known for its great\nresults both in feature selection and feature construction, its methods are\ncomputationally expensive due to the large number of evaluations required to\ninduce the final model. Part of the reason why these algorithms require a large\nnumber of evaluations is their lack of domain-specific knowledge, resulting in\na lot of random guessing during evolution. In this work, we propose using Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) as an initial feature construction step to add knowledge\nto the dataset. By doing so, our results show that the evolution can converge\nfaster, saving us computational resources. The proposed approach only provides\nthe names of the features in the dataset and the target objective to the LLM,\nmaking it usable even when working with datasets containing private data. While\nconsistent improvements to test performance were only observed for one-third of\nthe datasets (CSS, PM, and IM10), possibly due to problems being easily\nexplored by LLMs, this approach only decreased the model performance in 1/77\ntest cases.

We consider the\ntime-averaged charge and spin off-diagonal dc conductivities\n$\\sigma_{yx}^{\\textrm{C}}$ and $\\sigma_{yx}^{\\textrm{S}}$ in the nonequilibrium\nsteady state with the pump field of light. First, we argue the Onsager\nreciprocal relations for these conductivities with the pump field of\ncircularly, linearly, or bicircularly polarized light. We show that\n$\\sigma_{yx}^{\\textrm{C}}$ and $\\sigma_{yx}^{\\textrm{S}}$ satisfy the Onsager\nreciprocal relations in all the cases considered, but their main terms depend\non the polarization of light. Our numerical calculations validate our general\narguments. Therefore, the spin current generated in periodically driven systems\nis detectable by the inverse spin Hall effect. Our numerical calculations also\nshow that $\\sigma_{yx}^{\\textrm{C}}$ cannot necessarily be regarded as the\nanomalous Hall conductivity even with broken time-reversal symmetry, whereas\n$\\sigma_{yx}^{\\textrm{S}}$ can be regarded as the spin Hall conductivity in all\nthe cases considered. Our results suggest that it is highly required to check\nthe dominant terms of the charge and spin off-diagonal conductivities in\ndiscussing the anomalous Hall and spin Hall effects, respectively. This study\nwill become a cornerstone of theoretical and experimental studies of transport\nphenomena in periodically driven systems.",

Additionally, achieving\nfine-grained control over the speaking style and nuances of facial expressions\nremains a challenge. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel\nframework for stylized real-time portrait video generation, enabling expressive\nand flexible video chat that extends from talking head to upper-body\ninteraction. Our approach consists of the following two stages. The first stage\ninvolves efficient hierarchical motion diffusion models, that take both\nexplicit and implicit motion representations into account based on audio\ninputs, which can generate a diverse range of facial expressions with stylistic\ncontrol and synchronization between head and body movements. The second stage\naims to generate portrait video featuring upper-body movements, including hand\ngestures. We inject explicit hand control signals into the generator to produce\nmore detailed hand movements, and further perform face refinement to enhance\nthe overall realism and expressiveness of the portrait video. Additionally, our\napproach supports efficient and continuous generation of upper-body portrait\nvideo in maximum 512 * 768 resolution at up to 30fps on 4090 GPU, supporting\ninteractive video-chat in real-time.

Initially, the model's solutions are confirmed to be both\npositive and bounded for nonnegative initial values. Following this, two\nbiologically critical parameters were identified: the virus reproduction number\n$\\mathcal{R}_0$ and the CTL immune reproduction number $\\mathcal{R}_1$.\nSubsequently, by invoking LaSalle's principle of invariance alongside Lyapunov\nfunctionals, we establish stability criteria for each equilibrium.

Quantization is an effective method that not only\ncompresses the models but also significantly accelerates their performance.\nExisting quantization methods have gradually shifted the focus from parameter\nscaling to the analysis of data distributions. However, their analysis is\ndesigned for dense LLMs, which are suboptimal for MoE quantization, due to\nMoEs' complex data-model distribution. To address this problem, we decouple the\ncomplexity of MoEs' data-model distribution into a multi-stage analysis and\nreveal MoEs' inherent dynamics. The analysis results show that the expert\nperformance of MoE varies dynamically both within and across data\ndistributions. Based on these, we design two quantization strategies with\ndata-model distribution awareness and integrate them into an end-to-end\nframework for MoE quantization, which is named MoQa. MoQa uses an expert-level\nmix-precision base quantization with distribution awareness. Moreover, MoQa\nuses a channel-level quantization adjustment to dynamically adjust expert\nperformance to adapt to novel distributions. Experiments show that MoQa's base\nquantization achieves a 0.49~8.51 PPL decrease on known distributions.

Despite the challenges that\nplace the two tasks at odds with each other, the results indicate that quantum\nentanglement can indeed be simultaneously and significantly beneficial for\njoint communication and instantaneous detection.",

Squared families\nare singular, however their singularity can easily be handled so that they form\nregular models. After handling the singularity, squared families possess many\nconvenient properties. Their Fisher information is a conformal transformation\nof the Hessian metric induced from a Bregman generator. The Bregman generator\nis the normalising constant, and yields a statistical divergence on the family.\nThe normalising constant admits a helpful parameter-integral factorisation,\nmeaning that only one parameter-independent integral needs to be computed for\nall normalising constants in the family, unlike in exponential families.\nFinally, the squared family kernel is the only integral that needs to be\ncomputed for the Fisher information, statistical divergence and normalising\nconstant. We then describe how squared families are special in the broader\nclass of $g$-families, which are obtained by applying a sufficiently regular\nfunction $g$ to a linear transformation of a statistic. After removing special\nsingularities, positively homogeneous families and exponential families are the\nonly $g$-families for which the Fisher information is a conformal\ntransformation of the Hessian metric, where the generator depends on the\nparameter only through the normalising constant.

Conventional deep learning methodologies employing\nsmall language models (SLMs) suffer from the necessity for extensive supervised\ntraining and the challenge of adapting to rapidly evolving circumstances. Large\nlanguage models (LLMs), despite their robust zero-shot capabilities, have\nfallen short in effectively identifying fake news due to a lack of pertinent\ndemonstrations and the dynamic nature of knowledge.

Two-server ORAM, designed for secure two-party RAM computation,\nstores data across two non-colluding servers. However, many two-server ORAM\nschemes suffer from excessive local storage or high bandwidth costs. To serve\nlightweight clients, it is crucial for ORAM to achieve concretely efficient\nbandwidth while maintaining O(1) local storage. Hence, this paper presents two\nnew client-friendly two-server ORAM schemes that achieve practical logarithmic\nbandwidth under O(1) local storage, while incurring linear symmetric key\ncomputations. The core design features a hierarchical structure and a\npairwise-area setting for the elements and their tags.

In this paper, we\ndesign an Large Language Model (LLM)-driven risk assessment pipeline integrated\nwith multiple analytical tools to evaluate logistic hub deployment. This\nframework enables LLMs to systematically identify potential risks by analyzing\nunstructured data, such as geopolitical instability, financial trends,\nhistorical storm events, traffic conditions, and emerging risks from news\nsources. These data are processed through a suite of analytical tools, which\nare automatically called by LLMs to support a structured and data-driven\ndecision-making process for logistic hub selection. In addition, we design\nprompts that instruct LLMs to leverage these tools for assessing the\nfeasibility of hub selection by evaluating various risk types and levels.\nThrough risk-based similarity analysis, LLMs cluster logistic hubs with\ncomparable risk profiles, enabling a structured approach to risk assessment. In\nconclusion, the framework incorporates scalability with long-term memory and\nenhances decision-making through explanation and interpretation, enabling\ncomprehensive risk assessments for logistic hub deployment in hyperconnected\nsupply chain networks.",

Furthermore, in the presence of time-varying scattering, our\ntime-gate can reduce the resulting scintillation by two orders of magnitude. In\ncontrast to traditional bulk nonlinear materials, time gating by sum-FWM in a\nsub-wavelength-thick ENZ film can produce a scattering-free upconverted signal\nat a visible wavelength without sacrificing spatial resolution, which is\nusually limited by the phase-matching condition.

Since position errors between antenna arrays affect the\ncoherent processing of measurements from these arrays, it is commonly believed\nthat its angular resolution is influenced. A key question is whether and how\nmuch the angular resolution of partly calibrated arrays is affected by the\nposition errors, in comparison with ideally calibrated arrays. To address this\nfundamental problem, we theoretically illustrate that partly calibrated arrays\napproximately achieve high angular resolution. Our analysis uses a special\ncharacteristic of Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRB) w.r.t. the source separation:\nWhen the source separation increases, the CRB first declines rapidly, then\nplateaus out, and the turning point is close to the angular resolution limit.\nThis means that the turning point of CRB can be used to indicate angular\nresolution. We then theoretically analyze the declining and plateau phases of\nCRB, and explain that the turning point of CRB in partly calibrated arrays is\nclose to the angular resolution limit of distributed arrays without errors,\ndemonstrating high resolution ability.

    "abstract": "Cosmological perturbation theory provides a fundamental framework for\nanalyzing the evolution of density fluctuations and gravitational potentials in\nthe Universe. It plays a crucial role in understanding large-scale structure\nformation and cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies. In this study, we\napply perturbation theory to the minimally extended varying speed of light\n(meVSL) model to investigate the effects of a varying speed of light on the\nmatter density contrast and the Newtonian gravitational potential. Unlike\nconventional models with a constant speed of light, the meVSL model introduces\nmodifications to the cosmological evolution equations, leading to potential\ndeviations in structure formation and gravitational interactions. By deriving\nand analyzing the perturbed equations within this framework, we explore how a\nvarying speed of light affects the growth of density perturbations and the\nevolution of gravitational potentials. Compared to the standard constant speed\nof the light model, we find deviations of approximately $2$\\% in the subhorizon\nmodes of both quantities. Although detecting these effects observationally\nremains a significant challenge, our results provide new theoretical insights\ninto the meVSL model and its potential observational signatures, such as the\nintegrated Sachs-Wolfe effect and gravitational lensing of the CMB.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces function alignment, a novel theory of mind and\nintelligence that is both intuitively compelling and structurally grounded. It\nexplicitly models how meaning, interpretation, and analogy emerge from\ninteractions among layered representations, forming a coherent framework\ncapable not only of modeling minds but also of serving as a blueprint for\nbuilding them. One of the key theoretical insights derived from function\nalignment is bounded interpretability, which provides a unified explanation for\npreviously fragmented ideas in cognitive science, such as bounded rationality,\nsymbol grounding, and analogy-making. Beyond modeling, the function alignment\nframework bridges disciplines often kept apart, linking computational\narchitecture, psychological theory, and even contemplative traditions such as\nZen. Rather than building on any philosophical systems, it offers a structural\nfoundation upon which multiple ways of understanding the mind may be\nreconstructed.",

Graph classification is a pivotal task\nin data mining with applications in social network analysis, web analysis, drug\ndiscovery, molecular property prediction, etc. Graph neural networks have\nachieved the state-of-the-art performance in graph classification, but they\nconsistently struggle with overfitting. To mitigate overfitting, researchers\nhave introduced various representation learning methods utilizing graph\naugmentation. However, existing methods rely on simplistic use of graph\naugmentation, which loses augmentation-induced differences and limits the\nexpressiveness of representations.\n  In this paper, we propose AugWard (Augmentation-Aware Training with Graph\nDistance and Consistency Regularization), a novel graph representation learning\nframework that carefully considers the diversity introduced by graph\naugmentation. AugWard applies augmentation-aware training to predict the graph\ndistance between the augmented graph and its original one, aligning the\nrepresentation difference directly with graph distance at both feature and\nstructure levels. Furthermore, AugWard employs consistency regularization to\nencourage the classifier to handle richer representations.

Furthermore, we\nformulate an optimization problem to construct the AAP codebook, aiming to\nminimize the ABEP.

In recent years, active learning, where a surrogate machine\nlearning (ML) model mimics the scientific discovery process of a human\nscientist, has emerged as a promising approach to address these challenges by\nguiding experimentation toward high-value outcomes with a limited budget. Among\nthe diverse active learning philosophies, the concept of surprise (capturing\nthe divergence between expected and observed outcomes) has demonstrated\nsignificant potential to drive experimental trials and refine predictive\nmodels. Scientific discovery often stems from surprise thereby making it a\nnatural driver to guide the search process. Despite its promise, prior studies\nleveraging surprise metrics such as Shannon and Bayesian surprise lack\nmechanisms to account for prior confidence, leading to excessive exploration of\nuncertain regions that may not yield useful information. To address this, we\npropose the Confidence-Adjusted Surprise Measure for Active Resourceful Trials\n(CA-SMART), a novel Bayesian active learning framework tailored for optimizing\ndata-driven experimentation. On a high level, CA-SMART incorporates\nConfidence-Adjusted Surprise (CAS) to dynamically balance exploration and\nexploitation by amplifying surprises in regions where the model is more certain\nwhile discounting them in highly uncertain areas. We evaluated CA-SMART on two\nbenchmark functions (Six-Hump Camelback and Griewank) and in predicting the\nfatigue strength of steel. The results demonstrate superior accuracy and\nefficiency compared to traditional surprise metrics, standard Bayesian\nOptimization (BO) acquisition functions and conventional ML methods.",

Strikingly, despite the fact that both\nindividual layers are antiferromagnetic insulators, the interfaced\nheterostructure exhibits emergent metallicity. Through transport measurements,\nmagnetic characterization, and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy\n(ARPES), we analyze the underlying mechanisms governing this insulator-to-metal\ntransition. Our findings reveal that the transition is driven by\ninterface-induced magnetic reconstruction, which is further corroborated by\ndensity functional theory (DFT) calculations. The staggered\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction at the SIO/SRO interface is identified as the\nkey driving force for this spin reorganization, as it stabilizes ferromagnetism\nin the coupled antiferromagnetic insulating layers.

Therefore, various fairness-aware information\nretrieval methods have been proposed.

In contrast,\nlearning-to-rank-based fairness-aware information retrieval algorithms using\nfairness-aware loss functions demonstrate strong performance but lack\ninterpretability. In this study, we proposed a novel and interpretable\nframework that recursively refines query keywords to retrieve documents from\nunderrepresented groups and achieve group fairness.

Effective Hamiltonians are derived\nup to the second order in the perturbation parameters. These effective\ndescriptions reveal higher-order qubit-oscillator cross-Kerr and oscillator\nself-Kerr terms. The cross-Kerr term combines a qubit Pauli operator with an\n$n$-degree polynomial in the oscillator photon number operator, while the\nself-Kerr term is an $(n-1)$-degree polynomial in the oscillator photon number\noperator. In addition to the higher-order Kerr terms, a qubit-conditional\n$2n$-photon squeezing term appears in the effective\nnon-rotating-wave-approximation Hamiltonian. Furthermore, perturbation theory\nis applied to the case of multiple qubits coupled to a shared oscillator. A\nphoton-number-dependent qubit-qubit interaction emerges in this case, which can\nbe leveraged to tune the effective multiqubit system parameters using the\noscillator state. Results for the converse setup of multiple oscillators and a\nsingle qubit are also derived. In this case, a qubit-conditional\noscillator-oscillator nonlinear interaction is found. The spectral\ninstabilities plaguing multiphoton qubit-oscillator models are carefully\ntreated by introducing stabilizing higher-order terms in the Hamiltonian.

This challenge has hindered the broad\napplication of RL techniques to larger and more complex quantum control issues,\nlimiting their adaptability. In this work, we use Reinforcement Learning from\nDemonstration (RLfD) to leverage the control sequences generated with system\nmodels and further optimize them with RL to avoid model bias. By avoiding\nlearning from scratch and starting with reasonable control pulse shapes, this\napproach can increase sample efficiency by reducing the number of samples,\nwhich can significantly reduce the training time. Thus, this method can\neffectively handle pulse shapes that are discretized into more than 1000 pieces\nwithout compromising final fidelity.

To\nexplore the impact of the cluster's dynamical state on the BCG luminosity, we\nseparate the main sample according to the dynamical state. We define clusters\nas relaxed if D$_{\\rm BCG-X}$ < 0.25$r_{500}$, disturbed if D$_{\\rm\nBCG-X}$>0.5$r_{500}$, and as `diverse' otherwise. We find no evolution of the\nmerging fraction in redshift and mass. We observe that the width of the relaxed\ndistribution to increase with redshift, while the width of the two Rayleigh\ndistributions decreases with mass. The analysis reveals that BCGs in relaxed\nclusters are brighter than BCGs in both the disturbed and diverse cluster\npopulation. The most significant differences are found for high mass clusters\nat higher redshift. The results suggest that BCGs in low-mass clusters are less\ncentrally bound than those in high-mass systems, irrespective of dynamical\nstate. Over time, BCGs in relaxed clusters progressively align with the\npotential center. This alignment correlates with their luminosity growth\nrelative to BCGs in dynamically disturbed clusters, underscoring the critical\nrole of the clusters dynamical state in regulating BCG evolution.

In this paper, the\nproblem of simultaneously optimising the layout and device parameters of a wave\nenergy park is considered within the framework of linear water wave theory.\nEach WEC is modelled as a heaving truncated cylinder coupled to a spring-damper\npower take-off. The single-WEC scattering problem is solved using an integral\nequation/Galerkin method, and interactions between the WECs are solved via a\nself-consistent multiple scattering theory. The layout of the array and power\ntake-off parameters of its constituent devices are simultaneously optimised\nusing a genetic algorithm, with the goal of maximising energy absorption under\na unidirectional, irregular sea described by a Pierson--Moskowitz spectrum.\nWhen constrained to a rectangular bounding box that is elongated in the\ndirection of wave propagation, the optimal arrays consist of graded pseudo-line\narrays when the number of WECs is sufficiently large. Moreover, low-frequency\nwaves propagate further into the array than high-frequency waves, which is\nindicative of rainbow absorption, namely, the effect wherein waves spatially\nseparate in a graded array based on their frequency, and are preferentially\nabsorbed at these locations. Arrays optimised for a square bounding box did not\nshow strong evidence of grading or rainbow reflection, which indicates that\nmore complicated interaction effects are present.",

Compared to the eDisk\nsample in terms of bolometric temperature, Tbol, our targets are in a\nrelatively later accretion phase. By combining our targets with the eDisk\nsample, we confirm that substructure detection in available data is restricted\nto objects where Tbol exceeds 200-300 K and the dust disk radius, Rdust, is\nlarger than ~30 au. Moreover, we find that the distribution of inclination\nangles for Class II disks has a deficit of high values and is not consistent\nwith being random.

However, many transportation\napplications-such as traffic flow modeling, optimization, and control-require\nsimplified models that are fast, interpretable, and easy to implement, while\nstill maintaining fidelity to physical energy behavior. This work builds upon a\nrecently developed model reduction pipeline that derives physics-like energy\nmodels from high-fidelity Autonomie vehicle simulations. These reduced models\npreserve essential vehicle dynamics, enabling realistic fuel consumption\nestimation with minimal computational overhead. While the reduced models have\ndemonstrated strong agreement with their Autonomie counterparts, previous\nvalidation efforts have been confined to simulation environments. This study\nextends the validation by comparing the reduced energy model's outputs against\nreal-world vehicle data. Focusing on the MidSUV category, we tune the baseline\nAutonomie model to closely replicate the characteristics of a Toyota RAV4. We\nthen assess the accuracy of the resulting reduced model in estimating fuel\nconsumption under actual drive conditions. Our findings suggest that, when the\nreference Autonomie model is properly calibrated, the simplified model produced\nby the reduction pipeline can provide reliable, semi-principled fuel rate\nestimates suitable for large-scale transportation applications.",

We explore the architectural\nfeasibility of embedding semantic and vector-based AI inference caches within\nexisting Telco assets, proposing tiered caching strategies and split-inference\narchitectures that significantly reduce latency and compute costs.\nAdditionally, we address technical challenges specific to Telcos, such as cache\nsynchronization, model distribution, privacy, and hardware acceleration\nconsiderations.

As such, RS is a catalyst for embodied AI\nagents, enabling them to interpret high-level commands without requiring\nexplicit step-by-step guidance. However, current RS approaches rely heavily on\nthe visual perception capabilities of multimodal large language models (LLMs),\nleading to several major limitations. First, they struggle with queries that\nrequire multiple steps of reasoning or those that involve complex\nspatial/temporal relationships. Second, they necessitate LLM fine-tuning, which\nmay require frequent updates to maintain compatibility with contemporary LLMs\nand may increase risks of catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning. Finally,\nbeing primarily designed for static images or offline video processing, they\nscale poorly to online video data. To address these limitations, we propose an\nagent framework that disentangles perception and reasoning for online video RS\nwithout LLM fine-tuning. Our innovation is the introduction of a just-in-time\ndigital twin concept, where -- given an implicit query -- a LLM plans the\nconstruction of a low-level scene representation from high-level video using\nspecialist vision models. We refer to this approach to creating a digital twin\nas \"just-in-time\" because the LLM planner will anticipate the need for specific\ninformation and only request this limited subset instead of always evaluating\nevery specialist model. The LLM then performs reasoning on this digital twin\nrepresentation to identify target objects. To evaluate our approach, we\nintroduce a new comprehensive video reasoning segmentation benchmark comprising\n200 videos with 895 implicit text queries.
