A more general system of coupled Gross-Pitaevskii (GP)\nequations, with g =/= 2 and the linear mixing between the components, is\nconsidered too. The latter system is introduced in its one- and two-dimensional\n(1D and 2D) forms. A new finding is the spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of\nbimodal CW (continuous-wave) states in the case of g > 1 (in the absence of the\nlinear coupling, it corresponds to the immiscibility of the nonlinearly\ninteracting components). The SSB is represented by an exact asymmetric CW\nsolution. An exact solution is also found, in the case of g = 3, for stable\ndark solitons (DSs) supported by the asymmetric CW background. For g =/= 3,\nnumerical solutions are produced for stable DSs supported by the same\nbackground. Moreover, we identify a parameter domain where the fully miscible\n(symmetric) CW background maintains stable DSs with the inner SSB (separation\nbetween the components) in its core. In 2D, the GP system produces stable\nvortex states with a shift between the components and broken isotropy. The\nvortices include ones with the inter-component shift imposed by the asymmetric\nCW background, and states supported by the symmetric background, in which the\nintrinsic shift (splitting) is exhibited by vortical cores of the two\ncomponents.",

As Kubernetes gains\nincreasing adoption for mission-critical microservices, evaluating system\nresilience under realistic fault conditions becomes crucial.

To address this gap, a novel\nresilience evaluation framework integrates mainstream fault injection tools\nwith automated workload generation for comprehensive cloud-edge Kubernetes\ntesting. Multiple fault injection platforms, including Chaos Mesh, Gremlin, and\nChaosBlade are combined with realistic traffic simulation tools, enabling\nautomated orchestration of complex failure scenarios. Through this framework,\ncomprehensive experiments are conducted that systematically target node-level,\npod-level, and network failures across cloud and cloud-edge environments. The\nfirst comprehensive resilience dataset for hybrid cloud-edge Kubernetes\ndeployments is created, comprising over 30 GB of performance data from 11,965\nfault injection scenarios including response times, failure rates, and error\npatterns. Analysis reveals that cloud-edge deployments demonstrate 80% superior\nresponse stability under network delay and partition conditions, while cloud\ndeployments exhibit 47% better resilience under bandwidth limitations,\nproviding quantitative guidance for architectural decision-making in cloud-edge\ndeployments.",

In\nthis work, we derive analytical hyperparameters from first principles,\ndepending only on the target lengthscale. We present results for both conic and\nPDE-based filtering schemes, showing that the latter is less robust due to the\nsingularity of its underlying Green's function. To address this, we also\nintroduce a double-filtering approach to obtain a well-behaved PDE-based\nfilter. Combined with our derived hyperparameters, we obtain a straightforward\nstrategy for enforcing lengthscales using geometric constraints, with minimal\nhyperparameter tuning. A key enabling factor is the recent subpixel-smooth\nprojection (SSP) method (Hammond et al. 2025), which facilitates the\nrapidly-converging optimization of almost-everywhere binary designs.

These packages\ntypically assume the data are missing at random (MAR), and impose parametric or\nsmoothing assumptions upon the imputing distributions in a way that allows\nimputation to proceed even if not all missingness patterns have support in the\ndata. Such assumptions are unrealistic in practice, and induce model\nmisspecification bias on any analysis performed after such imputation.\n  In this paper, we provide a principled alternative. Specifically, we develop\na new characterization for the full data law in graphical models of missing\ndata. This characterization is constructive, is easily adapted for the\ncalculation of imputation distributions for both MAR and MNAR (missing not at\nrandom) mechanisms, and is able to handle lack of support for certain patterns\nof missingness. We use this characterization to develop a new imputation\nalgorithm -- Multivariate Imputation via Supported Pattern Recursion (MISPR) --\nwhich uses Gibbs sampling, by analogy with the Multivariate Imputation with\nChained Equations (MICE) algorithm, but which is consistent under both MAR and\nMNAR settings, and is able to handle missing data patterns with no support\nwithout imposing additional assumptions beyond those already imposed by the\nmissing data model itself.\n  In simulations, we show MISPR obtains comparable results to MICE when data\nare MAR, and superior, less biased results when data are MNAR. Our\ncharacterization and imputation algorithm based on it are a step towards making\nprincipled missing data methods more practical in applied settings, where the\ndata are likely both MNAR and sufficiently high dimensional to yield missing\ndata patterns with no support at available sample sizes.",

Mathematical models support the\nemergence of these large-scale patterns from local decentralized interactions,\nin the absence of individual memory and group leadership. In a popular model\nwhere individual fish interact locally following rules of avoidance, alignment,\nand attraction, the group exhibits collective memory: changes in individual\nbehavior lead to emergent patterns that depend on the group's past\nconfigurations. However, the mechanisms driving this collective memory remain\nobscure. Here, we combine numerical simulations with tools from bifurcation\ntheory to uncover that the transition from milling to schooling in this model\nis driven by a noisy transcritical bifurcation where the two collective states\nintersect and exchange stability. We further show that key features of the\ngroup dynamics - the bifurcation character, transient milling, and collective\nmemory - can be captured by a phenomenological model of the group polarization.\nOur findings demonstrate that collective memory arises from a noisy bifurcation\nrather than from structural bistability, thus resolving a long-standing\nambiguity about its origins and contributing fundamental understanding to\ncollective phase transitions in a prevalent model of fish schooling.",

For the case where holding costs\nfunction of all items are the same and all backlog costs are the same, they\nprovide a constant competitive algorithm, leaving designing a constant\ncompetitive algorithm for arbitrary functions open. Moreover, they noticed that\ntheir algorithm does not work for arbitrary (request dependent) holding costs\nand backlog costs functions. We resolve their open problem and design a\nconstant competitive algorithm that works for arbitrary request dependent\nfunctions. Specifically, we establish a 4-competitive algorithm for the\nsingle-item case and a 16-competitive for the general (multi-item) version. The\nalgorithm of Moseley, Niaparast, and Ravi is based on fixed priority on the\nrequests to items, and request to an item are always served by order of\ndeadlines. In contrast, we design an algorithm with dynamic priority over the\nrequests such that instead of servicing a prefix by deadline of requests, we\nmay need to service a general subset of the requests.",

    "abstract": "The original Kerr theorem provides the foundation for Kerr-Schild\ntransformations by classifying all shear-free and geodesic null congruences in\nflat spacetime; the key ingredient of the Kerr-Schild ansatz. However, due to\nthe high level of degeneracy of the outcome it is often less practical than its\nsymmetric refinements, which may single out congruences leading to physically\nsignificant spacetimes by imposing relevant symmetries. An illustrative example\nis the stationary axisymmetric version of Kerr theorem which has been shown to\nlead directly and uniquely to the Kerr black hole in vacuum. In this work, we\npropose a new symmetric refinement of the Kerr theorem by boosting the\nstationary symmetry into its ultrarelativistic limit to achieve invariance\nunder null translations, while keeping axisymmetry. Under these assumptions,\nthe classification yields only two distinct congruences. The first congruence\nis covariantly constant and, through the Kerr-Schild ansatz, evidently yields\nan axisymmetric pp-wave. The vacuum axisymmetric profile of this pp-wave\ndisplays a logarithmic dependence on the polar radius, characteristic of the\nexterior gravitational field of the Bonnor light beam, and includes as a\nspecial case the Aichelburg-Sexl ultrarelativistic limit of the Schwarzschild\nblack hole. The Kerr-Schild transformation of the second congruence gives rise\nto a non-trivial vacuum solution recently reported in [Phys. Rev. D 112, 024020\n(2025)]. Using circularity and appropriately fixing the reparameterization\ninvariance of the orthogonal manifold to the Killing fields, we show that the\nlatter solution corresponds to the well-known Taub-NUT spacetime with planar\ntopology. These results emphasize how symmetry-based refinements of the Kerr\ntheorem constitute a powerful tool to constructing physically essential\nspacetimes.",

The crystal was\nplaced inside a copper cavity to form a dielectric-loaded microwave cavity, and\nthe transition was observed to occur near 134 K. As the cavity was cooled, the\nfrequencies of both transverse electric and transverse magnetic resonant modes\ndecreased (corresponding to an increase in permittivity). The mode frequencies\nconverge at the transition temperature (near 134 K) and, below this point,\nreverse their tuning direction, increasing their frequency with decreasing\ntemperature. This behaviour corresponds to a decrease in dielectric\npermittivity and is atypical for pure KTaO$_3$. To investigate further, we\nconducted impurity analysis using Laser Ablation inductively coupled mass\nspectrometry (LA-ICPMS), revealing a significant concentration ($\\sim$ 7\\%) of\nniobium (Nb) in the crystal. This suggests that the observed phase transition\nis driven by residual Nb impurities, which induce ferroelectricity in an\notherwise paraelectric host. Similar crystals with a lower concentration ($<$\n2\\%) did not undergo a phase transition but exhibited a loss peak at this\ntemperature. These findings have practical implications for the design of\ntunable devices, for example, resonator-based dark matter detectors, where\nlow-loss material phase stability and tunability are crucial.",

While\nFederated Learning (FL) presents a collaborative and privacy-preserving\napproach to model training, ensuring fairness is challenging due to\nheterogeneous data across institutions, and current research primarily\naddresses non-medical applications. To fill this gap, we establish the first\nexperimental benchmark for fairness in medical FL, evaluating six\nrepresentative FL methods across diverse demographic attributes and imaging\nmodalities. We introduce FairFedMed, the first medical FL dataset specifically\ndesigned to study group fairness (i.e., demographics). It comprises two parts:\nFairFedMed-Oph, featuring 2D fundus and 3D OCT ophthalmology samples with six\ndemographic attributes; and FairFedMed-Chest, which simulates real\ncross-institutional FL using subsets of CheXpert and MIMIC-CXR. Together, they\nsupport both simulated and real-world FL across diverse medical modalities and\ndemographic groups. Existing FL models often underperform on medical images and\noverlook fairness across demographic groups. To address this, we propose\nFairLoRA, a fairness-aware FL framework based on SVD-based low-rank\napproximation. It customizes singular value matrices per demographic group\nwhile sharing singular vectors, ensuring both fairness and efficiency.\nExperimental results on the FairFedMed dataset demonstrate that FairLoRA not\nonly achieves state-of-the-art performance in medical image classification but\nalso significantly improves fairness across diverse populations.

To remedy this, we built linear encoding models from six\ninterpretable feature families: mel-spectrogram, Gabor filter bank features,\nspeech presence, phonetic, syntactic, and semantic Question-Answering features,\nand contextualized embeddings from three state-of-the-art SSMs (Whisper,\nHuBERT, WavLM), quantifying the shared and unique neural variance captured by\neach feature class.

Further variance-partitioning analyses revealed previously\nunresolved components of SSM representations that contribute to their neural\nalignment: 1. Despite the common assumption that later layers of SSMs discard\nlow-level acoustic information, these models compress and preferentially retain\nfrequency bands critical for neural encoding of speech (100-1000 Hz). 2.\nContrary to previous claims, SSMs encode brain-relevant semantic information\nthat cannot be reduced to lower-level features, improving with context length\nand model size.

Using five open-source LLMs, we\nsystematically examine how different persona prompt strategies, specifically\nrole adoption formats and demographic priming strategies, influence LLM\nsimulations across 15 intersectional demographic groups in both open- and\nclosed-ended tasks. Our findings show that LLMs struggle to simulate\nmarginalized groups, particularly nonbinary, Hispanic, and Middle Eastern\nidentities, but that the choice of demographic priming and role adoption\nstrategy significantly impacts their portrayal. Specifically, we find that\nprompting in an interview-style format and name-based priming can help reduce\nstereotyping and improve alignment. Surprisingly, smaller models like OLMo-2-7B\noutperform larger ones such as Llama-3.3-70B. Our findings offer actionable\nguidance for designing sociodemographic persona prompts in LLM-based simulation\nstudies.",

    "abstract": "Deep research agents, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), are rapidly\nadvancing; yet, their performance often plateaus when generating complex,\nlong-form research reports using generic test-time scaling algorithms. Drawing\ninspiration from the iterative nature of human research, which involves cycles\nof searching, reasoning, and revision, we propose the Test-Time Diffusion Deep\nResearcher (TTD-DR). This novel framework conceptualizes research report\ngeneration as a diffusion process. TTD-DR initiates this process with a\npreliminary draft, an updatable skeleton that serves as an evolving foundation\nto guide the research direction. The draft is then iteratively refined through\na \"denoising\" process, which is dynamically informed by a retrieval mechanism\nthat incorporates external information at each step. The core process is\nfurther enhanced by a self-evolutionary algorithm applied to each component of\nthe agentic workflow, ensuring the generation of high-quality context for the\ndiffusion process. This draft-centric design makes the report writing process\nmore timely and coherent while reducing information loss during the iterative\nsearch process. We demonstrate that our TTD-DR achieves state-of-the-art\nresults on a wide array of benchmarks that require intensive search and\nmulti-hop reasoning, significantly outperforming existing deep research agents.",

We explain that two types (sources)\nof delay - transmission and reaction - are justifiable from the modeling point\nof view.

In particular, we stress\nthat with transmission-type delay, asymptotic consensus can be reached with any\nlength of the delay (i.e., without smallness assumptions). In contrast, the\nsystems with reaction-type delay can only reach asymptotic consensus if the\ndelay is sufficiently small.\n  We formulate four theorems that establish asymptotic consensus in the\nfollowing scenarios: (1) transmission-type delay with classical communication\nweights, (2) transmission-type delay with normalized communication weights, (3)\nreaction-type delay with symmetric communication weights, (4) reaction-type\ndelay with non-symmetric communication weights.\n  We explain how the methods of proof depend on the particular scenario: direct\nestimates for (1), convexity arguments for (2), Lyapunov functional for (3) and\ngeneralized Gronwall-Halanay inequality for (4).",

With the increasing sophistication of attack\ntechniques, the threat of unauthorized access is no longer confined to the\nconventional ones, such as exploiting weak access control policies. Instead,\nadvanced exploitation strategies, such as session hijacking-based attacks, are\nbecoming increasingly prevalent, posing serious security concerns. Session\nhijacking enables attackers to take over an already established session between\nlegitimate peers in a stealthy manner, thereby gaining unauthorized access to\nprivate resources. Unfortunately, traditional access control mechanisms, such\nas static access control policies, are insufficient to prevent session\nhijacking or other advanced exploitation techniques. In this work, we propose a\nnew multi-factor authorization (MFAz) scheme that proactively mitigates\nunauthorized access attempts both conventional and advanced unauthorized access\nattacks. The proposed scheme employs fine-grained access control rules (ARs)\nand verification points (VPs) that are systematically generated from\nhistorically granted accesses as the first and second authorization factors,\nrespectively. As a proof-of-concept, we implement the scheme using different\ntechniques. We leverage bloom filter to achieve runtime and storage efficiency,\nand blockchain to make authorization decisions in a temper-proof and\ndecentralized manner. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first formal\nintroduction of a multi-factor authorization scheme, which is orthogonal to the\nmulti-factor authentication (MFA) schemes. The effectiveness of our proposed\nscheme is experimentally evaluated using a smart-city testbed involving\ndifferent devices with varying computational capacities.

    "abstract": "Following a stroke, individuals often experience mobility and balance\nimpairments due to lower-limb weakness and loss of independent joint control.\nGait recovery is a key goal of rehabilitation, traditionally achieved through\nhigh-intensity therapist-led training. However, manual assistance can be\nphysically demanding and limits the therapist's ability to interact with\nmultiple joints simultaneously. Robotic exoskeletons offer multi-joint support,\nreduce therapist strain, and provide objective feedback, but current control\nstrategies often limit therapist involvement and adaptability.\n  We present a novel gait rehabilitation paradigm based on physical\nHuman-Robot-Human Interaction (pHRHI), where both the therapist and the\npost-stroke individual wear lower-limb exoskeletons virtually connected at the\nhips and knees via spring-damper elements. This enables bidirectional\ninteraction, allowing the therapist to guide movement and receive haptic\nfeedback. In a study with eight chronic stroke patients, pHRHI training\noutperformed conventional therapist-guided treadmill walking, leading to\nincreased joint range of motion, step metrics, muscle activation, and\nmotivation. These results highlight pHRHI's potential to combine robotic\nprecision with therapist intuition for improved rehabilitation outcomes.",

Their\ntrajectories exhibit highly non-trivial statistical behavior, motivating the\ndevelopment of surrogate models that can reproduce these trajectories without\nincurring the high computational cost of direct numerical simulations of the\nfull Eulerian field. This task is particularly challenging because\nreduced-order models typically lack access to the full set of interactions with\nthe underlying turbulent field. Novel data-driven machine learning techniques\ncan be very powerful in capturing and reproducing complex statistics of the\nreduced-order/surrogate dynamics. In this work, we show how one can learn a\nsurrogate dynamical system that is able to evolve a turbulent Lagrangian\ntrajectory in a way that is point-wise accurate for short-time predictions\n(with respect to Kolmogorov time) and stable and statistically accurate at long\ntimes. This approach is based on the Mori--Zwanzig formalism, which prescribes\na mathematical decomposition of the full dynamical system into resolved\ndynamics that depend on the current state and the past history of a reduced set\nof observables and the unresolved orthogonal dynamics due to unresolved degrees\nof freedom of the initial state. We show how by training this reduced order\nmodel on a point-wise error metric on short time-prediction, we are able to\ncorrectly learn the dynamics of the Lagrangian turbulence, such that also the\nlong-time statistical behavior is stably recovered at test time. This opens up\na range of new applications, for example, for the control of active Lagrangian\nagents in turbulence.",

Our best fits also match the\n$\\epsilon^{54}$Cr and $\\epsilon^{50}$Ti values of Earth precisely, whereas the\nbest fits for chondrites, or components with a high proportion of E chondrules,\nfail to match Earth. In contrast to some previous studies, our best-fitting\ncomponent mixture is predominantly carbonaceous, rather than enstatite\nchondrules. It also includes 15 wt% of early-formed refractory inclusions (CAIs\n+ AOAs), which is similar to that found in some C chondrites (CO, CV, CK), but\nnotably higher than NC chondrites. High abundances of refractory materials are\nlacking in NC chondrites, because they formed after the majority of refractory\ngrains were either drawn into the Sun or incorporated into terrestrial\nprotoplanets via pebble accretion. We show that combinations of Stokes numbers\nof chondritic components build 0.35-0.7 Earth masses in 2 My in the Hill regime\naccretion, for a typical pebble column density of 1.2 kg/m2 at 1 au. However, a\nlarger or smaller column density leads to super-Earth or moon-mass bodies,\nrespectively. Our calculations also demonstrate that a few My of pebble\naccretion with these components yields a total protoplanet mass inside 1 au\nexceeding the combined masses of Earth, Moon, Venus, and Mercury.

In this work, we find\nthat existing feature-level attacks primarily manipulate the semantic\ninformation to derive the weight matrix. Inspired by several works that find\nCNNs tend to focus more on high-frequency components (a.k.a. abstract features,\ne.g., texture, edge, etc.), we validate that transforming images in the\nhigh-frequency space also improves transferability. Based on this finding, we\npropose a balanced approach called Semantic and Abstract FEatures disRuption\n(SAFER). Specifically, SAFER conducts BLOCKMIX on the input image and SELF-MIX\non the frequency spectrum when computing the weight matrix to highlight crucial\nfeatures. By using such a weight matrix, we can direct the attacker to disrupt\nboth semantic and abstract features, leading to improved transferability.\nExtensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset also demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method in boosting adversarial transferability.",

    "abstract": "Python type annotations bring the benefits of static type checking to the\nlanguage. However, manually writing annotations can be time-consuming and\ntedious. The result is that most real-world Python code remains largely\nuntyped. Past approaches to annotating types in Python code fall short in a\nnumber of ways. Static approaches struggle with dynamic features and infer\noverly broad types. AI-based methods are inherently unsound and can miss rare\nor user-defined types. Dynamic methods can impose extreme runtime overheads,\ndegrading performance by up to 270x, abort execution as they exhaust resources,\nand even infer incorrect types that lead to runtime errors. Crucially, all\nprior work assumes implicitly that the code to be annotated is already correct.\nThis assumption is generally unwarranted, especially for large codebases that\nhave been untyped.\n  This paper presents RightTyper, a novel approach for Python that overcomes\nthese disadvantages. RightTyper not only generates precise type annotations\nbased on actual program behavior, improving recall in type checking relative to\nprior approaches. It also turns type checking into anomaly detection, allowing\nthe type checker to identify corner cases that the programmer can audit for\nunintended behavior. RightTyper is also fast and space-efficient, imposing just\n30% performance overhead on average. RightTyper achieves these characteristics\nby a principled yet pervasive use of sampling--guided by self-profiling--along\nwith statistical filtering and careful resolution and aggregation of type\ninformation.",

Observations of these neutrinos can\nprovide unique insights into processes below the photosphere and offer clues to\nidentifying their emission mechanisms. We have searched for these neutrinos\nintensively with IceCube's existing infill array, DeepCore. Although no\nsignificant detections have been made, strong constraints on astrophysical\nenvironments in these transients, such as the baryon loading factor in\ngamma-ray bursts, have been obtained. A denser infill array, called the IceCube\nUpgrade, will enhance sub-TeV neutrino searches with its unprecedented\nsensitivity to GeV neutrinos. The Upgrade, set to be deployed in the 2025-2026\nSouth Pole season, will consist of seven new strings, adding approximately 700\nnovel optical modules with multiple photomultiplier tubes in the DeepCore\nvolume. The denser arrangement of high-efficiency modules will significantly\nimprove IceCube's sensitivity between 1 GeV and 1 TeV.

    "abstract": "Online content creators spend significant time and effort building their user\nbase through a long, often arduous process, which requires finding the right\n``niche'' to cater to. So, what incentive is there for an established content\ncreator known for cat memes to completely reinvent their page channel and start\npromoting cryptocurrency services or cover electoral news events? And, if they\ndo, do their existing subscribers not notice? We explore this problem of\n\\textit{repurposed channels}, whereby a channel changes its identity and\ncontents. We first characterize a market for ``second-hand'' social media\naccounts, which recorded sales exceeding USD~1M during our 6-month observation\nperiod. By observing YouTube channels (re)sold over these 6~months, we find\nthat a substantial number (37\\%) are used to disseminate potentially harmful\ncontent, often without facing any penalty. Even more surprisingly, these\nchannels seem to gain rather than lose subscribers. To estimate the prevalence\nof channel repurposing ``in the wild,'' we also collect two snapshots of 1.4M\nquasi-randomly sampled YouTube accounts. In a 3-month period, we estimate that\n$\\sim$0.25\\% channels -- collectively holding $\\sim$44M subscribers -- were\nrepurposed. We confirm that these repurposed channels share several\ncharacteristics with sold channels -- mainly, the fact that they had a\nsignificantly high presence of potentially problematic content. Across\nrepurposed channels, we find channels that became disinformation channels, as\nwell as channels that link to web pages with financial scams. We reason that\nabusing the residual trust placed on these channels is advantageous to\nfinancially- and ideologically-motivated adversaries. This phenomenon is not\nexclusive to YouTube and we posit that the market for cultivating organic\naudiences is set to grow, particularly if it remains unchallenged by\nmitigations, technical or otherwise.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are evolving from passive text generators into\nactive agents that invoke external tools. To support this shift, scalable\nprotocols for tool integration are essential. The Model Context Protocol (MCP),\nintroduced by Anthropic in 2024, offers a schema-driven standard for dynamic\ntool discovery and invocation. Yet, building MCP servers remains manual and\nrepetitive, requiring developers to write glue code, handle authentication, and\nconfigure schemas by hand-replicating much of the integration effort MCP aims\nto eliminate.\n  This paper investigates whether MCP server construction can be meaningfully\nautomated. We begin by analyzing adoption trends: among 22,000+ MCP-tagged\nGitHub repositories created within six months of release, fewer than 5% include\nservers, typically small, single-maintainer projects dominated by repetitive\nscaffolding. To address this gap, we present AutoMCP, a compiler that generates\nMCP servers from OpenAPI 2.0/3.0 specifications. AutoMCP parses REST API\ndefinitions and produces complete server implementations, including schema\nregistration and authentication handling.\n  We evaluate AutoMCP on 50 real-world APIs spanning 5,066 endpoints across\nover 10 domains. From a stratified sample of 1,023 tool calls, 76.5% succeeded\nout of the box. Manual failure analysis revealed five recurring issues, all\nattributable to inconsistencies or omissions in the OpenAPI contracts. After\nminor fixes, averaging 19 lines of spec changes per API, AutoMCP achieved 99.9%\nsuccess.\n  Our findings (i) analyze MCP adoption and quantify the cost of manual server\ndevelopment, (ii) demonstrate that OpenAPI specifications, despite quality\nissues, enable near-complete MCP server automation, and (iii) contribute a\ncorpus of 5,066 callable tools along with insights on repairing common\nspecification flaws.",

    "abstract": "The motion of dopants in magnetic spin lattices has received tremendous\nattention for at least four decades due to its connection to high-temperature\nsuperconductivity. Despite these efforts, we lack a complete understanding of\ntheir behavior, especially out-of-equilibrium and at nonzero temperatures. In\nthis Article, we take a significant step towards a much deeper understanding\nbased on state-of-the-art matrix-product-state calculations. In particular, we\ninvestigate the non-equilibrium dynamics of a dopant in two-leg $t$-$J$ ladders\nwith antiferromagnetic XXZ spin interactions. In the Ising limit, we find that\nthe dopant is localized for all investigated nonzero temperatures due to an\nemergent disordered potential, with a localization length controlled by the\nunderlying correlation length of the spin lattice, whereby it only delocalizes\nasymptotically in the zero temperature limit. This greatly generalizes the\nlocalization effect discovered recently in Hilbert space fragmented models. In\nthe presence of spin-exchange processes, the dopant delocalizes according to a\npower-law behavior, which is strongly sub-diffusive for weak spin-exchange but\nwhich eventually becomes diffusive for strong enough exchange. Moreover, we\nshow that the underlying spin dynamics at infinite temperature behaves\nqualitatively the same, albeit with important quantitative differences. We\nsubstantiate these findings by showing that the dynamics shows self-similar\nscaling behavior, which strongly deviates from the Gaussian behavior of regular\ndiffusion. Finally, we show that the diffusion coefficient follows an Arrhenius\nrelation at high temperatures, whereby it exponentially decreases for\ndecreasing temperatures.",

The framework was applied to classify triple-negative breast cancer\n(TNBC) versus non-TNBC using dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI from a\nmulti-institutional cohort of 1,549 patients. We trained 27 machine learning\nclassifiers with 27 feature selection methods.

Spelke objects thus operate on category-agnostic\ncausal motion relationships which potentially better support tasks like\nmanipulation and planning. In this paper, we first benchmark the Spelke object\nconcept, introducing the SpelkeBench dataset that contains a wide variety of\nwell-defined Spelke segments in natural images. Next, to extract Spelke\nsegments from images algorithmically, we build SpelkeNet, a class of visual\nworld models trained to predict distributions over future motions. SpelkeNet\nsupports estimation of two key concepts for Spelke object discovery: (1) the\nmotion affordance map, identifying regions likely to move under a poke, and (2)\nthe expected-displacement map, capturing how the rest of the scene will move.\nThese concepts are used for \"statistical counterfactual probing\", where diverse\n\"virtual pokes\" are applied on regions of high motion-affordance, and the\nresultant expected displacement maps are used define Spelke segments as\nstatistical aggregates of correlated motion statistics. We find that SpelkeNet\noutperforms supervised baselines like SegmentAnything (SAM) on SpelkeBench.\nFinally, we show that the Spelke concept is practically useful for downstream\napplications, yielding superior performance on the 3DEditBench benchmark for\nphysical object manipulation when used in a variety of off-the-shelf object\nmanipulation models.",

    "abstract": "Understanding what constitutes safety in AI-generated content is complex.\nWhile developers often rely on predefined taxonomies, real-world safety\njudgments also involve personal, social, and cultural perceptions of harm. This\npaper examines how annotators evaluate the safety of AI-generated images,\nfocusing on the qualitative reasoning behind their judgments. Analyzing 5,372\nopen-ended comments, we find that annotators consistently invoke moral,\nemotional, and contextual reasoning that extends beyond structured safety\ncategories. Many reflect on potential harm to others more than to themselves,\ngrounding their judgments in lived experience, collective risk, and\nsociocultural awareness. Beyond individual perceptions, we also find that the\nstructure of the task itself -- including annotation guidelines -- shapes how\nannotators interpret and express harm. Guidelines influence not only which\nimages are flagged, but also the moral judgment behind the justifications.\nAnnotators frequently cite factors such as image quality, visual distortion,\nand mismatches between prompt and output as contributing to perceived harm\ndimensions, which are often overlooked in standard evaluation frameworks. Our\nfindings reveal that existing safety pipelines miss critical forms of reasoning\nthat annotators bring to the task. We argue for evaluation designs that\nscaffold moral reflection, differentiate types of harm, and make space for\nsubjective, context-sensitive interpretations of AI-generated content.",

This paradigm, however, leaves a vast ocean\nof human problems -- those characterized by ambiguity, dynamic environments,\nand subjective context -- largely untouched. The advent of Large Language\nModels (LLMs) represents a fundamental shift, enabling computational systems to\nengage with this previously inaccessible domain using natural language. This\npaper introduces a unified framework to understand and contrast these\nproblem-solving paradigms. We define and delineate the problem spaces\naddressable by formal languages versus natural language. While solutions to the\nformer problem class can be evaluated using binary quality measures, the latter\nrequires a much more nuanced definition of approximate solution space taking\ninto account the vagueness, subjectivity and ambiguity inherent to natural\nlanguage. We therefore introduce a vector-valued trust index Q, which reflects\nsolution quality and distinguishes the binary correctness of formal solutions\nfrom the continuous adequacy spectrum characteristic of natural language\nsolutions. Within this framework, we propose two statistical quality\ndimensions. Normalized bi-semantic entropy measures robustness and conceptual\ndiversity of LLM answers given semantic variation in problem formulations.\nEmotional valence maps subjective valuation of a solution to a quantifiable\nmetric that can be maximized by invoking statistical measures.

Our study focuses on\nintrinsic localized modes (ILMs) -- solutions that exhibit spatial localization\nover a few lattice sites. The basic example for our study is the cubic-quartic\nequation that recently has been used to describe 3D BEC cloud in the mean field\napproximation with Lee-Huang-Yang corrections. We employ numerical continuation\nfrom the anti-continuum limit (ACL) where the coupling between the lattice\nsites is neglected (the case $\\alpha=0$).

We present tables of bifurcations for the ILMs that involve not more\nthan 3 excited lattice sites. It is shown that the model supports nonsymmetric\nILMs that have no counterparts in ACL. Also we study the branches of ILMs that\ncan be continued unlimitedly when $\\alpha\\to \\infty$ (called here\n$\\infty$-branches).

In\nthis work, we examine the phenomenon of massive tokens - tokens with\nexceptionally high activation norms that act as attention sinks - and artifact\ntokens that emerge as a byproduct during inference. Our analysis reveals that\nthese tokens mutually suppress one another through the attention mechanism,\nplaying a critical role in regulating information flow within the network.\nLeveraging these insights, we introduce Fast Nystr\\\"om Attention (FNA), a\ntraining-free method that approximates self-attention in linear time and space\nby exploiting the structured patterns formed by massive and artifact tokens.\nAdditionally, we propose a masking strategy to mitigate noise from these\ntokens, yielding modest performance gains at virtually no cost. We evaluate our\napproach on popular pretrained vision backbones and demonstrate competitive\nperformance on retrieval, classification, segmentation, and visual question\nanswering (VQA), all while reducing computational overhead.",

To overcome\nthe challenges posed by the lack of high-quality datasets for this task, we\nintroduce a new dataset specifically designed for person-to-person try-on\nscenarios.

An essential step in QA is minor\nembedding, which maps the problem graph onto the sparse topology of the quantum\nprocessor. This process is computationally expensive and scales poorly with\nincreasing problem size and hardware complexity. Existing heuristics are often\ndeveloped for specific problem graphs or hardware topologies and are difficult\nto generalize. Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising alternative by\ntreating minor embedding as a sequential decision-making problem, where an\nagent learns to construct minor embeddings by iteratively mapping the problem\nvariables to the hardware qubits. We propose a RL-based approach to minor\nembedding using a Proximal Policy Optimization agent, testing its ability to\nembed both fully connected and randomly generated problem graphs on two\nhardware topologies, Chimera and Zephyr. The results show that our agent\nconsistently produces valid minor embeddings, with reasonably efficient number\nof qubits, in particular on the more modern Zephyr topology.

In this work, we represent the synthesis of\nvariational quantum circuits as a sequential decision-making problem, where\ngates are added iteratively in order to optimize an objective function, and we\nintroduce two reinforcement learning-based methods, RLVQC Global and RLVQC\nBlock, tailored to combinatorial optimization problems. RLVQC Block creates\nansatzes that generalize the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA),\nby discovering a two-qubits block that is applied to all the interacting qubit\npairs. While RLVQC Global further generalizes the ansatz and adds gates\nunconstrained by the structure of the interacting qubits. Both methods adopt\nthe Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm and use empirical measurement\noutcomes as state observations to guide the agent. We evaluate the proposed\nmethods on a broad set of QUBO instances derived from classical graph-based\noptimization problems. Our results show that both RLVQC methods exhibit strong\nresults with RLVQC Block consistently outperforming QAOA and generally\nsurpassing RLVQC Global. While RLVQC Block produces circuits with depth\ncomparable to QAOA, the Global variant is instead able to find significantly\nshorter ones. These findings suggest that reinforcement learning methods can be\nan effective tool to discover new ansatz structures tailored for specific\nproblems and that the most effective circuit design strategy lies between rigid\npredefined architectures and completely unconstrained ones, offering a\nfavourable trade-off between structure and adaptability.",

Recently, Generative Recommenders framework was proposed to scale\nbeyond typical Deep Learning Recommendation Models (DLRMs). Reformulation of\nrecommendation as sequential transduction task led to improvement of scaling\nproperties in terms of compute. Nevertheless, the largest encoder configuration\nreported by the HSTU authors amounts only to ~176 million parameters, which is\nconsiderably smaller than the hundreds of billions or even trillions of\nparameters common in modern language models.\n  In this work, we present a recipe for training large transformer recommenders\nwith up to a billion parameters.

Evaluated on 20 real-world\nweb applications, including 15 CVE cases and 2 known benchmarks, BACFuzz\ndetects 16 of 17 known issues and uncovers 26 previously unknown BAC\nvulnerabilities with low false positive rates.

The dynamic evolution of the spectral parameters in a\nbroad energy range is also investigated during a simultaneously detected burst\nwith XMM-Newton and NuSTAR. The burst profiles exhibit a strong energy\ndependence, as observed with XMM-Newton, NICER, and NuSTAR. We investigated the\nreflection feature during these bursts using the disk reflection model. As\nobserved during the peak of the NICER bursts, the reflection model can\ncontribute 30 per cent of the overall emission. During the NICER bursts, a\ncorrelation is observed between the flux of the blackbody and the reflection\ncomponents. The measurements of the mass accretion rate indicate that the\nbursts may be powered by a mixed H/He fuel. Moreover, the broadband NICER and\nNuSTAR spectra are also used to probe the reflection signature in the\nburst-free persistent region using the relativistic reflection model. Based on\nthe variability of the count rate during the NuSTAR observation, we also\ninvestigate the evolution of spectral parameters during two different flux\nlevels of the NuSTAR observation. The inner disk radius (Rin) and the angle of\ninclination are found to be nearly 11 Rg and 50 degrees, respectively.

While QuaLiKiz provides relatively fast evaluations, this study\nspecifically targeted small datasets to serve as a proxy for more expensive\ncodes, such as CGYRO or GENE. The newly implemented algorithm uses the SNGP\narchitecture for the classification component of the problem and the BNN-NCP\narchitecture for the regression component, training models for all turbulent\nmodes (ITG, TEM, ETG) and all transport fluxes ($Q_e$, $Q_i$, $\\Gamma_e$,\n$\\Gamma_i$, and $\\Pi_i$) described by the general QuaLiKiz output. With 45\nactive learning iterations, moving from a small initial training set of\n$10^{2}$ to a final set of $10^{4}$, the resulting models reached a $F_1$\nclassification performance of ~0.8 and a $R^2$ regression performance of ~0.75\non an independent test set across all outputs.

However, existing methods suffer from spatial misalignment\nbetween LiDAR and camera features, which causes inaccurate depth supervision in\ncamera branch and erroneous fusion during cross-modal feature aggregation. The\nroot cause of this misalignment lies in projection errors, stemming from\ncalibration inaccuracies and rolling shutter effect. The key insight of this\nwork is that locations of these projection errors are not random but highly\npredictable, as they are concentrated at object-background boundaries which 2D\ndetectors can reliably identify. Based on this, our main motivation is to\nutilize 2D object priors to pre-align cross-modal features before fusion. To\naddress local misalignment, we propose Prior Guided Depth Calibration (PGDC),\nwhich leverages 2D priors to alleviate misalignment and preserve correct\ncross-modal feature pairs. To resolve global misalignment, we introduce\nDiscontinuity Aware Geometric Fusion (DAGF) to suppress residual noise from\nPGDC and explicitly enhance sharp depth transitions at object-background\nboundaries, yielding a structurally aware representation. To effectively\nutilize these aligned representations, we incorporate Structural Guidance Depth\nModulator (SGDM), using a gated attention mechanism to efficiently fuse aligned\ndepth and image features.

A deeper theoretical insight into the\nunderlying physics is necessary for understanding of observed experimental\nfindings and predicting emerging effects relying on this new configuration.\nHere we present a theoretical framework to describe tunneling driven by quantum\nlight, where the properties of such light are captured by a statistical\nensemble of classical fields via a hydrodynamic, also referred to as Bohmian,\nformulation. Generalizing the quasiclassical theory of non-adiabatic tunneling\ndriven by classical light, a single tunneling event is described by a bundle of\ntunneling solutions, each driven by a classical field corresponding to one\nrealization in the ensemble. Quantum statistics of light are thus imprinted on\nthe measured current. Fully quantum description of light via the Bohmian\ntrajectories of its field provides a perfect fit to the description of the\nelectron (under-) above-barrier dynamics in terms of (complex quasiclassical)\nreal classical trajectories, resulting in a consistent and elegant theoretical\napproach.

    "abstract": "This review discusses the causes, nature, importance and observational\nevidence of mass loss by red supergiants. It arrives at the perception that\nmass loss finds its origin in the gravity which makes the star a star in the\nfirst place, and is a mechanism for the star to equilibrate. This is\ncorroborated by a careful examination of various popular historical and recent\nempirical mass-loss rate prescriptions and theoretical works, and which\nprovides no evidence for an explicit dependence of red supergiant mass loss on\nmetallicity though dust-associated mass loss becomes less prevalent at lower\nmetallicity. It also identifies a common problem in methods that use tracers of\nmass loss, which do not correct for varying scaling factors (often because\nthere is no information available on which to base such correction) and as a\nresult tend to underestimate mass-loss rates at the lower end. Conversely,\ndense, extended chromospheres in themselves do not translate into high\nmass-loss rates, and the significance of stochastic mass loss can be\noverstated. On a population scale, on the other hand, binary interaction acts\nas a stochastic agent of mass loss of great import. In all, evidence is\noverwhelming that points at red supergiants at the lower mass end losing mass\nat insufficient rates to shed their mantles before core collapse, but massive\n(at birth) red supergiants to be prone to intense, dusty mass loss which sees\nthem become hotter stars before meeting their fate. This is consistent with the\nidentified progenitors of hydrogen-rich supernovae. Supernova evolution holds\ngreat promise to probe the mass loss but we caution against confusing\natmospheres with winds. Finally, promising avenues are looked into, which could\nforge step-change progress in what has been a long and arduous search for the\nholy grail of red supergiant mass loss. We may yet find it!",

First, a\nnovel large-scale path loss model with physical foundation and high accuracy is\nproposed for dynamic marine environments.

An enhanced two-ray model incorporating vessel rotational motion is\npropounded to simulate the SWIFT fading, showing good alignment with measured\ndata, particularly for modest antenna movements. Next, the small-scale fading\nis studied by leveraging a variety of models including the two-wave with\ndiffuse power (TWDP) and asymmetric Laplace distributions, with the latter\nperforming well in most cases, while TWDP better captures bimodal fading in\nrough seas. Furthermore, maritime channel sparsity is examined via the Gini\nindex and Rician $K$ factor, and temporal dispersion is characterized.

    "abstract": "The latest detection of GW231123, a binary black hole (BH) merger with\nexceptionally large masses and high spins for the incoming components, has been\nsuggested as a smoking gun for hierarchical formation. In this scenario, a\nfirst generation of BHs resulting from collapsing stars form in a dense\nenvironment. Here they can assemble dynamically and undergo subsequent mergers.\nWe discuss three challenges for the formation of a GW231123-like event inside a\nstar cluster: 1) The high masses of the incoming BHs appear to be in the\npredicted pair-instability mass gap and thus suggest that second-generation or\nhigher-order generation BHs are involved. 2) Very high spins ($\\chi_f \\gtrsim\n0.8$) are very unlikely for dynamically assembled BHs because of the isotropic\ndistribution of spin vectors. 3) Hierarchically formed BHs are susceptible to\nreceive large recoils, which could kick them out of their cluster. We simulate\nthis scenario and show that only a few percent of mergers recover remnants\nwithin GW231123's primary spin estimate $\\chi_1=0.9^{+0.10}_{-0.19}$ and are\nretained inside typical star clusters. A large fraction of very rapidly\nspinning second-generation BHs (including $\\chi_f>0.9$) can only form if the\nfirst-generation BHs merges with aligned spins. This is a natural outcome of\nmassive binary star evolution scenarios, such as a chemically homogeneous\nevolution. This scenario also predicts equal masses for the components,\nimplying that the resulting BHs tend to receive very low recoil kicks and would\ntherefore likely be retained inside a cluster. We conclude that GW231123-like\nevents, if formed in a star cluster, could require first-generation BHs with\nlarge aligned spins that evolved through stellar binary interaction, followed\nby the dynamical assembly for a subsequent merger. We discuss the implications\nfor the uncertain lower edge of the putative mass gap 60-130 $\\rm M_\\odot$.",

    "abstract": "Effective Field Theory (EFT) is a general framework to parametrize the\nlow-energy approximation to a UV model that is widely used in model-independent\nsearches for new physics. The use of EFTs at the LHC can suffer from a\n'validity' issue, since new physics amplitudes often grow with energy and the\nkinematic regions with the most sensitivity to new physics have the largest\ntheoretical uncertainties. We propose a method to account for these\nuncertainties with the aim of producing robust model-independent results with a\nwell-defined statistical interpretation. In this approach, one must specify the\nnew operators being studied as well as the new physics cutoff $M$, the energy\nscale where the EFT approximation breaks down. At energies below $M$, the EFT\nuncertainties are accounted for by adding additional higher dimensional\noperators with coefficients that are treated as nuisance parameters. The size\nof the nuisances are governed by a prior likelihood function that incorporates\ninformation about dimensional analysis, naturalness, and the scale $M$. At\nenergies above $M$, our method incorporates the lack of predictivity of the\nEFT, and we show that this is crucial to obtain consistent results. We perform\na number of tests of this method in a simple toy model, illustrating its\nperformance in analyses aimed at new physics exclusion as well as for\ndiscovery. The method is conveniently implemented by the technique of event\nreweighting and is easily ported to realistic LHC analyses. We find that the\nprocedure converges quickly with the number of nuisance parameters and is\nconservative when compared to UV models. The paper gives a precise meaning and\noffers a principled and practical solution to the widely debated 'EFT validity\nissue'.",

Several hypervelocity white dwarfs (HVWDs)\nwith space velocities of $\\gtrsim 1000\\,\\mathrm{kms}^{-1}$ have recently been\ndiscovered. One possible origin of these stars is the dynamically-driven\ndouble-degenerate double-detonation (D6) scenario, in which an accreting\nsub-Chandrasekhar mass carbon-oxygen (CO) WD detonates as a SN Ia. In this\nscenario, the less massive WD may survive its companion's detonation and be\nejected as a HVWD. Most of the observed HVWDs are hotter and puffier than\nnormal WDs, perhaps due to their recent proximity to a SN. In this work, we\ntest whether these properties can be explained by long-lived stable carbon (C)\nburning in the interiors of CO WD donors triggered by a SN shock. We model the\nlong-term evolution of CO WDs following rapid energy injection using 1D models.\nWe find that stable C burning can be ignited in CO WDs with masses of $0.95 -\n1.10\\,M_{\\odot}$ if SN energy penetrates sufficiently deeply. The resulting\nborn-again stars settle on the C-burning main sequence while they convert their\ninteriors from C and O to Ne and Mg, where they have temperatures and radii\nsimilar to some of the observed HVWDs. However, the timescale over which\nC-burning WDs remain inflated is $\\lesssim 10^5\\,$yr, which is at least an\norder of magnitude shorter than the kinematic ages of observed hot HVWDs. We\nconclude that observed HVWDs are unlikely to be inflated by C burning. The\nstellar evolution of observed HVWDs remains an open problem.",

Using the construction proposed by Kasday (1971) in a\ndifferent context, and adapted to collider scenarios by Abel, Dittmar, and\nDreiner (1992), it is straightforward to construct a local hidden variable\ntheory (LHVT) which exactly reproduces the data. This construction is only\npossible as the final state momenta all commute. This LHVT satisfies Bell's\ninequality and is by construction \\textit{not} entangled.

We\nestablish the rigor of this method by calculating nontrival next-to-leading\norder corrections in a $1/E_{\\rm max}$ expansion, where $E_{\\rm max}$ is our\neffective theory cutoff. We illustrate this explicitly using 1+1D $\\lambda\n\\phi^4$ theory, calculating corrections up to order $1/E_{\\rm max}^3$. At this\norder, novel nonlocal contributions to the matching conditions must be\nincorporated. We show that by including these nonlocal terms, the error scales\nas $1/E_{\\rm max}^4$, as expected from the Effective Field Theory power\ncounting, providing a nontrivial check that this method is consistent and\nrobust. We also estimate the critical coupling at which this theory flows to\nthe 2D Ising conformal field theory and confirm that separation of scales, an\nessential feature of Effective Field Theory, persists at this order. These\nresults establish Hamiltonian Truncation Effective Theory as a generic,\nsystematic framework for improving convergence in Hamiltonian truncation and\nlay the groundwork to apply this method to more complex systems in higher\ndimensions.",

While\nwino, quintuplet ($n=5$), and $n = 7$ DM models are strongly disfavored by our\nanalyses under the standard cosmology, we discuss how non-standard cosmological\nhistories or DM sub-fractions could still allow for these particles to be\nrealized in nature, with discovery opportunities at next-generation particle\ncolliders and gamma-ray telescopes.",

This limit is distinct from a nongravitational QFT because\nthe gravitational constraints still force states and observables to be de\nSitter invariant. We first examine a class of perturbative correlators that, in\ngauge-fixed form, are represented by the expectation value of a product of\nelementary fields on the late-time boundary. We formulate Feynman rules for our\ncomputations and enumerate some necessary, but not sufficient, conditions that\nmust be imposed on states and operators to avoid group-volume divergences.\nThese correlators are conformally invariant in all allowed perturbative states\nbut never coincide with QFT vacuum-expectation values. For instance, our sample\ncomputations yield interesting non-Gaussianities even when the underlying\nvacuum wavefunction is Gaussian. However, we show that, in the presence of a\nheavy background state, it is possible to construct a separate class of\nstate-dependent relational observables whose values approximate QFT correlators\nin the vacuum. This illustrates a key contrast in quantum gravity -- between\nobservables that are microscopically simple and observables whose expectation\nvalues in an appropriate background state lead to simple QFT-like correlators.",

In contrast, the separation distributions of systems in nearby\nstar-forming regions paints a much more confusing picture. There appears to be\nan excess of systems in the separation range 10 - 1000 au, and recent\nhigh-resolution spectroscopic observations of close (<10 au) systems suggest a\nfield-like distribution in some star-forming regions, but a possible excess\nwith respect to the field in other regions. Furthermore, the resolution limit\nof numerical simulations of binary star formation is $\\sim$1\\,au, and\nconsequently comparisons with the binary distributions in star-forming regions\nand in the field are restricted.

The simulations reproduce global thermodynamic profiles for\nclusters such as Perseus, Coma, A85, A119, A1644, A2029, A3158, and A3266.\nMoreover, they show that CC clusters typically assemble their mass earlier,\nwhile NCC systems grow through more extended, late-time merger-driven\nhistories. WCC clusters show intermediate behavior, suggesting an evolutionary\ntransition. Our results demonstrate that constrained simulations provide a\npowerful tool for linking cluster formation history to present-day ICM\nproperties and point to possible refinements in subgrid physics as well as in\nresolution that could improve the agreement in cluster core regions.",

Recently,\ndiffusion-based language models have emerged as a promising alternative, though\ntheir advantages over AR models remain underexplored. In this paper, we\nsystematically study masked diffusion models in data-constrained settings-where\ntraining involves repeated passes over limited data and find that they\nsignificantly outperform AR models when compute is abundant but data is scarce.\nDiffusion models make better use of repeated data, achieving lower validation\nloss and superior downstream performance. We find new scaling laws for\ndiffusion models and derive a closed-form expression for the critical compute\nthreshold at which diffusion begins to outperform AR. Finally, we explain why\ndiffusion models excel in this regime: their randomized masking objective\nimplicitly trains over a rich distribution of token orderings, acting as an\nimplicit data augmentation that AR's fixed left-to-right factorization lacks.\nOur results suggest that when data, not compute, is the bottleneck, diffusion\nmodels offer a compelling alternative to the standard AR paradigm.

We observe that\nmodern generative models share a conceptually similar training objective --\nreconstructing clean signals from corrupted inputs such as Gaussian noise or\nmasking -- a process we term denoising. Motivated by this insight, we propose\naligning tokenizer embeddings directly with the downstream denoising objective,\nencouraging latent embeddings to be more easily reconstructed even when heavily\ncorrupted. To achieve this, we introduce the Latent Denoising Tokenizer\n(l-DeTok), a simple yet effective tokenizer trained to reconstruct clean images\nfrom latent embeddings corrupted by interpolative noise and random masking.\nExtensive experiments on ImageNet 256x256 demonstrate that our tokenizer\nconsistently outperforms standard tokenizers across six representative\ngenerative models.

Despite notable\nadvances with recent efforts, current techniques still lag behind human\ncapabilities in handling drastic visual variations, occlusions, and complex\nscene changes. This limitation arises from their reliance on appearance\nmatching, neglecting the human-like conceptual understanding of objects that\nenables robust identification across temporal dynamics. Motivated by this gap,\nwe propose Segment Concept (SeC), a concept-driven segmentation framework that\nshifts from conventional feature matching to the progressive construction and\nutilization of high-level, object-centric representations. SeC employs Large\nVision-Language Models (LVLMs) to integrate visual cues across diverse frames,\nconstructing robust conceptual priors. During inference, SeC forms a\ncomprehensive semantic representation of the target based on processed frames,\nrealizing robust segmentation of follow-up frames. Furthermore, SeC adaptively\nbalances LVLM-based semantic reasoning with enhanced feature matching,\ndynamically adjusting computational efforts based on scene complexity. To\nrigorously assess VOS methods in scenarios demanding high-level conceptual\nreasoning and robust semantic understanding, we introduce the Semantic Complex\nScenarios Video Object Segmentation benchmark (SeCVOS). SeCVOS comprises 160\nmanually annotated multi-scenario videos designed to challenge models with\nsubstantial appearance variations and dynamic scene transformations. In\nparticular, SeC achieves an 11.8-point improvement over SAM 2.1 on SeCVOS,\nestablishing a new state-of-the-art in concept-aware video object segmentation.",

This study investigates this phenomenon by focusing on\ntemporal cognition in LLMs. Leveraging the similarity judgment task, we find\nthat larger models spontaneously establish a subjective temporal reference\npoint and adhere to the Weber-Fechner law, whereby the perceived distance\nlogarithmically compresses as years recede from this reference point. To\nuncover the mechanisms behind this behavior, we conducted multiple analyses\nacross neuronal, representational, and informational levels. We first identify\na set of temporal-preferential neurons and find that this group exhibits\nminimal activation at the subjective reference point and implements a\nlogarithmic coding scheme convergently found in biological systems. Probing\nrepresentations of years reveals a hierarchical construction process, where\nyears evolve from basic numerical values in shallow layers to abstract temporal\norientation in deep layers. Finally, using pre-trained embedding models, we\nfound that the training corpus itself possesses an inherent, non-linear\ntemporal structure, which provides the raw material for the model's internal\nconstruction. In discussion, we propose an experientialist perspective for\nunderstanding these findings, where the LLMs' cognition is viewed as a\nsubjective construction of the external world by its internal representational\nsystem. This nuanced perspective implies the potential emergence of alien\ncognitive frameworks that humans cannot intuitively predict, pointing toward a\ndirection for AI alignment that focuses on guiding internal constructions.

Early examples of\nquantum computational sensing (QCS) have largely focused on protocols where\nonly a single sensing operation appears before measurement -- with an exception\nbeing the recent application of Grover's algorithm to signal detection. In this\npaper we present, in theory and numerical simulations, the application of two\nquantum algorithms -- quantum signal processing and quantum neural networks --\nto various binary and multiclass machine-learning classification tasks in\nsensing. Here sensing operations are interleaved with computing operations,\ngiving rise to nonlinear functions of the sensed signals. We have evaluated\ntasks based on static and time-varying signals, including spatiotemporal\nsignals. Our approach to optimizing the circuit parameters in a QCS protocol\ntakes into account quantum sampling noise and allows us to engineer protocols\nthat can yield accurate results with as few as just a single measurement shot.\nIn all cases, we have been able to show a regime of operation where a quantum\ncomputational sensor can achieve higher accuracy than a conventional quantum\nsensor, with a simulated accuracy advantage of $>$20 percentage points for some\ntasks. We also present protocols for performing nonlinear tasks using\nHamiltonian-engineered bosonic systems and quantum signal processing with\nhybrid qubit-bosonic systems.

    "abstract": "Large reasoning models achieve remarkable performance through extensive\nchain-of-thought generation, yet they suffer from a critical inefficiency:\napplying uniformly extensive reasoning regardless of problem complexity. We\npresent Hierarchical Budget Policy Optimization (HBPO), a reinforcement\nlearning framework that enables models to learn problem-specific reasoning\ndepths without sacrificing capability. Unlike existing approaches that impose\nrigid constraints or rely on discrete mode selection, HBPO partitions the\nexploration space into budget-constrained hierarchies (512-2560 tokens), each\nwith differentiated reward structures that preserve both efficiency incentives\nand reasoning capabilities. This design addresses a fundamental challenge in\nefficient reasoning training: traditional length penalties systematically bias\nmodels away from necessary long reasoning paths, causing exploration space\ncollapse. Through hierarchical sampling and budget-aware rewards, HBPO\nmaintains exploration diversity while teaching models to recognize when\nextended deliberation is warranted. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HBPO\nreduces average token usage by up to 60.6% while improving accuracy by 3.14%\nacross four reasoning benchmarks. Most notably, HBPO exhibits emergent adaptive\nbehavior where models automatically adjust reasoning depth based on problem\ncomplexity. Our results suggest that reasoning efficiency and capability are\nnot inherently conflicting, and can be simultaneously optimized through\nappropriately structured hierarchical training that preserves exploration\ndiversity.",

We build on recent advances in foveated image\nprocessing and apply them to an Active Vision robot system that emulates both\nhuman head movement and eye tracking. Extending prior work on the AV-ALOHA\nrobot simulation platform, we introduce a framework for simultaneously\ncollecting eye-tracking data and robot demonstrations from a human operator as\nwell as a simulation benchmark and dataset for training robot policies that\nincorporate human gaze. Given the widespread use of Vision Transformers (ViTs)\nin robot learning, we integrate gaze information into ViTs using a foveated\npatch tokenization scheme inspired by recent work in image segmentation.\nCompared to uniform patch tokenization, this significantly reduces the number\nof tokens-and thus computation-without sacrificing visual fidelity near regions\nof interest. We also explore two approaches to gaze imitation and prediction\nfrom human data. The first is a two-stage model that predicts gaze to guide\nfoveation and action; the second integrates gaze into the action space,\nallowing the policy to jointly predict gaze and actions end-to-end. Our results\nshow that our method for foveated robot vision not only drastically reduces\ncomputational overhead, but also improves performance for high precision tasks\nand robustness to unseen distractors.

We first rescale and\nreformulate the discrete energy functional as an integral `semi-discrete'\nfunctional, where the Kirchhoff law transforms into a nonlocal elliptic\nintegral equation. Assuming that the sequence of graphs is uniformly connected\nand that the limiting graphon is 0-1 valued, we prove two results: (1) rigorous\nGamma-convergence of the sequence of the semi-discrete functionals to a\ncontinuum limit as the number of graph nodes and edges tends to infinity; (2)\nconvergence of global minimizers of the discrete functionals to a global\nminimizer of the limiting continuum functional.

In this paper, we present JAM (Just Ask for Music), a\nlightweight and intuitive framework for natural language music recommendation.\nJAM models user-query-item interactions as vector translations in a shared\nlatent space, inspired by knowledge graph embedding methods like TransE.

If programmers have access to LLMs, how do they actually use them to\ncomplement their own skills?\n  To answer these questions, we took advantage of the availability of a\nprogram-proving environment, which formally determines the correctness of\nproposed fixes, to conduct a study of program debugging with two randomly\nassigned groups of programmers, one with access to LLMs and the other without,\nboth validating their answers through the proof tools.

Artificial intelligence (AI), especially Deep Learning (DL), has a\nstrong tool for medical image analysis; however, pre-trained models like CNNs\nand XAI techniques for mpox detection is underexplored. Objective: This study\naims to evaluate the effectiveness of pre-trained CNN models (VGG16, VGG19,\nInceptionV3, MobileNetV2) for the early detection of monkeypox using binary and\nmulti-class datasets. It also seeks to enhance model interpretability using\nGrad-CAM an XAI technique. Method: Two datasets, MSLD and MSLD v2.0, were used\nfor training and validation. Transfer learning techniques were applied to\nfine-tune pre-trained CNN models by freezing initial layers and adding custom\nlayers for adapting the final features for mpox detection task and avoid\noverfitting. Models performance were evaluated using metrics such as accuracy,\nprecision, recall, F1-score and ROC. Grad-CAM was utilized for visualizing\ncritical features. Results: InceptionV3 demonstrated the best performance on\nthe binary dataset with an accuracy of 95%, while MobileNetV2 outperformed on\nthe multi-class dataset with an accuracy of 93%.

For the parameters of these models we\nalso provide the combination of Euclid forecasts (pessimistic and optimistic)\nwith current and future measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB)\nanisotropies., i.e. Planck, the Simons Observatory (SO), and CMB-S4. We provide\nFisher forecasts for how the power spectrum and bispectrum from the Euclid\nspectroscopic survey will constrain the local, equilateral, and orthogonal\nshapes of primordial non-Gaussianity. We also review how Bayesian field-level\ninference of primordial non-Gaussianity can constrain local primordial\nnon-Gaussianity. We show how Euclid, with its unique combination of the main\nprobes, will provide the tightest constraints on low redshift to date. By\ntargeting a markedly different range in redshift and scale, Euclid's expected\nuncertainties are complementary to those obtained by CMB primary anisotropy,\nreturning the tightest combined constraints on the physics of the early\nUniverse.",

We identify a second-order structural phase transition at 260\nK and 145 K for R = La and Ce, respectively. Single crystal X-ray diffraction\nreveals a lattice modulation below the transition temperature, resulting in\nR-Pb pairs in the z direction. The broken symmetry in the low-temperature\nphases results in a primitive structure with space group P4/ncc. Transport and\ndiffraction measurements, in agreement with density functional theory\ncalculations, support that the R$_5$Pb$_3$O (R = La and Ce) series hosts an\nelectron-phonon coupling driven charge density wave (CDW) at low temperatures.\nThe CDW ordering temperature is suppressed by more than 100 K by the La to Ce\nsubstitution, suggesting high pressure-sensitivity.

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is one of the popular distributed machine learning\n(ML) solutions but incurs significant communication and computation costs at\nedge devices. Federated split learning (FSL) can train sub-models in parallel\nand reduce the computational burden of edge devices by splitting the model\narchitecture. However, it still requires a high communication overhead due to\ntransmitting the smashed data and gradients between clients and the server in\nevery global round. Furthermore, the server must maintain separate partial\nmodels for every client, leading to a significant storage requirement. To\naddress these challenges, this paper proposes a novel communication and storage\nefficient federated split learning method, termed CSE-FSL, which utilizes an\nauxiliary network to locally update the weights of the clients while keeping a\nsingle model at the server, hence avoiding frequent transmissions of gradients\nfrom the server and greatly reducing the storage requirement of the server.\nAdditionally, a new model update method of transmitting the smashed data in\nselected epochs can reduce the amount of smashed data sent from the clients. We\nprovide a theoretical analysis of CSE-FSL, rigorously guaranteeing its\nconvergence under non-convex loss functions. The extensive experimental results\nfurther indicate that CSE-FSL achieves a significant communication reduction\nover existing FSL solutions using real-world FL tasks.",

    "abstract": "We consider the qubit-qutrit model of self-contained quantum refrigerator and\nobserve the quantum Mpemba effect in its cooling. In this system, the qutrit\nacts as the refrigerator while the qubit is to be cooled. The entire system is\ncoupled to three bosonic heat baths, due to which the dynamics of the system is\ngoverned by a Gorini-Kossakoswski-Sudarshan-Lindblad master equation. We\ninvestigate the Liouvillian that generates the dynamics of the system and find\nthat it has a block diagonal form. The dynamics of each element of the system's\ndensity matrix can be determined by solving the dynamical equation of the\ncorresponding block that contains it. We find that the steady state belongs to\nthe block containing only the diagonal elements in the energy basis. We\nnumerically solve for the steady state and investigate the steady-state cooling\nover a significant region of the parameter space. Moreover, we demonstrate the\nquantum Mpemba effect in the refrigerator: a Mpemba state obtained by applying\na unitary on the equilibrium state of the system reaches the steady state\nfaster than the equilibrium state, despite the Mpemba state being initially\nfarther away from the steady state. The Mpemba state thus leads to an\nacceleration in cooling of the cold qubit. We also find that both local and\nglobal unitaries on the qubit-qutrit system can generate the Mpemba state.\nFinally, we study the effect of the qubit-qutrit couplings and the system-bath\ncouplings on the Mpemba effect.",

    "abstract": "Recent developments in the study of pulsar radio emission revealed that the\nmicrophysics of quantum electrodynamic (QED) pair cascades at pulsar polar caps\nmay be responsible for generating the observed coherent radio waves. However,\nmodeling the pair cascades in the polar cap region poses significant\nchallenges, particularly under conditions of high plasma multiplicity.\nTraditional Particle-in-Cell (PIC) methods often face rapidly increasing\ncomputational costs as the multiplicity grows exponentially. To address this\nissue, we present a new simulation code using the Vlasov method, which\nefficiently simulates the evolution of charged particle distribution functions\nin phase space without a proportional increase in computational expense at high\nmultiplicities. We apply this code to study $e^\\pm$ pair cascades in 1D,\nincorporating key physical processes such as curvature radiation, radiative\ncooling, and magnetic pair production. We study both the Ruderman-Sutherland\n(RS) and the Space-charge-limited Flow (SCLF) regimes, and find quasiperiodic\ngap formation and pair production bursts in both cases. These features produce\nstrong electric field oscillations, potentially enabling coherent low-frequency\nradio emission. We construct a unified analytic model that describes the key\nfeatures of the polar cap cascade, which can be used to estimate the return\ncurrent heating rate that can be used to inform X-ray hotspot models. Spectral\nanalysis shows that a significant amount of energy is carried in superluminal\nmodes -- collective excitations that could connect to observed radio features.\nOur results align with previous PIC studies while offering enhanced fidelity in\nboth dense and rarefied regions.",

Semi-supervised\nsemantic segmentation (SSSS) has emerged as a solution to alleviate the\nlabeling burden by leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data through\nself-training techniques. Meanwhile, the advent of foundational segmentation\nmodels pre-trained on massive data, has shown the potential to generalize\nacross domains effectively. This work explores whether a foundational\nsegmentation model can address label scarcity in the pixel-level vision task as\nan annotator for unlabeled images. Specifically, we investigate the efficacy of\nusing SEEM, a Segment Anything Model (SAM) variant fine-tuned for textual\ninput, to generate predictive masks for unlabeled data. To address the\nshortcomings of using SEEM-generated masks as supervision, we propose\nConformalSAM, a novel SSSS framework which first calibrates the foundation\nmodel using the target domain's labeled data and then filters out unreliable\npixel labels of unlabeled data so that only high-confidence labels are used as\nsupervision. By leveraging conformal prediction (CP) to adapt foundation models\nto target data through uncertainty calibration, ConformalSAM exploits the\nstrong capability of the foundational segmentation model reliably which\nbenefits the early-stage learning, while a subsequent self-reliance training\nstrategy mitigates overfitting to SEEM-generated masks in the later training\nstage.

The\nalgorithm achieves certainty by recursively expanding the base oracle so that\nit marks all states prefixed by the same two bits as the target, encompassing\nexactly one-quarter of the search space. This enables a step-by-step reduction\nof the superposition until the target state can be measured with certainty. The\nalgorithm achieves deterministic success with a query complexity of\n$O(N^{\\log_2(3)/2}) \\approx O(N^{0.7925})$, falling between Grover's\n$O(\\sqrt{N})$ scaling and the classical $O(N)$.

Our\nchemo-dynamical analysis reveals four main populations within the metal-poor\ndisc: (1) a primordial disc older than 12 Gyr with [Fe/H] $>$ -1.5; (2) debris\nstars from the progenitor galaxy of Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE), but now\nresiding in the Galactic disc; (3) the metal-poor tail of the metal-rich,\nhigh-$\\alpha$ disc formed 10-12 Gyr ago, with metallicity lower limit extending\nto -2.0; (4) the metal-poor tail of the metal-rich, low-$\\alpha$ disc younger\nthan 8 Gyr, reaching a lower metallicity limit of -1.8. These results reveal\nthe presence of a primordial disc and show that both high-$\\alpha$ and\nlow-$\\alpha$ discs reach lower metallicities than previously thought.

Among these methods, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)\nis a notable approach based on the assumption that the adaptation inherently\noccurs in a low-dimensional subspace. While it has shown good performance, its\nimplementation requires a fixed and unalterable rank, which might be\nchallenging to select given the unique complexities and requirements of each\nmedical imaging downstream task. Inspired by advancements in natural image\nprocessing, we introduce a novel approach for medical image segmentation that\ndynamically adjusts the intrinsic rank during adaptation. Viewing the low-rank\nrepresentation of the trainable weight matrices as a singular value\ndecomposition, we introduce an l_1 sparsity regularizer to the loss function,\nand tackle it with a proximal optimizer. The regularizer could be viewed as a\npenalty on the decomposition rank. Hence, its minimization enables to find\ntask-adapted ranks automatically. Our method is evaluated in a realistic\nfew-shot fine-tuning setting, where we compare it first to the standard LoRA\nand then to several other PEFT methods across two distinguishable tasks: base\norgans and novel organs. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the significant\nperformance improvements driven by our method, highlighting its efficiency and\nrobustness against suboptimal rank initialization.

This\nhas raised the question of whether similar methods can instill more nuanced,\nhuman-like social intelligence, such as a Theory of Mind (ToM), in LLMs. This\npaper investigates whether small-scale LLMs can acquire a robust and\ngeneralizable ToM capability through RL with verifiable rewards (RLVR). We\nconduct a systematic evaluation by training models on various combinations of\nprominent ToM datasets (HiToM, ExploreToM, FANToM) and testing for\ngeneralization on held-out datasets (e.g., OpenToM). Our findings indicate that\nsmall LLMs struggle to develop a generic ToM capability. While performance on\nin-distribution tasks improves, this capability fails to transfer to unseen ToM\ntasks with different characteristics. Furthermore, we demonstrate that\nprolonged RL training leads to models ``hacking'' the statistical patterns of\nthe training datasets, resulting in significant performance gains on in-domain\ndata but no change, or degradation of performance on out-of-distribution tasks.\nThis suggests the learned behavior is a form of narrow overfitting rather than\nthe acquisition of a true, abstract ToM capability.",

    "abstract": "As Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) driven chatbots like\nCharacter.AI become embedded in adolescent life, they raise concerns about\nemotional dependence and digital overreliance. While studies have investigated\nthe overreliance of adults on these chatbots, they have not investigated teens'\ninteractions with chatbots with customizable personas. We analyzed 318 Reddit\nposts made by users self-reported as 13-17 years old on the Character.AI\nsubreddit to understand patterns of overreliance. We found teens commonly begin\nusing chatbots for emotional support or creative expression, but many develop\nstrong attachments that interfere with offline relationships and daily\nroutines. Their posts revealed recurring signs of psychological distress,\ncycles of relapse, and difficulty disengaging. Teens reported that their\noverreliance often ended when they reflect on the harm, return to in-person\nsocial settings, or become frustrated by platform restrictions. Based on the\nimplications of our findings, we provide recommendations for future chatbot\ndesign so they can promote self-awareness, support real-world engagement, and\ninvolve teens in developing safer digital tools.",

To push this\nboundary, we consider a generalized multi-object collection problem in large\nscene graphs, where the robot needs to pick up and place multiple objects\nacross multiple locations in a long mission of multiple human commands. This\nproblem is extremely challenging since it requires long-horizon planning in a\nvast action-state space under high uncertainties. To this end, we propose a\nnovel interleaved LLM and motion planning algorithm Inter-LLM. By designing a\nmultimodal action cost similarity function, our algorithm can both reflect the\nhistory and look into the future to optimize plans, striking a good balance of\nquality and efficiency. Simulation experiments demonstrate that compared with\nlatest works, our algorithm improves the overall mission performance by 30% in\nterms of fulfilling human commands, maximizing mission success rates, and\nminimizing mission costs.",

To solve this bottleneck, we will\ninvestigate how reservoir computing performs on natural text processing, which\ncould enable fast and energy efficient hardware implementations. Studies\ninvestigating the use of reservoir computing as a language model remain sparse.\nIn this paper, we compare three distinct approaches for character-level\nlanguage modeling, two different reservoir computing approaches, where only an\noutput layer is trainable, and the well-known transformer-based architectures,\nwhich fully learn an attention-based sequence representation. We explore the\nperformance, computational cost and prediction accuracy for both paradigms by\nequally varying the number of trainable parameters for all models.

    "abstract": "State-of-the-art logit distillation methods exhibit versatility, simplicity,\nand efficiency. Despite the advances, existing studies have yet to delve\nthoroughly into fine-grained relationships within logit knowledge. In this\npaper, we propose Local Dense Relational Logit Distillation (LDRLD), a novel\nmethod that captures inter-class relationships through recursively decoupling\nand recombining logit information, thereby providing more detailed and clearer\ninsights for student learning. To further optimize the performance, we\nintroduce an Adaptive Decay Weight (ADW) strategy, which can dynamically adjust\nthe weights for critical category pairs using Inverse Rank Weighting (IRW) and\nExponential Rank Decay (ERD). Specifically, IRW assigns weights inversely\nproportional to the rank differences between pairs, while ERD adaptively\ncontrols weight decay based on total ranking scores of category pairs.\nFurthermore, after the recursive decoupling, we distill the remaining\nnon-target knowledge to ensure knowledge completeness and enhance performance.\nUltimately, our method improves the student's performance by transferring\nfine-grained knowledge and emphasizing the most critical relationships.\nExtensive experiments on datasets such as CIFAR-100, ImageNet-1K, and\nTiny-ImageNet demonstrate that our method compares favorably with\nstate-of-the-art logit-based distillation approaches.

    "abstract": "Climate sensitivity has remained stubbornly uncertain since the Charney\nReport was published some 45 years ago. Two factors in future climate\nprojections could alter this dilemma: (i) an increased ratio of CO$_2$ forcing\nrelative to aerosol cooling, owing to both continued accumulation of CO$_2$ and\ndeclining aerosol emissions, and (ii) a warming world, whereby CO$_2$-induced\nwarming becomes more pronounced relative to climate variability. Here, we\ndevelop a novel modeling approach to explore the rates of learning about\nequilibrium climate sensitivity and the transient climate response (TCR) and\nidentify the physical drivers underpinning these learning rates. Our approach\nhas the advantage over past work by accounting for the full spectrum of\nparameter uncertainties and covariances, while also taking into account\nserially correlated internal climate variability. Moreover, we provide a\nphysical explanation of how quickly we may hope to learn about climate\nsensitivity. We find that, although we are able to constrain future TCR\nregardless of the true underlying value, constraining ECS is more difficult,\nwith low values of ECS being more easily ascertained than high values. This\nasymmetry can be explained by most of the warming this century being\nattributable to the fast climate mode, which is more useful for constraining\nTCR than it is for ECS. We further show that our inability to constrain the\ndeep ocean response is what limits our ability to learn high values of ECS.",

Despite its approximate nature, the BS equation provides\nremarkably accurate predictions for the mass spectrum of stable mesons across a\nwide range of parameters. Motivated by the striking structural similarity\nbetween the BS equation in IFT and the 't Hooft equation in two-dimensional\nQCD, we develop a new non-perturbative analytical framework inspired by the\nmethod of Fateev, Lukyanov, and Zamolodchikov (FLZ). Within this approach, we\ncompute spectral sums and systematically derive the large-$n$ WKB expansion for\nthe Bethe-Salpeter equation, which governs the spectrum of an infinite tower of\nmesons. We further examine how our analytical results capture the known\nbehavior of the spectrum in well-studied asymptotic regimes, such as the $E_8$\nlimit and the free-fermion point, where exact solutions are available for\ncomparison.

These pulsars require models\nspecifically tailored to account for their unique accretion physics, distinct\nfrom those used for Galactic black hole binaries. The X-ray spectra of all\nGalactic accreting X-ray pulsars (including sources in the Magellanic Clouds)\nare dominated by a high energy cut-off power-law and some of the sources show a\nsoft excess, some emission lines, cyclotron absorption features, etc. In this\nwork, we undertake a comprehensive analysis of the broadband X-ray spectra of\nfive ULX pulsars using simultaneous XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations and show\nthat their X-ray spectra can be effectively described by spectral models,\nsimilar to those used for the local accretion-powered X-ray pulsars.

The star has a radius of $R_*$=0.569$\\pm$0.020$R_{\\odot}$ and\na mass of $M_{\\star}$ = 0.577 $\\pm$ 0.024 $M_{\\odot}$. We constrained the\nplanetary mass using spectroscopic data from CARMENES, an instrument that has\nalready played a major role in confirming the planetary nature of the transit\nsignal detected by TESS. We used Gaussian Processes (GP) to improve the\nanalysis because the host star has a relatively strong activity that affects\nthe radial velocity dataset. In addition, we applied a GP to the TESS light\ncurves to reduce the correlated noise in the detrended dataset. The stellar\nactivity indicators show a strong signal that is related to the stellar\nrotation period of $\\sim$ 32 days. This stellar activity signal was also\nconfirmed on the TESS light curves. Ross 176b is an inner hot transiting planet\nwith a low-eccentricity orbit of $e = 0.25 \\pm 0.04$, an orbital period of $P\n\\sim 5$ days, and an equilibrium temperature of $T_{eq}\\sim 682K$.

Moreover, Ross 176b is a promising\ntarget for atmospheric characterization, which might lead to more information\non the existence, formation and composition of water worlds. This detection\nincreases the sample of planets orbiting K-type stars. This sample is valuable\nfor investigating the valley of planets with small radii around this type of\nstar.

These transfer functions, when convolved with the SGWB power spectrum\nand spatial correlation (Hellings \\& Downs curve), describe the variances and\ncorrelations of the pulsar timing residuals' Fourier coefficients. The\nconvolutions are the exact frequency- and Fourier-domain representations of the\ntime-domain covariance function.

Additionally, radial velocity and astrometric\ndata also point to a stellar companion. Here we present diffraction-limited\noptical speckle imaging observations obtained on the 8.1-meter Gemini North\ntelescope in 2020 and 2024. The 2020 observations were taken during the Great\nDimming event, and at a time when the stellar companion was predicted to be\nunobservable because it was directly in-line with Betelgeuse itself. The 2024\nobservations were taken three days after the predicted time of greatest\nelongation for the companion. A comparison of the 2020 and 2024 data reveal no\ncompanion in 2020 (as expected) and the probable detection of a companion in\n2024. The presumed stellar companion has an angular separation and position\nangle of 52 mas and $115^\\circ$ east of north, respectively, which is in\nexcellent agreement with predictions from dynamical considerations. The\ndetected companion is roughly six magnitudes fainter than Betelgeuse at 466\nnm.\\bf{While this is only a 1.5$\\sigma$ detection, the results are in\nreasonable agreement with the predictions: the appearance of the companion at\nquadrature; the angular separation from Betelgeuse; the position angle with\nrespect to Betelgeuse; the magnitude difference; and the estimated mass of the\ncompanion.",

The central body is modeled as a\nhomogeneous triaxial ellipsoid, rotating about its shortest physical axis at a\nconstant angular velocity. It is assumed that the massless ring particle moves\nwithin the equatorial plane of the ellipsoid. The dynamics of the particle is\nstudied using epicyclic variables, that lead to a straightforward definition of\ncorotation and Lindblad resonances. These resonances are associated to a\nHamiltonian function with two degrees of freedom, for which we compute\nappropriate expansions for the normal form and the resonant Hamiltonian.\nInitially, the normal form is verified to be non--degenerate, thereby\nguaranteeing the existence of invariant KAM tori, providing the stability of\nthe resonances, through their confinement in phase space. Subsequently, two\nexemplary test cases are examined: a nearly spherical ellipsoid and a highly\naspherical ellipsoid. Furthermore, this study concentrates on three principal\nresonances: corotation, 1:2, and 1:3, for which we present results concerning\ntheir dynamical behavior obtained analyzing the Hamiltonian formulation of the\nmodel and the resonant normal form.

    "abstract": "Recent work has demonstrated the promise of conversational AI systems for\ndiagnostic dialogue. However, real-world assurance of patient safety means that\nproviding individual diagnoses and treatment plans is considered a regulated\nactivity by licensed professionals. Furthermore, physicians commonly oversee\nother team members in such activities, including nurse practitioners (NPs) or\nphysician assistants/associates (PAs). Inspired by this, we propose a framework\nfor effective, asynchronous oversight of the Articulate Medical Intelligence\nExplorer (AMIE) AI system. We propose guardrailed-AMIE (g-AMIE), a multi-agent\nsystem that performs history taking within guardrails, abstaining from\nindividualized medical advice. Afterwards, g-AMIE conveys assessments to an\noverseeing primary care physician (PCP) in a clinician cockpit interface. The\nPCP provides oversight and retains accountability of the clinical decision.\nThis effectively decouples oversight from intake and can thus happen\nasynchronously. In a randomized, blinded virtual Objective Structured Clinical\nExamination (OSCE) of text consultations with asynchronous oversight, we\ncompared g-AMIE to NPs/PAs or a group of PCPs under the same guardrails.

Conceived as a simple heuristic quantifying the extent to which a\ngiven term's occurrences are concentrated in any one given document out of\nmany, TF-IDF and its many variants are routinely used as term-weighting schemes\nin diverse text analysis applications. There is a growing body of scholarship\ndedicated to placing TF-IDF on a sound theoretical foundation. Building on that\ntradition, this paper justifies the use of TF-IDF to the statistics community\nby demonstrating how the famed expression can be understood from a significance\ntesting perspective. We show that the common TF-IDF variant TF-ICF is, under\nmild regularity conditions, closely related to the negative logarithm of the\n$p$-value from a one-tailed version of Fisher's exact test of statistical\nsignificance. As a corollary, we establish a connection between TF-IDF and the\nsaid negative log-transformed $p$-value under certain idealized assumptions. We\nfurther demonstrate, as a limiting case, that this same quantity converges to\nTF-IDF in the limit of an infinitely large document collection. The Fisher's\nexact test justification of TF-IDF equips the working statistician with a ready\nexplanation of the term-weighting scheme's long-established effectiveness.",

Furthermore, using a recent mapping by Barthe et al.\n(Phys. Rev.

Taking energy constraints into account,\nwe determine the maximal position-momentum correlations achievable at fixed\nenergy, revealing structural insights about the corresponding optimal states.\nFinally, we illustrate the operational relevance of symplectic coherence\nthrough several examples in quantum information tasks and quantum\nthermodynamics.

Causality plays a crucial role in decision-making as it\npredicts the change in an outcome (usually a key performance indicator) due to\na treatment (also called an intervention). To facilitate robust decision making\nusing causality, this paper proposes three Bayesian approaches of the popular\nTargeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE) algorithm, a flexible\nsemi-parametric double robust estimator, for a probabilistic quantification of\nuncertainty in causal effects with binary treatment, and binary and continuous\noutcomes. In the first two approaches, the three TMLE models (outcome,\ntreatment, and fluctuation) are trained sequentially. Since Bayesian\nimplementation of treatment and outcome yields probabilistic predictions, the\nfirst approach uses mean predictions, while the second approach uses both the\nmean and standard deviation of predictions for training the fluctuation model\n(targeting step). The third approach trains all three models simultaneously\nthrough a Bayesian network (called BN-TMLE in this paper). The proposed\napproaches were demonstrated for two examples with binary and continuous\noutcomes and validated against classical implementations. This paper also\ninvestigated the effect of data sizes and model misspecifications on causal\neffect estimation using the BN-TMLE approach. Results showed that the proposed\nBN-TMLE outperformed classical implementations in small data regimes and\nperformed similarly in large data regimes.",

To address this gap, we introduce IDRBench -- a pioneering\nbenchmark featuring an expert annotated dataset and a suite of tasks tailored\nto evaluate LLMs' capabilities in proposing valuable research ideas from\ndifferent scientific domains for interdisciplinary research. This benchmark\naims to provide a systematic framework for assessing LLM performance in\ncomplex, cross-domain scientific research.

Our analysis reveals that the formation of the IQC is driven\nby the emergence of distinct local clusters that serve as precursors to the\nfully developed quasicrystalline phase. Additionally, we examine the dynamics\nof the system across a range of temperatures, identifying transitions from\nvibrationally restricted motion to activated diffusion, and uncovering\nsignatures of dynamic heterogeneity inherent to the quasicrystalline state. To\ndirectly connect structure and dynamics, we use a machine-learning-based order\nparameter to quantify the presence of distinct local environments across\ntemperatures. We find that regions with high structural order, as captured by\nspecific machine-learned classes, correlate with suppressed self-diffusion and\nminimal dynamical heterogeneity, consistent with phason-like motion within the\nIQC. In contrast, regions with lower structural order exhibit enhanced\ncollective motion and increased dynamical heterogeneity.

On the other hand, bi-directional, multi-modal, and context-aware\nsupport of the user in collaborative tasks still remains an open challenge. In\nthis paper, we present a gaze- and speech-informed interface to the assistive\nrobot, which is able to perceive the working environment from multiple vision\ninputs and support the dynamic user in their tasks. Our system is designed to\nbe modular and transferable to adapt to diverse tasks and robots, and it is\ncapable of real-time use of language-based interaction state representation and\nfast on board perception modules. Its development was supported by multiple\npublic dissemination events, contributing important considerations for improved\nrobustness and user experience. Furthermore, in two lab studies, we compare the\nperformance and user ratings of our system with those of a traditional scripted\nHRI pipeline. Our findings indicate that an LLM-based approach enhances\nadaptability and marginally improves user engagement and task execution metrics\nbut may produce redundant output, while a scripted pipeline is well suited for\nmore straightforward tasks.",

    "abstract": "Generating consistent long videos is a complex challenge: while\ndiffusion-based generative models generate visually impressive short clips,\nextending them to longer durations often leads to memory bottlenecks and\nlong-term inconsistency. In this paper, we propose TokensGen, a novel two-stage\nframework that leverages condensed tokens to address these issues. Our method\ndecomposes long video generation into three core tasks: (1) inner-clip semantic\ncontrol, (2) long-term consistency control, and (3) inter-clip smooth\ntransition. First, we train To2V (Token-to-Video), a short video diffusion\nmodel guided by text and video tokens, with a Video Tokenizer that condenses\nshort clips into semantically rich tokens. Second, we introduce T2To\n(Text-to-Token), a video token diffusion transformer that generates all tokens\nat once, ensuring global consistency across clips. Finally, during inference,\nan adaptive FIFO-Diffusion strategy seamlessly connects adjacent clips,\nreducing boundary artifacts and enhancing smooth transitions. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances long-term temporal\nand content coherence without incurring prohibitive computational overhead. By\nleveraging condensed tokens and pre-trained short video models, our method\nprovides a scalable, modular solution for long video generation, opening new\npossibilities for storytelling, cinematic production, and immersive\nsimulations.

In our model, each agent can either rent at a\nfixed daily cost, or purchase a pass at an individual cost, with an additional\nthird option of a discounted group pass available to all. We consider scenarios\nin which agents' active days differ, leading to dynamic states as agents drop\nout of the decision process. To address this problem from different\nperspectives, we define three distinct competitive ratios: overall,\nstate-dependent, and individual rational. For each objective, we design and\nanalyze optimal deterministic and randomized policies. Our deterministic\npolicies employ state-aware threshold functions that adapt to the dynamic\nstates, while our randomized policies sample and resample thresholds from\ntailored state-aware distributions. The analysis reveals that symmetric\npolicies, in which all agents use the same threshold, outperform asymmetric\nones.

We perform controlled experiments on\nImageNet across diffusion-based/flow-based and autoregressive (AR) models.\nFirst, we establish control token prefilling as a simple, general and\nperformant baseline approach for transformers. We then investigate previously\nunderexplored sampling time enhancements, showing that extending\nclassifier-free guidance to control, as well as softmax truncation, have a\nstrong impact on control-generation consistency.

Motivated by this, we develop a\nfully relativistic framework for inspirals under the gravitational influence of\nmatter environments. Our approach employs a two-parameter perturbation\nexpansion in the mass ratio and an environmental parameter. This yields a\nmodified Teukolsky equation capturing the leading cross-order. We then\nimplement a simple pole-dipole approximation of an axisymmetric environment\nthrough a thin matter shell and restrict to non-rotating black holes. As a\nresult, we obtain a piecewise type D spacetime. This enables the use of\nTeukolsky-based methods while accounting for junction physics. The presence of\nthe matter shell leads to effectively non-separable boundary conditions for the\nTeukolsky scalar and introduces mode mixing between adjacent multipoles.\nAdditionally, the shell oscillates under the wave perturbation of the inspiral,\ncontributing to the overall flux.

    "abstract": "Following the 2024 U.S. presidential election, Democratic lawmakers and their\nsupporters increasingly migrated from mainstream social media plat-forms like X\n(formerly Twitter) to decentralized alternatives such as Bluesky. This study\ninvestigates how Congressional Democrats use Bluesky to form networks of\ninfluence and disseminate political messaging in a platform environment that\nlacks algorithmic amplification. We employ a mixed-methods approach that\ncombines social network analysis, expo-nential random graph modeling (ERGM),\nand transformer-based topic mod-eling (BERTopic) to analyze follows, mentions,\nreposts, and discourse pat-terns among 182 verified Democratic members of\nCongress. Our findings show that while party leaders such as Hakeem Jeffries\nand Elizabeth War-ren dominate visibility metrics, overlooked figures like\nMarcy Kaptur, Donald Beyer, and Dwight Evans occupy structurally central\npositions, suggesting latent influence within the digital party ecosystem. ERGM\nre-sults reveal significant homophily along ideological, state, and leadership\nlines, with Senate leadership exhibiting lower connectivity. Topic analysis\nidentifies both shared themes (e.g., reproductive rights, foreign conflicts)\nand subgroup-specific issues, with The Squad showing the most distinct\ndiscourse profile. These results demonstrate the potential of decentralized\nplatforms to reshape intra-party communication dynamics and highlight the need\nfor continued computational research on elite political behavior in emerging\ndigital environments.",

Although FIQA has been extensively studied and achieved\nsignificant progress, the computational complexity of FIQA algorithms remains a\nkey concern for ensuring scalability and practical deployment in real-world\nsystems. In this paper, we aim to develop a computationally efficient FIQA\nmethod that can be easily deployed in real-world applications. Specifically,\nour method consists of two stages: training a powerful teacher model and\ndistilling a lightweight student model from it. To build a strong teacher\nmodel, we adopt a self-training strategy to improve its capacity. We first\ntrain the teacher model using labeled face images, then use it to generate\npseudo-labels for a set of unlabeled images. These pseudo-labeled samples are\nused in two ways: (1) to distill knowledge into the student model, and (2) to\ncombine with the original labeled images to further enhance the teacher model\nthrough self-training. The enhanced teacher model is used to further\npseudo-label another set of unlabeled images for distilling the student models.\nThe student model is trained using a combination of labeled images,\npseudo-labeled images from the original teacher model, and pseudo-labeled\nimages from the enhanced teacher model. Experimental results demonstrate that\nour student model achieves comparable performance to the teacher model with an\nextremely low computational overhead.

The\nBlahut-Arimoto (BA) algorithm, as a classical algorithm to compute RD\nfunctions, encounters computational challenges when applied to high-dimensional\nscenarios. In recent years, many neural methods have attempted to compute\nhigh-dimensional RD problems from the perspective of implicit generative\nmodels. Nevertheless, these approaches often neglect the reconstruction of the\noptimal conditional distribution or rely on unreasonable prior assumptions. In\nface of these issues, we propose an innovative energy-based modeling framework\nthat leverages the connection between the RD dual form and the free energy in\nstatistical physics, achieving effective reconstruction of the optimal\nconditional distribution.The proposed algorithm requires training only a single\nneural network and circumvents the challenge of computing the normalization\nfactor in energy-based models using the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\nsampling. Experimental results demonstrate the significant effectiveness of the\nproposed algorithm in estimating high-dimensional RD functions and\nreconstructing the optimal conditional distribution.",

In this work, we study a\nserendipitously discovered large overdensity of HI galaxies at z~0.04.

MeerKAT data enables us to\nderive HI masses and investigate interacting galaxies. We use DES and\nWide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) data to quantify the star formation\nrates, stellar masses, and stellar morphologies of member galaxies and compare\nthese with field scaling relations. To place this discovery and the\nenvironmental effects in context, we use the SIMBA simulation to investigate\nthe prevalence of qualitatively similar HI overdensities and their large-scale\nmorphological properties.

The win ratio can provide\ngreater power than TTFE analysis, especially when the effect on the\nhighest-ranked outcome is substantial, reaching increases in power up to 50\\%.\nFurther, even for moderate treatment effects on the highest-ranked outcome, win\nratio analysis achieved higher power.\n  Future work should expand our simulations to additional data-generating\nmechanisms and outcome types, particularly ordinal outcomes, where the win\nratio provides an alternative to existing non-parametric and parametric\nmethods.\n  Our findings highlight the potential of the win ratio to improve statistical\nefficiency in pharmaceutical and other clinical trial designs using composite\nendpoints, particularly when no single component dominates the treatment\neffect. However, when continuous outcomes occupy the top of the hierarchy,\nthese tend to drive overall analysis, sidelining contributions of lower-ranked\noutcomes and limiting benefits of hierarchical win ratio analysis.",

These challenges are\nparticularly pronounced in remote sensing scenarios due to large-scale scenes,\nhigh altitude variations, and domain gaps of existing visual priors.

To handle large-scale remote sensing scenarios, we incorporate\npartitioned Gaussian training, GPU-accelerated parallel matching, and dynamic\nmemory management strategies. Our approach consists of two stages: (1) a sparse\nstage featuring a Gaussian-specific consistent render-aware sampling strategy\nand landmark-guided detector for robust and accurate initial pose estimation,\nand (2) a dense stage that iteratively refines poses through coarse-to-fine\ndense rasterization matching while incorporating reliability verification.\nThrough comprehensive evaluation on simulation data, public datasets, and real\nflight experiments, we demonstrate that our method delivers competitive\nlocalization accuracy, recall rate, and computational efficiency while\neffectively filtering unreliable pose estimates.

However, deploying\nand maintaining a vast network of EC nodes is costly, which can explain its\nlimited deployment today. A new paradigm called Vehicular Cloud Computing (VCC)\nhas emerged and inspired interest among researchers and industry. VCC\nopportunistically utilizes existing and idle vehicular computational resources\nfor external task offloading. This work is the first to systematically address\nthe following question: Can VCC replace EC for low-latency applications?\nAnswering this question is highly relevant for Network Operators (NOs), as VCC\ncould eliminate costs associated with EC given that it requires no\ninfrastructural investment. Despite its potential, no systematic study has yet\nexplored the conditions under which VCC can effectively support low-latency\napplications without relying on EC. This work aims to fill that gap. Extensive\nsimulations allow for assessing the crucial scenario factors that determine\nwhen this EC-to-VCC substitution is feasible. Considered factors are load,\nvehicles mobility and density, and availability. Potential for substitution is\nassessed based on multiple criteria, such as latency, task completion success,\nand cost. Vehicle mobility is simulated in SUMO, and communication in NS3\n5G-LENA.

In this paper, we introduce a hybrid\nsystem specifically designed to address this issue. The method involves\ntraining an artificial intelligent system to predict the dynamics of a measured\nsystem by combining a neural network with a simulated system. By training the\nneural network, it becomes possible to refine the model's predictions so that\nthe simulated dynamics synchronize with the actual system dynamics.\n  After a brief contextualization of the problem, we introduce the hybrid\napproach employed, describing the learning technique and testing the results on\ntwo chaotic systems inspired by atmospheric dynamics in measurement contexts.\nAlthough these systems are low-dimensional, they encompass all the fundamental\ncharacteristics and predictability challenges that can be observed in more\ncomplex real-world systems.",

    "abstract": "Electronic systems with quadratic band touchings, commonly found in two- and\nthree-dimensional materials such as Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene, kagome\nmetals, HgTe, and pyrochlore iridates, have attracted significant interest\nconcerning the role of interactions in shaping their electronic properties.\nHowever, even in the simplest model of spinless fermions on a two-dimensional\ncheckerboard lattice, the quantum phase diagram as a function of\nnearest-neighbor interaction remains under debate. We employ constrained-path\nquantum Monte Carlo simulations (CP-QMC) simulations to investigate the problem\nusing a two-dimensional torus geometry. We cross-validate our results on small\nlattices by comparing them with density-matrix renormalization group\ncalculations, finding quantitative agreement. In particular, we implement an\nimproved optimization scheme within the CP-QMC simulations, enabling the\nidentification of a bond-nematic Dirac semimetal phase that was found in\ntensor-network studies on cylindrical geometries, but remains inaccessible to\nHartree-Fock mean-field methods. The CP-QMC approach makes it possible to\nestablish the emergence of this phase in a geometry that preserves lattice\nrotational symmetry and permits extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit. Our\nresults show that the quantum phase diagram of spinless fermions on the\ncheckerboard lattice with nearest-neighbor repulsion features three\ninteraction-induced phases at half filling: a quantum anomalous Hall insulator\nat weak coupling, a bond-nematic Dirac semimetal at intermediate coupling, and\na site-nematic insulator at strong coupling.",

Bang-Jensen, Wang and Yeo (arXiv\n2024) showed that deciding the presence of a quasi-Hamiltonian cycle which does\nnot contain at least one vertex from each color class is NP-complete.\nSimilarly, deciding the presence of a quasi-Hamiltonian cycle which intersects\nevery part exactly once is also NP-complete as shown in the same work.\n  In this paper, we continue the study of paths with constraints on the number\nof covered vertices from each color class. We consider the problem of finding a\npath with prescribed start and end vertex that contains at least $a$ and at\nmost $b$ vertices from each color class where all color classes have size\nexactly $\\alpha$. This unifies the Hamiltonian path problem, the\nquasi-Hamiltonian path problem and the path-version of the cycle problems\nmentioned above, among other problems. Using Schaefer's dichotomy theorem, we\nclassify the complexity of almost all problems in our framework. Notable open\nproblems are the Hamiltonian path problem on semicomplete multipartite digraphs\nas well as the quasi-Hamiltonian path problem restricted to semicomplete\nmultipartite digraphs with independence number 2.\n  We then investigate the quasi-Hamiltonian path problem restricted to\nsemicomplete multipartite digraphs with independence number 2. We generalize\nsufficient criteria for Hamiltonian $(s,t)$-paths in semicomplete digraphs to\nsufficient criteria for quasi-Hamiltonian $(s,t)$-paths in this class. Although\nthis does not settle the problem, the initial results suggest that this special\ncase may be solvable in polynomial time.",

Modelling the battery discharge of a satellite will enable the\nprediction of the consequences of disconnecting the autonomous power system and\nensure the fault tolerance of equipment in orbit. Therefore, the selected study\nis relevant and promising. This study focuses on the analysis of CubeSat\nsatellite data, based explicitly on orbital data samples of the power system,\nwhich include data available at the time of the article publication. The\ndataset contains data on the voltage, current, and temperature of the battery\nand solar panels attached to the five sides of the satellite. In this context,\ntwo approaches are considered: analytical modelling based on physical laws and\nmachine learning, which uses empirical data to create a predictive model.\nResults: A comparative analysis of the modeling results reveals that the\nequivalent circuit approach has the advantage of transparency, as it identifies\npossible parameters that facilitate understanding of the relationships.\nHowever, the model is less flexible to environmental changes or non-standard\nsatellite behavior.

In this, a language model's response to a given prompt about\ngiven text is only correct if it exists in the collection of possible (i.e.,\ncandidate) answers, and text corresponding to incorrect responses is fed into a\nmore predictive (but slower) language model. This process is repeated for a\ncollection of language models, or until all predictions about the text are\ncorrect. We used the LMC algorithm to extract patient dates of birth from\nmedical documents, and combining a collection of language models in a\nmulti-stage cascade significantly increased prediction speed and accuracy over\nindividual language models, while greatly reducing the number of corresponding\nhallucinations. We believe that the novel LMC algorithm significantly\ncontributes to the knowledge extraction field, and that this should be explored\nmuch further in the future.",

VeriRAG integrates (1) an autoencoder-based similarity\nmeasurement model for precise retrieval of reference RTL designs for the LLM,\nand (2) an iterative code revision pipeline that allows the LLM to ensure DFT\ncompliance while maintaining synthesizability. To support VeriRAG, we introduce\nVeriDFT, a Verilog-based DFT dataset curated for DFT-aware RTL repairs. VeriRAG\nretrieves structurally similar RTL designs from VeriDFT, each paired with a\nrigorously validated correction, as references for code repair. With VeriRAG\nand VeriDFT, we achieve fully automated DFT correction -- resulting in a\n7.72-fold improvement in successful repair rate compared to the zero-shot\nbaseline (Fig. 5 in Section V).

Among these models, Stable Diffusion (SD) - an open-source\ntext-to-image generation model - has become the most popular, producing over 12\nbillion images annually. However, the widespread use of these models raises\nconcerns regarding their social and environmental sustainability.\n  Aims: To reduce the harm that SD models may have on society and the\nenvironment, we introduce SustainDiffusion, a search-based approach designed to\nenhance the social and environmental sustainability of SD models.\n  Method: SustainDiffusion searches the optimal combination of hyperparameters\nand prompt structures that can reduce gender and ethnic bias in generated\nimages while also lowering the energy consumption required for image\ngeneration. Importantly, SustainDiffusion maintains image quality comparable to\nthat of the original SD model.\n  Results: We conduct a comprehensive empirical evaluation of SustainDiffusion,\ntesting it against six different baselines using 56 different prompts. Our\nresults demonstrate that SustainDiffusion can reduce gender bias in SD3 by 68%,\nethnic bias by 59%, and energy consumption (calculated as the sum of CPU and\nGPU energy) by 48%. Additionally, the outcomes produced by SustainDiffusion are\nconsistent across multiple runs and can be generalised to various prompts.\n  Conclusions: With SustainDiffusion, we demonstrate how enhancing the social\nand environmental sustainability of text-to-image generation models is possible\nwithout fine-tuning or changing the model's architecture.",

However, MLLMs continue to\nstruggle with object hallucinations, where models produce seemingly plausible\nbut factually incorrect outputs, including objects that do not exist in the\nimage. Recent work has revealed that the prior knowledge in MLLMs significantly\nsuppresses visual information in deep layers, causing hallucinatory outputs.\nHowever, how these priors suppress visual information at the intermediate layer\nstage in MLLMs remains unclear. We observe that visual factual knowledge and\nthe differences between intermediate-layer prior/original probability\ndistributions show similar evolutionary trends in intermediate layers.\nMotivated by this, we introduce Decoding by Extracting Visual Facts (EVA), a\nsimple, training-free method that dynamically selects intermediate layers with\nthe most significant visual factual information. By contrasting the output\ndistributions of the selected layer derived from the original input and\npure-text input, EVA extracts visual factual knowledge and proportionally\nincorporates it into the final layer to correct the output logits. Importantly,\nEVA is model-agnostic, seamlessly integrates with various classic decoding\nstrategies, and is applicable across different MLLMs. We validate EVA on\nwidely-used benchmarks, and the results show that it significantly reduces\nhallucination rates compared to baseline methods, underscoring its\neffectiveness in mitigating hallucinations.",

For this purpose we reformulate the Schwinger-Dyson\nequation of the axial-vector vertex such that the bulk of its quantum\ncorrections is expressed in terms of a novel vertex. Crucially, this vertex\nsatisfies a symmetry-induced relation of its own, which involves the full\nquark-gluon vertex. As a result, the Schwinger-Dyson equation reproduces the\nstandard Ward-Takahashi identity satisfied by the axial-vector vertex.\nConsequently, the known relation between the quark mass function and the wave\nfunction of the pion in the chiral limit is duly fulfilled. The present\napproach offers valuable insights into the interplay between symmetry and\ndynamics, and provides a practical path towards computations of hadron physics\nwithin sophisticated approximations. In particular, the one-loop dressed\ntruncation of the key dynamical equations, including that of the quark-gluon\nvertex, is shown to be completely compatible with the required symmetry\nrelations.

The agent learns generalizable\nheuristics through reinforcement learning on large quantities of data mixing\ntrajectories with corresponding feedback from an evaluation environment.\nExperiments in continual pre-training on math reasoning show that Data Mixing\nAgent outperforms strong baselines in achieving balanced performance across\nsource and target field benchmarks. Furthermore, it generalizes well across\nunseen source fields, target models, and domain spaces without retraining.\nDirect application to the code generation field also indicates its adaptability\nacross target domains. Further analysis showcases the agents' well-aligned\nheuristics with human intuitions and their efficiency in achieving superior\nmodel performance with less source-field data.",

    "abstract": "As vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world\napplications, new safety risks arise from the subtle interplay between images\nand text. In particular, seemingly innocuous inputs can combine to reveal\nharmful intent, leading to unsafe model responses. Despite increasing attention\nto multimodal safety, previous approaches based on post hoc filtering or static\nrefusal prompts struggle to detect such latent risks, especially when\nharmfulness emerges only from the combination of inputs. We propose SIA (Safety\nvia Intent Awareness), a training-free prompt engineering framework that\nproactively detects and mitigates harmful intent in multimodal inputs. SIA\nemploys a three-stage reasoning process: (1) visual abstraction via captioning,\n(2) intent inference through few-shot chain-of-thought prompting, and (3)\nintent-conditioned response refinement. Rather than relying on predefined rules\nor classifiers, SIA dynamically adapts to the implicit intent inferred from the\nimage-text pair. Through extensive experiments on safety-critical benchmarks\nincluding SIUO, MM-SafetyBench, and HoliSafe, we demonstrate that SIA achieves\nsubstantial safety improvements, outperforming prior methods. Although SIA\nshows a minor reduction in general reasoning accuracy on MMStar, the\ncorresponding safety gains highlight the value of intent-aware reasoning in\naligning VLMs with human-centric values.",

The results\nalso show that our proposed LTH-based iterative magnitude pruning approach\nconsistently outperforms one-shot pruning methods.

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has shown its detailed expressive ability and\nhighly efficient rendering speed in the novel view synthesis (NVS) task. The\napplication to inverse rendering still faces several challenges, as the\ndiscrete nature of Gaussian primitives makes it difficult to apply geometry\nconstraints. Recent works introduce the signed distance field (SDF) as an extra\ncontinuous representation to regularize the geometry defined by Gaussian\nprimitives. It improves the decomposition quality, at the cost of increasing\nmemory usage and complicating training. Unlike these works, we introduce a\ndiscretized SDF to represent the continuous SDF in a discrete manner by\nencoding it within each Gaussian using a sampled value. This approach allows us\nto link the SDF with the Gaussian opacity through an SDF-to-opacity\ntransformation, enabling rendering the SDF via splatting and avoiding the\ncomputational cost of ray marching.The key challenge is to regularize the\ndiscrete samples to be consistent with the underlying SDF, as the discrete\nrepresentation can hardly apply the gradient-based constraints (\\eg Eikonal\nloss). For this, we project Gaussians onto the zero-level set of SDF and\nenforce alignment with the surface from splatting, namely a projection-based\nconsistency loss. Thanks to the discretized SDF, our method achieves higher\nrelighting quality, while requiring no extra memory beyond GS and avoiding\ncomplex manually designed optimization. The experiments reveal that our method\noutperforms existing Gaussian-based inverse rendering methods. Our code is\navailable at https://github.com/NK-CS-ZZL/DiscretizedSDF.",

    "abstract": "React is a JavaScript library used to build user interfaces for single-page\napplications. Although recent studies have shown the popularity and advantages\nof React in web development, the specific challenges users face remain unknown.\nThus, this study aims to analyse the React-related questions shared on Stack\nOverflow. The study utilizes an exploratory data analysis to investigate the\nmost frequently discussed keywords, error classification, and user\nreputation-based errors, which is the novelty of this work. The results show\nthe top eight most frequently used keywords on React-related questions, namely,\ncode, link, vir, href, connect, azure, windows, and website. The error\nclassification of questions from the sample shows that algorithmic error is the\nmost frequent issue faced by all groups of users, where mid-reputation users\ncontribute the most, accounting for 55.77%. This suggests the need for the\ncommunity to provide guidance materials in solving algorithm-related problems.\nWe expect that the results of this study will provide valuable insight into\nfuture research to support the React community during the early stages of\nimplementation, facilitating their ability to effectively overcome challenges\nto adoption.",

In endemic areas, however, an individual may have\nfever attributable either to malaria or to other causes. Thus, the parasite\nlevel of an individual with fever follows a two-component mixture, with the two\ncomponents corresponding to malaria and nonmalaria individuals. Furthermore,\nthe parasite levels of nonmalaria individuals can be characterized as a mixture\nof a zero component and a positive distribution. In this article, we propose a\nnonparametric maximum multinomial likelihood approach for estimating the\nproportion of malaria using parasite-level data from two groups of individuals\ncollected in two different seasons.

    "abstract": "Purpose: Accurate segmentation of glioma subregions in multi-parametric MRI\n(MP-MRI) is essential for diagnosis and treatment planning but remains\nchallenging due to tumor heterogeneity and ambiguous boundaries. This study\nproposes an uncertainty-guided hybrid framework integrating spherical\nprojection-based 2D modeling with targeted 3D refinement to enhance\nsegmentation accuracy and interpretability. Methods: Using the BraTS2020\ndataset (369 patients, four-modality MP-MRI), three 2D U-Nets were trained to\nsegment enhancing tumor (ET), tumor core (TC), and whole tumor (WT). Voxel-wise\nuncertainty was quantified via a spherical projection-based 2D nnU-Net,\ncapturing prediction variance across deformed inputs. A 3D sliding window was\nused to identify high-uncertainty regions, which were refined using a dedicated\n3D nnU-Net. Final outputs combined 2D and 3D predictions through a weighted\nfusion optimized via Particle Swarm Optimization. Results: The proposed method\noutperformed standalone 2D and 3D baselines, achieving Dice scores of 0.8124\n(ET), 0.7499 (TC), and 0.9055 (WT), with consistent gains in sensitivity and\nvisual coherence. Conclusion: This work presents a novel uncertainty-aware\nsegmentation strategy that adaptively integrates 2D and 3D modeling. By\nfocusing refinement on ambiguous regions, it improves both efficiency and\naccuracy, offering broad applicability to precision neuro-oncology and other\nhigh-stakes medical imaging tasks.",

One of the great strengths\nof wireless networks based on Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)\nis the ease with which different non-overlapping time-frequency (TF) resources\ncan be allocated to different users by simply shifting each user's signal in\ntime and frequency. However, a significant weaknesses of OFDM is the\ninflexibility of sub-carrier spacing. Since OFDM does not allow users to have\ndifferent sub-carrier spacing, a single user subject to inter-carrier\ninterference causes carrier spacing to increase for all users. Zak-OTFS is an\nalternative delay-Doppler (DD) domain modulation scheme, where, in contrast to\nOFDM, the Input-Output (I/O) relation is predictable. We match the strength of\nOFDM by designing a novel DD domain method of shaping the transmitted Zak-OTFS\npulse on the uplink that enables flexible non-overlapping TF resource\nallocation. The base station (BS) receives a superposition of uplink signals\nand applies individual matched filters to obtain the data specific to\nindividual users. We develop theoretical measures of interference between\nusers, and present numerical simulations for a vehicular channel model\nrepresentative of next generation propagation environments. We demonstrate\nsingle-user performance in a multiuser Zak-OTFS uplink system without needing\nto provision guard bands between TF resources allocated to different users.\nThese performance results demonstrate that the benefits of a predictable\nZak-OTFS waveform can be realized within an architecture for uplink\ncommunication.",

We review historical precedents, from\ninverted and meta-Turing variants to modern supervised reverse-Turing\nclassifiers, and highlight the novelty of combining quality thresholds, phased\ndifficulty levels, and minimax bounds. We then formalize the dual test: define\nthe judge's task over N independent rounds with fresh prompts drawn from a\nprompt space Q, introduce a quality function Q and parameters tau and delta,\nand cast the interaction as a two-player zero-sum game over the adversary's\nfeasible strategy set M. Next, we map this minimax game onto an RL-HF style\nalignment loop, in which an undetectability detector D provides negative reward\nfor stealthy outputs, balanced by a quality proxy that preserves fluency.\nThroughout, we include detailed explanations of each component notation, the\nmeaning of inner minimization over sequences, phased tests, and iterative\nadversarial training and conclude with a suggestion for a couple of immediate\nactions.",

Although the generated heuristics have achieved\nbetter solving performance than the hand-crafted ones with little adaptability,\nthe advantage of current LLM-based methods is limited to few MILP instances in\none problem class, as they fail to capture the instance characteristics in the\nproblem class (the MILP instances generated from the same mathematical model\nare defined as a problem class).

We simulate realistic attack scenarios where an attacker uses\nmild-mannered queries and indirect prompt injections to exploit an LLM\nintegrated with private corporate data. We develop a formal threat model for\nthese multi-turn inference attacks and analyze them using probability theory,\noptimization frameworks, and information-theoretic leakage bounds. The attacks\nare shown to reliably exfiltrate sensitive information from the LLM's context\n(e.g., internal SharePoint documents or emails), even when standard safety\nmeasures are in place.\n  We propose and evaluate defenses to counter such attacks, including\nstatistical anomaly detection, fine-grained access control, prompt sanitization\ntechniques, and architectural modifications to LLM deployment. Each defense is\nsupported by mathematical analysis or experimental simulation. For example, we\nderive bounds on information leakage under differential privacy-based training\nand demonstrate an anomaly detection method that flags multi-turn attacks with\nhigh AUC. We also introduce an approach called \"spotlighting\" that uses input\ntransformations to isolate untrusted prompt content, reducing attack success by\nan order of magnitude.

The combination of\ncylinders with different resolutions can effectively capture more critical\nlocations and multi-scale features, greatly facilitates fine detail learning\nand robustness to different resolutions.

This paper aims to enable\nnon-expert users to program in-contact motions more efficiently by eliminating\nthe need for a dedicated PIP calibration, thereby enabling flexible robot tool\nchanges. Since demonstrated tasks generally also contain motions with\nnon-contact, our approach uses these parts to estimate the robot's PIP using\nestablished estimation techniques. The results show that the estimation of the\npayload's mass is accurate, whereas the center of mass and the inertia tensor\nare affected by noise and a lack of excitation.

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a popular approach for collaborative\nmachine learning in sixth-generation (6G) networks, primarily due to its\nprivacy-preserving capabilities. The deployment of FL algorithms is expected to\nempower a wide range of Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications, e.g., autonomous\ndriving, augmented reality, and healthcare. The mission-critical and\ntime-sensitive nature of these applications necessitates the design of\nlow-latency FL frameworks that guarantee high learning performance. In\npractice, achieving low-latency FL faces two challenges: the overhead of\ncomputing and transmitting high-dimensional model updates, and the\nheterogeneity in communication-and-computation (C$^2$) capabilities across\ndevices. To address these challenges, we propose a novel C$^2$-aware framework\nfor optimal batch-size control that minimizes end-to-end (E2E) learning latency\nwhile ensuring convergence. The framework is designed to balance a fundamental\nC$^2$ tradeoff as revealed through convergence analysis. Specifically,\nincreasing batch sizes improves the accuracy of gradient estimation in FL and\nthus reduces the number of communication rounds required for convergence, but\nresults in higher per-round latency, and vice versa. The associated problem of\nlatency minimization is intractable; however, we solve it by designing an\naccurate and tractable surrogate for convergence speed, with parameters fitted\nto real data. This approach yields two batch-size control strategies tailored\nto scenarios with slow and fast fading, while also accommodating device\nheterogeneity. Extensive experiments using real datasets demonstrate that the\nproposed strategies outperform conventional batch-size adaptation schemes that\ndo not consider the C$^2$ tradeoff or device heterogeneity.",

    "abstract": "Medical image segmentation is crucial for many healthcare tasks, including\ndisease diagnosis and treatment planning. One key area is the segmentation of\nskin lesions, which is vital for diagnosing skin cancer and monitoring\npatients. In this context, this paper introduces SegDT, a new segmentation\nmodel based on diffusion transformer (DiT). SegDT is designed to work on\nlow-cost hardware and incorporates Rectified Flow, which improves the\ngeneration quality at reduced inference steps and maintains the flexibility of\nstandard diffusion models. Our method is evaluated on three benchmarking\ndatasets and compared against several existing works, achieving\nstate-of-the-art results while maintaining fast inference speeds. This makes\nthe proposed model appealing for real-world medical applications. This work\nadvances the performance and capabilities of deep learning models in medical\nimage analysis, enabling faster, more accurate diagnostic tools for healthcare\nprofessionals.

    "abstract": "Cross-classified data frequently arise in scientific fields such as\neducation, healthcare, and social sciences. A common modeling strategy is to\nintroduce crossed random effects within a regression framework. However, this\napproach often encounters serious computational bottlenecks, particularly for\nnon-Gaussian outcomes. In this paper, we propose a scalable and flexible method\nthat approximates the distribution of each random effect by a discrete\ndistribution, effectively partitioning the random effects into a finite number\nof representative groups. This approximation allows us to express the model as\na multi-way grouped structure, which can be efficiently estimated using a\nsimple and fast iterative algorithm. The proposed method accommodates a wide\nrange of outcome models and remains applicable even in settings with more than\ntwo-way cross-classification. We theoretically establish the consistency and\nasymptotic normality of the estimator under general settings of classification\nlevels. Through simulation studies and real data applications, we demonstrate\nthe practical performance of the proposed method in logistic, Poisson, and\nordered probit regression models involving cross-classified structures.",

Experimental results compare each submodule with the current\nstate-of-the-art, and evaluate the performance of the overall integrated system\nin realistic setting on low-power hardware. Compelling change detection results\nare obtained in terms of F1 score as a function of compression rate, sustaining\na throughput of 0.7 Mpixel/s on a 15W accelerator.",

    "abstract": "Mixup has become a popular augmentation strategy for image classification,\nyet its naive pixel-wise interpolation often produces unrealistic images that\ncan hinder learning, particularly in high-stakes medical applications. We\npropose GeMix, a two-stage framework that replaces heuristic blending with a\nlearned, label-aware interpolation powered by class-conditional GANs. First, a\nStyleGAN2-ADA generator is trained on the target dataset. During augmentation,\nwe sample two label vectors from Dirichlet priors biased toward different\nclasses and blend them via a Beta-distributed coefficient. Then, we condition\nthe generator on this soft label to synthesize visually coherent images that\nlie along a continuous class manifold. We benchmark GeMix on the large-scale\nCOVIDx-CT-3 dataset using three backbones (ResNet-50, ResNet-101,\nEfficientNet-B0). When combined with real data, our method increases macro-F1\nover traditional mixup for all backbones, reducing the false negative rate for\nCOVID-19 detection. GeMix is thus a drop-in replacement for pixel-space mixup,\ndelivering stronger regularization and greater semantic fidelity, without\ndisrupting existing training pipelines.

A consortium comprising GMV GmbH, Saarland\nUniversity, and Thales Alenia Space collaborates to develop AI-driven\nalgorithms and demonstrates their effectiveness over traditional methods for\ntwo crucial operational challenges: data routing and resource allocation. In\nthe routing use case, Reinforcement Learning (RL) is used to improve the\nend-to-end latency by learning from historical queuing latency, outperforming\nclassical shortest path algorithms. For resource allocation, RL optimizes the\nscheduling of tasks across constellations, focussing on efficiently using\nlimited resources such as battery and memory. Both use cases were tested for\nmultiple satellite constellation configurations and operational scenarios,\nresembling the real-life spacecraft operations of communications and Earth\nobservation satellites. This research demonstrates that RL not only competes\nwith classical approaches but also offers enhanced flexibility, scalability,\nand generalizability in decision-making processes, which is crucial for the\nautonomous and intelligent management of satellite fleets.

Furthermore, due to the pixelated design representation, the\nuse of a fine mesh is essential to obtain geometrically well-defined structures\nand to accurately compute response quantities such as the von Mises stress.\nTherefore, the computational cost of solving a fine-mesh topology optimization\nproblem quickly adds up. To address this challenge, we consider a multi-level\nadaptive refinement and coarsening strategy based on configurational forces.\nConfigurational forces based on the Eshelby stress predict configurational\nchanges such as crack propagation or dislocation motion. Due to a relaxation in\nthe calculation of (Eshelby) stresses with respect to the design variables,\ndiscrete configurational forces increase not only in highly stressed regions,\nbut also in grey transition regions (design boundaries). For this reason they\nare an ideal criterion for mesh adaptivity in topology optimization, especially\nwhen avoiding stress failure is a priority. By using configurational forces for\nrefinement, we obtain a high-resolution structure where the refined mesh is\npresent along the design boundaries as well as in stress-critical regions.

Traditional approaches treat spatial and temporal information\nseparately. Due to issues like motion blur, it is challenging to accurately\nrepresent the spatial information of rapidly moving objects. This can lead to\ntemporally important regions being underemphasized during spatial feature\nextraction, which in turn hinders accurate spatio-temporal interaction and\nvideo understanding. To address this limitation, we propose an innovative video\nrepresentation method called Dynamic-Image (DynImg). Specifically, we introduce\na set of non-key frames as temporal prompts to highlight the spatial areas\ncontaining fast-moving objects. During the process of visual feature\nextraction, these prompts guide the model to pay additional attention to the\nfine-grained spatial features corresponding to these regions. Moreover, to\nmaintain the correct sequence for DynImg, we employ a corresponding 4D video\nRotary Position Embedding. This retains both the temporal and spatial adjacency\nof DynImg, helping MLLM understand the spatio-temporal order within this\ncombined format. Experimental evaluations reveal that DynImg surpasses the\nstate-of-the-art methods by approximately 2% across multiple video\nunderstanding benchmarks, proving the effectiveness of our temporal prompts in\nenhancing video comprehension.",

The original\nstudy found underplacement - the majority of their sample apparently expected\nto perform worse than others - in difficult tasks with monetary incentives,\ncontradicting the widely held assumption of a general human tendency toward\noverconfidence. This paper challenges the comparability of the two payment\nschemes, arguing that differences in outcome structures and non-monetary\nmotives may have influenced participants' choices beyond misconfidence. In an\nonline replication, a fixed-outcome distribution lottery mechanism with\ninterdependent success probabilities and no variance in the number of winners -\ndesigned to better align with the performance-based payment scheme - is\ncompared against the probabilistic-outcome distribution lottery used in the\noriginal study, which features an independent success probability and a\nvariable number of winners. The results align more closely with traditional\noverplacement patterns than underplacement, as nearly three-fourths of\nparticipants prefer the performance-based option regardless of lottery design.\nKey predictors of voting behavior include expected performance, group\nperformance estimations, and sample question outcomes, while factors such as\nsocial comparison tendencies and risk attitudes play no significant role.\nSelf-reported voting rationales highlight the influence of normative beliefs,\ncontrol preferences, and feedback signals beyond confidence.

We provide practical calculation results for\ncanonical interconnections and apply our result to Lur'e systems to obtain a\ngeneralization of the celebrated circle criterion, which deals with broader\nclass of nonlinearities, and we derive (incremental) $L_2$-gain performance\nbounds. We illustrate the power of the new approach on the analysis of several\nexamples.",

    "abstract": "The Aschenbach effect is widely regarded as a manifestation of two\nquintessential relativistic features: frame dragging and extreme spacetime\ncurvature. Traditionally associated with rotating geometries, this\nnon-monotonic behavior in orbital angular velocity challenges Newtonian\nintuition. In our previous work, however, we demonstrated that this velocity\nirregularity is not exclusive to spinning spacetimes. Specifically, we showed\nthat the presence of a stable minimum in the gravitational potential,\ncorresponding to a stable photon sphere, can reproduce Aschenbach-like behavior\nin static black holes as well. This observation suggests that, even in the\nabsence of rotational frame dragging, curvature alone (if encoded through\nappropriate geometric extrema) may be sufficient to induce non-monotonic\nvelocity profiles.\n  In this study, we build upon that foundation to investigate whether black\nhole architectures in theories of Massive Gravity can inherently support the\nemergence of Aschenbach-like phenomena. Furthermore, can this Aschenbach-like\nphenomenon in static configurations be considered as an observable signature in\nthe dynamics of general relativity, similar to the original Aschenbach effect\nin rotating spacetimes?",

Macroscopic viscoelasticity from rheological measurements and\nmicroscopic birefringence from optical measurements are integrated to evaluate\nthe microstructural deformation and orientation of the fluids under extensional\nstress. The proposed technique integrates a liquid dripping method with a\nhigh-speed polarization camera to measure the extensional stress and flow\nbirefringence simultaneously. In the liquid dripping method, temporal evolution\nimages of the liquid filament diameter for fluids dripping from a nozzle are\nmeasured to obtain the extensional stress loading on the filament. These images\nare acquired using the high-speed polarization camera that captures full-field\ntwo-dimensional (2D) birefringence with high spatiotemporal resolution.\nWormlike and networked micellar solutions of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide\n(CTAB) and sodium salicylate (NaSal) with varying concentrations of CTAB and\nNaSal are employed as the measurement targets. Consequently, we successfully\nvisualized temporally developing images of the flow birefringence field of\nuniaxially extending micellar solutions induced by the orientation of micelles.\nFurthermore, the proposed technique supports investigating the conditions for\nestablishing the stress-optical rule, which is the linear relationship between\nstress and birefringence. The stress-optical coefficient, which is a\nproportionality constant indicating the sensitivity of birefringence to stress,\nis analyzed from these measurements. The stress-optical coefficient under\nuniaxial extensional flow, obtained using the proposed technique, is confirmed\nto be comparable to that under shear flow.",

This structured visual\nexploration enables users to seamlessly move from high-level planning to\ndetailed design decisions and implementations, while comparing alternative\nsolutions across multiple performance metrics. Additionally, drawing from\nestablished workflow design patterns, FLOWFORGE provides context-aware, in-situ\nsuggestions at each level as users navigate the design space, enhancing the\nworkflow creation process with practical guidance.

One proposed channel are rapidly accreting supermassive PopIII stars\n(SMSs) that form in large primordial gas halos and grow up to $<10^6\\,M_\\odot$.\nThey eventually collapse due to the general relativistic instability and could\nlead to supernova-like explosions. This releases massive and energetic ejecta\nthat then interact with the halo medium via an optically thick shock.

In\nthis paper, we investigate the resource allocation design for an MA\narray-enhanced downlink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system, where a\nbase station deploys multiple MAs to serve multiple single-antenna users. Our\ngoal is to maximize the sum rate of all users by jointly optimizing the\ntransmit beamforming, positions of MAs, successive interference cancellation\n(SIC) decoding order, and users' corresponding decoding indicator matrix, while\nadhering to constraints on the maximum transmit power and finite MA moving\nregion. The formulated problem is inherently highly non-convex, rendering it\nchallenging to acquire a globally optimal solution. As a compromise, we propose\na low-complexity two-stage optimization algorithm to obtain an effective\nsuboptimal solution. Specifically, in stage one, the SIC decoding order is\nfirst determined by solving a channel gain maximization problem. Then, in stage\ntwo, with the given SIC decoding order, the beamforming vectors, MA positions,\nand users' decoding indicator matrix are iteratively optimized by capitalizing\non alternating optimization, successive convex approximation (SCA), and genetic\nalgorithm (GA). Simulation results unveil that the sum-rate performance of the\nproposed MA-enabled downlink NOMA system significantly outperforms that of\nconventional fixed-position antenna (FPA) systems.

We introduce RankMixer, a hardware-aware model design\ntailored towards a unified and scalable feature-interaction architecture.\nRankMixer retains the transformer's high parallelism while replacing quadratic\nself-attention with multi-head token mixing module for higher efficiency.\nBesides, RankMixer maintains both the modeling for distinct feature subspaces\nand cross-feature-space interactions with Per-token FFNs. We further extend it\nto one billion parameters with a Sparse-MoE variant for higher ROI. A dynamic\nrouting strategy is adapted to address the inadequacy and imbalance of experts\ntraining. Experiments show RankMixer's superior scaling abilities on a\ntrillion-scale production dataset. By replacing previously diverse handcrafted\nlow-MFU modules with RankMixer, we boost the model MFU from 4.5\\% to 45\\%, and\nscale our ranking model parameters by 100x while maintaining roughly the same\ninference latency.

The running time is $n^{f(\\epsilon)\\cdot\\log\\log\nn}$ for any $c$, and where $f$ is a function of $\\epsilon$ only. This is a\nmajor improvement over the so far best known running time of\n$n^{\\log^{O(1/\\epsilon)}n}$ time and a big step towards a PTAS for Euclidean\nCVRP.\n  In our algorithm, we first give a polynomial time reduction of the CVRP in\n$\\mathbb{R}^d$ (for any fixed $d$) to an uncapacitated routing problem in\n$\\mathbb{R}^d$ that we call the $m$-paths problem. Here, one needs to find\nexactly $m$ paths between two points $a$ and $b$, covering all the given points\nin the Euclidean space. We then give a Q-PTAS for the $m$-paths problem in the\npane. Any PTAS for the (arguably easier to handle) Euclidean $m$-paths problem\nis most likely to imply a PTAS for the Euclidean CVRP.",

We proposed a hybrid optimization method that combines a\nsimulated annealing (SA)-based non-quantum-type Ising machine with a quantum\nannealing machine. However, its applicability remains unclear. Therefore, we\nevaluated the performance of the hybrid method on large-size Ising models and\nanalyzed its characteristics.

From the\nviewpoint of the minimum energy gap, we found that solving the sub-Ising model\nwith a quantum annealing machine results in a higher solution accuracy than\nsolving the original Ising model.

Existing methods address\nthis challenge by tapping Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to access knowledge\nbeyond the training data.

In this paper, we introduce HOLa (Zero-Shot HOI Detection with\nLow-Rank Decomposed VLM Feature Adaptation), a novel approach that both\nenhances generalization to unseen classes and improves action distinction. In\ntraining, HOLa decomposes VLM text features for given HOI classes via low-rank\nfactorization, producing class-shared basis features and adaptable weights.\nThese features and weights form a compact HOI representation that preserves\nshared information across classes, enhancing generalization to unseen classes.\nSubsequently, we refine action distinction by adapting weights for each HOI\nclass and introducing human-object tokens to enrich visual interaction\nrepresentations.

The fidelity and robustness of LES depends critically on the SGS\nmodel, particularly in coarse simulations where much of the turbulence spectrum\nremains unresolved.\n  In this work, we extend the tau-orthogonal (TO) method, a data-driven SGS\nmodeling framework, to three-dimensional turbulent flows. The method\nreformulates the high-dimensional SGS closure problem as a low-dimensional\nprediction task focused on scale-aware quantities of interest (QoIs). We extend\nthe model to incorporate QoI-state dependence and temporal correlations by\ncombining regularized least-squares regression with a multivariate Gaussian\nresidual model. This yields a simple yet effective stochastic time-series\nprediction model (the LRS model), with orders-of-magnitude fewer parameters\nthan typical deep learning approaches which try to directly learn the\nhigh-dimensional SGS closure.\n  We demonstrate the effectiveness of the TO LRS model in three-dimensional\nforced isotropic turbulence and turbulent channel flow. The model achieves\naccurate long-term QoI distributions, robust performance across hyperparameter\nsettings, and good reproduction of key flow features such as kinetic energy\nspectra and coherent structures, despite being trained solely on QoI\ntrajectories.

The semantics of BPPLs are usually mathematically complex and\nunable to reason about desirable properties such as expected values and\nindependence of random variables. To reason about these properties in a\nnon-Bayesian setting, probabilistic separation logics such as PSL and Lilac\ninterpret separating conjunction as probabilistic independence of random\nvariables. However, no existing separation logic can handle Bayesian updating,\nwhich is the key distinguishing feature of BPPLs.\n  To close this gap, we introduce Bayesian separation logic (BaSL), a\nprobabilistic separation logic that gives semantics to BPPL. We prove an\ninternal version of Bayes' theorem using a result in measure theory known as\nthe Rokhlin-Simmons disintegration theorem. Consequently, BaSL can model\nprobabilistic programming concepts such as Bayesian updating, unnormalised\ndistribution, conditional distribution, soft constraint, conjugate prior and\nimproper prior while maintaining modularity via the frame rule. The model of\nBaSL is based on a novel instantiation of Kripke resource monoid via\n$\\sigma$-finite measure spaces over the Hilbert cube, and the semantics of\nHoare triple is compatible with an existing denotational semantics of BPPL\nbased on the category of $s$-finite kernels.

Counterintuitively, elastoresistance\nmeasurements--a standard probe of nematicity--show no corresponding signal,\nruling out a nematic phase transition and placing strong constraints on\npossible explanations. Beyond nematicity, the torque is paramagnetic for\nin-plane magnetic field, while above a critical out-of-plane field, an in-plane\nmagnetisation appears, accompanied by hysteresis. We show that this combination\nof features cannot be accounted for by charge density waves or intraband\nmagnetic order. Instead, we propose that interband ordering--via a\nsymmetry-allowed interband spin-orbit coupling and a time-reversal and spatial\nsymmetry-breaking interband order parameter--together with a background strain\nfield, consistent with typical experimental conditions, provides a natural\nexplanation; in our picture, the behaviour at $T_\\tau$ is understood as a\ncrossover in the symmetry-allowed interband spin-orbit coupling strength.

Secondly,\nmulti-task contrastive learning combines global modal contrast and local\ngranularity alignment to enhance cross modal representation consistency.\nAdaptive Multi-loss Aggregation employs a dynamic uncertainty based weighting\nmechanism to calibrate loss contributions according to each task's uncertainty,\nthereby mitigating gradient interference.

    "abstract": "Accurate segmentation is crucial for clinical applications, but existing\nmodels often assume fixed, high-resolution inputs and degrade significantly\nwhen faced with lower-resolution data in real-world scenarios. To address this\nlimitation, we propose RARE-UNet, a resolution-aware multi-scale segmentation\narchitecture that dynamically adapts its inference path to the spatial\nresolution of the input. Central to our design are multi-scale blocks\nintegrated at multiple encoder depths, a resolution-aware routing mechanism,\nand consistency-driven training that aligns multi-resolution features with\nfull-resolution representations. We evaluate RARE-UNet on two benchmark brain\nimaging tasks for hippocampus and tumor segmentation. Compared to standard\nUNet, its multi-resolution augmented variant, and nnUNet, our model achieves\nthe highest average Dice scores of 0.84 and 0.65 across resolution, while\nmaintaining consistent performance and significantly reduced inference time at\nlower resolutions. These results highlight the effectiveness and scalability of\nour architecture in achieving resolution-robust segmentation. The codes are\navailable at: https://github.com/simonsejse/RARE-UNet.",

Study 1 examines whether LLMs can estimate mechanical\nadvantage (MA). State-of-the-art models performed marginally but significantly\nabove chance, and their estimates correlated significantly with ground-truth\nMA. Significant correlations between number of pulleys and model estimates\nsuggest that models employed a pulley counting heuristic, without necessarily\nsimulating pulley systems to derive precise values. Study 2 tested this by\nprobing whether LLMs represent global features crucial to MA estimation. Models\nevaluated a functionally connected pulley system against a fake system with\nrandomly placed components. Without explicit cues, models identified the\nfunctional system as having greater MA with F1=0.8, suggesting LLMs could\nrepresent systems well enough to differentiate jumbled from functional systems.\nStudy 3 built on this by asking LLMs to compare functional systems with matched\nsystems which were connected up but which transferred no force to the weight;\nLLMs identified the functional system with F1=0.46, suggesting random guessing.\nInsofar as they may generalize, these findings are compatible with the notion\nthat LLMs manipulate internal world models, sufficient to exploit statistical\nassociations between pulley count and MA (Study 1), and to approximately\nrepresent system components' spatial relations (Study 2).

The emergence of large language\nmodel (LLM) is providing a new path to achieve this goal. However, existing\nLLM-based drama generation methods often result in AI agents that lack\ninitiative and cannot interact with the physical environment. Furthermore,\nthese methods typically require detailed user input to drive the drama. These\nlimitations reduce the interactivity and immersion of online real-time\nperformance. To address the above challenges, we propose HAMLET, a multi-agent\nframework focused on drama creation and online performance. Given a simple\ntopic, the framework generates a narrative blueprint, guiding the subsequent\nimprovisational performance. During the online performance, each actor is given\nan autonomous mind. This means that actors can make independent decisions based\non their own background, goals, and emotional state. In addition to\nconversations with other actors, their decisions can also change the state of\nscene props through actions such as opening a letter or picking up a weapon.\nThe change is then broadcast to other related actors, updating what they know\nand care about, which in turn influences their next action. To evaluate the\nquality of drama performance, we designed an evaluation method to assess three\nprimary aspects, including character performance, narrative quality, and\ninteraction experience. The experimental evaluation shows that HAMLET can\ncreate expressive and coherent theatrical experiences. Our code, dataset and\nmodels are available at https://github.com/HAMLET-2025/HAMLET.",

We\npresent results at two distinct levels of generality.\n  First (instance-sensitive bound), we introduce, to our knowledge, the first\ndeterministic algorithm whose runtime provably scales with the certificate size\n$U = |\\Sigma(S)|$, the number of distinct subset sums. Our enumerator\nconstructs all such sums in time $O(U \\cdot n^2)$, with a randomized variant\nachieving expected time $O(U \\cdot n)$. This provides a constructive link to\nInstance Complexity by tying runtime to the size of an\ninformation-theoretically minimal certificate.\n  Second (unconditional worst-case bound), by combining this enumerator with a\ndouble meet-in-the-middle strategy and a Controlled Aliasing technique that\nenforces a simple canonical-normal-form (CNF) expansion policy on aliased\nstates, we obtain a deterministic solver running in $O^*(2^{n/2-\\varepsilon})$\ntime with $\\varepsilon=\\log_2(\\frac{4}{3})$ - the first unconditional\ndeterministic improvement over the classical $O^*(2^{n/2})$ bound for all\nsufficiently large $n$.\n  Finally, we refine fine-grained hardness for Subset Sum by making explicit\nthe structural regime (high collision entropy / near collision-free) implicitly\nassumed by SETH-based reductions, i.e., instances with near-maximal $U$.",

Previous R1-Style methods mainly focus on mathematical reasoning\nand code intelligence. It is of great research significance to verify their\nadvantages on more general multimodal data. Chart is an important multimodal\ndata type with rich information, which brings important research challenges in\ncomplex reasoning. In this work, we introduce Chart-R1, a chart-domain\nvision-language model with reinforcement learning fine-tuning to enable complex\nchart reasoning. To support Chart-R1, we first propose a novel programmatic\ndata synthesis technology to generate high-quality step-by-step chart reasoning\ndata covering single- and multi-subcharts, which makes up for the lack of\nreasoning data in the chart domain. Then we develop a two-stage training\nstrategy: Chart-COT with step-by-step chain-of-thought supervision, and\nChart-RFT with numerically sensitive reinforcement fine-tuning. Chart-COT aims\nto decompose complex chart reasoning tasks into fine-grained, understandable\nsubtasks through step-by-step supervision, which lays a good foundation for\nimproving the reasoning level of reinforcement learning. Chart-RFT utilize the\ntypical group relative policy optimization strategy, in which a relatively soft\nreward is adopted for numerical response to emphasize the numerical sensitivity\nin the chart domain. We conduct extensive experiments on open-source benchmarks\nand self-built chart reasoning dataset (\\emph{i.e., ChartRQA}).

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) allows us to train models,\nsuch as language models (LMs), to follow complex human preferences. In RLHF for\nLMs, we first train an LM using supervised fine-tuning, sample pairs of\nresponses, obtain human feedback, and use the resulting data to train a reward\nmodel (RM). RL methods are then used to train the LM to maximize the reward\ngiven by the RM. As training progresses, the responses generated by the LM no\nlonger resemble the responses seen by the RM during training, leading to the RM\nbecoming inaccurate. The score given by the RM keeps increasing, but the\nlearned behavior no longer matches the human preferences. This issue is known\nas overoptimization. We investigate overoptimization from the point of view of\ndistribution shift and show that the shift results in an inconsistent estimate\nof the RM parameters, leading to an inconsistent estimate of the policy\ngradient. We propose Off-Policy Corrected Reward Modeling (OCRM), which\niteratively off-policy corrects the RM using importance weighting, without\nrequiring new labels or samples. This results in a more accurate RM, which\nempirically leads to an improved final policy. We validate our approach in\nexperiments with summarization and chatbot datasets and show that it performs\nsignificantly better than standard RLHF methods and baselines.

Motivated by this gap, we propose UMIVR, an\nUncertainty-Minimizing Interactive Text-to-Video Retrieval framework that\nexplicitly quantifies three critical uncertainties-text ambiguity, mapping\nuncertainty, and frame uncertainty-via principled, training-free metrics:\nsemantic entropy-based Text Ambiguity Score (TAS), Jensen-Shannon\ndivergence-based Mapping Uncertainty Score (MUS), and a Temporal Quality-based\nFrame Sampler (TQFS).

    "abstract": "Visual Assessment of Cluster Tendency (VAT) is a widely used unsupervised\ntechnique to assess the presence of cluster structure in unlabeled datasets.\nHowever, its standard implementation suffers from significant performance\nlimitations due to its O(n^2) time complexity and inefficient memory usage. In\nthis work, we present Fast-VAT, a high-performance reimplementation of the VAT\nalgorithm in Python, augmented with Numba's Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation and\nCython's static typing and low-level memory optimizations. Our approach\nachieves up to 50x speedup over the baseline implementation, while preserving\nthe output fidelity of the original method. We validate Fast-VAT on a suite of\nreal and synthetic datasets -- including Iris, Mall Customers, and Spotify\nsubsets -- and verify cluster tendency using Hopkins statistics, PCA, and\nt-SNE. Additionally, we compare VAT's structural insights with clustering\nresults from DBSCAN and K-Means to confirm its reliability.",

    "abstract": "The promotion of Conservation Tillage Technology (CTT) is critical for\nmitigating global soil degradation, yet their actual adoption rates remain\nsubstantially lower than anticipated targets. Existing research predominantly\nfocuses on static factor analyses, failing to adequately capture the dynamic\nevolutionary mechanisms of farmer strategic interactions and the impacts of\ninformation asymmetries in agricultural markets. This study constructs an\nevolutionary game model integrating heterogeneous time preferences and lemon\nmarket effects to reveal the dynamic equilibrium of technology adoption within\nfarmer groups operating under bounded rationality. Key findings indicate that\nfarmers with high time preferences significantly impede CTT adoption due to the\nexcessive discounting of long-term benefits. Furthermore, the lemon market\neffect dictates the system's equilibrium states: 1) When the lemon market\nbenefit ($P$) exceeds the lemon market loss ($Q$) ($P > Q$), stable tripartite\ncoexistence of adoption strategies emerges; 2) When $P < Q$, the system evolves\nunpredictably, exhibiting dynamics characterized by heteroclinic cycles; 3) At\nthe critical threshold $P = Q$, the system transforms into a conservative\nHamiltonian system, yielding stable periodic oscillation solutions. Based on\nthese insights, policy recommendations are proposed: implementing ecological\ncertification schemes to mitigate information asymmetry, offering subsidies and\ninsurance to reduce adoption risks, and utilizing environmental taxes to\ninternalize the negative externalities associated with conventional tillage.\nThis research not only provides a dynamic analytical paradigm for the diffusion\nof green agricultural technologies but also furnishes a theoretical foundation\nfor designing sustainable agricultural policies in developing countries.",

Over-actuated\naircraft configurations, particularly prevalent in eVTOL and military\napplications, require control allocation algorithms to distribute commanded\ncontrol moments among available actuators while respecting position and rate\nconstraints. Existing methods such as direct allocation, pseudo-inverse,\ncascaded generalized inverse, and exact redistributed pseudo-inverse either\ncannot handle rate constraints in continuous time or require discretization\napproaches that compromise performance. Current QP methods that incorporate\nrate constraints rely on slack variables to ensure feasibility, which prevents\nfull utilization of the attainable moment set and degrades allocation\nperformance. The proposed methodology addresses this limitation by calculating\nthe attainable moment set from both position and rate constraints through\nconvex hull operations, then ensuring feasibility by scaling unattainable\ncommanded moments to the boundary of the attainable moment set while preserving\ntheir direction. This approach guarantees the feasibility of the optimization\nproblem without slack variables. The method is validated through simulation on\nan F-18 fighter aircraft control allocation problem, demonstrating equivalent\nperformance to the established exact redistributed pseudo-inverse method while\nproviding smoother actuator behavior and enhanced constraint satisfaction.\nResults show that incorporating continuous-time rate constraints leads to\nimproved actuator tracking, reduced overshoot, and more precise adherence to\nposition limits, which is essential for aircraft safety, ride comfort, and\nactuator longevity.",

    "abstract": "The visual systems of birds and mammals exhibit remarkable organizational\nsimilarities: the dorsal ventricular ridge (DVR) demonstrates a columnar\nmicrocircuitry that parallels the cortical architecture observed in mammals.\nHowever, the specific neuronal subtypes involved and their functional roles in\npigeon hierarchical visual processing remain unclear. This study investigates\nthe role of excitatory parvalbumin (PV+) neurons within the Ento-MVL\n(entoallium-mesopallium venterolaterale) circuit of pigeons underlying\nhierarchical moving target recognition. Electrophysiological recordings and\nimmunofluorescence staining reveal that excitatory PV+ neurons originating from\nthe entopallial internal (Ei) predominantly modulate MVL responses to varying\nvisual stimuli. Using a heterochronous-speed recurrent neural network (HS-RNN)\nmodel, we further validated these dynamics, replicating the rapid adaptation of\nthe Ento-MVL circuit to moving visual targets. The findings suggest that the\nfast-spiking and excitatory properties of PV+ neurons enable rapid processing\nof motion-related information within the Ento-MVL circuit. Our results\nelucidate the functional role of excitatory PV+ neurons in hierarchical\ninformation processing under the columnar organization of the visual DVR and\nunderscore the convergent neural processing strategies shared by avian and\nmammalian visual systems.",

    "abstract": "This research was a part of a project that developed mobile robots that\nperformed targeted pollen spraying and automated harvesting in pergola\nstructured kiwifruit orchards. Multiple kiwifruit detachment mechanisms were\ndesigned and field testing of one of the concepts showed that the mechanism\ncould reliably pick kiwifruit. Furthermore, this kiwifruit detachment mechanism\nwas able to reach over 80 percent of fruit in the cluttered kiwifruit canopy,\nwhereas the previous state of the art mechanism was only able to reach less\nthan 70 percent of the fruit. Artificial pollination was performed by detecting\nflowers and then spraying pollen in solution onto the detected flowers from a\nline of sprayers on a boom, while driving at up to 1.4 ms-1. In addition, the\nheight of the canopy was measured and the spray boom was moved up and down to\nkeep the boom close enough to the flowers for the spray to reach the flowers,\nwhile minimising collisions with the canopy. Mobile robot navigation was\nperformed using a 2D lidar in apple orchards and vineyards. Lidar navigation in\nkiwifruit orchards was more challenging because the pergola structure only\nprovides a small amount of data for the direction of rows, compared to the\namount of data from the overhead canopy, the undulating ground and other\nobjects in the orchards. Multiple methods are presented here for extracting\nstructure defining features from 3D lidar data in kiwifruit orchards. In\naddition, a 3D lidar navigation system -- which performed row following, row\nend detection and row end turns -- was tested for over 30 km of autonomous\ndriving in kiwifruit orchards. Computer vision algorithms for row detection and\nrow following were also tested. The computer vision algorithm worked as well as\nthe 3D lidar row following method in testing.",

We address these issues by proposing a\nfoundational move toward inter-domain space network cooperation by introducing\narchitectures based on near space networks. They can directly service lunar\nsurface users or, via cislunar relays, by forming a resilient and multi-layered\ncommunication backbone. First, we establish a unified link analysis framework\nincorporating frequently disregarded environmental factors, such as the Moon's\nvariable illumination, to provide a high-fidelity performance evaluation.\nSecond, we assess architectures' reliability based on the outage risk,\nessential for quantifying the operational robustness of communication links.\nFinally, to manage the inherent dynamism of architectures, we propose an\ninter-domain space digital twin$-$a dynamic decision-making engine that\nperforms real-time analysis to autonomously select the best communication path,\nensuring high and stable reliability while simultaneously optimizing power\nconsumption.

The performance involves eight people: two XR\nparticipants on stage and six audience members watching a projected documentary\nabout Hema Kumari, an Indian singer living with Rheumatoid Arthritis. The XR\nusers partially obscure the film, drawing attention through strange mouth and\nhand movements performed in XR.

Steel\nsurfaces not only have defects of various sizes and shapes, which limit the\naccuracy of traditional image processing and detection methods in complex\nenvironments. However, traditional defect detection methods face issues of\ninsufficient accuracy and high miss-detection rates when dealing with small\ntarget defects. To address this issue, this study proposes a detection\nframework based on deep learning, specifically YOLOv9s, combined with the\nC3Ghost module, SCConv module, and CARAFE upsampling operator, to improve\ndetection accuracy and model performance. First, the SCConv module is used to\nreduce feature redundancy and optimize feature representation by reconstructing\nthe spatial and channel dimensions. Second, the C3Ghost module is introduced to\nenhance the model's feature extraction ability by reducing redundant\ncomputations and parameter volume, thereby improving model efficiency. Finally,\nthe CARAFE upsampling operator, which can more finely reorganize feature maps\nin a content-aware manner, optimizes the upsampling process and ensures\ndetailed restoration of high-resolution defect regions.

In this context, Ultra-wideband (UWB) radar is capable of penetrating\nthrough such challenging environmental conditions due to the lower frequency\ncomponents within its broad bandwidth. Therefore, UWB radar has emerged as a\npotential sensing technology for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)\nin vision-denied environments where optical sensors (e.g. LiDAR, Camera) are\nprone to failure. Existing approaches involving UWB radar as the primary\nexteroceptive sensor generally extract features in the environment, which are\nlater initialized as landmarks in a map. However, these methods are constrained\nby the number of distinguishable features in the environment. Hence, this paper\nproposes a novel method incorporating UWB Angle of Arrival (AOA) measurements\ninto UWB radar-based SLAM systems to improve the accuracy and scalability of\nSLAM in feature-deficient environments. The AOA measurements are obtained using\nUWB anchor-tag units which are dynamically deployed by the robot in featureless\nareas during mapping of the environment. This paper thoroughly discusses\nprevailing constraints associated with UWB AOA measurement units and presents\nsolutions to overcome them. Our experimental results show that integrating UWB\nAOA units with UWB radar enables SLAM in vision-denied feature-deficient\nenvironments.",

Star forming\nregions and young stars are generally strongly associated to the spiral\nstructure, but there are few quantitative predictions from simulations about\nthe involvement of stars of different ages. Aims. We aim to quantify the\ninterplay between spiral arms and different populations. Methods. We use a\nhydrodynamical simulation of an isolated disc galaxy displaying a dynamic\nmulti-armed spiral structure. Inspired by cosmological structure metrics, we\ndevelop a new method, the local dimension, that robustly delineates arms across\npopulations and through space and time. Results. We find that all stars,\nincluding those as old as 11Gyr, support the arms. The spiral strength\ndecreases with stellar age up to 2Gyr-old stars and remains nearly constant for\nolder stars. However, the scaling between arm strength and age (or velocity\ndispersion) depends on the strength of the global spiral structure at each\ntime. Almost all stars formed in arms remain within them for no more than\n140-180Myr, whereas old stars leave arms about three times faster. Even if the\nyoungest populations dominate in the production of the spiral torques at early\ntimes, all populations contribute equally at later times. Conclusions. Our\nresults highlight the power of the local dimension for studying complex spiral\nstructures and show that all stellar populations in the disc partake in the\narms. Since in our model we see spiral arms in populations with velocity\ndispersions up to 90km/s, which are comparable to those of the Milky Way, we\npredict that old Galactic populations could also exhibit spiral structure.",

    "abstract": "Clustering of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets can give key\ninsights into the biological functions of cells. Therefore, it is not\nsurprising that network-based community detection methods (one of the better\nclustering methods) are increasingly being used for the clustering of scRNA-seq\ndatasets. The main challenge in implementing network-based community detection\nmethods for scRNA-seq datasets is that these methods \\emph{apriori} require the\ntrue number of communities or blocks for estimating the community memberships.\nAlthough there are existing methods for estimating the number of communities,\nthey are not suitable for noisy scRNA-seq datasets. Moreover, we require an\nappropriate method for extracting suitable networks from scRNA-seq datasets.\nFor addressing these issues, we present a two-fold solution: i) a simple\nlikelihood-based approach for extracting stochastic block models (SBMs) out of\nscRNA-seq datasets, ii) a new sequential multiple testing (SMT) method for\nestimating the number of communities in SBMs. We study the theoretical\nproperties of SMT and establish its consistency under moderate sparsity\nconditions. In addition, we compare the numerical performance of the SMT with\nseveral existing methods. We also show that our approach performs competitively\nwell against existing methods for estimating the number of communities on\nbenchmark scRNA-seq datasets. Finally, we use our approach for estimating\nsubgroups of a human retina bipolar single cell dataset.",

The developed system converges in 18 rounds, with an average round time\nof 120 seconds and a per-client memory footprint below 200 MB.

We make two key observations. First, the\narithmetic intensity of MLA is over two orders of magnitude greater than that\nof MHA, shifting it close to a compute-bound regime well-suited for modern\naccelerators like GPUs. Second, by distributing MoE experts across a pool of\naccelerators, their arithmetic intensity can be tuned through batching to match\nthat of the dense layers, creating a more balanced computational profile.\n  These findings reveal a diminishing need for specialized attention hardware.\nThe central challenge for next-generation Transformers is no longer\naccelerating a single memory-bound layer.

This paper addresses these issues by introducing a novel\nmultimodal federated learning-based approach for news recommendation. First, it\nintegrates both textual and visual features of news items using a multimodal\nmodel, enabling a more comprehensive representation of content. Second, it\nemploys a time-aware model that balances users' long-term and short-term\ninterests through multi-head self-attention networks, improving recommendation\naccuracy. Finally, to enhance privacy, a federated learning framework is\nimplemented, enabling collaborative model training without sharing user data.\nThe framework divides the recommendation model into a large server-maintained\nnews model and a lightweight user model shared between the server and clients.\nThe client requests news representations (vectors) and a user model from the\ncentral server, then computes gradients with user local data, and finally sends\ntheir locally computed gradients to the server for aggregation. The central\nserver aggregates gradients to update the global user model and news model. The\nupdated news model is further used to infer news representation by the server.\nTo further safeguard user privacy, a secure aggregation algorithm based on\nShamir's secret sharing is employed.

    "abstract": "In business processes, activity batching refers to packing multiple activity\ninstances for joint execution. Batching allows managers to trade off cost and\nprocessing effort against waiting time. Larger and less frequent batches may\nlower costs by reducing processing effort and amortizing fixed costs, but they\ncreate longer waiting times. In contrast, smaller and more frequent batches\nreduce waiting times but increase fixed costs and processing effort. A batching\npolicy defines how activity instances are grouped into batches and when each\nbatch is activated. This paper addresses the problem of discovering batching\npolicies that strike optimal trade-offs between waiting time, processing\neffort, and cost. The paper proposes a Pareto optimization approach that starts\nfrom a given set (possibly empty) of activity batching policies and generates\nalternative policies for each batched activity via intervention heuristics.\nEach heuristic identifies an opportunity to improve an activity's batching\npolicy with respect to a metric (waiting time, processing time, cost, or\nresource utilization) and an associated adjustment to the activity's batching\npolicy (the intervention). The impact of each intervention is evaluated via\nsimulation. The intervention heuristics are embedded in an optimization\nmeta-heuristic that triggers interventions to iteratively update the Pareto\nfront of the interventions identified so far. The paper considers three\nmeta-heuristics: hill-climbing, simulated annealing, and reinforcement\nlearning. An experimental evaluation compares the proposed approach based on\nintervention heuristics against the same (non-heuristic guided) meta-heuristics\nbaseline regarding convergence, diversity, and cycle time gain of\nPareto-optimal policies.",

    "abstract": "As green hydrogen emerges as a major component of global decarbonisation,\nOman has positioned itself strategically through national auctions and\ninternational partnerships. Following two successful green hydrogen project\nrounds, the country launched its third auction (R3) in the Duqm region. While\nthis area exhibits relative geospatial homogeneity, it is still vulnerable to\nenvironmental fluctuations that pose inherent risks to productivity. Despite\ngrowing global investment in green hydrogen, operational data remains scarce,\nwith major projects like Saudi Arabia's NEOM facility not expected to commence\nproduction until 2026, and Oman's ACME Duqm project scheduled for 2028. This\nabsence of historical maintenance and performance data from large-scale\nhydrogen facilities in desert environments creates a major knowledge gap for\naccurate risk assessment for infrastructure planning and auction decisions.\nGiven this data void, environmental conditions emerge as accessible and\nreliable proxy for predicting infrastructure maintenance pressures, because\nharsh desert conditions such as dust storms, extreme temperatures, and humidity\nfluctuations are well-documented drivers of equipment degradation in renewable\nenergy systems. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an Artificial\nIntelligence decision support system that leverages publicly available\nmeteorological data to develop a predictive Maintenance Pressure Index (MPI),\nwhich predicts risk levels and future maintenance demands on hydrogen\ninfrastructure. This tool strengthens regulatory foresight and operational\ndecision-making by enabling temporal benchmarking to assess and validate\nperformance claims over time.

Recent American publications define Lunar Coordinate Time (LTC)\nwithin relativity and propose a Terrestrial Time (TT) to LTC conversion\nformula. However, this formula's derivation and assumptions are contested. The\ncomplex dynamics within the solar system can be simplified by decomposing\nrelationships into hierarchical wide-area (external problem) and local-area\n(internal problem) levels. Grounded in the symmetry and conservation laws of\nphysics, Einstein's general relativity emphasizes two key principles: (i) Equal\nweighting: Relationships among multi-level coordinate systems are independent\nand self-similar (analogous to fractals). (ii) *Locality*: The laws of physics\nretain invariant forms only in local coordinate systems. Specifically, a\nnon-rotating system corresponds to the Frenet frame along a particle's\ngeodesic. Preserving physical law invariance requires restricting rotating\nreferences strictly to the local domain; defining the orientation of an\nEarth-centered system using distant celestial bodies violates general\nrelativity's locality principle. This work derives the relationship between\ncoordinate time and proper time. Using the Earth-Moon system as an\nintermediary, it obtains a simplified transformation formula between LTC and\nTT. An independent and universal lunar standard time framework is proposed.\nCrucially, the derived coordinate time transformation coefficient exhibits\nlong-term secular variation.

Although experiments have demonstrated that\nelectromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) quantum memories can store\nentangled photons, a definitive theoretical framework verifying the\npreservation of entanglement and nonlocality has not been rigorously\nestablished. Here, we develop a comprehensive model by integrating the\ndark-state polariton framework with reduced-density-operator theory to derive\nthe retrieved density operator under realistic ground-state decoherence\nconditions. Our analysis reveals that decoherence inevitably causes probe\nphoton loss, converting a Bell state into a mixed state. Crucially, we predict\na critical storage efficiency threshold of 89.7%. Only when this threshold is\nexceeded does the retrieved probe photon state violate the Clauser-Horne\ninequality, thereby preserving nonlocality; below this point, nonlocal\ncorrelations vanish. Moreover, our theory shows that multiple spatially\nseparated EIT memories can cooperatively store and retrieve N-qubit entangled\nstates encoded in photon number, path, and polarization with near-unity\nfidelity in the ideal limit.

In this work, we explore the\ninfluence of Co on the microstructure evolution, thermophysical/mechanical\nproperties and gamma prime precipitate coarsening kinetics in a Ti-rich\nNi-Co-Cr-Al-Ti based alloy. More specifically, we focus on the effect of\npartitioning of Co into the gamma matrix on the redistribution of other solutes\nacross the interface. We observe a significant increase in the coarsening\nresistance and a twofold increase in the activation energy with the increase in\nthe Co composition from 10at.%Co to 30at.%Co, even though the gamma prime\nsolvus reduces by 75C. As otherwise, a higher solvus, usually, indicates better\nmicrostructural stability at high temperatures. We employed a combined\nexperimental and theoretical approach by atom probe tomography (APT) and\nCALPHAD simulations to probe the critical role of Co partitioning to gamma\nmatrix on the solute transport in the gamma matrix and flux across the\ngamma/gamma prime interfaces, which is found to control the overall gamma prime\ncoarsening behavior in the alloy. The observed behavior was rationlised by the\nproposition of a simplistic unified coarsening rate expression that\nsuccessfully decouples thermodynamic and kinetic contributions. Additionally,\nwe also observe that the gamma prime volume fraction dominates over the gamma\nprime precipitate size on the 0.2% yield strength (YS) of the alloys.",

An eavesdropper (Eve) can\nexploit LDA to irreversibly alter the optical components on Alice's side,\neffectively increasing the mean-photon numbers beyond the decoy-state security\nregime.

Numerical simulations confirm that for sufficiently elevated\nmean-photon numbers, Eve's conclusive measurement outcomes skew the decoy-state\nstatistics, yet remain undetected by standard security checks. We further\ndemonstrate how a modified USD setup employing an additional beam splitter can\nreduce the required threshold, facilitating Eve's attack.

    "abstract": "Autonomous quadrotor flight in confined spaces such as pipes and tunnels\npresents significant challenges due to unsteady, self-induced aerodynamic\ndisturbances. Very recent advances have enabled flight in such conditions, but\nthey either rely on constant motion through the pipe to mitigate airflow\nrecirculation effects or suffer from limited stability during hovering. In this\nwork, we present the first closed-loop control system for quadrotors for\nhovering in narrow pipes that leverages real-time flow field measurements. We\ndevelop a low-latency, event-based smoke velocimetry method that estimates\nlocal airflow at high temporal resolution. This flow information is used by a\ndisturbance estimator based on a recurrent convolutional neural network, which\ninfers force and torque disturbances in real time. The estimated disturbances\nare integrated into a learning-based controller trained via reinforcement\nlearning. The flow-feedback control proves particularly effective during\nlateral translation maneuvers in the pipe cross-section. There, the real-time\ndisturbance information enables the controller to effectively counteract\ntransient aerodynamic effects, thereby preventing collisions with the pipe\nwall. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first\ndemonstration of an aerial robot with closed-loop control informed by real-time\nflow field measurements. This opens new directions for research on flight in\naerodynamically complex environments. In addition, our work also sheds light on\nthe characteristic flow structures that emerge during flight in narrow,\ncircular pipes, providing new insights at the intersection of robotics and\nfluid dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Biological systems rely on ions and molecules as information carriers rather\nthan electrons, motivating the development of devices that interface with\nbiochemical systems for sensing, information processing, and actuation via\nspatiotemporal control of ions and molecules. Iontronics aims to achieve this\nvision by constructing devices composed of ion-conducting materials such as\npolyelectrolyte hydrogels, but advancing beyond simple single-stage circuit\nconfigurations that operate under steady-state conditions is a challenge. Here,\nwe propose and model more complex ionic circuits, namely bistable flip-flop and\nring oscillators, consisting of multiple ionic bipolar junction transistors\n(IBJTs). We begin by modeling and characterizing single IBJTs using both a\nsimplified one-dimensional Nernst-Planck model and a more-detailed\ntwo-dimensional Poisson-Nernst-Planck model, elucidating the effects of\ngeometry, size, and fixed charge on the IBJT performance and response time. The\none- and two-dimensional models exhibit good agreement, indicating negligible\ntransverse inhomogeneities. Additionally, these models show that reducing the\nbase width improves current amplification, a behavior analogous to electronic\nBJTs. Building on this understanding, by using the IBJTs as voltage inverters\nand buffers, we design and model more complex ionic circuits that dynamically\nchange their states in response to ionic signals. Specifically, we demonstrate\nthat the ionic flip-flop retains one-bit memory and that the ring oscillator\nachieves autonomous periodic self-oscillation without an external clock.

However, under\nambiguous conditions, cheating magnitude is significantly higher when machines\nverify participants' reports, reducing the prevalence of partial cheating while\nleading to behavioral polarization manifested as either complete honesty or\nmaximal overreporting. The same applies when comparing reports to a machine\nentity under ambiguous and transparent verification rules. These findings\nemphasize the behavioral implications of algorithmic opacity in verification\ncontexts.

Here we\ntackle the problem via a semi-empirical approach with minimal assumptions and\ndata-driven inputs. This is firmly grounded on a continuity plus Smoluchowski\nequation framework that allows to unitarily describe the two primary modes of\nBH growth: gas accretion and binary mergers. Key quantities related to the\nlatter processes are incorporated through educated parameterizations, and then\nconstrained in a Bayesian setup from joint observational estimates of the local\nBH mass function, of the large-scale BH clustering, and of the nano-Hz\nstochastic gravitational wave (GW) background measured from Pulsar Timimg Array\n(PTA) experiments. We find that the BH accretion-related parameters are\nstrongly dependent on the local BH mass function determination: higher\nnormalizations and flatter high-mass slopes in the latter imply lower radiative\nefficiencies and mean Eddington ratios with a stronger redshift evolution.\nAdditionally, the binary BH merger rate is estimated to be a fraction $\\lesssim\n10^{-1}$ of the galaxy merger rate derived from galaxy pairs counts by JWST,\nand constrained not to exceed the latter at $\\gtrsim 2\\sigma$. Relatedly, we\nhighlight hints of a possible tension between current constraints on BH\ndemographics and the interpretation of the nano-Hz GW background as\npredominantly caused by binary BH mergers. Specifically, we bound the latter's\ncontribution to $\\lesssim 30-50\\%$ at $\\sim 3\\sigma$, suggesting that either\nsystematics in the datasets considered here have been underestimated so far, or\nthat additional astrophysical/cosmological sources are needed to explain the\nresidual part of the signal measured by PTA experiments.",

The Transformer, as a flow map,\nexists in the tangent fiber for each token along the high-dimensional unit\nsphere. The circumstance of the hypersphere across the latent data is\nreasonable due to the trained diagonal matrix equal to the identity, which has\nvarious empirical justifications. Thus, under the continuum limit of the\ndynamics, the latent vectors flow among the tangent bundle. Using these facts,\nwe devise a mathematical framework for the Transformer through calculus of\nvariations. We develop a functional and show that the continuous flow map\ninduced by the Transformer satisfies this functional, therefore the Transformer\ncan be viewed as a natural solver of a calculus of variations problem. We\ninvent new scenarios of when our methods are applicable based on loss\noptimization with respect to path optimality. We derive the Euler-Lagrange\nequation for the Transformer.

Calculated exciton binding energies for these compounds are\nrelatively small (30-32 meV), signifying easy separation of the electron-hole\npairs, and hence enhanced power conversion efficiencies. Investigations of\nphotoexcited carrier dynamics reveal a relatively long carrier lifetime (~\n30-40 ns), suggesting suppressed nonradiative recombination and enhanced\nphoto-conversion efficiencies. We further determined the defect formation\nenergies in these compounds, which showed that despite the likely formation of\ncation vacancies and interstitial defects, midgap states remain absent making\nthese defects non-detrimental to carrier recombination. Our theoretical\npredictions invite experimental verification and encourage further\ninvestigations of these and similar compounds in this quaternary semiconductor\nfamily.",

However, applying these models to real-world mobile scenarios\nremains a significant challenge due to the long-horizon task execution,\ndifficulty in error recovery, and the cold-start problem in unfamiliar\nenvironments. To address these challenges, we propose MobileUse, a GUI agent\ndesigned for robust and adaptive mobile task execution. To improve resilience\nin long-horizon tasks and dynamic environments, we introduce a hierarchical\nreflection architecture that enables the agent to self-monitor, detect, and\nrecover from errors across multiple temporal scales-ranging from individual\nactions to overall task completion-while maintaining efficiency through a\nreflection-on-demand strategy. To tackle cold-start issues, we further\nintroduce a proactive exploration module, which enriches the agent's\nunderstanding of the environment through self-planned exploration. Evaluations\non AndroidWorld and AndroidLab benchmarks demonstrate that MobileUse\nestablishes new state-of-the-art performance, achieving success rates of 62.9%\nand 44.2%, respectively.

The anomalous charge\ndensity wave is characterized by three key features: (i) Unlike conventional\ncharge density wave, whose stabilization is driven by the opening of a gap near\nthe Fermi level, the anomalous charge density wave is stabilized by the\noccupied states with energies shifting lower far away from the Fermi level;\n(ii) the anomalous charge density wave increases the density of states near the\nFermi level and then enhances-rather than diminishes-the metallicity of\nmaterials; (iii) altermagnetism plays a crucial role in stabilizing anomalous\ncharge density wave.

In a MN, some small cell base stations\n(BS) are installed on top of vehicles, and enable a more dynamic, flexible and\nsustainable, network operation. By \"following\" the users movements and adapting\ndynamically to their requests, the MN paradigm enables a more efficient\nutilization of network resources, mitigating the need for dense small cell BS\ndeployments at the cost of an increase in resource utilization due to wireless\nbackhauling. This aspect is at least partly compensated by the shorter distance\nbetween users and BS, which allows for lower power and Line-of-Sight\ncommunications. While the MN paradigm has been investigated for some time, to\ndate, it is still unclear in which conditions the advantages of MN outweigh the\nadditional resource costs. In this paper, we propose a stochastic geometry\nframework for the characterization of the potential benefits of the MN paradigm\nas part of an HetNet in urban settings. Our approach allows the estimation of\nuser-perceived performance, accounting for wireless backhaul connectivity as\nwell as base station resource scheduling. We formulate an optimization problem\nfor determining the resource-optimal network configurations and BS scheduling\nwhich minimize the overall amount of deployed BSs in a QoS-aware manner, and\nthe minimum vehicular flow between different urban districts required to\nsupport them, and we propose an efficient stochastic heuristic to solve it.

For more complex data sharing scenarios,\nwhere consent might not be sufficient, many parties rely on contracts. Before a\ncontract is signed, it must undergo the process of contract negotiation within\nthe contract lifecycle, which consists of negotiating the obligations\nassociated with the contract. Contract compliance verification (CCV) provides a\nmeans to verify whether a contract is GDPR-compliant, i.e., adheres to legal\nobligations and there are no violations. The rise of knowledge graph (KG)\nadoption, enabling semantic interoperability using well-defined semantics,\nallows CCV to be applied on KGs. In the scenario of different participants\nnegotiating obligations, there is a need for data consistency to ensure that\nCCV is done correctly. Recent work introduced the automated contracting tool\n(ACT), a KG-based and ODRL-employing tool for GDPR CCV, which was developed in\nthe Horizon 2020 project smashHit (https://smashhit.eu). Although the tool\nreports violations with respect to obligations, it had limitations in verifying\nand ensuring compliance, as it did not use an interoperable semantic formalism,\nsuch as SHACL, and did not support users in resolving data inconsistencies. In\nthis work, we propose a novel approach to overcome these limitations of ACT. We\nsemi-automatically resolve CCV inconsistencies by providing repair strategies,\nwhich automatically propose (optimal) solutions to the user to re-establish\ndata consistency and thereby support them in managing GDPR-compliant contract\nlifecycle data.

To address these\nlimitations, we propose a sufficiency-principled transfer learning framework\nvia unified model averaging algorithms, accommodating both individual and\ncombinatorial similarities. Theoretically, we establish the\nasymptotic/high-probability optimality, enhanced convergence rate and\nasymptotic normality for multi-source linear regression models with a diverging\nnumber of parameters, achieving sufficiency, robustness to negative transfer,\nprivacy protection and feasible statistical inference.

    "abstract": "Since Charles Darwin's time, the study of climbing plants on a cylindrical\nstake has been the subject of numerous articles in plant biology. One of the\nmain ideas for studying the coiling of an elastic plant stem is to consider the\ngrowth of the plant stem in terms of evolution over time. However, as this\ndevelopment takes place over a long time scale, the static study alone has not\nbeen studied independently. Our static approach requires us to take into\naccount elasticity, turgor pressure and gravity forces in a first analysis. The\naim of this article is to present a simplified model demonstrating why plant\nstems climb mainly on their circular helix-shaped stakes, with the diameter of\nthe stake playing an important role in plant stem ascent, as does the fineness\nof the stem. To perform this calculation, for a given mass density, we consider\nthe variational principle of minimum energy. For thin plant stems, we can see,\nin first approximation, that the effect of gravity and turgor pressure can be\nneglected with respect to the energy of elasticity, and that the bulk of the\ncalculation concerns elasticity terms.",

Specifically, a\nprobabilistic fractal sampling technique is proposed to generate a sufficient\nnumber of queries to trigger the incredible responses in parallel, efficiently\nidentifying the generalization bound of the target agent.

Various scientific and engineering applications demand a\nversatile and differentiable PDE solver that can quickly generate solutions\nwith adequate accuracy, and limitations of the traditional solvers and\nspecialized neural operators motivate the development of foundation models for\nsolving PDEs. This paper introduces PDEformer-2, a versatile foundation model\nfor two-dimensional PDEs.

A large (40TB) diverse dataset is employed to\npretrain the current model, making it capable of simultaneously addressing PDEs\nwith different symbolic forms, domain shapes, boundary conditions, number of\nvariables, and time-dependency. Accurate zero-shot prediction is allowed for\nPDEs that resemble the pretraining ones. When adapted to new unseen PDEs,\nPDEformer-2 demonstrates faster learning than many specialized models, and has\nsmaller errors given limited (less than 100) samples. Additionally, PDEformer-2\ncan be employed in the inverse problems thanks to its fast and differentiable\nnature and produces reasonable results in our experiments to recover\ncoefficient scalars and fields of a PDE.",

    "abstract": "Facial expression recognition (FER) is a challenging task due to pervasive\nocclusion and dataset biases. Especially when facial information is partially\noccluded, existing FER models struggle to extract effective facial features,\nleading to inaccurate classifications. In response, we present ORSANet, which\nintroduces the following three key contributions: First, we introduce auxiliary\nmulti-modal semantic guidance to disambiguate facial occlusion and learn\nhigh-level semantic knowledge, which is two-fold: 1) we introduce semantic\nsegmentation maps as dense semantics prior to generate semantics-enhanced\nfacial representations; 2) we introduce facial landmarks as sparse geometric\nprior to mitigate intrinsic noises in FER, such as identity and gender biases.\nSecond, to facilitate the effective incorporation of these two multi-modal\npriors, we customize a Multi-scale Cross-interaction Module (MCM) to adaptively\nfuse the landmark feature and semantics-enhanced representations within\ndifferent scales. Third, we design a Dynamic Adversarial Repulsion Enhancement\nLoss (DARELoss) that dynamically adjusts the margins of ambiguous classes,\nfurther enhancing the model's ability to distinguish similar expressions. We\nfurther construct the first occlusion-oriented FER dataset to facilitate\nspecialized robustness analysis on various real-world occlusion conditions,\ndubbed Occlu-FER. Extensive experiments on both public benchmarks and Occlu-FER\ndemonstrate that our proposed ORSANet achieves SOTA recognition performance.\nCode is publicly available at https://github.com/Wenyuzhy/ORSANet-master.",

Recently, it was shown that transition metals, such as Titanium,\nexhibit enhanced photoacoustic transduction properties compared to noble\nmetals, such as Silver. This work presents experimental results and simulations\nthat demonstrate that among transition metals Tantalum exhibits superior\nphotoacoustic properties. Experiments of nano-acoustic strain generation by\nfemtosecond laser pulses focused on thin Tantalum films deposited on Silicon\nsubstrates are presented. The nano-acoustic strains are measured via pump-probe\ntransient reflectivity that captures the Brillouin oscillations produced by\nphoton-phonon interactions. The observed Brillouin oscillations are correlated\nto the photoacoustic transduction efficiency of the Tantalum thin film and\ncompared to the performance of Titanium thin films, clearly demonstrating the\nsuperior photoacoustic transduction efficiency of Tantalum. The findings are\nsupported by computational results on the laser-induced strains and their\npropagation in these thin metal film/substrate systems using a Two-Temperature\nModel in combination with thermo-mechanical Finite Element Analysis. Finally,\nthe role of the metal transducer-substrate acoustic impedance matching is\ndiscussed and the possibility to generate appropriately modulated acoustic\npulse trains inside the crystalline substrate structures for the development of\ncrystalline undulators used for {\\gamma}-ray generation is presented.",

    "abstract": "In real-world recommendation scenarios, users typically engage with platforms\nthrough multiple types of behavioral interactions. Multi-behavior\nrecommendation algorithms aim to leverage various auxiliary user behaviors to\nenhance prediction for target behaviors of primary interest (e.g., buy),\nthereby overcoming performance limitations caused by data sparsity in target\nbehavior records. Current state-of-the-art approaches typically employ\nhierarchical design following either cascading (e.g.,\nview$\\rightarrow$cart$\\rightarrow$buy) or parallel\n(unified$\\rightarrow$behavior$\\rightarrow$specific components) paradigms, to\ncapture behavioral relationships. However, these methods still face two\ncritical challenges: (1) severe distribution disparities across behaviors, and\n(2) negative transfer effects caused by noise in auxiliary behaviors. In this\npaper, we propose a novel model-agnostic Hierarchical Graph Information\nBottleneck (HGIB) framework for multi-behavior recommendation to effectively\naddress these challenges. Following information bottleneck principles, our\nframework optimizes the learning of compact yet sufficient representations that\npreserve essential information for target behavior prediction while eliminating\ntask-irrelevant redundancies. To further mitigate interaction noise, we\nintroduce a Graph Refinement Encoder (GRE) that dynamically prunes redundant\nedges through learnable edge dropout mechanisms. We conduct comprehensive\nexperiments on three real-world public datasets, which demonstrate the superior\neffectiveness of our framework. Beyond these widely used datasets in the\nacademic community, we further expand our evaluation on several real industrial\nscenarios and conduct an online A/B testing, showing again a significant\nimprovement in multi-behavior recommendations.

Their ever-evolving nature renders traditional\nrule-based and feature-engineered detectors ineffective in the ongoing arms\nrace between attackers and defenders. The rise of large language models (LLMs)\nfurther exacerbates the threat, enabling attackers to craft highly convincing\nphishing emails at minimal cost.\n  This work demonstrates that LLMs can generate psychologically persuasive\nphishing emails tailored to victim profiles, successfully bypassing nearly all\ncommercial and academic detectors. To defend against such threats, we propose\nPiMRef, the first reference-based phishing email detector that leverages\nknowledge-based invariants. Our core insight is that persuasive phishing emails\noften contain disprovable identity claims, which contradict real-world facts.\nPiMRef reframes phishing detection as an identity fact-checking task. Given an\nemail, PiMRef (i) extracts the sender's claimed identity, (ii) verifies the\nlegitimacy of the sender's domain against a predefined knowledge base, and\n(iii) detects call-to-action prompts that push user engagement. Contradictory\nclaims are flagged as phishing indicators and serve as human-understandable\nexplanations.\n  Compared to existing methods such as D-Fence, HelpHed, and ChatSpamDetector,\nPiMRef boosts precision by 8.8% with no loss in recall on standard benchmarks\nlike Nazario and PhishPot.

While it is possible to calculate a Monte\nCarlo based solution for the 2-step methods since they neglect lateral spatial\ncorrelations, a direct-3D Monte Carlo inversion proved too high-dimensional to\nachieve statistical convergence. We therefore created a new variational method\nwhich can solve the direct-3D tomographic problem efficiently.

We repeated the tests using a 3D\nsynthetic velocity model consisting of a checkerboard of lower and higher shear\nvelocities. The direct-3D and one of the two-step methods used the same order\nof computations to achieve apparently acceptable subsurface images. However,\nthe direct-3D scheme preserved better lateral continuity, and produced\nsynthetic data simulations that align more closely with observed data than\nthose from the two-step inversions, thus demonstrating higher inversion\naccuracy.

In addition to the\nwell-accepted extensor medial and interosseous lateral bands of the extensor\nmechanism, there exist two layers of intercrossing fiber bundles (superficial\ninterosseous medial fiber layer and deeper extensor lateral fiber layer),\nconnecting them. In contrast to its common idealization as a minimal network of\ndistinct strings, we built a numerical model consisting of fiber bundles to\nevaluate the role of multiple intercrossing fiber bundles in the production of\nstatic finger forces. We compared this more detailed model of the extensor\nmechanism to the idealized minimal network that only includes the extensor\nmedial and interosseous lateral bands. We find that including bundles of\nintercrossing fiber bundles significantly affects force transmission, which\nitself depends on finger posture. We conclude that the intercrossing fiber\nbundles - traditionally left out in prior models since Zancolli's\nsimplification - play an important role in force transmission and variation of\nthe latter with posture.",

However, existing methods like\nGeographical or Beam Space Gridization (GSG or BSG) are limited by reliance on\nunavailable location data or the flawed assumption that similar signal\nstrengths imply similar channel properties. We propose Channel Space\nGridization (CSG), a pioneering framework that unifies channel estimation and\ngridization for the first time. Formulated as a joint optimization problem, CSG\nuses only beam-level reference signal received power (RSRP) to estimate Channel\nAngle Power Spectra (CAPS) and partition samples into grids with homogeneous\nchannel characteristics. To perform CSG, we develop the CSG Autoencoder\n(CSG-AE), featuring a trainable RSRP-to-CAPS encoder, a learnable sparse\ncodebook quantizer, and a physics-informed decoder based on the Localized\nStatistical Channel Model. On recognizing the limitations of naive training\nscheme, we propose a novel Pretraining-Initialization-Detached-Asynchronous\n(PIDA) training scheme for CSG-AE, ensuring stable and effective training by\nsystematically addressing the common pitfalls of the naive training paradigm.\nEvaluations reveal that CSG-AE excels in CAPS estimation accuracy and\nclustering quality on synthetic data.

Here, we unravel the\nfundamental physics governing the splitting of a single filament in a model\ngeometry by combining numerical simulations, laboratory experiments and theory.\nWe show that the splitting of a single filament generates a power-law bubble\nsize distribution following $d^{-3/2}$ with $d$ the volume equivalent bubble\ndiameter, suggesting the existence of a self-similar breakup mechanism, absent\nin liquid ligament fragmentation. We propose a deterministic model, based on\nthe capillary fragmentation of a filament with power-law shape, which\nquantitatively captures the bubble size distribution. We demonstrate that the\nfilament shape at breakup sets the size distribution of a first generation of\nbubbles. This distribution is then reproduced at smaller and smaller scales by\nlatter breakups in a self-similar manner. The $d^{-3/2}$-distribution coincides\nwith the size distribution of small bubbles observed in dilute turbulent flow,\nsuch as below breaking waves. We argue that the turbulent bubble size\ndistribution observed in nature arises as the superposition of many individual\nfilament splittings.

In recent years, mobile energy storage systems (ESSs) have\nemerged as a popular flexible resource for mitigating these challenges.\nCompared to stationary ESSs, mobile ESSs offer additional spatial flexibility,\nenabling cost-effective energy delivery through the transportation network.\nHowever, the widespread deployment of mobile ESSs is often hindered by the high\ninvestment cost, which has motivated researchers to investigate utilising more\nreadily available alternatives, such as electric vehicles (EVs) as mobile\nenergy storage units instead. Hence, we explore this opportunity with a\nMIP-based day-ahead electric vehicle joint routing and scheduling problem in\nthis work. However, solving the problem in a practical setting can often be\ncomputationally intractable since the existence of binary variables makes it\ncombinatorial challenging. Therefore, we proposed to simplify the problem's\nsolution process for a MIP solver by pruning the solution search space with a\ntransformer-based deep learning (DL) model. This is done by training the model\nto rapidly predict the optimal binary solutions. In addition, unlike many\nexisting DL approaches that assume fixed problem structures, the proposed model\nis designed to accommodate problems with EV fleets of any sizes.

    "abstract": "The voting systems known as Alternative Vote (AV) and Single Transferable\nVote (STV) are extensively used for elections in Australia, possibly more than\nin any other jurisdiction. Often proposed as superior alternatives to Plurality\nand other common systems, they are also criticised by theoreticians for their\nvulnerability to paradoxical outcomes. It is argued these 'transferable voting'\nsystems in fact operate to balance competing desiderata that attempt to distil\nthe common notions of 'majority rule' and 'voter choice'. Among positive\ncharacteristics of AV is that its outcome is always a majority runoff between\ntwo candidates with substantial voter support, and that a Condorcet winner who\ngains at least one-third of votes is always elected. It is shown that in\nsituations where a Condorcet winner is not elected, there always exists a\nmonotonic shift producing a Condorcet cycle without changing the election\noutcome. A detailed analysis of non-monotonicity paradoxes in three-way\ncontests is provided, aided by a two-dimensional spatial model where each\ncandidate has a one-in-four probability of gaining an absolute majority of\nprimary votes while there is a similar one-in-four probability that no\ncandidate wins a majority. On such a model it is shown non-monotonicities are\nlatent in less than 3.5% of election scenarios (and conjectured to be less than\n3%), and the close link between non-monotonicities and Condorcet cycles and\ninstabilities is studied in more detail. Properties of multi-winner STV are\nalso reviewed including a demonstration of the standard fact that STV becomes\nsimilar to a form of largest-remainder list voting in the special case where\nballots are cast strictly by party allegiance. The argument that AV and STV\nexemplify the principle of voter choice while balancing absolute and relative\nconcepts of majority-rule is made by reference to practice in Australian\nelections.",

These new problems, closely related to the Matrix Code Equivalence\nproblem, ask to find an isometry given a code $C$ and a subcode $D$.\nFurthermore, we prove that the Matrix Subcode Equivalence problem reduces to\nthe Hamming Subcode Equivalence problem, which is known to be NP-Complete, thus\nintroducing the matrix code version of the Permuted Kernel Problem. We also\nadapt the combinatorial and algebraic algorithms for the Matrix Code\nEquivalence problem to the subcode case, and we analyze their complexities. We\nfind with this analysis that the algorithms perform much worse than in the code\nequivalence case, which is the same as what happens in the Hamming metric.\nFinally, our analysis of the attacks allows us to take parameters much smaller\nthan in the Matrix Code Equivalence case. Coupled with the effectiveness of\n\\textit{Threshold-Computation-in-the-Head} or \\textit{VOLE-in-the-Head}, we\nobtain a signature size of $\\approx$ 4 800 Bytes, with a public key of\n$\\approx$ 275 Bytes. We thus obtain a reasonable signature size, which brings\ndiversity in the landscape of post-quantum signature schemes, by relying on a\nnew hard problem. In particular, this new signature scheme performs better than\nSPHINCS+, with a smaller size of public key + signature. Our signature compares\nalso well with other signature schemes: compared to MEDS, the signature is\nsmaller, and we reduced the size of the sum of signature and public key by a\nfactor close to 5. We also obtain a signature size that is almost half the size\nof the CROSS signature scheme.",

    "abstract": "Optical fiber sensing plays a crucial role in modern measurement systems and\nholds significant promise for a wide range of applications. This potential,\nthough, has been fundamentally constrained by the intrinsic latency and power\nlimitations associated with electronic signal processing. Here, we propose an\nall-optical fiber sensing architecture with in-sensor computing (AOFS-IC) that\nachieves fully optical-domain sensing signal demodulation at the speed of\nlight. By integrating a scattering medium with an optimized diffractive optical\nnetwork, AOFS-IC enables linear mapping of physical perturbations to detected\nintensity, and sensing results can be directly read out without electronic\nprocessing. The proposed system maintains high accuracy across various sensing\ntasks, providing sub-nano strain resolution and 100% torsional angle\nclassification accuracy, as well as multiplexed sensing of multiple physical\nquantities, and performing multi-degree-of-freedom robot arm monitoring.\nAOFS-IC eliminates computing hardware requirements while providing <3 ns\ndemodulation delay, which is more than 2 orders of magnitude faster than\nconventional fiber optic sensing systems. This work demonstrates the potential\nof next-generation optical sensing systems empowered by all-optical computing,\nand paves the way for expanded applications of fiber sensing through the\nintegration of fully optical components, ultrafast measurement speed, and low\npower consumption.",

    "abstract": "Spoken Language Models (SLMs) are designed to take speech inputs and produce\nspoken responses. However, current SLMs lack the ability to perform an\ninternal, unspoken thinking process before responding. In contrast, humans\ntypically engage in complex mental reasoning internally, enabling them to\ncommunicate ideas clearly and concisely. Thus, integrating an unspoken thought\nprocess into SLMs is highly desirable. While naively generating a complete\nchain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning before starting to talk can enable thinking\nfor SLMs, this induces additional latency for the speech response, as the CoT\nreasoning can be arbitrarily long. To solve this issue, we propose Stitch, a\nnovel generation method that alternates between the generation of unspoken\nreasoning chunks and spoken response chunks. Since the audio duration of a\nchunk of spoken response is much longer than the time to generate the tokens in\na chunk of spoken response, we use the remaining free time to generate the\nunspoken reasoning tokens. When a chunk of audio is played to the user, the\nmodel continues to generate the next unspoken reasoning chunk, achieving\nsimultaneous thinking and talking. Remarkably, Stitch matches the latency of\nbaselines that cannot generate unspoken CoT by design while outperforming those\nbaselines by 15% on math reasoning datasets; Stitch also performs equally well\non non-reasoning datasets as those baseline models.

Hawkes processes form a\nclass of selfexciting simple point processes.

For this class, the igniting baseline intensity is\ntime dependent and the exciting matrix function is a general one, making the\nmodel non-Markovian in most of the cases. In this article, we first provide the\nclosed-form expression of the multivariate multi-temporal characteristic\nfunction of these Hawkes processes, extending in a natural way the classical\nsingle-time formula found in the Hawkes literature. Then, we use the infinitely\ndivisible property of the Hawkes process to derive the equation system related\nto the probability distribution of counts at each single time, adapted to the\ngeneral formulation of the Hawkes model considered in this article. Next, we\nprovide closed-form formulas for the temporal structure of the two first\nmoments of the process, which allows us to deduce an original expression of the\nmultivariate covariance function at two distinct times, thereby extending\nexisting results established for more restricted classes of Hawkes processes.\nBased on this expression, we analytically decompose the covariance at two\ndistinct times into singular and continuous parts. We finish with brief\nnumerical elements: We present a simple scheme for numerical approximations of\nthe Laplace transform and the first two moments, and give examples of solutions\nof the different related integral equations.

The most frequent genetic cause of aldosterone-producing adenomas\nis somatic mutations in the potassium channel KCNJ5. They affect the ion\nselectivity of the channel, with sodium influx leading to cell membrane\ndepolarization and activation of calcium signaling, the major trigger for\naldosterone biosynthesis. METHODS: To investigate how KCNJ5 mutations lead to\nthe development of aldosterone-producing adenomas, we established an\nadrenocortical cell model in which sodium entry into the cells can be modulated\non demand using chemogenetic tools [H295R-S2 $\\alpha$7-5HT3-R ($\\alpha$7-5HT3\nreceptor) cells]. We investigated their functional and molecular\ncharacteristics with regard to aldosterone biosynthesis and cell proliferation.\nRESULTS: A clonal cell line with stable expression of the chimeric\n$\\alpha$7-5HT3-R in H295R-S2 (human adrenocortical carcinoma cell line, Strain\n2) cells was obtained. Increased sodium entry through $\\alpha$7-5HT3-R upon\nstimulation with uPSEM-817 (uPharmacologically Selective Effector Molecule-817)\nled to cell membrane depolarization, opening of voltage-gated Ca 2+ channels,\nand increased intracellular Ca 2+ concentrations, resulting in the stimulation\nof CYP11B2 expression and increased aldosterone biosynthesis. Increased\nintracellular sodium influx did not increase proliferation but rather induced\napoptosis. RNA sequencing and steroidome analyses revealed unique profiles\nassociated with Na + entry, with only partial overlap with Ang II (angiotensin\nII) or potassium-induced changes. CONCLUSIONS: H295R-S2 $\\alpha$7-5HT3-R cells\nare a new model reproducing the major features of cells harboring KCNJ5\nmutations. Increased expression of CYP11B2 and stimulation of the\nmineralocorticoid biosynthesis pathway are associated with a decrease of cell\nproliferation and an increase of apoptosis, indicating that additional events\nmay be required for the development of aldosterone-producing adenomas.",

Notably, two LPTs with\nconfirmed multi-wavelength counterparts have been identified as synchronised\nwhite dwarf-M dwarf binaries (polars). Meanwhile, systems such as AR Scorpii\nand J1912-44 exhibit short-period pulsations in a hr-tight orbit, with\npolarized radio emission proposed to be generated by the interaction of the WD\nmagnetosphere with the low-mass companion wind.\n  Here we demonstrate that both LPTs and WD binary pulsars can be explained\nwithin a single geometric model in which radio emission is triggered when the\nmagnetic pole of a rotating white dwarf intersects its companion's wind in the\nbinary orbital plane. We use a 36-year timing baseline to infer the orbital\nperiod and binary geometry solely from radio data of GPM J1839-10, the\nlongest-active LPT known. The model naturally predicts its intermittent\nemission and double-pulse structure. Crucially, we show that the beat period\nbetween the spin and the orbit matches the observed pulse substructure and\npolarisation signatures, providing strong support for the model. Applying this\nmodel to the WD binary pulsar J1912-44, it can also reproduce the system\nemission and geometry.

However, conventional MARL-based ride-sharing\napproaches heavily rely on the accurate estimation of Q-values or V-values,\nwhich becomes problematic in large-scale, highly uncertain environments.\nSpecifically, most of these approaches adopt an independent paradigm,\nexacerbating this issue, as each agent treats others as part of the\nenvironment, leading to unstable training and substantial estimation bias in\nvalue functions. To address these challenges, we propose two novel alternative\nmethods that bypass value function estimation. First, we adapt GRPO to\nride-sharing, replacing the PPO baseline with the group average reward to\neliminate critic estimation errors and reduce training bias. Second, inspired\nby GRPO's full utilization of group reward information, we customize the PPO\nframework for ride-sharing platforms and show that, under a homogeneous fleet,\nthe optimal policy can be trained using only one-step rewards - a method we\nterm One-Step Policy Optimization (OSPO).

The resulting models show a >68% reduction in\nadversarial attack success rates. The global model also demonstrates superior\ncross-domain generalization, outperforming models trained in isolation on their\nown specialized data.",

One such intrinsic limitation is its inability to\neffectively capture the Chomsky hierarchy, such as regular expressions or\ndeterministic context-free grammars. Drawing inspiration from pushdown\nautomata, which efficiently resolve deterministic context-free grammars using\nstacks, we propose StackTrans to address the aforementioned issue within LLMs.\nUnlike previous approaches that modify the attention computation, StackTrans\nexplicitly incorporates hidden state stacks between Transformer layers. This\ndesign maintains compatibility with existing frameworks like flash-attention.\nSpecifically, our design features stack operations -- such as pushing and\npopping hidden states -- that are differentiable and can be learned in an\nend-to-end manner. Our comprehensive evaluation spans benchmarks for both\nChomsky hierarchies and large-scale natural languages. Across these diverse\ntasks, StackTrans consistently outperforms standard Transformer models and\nother baselines. We have successfully scaled StackTrans up from 360M to 7B\nparameters.

Material and\nMethods: We analyzed 22,107 two-arm parallel interventional clinical trials\nfrom ClinicalTrials.gov with structured summary results. Two prediction models\nwere developed: a classifier predicting whether a greater proportion of\nparticipants in an experimental arm would have SAEs (area under the receiver\noperating characteristic curve; AUC) compared to the control arm, and a\nregression model to predict the proportion of participants with SAEs in the\ncontrol arms (root mean squared error; RMSE).

To\nmaintain semantic representation in long trial texts exceeding localized\nlanguage model input limits, a sliding window method was developed for\nembedding extraction.

    "abstract": "When evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) in question-answering domains,\nit is common to ask the model to choose among a fixed set of choices (so-called\nmultiple-choice question-answering, or MCQA). Although downstream tasks of\ninterest typically do not provide systems with explicit options among which to\nchoose, this approach is nevertheless widely used because it makes it makes\nautomatic grading straightforward and has tended to produce challenging\nbenchmarks that correlate sufficiently well with downstream performance. This\npaper investigates the extent to which this trend continues to hold for\nstate-of-the-art reasoning models, describing a systematic evaluation of $15$\ndifferent question-answering benchmarks (e.g., MMLU, HLE) and $25$ different\nLLMs (including small models such as Qwen 7B and relatively large models such\nas Llama 70B). For each model-benchmark pair, we considered $5$ ways of\npresenting the model with questions, including variations on whether multiple\nchoices were offered to the model at all; whether \"none of the above\" sometimes\nreplaced the right answer; and whether the model was permitted to perform\nchain-of-thought reasoning before and/or after the choices were presented. MCQA\nremained a good proxy for the downstream performance of models as long as they\nwere allowed to perform chain-of-thought reasoning only before being presented\nwith the options among which they had to select. On the other hand, large\nmodels that were able to perform reasoning after being given a set of options\ntended to significantly outperform their free-text performance due to\nexploiting the information in the options. We conclude that MCQA is no longer a\ngood proxy for assessing downstream performance of state-of-the-art models, and\noffer practical guidelines for designing more robust, bias-resistant benchmarks\nthat better reflect LLMs' genuine reasoning capabilities.",

However, this static model\nselection practice overlooks the fine-grained, evolving relational dependencies\nbetween diverse task queries and model architecture variations, resulting in\nsuboptimal matches and failing to further refine the model effectively. To fill\nthe model refinement gap in database research, we propose M-DESIGN, a curated\nmodel knowledge base (MKB) pipeline for mastering neural network refinement by\nadaptively weaving prior insights about model architecture modification. First,\nwe propose a knowledge weaving engine that reframes model refinement as an\nadaptive query problem over task metadata. Given a user's task query, M-DESIGN\nquickly matches and iteratively refines candidate models by leveraging a\ngraph-relational knowledge schema that explicitly encodes data properties,\narchitecture variations, and pairwise performance deltas as joinable relations.\nThis schema supports fine-grained relational analytics over architecture tweaks\nand drives a predictive query planner that can detect and adapt to\nout-of-distribution (OOD) tasks. We instantiate M-DESIGN for graph analytics\ntasks, where our model knowledge base enriches existing benchmarks with\nstructured metadata covering 3 graph tasks and 22 graph datasets, contributing\ndata records of 67,760 graph models.

    "abstract": "We propose a vision transformer (ViT)-based deep learning framework to refine\ndisaster-affected area segmentation from remote sensing imagery, aiming to\nsupport and enhance the Emergent Value Added Product (EVAP) developed by the\nTaiwan Space Agency (TASA). The process starts with a small set of manually\nannotated regions. We then apply principal component analysis (PCA)-based\nfeature space analysis and construct a confidence index (CI) to expand these\nlabels, producing a weakly supervised training set. These expanded labels are\nthen used to train ViT-based encoder-decoder models with multi-band inputs from\nSentinel-2 and Formosat-5 imagery. Our architecture supports multiple decoder\nvariants and multi-stage loss strategies to improve performance under limited\nsupervision. During the evaluation, model predictions are compared with\nhigher-resolution EVAP output to assess spatial coherence and segmentation\nconsistency. Case studies on the 2022 Poyang Lake drought and the 2023 Rhodes\nwildfire demonstrate that our framework improves the smoothness and reliability\nof segmentation results, offering a scalable approach for disaster mapping when\naccurate ground truth is unavailable.",

Often, this uncertainty\narises from multiple sources, e.g., incomplete information, limited\ncomputation, bounded rationality. While it may be possible to guide the agents'\ndecisions by modeling each source, their joint presence makes this task\nparticularly daunting. Toward this goal, it is natural for agents to seek\nprotection against deviations around the emergent behavior itself, which is\nultimately impacted by all the above sources of uncertainty. To do so, we\npropose that each agent takes decisions in face of the worst-case behavior\ncontained in an ambiguity set of tunable size, centered at the emergent\nbehavior so implicitly defined. This gives rise to a novel equilibrium notion,\nwhich we call strategically robust equilibrium. Building on its definition, we\nshow that, when judiciously operationalized via optimal transport,\nstrategically robust equilibria (i) are guaranteed to exist under the same\nassumptions required for Nash equilibria; (ii) interpolate between Nash and\nsecurity strategies; (iii) come at no additional computational cost compared to\nNash equilibria. Through a variety of experiments, including bi-matrix games,\ncongestion games, and Cournot competition, we show that strategic robustness\nprotects against uncertainty in the opponents' behavior and, surprisingly,\noften results in higher equilibrium payoffs - an effect we refer to as\ncoordination via robustification.",

    "abstract": "Kleinberg and Mullainathan (2024) recently proposed a formal framework called\nlanguage generation in the limit and showed that given a sequence of example\nstrings from an unknown target language drawn from any countable collection, an\nalgorithm can correctly generate unseen strings from the target language within\nfinite time. This notion was further refined by Li, Raman, and Tewari (2024),\nwho defined stricter categories of non-uniform and uniform generation. They\nshowed that a finite union of uniformly generatable collections is generatable\nin the limit, and asked if the same is true for non-uniform generation.\n  We begin by resolving the question in the negative: we give a uniformly\ngeneratable collection and a non-uniformly generatable collection whose union\nis not generatable in the limit. We then use facets of this construction to\nfurther our understanding of several variants of language generation. The first\ntwo, generation with noise and without samples, were introduced by Raman and\nRaman (2025) and Li, Raman, and Tewari (2024) respectively. We show the\nequivalence of these models for uniform and non-uniform generation, and provide\na characterization of non-uniform noisy generation. The former paper asked if\nthere is any separation between noisy and non-noisy generation in the limit --\nwe show that such a separation exists even with a single noisy string. Finally,\nwe study the framework of generation with feedback, introduced by Charikar and\nPabbaraju (2025), where the algorithm is strengthened by allowing it to ask\nmembership queries. We show finite queries add no power, but infinite queries\nyield a strictly more powerful model.\n  In summary, the results in this paper resolve the union-closedness of\nlanguage generation in the limit, and leverage those techniques (and others) to\ngive precise characterizations for natural variants that incorporate noise,\nloss, and feedback.",

We show the progress\nmade with the CHaracterizing ExOPlanets Satellite (CHEOPS) in this field using\nthe HD 95338 planetary system. We present a novel methodology as an important\nstep in the quest to find exomoons. We utilize ground-based spectroscopic data\nin combination with Gaia observations to obtain precise stellar parameters.\nThese are then used as input in the analysis of the planetary transits observed\nby CHEOPS and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). In addition, we\nsearch for the signs of satellites primarily in the form of additional transits\nin the Hill sphere of the eccentric Neptune-sized planet HD 95338b in a\nsequential approach based on four CHEOPS visits. We also briefly explore the\ntransit timing variations of the planet. We present refined stellar and\nplanetary parameters, narrowing down the uncertainty on the planet-to-star\nradius ratio by a factor of $10$. We also pin down the ephemeris of HD 95338b.\nUsing injection/retrieval tests, we show that a $5 \\sigma$ detection of an\nexomoon would be possible at $R_{\\rm Moon} = 0.8$~$R_\\oplus$ with the\nmethodology presented here. We exclude the transit of an exomoon in the system\nwith $R_{\\rm Moon} \\approx 0.6$~$R_\\oplus$ at the $1\\sigma$ level.

Previously, we\ndeveloped a numerical code jetsimpy, to model the afterglow of jets with\narbitrary angular profiles. In this study, we extend the code to incorporate a\nstratified radial profile, enabling it to model jets with arbitrary\naxisymmetric two-dimensional structures. The radial profile leads to the\nformation of a reverse shock. We modeled the shock system using an energy\nconservation prescription, which differs from the pressure balance approach.\nThis leads to remarkably different predictions for reverse shock emission. In\nparticular, we find that the reverse shock emission in the thin shell case is\nsignificantly overestimated in analytic models. We also explore the off-axis\nreverse shock emission from structured jets, where the cores belong to thick\nshell cases and the wings belong to thin shell cases. We have confirmed the\nprediction that off-axis observers may see a thin-to-thick transition, but we\nfind that the light curve morphology is hard to distinguish from pure thin or\nthick shell cases. A radial profile also introduces hydrodynamic energy\ninjection. As such, our code can naturally apply to refreshed shock cases,\nwhere the modeling of kilonova afterglows is demonstrated as an example. To\nvalidate our method, we fit the optical flash of GRB 990123, showing good\nagreement with the data.

From the early informal community-based risk sharing mechanisms to\nmodern formal index insurance products, risk management tools have continuously\nevolved. Although index insurance provides an effective risk transfer mechanism\nin theory, it still faces the problems of basis risk and pricing in practice.\nAt the same time, in the presence of informal community risk sharing\nmechanisms, the competitiveness of index insurance deserves further\ninvestigation. Here we propose a three-strategy evolutionary game model, which\nsimultaneously examines the competitive relationship between formal index\ninsurance purchasing (I), informal risk sharing strategies (S), and complete\nnon-insurance (A). Furthermore, we introduce a method for calculating insurance\ncompany profits to aid in the optimal pricing of index insurance products. We\nfind that basis risk and risk loss ratio have significant impacts on insurance\nadoption rate. Under scenarios with low basis risk and high loss ratios, index\ninsurance is more popular; meanwhile, when the loss ratio is moderate, an\ninformal risk sharing strategy is the preferred option. Conversely, when the\nloss ratio is low, individuals tend to forego any insurance. Furthermore,\naccurately assessing the degree of risk aversion and determining the\nappropriate ratio of risk sharing are crucial for predicting the future market\nsales of index insurance.",

Specifically, this issue manifests in two aspects:\ni) channels with high weights may not necessarily be effective, and ii)\nchannels with low weights may still hold significant value. To handle this\nproblem, we consider utilizing the inter-channel correlation to facilitate the\nnovel model's adaptation process to novel conditions, ensuring the model can\ncorrectly highlight effective channels and rectify those incorrect ones. Since\nthe channel sequence is also 1-dimensional, its similarity with the temporal\nsequence inspires us to take Mamba for modeling the correlation in the channel\nsequence. Based on this concept, we propose a Spatial-Channel State Space\nModeling (SCSM) module for spatial-channel state modeling, which highlights the\neffective patterns and rectifies those ineffective ones in feature channels. In\nSCSM, we design the Spatial Feature Modeling (SFM) module to balance the\nlearning of spatial relationships and channel relationships, and then introduce\nthe Channel State Modeling (CSM) module based on Mamba to learn correlation in\nchannels.

However, the image quality in MSK ultrasound is\noften limited by speckle noise, low resolution, poor contrast, and anisotropic\nreflections, making bone images difficult to interpret without additional\npost-processing. Typically, medical ultrasound systems use delay and sum\nbeamforming (DASB) for image reconstruction, which is not specifically\noptimized for bone structures. To address these limitations, we propose\nBEAM-Net, a novel end-to-end deep neural network (DNN) that performs\nhigh-frame-rate ultrasound beamforming with integrated bone enhancement, using\nsingle-plane-wave (SPW) radio frequency (RF) data as input.

The proposed\napproach is the first of its kind to incorporate bone enhancement directly into\nultrasound beamforming using deep learning.

    "abstract": "Smoothing and filtering two-dimensional sequences are fundamental tasks in\nfields such as computer vision. Conventional filtering algorithms often rely on\nthe selection of the filtering window, limiting their applicability in certain\nscenarios. To this end, we propose a novel Two-Dimensional Smoothing (TDS)\nalgorithm for the smoothing and filtering problem of two-dimensional sequences.\nTypically, the TDS algorithm does not require assumptions about the type of\nnoise distribution. It is simple and easy to implement compared to conventional\nfiltering methods, such as 2D adaptive Wiener filtering and Gaussian filtering.\nThe TDS algorithm can effectively extract the trend contained in the\ntwo-dimensional sequence and reduce the influence of noise on the data by\nadjusting only a single parameter. In this work, unlike existing algorithms\nthat depend on the filtering window, we introduce a loss function, where the\ntrend sequence is identified as the solution when this loss function takes a\nminimum value. Therefore, within the framework of the TDS algorithm, a general\ntwo-dimensional sequence can be innovatively decomposed into a trend sequence\nand a fluctuation sequence, in which the trend sequence contains the main\nfeatures of the sequence and the fluctuation sequence contains the detailed\nfeatures or noise interference of the sequence. To ensure the reliability of\nthe TDS algorithm, a crucial lemma is first established, indicating that the\ntrend sequence and fluctuation sequence obtained by the TDS algorithm are\nexistent and unique when the global smoothing parameter is determined. Three\nmodified algorithms are then proposed based on the TDS algorithm, with\ncorresponding lemmas and corollaries demonstrating their reliability. Finally,\nthe accuracy and effectiveness of the TDS algorithm are further verified\nthrough numerical simulations and image processing cases.",

To achieve robust and accurate performance\nin such scenarios, we propose DMD, a minutiae-anchored local dense\nrepresentation which captures both fine-grained ridge textures and\ndiscriminative minutiae features in a spatially structured manner.\nSpecifically, descriptors are extracted from local patches centered and\noriented on each detected minutia, forming a three-dimensional tensor, where\ntwo dimensions represent spatial locations on the fingerprint plane and the\nthird encodes semantic features. This representation explicitly captures\nabstract features of local image patches, enabling a multi-level, fine-grained\ndescription that aggregates information from multiple minutiae and their\nsurrounding ridge structures. Furthermore, thanks to its strong spatial\ncorrespondence with the patch image, DMD allows for the use of foreground\nsegmentation masks to identify valid descriptor regions.

Moreover,\nthese methods frequently overlook the importance of modeling long-term\ndependencies in inertial measurements - a critical factor for accurate\ntrajectory reconstruction - thereby limiting localization performance. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a reparameterized inertial localization\nnetwork that uses a multi-branch structure during training to enhance feature\nextraction.

To further capture\nlong-term dependencies in motion trajectories, we introduce a temporal-scale\nsparse attention mechanism that selectively emphasizes key trajectory segments\nwhile suppressing noise. Additionally, a gated convolutional unit is\nincorporated to effectively integrate long-range dependencies with local\nfine-grained features.

This dual-mode approach accommodates diverse surgical\nscenarios-motion-based softening excels with complex tissue deformations while\ndistance-based softening provides stability during unreliable optical flow\nconditions. We evaluate EndoControlMag on our EndoVMM24 dataset spanning four\ndifferent surgery types and various challenging scenarios, including\nocclusions, instrument disturbance, view changes, and vessel deformations.\nQuantitative metrics, visual assessments, and expert surgeon evaluations\ndemonstrate that EndoControlMag significantly outperforms existing methods in\nboth magnification accuracy and visual quality while maintaining robustness\nacross challenging surgical conditions.

    "abstract": "System identification methods for multivariate time-series, such as neural\nand behavioral recordings, have been used to build models for predicting one\nfrom the other. For example, Preferential Subspace Identification (PSID) builds\na state-space model of a primary time-series (e.g., neural activity) to\noptimally predict a secondary time-series (e.g., behavior). However, PSID\nfocuses on optimal prediction using past primary data, even though in offline\napplications, better estimation can be achieved by incorporating concurrent\ndata (filtering) or all available data (smoothing). Here, we extend PSID to\nenable optimal filtering and smoothing. First, we show that the presence of a\nsecondary signal makes it possible to uniquely identify a model with an optimal\nKalman update step (to enable filtering) from a family of otherwise equivalent\nstate-space models. Our filtering solution augments PSID with a reduced-rank\nregression step that directly learns the optimal gain required for the update\nstep from data. We refer to this extension of PSID as PSID with filtering.\nSecond, inspired by two-filter Kalman smoother formulations, we develop a novel\nforward-backward PSID smoothing algorithm where we first apply PSID with\nfiltering and then apply it again in the reverse time direction on the\nresiduals of the filtered secondary signal. We validate our methods on\nsimulated data, showing that our approach recovers the ground-truth model\nparameters for filtering, and achieves optimal filtering and smoothing decoding\nperformance of the secondary signal that matches the ideal performance of the\ntrue underlying model.

    "abstract": "Machine unlearning aims to remove knowledge of the specific training data in\na well-trained model. Currently, machine unlearning methods typically handle\nall forgetting data in a single batch, removing the corresponding knowledge all\nat once upon request. However, in practical scenarios, requests for data\nremoval often arise in a streaming manner rather than in a single batch,\nleading to reduced efficiency and effectiveness in existing methods. Such\nchallenges of streaming forgetting have not been the focus of much research. In\nthis paper, to address the challenges of performance maintenance, efficiency,\nand data access brought about by streaming unlearning requests, we introduce a\nstreaming unlearning paradigm, formalizing the unlearning as a distribution\nshift problem. We then estimate the altered distribution and propose a novel\nstreaming unlearning algorithm to achieve efficient streaming forgetting\nwithout requiring access to the original training data. Theoretical analyses\nconfirm an $O(\\sqrt{T} + V_T)$ error bound on the streaming unlearning regret,\nwhere $V_T$ represents the cumulative total variation in the optimal solution\nover $T$ learning rounds. This theoretical guarantee is achieved under mild\nconditions without the strong restriction of convex loss function. Experiments\nacross various models and datasets validate the performance of our proposed\nmethod.",

Instead, many developers use\nautomatic performance tuning (autotuning) to achieve high performance on a\nvariety of devices. However, autotuning \"overfits\", and must be redone if any\npart of the environment changes, such as if the device or input characteristics\nchange.\n  In most non-trivial cases, a single compute kernel cannot maintain\nnear-optimal performance across all environments. Changing the kernel to\nspecialize it to the current execution environment is possible, but on GPUs,\nruntime tuning and compilation can be expensive.\n  In this work, we use multi-versioning -- producing several variants of the\nsame code -- as a way to generate performance portable code. We describe a\nframework called portability tuning that can automatically generate\nmulti-versioned code whose performance is portable, requiring no retuning.\n  We evaluate our framework on a dataset of execution times for GEMM kernels\nfrom the CLBlast linear algebra library. We find our portability tuning\ntechniques outperform CLBlast's default kernels -- often approaching within 10%\nof the theoretical maximum performance -- despite CLBlast using autotuning\ntechniques.

Progress requires us to address\na number of translational issues, including sample efficiency, training time,\nand minimizing loop latency such that stimulation may be shaped in response to\nchanging brain activity. We propose temporal basis function models (TBFMs) to\naddress these difficulties, and explore this approach in the context of\nexcitatory optogenetic stimulation. We demonstrate the ability of TBF models to\nprovide a single-trial, spatiotemporal forward prediction of the effect of\noptogenetic stimulation on local field potentials (LFPs) measured in two\nnon-human primates. We further use simulations to demonstrate the use of TBF\nmodels for closed-loop stimulation, driving neural activity towards target\npatterns. The simplicity of TBF models allow them to be sample efficient, rapid\nto train (2-4min), and low latency (0.2ms) on desktop CPUs. We demonstrate the\nmodel on 40 sessions of previously published excitatory optogenetic stimulation\ndata. For each session, the model required 15-20min of data collection to\nsuccessfully model the remainder of the session. It achieved a prediction\naccuracy comparable to a baseline nonlinear dynamical systems model that\nrequires hours to train, and superior accuracy to a linear state-space model.\nIn our simulations, it also successfully allowed a closed-loop stimulator to\ncontrol a neural circuit. Our approach begins to bridge the translational gap\nbetween complex AI-based approaches to modeling dynamical systems and the\nvision of using such forward prediction models to develop novel, clinically\nuseful closed-loop stimulation protocols.",

    "abstract": "Scene understanding and risk-aware attentions are crucial for human drivers\nto make safe and effective driving decisions. To imitate this cognitive ability\nin urban autonomous driving while ensuring the transparency and\ninterpretability, we propose a vision-language model (VLM)-enhanced unified\ndecision-making and motion control framework, named VLM-UDMC. This framework\nincorporates scene reasoning and risk-aware insights into an upper-level slow\nsystem, which dynamically reconfigures the optimal motion planning for the\ndownstream fast system. The reconfiguration is based on real-time environmental\nchanges, which are encoded through context-aware potential functions. More\nspecifically, the upper-level slow system employs a two-step reasoning policy\nwith Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), leveraging foundation models to\nprocess multimodal inputs and retrieve contextual knowledge, thereby generating\nrisk-aware insights. Meanwhile, a lightweight multi-kernel decomposed LSTM\nprovides real-time trajectory predictions for heterogeneous traffic\nparticipants by extracting smoother trend representations for short-horizon\ntrajectory prediction. The effectiveness of the proposed VLM-UDMC framework is\nverified via both simulations and real-world experiments with a full-size\nautonomous vehicle. It is demonstrated that the presented VLM-UDMC effectively\nleverages scene understanding and attention decomposition for rational driving\ndecisions, thus improving the overall urban driving performance.

FL allows wireless devices (WDs) to\ncooperatively learn by sharing only local model parameters, without needing to\nshare the entire dataset. However, the emergence of large AI models has made\nexisting FL approaches inefficient, due to the significant communication\noverhead required. In this paper, we propose a novel over-the-air federated\ndistillation (FD) framework by synergizing the strength of FL and knowledge\ndistillation to avoid the heavy local model transmission. Instead of sharing\nthe model parameters, only the WDs' model outputs, referred to as knowledge,\nare shared and aggregated over-the-air by exploiting the superposition property\nof the multiple-access channel. We shall study the transceiver design in\nover-the-air FD, aiming to maximize the learning convergence rate while meeting\nthe power constraints of the transceivers. The main challenge lies in the\nintractability of the learning performance analysis, as well as the non-convex\nnature and the optimization spanning the whole FD training period. To tackle\nthis problem, we first derive an analytical expression of the convergence rate\nin over-the-air FD. Then, the closed-form optimal solutions of the WDs'\ntransmit power and the estimator for over-the-air aggregation are obtained\ngiven the receiver combining strategy. Accordingly, we put forth an efficient\napproach to find the optimal receiver beamforming vector via semidefinite\nrelaxation. We further prove that there is no optimality gap between the\noriginal and relaxed problem for the receiver beamforming design. Numerical\nresults will show that the proposed over-the-air FD approach achieves a\nsignificant reduction in communication overhead, with only a minor compromise\nin testing accuracy compared to conventional FL benchmarks.",

Most existing ECG datasets provide\nonly single-modality data or, at most, dual modalities, making it difficult to\nbuild models that can understand and integrate diverse ECG information in\nreal-world settings.

In addition, MEETI includes\nbeat-level quantitative ECG parameters extracted from each lead, offering\nstructured parameters that support fine-grained analysis and model\ninterpretability. Each MEETI record is aligned across four components: (1) the\nraw ECG waveform, (2) the corresponding plotted image, (3) extracted feature\nparameters, and (4) detailed interpretation text. This alignment is achieved\nusing consistent, unique identifiers. This unified structure supports\ntransformer-based multimodal learning and supports fine-grained, interpretable\nreasoning about cardiac health.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential in Automated Program\nRepair (APR). Test inputs, being crucial for reasoning the root cause of\nfailures, are always included in the prompt for LLM-based APR. Unfortunately,\nLLMs struggle to retain key information in long prompts. When the test inputs\nare extensive in the prompt, this may trigger the \"lost-in-the-middle\" issue,\ncompromising repair performance. To address this, we propose ReduceFix, an\nLLM-based APR approach with a built-in component that automatically reduces\ntest inputs while retaining their failure-inducing behavior. ReduceFix prompts\nan LLM to generate a reducer that minimizes failure-inducing test inputs\nwithout human effort, and then feeds the reduced failure-inducing inputs to\nguide patch generation.\n  For targeted evaluation, we constructed LFTBench, the first long-input APR\nbenchmark with 200 real bugs from 20 programming tasks, each paired with a\nfailure-inducing input whose median size is 1 MB. On this benchmark, ReduceFix\nshrinks inputs by 89.1% on average and improves overall pass@10 by up to 53.8%\nrelative to a prompt that includes the original test, and by 17.6% compared\nwith omitting the test entirely. Adding the same reduction step to ChatRepair\nincreases its fix rate by 21.3% without other changes. Ablation studies further\nhighlight the impact of input length and compressed failure information on\nrepair success. These results underscore that automatically reducing failing\ninputs is a practical and powerful complement to LLM-based APR, significantly\nimproving its scalability and effectiveness.",

This blind spot arises because conventional,\nsemantically-driven retrieval methods are not equipped to gather evidence that\nis both topically relevant and temporally coherent for a specified duration. We\naddress this challenge by proposing a new framework that fundamentally\nredesigns the RAG pipeline to infuse temporal logic. Our methodology begins by\ndisentangling a user's query into its core subject and its temporal window. It\nthen employs a specialized retriever that calibrates semantic matching against\ntemporal relevance, ensuring the collection of a contiguous evidence set that\nspans the entire queried period. To enable rigorous evaluation of this\ncapability, we also introduce the Analytical Diachronic Question Answering\nBenchmark (ADQAB), a challenging evaluation suite grounded in a hybrid corpus\nof real and synthetic financial news. Empirical results on ADQAB show that our\napproach yields substantial gains in answer accuracy, surpassing standard RAG\nimplementations by 13% to 27%.

Existing alternatives typically require\neither per-subject optimization via trainable text embeddings or training\nspecialized encoders for subject feature extraction on large-scale datasets.\nSuch dependencies on training procedures fundamentally constrain their\npractical applications. More importantly, current methodologies fail to fully\nleverage the inherent zero-shot potential of modern diffusion transformers\n(e.g., the Flux series) for authentic subject-driven synthesis. To bridge this\ngap, we propose FreeCus, a genuinely training-free framework that activates\nDiT's capabilities through three key innovations: 1) We introduce a pivotal\nattention sharing mechanism that captures the subject's layout integrity while\npreserving crucial editing flexibility. 2) Through a straightforward analysis\nof DiT's dynamic shifting, we propose an upgraded variant that significantly\nimproves fine-grained feature extraction. 3) We further integrate advanced\nMultimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to enrich cross-modal semantic\nrepresentations.

The novel measurements motivated the extension of a covariant quark\nmodel, developed to the spacelike region ($q^2 \\le 0$), to the timelike region,\nwithout any further parameter fitting. The extension is based on asymptotic\nrelations derived from analyticity and unitarity, valid for the large-$q^2$\nregion. We use the model to make predictions for the effective form factor\n$|G|$ (combination of $G_E$ and $G_M$) and the ratio $|G_E/G_M|$ for spin 1/2\nhyperons at large $q^2$ (above 10 GeV$^2$). Our calculations are in good\nagreement with the data from CLEO and BESIII for $\\Lambda$, $\\Sigma^+$ and\n$\\Xi^-$ above $q^2=15$ GeV$^2$. Upcoming data for $\\Sigma^0$, $\\Sigma^-$ and\n$\\Xi^-$ at large $q^2$ may be used to further test our predictions. We also\ncompare our model calculations with the scarce available data for $|G_E/G_M|$.\nWe conclude that the present $q^2$ range is not large enough to test our\ncalculations, but that a more definitive test can be made by experiments above\n$q^2=20$ GeV$^2$.",

    "abstract": "Despite the critical threat posed by software security vulnerabilities,\nreports are often incomplete, lacking the proof-of-vulnerability (PoV) tests\nneeded to validate fixes and prevent regressions. These tests are crucial not\nonly for ensuring patches work, but also for helping developers understand how\nvulnerabilities can be exploited. Generating PoV tests is a challenging\nproblem, requiring reasoning about the flow of control and data through deeply\nnested levels of a program.\n  We present FaultLine, an LLM agent workflow that uses a set of carefully\ndesigned reasoning steps, inspired by aspects of traditional static and dynamic\nprogram analysis, to automatically generate PoV test cases. Given a software\nproject with an accompanying vulnerability report, FaultLine 1) traces the flow\nof an input from an externally accessible API (\"source\") to the \"sink\"\ncorresponding to the vulnerability, 2) reasons about the conditions that an\ninput must satisfy in order to traverse the branch conditions encountered along\nthe flow, and 3) uses this reasoning to generate a PoV test case in a\nfeedback-driven loop. FaultLine does not use language-specific static or\ndynamic analysis components, which enables it to be used across programming\nlanguages.\n  To evaluate FaultLine, we collate a challenging multi-lingual dataset of 100\nknown vulnerabilities in Java, C and C++ projects. On this dataset, FaultLine\nis able to generate PoV tests for 16 projects, compared to just 9 for CodeAct\n2.1, a popular state-of-the-art open-source agentic framework. Thus, FaultLine\nrepresents a 77% relative improvement over the state of the art. Our findings\nsuggest that hierarchical reasoning can enhance the performance of LLM agents\non PoV test generation, but the problem in general remains challenging. We make\nour code and dataset publicly available in the hope that it will spur further\nresearch in this area.",

A key puzzle\nis whether the shear-induced polarization is non-dissipative or not. In this\nwork, we analyzed the shear-induced polarization and the anomalous Hall effects\nusing the entropy flow and H-theorem introduced from quantum (chiral) kinetic\ntheory. While the shear-induced polarization and the anomalous Hall effect do\nnot directly contribute to the entropy production rate, the perturbations\nassociated with the shear tensor lead to an increase in entropy, similar to the\nrole of the shear tensor in classical kinetic theory. We also examined these\neffects within the framework of linear response theory using Zubarev's\napproach. The analysis of time-reversal transformation on the spin current in\ncoordinate space suggests that shear-induced polarization violates\ntime-reversal symmetry and, therefore, should vanish. However, a similar\nanalysis of the Wigner function in phase space does not impose any additional\nconstraints on shear-induced polarization, allowing it to persist in phase\nspace as expected. This discussion indicates that time-reversal analysis in\ncoordinate space alone may not be sufficient to determine whether an effect is\ndissipative. Furthermore, our analysis based on Zubarev's approach suggests\nthat these effects may indeed possess a dissipative nature. These findings\nhighlight the limitations of the current theoretical framework in fully\ncharacterizing the dissipative properties of these phenomena.",

We evaluate MFTRR on\nthree newly constructed multimodal topic-post datasets and the public\nLazada-Home dataset.

Although existing FRS\nframeworks benefit from on-device feature extraction and privacy preservation,\nthey suffer from heterogeneous device capabilities, non-independent and\nidentically distributed (non-IID) data, and communication bottlenecks. To\novercome these limitations, we propose a multi-objective reinforcement learning\n(RL) participant selection that jointly optimizes historical client performance\nreputation (CPR), data utility, and system efficiency. First, we define a\ncomposite client-utility function combining CPR, system capability, and data\nquality.

Across four different skewed\ndata-partition scenarios, our MAB-based selection accelerates convergence by\n32-50% in time-to-target AUC and reduces total wall-clock training time by up\nto 46%, while matching or slightly improving final AUC, NDCG@50, and Recall@50\ncompared to existing FRS baselines.

The two translations of the treatise into English that I am familiar with\ndiffer at one point substantially from each other. Unambiguously, the year and\nseason of the comet's appearance was early 372 BC (or -371). From Aristotle's\nconstraint on the comet's setting relative to sunset, I infer that the probable\ndate of perihelion passage was January 20, a date also consistent with the\nvague remark on frosty weather. On the day that Aristotle claims the comet was\nnot seen, its head may have been hidden behind the Sun's disk or in contact\nwith it. The observation that the `comet receded as far as Orion's belt, where\nit dissolved' is being satisfied by the tested orbit if the perihelion was\nreached between January 20 and February 10. Aristotle's third statement, which\ndescribes the tail as a streak 60 degrees in length, suggests a plasma feature\nstretching in space over 0.8 AU. The dust tail was developing more gradually\nand it was all that could be seen from the comet when it was approaching\nOrion's belt in early April. The comet was seen over a period of more than 10\nweeks. The results of this study strengthen the notion that Aristotle's comet\nindeed was the gigantic progenitor of Kreutz sungrazers.",

    "abstract": "Interpretability is critical in high-stakes domains such as medical imaging,\nwhere understanding model decisions is essential for clinical adoption. In this\nwork, we introduce Sparse Autoencoder (SAE)-based interpretability to breast\nimaging by analyzing {Mammo-CLIP}, a vision--language foundation model\npretrained on large-scale mammogram image--report pairs. We train a patch-level\n\\texttt{Mammo-SAE} on Mammo-CLIP to identify and probe latent features\nassociated with clinically relevant breast concepts such as \\textit{mass} and\n\\textit{suspicious calcification}. Our findings reveal that top activated class\nlevel latent neurons in the SAE latent space often tend to align with ground\ntruth regions, and also uncover several confounding factors influencing the\nmodel's decision-making process. Additionally, we analyze which latent neurons\nthe model relies on during downstream finetuning for improving the breast\nconcept prediction. This study highlights the promise of interpretable SAE\nlatent representations in providing deeper insight into the internal workings\nof foundation models at every layer for breast imaging.

    "abstract": "Code clone detection, which aims to identify functionally equivalent code\nfragments, plays a critical role in software maintenance and vulnerability\nanalysis. Substantial methods have been proposed to detect code clones, but\nthey fall short in capturing code semantics or relying on language-specific\nanalyzers. Inspired by the remarkable success of AlphaFold in predicting\nthree-dimensional protein structures from protein sequences, in this paper, we\nleverage AlphaFold for code clone detection based on the insight that protein\nsequences and token sequences share a common linear sequential structure. In\nparticular, we propose AlphaCC, which represents code fragments as token\nsequences to ensure multi-language applicability and adapts AlphaFold's\nsequence-to-structure modeling capability to infer code semantics. The pipeline\nof AlphaCC goes through three steps. First, AlphaCC transforms each input code\nfragment into a token sequence and, motivated by AlphaFold's use of multiple\nsequence alignment (MSA) to enhance contextual understanding, constructs an MSA\nfrom lexically similar token sequences. Second, AlphaCC adopts a modified\nattention-based encoder based on AlphaFold to model dependencies within and\nacross token sequences. Finally, unlike AlphaFold's protein structure\nprediction task, AlphaCC computes similarity scores between token sequences\nthrough a late interaction strategy and performs binary classification to\ndetermine code clone pairs. Comprehensive evaluations on three language-diverse\ndatasets demonstrate AlphaCC's applicability across multiple programming\nlanguages. On two semantic clone detection datasets, it consistently\noutperforms all baselines, showing strong semantic understanding. Moreover,\nAlphaCC maintains competitive efficiency, enabling practical usage in\nlarge-scale clone detection tasks.",

    "abstract": "Turning on the $T\\bar{T}$-deformation in a two-dimensional CFT provides a\nunique window to study explicitly how non-local features arise in the UV as a\nresult of the deformation. A sharp signature is the dynamical emergence of an\neffective length-scale $\\propto \\sqrt{\\mu}$ that separates the local and\nnon-local regimes of the deformed theory, effectively serving as a UV cut-off\nfor computing observables in the local regime. In this paper, we study this\nphenomenon through the entanglement structures of the deformed theory. We focus\non computing the Renyi entropies of single-interval sub-regions in the deformed\nvacuum states. We pay particular attention to the interplay between the bare\nentanglement cut-off inherited from the CFT computation and the effects from\nthe $T\\bar{T}$ deformations. Applying the general replica trick to the string\ntheory formulation of $T\\bar{T}$-deformed CFTs, we derive an explicit\nrepresentation of the deformed replica partition function as a weighted\nintegral of the CFT results evaluated at a dynamical cut-off, which is\nintegrated over. We computed in detail the kernel functions of the integral\nrepresentation, and performed the saddle-point analysis in the semi-classical\nlimit of small $\\mu$. We found that in addition to the perturbative\nsaddle-point which identifies the dynamical cut-off with the bare entanglement\ncut-off, there exists another non-perturbative saddle-point that identifies the\ndynamical cut-off with the $T\\bar{T}$ length-scale $\\propto \\sqrt{\\mu}$, but\nwhose contribution is exponentially small. We discuss how these\nnon-perturbative effects can shed lights on the mechanism through which the\n$T\\bar{T}$ length-scale may eventually replace the bare counter-part and become\nthe effective entanglement cut-off.",

    "abstract": "Given data generated by an observable stochastic process, we study how to\nconstruct statistically optimal decisions for general stochastic optimization\nproblems. Our setting encompasses non-standard data structures, including data\noriginating from heterogeneous sources or from randomly evolving\ndata-generating mechanisms. We propose a decision-making approach that\nidentifies optimal decisions for which a specific notion of risk of shifted\nregret decays to zero at a prescribed exponential rate. This optimal decision\narises as the solution to a multi-objective optimization problem, which\nreflects asymptotic behavior properties of the data-generating process. Central\nto our framework is a rate function that characterizes this behavior via a\nLaplace principle, thereby generalizing standard concepts from large deviation\ntheory. Our general formulation enables our approach to account for data from\nuncertain distributions and recovers classical results in data-driven decision\nmaking under uncertainty as special cases, including distributionally robust\noptimization. Moreover, our method enables decision-makers to systematically\nbalance a desired rate of asymptotic risk decay against a potential loss in\nstatistical consistency of the resulting data-driven decision. We demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of the proposed approach through illustrative examples from\noperations research, such as the newsvendor problem, under aleatoric\nuncertainty induced by heterogeneous data sources.",

While extensive research has focused on\ntheir similarities to ordinary atoms, the role of their internal degrees of\nfreedom (IDOF) remains largely unexplored. Concurrently, compensated\nantiferromagnets (AFMs) with intrinsic spin-split band structures have emerged\nas a promising class of materials for spintronics, yet their experimental\nrealization, particularly in two dimensions, is limited. Here, we bridge these\ntwo fields by proposing a novel strategy to achieve spin-split AFMs using\nsuperatoms with IDOFs. We establish our core concept using a simple model,\ndemonstrating how superatom IDOFs can be leveraged to engineer system symmetry\nand induce spin splitting in AFM states. We concretely illustrate this strategy\nby first-principles calculations on a Mo-decorated carborophene sheets,\nconstructed from closo-carborane superatoms. We show that the distinct IDOFs of\ncarborane isomers (electric-dipole-like and nematic) are critical in\ndetermining the symmetry of the resulting 2D superatomic crystal and,\nconsequently, the spin splitting pattern of its AFM states. Our findings\nunderscore the profound significance of superatom IDOFs-a feature absent in\nordinary atoms-and introduce a new paradigm for engineering spin splitting in\nAFM lattices.

Experimental results showed that MambaDiff3D can\ngenerate dense 3D human meshes in clothes, with grasping hands, etc., and\noutperforms previous approaches in the 3D human shape generation task.\nAdditionally, Mamba-HMR extends the capabilities of previous non-parametric\nhuman mesh recovery approaches, which were limited to handling body-only poses\nusing around 500 vertex tokens, to the whole-body setting with face and hands,\nwhile achieving competitive performance in (near) real-time.",

However, the observation of quantum phases\nin ultracold molecular gases that are driven by dipole-dipole interactions has\nso far remained elusive. In this work, we report the formation of self-bound\ndroplets and droplet arrays in an ultracold gas of strongly dipolar\nsodium-cesium molecules. Starting from a molecular Bose-Einstein condensate\n(BEC), microwave dressing fields are used to induce dipole-dipole interactions\nwith controllable strength and anisotropy.

The droplets exhibit densities up to 100 times\nhigher than the initial BEC, reaching the strongly interacting regime, and\nsuggesting the possibility of a quantum-liquid or crystalline state.

After sawtooth crashes, the heat and turbulence pulses in the core\npropagate to the edge, with the turbulence pulse being faster than the heat\npulse. After sawtooth crashes, the edge electron temperature increases and the\nedge turbulence is enhanced, with turbulence preceding temperature. The\nenhanced edge turbulence is mainly composed of two parts: the turbulence driven\nby local gradient and the turbulence spreading from core to edge. The\ndevelopment of the estimated turbulence spreading rate is prior to that of the\nturbulence driving rate. The increase in the turbulence intensity can cause the\nturbulent Reynold stress and its gradient to increase, thereby enhancing shear\nflows and radial electric fields. Turbulence spreading leads the edge Reynolds\nstresses to develop and the shear flow to be faster than edge electron\ntemperature. The Reynolds stress arises from the symmetry breaking of the\nturbulence wave number spectrum. After sawtooth collapses, the joint\nprobability density function of radial wave number and poloidal wave number of\nturbulence intensity exhibits strong asymmetry. These results show that the\nturbulence spreading and symmetry breaking can enhance turbulent Reynolds\nstress, thereby driving shear flows, after sawtooth has crashed.",

In zero magnetic field, laser excitation modifies only the\nmagnetization along the easy axis, leaving transverse components unaffected. We\nfind that below-gap, low-fluence pulses enhance the local magnetic moments via\nspin transfer from nonmagnetic to magnetic atoms, increasing the Neel vector.\nIn contrast, high-fluence pulses drive interlayer spin transfer between\nmagnetic atoms, producing strong demagnetization and reducing the Neel vector,\nwhile S and Br atoms exhibit primarily charge transfer with weak opposite\ncontribution to the demagnetization. An applied magnetic field qualitatively\nalters the response, enabling both magnitude changes and ultrafast\nreorientation of the magnetization. We show that the resulting layer-resolved\nreorientation respects a twofold rotation about the x-axis, exciting coherent\noptical magnons even under this symmetry, which modulate the relative angle\nbetween neighboring layers and periodically tune electronic properties.

    "abstract": "In this article, we utilize the concept of average controllability in graphs,\nalong with a novel rank encoding method, to enhance the performance of Graph\nNeural Networks (GNNs) in social network classification tasks. GNNs have proven\nhighly effective in various network-based learning applications and require\nsome form of node features to function. However, their performance is heavily\ninfluenced by the expressiveness of these features. In social networks, node\nfeatures are often unavailable due to privacy constraints or the absence of\ninherent attributes, making it challenging for GNNs to achieve optimal\nperformance. To address this limitation, we propose two strategies for\nconstructing expressive node features. First, we introduce average\ncontrollability along with other centrality metrics (denoted as NCT-EFA) as\nnode-level metrics that capture critical aspects of network topology. Building\non this, we develop a rank encoding method that transforms average\ncontrollability or any other graph-theoretic metric into a fixed-dimensional\nfeature space, thereby improving feature representation. We conduct extensive\nnumerical evaluations using six benchmark GNN models across four social network\ndatasets to compare different node feature construction methods. Our results\ndemonstrate that incorporating average controllability into the feature space\nsignificantly improves GNN performance. Moreover, the proposed rank encoding\nmethod outperforms traditional one-hot degree encoding, improving the ROC AUC\nfrom 68.7% to 73.9% using GraphSAGE on the GitHub Stargazers dataset,\nunderscoring its effectiveness in generating expressive and efficient node\nrepresentations.",

We employed\nthe nnU-Net framework to evaluate eleven annotation strategies for accurate 3D\nsegmentation of pheochromocytoma, introducing a set of novel multi-class\nschemes based on organ-specific anatomical priors. These priors were derived\nfrom adjacent organs commonly surrounding adrenal tumors (e.g., liver, spleen,\nkidney, aorta, adrenal gland, and pancreas), and were compared against a broad\nbody-region prior used in previous work. The framework was trained and tested\non 105 contrast-enhanced CT scans from 91 patients at the NIH Clinical Center.\nPerformance was measured using Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), Normalized\nSurface Distance (NSD), and instance-wise F1 score. Among all strategies, the\nTumor + Kidney + Aorta (TKA) annotation achieved the highest segmentation\naccuracy, significantly outperforming the previously used Tumor + Body (TB)\nannotation across DSC (p = 0.0097), NSD (p = 0.0110), and F1 score (25.84%\nimprovement at an IoU threshold of 0.5), measured on a 70-30 train-test split.\nThe TKA model also showed superior tumor burden quantification (R^2 = 0.968)\nand strong segmentation across all genetic subtypes. In five-fold\ncross-validation, TKA consistently outperformed TB across IoU thresholds (0.1\nto 0.5), reinforcing its robustness and generalizability.

However, despite significant advances, we identify a\ncritical yet overlooked issue undermining their reliability: a systematic\nenergy underprediction. This problem becomes starkly evident in large-scale\nthermodynamic stability assessments. By performing over 12 million calculations\nusing nine MLIAPs for over 150,000 inorganic crystals in the Materials Project,\nwe demonstrate that most frontier models consistently underpredict energy above\nhull (Ehull), a key metric for thermodynamic stability, total energy, and\nformation energy, despite the fact that over 90\\% of test structures\n(DFT-relaxed) are in the training data. The mean absolute errors (MAE) for\nEhull exceed ~30 meV/atom even by the best model, directly challenging claims\nof achieving ``DFT accuracy'' for property predictions central to materials\ndiscovery, especially related to (meta-)stability. Crucially, we trace this\nunderprediction to insufficient handling of symmetry degrees of freedom (DOF),\nconstituting both lattice symmetry and Wyckoff site symmetries for the space\ngroup. MLIAPs exhibit pronounced errors (MAE for Ehull $>$ ~40 meV/atom) in\nstructures with high symmetry DOF, where subtle atomic displacements\nsignificantly impact energy landscapes. Further analysis also indicates that\nthe MLIAPs show severe energy underprediction for a large proportion of\nnear-hull materials.

    "abstract": "As modeling and visualization applications proliferate, there arises a need\nto simplify large polygonal models at interactive rates. Unfortunately existing\npolygon mesh simplification algorithms are not well suited for this task\nbecause they are either too slow (requiring the simplified model to be\npre-computed) or produce models that are too poor in quality. These\nshortcomings become particularly acute when models are extremely large. We\npresent an algorithm suitable for simplification of large models at interactive\nspeeds. The algorithm is fast and can guarantee displayable results within a\ngiven time limit. Results also have good quality. Inspired by splitting\nalgorithms from vector quantization literature, we simplify models in reverse,\nbeginning with an extremely coarse approximation and refining it.\nApproximations of surface curvature guide the simplification process.\nPreviously produced simplifications can be further refined by using them as\ninput to the algorithm.",

    "abstract": "Quantile-based randomized Kaczmarz (QRK) was recently introduced to\nefficiently solve sparsely corrupted linear systems $\\mathbf{A}\n\\mathbf{x}^*+\\mathbf{\\epsilon} = \\mathbf{b}$ [SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Appl.,\n43(2), 605-637], where $\\mathbf{A}\\in \\mathbb{R}^{m\\times n}$ and\n$\\mathbf{\\epsilon}$ is an arbitrary $(\\beta m)$-sparse corruption. However, all\nexisting theoretical guarantees for QRK require quantiles to be computed using\nall $m$ samples (or a subsample of the same order), thus negating the\ncomputational advantage of Kaczmarz-type methods. This paper overcomes the\nbottleneck. We analyze a subsampling QRK, which computes quantiles from $D$\nuniformly chosen samples at each iteration. Under some standard scaling\nassumptions on the coefficient matrix, we show that QRK with subsample size\n$D\\ge\\frac{C\\log (T)}{\\log(1/\\beta)}$ linearly converges over the first $T$\niterations with high probability, where $C$ is some absolute constant. This\nsubsample size is a substantial reduction from $O(m)$ in prior results. For\ninstance, it translates into $O(\\log(n))$ even if an approximation error of\n$\\exp(-n^2)$ is desired. Intriguingly, our subsample size is also tight up to a\nmultiplicative constant: if $D\\le \\frac{c\\log(T)}{\\log(1/\\beta)}$ for some\nconstant $c$, the error of the $T$-th iterate could be arbitrarily large with\nhigh probability. Numerical results are provided to corroborate our theory.",

The\nAMD-IDDES approach incorporates an anisotropic minimum-dissipation (AMD) model\ninto the traditional IDDES framework to better account for local flow\nanisotropy and energy dissipation characteristics. The method is validated\nagainst the traditional IDDES approach, and the results show that AMD-IDDES\nmore accurately captures the evolution of vortices and separated shear layers.\nCompared with an iced straight wing, a swept wing exhibits distinct aerodynamic\nbehavior driven mainly by the sweep angle. The sweep angle induces strong\nspanwise flow, which reshapes the separation region and transforms the flow\nfrom two-dimensional to three-dimensional. This spanwise motion significantly\nalters vortex development and enhances the complexity of the unsteady flow. The\nshear layer separation, initiated by a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, dominates\nthe unsteady aerodynamic response. Although wingtip effects remain secondary,\ntheir interaction with the leading-edge vortex still contributes to lowering\nthe dominant frequency.

    "abstract": "A method is presented to use a fiber-optic device known as a photonic lantern\nto generate a reconfigurable custom wavefront for a null test of spherical,\naspheric, and freeform optical surfaces. By modulating input intensity and\nphases at single mode fiber input ports, the wavefront of the output light\nfield from the multimode end can be controlled to generate a custom nulling\nphase function. Generation of a desired wavefront is demonstrated by simulating\na nineteen-port non-mode-selective photonic lantern. Using a linear\nresponse-matrix approach, a phase function with an RMS error of 44 nm from the\ntarget was generated in simulation. A compact form-factor noninterferometric\nnull test for freeform optical surfaces is then described utilizing the\nphotonic lantern as both a reconfigurable nulling source and a wavefront\nsensor.",

Hambly &\nBlair (2024) examined nine such transients reported by Villarroel (2021) and\nfound that they exhibit narrower, rounder profiles, attributing this to\nemulsion flaws. However, well-established optical principles and atmospheric\nphysics imply that unresolved flashes lasting less than a second naturally\nappear sharper and more circular than stellar images, particularly on\nlong-exposure plates where stars are significantly blurred by seeing and\ntracking errors. Such profiles are an expected consequence of sub-second\noptical flashes, making their findings consistent with the transient\ninterpretation.",

Can BIM-driven design improvements, combined with\nphotovoltaic systems, achieve substantial energy savings while enabling\nself-powered environmental monitoring? This study conducts a case analysis on a\nretrofitted primary school building in Guangdong, China, utilizing BIM-based\nenergy simulations, material optimization, and solar technology integration.\nThe outcomes reveal that the proposed approach reduced annual energy\nconsumption by 40.68%, with lighting energy use decreasing by 36.59%. A rooftop\nphotovoltaic system demonstrated a payback period of 7.46 years while powering\nenvironmental sensors autonomously. Hardware system integrates sensors and an\nARDUINO-based controller to detect environmental factors like rainfall,\ntemperature, and air quality. It is powered by a 6W solar panel and a 2200\nmAh/7.4 V lithium battery to ensure stable operation. This study underscores\nthe potential of BIM and solar energy integration to transform traditional\nbuildings into energy-efficient, self-sustaining smart structures.

These Hamiltonians mimic realistic electronic\nstructure problems, support adjustable complexity, and are derived from\nreference systems. Crucially, their ground-state energies can be computed\nexactly, provided the construction parameters are known. To obscure this\nstructure and control perceived complexity, we introduce techniques such as\nkiller operators, balance operators, and random orbital rotations.

Multiple\ndata types are considered for modeling such mediators including the\nzero-inflated log-normal mixture, zero-inflated Poisson mixture and\nzero-inflated negative binomial mixture. A two-part mediation effect is derived\nto better understand effects on outcomes attributable to the numerical change\nas well as binary change from 0 to 1 in mediators. The maximum likelihood\nestimates are obtained by an expectation maximization algorithm to account for\nunobserved mixture membership and whether an observed zero is a true or false\nzero. The optimal number of mixture components are chosen by a model selection\ncriterion.
