    "abstract": "Collecting multiple longitudinal measurements and time-to-event outcomes is a\ncommon practice in clinical and epidemiological studies, often focusing on\nexploring associations between them. Joint modeling is the standard analytical\ntool for such data, with several R packages available. However, as the number\nof longitudinal markers increases, the computational burden and convergence\nchallenges make joint modeling increasingly impractical.\n  This paper introduces a novel two-stage Bayesian approach to estimate joint\nmodels for multiple longitudinal measurements and time-to-event outcomes. The\nmethod builds on the standard two-stage framework but improves the initial\nstage by estimating a separate one-marker joint model for the event and each\nlongitudinal marker, rather than relying on mixed models. These estimates are\nused to derive predictions of individual marker trajectories, avoiding biases\nfrom informative dropouts. In the second stage, a proportional hazards model is\nfitted, incorporating the predicted current values and slopes of the markers as\ntime-dependent covariates. To address uncertainty in the first-stage\npredictions, a multiple imputation technique is employed when estimating the\nCox model in the second stage.\n  This two-stage method allows for the analysis of numerous longitudinal\nmarkers, which is often infeasible with traditional multi-marker joint\nmodeling. The paper evaluates the approach through simulation studies and\napplies it to the PBC2 dataset and a real-world dementia dataset containing 17\nlongitudinal markers. An R package, TSJM, implementing the method is freely\navailable on GitHub: https://github.com/tbaghfalaki/TSJM.",

    "abstract": "Given a planar domain $D$, the harmonic measure distribution function\n$h_D(r)$, with base point $z$, is the harmonic measure with pole at $z$ of the\nparts of the boundary which are within a distance $r$ of $z$. Equivalently it\nis the probability Brownian motion started from $z$ first strikes the boundary\nwithin a distance $r$ from $z$. We call $h_D$ the $h$-function of $D$, this\nfunction captures geometrical aspects of the domain, such as connectivity, or\ncurvature of the boundary. This paper is concerned with the inverse problem:\ngiven a suitable function $h$, does there exist a domain $D$ such that $h =\nh_D$? To answer this, we first extend the concept of a $h$-function of a domain\nto one of a stopping time $\\tau$ . By using the conformal invariance of\nBrownian motion we solve the inverse problem for that of a stopping time. The\nassociated stopping time will be the projection of a hitting time of the real\nline. If this projection corresponds to the hitting time of a domain $D$, then\nthis technique solves the original inverse problem. We have found a large\nfamily of examples such that the associated stopping time is that of a hitting\ntime.",

    "abstract": "Traditional methods for spatial inference estimate smooth interpolating\nfields based on features measured at well-located points. When the spatial\nlocations of some observations are missing, joint inference of the fields and\nlocations is possible as the fields inform the locations and vice versa. If the\nnumber of missing locations is large, conventional Bayesian Inference fails if\nthe generative model for the data is even slightly mis-specified, due to\nfeedback between estimated fields and the imputed locations. Semi-Modular\nInference (SMI) offers a solution by controlling the feedback between different\nmodular components of the joint model using a hyper-parameter called the\ninfluence parameter. Our work is motivated by linguistic studies on a large\ncorpus of late-medieval English textual dialects. We simultaneously learn\ndialect fields using dialect features observed in ``anchor texts'' with known\nlocation and estimate the location of origin for ``floating'' textual dialects\nof unknown origin. The optimal influence parameter minimises a loss measuring\nthe accuracy of held-out anchor data. We compute a (flow-based) variational\napproximation to the SMI posterior for our model. This allows efficient\ncomputation of the optimal influence. MCMC-based approaches, feasible on small\nsubsets of the data, are used to check the variational approximation.",

We use magnetohydrodynamic\nsimulations in the dynamical spacetime of a merging BH--NS binary to\ninvestigate its magnetospheric dynamics. We find that compressive waves excited\nin the magnetosphere develop into monster shocks as they propagate outward.\nAfter swallowing the NS, the BH acquires a magnetosphere that quickly evolves\ninto a split monopole configuration and then undergoes an exponential decay\n(balding), enabled by magnetic reconnection and also assisted by the ring-down\nof the remnant BH. This spinning BH drags the split monopole into rotation,\nforming a transient pulsar-like state. It emits a striped wind if the swallowed\nmagnetic dipole moment is inclined to the spin axis.

Communication times are reduced across all compression methods, with top-k\nand DGC decreasing communication to negligible levels at high compression\nratios.

In\npractice, due to the scarcity of annotated data in downstream tasks, Zero-Shot\nCIR (ZS-CIR) is desirable. While existing ZS-CIR models based on CLIP have\nshown promising results, their capability in interpreting and following\nmodification instructions remains limited.

    "abstract": "This paper studies the thermodynamic topology through the bulk-boundary and\nrestricted phase space (RPS) frameworks. In bulk-boundary framework, we observe\ntwo topological charges $(\\omega = +1, -1)$ concerning the non-extensive Barrow\nparameter and with ($\\delta=0$) in Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. For Renyi\nentropy, different topological charges are observed depending on the value of\nthe $\\lambda$ with a notable transition from three topological charges $(\\omega\n= +1, -1, +1)$ to a single topological charge $(\\omega = +1)$ as $\\lambda$\nincreases. Also, by setting $\\lambda$ to zero results in two topological\ncharges $(\\omega = +1, -1)$. Sharma-Mittal entropy exhibits three distinct\nranges of topological charges influenced by the $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ with\ndifferent classifications viz $\\beta$ exceeds $\\alpha$, we will have $(\\omega =\n+1, -1, +1)$, $\\beta = \\alpha$, we have $(\\omega = +1, -1)$ and for $\\alpha$\nexceeds $\\beta$ we face $(\\omega = -1)$. Also, Kaniadakis entropy shows\nvariations in topological charges viz we observe $(\\omega = +1, -1)$ for any\nacceptable value of $K$, except when $K = 0$, where a single topological charge\n$(\\omega = -1)$. In the case of Tsallis-Cirto entropy, for small parameter\n$\\Delta$ values, we have $(\\omega = +1)$ and when $\\Delta$ increases to 0.9, we\nwill have $(\\omega = +1, -1)$. When we extend our analysis to the RPS\nframework, we find that the topological charge consistently remains $(\\omega =\n+1)$ independent of the specific values of the free parameters for Renyi,\nSharma-Mittal, and Tsallis-Cirto. Additionally, for Barrow entropy in RPS, the\nnumber of topological charges rises when $\\delta$ increases from 0 to 0.8.\nFinally for Kaniadakis entropy, at small values of $K$, we observe $(\\omega =\n+1)$. However, as the non-extensive parameter $K$ increases, we encounter\ndifferent topological charges and classifications with $(\\omega = +1, -1)$.",

We extract sub-samples of galaxies from a mock catalogue\nrepresentative for the BOSS-CMASS sample, which includes the most massive and\npassively evolving system known today.

Our findings indicate that galaxies in the highest\nstellar and halo mass regimes are least metal-enriched (using Zcold as a proxy)\nand consistently exhibit significantly larger black hole masses and higher\nclustering amplitudes compared to sub-samples selected by e.g. colour or star\nformation rate. This population forms later and also retains large reservoirs\nof cold gas. In contrast, galaxies in the intermediate and lower stellar/halo\nmass regimes consume their cold gas at higher redshift and were among the\nearliest and quickest to assemble. We observe a clear trend where the\nclustering of the galaxies selected according to their Zcold-values (either\nlow-Zcold or high-Zcold) depends on the density of their location within the\nlarge-scale environment.

Deaf and hard-of-hearing (DHH) individuals often rely on facial\nexpressions to supplement sign language to convey emotions, as the use of voice\nis limited. However, in American Sign Language (ASL), these facial expressions\nserve not only emotional purposes but also as linguistic markers, altering sign\nmeanings and often confusing non-signers when interpreting a signer's emotional\nstate. Most existing ASL translation technologies focus solely on signs,\nneglecting the role of emotional facial expressions in the translated output\n(e.g., text, voice). This paper present studies which 1) confirmed the\nchallenges for non-signers of interpreting emotions from facial expressions in\nASL communication, of facial expressions, and 2) how integrating emotional\nvoices into translation systems can enhance hearing individuals' comprehension\nof a signer's emotions. An online survey conducted with 45 hearing participants\n(Non-ASL Signers) revealed that they frequently misinterpret signers' emotions\nwhen emotional and linguistic facial expressions are used simultaneously. The\nfindings indicate that incorporating emotional voice into translation systems\nsignificantly improves the recognition of signers' emotions by 32%.\nAdditionally, further research involving 6 DHH participants discusses design\nconsiderations for the emotional voice feature from both perspectives,\nemphasizing the importance of integrating emotional voices in translation\nsystems to bridge communication gaps between DHH and hearing communities.",

To achieve this, we propose a novel reward function to\nprovide effective and fine-grained rewards and design novel mechanisms to\nbalance exploration and exploitation during learning and enhance the diversity\nof adversarial prompts. Through extensive evaluations, we first show that\nLeakAgent significantly outperforms existing rule-based approaches in training\ndata extraction and automated methods in system prompt leakage. We also\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of LeakAgent in extracting system prompts from\nreal-world applications in OpenAI's GPT Store.

Likewise, for branch class,\nYOLO11m-seg with CBAM achieved the highest precision score value of 0.75 while\nwithout the CBAM, the YOLO11m-seg achieved a precision of 0.73. For dormant\nseason validation, YOLO11x-seg exhibited the highest precision at 0.91.

While recent Bayesian methods have demonstrated\neffectiveness in quantifying uncertainty through low-rank weight updates, they\ntypically require complex fine-tuning or post-training procedures.

We believe that an\neffective T2I evaluation metric should accomplish the following: detect\ninstances where the generated images do not align with the textual prompts, a\ndiscrepancy we define as the `hallucination problem' in T2I tasks; record the\ntypes and frequency of hallucination issues, aiding users in understanding the\ncauses of errors; and provide a comprehensive and intuitive scoring that close\nto human standard. To achieve these objectives, we propose a method based on\nlarge language models (LLMs) for conducting question-answering with an\nextracted scene-graph and created a dataset with human-rated scores for\ngenerated images. From the methodology perspective, we combine\nknowledge-enhanced question-answering tasks with image evaluation tasks, making\nthe evaluation metrics more controllable and easier to interpret.

Probe images used in one-to-many facial identification are often\ncropped from frames of surveillance video and deviate from \"mugshot quality\" in\nvarious ways. This paper systematically explores how the accuracy of\none-to-many facial identification is degraded by the person in the probe image\nchoosing to wear dark sunglasses.

Using a thermodynamically\nconsistent thin-film approach for suspensions on soft elastic surfaces\nsupplemented with biomass production we investigate in silico the role of\nsubstrate softness in the osmotic spreading of biofilms. We show that on soft\nsubstrates with an imposed osmotic pressure spreading is considerably slowed\ndown and may be completely halted depending on the biomass production rate. We\nfind, that the critical slowing down of biofilm spreading on soft surfaces is\ncaused by a reduced osmotic influx of solvent into the biofilm at the edges,\nwhich results from the thermodynamic coupling between substrate deformation and\ninterfacial forces.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive few-shot\nlearning capabilities through in-context learning (ICL). However, ICL\nperformance is highly dependent on the choice of few-shot demonstrations,\nmaking the selection of the most optimal examples a persistent research\nchallenge. This issue is further amplified in low-resource Indic languages,\nwhere the scarcity of ground-truth data complicates the selection process. In\nthis work, we propose PromptRefine, a novel Alternating Minimization approach\nfor example selection that improves ICL performance on low-resource Indic\nlanguages. PromptRefine leverages auxiliary example banks from related\nhigh-resource Indic languages and employs multi-task learning techniques to\nalign language-specific retrievers, enabling effective cross-language\nretrieval. Additionally, we incorporate diversity in the selected examples to\nenhance generalization and reduce bias. Through comprehensive evaluations on\nfour text generation tasks -- Cross-Lingual Question Answering, Multilingual\nQuestion Answering, Machine Translation, and Cross-Lingual Summarization using\nstate-of-the-art LLMs such as LLAMA-3.1-8B, LLAMA-2-7B, Qwen-2-7B, and\nQwen-2.5-7B, we demonstrate that PromptRefine significantly outperforms\nexisting frameworks for retrieving examples.",

A\nmonotone linesearch is then performed to find a new point that improves the\nobjective function relative to the subproblem solution. This approach enhances\nthe performance of DCA. However, if the first DC component is\nnondifferentiable, the BDCA direction may become an ascent direction, rendering\nthe monotone linesearch ineffective. To address this, we propose an Inexact\nnonmonotone Boosted Difference of Convex Algorithm (InmBDCA). This algorithm\nincorporates two main features of inexactness: First, the subproblem therein is\nsolved approximately allowing us for a controlled relative error tolerance in\ndefining the linesearch direction. Second, an inexact nonmonotone linesearch\nscheme is used to determine the step size for the next iteration.

Although carefully designed deblurring and SR models perform well\non these two tasks individually, a unified model that performs jointly RS image\ndeblurring and super-resolution (JRSIDSR) task is still challenging due to the\nvital dilemma of reconstructing the global and local degeneration\nsimultaneously.

AKMD-Net consists of two\nmain branches: deblurring and super-resolution branches. In the deblurring\nbranch, we design a pixel-adjustable kernel block (PAKB) to estimate the local\nand spatial-varying blur kernels. In the SR branch, a multi-domain attention\nblock (MDAB) is proposed to capture the global contextual information enhanced\nwith high-frequency details. Furthermore, we develop an adaptive feature fusion\n(AFF) module to model the contextual relationships between the deblurring and\nSR branches. Finally, we design an adaptive Wiener loss (AW Loss) to depress\nthe prior noise in the reconstructed images. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat the proposed AKMD-Net achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) quantitative and\nqualitative performance on commonly used RS image datasets.

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a pivotal technique for 3D scene\nrepresentation, providing rapid rendering speeds and high fidelity. As 3DGS\ngains prominence, safeguarding its intellectual property becomes increasingly\ncrucial since 3DGS could be used to imitate unauthorized scene creations and\nraise copyright issues. Existing watermarking methods for implicit NeRFs cannot\nbe directly applied to 3DGS due to its explicit representation and real-time\nrendering process, leaving watermarking for 3DGS largely unexplored. In\nresponse, we propose WATER-GS, a novel method designed to protect 3DGS\ncopyrights through a universal watermarking strategy. First, we introduce a\npre-trained watermark decoder, treating raw 3DGS generative modules as\npotential watermark encoders to ensure imperceptibility. Additionally, we\nimplement novel 3D distortion layers to enhance the robustness of the embedded\nwatermark against common real-world distortions of point cloud data.\nComprehensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that WATER-GS\neffectively embeds imperceptible and robust watermarks into 3DGS without\ncompromising rendering efficiency and quality. Our experiments indicate that\nthe 3D distortion layers can yield up to a 20% improvement in accuracy rate.\nNotably, our method is adaptable to different 3DGS variants, including 3DGS\ncompression frameworks and 2D Gaussian splatting.",

A diffusion model then generates images based on\nthe user's input image and the derived artistic style descriptions. The video\ngeneration stage utilises the same diffusion model to interpolate frames,\ncontrolled by audio energy vectors derived from key musical features of\nharmonics and percussives. The method demonstrates promising results across\nvarious genres, and a new metric, Audio-Visual Synchrony (AVS), is introduced\nto quantitatively evaluate the synchronisation between visual and audio\nelements. Comparative analysis shows significantly higher AVS values for videos\ngenerated using the proposed method with audio energy vectors, compared to\nlinear interpolation.

    "abstract": "The rise in energy demand highlights the importance of suitable subsurface\nstorage, requiring detailed and accurate subsurface characterization often\nreliant on high-quality borehole well log data. However, obtaining complete\nwell-log data is costly and time-consuming, with missing data being common due\nto borehole conditions or tool errors. While machine learning and deep learning\nalgorithms have been implemented to address these issues, they often fail to\ncapture the intricate, nonlinear relationships and long-term dependencies in\ncomplex well log sequences. Additionally, prior AI-driven models typically\nrequire retraining when introduced to new datasets and are constrained to\ndeployment in the same basin.\n  In this study, we explored and evaluated the potential of a time-series\nfoundation model leveraging transformer architecture and a generative\npre-trained approach for predicting and detecting anomalies in borehole well\nlog data. Specifically, we fine-tuned and adopted the TimeGPT architecture to\nforecast key log responses and detect anomalies with high accuracy. Our\nproposed model demonstrated excellent performance, achieving R2 of up to 87%\nand a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) as low as 1.95%. Additionally, the\nmodel's zero-shot capability successfully identified subtle yet critical\nanomalies, such as drilling hazards or unexpected geological formations, with\nan overall accuracy of 93%.\n  The model represents a significant advancement in predictive accuracy and\ncomputational efficiency, enabling zero-shot inference through fine-tuning. Its\napplication in well-log prediction enhances operational decision-making while\nreducing risks associated with subsurface exploration.

The analysis explores both \"capability-modifying\ninterventions\" (CMIs) that shape how AI develops, and \"adaptation\ninterventions\" (ADIs) that help society adjust. Key interventions analyzed\ninclude steering AI development toward human-complementing capabilities,\nimplementing human-in-the-loop requirements, taxation of automation,\ncomprehensive reorientation of education, and both material and social\nsubstitutes for work.

The proposed framework employs a novel scaled pseudo-Huber (SPH)\nloss function, which smooths the well-known Huber loss, effectively balancing\nquadratic ($\\ell_2$) and absolute linear ($\\ell_1$) loss behaviors. This\nflexibility enables the framework to accommodate both thin-tailed and\nheavy-tailed data efficiently. The generalized Bayesian approach constructs a\nworking likelihood based on the SPH loss, facilitating efficient and stable\nestimation while providing rigorous uncertainty quantification for all model\nparameters. Notably, this approach allows formal statistical inference without\nrequiring ad hoc tuning parameter selection while adaptively addressing a wide\nrange of tail behavior in the errors. By specifying appropriate prior\ndistributions for the regression coefficients--such as ridge priors for small\nor moderate-dimensional settings and spike-and-slab priors for high-dimensional\nsettings--the framework ensures principled inference. We establish rigorous\ntheoretical guarantees for accurate parameter estimation and correct predictor\nselection under sparsity assumptions for a wide range of data generating\nsetups.

To tackle these issues, we propose\nBREAK, a broad-range semantics model for fake news detection that leverages a\nfully connected graph to capture comprehensive semantics while employing dual\ndenoising modules to minimize both structural and feature noise. The semantic\nstructure denoising module balances the graph's connectivity by iteratively\nrefining it between two bounds: a sequence-based structure as a lower bound and\na fully connected graph as the upper bound. This refinement uncovers\nlabel-relevant semantic interrelations structures. Meanwhile, the semantic\nfeature denoising module reduces noise from similar semantics by diversifying\nrepresentations, aligning distinct outputs from the denoised graph and sequence\nencoders using KL-divergence to achieve feature diversification in\nhigh-dimensional space. The two modules are jointly optimized in a bi-level\nframework, enhancing the integration of denoised semantics into a comprehensive\nrepresentation for detection. Extensive experiments across four datasets\ndemonstrate that BREAK significantly outperforms existing fake news detection\nmethods.",

We studied the full width at\nhalf maximum and optical depth of the lines in order to constrain the emission\norigin. We calculated the expected velocities from MA as well as gas in\nKeplerian orbit for our sources. All five sources have SEDs consistent with\nyoung intermediate-mass stars. We classified three of these sources as Herbig\nAe type stars based on their $T_{eff}$. Hydrogen lines with high upper energy\nlevels $n_{up}$ tend to be significantly broader than lines with a lower\n$n_{up}$. The optical depth of the emission lines is also highest for the\nhigh-velocity component of each line, and it becomes optically thin in the\nlow-velocity component. Emission from magneto-centrifugal winds is not\nconsistent with any of our observations. Two sources are consistent with\nemission from a Keplerian disc, or MA. The remaining three sources are only\nconsistent with emission from MA. In the future, this approach can be applied\nto more statistically significant samples of Herbig AeBe spectra, including\nexisting archival observations.",

    "abstract": "Neural networks are a group of neurons stacked together in multiple layers to\nmimic the biological neurons in a human brain. Neural networks have been\ntrained using the backpropagation algorithm based on gradient descent strategy\nfor several decades. Several variants have been developed to improve the\nbackpropagation algorithm. The loss function for the neural network is\noptimized through backpropagation, but several local minima exist in the\nmanifold of the constructed neural network. We obtain several solutions\nmatching the minima. The gradient descent strategy cannot avoid the problem of\nlocal minima and gets stuck in the minima due to the initialization. Particle\nswarm optimization (PSO) was proposed to select the best local minima among the\nsearch space of the loss function. The search space is limited to the\ninstantiated particles in the PSO algorithm, and sometimes it cannot select the\nbest solution. In the proposed approach, we overcome the problem of gradient\ndescent and the limitation of the PSO algorithm by training individual neurons\nseparately, capable of collectively solving the problem as a group of neurons\nforming a network.

    "abstract": "In financial applications, we often observe both global and local factors\nthat are modeled by a multi-level factor model. When detecting unknown local\ngroup memberships under such a model, employing a covariance matrix as an\nadjacency matrix for local group memberships is inadequate due to the\npredominant effect of global factors. Thus, to detect a local group structure\nmore effectively, this study introduces an inverse covariance matrix-based\nfinancial adjacency matrix (IFAM) that utilizes negative values of the inverse\ncovariance matrix. We show that IFAM ensures that the edge density between\ndifferent groups vanishes, while that within the same group remains\nnon-vanishing. This reduces falsely detected connections and helps identify\nlocal group membership accurately. To estimate IFAM under the multi-level\nfactor model, we introduce a factor-adjusted GLASSO estimator to address the\nprevalent global factor effect in the inverse covariance matrix. An empirical\nstudy using returns from international stocks across 20 financial markets\ndemonstrates that incorporating IFAM effectively detects latent local groups,\nwhich helps improve the minimum variance portfolio allocation performance.",

In this\nregime, we also find that such DM is typically heavy and warm today. We study\nseparately the cases of weakly and strongly coupled dark sectors, where, in the\nlatter case, we focus on glueball DM, which turns out to have very distinct\nphenomenological properties.

For\nfurther understanding, we study hidden dimension sparsity and observe that\ntrained Transformers utilize only a small fraction of token dimensions,\nrevealing an \"activation flow\" pattern. Notably, there are shared\nsub-dimensions with sustained activation across multiple consecutive tokens and\nspecialized sub-dimensions uniquely activated for each token. To better model\ntoken-relevant sub-dimensions, we propose MoHD (Mixture of Hidden Dimensions),\na sparse conditional activation architecture.

To mitigate potential information loss\nfrom sparsity, we design activation scaling and group fusion mechanisms to\npreserve activation flow. In this way, MoHD expands hidden dimensions with\nnegligible increases in computation or parameters, efficient training and\ninference while maintaining performance. Evaluations across 10 NLP tasks show\nthat MoHD surpasses Vanilla Transformers in parameter efficiency and task\nperformance. It achieves 1.7% higher performance with 50% fewer activation\nparameters and 3.7% higher performance with a 3x parameter expansion at\nconstant activation cost.

The compressive region spreads along the fluid interface at a\nlengthscale that increases faster than the width of the fluid interface with\ntemperature, while the width of the slip region is bound by the oscillatory\nfluid density structure and is constrained to a few particle diameters from the\nwall.

    "abstract": "Hypergraph is a data structure that enables us to model higher-order\nassociations among data entities. Conventional graph-structured data can\nrepresent pairwise relationships only, whereas hypergraph enables us to\nassociate any number of entities, which is essential in many real-life\napplications. Hypergraph learning algorithms have been well-studied for\nnumerous problem settings, such as node classification, link prediction, etc.\nHowever, much less research has been conducted on anomaly detection from\nhypergraphs. Anomaly detection identifies events that deviate from the usual\npattern and can be applied to hypergraphs to detect unusual higher-order\nassociations. In this work, we propose an end-to-end hypergraph neural\nnetwork-based model for identifying anomalous associations in a hypergraph. Our\nproposed algorithm operates in an unsupervised manner without requiring any\nlabeled data. Extensive experimentation on several real-life datasets\ndemonstrates the effectiveness of our model in detecting anomalous hyperedges.",

    "abstract": "This paper aims to design a Privacy-aware Client Sampling framework in\nFederated learning, named FedPCS, to tackle the heterogeneous client sampling\nissues and improve model performance. First, we obtain a pioneering upper bound\nfor the accuracy loss of the FL model with privacy-aware client sampling\nprobabilities. Based on this, we model the interactions between the central\nserver and participating clients as a two-stage Stackelberg game. In Stage I,\nthe central server designs the optimal time-dependent reward for cost\nminimization by considering the trade-off between the accuracy loss of the FL\nmodel and the rewards allocated. In Stage II, each client determines the\ncorrection factor that dynamically adjusts its privacy budget based on the\nreward allocated to maximize its utility. To surmount the obstacle of\napproximating other clients' private information, we introduce the mean-field\nestimator to estimate the average privacy budget. We analytically demonstrate\nthe existence and convergence of the fixed point for the mean-field estimator\nand derive the Stackelberg Nash Equilibrium to obtain the optimal strategy\nprofile. By rigorously theoretical convergence analysis, we guarantee the\nrobustness of FedPCS. Moreover, considering the conventional sampling strategy\nin privacy-preserving FL, we prove that the random sampling approach's PoA can\nbe arbitrarily large. To remedy such efficiency loss, we show that the proposed\nprivacy-aware client sampling strategy successfully reduces PoA, which is upper\nbounded by a reachable constant. To address the challenge of varying privacy\nrequirements throughout different training phases in FL, we extend our model\nand analysis and derive the adaptive optimal sampling ratio for the central\nserver. Experimental results on different datasets demonstrate the superiority\nof FedPCS compared with the existing SOTA FL strategies under IID and Non-IID\ndatasets.",

Combining structural magnetic resonance\nimaging (sMRI) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has the\npotential to improve brain age estimation by leveraging complementary data.\nHowever, fMRI data, being noisier than sMRI, complicates multimodal fusion.\nTraditional fusion methods often introduce more noise than useful information,\nwhich can reduce accuracy compared to using sMRI alone.

Specifically, we\ndecompose the latent space into modality-specific codes and shared codes to\nrepresent complementary and common information across modalities, respectively.\nTo enhance the disentanglement, we introduce cross-reconstruction and\nshared-distinct distance ratio loss as regularization terms.

DP steel,\ncomposed of a soft ferritic phase and a hard martensitic phase, shows\nmechanical properties that are significantly influenced by ferrite grain size.\nThe mechanism underlying this grain size effect is clarified by analyzing the\npartitioning and distribution of stress, strain, and dislocations in each\nphase. Three models with the same volume fraction of martensitic phase but\ndifferent ferrite grain sizes are subjected to tensile loading. Interestingly,\neven though only the ferrite grain size is changed, the stress in the\nmartensitic phase exhibited a notable dependence on ferrite grain size. This\ncan be explained as follows. Geometrically necessary (GN) dislocations\naccumulate on the ferrite side of the ferrite-martensite grain boundary, and\nthe grain boundary occupancy per unit area increases as the ferrite grain size\ndecreases. As a result, smaller ferrite grain sizes make the ferritic phase\nless deformable owing to the effect of GN dislocations, shifting more\ndeformation to the martensitic phase. This behavior is confirmed by the more\nuniform strain distribution and partitioning observed with decreasing ferrite\ngrain size. As the martensitic phase takes on greater deformation, the\nstatistically stored dislocation density in the martensitic phase becomes\nferrite grain size dependent, which in turn leads to the observed grain size\ndependence of stress in the martensitic phase.",

Second, the learnable mixing adaptively allocates model capacity\nacross timesteps, thereby effectively improving generation quality.

    "abstract": "This paper presents an estimation approach within the framework of uplink\nmassive machine-type communications (mMTC) that considers the energy\nlimitations of the devices. We focus on a scenario where a group of sensors\nobserve a set of parameters and send the measured information to a collector\nnode (CN). The CN is responsible for estimating the original observations,\nwhich are spatially correlated and corrupted by measurement and quantization\nnoise. Given the use of Gaussian sources, the minimum mean squared error (MSE)\nestimation is employed and, when considering temporal evolution, the use of\nKalman filters is studied. Based on that, we propose a device selection\nstrategy to reduce the number of active sensors and a quantization scheme with\nadjustable number of bits to minimize the overall payload. The set of selected\nsensors and quantization levels are, thus, designed to minimize the MSE. For a\nmore realistic analysis, communication errors are also included by averaging\nthe MSE over the error decoding probabilities. We evaluate the performance of\nour strategy in a practical mMTC system with synthetic and real databases.\nSimulation results show that the optimization of the payload and the set of\nactive devices can reduce the power consumption without compromising the\nestimation accuracy.",

However, unlike\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) that can learn multiple tasks in a single model\nbased on instructed data, diffusion models always require additional branches,\ntask-specific training strategies, and losses for effective adaptation to\ndifferent downstream tasks. This task-specific fine-tuning approach brings two\ndrawbacks. 1) The task-specific additional networks create gaps between\npretraining and fine-tuning which hinders the transfer of pretrained knowledge.\n2) It necessitates careful additional network design, raising the barrier to\nlearning and implementation, and making it less user-friendly. Thus, a question\narises: Can we achieve a simple, efficient, and general approach to fine-tune\ndiffusion models? To this end, we propose ONE-PIC. It enhances the inherited\ngenerative ability in the pretrained diffusion models without introducing\nadditional modules. Specifically, we propose In-Visual-Context Tuning, which\nconstructs task-specific training data by arranging source images and target\nimages into a single image. This approach makes downstream fine-tuning closer\nto the pertaining, allowing our model to adapt more quickly to various\ndownstream tasks. Moreover, we propose a Masking Strategy to unify different\ngenerative tasks. This strategy transforms various downstream fine-tuning tasks\ninto predictions of the masked portions. The extensive experimental results\ndemonstrate that our method is simple and efficient which streamlines the\nadaptation process and achieves excellent performance with lower costs.

    "abstract": "In the current fast-paced digital environment, enterprises are striving to\noffer a seamless and integrated customer experience across multiple\ntouchpoints. This improved experience often leads to higher conversion rates\nand increased customer loyalty. To deliver such an experience, enterprises must\nthink beyond the traditional boundaries of their architecture. The architecture\nof the digital ecosystem is expanding and becoming more complex, achieved\neither by developing advanced features in-house or by integrating with\nthird-party solutions, thus extending the boundaries of the enterprise\narchitecture. This complexity poses significant challenges for both\nobservability and security in a digital ecosystem, both of which are essential\nfor maintaining robust and resilient systems. Observability entails monitoring\nand understanding the internal state of a system through logging, tracing, and\nmetrics collection, allowing organizations to diagnose performance issues and\ndetect anomalies in real time. Meanwhile, security is focused on protecting\nsensitive data and ensuring service integrity by defending against threats and\nvulnerabilities. The data collected through these observability practices can\nbe analyzed to identify patterns and detect potential security threats or data\nleaks. This paper examines the interconnections between observability and\nsecurity within digital ecosystem architectures, emphasizing how improved\nobservability can strengthen security measures. The paper also discusses\nstudies conducted in the AI/ML field aimed at enhancing security through the\nuse of observability. These studies explore how advanced machine learning\ntechniques can be applied to observability data to improve security measures\nand detect anomalies more effectively.",

This unique condition enables the formation\nof wave modes that are not only highly localized in space and inherently\nnon-propagative-protected by the flatness of the dispersion relation-but also\nexceptionally sensitive to structural variations due to enhanced wave-structure\ninteraction. These features are first explored on a simple spring-mass lattice\nand later applied to a microelectromechanical (MEMS) system of oscillators. By\nexploring the role of flat-band dispersion in mechanics, this work provides new\ninsights into their fundamental dynamics while opening new opportunities for\napplications in vibration control and the sensitivity analysis of mechanical\nstructures.",

However, fitting\nmulti-component models to SEDs and recovering accurate stellar parameters\nremains challenging due to nonlinear fitting methods and inherent uncertainties\nin the data and the spectral models. In this work, a simplified approach was\nused to model stars as blackbodies and we tested the accuracy of parameter\nrecovery from SEDs, particularly focusing on secondary stars. We explored a\nrange of primary properties, filter sets and noise models. Special attention\nwas given to two case studies: one examining the detection of unresolved\nbinaries using Gaia XP spectra, and the other focusing on identifying hotter\ncompanions in binary systems using UV-IR SEDs. Although an analytic\nprescription for recoverability is not possible, we present a simplified model\nand the necessary Python tools to analyse any potential binary system.

Motivated by this result, we propose a class of {\\bf\nS}trategic {\\bf M}onte {\\bf C}arlo {\\bf O}ptimization (SMCO) algorithms, which\nuses a simple strategy that makes coordinate-wise two-armed decisions based on\nthe signs of the partial gradient of the original function being optimized over\n(without the need of solving PDEs). While this simple strategy is not generally\noptimal, we show that it is sufficient for our SMCO algorithm to converge to\nlocal optimizer(s) from a single starting point, and to global optimizers under\na growing set of starting points. Numerical studies demonstrate the suitability\nof our SMCO algorithms for global optimization, and illustrate the promise of\nour theoretical framework and practical approach. For a wide range of test\nfunctions with challenging optimization landscapes (including ReLU neural\nnetworks with square and hinge loss), our SMCO algorithms converge to the\nglobal maximum accurately and robustly, using only a small set of starting\npoints (at most 100 for dimensions up to 1000) and a small maximum number of\niterations (200).

We propose an\nalternative approach focused on training multi-species individual\nidentification (re-id) models. We construct a dataset that includes 49 species,\n37K individual animals, and 225K images, using this data to train a single\nembedding network for all species. Our model employs an EfficientNetV2 backbone\nand a sub-center ArcFace loss function with dynamic margins. We evaluate the\nperformance of this multispecies model in several ways. Most notably, we\ndemonstrate that it consistently outperforms models trained separately on each\nspecies, achieving an average gain of 12.5% in top-1 accuracy. Furthermore, the\nmodel demonstrates strong zero-shot performance and fine-tuning capabilities\nfor new species with limited training data, enabling effective curation of new\nspecies through both incremental addition of data to the training set and\nfine-tuning without the original data.

The monolayer Janus Nb2SeTeO exhibits a\nmutipizeo effect with a large out-of-plane piezoelectricity and piezovalley\neffect with large valley polarization. The piezovalley effect is induced by the\nuniaxial strain effect in different directions, which contributes the anomalous\nvalley Hall effect (AVHE) in the AM system. Moreover, the compressive uniaxial\nstrain could induce the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) in the AM system,\nwhere the chirality of the dissipationless topological edge states could be\nmanipulated by the direction of uniaxial strain. These manifest topological\nphase transitions could be realized via the piezovalley effect in the AM\nsystem.

    "abstract": "The concept of function and affordance is a critical aspect of 3D scene\nunderstanding and supports task-oriented objectives. In this work, we develop a\nmodel that learns to structure and vary functional affordance across a 3D\nhierarchical scene graph representing the spatial organization of a scene. The\nvarying functional affordance is designed to integrate with the varying spatial\ncontext of the graph. More specifically, we develop an algorithm that learns to\nconstruct a 3D hierarchical scene graph (3DHSG) that captures the spatial\norganization of the scene. Starting from segmented object point clouds and\nobject semantic labels, we develop a 3DHSG with a top node that identifies the\nroom label, child nodes that define local spatial regions inside the room with\nregion-specific affordances, and grand-child nodes indicating object locations\nand object-specific affordances. To support this work, we create a custom 3DHSG\ndataset that provides ground truth data for local spatial regions with\nregion-specific affordances and also object-specific affordances for each\nobject. We employ a transformer-based model to learn the 3DHSG. We use a\nmulti-task learning framework that learns both room classification and learns\nto define spatial regions within the room with region-specific affordances. Our\nwork improves on the performance of state-of-the-art baseline models and shows\none approach for applying transformer models to 3D scene understanding and the\ngeneration of 3DHSGs that capture the spatial organization of a room.

    "abstract": "Quantum computing has long promised to revolutionize the way we solve complex\nproblems. At the same time, tensor networks are widely used across various\nfields due to their computational efficiency and capacity to represent\nintricate systems. While both technologies can address similar problems, the\nprimary aim of this thesis is not to compare them. Such comparison would be\nunfair, as quantum devices are still in an early stage, whereas tensor network\nalgorithms represent the state-of-the-art in quantum simulation. Instead, we\nexplore a potential synergy between these technologies, focusing on how two\nflagship algorithms from each paradigm, the Density Matrix Renormalization\nGroup (DMRG) and quantum annealing, might collaborate in the future.\nFurthermore, a significant challenge in the DMRG algorithm is identifying an\nappropriate tensor network representation for the quantum system under study.\nThe representation commonly used is called Matrix Product Operator (MPO), and\nit is notoriously difficult to obtain for certain systems. This thesis outlines\nan approach to this problem using finite automata, which we apply to construct\nthe MPO for our case study. Finally, we present a practical application of this\nframework through the quadratic knapsack problem (QKP). Despite its apparent\nsimplicity, the QKP is a fundamental problem in computer science with numerous\npractical applications. In addition to quantum annealing and the DMRG\nalgorithm, we implement a dynamic programming approach to evaluate the quality\nof our results. Our results highlight the power of tensor networks and the\npotential of quantum annealing for solving optimization problems. Moreover,\nthis thesis is designed to be self-explanatory, ensuring that readers with a\nsolid mathematical background can fully understand the content without prior\nknowledge of quantum mechanics.",

Many such methods, however,\nrequire large numbers of simulation samples and face difficulty scaling to\nhigh-dimensional settings, often making inference prohibitive under\nresource-intensive simulators.

However, a limitation arises from their exclusive\nhandling of single-speaker speech input, making them ineffective in recognizing\nmulti-speaker overlapped speech, a common occurrence in real-world scenarios.\nIn this study, we delve into the adaptation of speech foundation models to\neliminate interfering speakers from overlapping speech and perform\ntarget-speaker automatic speech recognition (TS-ASR). Initially, we utilize the\nWhisper model as the foundation for adaptation and conduct a thorough\ncomparison of its integration with existing target-speaker adaptation\ntechniques. We then propose an innovative model termed Speaker-Querying Whisper\n(SQ-Whisper), which employs a set number of trainable queries to capture\nspeaker prompts from overlapping speech based on target-speaker enrollment.\nThese prompts serve to steer the model in extracting speaker-specific features\nand accurately recognizing target-speaker transcriptions. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our approach effectively adapts the pre-trained speech\nfoundation model to TS-ASR. Compared with the robust TS-HuBERT model, the\nproposed SQ-Whisper significantly improves performance, yielding up to 15% and\n10% relative reductions in word error rates (WERs) on the Libri2Mix and\nWSJ0-2Mix datasets, respectively.

    "abstract": "Channel estimation is a fundamental task in communication systems and is\ncritical for effective demodulation. While most works deal with a simple\nscenario where the measurements are corrupted by the additive white Gaussian\nnoise (AWGN), this work addresses the more challenging scenario where both AWGN\nand structured interference coexist. Such conditions arise, for example, when a\nsonar/radar transmitter and a communication receiver operate simultaneously\nwithin the same bandwidth. To ensure accurate channel estimation in these\nscenarios, the sparsity of the channel in the delay domain and the complicate\nstructure of the interference are jointly exploited. Firstly, the score of the\nstructured interference is learned via a neural network based on the diffusion\nmodel (DM), while the channel prior is modeled as a Gaussian distribution, with\nits variance controlling channel sparsity, similar to the setup of the sparse\nBayesian learning (SBL). Then, two efficient posterior sampling methods are\nproposed to jointly estimate the sparse channel and the interference. Nuisance\nparameters, such as the variance of the prior are estimated via the expectation\nmaximization (EM) algorithm. The proposed method is termed as DM based SBL\n(DM-SBL). Numerical simulations demonstrate that DM-SBL significantly\noutperforms conventional approaches that deal with the AWGN scenario,\nparticularly under low signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) conditions. Beyond\nchannel estimation, DM-SBL also shows promise for addressing other linear\ninverse problems involving structured interference.",

The corresponding Hamilton\nequations are defined, and the most general form of the third- and fourth-order\ninteraction Hamiltonians is written out in terms of the normal boson field\nvariables and hard momentum modes of the quark-gluon plasma. The canonical\ntransformations involving both bosonic and hard mode degrees of freedom of the\nsystem under consideration, are discussed. The canonicity conditions for these\ntransformations based on the Poisson superbracket, are derived.

However, most existing pre-trained SMILES LMs focus solely on the\nsingle-token level supervision during pre-training, failing to fully leverage\nthe substructural information of molecules. This limitation makes the\npre-training task overly simplistic, preventing the models from capturing\nricher molecular semantic information. Moreover, during pre-training, these\nSMILES LMs only process corrupted SMILES inputs, never encountering any valid\nSMILES, which leads to a train-inference mismatch. To address these challenges,\nwe propose SMI-Editor, a novel edit-based pre-trained SMILES LM. SMI-Editor\ndisrupts substructures within a molecule at random and feeds the resulting\nSMILES back into the model, which then attempts to restore the original SMILES\nthrough an editing process. This approach not only introduces fragment-level\ntraining signals, but also enables the use of valid SMILES as inputs, allowing\nthe model to learn how to reconstruct complete molecules from these incomplete\nstructures. As a result, the model demonstrates improved scalability and an\nenhanced ability to capture fragment-level molecular information.

    "abstract": "In 1977, Lenstra provided a criterion for norm-Euclideanity of number fields\nand noted that this criterion becomes ineffective for number fields of large\nenough degrees under the Generalised Riemann Hypothesis (GRH) for the Dedekind\nzeta-functions. In the first part of the paper, we provide an explicit version\nof this statement: the Lenstra criterion becomes ineffective under GRH for all\nnumber fields $K$ of degrees $n \\geq 62238$. This follows from combining the\ncriterion assumption with the explicit lower bound for the discriminant of $K$\nunder GRH, and the (trivial) upper bound for the minimal proper ideal norm in\n$\\mathcal{O}_K$.\n  Unconditionally, the lower bound for the discriminant is too weak to lead to\nsuch a contradiction. However, GRH can be replaced by another condition on the\nDedekind zeta functions $\\zeta_K$, a (potential) lower bound for $\\zeta_K$ at a\npoint on the right of $s = 1$. This condition combined with Zimmert's approach\nimply stronger upper bounds for the minimal proper ideal norm and again,\ncontradicts to Lenstra's criterion for all $n$ large enough. The advantage of\nthe new potential condition on $\\zeta_K$ is that it can be computationally\nchecked for number fields of not too large degrees.",

We propose a new classification method based on\nConvolutional Neural Networks and adopt a sample including 3774 GRBs observed\nby Fermi-GBM to address the $T_\\text{90}$ overlap problem. By using count maps\nthat incorporate both temporal and spectral features as inputs, we successfully\nclassify 593 overlapping events into two distinct categories, thereby refuting\nthe existence of an intermediate GRB class. Additionally, we apply the optimal\nmodel to extract features from the count maps and visualized the extracted GRB\nfeatures using the t-SNE algorithm, discovering two distinct clusters\ncorresponding to S-type and L-type GRBs. To further investigate the physical\nproperties of these two types of bursts, we conduct a time-integrated spectral\nanalysis and discovered significant differences in their spectral\ncharacteristics. The analysis also show that most GRBs associated with\nkilonovae belong to the S-type, while those associated with supernovae are\npredominantly L-type, with few exceptions. Additionally, the duration\ncharacteristics of short bursts with extended emission suggest that they may\nmanifest as either L-type or S-type GRBs.

    "abstract": "Research on loss surface geometry, such as Sharpness-Aware Minimization\n(SAM), shows that flatter minima improve generalization. Recent studies further\nreveal that flatter minima can also reduce the domain generalization (DG) gap.\nHowever, existing flatness-based DG techniques predominantly operate within a\nfull-precision training process, which is impractical for deployment on\nresource-constrained edge devices that typically rely on lower bit-width\nrepresentations (e.g., 4 bits, 3 bits). Consequently, low-precision\nquantization-aware training is critical for optimizing these techniques in\nreal-world applications. In this paper, we observe a significant degradation in\nperformance when applying state-of-the-art DG-SAM methods to quantized models,\nsuggesting that current approaches fail to preserve generalizability during the\nlow-precision training process. To address this limitation, we propose a novel\nGradient-Adaptive Quantization-Aware Training (GAQAT) framework for DG. Our\napproach begins by identifying the scale-gradient conflict problem in\nlow-precision quantization, where the task loss and smoothness loss induce\nconflicting gradients for the scaling factors of quantizers, with certain\nlayers exhibiting opposing gradient directions. This conflict renders the\noptimization of quantized weights highly unstable. To mitigate this, we further\nintroduce a mechanism to quantify gradient inconsistencies and selectively\nfreeze the gradients of scaling factors, thereby stabilizing the training\nprocess and enhancing out-of-domain generalization. Extensive experiments\nvalidate the effectiveness of the proposed GAQAT framework. On PACS, our 3-bit\nand 4-bit models outperform direct DG-QAT integration by up to 4.5%. On\nDomainNet, the 4-bit model achieves near-lossless performance compared to full\nprecision, with improvements of 1.39% (4-bit) and 1.06% (3-bit) over the SOTA\nQAT baseline.",

Three-dimensional direct numerical\nsimulations were performed for Rayleigh numbers in the range $10^6 \\leq Ra \\leq\n10^8$, a Prandtl number $Pr = 0.71$ and a bulk Reynolds number $Re_b \\approx\n5623$. We found that high-frequency wall temperature oscillations had minimal\nimpact on flow structures, while low-frequency oscillations induced adaptive\nchanges, forming stable stratified layers during cooling. Proper orthogonal\ndecomposition (POD) analysis revealed a dominant streamwise unidirectional\nshear flow mode. Large-scale rolls oriented in the streamwise direction\nappeared as higher POD modes and were significantly influenced by\nlower-frequency wall temperature variations. Long-time-averaged statistics\nshowed that the Nusselt number increased with decreasing frequency by up to\n96\\%, while the friction coefficient varied by less than 15\\%. High-frequency\nmodulation predominantly influenced near-wall regions, enhancing convective\neffects, whereas low frequencies reduced these effects via stable stratified\nlayer formation. Phase-averaged statistics showed that high-frequency\nmodulation resulted in phase-stable streamwise velocity and temperature\nprofiles, while low-frequency modulation caused significant variations due to\nweakened turbulence. Turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) profiles remained high near\nthe wall during both heating and cooling at high frequency, but decreased\nduring cooling at low frequencies. A TKE budget analysis revealed that during\nheating, TKE production was dominated by shear near the wall and by buoyancy in\nthe bulk region; while during cooling, the production, distribution and\ndissipation of TKE were all nearly zero.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising\nperformance in sequential recommendation tasks, leveraging their superior\nlanguage understanding capabilities. However, existing LLM-based recommendation\napproaches predominantly focus on modeling item-level co-occurrence patterns\nwhile failing to adequately capture user-level personalized preferences. This\nis problematic since even users who display similar behavioral patterns (e.g.,\nclicking or purchasing similar items) may have fundamentally different\nunderlying interests. To alleviate this problem, in this paper, we propose\nULMRec, a framework that effectively integrates user personalized preferences\ninto LLMs for sequential recommendation. Considering there has the semantic gap\nbetween item IDs and LLMs, we replace item IDs with their corresponding titles\nin user historical behaviors, enabling the model to capture the item semantics.\nFor integrating the user personalized preference, we design two key components:\n(1) user indexing: a personalized user indexing mechanism that leverages vector\nquantization on user reviews and user IDs to generate meaningful and unique\nuser representations, and (2) alignment tuning: an alignment-based tuning stage\nthat employs comprehensive preference alignment tasks to enhance the model's\ncapability in capturing personalized information. Through this design, ULMRec\nachieves deep integration of language semantics with user personalized\npreferences, facilitating effective adaptation to recommendation. Extensive\nexperiments on two public datasets demonstrate that ULMRec significantly\noutperforms existing methods, validating the effectiveness of our approach.",

Central to this\nexploration is the effective visualization of stability regimes, which enables\nthe interpretation of how systems evolve under varying conditions. While the\narea-preserving quadratic H\\'enon map has received significant theoretical\nattention, a comprehensive description of its mixed parameter-space dynamics\nremain lacking. This limitation arises from early attempts to reduce the full\ntwo-dimensional phase space to a one-dimensional projection, a simplification\nthat resulted in the loss of important dynamical features. Consequently, there\nis a clear need for a more thorough understanding of the underlying qualitative\naspects.\n  This paper aims to address this gap by revisiting the foundational concepts\nof reversibility and associated symmetries, first explored in the early works\nof G.D. Birkhoff. We extend the original framework proposed by H\\'enon by\nadding a period-doubling diagram to his isochronous diagram, which allows to\nrepresents the system's bifurcations and the groups of symmetric periodic\norbits that emerge in typical bifurcations of the fixed point. A qualitative\nand quantitative explanation of the main features of the region of parameters\nwith bounded motion is provided, along with the application of this technique\nto other symplectic mappings, including cases of multiple reversibility. Modern\nchaos indicators, such as the Reversibility Error Method and the Generalized\nAlignment Index, are employed to distinguish between various dynamical regimes\nin the mixed space of variables and parameters.

This leads to that the $L^p$-strong convergence order of\na numerical scheme will vanish as $p$ increases to infinity if the temporal\nH\\\"older continuity of the solution process is directly used. A natural\nquestion arises: can one obtain the $L^p$-strong convergence order that does\nnot depend on $p$? In this paper, we provide a positive answer for fully\ndiscrete schemes of the stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) driven\nby L\\'evy noise. Two cases are considered: the first is the linear\nmultiplicative Poisson noise with $\\nu(\\chi)<\\infty$ and the second is the\nadditive Poisson noise with $\\nu(\\chi)\\leq\\infty$, where $\\nu$ is the L\\'evy\nmeasure and $\\chi$ is the mark set.

The spectrum is molecule-rich and dominated by\nhydrocarbons. We detect 14 molecular species (H$_2$, CH$_3$, CH$_4$,\nC$_2$H$_2$, $^{13}$CCH$_2$, C$_2$H$_4$, C$_2$H$_6$, C$_3$H$_4$, C$_4$H$_2$,\nC$_6$H$_6$, HCN, HC$_3$N, CO$_2$ and $^{13}$CO$_2$) and 2 atomic lines ([Ne II]\nand [Ar II]), all observed for the first time in a disk at this age. The\ndetection of spatially unresolved H$_2$ and Ne gas strongly supports that\nJ0446B hosts a long-lived primordial disk, rather than a debris disk. The\nmarginal H$_2$O detection and the high C$_2$H$_2$/CO$_2$ column density ratio\nindicate that the inner disk of J0446B has a very carbon-rich chemistry, with a\ngas-phase C/O ratio $\\gtrsim$2, consistent with what have been found in most\nprimordial disks around similarly low-mass stars. In the absence of significant\nouter disk dust substructures, inner disks are expected to first become\nwater-rich due to the rapid inward drift of icy pebbles, and evolve into\ncarbon-rich as outer disk gas flows inward on longer timescales. The faint\nmillimeter emission in such low-mass star disks implies that they may have\ndepleted their outer icy pebble reservoir early and already passed the\nwater-rich phase. Models with pebble drift and volatile transport suggest that\nmaintaining a carbon-rich chemistry for tens of Myr likely requires a slowly\nevolving disk with $\\alpha-$viscosity $\\lesssim10^{-4}$.

    "abstract": "Urban flow prediction is a classic spatial-temporal forecasting task that\nestimates the amount of future traffic flow for a given location. Though models\nrepresented by Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) have established\nthemselves as capable predictors, they tend to suffer from distribution shifts\nthat are common with the urban flow data due to the dynamics and\nunpredictability of spatial-temporal events. Unfortunately, in spatial-temporal\napplications, the dynamic environments can hardly be quantified via a fixed\nnumber of parameters, whereas learning time- and location-specific environments\ncan quickly become computationally prohibitive. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel framework named Memory-enhanced Invariant Prompt learning (MIP) for urban\nflow prediction under constant distribution shifts. Specifically, MIP is\nequipped with a learnable memory bank that is trained to memorize the causal\nfeatures within the spatial-temporal graph. By querying a trainable memory bank\nthat stores the causal features, we adaptively extract invariant and variant\nprompts (i.e., patterns) for a given location at every time step. Then, instead\nof intervening the raw data based on simulated environments, we directly\nperform intervention on variant prompts across space and time. With the\nintervened variant prompts in place, we use invariant learning to minimize the\nvariance of predictions, so as to ensure that the predictions are only made\nwith invariant features. With extensive comparative experiments on two public\nurban flow datasets, we thoroughly demonstrate the robustness of MIP against\nOOD data.",

Differential privacy (DP) is a common method\nfor preserving privacy in such settings and, in this work, we examine two key\ntrade-offs in applying DP to the NLP task of medical coding (ICD\nclassification). Regarding the privacy-utility trade-off, we observe a\nsignificant performance drop in the privacy preserving models, with more than a\n40% reduction in micro F1 scores on the top 50 labels in the MIMIC-III dataset.\nFrom the perspective of the privacy-fairness trade-off, we also observe an\nincrease of over 3% in the recall gap between male and female patients in the\nDP models. Further understanding these trade-offs will help towards the\nchallenges of real-world deployment.",

    "abstract": "In Federated Learning (FL), multiple clients collaboratively train a model\nwithout sharing raw data. This paradigm can be further enhanced by Differential\nPrivacy (DP) to protect local data from information inference attacks and is\nthus termed DPFL. An emerging privacy requirement, ``the right to be\nforgotten'' for clients, poses new challenges to DPFL but remains largely\nunexplored. Despite numerous studies on federated unlearning (FU), they are\ninapplicable to DPFL because the noise introduced by the DP mechanism\ncompromises their effectiveness and efficiency. In this paper, we propose\nFederated Unlearning with Indistinguishability (FUI) to unlearn the local data\nof a target client in DPFL for the first time. FUI consists of two main steps:\nlocal model retraction and global noise calibration, resulting in an unlearning\nmodel that is statistically indistinguishable from the retrained model.\nSpecifically, we demonstrate that the noise added in DPFL can endow the\nunlearning model with a certain level of indistinguishability after local model\nretraction, and then fortify the degree of unlearning through global noise\ncalibration. Additionally, for the efficient and consistent implementation of\nthe proposed FUI, we formulate a two-stage Stackelberg game to derive optimal\nunlearning strategies for both the server and the target client. Privacy and\nconvergence analyses confirm theoretical guarantees, while experimental results\nbased on four real-world datasets illustrate that our proposed FUI achieves\nsuperior model performance and higher efficiency compared to mainstream FU\nschemes. Simulation results further verify the optimality of the derived\nunlearning strategies.",

    "abstract": "Designing sparse directed spanners, which are subgraphs that approximately\nmaintain distance constraints, has attracted sustained interest in TCS,\nespecially due to their wide applicability, as well as the difficulty to obtain\ntight results. However, a significant drawback of the notion of spanners is\nthat it cannot capture multiple distance-like constraints for the same demand\npair. In this paper we initiate the study of directed multicriteria spanners,\nin which the notion of edge lengths is replaced by the notion of resource\nconsumption vectors, where each entry corresponds to the consumption of the\nrespective resource on that edge. The goal is to find a minimum-cost routing\nsolution that satisfies the multiple constraints. To the best of our knowledge,\nwe obtain the first approximation algorithms for the directed multicriteria\nspanners problems, under natural assumptions. Our results match the\nstate-of-the-art approximation ratios in special cases of ours. We also\nestablish reductions from other natural network connectivity problems to the\ndirected multicriteria spanners problems, including Group Steiner Distances,\nintroduced in the undirected setting by Bil\\`o, Gual\\`a, Leucci and Straziota\n(ESA 2024), and Edge-Avoiding spanners. Our reductions imply approximation\nalgorithms for these problems and illustrate that the notion of directed\nmulticriteria spanners is an appropriate abstraction and generalization of\nnatural special cases from the literature. Our main technical tool is a\ndelicate generalization of the minimum-density junction tree framework of\nChekuri, Even, Gupta, and Segev (SODA 2008, TALG 2011) to the notion of\nminimum-density resource-constrained junction trees, which also extends ideas\nfrom Chlamt\\'a\\v{c}, Dinitz, Kortsarz, and Laekhanukit (SODA 2017, TALG 2020).",

    "abstract": "Advancements in computational fluid mechanics have largely relied on\nNewtonian frameworks, particularly through the direct simulation of\nNavier-Stokes equations. In this work, we propose an alternative computational\nframework that employs variational methods, specifically by leveraging the\nprinciple of minimum pressure gradient, which turns the fluid mechanics problem\ninto a minimization problem whose solution can be used to predict the flow\nfield in unsteady incompressible viscous flows.\n  This method exhibits two particulary intriguing properties. First, it\ncircumvents the chronic issues of pressure-velocity coupling in incompressible\nflows, which often dominates the computational cost in computational fluid\ndynamics (CFD). Second, this method eliminates the reliance on unphysical\nassumptions at the outflow boundary, addressing another longstanding challenge\nin CFD.\n  We apply this framework to three benchmark examples across a range of\nReynolds numbers: (i) unsteady flow field in a lid-driven cavity, (ii)\nPoiseuille flow, and (iii) flow past a circular cylinder. The minimization\nframework is carried out using a physics-informed neural network (PINN), which\nintegrates the underlying physical principles directly into the training of the\nmodel. The results from the proposed method are validated against high-fidelity\nCFD simulations, showing an excellent agreement. Comparison of the proposed\nvariational method to the conventional method, wherein PINNs is directly\napplied to solve Navier-Stokes Equations, reveals that the proposed method\noutperforms conventional PINNs in terms of both convergence rate and time,\ndemonstrating its potential for solving complex fluid mechanics problems.",

A typical illusion shows a gap\nbetween how something \"really is\" and how something \"appears to be\", and this\ngap helps us understand the mental processing that lead to how something\nappears to be. Illusions are also useful for investigating artificial systems,\nand much research has examined whether computational models of perceptions fall\nprey to the same illusions as people. Here, I invert the standard use of\nperceptual illusions to examine basic processing errors in current vision\nlanguage models. I present these models with illusory-illusions, neighbors of\ncommon illusions that should not elicit processing errors. These include such\nthings as perfectly reasonable ducks, crooked lines that truly are crooked,\ncircles that seem to have different sizes because they are, in fact, of\ndifferent sizes, and so on.

While\nseveral arbitrary-scale SR methods have been proposed, these methods require us\nto modify the model structure and retrain it to control the computational cost\nand SR quality. To address this limitation, we propose a novel SR method using\na Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with the Fourier representation. In our\nmethod, the RNN sequentially estimates Fourier components, each consisting of\nfrequency and amplitude, and aggregates these components to reconstruct an SR\nimage. Since the RNN can adjust the number of recurrences at test time, we can\ncontrol the computational cost and SR quality in a single model: fewer\nrecurrences (i.e., fewer Fourier components) lead to lower cost but lower\nquality, while more recurrences (i.e., more Fourier components) lead to better\nquality but more cost. Experimental results prove that more Fourier components\nimprove the PSNR score.

    "abstract": "Learning behavior in legged robots presents a significant challenge due to\nits inherent instability and complex constraints. Recent research has proposed\nthe use of a large language model (LLM) to generate reward functions in\nreinforcement learning, thereby replacing the need for manually designed\nrewards by experts. However, this approach, which relies on textual\ndescriptions to define learning objectives, fails to achieve controllable and\nprecise behavior learning with clear directionality. In this paper, we\nintroduce a new video2reward method, which directly generates reward functions\nfrom videos depicting the behaviors to be mimicked and learned. Specifically,\nwe first process videos containing the target behaviors, converting the motion\ninformation of individuals in the videos into keypoint trajectories represented\nas coordinates through a video2text transforming module. These trajectories are\nthen fed into an LLM to generate the reward function, which in turn is used to\ntrain the policy. To enhance the quality of the reward function, we develop a\nvideo-assisted iterative reward refinement scheme that visually assesses the\nlearned behaviors and provides textual feedback to the LLM. This feedback\nguides the LLM to continually refine the reward function, ultimately\nfacilitating more efficient behavior learning. Experimental results on tasks\ninvolving bipedal and quadrupedal robot motion control demonstrate that our\nmethod surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art LLM-based reward\ngeneration methods by over 37.6% in terms of human normalized score. More\nimportantly, by switching video inputs, we find our method can rapidly learn\ndiverse motion behaviors such as walking and running.",

It\nattains a model compression rate of 8.71x-10.19x for standard floating-point\nspiking transformers. Moreover, the proposed approach achieves a significant\nenergy reduction of 5.69x, 8.72x, and 10.2x while maintaining high accuracy\nlevels of 85.3%, 97.57%, and 80.4% on N-Caltech101, DVS-Gesture, and\nCIFAR10-DVS datasets, respectively.",

Mirroring, or mimicking the behaviors and opinions of another\nindividual, is one mechanism by which individuals can become aligned. Large\nscale investigations of the effect of mirroring on alignment have been limited\ndue to the scalability of traditional experimental designs in sociology. In\nthis paper, we introduce a simple computational framework that enables studying\nthe effect of mirroring behavior on alignment in multi-agent systems. We\nsimulate systems of interacting large language models in this framework and\ncharacterize overall system behavior and alignment with quantitative measures\nof agent dynamics. We find that system behavior is strongly influenced by the\nrange of communication of each agent and that these effects are exacerbated by\nincreased rates of mirroring.

This work formalizes a\nsystematic method by evoking pattern formation theory to explain the emergence\nof chimera states in complex networks, in a similar way to how Turing patterns\nare produced. Employing linear stability analysis and the spectral properties\nof complex networks, we show that the randomness of network topology, as\nreflected in the localization of the graph Laplacian eigenvectors, determines\nthe emergence of chimera patterns, underscoring the critical role of network\nstructure. In particular, this approach explains how amplitude and phase\nchimeras arise separately and explores whether phase chimeras can be chaotic or\nnot. Our findings suggest that chimeras result from the interplay between local\nand global dynamics at different time scales.

In light of this, we propose a\nnovel Reliability Aware Hybrid Intelligence (RAHI) method for fake news\ndetection. Our method comprises three integral modules. The first module\nemploys a Bayesian deep learning model to capture the inherent reliability\nwithin machine intelligence. The second module uses an Item Response Theory\n(IRT)-based user response aggregation to account for the reliability in crowd\nintelligence. The third module introduces a new distribution fusion mechanism,\nwhich takes the distributions derived from both machine and crowd intelligence\nas input, and outputs a fused distribution that provides predictions along with\nthe associated reliability. The experiments on the Weibo dataset demonstrate\nthe advantages of our method. This study contributes to the research field with\na novel RAHI-based method, and the code is shared at\nhttps://github.com/Kangwei-g/RAHI.

Deep learning methods have become the\nmainstream research direction due to their excellent performance. However, new\nviewpoints have emerged in recent TSAD research. Deep learning is not required\nfor TSAD due to limitations such as slow deep learning speed. The Broad\nLearning System (BLS) is a shallow network framework that benefits from its\nease of optimization and speed. It has been shown to outperform machine\nlearning approaches while remaining competitive with deep learning. Based on\nthe current situation of TSAD, we propose the Contrastive Patch-based Broad\nLearning System (CPatchBLS). This is a new exploration of patching technique\nand BLS, providing a new perspective for TSAD. We construct Dual-PatchBLS as a\nbase through patching and Simple Kernel Perturbation (SKP) and utilize\ncontrastive learning to capture the differences between normal and abnormal\ndata under different representations. To compensate for the temporal semantic\nloss caused by various patching, we propose CPatchBLS with model level\nintegration, which takes advantage of BLS's fast feature to build model-level\nintegration and improve model detection. Using five real-world series anomaly\ndetection datasets, we confirmed the method's efficacy, outperforming previous\ndeep learning and machine learning methods while retaining a high level of\ncomputing efficiency.",

An open\nquestion raised by several papers is whether this phenomenon of stepsize-based\nacceleration holds more generally for constrained and/or composite convex\noptimization via projected and/or proximal versions of gradient descent. We\nanswer this in the affirmative by proving that the silver stepsize schedule\nyields analogously accelerated rates in these settings. These rates are\nconjectured to be asymptotically optimal among all stepsize schedules, and\nmatch the silver convergence rate of vanilla gradient descent (Altschuler and\nParrilo, 2024, 2025), namely $O(\\varepsilon^{- \\log_{\\rho} 2})$ for smooth\nconvex optimization and $O(\\kappa^{\\log_\\rho 2} \\log \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon})$\nunder strong convexity, where $\\varepsilon$ is the precision, $\\kappa$ is the\ncondition number, and $\\rho = 1 + \\sqrt{2}$ is the silver ratio.

In order for their many-body state to be interpretable,\nthey should move along a common direction of time from past to future. This a\npriori kinematical condition restricts possible states to explicitly CP\ninvariant state, leading to another lowest-energy state instead of the Fock\nvacuum. In this vacuum, whatever effective interaction acts on massless\nfermion, it comes back on fermion and antifermion as an inertial mass. In this\nphysical vacuum, massless fermion and antifermion are generated as pairs, and\nthey behave as quasi bosons. Due to Bose statistics, their direction of motion\nis made parallel to each other, and their transverse excitations are suppressed\nby an energy gap, which makes the gauge boson massive, and explains the origin\nof the vacuum condensate in the BEH mechanism. The dynamic part of the above\neffective interaction induces a Higgs-like excitation. This interpretation\nsheds a new light on the BEH mechanism.",

Although substantial efforts have been made to address the\nchallenge of deepfake content, existing detection techniques face a major\nlimitation in generalization: they tend to perform well only on specific types\nof deepfakes they were trained on.This dependency on recognizing specific\ndeepfake artifacts makes current methods vulnerable when applied to unseen or\nvaried deepfakes, thereby compromising their performance in real-world\napplications such as social media platforms. To address the generalizability of\ndeepfake detection, there is a need for a holistic approach that can capture a\nbroader range of facial attributes and manipulations beyond isolated artifacts.\nTo address this, we propose a novel deepfake detection framework featuring an\neffective feature descriptor that integrates Deep identity, Behavioral, and\nGeometric (DBaG) signatures, along with a classifier named DBaGNet.\nSpecifically, the DBaGNet classifier utilizes the extracted DBaG signatures,\nleveraging a triplet loss objective to enhance generalized representation\nlearning for improved classification.

In this work, we investigate large temporal\nfluctuations of $Q_i$ at low powers over periods of 12 to 16 hours (relative\nstandard deviation $\\sigma_{Q_i}/Q_i = 13\\%$).

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs)\nto answer natural language queries about General Transit Feed Specification\n(GTFS) data. The framework is implemented in a chatbot called TransitGPT with\nopen-source code. TransitGPT works by guiding LLMs to generate Python code that\nextracts and manipulates GTFS data relevant to a query, which is then executed\non a server where the GTFS feed is stored. It can accomplish a wide range of\ntasks, including data retrieval, calculations, and interactive visualizations,\nwithout requiring users to have extensive knowledge of GTFS or programming. The\nLLMs that produce the code are guided entirely by prompts, without fine-tuning\nor access to the actual GTFS feeds. We evaluate TransitGPT using GPT-4o and\nClaude-3.5-Sonnet LLMs on a benchmark dataset of 100 tasks, to demonstrate its\neffectiveness and versatility. The results show that TransitGPT can\nsignificantly enhance the accessibility and usability of transit data.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a formal model of transportation in an open-pit mine for the\npurpose of optimising the mine's operations. The model is a network of Markov\nautomata (MA); the optimisation goal corresponds to maximising a time-bounded\nexpected reward property. Today's model checking algorithms exacerbate the\nstate space explosion problem by applying a discretisation approach to such\nproperties on MA. We show that model checking is infeasible even for small mine\ninstances. Instead, we propose statistical model checking with lightweight\nstrategy sampling or table-based Q-learning over untimed strategies as an\nalternative to approach the optimisation task, using the Modest Toolset's modes\ntool. We add support for partial observability to modes so that strategies can\nbe based on carefully selected model features, and we implement a connection\nfrom modes to the dtControl tool to convert sampled or learned strategies into\ndecision trees. We experimentally evaluate the adequacy of our new tooling on\nthe open-pit mine case study. Our experiments demonstrate the limitations of\nQ-learning, the impact of feature selection, and the usefulness of decision\ntrees as an explainable representation.",

    "abstract": "Environmental pollution and fossil fuel depletion have prompted the need for\nrenewable energy-based power generation. However, its stability is often\nchallenged by low energy density and non-stationary conditions. Wave energy\nconverters (WECs), in particular, need reliable real-time wave height\nprediction to address these issues caused by irregular wave patterns, which can\nlead to the inefficient and unstable operation of WECs. In this study, we\npropose an AI-powered reliable real-time wave height prediction model that\nintegrates long short-term memory (LSTM) networks for temporal prediction with\ndeep ensemble (DE) for robust uncertainty quantification (UQ), ensuring high\naccuracy and reliability. To further enhance the reliability, uncertainty\ncalibration is applied, which has proven to significantly improve the quality\nof the quantified uncertainty. Using real operational data from an oscillating\nwater column-wave energy converter (OWC-WEC) system in Jeju, South Korea, the\nmodel achieves notable accuracy (R2 > 0.9), while increasing uncertainty\nquality by over 50% through simple calibration technique. Furthermore, a\ncomprehensive parametric study is conducted to explore the effects of key model\nhyperparameters, offering valuable guidelines for diverse operational\nscenarios, characterized by differences in wavelength, amplitude, and period.\nThese results demonstrate the model's capability to deliver reliable\npredictions, facilitating digital twin of the ocean.",

    "abstract": "A method combining denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) with the\nstring method is presented to generate minimum free energy paths between\nmetastable states in molecular systems.

Building on this insight, it is shown here that DDPM-derived force\nfields accurately generate transition pathways for the analytical Muller-Brown\npotential and for the alanine dipeptide system at some range of noise levels\nfor DDPMs, recovering the transition path and implicitly capturing solvent\neffects in the case of alanine dipeptide.",

    "abstract": "The complexity of laboratory environments requires solutions that simplify\ninstrument interaction and enhance measurement automation. Traditional tools\noften require configuration, software, and programming skills, creating\nbarriers to productivity. Previous approaches, including dedicated software\nsuites and custom scripts, frequently fall short in providing user-friendly\nsolutions that align with programming practices. We present LABIIUM, an\nAI-enhanced, zero-configuration measurement automation system designed to\nstreamline experimental workflows and improve user productivity. LABIIUM\nintegrates an AI assistant powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate\ncode. LABIIUM's Lab-Automation-Measurement Bridges (LAMBs) enable seamless\ninstrument connectivity using standard tools such as VSCode and Python,\neliminating setup overhead. To demonstrate its capabilities, we conducted\nexperiments involving the measurement of the parametric transfer curve of a\nsimple two-transistor inverting amplifier with a current source load. The AI\nassistant was evaluated using different prompt scenarios and compared with\nmultiple models, including Claude Sonnet 3.5, Gemini Pro 1.5, and GPT-4o. An\nexpert solution implementing the Gradient-Weighted Adaptive Stochastic Sampling\n(GWASS) method was used as a baseline. The solutions generated by the AI\nassistant were compared with the expert solution and a uniform linear sweep\nbaseline with 10,000 points. The graph results show that the LLMs were able to\nsuccessfully complete the most basic uniform sweep, but LLMs were unable to\ndevelop adaptive sweeping algorithms to compete with GWASS. The evaluation\nunderscores LABIIUM's ability to enhance laboratory productivity and support\ndigital transformation in research and industry, and emphasizes the future work\nrequired to improve LLM performance in Electronic Measurement Science Tasks.",

We\nshow that jet drift imparts a sizeable enhancement of elliptic flow ($v_2$) and\nincreases the mean acoplanarity for low and intermediate energy particles ($p_T\n< 10$ GeV). Importantly, these novel modifications to hard probe observables\nare shown to survive averaging over events and collision geometry. They couple\nto the collective flow of the medium seen by the jet and encode information\nabout the QGP dynamics inaccessible to studies considering only isotropic,\neikonal level effects.",
