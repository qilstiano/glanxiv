    "abstract": "The formation and evolution of haze layers in planetary atmospheres play a\ncritical role in shaping their chemical composition, radiative balance, and\noptical properties. In the outer solar system, the atmospheres of Titan and the\ngiant planets exhibit a wide range of compositional and seasonal variability,\ncreating environments favorable for the production of complex organic molecules\nunder low-temperature conditions. Among them, Uranus -- the smallest of the ice\ngiants -- has, since Voyager 2, emerged as a compelling target for future\nexploration due to unanswered questions regarding the composition and structure\nof its atmosphere, as well as its ring system and diverse icy moon population\n(which includes four possible ocean worlds). Titan, as the only moon to harbor\na dense atmosphere, presents some of the most complex and unique organics found\nin the solar system. Central to the production of these organics are chemical\nprocesses driven by low-energy photons and electrons (<50 eV), which initiate\nreaction pathways leading to the formation of organic species and gas phase\nprecursors to high-molecular-weight compounds, including aerosols. These\naerosols, in turn, remain susceptible to further processing by low-energy UV\nradiation as they are transported from the upper atmosphere to the lower\nstratosphere and troposphere where condensation occurs. In this review, I aim\nto summarize the current understanding of low-energy (<50 eV) photon- and\nelectron-induced chemistry, drawing on decades of insights from studies of\nTitan, with the objective of evaluating the relevance and extent of these\nprocesses on Uranus in anticipation of future observational and in situ\nexploration.",

    "abstract": "Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) including large language models\n(LLMs) and hybrid reasoning models present an opportunity to reimagine how\nautonomous robots such as drones are designed, developed, and validated. Here,\nwe demonstrate a fully AI-generated drone control system: with minimal human\ninput, an artificial intelligence (AI) model authored all the code for a\nreal-time, self-hosted drone command and control platform, which was deployed\nand demonstrated on a real drone in flight as well as a simulated virtual drone\nin the cloud. The system enables real-time mapping, flight telemetry,\nautonomous mission planning and execution, and safety protocolsall orchestrated\nthrough a web interface hosted directly on the drone itself. Not a single line\nof code was written by a human. We quantitatively benchmark system performance,\ncode complexity, and development speed against prior, human-coded\narchitectures, finding that AI-generated code can deliver functionally complete\ncommand-and-control stacks at orders-of-magnitude faster development cycles,\nthough with identifiable current limitations related to specific model context\nwindow and reasoning depth. Our analysis uncovers the practical boundaries of\nAI-driven robot control code generation at current model scales, as well as\nemergent strengths and failure modes in AI-generated robotics code. This work\nsets a precedent for the autonomous creation of robot control systems and, more\nbroadly, suggests a new paradigm for robotics engineeringone in which future\nrobots may be largely co-designed, developed, and verified by artificial\nintelligence.

    "abstract": "The increasing complexity of wireless environments, characterized by user\nmobility and dynamic obstructions, poses challenges for the maintenance of\nLine-of-Sight (LoS) connectivity. Mobile base stations (gNBs) stand as a\npromising solution by physically relocating to restore or sustain LoS, thereby\nnecessitating the development of intelligent algorithms for autonomous movement\ncontrol.\n  As part of the CONVERGE research project, which is developing an experimental\nchamber to integrate computer vision (CV) into mobile networks and enhance\nQuality of Service (QoS) in dynamic wireless environments, this paper presents\ntwo key contributions. First, we introduce the CONVERGE Chamber Simulator\n(CC-SIM), a 3D simulation environment for developing, training, and validating\nmobility control algorithms for mobile gNBs. CC-SIM models user and obstacle\nmobility, visual occlusion, and Radio Frequency (RF) propagation behavior. It\nsupports both offline reinforcement learning and real-time testing through\ntight integration with a standalone 5G system via the OpenAirInterface (OAI) RF\nsimulator, enabling validation under realistic network conditions.\n  Second, leveraging CC-SIM, we develop a Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent that\nlearns to reposition the gNB proactively in response to dynamic environmental\nchanges. Experiments across three representative use cases show that the\ntrained agent significantly reduces LoS blockage time - by up to 42% - when\ncompared to static deployments. These results highlight the effectiveness of\nlearning-based mobility control in adaptive next-generation wireless networks.",

In\nthis work, we propose AMD-Mamba, a novel multi-modal framework for AMD\nprognosis, and further develop a new AMD biomarker. This framework integrates\ncolor fundus images with genetic variants and socio-demographic variables. At\nits core, AMD-Mamba introduces an innovative metric learning strategy that\nleverages AMD severity scale score as prior knowledge. This strategy allows the\nmodel to learn richer feature representations by aligning learned features with\nclinical phenotypes, thereby improving the capability of conventional prognosis\nmethods in capturing disease progression patterns. In addition, unlike existing\nmodels that use traditional CNN backbones and focus primarily on local\ninformation, such as the presence of drusen, AMD-Mamba applies Vision Mamba and\nsimultaneously fuses local and long-range global information, such as vascular\nchanges. Furthermore, we enhance prediction performance through multi-scale\nfusion, combining image information with clinical variables at different\nresolutions. We evaluate AMD-Mamba on the AREDS dataset, which includes 45,818\ncolor fundus photographs, 52 genetic variants, and 3 socio-demographic\nvariables from 2,741 subjects. Our experimental results demonstrate that our\nproposed biomarker is one of the most significant biomarkers for the\nprogression of AMD.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces tools for assessing the sensitivity, to unobserved\nconfounding, of a common estimator of the causal effect of a treatment on an\noutcome that employs weights: the weighted linear regression of the outcome on\nthe treatment and observed covariates. We demonstrate through the omitted\nvariable bias framework that the bias of this estimator is a function of two\nintuitive sensitivity parameters: (i) the proportion of weighted variance in\nthe treatment that unobserved confounding explains given the covariates and\n(ii) the proportion of weighted variance in the outcome that unobserved\nconfounding explains given the covariates and the treatment, i.e., two weighted\npartial $R^2$ values. Following previous work, we define sensitivity statistics\nthat lend themselves well to routine reporting, and derive formal bounds on the\nstrength of the unobserved confounding with (a multiple of) the strength of\nselect dimensions of the covariates, which help the user determine if\nunobserved confounding that would alter one's conclusions is plausible. We also\npropose tools for adjusted inference. A key choice we make is to examine only\nhow the (weighted) outcome model is influenced by unobserved confounding,\nrather than examining how the weights have been biased by omitted confounding.\nOne benefit of this choice is that the resulting tool applies with any weights\n(e.g., inverse-propensity score, matching, or covariate balancing weights).\nAnother benefit is that we can rely on simple omitted variable bias approaches\nthat, for example, impose no distributional assumptions on the data or\nunobserved confounding, and can address bias from misspecification in the\nobserved data.

Distributionally Robust Markov Games (DRMGs) enhance\nsystem resilience by optimizing for worst-case performance over a defined set\nof environmental uncertainties. However, current methods are limited by their\ndependence on simulators or large offline datasets, which are often\nunavailable. This paper pioneers the study of online learning in DRMGs, where\nagents learn directly from environmental interactions without prior data. We\nintroduce the {\\it Robust Optimistic Nash Value Iteration (RONAVI)} algorithm\nand provide the first provable guarantees for this setting.

LMDG automates benign activity generation,\nmulti-stage attack execution, and comprehensive labeling of system and network\nlogs, dramatically reducing manual effort and enabling scalable dataset\ncreation. A central contribution of LMDG is Process Tree Labeling, a novel\nagent-based technique that traces all malicious activity back to its origin\nwith high precision. Unlike prior methods such as Injection Timing or\nBehavioral Profiling, Process Tree Labeling enables accurate, step-wise\nlabeling of malicious log entries, correlating each with a specific attack step\nand MITRE ATT\\&CK TTPs. To our knowledge, this is the first approach to support\nfine-grained labeling of multi-step attacks, providing critical context for\ndetection models such as attack path reconstruction. We used LMDG to generate a\n25-day dataset within a 25-VM enterprise environment containing 22 user\naccounts. The dataset includes 944 GB of host and network logs and embeds 35\nmulti-stage LM attacks, with malicious events comprising less than 1% of total\nactivity, reflecting a realistic benign-to-malicious ratio for evaluating\ndetection systems.

Here we report our first results from this survey\nfor 10 DLAs with redshifts of ~4.2-5.0. We determine abundances of C, O, Si, S,\nand Fe, and thereby the metallicities and dust depletions. We find that DLA\nmetallicities at z>4.5 show a wide diversity spanning ~3 orders of magnitude.\nThe metallicities of DLAs at 3.7<z<5.3 show a larger dispersion compared to\nthat at lower redshifts. Combining our sample with the literature, we find a\nrelatively smooth evolution of metallicity with redshift out to z~5.3, with a\ntentative (~2 sigma) indication of a slight rise in metallicity at 4.5<z<5.3.\nThe relative abundances exhibit C enhancement for both metal-poor and\nmetal-enriched DLAs. In addition, alpha-element enhancement is evident in some\nDLAs, including a DLA at z=4.7 with a super-solar metallicity. Comparing [C/O]\nand [Si/O] with model predictions, 4 DLAs in our survey seem consistent with a\nnon-zero Pop III contribution (3 with >=30% Pop-III contribution).

    "abstract": "Continuous cellular automata (CCAs) have evolved from discrete lookup tables\nto continuous partial differential equation (PDE) formulations in the search\nfor novel forms of complexity. Despite innovations in qualitative behavior,\nanalytical methods have lagged behind, reinforcing the notion that emergent\ncomplexity defies simple explanation. In this paper, we demonstrate that the\nPDE formulation of Asymptotic Lenia enables rigorous analysis using dynamical\nsystems theory. We apply the concepts of symmetries, attractors, Lyapunov\nexponents, and fractal dimensions to characterize complex behaviors\nmathematically. Our contributions include: (1) a mathematical explanation for\nthe four distinct solution classes (solitons, rotators, periodic and chaotic\npatterns), (2) conditions for the existence of a global attractor with fractal\ndimension $>4$, (3) identification of Kaplan-Yorke dimension as an effective\ncomplexity measure for CCAs, and (4) an efficient open-source implementation\nfor calculating Lyapunov exponents and the covariant Lyapunov vectors for CCAs.\nWe conclude by identifying the minimal set of properties that enable complex\nbehavior in a broader class of CCAs. This framework provides a foundation for\nunderstanding and measuring complexity in artificial life systems.",

In contrast to fields where FMs are already widely adopted such as\nnatural language processing and computer vision, progress in recommender\nsystems is hindered by unique challenges including the need to learn from\nonline streaming data under shifting data distributions, the need to adapt to\ndifferent recommendation surfaces with a wide diversity in their downstream\ntasks and their input distributions, and stringent latency and computational\nconstraints. To bridge this gap, we propose to leverage the Foundation-Expert\nParadigm: a framework designed for the development and deployment of hyperscale\nrecommendation FMs. In our approach, a central FM is trained on lifelong,\ncross-surface, multi-modal user data to learn generalizable knowledge. This\nknowledge is then efficiently transferred to various lightweight,\nsurface-specific \"expert\" models via target-aware embeddings, allowing them to\nadapt to local data distributions and optimization goals with minimal overhead.\nTo meet our training, inference and development needs, we built HyperCast, a\nproduction-grade infrastructure system that re-engineers training, serving,\nlogging and iteration to power this decoupled paradigm. Our approach is now\ndeployed at Meta serving tens of billions of user requests daily, demonstrating\nonline metric improvements over our previous one-stage production system while\nimproving developer velocity and maintaining infrastructure efficiency. To the\nbest of our knowledge, this work represents the first successful deployment of\na Foundation-Expert paradigm at this scale, offering a proven,\ncompute-efficient, and developer-friendly blueprint to realize the promise of\nscaling laws in recommender systems.",

The estimated\nimage and blur filter are defined as the maximizer of the posterior\ndistribution. However, when paired with sparsity-promoting image priors, MAP\nestimation has been shown to favors blurry solutions, limiting its\neffectiveness. In this paper, we revisit this result using diffusion-based\npriors, a class of models that capture realistic image distributions. Through\nan empirical examination of the prior's likelihood landscape, we uncover two\nkey properties: first, blurry images tend to have higher likelihoods; second,\nthe landscape contains numerous local minimizers that correspond to natural\nimages. Building on these insights, we provide a theoretical analysis of the\nblind deblurring posterior. This reveals that the MAP estimator tends to\nproduce sharp filters (close to the Dirac delta function) and blurry solutions.\nHowever local minimizers of the posterior, which can be obtained with gradient\ndescent, correspond to realistic, natural images, effectively solving the blind\ndeconvolution problem. Our findings suggest that overcoming MAP's limitations\nrequires good local initialization to local minima in the posterior landscape.\nWe validate our analysis with numerical experiments, demonstrating the\npractical implications of our insights for designing improved priors and\noptimization techniques.",

We develop rubrics that use a tree\nstructure to hierarchically collapse the penetration testing task for a\nparticular environment into smaller, simpler, and more manageable sub-tasks and\ncriteria until each leaf node represents simple yes-or-no criteria for\nPentestJudge to evaluate. Task nodes are broken down into different categories\nrelated to operational objectives, operational security, and tradecraft.\nLLM-as-judge scores are compared to human domain experts as a ground-truth\nreference, allowing us to compare their relative performance with standard\nbinary classification metrics, such as F1 scores.

The optimal control problem is efficiently solved using Sequential\nConvex Programming (SCP) combined with a solution continuation strategy. The\nneural network framework consists of two models: one predicts the minimum fuel\nconsumption ($\\Delta v$), while the other estimates the minimum flight time\n($\\Delta t$) which is used to assess transfer feasibility. Case results\ndemonstrate that, in simplified scenarios without path constraints, the neural\nnetwork approach achieves low relative errors across most of the design space\nand successfully captures the main structural features of the porkchop plots.\nIn cases where the SCP-based continuation method fails due to the presence of\nmultiple local optima, the neural network still provides smooth and globally\nconsistent predictions, significantly improving the efficiency of early-stage\nasteroid candidate screening. However, the deformation of the feasible region\ncaused by path constraints leads to noticeable discrepancies in certain\nboundary regions, thereby limiting the applicability of the network in detailed\nmission design phases. Overall, the integration of neural networks with\nporkchop plot analysis offers a effective decision-making tool for mission\ndesigners and planetary scientists, with significant potential for engineering\napplications.",

    "abstract": "Ensuring safety in autonomous driving requires precise, real-time risk\nassessment and adaptive behavior. Prior work on risk estimation either outputs\ncoarse, global scene-level metrics lacking interpretability, proposes\nindicators without concrete integration into autonomous systems, or focuses\nnarrowly on specific driving scenarios. We introduce the Context-aware Risk\nIndex (CRI), a light-weight modular framework that quantifies directional risks\nbased on object kinematics and spatial relationships, dynamically adjusting\ncontrol commands in real time. CRI employs direction-aware spatial partitioning\nwithin a dynamic safety envelope using Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS)\nprinciples, a hybrid probabilistic-max fusion strategy for risk aggregation,\nand an adaptive control policy for real-time behavior modulation. We evaluate\nCRI on the Bench2Drive benchmark comprising 220 safety-critical scenarios using\na state-of-the-art end-to-end model Transfuser++ on challenging routes. Our\ncollision-rate metrics show a 19\\% reduction (p = 0.003) in vehicle collisions\nper failed route, a 20\\% reduction (p = 0.004) in collisions per kilometer, a\n17\\% increase (p = 0.016) in composed driving score, and a statistically\nsignificant reduction in penalty scores (p = 0.013) with very low overhead (3.6\nms per decision cycle). These results demonstrate that CRI substantially\nimproves safety and robustness in complex, risk-intensive environments while\nmaintaining modularity and low runtime overhead.",

While recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have\nshown promise in this task, most current VLM systems rely on models\nspecifically designed and optimized for navigation, leaving the potential of\noff-the-shelf LVLMs underexplored. Furthermore, while older VLN approaches used\nlow-level action spaces with egocentric views and atomic actions (such as \"turn\nleft\" or \"move forward\"), newer models tend to favor panoramic action spaces\nwith discrete navigable viewpoints. This paper investigates (1) whether\noff-the-shelf LVLMs (fine-tuned without architectural modifications or\nsimulator-based training) can effectively support VLN tasks and (2) whether\nsuch models can support both low-level and panoramic action paradigms. To this\nend, we fine-tune the open-source model Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct on the\nRoom-to-Room (R2R) dataset and evaluate its empirical performance across both\nlow-level and panoramic action spaces.

In contrast, the full RMR improves\n\\(G^*\\) estimation accuracy up to the frequency \\(\\omega \\approx\n\\tau_{s}^{-1}=\\eta_{s}/\\rho_{f}a^{2}\\), where fluid inertia becomes relevant.\nHowever, in the ballistic regime (\\(t \\ll \\tau_{s}\\)), particle inertia\ndominates, making accurate \\(G^*\\) evaluation challenging even with the full\nRMR. This study clarifies the applicability range of RMR. Additionally,\nrotational Brownian motion is turned out to be insensitive to periodic boundary\nconditions, which allows direct application to various mesoscale molecular\nsimulations, including coarse-grained molecular dynamics, dissipative particle\ndynamics, and fluid dynamics simulations. In conclusion, rotational\nmicrorheology offers a promising approach for detailed rheological analysis in\ncomplex systems and conditions.",

This paper establishes a\nmethod that approaches global optimality for multi-flyby trajectory\noptimization under a given sequence. The original optimal control problem with\ninterior-point equality constraints is transformed into a multi-stage decision\nformulation. This reformulation enables direct application of dynamic\nprogramming in lower dimensions, and follows Bellman's principle of optimality.\nMoreover, the method provides a quantifiable bound on global optima errors\nintroduced by discretization and approximation assumptions, thus ensuring a\nmeasure of confidence in the obtained solution. The method accommodates both\nimpulsive and low-thrust maneuver schemes in rendezvous and flyby scenarios.\nSeveral computational techniques are introduced to enhance efficiency,\nincluding a specialized solution for bi-impulse cases and an adaptive step\nrefinement strategy. The proposed method is validated through three problems:\n1) an impulsive variant of the fourth Global Trajectory Optimization\ncompetition problem (GTOC4), 2) the GTOC11 problem, and 3) the original\nlow-thrust GTOC4 problem. Each case demonstrates improvements in fuel\nconsumption over the best-known trajectories.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in diffusion models have demonstrated significant success\nin unsupervised anomaly segmentation. For anomaly segmentation, these models\nare first trained on normal data; then, an anomalous image is noised to an\nintermediate step, and the normal image is reconstructed through backward\ndiffusion. Unlike traditional statistical methods, diffusion models do not rely\non specific assumptions about the data or target anomalies, making them\nversatile for use across different domains. However, diffusion models typically\nassume access to normal data for training, limiting their applicability in\nrealistic settings. In this paper, we propose novel robust denoising diffusion\nmodels for scenarios where only contaminated (i.e., a mix of normal and\nanomalous) unlabeled data is available. By casting maximum likelihood\nestimation of the data as a nonlinear regression problem, we reinterpret the\ndenoising diffusion probabilistic model through a regression lens. Using robust\nregression, we derive a robust version of denoising diffusion probabilistic\nmodels. Our novel framework offers flexibility in constructing various robust\ndiffusion models. Our experiments show that our approach outperforms current\nstate of the art diffusion models, for unsupervised anomaly segmentation when\nonly contaminated data is available. Our method outperforms existing\ndiffusion-based approaches, achieving up to 8.08\\% higher AUROC and 10.37\\%\nhigher AUPRC on MVTec datasets.

While this can be achieved by\ndecreasing the gate duration, the use of shorter signals increases their\nbandwidth and can cause leakage into energetically separated states. A common\nmethod to suppress leakage for short pulses is the Derivative Removal by\nAdiabatic Gate (DRAG) method, which however, relies on IQ modulation of\nradio-frequency (RF) signals, thus cannot be applied to the baseband signals,\ne.g., for semiconductor spin qubits. This paper proposes a novel technique,\nDelayed Leakage Reduction (DLR), that suppresses leakage at targeted\nfrequencies even for baseband control by using time-delayed repetitions of the\ncontrol signal to enable rapid, high-fidelity operations. We apply DLR on the\nadiabatic CZ gate between two spin qubits and achieve fidelities exceeding\n99.9% within 9.4 ns for a resonance frequency difference of only 100 MHz.\nTowards the experimental realization of the proposed control method, we also\nassess the impact on the fidelity of the sampling rate of the electronic\nhardware generating the control pulse, thus setting the minimum hardware\nrequirements for any experimental demonstration.",

    "abstract": "There is a broad consensus that the inability to form long-term plans is one\nof the key limitations of current foundational models and agents. However, the\nexisting planning benchmarks remain woefully inadequate to truly measure their\nplanning capabilities. Most existing benchmarks either focus on loosely defined\ntasks like travel planning or end up leveraging existing domains and problems\nfrom international planning competitions. While the former tasks are hard to\nformalize and verify, the latter were specifically designed to test and\nchallenge the weaknesses of existing automated planners. To address these\nshortcomings, we propose a procedure for creating a planning benchmark centered\naround the game called Countdown, where a player is expected to form a target\nnumber from a list of input numbers through arithmetic operations. We discuss\nhow this problem meets many of the desiderata associated with an ideal\nbenchmark for planning capabilities evaluation. Specifically, the domain allows\nfor an intuitive, natural language description for each problem instance, it is\ncomputationally challenging (NP-complete), and the instance space is rich\nenough that we do not have to worry about memorization. We perform an extensive\ntheoretical analysis, establishing the computational complexity result and\ndemonstrate the advantage of our instance generation procedure over public\nbenchmarks. We evaluate a variety of existing LLM-assisted planning methods on\ninstances generated using our procedure.

However, FES is limited by early\nmuscle fatigue, slowing down the recovery progress. The use of optimal control\nto reduce overstimulation and improve motion precision is gaining interest.\nThis review aims to map the current literature state meanwhile clarifying the\nbest practices, identifying persistent challenges, and outlining directions for\nfuture research. Methods: Following the PRISMA guidelines, a search was\nconducted up to February 2024 using the combined keywords \"FES\", \"optimal\ncontrol\" or \"fatigue\" across five databases (Medline, Embase, CINAHL Complete,\nWeb of Science, and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Citation Index). Inclusion\ncriteria included the use of optimal control with FES for healthy individuals\nand those with neuromuscular disorders. Results: Among the 44 included studies,\nhalf were in silico and half in vivo, involving 87 participants, predominantly\nhealthy young men. Twelve different motor tasks were investigated, with a focus\non single joint lower limb movements. These studies principally used simple FES\nmodels, modulating pulse width or intensity to track joint angle. Conclusions:\nOptimal control-driven FES can deliver precise motions and reduce fatigue. Yet\nclinical adoption is slowed down by the lack of consensus about modelling,\ninconvenient model identification protocol and limited validation. Additional\nbarriers include insufficient open-science practices, computational performance\nreporting and the availability of customizable commercial hardware. Comparative\nFES model studies and longitudinal trials with large cohorts, among other\nefforts, are required to improve the technology readiness level.

To address this, we propose the Coherent Multimodal\nReasoning Framework (CMRF), a novel approach that enhances LVLMs' common sense\nreasoning capabilities through an iterative, self-evaluating inference\nmechanism. CMRF mimics human problem-solving by decomposing complex queries,\ngenerating step-by-step inferences, and self-correcting errors. Our framework\nintegrates three key modules: a Reasoning Decomposition Unit (RDU) for breaking\ndown problems into sub-questions, a Contextual Inference Engine (CIE) for\ncontextual inference, and a Coherence Assessment Module (CAM) for evaluating\nlogical consistency and confidence. Coupled with an Adaptive Iterative\nRefinement strategy, CMRF systematically refines its reasoning paths. Built\nupon LLaVA-1.6-34B and trained on a novel Multimodal Daily Activity Reasoning\n(MDAR) dataset, CMRF achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source\nLVLMs on challenging benchmarks like VCR, A-OKVQA, and DailyLife-MRC.

These modifications are\noften parametrized within a general framework by an effective quantum gravity\nenergy scale $E_{QG,n}$. While such general constraints are well established in\nthe LIV literature, their translation into specific coefficients of alternative\ntheoretical frameworks, such as the Standard-Model Extension (SME), is rarely\ncarried out. In particular, existing bounds on the quadratic case ($n=2$) of\n$E_{QG,n}$ can be systematically converted into constraints on the\nnon-birefringent, CPT-conserving SME coefficients $c^{(6)}_{(I)jm}$. This work\nprovides a concise overview of the relevant SME formalism and introduces a\ntransparent conversion method from $E_{QG,2}$ to SME parameters. We review the\nmost stringent time-of-flight-based bounds on $E_{QG,n}$ and standardize them\nby accounting for systematics, applying missing prefactors, and transforming\nresults into two-sided Gaussian uncertainties where needed.

This motivates us to investigate a new resource allocation\nproblem formulated in this paper: The defender must decide how to split its\ninvestment between preventive defenses, which aim to harden nodes from attacks,\nand reactive defenses, which aim to quickly clean up the compromised nodes.\nThis encounters a challenge imposed by the uncertainty associated with the\nobservation, or sensor signal, whether a node is truly compromised or not; this\nuncertainty is real because attack detectors are not perfect.

    "abstract": "Soft-walled microchannels arise in many applications, ranging from\norgan-on-a-chip platforms to soft-robotic actuators. However, despite extensive\nresearch on their static and dynamic response, the potential failure of these\ndevices has not been addressed. To this end, we explore fluid--structure\ninteraction in microchannels whose compliant top wall is governed by a nonlocal\nmechanical theory capable of simulating both deformation and material failure.\nWe develop a one-dimensional model by coupling viscous flow under the\nlubrication approximation to a state-based peridynamic formulation of an\nEuler--Bernoulli beam. The peridynamic formulation enables the wall to be\nmodeled as a genuinely nonlocal beam, and the integral form of its equation of\nmotion remains valid whether the deformation field is smooth or contains\ndiscontinuities. Through the proposed computational model, we explore the\nsteady and time-dependent behaviors of this fluid--peridynamic structure\ninteraction. We rationalize the wave and damping dynamics observed in the\nsimulations through a dispersion (linearized) analysis of the coupled system,\nfinding that, with increasing nonlocal influence, wave propagation exhibits a\nclear departure from classical behavior, characterized by a gradual suppression\nof the phase velocity. The main contribution of our study is to outline the\npotential failure scenarios of the microchannel's soft wall under the\nhydrodynamic load of the flow. Specifically, we find a dividing curve in the\nspace spanned by the dimensionless Strouhal number (quantifying unsteady\ninertia of the beam) and the compliance number (quantifying the strength of the\nfluid--structure coupling) separating scenarios of potential failure during\ntransient conditions from potential failure at the steady load.",

    "abstract": "Preventing jailbreaking and model hijacking of Large Language Models (LLMs)\nis an important yet challenging task. For example, when interacting with a\nchatbot, malicious users can input specially crafted prompts to cause the LLM\nto generate undesirable content or perform a completely different task from its\nintended purpose. Existing mitigations for such attacks typically rely on\nhardening the LLM's system prompt or using a content classifier trained to\ndetect undesirable content or off-topic conversations. However, these\nprobabilistic approaches are relatively easy to bypass due to the very large\nspace of possible inputs and undesirable outputs. In this paper, we present and\nevaluate Highlight & Summarize (H&S), a new design pattern for\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems that prevents these attacks by\ndesign. The core idea is to perform the same task as a standard RAG pipeline\n(i.e., to provide natural language answers to questions, based on relevant\nsources) without ever revealing the user's question to the generative LLM. This\nis achieved by splitting the pipeline into two components: a highlighter, which\ntakes the user's question and extracts relevant passages (\"highlights\") from\nthe retrieved documents, and a summarizer, which takes the highlighted passages\nand summarizes them into a cohesive answer. We describe several possible\ninstantiations of H&S and evaluate their generated responses in terms of\ncorrectness, relevance, and response quality. Surprisingly, when using an\nLLM-based highlighter, the majority of H&S responses are judged to be better\nthan those of a standard RAG pipeline.",

We conclude by identifying two\nnecessary shifts in sociotechnical design to support moderators' work: first,\nmoving to automated tools that support human sensemaking in contexts with\ncompeting interests; and second, shifting from systems that require moderators\nto perform low-level rule programming to those that enable high-level,\nexample-based instruction.

In this vein, full-field ultrasonic characterization of reacted\nspecimens can help shed light on the process. We use a 3D Scanning Laser\nDoppler Vibrometer to perform full-field monitoring of one-dimensional (1D)\nultrasonic waves in rod-shaped sandstone specimens exposed to NaCl-rich fluid.\nOur initial experiments were conducted on intact sandstone specimens with high\naspect ratio (length/diameter $\\simeq 15$) to cater for 1D axial wave\npropagation.

The upward movement of the fluid,\nsupplied at the bottom of each specimen, was achieved through capillary action.\nWe deploy an elastography-type approach to back-analysis, known as\nmodified-error-in-constitutive-relation (MECR) approach, to expose the\nspatially-heterogeneous evolution of mechanical rock properties due to reactive\ntransport. Our results consistently demonstrate (i) degradation of the Young's\nmodulus, and (ii) increase in attenuation due to mineralization.

This framework explains the emergence of complex phenomenal qualities\nand conscious subjects. Furthermore, the inherent openness of quantum mechanics\nallows consciousness and, more generally, phenomenal properties to exert a\ncausal influence. If the view proposed by quantum panprotopsychism is valid, it\nsuggests that we inhabit a consciousness-centered universe. A world whose\nfundamental nature is phenomenal. This is at odds with the current view about\nthe human condition that was strongly influenced by a science based on\nclassical mechanicism, and led to nihilism and existentialism in late\n19th-century Europe, and more recently to the rise of anti-foundationalists\nperspectives. The centrality of consciousness resulting from the incorporation\nof a quantum ontology into our worldview leads us to reconsider the nihilistic\nview and conclude that we live in a world in which a precise physical order\nleads to people capable of accessing a transcendent phenomenal realm.",

Unlike\nstandard architectures that use fixed node-based activations, KANs place\nlearnable functions on edges, parameterized by different function families.\nWhile they have shown promise in supervised settings, their utility in\nunsupervised fault detection remains largely unexplored. This study presents a\ncomparative evaluation of KAN-based autoencoders (KAN-AEs) for unsupervised\nfault detection in chemical processes. We investigate four KAN-AE variants,\neach based on a different KAN implementation (EfficientKAN, FastKAN,\nFourierKAN, and WavKAN), and benchmark them against an Orthogonal Autoencoder\n(OAE) on the Tennessee Eastman Process. Models are trained on normal operating\ndata across 13 training set sizes and evaluated on 21 fault types, using Fault\nDetection Rate (FDR) as the performance metric. WavKAN-AE achieves the highest\noverall FDR ($\\geq$92\\%) using just 4,000 training samples and remains the top\nperformer, even as other variants are trained on larger datasets.\nEfficientKAN-AE reaches $\\geq$90\\% FDR with only 500 samples, demonstrating\nrobustness in low-data settings. FastKAN-AE becomes competitive at larger\nscales ($\\geq$50,000 samples), while FourierKAN-AE consistently underperforms.\nThe OAE baseline improves gradually but requires substantially more data to\nmatch top KAN-AE performance. These results highlight the ability of KAN-AEs to\ncombine data efficiency with strong fault detection performance. Their use of\nstructured basis functions suggests potential for improved model transparency,\nmaking them promising candidates for deployment in data-constrained industrial\nsettings.",

    "abstract": "As autonomous driving (AD) technology advances, increasing research has\nfocused on leveraging cooperative perception (CP) data collected from multiple\nAVs to enhance traffic applications. Due to the impracticality of large-scale\nreal-world AV deployments, simulation has become the primary approach in most\nstudies. While game-engine-based simulators like CARLA generate high-fidelity\nraw sensor data (e.g., LiDAR point clouds) which can be used to produce\nrealistic detection outputs, they face scalability challenges in multi-AV\nscenarios. In contrast, microscopic traffic simulators such as SUMO scale\nefficiently but lack perception modeling capabilities. To bridge this gap, we\npropose MIDAR, a LiDAR detection mimicking model that approximates realistic\nLiDAR detections using vehicle-level features readily available from\nmicroscopic traffic simulators. Specifically, MIDAR predicts true positives\n(TPs) and false negatives (FNs) from ideal LiDAR detection results based on the\nspatial layouts and dimensions of surrounding vehicles. A Refined Multi-hop\nLine-of-Sight (RM-LoS) graph is constructed to encode the occlusion\nrelationships among vehicles, upon which MIDAR employs a GRU-enhanced APPNP\narchitecture to propagate features from the ego AV and occluding vehicles to\nthe prediction target. MIDAR achieves an AUC of 0.909 in approximating the\ndetection results generated by CenterPoint, a mainstream 3D LiDAR detection\nmodel, on the nuScenes AD dataset. Two CP-based traffic applications further\nvalidate the necessity of such realistic detection modeling, particularly for\ntasks requiring accurate individual vehicle observations (e.g., position,\nspeed, lane index). As demonstrated in the applications, MIDAR can be\nseamlessly integrated into traffic simulators and trajectory datasets and will\nbe open-sourced upon publication.",

Mercury's exposure to energetic\nspace weathering processes such as meteoritic impact and solar-wind sputtering\nsuggests this high sulfur concentration should be reflected in the suprathermal\nsulfur population of the Hermean exosphere. UV spectroscopy has not yet\ndetected exospheric sulfur, a result attributed primarily to its low\nglow-factor. Future detection by BepiColombo's Mass Spectrum Analyzer depends\non sulfur abundance in the exosphere. Radiation-induced segregation has been\nobserved in the common sulfide troilite (FeS), a constituent mineral in\nreturned Lunar samples, meteorites, and asteroids, where the resulting metal\ncap is expected to reduce sulfur ejection to Mercury's exosphere. In this work,\nwe investigate the irradiation response of Mercury-relevant sulfides.\nNiningerite (MgS) and oldhamite (CaS) were irradiated with solar-wind speed 2\nkeV H$_2^+$ or 4 keV He$^+$, and in-situ compositional and chemical bond\nanalysis as a function of fluence was performed using an XPS microprobe.\nNeither MgS nor CaS expressed detectable damage-induced segregation and instead\nreached metal-to-sulfur ratios close to bulk with irradiation. Based on this\nfinding, structural information, and literature analyses, we infer that an S-S\nanionic spacing exceeding $\\sim$3.2 \\AA{} inhibits radiation-induced sulfur\ndepletion and promotes stoichiometric sputtering. We therefore predict no\ncation (metal) surface segregation in Hermean sulfides and no reduction in\nsuprathermal sulfur emission caused by metal cladding formation in TiS, CrS,\nand Ca-Mg sulfides. This radiation-hardness for Mercury-relevant sulfides is\nnovel and unexpected, and should facilitate detection in Mercury's exosphere by\nthe BepiColombo mission.",

Geomorphometric mapping of such landscapes is\nnecessary to obtain new knowledge about quantitative topographic\ncharacteristics of these unique objects and the further use of morphometric\ninformation in the geosciences. First, we present a concept, structure, and\ncontent of the atlas including a list of 194 areas to be modeled and mapped.\nFor each area, the atlas will include the following materials: (a) a\nhypsometric map; (b) a map series of the eleven morphometric variables: slope,\naspect, horizontal curvature, vertical curvature, minimal curvature, maximal\ncurvature, catchment area, topographic wetness index, stream power index, total\ninsolation, and wind exposition index; and (c) reference texts and tables.\nSecond, we describe data and methods of geomorphometric modeling and mapping to\nbe utilized for creating the atlas. Fragments of the Reference Elevation Model\nof Antarctica will be used as input data for geomorphometric calculations and\nmodeling. Next, we discuss specificity of the ice-free areas posing challenges\nin the atlas development. Finally, we consider possible applications of the\nderived maps. The principal feature and novelty of the atlas will be the system\nview on maps of key fundamental morphometric attributes associated with the\ntheory of the topographic surface and the concept of general geomorphometry.\nThe atlas will concentrate multi-scale, multi-aspect quantitative information\non the ice-free Antarctic topography, will present it in a systematized,\norganized, and easy-to-read form as well as will provide scientific and\ninformation support for research in Antarctica.",

Many model calculations show that the transition is\nfirst-order at sufficiently high baryon chemical potential. It is then natural\nto expect the existence of a critical point where the crossover and first-order\nphase transition lines meet. We show how to embed a phase boundary that\nterminates at the critical point in a smooth background equation of state,\nusing several different but closely related criteria, so as to yield the\ncritical exponents and critical amplitude ratios expected of a transition in\nthe 3D Ising and liquid-gas universality class. The crossover curves can be\ntuned to pass through experimental freeze-out data from heavy ion collisions at\nRHIC and the LHC.

We search for millimeter water masers in a sample of low-mass\nSFRs previously known to exhibit 22 GHz emission. We target the transitions at\n183.3, 321.2, and 325.2 GHz, respectively. We also examine their potential as\nprobes of evolutionary stage by comparing them with previously reported Class I\nmethanol masers (MM). We used the APEX 12m telescope. To assess the\nevolutionary stage of each source, we modeled their spectral energy\ndistributions (SEDs) using archival data and used the derived dust temperatures\nas proxies of ages. We then compared the occurrence of water and methanol\nmasers across the sample. We detected 183.3 GHz water masers in 5 out of 18\nsources. IRAS 16293-2422 shows all three transitions, while Serpens FIRS 1 also\ndisplays the 321.2 GHz line. Despite excellent observing conditions, detection\nrates drop with increasing frequency, reflecting both intrinsic line weakness\nand variability. Notably, the brightest (sub)millimeter masers can reach flux\ndensities comparable to the 22 GHz line. Comparisons of velocity profiles show\nthat different transitions often trace distinct gas components. Water masers\ngenerally appear at earlier or comparable evolutionary stages than MM,\nsuggesting no universal maser-based age sequence. Our results demonstrate the\ndetectability of submillimeter water in low-mass SFRs, although their\noccurrence is sparse.

We show that the edges of a cluster's stellar\nprofile -- the primary (Rsp*1) and secondary (Rsp*2) stellar \"splashback\" radii\n-- are sensitive to both continuous mass accretion histories and discrete\nmerger events, making them potentially powerful probes of a cluster's past. We\nfind that Rsp*1 strongly correlates with the cluster's mass ~1 dynamical time\nago, while Rsp*2 traces more recent mass accretion history to a slightly lesser\ndegree. In combination, these features can further distinguish between clusters\nthat have and have not undergone a major merger within the past dynamical time.\nWe use both to predict realistic cluster mass accretion histories with the\nMultiCAM framework. These outer ICL features are significantly more sensitive\nto mass accretion and merger histories than the stellar mass gap and halo\nconcentration, and perform comparably to the commonly used X-ray-based tracer\nof relaxedness, x_off.

NeRF achieves high-fidelity\nnovel view synthesis by learning volumetric representations through neural\nnetworks, but its implicit encoding makes editing and physical interaction\nchallenging. In contrast, GS represents scenes as explicit collections of\nGaussian primitives, enabling real-time rendering, faster training, and more\nintuitive manipulation. This explicit structure has made GS particularly\nwell-suited for interactive editing and integration with physics-based\nsimulation. In this paper, we introduce GENIE (Gaussian Encoding for Neural\nRadiance Fields Interactive Editing), a hybrid model that combines the\nphotorealistic rendering quality of NeRF with the editable and structured\nrepresentation of GS. Instead of using spherical harmonics for appearance\nmodeling, we assign each Gaussian a trainable feature embedding. These\nembeddings are used to condition a NeRF network based on the k nearest\nGaussians to each query point. To make this conditioning efficient, we\nintroduce Ray-Traced Gaussian Proximity Search (RT-GPS), a fast nearest\nGaussian search based on a modified ray-tracing pipeline. We also integrate a\nmulti-resolution hash grid to initialize and update Gaussian features.\nTogether, these components enable real-time, locality-aware editing: as\nGaussian primitives are repositioned or modified, their interpolated influence\nis immediately reflected in the rendered output. By combining the strengths of\nimplicit and explicit representations, GENIE supports intuitive scene\nmanipulation, dynamic interaction, and compatibility with physical simulation,\nbridging the gap between geometry-based editing and neural rendering.

We find that IJEPA models trained with\nfeature LN exhibit loss maps with significant checkerboard-like artifacts. We\npropose that feature LN be replaced with a DynTanh activation as the latter\nbetter preserves token energies and allows high-energy tokens to greater\ncontribute to the prediction loss. We show that IJEPA trained with feature\nDynTanh exhibits a longer-tailed loss distribution and fixes the checkerboard\nartifacts in the loss map. Our empirical results show that our simple\nmodification improves ImageNet linear probe accuracy from 38% to 42.7% for\nViT-Small and reduces RMSE by 0.08 on NYU Depth V2 monocular depth estimation.\nThese results suggest that preserving natural token energies is crucial for\neffective self-supervised visual representation learning.",

We\nfocus on the case of two hat colors and a countably infinite number of players.\nBy strategizing in advance, the players can, in some ways, do much better than\nrandom guessing; using the axiom of choice, they can in fact achieve highly\ncounter-intuitive success. We review some of these results. Then, we use tools\nfrom probability to obtain bounds on how successful a strategy can be under a\nmeasurability hypothesis, in terms of the asymptotic density of the set of\ncorrectly guessing players.

For example, given a $3$-colorable regular one-sided\nexpander, we compute in polynomial time either an independent set of relative\nsize at least $1/2-o(1)$ or a proper $3$-coloring for all but an $o(1)$\nfraction of the vertices, where $o(1)$ stands for a function that tends to $0$\nwith the second largest eigenvalue of the normalized adjacency matrix. This\nresult improves on recent seminal work of Bafna, Hsieh, and Kothari (STOC 2025)\ndeveloping an algorithm that efficiently finds independent sets of relative\nsize at least $0.01$ in such graphs. We also obtain an efficient\n$1.6667$-factor approximation algorithm for VERTEX COVER in sufficiently strong\nregular one-sided expanders, improving over a previous $(2-\\epsilon)$-factor\napproximation in such graphs for an unspecified constant $\\epsilon>0$.\n  We propose a new stratification of $k$-COLORING in terms of $k$-by-$k$\nmatrices akin to predicate sets for constraint satisfaction problems. We prove\nthat whenever this matrix has repeated rows, the corresponding coloring problem\nis NP-hard for one-sided expanders under the Unique Games Conjecture. On the\nother hand, if this matrix has no repeated rows, our algorithms can solve the\ncorresponding coloring problem on one-sided expanders in polynomial time.\n  As starting point for our algorithmic results, we show a property of graph\nspectra that, to the best of our knowledge, has not been observed before: The\nnumber of negative eigenvalues smaller than $-\\tau$ is at most $O(1/\\tau^{2})$\ntimes the number of eigenvalues larger than $\\tau^{2}/2$.

While this dynamical\ntransition reflects in the spectral characteristics, we pursue a broader suite\nof quantum chaos indicators,some of which can be measured on near-term quantum\ndevices. We study deep thermalization of a quantum state ensemble obtained from\na natural unraveling of the subsystem density matrix as an indicator of chaotic\ndynamics. This extends the analysis of quantum chaos to the ensemble of quantum\nstates. Furthermore, we analyze the eigenstate and eigenvalue correlations\nthrough the partial spectral form factor of subsystems and observe distinct\nsignatures of the onset of chaos and its system size dependence, providing\nexperimentally measurable indicators of the localization-to-chaos transition.\nAs a locality-independent probe, we show that the Krylov complexity of\noperators is also maximized in the chaotic regime, providing a link between\ngraph topology and information scrambling. Finally, we investigate a quantum\nanalogue of the Mpemba effect, where initially \"hotter\" states can thermalize\nanomalously fast, a phenomenon most cleanly observed within the chaotic phase.\nHowever, away from the chaotic regime, the system is distinguished by multiple\ncrossings across connectivity in its distance from the thermal ensemble with\ntime.

In contrast to non-reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard\nmodels, it is important in this context to consider the dependence of mobility\ncoefficients on the local concentrations. We show that a homogeneous state that\nis linearly stable for one form of the mobility can be unstable for a different\nform of mobility, an effect that would be impossible in equilibrium and implies\na crucial role for mobilities in non-reciprocal mixtures. For unstable\nhomogeneous states we study the spinodal dynamics governing the onset of phase\nseparation. We find, again in contrast to non-reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard models,\nthat exceptional point transitions between static and oscillatory instabilities\nare generically avoided by first order transitions where the spinodal\nlengthscale changes discontinuously. At these transitions we find intricate\nspinodal dynamics with two competing lengthscales, one governing a static\ninstability and the other an oscillatory instability, i.e. one that generates\ntravelling waves. We demonstrate that, depending on interaction strengths, more\ncomplex transitions can occur in the spinodal dynamics, including coexistence\nof three lengthscales and first order transition lines, terminated by critical\npoints, between distinct static instabilities. Finally, we explore the effects\nof additional non-reciprocity in the interfacial chemical potentials, which\nwould generically be expected when obtaining Model B by coarse graining from a\nnon-reciprocal particle model.

    "abstract": "The proper motion (also known as position drift) field of extragalactic\nsources at cosmological distances across our sky can be used to measure the\nacceleration of the Solar System through the aberration effect. If measured\nvery precisely, the signal would also hold cosmological information, for\ninstance about bulk flows of distant sources or the presence of tensor modes.\nIn the $\\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\\Lambda$CDM) model, the acceleration of the\nSolar System is by far the dominant contributor to the position drift signal\nfor sources at cosmological distances, and the measurement is therefore\nexpected to yield a constant spheroidal dipole across redshifts as long as\nconvergence to the cosmic restframe has been reached. The aim of this paper is\nto test this hypothesis. We analyze data from the cosmic reference frame\ndataset of Gaia data release 3 focusing on constraining the dipole and\nquadrupole in the position drift signal, with an emphasis on redshift\ndependence of the signal as a consistency test of the $\\Lambda$CDM model. The\nspheroidal dipole that we find is in mild tension, at the level of $2-3\\sigma$,\nwith the constant-in-redshift signature expected from the local acceleration of\nthe Solar System. We also find significant quadrupole components, that however\ndo not have any significant evolution with redshift. The most straightforward\ninterpretation of these findings is (unknown) systematic errors related to the\nGaia instrumentation, but a cosmological origin is a possibility. Our analysis\nremains inconclusive on the cause of the redshift dependence of the dipole and\nwarrants further investigations with upcoming data releases. We discuss\npossible implications of our results and highlight the importance of proper\nmotion measurements for rest frame determinations in cosmology. In our\ndiscussion, we highlight interesting avenues for doing cosmology with Gaia\ndata.",

    "abstract": "Video virtual try-on (VVT) technology has garnered considerable academic\ninterest owing to its promising applications in e-commerce advertising and\nentertainment. However, most existing end-to-end methods rely heavily on scarce\npaired garment-centric datasets and fail to effectively leverage priors of\nadvanced visual models and test-time inputs, making it challenging to\naccurately preserve fine-grained garment details and maintain temporal\nconsistency in unconstrained scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose\nDreamVVT, a carefully designed two-stage framework built upon Diffusion\nTransformers (DiTs), which is inherently capable of leveraging diverse unpaired\nhuman-centric data to enhance adaptability in real-world scenarios. To further\nleverage prior knowledge from pretrained models and test-time inputs, in the\nfirst stage, we sample representative frames from the input video and utilize a\nmulti-frame try-on model integrated with a vision-language model (VLM), to\nsynthesize high-fidelity and semantically consistent keyframe try-on images.\nThese images serve as complementary appearance guidance for subsequent video\ngeneration. \\textbf{In the second stage}, skeleton maps together with\nfine-grained motion and appearance descriptions are extracted from the input\ncontent, and these along with the keyframe try-on images are then fed into a\npretrained video generation model enhanced with LoRA adapters. This ensures\nlong-term temporal coherence for unseen regions and enables highly plausible\ndynamic motions. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate\nthat DreamVVT surpasses existing methods in preserving detailed garment content\nand temporal stability in real-world scenarios.

This paper presents a real-world testbed evaluation of\nprotocol-compliant Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks using User Datagram Protocol\n(UDP) flooding and oversized Basic Safety Message (BSM) attacks that 7 exploit\ntransport- and application-layer vulnerabilities in C-V2X.

Using a real-world connected\nvehicle 11 testbed with commercially available On-Board Units (OBUs), we\ndemonstrate that high-rate UDP flooding and oversized payload of BSM flooding\ncan severely degrade FCW performance. Results show that UDP flooding alone\nreduces packet delivery ratio by up to 87% and increases latency to over 400ms,\nwhile oversized BSM floods overload receiver processing resources, delaying or\ncompletely suppressing FCW alerts. When UDP and BSM attacks are executed\nsimultaneously, they cause near-total communication failure, preventing FCW\nwarnings entirely.

However, very little is still known\nabout the astrophysical $\\bar{\\nu}:\\nu$\n  ratio. The only prior measurement is the recent, single Glashow event seen by\nIceCube. Understanding the astrophysical $\\bar{\\nu}:\\nu$\n  ratio has a bearing on multiple questions, including the astrophysical\nspectral shape and neutrino production mechanisms. This analysis uses a new\napproach to measuring the astrophysical muon $\\bar{\\nu}:\\nu$ ratio at various\nenergies. It uses inelasticity, the fraction of the initial neutrino energy\ncarried away by the hadronic shower. Inelasticity probes the $\\bar{\\nu}:\\nu$\n  ratio due to the fact that at energies below roughly 100 TeV, valence quarks\ndominate in deep inelastic scattering interactions, leading to different\nneutrino and antineutrino inelasticities and cross-sections. We use 10.3 years\nof IceCube data consisting of starting tracks at energies between 1 TeV and 1\nPeV with a self-veto selection that enhances astrophysical event purity in the\ndown-going direction. Based on this sample and analysis method, we present the\nfirst measurement of the astrophysical $\\bar{\\nu}:\\nu$\n  ratio at sub-PeV energies.",

While\npowerful, for scientists to maximize utility of AI in scientific discovery,\nthey not only require accuracy and transparency in reasoning, but also\nsteerability. Hence, we introduce an alternative approach that enables deep and\nprecise control over the reasoning process called: a cognitive loop via in-situ\noptimization (CLIO).

Through CLIO's open design, scientists can observe uncertainty\nlevels, understand how final belief states are formulated using graph\nstructures, and interject corrections.

For the first class of protocols, the duration\nof the pulse is changed randomly by an amplitude $dT$ while for the second\nclass we use a random/quasiperiodic dipolar drive, where the quasiperiodicity\nis implemented using the Thue-Morse (TM) or Fibonacci sequences. For both\nprotocols, we identify parameter regimes for which the thermalization of the\ndriven chain is drastically slowed down due to proximity to a two-rate drive\ninduced exact dynamical freezing. We also study the properties of these driven\nsystem moving slightly away from the freezing limit.

We find that the scattering of\nbicircular pulses probes the present magnon quantum geometry, even if the\nmagnonic topology is trivial. Hence, our findings establish bicircular Raman\nresponse as an optical effect of choice to identify altermagnetic magnons.

    "abstract": "The Euclid survey aims to trace the evolution of cosmic structures up to\nredshift $z$ $\\sim$ 3 and beyond. Its success depends critically on obtaining\nhighly accurate mean redshifts for ensembles of galaxies $n(z)$ in all\ntomographic bins, essential for deriving robust cosmological constraints.\nHowever, photometric redshifts (photo-$z$s) suffer from systematic biases\narising from various sources of uncertainty. To address these challenges, we\nutilised self-organising maps (SOMs) with mock samples resembling the Euclid\nWide Survey (EWS), to validate Euclid's uncertainty requirement of\n$|\\Delta\\langle z \\rangle| = \\langle z_{\\text{est}} \\rangle - \\langle z \\rangle\n\\leq 0.002 (1+z)$ per tomographic bin, assuming DR3-level data. We observe that\ndefining the redshift tomography using the mean spectroscopic redshift\n(spec-$z$) per SOM cell, results in none of the ten tomographic redshift bins\nsatisfying the requirement. In contrast, the redshift tomography on the\nphoto-$z$s of the EWS-like sample yields superior results, with eight out of\nten bins [$0 < z\\leq 2.5$] meeting the Euclid requirement. To enhance the\nrealism of our study, we morph our calibration sample to mimic the C3R2 survey\nin incremental steps. In this context, a maximum of six out of ten bins meet\nthe requirement, strongly advocating the adoption of a redshift tomography\ndefined by the photo-$z$s of individual galaxies rather than the commonly used\nmean spec-$z$ of SOM cells. To examine the impact on the expected biases for\n$\\Omega_{\\text{m}}$, $\\sigma_{8}$, and $\\Delta w_{0}$ measured by Euclid, we\nperform a Fisher forecast for cosmic shear only, based on our redshift\nuncertainties. Here, we find that even under an evaluation of the uncertainty\nwhere the impact of the redshift bias is substantial, most absolute biases\nremain below 0.1$\\sigma$ in the idealised scenario and below 0.3$\\sigma$ in the\nmore realistic case.",

    "abstract": "The particle origin of dark matter (DM) remains elusive despite decades of\ndirect, indirect, and collider searches. Several groups have reported a\n$\\gamma$-ray excess toward the Galactic Centre, commonly referred to as the\nGalactic Centre Excess (GCE). Its spectrum is consistent with annihilation of\nweakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) of mass $\\mathcal{O}(10-100)$ GeV\nand a thermal-relic cross section. Although many concrete WIMP models reproduce\nthe GCE spectrum, most are now excluded by direct detection experiments that\nare approaching the neutrino floor. We investigate a class of anomaly-free\nextensions of the Standard Model featuring gauged differences of lepton number,\n$U(1)_{L_i-L_j}$, and gauged baryon minus lepton number, $U(1)_{B-L}$. We show\nthat these models can reproduce the GCE while remaining compatible with the\nobserved relic abundance. We then impose collider and direct detection\nconstraints, accounting for both tree-level and loop-induced kinetic mixing.\nThe $L_\\mu-L_e$ model gives the best fit to the GCE: a DM mass of $m_\\chi\\sim\n40-50$ GeV remains consistent with the muon and electron magnetic moment\nanomalies, $(g-2)_{\\mu,e}$, as well as current collider and direct detection\nlimits, for mediator masses in the range $m_{A'}\\sim 70-86$ GeV and a\nDM-mediator coupling of $(1-5)\\times10^{-2}$. By contrast, the $L_e-L_\\tau$ and\n$L_\\mu-L_\\tau$ models yield poorer fits; satisfying both the relic density and\nexperimental bounds forces the DM mass to lie very close to resonance (i.e.,\napproximately half the mediator mass). Finally, while the $B-L$ model also\nmatches the GCE well, its parameter space is almost entirely ruled out by\nstrong direct detection limits, except for the narrow resonance region where\n$m_\\chi$ should be equal to $m_{A'}/2$ requiring a fine-tuning at the\nfew-percent level.",

In this\nwork, we analyse these observations to assess the robustness of these reported\nresults. While our analysis indicates that the data support additional angular\nstructure in the lensing mass distribution beyond an elliptical power-law\ndensity profile, we do not find evidence for two previously reported sub-halo\ndetections. However, we verify with realistic mock data that we could have\nfound evidence in favour of a previously reported $\\approx 10^{9}\\,{\\rm\nM_{\\odot}}$ sub-halo with a log Bayes factor of 29, should it exist in the real\ndata. After testing various systematics, we find that this previous sub-halo\ninference was most likely spurious and resulted from an inadequate smooth\nmodel, specifically, poorly fitting multipoles. While we do not find evidence\nin favour of any individual sub-halo, we find evidence for similarity in the\nlensing signatures of multipoles ($m=3,4$) and single massive sub-haloes,\nconsistent with other recent work. We suggest that future searches for low-mass\nhaloes in lensed arcs include lens angular structure in the form of multipoles\nup to 4th order and require a good-fitting smooth model as a prerequisite.\nOverall, our findings demonstrate the suitability of ALMA data of this quality\nto simultaneously constrain the abundance of low-mass haloes and lens angular\nstructure.",

Our fully open recipe consists of: (1) systematic data\ncuration for both text-only and image-text medical data, filtered according to\nvarying levels of reasoning difficulty, and (2) two training paradigms:\nSupervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on distilled reasoning traces and Reinforcement\nLearning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) based on final answer correctness.\nAcross extensive experiments on the Qwen2.5-VL model family (3B, 7B) and six\nmedical QA benchmarks, we find that RLVR consistently and significantly\noutperforms SFT. Additionally, under the RLVR framework, a key,\ncounter-intuitive finding is that training on our curated text-only reasoning\ndata provides a more substantial performance boost than training on multimodal\nimage-text data. Our best open 7B model, trained using the RLVR recipe on\ntext-only data, establishes a new state-of-the-art on existing public VQA\nbenchmarks, surpassing all previous open-source medical LMMs. Furthermore,\nscaling our model to 32B achieves performance on par with the proprietary\nGPT-4o.

Recent studies\nhave investigated the use of low-rank parameterization as a means of reducing\nmodel size and training cost. In this context, sparsity is often employed as a\ncomplementary technique to recover important information lost in low-rank\ncompression by capturing salient features in the residual space. However,\nexisting approaches typically combine low-rank and sparse components in a\nsimplistic or ad hoc manner, often resulting in undesirable performance\ndegradation compared to full-rank training.

LOST applies singular value decomposition to weight matrices,\npreserving the dominant low-rank components, while allocating the remaining\nsingular values to construct channel-wise sparse components to complement the\nexpressiveness of low-rank training. We evaluate LOST on LLM pretraining\nranging from 60M to 7B parameters.

    "abstract": "The Worldvolume Hybrid Monte Carlo (WV-HMC) method [arXiv:2012.08468] is an\nefficient and versatile algorithm that simultaneously mitigates both the sign\nproblem and the ergodicity problem -- the latter being intrinsic to algorithms\nbased on Lefschetz thimbles. We consider a situation in which the maximum flow\ntime can be set to a small value, as occurs when WV-HMC is applied to the doped\nHubbard model using a nonphysical redundant parameter. An optimal choice of\nthis parameter significantly reduces the sign problem on the original\nintegration surface and allows the maximum flow time to remain small, a feature\nthat facilitates increasing the system size while keeping the computation time\nmodest. However, as the worldvolume becomes a thin layer, it becomes\nincreasingly difficult to explore it efficiently, leading to potential\nergodicity issues. To overcome this limitation, we propose embedding the\nGeneralized-thimble HMC (GT-HMC) into the WV-HMC framework. GT-HMC performs HMC\nupdates on a deformed surface at a fixed flow time. Although it suffers from\nergodicity issues due to infinitely high potential barriers at the zeros of the\nBoltzmann weight, it enables more efficient exploration within the allowed\nregion. Furthermore, its molecular dynamics step size can typically be taken to\nbe larger than in WV-HMC. GT-HMC is thus better suited for sampling regions\nwhere ergodicity issues are not serious. We provide a proof that GT-HMC can be\nembedded within the WV-HMC algorithm, and verify that the two methods -- the\npure WV-HMC and the combined version -- yield consistent results within\nstatistical errors for the two-dimensional doped Hubbard model on a $6 \\times\n6$ spatial lattice at $T/\\kappa = 1/6.4\\simeq 0.156$ and $U/\\kappa = 8.0$ with\nTrotter number $N_t = 20$ ($\\kappa$: hopping parameter).",

The goal for the nodes is to remain as\nfresh as possible, i.e., have the same information as the source, which we\nassess by the long-term average binary freshness metric. We introduce a smart\nmechanism of information dissemination which we coin rate-changing gossip\n(RC-Gossip). Its main idea is that gossiping is directed towards nodes that\nneed it the most, and hence the rate of gossiping changes based on the number\nof fresh nodes in the network at a given time. While Stochastic Hybrid System\n(SHS) analysis has been the norm in studying freshness of gossip networks, we\npresent an equivalent way to analyze freshness using a renewal-reward-based\napproach. Using that, we show that RC-gossip significantly increases freshness\nof nodes in different clustered networks, with optimal cluster sizes, compared\nto traditional gossiping techniques.",

Nevertheless,\ndiffusion policies suffer from diffusion representation collapse: semantically\nsimilar observations are mapped to indistinguishable features, ultimately\nimpairing their ability to handle subtle but critical variations required for\ncomplex robotic manipulation. To address this problem, we propose D2PPO\n(Diffusion Policy Policy Optimization with Dispersive Loss). D2PPO introduces\ndispersive loss regularization that combats representation collapse by treating\nall hidden representations within each batch as negative pairs. D2PPO compels\nthe network to learn discriminative representations of similar observations,\nthereby enabling the policy to identify subtle yet crucial differences\nnecessary for precise manipulation. In evaluation, we find that early-layer\nregularization benefits simple tasks, while late-layer regularization sharply\nenhances performance on complex manipulation tasks. On RoboMimic benchmarks,\nD2PPO achieves an average improvement of 22.7% in pre-training and 26.1% after\nfine-tuning, setting new SOTA results.

    "abstract": "Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP) of molecular crystals plays a central role\nin applications, such as pharmaceuticals and organic electronics. CSP is\nchallenging and computationally expensive due to the need to explore a large\nsearch space with sufficient accuracy to capture energy differences of a few\nkJ/mol between polymorphs. Dispersion-inclusive density functional theory (DFT)\nprovides the required accuracy but its computational cost is impractical for a\nlarge number of putative structures. We introduce FastCSP, an open-source,\nhigh-throughput CSP workflow based on machine learning interatomic potentials\n(MLIPs). FastCSP combines random structure generation using Genarris 3.0 with\ngeometry relaxation and free energy calculations powered entirely by the\nUniversal Model for Atoms (UMA) MLIP. We benchmark FastCSP on a curated set of\n28 mostly rigid molecules, demonstrating that our workflow consistently\ngenerates known experimental structures and ranks them within 5 kJ/mol per\nmolecule of the global minimum. Our results demonstrate that universal MLIPs\ncan be used across diverse compounds without requiring system-specific tuning.\nMoreover, the speed and accuracy afforded by UMA eliminate the need for\nclassical force fields in the early stages of CSP and for final re-ranking with\nDFT. The open-source release of the entire FastCSP workflow significantly\nlowers the barrier to accessing CSP. CSP results for a single system can be\nobtained within hours on tens of modern GPUs, making high-throughput crystal\nstructure prediction feasible for a broad range of scientific applications.",

Within a one-hour limit for large-scale problems, the model\nfinds solutions with small optimality gaps for instances up to 80 aircraft and\nprovides strong bounds for problems with up to 160 aircraft. Optimized plans\nconsistently increase hangar throughput (e.g., +33% serviced aircraft vs. a\nheuristic on instance RND-N030-I03), leading to lower delay penalties and\nhigher asset utilization.

We show how our pattern system relates to existing visualization\ntheory and highlight opportunities for visualization design.

For individual FMM operators,\nthis approach achieves a speedup of 20- to 50-fold. We further evaluate the\nnumerical performance of the enhanced DA-FMM and benchmark it against two\nstate-of-the-art FMM implementations, pyfmmlib and the traceless Cartesian\ntensor-based FMM, for the Coulomb potential. For relative errors on the order\nof $10^{-7}$ or higher, the enhanced DA-FMM consistently outperforms both\nalternatives.",

    "abstract": "Attention is not monolithic; rather, it operates in multiple forms to\nfacilitate efficient cognitive processing. In the auditory domain, attention\nenables the prioritization of relevant sounds in an auditory scene and can be\neither attracted by elements in the scene in a bottom-up fashion or directed\ntowards features, objects, or the entire scene in a top-down fashion. How these\nmodes of attention interact and whether their neural underpinnings are distinct\nremains unclear. In this work, we investigate the perceptual and neural\ncorrelates of different attentional modes in a controlled \"cocktail party\"\nparadigm, where listeners listen to the same stimuli and attend to either a\nspatial location (feature-based), a speaker (object-based), or the entire scene\n(global or free-listening) while detecting deviations in pitch of a voice in\nthe scene. Our findings indicate that object-based attention is more\nperceptually effective than feature-based or global attention. Furthermore,\nobject-based and spatial-based attention engage distinct neural mechanisms and\nare differentially modulated by bottom-up salience. Notably, while bottom-up\nsalience aids in the initial segregation of auditory objects, it plays a\nreduced role in object tracking once attention has been voluntarily allocated.\nIn addition, decoding the stimulus envelope from the EEG data revealed a\nsource-sampling scheme in the global attention mode that is not present in the\nobject or spatial modes. Overall, the study shows that the perception of the\nsame acoustic scene differs according to the listening task, guided by an\ninteraction between top-down and bottom-up processes.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Model (LLM) systems have been at the forefront of applied\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) research in a multitude of domains. One such\ndomain is software development, where researchers have pushed the automation of\na number of code tasks through LLM agents. Software development is a complex\necosystem, that stretches far beyond code implementation and well into the\nrealm of code maintenance. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent system to\nlocalize bugs in large pre-existing codebases using information retrieval and\nLLMs. Our system introduces a novel Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)\napproach, Meta-RAG, where we utilize summaries to condense codebases by an\naverage of 79.8\\%, into a compact, structured, natural language representation.\nWe then use an LLM agent to determine which parts of the codebase are critical\nfor bug resolution, i.e. bug localization. We demonstrate the usefulness of\nMeta-RAG through evaluation with the SWE-bench Lite dataset. Meta-RAG scores\n84.67 % and 53.0 % for file-level and function-level correct localization\nrates, respectively, achieving state-of-the-art performance.",

To better leverage offsite conversion data\nand explore the connection between onsite and offsite activities, we\nconstructed a large-scale heterogeneous graph based on users' onsite ad\ninteractions and opt-in offsite conversion activities. Furthermore, we\nintroduced TransRA (TransR\\cite{TransR} with Anchors), a novel Knowledge Graph\nEmbedding (KGE) model, to more efficiently integrate graph embeddings into Ads\nranking models.

To address this challenge, we employed the\nLarge ID Embedding Table technique and innovated an attention based KGE\nfinetuning approach within the Ads ranking models.

Spectra were recorded with the\nMichigan/Magellan Fiber System located on the Magellan-Clay 6.5m telescope.\nSpectra were visually inspected to assess the presence of stellar H$\\alpha$\nemission lines attributed to B stars rotating close to breakup velocity (Be\nstars). High fractions of Be stars in the cluster typically indicate the\npresence of a large population of fast rotating stars, predicted by some models\nto explain the observed split and extended main sequence. There are numerous Be\nstar candidates in NGC 1856, exhibiting weak but broad H$\\alpha$ emission.\nHowever, only one such target was detected in NGC 1953.

These\nresults provide essential constraints for the different scenarios attempting to\nexplain the bimodal distribution of rotational velocities and the multiple\npopulations of stars observed in globular clusters. The impact of stellar\nradial velocity and nebular emission on photometric measures is assessed\nthrough simulations relying on the spectra. These simulations suggest that\nphotometric studies can under-estimate the fraction of H$\\alpha$ emitters in a\ncluster, in particular for stars with relatively weak emission features. The\nresults also show that nebular emission has minimal impact on the photometric\nH$\\alpha$ excesses.",

We have stabilized the epsilon-WO3 at room temperature (RT) and\nnanostructured powders via flame spray pyrolysis synthesis. These nanopowders\nare drop cast into uniform thin films to enable RT measurement of ferroelectric\nand optoelectronic properties. We report ferroelectric hysteresis, nanoscale\ndomains, and dipole switching measured via Piezo-response force microscopy\n(PFM). The epsilon-WO3 films also display optical second harmonic generation\n(SHG) and anticlockwise ferroelectric butterfly capacitance versus voltage\nhysteresis, further demonstrating the ferroelectric nature of epsilon-WO3.\nRemarkably, epsilon-WO3 shows ferroelectric polarization responses to optical\nstimuli and form bipolaron at RT, a spin-zero quasiparticle previously found\nonly in cryogenic temperatures. The bipolaron formation and its interaction\nwith electro-optical stimuli results in a single layer solid-state blue\ncoloration, a ferrochromic effect. A mechanism of the ferrochromic effect is\ndiscussed. In summary, epsilon-WO3 appears to be a ferroelectric with the\nsimplest structure, forming bosonic spin-zero bipolaron at RT, and it's dipoles\nrespond to opto-electrical signals; therefore, this material holds significant\npromise for transforming the field of optoelectronics.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain is a decentralised, immutable ledger technology that has been\nwidely adopted in many sectors for various applications such as\ncryptocurrencies, smart contracts and supply chain management. Distributed\nconsensus is a fundamental component of blockchain, which is required to ensure\ntrust, security, and integrity of the data stored and the transactions\nprocessed in the blockchain. Various consensus algorithms have been developed,\neach affected from certain issues such as node failures, high resource\nconsumption, collusion, etc. This work introduces a fully decentralised\nconsensus protocol, Blockchain Epidemic Consensus Protocol (BECP), suitable for\nvery large and extreme-scale blockchain systems. The proposed approach\nleverages the benefits of epidemic protocols, such as no reliance on a fixed\nset of validators or leaders, probabilistic guarantees of convergence,\nefficient use of network resources, and tolerance to node and network failures.\nA comparative experimental analysis has been carried out with traditional\nprotocols including PAXOS, RAFT, and Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance\n(PBFT), as well as a relatively more recent protocol such as Avalanche, which\nis specifically designed for very large-scale systems. The results illustrate\nhow BECP outperforms them in terms of throughput, scalability and consensus\nlatency. BECP achieves an average of 1.196 times higher throughput in terms of\nconsensus on items and 4.775 times better average consensus latency.\nFurthermore, BECP significantly reduces the number of messages compared to\nAvalanche. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of fully\ndecentralised consensus for blockchain technology based on epidemic protocols.",

The presence of a complete integral enables the exclusion of the\ntransversality conditions, which introduce significant complexity to the\nboundary value problem.

A\ncommon conjecture is that language models' reliance on subword units, rather\nthan characters, contributes to their struggles with character-level tasks, yet\nrecent studies offer conflicting conclusions about the role of tokenization,\nleaving its impact unclear. To address this gap, we introduce CharBench, a\ncomprehensive benchmark of character-level tasks that is two orders of\nmagnitude larger than existing alternatives. We evaluate a diverse range of\nleading open-weight and proprietary models on CharBench and find that it\npresents a significant challenge to modern LLMs, with an average accuracy of\n43.6% and 32.3% on some tasks. We present an in-depth analysis of how intrinsic\nproperties of words and their segmentations into tokens correspond to model\nperformance. For counting tasks, we find that tokenization properties are\nweakly correlated with correctness, while the length of the queried word and\nthe actual character count play a more significant part. In contrast, for tasks\nrequiring intra-word positional understanding, performance is negatively\ncorrelated with the length of the token containing the queried character,\nsuggesting that longer tokens obscure character position information for LLMs.\nWe encourage future work to build on the benchmark and evaluation methodology\nintroduced here as tools for improving model performance on such tasks.",

This process creates an inspectable\npathway from the initial arguments to the final claim verification decisions,\nproviding a faithful justification thereof. We show experimentally that MArgE\ncan significantly outperform single LLMs, including three open-source models\n(4B to 8B parameters), GPT-4o-mini and existing ArgLLMs, as well as prior\nmethods for unstructured multi-LLM debates.

In the reasoning stage, given a new question, CAMA\ndynamically extracts a task-relevant subgraph from the MCG, conditioned on both\nthe question content and the LLM's intermediate reasoning trace. This subgraph,\nwhich encodes the most pertinent knowledge points and their causal\ndependencies, is then injected back into the LLM to guide its reasoning\nprocess.

The prevailing theory, a critical-layer resonance mechanism\nproposed by Miles (1957), has seen numerous refinements; yet, the role of\nLagrangian drift -- the velocity a fluid parcel actually experiences -- in wave\ngrowth was not understood. Our analysis first recovers the classic Miles growth\nrate from linear theory before extending it to third order in the wave slope to\nderive a modified growth rate. The leading-order wave-induced mean flow alters\nthe higher-order instability, manifesting as a suppression of growth with\nincreasing wave steepness for the realistic wind profiles considered. This\nresult is qualitatively consistent with observations. An integral momentum\nbudget suggests that the wave-induced current alters the coupling between the\ntotal phase speed and the total Lagrangian mean flow at the critical level (as\ndefined in the linear theory), thereby reducing the efficiency of momentum\ntransfer. Notably, this Lagrangian drift is precisely what Doppler-shift based\nremote sensing of upper ocean currents measure, providing a direct\nobservational pathway to account for this wave-induced feedback in studies of\nair-sea coupling.

With the growing adoption of autonomous and\nconnected vehicles, the accurate estimation of safe speed at curves is becoming\nincreasingly important. The widely used AASHTO design method for safe curve\nspeed estimation relies on an analytical equation based on a simplified point\nmass model, which often uses conservative parameters to account for vehicular\nand environmental variations. This paper presents a digital twin-based\nframework for estimating safe speed at curves using a physics-driven virtual\nenvironment developed in the Unity engine. In this framework, a real-world\nhorizontal road curve is selected, and vehicle speed data are collected using a\nradar gun under various weather conditions. A 3D model of the road curve is\nconstructed in a Unity environment using roadway geometric and elevation data.\nA parameterized vehicle model is integrated, allowing for variations in mass,\nacceleration, and center of gravity to reflect different vehicle types and\nloading scenarios. This simulation identifies the maximum safe speed at which a\nvehicle can traverse the given curve, providing a more vehicle and\nenvironment-specific estimate of the safe operating speed. The study validated\nthat the safe curve speed estimates generated by the simulation were consistent\nwith the real-world speed values observed at a curve.

A recently proposed SQD variant,\nSample-based Krylov Quantum Diagonalization (SKQD), uses quantum Krylov states\nas circuits from which samples are collected.

To evaluate the impact of annotation quality on model\nperformance, we created three versions of the training data: a fully supervised\nset with all labels reviewed by humans, a semi-supervised set with 50% human\nreview, and an unsupervised set with only machine-generated labels. We\nfine-tuned two transformer models on these datasets for both aspect and\nsentiment classification. Experimental results show that our Arabic-specific\nmodel achieved high accuracy even with minimal human supervision, reflecting\nonly a minor performance drop when using ChatGPT-only labels. Reducing the\nnumber of aspect classes notably improved classification metrics across the\nboard. These findings demonstrate an effective, scalable approach to Arabic\naspect-based sentiment analysis (SA) in healthcare, combining large language\nmodel annotation with human expertise to produce a robust and explainable\ndataset.

We explain and generalize these empirical observations with a\ntheoretical model examining how OCGs strategically select which area to exploit\nbased on expected revenue and the presence of other OCGs. We prove our results\nfor three OCGs analytically and extend them to larger numbers of OCGs through\nnumerical simulations. Both approaches suggest that, when the frequency of OCG\nactivity is sufficiently high, each OCG controls one area, while the violence\nbetween OCGs remains low across all areas. When the frequency of OCG activity\nreduces, violent collisions between OCGs occur in the areas yielding the\nhighest revenue, while some OCGs retain control over the medium-revenue areas.\nOur results suggest important policy recommendations. Firstly, if interventions\nare only violence-driven, they might miss critical underlying factors.\nSecondly, police operations might have unintended negative externalities in\nother areas of a city when they target criminal property rights, like increased\nviolence in the areas yielding the highest revenue.",

We performed the first\nlarge-scale, systematic comparison of XAI methods on ~45,000 structural brain\nMRIs using a novel XAI validation framework. This framework establishes\nverifiable ground truth by constructing prediction tasks with known signal\nsources - from localized anatomical features to subject-specific clinical\nlesions - without artificially altering input images. Our analysis reveals\nsystematic failures in two of the most widely used methods: GradCAM\nconsistently failed to localize predictive features, while Layer-wise Relevance\nPropagation generated extensive, artifactual explanations that suggest\nincompatibility with neuroimaging data characteristics. Our results indicate\nthat these failures stem from a domain mismatch, where methods with design\nprinciples tailored to natural images require substantial adaptation for\nneuroimaging data. In contrast, the simpler, gradient-based method SmoothGrad,\nwhich makes fewer assumptions about data structure, proved consistently\naccurate, suggesting its conceptual simplicity makes it more robust to this\ndomain shift. These findings highlight the need for domain-specific adaptation\nand validation of XAI methods, suggest that interpretations from prior\nneuroimaging studies using standard XAI methodology warrant re-evaluation, and\nprovide urgent guidance for practical application of XAI in neuroimaging.",

    "abstract": "Accurate whole-heart segmentation is a critical component in the precise\ndiagnosis and interventional planning of cardiovascular diseases. Integrating\ncomplementary information from modalities such as computed tomography (CT) and\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can significantly enhance segmentation\naccuracy and robustness. However, existing multi-modal segmentation methods\nface several limitations: severe spatial inconsistency between modalities\nhinders effective feature fusion; fusion strategies are often static and lack\nadaptability; and the processes of feature alignment and segmentation are\ndecoupled and inefficient. To address these challenges, we propose a\ndual-branch U-Net architecture enhanced by reinforcement learning for feature\nalignment, termed RL-U$^2$Net, designed for precise and efficient multi-modal\n3D whole-heart segmentation. The model employs a dual-branch U-shaped network\nto process CT and MRI patches in parallel, and introduces a novel RL-XAlign\nmodule between the encoders. The module employs a cross-modal attention\nmechanism to capture semantic correspondences between modalities and a\nreinforcement-learning agent learns an optimal rotation strategy that\nconsistently aligns anatomical pose and texture features. The aligned features\nare then reconstructed through their respective decoders. Finally, an\nensemble-learning-based decision module integrates the predictions from\nindividual patches to produce the final segmentation result. Experimental\nresults on the publicly available MM-WHS 2017 dataset demonstrate that the\nproposed RL-U$^2$Net outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving\nDice coefficients of 93.1% on CT and 87.0% on MRI, thereby validating the\neffectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach.",

Nevertheless, here we show that a similar intuition can be\nfleshed out in a different way: whenever an agent is able to perform a\nregulation task, it is possible for an observer to interpret it as having\n\"beliefs\" about its environment, which it \"updates\" in response to sensory\ninput. This notion of belief updating provides a notion of model that is more\nsophisticated than Conant and Ashby's, as well as a theorem that is more\nbroadly applicable. However, it necessitates a change in perspective, in that\nthe observer plays an essential role in the theory: models are not a mere\nproperty of the system but are imposed on it from outside. Our theorem holds\nregardless of whether the system is regulating its environment in a classic\ncontrol theory setup, or whether it's regulating its own internal state; the\nmodel is of its environment either way. The model might be trivial, however,\nand this is how the apparent counterexamples are resolved.",

This mechanism is incorporated into\nReynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations, coupled with the\nSpalart-Allmaras (SA) turbulence model, considering both $\\gamma$ and\n$\\gamma$-${\\widetilde{\\mathrm{Re}}_{\\theta,t}}$ transition frameworks.

To this end, the intermittency equation is reformulated in\nlogarithmic form and further stabilized through an energy--based limiting to\nbound excessively high positive values. In order to suppress unphysical\npressure oscillations in the transition region, a gradient-driven artificial\nviscosity is also introduced. Additionally, the SA equation is augmented with\nstrain-rate modulated production and rotation correction terms.

Related studies on Queen domination, such as Tarnai and\nG\\'asp\\'ar (2007), focus on minimizing the number of Queens needed for full\nboard coverage. Our approach, by contrast, fixes the number of Queens and\nanalyzes optimal cover via a certain loss-function due to {\\em internal loss}\nand {\\em decentralization}. We demonstrate how the internal loss can be\ndecomposed in terms of defined concepts, {\\em balance} and {\\em overlap\nconcentration}.

This suggests that the benefits\nattributed to complex sequencemixers might instead emerge from other\narchitectural or optimization factors. Based on this observation, we pose a\ncentral question: Are common sequence mixers necessary for time-series\nanalysis? Therefore, we propose JustDense, an empirical study that\nsystematically replaces sequence mixers in various well-established TSA models\nwith dense layers. Grounded in the MatrixMixer framework, JustDense treats any\nsequence mixer as a mixing matrix and replaces it with a dense layer. This\nsubstitution isolates the mixing operation, enabling a clear theoretical\nfoundation for understanding its role. Therefore, we conducted extensive\nexperiments on 29 benchmarks covering five representative TSA tasks using seven\nstate-of-the-art TSA models to address our research question. The results show\nthat replacing sequence mixers with dense layers yields comparable or even\nsuperior performance. In the cases where dedicated sequence mixers still offer\nbenefits, JustDense challenges the assumption that \"deeper and more complex\narchitectures are inherently better\" in TSA.",

However, the persistent hubness problem, a phenomenon where\na small number of targets frequently appear as nearest neighbors to numerous\nqueries, continues to hinder the precision of similarity measurements. Despite\nseveral proposed methods to reduce hubness, their underlying mechanisms remain\npoorly understood.

To mitigate this issue, we introduce Dual Bank Sinkhorn\nNormalization (DBSN), incorporating a corresponding target bank alongside the\nquery bank to narrow this distributional gap.

    "abstract": "The energy efficiency of neural processing units (NPU) is playing a critical\nrole in developing sustainable data centers. Our study with different\ngenerations of NPU chips reveals that 30%-72% of their energy consumption is\ncontributed by static power dissipation, due to the lack of power management\nsupport in modern NPU chips. In this paper, we present ReGate, which enables\nfine-grained power-gating of each hardware component in NPU chips with\nhardware/software co-design. Unlike conventional power-gating techniques for\ngeneric processors, enabling power-gating in NPUs faces unique challenges due\nto the fundamental difference in hardware architecture and program execution\nmodel. To address these challenges, we carefully investigate the power-gating\nopportunities in each component of NPU chips and decide the best-fit power\nmanagement scheme (i.e., hardware- vs. software-managed power gating).\nSpecifically, for systolic arrays (SAs) that have deterministic execution\npatterns, ReGate enables cycle-level power gating at the granularity of\nprocessing elements (PEs) following the inherent dataflow execution in SAs. For\ninter-chip interconnect (ICI) and HBM controllers that have long idle\nintervals, ReGate employs a lightweight hardware-based idle-detection\nmechanism. For vector units and SRAM whose idle periods vary significantly\ndepending on workload patterns, ReGate extends the NPU ISA and allows software\nlike compilers to manage the power gating. With implementation on a\nproduction-level NPU simulator, we show that ReGate can reduce the energy\nconsumption of NPU chips by up to 32.8% (15.5% on average), with negligible\nimpact on AI workload performance. The hardware implementation of power-gating\nlogic introduces less than 3.3% overhead in NPU chips.",

    "abstract": "The hierarchical architecture of Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) has\nenabled a new Federated Learning (FL) paradigm that trains models using data\nfrom non- and near-real-time (near-RT) Radio Intelligent Controllers (RICs).\nHowever, the ever-increasing model size leads to longer training time,\njeopardizing the deadline requirements for both non-RT and near-RT RICs. To\naddress this issue, split federated learning (SFL) offers an approach by\noffloading partial model layers from near-RT-RIC to high-performance\nnon-RT-RIC. Nonetheless, its deployment presents two challenges: (i) Frequent\ndata/gradient transfers between near-RT-RIC and non-RT-RIC in SFL incur\nsignificant communication cost in O-RAN. (ii) Proper allocation of\ncomputational and communication resources in O-RAN is vital to satisfying the\ndeadline and affects SFL convergence. Therefore, we propose SplitMe, an SFL\nframework that exploits mutual learning to alternately and independently train\nthe near-RT-RIC's model and the non-RT-RIC's inverse model, eliminating\nfrequent transfers. The ''inverse'' of the inverse model is derived via a\nzeroth-order technique to integrate the final model. Then, we solve a joint\noptimization problem for SplitMe to minimize overall resource costs with\ndeadline-aware selection of near-RT-RICs and adaptive local updates. Our\nnumerical results demonstrate that SplitMe remarkably outperforms FL frameworks\nlike SFL, FedAvg and O-RANFed regarding costs and convergence.",

    "abstract": "Computer vision has become a popular tool in intelligent transportation\nsystems (ITS), enabling various applications through roadside traffic cameras\nthat capture video and transmit it in real time to computing devices within the\nsame network. The efficiency of this video transmission largely depends on the\navailable bandwidth of the communication system. However, limited bandwidth can\nlead to communication bottlenecks, hindering the real-time performance of ITS\napplications. To mitigate this issue, lossy video compression techniques can be\nused to reduce bandwidth requirements, at the cost of degrading video quality.\nThis degradation can negatively impact the accuracy of applications that rely\non real-time vehicle detection. Additionally, vehicle detection accuracy is\ninfluenced by environmental factors such as weather and lighting conditions,\nsuggesting that compression levels should be dynamically adjusted in response\nto these variations. In this work, we utilize a framework called\nPrecision-Aware Video Compression (PAVC), where a roadside video camera\ncaptures footage of vehicles on roadways, compresses videos, and then transmits\nthem to a processing unit, running a vehicle detection algorithm for\nsafety-critical applications, such as real-time collision risk assessment. The\nsystem dynamically adjusts the video compression level based on current weather\nand lighting conditions to maintain vehicle detection accuracy while minimizing\nbandwidth usage. Our results demonstrate that PAVC improves vehicle detection\naccuracy by up to 13% and reduces communication bandwidth requirements by up to\n8.23x in areas with moderate bandwidth availability. Moreover, in locations\nwith severely limited bandwidth, PAVC reduces bandwidth requirements by up to\n72x while preserving vehicle detection performance.",

    "abstract": "Standard transformer-based language models, while powerful for general text,\noften struggle with the fine-grained syntax and entity relationships in complex\ntechnical, engineering documents. To address this, we propose the Contextual\nGraph Transformer (CGT), a hybrid neural architecture that combines Graph\nNeural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers for domain-specific question answering.\nCGT constructs a dynamic graph over input tokens using sequential, skip-gram,\nand semantic similarity edges, which is processed by GATv2Conv layers for local\nstructure learning. These enriched embeddings are then passed to a Transformer\nencoder to capture global dependencies. Unlike generic large models, technical\ndomains often require specialized language models with stronger\ncontextualization and structure awareness. CGT offers a parameter-efficient\nsolution for such use cases. Integrated into a Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n(RAG) pipeline, CGT outperforms baselines like GPT-2 and BERT, achieving 24.7%\nhigher accuracy than GPT-2 with 62.4% fewer parameters. This gain stems from\nCGTs ability to jointly model structural token interactions and long-range\nsemantic coherence. The model is trained from scratch using a two-phase\napproach: pretraining on general text followed by fine-tuning on\ndomain-specific manuals.

To bridge the gap between idealized conditions and the\ncomplexities of real-world environments, we propose a unified failure-aware\ncoordination framework designed to enable resilient and adaptive multi-robot\ntarget tracking under both temporary and permanent failure conditions. Our\napproach systematically distinguishes between two classes of failures: (1)\nprobabilistic and temporary disruptions, where robots recover from intermittent\nsensing or communication losses by dynamically adapting paths and avoiding\ninferred danger zones, and (2) permanent failures, where robots lose sensing or\ncommunication capabilities irreversibly, requiring sustained, decentralized\nbehavioral adaptation. To handle these scenarios, the robot team is partitioned\ninto subgroups. Robots that remain connected form a communication group and\ncollaboratively plan using partially centralized nonlinear optimization. Robots\nexperiencing permanent disconnection or failure continue to operate\nindependently through decentralized or individual optimization, allowing them\nto contribute to the task within their local context. We extensively evaluate\nour method across a range of benchmark variations and conduct a comprehensive\nassessment under diverse real-world failure scenarios.

To\naddress this gap, virtual staining from H&E to IHC has emerged as a promising\nalternative, yet faces two core challenges: (1) Lack of fair evaluation of\nsynthetic images against misaligned IHC ground truths, and (2) preserving\nstructural integrity and biological variability during translation.

Incidents were sourced from the Center for Strategic & International\nStudies (CSIS) List of Significant Cyber Incidents, the University of Maryland\nCyber Events Database (UMCED), the European Repository of Cyber Incidents\n(EuRepoC), the Maritime Cyber Attack Database (MCAD), and the U.S. DOT\nTransportation Cybersecurity and Resiliency (TraCR) Examples of Cyber Attacks\nin Transportation (2018 to 2022). These were classified by a fine tuned LLM\ninto five transportation modes: aviation, maritime, rail, road, and multimodal,\nforming a transportation specific cyber incident database. Another key\ncontribution of this work is the development of a Retrieval Augmented\nGeneration question answering system, designed to enhance accessibility and\npractical use by enabling users to query the curated database for specific\ndetails on transportation related cyber incidents. By leveraging LLMs for both\ndata extraction and user interaction, this study contributes a novel,\naccessible tool for improving cybersecurity awareness in the transportation\nsector.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel methodology for modelling precipitation patterns\nin a specific geographical region using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). Departing\nfrom conventional HMMs, where the hidden state process is assumed to be\nMarkovian, we introduce non-Markovian behaviour by incorporating phase-type\ndistributions to model state durations. The primary objective is to capture the\nalternating sequences of dry and wet periods that characterize the local\nclimate, providing deeper insight into its temporal structure. Building on this\nfoundation, we extend the model to represent reservoir inflow patterns, which\nare then used to explain the observed water storage levels via a Moran model.\nThe dataset includes historical rainfall and inflow records, where the latter\nis influenced by latent conditions governed by the hidden states. Direct\nmodelling based solely on observed rainfall is insufficient due to the\ncomplexity of the system, hence the use of HMMs to infer these unobserved\ndynamics. This approach facilitates more accurate characterization of the\nunderlying climatic processes and enables forecasting of future inflows based\non historical data, supporting improved water resource management in the\nregion.",

While detection methods have advanced, attributing\naudio deepfakes to their source models remains an underexplored yet crucial\nchallenge. In this paper we introduce LAVA (Layered Architecture for Voice\nAttribution), a hierarchical framework for audio deepfake detection and model\nrecognition that leverages attention-enhanced latent representations extracted\nby a convolutional autoencoder trained solely on fake audio. Two specialized\nclassifiers operate on these features: Audio Deepfake Attribution (ADA), which\nidentifies the generation technology, and Audio Deepfake Model Recognition\n(ADMR), which recognize the specific generative model instance. To improve\nrobustness under open-set conditions, we incorporate confidence-based rejection\nthresholds. Experiments on ASVspoof2021, FakeOrReal, and CodecFake show strong\nperformance: the ADA classifier achieves F1-scores over 95% across all\ndatasets, and the ADMR module reaches 96.31% macro F1 across six classes.\nAdditional tests on unseen attacks from ASVpoof2019 LA and error propagation\nanalysis confirm LAVA's robustness and reliability. The framework advances the\nfield by introducing a supervised approach to deepfake attribution and model\nrecognition under open-set conditions, validated on public benchmarks and\naccompanied by publicly released models and code.

Running large MoE models on SuperPod-scale hardware\nbrings new challenges.

We implement this design in two forms: disaggregated prefill-decode and\ndisaggregated MoE-attention. This fully disaggregated setup enables independent\nscaling of compute and memory without sacrificing performance. To support this\narchitecture, we propose XCCL, a communication library that leverages\nCloudMatrix384's global shared memory to implement efficient point-to-point and\nall-to-all primitives.

However, this\ntask remains challenging due to the complex interplay of factors such as\nsemantic content, visual quality, audio characteristics, and user background.\nPrior studies have leveraged various types of features from different\nmodalities, such as visual quality, semantic content, background sound, etc.,\nbut often struggle to effectively model their cross-feature and cross-modality\ninteractions. In this work, we empirically investigate the potential of large\nmultimodal models (LMMs) for video engagement prediction. We adopt two\nrepresentative LMMs: VideoLLaMA2, which integrates audio, visual, and language\nmodalities, and Qwen2.5-VL, which models only visual and language modalities.\nSpecifically, VideoLLaMA2 jointly processes key video frames, text-based\nmetadata, and background sound, while Qwen2.5-VL utilizes only key video frames\nand text-based metadata. Trained on the SnapUGC dataset, both models\ndemonstrate competitive performance against state-of-the-art baselines,\nshowcasing the effectiveness of LMMs in engagement prediction.

However, the scarcity of high-quality panoramic training\ndata-caused by inherent kinematic constraints and complex sensor calibration\nchallenges-fundamentally limits the development of robust perception systems\ntailored to these embodied platforms. To address this issue, we propose\nQuaDreamer-the first panoramic data generation engine specifically designed for\nquadruped robots. QuaDreamer focuses on mimicking the motion paradigm of\nquadruped robots to generate highly controllable, realistic panoramic videos,\nproviding a data source for downstream tasks. Specifically, to effectively\ncapture the unique vertical vibration characteristics exhibited during\nquadruped locomotion, we introduce Vertical Jitter Encoding (VJE). VJE extracts\ncontrollable vertical signals through frequency-domain feature filtering and\nprovides high-quality prompts. To facilitate high-quality panoramic video\ngeneration under jitter signal control, we propose a Scene-Object Controller\n(SOC) that effectively manages object motion and boosts background jitter\ncontrol through the attention mechanism. To address panoramic distortions in\nwide-FoV video generation, we propose the Panoramic Enhancer (PE)-a dual-stream\narchitecture that synergizes frequency-texture refinement for local detail\nenhancement with spatial-structure correction for global geometric consistency.\nWe further demonstrate that the generated video sequences can serve as training\ndata for the quadruped robot's panoramic visual perception model, enhancing the\nperformance of multi-object tracking in 360-degree scenes.

To\naddress this, we propose PI, a novel framework for Test-time Prompt\nIntervention. PI provides an interface to dynamically guide and regulate\nreasoning paths during inference through timely (When module) and proper (How\nmodule) interventions and post-intervention sampling (Which module). This\nallows human problem-solving expertise and cognitive science principles to be\nseamlessly integrated into LLMs' reasoning processes, enhancing controllability\nand interpretability. Extensive experiments across multiple models and datasets\ndemonstrate that PI significantly shortens CoTs while reducing hallucination,\nyielding more concise and reliable reasoning.",

    "abstract": "The study of biomolecular folding has been greatly advanced by\nsingle-molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS), which enables the observation of the\ndynamics of individual molecules. However, extracting quantitative models of\nfundamental properties such as folding landscapes from SNFS data is very\nchallenging due to instrumental noise, linker artifacts, and the inherent\nstochasticity of the process, often requiring extensive datasets and complex\ncalibration experiments. Here, we introduce a framework based on\nsimulation-based inference (SBI) that overcomes these limitations by\nintegrating physics-based modeling with deep learning. We apply this framework\nto analyze constant-force measurements of a DNA hairpin. From a single, short\nexperimental trajectory of only two seconds, we successfully reconstruct the\nhairpin's free energy landscape and folding dynamics, obtaining results that\nare in close agreement with established deconvolution methods that require\napproximately 100 times more data. Furthermore, the Bayesian nature of this\napproach robustly quantifies uncertainties for inferred parameter values,\nincluding the free-energy profile, diffusion coefficients, and linker\nstiffness, without needing independent measurements of instrumental properties.\nThe inferred model is predictive, generating simulated trajectories that\nquantitatively reproduce the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of the\nexperimental data. This work establishes SBI as a highly efficient and powerful\ntool for analyzing single-molecule experiments. The ability to derive\nstatistically robust models from minimal datasets is crucial for investigating\ncomplex biomolecular systems where extensive data collection is impractical or\nimpossible. Consequently, our SBI framework enables the rigorous quantitative\nanalysis of previously intractable biomolecular systems, paving the way for\nnovel applications of SMFS.",

The crux of polarization\nis separation along a unidimensional ideological axis, but how it emerges is\nyet partially understood. We refine a powerful class of models from statistical\nphysics, restricted Boltzmann machines, to unify two classes of individual\nvoter preference and voter interaction models. Our model is minimally\nparameterized, fits voting data well, and has parameters that directly give\nvote probabilities. To obtain this, we account for multi-dimensional voter\npreferences and the context in which such preferences are expressed to\ndisentangle individual from collective contributions; for example, legislative\nbills can negotiate multiple issues, whose appeal adds up or competes for\nindividual votes, but whose inclusion involves coordination. With U.S.~Senate\nvoting, we find voters are poorly explained by a unidimensional axis. Senators\nhave multi-dimensional preferences, and, as one consequence, non-polarized\ncoalitions coexist with polarized ones. Polarization arises from both increased\nparty-line voting by individuals and fewer bills that elicit bipartisan\ncoalitions. Both factors contribute over time, but the latter substantially\nmore.

    "abstract": "Many previous studies have proposed extracting image labels from clinical\nnotes to create large-scale medical image datasets at a low cost. However,\nthese approaches inherently suffer from label noise due to uncertainty from the\nclinical experts. When radiologists and physicians analyze medical images to\nmake diagnoses, they often include uncertainty-aware notes such as ``maybe'' or\n``not excluded''. Unfortunately, current text-mining methods overlook these\nnuances, resulting in the creation of noisy labels. Existing methods for\nhandling noisy labels in medical image analysis, which typically address the\nproblem through post-processing techniques, have largely ignored the important\nissue of expert-driven uncertainty contributing to label noise. To better\nincorporate the expert-written uncertainty in clinical notes into medical image\nanalysis and address the label noise issue, we first examine the impact of\nclinical expert uncertainty on label noise. We then propose a clinical expert\nuncertainty-aware benchmark, along with a label smoothing method, which\nsignificantly improves performance compared to current state-of-the-art\napproaches.",

Despite its strengths, 3DGS often\nproduces floating artifacts, which are erroneous structures detached from the\nactual geometry and significantly degrade visual fidelity. The underlying\nmechanisms causing these artifacts, particularly in low-quality initialization\nscenarios, have not been fully explored. In this paper, we investigate the\norigins of floating artifacts from a frequency-domain perspective and identify\nunder-optimized Gaussians as the primary source. Based on our analysis, we\npropose \\textit{Eliminating-Floating-Artifacts} Gaussian Splatting (EFA-GS),\nwhich selectively expands under-optimized Gaussians to prioritize accurate\nlow-frequency learning. Additionally, we introduce complementary depth-based\nand scale-based strategies to dynamically refine Gaussian expansion,\neffectively mitigating detail erosion. Extensive experiments on both synthetic\nand real-world datasets demonstrate that EFA-GS substantially reduces floating\nartifacts while preserving high-frequency details, achieving an improvement of\n1.68 dB in PSNR over baseline method on our RWLQ dataset.

Reducing the system symmetry greatly affects three-wave\nscattering, which, in this case, goes beyond the simple momentum conservation\nlaw. In this study, we examine three-magnon scattering at the edge of a thin\nferromagnetic film, when a bulk spin wave interacts with an edge-localized\npropagating spin-wave upon the reflection. This creates new bulk spin waves at\nmixed frequencies by means of three-magnon confluence or stimulated splitting\nprocesses. Using our developed analytical theory, which has been confirmed by\nfull micromagnetic simulations, we demonstrate that the amplitude of the wave\ngenerated in the stimulated splitting process is several times larger than that\ngenerated in the confluence process, primarily due to the lower group velocity.\nFurthermore, intensity of inelastically scattered waves exhibit a pronounced\ndependence on the incidence angle and frequency of the edge spin wave that goes\nbeyond existing qualitative models. We show that the observed behaviors can\nonly be explained by taking into account, that the scattered waves are created\nby several elementary three-magnon processes involving the incident and\nreflected waves.

    "abstract": "The demand for data privacy has led to the development of frameworks like\nFederated Graph Learning (FGL), which facilitate decentralized model training.\nHowever, a significant operational challenge in such systems is adhering to the\nright to be forgotten. This principle necessitates robust mechanisms for two\ndistinct types of data removal: the selective erasure of specific entities and\ntheir associated knowledge from local subgraphs and the wholesale removal of a\nuser's entire dataset and influence. Existing methods often struggle to fully\naddress both unlearning requirements, frequently resulting in incomplete data\nremoval or the persistence of residual knowledge within the system. This work\nintroduces a unified framework, conceived to provide a comprehensive solution\nto these challenges. The proposed framework employs a bifurcated strategy\ntailored to the specific unlearning request. For fine-grained Meta Unlearning,\nit uses prototype gradients to direct the initial local forgetting process,\nwhich is then refined by generating adversarial graphs to eliminate any\nremaining data traces among affected clients. In the case of complete client\nunlearning, the framework utilizes adversarial graph generation exclusively to\npurge the departed client's contributions from the remaining network. Extensive\nexperiments on multiple benchmark datasets validate the proposed approach. The\nframework achieves substantial improvements in model prediction accuracy across\nboth client and meta-unlearning scenarios when compared to existing methods.\nFurthermore, additional studies confirm its utility as a plug-in module, where\nit materially enhances the predictive capabilities and unlearning effectiveness\nof other established methods.",

We sample point clouds from the surfaces\nof the generated liver shapes, extract handcrafted geometric features, and\ntrain a group of supervised ML and PointNet models to classify liver shapes as\ngood or bad. These trained models are then used as proxy discriminators to\nassess the quality of synthetic liver shapes produced by generative models.\n  Our results show that ML-based shape classifiers provide not only\ninterpretable feedback but also complementary insights compared to expert\nevaluation.

    "abstract": "Reconstructing dynamic videos from fMRI is important for understanding visual\ncognition and enabling vivid brain-computer interfaces. However, current\nmethods are critically limited to single-shot clips, failing to address the\nmulti-shot nature of real-world experiences. Multi-shot reconstruction faces\nfundamental challenges: fMRI signal mixing across shots, the temporal\nresolution mismatch between fMRI and video obscuring rapid scene changes, and\nthe lack of dedicated multi-shot fMRI-video datasets. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose a novel divide-and-decode framework for multi-shot fMRI\nvideo reconstruction. Our core innovations are: (1) A shot boundary predictor\nmodule explicitly decomposing mixed fMRI signals into shot-specific segments.\n(2) Generative keyframe captioning using LLMs, which decodes robust textual\ndescriptions from each segment, overcoming temporal blur by leveraging\nhigh-level semantics. (3) Novel large-scale data synthesis (20k samples) from\nexisting datasets. Experimental results demonstrate our framework outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods in multi-shot reconstruction fidelity. Ablation\nstudies confirm the critical role of fMRI decomposition and semantic\ncaptioning, with decomposition significantly improving decoded caption CLIP\nsimilarity by 71.8%. This work establishes a new paradigm for multi-shot fMRI\nreconstruction, enabling accurate recovery of complex visual narratives through\nexplicit decomposition and semantic prompting.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in image anomaly detection have extended unsupervised\nlearning-based models from single-class settings to multi-class frameworks,\naiming to improve efficiency in training time and model storage. When a single\nmodel is trained to handle multiple classes, it often underperforms compared to\nclass-specific models in terms of per-class detection accuracy. Accordingly,\nprevious studies have primarily focused on narrowing this performance gap.\nHowever, the way class information is used, or not used, remains a relatively\nunderstudied factor that could influence how detection thresholds are defined\nin multi-class image anomaly detection. These thresholds, whether\nclass-specific or class-agnostic, significantly affect detection outcomes. In\nthis study, we identify and formalize the requirements that a multi-class image\nanomaly detection model must satisfy under different conditions, depending on\nwhether class labels are available during training and evaluation. We then\nre-examine existing methods under these criteria. To meet these challenges, we\npropose Hierarchical Coreset (HierCore), a novel framework designed to satisfy\nall defined requirements. HierCore operates effectively even without class\nlabels, leveraging a hierarchical memory bank to estimate class-wise decision\ncriteria for anomaly detection. We empirically validate the applicability and\nrobustness of existing methods and HierCore under four distinct scenarios,\ndetermined by the presence or absence of class labels in the training and\nevaluation phases.

    "abstract": "A class of gravity theories respecting spatial covariance and in the presence\nof non-dynamical auxiliary scalar fields with only spatial derivatives is\ninvestigated. Generally, without higher temporal derivatives in the metric\nsector, there are 3 degrees of freedom (DOFs) propagating due to the breaking\nof general covariance. Through a Hamiltonian constraint analysis, we examine\nthe conditions to eliminate the scalar DOF such that only 2 DOFs, which\ncorrespond the tensorial gravitational waves in a homogeneous and isotropic\nbackground, are propagating. We find that two conditions are needed, each of\nwhich can eliminate half degree of freedom. The second condition can be further\nclassified into two cases according to its effect on the Dirac matrix. We also\napply the formal conditions to a polynomial-type Lagrangian as a concrete\nexample, in which all the monomials are spatially covariant scalars containing\ntwo derivatives. Our results are consistent with the previous analysis based on\nthe perturbative method.",

This limitation is critical in domains with dense\nhomogeneous objects (e.g., biomedical nuclei segmentation), where sparse visual\nprompts typically yield incomplete results, rendering dense annotations\nimpractical due to prohibitive cost. To bridge this gap, we introduce SAMPO\n(Segment Anything Model with Preference Optimization), a novel framework that\nteaches visual foundation models to infer high-level categorical intent from\nsparse visual interactions. Unlike conventional pixel-level fine-tuning, SAMPO\noptimizes models to implicitly capture target-class characteristics through\npreference optimization. This approach, which operates without dependency on\nlanguage models, enables robust multi-object segmentation even under sparse\nprompting and demonstrates superior data efficiency during fine-tuning.\nValidated on three medical segmentation tasks, SAMPO achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance: on challenging tasks like PanNuke-T2, our method, when fine-tuned\nwith only 10% of the training data, significantly outperforms all existing\nmethods trained on the full 100% dataset, achieving an improvement of over 9\npercentage points compared to the best baseline.

    "abstract": "Understanding the relationship between the time-symmetric nature of physical\nlaws and the apparent directionality of causality is a central question in\nquantum foundations. The standard operational formulation, widely used in\nquantum information, imposes a definite, acyclic causal order on agents'\noperations, contrasting with time-symmetric dynamics. Two prominent extensions\nof this framework are the multi-time state (MTS) formalism, which incorporates\ntime symmetry via arbitrary pre- and post-selection, and the post-selected\nclosed timelike curve (P-CTC) framework, which enables cyclic causal influences\nthrough post-selection on maximally entangled states. While prior work has\nnoted structural connections between MTS and P-CTCs, it remained unclear\nwhether an operational equivalence exists, or whether constructive mappings can\nbe established between their most general objects. In this work, we address\nthis gap by extending the P-CTC framework to define time-labelled P-CTC\nassisted combs, a more general class of P-CTC-assisted objects that support\nopen processing slots and explicit temporal structure. We prove that for every\n(possibly mixed) MTS, there exists an operationally equivalent time-labelled\nP-CTC-assisted comb, and vice versa. The equivalence is shown via explicit\nmappings, while discussing the number and dimensionality of the P-CTCs\ninvolved. We also explore a resource-theoretic view of MTS, defining a partial\norder under free transformations that do not use P-CTCs. We conclude by\ndiscussing future directions informed by the operational equivalence between\ntime symmetry and cyclic causality established here.",

This\nis because users' responses to recommended content follow the recency effect\nand the cyclicality of memory. By exploring this, this paper introduces the\nforgetting curve and proposes Spatio-Temporal periodic Interest Modeling (STIM)\nwith long sequences for local-life service recommendation. STIM integrates\nthree key components: a dynamic masking module based on the forgetting curve,\nwhich is used to extract both recent spatiotemporal features and periodic\nspatiotemporal features; a query-based mixture of experts (MoE) approach that\ncan adaptively activate expert networks under different dynamic masks, enabling\nthe collaborative modeling of time, location, and items; and a hierarchical\nmulti-interest network unit, which captures multi-interest representations by\nmodeling the hierarchical interactions between the shallow and deep semantics\nof users' recent behaviors. By introducing the STIM method, we conducted online\nA/B tests and achieved a 1.54\\% improvement in gross transaction volume (GTV).\nIn addition, extended offline experiments also showed improvements. STIM has\nbeen deployed in a large-scale local-life service recommendation system,\nserving hundreds of millions of daily active users in core application\nscenarios.",

On the other hand, crossbars offer low latency, but\ntheir routing complexity grows quadratically with the number of I/Os, requiring\nlarge physical routing resources and limiting area-efficient scalability. This\ntwo-sided interconnect bottleneck hinders the scale-up of many-core,\nlow-latency, tightly coupled shared-memory clusters, pushing designers toward\ninstantiating many smaller and loosely coupled clusters, at the cost of\nhardware and software overheads. We present TeraNoC, an open-source, hybrid\nmesh-crossbar on-chip interconnect that offers both scalability and low\nlatency, while maintaining very low routing overhead. The topology, built on\n32bit word-width multi-channel 2D-meshes and crossbars, enables the\narea-efficient scale-up of shared-memory clusters. A router remapper is\ndesigned to balance traffic load across interconnect channels.

Predicting Overall Survival (OS) is critical\nfor personalizing treatment strategies and aligning clinical decisions with\npatient outcomes. In this study, we propose a novel Artificial Intelligence\n(AI) approach for OS prediction using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images,\nexploiting Vision Transformers (ViTs) to extract hidden features directly from\nMRI images, eliminating the need of tumor segmentation. Unlike traditional\napproaches, our method simplifies the workflow and reduces computational\nresource requirements.\n  The proposed model was evaluated on the BRATS dataset, reaching an accuracy\nof 62.5% on the test set, comparable to the top-performing methods.\nAdditionally, it demonstrated balanced performance across precision, recall,\nand F1 score, overcoming the best model in these metrics. The dataset size\nlimits the generalization of the ViT which typically requires larger datasets\ncompared to convolutional neural networks. This limitation in generalization is\nobserved across all the cited studies. This work highlights the applicability\nof ViTs for downsampled medical imaging tasks and establishes a foundation for\nOS prediction models that are computationally efficient and do not rely on\nsegmentation.",

It has been shown that the retina\ncan extrapolate the position of a moving object, thereby compensating sensory\ntransmission delays and enabling signal processing in real-time. Amacrine\ncells, the inhibitory interneurons of the retina, play essential roles in such\ncomputations although their precise function remain unclear. Here, we\ncomputationally explore the effect of two different inhibitory connectivity\nmotifs on the retina's response to moving objects: feed-forward and recurrent\nfeed-back inhibition. We show that both can account for motion anticipation\nwith two different mechanisms. Feed-forward inhibition truncates motion\nresponses and shifts peak responses forward via subtractive inhibition, whereas\nrecurrent feedback coupling evokes, via divisive inhibition, excitatory and\ninhibitory waves with different phases that add up and shift the response peak.\nA key difference between the two mechanisms is how the peak response scales\nwith the speed of a moving object. Motion prediction with feedforward circuits\nmonotonically decreases with increasing speeds, while recurrent feedback\ncoupling induces tuning curves that exhibit a preferred speed for which motion\nprediction is maximal.",

Currently, a key challenge facing CKGE is that the\nmodel is prone to \"catastrophic forgetting\", resulting in the loss of\npreviously learned knowledge. In order to effectively alleviate this problem,\nwe propose a new CKGE model BAKE. First, we note that the Bayesian posterior\nupdate principle provides a natural continual learning strategy that is\ninsensitive to data order and can theoretically effectively resist the\nforgetting of previous knowledge during data evolution. Different from the\nexisting CKGE method, BAKE regards each batch of new data as a Bayesian update\nof the model prior. Under this framework, as long as the posterior distribution\nof the model is maintained, the model can better preserve the knowledge of\nearly snapshots even after evolving through multiple time snapshots. Secondly,\nwe propose a continual clustering method for CKGE, which further directly\ncombats knowledge forgetting by constraining the evolution difference (or\nchange amplitude) between new and old knowledge between different snapshots. We\nconduct extensive experiments on BAKE on multiple datasets, and the results\nshow that BAKE significantly outperforms existing baseline models.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we present a construction of a cluster state lattice\nHamiltonian that exhibits the symmetry of the Ising fusion algebra. This\nconstruction is formulated within the framework of weak Hopf symmetry\ntopological field theory (SymTFT), where we assign smooth and rough boundaries\nto the weak Hopf quantum double model, thereby extending the conventional\ncluster state model. Central to our construction is the weak Hopf Ising\nboundary tube algebra $\\mathcal{T}_{\\mathsf{Ising}}$, whose representation\ncategory is equivalent to the Ising fusion category $\\mathsf{Ising}$. We take\nthis algebra as the input data for the weak Hopf quantum double model. The\nresulting model exhibits Ising fusion symmetry on both open and closed\n$1\\text{d}$ manifolds. On open manifolds, the symmetry is governed by\n$\\mathcal{T}_{\\mathsf{Ising}} \\otimes \\mathcal{T}_{\\mathsf{Ising}}^{\\vee}$; on\nclosed manifolds, it reduces to\n$\\operatorname{Cocom}(\\mathcal{T}_{\\mathsf{Ising}}) \\otimes\n\\operatorname{Cocom}(\\mathcal{T}_{\\mathsf{Ising}}^{\\vee})$. Since the Ising\nfusion algebra embeds into\n$\\operatorname{Cocom}(\\mathcal{T}_{\\mathsf{Ising}}^{\\vee})$, the model\nfaithfully realizes the symmetry of the Ising fusion category.",

In situations where the roles of leader(s) and followers can be\ninterchanged, the designated role can have considerable advantages, for\nexample, in first-mover advantage settings. Then the question arises: Who\nshould be the leader and when? A bias in the leader selection process can lead\nto unfair outcomes. This problem is aggravated if the agents are\nself-interested and care only about their goals and rewards. We formally define\nthis leader selection problem and show its relation to fairness in agents'\nreturns. Furthermore, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework\nthat maximizes fairness by integrating mediators.

    "abstract": "Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable multimodal\ncomprehension and reasoning capabilities, but they still suffer from severe\nobject hallucination. Previous studies primarily attribute the flaw to\nlinguistic prior caused by the scale mismatch between visual encoders and large\nlanguage models (LLMs) in LVLMs. Specifically, as current LVLMs are built upon\nLLMs, they tend to over-rely on textual prompts and internal knowledge of LLMs,\ngenerating descriptions inconsistent with visual cues. However, through an\nin-depth investigation of the hallucinated mechanisms, we empirically reveal a\npreviously overlooked phenomenon: LVLMs may ignore not only visual information\nbut also textual modality during hallucination, a behavior termed as modality\nbias, which indicates that LVLMs struggle to simultaneously attend to both\nvisual and textual modalities, leading to fragmented understanding of\nuser-provided instructions. Based on this observation, we propose a simple yet\neffective training-free method to mitigate object hallucination. Concretely, we\nintervene and adjust the attention weights of textual and visual tokens,\nbalancing cross-modal compatibility for better alignment with user intentions.\nFurthermore, we adopt a contrastive decoding strategy to reduce the LVLM's\noverreliance on its parametric knowledge, synergistically enhancing our\nattention manipulation. Extensive experiments confirm the widespread presence\nof modality bias in LVLMs. Notably, our method effectively mitigates\nhallucination across multiple open-source LVLMs and benchmarks, highlighting\nits generalizability and efficacy.",

However, in low\nviscosity disks, under specific condition on the gas cooling time, massive\nplanets can also open secondary gaps, separated by density bumps, inward of the\nmain gap. The majority of studies have been done in two dimensional equatorial\nsimulations with prescribed disk cooling. Recent results have shown that\nincluding the treatment of radiation transport is key to determine the\nformation of secondary gaps. We extend previous studies to three dimensional\ndisks including radiative effects and we also consider non ideal MHD effects,\nin disks with prescribed cooling time.\n  We perform three dimensional hydrodynamical numerical simulations with self\nconsistent treatment of radiative effects and including the magnetic field with\nnon ideal Ohmic and Ambipolar effects. We show that in a disk with low bulk\nviscosity and consistent treatment of radiative effects, planetary masses close\nto the pebble isolation mass as well as a Jupiter massive planet open multiple\ngaps. In the presence of non ideal MHD effects multiple gaps and rings are also\nformed by a Jupiter massive planet.In conclusion the formation of multiple gaps\nand rings inside the planetary orbit is crucial to preserve dust reservoirs.\nSuch reservoirs are pushed towards the inner part of the disk during Jupiter\nrunaway growth and are persistent after Jupiter's growth. Multiple dust\nreservoirs could therefore be present in the inner Solar System since the\nformation of Jupiter's solid core if the disk had low-viscosity.",

    "abstract": "Leaf Wetness Duration (LWD), the time that water remains on leaf surfaces, is\ncrucial in the development of plant diseases. Existing LWD detection lacks\nstandardized measurement techniques, and variations across different plant\ncharacteristics limit its effectiveness. Prior research proposes diverse\napproaches, but they fail to measure real natural leaves directly and lack\nresilience in various environmental conditions. This reduces the precision and\nrobustness, revealing a notable practical application and effectiveness gap in\nreal-world agricultural settings. This paper presents Hydra, an innovative\napproach that integrates millimeter-wave (mm-Wave) radar with camera technology\nto detect leaf wetness by determining if there is water on the leaf. We can\nmeasure the time to determine the LWD based on this detection. Firstly, we\ndesign a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to selectively fuse multiple\nmm-Wave depth images with an RGB image to generate multiple feature images.\nThen, we develop a transformer-based encoder to capture the inherent connection\namong the multiple feature images to generate a feature map, which is further\nfed to a classifier for detection. Moreover, we augment the dataset during\ntraining to generalize our model. Implemented using a frequency-modulated\ncontinuous-wave (FMCW) radar within the 76 to 81 GHz band, Hydra's performance\nis meticulously evaluated on plants, demonstrating the potential to classify\nleaf wetness with up to 96% accuracy across varying scenarios. Deploying Hydra\nin the farm, including rainy, dawn, or poorly light nights, it still achieves\nan accuracy rate of around 90%.",

Experiments on X-3D and\nreal-world datasets validate the effectiveness of GR-Gaussian, achieving PSNR\nimprovements of 0.67 dB and 0.92 dB, and SSIM gains of 0.011 and 0.021.

    "abstract": "Robots are increasingly becoming part of our daily lives, interacting with\nboth the environment and humans to perform their tasks. The software of such\nrobots often undergoes upgrades, for example, to add new functionalities, fix\nbugs, or delete obsolete functionalities. As a result, regression testing of\nrobot software becomes necessary. However, determining the expected correct\nbehavior of robots (i.e., a test oracle) is challenging due to the potentially\nunknown environments in which the robots must operate. To address this\nchallenge, machine learning (ML)-based test oracles present a viable solution.\nThis paper reports on the development of a test oracle to support regression\ntesting of autonomous mobile robots built by PAL Robotics (Spain), using\nquantum machine learning (QML), which enables faster training and the\nconstruction of more precise test oracles. Specifically, we propose a hybrid\nframework, QuReBot, that combines both quantum reservoir computing (QRC) and a\nsimple neural network, inspired by residual connection, to predict the expected\nbehavior of a robot. Results show that QRC alone fails to converge in our case,\nyielding high prediction error. In contrast, QuReBot converges and achieves 15%\nreduction of prediction error compared to the classical neural network\nbaseline. Finally, we further examine QuReBot under different configurations\nand offer practical guidance on optimal settings to support future robot\nsoftware testing.",

By adopting\na constant redshift function and introducing a direct coupling between the\nRicci scalar and the Yang-Mills field strength, we investigate the role of the\nnon-minimal coupling constant $\\xi$ and the magnetic charge $Q$ in shaping the\nwormhole geometry. Our analysis shows that for small values of $\\xi$, the\nflare-out and throat conditions can be satisfied, allowing physically viable\ntraversable wormholes without requiring externally introduced exotic matter.\nThe Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) mass is evaluated, revealing that for $\\xi <\n0.01$ it grows monotonically with charge, whereas for $\\xi \\gtrsim 0.01$ it\ndecreases with increasing charge, signaling a reduction in the total\nmass-energy of the system. An examination of the energy conditions indicates\nlocalized violations of the null and weak energy conditions at the throat,\nwhile the strong energy condition remains satisfied. Finally, the study of\ngravitational lensing confirms that the deflection angle of light is\nconsistently positive, reflecting the overall attractive nature of the wormhole\ngravitational field.

Traditional SBI methods assume that the model is correct, but, as\nalways, this can lead to invalid inference when the model is misspecified.

    "abstract": "Stablecoins have become a foundational component of the digital asset\necosystem, with their market capitalization exceeding 230 billion USD as of May\n2025. As fiat-referenced and programmable assets, stablecoins provide\nlow-latency, globally interoperable infrastructure for payments, decentralized\nfinance, DeFi, and tokenized commerce. Their accelerated adoption has prompted\nextensive regulatory engagement, exemplified by the European Union's Markets in\nCrypto-assets Regulation, MiCA, the US Guiding and Establishing National\nInnovation for US Stablecoins Act, GENIUS Act, and Hong Kong's Stablecoins\nBill. Despite this momentum, academic research remains fragmented across\neconomics, law, and computer science, lacking a unified framework for design,\nevaluation, and application. This study addresses that gap through a\nmulti-method research design. First, it synthesizes cross-disciplinary\nliterature to construct a taxonomy of stablecoin systems based on custodial\nstructure, stabilization mechanism, and governance. Second, it develops a\nperformance evaluation framework tailored to diverse stakeholder needs,\nsupported by an open-source benchmarking pipeline to ensure transparency and\nreproducibility. Third, a case study on Real World Asset tokenization\nillustrates how stablecoins operate as programmable monetary infrastructure in\ncross-border digital systems. By integrating conceptual theory with empirical\ntools, the paper contributes: a unified taxonomy for stablecoin design; a\nstakeholder-oriented performance evaluation framework; an empirical case\nlinking stablecoins to sectoral transformation; and reproducible methods and\ndatasets to inform future research.

We have therefore used a recently developed and\nvalidated neural network (NN) model predicting surface nitrate concentrations\nfrom a range of observable variables and implemented its assimilation within a\nresearch and development version of the Met Office's NWES operational\nforecasting system. As a result of nitrate assimilation the phytoplankton\nforecast skill improves by up to 30%.

    "abstract": "Responsive hydrogels can sense environmental stimuli and respond as actuators\nby expelling water and changing shape. In this article, we develop theory to\ndemonstrate that groups of responsive hydrogels can also communicate with each\nother, by utilising the effect of elastic deformation on chemical reaction\ndynamics. Specifically, we consider a system of two spatially-separated\nchemically responsive hydrogels suspended in a solution in which a\nBelousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ)-type reaction occurs. Solving for the gel dynamics\nwith the transport of solvent through the poroelastic network and the chemical\nkinetics, we show how the periodic swelling-deswelling oscillations of each gel\ncan become coupled, and how this coupling can be exploited to send signals from\none gel to the other via mechanical manipulation of the sender that affect the\nlocal (and thus global) frequency of oscillation.",

    "abstract": "We revisit the J1-J2 frustrated Heisenberg spin-1/2 chain with dimerization\n({\\delta}) or modulation in the nearest-neighbor couplings to investigate its\nthermalization behavior. While the dimerization tends to induce localization,\nthe next-nearest-neighbor interaction J2 generally favors thermalization,\nmaking the assessment of the model's compliance with the Eigenstate\nThermalization Hypothesis (ETH) particularly subtle. The challenge is further\ncompounded by the model's SU(2) symmetry; the study of ETH compliance is\nnecessarily done for each symmetry sector but separating different sectors of\nthis symmetry is known to be a computationally demanding task. The current\nstudy is driven by two main motivations: first, to explore whether the\nwell-known ground-state phases of the model have any bearing on its\nthermalization properties; and second, to understand how the interplay between\ntwo competing factors, namely, the non-uniformity (via {\\delta}) and the\nbeyond-nearest-neighbor interactions (via J2) governs the system's approach to\nthermal equilibrium. A systematic analysis shows that the ETH is most strongly\nsatisfied for intermediate values of {\\delta} (~ 0.5) with J2 ranging from\nintermediate (~ 0.5) to large (~ 1)- a parameter regime falls within the spiral\nground-state phase. It is also found that when the system is in the gapless\nground-state phase (which falls within the N'eel phase), the ETH is more prone\nto violation. In the regime of large {\\delta} and small J2, the system is seen\nto enter a localized phase (characterized here by modulation in\ndensity-of-states; assessing ETH compliance is less meaningful for this phase.",

Although introducing TPLs by clones\nis prevalent in Java, no clone-based SCA tools are specially designed for Java.\nAlso, directly applying clone-based SCA techniques from other tools is\nproblematic. To fill this gap, we introduce JC-Finder, a novel clone-based SCA\ntool that aims to accurately and comprehensively identify instances of TPL\nreuse introduced by source code clones in Java projects. JC-Finder achieves\nboth accuracy and efficiency in identifying TPL reuse from code cloning by\ncapturing features at the class level, maintaining inter-function\nrelationships, and excluding trivial or duplicated elements. To evaluate the\nefficiency of JC-Finder, we applied it to 9,965 most popular Maven libraries as\nreference data and tested the TPL reuse of 1,000 GitHub projects. The result\nshows that JC-Finder achieved an F1-score of 0.818, outperforming the other\nfunction-level tool by 0.427.

However, while existing\ndiffusion approaches typically increase sampling steps to improve quality, the\nperformance remains fundamentally limited by the stochastic nature of the\nsampling process, leading to high-variance and quality-limited outputs.

To mitigate label noise, prior studies have proposed various robust\nloss functions to achieve noise tolerance in the presence of label noise,\nparticularly symmetric losses. However, they usually suffer from the\nunderfitting issue due to the overly strict symmetric condition. In this work,\nwe propose a simple yet effective approach for relaxing the symmetric\ncondition, namely $\\epsilon$-softmax, which simply modifies the outputs of the\nsoftmax layer to approximate one-hot vectors with a controllable error\n$\\epsilon$. Essentially, $\\epsilon$-softmax not only acts as an alternative for\nthe softmax layer, but also implicitly plays the crucial role in modifying the\nloss function. We prove theoretically that $\\epsilon$-softmax can achieve\nnoise-tolerant learning with controllable excess risk bound for almost any loss\nfunction. Recognizing that $\\epsilon$-softmax-enhanced losses may slightly\nreduce fitting ability on clean datasets, we further incorporate them with one\nsymmetric loss, thereby achieving a better trade-off between robustness and\neffective learning.

To\naddress this issue, we use the graph fractional Fourier transform to extend the\nexisting state-of-the-art generalized frequency filtering embedding (GEFFE)\ninto fractional domains, giving birth to the generalized fractional filtering\nembedding (GEFRFE), which enhances embedding informativeness via the graph\nfractional domain.

    "abstract": "Non-uniform structured network pruning methods can effectively reduce Large\nLanguage Model (LLM) size by eliminating redundant channels or layers, offering\nlower performance degradation than uniform strategies. However, existing\nnon-uniform methods rely heavily on manually designed pruning policies (e.g.,\nlayer importance and scaling factors), and therefore cannot efficiently adapt\nto scenarios with dynamic pruning ratio requirements. Additionly, a critical\nbottleneck -- the time-consuming evaluation of pruning policies -- further\nlimits the feasibility of iteratively and dynamically finding optimal pruning\npolicies. To address these limitations, we propose PPF (Predictive Pruning\nFramework), a novel pruning framework for LLMs that eliminates manual design\ndependencies via second-level performance prediction. PPF not only supports\nreal-time pruning decisions under dynamic pruning ratios but is also applicable\nto static pruning scenarios. It employs an agent for producing adaptive and\nreal-time pruning actions, while a lightweight performance predictor that can\nevaluate a pruning policy in seconds, significantly speeding up the iterative\noptimization process. Experiments on Llama2-7B and Llama3-8B show that PPF can\ngenerate dynamic/static pruning policies and it reduces perplexity by up to\n33.4% (dynamic pruning) and 84.78% (static pruning) over existing methods,\noutperforming manually designed pruning policies. The performance predictor\nachieves second-level performance prediction with high accuracy (prediction\nerror < 0.0011). It reduces the mean evaluation latency from minute-level (1\nminute and 38.02 seconds of test-set evaluation methods) to second-level (1.52\nseconds), achieving over 64 times speedup.

The impact of competing classical and quantum transport on sub-10-nm\n2D FET scaling remains poorly understood. In this work, we investigate the\ntransport properties of 2D TMD nanojunctions with channel lengths from 12 down\nto 3 nm, using first-principles calculations that integrate the nonequilibrium\nGreen function formalism implemented in density functional theory (NEGF-DFT)\nand an effective gate model. Our simulations reveal a pronounced crossover from\nsemiclassical thermionic emission to quantum tunnelling, governed by two\ncharacteristic temperatures:(1) $T_{c}$, denotes the temperature at which the\nOFF current reaches its minimum, marking the optimal condition for turning off\nthe transistor; (2) $T_{t}$, above which the subthreshold swing saturates at\nthe Boltzmann tyranny scaled by the gate-control efficiency factor. Longer\nchannels enter the classical regime at much lower temperatures, where\nthermionic emission dominates, and perfect contact with S.S. approaches the\nBoltzmann Tyranny scaled by the gate controlling efficiency. The shortest 3 nm\njunction exhibits pronounced quantum tunneling up to 500 K and achieves a\nsubthreshold swing superior to the physical limit of transistors, known as the\nBoltzmann Tyranny, enabled by the steep energy dependence of the transmission\ncoefficient. This study provides a theoretical prediction of the transition\nfrom classical to quantum transport in sub-10 nm 2D TMD transistors,\nidentifying critical temperatures that define the boundary between these\nregimes and offering key design insights for harnessing quantum and classical\nhybrid transistor technology.",

    "abstract": "Identifying transportation units (TUs) is essential for improving the\nefficiency of port logistics. However, progress in this field has been hindered\nby the lack of publicly available benchmark datasets that capture the diversity\nand dynamics of real-world port environments. To address this gap, we present\nthe TRUDI dataset-a comprehensive collection comprising 35,034 annotated\ninstances across five categories: container, tank container, trailer, ID text,\nand logo. The images were captured at operational ports using both ground-based\nand aerial cameras, under a wide variety of lighting and weather conditions.\nFor the identification of TUs-which involves reading the 11-digit alphanumeric\nID typically painted on each unit-we introduce TITUS, a dedicated pipeline that\noperates in three stages: (1) segmenting the TU instances, (2) detecting the\nlocation of the ID text, and (3) recognising and validating the extracted ID.\nUnlike alternative systems, which often require similar scenes, specific camera\nangles or gate setups, our evaluation demonstrates that TITUS reliably\nidentifies TUs from a range of camera perspectives and in varying lighting and\nweather conditions. By making the TRUDI dataset publicly available, we provide\na robust benchmark that enables the development and comparison of new\napproaches. This contribution supports digital transformation efforts in\nmultipurpose ports and helps to increase the efficiency of entire logistics\nchains.",

    "abstract": "Calibrated trust in automated systems (Lee and See 2004) is critical for\ntheir safe and seamless integration into society. Users should only rely on a\nsystem recommendation when it is actually correct and reject it when it is\nfactually wrong. One requirement to achieve this goal is an accurate\ntrustworthiness assessment, ensuring that the user's perception of the system's\ntrustworthiness aligns with its actual trustworthiness, allowing users to make\ninformed decisions about the extent to which they can rely on the system\n(Schlicker et al. 2022). We propose six design guidelines to help designers\noptimize for accurate trustworthiness assessments, thus fostering ethical and\nresponsible human-automation interactions. The proposed guidelines are derived\nfrom existing literature in various fields, such as human-computer interaction,\ncognitive psychology, automation research, user-experience design, and ethics.\nWe are incorporating key principles from the field of pragmatics, specifically\nthe cultivation of common ground (H. H. Clark 1996) and Gricean communication\nmaxims (Grice 1975). These principles are essential for the design of automated\nsystems because the user's perception of the system's trustworthiness is shaped\nby both environmental contexts, such as organizational culture or societal\nnorms, and by situational context, including the specific circumstances or\nscenarios in which the interaction occurs (Hoff and Bashir 2015). Our proposed\nguidelines provide actionable insights for designers to create automated\nsystems that make relevant trustworthiness cues available. This would ideally\nfoster calibrated trust and more satisfactory, productive, and safe\ninteractions between humans and automated systems. Furthermore, the proposed\nheuristics might work as a tool for evaluating to what extent existing systems\nenable users to accurately assess a system's trustworthiness.",

When the hopping integral and the on-site\npotential of the fermions depend on the direction of the link spins, the\nlow-energy effective theory predicts that the link spins behave as a dynamical\naxion field in 1+1 dimensions. The axion field $\\theta$ is coupled to the\nelectric field $E$ as $\\theta E$, through which the link spins rotate in\nresponse to the applied electric field or the chemical potential gradient for\ncharge-neutral fermions. This is the inverse phenomenon of Thouless pumping in\nthe Rice-Mele model. After analyzing the dynamics by approximating the link\nspins with the classical ones and utilizing the axion Lagrangian, we show the\nfull-quantum dynamics using the tensor network method. Even though we do not\nexplicitly introduce the axion Lagrangian in solving the fermion-spin coupled\nmany-body dynamics, the full-quantum results agree well with those with the\nclassical spin approximation, including the dynamics of the axion field and\nfermion transport. In addition, we find that the quantum correlation between\nspins accelerates the dynamics of axion fields as the suppression of the\nexpectation values of the link spins allows them to rotate easily.

Overcoming this transition enables realizing long-sought\norganic quantum phases of matter, including 1D synthetic organic metals and\neven high-temperature organic superconductors.

The appropriate topology connection enables an\neffective interplay between the zero-energy modes (ZMs) of terminal and the\nfinite odd-membered polyacetylene (OPA) chains. This creates a critical\ntopology-defined highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) that compensates for\nbond density variations, thereby suppressing BLA and reestablishing their\nquasi-1D metallic character. Moreover, it also causes the formation of an\nunconventional boundary-free resonance state, being delocalized over the entire\nchain with non-decaying spectral weight, distinguishing them from traditional\nsolitons observed in polyacetylene.

The proposed approach is recursive, in which the system dynamics are\nfirst decomposed into two parts, referred to as the upper and lower dynamics.\nThe control design task is then divided into two stages, that is, designing a\nvirtual controller for the upper dynamics, followed by synthesizing the actual\ncontroller for the full-order system. To this end, we start by collecting noisy\ndata from the system through a finite-time experiment, referred to as a single\ntrajectory. We then formulate a data-dependent condition as a semidefinite\nprogram, whose feasibility enables the design of a virtual controller that\nensures global asymptotic stability of the origin for the upper dynamics.\nBuilding upon this virtual controller, we subsequently propose a data-driven\nsliding variable that facilitates the design of an ASSOSM controller for the\nunknown full-order system. This controller guarantees semi-global asymptotic\nstability of the origin in the presence of disturbances. Specifically, for any\nprescribed bounded set--no matter how large--the controller's design parameters\ncan be chosen to ensure asymptotic stability of the origin. The effectiveness\nof the proposed method is demonstrated through three case studies, reflecting\ndifferent aspects of the approach.",

Using both analytical and numerical methods, we find that for a hSBH\nwith a single photon sphere, the complex visibility amplitude of the image\nexhibits damped oscillations. A similar behavior appears in the double photon\nsphere case when the inner photon sphere has lower effective potential than the\nouter one, as the photons near the inner photon sphere remain trapped by\ngravity.

In this framework, the torsion of a\nconnection is intrinsically related to the global topology of the manifold,\nrepresented by the de Rham cohomology class specified by a set of real\nparameters. We focus on the product manifold $S^2 \\times T^2$, whose third\ncohomology group is $H^3(S^2 \\times T^2; \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\mathbb{R}^2$. We\nanalyze how the geometry is modeled by the choice of the torsion tensor $T$\nwithin the family $\\mathcal{T}_\\omega$, defined by the property that each\nmember of this family must have an associated 3-form $T^\\flat$ such that it\nrepresents the nontrivial cohomology class via Hodge decomposition. Our\nanalysis reveals a dependence on this choice. First, we show that using a\ntorsion tensor, which produces a strictly positive biorthogonal curvature,\nleads to a non-diagonal Ricci tensor, creating a structural obstacle to any\nEinstein solution. Conversely, we then show that using the torsion tensor\nassociated with the purelly harmonic 3-form allow us the construction of an\nexplicit non-Riemannian Einstein solution.

The system model is considered to have uncertain model\nparameters. The key idea here is to utilize input/output data online to update\nthe model set containing the uncertain system parameter, as well as a dynamic\nestimated parameter of the model, so that the associated model estimation error\nreduces over time. This in turn improves the quality of the motion primitives\ngenerated by the lattice-based motion planner using a nominal estimated model\nselected on the basis of suitable criteria. The motion primitives are also\nequipped with tubes to account for the model mismatch between the nominal\nestimated model and the true system model, to guarantee collision-free overall\nmotion. The tubes are of uniform size, which is directly proportional to the\nsize of the model set containing the uncertain system parameter. The adaptive\nlearning module guarantees a reduction in the diameter of the model set as well\nas in the parameter estimation error between the dynamic estimated parameter\nand the true system parameter. This directly implies a reduction in the size of\nthe implemented tubes and guarantees that the utilized motion primitives go\narbitrarily close to the resolution-optimal motion primitives associated with\nthe true model of the system, thus significantly improving the overall motion\nplanning performance over time. The efficiency of the motion planner is\ndemonstrated by a suitable simulation example that considers a drone model\nrepresented by Euler-Lagrange dynamics containing uncertain parameters and\noperating within a cluttered environment.",

To achieve a\nfavorable trade-off between accuracy and efficiency for each linear layer, we\nintroduce quantization thresholds that identify activation elements where\nlower-precision formats (MXFP4 or MXFP6) incur excessive quantization error.\nOur algorithm selectively allocates higher-precision channels to preserve\naccuracy while maintaining compute efficiency. MicroMix achieves competitive or\nsuperior performance across diverse downstream tasks, including zero-shot and\nfew-shot learning, language modeling, code generation, and mathematical\nreasoning. On both consumer-grade (RTX 5070Ti laptop) and server-grade (RTX\n5090) GPUs, our kernel delivers at least 20% faster execution than\nTensorRT-FP8. Furthermore, when applied to various Llama and Qwen models,\nMicroMix consistently improves prefill latency and memory efficiency across a\nrange of batch sizes compared to TensorRT baselines.

Traditional\nrecommendation approaches, largely static and retrieval-focused, struggle to\neffectively capture these dynamic elements, leading to decreased user\nsatisfaction and elevated return rates. This paper synthesizes both academic\nand industrial viewpoints to map the distinctive output space and stakeholder\necosystem of modern FaRS, identifying the complex interplay among users,\nbrands, platforms, and influencers, and highlighting the unique data and\nmodeling challenges that arise.\n  We outline a research agenda for industrial FaRS, centered on five\nrepresentative scenarios spanning static queries, outfit composition, and\nmulti-turn dialogue, and argue that mixed-modality refinement-the ability to\ncombine image-based references (anchors) with nuanced textual constraints-is a\nparticularly critical task for real-world deployment. To this end, we propose\nan Agentic Mixed-Modality Refinement (AMMR) pipeline, which fuses multimodal\nencoders with agentic LLM planners and dynamic retrieval, bridging the gap\nbetween expressive user intent and fast-changing fashion inventories.

To this end, we propose a rotation estimation algorithm between\ntwo spherical patterns with linear time complexity $O(n)$.

    "abstract": "Family relations are the most fundamental of all social networks and\nencompass everyone. Family networks grow as individuals have children, creating\nconnections between families, which over time create large and complex\nstructures. While partner-choice homophily has been proposed as a key driver in\nthis growth process, little is known about the connection between individual\nbehavior and the emergent large-scale structure of family networks. Here, we\nanalyze a unique population-complete family network, covering millions of\nindividuals across several decades, enriched with demographic, educational, and\ngeographic data from high-quality national registries. Drawing on the\nlongitudinal coverage of our observations and using a series of growing-network\nmodels, we unravel how individual-level behavior shapes the large-scale network\nstructure. Contrary to prevailing theories, we find that partner-choice\nhomophily has little effect on the emergent large-scale structure. Instead, we\nidentify two key drivers: First, partner-change behavior, where individuals\nleave one partner for another, creates `shortcuts' in the network akin to\nrewirings in the Watts-Strogatz model. These shortcuts decrease pathlengths and\naccelerate the emergence of meso-scale connected components. Second, we find\nthat partner change is a self-exciting behavior, such that the probability of\nchanging partner increases with an individual's prior number of partners. The\nself-exciting behavior accelerates the generation of large network components,\nwith highly connected individuals functioning as network hubs. Accounting for\nthis partner-change behavior, we are able to accurately capture multiple\nlarge-scale network properties of the empirical family network. Finally we show\nthat homophily-driven behavior is not able to generate the observed network\nstructure.",

It\nexplores the underlying physics, implementation, and potential uses of this\ninnovative laser system, especially in LIDAR technology. Conventional\ndual-frequency comb systems for metrology use two optical frequency combs\nsynchronised via complex feedback loops, which suffer from phase-locking issues\nand raise system cost and fragility. In contrast, single-cavity dual comb\nsystems generate two combs with slightly different repetition rates in the same\ncavity, ensuring mutual coherence and noise cancellation. However, these\nsystems often display unstable regimes and are typically demonstrated only in\nlaboratories. This thesis aims to design, build, characterise, and optimise a\nsingle-cavity polarisation multiplexed fibre laser that produces dual optical\nfrequency combs with enough stability and precision for dual-comb LIDAR. The\nsystem simplifies generation while enhancing applicability. Secondary goals\ninclude analysing the laser intensity dynamics and collaborating with a company\nto address commercial needs and challenges in LIDAR, particularly under harsh\nconditions. Results show stable dual-comb generation with minimal drift (1 Hz\nper hour) and operation over 250 hours. The system achieves sub-millimetre\nprecision in 5-metre ambiguity ranges with a fundamental frep of 39.25 MHz and\nDelta frep of 869 Hz. The findings confirm the regime's robustness for\nhigh-precision ranging while exposing some limits.

In orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA)-based\nframeworks, conventional pilot allocation schemes face a trade-off between\nspectral efficiency (SE) and sensing performance. Interleaved pilots improve\nuser equipment (UE) multiplexing through sparse allocation but reduce the\nmaximum unambiguous range. Conversely, orthogonal block-based pilots reduce\nrange ambiguity but degrade sensing resolution due to limited delay\ngranularity. To address this trade-off, the phase-shifted ISAC (PS-ISAC) scheme\nwas recently proposed for uplink multiple access in ISAC systems. However,\nPS-ISAC suffers from spectral inefficiency due to the fixed cyclic prefix (CP)\nconstraints. To overcome these limitations, we propose adaptive\nphase-shifted-ISAC (APS-ISAC), an enhanced pilot scheme that employs an\noverlapped block-pilot structure with UE-specific phase shifts determined by\nmaximum excess delay of each UE. This design enables UEs to share the same\ntime-frequency resources while preserving separable and contiguous channel\nimpulse responses (CIRs) at the base station (BS). Simulation results show that\nAPS-ISAC significantly outperforms conventional pilot allocation methods in\nterms of SE, approximately doubling the number of multiplexed UEs. It also\nachieves lower mean square error (MSE) under power constraints with reduced\ncomplexity. Furthermore, it yields maximum range resolution and unambiguous\nsensing performance.

The core idea is to model each class by\ngenerating symbolic sequences from thresholded real-valued training data, which\nare then evolved through a one-dimensional chaotic map. For each class, we\ncompute the transition probabilities of symbolic patterns (e.g., `00', `01',\n`10', and `11' for the second return map) and aggregate these statistics to\nform a class-specific probabilistic model. During testing phase, the test data\nare thresholded and symbolized, and then encoded using the class-wise symbolic\nstatistics via back iteration, a dynamical reconstruction technique. The\npredicted label corresponds to the class yielding the shortest compressed\nrepresentation, signifying the most efficient symbolic encoding under its\nrespective chaotic model. This approach fuses concepts from dynamical systems,\nsymbolic representations, and compression-based learning. We evaluate the\nproposed method: \\emph{ChaosComp} on both synthetic and real-world datasets,\ndemonstrating competitive performance compared to traditional machine learning\nalgorithms (e.g., macro F1-scores for the proposed method on Breast Cancer\nWisconsin = 0.9531, Seeds = 0.9475, Iris = 0.8469 etc.). Rather than aiming for\nstate-of-the-art performance, the goal of this research is to reinterpret the\nclassification problem through the lens of dynamical systems and compression,\nwhich are foundational perspectives in learning theory and information\nprocessing.",

In this work we study a four\ndimensional lattice tensor gauge theory coupled to bosonic matter which has\nsecond rank tensor electric and magnetic fields and charge conservation on\nindividual planes. Starting from the Hamiltonian, we derive the lattice action\nfor the gauge fields coupled to $q=1,2$ charged scalars. We use the action\nformulation to carry out Monte Carlo simulations to map the phase diagram as a\nfunction of the gauge ($\\beta$) and matter ($\\kappa$) couplings. We compute the\nnature of correlators at strong and weak coupling in the pure gauge theory and\ncompare the results to numerical simulations. Simulations show that the naive\nweak coupling regime (small $\\kappa$, large $\\beta$) does not survive in the\nthermodynamic limit. Instead, the strong coupling confined phase, spans the\nwhole phase diagram. It is a proliferation of instantons that destroys the weak\ncoupling phase and we show, via a duality transformation, that the expected\nstrong confinement is present in the analog of Wilson line correlators. For\nfinite matter coupling at $q=1$ we find a single thermodynamic phase albeit\nwith a first order phase transition terminating in a critical endpoint.For\n$q=2$ it is known that the the X-cube model with $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ fractonic\ntopological order is recovered deep in the Higgs regime.

Notably, the performance gains of MoE\nmodels do not scale proportionally with the growth in expert parameters. While\nprior works attempt to reduce parameters via expert-level pruning, merging, or\ndecomposition, they still suffer from challenges in both performance and\ncomputational efficiency. In this paper, we address these challenges by\nintroducing micro-expert as a finer-grained compression unit that spans across\nmatrices. We first establish a more fundamental perspective, viewing MoE layers\nas mixtures of micro-experts, and present CAMERA, a lightweight and\ntraining-free framework for identifying micro-expert redundancy. Our analysis\nuncovers significant variance in micro-expert contributions during decoding.\nBased on this insight, we further propose CAMERA-P, a structured micro-expert\npruning framework, and CAMERA-Q, a mixed-precision quantization idea designed\nfor micro-experts. Extensive experiments on nine downstream tasks show that\nCAMERA-P consistently outperforms strong baselines under pruning ratios ranging\nfrom 20% to 60%.

Over the past decade,\nextensive research has been conducted to explore periodic solutions in\npiecewise linear differential systems.

This methodology conclusively establishes that the Huan-Yang\nexample has exactly three limit cycles.

The precession angles in both cases are\nanalyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively in the Kerr-Newman spacetime to\nelucidate their features. For large orbital radii, it is shown that the leading\norder of the precession angle series is generally proportional to the spacetime\nmass while the Lense-Thirring effect always appears from the subleading order.\nThese precession results are then applied to various astronomical systems to\ndetermine their spin precession rates. For systems with observational data, our\nresults show excellent agreement. For systems without observational data, we\npredict their spin precession rates at both the leading and Lense-Thirring\neffect orders. These predictions indicate that Jupiter's satellites exhibit\nexceptionally large geodetic spin precession and their Lense-Thirring effect\nmay be detectable with current technology.",

    "abstract": "Training deep neural networks (DNNs) on edge devices has attracted increasing\nattention due to its potential to address challenges related to domain\nadaptation and privacy preservation. However, DNNs typically rely on large\ndatasets for training, which results in substantial energy consumption, making\nthe training in edge devices impractical. Some dataset compression methods have\nbeen proposed to solve this challenge. For instance, the coreset selection and\ndataset distillation reduce the training cost by selecting and generating\nrepresentative samples respectively. Nevertheless, these methods have two\nsignificant defects: (1) The necessary of leveraging a DNN model to evaluate\nthe quality of representative samples, which inevitably introduces inductive\nbias of DNN, resulting in a severe generalization issue; (2) All training\nimages require multiple accesses to the DDR via long-distance PCB connections,\nleading to substantial energy overhead. To address these issues, inspired by\nthe nonlinear manifold stationary of the human brain, we firstly propose a\nDNN-free sample-selecting algorithm, called DE-SNE, to improve the\ngeneralization issue. Secondly, we innovatively utilize the near-memory\ncomputing technique to implement DE-SNE, thus only a small fraction of images\nneed to access the DDR via long-distance PCB. It significantly reduces DDR\nenergy consumption. As a result, we build a novel expedited DNN training system\nwith a more efficient in-place Near-Memory Sampling characteristic for edge\ndevices, dubbed NMS. As far as we know, our NMS is the first DNN-free\nnear-memory sampling technique that can effectively alleviate generalization\nissues and significantly reduce DDR energy caused by dataset access. The\nexperimental results show that our NMS outperforms the current state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) approaches, namely DQ, DQAS, and NeSSA, in model accuracy.",

However, localization does not disentangle the role of\nskin modes in the soliton formation from that of band dispersion. Here, in such\nlattices, we uncover two distinct soliton phases, skin-mode-assisted solitons\n(SMASs) and nonreciprocity-dressed solitons (NRDSs). Rooted in fundamentally\ndifferent mechanisms, SMASs originate from skin effect, while NRDSs stem from\nband nonreciprocity, each exhibiting unique spatial profiles. Using a stacked\nSu-Schrieffer-Heeger-like model as a prototype, we delineate the phase diagram\nof SMASs and NRDSs, each having clear phase boundaries. To interpret them, we\nformulate a Wannier-function-based nonlinear Hamiltonian, showing that soliton\nformation depends critically on how skin-mode localization and band\nnonreciprocity suppress or enhance wave dispersion. For SMASs, skin-mode\nlocalization reduces wave broadening at the localization sites, thereby\nlowering the formation threshold. This soliton phase is observable from edge\ndynamics and accompanied by a dynamical stability reentrance when transitioning\nfrom linear skin modes. In contrast, NRDSs, as well as their thresholds,\noriginate from bulk band nonreciprocity and persist under periodic boundary\nconditions.

In\ncontrast, memory-intensive OLAP operations, which are column-centric, benefit\nfrom column-store format. This \\emph{data-format dilemma} prevents HTAP systems\nfrom concurrently achieving three design goals: performance isolation, data\nfreshness, and workload-specific optimization. Another background technology is\nProcessing-in-Memory (PIM), which integrates computing units (PIM units) inside\nDRAM memory devices to accelerate memory-intensive workloads, including OLAP.\n  Our key insight is to combine the interleaved CPU access and localized PIM\nunit access to provide two-dimensional access to address the data format\ncontradictions inherent in HTAP. First, we propose a unified data storage\nformat with novel data alignment and placement techniques to optimize the\neffective bandwidth of CPUs and PIM units and exploit the PIM's parallelism.\nSecond, we implement the multi-version concurrency control (MVCC) essential for\nsingle-instance HTAP.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) experience significant performance degradation\nwhen the input exceeds the pretraining context window, primarily due to the\nout-of-distribution (OOD) behavior of Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE). Recent\nstudies mitigate this problem by remapping OOD positions into the\nin-distribution range with fixed mapping strategies, ignoring the dynamic\nrelationship between input length and the model's effective context window. To\nthis end, we propose Length-aware Multi-grained Positional Encoding (LaMPE), a\ntraining-free method that fully utilizes the model's effective context window\nfor adaptive long-context scaling in LLMs. Motivated by the left-skewed\nfrequency distribution of relative positions, LaMPE establishes a dynamic\nrelationship between mapping length and input length through a parametric\nscaled sigmoid function to adaptively allocate positional capacity across\nvarying input lengths. Meanwhile, LaMPE devises a novel multi-grained attention\nmechanism that strategically allocates positional resolution across different\nsequence regions to capture both fine-grained locality and long-range\ndependencies. Our method can be seamlessly applied to a wide range of\nRoPE-based LLMs without training. Extensive experiments on three representative\nLLMs across five mainstream long-context benchmarks demonstrate that LaMPE\nachieves significant performance improvements compared to existing length\nextrapolation methods.

The proposed algorithm\nincorporates an additional sampling strategy for sample size update into the\nwell-known framework of quadratic penalty methods. Thus, depending on the\nproblem at hand, the resulting method may exhibit a sample size strategy\nranging from a mini-batch on one end, to increasing sample size that achieves\nthe full sample eventually, on the other end of the spectrum. A non-monotone\nline search is used for the step size update, while the penalty parameter is\nalso adaptive. The proposed algorithm avoids costly projections, which,\ntogether with the sample size update, may yield significant computational cost\nsavings. Also, the proposed method can be viewed as a transition of an\nadditional sampling approach for unconstrained and linear constrained problems,\nto a more general class with non-linear constraints. The almost sure\nconvergence is proved under a standard set of assumptions for this framework,\nwhile numerical experiments on both academic and real-data based machine\nlearning problems demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

However, current RLVR methods\ntypically treat whole responses as single actions, assigning the same reward to\nevery token. This coarse-grained feedback hampers precise credit assignment,\nmaking it hard for models to identify which reasoning steps lead to success or\nfailure, and often results in suboptimal policies and inefficient learning.\nMethods like PPO provide credit assignment through value estimation, but often\nyield inaccurate and unverifiable signals due to limited sampling. On the other\nhand, methods using Process Reward Models can provide step-by-step judgments\nfor each reasoning step, but they require high-quality process supervision\nlabels and are time-consuming when applied in online reinforcement learning\n(RL). To overcome these limitations, we introduce a simple but efficient method\nCredit Assignment Policy Optimization (CAPO). Given a reasoning response\nrollout from the policy model, CAPO directly leverages an off-the-shelf,\ngeneral-purpose LLM as a Generative Process Reward Model (LLM-as-GenPRM) to\ngenerate all step-wise critique by one pass, thereby providing verifiable\ntoken-level rewards to refine the tokens that were originally assigned\nidentical rule-based rewards. This enables more fine-grained credit assignment\nin an effective way. Furthermore, to enhance the accuracy and robustness of\nCAPO, we employ voting mechanisms that scale with the number of generated\ncritiques. Extensive experiments using different backbones like Llama and Qwen\nmodels and in different sizes show that CAPO consistently outperforms\nsupervised learning-based and RL-based fine-tuning methods across six\nchallenging mathematical benchmarks and three out-of-domain benchmarks.",

This paper proposes the\nFlexible Automatic Identification and Removal (FAIR)-Pruner, a novel method for\nneural network structured pruning. Specifically, FAIR-Pruner first evaluates\nthe importance of each unit (e.g., neuron or channel) through the Utilization\nScore quantified by the Wasserstein distance. To reflect the performance\ndegradation after unit removal, it then introduces the Reconstruction Error,\nwhich is computed via the Taylor expansion of the loss function. Finally,\nFAIR-Pruner identifies superfluous units with negligible impact on model\nperformance by controlling the proposed Tolerance of Difference, which measures\ndifferences between unimportant units and those that cause performance\ndegradation. A major advantage of FAIR-Pruner lies in its capacity to\nautomatically determine the layer-wise pruning rates, which yields a more\nefficient subnetwork structure compared to applying a uniform pruning rate.\nAnother advantage of the FAIR-Pruner is its great one-shot performance without\npost-pruning fine-tuning. Furthermore, with utilization scores and\nreconstruction errors, users can flexibly obtain pruned models under different\npruning ratios. Comprehensive experimental validation on diverse benchmark\ndatasets (e.g., ImageNet) and various neural network architectures (e.g., VGG)\ndemonstrates that FAIR-Pruner achieves significant model compression while\nmaintaining high accuracy.",

Although this problem has been\nextensively investigated, existing approaches are mostly limited to uniform\nscaling transformations. This article proposes a new type of local\nmatrix-valued constraints, via which non-uniform scaling control of position\nformation can be achieved by tuning the positions of only two agents (i.e.,\nleaders). Here, the non-uniform scaling transformation refers to scaling the\nposition formation with different ratios along different orthogonal coordinate\ndirections. Moreover, by defining scaling and translation of attitude\nformation, we propose a distributed control scheme for scaling and translation\nmaneuver control of joint position-attitude formations. It is proven that the\nproposed controller achieves global convergence, provided that the sensing\ngraph among agents is a 2-rooted bidirectional graph. Compared with the affine\nformation maneuver control approach, the proposed approach leverages a sparser\nsensing graph, requires fewer leaders, and additionally enables scaling\ntransformations of the attitude formation.

Existing research shows that\npre-trained and finetuned foundation models can boost segmentation performance.\nHowever, questions remain about how particular image preprocessing steps may\ninfluence segmentation performance across different medical imaging modalities.\nIn particular, edges-abrupt transitions in pixel intensity-are widely\nacknowledged as vital cues for object boundaries but have not been\nsystematically examined in the pre-training of foundation models. We address\nthis gap by investigating to which extend pre-training with data processed\nusing computationally efficient edge kernels, such as kirsch, can improve\ncross-modality segmentation capabilities of a foundation model. Two versions of\na foundation model are first trained on either raw or edge-enhanced data across\nmultiple medical imaging modalities, then finetuned on selected raw subsets\ntailored to specific medical modalities. After systematic investigation using\nthe medical domains Dermoscopy, Fundus, Mammography, Microscopy, OCT, US, and\nXRay, we discover both increased and reduced segmentation performance across\nmodalities using edge-focused pre-training, indicating the need for a selective\napplication of this approach. To guide such selective applications, we propose\na meta-learning strategy. It uses standard deviation and image entropy of the\nraw image to choose between a model pre-trained on edge-enhanced or on raw data\nfor optimal performance. Our experiments show that integrating this\nmeta-learning layer yields an overall segmentation performance improvement\nacross diverse medical imaging tasks by 16.42% compared to models pre-trained\non edge-enhanced data only and 19.30% compared to models pre-trained on raw\ndata only.",

The Dynaword approach is a framework for creating\nlarge-scale, open datasets that can be continuously updated through community\ncollaboration. Danish Dynaword is a concrete implementation that validates this\napproach and demonstrates its potential. Danish Dynaword contains over four\ntimes as many tokens as comparable releases, is exclusively openly licensed,\nand has received multiple contributions across industry and research. The\nrepository includes light-weight tests to ensure data formatting, quality, and\ndocumentation, establishing a sustainable framework for ongoing community\ncontributions and dataset evolution.",

Classical algorithms such as\nDijkstra's and A* become inefficient as graphs grow more complex, while\nindex-based techniques often require substantial preprocessing and storage.\nRecent learning-based approaches typically focus on spatial graphs and rely on\ncontext-specific features like geographic coordinates, limiting their general\napplicability. We propose a versatile learning-based framework for shortest\npath search on generic graphs, without requiring domain-specific features. At\nthe core of our approach is the construction of a skeleton graph that captures\nmulti-level distance and hop information in a compact form. A Skeleton Graph\nNeural Network (SGNN) operates on this structure to learn node embeddings and\npredict distances and hop lengths between node pairs. These predictions support\nLSearch, a guided search algorithm that uses model-driven pruning to reduce the\nsearch space while preserving accuracy. To handle larger graphs, we introduce a\nhierarchical training strategy that partitions the graph into subgraphs with\nindividually trained SGNNs. This structure enables HLSearch, an extension of\nour method for efficient path search across graph partitions. Experiments on\nfive diverse real-world graphs demonstrate that our framework achieves strong\nperformance across graph types, offering a flexible and effective solution for\nlearning-based shortest path search.",

The results\ndemonstrate that younger executives (below 50 years) are 23% more likely to\nadopt AI technologies, while firm size significantly moderates this\nrelationship.

To address this\ngap, we present a novel heterogeneous agents model from the perspective of a\ndeveloping economy that distinguishes between speculative and non-speculative\nsectors in the FX market.

To address these limitations, we introduce ByteGen,\na novel generative model that operates directly on the raw byte streams of LOB\nevents. Our approach treats the problem as an autoregressive next-byte\nprediction task, for which we design a compact and efficient 32-byte packed\nbinary format to represent market messages without information loss. The core\nnovelty of our work is the complete elimination of feature engineering and\ntokenization, enabling the model to learn market dynamics from its most\nfundamental representation. We achieve this by adapting the H-Net architecture,\na hybrid Mamba-Transformer model that uses a dynamic chunking mechanism to\ndiscover the inherent structure of market messages without predefined rules.\nOur primary contributions are: 1) the first end-to-end, byte-level framework\nfor LOB modeling; 2) an efficient packed data representation; and 3) a\ncomprehensive evaluation on high-frequency data. Trained on over 34 million\nevents from CME Bitcoin futures, ByteGen successfully reproduces key stylized\nfacts of financial markets, generating realistic price distributions,\nheavy-tailed returns, and bursty event timing.

Despite their success, these methods\nstill face two challenges, including unnecessary incorporation of image data in\ncertain scenarios and the reliance only on a one-time extraction of visual\nfeatures, which can undermine their effectiveness and accuracy. To address\nthese challenges, we propose a novel LLM-based framework for the multimodal\nentity linking task, called Intra- and Inter-modal Collaborative Reflections.\nThis framework prioritizes leveraging text information to address the task.\nWhen text alone is insufficient to link the correct entity through intra- and\ninter-modality evaluations, it employs a multi-round iterative strategy that\nintegrates key visual clues from various aspects of the image to support\nreasoning and enhance matching accuracy. Extensive experiments on three widely\nused public datasets demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms\ncurrent state-of-the-art methods in the task, achieving improvements of 3.2%,\n5.1%, and 1.6%, respectively.

    "abstract": "Re-ranking is critical in recommender systems for optimizing the order of\nrecommendation lists, thus improving user satisfaction and platform revenue.\nMost existing methods follow a generator-evaluator paradigm, where the\nevaluator estimates the overall value of each candidate list. However, they\noften ignore the fact that users may exit before consuming the full list,\nleading to a mismatch between estimated generation value and actual consumption\nvalue. To bridge this gap, we propose CAVE, a personalized Consumption-Aware\nlist Value Estimation framework. CAVE formulates the list value as the\nexpectation over sub-list values, weighted by user-specific exit probabilities\nat each position. The exit probability is decomposed into an interest-driven\ncomponent and a stochastic component, the latter modeled via a Weibull\ndistribution to capture random external factors such as fatigue. By jointly\nmodeling sub-list values and user exit behavior, CAVE yields a more faithful\nestimate of actual list consumption value. We further contribute three\nlarge-scale real-world list-wise benchmarks from the Kuaishou platform, varying\nin size and user activity patterns. Extensive experiments on these benchmarks,\ntwo Amazon datasets, and online A/B testing on Kuaishou show that CAVE\nconsistently outperforms strong baselines, highlighting the benefit of\nexplicitly modeling user exits in re-ranking.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in\nvisual generation tasks. However, their low inference speed limits their\ndeployment in low-resource applications. Recent training-free approaches\nexploit the redundancy of features across timesteps by caching and reusing past\nrepresentations to accelerate inference. Building on this idea, TaylorSeer\ninstead uses cached features to predict future ones via Taylor expansion.\nHowever, its module-level prediction across all transformer blocks (e.g.,\nattention or feedforward modules) requires storing fine-grained intermediate\nfeatures, leading to notable memory and computation overhead. Moreover, it\nadopts a fixed caching schedule without considering the varying accuracy of\npredictions across timesteps, which can lead to degraded outputs when\nprediction fails. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach to\nbetter leverage Taylor-based acceleration. First, we shift the Taylor\nprediction target from the module level to the last block level, significantly\nreducing the number of cached features. Furthermore, observing strong\nsequential dependencies among Transformer blocks, we propose to use the error\nbetween the Taylor-estimated and actual outputs of the first block as an\nindicator of prediction reliability. If the error is small, we trust the Taylor\nprediction for the last block; otherwise, we fall back to full computation,\nthereby enabling a dynamic caching mechanism. Empirical results show that our\nmethod achieves a better balance between speed and quality, achieving a 3.17x\nacceleration on FLUX, 2.36x on DiT, and 4.14x on Wan Video with negligible\nquality drop.

    "abstract": "In recent years, significant effort has been devoted to developing smart\nmaterials whose mechanical properties can adapt under physical stimuli.\nParticulate colloidal gels, which behave as solids but can also flow under\nstress, have emerged as promising candidates. Resulting from the attractive\ninteraction between their constituents, their network architecture exhibit\nsolid-like properties even at very low volume fractions. This structural\nflexibility allows them to adopt various configurations and store structural\ninformation making them highly susceptible to memory effects. Shear flow,\napplied through rheometry, offers a simple and effective way to tune their\nproperties and imprint a ``rheological memory'' of the flow history. However,\nthe precise relationship between flow history and viscoelastic response remains\nelusive, largely due to the limited structural characterization of these\nsystems during flow and after flow cessation. Here, we use ultra-small angle\nX-ray scattering (USAXS) to reveal a strong structural memory in the solid\nstate, where the microstructure formed under shear is retained after flow\ncessation. We identify two distinct mechanisms of structural memory, as\ngoverned by the ratio of viscous to attractive forces, namely, the Mason\nnumber. Using recently developed fractal scaling laws, we show that the\nrheology is fully determined by the gel microstructure. Notably, these gels\nexhibit a double-fractal architecture, highlighting the remarkably broad range\nof length scales over which these disordered materials are structured. By\nclarifying how memory is encoded, our results offer strategies to tune shear\nsensitivity of colloidal gels and design smart materials.",

This method\nguarantees the portability of conventional frame-based vision methods to\nevent-based scenarios and maintains the intrinsic advantages of event cameras.\nThe ESI approach reconstructs intensity images by performing a single\nintegration of the event streams combined with an enhanced decay algorithm.\nSuch a method enables real-time intensity reconstruction at a high frame rate,\ntypically 100 FPS. Furthermore, the relatively low computation load of ESI fits\nonboard implementation suitably, such as in UAV-based visual tracking\nscenarios. Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the\nperformance comparison of ESI and state-of-the-art algorithms. Compared to\nstate-of-the-art algorithms, ESI demonstrates remarkable runtime efficiency\nimprovements, superior reconstruction quality, and a high frame rate.

This approach enables each component to be independently trained\nand improved using its own data, thereby maximizing the system's performance by\nleveraging the strengths of both models without requiring joint optimization.\nWe illustrate the effectiveness of our method in comparison to three language\nmodels: N-gram, GCNN, and TransformerLM across multiple datasets spanning\nvarious speech styles, including ALLSSTAR, WSJ0, and TED-LIUM 3. Our\nexperiments involved two acoustic models (wav2vec 2.0 and HuBERT) and three\nLLMs (GPT-2, LLaMA 2, and Falcon). Notably, our method demonstrates particular\nefficacy in addressing complex speech sentences, acronyms, and domain-specific\nvocabulary.",

    "abstract": "M31N 2017-01e is the second-fastest recurrent nova known, with a recurrence\nperiod of 2.5 years in the Andromeda Galaxy (M31). This system exhibits a\nunique combination of properties: a low outburst amplitude ($\\sim3$ magnitude),\nstarkly contrasting with known recurrent novae (typically $\\geq 6$ magnitudes),\nand a very fast evolution ($t_{2}\\sim 5 $ days). Its position coincides with a\nbright variable source ($\\mathrm{{M_V \\sim -4.2,\\, B-V= 0.042}}$) displaying a\n14.3 day photometric modulation, which has been suggested as the likely\nprogenitor.\n  We present a multi-wavelength analysis of optical and UV data spanning\nquiescence and the 2019 and 2024 outbursts. Archival high-resolution imaging\nreveals two nearby faint sources within $5^{\\prime\\prime}$ of the proposed nova\nsystem, which we identified as unrelated field stars. Color analysis and\nspectral energy distribution fitting suggest the progenitor is likely an\nearly-type star. Combined with archival spectra consistent with a B-type star\nwith H$\\alpha$ in emission, this points to the quiescent counterpart being a Be\nstar with a circumstellar disc.\n  We propose that M31N 2017-01e arises from a rare Be-WD binary, where the WD\naccretes from the decretion disk of its companion, explaining its rapid\nrecurrence, low-amplitude outbursts, and unusual quiescent luminosity and\ncolor. This analysis highlights M31N 2017-01e as a compelling outlier among\nrecurrent novae, suggesting a distinct accretion mechanism and evolutionary\npath that challenges the prevailing paradigm.",

The pipeline introduces\ntwo query generation methods: bottom-up from single-doc text and top-down from\nmulti-doc titles. The bottom-up method uses LLMs to disassemble and generate\nstructured queries at both sentence-level and passage-level simultaneously from\nintra-doc passages. The top-down approach incorporates three key financial\nelements--industry, topic, and time--to divide report titles into clusters and\nprompts LLMs to generate topic-level queries from each cluster. For relevance\nannotation, our pipeline not only relies on direct mapping annotation from the\ngeneration relationship but also implements an indirect positives mining method\nto enrich the relevant query-passage pairs. Using this pipeline, we constructed\na Financial Passage Retrieval Generated dataset (FinCPRG) from almost 1.3k\nChinese financial research reports, which includes hierarchical queries and\nrich relevance labels. Through evaluations of mined relevance labels,\nbenchmarking and training experiments, we assessed the quality of FinCPRG and\nvalidated its effectiveness as a passage retrieval dataset for both training\nand benchmarking.",

Our predictive reaction network reveals that OCX serves as\na critical bottleneck intermediate for cooperative CH4 and CO2 activation.\nWhile CO desorption (OCX <=> CO + X) was identified as the most influential\nstep with strong negative sensitivity toward methane concentration, OCX\nregeneration (CO2X + CX <=> 2OCX) inhibits methane conversion by maintaining\nsurface saturation.\n  Methane activation follows sequential C-H scissions (CH4X -> CH3X -> CH2X ->\nCHX -> CX), while CO2 activation proceeds predominantly via a hydrogen-mediated\ncarboxyl route (CO2X + HX -> COOHX -> COX + OHX). Three operational regimes\nwere identified: low-temperature desorption-limited kinetics (700-850 K),\ntransitional pathway activation (850-950 K), and high-temperature distributed\ncontrol with carbon management challenges (950-1300 K).\n  These insights provide design principles for platinum-based DRM catalysts,\nemphasizing temperature-specific optimization strategies. This is the first\nstudy to apply fully automated microkinetic model generation to Pt-catalyzed\nDRM, integrating sensitivity analysis, flux analysis, and surface speciation\nfor catalyst design.",

    "abstract": "Modern neural network-based speech processing systems usually need to have\nreverberation resistance, so the training of such systems requires a large\namount of reverberation data. In the process of system training, it is now more\ninclined to use sampling static systems to simulate dynamic systems, or to\nsupplement data through actually recorded data. However, this cannot\nfundamentally solve the problem of simulating motion data that conforms to\nphysical laws. Aiming at the core issue of insufficient training data for\nspeech enhancement models in moving scenarios, this paper proposes Yang's\nmotion spatio-temporal sampling reconstruction theory to realize efficient\nsimulation of motion continuous time-varying reverberation. This theory breaks\nthrough the limitations of the traditional static Image-Source Method (ISM) in\ntime-varying systems. By decomposing the impulse response of the moving image\nsource into two parts: linear time-invariant modulation and discrete\ntime-varying fractional delay, a moving sound field model conforming to\nphysical laws is established. Based on the band-limited characteristics of\nmotion displacement, a hierarchical sampling strategy is proposed: high\nsampling rate is used for low-order images to retain details, and low sampling\nrate is used for high-order images to reduce computational complexity. A fast\nsynthesis architecture is designed to realize real-time simulation. Experiments\nshow that compared with the open-source models, the proposed theory can more\naccurately restore the amplitude and phase changes in moving scenarios, solving\nthe industry problem of motion sound source data simulation, and providing\nhigh-quality dynamic training data for speech enhancement models.",

The model is compatible with\nfirst-principles calculations and accounts for INS dispersions within linear\nspin-wave theory calculations. Our results reveal a unique case of an effective\nseparation of energy scales between two differently oriented one-dimensional\nchains, with the zigzag-chain model being essential to fully characterize\natacamite's low-energy magnetism.",

The common component is modelled by a\nstatic factor model, which allows for strong cross-sectional dependence, whilst\na network vector autoregressive process captures the residual co-movements due\nto the idiosyncratic component. An assortative stochastic block model underlies\nthe network VAR, leading to groups of highly co-moving variables in the\nidiosyncratic component. For estimation, a two-step procedure is proposed,\nwhereby the static factors are estimated via principal component analysis,\nfollowed by estimation of the network VAR parameters. The method is\ndemonstrated in financial applications to daily returns, intraday returns, and\nFRED-MD macroeconomic variables.

The molecular\norganization of eukaryotic membranes has been extensively studied, including\nthe lipid raft-mediated lateral organization and the influence of the specific\nmolecular interactions. Bacterial membranes were traditionally viewed as\ncompositionally simpler and structurally uniform. Recent evidence, however,\nreveals that they possess significant lipid diversity and can form functional\nmicrodomains reminiscent of eukaryotic lipid rafts, despite lacking sterols and\nsphingolipids. Yet, the impact of unspecific physical contacts on the local\nmolecular organization and evolution of the prokaryotic membranes remains\npoorly understood. Here we use a model lipid membrane mimicking the composition\nof Escherichia coli's inner membrane to investigate the impact of contacting\nsubstrates on the membrane nanoscale evolution, when close to its transition\ntemperature, $T_m$. As expected, the presence of a substrate lowers the $T_m$\nby $\\sim$10 {\\deg}C and induces a differential leaflet transition. However, it\nalso slows down the phase transition kinetics by almost 2 orders of magnitude\nwhile simultaneously enabling a spinodal-like lateral molecular reorganization.\nThis creates local alterations of the phase of the membrane, with the emergence\nof mechanically stiffer, yet still fluid nanodomains evolving over\nsubstrate-dependent timescales, consistent with a substrate-biased lipid\nflip-flop mechanism. The results verify previous theoretical predictions and\ndemonstrate that a general physical mechanism -- driven by membrane-surface\ninteractions -- can spontaneously induce lipid domain formation in bacterial\nmembranes.

However, AT creates an inherent trade-off\nbetween clean accuracy and adversarial robustness, which is commonly attributed\nto the more complicated decision boundary caused by the insufficient learning\nof hard adversarial samples. In this work, we reveal a counterintuitive fact\nfor the first time: From the perspective of perception consistency, hard\nadversarial samples that can still attack the robust model after AT are already\nlearned better than those successfully defended. Thus, different from previous\nviews, we argue that it is rather the over-sufficient learning of hard\nadversarial samples that degrades the decision boundary and contributes to the\ntrade-off problem. Specifically, the excessive pursuit of perception\nconsistency would force the model to view the perturbations as noise and ignore\nthe information within them, which should have been utilized to induce a\nsmoother perception transition towards the decision boundary to support its\nestablishment to an appropriate location. In response, we define a new AT\nobjective named Robust Perception, encouraging the model perception to change\nsmoothly with input perturbations, based on which we propose a novel Robust\nPerception Adversarial Training (RPAT) method, effectively mitigating the\ncurrent accuracy-robustness trade-off.

    "abstract": "Since the pioneering work Lohani et. al., Phys. Rev. X 9, 041063 (2019), it\nbecame clear that quantum skyrmions have highly unusual properties as compared\nto the classical skyrmions and, due to their quantumness, cannot be described\nby continuous magnetic textures akin to the classical skyrmions. Competing\nnearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic\ninteractions in triangular spin-frustrated magnets lead to the formation of\nquantum skyrmion states. In frustrated magnets, skyrmions are characterized by\nthe helical degree of freedom, which can store quantum information. In the\nlimit of a weak electric field, the system can be described as a two-level\nsystem, i.e., a skyrmion qubit. Here, we propose a more general formulation of\nthe problem and obtain general analytic solution of the model previously\nintroduced in Psaroudaki et. al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 067201 (2021). Our\nsolution is valid not only for small barrier but for the arbitrary electric\nfield. In the case of a significant barrier, we prove that the system's state\nis not a Skyrmion qubit as it was thought before, but a Skyrmion qudit. We\nconstructed the density matrix of the Skyrmion qudit and studied its evolution\nin time. The obtained results suggest that the proposed model can be exploited\nfurther to meet the needs of quantum information theory and quantum\nskyrmionics. We showed that the $l_1$ norm of coherence of the skyrmion quantum\nqudit is a thousand times larger than the coherence of the skyrmion quantum\nqubit. The obtained result opens new perspectives for quantum skyrmion-based\nresource theory.",

    "abstract": "Ensuring truthfulness in large language models remains a critical challenge\nfor reliable text generation. While supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement\nlearning with human feedback have shown promise, they require substantial\namount of annotated data and computational resources, limiting scalability. In\ncontrast, decoding-time interventions offer lightweight alternatives without\nmodel retraining. However, existing decoding strategies often face issues like\nprompt sensitivity, limited generalization, or dependence on internal model\nstates. We propose a context-aware adaptive decoding method that leverages a\ncompact reference grounding space, built from as few as 10 annotated examples\nand comprising pairs of context embeddings and next token logits from truthful\nresponses, to enable retrieval-based logit shaping during inference. At each\ndecoding step, our method retrieves top-N semantically similar contexts and\naggregates their associated next token logits to modify the LLM's logits.\nAcross three open-ended question-answering benchmarks, our approach achieves a\n2.8 percent average improvement on TruthfulQA and further outperforms existing\nbaselines on both Biographies and WikiQA. Experimental results also demonstrate\ncross-task generalization, with TruthfulQA-derived grounding enhancing\nbiography generation.

    "abstract": "Many differentially private and classical non-private graph algorithms rely\ncrucially on determining whether some property of each vertex meets a\nthreshold. For example, for the $k$-core decomposition problem, the classic\npeeling algorithm iteratively removes a vertex if its induced degree falls\nbelow a threshold. The sparse vector technique (SVT) is generally used to\ntransform non-private threshold queries into private ones with only a small\nadditive loss in accuracy. However, a naive application of SVT in the graph\nsetting leads to an amplification of the error by a factor of $n$ due to\ncomposition, as SVT is applied to every vertex. In this paper, we resolve this\nproblem by formulating a novel generalized sparse vector technique which we\ncall the Multidimensional AboveThreshold (MAT) Mechanism which generalizes SVT\n(applied to vectors with one dimension) to vectors with multiple dimensions. As\nan application, we solve a number of important graph problems with better\nbounds than previous work.\n  We apply our MAT mechanism to obtain a set of improved bounds for a variety\nof problems including $k$-core decomposition, densest subgraph, low out-degree\nordering, and vertex coloring. We give a tight local edge DP algorithm for\n$k$-core decomposition with $O(\\epsilon^{-1}\\log n)$ additive error and no\nmultiplicative error in $O(n)$ rounds. We also give a new $(2+\\eta)$-factor\nmultiplicative, $O(\\epsilon^{-1}\\log n)$ additive error algorithm in $O(\\log^2\nn)$ rounds for any constant $\\eta > 0$. Both of these results are\nasymptotically tight against our new lower bound of $\\Omega(\\log n)$ for any\nconstant-factor approximation algorithm for $k$-core decomposition. Our new\nalgorithms for $k$-core also directly lead to new algorithms for densest\nsubgraph and low out-degree ordering. Our novel private defective coloring\nalgorithms uses number of colors proportional to the arboricity of the graph.",

However, quantized models often suffer from severe performance\ndegradation in dynamic environments with potential domain shifts and this\ndegradation is significantly more pronounced compared with their full-precision\ncounterparts, as shown by our theoretical and empirical illustrations. To\naddress the domain shift problem, test-time adaptation (TTA) has emerged as an\neffective solution by enabling models to learn adaptively from test data.\nUnfortunately, existing TTA methods are often impractical for quantized models\nas they typically rely on gradient backpropagation--an operation that is\nunsupported on quantized models due to vanishing gradients, as well as memory\nand latency constraints. In this paper, we focus on TTA for quantized models to\nimprove their robustness and generalization ability efficiently. We propose a\ncontinual zeroth-order adaptation (ZOA) framework that enables efficient model\nadaptation using only two forward passes, eliminating the computational burden\nof existing methods. Moreover, we propose a domain knowledge management scheme\nto store and reuse different domain knowledge with negligible memory\nconsumption, reducing the interference of different domain knowledge and\nfostering the knowledge accumulation during long-term adaptation. Experimental\nresults on three classical architectures, including quantized transformer-based\nand CNN-based models, demonstrate the superiority of our methods for quantized\nmodel adaptation.

Although numerous approaches have been proposed to address the\nchallenges of Deepfake detection and localization, there is still a lack of\nsystematic research on the weakly supervised multimodal fine-grained temporal\nforgery localization (WS-MTFL). In this paper, we propose a novel weakly\nsupervised multimodal temporal forgery localization via multitask learning\n(WMMT), which addresses the WS-MTFL under the multitask learning paradigm. WMMT\nachieves multimodal fine-grained Deepfake detection and temporal partial\nforgery localization using merely video-level annotations. Specifically, visual\nand audio modality detection are formulated as two binary classification tasks.\nThe multitask learning paradigm is introduced to integrate these tasks into a\nmultimodal task. Furthermore, WMMT utilizes a Mixture-of-Experts structure to\nadaptively select appropriate features and localization head, achieving\nexcellent flexibility and localization precision in WS-MTFL. A feature\nenhancement module with temporal property preserving attention mechanism is\nproposed to identify the intra- and inter-modality feature deviation and\nconstruct comprehensive video features. To further explore the temporal\ninformation for weakly supervised learning, an extensible deviation perceiving\nloss has been proposed, which aims to enlarge the deviation of adjacent\nsegments of the forged samples and reduce the deviation of genuine samples.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of multitask learning for\nWS-MTFL, and the WMMT achieves comparable results to fully supervised\napproaches in several evaluation metrics.",

Prior works primarily address this issue by reducing response\nlength, without fully examining the underlying semantic structure of the\nreasoning process. In this paper, we revisit overthinking by decomposing it\ninto two distinct forms: internal redundancy, which consists of\nlow-contribution reasoning steps within the first correct solution (FCS), and\nexternal redundancy, which refers to unnecessary continuation after the FCS. To\nmitigate both forms, we propose a dual-penalty reinforcement learning\nframework. For internal redundancy, we adopt a sliding-window semantic analysis\nto penalize low-gain reasoning steps that contribute little toward reaching the\ncorrect answer. For external redundancy, we penalize its proportion beyond the\nFCS to encourage earlier termination. Our method significantly compresses\nreasoning traces with minimal accuracy loss, and generalizes effectively to\nout-of-domain tasks such as question answering and code generation. Crucially,\nwe find that external redundancy can be safely removed without degrading\nperformance, whereas internal redundancy must be reduced more cautiously to\navoid impairing correctness. These findings suggest that our method not only\nimproves reasoning efficiency but also enables implicit, semantic-aware control\nover Chain-of-Thought length, paving the way for more concise and interpretable\nLRMs.",

EchoLadder accepts users'\nverbal instructions at varied levels of abstraction and spatial specificity,\ngenerates concrete design suggestions throughout a progressive design process.\nThe suggestions can be automatically applied, regenerated and retracted by\nusers' toggle control.Our ablation study showed effectiveness of our pipeline\ncomponents. Our user study found that, compared to baseline without showing\nsuggestions, EchoLadder better supports user creativity in spatial design. It\nalso contributes insights on users' progressive design strategies under AI\nassistance, providing design implications for future systems.",

    "abstract": "The significance of informative and robust point representations has been\nwidely acknowledged for 3D scene understanding. Despite existing\nself-supervised pre-training counterparts demonstrating promising performance,\nthe model collapse and structural information deficiency remain prevalent due\nto insufficient point discrimination difficulty, yielding unreliable\nexpressions and suboptimal performance. In this paper, we present\nGaussianCross, a novel cross-modal self-supervised 3D representation learning\narchitecture integrating feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) techniques\nto address current challenges. GaussianCross seamlessly converts\nscale-inconsistent 3D point clouds into a unified cuboid-normalized Gaussian\nrepresentation without missing details, enabling stable and generalizable\npre-training. Subsequently, a tri-attribute adaptive distillation splatting\nmodule is incorporated to construct a 3D feature field, facilitating synergetic\nfeature capturing of appearance, geometry, and semantic cues to maintain\ncross-modal consistency. To validate GaussianCross, we perform extensive\nevaluations on various benchmarks, including ScanNet, ScanNet200, and S3DIS. In\nparticular, GaussianCross shows a prominent parameter and data efficiency,\nachieving superior performance through linear probing (<0.1% parameters) and\nlimited data training (1% of scenes) compared to state-of-the-art methods.\nFurthermore, GaussianCross demonstrates strong generalization capabilities,\nimproving the full fine-tuning accuracy by 9.3% mIoU and 6.1% AP$_{50}$ on\nScanNet200 semantic and instance segmentation tasks, respectively, supporting\nthe effectiveness of our approach.

Under convexity and single crossing, the problem reduces to one\ndimensional screening and admits a tractable transfer mechanism with quadratic\nbailout costs and a statutory cap. The optimal ex ante rule is threshold-cap;\nunder discretionary rescue at t = 2, it becomes threshold-linear-cap. A\nknife-edge inequality yields a self-consistent no bailout regime, and an\nexplicit discount factor threshold renders hard budgets dynamically credible.\nWe emphasize a class of monotone threshold signal rules; under this class,\ngrant crowd out is null almost everywhere, which justifies the constant grant\nweight used in closed form expressions.

This study\npresents an Explainable Dual-Omics Filtering (EDOF) model that integrates\nspatially localized dosiomic and radiomic features for voxel-level RP\nprediction.\n  Methods: A retrospective cohort of 72 breast cancer patients treated with\nIMRT was analyzed, including 28 who developed RP. The EDOF model consists of\ntwo components: (1) dosiomic filtering, which extracts local dose intensity and\nspatial distribution features from planning dose maps, and (2) radiomic\nfiltering, which captures texture-based features from pre-treatment CT scans.\nThese features are jointly analyzed using the Explainable Boosting Machine\n(EBM), a transparent machine learning model that enables feature-specific risk\nevaluation. Model performance was assessed using five-fold cross-validation,\nreporting area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity. Feature\nimportance was quantified by mean absolute scores, and Partial Dependence Plots\n(PDPs) were used to visualize nonlinear relationships between RP risk and\ndual-omic features.\n  Results: The EDOF model achieved strong predictive performance (AUC = 0.95 +-\n0.01; sensitivity = 0.81 +- 0.05). The most influential features included\ndosiomic Intensity Mean, dosiomic Intensity Mean Absolute Deviation, and\nradiomic SRLGLE. PDPs revealed that RP risk increases beyond 5 Gy and rises\nsharply between 10-30 Gy, consistent with clinical dose thresholds. SRLGLE also\ncaptured structural heterogeneity linked to RP in specific lung regions.\n  Conclusion: The EDOF framework enables spatially resolved, explainable RP\nprediction and may support personalized radiation planning to mitigate\npulmonary toxicity.",

Nevertheless, a key barrier towards their widespread adoption is\nposed by CGRA compilation, which must cope with a multi-dimensional space\nspanning both the spatial and the temporal domains. Indeed, state-of-the-art\ncompilers are limited in scope as they mostly deal with the data flow of\napplications, while having little or no support for control flow.

We\nalso introduce a novel mapping methodology that acts as a compilation back-end,\naddressing the limitations in available CGRA hardware resources and\nguaranteeing a feasible solution in the compilation process.

However, most prior work assumes a\npurely random generative model, making the resulting algorithms potentially\nfragile in the face of real-world perturbations. In this work, we initiate the\nstudy of semi-random models for the planted subgraph detection problem, wherein\nan adversary is allowed to remove edges outside the planted subgraph before the\ngraph is revealed to the statistician. Crucially, the statistician remains\nunaware of which edges have been removed, introducing fundamental challenges to\nthe inference task. We establish fundamental statistical limits for detection\nunder this semi-random model, revealing a sharp dichotomy. Specifically, for\nplanted subgraphs with strongly sub-logarithmic maximum density detection\nbecomes information-theoretically impossible in the presence of an adversary,\ndespite being possible in the classical random model. In stark contrast, for\nsubgraphs with super-logarithmic density, the statistical limits remain\nessentially unchanged; we prove that the optimal (albeit computationally\nintractable) likelihood ratio test remains robust. Beyond these statistical\nboundaries, we design a new computationally efficient and robust detection\nalgorithm, and provide rigorous statistical guarantees for its performance.

    "abstract": "Smart contract upgrades are increasingly common due to their flexibility in\nmodifying deployed contracts, such as fixing bugs or adding new\nfunctionalities. Meanwhile, upgrades compromise the immutability of contracts,\nintroducing significant security concerns. While existing research has explored\nthe security impacts of contract upgrades, these studies are limited in\ncollection of upgrade behaviors and identification of insecurities.\n  To address these limitations, we conduct a comprehensive study on the\ninsecurities of upgrade behaviors. First, we build a dataset containing 83,085\nupgraded contracts and 20,902 upgrade chains. To our knowledge, this is the\nfirst large-scale dataset about upgrade behaviors, revealing their diversity\nand exposing gaps in public disclosure. Next, we develop a taxonomy of\ninsecurities based on 37 real-world security incidents, categorizing eight\ntypes of upgrade risks and providing the first complete view of upgrade-related\ninsecurities. Finally, we survey public awareness of these risks and existing\nmitigations. Our findings show that four types of security risks are overlooked\nby the public and lack mitigation measures. We detect these upgrade risks\nthrough a preliminary study, identifying 31,407 related issues - a finding that\nraises significant concerns.",

However, the nucleation and growth of phase-pure,\nintrinsic InSe crystals require stringent thermodynamical conditions, and have\ntherefore remained elusive. Since InSe melts incongruently, the widely used\nsynthesis methods based on cooling of a 1:1 In-Se mixture will produce either\naggregates of multiphase crystallites or uncontrolled In-rich, heavily\nelectron-doped InSe. This fundamental thermodynamic constraint provides a\ncompelling explanation for the large discrepancies observed in the reported\nphysical properties of InSe. We overcome these limitations by utilizing the\ntraveling solvent floating zone (TSFZ) method to produce high quality,\ncentimeter-size InSe single crystals.

As a central contribution,\nwe present AID4AD, a publicly available dataset that augments the nuScenes\ndataset with high-resolution aerial imagery precisely aligned to its local\ncoordinate system. The alignment is performed using SLAM-based point cloud maps\nprovided by nuScenes, establishing a direct link between aerial data and\nnuScenes local coordinate system. To ensure spatial fidelity, we propose an\nalignment workflow that corrects for localization and projection distortions. A\nmanual quality control process further refines the dataset by identifying a set\nof high-quality alignments, which we publish as ground truth to support future\nresearch on automated registration. We demonstrate the practical value of\nAID4AD in two representative tasks: in online map construction, aerial imagery\nserves as a complementary input that improves the mapping process; in motion\nprediction, it functions as a structured environmental representation that\nreplaces high-definition maps. Experiments show that aerial imagery leads to a\n15-23% improvement in map construction accuracy and a 2% gain in trajectory\nprediction performance. These results highlight the potential of aerial imagery\nas a scalable and adaptable source of environmental context in automated\nvehicle systems, particularly in scenarios where high-definition maps are\nunavailable, outdated, or costly to maintain.

We present a novel defence method against\ntargeted data poisoning, which is one of the types of Sybil attacks, called\nLinear Algebra-based Detection (FedLAD). Unlike existing approaches, such as\nclustering and robust training, which struggle in situations where malicious\nnodes dominate, FedLAD models the federated learning aggregation process as a\nlinear problem, transforming it into a linear algebra optimisation challenge.\nThis method identifies potential attacks by extracting the independent linear\ncombinations from the original linear combinations, effectively filtering out\nredundant and malicious elements. Extensive experimental evaluations\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of FedLAD compared to five well-established\ndefence methods: Sherpa, CONTRA, Median, Trimmed Mean, and Krum. Using tasks\nfrom both image classification and natural language processing, our experiments\nconfirm that FedLAD is robust and not dependent on specific application\nsettings. The results indicate that FedLAD effectively protects federated\nlearning systems across a broad spectrum of malicious node ratios. Compared to\nbaseline defence methods, FedLAD maintains a low attack success rate for\nmalicious nodes when their ratio ranges from 0.2 to 0.8. Additionally, it\npreserves high model accuracy when the malicious node ratio is between 0.2 and\n0.5.

After the shadow layers in LLMs, a reference fusion step is\nderived to compose a final mixed reasoning sequence with key tokens from\nparallel chunks, which compensates the cross-reference vision interactions that\nare neglected in MoRef-attention. By splitting and fusing the long vision token\nsequences, Free-MoRef achieves improved performance under much lower computing\ncosts in reasoning multiplexed context length, demonstrating strong efficiency\nand effectiveness. Experiments on VideoMME, MLVU, LongVideoBench show that\nFree-MoRef achieves full perception of 2$\\times$ to 8$\\times$ longer input\nframes without compression on a single A100 GPU while keeping instant\nresponses, thereby bringing significant performance gains, even surpassing\ndedicatedly trained long-video-MLLMs. Codes are available at\nhttps://github.com/wkfdb/Free-MoRef",

Existing methods often assume\nconsistently complete data or lack dynamic adaptability. To address these\nlimitations, we propose a novel Hi-MoE~(Hierarchical Mixture-of-Experts)\nframework for robust continuous emotion prediction. This framework employs a\ndual-layer expert structure. A Modality Expert Bank utilizes soft routing to\ndynamically handle missing modalities and achieve robust information fusion. A\nsubsequent Emotion Expert Bank leverages differential-attention routing to\nflexibly attend to emotional prototypes, enabling fine-grained emotion\nrepresentation. Additionally, a cross-modal alignment module explicitly\naddresses temporal shifts and semantic inconsistencies between modalities.\nExtensive experiments on benchmark datasets DEAP and DREAMER demonstrate our\nmodel's state-of-the-art performance in continuous emotion regression,\nshowcasing exceptional robustness under challenging conditions such as dynamic\nmodality absence and asynchronous sampling.

Although neuromorphic event\ncameras have been introduced to handle these scenarios, adverse lighting often\ninduces distracting reflections from tunnel walls or road surfaces, which\nfrequently lead to false obstacle detections. However, neither RGB nor event\ndata alone is robust enough to address these complexities, and mitigating these\nissues without additional sensors remains underexplored. To overcome these\nchallenges, we propose leveraging normal maps, directly predicted from\nmonocular RGB images, as robust geometric cues to suppress false positives and\nenhance detection accuracy. We introduce NRE-Net, a novel multi-modal detection\nframework that effectively fuses three complementary modalities: monocularly\npredicted surface normal maps, RGB images, and event streams. To optimize the\nfusion process, our framework incorporates two key modules: the Adaptive\nDual-stream Fusion Module (ADFM), which integrates RGB and normal map features,\nand the Event-modality Aware Fusion Module (EAFM), which adapts to the high\ndynamic range characteristics of event data. Extensive evaluations on the\nDSEC-Det-sub and PKU-DAVIS-SOD datasets demonstrate that NRE-Net significantly\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods.

However, its vulnerability to\nbackdoor attacks presents a significant security concern. Existing backdoor\nattack methods on LD often exhibit limited practical utility due to the\nartificial and conspicuous nature of their triggers. To address this limitation\nand investigate the impact of more ecologically valid backdoor attacks on LD\nmodels, we examine the common data poisoning attack and introduce DBALD, a\nnovel diffusion-based data poisoning framework for generating naturalistic\nbackdoor triggers. DBALD comprises two key components: optimal trigger position\nfinding and stealthy trigger generation. Given the insight that attack\nperformance varies depending on the trigger position, we propose a\nheatmap-based method to identify the optimal trigger location, with gradient\nanalysis to generate attack-specific heatmaps. A region-based editing diffusion\nprocess is then applied to synthesize visually plausible triggers within the\nmost susceptible regions identified previously. Furthermore, to ensure scene\nintegrity and stealthy attacks, we introduce two loss strategies: one for\npreserving lane structure and another for maintaining the consistency of the\ndriving scene. Consequently, compared to existing attack methods, DBALD\nachieves both a high attack success rate and superior stealthiness. Extensive\nexperiments on 4 mainstream LD models show that DBALD exceeds state-of-the-art\nmethods, with an average success rate improvement of +10.87% and significantly\nenhanced stealthiness.

Although existing sparse attention\nmechanisms have improved efficiency, they may still encounter issues such as\nstatic patterns or information loss. We introduce a trainable dynamic mask\nsparse attention mechanism, Dynamic Mask Attention, which effectively utilizes\ncontent-aware and position-aware sparsity. DMA achieves this through two key\ninnovations: First, it dynamically generates content-aware sparse masks from\nvalue representations, enabling the model to identify and focus on critical\ninformation adaptively. Second, it implements position-aware sparse attention\ncomputation that effectively skips unnecessary calculation regions. This\ndual-sparsity design allows the model to significantly reduce the computational\ncomplexity of important information while retaining complete information,\nachieving an excellent balance between information fidelity and computational\nefficiency. We have verified the performance of DMA through comprehensive\nexperiments.

    "abstract": "Contactless cardiac monitoring has vast potential to replace contact-based\nmonitoring in various future scenarios such as smart home and in-cabin\nmonitoring. Various contactless sensors can be potentially implemented for\ncardiac monitoring, such as cameras, acoustic sensors, Wi-Fi routers and\nradars. Among all these sensors, radar could achieve unobtrusive monitoring\nwith high accuracy and robustness at the same time. The research about\nradar-based cardiac monitoring can be generally divided into the radar\narchitecture design and signal-processing parts, where the former has been\nthoroughly reviewed in the literature but not the latter. To the best of the\nauthor knowledge, this is the first review paper that focuses on elaborating\nthe algorithms for extracting cardiac features from the received radar signal.\nIn addition, a new taxonomy is proposed to reveal the core feature of each\nalgorithm, with the pros and cons evaluated in detail. Furthermore, the public\ndatasets containing the received radar signal and ground-truth cardiac feature\nsignal are listed with detailed configurations, and the corresponding\nevaluations may help the researchers select the suitable dataset. At last,\nseveral unsolved challenges and future directions are suggested and discussed\nin detail to encourage future research on solving the main obstacles in this\nfield. In summary, this review can be served as a guide for researchers and\npractitioners to quickly understand the research trend and recent development\nof the cardiac feature extraction algorithms, and it is worth further\ninvestigating the relative area based on the proposed challenges and future\ndirections.",

In\nthis paper, we propose a novel Low-Rank Tucker Representation (LRTuckerRep)\nmodel that unifies global and local prior modeling within a Tucker\ndecomposition.

To efficiently solve the resulting\nnonconvex optimization problem, we develop two iterative algorithms with\nprovable convergence guarantees.

However, both have inherent limitations\nin practice: passive defenses are vulnerable to common non-i.i.d. data\ndistributions and random participation of FL clients, whereas current proactive\ndefenses suffer inevitable out-of-distribution (OOD) bias because they rely on\nbackdoor co-existence effects. To address these issues, we introduce a new\nproactive defense, dubbed Coward, inspired by our discovery of multi-backdoor\ncollision effects, in which consecutively planted, distinct backdoors\nsignificantly suppress earlier ones. In general, we detect attackers by\nevaluating whether the server-injected, conflicting global watermark is erased\nduring local training rather than retained.

When approaching a work zone, large\ntrucks often need to merge into an adjacent lane because of lane closures\ncaused by construction activities. This study aims to enhance the safety of\nlarge truck merging maneuvers in work zones by evaluating the risk associated\nwith merging conflicts and establishing a decision-making strategy for merging\nbased on this risk assessment. To predict the risk of large trucks merging into\na mixed traffic stream within a work zone, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)\nneural network is employed. For a large truck intending to merge, it is\ncritical that the immediate downstream vehicle in the target lane maintains a\nminimum safe gap to facilitate a safe merging process. Once a conflict-free\nmerging opportunity is predicted, large trucks are instructed to merge in\nresponse to the lane closure. Our LSTM-based conflict prediction method is\ncompared against baseline approaches, which include probabilistic risk-based\nmerging, 50th percentile gap-based merging, and 85th percentile gap-based\nmerging strategies.

To improve reliability for deployment, REACT-KD\nintroduces modality dropout during training, allowing inference under partial\nor noisy inputs. The staging task for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is\nconducted as a case study.

Existing reviews largely overlook empirical UX studies, particularly\nin adaptive and large language model (LLM)-based CRSs. To address this gap, we\nconducted a systematic review following PRISMA guidelines, synthesising 23\nempirical studies published between 2017 and 2025. We analysed how UX has been\nconceptualised, measured, and shaped by domain, adaptivity, and LLM. Our\nfindings reveal persistent limitations: post hoc surveys dominate, turn-level\naffective UX constructs are rarely assessed, and adaptive behaviours are seldom\nlinked to UX outcomes. LLM-based CRSs introduce further challenges, including\nepistemic opacity and verbosity, yet evaluations infrequently address these\nissues. We contribute a structured synthesis of UX metrics, a comparative\nanalysis of adaptive and nonadaptive systems, and a forward-looking agenda for\nLLM-aware UX evaluation. These findings support the development of more\ntransparent, engaging, and user-centred CRS evaluation practices.",

Current fingerprinting approaches face a fundamental trade-off:\nintrinsic methods require full parameter access, while backdoor-based\ntechniques employ statistically anomalous triggers easily detected and filtered\nby adversaries. To address these limitations, we introduce FPEdit, a novel\nknowledge-editing framework that injects semantically coherent natural language\nfingerprints by modifying a sparse subset of model weights.

Extensive experiments show that FPEdit achieves $95$-$100\\%$\nfingerprint retention under both full-parameter fine-tuning and\nparameter-efficient adaptation, while preserving performance on 24 downstream\nbenchmarks.

We find that\nsimple opinion statements reliably induce sycophancy, whereas user expertise\nframing has a negligible impact. Through logit-lens analysis and causal\nactivation patching, we identify a two-stage emergence of sycophancy: (1) a\nlate-layer output preference shift and (2) deeper representational divergence.\nWe also verify that user authority fails to influence behavior because models\ndo not encode it internally.

We first create a robust chest X-ray dataset (MIMIC-STRUC) that\nincludes disease names, severity levels, probabilities, and anatomical\nlocations, ensuring that the dataset is both clinically relevant and\nwell-structured. We train an LLM-based model to generate standardized,\nhigh-quality reports. To assess the generated reports, we propose a specialized\nevaluation metric (S-Score) that not only measures disease prediction accuracy\nbut also evaluates the precision of disease-specific details, thus offering a\nclinically meaningful metric for report quality that focuses on elements\ncritical to clinical decision-making and demonstrates a stronger alignment with\nhuman assessments. Our approach highlights the effectiveness of structured\nreports and the importance of a tailored evaluation metric for S-RRG, providing\na more clinically relevant measure of report quality.",

Recently, the concept of $N00N$\nstates has been extended to multi-mode $N00N$ states for quantum-enhanced\nmultiple-parameter estimation. However, the application of multi-mode $N00N$\nstates in distributed quantum sensing remains unexplored. Here, we propose a\ndistributed quantum sensing scheme that achieves the Heisenberg scaling using\nmulti-mode $N00N$ states. We theoretically show that multi-mode $N00N$ states\ncan reach the Heisenberg scaling by examining both the Cram\\'er-Rao bound and\nthe quantum Cram\\'er-Rao bound. For experimental demonstration, we employ a\nfour-mode $2002$ state to estimate the average of two spatially distributed\nphases, achieving a 2.74 dB sensitivity enhancement over the standard quantum\nlimit.

    "abstract": "Functional object arrangement (FORM) is the task of arranging objects to\nfulfill a function, e.g., \"set up a dining table for two\". One key challenge\nhere is that the instructions for FORM are often under-specified and do not\nexplicitly specify the desired object goal poses. This paper presents SetItUp,\na neuro-symbolic framework that learns to specify the goal poses of objects\nfrom a few training examples and a structured natural-language task\nspecification. SetItUp uses a grounding graph, which is composed of abstract\nspatial relations among objects (e.g., left-of), as its intermediate\nrepresentation. This decomposes the FORM problem into two stages: (i)\npredicting this graph among objects and (ii) predicting object poses given the\ngrounding graph. For (i), SetItUp leverages large language models (LLMs) to\ninduce Python programs from a task specification and a few training examples.\nThis program can be executed to generate grounding graphs in novel scenarios.\nFor (ii), SetItUp pre-trains a collection of diffusion models to capture\nprimitive spatial relations and online composes these models to predict object\nposes based on the grounding graph. We evaluated SetItUp on a dataset spanning\nthree distinct task families: arranging tableware on a dining table, organizing\nitems on a bookshelf, and laying out furniture in a bedroom. Experiments show\nthat SetItUp outperforms existing models in generating functional, physically\nfeasible, and aesthetically pleasing object arrangements.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned to align with human values often\nexhibit alignment drift, producing unsafe or policy-violating completions when\nexposed to adversarial prompts, decoding perturbations, or paraphrased\njailbreaks. While prior work has behaviorally characterized alignment failure,\nlittle is known about the training-time belief sources underlying these\nfailures. We introduce TraceAlign, a unified framework for tracing unsafe\ncompletions back to their root causes in the model's training corpus. Central\nto our approach is the Belief Conflict Index (BCI), which quantifies semantic\ninconsistency between generated spans and aligned policies, based on retrieved\ntraining documents using suffix-array matching. We propose three complementary\ninterventions: (i) TraceShield, an inference-time safety filter that refuses\ncompletions with high-BCI spans, (ii) Contrastive Belief Deconfliction Loss, a\ncontrastive fine-tuning objective penalizing high-BCI continuations during DPO,\nand (iii) Prov-Decode, a provenance-aware decoding strategy that vetoes beam\nexpansions predicted to yield high-BCI spans. Together, these defenses reduce\nalignment drift by up to 85% on our curated Alignment Drift Benchmark (ADB)\nwhile preserving utility on standard tasks, with delta less than 0.2 and\nimproved refusal quality. We further derive a theoretical upper bound on drift\nlikelihood via suffix-array span statistics, linking memorization frequency and\nlength to adversarial reactivation risk. TraceAlign thus provides the first\nscalable, traceable, and grounded toolkit for understanding and mitigating\nalignment failures at source.

For language and vision models, the emergent ability\nto perform in-context learning (ICL) has proven to be a versatile and highly\nuseful interface to easily teach new tasks with no parameter finetuning.\nUnfortunately, VLAs pre-trained with imitation learning objectives do not\nnaturally acquire ICL abilities.

After retraining\nfor in-context learning (RICL), our system permits an end user to provide a\nsmall number (10-20) of demonstrations for a new task. RICL then fetches the\nmost relevant portions of those demonstrations into the VLA context to exploit\nICL, performing the new task and boosting task performance. We apply RICL to\ninject ICL into the $\\pi_{0}$-FAST VLA, and show that it permits large\nin-context improvements for a variety of new manipulation tasks with only 20\ndemonstrations per task, without any parameter updates. When parameter updates\non the target task demonstrations is possible, RICL finetuning further boosts\nperformance.

Our model achieves a 92.20% overall accuracy on the criteria-based\nassessment and a 96.53% Markdown TEDS score.

Compared to traditional methods based on\nTransformers or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), recent diffusion-based\napproaches have shown superior performance, leveraging their probabilistic\nnature and high-fidelity generation capabilities. However, these methods often\nfail to account for the spatial and temporal correlations across predicted\nframes, resulting in limited temporal consistency and inferior accuracy in\npredicted 3D pose sequences. To address these shortcomings, this paper proposes\nStarPose, an autoregressive diffusion framework that effectively incorporates\nhistorical 3D pose predictions and spatial-temporal physical guidance to\nsignificantly enhance both the accuracy and temporal coherence of pose\npredictions. Unlike existing approaches, StarPose models the 2D-to-3D pose\nmapping as an autoregressive diffusion process. By synergically integrating\npreviously predicted 3D poses with 2D pose inputs via a Historical Pose\nIntegration Module (HPIM), the framework generates rich and informative\nhistorical pose embeddings that guide subsequent denoising steps, ensuring\ntemporally consistent predictions. In addition, a fully plug-and-play\nSpatial-Temporal Physical Guidance (STPG) mechanism is tailored to refine the\ndenoising process in an iterative manner, which further enforces spatial\nanatomical plausibility and temporal motion dynamics, rendering robust and\nrealistic pose estimates. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate that StarPose outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving\nsuperior accuracy and temporal consistency in 3D human pose estimation.

    "abstract": "The origin of certain proton-rich isotopes in the solar system, particularly\n$^{92,94}{\\rm Mo}$ and $^{96,98}{\\rm Ru}$, has been a long-standing puzzle. A\npromising explanation is the $\\nu p$-process, which is posited to operate in\nthe neutrino-driven outflows that form inside core-collapse supernovae after\nshock revival. Recent studies have identified several relevant physical effects\nthat influence the yields of this process. The impact of General Relativity\n(GR) on the $\\nu p$-process yields, however, remains unexplored. In this work,\nwe perform a comparative analysis of the time-integrated yields of the $p$\nnuclei up to $A \\lesssim 105$ in Newtonian and fully GR neutrino-driven\noutflows, using a detailed model of a time-evolving outflow profile. The two\nmain GR effects are the gravitational shift of neutrino energies and\npost-Newtonian corrections to the gravitational potential. These effects\ntogether suppress the production of seed nuclei, significantly boosting the\n$\\nu p$-process yields in our 18 $M_\\odot$ progenitor model. Most of the\nproduction of the crucial $^{92,94}{\\rm Mo}$ and $^{96,98}{\\rm Ru}$ $p$\nisotopes in this model occurs in an optimal time window, 1-3 seconds after\nshock revival. Interestingly, the same does not apply to the shielded isotope\n$^{92}{\\rm Nb}$, a large fraction of which is produced in the subsequent\nejecta. The impact of GR on this isotope is especially large, with its final\nabundance boosted by a factor of 25 compared to a Newtonian calculation. In our\n12.75 $M_\\odot$ model, an additional GR effect is observed: the outflow\ntransitions to the supersonic regime several seconds into the explosion,\ncausing the yields to drop. This study quantifies the important role GR effects\nplay in the $\\nu p$-process and provides guidance for identifying optimal\nconditions in future self-consistent supernova simulations.",

Transformer\nmodels, with their attention mechanisms, have become the dominant architecture\nin SR tasks due to their ability to capture dependencies in user behavior\nsequences. However, traditional attention mechanisms, where attention weights\nare computed through query-key transformations, are inherently linear and\ndeterministic. This fixed approach limits their ability to account for the\ndynamic and non-linear nature of user preferences, leading to challenges in\ncapturing evolving interests and subtle behavioral patterns. Given that\ngenerative models excel at capturing non-linearity and probabilistic\nvariability, we argue that generating attention distributions offers a more\nflexible and expressive alternative compared to traditional attention\nmechanisms. To support this claim, we present a theoretical proof demonstrating\nthat generative attention mechanisms offer greater expressiveness and\nstochasticity than traditional deterministic approaches. Building upon this\ntheoretical foundation, we introduce two generative attention models for SR,\neach grounded in the principles of Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and Diffusion\nModels (DMs), respectively.

Free parameters in the proposed compact least-squares schemes\nare firstly optimized to reach a broad range of resolved bandwidths with\ndifferent levels of dissipation. In addition, a shock detector proposed in our\nprevious work is introduced and validated to be not only able to detect smooth\nfirst-order extrema but also robust in detecting discontinuities. Through the\nsolution of block tridiagonal reconstruction linear systems, the resulting\nschemes can give an explicit polynomial for each control volume and are\nefficient with an acceptable computational overhead when compared to the pure\ncentral weighted essentially non-oscillatory schemes. Eventually, benchmarks\nincluding one-dimensional and two-dimensional, linear and nonlinear, inviscid\nand viscous problems on uniform and nonuniform curvilinear grids demonstrate\nthe proposed schemes' promising applicability in compressible flows which have\nboth multiscale structures and discontinuities.",

To address this, we introduce Bench2ADVLM, a unified\nhierarchical closed-loop evaluation framework for real-time, interactive\nassessment of ADVLMs across both simulation and physical platforms. Inspired by\ndual-process theories of cognition, we first adapt diverse ADVLMs to simulation\nenvironments via a dual-system adaptation architecture. In this design,\nheterogeneous high-level driving commands generated by target ADVLMs (fast\nsystem) are interpreted by a general-purpose VLM (slow system) into\nstandardized mid-level control actions suitable for execution in simulation. To\nbridge the gap between simulation and reality, we design a physical control\nabstraction layer that translates these mid-level actions into low-level\nactuation signals, enabling, for the first time, closed-loop testing of ADVLMs\non physical vehicles. To enable more comprehensive evaluation, Bench2ADVLM\nintroduces a self-reflective scenario generation module that automatically\nexplores model behavior and uncovers potential failure modes for\nsafety-critical scenario generation.

    "abstract": "The second near-infrared window (NIR-II, 900-1,880 nm) has been pivotal in\nadvancing in vivo fluorescence imaging due to its superior penetration depth\nand contrast.

To fill this gap, we propose PCREQ, the first approach to\nautomatically infer compatible requirements by combining version and code\ncompatibility analysis.

PCREQ\ncollects candidate versions, checks for conflicts, identifies API usage,\nevaluates code compatibility, and iteratively adjusts versions to generate a\ncompatible requirements.txt with a detailed repair report.

Inspired\nby the foundational work of group independent component analysis (groupICA) in\nneuroscience, we reimagine markets not as collections of assets, but as\nhigh-dimensional dynamic systems composed of latent market modules. Treating\nstocks as functional nodes and their co-fluctuations as expressions of\ncollective cognition, we introduce dynamic Market Network Connectivity (dMNC),\nthe financial analogue of dynamic functional connectivity (dFNC). This\nbiologically inspired framework reveals structurally persistent market\nsubnetworks, captures regime shifts, and uncovers systemic early warning\nsignals all without reliance on predictive labels. Our results suggest that\nmarkets, like brains, exhibit modular, self-organizing, and temporally evolving\narchitectures. This work inaugurates the field of financial connectomics, a\nprincipled synthesis of systems neuroscience and quantitative finance aimed at\nuncovering the hidden logic of complex economies.",

This new mathematical discovery disproves the common\nbelief in physics that such a twisted multilayer graphene model can only have\nhigher order band crossings or flat bands, and it leads to a new type of\ntopological phase transition.",

    "abstract": "A $2$-distance-transitive graph is a vertex-transitive graph whose vertex\nstabilizer is transitive on both the first step and the second step\nneighborhoods. In this paper, we first answer a question of A. Devillers, M.\nGiudici, C. H. Li and C. E. Praeger in 2012 about vertex-quasiprimitive\n$2$-distance-transitive graphs for the odd order case. Then we characterize\n$2$-distance-transitive graphs of valency $p$ or $p+1$ where $p$ is a prime.\nAfter that, as an application of the above result, we classify\nlocally-primitive, $2$-distance-transitive graphs of small valency.\n  In addition to the above results on $2$-distance-transitive graphs, we also\nclassify a family of amply regular graphs with diameter at least $4$ and\nparameters $(v, k, \\lambda, \\frac{k - 1}{2})$, and these graphs arise naturally\nin the classification of locally-primitive, $2$-distance-transitive graphs with\nsmall valency.",

    "abstract": "Evaluating and ensuring the adversarial robustness of autonomous driving (AD)\nsystems is a critical and unresolved challenge. This paper introduces MetAdv, a\nnovel adversarial testing platform that enables realistic, dynamic, and\ninteractive evaluation by tightly integrating virtual simulation with physical\nvehicle feedback. At its core, MetAdv establishes a hybrid virtual-physical\nsandbox, within which we design a three-layer closed-loop testing environment\nwith dynamic adversarial test evolution. This architecture facilitates\nend-to-end adversarial evaluation, ranging from high-level unified adversarial\ngeneration, through mid-level simulation-based interaction, to low-level\nexecution on physical vehicles. Additionally, MetAdv supports a broad spectrum\nof AD tasks, algorithmic paradigms (e.g., modular deep learning pipelines,\nend-to-end learning, vision-language models). It supports flexible 3D vehicle\nmodeling and seamless transitions between simulated and physical environments,\nwith built-in compatibility for commercial platforms such as Apollo and Tesla.\nA key feature of MetAdv is its human-in-the-loop capability: besides flexible\nenvironmental configuration for more customized evaluation, it enables\nreal-time capture of physiological signals and behavioral feedback from\ndrivers, offering new insights into human-machine trust under adversarial\nconditions. We believe MetAdv can offer a scalable and unified framework for\nadversarial assessment, paving the way for safer AD.",

    "abstract": "Address translation is a major performance bottleneck in modern computing\nsystems. Speculative address translation can hide this latency by predicting\nthe physical address (PA) of requested data early in the pipeline. However,\npredicting the PA from the virtual address (VA) is difficult due to the\nunpredictability of VA-to-PA mappings in conventional OSes. Prior works try to\novercome this but face two key issues: (i) reliance on large pages or VA-to-PA\ncontiguity, which is not guaranteed, and (ii) costly hardware changes to store\nspeculation metadata with limited effectiveness.\n  We introduce Revelator, a hardware-OS cooperative scheme enabling highly\naccurate speculative address translation with minimal modifications. Revelator\nemploys a tiered hash-based allocation strategy in the OS to create predictable\nVA-to-PA mappings, falling back to conventional allocation when needed. On a\nTLB miss, a lightweight speculation engine, guided by this policy, generates\ncandidate PAs for both program data and last-level page table entries (PTEs).\nThus, Revelator (i) speculatively fetches requested data before translation\nresolves, reducing access latency, and (ii) fetches the fourth-level PTE before\nthe third-level PTE is accessed, accelerating page table walks.\n  We prototype Revelator's OS support in Linux and evaluate it in simulation\nacross 11 diverse, data-intensive benchmarks in native and virtualized\nenvironments. Revelator achieves average speedups of 27% (20%) in native\n(virtualized) settings, surpasses a state-of-the-art speculative mechanism by\n5%, and reduces energy use by 9% compared to baseline.

    "abstract": "While large-scale text-to-image diffusion models enable the generation of\nhigh-quality, diverse images from text prompts, these prompts struggle to\ncapture intricate details, such as textures, preventing the user intent from\nbeing reflected. This limitation has led to efforts to generate images\nconditioned on user-provided images, referred to as image prompts. Recent work\nmodifies the self-attention mechanism to impose image conditions in generated\nimages by replacing or concatenating the keys and values from the image prompt.\nThis enables the self-attention layer to work like a cross-attention layer,\ngenerally used to incorporate text prompts. In this paper, we identify two\ncommon issues in existing methods of modifying self-attention to generate\nimages that reflect the details of image prompts. First, existing approaches\nneglect the importance of image prompts in classifier-free guidance.\nSpecifically, current methods use image prompts as both desired and undesired\nconditions in classifier-free guidance, causing conflicting signals. To resolve\nthis, we propose conflict-free guidance by using image prompts only as desired\nconditions, ensuring that the generated image faithfully reflects the image\nprompt. In addition, we observe that the two most common self-attention\nmodifications involve a trade-off between the realism of the generated image\nand alignment with the image prompt. Specifically, selecting more keys and\nvalues from the image prompt improves alignment, while selecting more from the\ngenerated image enhances realism. To balance both, we propose an new\nself-attention modification method, Stratified Attention to jointly use keys\nand values from both images rather than selecting between them. Through\nextensive experiments across three image generation tasks, we show that the\nproposed method outperforms existing image-prompting models in faithfully\nreflecting the image prompt.",

Our solution to this problem explores large\nlanguage models (LLMs) with various prompting methods. Our results show that a\nsimple zero-shot prompt on a fine-tuned model yielded the best results. Our\nfinal system achieved a macro F1-score of 0.95 on the validation set and the\ntest set. Our full code is available on GitHub.",

Here, $V_0$ denotes the energy scale of inflation, and\n$\\lambda_p$ is a coupling associated with the polynomial term of power $p$.\nThese corrections can naturally arise from couplings of the inflaton to other\nmatter fields, which also facilitate the reheating process. At the tree level,\nthe predictions of such models for the scalar spectral index $n_s$ and the\ntensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ typically lie outside the current observational\nbounds. However, incorporating one-loop radiative corrections modifies the\npotential to, \\[ V(\\phi) = V_0 + \\lambda_p \\phi^p + A \\phi^4 \\ln (\\phi/ \\mu),\n\\] where $A$ characterizes the strength of the inflaton's coupling to other\nfields, and \\(\\mu\\) is an appropriate renormalization scale. This radiatively\ncorrected potential can reconcile the model with the combined\n\\textit{Planck}+ACT data over a suitable range of parameter space explored in\nthis work. In particular, radiative corrections from fermionic loops ($A < 0$)\nsuppress the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, while simultaneously yielding a\nred-tilted spectrum with $n_s < 1$, even for sub-Planckian field excursions.\nThis brings the prediction in line with current observations, while still\nallowing for potentially detectable signatures of primordial gravitational\nwaves. Furthermore, the inflaton's couplings enable successful reheating and\nnaturally accommodate non-thermal leptogenesis, providing a unified framework\nfor inflation and baryogenesis.",

Decentralized federated learning (DFL) eliminates the\ndependency on a centralized server by enabling peer-to-peer model exchange.\nExisting DFL mechanisms mainly employ synchronous communication, which may\nresult in training inefficiencies under heterogeneous and dynamic edge\nenvironments. Although a few recent asynchronous DFL (ADFL) mechanisms have\nbeen proposed to address these issues, they typically yield stale model\naggregation and frequent model transmission, leading to degraded training\nperformance on non-IID data and high communication overhead. To overcome these\nissues, we present DySTop, an innovative mechanism that jointly optimizes\ndynamic staleness control and topology construction in ADFL.

We provide a\nrigorous convergence analysis for DySTop, theoretically revealing the\nquantitative relationships between the convergence bound and key factors such\nas maximum staleness, activating frequency, and data distribution among\nworkers. From the insights of the analysis, we propose a worker activation\nalgorithm (WAA) for staleness control and a phase-aware topology construction\nalgorithm (PTCA) to reduce communication overhead and handle data non-IID.\nExtensive evaluations through both large-scale simulations and real-world\ntestbed experiments demonstrate that our DySTop reduces completion time by\n51.8% and the communication resource consumption by 57.1% compared to\nstate-of-the-art solutions, while maintaining the same model accuracy.",

In this method, the MC samplings for the initial distribution\nand stochastic noises incorporate quantum fluctuations, and thus, we can go\nbeyond the mean-field approximation. However, description using SDEs is\npossible only when the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation has a\npositive-semidefinite diffusion matrix. In this work, we analytically derive\nthe SDEs for arbitrary Hamiltonian and jump operators based on the\npath-integral formula, independently of the derivation of the Fokker-Planck\nequation (FPE). In the course of the derivation, we formulate the path-integral\nrepresentation of the GKSL equation by using the $s$-ordered quasiprobability,\nwhich systematically describes the aforementioned quasiprobabilities by\nchanging the real parameter $s$. The essential point of this derivation is that\nwe employ the Hubbard-Stratonovich (HS) transformation in the path integral,\nand its application is not always feasible. We find that the feasible condition\nof the HS transformation is identical to the positive-semidefiniteness\ncondition of the diffusion matrix in the FPE.

This has\ndriven optimizations for both approaches, each showing distinct advantages.\nThis paper compares PD aggregation and disaggregation, showing that each excels\nunder different service-level objectives (SLOs): aggregation is optimal for\ntight time-to-first-token (TTFT) and relaxed time-per-output-token (TPOT),\nwhile disaggregation excels for strict TPOT and relaxed TTFT. However, under\nbalanced TTFT and TPOT SLOs, neither approach delivers optimal goodput.\n  This paper proposes TaiChi, an LLM serving system that unifies PD\ndisaggregation and aggregation for optimal goodput under any combination of\nTTFT and TPOT SLOs. TaiChi uses a unified disaggregation-aggregation\narchitecture with differentiated-capability GPU instances: prefill-heavy (fast\nprefill, high-interference decode) and decode-heavy (low-interference decode,\nslow prefill). Three configurable sliders control the ratio between these\ninstances and their chunk sizes. TaiChi adapts to various SLO regimes by\nadjusting sliders. When TTFT constraints are tight, TaiChi resembles a PD\naggregation configuration; when TPOT dominates, it adapts toward PD\ndisaggregation. Crucially, under balanced SLOs, TaiChi enables a hybrid mode\nfor superior goodput. The key innovation behind this hybrid mode is latency\nshifting: selectively reallocating GPU resources from requests that meet SLOs\nto those at risk of violation, maximizing the number of SLO-satisfied requests.\nThis fine-grained latency shifting is orchestrated by two scheduling\nmechanisms: flowing decode scheduling to control TPOTs and length-aware prefill\nscheduling to manage TTFTs, which jointly optimize request assignment. Our\nexperiments show TaiChi improves goodput by up to 77% over state-of-the-art\nsystems under balanced TTFT and TPOT SLOs.",

By prioritizing\nlong-term resolution while minimizing abrupt transitions, the proposed solution\nachieves an 88.7\\% improvement in resolution and an 81.0\\% reduction in\nhandover over the baseline. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness\nof this physiological signal-driven strategy, underscoring the promise of edge\nAI in immersive media services.",

    "abstract": "Accurate prediction of clinical outcomes using Electronic Health Records\n(EHRs) is critical for early intervention, efficient resource allocation, and\nimproved patient care. EHRs contain multimodal data, including both structured\ndata and unstructured clinical notes that provide rich, context-specific\ninformation. In this work, we introduce a unified framework that seamlessly\nintegrates these diverse modalities, leveraging all relevant available\ninformation through a two-stage architecture for clinical risk prediction. In\nthe first stage, a fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM) extracts crucial,\ntask-relevant information from clinical notes, which is enhanced by graph-based\nretrieval of external domain knowledge from sources such as a medical corpus\nlike PubMed, grounding the LLM's understanding. The second stage combines both\nunstructured representations and features derived from the structured data to\ngenerate the final predictions. This approach supports a wide range of clinical\ntasks. Here, we demonstrate its effectiveness on 30-day readmission and\nin-hospital mortality prediction. Experimental results show that our framework\nachieves strong performance, with AUC scores of $0.84$ and $0.92$,\nrespectively, despite these tasks involving severely imbalanced datasets, with\npositive rates ranging from approximately $4\\%$ to $13\\%$. Moreover, it\noutperforms all existing baselines and clinical practices, including\nestablished risk scoring systems. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of\nthe first frameworks for healthcare prediction which enhances the power of an\nLLM-based graph-guided knowledge retrieval method by combining it with\nstructured data for improved clinical outcome prediction.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly relied upon for solving complex\nreasoning tasks in domains such as mathematics, logic, and multi-step question\nanswering. A growing line of work seeks to improve reasoning quality by scaling\ninference time compute particularly through Process Reward Models (PRMs), used\nto reward the reasoning at intermediate steps. While effective, these methods\nintroduce substantial computational overhead, especially when generating large\nnumbers of solutions in parallel. In this paper, we investigate whether PRMs\ncan be used mid-generation to provide early signals that enable the rejection\nof suboptimal candidates before full generation of step is complete. We\nintroduce the hypothesis that PRMs are also Partial Reward Models, meaning that\nthe scores they assign to partially completed reasoning step are predictive of\nfinal output quality. This allows for principled early rejection based on\nintermediate token-level signals. We support this hypothesis both\ntheoretically, by proving that the risk of discarding optimal beams decreases\nexponentially with generation length and empirically, by demonstrating a strong\ncorrelation between partial and final rewards across multiple reward models. On\nmath reasoning benchmarks, our method achieves up to 1.4$\\times$-9$\\times$\nreduction in inference FLOPs without degrading final performance. These results\nsuggest that early rejection is a powerful mechanism for improving the\ncompute-efficiency of reasoning in LLMs.",

Our approach introduces a simple yet\neffective pipeline that adapts YOLO's convolutional backbones as encoders,\nemploys global pooling and projection heads, and optimizes a contrastive loss\nusing augmentations of the COCO unlabeled dataset (120k images). The pretrained\nbackbones are then fine-tuned on a cyclist detection task with limited labeled\ndata. Experimental results show that SSL pretraining leads to consistently\nhigher mAP, faster convergence, and improved precision-recall performance,\nespecially in low-label regimes. For example, our SimCLR-pretrained YOLOv8\nachieves a mAP@50:95 of 0.7663, outperforming its supervised counterpart\ndespite using no annotations during pretraining.

This effect refers to the predicted variation in\nlinear polarization across a rotationally broadened absorption line, due to the\ninteraction of that line with the spatially varying continuum polarization\nacross the face of a strongly scattering photosphere, such as found in hot\nstars. Even if the rotation is weak enough for the star to remain spherically\nsymmetric, the Ohman effect persists because differential absorption induced by\nthe rotational Doppler shift of the line breaks the symmetry that would\notherwise cancel the continuum polarization in the absence of that line.\nNeglecting rotational distortion effects, the net polarization across the line\nvanishes, yet resolved line profiles display a telltale triple-peak\npolarization pattern, with one strong polarization peak at line center and two\nsmaller ones in the line wings at a position angle that is rotated 90 degrees\nfrom the line center. The far ultraviolet (FUV) is emphasized because both the\npolarization amplitude and the specific luminosity are greatest there for\nphotospheres with effective temperatures between about 15,000 and 20,000K.\nThere is a high density of spectral lines in the FUV, leading to a rich \"second\nstellar spectrum\" in linear polarization (analogous to the \"second solar\nspectrum\") that is made observable with stellar rotation. Polarizations at the\nlevel of 0.1% to 1% are achievable across individual lines for a wide variety\nof B-type stars.
