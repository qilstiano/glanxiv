    "abstract": "A scenario to understand the asymptotic properties of confinement between\nquark probes, based on a 4D mixed ensemble of percolating center-vortex\nworldsurfaces and chains, was initially proposed by one of us in a non-Abelian\nsetting. More recently, the same physics was reobtained by means of a\nSchr\\\"odinger wavefunctional peaked at Abelian-projected configurations, which\ndeals with center-vortex lines and pointlike monopoles in real space. In this\nwork, we formulate the Abelian-projected ensemble and reassess the non-Abelian\none within the Weingarten lattice representation for the sum over surfaces. In\nthe phase where worldsurfaces are stabilized by contact interactions and\npercolate, lattice gauge fields emerge. This generalizes the Goldstone modes in\nan Abelian loop condensate to the case where non-Abelian degrees of freedom are\npresent. In this language, the different natural matching properties of\nelementary center-vortex worldsurfaces and monopole worldlines can be easily\ncharacterized. In the lattice, the Abelian setting also implements the original\nidea that the mixed ensemble reconciles $N$-ality with the formation of a\nconfining flux tube. In this picture, center vortices and chains explain why\nAbelian-projected variables capture this property at asymptotic distances while\nsimultaneously allowing for a 'dual superconductor' description of the\nfundamental string. Common features, differences in the continuum, and\nperspectives will also be addressed.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLM) have brought numerous of new applications to\nMachine Learning (ML). In the context of tabular data (TD), recent studies show\nthat TabLLM is a very powerful mechanism for few-shot-learning (FSL)\napplications, even if gradient boosting decisions trees (GBDT) have\nhistorically dominated the TD field. In this work we demonstrate that although\nLLMs are a viable alternative, the evidence suggests that baselines used to\ngauge performance can be improved. We replicated public benchmarks and our\nmethodology improves LightGBM by 290%, this is mainly driven by forcing node\nsplitting with few samples, a critical step in FSL with GBDT. Our results show\nan advantage to TabLLM for 8 or fewer shots, but as the number of samples\nincreases GBDT provides competitive performance at a fraction of runtime. For\nother real-life applications with vast number of samples, we found FSL still\nuseful to improve model diversity, and when combined with ExtraTrees it\nprovides strong resilience to overfitting, our proposal was validated in a ML\ncompetition setting ranking first place.",

Generating stable\nmaterials with desired properties and compositions is extremely difficult as we\nsearch for very small isolated pockets in the exponentially many possibilities,\nconsidering elements from the periodic table and their 3D arrangements in\ncrystal lattices. Materials discovery necessitates both optimized solution\nstructures and diversity in the generated material structures. Existing methods\nstruggle to explore large material spaces and generate diverse samples with\ndesired properties and requirements. We propose the Symmetry-aware Hierarchical\nArchitecture for Flow-based Traversal (SHAFT), a novel generative model\nemploying a hierarchical exploration strategy to efficiently exploit the\nsymmetry of the materials space to generate crystal structures given desired\nproperties. In particular, our model decomposes the exponentially large\nmaterials space into a hierarchy of subspaces consisting of symmetric space\ngroups, lattice parameters, and atoms. We demonstrate that SHAFT significantly\noutperforms state-of-the-art iterative generative methods, such as Generative\nFlow Networks (GFlowNets) and Crystal Diffusion Variational AutoEncoders\n(CDVAE), in crystal structure generation tasks, achieving higher validity,\ndiversity, and stability of generated structures optimized for target\nproperties and requirements.",

The BERT predictions were clarified using Explainable AI (XAI),\nimproving transparency and fostering confidence in sentiment classification.\nOverall, findings demonstrate that the proposed lexicon and machine learning\nmodels significantly enhance translation and sentiment analysis for LRLs in\nSouth Africa and the DRC, laying a foundation for future AI models that support\nunderrepresented languages, with applications across education, governance, and\nbusiness in multilingual contexts.",

Through\nreparameterization using an auxiliary variable, we are able to update a\nmajority of the parameters with Gibbs sampling, simplifying computation and\nquickening convergence. Performance gains over competing variable selection\nmethods are showcased through an extensive simulation study. Finally, the\nmethod is applied in a mediation analysis to identify community context\nattributes impacting time to first congestive heart failure diagnosis of\npatients enrolled in University of North Carolina Cardiovascular Device\nSurveillance Registry. The model has high predictive performance and we find\nthat factors associated with higher socioeconomic inequality increase risk of\nheart failure.",

In these fluids, diffusive fluxes may arise from\northogonal velocity gradients and, reciprocally, stresses may arise from\nconcentration gradients. We examine microscopic fluctuations using the recently\nproposed \"flux hypothesis\" to derive Green-Kubo and reciprocal relations for\nthe governing transport coefficients. These relations suggest that only parity\nsymmetry, and not time-reversal symmetry, must be broken at the microscopic\nscale to observe these couplings. Chiral liquids, whether passive or active,\nare therefore a natural choice as viscodiffusive fluids. We then introduce two\nanalytically tractable model systems, namely a generator and a corresponding\nreciprocal engine, which illustrate the nature of viscodiffusive cross-coupling\nin chiral matter and enable the experimental measurement of the novel transport\ncoefficients. Finally, we make the case for chiral bacterial suspensions to be\nodd viscodiffusive fluids, and use our theory to predict the behaviors\nexhibited in prior experimental microfluidic studies involving bacterial\nmigration in response to shearing flows.",

Recent algorithms mimic cooling via system-bath coupling, where the\ncost is determined by mixing time, akin to classical Metropolis-like\nalgorithms. However, few methods exist to demonstrate slow mixing in quantum\nsystems, unlike the well-established classical tools for systems like the Ising\nmodel and constraint satisfaction problems. We present a quantum generalization\nof these tools through a generic bottleneck lemma that implies slow mixing in\nquantum systems. This lemma focuses on quantum measures of distance, analogous\nto the classical Hamming distance but rooted in uniquely quantum principles and\nquantified either through Bohr spectrum jumps or operator locality.\n  Using our bottleneck lemma, we establish unconditional lower bounds on the\nmixing times of Gibbs samplers for several families of Hamiltonians at low\ntemperatures. For classical Hamiltonians with mixing time lower bounds\n$T_\\mathrm{mix} = \\exp[\\Omega(n^\\alpha)]$, we prove that quantum Gibbs samplers\nalso have $T_\\mathrm{mix} = \\exp[\\Omega(n^\\alpha)]$. This applies to models\nlike random $K$-SAT instances and spin glasses. For stabilizer Hamiltonians, we\nprovide a concise proof of exponential lower bounds $T_\\mathrm{mix} =\n\\exp[\\Omega(n)]$ on mixing times of good $n$-qubit stabilizer codes at low\nconstant temperature. Finally, we consider constant-degree classical\nHamiltonians and show how to lift classical slow mixing results in the presence\nof a transverse field using Poisson Feynman-Kac techniques. We show generic\nresults for models with linear free energy barriers, and we demonstrate that\nour techniques extend to models with sublinear free energy barriers by proving\n$T_\\mathrm{mix} = \\exp[n^{1/2-o(1)}]$ for the ferromagnetic 2D transverse field\nIsing model.",

In this model, individuals\nare placed in cities considered as agents in which the dynamics of the disease\nis modeled by eight compartments and managed by solving a system of\ndifferential equations. Individual agents move between these cities using an\nABM that controls their mobility.

Under these conditions the\nradiation yields a positive energy flux, although this is not an inherent\nproperty of the general definition. In the case of a fast-moving charge, we\nconfirm the existence of vacuum Cherenkov radiation and show that, for\nrefractive indices $n > 1$, the Cherenkov cone can split into two concentric\ncones with opposite circular polarizations. This split, governed by the speed\nof the particle $v$, $n$ and $b_0$, resembles the optical spin-Hall effect and\noffers potential applications for creating circularly polarized terahertz (THz)\nlight sources. Our Green's function approach provides a general method for\nanalyzing radiation in chiral matter, from Weyl semimetals to quark-gluon\nplasmas, and can be extended to systems such as oscillating dipoles and\naccelerated charges.",

Using the random-key concept, RKO encodes solutions as\nvectors of random keys that are subsequently decoded into feasible solutions\nvia problem-specific decoders. The RKO framework is able to combine a plethora\nof classic metaheuristics, each capable of operating independently or in\nparallel, with solution sharing facilitated through an elite solution pool.\nThis modular approach allows for the adaptation of various metaheuristics,\nincluding simulated annealing, iterated local search, and greedy randomized\nadaptive search procedures, among others. The efficacy of the RKO framework,\nimplemented in C++ and publicly available (Github public repository:\ngithub.com/RKO-solver), is demonstrated through its application to three\nNP-hard combinatorial optimization problems: the alpha-neighborhood p-median\nproblem, the tree of hubs location problem, and the node-capacitated graph\npartitioning problem. The results highlight the framework's ability to produce\nhigh-quality solutions across diverse problem domains, underscoring its\npotential as a robust tool for combinatorial optimization.",

The manifold is iteratively evolved\nusing an algorithm that involves sampling along geodesic hyper-sphere defined\nby the Riemannian metric tensor.

    "abstract": "Demand forecasting faces challenges induced by Peak Events (PEs)\ncorresponding to special periods such as promotions and holidays. Peak events\ncreate significant spikes in demand followed by demand ramp down periods.\nNeural networks like MQCNN and MQT overreact to demand peaks by carrying over\nthe elevated PE demand into subsequent Post-Peak-Event (PPE) periods, resulting\nin significantly over-biased forecasts. To tackle this challenge, we introduce\na neural forecasting model called Split Peak Attention DEcomposition, SPADE.\nThis model reduces the impact of PEs on subsequent forecasts by modeling\nforecasting as consisting of two separate tasks: one for PEs; and the other for\nthe rest. Its architecture then uses masked convolution filters and a\nspecialized Peak Attention module. We show SPADE's performance on a worldwide\nretail dataset with hundreds of millions of products. Our results reveal an\noverall PPE improvement of 4.5%, a 30% improvement for most affected forecasts\nafter promotions and holidays, and an improvement in PE accuracy by 3.9%,\nrelative to current production models.",

We search three academic databases for\nour scoping review. Methods are benchmarked on open-source EHR datasets,\nMIMIC-III/IV. Seven existing methods covering major categories and two baseline\nmethods are implemented and compared. Evaluation metrics concern data fidelity,\ndownstream utility, privacy protection, and computational cost. 42 studies are\nidentified and classified into five categories. Seven open-source methods\ncovering all categories are selected, trained on MIMIC-III, and evaluated on\nMIMIC-III or MIMIC-IV for transportability considerations. Among them,\nGAN-based methods demonstrate competitive performance in fidelity and utility\non MIMIC-III; rule-based methods excel in privacy protection. Similar findings\nare observed on MIMIC-IV, except that GAN-based methods further outperform the\nbaseline methods in preserving fidelity. A Python package, \"SynthEHRella\", is\nprovided to integrate various choices of approaches and evaluation metrics,\nenabling more streamlined exploration and evaluation of multiple methods. We\nfound that method choice is governed by the relative importance of the\nevaluation metrics in downstream use cases. We provide a decision tree to guide\nthe choice among the benchmarked methods. Based on the decision tree, GAN-based\nmethods excel when distributional shifts exist between the training and testing\npopulations. Otherwise, CorGAN and MedGAN are most suitable for association\nmodeling and predictive modeling, respectively.

In this work, we consider\nthe Gaussian random displacement channel $N_{\\sigma}$, a type of bosonic\nGaussian channels relevant in various bosonic quantum information processing\nsystems. In particular, we attempt to make progress on the problem of\ndetermining the quantum capacity of a Gaussian random displacement channel by\nanalyzing the error-correction performance of several families of multi-mode\nGottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes. In doing so we analyze the\nsurface-square GKP codes using an efficient and exact maximum likelihood\ndecoder (MLD) up to a large code distance of $d=39$. We find that the error\nthreshold of the surface-square GKP code is remarkably close to\n$\\sigma=1/\\sqrt{e}\\simeq 0.6065$ at which the best-known lower bound of the\nquantum capacity of $N_{\\sigma}$ vanishes. We also analyze the performance of\ncolor-hexagonal GKP codes up to a code distance of $d=13$ using a\ntensor-network decoder serving as an approximate MLD. By focusing on multi-mode\nGKP codes that encode just one logical qubit over multiple bosonic modes, we\nshow that GKP codes can achieve non-zero quantum state transmission rates for a\nGaussian random displacement channel $N_{\\sigma}$ at larger values of $\\sigma$\nthan previously demonstrated.

    "abstract": "Extreme multilabel classification (XMLC) problems occur in settings such as\nrelated product recommendation, large-scale document tagging, or ad prediction,\nand are characterized by a label space that can span millions of possible\nlabels. There are two implicit tasks that the classifier performs:\n\\emph{Evaluating} each potential label for its expected worth, and then\n\\emph{selecting} the best candidates. For the latter task, only the relative\norder of scores matters, and this is what is captured by the standard\nevaluation procedure in the XMLC literature. However, in many practical\napplications, it is important to have a good estimate of the actual probability\nof a label being relevant, e.g., to decide whether to pay the fee to be allowed\nto display the corresponding ad. To judge whether an extreme classifier is\nindeed suited to this task, one can look, for example, to whether it returns\n\\emph{calibrated} probabilities, which has hitherto not been done in this\nfield. Therefore, this paper aims to establish the current status quo of\ncalibration in XMLC by providing a systematic evaluation, comprising nine\nmodels from four different model families across seven benchmark datasets. As\nnaive application of Expected Calibration Error (ECE) leads to meaningless\nresults in long-tailed XMC datasets, we instead introduce the notion of\n\\emph{calibration@k} (e.g., ECE@k), which focusses on the top-$k$ probability\nmass, offering a more appropriate measure for evaluating probability\ncalibration in XMLC scenarios. While we find that different models can exhibit\nwidely varying reliability plots, we also show that post-training calibration\nvia a computationally efficient isotonic regression method enhances model\ncalibration without sacrificing prediction accuracy. Thus, the practitioner can\nchoose the model family based on accuracy considerations, and leave calibration\nto isotonic regression.",

Our scenario is as follows: We assume that the product is under\ndevelopment at a Firm B, which is a competitor to Firm A; as they are in the\nsame industry, Firm A has a relatively good understanding of the processes and\nsteps required to produce the product. While Firm B tries to keep its\nactivities hidden (think of stealth-mode for start-ups), Firm A is nevertheless\nable to gain periodic insights by observing what type of resources Firm B is\nusing. We show how Firm A can build a model that predicts when Firm B will be\nready to sell its product; the model leverages knowledge of the underlying\nprocesses and required resources to build a Parallel Discrete Simulation\n(PDES)-based process model that it then uses as a generative model to train a\nHidden Markov Model (HMM). We study the question of how many resource\nobservations Firm A requires in order to accurately assess the current state of\ndevelopment at Firm B. In order to gain general insights into the capabilities\nof this approach, we study the effect of different process graph densities,\ndifferent densities of the resource-activity maps, etc., and also scaling\nproperties as we increase the number resource counts. We find that in most\ncases, the HMM achieves a prediction accuracy of 70 to 80 percent after 20\n(daily) observations of a production process that lasts 150 days on average and\nwe characterize the effects of different problem instance densities on this\nprediction accuracy.

They are built from layers of graph convolutions which serve as a\npowerful inductive bias for describing the flow of information among the\nvertices. Often, more than one data modality is available. This work considers\na setting in which several graphs have the same vertex set and a common\nvertex-level learning task. This generalizes standard GNN models to GNNs with\nseveral graph operators that do not commute. We may call this model graph-tuple\nneural networks (GtNN).\n  In this work, we develop the mathematical theory to address the stability and\ntransferability of GtNNs using properties of non-commuting non-expansive\noperators. We develop a limit theory of graphon-tuple neural networks and use\nit to prove a universal transferability theorem that guarantees that all\ngraph-tuple neural networks are transferable on convergent graph-tuple\nsequences. In particular, there is no non-transferable energy under the\nconvergence we consider here. Our theoretical results extend well-known\ntransferability theorems for GNNs to the case of several simultaneous graphs\n(GtNNs) and provide a strict improvement on what is currently known even in the\nGNN case.\n  We illustrate our theoretical results with simple experiments on synthetic\nand real-world data.

To translate these\nmeasurements into the SHMR, we introduce a novel halo occupation distribution\n(HOD) fitting approach (``smooth-$z$'') whereby HOD parameters between\nneighboring z-bins are connected via physically motivated continuity\n(smoothing) priors. As a result, the high constraining power at z <~ 2, due to\na much wider dynamical range in stellar mass (~ 3 dex), helps constrain the\nSHMR at z >~ 2, where that range shrinks down to <~ 1 dex. We find that the\nhalo mass is tightly coupled to star formation: the halo mass with peak\nintegrated star-forming efficiency (SFE), M_h^peak remains constant within ~\n10^12.2 - 10^12.4 Msolar throughout the redshifts probed. Furthermore, we show\nthat if we had relied on COSMOS alone (as opposed to COSMOS+UDS), as has been\ndone by many preceding studies, M_h^peak would be systematically lower by up to\n~0.15 dex at z < 1.5, highlighting the importance of mitigating cosmic\nvariance.

A previous analysis found that X-ray and mid-UV observations,\nparticularly two epochs of data from Swift, were consistent with a well sampled\n7 yr optical cycle seen in ASAS data, but not convincing by themselves. The\npresent work incorporates several years of new ASAS-SN optical data and an\nadditional five years of Swift XRT and UVOT observations, with Swift\nobservations now spanning 2009 to 2021 and optical coverage from late 2000.\nX-ray observations by XMM-Newton and Chandra are also included. Analysis of the\ncombined data, which includes modeling and adjustments for stellar\ncontamination in the optical and UV, now reveals clear cyclic behavior in all\nthree wavebands with a period of 8.0 yr. We also show that UV and X-ray\nintensities are anti-correlated with optical brightness variations caused by\nthe cycle and by rotational modulation, discuss possible indications of two\ncoronal mass ejections, and provide updated results for the previous finding of\na simple correlation between X-ray cycle amplitude and Rossby number over a\nwide range of stellar types and ages.",

    "abstract": "We study the time evolution governed by the two-sided chord Hamiltonian in\nthe double-scaled SYK model, which induces a probability distribution over\noperators in the double-scaled algebra. Through the bulk-to-boundary map, this\ndistribution translates into dynamical profiles of bulk states within the chord\nHilbert space. We derive analytic expressions for such profiles, valid across a\nbroad parameter range and all time scales. Additionally, we demonstrate how\ndistinct semi-classical behaviors emerge by localizing within specific energy\nregions in the semi-classical limit. We revisit the doubled Hilbert space\nformalism as an isometric map between the one-particle sector of the chord\nHilbert space and the doubled zero-particle sector. Utilizing this map, we\nobtain analytic results for correlation functions and investigate the dynamical\nevolution for chord operators. Specifically, we establish an equivalence\nbetween the chord number generating function in presence of matter chords and\nthe crossed four-point correlation function, the latter is closely related to\nthe $6j$-symbol of $U_{\\sqrt{q}}(\\mathfrak{su}(1,1))$. We also explore\nfinite-temperature effects, showing that operator spreading slows as\ntemperature decreases. In the semi-classical limit, we perform a saddle point\nanalysis and incorporate the one-loop determinant to derive the normalized\ntime-ordered four-point correlation function at infinite temperature. The\nleading correction reproduces the \\(1/N\\) connected contribution observed in\nthe large-\\(p\\) SYK model. Finally, we examine the time evolution of total\nchord number in presence of matter in the triple-scaled regime, linking it to\nthe renormalized two-sided length in JT gravity with matter.",

    "abstract": "Modeling a human avatar that can plausibly deform to articulations is an\nactive area of research. We present PocoLoco -- the first template-free,\npoint-based, pose-conditioned generative model for 3D humans in loose clothing.\nWe motivate our work by noting that most methods require a parametric model of\nthe human body to ground pose-dependent deformations. Consequently, they are\nrestricted to modeling clothing that is topologically similar to the naked body\nand do not extend well to loose clothing. The few methods that attempt to model\nloose clothing typically require either canonicalization or a\nUV-parameterization and need to address the challenging problem of explicitly\nestimating correspondences for the deforming clothes. In this work, we\nformulate avatar clothing deformation as a conditional point-cloud generation\ntask within the denoising diffusion framework. Crucially, our framework\noperates directly on unordered point clouds, eliminating the need for a\nparametric model or a clothing template. This also enables a variety of\npractical applications, such as point-cloud completion and pose-based editing\n-- important features for virtual human animation. As current datasets for\nhuman avatars in loose clothing are far too small for training diffusion\nmodels, we release a dataset of two subjects performing various poses in loose\nclothing with a total of 75K point clouds. By contributing towards tackling the\nchallenging task of effectively modeling loose clothing and expanding the\navailable data for training these models, we aim to set the stage for further\ninnovation in digital humans.

While much of the existing\nresearch focuses on racing in obstacle-free environments, few studies have\naddressed the complexities of obstacle-aware racing, and approaches presented\nin these studies often suffer from overfitting, with learned policies\ngeneralizing poorly to new environments. This work addresses the challenge of\ndeveloping a generalizable obstacle-aware drone racing policy using deep\nreinforcement learning. We propose applying domain randomization on racing\ntracks and obstacle configurations before every rollout, combined with parallel\nexperience collection in randomized environments to achieve the goal. The\nproposed randomization strategy is shown to be effective through simulated\nexperiments where drones reach speeds of up to 70 km/h, racing in unseen\ncluttered environments. This study serves as a stepping stone toward learning\nrobust policies for obstacle-aware drone racing and general-purpose drone\nnavigation in cluttered environments.

This temperature gradient can generate an\nelectric field within the medium, a phenomenon referred to as the Seebeck\neffect. We have estimated the Seebeck coefficient for a dense quark-gluon\nplasma medium by using the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation in the\nrecently developed novel relaxation time approximation (RTA) model within the\nkinetic theory framework. This study explores the Seebeck coefficient of\nindividual quark flavors as well as the entire partonic medium. Our observation\nindicates that, for given current quark masses, the magnitude of the Seebeck\ncoefficient for each quark flavor as well as for the partonic medium decreases\nas the temperature rises and increases as the chemical potential increases.\nFurthermore, we have investigated the Seebeck effect by considering the\npartonic interactions within the quasiparticle model. In addition, we have\npresented a comparison between our findings and the results of the standard RTA\nmodel. We have observed that the Seebeck coefficient of the QGP medium gets\nconspicuously decreased in the novel RTA model as compared to that in the\nstandard RTA model. A decreased Seebeck coefficient in the novel RTA model\ndescribes a smaller magnitude of induced electric field in the medium than that\nestimated by the standard RTA model. However, the rate of decline gets\ngradually smaller as the medium gets hotter for both the current quark mass\nscenario and the quasiparticle mass scenario. It is also found that, in the\nnoninteracting case, the Seebeck coefficient possesses a slightly negative\nvalue in the high temperature region, unlike the quasiparticle description,\nwhere the Seebeck coefficient remains positive for the entire temperature\nrange.",

This is\nbecause weighted statistics from complex sample survey data can be more\nsensitive to individual survey response and weight values than unweighted\nstatistics, resulting in differentially private mechanisms that can add\nsubstantial noise to the unbiased estimate of the finite population quantity.\nOn the other hand, simply disregarding the survey weights adds noise to a\nbiased estimator, which also can result in an inaccurate estimate. Thus, the\nproblem of releasing an accurate survey-weighted estimate essentially involves\na trade-off among bias, precision, and privacy. We leverage this trade-off to\ndevelop a differentially private method for estimating finite population\nquantities. The key step is to privately estimate a hyperparameter that\ndetermines how much to regularize or shrink survey weights as a function of\nprivacy loss. We illustrate the differentially private finite population\nestimation using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics. We show that optimal\nstrategies for releasing DP survey-weighted mean income estimates require\norders-of-magnitude less noise than naively using the original survey weights\nwithout modification.",

The dataset consists of 756,000 datapoints,\ncounting 300 iterations repeated across 15 academic events, 2 biological\ngenders, 2 career levels and 42 unique item responses of the Depression,\nAnxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-42). PhDGPT integrates these psychometric\nscores with their explanations in plain language. This synergy of scores and\ntexts offers a dual, comprehensive perspective on the emotional well-being of\nsimulated academics, e.g. male/female PhD students or professors. By combining\nnetwork psychometrics and psycholinguistic dimensions, this study identifies\nseveral similarities and distinctions between human and LLM data. The\npsychometric networks of simulated male professors do not differ between\nphysical and emotional anxiety subscales, unlike humans. Other LLMs'\npersonification can reconstruct human DASS factors with a purity up to 80%.\nFurthemore, LLM-generated personifications across different scenarios are found\nto elicit explanations lower in concreteness and imageability in items coding\nfor anxiety, in agreement with past studies about human psychology. Our\nfindings indicate an advanced yet incomplete ability for LLMs to reproduce the\ncomplexity of human psychometric data, unveiling convenient advantages and\nlimitations in using LLMs to replace human participants. PhDGPT also\nintriguingly capture the ability for LLMs to adapt and change language patterns\naccording to prompted mental distress contextual features, opening new\nquantitative opportunities for assessing the machine psychology of these\nartificial intelligences.",

    "abstract": "We put forth Oblivious State Preparation (OSP) as a cryptographic primitive\nthat unifies techniques developed in the context of a quantum server\ninteracting with a classical client. OSP allows a classical polynomial-time\nsender to input a choice of one out of two public observables, and a quantum\npolynomial-time receiver to recover an eigenstate of the corresponding\nobservable -- while keeping the sender's choice hidden from any malicious\nreceiver. We obtain the following results:\n  - The existence of (plain) trapdoor claw-free functions implies OSP, and the\nexistence of dual-mode trapdoor claw-free functions implies round-optimal\n(two-round) OSP.\n  - OSP implies the existence of proofs of quantumness, test of a qubit, blind\nclassical delegation of quantum computation, and classical verification of\nquantum computation.\n  - Two-round OSP implies quantum money with classical communication,\nclassically-verifiable position verification, and (additionally assuming\nclassical FHE with log-depth decryption) quantum FHE.\n  Several of these applications were previously only known via tailored\nLWE-based constructions, whereas our OSP-based constructions yield new results\nfrom a wider variety of assumptions, including hard problems on cryptographic\ngroup actions. Finally, towards understanding the minimal hardness assumptions\nrequired to realize OSP, we prove the following:\n  - OSP implies oblivious transfer between one classical and one quantum party.\n  - Two-round OSP implies public-key encryption with classical keys and\nciphertexts.\n  In particular, these results help to ''explain'' the use of public-key\ncryptography in the known approaches to establishing a ''classical leash'' on a\nquantum server. For example, combined with a result of Austrin et al. (CRYPTO\n22), we conclude that perfectly-correct OSP cannot exist unconditionally in the\n(quantum) random oracle model.",

    "abstract": "The motion of bodies ejected from the Earth was studied, and the\nprobabilities of collisions of such bodies with the present terrestrial planets\nwere calculated. The dependences of these probabilities on velocities, angles\nand points of ejection of bodies were studied. These dependences can be used in\nthe models with different distributions of ejected material. On average, about\na half and less than 10\\% of initial ejected bodies remained moving in\nelliptical orbits in the Solar System after 10 and 100 Myr, respectively. A few\nejected bodies collided with planets after 250 Myr. As dynamical lifetimes of\nbodies ejected from the Earth can reach hundreds of million years, a few\npercent of bodies ejected at the Chicxulub and Popigai events about 36-65 Myr\nago can still move in the zone of the terrestrial planets and have small\nchances to collide with planets, including the Earth. The fraction of ejected\nbodies that collided with the Earth was greater for smaller ejection velocity.\nThe fractions of bodies delivered to the Earth and Venus probably did not\ndiffer much for these planets and were about 0.2-0.3 each. Such obtained\nresults testify in favour of that the upper layers of the Earth and Venus can\ncontain similar material. The fractions of bodies ejected from the Earth that\ncollided with Mercury and Mars did not exceed 0.08 and 0.025, respectively. The\nfractions of bodies collided with Jupiter were of the order of 0.001. In most\ncalculations the fraction of bodies collided with the Sun was between 0.2 and\n0.5. Depending on parameters of ejection, the fraction of bodies ejected into\nhyperbolic orbits could vary from 0 to 1. Small fractions of material ejected\nfrom the Earth can be found on other terrestrial planets and Jupiter, as the\nejected bodies could collide with these planets.

The use of deep generative models (DGMs) for synthetic data\ngeneration is known to induce considerable bias and imprecision into synthetic\ndata analyses, compromising their inferential utility as opposed to original\ndata analyses. This bias and uncertainty can be substantial enough to impede\nstatistical convergence rates, even in seemingly straightforward analyses like\nmean calculation. The standard errors of such estimators then exhibit slower\nshrinkage with sample size than the typical 1 over root-$n$ rate. This\ncomplicates fundamental calculations like p-values and confidence intervals,\nwith no straightforward remedy currently available. In response to these\nchallenges, we propose a new strategy that targets synthetic data created by\nDGMs for specific data analyses. Drawing insights from debiased and targeted\nmachine learning, our approach accounts for biases, enhances convergence rates,\nand facilitates the calculation of estimators with easily approximated large\nsample variances. We exemplify our proposal through a simulation study on toy\ndata and two case studies on real-world data, highlighting the importance of\ntailoring DGMs for targeted data analysis.

This assumption, however, does not hold for many applications\nwith indivisible bids. In this paper, we remove the FLM assumption and tackle\nthe open problem of OBM with general bids. We first establish an upper bound of\n1-\\kappa on the competitive ratio for any deterministic online algorithm. We\nthen propose a novel meta algorithm, called MetaAd, which reduces to different\nalgorithms with first known provable competitive ratios parameterized by the\nmaximum bid-to-budget ratio \\kappa \\in [0, 1]. As a by-product, we extend\nMetaAd to the FLM setting and get provable competitive algorithms. Finally, we\napply our competitive analysis to the design learning-augmented algorithms.",

Power spectrum techniques may be\nable to avoid these foregrounds by extracting foreground-free Fourier modes,\nbut this is exacerbated by instrumental systematics that can add spectral\nstructure to the data, leaking foreground power to the foreground-free Fourier\nmodes. It is therefore imperative that any instrumental systematic effects are\nproperly understood and mitigated. One such systematic occurs when neighboring\nantennas have undesired coupling. A systematic in Phase II data from the MWA\nwas identified which manifests as excess correlation in the visibilities. One\npossible explanation for such an effect is mutual coupling between antennas.

In this work, we\ninvestigate novel topological phenomena in the monitored dynamics through the\nlens of free-fermion systems. Free-fermion monitored dynamics were previously\nshown to be unified with the Anderson localization problem under the\nAltland-Zirnbauer symmetry classification.

As examples, we focus on 1+1D free-fermion\nmonitored dynamics in two symmetry classes, DIII and A. We construct quantum\ncircuit models to study different topological area-law phases and their domain\nwalls in the respective symmetry classes. We find that the domain wall between\ntopologically distinct area-law phases hosts dynamical topological modes whose\nentanglement is protected from being quenched by the measurements in the\nmonitored dynamics.

These frequencies differ due to periapsis advance. Restricting to the (2,\n2) multipole, we find that the frequencies can be expressed as $f = 2 f_{\\phi}\n+ k f_{\\mathrm{r}}$. We introduce a straightforward method of generating these\nharmonics and show that the majority of the signal power is contained in the\n$k= -1, 0, 1$ harmonics for moderate eccentricities.

The resulting\nsample contains rare or unusual sources which are simultaneously as diverse as\nthe human trainer chooses, and of scientific interest to them. We train Protege\non images from the MeerKAT Galaxy Cluster Legacy Survey, leveraging the\nself-supervised deep learning algorithm Bootstrap Your Own Latent to find a\nlow-dimensional representation of the radio galaxy cutouts. By operating in\nthis feature space, Protege is able to recommend interesting sources with\ncompletely different morphologies in image space to those it has been trained\non. This provides important advantages over similarity searches, which can only\nfind more examples of known sources, or blind anomaly detection, which selects\nunusual, but not necessarily scientifically interesting sources. Using an\nevaluation subset, we show that, with minimal training, Protege provides\nexcellent recommendations and find that it is even able to recommend sources\nthat the authors missed. We briefly highlight some of Protege's top\nrecommendations, which include X- and circular-shaped sources, filamentary\nstructures and one-sided structures.

However, existing Lya-based bubble measurement\nstrategies rely on constraints from single galaxies, which are limited by the\nlarge variability in intrinsic Ly$\\alpha$ emission. As a first step, we present\ntwo bubble size estimation methods using Lya spectroscopy of ensembles of\ngalaxies, enabling us to map ionized structures and marginalize over Ly$\\alpha$\nemission variability. We test our methods using Gpc-scale reionization\nsimulations of the intergalactic medium (IGM). To map bubbles in the plane of\nthe sky, we develop an edge detection method based on the asymmetry of\nLy$\\alpha$ transmission as a function of spatial position. To map bubbles along\nthe line-of-sight, we develop an algorithm using the tight relation between\nLy$\\alpha$ transmission and the line-of-sight distance from galaxies to the\nnearest neutral IGM patch. Both methods can robustly recover bubbles with\nradius $\\gtrsim$10 comoving Mpc, sufficient for mapping bubbles even in the\nearly phases of reionization, when the IGM is $\\sim70-90\\%$ neutral.

Aims. This work aims to investigate\nthe chemical abundance patterns for CNO elements and Li in a homogeneously\nanalyzed sample of 52 metal-poor halo giant stars. Methods. We used\nhigh-resolution spectra with a high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) to carry out a\nspectral synthesis to derive detailed C, N, O, and Li abundances for a sample\nof stars with metallicities in the range of -3.58 <= [Fe/H] <= -1.79 dex. Our\nstudy was based on the assumption of one-dimensional (1D) local thermodynamic\nequilibrium (LTE) atmospheres. Results. Based on carbon and nitrogen\nabundances, we investigated the deep mixing taking place within stars along the\nred giant branch (RGB). The individual abundances of carbon decrease towards\nthe upper RGB while nitrogen shows an increasing trend, indicating that carbon\nhas been converted into nitrogen. No signatures of ON-cycle processed material\nwere found for the stars in our sample. We computed a set of galactic chemical\nevolution (GCE) models, implementing different sets of massive star yields,\nboth with and without including the effects of stellar rotation on\nnucleosynthesis. We confirm that stellar rotation is necessary to explain the\nhighest [N/Fe] and [N/O] ratios observed in unmixed halo stars. The predicted\nlevel of N enhancement varies sensibly in dependence of the specific set of\nyields that are adopted. For stars with stellar parameters similar to those of\nour sample, heavy elements such as Sr, Y, and Zr appear to have unchanged\nabundances despite the stellar evolution mixing processes.",

In this\nspirit, we present a general approach to the study of a Penrose process driven\nby plasmoids that are produced at reconnection sites along current sheets. Our\nformalism is meant to determine the physical conditions that make a\nplasmoid-driven Penrose process energetically viable and can be applied to\nscenarios that are matter- or magnetic-field-dominated, that is, in\nmagnetohydrodynamical or force-free descriptions. By exploring reconnection\nfrom an axisymmetric but curved surface, our approach can be considered\ngenuinely multidimensional and allows us to explore conditions that are beyond\nthe ones explored so far and that have been restricted to the equatorial plane.\nFurthermore, it provides a direct contact with numerical simulations of\naccretion onto black holes, which exhibit an intense reconnection activity\noutside the equatorial plane. Finally, to describe the kinematics of the plasma\nself-consistently, we use the well-known configuration of an equilibrium torus\nwith a purely toroidal magnetic field. For such a torus, we discuss the\nexistence of an ``ergobelt'', \\ie a nontrivial surface penetrating the\nergosphere and acting as a natural a site for the occurrence of reconnection,\nand from where we estimate the energetics of a plasmoid-driven Penrose process.",

We circumvent this barrier by considering a related constant-time\nBrownian circuit model which shares many similarities with constant-depth\nrandom quantum circuits but crucially allows for direct calculations of higher\norder moments of its output distribution. Using mean-field (large-n)\ntechniques, we fully characterize the output distributions of Brownian circuits\nat shallow depths and show that they follow a Porter-Thomas distribution, just\nlike in the case of deep circuits, but with a truncated Hilbert space. The\naccess to higher order moments allows for studying the expected and typical\nLinear Cross-entropy (XEB) benchmark scores achieved by an ideal quantum\ncomputer versus the state-of-the-art classical spoofers for shallow Brownian\ncircuits. We discover that for these circuits, while the quantum computer\ntypically scores within a constant factor of the expected value, the classical\nspoofer suffers from an exponentially larger variance. Numerical evidence\nsuggests that the same phenomenon also occurs in constant-depth discrete random\nquantum circuits, like those defined over the all-to-all architecture. We\nconjecture that the same phenomenon is also true for random brickwork circuits\nin high enough spatial dimension.",

Conventional topological Wigner crystals\ntypically have one electron per unit cell. In this work we propose new types of\ntopological Wigner crystals labeled as QAHC-$z$, with $z$ electrons per unit\ncell. In the pentalayer graphene system, we find parameter regimes where QAHC-2\nand QAHC-3 have lower energy than the conventional QAHC-1 at total filling\n$\\nu=1$ per moir\\'e unit cell. These states all have total Chern number\n$C_\\mathrm{tot}=1$ and are consistent with the QAH effect observed in the\nexperiments. The larger period QAHC states have lower kinetic energy due to the\nunique Mexican-hat dispersion of the pentalayer graphene, which can compensate\nfor the loss in the interaction energy. Unlike QAHC-1, QAHC-2 and QAHC-3 break\nthe moir\\'e translation symmetry and are sharply distinct from a moir\\'e band\ninsulator. We also briefly discuss the competition between integer QAH and\nfractional QAH states at filling $\\nu=2/3$.

In this paper, we compare seven\npublic \"medical\" LLMs and two VLMs against their corresponding base models,\narriving at a different conclusion: all medical VLMs and nearly all medical\nLLMs fail to consistently improve over their base models in the zero-/few-shot\nprompting regime for medical question-answering (QA) tasks. For instance,\nacross the tasks and model pairs we consider in the 3-shot setting, medical\nLLMs only outperform their base models in 12.1% of cases, reach a (statistical)\ntie in 49.8% of cases, and are significantly worse than their base models in\nthe remaining 38.2% of cases.

Here we demonstrate a device which\nreduces the lifetimes of the leakage states in the transmon by three orders of\nmagnitude, while protecting the qubit lifetime and the single-qubit gate\nfidelties. To do this we attach a qubit through an on-chip seventh-order\nChebyshev filter to a cold resistor. The filter is engineered such that the\nleakage transitions are in its passband, while the qubit transition is in its\nstopband. Dissipation through the filter reduces the lifetime of the transmon's\n$f$ state, the lowest energy leakage state, by three orders of magnitude to 33\nns, while simultaneously keeping the qubit lifetime to greater than 100 $\\mu$s.\nEven though the $f$ state is transiently populated during a single qubit gate,\nno negative effect of the filter is detected with errors per gate approaching\n1e-4.

This study\nconcerns a particular class of highly entangled multipartite states, the\nso-called absolutely maximally entangled (AME) states. These are characterized\nby maximal entanglement across all possible bipartitions. In particular we\nanalyze the local unitary equivalence among AME states using invariants. One of\nour main findings is that the existence of special irredundant orthogonal\narrays implies the existence of an infinite number of equivalence classes of\nAME states constructed from these.

While we assume the nominal 16,500\nsquare degree area for SO and S4, we consider multiple survey designs for Roman\nthat overlap with Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST):\nthe 2000 square degree reference survey using four photometric bands, and two\nshallower single-band surveys that cover 10,000 and 18,000 square degree,\nrespectively. We find a ~2x increase in the dark energy figure of merit when\nincluding CMB-S4 data for all Roman survey designs. We further find a strong\nincrease in constraining power for the Roman wide survey scenario cases,\ndespite the reduction in galaxy number density, and the increased systematic\nuncertainties assumed due to the single band coverage.

    "abstract": "Double parton scattering (DPS) corresponds to events where two parton-parton\nscatterings occur in a single hadron-hadron collision. The DPS effects may\narise from the spectator scatterings that are somewhat related to soft QCD\nactivities. In this work, we investigate the DPS effects on the $W$-boson mass\nmeasurements. Especially, our analysis reveals that the DPS events contribute\nadditional missing transverse momenta from spectator scatterings as well as\nrelevant inclusive cross sections, potentially altering the distribution of\ntotal missing transverse momenta. Consequently, the DPS effects have the\npotential to cause an increase in the measured $W$-boson mass by the CDF\ndetector, which helps to understand the deviation of the CDF-II measurements\nfrom other measurements and the predicted value in the Standard Model.",

To this end, we fix\na multipartite entanglement measure and consider two quantities: the\nmultipartite entanglement of assistance (MEA), defined as the entanglement\nmeasure averaged over the post-measurement states and maximized over arbitrary\nmeasurements; and the localizable multipartite entanglement (LME), defined in\nthe same way but restricted to only local single-system measurements. We choose\nthe $n$-tangle, the genuine multipartite entanglement concurrence and the\nconcentratable entanglement (CE) as the underlying seed measure, and discuss\nthe resulting MEA and LME quantities. First, we prove easily computable upper\nand lower bounds on MEA and LME and establish Lipschitz-continuity for the\n$n$-tangle and CE-based LME and MEA. Using these bounds we investigate the\ntypical behavior of entanglement localization by deriving concentration\ninequalities for the MEA evaluated on Haar-random states and performing\nnumerical studies for small tractable system sizes. We then turn our attention\nto protocols that transform graph states. We give a simple criterion based on a\nmatrix equation to decide whether states with a specified $n$-tangle value can\nbe obtained from a given graph state, providing no-go theorems for a broad\nclass of such graph state transformations beyond the usual local Clifford plus\nlocal Pauli measurement framework. We generalize this analysis to weighted\ngraph states and show that our entanglement localization framework certifies\nthe near-optimality of recently discussed local-measurement protocols to\ntransform uniformly weighted line graph states into GHZ states. Finally, we\ndemonstrate how our MEA and LEA quantities can be used to detect phase\ntransitions in transversal field Ising models.",

The existing annotated\ndatasets are limited in scale, resulting in most existing methods overfitting\nto the small datasets and unable to generalize to the motions of the open\ndomain. Some methods attempt to solve the open-vocabulary motion generation\nproblem by aligning to the CLIP space or using the Pretrain-then-Finetuning\nparadigm. However, the current annotated dataset's limited scale only allows\nthem to achieve mapping from sub-text-space to sub-motion-space, instead of\nmapping between full-text-space and full-motion-space (full mapping), which is\nthe key to attaining open-vocabulary motion generation. To this end, this paper\nproposes to leverage the atomic motion (simple body part motions over a short\ntime period) as an intermediate representation, and leverage two orderly\ncoupled steps, i.e., Textual Decomposition and Sub-motion-space Scattering, to\naddress the full mapping problem. For Textual Decomposition, we design a\nfine-grained description conversion algorithm, and combine it with the\ngeneralization ability of a large language model to convert any given motion\ntext into atomic texts. Sub-motion-space Scattering learns the compositional\nprocess from atomic motions to the target motions, to make the learned\nsub-motion-space scattered to form the full-motion-space. For a given motion of\nthe open domain, it transforms the extrapolation into interpolation and thereby\nsignificantly improves generalization. Our network, $DSO$-Net, combines textual\n$d$ecomposition and sub-motion-space $s$cattering to solve the\n$o$pen-vocabulary motion generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our\nDSO-Net achieves significant improvements over the state-of-the-art methods on\nopen-vocabulary motion generation.

    "abstract": "When bright solar-system objects are observed by GHz-THz regime telescopes,\noff-axis signals bounce around locally and re-enter the signal path with a time\ndelay, causing sinusoidal ripples in output spectra. Ripples that are unstable\nover time are challenging to remove. A typical detection limit for planetary\nspectral lines is a fraction of order 0.001 of continuum signal, restricting\nsearches for minor atmospheric trace-gases. Modern wideband spectra of Venus\ndemonstrate a plethora of effects, at three example telescopes spanning nearly\na factor of 50 in frequency. Characterisation of instrumental effects as\nfamilies of pure sine-waves via Fourier-analysis is shown to improve dynamic\nrange by factors of a few. An example upper limit on sulphuric acid vapour in\nthe Venusian mesosphere, from fully-automated data-cleaning of a 3.5 GHz band\ncontaining 10 line components, goes as deep as the best previously-published\nlimit. The most challenging cases are searches for single lines of width\ncomparable to ripple periods. Traditional polynomial-fitting approaches can be\ndeployed to test for false positives, to demonstrate robustness at a level of\nzero 'fake lines' in more than 1000 comparisons. Fourier-based data-cleaning\navoids subjectivity and can be fully automated, and synthetic spectra can be\ninjected before processing to test to what degree signals are lost in cleaning.\nAn ideal robustness strategy is mitigation at the data-acquisition stage, e.g.\nusing slow drifts in target-velocity with respect to the telescope to isolate a\nplanetary line from a quasi-static instrumental ripple pattern.",

Our\nalgorithm auctions the failed trips to active (non-failed) vehicles through\nlocal auctioning, modifying initial routes to handle dynamic vehicle failures\nefficiently.

One way to achieve such a\nmigration is by transforming its star into a stellar engine, and to control its\nmotion in the galaxy. We first provide a brief overview of stellar engines and\nconclude that looking for technosignatures of stellar engines has taken two\nroads: on the observational side, hypervelocity stars have been the target of\nsuch searches, but without good candidates. On the theoretical side, stellar\nengine concepts have been proposed but are poorly linked to observable\ntechnosignatures. Since about half the stars in our galaxy are in binary\nsystems where life might develop too, we introduce a model of a binary stellar\nengine. We propose mechanisms for acceleration, deceleration, steering in the\norbital plane and outside of the orbital plane. We apply the model to candidate\nsystems, spider pulsars, which are binary stars composed of one millisecond\npulsar and a very low-mass companion star that is heavily irradiated by the\npulsar wind. We discuss potential signatures of acceleration, deceleration,\nsteering, as well as maneuvers such as gravitational assists or captures.\n  Keywords: Pulsars: Spiders, Technosignatures, Stellar engine, Interstellar\ntravel",

Our goal is to provide\nquark-matter equations of state (EoS) that can be used for hadron-quark\nhybrid-star constructions. To that end, we mainly focus on the parameters of\nthe quark-matter model. By varying the vector and diquark coupling constants,\nwe analyze their impact on the EoS, the speed of sound, the maximum diquark\ngap, and the mass-radius relation. In almost all configurations, a stable\ncolor-flavor-locked (CFL) phase appears in the core of the maximum-mass\nconfigurations, typically spanning several kilometers in radius. In other\ncases, the star's two-flavor color-superconducting (2SC) branch of the EoS\nbecomes unstable before reaching the CFL transition density. At neutron-star\ndensities, the speed of sound squared reaches up to $c_s^2 \\sim 0.6$ and the\nCFL gap up to $\\Delta\\sim250\\,$MeV. We argue that adding a hadronic EoS at\nlower densities by performing a Maxwell construction does not increase the\nmaximum mass substantially. Thus we use the $2.0 M_{\\odot}$ constraint to\nconstrain the NJL model parameters that are suited for the construction of\nhybrid-star EoS. We construct three examples of the hybrid-star model,\ndemonstrating that there is room for different color-superconducting\ncompositions. The hybrid EoSs obtained in this way can have no 2SC matter or\ndifferent ratios of 2SC and CFL quark matter in the core. We show that early\nhadron-quark transitions are possible that can modify the tidal deformability\nat 1.4 $M_\\odot$. We find that these EoSs are consistent with the imposed\nconstraints from astrophysics and perturbative QCD. They allow for different\nhybrid-star scenarios with a hadronic EoS that is soft at low to intermediate\ndensities ($\\sim 1-3\\, n_{\\text{sat}}$).",

    "abstract": "The performance of the information reconciliation phase is crucial for\nquantum key distribution (QKD). Reverse reconciliation (RR) is typically\npreferred over direct reconciliation (DR) because it yields higher secure key\nrates. However, a significant challenge in continuous-variable (CV) QKD with\ndiscrete modulations (such as QAM) is that Alice lacks soft information about\nthe symbol decisions made by Bob. This limitation restricts error correction to\nhard-decoding methods, with low reconciliation efficiency. This work introduces\na reverse reconciliation softening (RRS) procedure designed for CV-QKD\nscenarios employing discrete modulations. This procedure generates a soft\nmetric that Bob can share with Alice over a public channel, enabling her to\nperform soft-decoding error correction without disclosing any information to a\npotential eavesdropper. After detailing the RRS procedure, we investigate how\nthe mutual information between Alice's and Bob's variables changes when the\nadditional metric is shared. We show numerically that RRS improves the mutual\ninformation with respect to RR with hard decoding, practically achieving the\nsame mutual information as DR with soft decoding. Finally, we test the proposed\nRRS for PAM-4 signalling with a rate 1/2 binary LDPC code and bit-wise decoding\nthrough numerical simulations, obtaining more than 1dB SNR improvement compared\nto hard-decoding RR.",

Specifically, we propose a\nfew-supervised video captioning framework that consists of lexically\nconstrained pseudo-labeling module and keyword-refined captioning module.\nUnlike the random sampling in natural language processing that may cause\ninvalid modifications (\\ie, edit words), the former module guides the model to\nedit words using some actions (\\eg, copy, replace, insert, and delete) by a\npretrained token-level classifier, and then fine-tunes candidate sentences by a\npretrained language model. Meanwhile, the former employs the repetition\npenalized sampling to encourage the model to yield concise pseudo-labeled\nsentences with less repetition, and selects the most relevant sentences upon a\npretrained video-text model. Moreover, to keep semantic consistency between\npseudo-labeled sentences and video content, we develop the transformer-based\nkeyword refiner with the video-keyword gated fusion strategy to emphasize more\non relevant words.

For the\nmulti-class classification task, we find that the NN performs adequately well\nat distinguishing $\\Lambda$CDM, a CDE model with low-redshift coupling, and a\nmodel with high-redshift coupling, with 99\\%, 79\\%, and 84\\% accuracy,\nrespectively.

    "abstract": "The sum-of-squares hierarchy of semidefinite programs has become a common\ntool for algorithm design in theoretical computer science, including problems\nin quantum information. In this work we study a connection between a Hermitian\nversion of the SoS hierarchy, related to the quantum de Finetti theorem, and\ngeometric quantization of compact K\\\"ahler manifolds (such as complex\nprojective space $\\mathbb{C}P^{d}$, the set of all pure states in a $(d +\n1)$-dimensional Hilbert space). We show that previously known HSoS rounding\nalgorithms can be recast as quantizing an objective function to obtain a\nfinite-dimensional matrix, finding its top eigenvector, and then (possibly\nnonconstructively) rounding it by using a version of the Husimi\nquasiprobability distribution. Dually, we recover most known quantum de Finetti\ntheorems by doing the same steps in the reverse order: a quantum state is first\napproximated by its Husimi distribution, and then quantized to obtain a\nseparable state approximating the original one. In cases when there is a\ntransitive group action on the manifold we give some new proofs of existing de\nFinetti theorems, as well as some applications including a new version of\nRenner's exponential de Finetti theorem proven using the Borel--Weil--Bott\ntheorem, and hardness of approximation results and optimal degree-2 integrality\ngaps for the basic SDP relaxation of \\textsc{Quantum Max-$d$-Cut} (for\narbitrary $d$). We also describe how versions of these results can be proven\nwhen there is no transitive group action. In these cases we can deduce some\nerror bounds for the HSoS hierarchy on complex projective varieties which are\nsmooth.",

As these algorithms may require a\nlarge number of demonstrations for each task of interest, they remain\nfundamentally inefficient in complex scenarios, in which finite datasets can\nhardly cover the state space. One of the remaining challenges is thus\nout-of-distribution (OOD) generalisation, i.e. the ability to predict correct\nactions for states with a low likelihood with respect to the state occupancy\ninduced by the dataset. This issue is aggravated when the system to control is\ntreated as a black-box, ignoring its physical properties. This work\ncharacterises widespread properties of robotic manipulation, specifically pose\nequivariance and locality. We investigate the effect of the choice of problem\nspace on OOD performance of BC policies and how transformations arising from\ncharacteristic properties of manipulation could be employed for its\nimprovement.

Current works often assume the causal graph is known, which may not\nalways be available a priori. Motivated by this challenge, we focus on the\ncausal bandit problem in scenarios where the underlying causal graph is unknown\nand may include latent confounders. While intervention on the parents of the\nreward node is optimal in the absence of latent confounders, this is not\nnecessarily the case in general. Instead, one must consider a set of possibly\noptimal arms/interventions, each being a special subset of the ancestors of the\nreward node, making causal discovery beyond the parents of the reward node\nessential. For regret minimization, we identify that discovering the full\ncausal structure is unnecessary; however, no existing work provides the\nnecessary and sufficient components of the causal graph. We formally\ncharacterize the set of necessary and sufficient latent confounders one needs\nto detect or learn to ensure that all possibly optimal arms are identified\ncorrectly. We also propose a randomized algorithm for learning the causal graph\nwith a limited number of samples, providing a sample complexity guarantee for\nany desired confidence level. In the causal bandit setup, we propose a\ntwo-stage approach. In the first stage, we learn the induced subgraph on\nancestors of the reward, along with a necessary and sufficient subset of latent\nconfounders, to construct the set of possibly optimal arms. The regret incurred\nduring this phase scales polynomially with respect to the number of nodes in\nthe causal graph. The second phase involves the application of a standard\nbandit algorithm, such as the UCB algorithm.

The margins were similarly wide in the\nnewer dense designs, but flux trapping probability that rendered the registers\nnonoperational was significantly, by an order of magnitude, higher in the\ndenser circuits and was also very sensitive to the moats' shape and location.\n  Our findings indicate that AQFP circuits are amendable to increasing the\nscale of integration and further densification, but a careful moat design and\noptimization are required to reduce flux trapping effects in the dense AQFP\ncircuits.",

Recent work proposes to address the significant hidden constant factors\narising from a naive implementation of Yannakakis by decomposing the hash join\noperator into two suboperators, called Lookup and Expand. In this paper, we\npresent a novel method for integrating Lookup and Expand plans in interpreted\nenvironments, like column stores, formalizing them using Nested Semijoin\nAlgebra (NSA) and implementing them through a shredding approach. We\ncharacterize the class of NSA expressions that can be evaluated\ninstance-optimally as those that are 2-phase: no `shrinking' operator is\napplied after an unnest (i.e., expand). We introduce Shredded Yannakakis (SYA),\nan evaluation algorithm for acyclic joins that, starting from a binary join\nplan, transforms it into a 2-phase NSA plan, and then evaluates it through the\nshredding technique. We show that SYA is provably robust (i.e., never produces\nlarge intermediate results) and without regret (i.e., is never worse than the\nbinary join plan under a suitable cost model) on the class of well-behaved\nbinary join plans. Our experiments on a suite of 1,849 queries show that SYA\nimproves performance for 85.3% of the queries with speedups up to 62.5x, while\nremaining competitive on the other queries. We hope this approach offers a\nfresh perspective on Yannakakis' algorithm, helping system engineers better\nunderstand its practical benefits and facilitating its adoption into a broader\nspectrum of query engines.",

The most popular parametrizations are based on or inspired by\nan underlying stochastic model, like the Heston model (SVI method) or the SABR\nmodel (SABR parametrization). Their popularity is often driven by a closed-form\nrepresentation enabling efficient calibration. However, these representations\nindirectly impose a model-specific volatility structure on observable market\nquotes. When the market's volatility does not follow the parametric model\nregime, the calibration procedure will fail or lead to extreme parameters,\nindicating inconsistency. This article addresses this critical limitation - we\npropose an arbitrage-free framework for letting the parameters from the\nparametric implied volatility formula be random. The method enhances the\nexisting parametrizations and enables a significant widening of the spectrum of\npermissible shapes of implied volatilities while preserving analyticity and,\ntherefore, computation efficiency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nnovel method on real data from short-term index and equity options, where the\nstandard parametrizations fail to capture market dynamics.

This property is a form of\nthe law of large numbers and lies at the heart of information theory. In this\nwork, we prove a generalized quantum AEP beyond the i.i.d. framework where the\nrandom samples are drawn from two sets of quantum states. In particular, under\nsuitable assumptions on the sets, we prove that all operationally relevant\ndivergences converge to the quantum relative entropy between the sets. More\nspecifically, both the quantum hypothesis testing relative entropy (a smoothed\nform of the min-relative entropy) and the smoothed max-relative entropy\napproach the regularized relative entropy between the sets. Notably, the\nasymptotic limit has explicit convergence guarantees and can be efficiently\nestimated through convex optimization programs, despite the regularization,\nprovided that the sets have efficient descriptions.

First, we analyze the per-layer activations of GPT-2 models in response\nto single- and multi-hop prompts.

We observe that small subsets of attention heads can significantly\nimpact the model prediction during multi-hop reasoning.

In PQCrypto 2023, Bruckner, Ramacher and Striecks proposed a\nnovel hybrid AKE (HAKE) protocol, dubbed Muckle+, that is particularly useful\nin large quantum-safe networks consisting of a large number of nodes. Their\nprotocol is hybrid in the sense that it allows key material from conventional\nand post-quantum primitives, as well as from quantum key distribution, to be\nincorporated into a single end-to-end shared key.\n  To achieve the desired authentication properties, Muckle+ utilizes\npost-quantum digital signatures. However, available instantiations of such\nsignatures schemes are not yet efficient enough compared to their post-quantum\nkey-encapsulation mechanism (KEM) counterparts, particularly in large networks\nwith potentially several connections in a short period of time.\n  To mitigate this gap, we propose Muckle# that pushes the efficiency\nboundaries of currently known HAKE constructions. Muckle# uses post-quantum\nkey-encapsulating mechanisms for implicit authentication inspired by recent\nworks done in the area of Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols,\nparticularly, in KEMTLS (CCS'20).\n  We port those ideas to the HAKE framework and develop novel proof techniques\non the way.

In a two-detector correlation, this residual astrophysical\nbackground then acts as an effective correlated noise. We point out that its\neffect, in the search for a cosmological background, must be evaluated by\ncorrelating two detectors with the filter function that optimizes the given\ncosmological search (and not the search for the astrophysical background\nitself) and therefore depends on the specific cosmological signal that we want\nto extract from the data. We show how to obtain search-independent upper bounds\non the effect of this astrophysical confusion noise, and how to characterize\nits actual effect on a given cosmological search.

A crucial aspect of the modelization\nof the oscillatory part is the complexification of the real modes via a Hilbert\ntransform. This procedure allows for an accurate description of the\nmerger-ringdown waveform by applying standard approaches employed for the\ncomplex $m>0$ modes, which include source-driven effects. The physical signal\nis then recovered by solely considering the real part. We apply this method in\nthe extreme-mass-ratio regime, considering particle-driven linear gravitational\nperturbations in Schwarzschild and Kerr spacetimes. We then extend our\ndescription to spin-aligned, quasi-circular, comparable-mass binaries providing\nhierarchical fits incorporating the test-mass limit. The post-merger waveform\nis then matched with an inspiral effective-one-body waveform. By adopting\nTEOBResumS-GIOTTO as our baseline, we also include the displacement memory in\nthe (2,0) mode through Bondi-Metzner-Sachs balance laws, thus providing a\ncomplete effective-one-body model incorporating both oscillatory and null\nmemory effects.

    "abstract": "Quantum symmetrization is the task of transforming a non-strictly increasing\nlist of $n$ integers into an equal superposition of all permutations of the\nlist (or more generally, performing this operation coherently on a\nsuperposition of such lists). This task plays a key role in initial state\npreparation for first-quantized simulations. Motivated by an application to\nfermionic systems, various algorithms have been proposed to solve a weaker\nversion of symmetrization in which the input list is strictly increasing, but\nthe general symmetrization problem with repetitions in the input list has not\nbeen well studied. We present the first efficient quantum algorithms for the\ngeneral symmetrization problem. If $m$ is the greatest possible value of the\ninput list, our first algorithm symmetrizes any single classical input list\nusing $\\tilde{O}(\\log n)$ depth and $O(n\\log n + \\log m)$ ancilla qubits, and\nour second algorithm symmetrizes an arbitrary superposition of input lists\nusing $\\tilde{O}(\\log^3 n)$ depth and $O(n\\log n)$ ancilla qubits. Our\nalgorithms enable efficient simulation of bosonic quantum systems in first\nquantization and can prepare (superpositions of) Dicke states of any Hamming\nweight in $\\tilde{O}(\\log n)$ depth (respectively, $\\tilde{O}(\\log^3 n)$ depth)\nusing $O(n\\log n)$ ancilla qubits. We also propose an $\\tilde{O}(\\log^3\nn)$-depth quantum algorithm to transform second-quantized states to\nfirst-quantized states. Using this algorithm, QFT-based quantum telescope\narrays can image brighter photon sources, extending quantum interferometric\nimaging systems to a new regime.",

This\ncomplicates maintaining the electrical grid balance, prompting some\ntransmission system operators in Western Europe to implement imbalance tariffs\nthat penalize unsustainable power deviations. These tariffs create an implicit\ndemand response framework to mitigate grid instability. Yet, several challenges\nlimit active participation. In Belgium, for example, imbalance prices are only\ncalculated at the end of each 15-minute settlement period, creating high risk\ndue to price uncertainty. This risk is further amplified by the inherent\nvolatility of imbalance prices, discouraging participation. Although\ntransmission system operators provide minute-based price predictions, the\nsystem imbalance volatility makes accurate price predictions challenging to\nobtain and requires sophisticated techniques. Moreover, publishing price\nestimates can prompt participants to adjust their schedules, potentially\naffecting the system balance and the final price, adding further complexity. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a Monte Carlo Tree Search method that\npublishes accurate imbalance prices while accounting for potential response\nactions. Our approach models the system dynamics using a neural network\nforecaster and a cluster of virtual batteries controlled by reinforcement\nlearning agents. Compared to Belgium's current publication method, our\ntechnique improves price accuracy by 20.4% under ideal conditions and by 12.8%\nin more realistic scenarios.

    "abstract": "Anomaly detection in medical imaging plays a crucial role in identifying\npathological regions across various imaging modalities, such as brain MRI,\nliver CT, and carotid ultrasound (US). However, training fully supervised\nsegmentation models is often hindered by the scarcity of expert annotations and\nthe complexity of diverse anatomical structures. To address these issues, we\npropose a novel unsupervised anomaly detection framework based on a diffusion\nmodel that incorporates a synthetic anomaly (Synomaly) noise function and a\nmulti-stage diffusion process. Synomaly noise introduces synthetic anomalies\ninto healthy images during training, allowing the model to effectively learn\nanomaly removal. The multi-stage diffusion process is introduced to\nprogressively denoise images, preserving fine details while improving the\nquality of anomaly-free reconstructions. The generated high-fidelity\ncounterfactual healthy images can further enhance the interpretability of the\nsegmentation models, as well as provide a reliable baseline for evaluating the\nextent of anomalies and supporting clinical decision-making. Notably, the\nunsupervised anomaly detection model is trained purely on healthy images,\neliminating the need for anomalous training samples and pixel-level\nannotations. We validate the proposed approach on brain MRI, liver CT datasets,\nand carotid US. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed\nframework outperforms existing state-of-the-art unsupervised anomaly detection\nmethods, achieving performance comparable to fully supervised segmentation\nmodels in the US dataset. Ablation studies further highlight the contributions\nof Synomaly noise and the multi-stage diffusion process in improving anomaly\nsegmentation. These findings underscore the potential of our approach as a\nrobust and annotation-efficient alternative for medical anomaly detection.",

    "abstract": "Upholding data privacy especially in medical research has become tantamount\nto facing difficulties in accessing individual-level patient data. Estimating\nmixed effects binary logistic regression models involving data from multiple\ndata providers like hospitals thus becomes more challenging. Federated learning\nhas emerged as an option to preserve the privacy of individual observations\nwhile still estimating a global model that can be interpreted on the individual\nlevel, but it usually involves iterative communication between the data\nproviders and the data analyst. In this paper, we present a strategy to\nestimate a mixed effects binary logistic regression model that requires data\nproviders to share summary statistics only once. It involves generating\npseudo-data whose summary statistics match those of the actual data and using\nthese into the model estimation process instead of the actual unavailable data.\nOur strategy is able to include multiple predictors which can be a combination\nof continuous and categorical variables. Through simulation, we show that our\napproach estimates the true model at least as good as the one which requires\nthe pooled individual observations. An illustrative example using real data is\nprovided.

    "abstract": "The efforts to probe the horizon-scale structure of black holes, such as\nEvent Horizon Telescope and GRAVITY interferometer, might provide valuable\ninsights into the strong-field regime of Einstein's theory of gravity. In the\nnear field region of a black hole, the observational signatures of moving\nhotspots might potentially reveal the mechanism causing the flares, or reflect\nthe spacetime geometries. This paper develops a ray tracing scenario to study\nhigher-order images of moving hotspots in a thin disk around a spherical black\nhole. Our ray-tracing scenario establishes a one-to-one mapping between\nemission locations and observer's sky. It enables us to perform\ninfinite-precision simulations for the images, because the emission sources are\nprojected directly onto the image plane. Furthermore, we show that a source\nlocated anywhere outside the black hole can be repeatedly mapped onto the\nobserver's sky, from primary to higher-order images. We investigate the\nobservational signatures of hotspots, focusing on temporal fluxes and flux\ncentroids from the primary to sixth-order images. The hotspots are considered\nto be moving in circular, escape, and plunging orbits. Our results find that\nthe higher-order images can be categorized into two types. Within each type,\nthe temporal fluxes exhibit a self-similar profile. Furthermore, as the\nhotspots approach the event horizon of a black hole, the fluxes from\nhigher-order images alternately dominate the observed flux, which subsequently\nresult in the flux decaying with time in an oscillatory manner.",

A promising alternative to\ndisentangle these complex patterns is learning sparsely distributed vector\nrepresentations from entire network layers, as the resulting basis vectors\nseemingly encode single identifiable visual patterns consistently. Thus, one\nwould expect the resulting code to align better with human perceivable visual\npatterns, but supporting evidence remains, at best, anecdotal. To fill this\ngap, we conducted three large-scale psychophysics experiments collected from a\npool of 560 participants. Our findings provide (i) strong evidence that\nfeatures obtained from sparse distributed representations are easier to\ninterpret by human observers and (ii) that this effect is more pronounced in\nthe deepest layers of a neural network. Complementary analyses also reveal that\n(iii) features derived from sparse distributed representations contribute more\nto the model's decision.

To bridge these gaps, we propose LEGO-GraphRAG, a modular framework\nthat enables: 1) fine-grained decomposition of the GraphRAG workflow, 2)\nsystematic classification of existing techniques and implemented GraphRAG\ninstances, and 3) creation of new GraphRAG instances. Our framework facilitates\ncomprehensive empirical studies of GraphRAG on large-scale real-world graphs\nand diverse query sets, revealing insights into balancing reasoning quality,\nruntime efficiency, and token or GPU cost, that are essential for building\nadvanced GraphRAG systems.",

    "abstract": "Accurately estimating spatiotemporal traffic states on freeways is a\nsignificant challenge due to limited sensor deployment and potential data\ncorruption. In this study, we propose an efficient and robust low-rank model\nfor precise spatiotemporal traffic speed state estimation (TSE) using\nlowpenetration vehicle trajectory data. Leveraging traffic wave priors, an\noblique grid-based matrix is first designed to transform the inherent\ndependencies of spatiotemporal traffic states into the algebraic low-rankness\nof a matrix. Then, with the enhanced traffic state low-rankness in the oblique\nmatrix, a low-rank matrix completion method is tailored to explicitly capture\nspatiotemporal traffic propagation characteristics and precisely reconstruct\ntraffic states. In addition, an anomaly-tolerant module based on a sparse\nmatrix is developed to accommodate corrupted data input and thereby improve the\nTSE model robustness. Notably, driven by the understanding of traffic waves,\nthe computational complexity of the proposed efficient method is only\ncorrelated with the problem size itself, not with dataset size and\nhyperparameter selection prevalent in existing studies. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate the effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency of the proposed\nmodel. The performance of the proposed method achieves up to a 12% improvement\nin Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) in the TSE scenarios and an 18% improvement\nin RMSE in the robust TSE scenarios, and it runs more than 20 times faster than\nthe state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.",

To address this issue\nwhile tackling the challenge of segmenting tiny objects, recent studies have\nexplored local-global fusion methods. These methods preserve fine details using\nlocal regions and capture long-range context information from downscaled global\nimages. However, the necessity of multiple forward passes inevitably incurs\nsignificant computational overhead, adversely affecting inference speed. In\nthis paper, we propose HRDecoder, a simple High-Resolution Decoder network for\nfundus lesion segmentation. It integrates a high-resolution representation\nlearning module to capture fine-grained local features and a high-resolution\nfusion module to fuse multi-scale predictions. Our method effectively improves\nthe overall segmentation accuracy of fundus lesions while consuming reasonable\nmemory and computational overhead, and maintaining satisfying inference speed.\nExperimental results on the IDRiD and DDR datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method.

    "abstract": "Many living systems, such as birds and fish, exhibit collective behaviors\nlike flocking and swarming. Recently, an experimental system of active\ncolloidal particles has been developed, where the motility of each particle is\nadjusted based on its visual detection of surrounding particles. These\nparticles with visual-perception-dependent motility exhibit group formation and\ncohesion. Inspired by these behaviors, we investigate intelligent active\nBrownian particles (iABPs) equipped with visual perception and velocity\nalignment in three dimensions using computer simulations. The\nvisual-perception-based self-steering describes the tendency of iABPs to move\ntoward the center of mass of particles within their visual cones, while\nvelocity alignment encourages alignment with neighboring particles. We examine\nhow the behavior varies with the visual cone angle theta, self-propulsion speed\n(Peclet number Pe), and the interaction strengths of velocity alignment\n(Omega_a) and visual-based self-steering (Omega_v). Our findings show that\nspherical iABPs form clusters, worm-like clusters, milling behaviors, and\ndilute-gas phases, consistent with 2D studies. By reducing the simulation box\nsize, we observe additional structures like band-like clusters and dense\nbaitball formations. Additionally, rod-like iABPs form band-like, worm-like,\nradiating, and helical structures, while iABP worms exhibit streamlined and\nblob-like structures. Many of these patterns resemble collective behaviors in\nnature, such as ant milling, fish baitballs, and worm clusters.

    "abstract": "Quantum resources like entanglement and magic are essential for\ncharacterizing the complexity of quantum states. However, when the number of\ncopies of quantum states and the computational time are limited by numbers\npolynomial in the system size $n$, accurate estimation of the amount of these\nresources becomes difficult. This makes it impossible to distinguish between\nensembles of states with relatively small resources and one that has nearly\nmaximal resources. Such ensembles with small resources are referred to as\n\"pseudo-quantum\" ensembles. Recent studies have introduced an ensemble known as\nthe random subset phase state ensemble, which is pseudo-entangled,\npseudo-magical, and pseudorandom. While the current state-of-the-art\nimplementation of this ensemble is conjectured to be realized by a circuit with\n$O(nt)$ depth, it is still too deep for near-term quantum devices to execute\nfor small $t$. In addition, the strict linear dependence on $t$ has only been\nestablished as a lower bound on the circuit depth. In this work, we present\nsignificantly improved implementations that only require $\\omega(\\log n)\\cdot\nO(t[\\log t]^2)$ depth circuits, which almost saturates the theoretical lower\nbound. This is also the fastest known for generating pseudorandom states to the\nbest of our knowledge. We believe that our findings will facilitate the\nimplementation of pseudo-ensembles on near-term devices, allowing executions of\ntasks that would otherwise require ensembles with maximal quantum resources, by\ngenerating pseudo-ensembles at a super-polynomially fewer number of entangling\nand non-Clifford gates.",

These networks typically emerge\nfrom the interaction of many entities, which is why researchers study\nagent-based models of network formation. While traditionally static networks\nwith a fixed set of links were considered, a recent stream of works focuses on\nnetworks whose behavior may change over time. In particular, Bil\\`o et al.\n(IJCAI 2023) recently introduced a game-theoretic network formation model that\nembeds temporal aspects in networks. More precisely, a network is formed by\nselfish agents corresponding to nodes in a given host network with edges having\nlabels denoting their availability over time. Each agent strategically selects\nlocal, i.e., incident, edges to ensure temporal reachability towards everyone\nat low cost.\n  In this work we set out to explore the impact of two novel conceptual\nfeatures: agents are no longer restricted to creating incident edges, called\nthe global setting, and agents might only want to ensure that they can reach a\nsubset of the other nodes, called the terminal model. For both, we study the\nexistence, structure, and quality of equilibrium networks. For the terminal\nmodel, we prove that many core properties crucially depend on the number of\nterminals. We also develop a novel tool that allows translating equilibrium\nconstructions from the non-terminal model to the terminal model. For the global\nsetting, we show the surprising result that equilibria in the global and the\nlocal model are incomparable and we establish a high lower bound on the Price\nof Anarchy of the global setting that matches the upper bound of the local\nmodel. This shows the counter-intuitive fact that allowing agents more\nflexibility in edge creation does not improve the quality of equilibrium\nnetworks.",

    "abstract": "The dynamics of droplet collisions in microchannels are inherently complex,\ngoverned by multiple interdependent physical and geometric factors.\nUnderstanding and predicting the outcomes of these collisions-whether\ncoalescence, reverse-back, or pass-over-pose significant challenges,\nparticularly due to the deformability of droplets and the influence of key\nparameters such as viscosity ratios, density ratios, confinement, and initial\noffset of droplets. Traditional methods for analyzing these collisions,\nincluding computational simulations and experimental techniques, are\ntime-consuming and resource-intensive, limiting their scalability for real-time\napplications. In this work, we explore a novel data-driven approach to predict\ndroplet collision outcomes using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The\nCNN-based approach presents a significant advantage over traditional methods,\noffering faster, scalable solutions for analyzing large datasets with varying\nphysical parameters. Using a lattice Boltzmann method based on Cahn-Hilliard\ndiffuse interface theory for binary immiscible fluids, we numerically generated\ndroplet collision data under confined shear flow. This data, represented as\ndroplet shapes, serves as input to the CNN model, which automatically learns\nhierarchical features from the images, allowing for accurate and efficient\ncollision outcome predictions based on deformation and orientation. The model\nachieves a prediction accuracy of 0.972, even on test datasets with varied\ndensity and viscosity ratios not included in training. Our findings suggest\nthat the CNN-based models offer improved accuracy in predicting collision\noutcomes while drastically reducing computational and time constraints.

    "abstract": "The classical text preprocessing pipeline, comprising Tokenisation,\nNormalisation, Stop Words Removal, and Stemming/Lemmatisation, has been\nimplemented in many systems for syntactic ontology matching (OM). However, the\nlack of standardisation in text preprocessing creates diversity in mapping\nresults. In this paper, we investigate the effect of the text preprocessing\npipeline on syntactic OM in 8 Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI)\ntracks with 49 distinct alignments. We find that Phase 1 text preprocessing\n(Tokenisation and Normalisation) is more effective than Phase 2 text\npreprocessing (Stop Words Removal and Stemming/Lemmatisation). We propose two\nnovel approaches to repair unwanted false mappings caused by Phase 2 text\npreprocessing. One is an ad hoc logic-based repair approach that employs an\nontology-specific check to find common words that cause false mappings. These\nwords are stored in a reserved word set and applied before the text\npreprocessing. By leveraging the power of large language models (LLMs), we also\npropose a post hoc LLM-based repair approach. This approach utilises the strong\nbackground knowledge provided by LLMs to repair non-existent and\ncounter-intuitive false mappings after the text preprocessing. It also\novercomes the tendency towards unstable true mappings by injecting the\nclassical text preprocessing pipeline via function calling. The experimental\nresults show that these two approaches can improve the matching correctness and\nthe overall matching performance.",

The transverse stress tensor is regularized\nto the 0th adiabatic order, the longitudinal, temporal, and GF stress tensors\nare regularized to the 2nd adiabatic order. The resulting total regularized\nvacuum stress tensor is convergent and maximally-symmetric, has a positive\nenergy density, and respects the covariant conservation, and thus can be\nidentified as the cosmological constant that drives the de Sitter inflation.\nUnder the Lorenz condition $A^\\mu\\,_{;\\, \\mu}=0$, the regularized Stueckelberg\nstress tensor reduces to the regularized Proca stress tensor that contains only\nthe transverse and longitudinal modes.

This work offers a non-balanced semi-supervised\nSAR target recognition approach using dynamic energy scores and adaptive loss.\nFirst, an energy score-based method is developed to dynamically select\nunlabeled samples near to the training distribution as pseudo-labels during\ntraining, assuring pseudo-label reliability in long-tailed distribution\ncircumstances.

The derivation with vertex effects included in the\nself-energy results in a number of terms beyond GW such as second-order\nscreened exchange (the term that also gives rise to vertex/excitonic effects in\nthe polarisation) and an infinite series describing correlations between the\nadded-particle(removed-hole) and the excited electrons and holes: the screened\nT-matrix channels. Two-body correlated propagation is considered, with the\nthird propagating freely, however, 3-body correlations are discussed and these\ncan be added hierarchically to the method. For electron-hole propagation the\nreducible polarisation is calculated, which results in an expression for the\nself-energy that can be solved analytically without the need for widely used\nexpensive numerical methods for frequency integration or having to adopt the\nplasmon-pole approximation. The method requires diagonalisation of the usual\nparticle-hole matrix - derived from the Bethe-Salpter equation - and also a\nparticle-particle and hole-hole matrix that has a similar structure; with the\nsecond-order exchange present in all channels. The method goes beyond current\nwidely used methods that adopt the GW approximation, whilst being abinitio in\nnature and requiring relatively modest extensions to existing functionality,\ne.g., it could be implemented in the sophisticated quasiparticle\nself-consistent framework.

To benchmark and identify the\nfundamental nature of optical network topologies through the lens of\ngraph-theoretical analysis, we analyse both real and synthetic networks using\nstructural, spatial and spectral metrics. Our comparative analysis identifies\nconstraints in real optical network diversity and illustrates how synthetic\nnetworks can complement and expand the range of topologies available for use.\nCurrently, topologies are selected based on subjective criteria, such as\npreference, data availability, or perceived suitability, leading to potential\nbiases and limited representativeness. Our framework enhances the\ngeneralisability of optical network research by providing a more objective and\nsystematic approach to topology selection. A statistical and correlation\nanalysis reveals the quantitative range of all of these graph metrics and the\nrelationships between them. Finally, we apply unsupervised machine learning to\ncluster real-world topologies into distinctive groups using nine optimal graph\nmetrics using K-means. We conclude the analysis by providing guidance on how to\nuse such clusters to select a diverse set of topologies for future studies.",

    "abstract": "We set up an effective field theory formulation for the renormalization flow\nof matrix product states (MPS) with finite bond dimension, focusing on systems\nexhibiting finite-entanglement scaling close to a conformally invariant\ncritical fixed point. We show that the finite MPS bond dimension $\\chi$ is\nequivalent to introducing a perturbation by a relevant operator to the\nfixed-point Hamiltonian. The fingerprint of this mechanism is encoded in the\n$\\chi$-independent universal transfer matrix's gap ratios, which are distinct\nfrom those predicted by the unperturbed Conformal Field Theory. This phenomenon\ndefines a renormalization group self-congruent point, where the relevant\ncoupling constant ceases to flow due to a balance of two effects; When\nincreasing $\\chi$, the infrared scale, set by the correlation length\n$\\xi(\\chi)$, increases, while the strength of the perturbation at the lattice\nscale decreases. The presence of a self-congruent point does not alter the\nvalidity of the finite-entanglement scaling hypothesis, since the\nself-congruent point is located at a finite distance from the critical fixed\npoint, well inside the scaling regime of the CFT. We corroborate this framework\nwith numerical evidences from the exact solution of the Ising model and density\nmatrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations of an effective lattice model.",

We\nsystematically investigate five configurations: (1) channel attention, (2)\nspatial attention, (3) sequential channel followed by spatial attention, (4)\nspatial attention followed by channel attention and (5) parallel channel and\nspatial attention. Our experiments show that adding attention mechanisms\nimproves the ability to embed hidden information while maintaining the visual\nquality of the images. The increase in the PSNR and SSIM scores shows that\nusing a parallel combination of channel and spatial attention improves image\nquality and hiding capacity simultaneously.

Missingness in EHRs\noccurs naturally as a result of the data recording practices during routine\nclinical care, but handling it is crucial to the precision of medical analysis\nand the decision-making that follows. The literature contains a variety of\nimputation methodologies based on deep neural networks. Those aim to overcome\nthe dynamic, heterogeneous and multivariate missingness patterns of EHRs, which\ncannot be handled by classical and statistical imputation methods. However, all\nexisting deep imputation methods rely on end-to-end pipelines that incorporate\nboth imputation and downstream analyses, e.g. classification. This coupling\nmakes it difficult to assess the quality of imputation and takes away the\nflexibility of re-using the imputer for a different task. Furthermore, most\nend-to-end deep architectures tend to use complex networks to perform the\ndownstream task, in addition to the already sophisticated deep imputation\nnetwork. We, therefore ask if the high performance reported in the literature\nis due to the imputer or the classifier and further ask if an optimised\nstate-of-the-art imputer is used, a simpler classifier can achieve comparable\nperformance. This paper explores the development of a modular, deep\nlearning-based imputation and classification pipeline, specifically built to\nleverage the capabilities of state-of-the-art imputation models for downstream\nclassification tasks. Such a modular approach enables a) objective assessment\nof the quality of the imputer and classifier independently, and b) enables the\nexploration of the performance of simpler classification architectures using an\noptimised imputer.",

    "abstract": "Collective modes are coherent excitations in Bose-Einstein condensates\n(BECs), and their study provides insight into the macroscopic quantum phenomena\nthat govern these systems. Collective mode frequencies can be used to probe the\nproperties of BECs, such as the trap geometry, the interatomic interactions,\nand the presence of defects; hence, it is essential to develop methods for\nhigh-resolution determination of collective mode frequencies. A standard\ntechnique consists of a single pulse of an external oscillatory field, which we\ndenote Rabi-like due to the analogy with the field of nuclear magnetic\nresonances. In this work, we propose a method to achieve a better resolution\nthan the Rabi-like protocol, which consists of two oscillating fields separated\nin time, which we call Ramsey-like. We focus on BECs in harmonic traps,\nconsidering mainly the quadrupole and breathing modes for different trap\nanisotropy values and comparing the results using single and double excitation\nzones. First, we employ a variational approach with a Thomas-Fermi ansatz,\nwhich gives rise to dynamical equations that are numerically solved. Then, we\nmodeled the problem as a three-level system, offering a concise and alternative\ndescription of the same dynamics, enabling the idea of coherent control of\nthese collective modes. Both approaches show that the Ramsey-like protocol\nprovides a better resolution than the Rabi-like. This offers the possibility of\nmeasuring collective mode frequencies with higher precision, which is important\nin experiments where they are used as indirect measurements of properties that\nare difficult to probe.",

While it is in principle known that the\nHartree-Fock (HF) limit of the DFT+DMFT approach should recover DFT+$U$,\ndemonstrating this equivalence in practice is challenging, due to the very\ndifferent ways in which the two approaches are generally implemented. In this\nwork, we introduce a way to perform DFT+$U$ calculations in Quantum ESPRESSO\nusing Wannier functions as calculated by Wannier90, which allows us to use the\nsame Hubbard projector functions both in DFT+$U$ and in DFT+DMFT.

Typically, individual substructures, such as layers\nor blocks of layers, are quantized with the objective of minimizing\nquantization errors in their pre-activations by fine-tuning the corresponding\nweights. Deriving this local objective from the global objective of minimizing\ntask loss involves two key simplifications: assuming substructures are mutually\nindependent and ignoring the knowledge of subsequent substructures as well as\nthe task loss. In this work, we assess the effects of these simplifications on\nweight-only quantization of large language models. We introduce two multi-block\nfine-tuning strategies and compare them against the baseline of fine-tuning\nsingle transformer blocks. The first captures correlations of weights across\nblocks by jointly optimizing multiple quantized blocks. The second incorporates\nknowledge of subsequent blocks by minimizing the error in downstream\npre-activations rather than focusing solely on the quantized block.

In this model, multiple attackers control different\nclients, embedding various triggers and targeting different classes,\ncollaboratively implanting backdoors into the global model via central\naggregation. Empirical validation shows that existing methods struggle to\nmaintain the effectiveness of multiple backdoors in the global model.

To solve this, we propose a Distributed\nMulti-Target Backdoor Attack (DMBA), ensuring efficiency and persistence of\nbackdoors from different malicious clients.

    "abstract": "Hampering the interpretation of benchmark scores, evaluation data\ncontamination has become a growing concern in the evaluation of LLMs, and an\nactive area of research studies its effects. While evaluation data\ncontamination is easily understood intuitively, it is surprisingly difficult to\ndefine precisely which samples should be considered contaminated and,\nconsequently, how it impacts benchmark scores. We propose that these questions\nshould be addressed together and that contamination metrics can be assessed\nbased on whether models benefit from the examples they mark contaminated. We\npropose a novel analysis method called ConTAM, and show with a large scale\nsurvey of existing and novel n-gram based contamination metrics across 13\nbenchmarks and 7 models from 2 different families that ConTAM can be used to\nbetter understand evaluation data contamination and its effects. We find that\ncontamination may have a much larger effect than reported in recent LLM\nreleases and benefits models differently at different scales. We also find that\nconsidering only the longest contaminated substring provides a better signal\nthan considering a union of all contaminated substrings, and that doing model\nand benchmark specific threshold analysis greatly increases the specificity of\nthe results. Lastly, we investigate the impact of hyperparameter choices,\nfinding that, among other things, both using larger values of n and\ndisregarding matches that are infrequent in the pre-training data lead to many\nfalse negatives. With ConTAM, we provide a method to empirically ground\nevaluation data contamination metrics in downstream effects. With our\nexploration, we shed light on how evaluation data contamination can impact LLMs\nand provide insight into the considerations important when doing contamination\nanalysis. We end our paper by discussing these in more detail and providing\nconcrete suggestions for future work.",

On the other hand, film lifetime displays a\nstrong dependence on humidity, with more than a tenfold increase between low\nand high humidities: from a few seconds to tens of minutes. Mixing the air\nsurrounding the film also has a very important effect on lifetime, modifying\nits distribution and reducing the mean lifetime of the film.

One solution to the imaging of large areas lies in\nthe development of novel computational imaging systems that can overcome the\nlimitations imposed by hardware, relying instead on numerical processing power.\nThe single-pixel detector, depending on the application, may offer a\ncompetitive edge over conventional cameras (being a cheaper alternative to the\nmulti-pixelated solutions). In addition, the single-pixel detector can be used\nto achieve improved detection efficiency, faster timing response, and good\nspatial resolution with low radiation dose. Moreover, this technique enables\ndetectors to image through diffuse mediums, increasing the image quality at\nsignificant depths, solving the depth penetration issues of other imaging\nmethods.

We argue in this paper that lexicalization, that is\nexplicit knowledge about the potential interpretations of a word with respect\nto the given vocabulary, significantly eases the task and increases the\nperformance of QA systems. Towards this goal, we present a compositional QA\nsystem that can leverage explicit lexical knowledge in a compositional manner\nto infer the meaning of a question in terms of a SPARQL query. We show that\nsuch a system, given lexical knowledge, has a performance well beyond current\nQA systems, achieving up to a $35.8\\%$ increase in the micro $F_1$ score\ncompared to the best QA system on QALD-9. This shows the importance and\npotential of including explicit lexical knowledge. In contrast, we show that\nLLMs have limited abilities to exploit lexical knowledge, with only marginal\nimprovements compared to a version without lexical knowledge. This shows that\nLLMs have no ability to compositionally interpret a question on the basis of\nthe meaning of its parts, a key feature of compositional approaches.

In this paper, we develop quantitative methods to study\ngender depiction in the non-religious works (comedias) of Pedro Calder\\'on de\nla Barca, a prolific Spanish 17th century author. We gather insights from a\ncorpus of more than 100 plays by using a gender classifier and applying model\nexplainability (attribution) methods to determine which text features are most\ninfluential in the model's decision to classify speech as 'male' or 'female',\nindicating the most gendered elements of dialogue in Calder\\'on's comedias in a\nhuman accessible manner. We find that female and male characters are portrayed\ndifferently and can be identified by the gender prediction model at practically\nuseful accuracies (up to f=0.83). Analysis reveals semantic aspects of gender\nportrayal, and demonstrates that the model is even useful in providing a\nrelatively accurate scene-by-scene prediction of cross-dressing characters.",

    "abstract": "High transaction fees on Ethereum have long hindered its scalability and user\nadoption. The recent Ethereum EIP-4844 upgrade aims to alleviate the\nscalability issue by introducing the blob, a new data structure for Layer-2\nrollups. Instead of using expensive blockchain storage, blobs provide a\ncheaper, separate data layer with its own fee market, which drastically lowers\ndata availability costs. This change, while lowering transaction costs, has\ncreated a new high-stakes economic game for block builders and rollups.\nHowever, the dynamics of this game remain poorly understood. In this paper, we\nconduct the first large-scale empirical analysis of the post-EIP-4844\necosystem, leveraging a dataset of 319.5 million transactions, including 1.3\nmillion blob-carrying type-3 transactions. Our analysis demonstrates clear\nevidence of a structural shift towards the utilization of cheap blobs over\nexpensive transactions for Layer-2 data posting: while average block size grew\n2.5 times, the space consumed by expensive transactions in the public mempool\nshrank from over 150 KB to just 30 KB. Yet, this scalability success masks\nwidespread economic inefficiencies on both sides of the market. On the builder\nside, 29.48% of blocks containing blobs are constructed sub-optimally, earning\nless revenue than that could be achieved otherwise. On the rollup side, we\nidentify that flawed submission strategies have led to $186.92$ ETH in direct\nlosses and average inclusion delays of over 19 seconds. Moving beyond\ncharacterization, our work offers actionable solutions. For builders, we\ndevelop an optimal pricing model derived from a formal first-price auction\nframework, allowing builders to make provably profitable inclusion decisions.\nFor rollups, we prove that batching multiple blobs into a single transaction is\na dominant, utility-maximizing strategy.",

This\nstudy investigates the induced flow dynamics, characterized by a turbulent and\ncomplex wake that significantly affects the aerodynamic forces and moments\nexperienced by the following motorcycle. The presence of aerodynamic appendices\non the leading motorcycle intensifies these effects, generating coherent\nwingtip vortices that propagate downstream-a typical behavior of\nlift-generating devices. In this work, numerical simulations reveal that the\naerodynamic consequences vary with the relative positioning of the pursuing\nmotorcycle. A lateral offset can reduce wheelie tendencies due to beneficial\nflow interactions, while lateral alignment and longitudinal positioning\nvariation may exacerbate negative aerodynamic impacts, compromising stability.\nContrary to initial expectations, the simulations in this work demonstrate that\nthe turbulent wake and the coherent vortex pair influence the pursuing\nmotorcycle's behavior independently, persisting across all tested relative\ndistances. While the turbulent wake usually creates a low-pressure region that\nfacilitates drafting, the presence of coherent vortices reduces this advantage\nby introducing additional lift through the upwash velocity component.\nConversely, specific lateral deviations can lessen wheelie effects, with\ndownwash becoming the dominant flow component.

    "abstract": "We present qubit logic on qudits (QLOQ), a compression scheme in which the\nqubits from a hardware agnostic circuit are divided into groups of various\nsizes, and each group is mapped to a physical qudit for computation. QLOQ\ncircuits have qubit-logic inputs, outputs, and gates, making them compatible\nwith existing qubit-based algorithms and Hamiltonians. We show that arbitrary\nqubit-logic unitaries can in principle be implemented with significantly fewer\ntwo-level (qubit) physical entangling gates in QLOQ than in qubit encoding. We\nachieve this advantage in practice for two applications: variational quantum\nalgorithms, and unitary decomposition. The variational quantum eigensolver\n(VQE) for LiH took 5 hours using QLOQ on one of Quandela's cloud-accessible\nphotonic quantum computers, whereas it would have taken 4.39 years in qubit\nencoding. We also provide a QLOQ version of the Quantum Shannon Decomposition,\nwhich not only outperforms previous qudit-based proposals, but also beats the\ntheoretical lower bound on the CNOT cost of unitary decomposition in qubit\nencoding.",

    "abstract": "Answering reasoning-based complex questions over text and hybrid sources,\nincluding tables, is a challenging task. Recent advances in large language\nmodels (LLMs) have enabled in-context learning (ICL), allowing LLMs to acquire\nproficiency in a specific task using only a few demonstration samples\n(exemplars). A critical challenge in ICL is the selection of optimal exemplars,\nwhich can be either task-specific (static) or test-example-specific (dynamic).\nStatic exemplars provide faster inference times and increased robustness across\na distribution of test examples. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for\nstatic exemplar subset selection for complex reasoning tasks. We introduce\nEXPLORA, a novel exploration method designed to estimate the parameters of the\nscoring function, which evaluates exemplar subsets without incorporating\nconfidence information. EXPLORA significantly reduces the number of LLM calls\nto ~11% of those required by state-of-the-art methods and achieves a\nsubstantial performance improvement of 12.24%.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel controller design approach for unknown\nnonlinear systems using the Koopman operator. In particular, we use the\nrecently proposed stability- and certificate-oriented extended dynamic mode\ndecomposition (SafEDMD) architecture to generate a data-driven bilinear\nsurrogate model with certified error bounds. Then, by accounting for the\nobtained error bounds in a controller design based on the bilinear system, one\ncan guarantee closed-loop stability for the true nonlinear system. While\nexisting approaches over-approximate the bilinearity of the surrogate model,\nthus introducing conservatism and providing only local guarantees, we\nexplicitly account for the bilinearity by using sum-of-squares (SOS)\noptimization in the controller design. More precisely, we parametrize a\nrational controller stabilizing the error-affected bilinear surrogate model\nand, consequently, the underlying nonlinear system. The resulting SOS\noptimization problem provides explicit data-driven controller design conditions\nfor unknown nonlinear systems based on semidefinite programming. Our approach\nsignificantly reduces conservatism by establishing a larger region of\nattraction and improved data efficiency. The proposed method is evaluated using\nnumerical examples, demonstrating its advantages over existing approaches.",

These pinned particles can move affinely under the\nimposed oscillatory shear deformation but are not allowed to relax through\nsubsequent rearrangements due to plastic events. As the fraction of pinned\nparticles increases, the system transitions from being a fragile glass former\nto a strong glass former.

Our results demonstrate notable\ndifferences in the yielding transition between strong and fragile glass formers\nunder random pinning.

    "abstract": "A path-covering problem on a directed acyclic graph (DAG) requires finding a\nset of source-to-sink paths that cover all the nodes, all the arcs, or subsets\nthereof, and additionally they are optimal with respect to some function. In\nthis paper we study safe sequences of nodes or arcs, namely sequences that\nappear in some path of every path cover of a DAG.\n  We show that safe sequences admit a simple characterization via cutnodes.\nMoreover, we establish a connection between maximal safe sequences and\nleaf-to-root paths in the source- and sink-dominator trees of the DAG, which\nmay be of independent interest in the extensive literature on dominators. With\ndominator trees, safe sequences admit an O(n)-size representation and a\nlinear-time output-sensitive enumeration algorithm running in time O(m + o),\nwhere n and m are the number of nodes and arcs, respectively, and o is the\ntotal length of the maximal safe sequences.\n  We then apply maximal safe sequences to simplify Integer Linear Programs\n(ILPs) for two path-covering problems, LeastSquares and MinPathError, which are\nat the core of RNA transcript assembly problems from bioinformatics. On various\ndatasets, maximal safe sequences can be computed in under 0.1 seconds per\ngraph, on average, and ILP solvers whose search space is reduced in this manner\nexhibit significant speed-ups. For example on graphs with a large width,\naverage speed-ups are in the range 50-250x for MinPathError and in the range\n80-350x for LeastSquares.

The median 5-sigma sensitivity is 28 microJy\nbeam per beam, reaching as low as 19 microJy per beam, with a synthesised beam\nof 3.6 x 4.1 arcsec. The catalogue contains 1675 radio components, with 339\ngrouped into multi-component sources and 284 isolated components likely part of\ndouble radio sources. Imaging, cataloguing, and source identification are\npresented, along with preliminary scientific results. From a non-statistical\nsub-set of 169 objects with multi-wavelength AKARI and other detections,\nluminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs) represent 66 percent of the sample,\nultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) 4 percent, and sources with L_IR <\n1011 L_sun 30 percent. In total, 56 percent of sources show some AGN presence,\nthough only seven are AGN-dominated. ULIRGs require three times higher AGN\ncontribution to produce high-quality SED fits compared to lower luminosity\ngalaxies, and AGN presence increases with AGN fraction. The PAH mass fraction\nis insignificant, although ULIRGs have about half the PAH strength of lower\nIR-luminosity galaxies. Higher luminosity galaxies show gas and stellar masses\nan order of magnitude larger, suggesting higher star formation rates. For\nLIRGs, AGN presence increases with redshift, indicating that part of the total\nluminosity could be contributed by AGN activity rather than star formation.\nSimple cross-matching revealed 13 ROSAT QSOs, 45 X-ray sources, and 61 sub-mm\ngalaxies coincident with GMRT radio sources.",

We used images of 148 transitions from 44 different\nspecies of the ALMA large program ALCHEMI. Additionally, we included the\ncontinuum images at ALMA Bands 3 and 7 from the same dataset. For the five NMF\ncomponents (NF1--5), we obtained that their distributions correspond to various\nbasic phenomena related to star formation: i) low-density gas extended through\nthe galactic central molecular zone (NF2), ii) shocks (NF3), iii) starburst\nregions (NF4), and iv) young star-forming regions (NF5). The other component\n(NF1) is related to excitation; three components obtained by NMF (NF3, 1, and\n5) show a strong dependence upon the upper state energies of transitions, and\nrepresent low-, intermediate-, and high-excitation, respectively. We also\ncompared our results using principal component analysis (PCA) previously\napplied to the same dataset. Molecular components extracted from NMF are\nsimilar to the ones obtained from PCA. However, NMF is better at extracting\ncomponents associated with a single physical component, while a single\ncomponent in PCA usually contains information on multiple physical components.\nThis is especially true for features with weak intensities like emission from\noutflows.

We consider the\ndecision-making problem in multi-agent settings, where tasks are further\ninfluenced by social connections, affecting rewards and information access.\nHowever, existing multi-agent environments lack a combination of adaptive\nphysical surroundings and social connections, hindering the learning of\nintelligent behaviors. To address this, we introduce AdaSociety, a customizable\nmulti-agent environment featuring expanding state and action spaces, alongside\nexplicit and alterable social structures. As agents progress, the environment\nadaptively generates new tasks with social structures for agents to undertake.\nIn AdaSociety, we develop three mini-games showcasing distinct social\nstructures and tasks. Initial results demonstrate that specific social\nstructures can promote both individual and collective benefits, though current\nreinforcement learning and LLM-based algorithms show limited effectiveness in\nleveraging social structures to enhance performance. Overall, AdaSociety serves\nas a valuable research platform for exploring intelligence in diverse physical\nand social settings. The code is available at\nhttps://github.com/bigai-ai/AdaSociety.",

While many existing Byzantine robust aggregators\nprovide theoretical convergence guarantees and are empirically effective\nagainst certain categories of attacks, we observe that certain high-strength\nattacks can subvert the robust aggregator and collapse the training. To\novercome this limitation, we propose a method called FedSECA for robust Sign\nElection and Coordinate-wise Aggregation of gradients in FL that is less\nsusceptible to malicious updates by an omniscient attacker. The proposed method\nhas two main components. The Concordance Ratio Induced Sign Election(CRISE)\nmodule determines the consensus direction (elected sign) for each individual\nparameter gradient through a weighted voting strategy. The client weights are\nassigned based on a novel metric called concordance ratio, which quantifies the\ndegree of sign agreement between the client gradient updates. Based on the\nelected sign, a Robust Coordinate-wise Aggregation(RoCA) strategy is employed,\nwhere variance-reduced sparse gradients are aggregated only if they are in\nalignment with the corresponding elected sign. We compare our proposed FedSECA\nmethod against 10 robust aggregators under 7 Byzantine attacks on 3 datasets\nand architectures.

Moreover, the framework\nprovides a systematic approach for optimizing the sensing protocol. In\ncontrast, the paradigm of global sensing aims to find a precision bound for\nparameter estimation in the absence of such prior information. In recent years,\nvigorous research has been pursued to describe the contours of global quantum\nestimation. Here, we review some of these emerging developments. These\ndevelopments are both in the realm of finding ultimate precision bounds with\nrespect to appropriate figures of merit in the global sensing paradigm, as well\nas in the search for algorithms that achieve these bounds. We categorize these\ndevelopments into two largely mutually exclusive camps; one employing Bayesian\nupdating and the other seeking to generalize the frequentist picture of local\nsensing towards the global paradigm. In the first approach, in order to achieve\nthe best performance, one has to optimize the measurement settings adaptively.\nIn the second approach, the measurement setting is fixed, however the challenge\nis to identify this fixed measurement optimally.",

    "abstract": "With the widespread adoption of edge computing technologies and the\nincreasing prevalence of deep learning models in these environments, the\nsecurity risks and privacy threats to models and data have grown more acute.\nAttackers can exploit various techniques to illegally obtain models or misuse\ndata, leading to serious issues such as intellectual property infringement and\nprivacy breaches. Existing model access control technologies primarily rely on\ntraditional encryption and authentication methods; however, these approaches\nexhibit significant limitations in terms of flexibility and adaptability in\ndynamic environments. Although there have been advancements in model\nwatermarking techniques for marking model ownership, they remain limited in\ntheir ability to proactively protect intellectual property and prevent\nunauthorized access. To address these challenges, we propose a novel model\naccess control method tailored for edge computing environments. This method\nleverages image style as a licensing mechanism, embedding style recognition\ninto the model's operational framework to enable intrinsic access control.\nConsequently, models deployed on edge platforms are designed to correctly infer\nonly on license data with specific style, rendering them ineffective on any\nother data. By restricting the input data to the edge model, this approach not\nonly prevents attackers from gaining unauthorized access to the model but also\nenhances the privacy of data on terminal devices. We conducted extensive\nexperiments on benchmark datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR-10, and FACESCRUB,\nand the results demonstrate that our method effectively prevents unauthorized\naccess to the model while maintaining accuracy. Additionally, the model shows\nstrong resistance against attacks such as forged licenses and fine-tuning.\nThese results underscore the method's usability, security, and robustness.",

A general approach to address this issue is to outsource\ndecryption to decryption cloud service(DCS). Existing schemes have utilized\nvarious methods to enable users to verify outsourced results; however, they\nlack an effective mechanism to achieve exemptibility which enables the honest\nDCS to escape from wrong claims.

In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based\npayable outsourced decryption ABE scheme that achieves both verifiability and\nexemptibility without adding redundant information to ABE ciphertext. We use\nzero-knowledge proof to verify outsourced results on blockchain and introduce\nan optional single-round challenge game under optimistic assumption to address\nthe high cost of proof generation.

    "abstract": "Animals survive in dynamic environments changing at arbitrary timescales, but\nsuch data distribution shifts are a challenge to neural networks. To adapt to\nchange, neural systems may change a large number of parameters, which is a slow\nprocess involving forgetting past information. In contrast, animals leverage\ndistribution changes to segment their stream of experience into tasks and\nassociate them with internal task abstracts. Animals can then respond flexibly\nby selecting the appropriate task abstraction. However, how such flexible task\nabstractions may arise in neural systems remains unknown. Here, we analyze a\nlinear gated network where the weights and gates are jointly optimized via\ngradient descent, but with neuron-like constraints on the gates including a\nfaster timescale, nonnegativity, and bounded activity. We observe that the\nweights self-organize into modules specialized for tasks or sub-tasks\nencountered, while the gates layer forms unique representations that switch the\nappropriate weight modules (task abstractions). We analytically reduce the\nlearning dynamics to an effective eigenspace, revealing a virtuous cycle: fast\nadapting gates drive weight specialization by protecting previous knowledge,\nwhile weight specialization in turn increases the update rate of the gating\nlayer. Task switching in the gating layer accelerates as a function of\ncurriculum block size and task training, mirroring key findings in cognitive\nneuroscience. We show that the discovered task abstractions support\ngeneralization through both task and subtask composition, and we extend our\nfindings to a non-linear network switching between two tasks. Overall, our work\noffers a theory of cognitive flexibility in animals as arising from joint\ngradient descent on synaptic and neural gating in a neural network\narchitecture.",

Previous analyses\nvia Sunyaev-Zeldovich and weak lensing data suggested that the system\npotentially was a dissociative cluster post-merger. In this work, we use new,\ndeep XMM-Newton data to study the hot gas in X-rays, spectroscopic Gemini data\nto precisely determine the redshift of the two mass concentrations, and new HST\ndata to improve the total mass estimates of the two components. We find that\nSPT-CLJ2228-5828 constitutes a pre-merging, double cluster system, instead of a\npost-merger. The merging process of the two clusters has started with their\noutskirt gas colliding with a $\\sim 22^{\\circ}-27^{\\circ}$ on the plane of the\nsky. We fully characterize the surface brightness, gas density, temperature,\npressure, and entropy profiles of the two merging clusters. The two systems\nhave very similar X-ray properties with a moderate cluster mass of\n$M_{\\text{tot}}\\sim (2.1-2.4)\\times 10^{14}\\ M_{\\odot}$. A $\\approx 333$ kpc\nlong gas bridge connecting the two clusters is detected at a $5.8\\sigma$ level.\nThe baryon overdensity of the excess bridge gas is $\\delta_{\\text{b}}\\sim\n(75-320)$ across the length of the bridge and its gas mass is\n$M_{\\text{gas}}\\sim 1.4\\times 10^{12}\\ M_{\\odot}$. Gas density and temperature\njumps are also found across the gas bridge, revealing the existence of a weak\nshock front with a Mach number $\\mathcal{M}\\sim 1.1$. The gas pressure and\nentropy are also increased at the position of the shock front. We estimate the\nage of the shock front to be $\\lesssim 100$ Myr and its kinetic energy $\\sim\n2.4\\times 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$. SPT-CLJ2228-5828 is the first such high-$z$\npre-merger with a gas bridge and a shock front to be studied in X-rays.",

Modern sequencing machines generate vast amounts of fragmented\nstrings of genome data called reads. The alignment of these reads into a\ncomplete DNA sequence of an organism (the read mapping process) requires\nextensive data transfer between processing units and memory, leading to\nexecution bottlenecks. Prior studies have primarily focused on accelerating\nspecific stages of the read-mapping task. Conversely, this paper introduces a\nholistic framework called DART-PIM that accelerates the entire read-mapping\nprocess. DART-PIM facilitates digital processing-in-memory (PIM) for an\nend-to-end acceleration of the entire read-mapping process, from indexing using\na unique data organization schema to filtering and read alignment with an\noptimized Wagner Fischer algorithm. A comprehensive performance evaluation with\nreal genomic data shows that DART-PIM achieves a 5.7x and 257x improvement in\nthroughput and a 92x and 27x energy efficiency enhancement compared to\nstate-of-the-art GPU and PIM implementations, respectively.",

It makes the learning of\ngood user and item representations hard. Second, the temporal aspect is\ncrucial: We cannot recommend an item in the future or too much in the past.\nTherefore, using solely collaborative filtering barely works. Finally, it is\nessential to integrate information about the users and the items, as we cannot\nrely only on previous interactions. This paper proposes a temporal graph-based\nmethod for job recommendation: TIMBRE (Temporal Integrated Model for Better\nREcommendations). TIMBRE integrates user and item information into a\nheterogeneous graph. This graph is adapted to allow efficient temporal\nrecommendation and evaluation, which is later done using a graph neural\nnetwork.

We estimated the column densities of COMs detected through the\niterative LTE line fitting method. According to our analyses, using only\noptically thin lines is critical to deriving the reliable column densities of\nCOMs. Therefore, covering a large frequency range is important for the studies\nof COMs. The most distinct phenomenon found from the spectra of the V883 Ori\ndisk is that nitrogen-bearing COMs other than CH$_{3}$CN are missing, whereas\nvarious oxygen-bearing COMs, except for the CH$_2$OH-bearing molecules, are\ndetected. The missing CH$_2$OH-bearing COMs may indicate the warm water-ice\ndominant environment for forming COMs. We compared our results with various\nobjects in different evolutionary stages, from Class 0 hot corinos to a Solar\nSystem comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, to examine the effect of evolution on\nthe COM compositions. In general, the COMs abundances relative to methanol in\nV883 Ori are higher than in the hot corinos and hot cores, while they are\ncomparable to the cometary values.

    "abstract": "The proliferation of 2D foundation models has sparked research into adapting\nthem for open-world 3D instance segmentation. Recent methods introduce a\nparadigm that leverages superpoints as geometric primitives and incorporates 2D\nmulti-view masks from Segment Anything model (SAM) as merging guidance,\nachieving outstanding zero-shot instance segmentation results. However, the\nlimited use of 3D priors restricts the segmentation performance. Previous\nmethods calculate the 3D superpoints solely based on estimated normal from\nspatial coordinates, resulting in under-segmentation for instances with similar\ngeometry. Besides, the heavy reliance on SAM and hand-crafted algorithms in 2D\nspace suffers from over-segmentation due to SAM's inherent part-level\nsegmentation tendency. To address these issues, we propose SA3DIP, a novel\nmethod for Segmenting Any 3D Instances via exploiting potential 3D Priors.\nSpecifically, on one hand, we generate complementary 3D primitives based on\nboth geometric and textural priors, which reduces the initial errors that\naccumulate in subsequent procedures. On the other hand, we introduce\nsupplemental constraints from the 3D space by using a 3D detector to guide a\nfurther merging process. Furthermore, we notice a considerable portion of\nlow-quality ground truth annotations in ScanNetV2 benchmark, which affect the\nfair evaluations. Thus, we present ScanNetV2-INS with complete ground truth\nlabels and supplement additional instances for 3D class-agnostic instance\nsegmentation.

The distribution of NHI\nfor GRB-DLAs is $\\sim$10 times higher than what is found for quasar-DLAs at\nsimilar impact parameters. We interpret this as a temporal selection effect due\nto the short-lived GRB progenitor probing its host at the onset of a starburst\nwhere the interstellar medium may exhibit multiple overdense regions. Owing to\nthe larger NHI, the dust extinction is larger with 29 per cent of GRB-DLAs\nexhibiting A(V)>1 mag in agreement with the fraction of 'dark bursts'. Despite\nthe differences in NHI distributions, we find that high-redshift 2 < z < 3\nquasar- and GRB-DLAs trace the luminosity function of star-forming host\ngalaxies in the same way. We propose that their differences may arise from the\nfact that the galaxies are sampled at different times in their star formation\nhistories, and that the absorption sightlines probe the galaxy haloes\ndifferently. Quasar-DLAs sample the full H I cross-section, whereas GRB-DLAs\nsample only regions hosting cold neutral medium. Previous studies have found\nthat GRBs avoid high-metallicity galaxies ($\\sim$0.5 $Z_{\\odot}$). Since at\nthese redshifts galaxies on average have lower metallicities, our sample is\nonly weakly sensitive to such a threshold. Lastly, we find that the modest\ndetection rate of cold gas (H$_2$ or C I) in GRB spectra can be explained\nmainly by a low volume filling factor of cold gas clouds and to a lesser degree\nby destruction from the GRB explosion itself.",

Here we propose an explanation for the resilience of\nautonomous morphology, in terms of a diachronic dynamic of attraction and\nrepulsion between morphomic categories, which emerges spontaneously from a\nsimple paradigm cell filling process. Employing computational evolutionary\nmodels, our key innovation is to bring to light the role of `dissociative\nevidence', i.e., evidence for inflectional distinctiveness which a rational\nreasoner will have access to during analogical inference. Dissociative evidence\ncreates a repulsion dynamic which prevents morphomic classes from collapsing\ntogether entirely, i.e., undergoing complete levelling. As we probe alternative\nmodels, we reveal the limits of conditional entropy as a measure for\npredictability in systems that are undergoing change. Finally, we demonstrate\nthat autonomous morphology, far from being `unnatural' (e.g.\n\\citealt{Aronoff1994}), is rather the natural (emergent) consequence of a\nnatural (rational) process of inference applied to inflectional systems.",

To address this, we propose a\nhybrid transfer RL (HTRL) setting, where an agent learns in a target\nenvironment while accessing offline data from a source environment with shifted\ndynamics. We show that -- without information on the dynamics shift -- general\nshifted-dynamics data, even with subtle shifts, does not reduce sample\ncomplexity in the target environment. However, with prior information on the\ndegree of the dynamics shift, we design HySRL, a transfer algorithm that\nachieves problem-dependent sample complexity and outperforms pure online RL.\nFinally, our experimental results demonstrate that HySRL surpasses\nstate-of-the-art online RL baseline.",

The crux of\neffective treatment in slowing neurodegeneration lies in early, accurate\ndiagnosis, as this significantly assists doctors in determining the appropriate\ncourse of action. However, current diagnostic practices often delay VaD\ndiagnosis, impeding timely intervention and adversely affecting patient\nprognosis. This paper presents an innovative multi-omics approach to accurately\ndifferentiate AD from VaD, achieving a diagnostic accuracy of 89.25%. The\nproposed method segments the longitudinal MRI scans and extracts advanced\nradiomics features. Subsequently, it synergistically integrates the radiomics\nfeatures with an ensemble of clinical, cognitive, and genetic data to provide\nstate-of-the-art diagnostic accuracy, setting a new benchmark in classification\naccuracy on a large public dataset. The paper's primary contribution is\nproposing a comprehensive methodology utilizing multi-omics data to provide a\nnuanced understanding of dementia subtypes.

By introducing 3D Gaussian splatting, GS2Pose\ncan utilize the reconstruction results without requiring a high-quality CAD\nmodel, which means it only requires segmented RGBD images as input.\nSpecifically, GS2Pose employs a two-stage structure consisting of coarse\nestimation followed by refined estimation. In the coarse stage, a lightweight\nU-Net network with a polarization attention mechanism, called Pose-Net, is\ndesigned. By using the 3DGS model for supervised training, Pose-Net can\ngenerate NOCS images to compute a coarse pose. In the refinement stage, GS2Pose\nformulates a pose regression algorithm following the idea of reprojection or\nBundle Adjustment (BA), referred to as GS-Refiner. By leveraging Lie algebra to\nextend 3DGS, GS-Refiner obtains a pose-differentiable rendering pipeline that\nrefines the coarse pose by comparing the input images with the rendered images.\nGS-Refiner also selectively updates parameters in the 3DGS model to achieve\nenvironmental adaptation, thereby enhancing the algorithm's robustness and\nflexibility to illuminative variation, occlusion, and other challenging\ndisruptive factors. GS2Pose was evaluated through experiments conducted on the\nLineMod dataset, where it was compared with similar algorithms, yielding highly\ncompetitive results.

Our study\ncontributes to two strands of literature: the literature comparing the effects\nof competitive and strategic behavior on asset price efficiency under costly\ninformation as well as the actively growing literature on algorithmic tacit\ncollusion and pseudo-collusion in financial markets. We find that for certain\nmarket environments (with low information costs) our model reproduces the\nresults of Kyle [1989] in that the ability of traders to trade strategically\nleads to worse price efficiency compared to the purely competitive case. For\nother environments (with high information costs), on the other hand, our\nresults show that a market with strategically acting traders can be more\nefficient than a purely competitive one. Furthermore, we obtain novel results\non the ability of independently learning traders to coordinate on a\npseudo-collusive behavior, leading to non-competitive pricing.

For such a system, as opposed to Brownian gyrator, the potential\nasymmetry and temperature gradient are not the key factors for the gyration, as\nlong as finite activity and magnetic field are present. The system shows only a\nparamagnetic behavior in the absence of either potential asymmetry or\ntemperature gradient.

Interestingly,\nthe magnetic moment vanishes for parameters for which the system possesses a\nnon-equilibrium steady state and hence, a magnetic transition is observed\nthrough these non-magnetic points. Further, when the system is suspended in a\nviscoelastic medium characterized by a finite memory, it exhibits a magnetic\ntransition in the activity-memory parameter space through a non-magnetic line.\nThis non-magnetic line is sensitive to temperature gradient and potential\nasymmetry.

    "abstract": "The advent and proliferation of large multi-modal models (LMMs) have\nintroduced new paradigms to computer vision, transforming various tasks into a\nunified visual question answering framework. Video Quality Assessment (VQA), a\nclassic field in low-level visual perception, focused initially on quantitative\nvideo quality scoring. However, driven by advances in LMMs, it is now\nprogressing toward more holistic visual quality understanding tasks. Recent\nstudies in the image domain have demonstrated that Visual Question Answering\n(VQA) can markedly enhance low-level visual quality evaluation. Nevertheless,\nrelated work has not been explored in the video domain, leaving substantial\nroom for improvement. To address this gap, we introduce the VQA2 Instruction\nDataset - the first visual question answering instruction dataset that focuses\non video quality assessment. This dataset consists of 3 subsets and covers\nvarious video types, containing 157,755 instruction question-answer pairs.\nThen, leveraging this foundation, we present the VQA2 series models. The VQA2\nseries models interleave visual and motion tokens to enhance the perception of\nspatial-temporal quality details in videos. We conduct extensive experiments on\nvideo quality scoring and understanding tasks, and results demonstrate that the\nVQA2series models achieve excellent performance in both tasks. Notably, our\nfinal model, the VQA2-Assistant, exceeds the renowned GPT-4o in visual quality\nunderstanding tasks while maintaining strong competitiveness in quality scoring\ntasks. Our work provides a foundation and feasible approach for integrating\nlow-level video quality assessment and understanding with LMMs.",

We build a catalogue of\nN-body simulations to sample the range of stellar particle resolutions within\nthe EAGLE Ref0050N0752 simulation box and examine how their observable\nkinematics vary relative to a higher-resolution N-body control. We use these\nmodels to compile a table of the minimum number of particles-per-pixel to reach\na given uncertainty in the fitted line-of-sight velocity distribution\nparameters. Further, we introduce a Voronoi-binning module to the mock\nobservation code, SimSpin, in order to meet these minimum numbers. Using EAGLE,\nwe show the impact of this shot noise on the observed spin-ellipticity plane\nand the recovery of this space when observations are binned with increasing\nnumbers of particles. In conclusion, we advise binning mock images to meet at\nleast 200 particles-per-pixel to avoid systematically under-estimating the\nvelocity dispersion along a given line-of-sight.

As the presence of non-minimal\ncoupling, the evaporating behaviors of the Horndeski black hole are vastly\ndifferent from the Reissner-Nordstrom (RN) black hole case.

We find further that, when\nusing data from first-time participants as gold standard, statistical models\nincorporating a simple logistic function to control for reporting fatigue were\nassociated with substantially improved estimation accuracy relative to models\nwith no reporting fatigue adjustments, and that no cap on the number of repeat\nparticipations was required.

    "abstract": "In the ultra-low inter-core crosstalk working zone of terrestrial multi-band\nand multi-core fiber (MCF) elastic optical networks (EONs), the ICXT in all\nchannels of all cores remains below the ICXT threshold of the highest\nmodulation format level (64QAM) for long-haul distances (10000 km). This paper\nanalyzes the performance of this type of MCF in multi-band EONs (MB-EONs). We\ninvestigate two band and space division multiplexing (BSDM) scenarios: MCF and\na bundle of multi-fiber pairs (BuMFP). Furthermore, the UL-ICXT performance of\ntwo MCFs, one with the standard cladding diameter (CD = 125 micrometers) with 4\ncores and another with a nonstandard larger CD with 7 cores, is evaluated in\nthe US backbone network. Our findings show that, with careful design of the\nMCFs physical structure, even with a standard CD, it is possible to achieve\nUL-ICXT in C, L, and S-band long-haul BSDM EONs. Additionally, the simulation\nresults show that network throughput for BSDM EONs with MCFs in the UL-ICXT\nregime is up to 12 percent higher than the BuMFP scenario, with capacity\nincreasing linearly with the number of cores.",

The metric of the new Kerr--AdS is simpler than the standard\nKerr--AdS and exhibits richer geometry, where the effects of rotation appear as\nwarped curvature. We investigate the relationship between unstable photon\norbits and thermodynamic phase transitions in this new Kerr--AdS black hole\nbackground. We derive an exact expression for various thermodynamic properties,\nincluding mass ($M$), Hawking temperature ($T$), entropy ($S$), heat capacity\n($C$), and free energy ($G$), by relating the negative cosmological constant to\npositive pressure through the equation $P = -\\Lambda/(8 \\pi) = 3/(8 \\pi l^2)$,\nwhere $l$ represents the horizon radius, and by introducing its conjugate\nvariable as the thermodynamic volume $V$. When $P < P_c$, black holes with $C_P\n> 0$ are thermodynamically stable, while those with $C_P \\leq 0$ are unstable.\nOur analysis of the Gibbs free energy reveals a phase transition from small,\nglobally unstable black holes to large, globally stable ones. Additionally,\ninvestigating the system's $P$-$V$ criticality and determining the critical\nexponents shows that our system shares similarities with a Van der Waals (vdW)\nfluid. In the reduced parameter space, we observe non-monotonic behavior of the\nphoton sphere radius and the critical impact parameter when the pressure is\nbelow its critical value.

Existing approaches to DPS are\npredominantly based on a bi-level optimisation (BLO) formulation, which is\ndemanding in terms of memory and computation, and exhibits some theoretical\ndefects regarding minibatches. Thus, we propose a novel Bayesian approach to\nDPS. We view the DPS problem as posterior inference in a novel Bayesian model\nwhere the posterior distributions of the instance-wise weights and the main\nneural network parameters are inferred under a reasonable prior and likelihood\nmodel. We employ stochastic gradient Langevin MCMC sampling to learn the main\nnetwork and instance-wise weights jointly, ensuring convergence even with\nminibatches. Our update equation is comparable to the widely used SGD and much\nmore efficient than existing BLO-based methods. Through controlled experiments\nin both the vision and language domains, we present the proof-of-concept.\nAdditionally, we demonstrate that our method scales effectively to large\nlanguage models and facilitates automated per-task optimization for instruction\nfine-tuning datasets.",

Therefore, we propose a\nlightweight disparity estimation method based on a completion-based network\nthat explicitly constrains disparity and learns the physical and systemic\ndisparity properties of DP. By modeling the DP-specific disparity error\nparametrically and using it for sampling during training, the network acquires\nthe unique properties of DP and enhances robustness. This learning also allows\nus to use a common RGB-D dataset for training without a DP dataset, which is\nlabor-intensive to acquire. Furthermore, we propose a non-learning-based\nrefinement framework that efficiently handles inherent disparity expansion\nerrors by appropriately refining the confidence map of the network output. As a\nresult, the proposed method achieved state-of-the-art results while reducing\nthe overall system size to 1/5 of that of the conventional method, even without\nusing the DP dataset for training, thereby demonstrating its effectiveness.

Forecasting of future values of such\ntime series based on recorded historical values has important benefits.\nAutomatically designed models achieve higher accuracy than manually designed\nmodels. Given a forecasting task, which includes a dataset and a forecasting\nhorizon, automated design methods automatically search for an optimal\nforecasting model for the task in a manually designed search space, and then\ntrain the identified model using the dataset to enable the forecasting.\nExisting automated methods face three challenges. First, the search space is\nconstructed by human experts, rending the methods only semi-automated and\nyielding search spaces prone to subjective biases. Second, it is time consuming\nto search for an optimal model. Third, training the identified model for a new\ntask is also costly. These challenges limit the practicability of automated\nmethods in real-world settings. To contend with the challenges, we propose a\nfully automated and highly efficient correlated time series forecasting\nframework where the search and training can be done in minutes. The framework\nincludes a data-driven, iterative strategy to automatically prune a large\nsearch space to obtain a high-quality search space for a new forecasting task.\nIt includes a zero-shot search strategy to efficiently identify the optimal\nmodel in the customized search space.

The latter ability is\nessential for tackling complex arithmetic and mathematical problems and serves\nas a foundation for most reasoning tasks, but previous work paid little\nattention to it or only discussed several restricted tasks (like integer\naddition). In this paper, we comprehensively investigate the numerical\nunderstanding and processing ability (NUPA) of LLMs. Firstly, we introduce a\nbenchmark covering four common numerical representations and 17 distinct\nnumerical tasks in four major categories, resulting in 41 meaningful\ncombinations in total. These tasks are derived from primary and secondary\neducation curricula, encompassing nearly all everyday numerical understanding\nand processing scenarios, and the rules of these tasks are very simple and\nclear. Through the benchmark, we find that current LLMs fail frequently in many\nof the tasks. To study the problem, we train small models with existing and\npotential techniques for enhancing NUPA (such as tokenizers, PEs, and number\nformats), comprehensively evaluating their effectiveness using our testbed. We\nalso finetune practical-scale LLMs on our proposed NUPA tasks and find that 1)\nnaive finetuning can improve NUPA a lot on many but not all tasks, and 2)\nsurprisingly, techniques designed to enhance NUPA prove ineffective for\nfinetuning pretrained models. We further explore the impact of chain-of-thought\ntechniques on NUPA. Our work provides a more detailed and comprehensive\nunderstanding of NUPA in LLMs. Our benchmark and code are released at\nhttps://github.com/GraphPKU/number_cookbook.",

    "abstract": "Current state-of-the-art frequency standards are passive optical atomic\nclocks where the frequency of an optical resonator is stabilized to a narrow\natomic transition. Passive clocks have achieved unprecedented stabilities of\n6.6 x 10--19 over one hour of averaging time [1]. However, they face intrinsic\nlimitations, particularly due to thermal and mechanical fluctuations of the\nlocal oscillator. To surpass the limitations of the passive clocks and go\nbeyond the state-of-the-art, the idea of building active optical atomic clocks\nemerges. These clocks would be optical counterparts of hydrogen masers, with\nthe emitted frequency defined by the atomic transition and therefore inherently\nstable against cavity instabilities.

This phenomenon is partic-ularly notable\nwhen directly apply conventional diffusion process to k-space data without\nconsidering the inherent properties of k-space sampling, limiting k-space\nlearning efficiency and image reconstruction quality. To tackle these\nchallenges, we introduce subspace diffusion model with orthogonal\ndecomposition, a method (referred to as Sub-DM) that restrict the diffusion\nprocess via projections onto subspace as the k-space data distribution evolves\ntoward noise. Particularly, the subspace diffusion model circumvents the\ninference challenges posed by the com-plex and high-dimensional characteristics\nof k-space data, so the highly compact subspace ensures that diffusion process\nrequires only a few simple iterations to produce accurate prior information.\nFurthermore, the orthogonal decomposition strategy based on wavelet transform\nhin-ders the information loss during the migration of the vanilla diffusion\nprocess to the subspace. Considering the strate-gy is approximately reversible,\nsuch that the entire pro-cess can be reversed. As a result, it allows the\ndiffusion processes in different spaces to refine models through a mutual\nfeedback mechanism, enabling the learning of ac-curate prior even when dealing\nwith complex k-space data.

We introduce a new analytical framework via cross-domain\n\\textit{latent distribution matching} (LDM), which establishes content-style\nidentifiability under substantially more relaxed conditions. Specifically, we\nshow that restrictive assumptions such as component-wise independence of the\nlatent variables can be removed.

These methods usually\nupdate candidate formulas to obtain new ones with lower prediction errors\niteratively. However, since formulas with similar function shapes may have\ncompletely different symbolic forms, the prediction error does not decrease\nmonotonously as the search approaches the target formula, causing the low\nrecovery rate of existing methods. To solve this problem, we propose a novel\nsearch objective based on the minimum description length, which reflects the\ndistance from the target and decreases monotonically as the search approaches\nthe correct form of the target formula. To estimate the minimum description\nlength of any input data, we design a neural network, MDLformer, which enables\nrobust and scalable estimation through large-scale training.

    "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that deep learning models are very vulnerable to\npoisoning attacks. Many defense methods have been proposed to address this\nissue. However, traditional poisoning attacks are not as threatening as\ncommonly believed. This is because they often cause differences in how the\nmodel performs on the training set compared to the validation set. Such\ninconsistency can alert defenders that their data has been poisoned, allowing\nthem to take the necessary defensive actions. In this paper, we introduce a\nmore threatening type of poisoning attack called the Deferred Poisoning Attack.\nThis new attack allows the model to function normally during the training and\nvalidation phases but makes it very sensitive to evasion attacks or even\nnatural noise. We achieve this by ensuring the poisoned model's loss function\nhas a similar value as a normally trained model at each input sample but with a\nlarge local curvature. A similar model loss ensures that there is no obvious\ninconsistency between the training and validation accuracy, demonstrating high\nstealthiness. On the other hand, the large curvature implies that a small\nperturbation may cause a significant increase in model loss, leading to\nsubstantial performance degradation, which reflects a worse robustness. We\nfulfill this purpose by making the model have singular Hessian information at\nthe optimal point via our proposed Singularization Regularization term. We have\nconducted both theoretical and empirical analyses of the proposed method and\nvalidated its effectiveness through experiments on image classification tasks.\nFurthermore, we have confirmed the hazards of this form of poisoning attack\nunder more general scenarios using natural noise, offering a new perspective\nfor research in the field of security.",

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained considerable prominence in\nsemi-supervised learning tasks in processing graph-structured data, primarily\nowing to their message-passing mechanism, which largely relies on the\navailability of clean labels. However, in real-world scenarios, labels on nodes\nof graphs are inevitably noisy and sparsely labeled, significantly degrading\nthe performance of GNNs. Exploring robust GNNs for semi-supervised node\nclassification in the presence of noisy and sparse labels remains a critical\nchallenge. Therefore, we propose a novel \\textbf{G}raph \\textbf{N}eural\n\\textbf{N}etwork with \\textbf{C}oarse- and \\textbf{F}ine-\\textbf{G}rained\n\\textbf{D}ivision for mitigating label sparsity and noise, namely GNN-CFGD. The\nkey idea of GNN-CFGD is reducing the negative impact of noisy labels via\ncoarse- and fine-grained division, along with graph reconstruction.\nSpecifically, we first investigate the effectiveness of linking unlabeled nodes\nto cleanly labeled nodes, demonstrating that this approach is more effective in\ncombating labeling noise than linking to potentially noisy labeled nodes. Based\non this observation, we introduce a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) based on the\nmemory effect to perform a coarse-grained division of the given labels into\nclean and noisy labels. Next, we propose a clean labels oriented link that\nconnects unlabeled nodes to cleanly labeled nodes, aimed at mitigating label\nsparsity and promoting supervision propagation. Furthermore, to provide refined\nsupervision for noisy labeled nodes and additional supervision for unlabeled\nnodes, we fine-grain the noisy labeled and unlabeled nodes into two candidate\nsets based on confidence, respectively. Extensive experiments on various\ndatasets demonstrate the superior effectiveness and robustness of GNN-CFGD.",

Achieving this advancement requires\nboth specialized general models grounded in real-world scientific data and\niterative, exploratory frameworks that mirror human scientific methodologies.\nIn this paper, we present PROTEUS, a fully automated system for scientific\ndiscovery from raw proteomics data. PROTEUS uses large language models (LLMs)\nto perform hierarchical planning, execute specialized bioinformatics tools, and\niteratively refine analysis workflows to generate high-quality scientific\nhypotheses. The system takes proteomics datasets as input and produces a\ncomprehensive set of research objectives, analysis results, and novel\nbiological hypotheses without human intervention. We evaluated PROTEUS on 12\nproteomics datasets collected from various biological samples (e.g. immune\ncells, tumors) and different sample types (single-cell and bulk), generating\n191 scientific hypotheses. These were assessed using both automatic LLM-based\nscoring on 5 metrics and detailed reviews from human experts. Results\ndemonstrate that PROTEUS consistently produces reliable, logically coherent\nresults that align well with existing literature while also proposing novel,\nevaluable hypotheses. The system's flexible architecture facilitates seamless\nintegration of diverse analysis tools and adaptation to different proteomics\ndata types.

    "abstract": "We investigate a new class of transverse momentum dependent functions (TMDs),\nas known as align-spin (AS) functions. In the paper, we propose the most\nsuitable proof of the AS-function existence together with the demonstration of\nthe preponderances if the framework of twisted quark states has been employed.\nThe twisted state corresponds to the elementary particle (quark) which\npossesses the nontrivial intrinsic orbital angular momentum owing to the\nswirling trajectory of motion. In its turn, it leads to the cylindric system\napplied for the consideration. In this connection, we reveal that the twisted\n(vortex) quark states serve as effective tools for the study of TMDs, thereby\nfacilitating a comprehensive analysis of AS-functions. In contrast to the\nprevious studies, where the existence of new TMDs is related to the the\ncorresponding interactions encoded in the correlators, we now focus on the\nleading order of interactions providing a simplified and robust method. This\nhas been ensured by the twisted quark in the corresponding correlator because\nthe essential transverse momentum dependence of quarks generated by\ninteractions in the correlators can be alternatively described by the twisted\nstates. Using a cylindrical formulation for twisted states, we can combine the\nproperties of plane-wave particles with a description stemmed from spherical\nharmonics, resulting in well-defined propagation directions accompanied by\nessential OAM projections. In particular, this innovative framework opens a new\nwindow for the direct investigations of AS-functions, generating the unique\nangular $\\phi$-dependence of differential cross sections.

We present a proof of\nconcept for a methodology that detects and tracks people in video footage and\nestimates interactions between customers and employees by estimating their\nposes and calculating the duration of their encounters. We propose a pipeline\nthat combines existing object detection and tracking algorithms (YOLOv8 and\nDeepSORT) with pose estimation algorithms (BlazePose) to estimate the number of\ncustomers and employees in the footage as well as the duration of their\nencounters. We use a simple rule-based approach to classify the interactions as\npositive, neutral or negative based on three different criteria: distance,\nduration and pose. The proposed methodology is tested on a small dataset of\nCCTV footage. While the data is quite limited in particular with respect to the\nquality of the footage, we have chosen this case as it represents a typical\nsetting where the method could be applied. The results show that the object\ndetection and tracking part of the pipeline has a reasonable performance on the\ndataset with a high degree of recall and reasonable accuracy. At this stage,\nthe pose estimation is still limited to fully detect the type of interactions\ndue to difficulties in tracking employees in the footage.

Dielectric breakdowns - micro-discharges -\nroutinely occur in capacitors due to the inevitable presence of localized\nstructure defects. The application of polymeric dielectric materials featuring\nflexible structures helps obtain more uniform insulating layers. At the modern\ntechnological level, it is impossible to completely avoid micro-discharges upon\ndevice exploitation. Every micro-discharge results in the formation of a soot\nchannel, which is empirically known to exhibit semiconductor behavior. Because\nof its capability to conduct electricity, the emerged soot channels harm the\nsubsequent capacitor performance and decrease the amount of stored energy. The\naccumulation of the soot throughout a dielectric capacitor ultimately results\nin irreversible overall failure. In the context of the dielectric breakdown,\nself-healing designates a range of chemical processes, which spontaneously\nrearrange the atoms in the soot channels to partially return their insulative\nfunction. We developed a universal method capable of rating new capacitor\ndesigns including electrode and polymer material and their proportions. We\nfound the best-performing designs produce abundant volatile by-products after\nmicro-discharge, whereas the soot samples exhibit lower electronic\nconductivities.

The optimal\ncomplexity varies non-monotonically with target size, with `magic' sizes\nappearing for high-symmetry designs in which symmetry axes do not intersect\nvertices of the triangular net. The optimal designs at magic sizes require 12\ntimes fewer inequivalent interaction-types than the (minimal symmetry) fully\naddressable construction, which greatly reduces the timescale and experimental\ncost required to achieve high fidelity assembly of large targets.

In this manuscript, we investigate such a spontaneous radiation\nprocess by employing the quantum trajectory approach. When the dissipation rate\nof the system is very low, there can be a reversible energy exchange between\nthe mirror in the excited state and the vacuum field, and this reversible\nexchange is called vacuum Casimir-Rabi oscillations.

This approach resulted in\nan enhancement factor of over 10^7, sufficient for single-molecule detection,\nwith a detection limit as low as 10^-12 M. Our thermally tunable nanogaps\nprovide a powerful tool for precise detection of molecules and offer\nsignificant advantages for a wide range of sensing and analytical applications",

    "abstract": "Stereo matching has emerged as a cost-effective solution for road surface 3D\nreconstruction, garnering significant attention towards improving both\ncomputational efficiency and accuracy. This article introduces decisive\ndisparity diffusion (D3Stereo), marking the first exploration of dense deep\nfeature matching that adapts pre-trained deep convolutional neural networks\n(DCNNs) to previously unseen road scenarios. A pyramid of cost volumes is\ninitially created using various levels of learned representations.\nSubsequently, a novel recursive bilateral filtering algorithm is employed to\naggregate these costs. A key innovation of D3Stereo lies in its alternating\ndecisive disparity diffusion strategy, wherein intra-scale diffusion is\nemployed to complete sparse disparity images, while inter-scale inheritance\nprovides valuable prior information for higher resolutions. Extensive\nexperiments conducted on our created UDTIRI-Stereo and Stereo-Road datasets\nunderscore the effectiveness of D3Stereo strategy in adapting pre-trained DCNNs\nand its superior performance compared to all other explicit programming-based\nalgorithms designed specifically for road surface 3D reconstruction. Additional\nexperiments conducted on the Middlebury dataset with backbone DCNNs pre-trained\non the ImageNet database further validate the versatility of D3Stereo strategy\nin tackling general stereo matching problems.",

We\nemploy SHAP to explain two real-world datasets: one for cerebral palsy (CP)\nclassification and the widely used NTU RGB+D 60 action recognition dataset.

    "abstract": "Recently, multi-view learning has witnessed a considerable interest on the\nresearch of trusted decision-making. Previous methods are mainly inspired from\nan important paper published by Han et al. in 2021, which formulates a Trusted\nMulti-view Classification (TMC) framework that aggregates evidence from\ndifferent views based on Dempster's combination rule. All these methods only\nconsider inter-view aggregation, yet lacking exploitation of intra-view\ninformation. In this paper, we propose a generalized trusted multi-view\nclassification framework with hierarchical opinion aggregation. This\nhierarchical framework includes a two-phase aggregation process: the intra-view\nand inter-view aggregation hierarchies. In the intra aggregation, we assume\nthat each view is comprised of common information shared with other views, as\nwell as its specific information. We then aggregate both the common and\nspecific information. This aggregation phase is useful to eliminate the feature\nnoise inherent to view itself, thereby improving the view quality. In the\ninter-view aggregation, we design an attention mechanism at the evidence level\nto facilitate opinion aggregation from different views. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is one of the pioneering efforts to formulate a hierarchical\naggregation framework in the trusted multi-view learning domain.

The existing method, which solely exploits radio\nfrequency (RF) communication information, is difficult to accomplish accurate\nchannel modeling. Fortunately, multi-modal devices are deployed on intelligent\nagents to obtain environmental features, which could further assist in channel\nmodeling. Currently, some research efforts have been devoted to utilizing\nmulti-modal information to facilitate channel modeling, while still lack a\ncomprehensive review. To fill this gap, we embark on an initial endeavor with\nthe goal of reviewing multi-modal intelligent channel modeling (MMICM) via\nSynesthesia of Machines (SoM). Compared to channel modeling approaches that\nsolely utilize RF communication information, the utilization of multi-modal\ninformation can provide a more in-depth understanding of the propagation\nenvironment around the transceiver, thus facilitating more accurate channel\nmodeling. First, this paper introduces existing channel modeling approaches\nfrom the perspective of the channel modeling evolution. Then, we have\nelaborated and investigated recent advances in the topic of capturing typical\nchannel characteristics and features, i.e., channel non-stationarity and\nconsistency, by characterizing the mathematical, spatial, coupling, and mapping\nrelationships. In addition, applications that can be supported by MMICM are\nsummarized and analyzed. To corroborate the superiority of MMICM via SoM, we\ngive the simulation result and analysis. Finally, some open issues and\npotential directions for the MMICM are outlined from the perspectives of\nmeasurements, modeling, and applications.",

This issue is compounded by the\nchoice of bias evaluation benchmarks in popular preference-finetuned models,\nwhich predominantly focus on dominant social categories, such as binary gender,\nthereby limiting insights into biases affecting underrepresented groups.\nTowards addressing this gap, we center transgender, nonbinary, and other\ngender-diverse identities to investigate how alignment procedures interact with\npre-existing gender-diverse bias in LLMs. Our key contributions include: 1) a\ncomprehensive survey of bias evaluation modalities across leading\npreference-finetuned LLMs, highlighting critical gaps in gender-diverse\nrepresentation, 2) systematic evaluation of gender-diverse biases across 16\nmodels spanning Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) stages, uncovering harms\npopular bias benchmarks fail to detect, and 3) a flexible framework for\nmeasuring harmful biases in implicit reward signals applicable to other social\ncontexts. Our findings reveal that DPO-aligned models are particularly\nsensitive to supervised finetuning (SFT), and can amplify two forms of\nreal-world gender-diverse harms from their base models: stigmatization and\ngender non-affirmative language.

Apart from\nthe vast amount of linear operations needed due to their sizes, modern\ntransformer models are increasingly reliance on precise non-linear computations\nthat make traditional low-bitwidth quantization methods and fixed-dataflow\nmatrix accelerators ineffective for end-to-end acceleration. To address this\nneed to accelerate both linear and non-linear operations in a unified and\nprogrammable framework, this paper introduces TATAA. TATAA employs 8-bit\ninteger (int8) arithmetic for quantized linear layer operations through\npost-training quantization, while it relies on bfloat16 floating-point\narithmetic to approximate non-linear layers of a transformer model. TATAA\nhardware features a transformable arithmetic architecture that supports both\nformats during runtime with minimal overhead, enabling it to switch between a\nsystolic array mode for int8 matrix multiplications and a SIMD mode for\nvectorized bfloat16 operations. An end-to-end compiler is presented to enable\nflexible mapping from emerging transformer models to the proposed hardware.\nExperimental results indicate that our mixed-precision design incurs only 0.14%\nto 1.16% accuracy drop when compared with the pre-trained single-precision\ntransformer models across a range of vision, language, and generative text\napplications. Our prototype implementation on the Alveo U280 FPGA currently\nachieves 2935.2 GOPS throughput on linear layers and a maximum of 189.5 GFLOPS\nfor non-linear operations, outperforming related works by up to 1.45x in\nend-to-end throughput and 2.29x in DSP efficiency, while achieving 2.19x higher\npower efficiency than modern NVIDIA RTX4090 GPU.",

We show that the scheme\naccurately captures the long-time dynamics of the underlying geophysical model,\nwith the global attractors and invariant measures of the scheme converging to\nthose of the original model as the step size approaches zero.\n  In our numerical experiments, we adopt an indirect approach, using statistics\nfrom long-time simulations to approximate the invariant measures. Our results\nsuggest that the convergence rate of the long-term statistics, as a function of\nterminal time, is approximately first-order under the Jensen-Shannon metric and\nhalf-order under the total variation metric. This implies that extremely long\nsimulations are required to achieve high-precision approximations of the\ninvariant measure (or climate). Nevertheless, the second-order scheme\nsignificantly outperforms its first-order counterpart, requiring far less time\nto reach a small neighborhood of statistical equilibrium for a given step size.",

INRs leverage multilayer perceptrons\n(MLPs) to model data as continuous implicit functions, providing critical\nadvantages such as resolution independence, memory efficiency, and\ngeneralisation beyond discretised data structures. Their ability to solve\ncomplex inverse problems makes them particularly effective for tasks including\naudio reconstruction, image representation, 3D object reconstruction, and\nhigh-dimensional data synthesis. This survey provides a comprehensive review of\nstate-of-the-art INR methods, introducing a clear taxonomy that categorises\nthem into four key areas: activation functions, position encoding, combined\nstrategies, and network structure optimisation. We rigorously analyse their\ncritical properties, such as full differentiability, smoothness, compactness,\nand adaptability to varying resolutions while also examining their strengths\nand limitations in addressing locality biases and capturing fine details. Our\nexperimental comparison offers new insights into the trade-offs between\ndifferent approaches, showcasing the capabilities and challenges of the latest\nINR techniques across various tasks. In addition to identifying areas where\ncurrent methods excel, we highlight key limitations and potential avenues for\nimprovement, such as developing more expressive activation functions, enhancing\npositional encoding mechanisms, and improving scalability for complex,\nhigh-dimensional data. This survey serves as a roadmap for researchers,\noffering practical guidance for future exploration in the field of INRs.

Domain\nadaptation and domain generalization have been studied extensively as\napproaches to address distribution shifts across test and train domains, but\neach has its limitations. Test-time adaptation, a recently emerging learning\nparadigm, combines the benefits of domain adaptation and domain generalization\nby training models only on source data and adapting them to target data during\ntest-time inference. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive and systematic\nreview on test-time adaptation, covering more than 400 recent papers. We\nstructure our review by categorizing existing methods into five distinct\ncategories based on what component of the method is adjusted for test-time\nadaptation: the model, the inference, the normalization, the sample, or the\nprompt, providing detailed analysis of each. We further discuss the various\npreparation and adaptation settings for methods within these categories,\noffering deeper insights into the effective deployment for the evaluation of\ndistribution shifts and their real-world application in understanding images,\nvideo and 3D, as well as modalities beyond vision.

The complexity of optimizing and automating S2L surpasses\nthat of L2S due to intricate AI services' requirements, such as handling\nuncontrollable parameters, learning in adversarial conditions, and achieving\nlong-term performance goals.

Frankl (2016)\nproved that if $\\mathcal{F} \\subseteq\\binom{[n]}{k+t}$ and $\\mathcal{G}\n\\subseteq\\binom{[n]}{k}$ are cross-intersecting families, and $\\mathcal{F}$ is\nnon-empty and $(t+1)$-intersecting, then $|\\mathcal{F}|+|\\mathcal{G}|\n\\leq\\binom{n}{k}-\\binom{n-k-t}{k}+1$. Recently, Wu (2023) sharpened Frankl's\nresult by establishing a stability variant. The aim of this paper is two-fold.\nInspired by the above results, we first prove a further stability variant that\ngeneralizes both Frankl's result and Wu's result. Secondly, as an interesting\napplication, we illustrate that the aforementioned results on\ncross-intersecting families could be used to establish the stability results of\nthe Erd\\H{o}s--Ko--Rado theorem. More precisely, we present new short proofs of\nthe Hilton--Milner theorem, the Han--Kohayakawa theorem and the Huang--Peng\ntheorem. Our arguments are more straightforward, and it may be of independent\ninterest.",

    "abstract": "Relativistic jets manifest some of the most intriguing activities in the\nnuclear regions of active galaxies. Identifying the most powerful relativistic\njets permits us to probe the most luminous accretion systems and, in turn, the\nmost massive black holes. This paper reports the identification of one such\nobject, PMN J1310$-$5552 ($z=1.56$), a blazar candidate of uncertain type\ndetected with the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) and Swift Burst Alert\nTelescope. The detection of broad emission lines in its optical spectra taken\nwith the X-Shooter and Goodman spectrographs classifies it to be a\nflat-spectrum radio quasar. The analysis of the Goodman optical spectrum has\nrevealed PMN J1310$-$5552 harbors a massive black hole (log scale $M_{\\rm\nBH}=9.90\\pm0.07$, in $M_{\\odot}$) and luminous accretion disk (log scale\n$L_{\\rm disk}=46.86\\pm0.03$, in erg s$^{-1}$). The fitting of the observed big\nblue bump with the standard accretion disk model resulted in the log scale\n$M_{\\rm BH}=9.81^{+0.19}_{-0.20}$ (in $M_{\\odot}$) and $L_{\\rm\ndisk}=46.86^{+0.09}_{-0.09}$ (in erg s$^{-1}$), respectively. These parameters\nsuggest PMN J1310$-$5552 hosts one of the most massive black holes and the most\nluminous accretion disks among the blazar population. The physical properties\nof this enigmatic blazar were studied by modeling the broadband spectral energy\ndistribution considering the data from NuSTAR, Swift, Fermi-LAT, and archival\nobservations. Overall, PMN J1310$-$5552 is a powerful `MeV' blazar with\nphysical parameters similar to other members of this unique class of blazars.\nThese results provide glimpses of monsters lurking among the unknown\nhigh-energy emitters and demonstrate the importance of ongoing wide-field sky\nsurveys to discover them.",

Traditional\narchitectures, such as 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3D CNNs) and\nself-attention mechanisms, face challenges in efficiently capturing long-range\ndependencies within 3D voxel grids, limiting their effectiveness. To address\nthese issues, we introduce MetaSSC, a novel meta-learning-based framework for\nSSC that leverages deformable convolution, large-kernel attention, and the\nMamba (D-LKA-M) model. Our approach begins with a voxel-based semantic\nsegmentation (SS) pretraining task, aimed at exploring the semantics and\ngeometry of incomplete regions while acquiring transferable meta-knowledge.\nUsing simulated cooperative perception datasets, we supervise the perception\ntraining of a single vehicle using aggregated sensor data from multiple nearby\nconnected autonomous vehicles (CAVs), generating richer and more comprehensive\nlabels. This meta-knowledge is then adapted to the target domain through a\ndual-phase training strategy that does not add extra model parameters, enabling\nefficient deployment. To further enhance the model's capability in capturing\nlong-sequence relationships within 3D voxel grids, we integrate Mamba blocks\nwith deformable convolution and large-kernel attention into the backbone\nnetwork.

For each perspective, we collected quantitative score in $0\\sim 5$ and\ntext descriptive feedback on the specific failure points in ground-truth edited\nimages, resulting in a high-quality editing reward dataset, i.e.,\nRewardEdit20K. 2) We further proposed a novel training framework to seamlessly\nintegrate the metric output, regarded as multi-reward, into editing models to\nlearn from the imperfect training triplets.

Chiral charge density waves (CDWs), where chirality arises\nfrom correlated charge orders, are attracting intense interest due to their\nexotic transport and optical properties. However, a general framework for\npredicting chiral CDW materials is lacking, primarily because the underlying\nmechanisms remain elusive. Here, we address this challenge by developing the\nfirst comprehensive predictive framework, systematically identifying chiral CDW\nmaterials via first-principles calculations. The key lies in the previously\noverlooked phase difference of the CDW Q-vectors between layers, which is\nlinked to opposite collective atomic displacements across different layers.\nThis phase difference induces a spiral arrangement of the Q-vectors, ultimately\ngiving rise to a chiral structure in real space. We validate our framework by\napplying it to the kagome lattice AV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ (A = K, Rb, Cs),\nsuccessfully predicting emergent structural chirality. To demonstrate the\ngenerality of our approach, we extend it to predict chiral CDWs in the\ntriangular-lattice NbSe$_{2}$. Beyond material predictions, our theory uncovers\na universal and unprecedented Hall effect in chiral CDW materials, occurring\nwithout external magnetic fields or intrinsic magnetization. Our experiments on\nCsV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ confirm this prediction, observing a unique signature where\nthe Hall conductivity's sign reverses when the input current is reversed, a\nphenomenon distinct from known Hall effects. Our findings elucidate the\nmechanisms behind chiral CDWs and open new avenues for discovering materials\nwith unconventional quantum properties, with potential applications in\nnext-generation electronic and spintronic devices.",

However, the scarcity and quality limitations of\ngraph data present challenges to their training process in practical settings.\nTo facilitate the development of effective GNNs, companies and researchers\noften seek external collaboration. Yet, directly sharing data raises privacy\nconcerns, motivating data owners to train GNNs on their private graphs and\nshare the trained models. Unfortunately, these models may still inadvertently\ndisclose sensitive properties of their training graphs (e.g., average default\nrate in a transaction network), leading to severe consequences for data owners.\nIn this work, we study graph property inference attack to identify the risk of\nsensitive property information leakage from shared models. Existing approaches\ntypically train numerous shadow models for developing such attack, which is\ncomputationally intensive and impractical. To address this issue, we propose an\nefficient graph property inference attack by leveraging model approximation\ntechniques. Our method only requires training a small set of models on graphs,\nwhile generating a sufficient number of approximated shadow models for attacks.\nTo enhance diversity while reducing errors in the approximated models, we apply\nedit distance to quantify the diversity within a group of approximated models\nand introduce a theoretically guaranteed criterion to evaluate each model's\nerror. Subsequently, we propose a novel selection mechanism to ensure that the\nretained approximated models achieve high diversity and low error.

Beyond spatial autoregressive entropy\nmodels, more efficient backward adaptation-based entropy models have been\nrecently developed. They not only reduce decoding time by using smaller number\nof modeling steps but also maintain or even improve rate--distortion\nperformance by leveraging more diverse contexts for backward adaptation.\nDespite their significant progress, we argue that their performance has been\nlimited by the simple adoption of the design convention for forward adaptation:\nusing only a single type of hyper latent representation, which does not provide\nsufficient contextual information, especially in the first modeling step. In\nthis paper, we propose a simple yet effective entropy modeling framework that\nleverages sufficient contexts for forward adaptation without compromising on\nbit-rate. Specifically, we introduce a strategy of diversifying hyper latent\nrepresentations for forward adaptation, i.e., using two additional types of\ncontexts along with the existing single type of context. In addition, we\npresent a method to effectively use the diverse contexts for contextualizing\nthe current elements to be encoded/decoded. By addressing the limitation of the\nprevious approach, our proposed framework leads to significant performance\nimprovements. Experimental results on popular datasets show that our proposed\nframework consistently improves rate--distortion performance across various\nbit-rate regions, e.g., 3.73% BD-rate gain over the state-of-the-art baseline\non the Kodak dataset.",

The analysis is based on the system of the Gross-Pitaevskii\nequations (GPEs) written in the rotating coordinates. The resulting GPE system\nincludes effective Zeeman splitting. In the case of the attractive\nnonlinearity, the analysis, performed by means of the imaginary-time\nsimulations, produces deformation of the known two-dimensional SOC solitons\n(semi-vortices and mixed-modes). Essentially novel findings are reported in the\ncase of the repulsive nonlinearity.

At larger Omega, the straight\nchains become unstable, being spontaneously replaced by a trilete star-shaped\narray of vortices. At still large values of Omega, the trilete pattern rebuilds\nitself into a star-shaped one formed of five and, then, seven strings. The\ntransitions between the different patterns are accounted for by comparison of\ntheir energy.

The present work focuses on a\nclass of simple programmable quantum processors for implementing reflection\noperators, i.e. $U = e^{i \\pi \\lvert\\psi\\rangle\\langle\\psi\\rvert}$ for an\narbitrary pure state $\\lvert\\psi\\rangle$ of finite dimension $d$. Unlike\nquantum programs that assume query access to $U$, our program takes the form of\nindependent copies of the state to be reflected about $\\lvert\\psi_U\\rangle =\n\\lvert\\psi\\rangle^{\\otimes n}$. We then identify the worst-case optimal\nalgorithm among all processors of the form $\\text{tr}_{\\text{Program}}[V\n(\\lvert\\phi\\rangle\\langle\\phi\\rvert \\otimes\n(\\lvert\\psi\\rangle\\langle\\psi\\rvert)^{\\otimes n}) V^\\dagger]$ where the\nalgorithm $V$ is a unitary linear combination of permutations. By generalizing\nthese algorithms to processors for arbitrary-angle rotations, $e^{i \\alpha\n\\lvert\\psi\\rangle\\langle\\psi\\rvert}$ for $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb R$, we give a\nconstruction for a universal programmable processor with better scaling in $d$.\nFor programming reflections, we obtain a tight analytical lower bound on the\nprogram dimension by bounding the Holevo information of an ensemble of\nreflections applied to an entangled probe state. The lower bound makes use of a\nblock decomposition of the uniform ensemble of reflected states with respect to\nirreps of the partially transposed permutation matrix algebra, and two\nrepresentation-theoretic conjectures based on extensive numerical evidence.",

Only a few constructions of\nsuch codes were previously known, and were primarily based on a specific\noperation from homological algebra, namely the balanced product. In contrast,\nour constructions are based on a more basic and widely used product, namely the\nhomological product (i.e. the tensor product of chain complexes). Our results\nhelp address the natural question: When do homological products preserve good\ncode distance?\n  Our first main result constructs asymptotically good\n$[[N,\\Theta(N),\\Theta(N)]]$ quantum codes with small polynomial stabilizer\nweight from homological products of codes with a property called\nproduct-expansion. This notion was recently introduced and used to bound the\ndistance of balanced product quantum codes; we apply it instead to homological\nproducts.\n  For every $\\epsilon>0$, our second main result constructs close-to-linear\ndistance $[[N,N^{1-\\epsilon},N^{1-\\epsilon}]]$ (subsystem) quantum LDPC codes\nwith constant stabilizer weight from iterated homological products of a\nconstant-sized quantum locally testable code.

Our focus is on the geometry of spin\nconfigurations, motivated by applications to programmable matter and\ncomputational biology. Rigorous results in this vein are scarce because the\nnatural setting of these applications is the low-temperature,\nfixed-magnetization regime. Recent progress in this regime is largely limited\nto spin systems under which magnetization concentrates, which enables the\nanalysis to be reduced to that of the simpler, variable-magnetization case.\nMore complicated models, like those that arise in applications, do not share\nthis property.\n  We study the geometry of spin configurations on the triangular lattice under\nthe Generalized Potts Model (GPM), which generalizes many fundamental models of\nstatistical physics, including the Ising, Potts, clock, and Blume--Capel\nmodels. Moreover, it specializes to models used to program active matter to\nsolve tasks like compression and separation, and it is closely related to the\nCellular Potts Model, widely used in computational models of biological\nprocesses. Our main result shows that, under the fixed-magnetization GPM at low\ntemperature, spins of different types are typically partitioned into regions of\nmostly one type, separated by boundaries that have nearly minimal perimeter.\nThe proof uses techniques from Pirogov--Sinai theory to extend a classic\nPeierls argument for the fixed-magnetization Ising model, and introduces a new\napproach for comparing the partition functions of fixed- and\nvariable-magnetization models.",

Recently, RFFI based on deep learning methods has\ngained popularity and is seen as a promising way to address the device\nauthentication problem for Internet of Things (IoT) systems. However, in\ncross-receiver scenarios, where the RFFI model is trained over RF signals from\nsome receivers but deployed at a new receiver, the alteration of receivers'\ncharacteristics would lead to data distribution shift and cause significant\nperformance degradation at the new receiver.

Moving forward requires developing frameworks\nthat explicitly account for adaptive reconfiguration, embrace open-ended state\nspaces, and draw inspiration from concepts like Kauffman's \"adjacent possible.\"\nThe path ahead demands mathematical and computational approaches that are\nfundamentally more dynamic and flexible than traditional network models.",

    "abstract": "The application of deep neural networks in geospatial data has become a\ntrending research problem in the present day. A significant amount of\nstatistical research has already been introduced, such as generalized least\nsquare optimization by incorporating spatial variance-covariance matrix,\nconsidering basis functions in the input nodes of the neural networks, and so\non. However, for lattice data, there is no available literature about the\nutilization of asymptotic analysis of neural networks in regression for spatial\ndata. This article proposes a consistent localized two-layer deep neural\nnetwork-based regression for spatial data. We have proved the consistency of\nthis deep neural network for bounded and unbounded spatial domains under a\nfixed sampling design of mixed-increasing spatial regions. We have proved that\nits asymptotic convergence rate is faster than that of \\cite{zhan2024neural}'s\nneural network and an improved generalization of \\cite{shen2023asymptotic}'s\nneural network structure. We empirically observe the rate of convergence of\ndiscrepancy measures between the empirical probability distribution of observed\nand predicted data, which will become faster for a less smooth spatial surface.\nWe have applied our asymptotic analysis of deep neural networks to the\nestimation of the monthly average temperature of major cities in the USA from\nits satellite image. This application is an effective showcase of non-linear\nspatial regression. We demonstrate our methodology with simulated lattice data\nin various scenarios.",

Since humanoid robots are inherently underactuated\nthanks to unilateral ground contacts, a path is considered safe if it is\nobstacle-free and respects the robot's physical limitations and underlying\ndynamics. Existing approaches often decouple path planning from gait control\ndue to the significant computational challenge caused by the full-order robot\ndynamics. In this work, we develop a unified, safe path and gait planning\nframework that can be evaluated online in real-time, allowing the robot to\nnavigate clustered environments while sustaining stable locomotion. Our\napproach uses the popular Linear Inverted Pendulum (LIP) model as a template\nmodel to represent walking dynamics. It incorporates heading angles in the\nmodel to evaluate kinematic constraints essential for physically feasible gaits\nproperly. In addition, we leverage discrete control barrier functions (DCBF)\nfor obstacle avoidance, ensuring that the subsequent foot placement provides a\nsafe navigation path within clustered environments. To guarantee real-time\ncomputation, we use a novel approximation of the DCBF to produce linear DCBF\n(LDCBF) constraints.

    "abstract": "The stability of an irreversible singularity, such as a Riemann shock to the\nfull Euler system, in the absence of any technical conditions on perturbations,\nremains a major open problem even within mono-dimensional framework. A natural\napproach to justify such stability is to consider vanishing dissipation (or\nviscosity) limits of physical viscous flows. We prove the existence of\nvanishing dissipation limits, on which a Riemann shock of small amplitude is\nstable (up to a time-dependent shift) and unique. Thus, a Riemann weak shock is\nrigid (not turbulent) under physical disturbances. We adopt the\nBrenner-Navier-Stokes-Fourier system, based on the bi-velocity theory, as a\nphysical viscous model. The key ingredient of the proof is the uniform\nstability of the viscous shock with respect to the viscosity strength. The\nuniformity is ensured by contraction estimates of any large perturbations\naround the shock. The absence of any restrictions on size of initial\nperturbations forces us to handle extreme values of density and temperature,\nwhich constitutes the most challenging part of our analysis. We use the method\nof a-contraction with shifts, but we improve it by introducing a more delicate\nanalysis of the localizing effect given by viscous shock derivatives. This\nimprovement possesses a degree of robustness that renders it applicable to a\nwide range of models. This is the first resolution for the challenging open\nproblem on the \"unconditional\" stability and uniqueness of Riemann shock\nsolutions to the full Euler system in a class of vanishing physical dissipation\nlimits.",

    "abstract": "Occupational mobility is an emergent strategy to cope with technological\nunemployment by facilitating efficient labor redeployment. However, previous\nstudies analyzing networks show that the boundaries to smooth mobility are\nconstrained by a fragmented structure in the occupation network. In this study,\npositing that this structure will significantly change due to automation, we\npropose the skill automation view, which asserts that automation substitutes\nfor skills, not for occupations, and simulate a scenario of skill automation\ndrawing on percolation theory. We sequentially remove skills from the\noccupation-skill bipartite network and investigate the structural changes in\nthe projected occupation network. The results show that the accumulation of\nsmall changes (the emergence of bridges between occupations due to skill\nautomation) triggers significant structural changes in the occupation network.\nThe structural changes accelerate as the components integrate into a new giant\ncomponent. This result suggests that automation mitigates the bottlenecks to\nsmooth occupational mobility.",

    "abstract": "Efficient exploration is crucial in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement\nlearning (MARL), especially in sparse-reward settings. However, due to the\nreliance on the unimodal policy, existing methods are prone to falling into the\nlocal optima, hindering the effective exploration of better policies.\nFurthermore, in sparse-reward settings, each agent tends to receive a scarce\nreward, which poses significant challenges to inter-agent cooperation. This not\nonly increases the difficulty of policy learning but also degrades the overall\nperformance of multi-agent tasks. To address these issues, we propose a\nConsistency Policy with Intention Guidance (CPIG), with two primary components:\n(a) introducing a multimodal policy to enhance the agent's exploration\ncapability, and (b) sharing the intention among agents to foster agent\ncooperation. For component (a), CPIG incorporates a Consistency model as the\npolicy, leveraging its multimodal nature and stochastic characteristics to\nfacilitate exploration. Regarding component (b), we introduce an Intention\nLearner to deduce the intention on the global state from each agent's local\nobservation. This intention then serves as a guidance for the Consistency\nPolicy, promoting cooperation among agents. The proposed method is evaluated in\nmulti-agent particle environments (MPE) and multi-agent MuJoCo (MAMuJoCo).\nEmpirical results demonstrate that our method not only achieves comparable\nperformance to various baselines in dense-reward environments but also\nsignificantly enhances performance in sparse-reward settings, outperforming\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms by 20%.",

Optical\nshots were less spread than X-ray shots. The amplitude of X-ray shots was the\nhighest at the onset of the outburst, and they faded at the transition to the\nintermediate state. The timescale of shots was $\\sim$0.2 s, and we detected the\nabrupt spectral hardening synchronized with this steep flaring event. The time\nevolution of optical shots was not similar to that of X-ray shots. These\nresults suggest that accreting gas blobs triggered a series of magnetic\nreconnections at the hot inner accretion flow in the vicinity of the black\nhole, which enhanced X-ray emission and generated flaring events. The rapid\nX-ray spectral hardening would be caused by this kind of magnetic activity.\nAlso, the synchrotron emission not only at the hot flow but also at the jet\nplasma would contribute to the optical rapid variability. We also found that\nthe low/hard state exhibited six different phases in the hardness-intensity\ndiagram and the correlation plot between the optical flux and the X-ray\nhardness. The amplitude and duration of X-ray shots varied in synchrony with\nthese phases. This time variation may provide key information about the\nevolution of the hot flow, the low-temperature outer disk, and the jet-emitting\nplasma.",

This direct process is scrutinized using a non-adiabatic Faddeev\nhyperspherical harmonics $R$-matrix expansion method, and the derived reaction\nrates are discussed. After reviewing the model, the resultant\nphoto-disintegration of $^{12}$C($2^+_1\\rightarrow 0^+$) is shown to be much\nsmaller than the values predicted by the adiabatic models for $0.15 \\le E \\le\n0.35$ MeV. Despite the large difference, the derived reaction rates are\nillustrated to be concordant with the current evaluated rates for $0.08 \\le T_9\n\\le 3$. The difference below $E=0.20$ MeV can be seen in the rates for $T_9 \\le\n0.07$. In comparison with the calculations, the rates are found to be reduced\nby a factor of 10$^{-4}$ at $T_9=0.05$, because of an accurate description for\n$^8$Be break-up. Uncertainties of the rates are also estimated by examining the\nsensitivity to the 3$\\alpha$ potentials.

One promising use case of this effect would be the\nnonword-to-image generation task which attempts to generate images intuitively\nimaginable from a non-existing word (nonword). To realize nonword-to-image\ngeneration, an existing study focused on associating nonwords with\nsimilar-sounding words. Since each nonword can have multiple similar-sounding\nwords, generating images containing their blended concepts would increase\nintuitiveness, facilitating creative activities and promoting computational\npsycholinguistics. Nevertheless, no existing study has quantitatively evaluated\nthis effect in either diffusion models or the nonword-to-image generation\nparadigm. Therefore, this paper first analyzes the conceptual blending in a\npretrained diffusion model, Stable Diffusion. The analysis reveals that a high\npercentage of generated images depict blended concepts when inputting an\nembedding interpolating between the text embeddings of two text prompts\nreferring to different concepts. Next, this paper explores the best text\nembedding space conversion method of an existing nonword-to-image generation\nframework to ensure both the occurrence of conceptual blending and image\ngeneration quality. We compare the conventional direct prediction approach with\nthe proposed method that combines $k$-nearest neighbor search and linear\nregression. Evaluation reveals that the enhanced accuracy of the embedding\nspace conversion by the proposed method improves the image generation quality,\nwhile the emergence of conceptual blending could be attributed mainly to the\nspecific dimensions of the high-dimensional text embedding space.",

However, the other three (S03065,\nS12631, S16873) are semi-detached binaries with a lobe-filling secondary where\nthe mass transfer between the components should cause the period to increase if\nthe angular momentum is conservative.

As a key\ncontribution, we introduce vMF-Contact, a novel architecture for learning\nhierarchical contact grasp representations with probabilistic modeling of\ndirectional uncertainty as von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution. To achieve\nthis, we analyze the theoretical formulation of the second-order objective on\nthe posterior parametrization, providing formal guarantees for the model's\nability to quantify uncertainty and improve grasp prediction performance.\nMoreover, we enhance feature expressiveness by applying partial point\nreconstructions as an auxiliary task, improving the comprehension of\nuncertainty quantification as well as the generalization to unseen objects. In\nthe real-world experiments, our method demonstrates a significant improvement\nby 39% in the overall clearance rate compared to the baselines.

    "abstract": "Run-time steering strategies like Medprompt are valuable for guiding large\nlanguage models (LLMs) to top performance on challenging tasks. Medprompt\ndemonstrates that a general LLM can be focused to deliver state-of-the-art\nperformance on specialized domains like medicine by using a prompt to elicit a\nrun-time strategy involving chain of thought reasoning and ensembling. OpenAI's\no1-preview model represents a new paradigm, where a model is designed to do\nrun-time reasoning before generating final responses. We seek to understand the\nbehavior of o1-preview on a diverse set of medical challenge problem\nbenchmarks. Following on the Medprompt study with GPT-4, we systematically\nevaluate the o1-preview model across various medical benchmarks. Notably, even\nwithout prompting techniques, o1-preview largely outperforms the GPT-4 series\nwith Medprompt. We further systematically study the efficacy of classic prompt\nengineering strategies, as represented by Medprompt, within the new paradigm of\nreasoning models. We found that few-shot prompting hinders o1's performance,\nsuggesting that in-context learning may no longer be an effective steering\napproach for reasoning-native models. While ensembling remains viable, it is\nresource-intensive and requires careful cost-performance optimization. Our cost\nand accuracy analysis across run-time strategies reveals a Pareto frontier,\nwith GPT-4o representing a more affordable option and o1-preview achieving\nstate-of-the-art performance at higher cost. Although o1-preview offers top\nperformance, GPT-4o with steering strategies like Medprompt retains value in\nspecific contexts. Moreover, we note that the o1-preview model has reached\nnear-saturation on many existing medical benchmarks, underscoring the need for\nnew, challenging benchmarks. We close with reflections on general directions\nfor inference-time computation with LLMs.",

We model airspace and air infrastructure as a\ncollection of contiguous regions with constraints on the number of vehicles\nthat simultaneously enter, stay, or exit each region.

We seek to\ncompute a competitive equilibrium that ensures that: (i) capacity constraints\nare satisfied, (ii) a strictly positive resource price implies that the sector\ncapacity is fully utilized, and (iii) the allocation is integral and optimal\nfor each AAM vehicle given current prices, without requiring access to\nindividual vehicle utilities. However, a competitive equilibrium with integral\nallocations may not always exist.

    "abstract": "Accurately assessing failure risk due to asset deterioration and/or extreme\nevents is essential for efficient transportation asset management. Traditional\nrisk assessment is conducted for individual assets by either focusing on the\neconomic risk to asset owners or relying on empirical proxies of systemwide\nconsequences. Risk assessment directly based on system performance (e.g.,\nnetwork capacity) is largely limited due to (1) an exponentially increasing\nnumber of system states for accurate performance evaluation, (2) potential\ncontribution of system states with low likelihood yet high consequences (i.e.,\n\"gray swan\" events) to system state, and (3) lack of actionable information for\nasset management from risk assessment results. To address these challenges,\nthis paper introduces a novel approach to performance-based risk assessment for\nlarge-scale transportation networks. The new approach is underpinned by the\nTransitional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (TMCMC) method, a sequential sampling\ntechnique originally developed for Bayesian updating. The risk assessment\nproblem is reformulated such that (1) the system risk becomes the normalizing\nterm (i.e., evidence) of a high-dimensional posterior distribution, and (2) the\nfinal posterior samples from TMCMC yield risk-based importance measures for\ndifferent assets. Two types of analytical examples are developed to demonstrate\nthe effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach as the number of\nassets increases and the influence of gray swan events grows. The new approach\nis further applied in a case study on the Oregon highway network, serving as a\nreal-world example of large-scale transportation networks.",

    "abstract": "Multispectral pedestrian detection has gained significant attention in recent\nyears, particularly in autonomous driving applications. To address the\nchallenges posed by adversarial illumination conditions, the combination of\nthermal and visible images has demonstrated its advantages. However, existing\nfusion methods rely on the critical assumption that the RGB-Thermal (RGB-T)\nimage pairs are fully overlapping. These assumptions often do not hold in\nreal-world applications, where only partial overlap between images can occur\ndue to sensors configuration. Moreover, sensor failure can cause loss of\ninformation in one modality. In this paper, we propose a novel module called\nthe Hybrid Attention (HA) mechanism as our main contribution to mitigate\nperformance degradation caused by partial overlap and sensor failure, i.e. when\nat least part of the scene is acquired by only one sensor. We propose an\nimproved RGB-T fusion algorithm, robust against partial overlap and sensor\nfailure encountered during inference in real-world applications. We also\nleverage a mobile-friendly backbone to cope with resource constraints in\nembedded systems. We conducted experiments by simulating various partial\noverlap and sensor failure scenarios to evaluate the performance of our\nproposed method. The results demonstrate that our approach outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods, showcasing its superiority in handling real-world\nchallenges.",

This\nstudy proposes a scheme to process graph structure data by combining graph\nneural network (GNN), so that the model can capture the complex relationship\nbetween entities, thereby improving the knowledge consistency and reasoning\nability of the generated text.

The results\nshow that the graph-based RAG model proposed in this paper is superior to the\ntraditional generation model in terms of quality, knowledge consistency, and\nreasoning ability, especially when dealing with tasks that require\nmulti-dimensional reasoning.
