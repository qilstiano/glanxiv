    "abstract": "When language models are trained on textual data, they acquire both knowledge\nabout the structure of language as well as knowledge of facts about the world.\nAt inference time, their knowledge of facts can be leveraged to solve\ninteresting problems and perform useful knowledge work for users. It is well\nknown that language models can verbatim memorize long sequences from their\ntraining data. However, it is much less well understood how language models\nmemorize facts seen during training. In this work, we propose a new dataset to\nspecifically empower researchers to study the dual processes of fact\nmemorization and verbatim sequence memorization. The dataset consists of\nsynthetically-generated, webtext-like documents about fictional events, as well\nas question-answer pairs about the events. We conduct training experiments\nshowing how synthetic data about fictional events can be effective in teasing\napart different forms of memorization. We also document the challenges in\neffectively building realistic, fictional synthetic data.",

    "abstract": "Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has been envisioned to play a\nmore important role in future wireless networks. However, the design of ISAC\nnetworks is challenging, especially when there are multiple communication and\nsensing (C\\&S) nodes and multiple sensing targets. We investigate a multi-base\nstation (BS) ISAC network in which multiple BSs equipped with multiple antennas\nsimultaneously provide C\\&S services for multiple ground communication users\n(CUs) and targets. To enhance the overall performance of C\\&S, we formulate a\njoint user association (UA) and multi-BS transmit beamforming optimization\nproblem with the objective of maximizing the total sum rate of all CUs while\nensuring both the minimum target detection and parameter estimation\nrequirements. To efficiently solve the highly non-convex mixed integer\nnonlinear programming (MINLP) optimization problem, we propose an alternating\noptimization (AO)-based algorithm that decomposes the problem into two\nsub-problems, i.e., UA optimization and multi-BS transmit beamforming\noptimization. Inspired by large language models (LLMs) for prediction and\ninference, we propose a unified framework integrating LLMs with convex-based\noptimization methods. First, we propose a comprehensive design of prompt\nengineering, including few-shot, chain of thought, and self-reflection\ntechniques to guide LLMs in solving the binary integer programming UA\noptimization problem. Second, we utilize convex-based optimization methods to\nhandle the non-convex beamforming optimization problem based on fractional\nprogramming (FP), majorization minimization (MM), and the alternating direction\nmethod of multipliers (ADMM) with an optimized UA from LLMs. Numerical results\ndemonstrate that our proposed LLM-enabled AO-based algorithm achieves fast\nconvergence and near upper-bound performance with the GPT-o1 model,\noutperforming various benchmark schemes.",

    "abstract": "Quality-Diversity (QD) algorithms have shown remarkable success in\ndiscovering diverse, high-performing solutions, but rely heavily on\nhand-crafted behavioral descriptors that constrain exploration to predefined\nnotions of diversity. Leveraging the equivalence between policies and occupancy\nmeasures, we present a theoretically grounded approach to automatically\ngenerate behavioral descriptors by embedding the occupancy measures of policies\nin Markov Decision Processes. Our method, AutoQD, leverages random Fourier\nfeatures to approximate the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between policy\noccupancy measures, creating embeddings whose distances reflect meaningful\nbehavioral differences. A low-dimensional projection of these embeddings that\ncaptures the most behaviorally significant dimensions is then used as\nbehavioral descriptors for off-the-shelf QD methods. We prove that our\nembeddings converge to true MMD distances between occupancy measures as the\nnumber of sampled trajectories and embedding dimensions increase. Through\nexperiments in multiple continuous control tasks we demonstrate AutoQD's\nability in discovering diverse policies without predefined behavioral\ndescriptors, presenting a well-motivated alternative to prior methods in\nunsupervised Reinforcement Learning and QD optimization.

Our method also guarantees a certain degree of drafter\ninvariance with respect to the output tokens which is not supported by existing\nschemes.

We introduce in this paper an efficient\ntraining-free method for navigating and sampling from the molecular space with\na generative Chemical Language Model (CLM), while using the molecular\nsimilarity to the target as a guide. Our method leverages the contextual\nrepresentations learned from the CLM itself to estimate the molecular\nsimilarity, which is then used to adjust the autoregressive sampling strategy\nof the CLM. At each step of the decoding process, the method tracks the\ndistance of the current generations from the target and updates the logits to\nencourage the preservation of similarity in generations. We implement the\nmethod using a recently proposed $\\sim$47M parameter SMILES-based CLM,\nGP-MoLFormer, and therefore refer to the method as GP-MoLFormer-Sim, which\nenables a test-time update of the deep generative policy to reflect the\ncontextual similarity to a set of guide molecules. The method is further\nintegrated into a genetic algorithm (GA) and tested on a set of standard\nmolecular optimization benchmarks involving property optimization, molecular\nrediscovery, and structure-based drug design. Results show that,\nGP-MoLFormer-Sim, combined with GA (GP-MoLFormer-Sim+GA) outperforms existing\ntraining-free baseline methods, when the oracle remains black-box.

    "abstract": "Traditional quantum random number generators can produce only one type of\nrandom number, while the optimal distribution of random numbers for different\napplications is usually distinct. The typical solution to this challenge is\neither using different quantum phenomena for different types of random number,\nor converting one distribution of random numbers to another type. However, the\nformer solution requires multiple hardware systems, while the latter one\nsacrifices a lot of secure bits. Here, we develop a quantum random number\ngenerator that can on-demand produce three distribution types of random numbers\nat over 60 Gbits/s (Gbps) raw bits by measuring the quantum vacuum noise. After\nrandomness extraction, over 42 Gbps secure bit rate is demonstrated for uniform\nrandom numbers, and over 14 Gbps secure bit rate for Gaussian random number.\nDue to the lack of Rayleigh randomness extraction, only denoised Rayleigh raw\nbits are generated. Switching between different types of random numbers is\nachieved in electronics, which does not affect the generation rate. The random\nnumbers pass NIST and Dieharder tests, and are available for various\napplications, which can be continuously accessed via Cisco Quantum Random\nNumber web service.",

Among these, knowledge graphs are a\nform of structured human knowledge that integrate heterogeneous data sources\ninto structured representations but typically reduce complex n-ary relations to\nsimple triples, thereby losing higher-order relational details. In contrast,\nhypergraphs naturally represent n-ary relations with hyperedges, which directly\nconnect multiple entities together. Yet hypergraph representation learning\noften overlooks entity roles in hyperedges, limiting the finegrained semantic\nmodelling. To address these issues, knowledge hypergraphs and hyper-relational\nknowledge graphs combine the advantages of knowledge graphs and hypergraphs to\nbetter capture the complex structures and role-specific semantics of real world\nknowledge. This survey provides a comprehensive review of methods handling\nn-ary relational data, covering both knowledge hypergraphs and hyper-relational\nknowledge graphs literatures. We propose a two-dimensional taxonomy: the first\ndimension categorises models based on their methodology, i.e.,\ntranslation-based models, tensor factorisation-based models, deep neural\nnetwork-based models, logic rules-based models, and hyperedge expansion-based\nmodels. The second dimension classifies models according to their awareness of\nentity roles and positions in n-ary relations, dividing them into aware-less,\nposition-aware, and role-aware approaches.

Two frequencies of coherent phonon motion are resolved, a low frequency\nmode attributed through Raman measurements to the $A_{1g}$ phonon motion of a\nCu-deficient ordered vacancy compound (OVC), while the high frequency mode\noriginates from the $A_{1g}$ phonon motion in the chalcopyrite phase. The two\noscillations lead to modulations in the XUV differential absorption $\\Delta\nA(\\epsilon,\\tau)$ due to energy shifts of the Se M$_{4,5}$ edge, with a minima\noccuring approximately 1 ps after the band gap excitation. The hot carrier\ncooling time of holes and electrons are disentangled and the observed slower\ncooling of holes is attributed to the higher density of hole states in the\nvalence band. We also observe fast oscillations (18.6(3) fs period) across the\nSe absorption edge, which are interpreted to originate from quantum path\ninterference between the electronic conduction bands of the chalcopyrite CIGS\nand OVC phases, opening the possibility towards quantum coherent metrology in\nphotovoltaics on the femtosecond timescale.

Compared to He WDs formed via stable\nRoche-lobe overflow (SRLOF), those from the CE channel undergo markedly\ndifferent mass-loss histories, resulting in distinct post-CE evolutionary\nbehavior. We explore how the mass of the residual hydrogen envelope (Mh) shapes\nthe cooling evolution of CE He WDs, focusing on the role of the bifurcation\npoint in setting Mh and enabling residual hydrogen burning. Using the LPCODE\nstellar evolution code, we computed models of He WDs with masses from 0.20 to\n0.42 solar masses, evolving from post-CE conditions to the white dwarf cooling\ntrack. Two evolutionary branches emerge: (i) non-flashing sequences, which cool\nrapidly with negligible hydrogen burning, and (ii) flashing sequences, where\nhydrogen shell flashes alter the envelope structure prior to cooling.\nMinimal-envelope models cool within 5-130 million years for effective\ntemperatures between 12,000 and 27,000 K, and reach in approx. 300 million\nyears at lower temperatures, remaining much younger than SRLOF counterparts. In\ncontrast, models with more hydrogen retain active nuclear burning, delaying\ncooling and yielding ages of several billion years. Flashing sequences prolong\nthe pre-white dwarf phase, though still shorter than in SRLOF evolution. The\nvalue of Mh also affects WD mass and surface gravity estimates, introducing\nsystematic shifts with respect to SRLOF WDs.

They are evaluated on tasks such as code generation, bug\nfixing, and code-oriented question answering, to name a few. Our results show\nwhich prompting techniques are most effective for SE tasks requiring complex\nlogic and intensive reasoning versus those that rely more on contextual\nunderstanding and example-driven scenarios. We also analyze correlations\nbetween the linguistic characteristics of prompts and the factors that\ncontribute to the effectiveness of prompting techniques in enhancing\nperformance on SE tasks. Additionally, we report the time and token consumption\nfor each prompting technique when applied to a specific task and model,\noffering guidance for practitioners in selecting the optimal prompting\ntechnique for their use cases.",

    "abstract": "The quasar correlation function assesses the occurrence of quasar pairs as a\nfunction of separation, which is strongly influenced by quasar host halo\nmasses. The empirical Trinity model recently inferred the redshift-dependent\nrelationship between supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass, galaxy mass, and halo\nmass, using constraints other than correlation functions (e.g., quasar\nluminosity functions, active galactic nuclei occupation fractions, and SMBH\nmass-bulge mass relations). Hence, comparing the predicted quasar correlation\nfunctions from Trinity to real observations is an important test of Trinity's\ninferred SMBH -- halo relation. In this work, we use a compilation of observed\ntwo-point projected and redshift-space correlation functions from $0 \\leq z\n\\leq 3.5$. We find that Trinity accurately predicts quasar correlation\nfunctions within observed error bars, although observations do not have much\nconstraining power at lower redshifts due to smaller observable volumes and\nlower quasar number densities. This finding is consistent with Trinity having\nthe correct placement of quasars within their host galaxies and dark matter\nhalos, without requiring quasar clustering constraints during model fitting.\nUsing Trinity, we also predict the clustering as a function of quasar\nbolometric luminosity, finding that existing survey uncertainties are too large\nto show measurable differences ($\\lesssim 0.3$ dex change in bias for $10^{42}$\nerg s$^{-1}$ compared to $10^{46}$ erg s$^{-1}$ SMBHs across redshifts). This\nfact arises because most SMBH growth (and hence quasar luminosity) occurs in\nhalos in a similar mass range ($10^{12}-10^{13} M_\\odot$).",

Current AI systems flatten these human choices into reproducible\npatterns without preserving their provenance. We propose that HCI's role lies\nnot only in perfecting visual output, but in developing means to document the\norigins and evolution of artistic style as it appears within generated visual\ntraces.

It does so by decomposing the\nevolution into pathways between the computational basis states, where each\npathway has an associated complex amplitude. The magnitude of a pathway\namplitude determines its significance and many pathways constructively and/or\ndestructively interfere to produce the final evolution of the system. In this\npaper, we apply Hamiltonian encoding to reveal the mechanism behind creating\nqubit gates implemented via optimal control pulses. An X gate, two CNOT gates,\nand a SWAP gate are examined to determine the degree of interference involved\nand to demonstrate that different optimal controls produce distinct mechanisms.\nAlthough the detailed mechanism for creating any gate depends on the nature of\nthe control field, the mechanism analysis tools are generic. The presented\ngates and their mechanisms in this paper are thus illustrative and a researcher\nmay apply these same tools to any gate with a suitable optimal control field.",

A simple yet flexible diffusionbased framework,\nnamed UniRes, is proposed to address such degradations in an end-to-end manner.\nIt combines several specialized models during the diffusion sampling steps,\nhence transferring the knowledge from several well-isolated restoration tasks\nto the restoration of complex in-the-wild degradations. This only requires\nwell-isolated training data for several degradation types. The framework is\nflexible as extensions can be added through a unified formulation, and the\nfidelity-quality trade-off can be adjusted through a new paradigm.

To address these limitations, we\npropose a sequential procedure to orient undirected edges in a completed\npartial DAG (CPDAG), representing an equivalence class of DAGs, by leveraging\nthe pairwise additive noise model (PANM) to identify their causal directions.\nWe prove that this procedure can recover the true causal DAG assuming a\nrestricted ANM. Building on this result, we develop a novel constraint-based\nalgorithm for learning causal DAGs under nonlinear ANMs. Given an estimated\nCPDAG, we develop a ranking procedure that sorts undirected edges by their\nadherence to the PANM, which defines an evaluation order of the edges. To\ndetermine the edge direction, we devise a statistical test that compares the\nlog-likelihood values, evaluated with respect to the competing directions, of a\nsub-graph comprising just the candidate nodes and their identified parents in\nthe partial DAG.

Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that TabFlex can achieve over a\n2x speedup compared to TabPFN and a 1.5x speedup over XGBoost, outperforming 25\ntested baselines in terms of efficiency across a diverse range of datasets.\nFurthermore, TabFlex remains highly effective on large-scale datasets,\ndelivering strong performance with significantly reduced computational costs,\nespecially when combined with data-efficient techniques such as dimensionality\nreduction and data sampling.",

To address this challenge we propose a workflow that makes\nuse of natural language processing (NLP) to query a database technology and\nreturn a response in natural language. Our solution utilizes Large Language\nModels (LLMs) that are sized for edge devices to perform NLP as well as\ngraphical databases which are well suited for dynamic connected networks which\nare pervasive in the IoBT. Our architecture employs LLMs for both mapping\nquestions in natural language to Cypher database queries as well as to\nsummarize the database output back to the user in natural language. We evaluate\nseveral medium sized LLMs for both of these tasks on a database representing\npublicly available data from the US Army's Multipurpose Sensing Area (MSA) at\nthe Jornada Range in Las Cruces, NM.

PartCrafter builds upon a pretrained 3D mesh\ndiffusion transformer (DiT) trained on whole objects, inheriting the pretrained\nweights, encoder, and decoder, and introduces two key innovations: (1) A\ncompositional latent space, where each 3D part is represented by a set of\ndisentangled latent tokens; (2) A hierarchical attention mechanism that enables\nstructured information flow both within individual parts and across all parts,\nensuring global coherence while preserving part-level detail during generation.\nTo support part-level supervision, we curate a new dataset by mining part-level\nannotations from large-scale 3D object datasets.

Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) mounted microwave radiometry\npresents a promising alternative, but most evaluations to date have focused on\nagricultural settings, with limited exploration across other land covers and\nfew efforts to quantify retrieval uncertainty. This study addresses both gaps\nby evaluating SM retrievals from a drone-based Portable L-band Radiometer\n(PoLRa) across shrubland, bare soil, and forest strips in Central Illinois,\nU.S., using a 10-day field campaign in 2024. Controlled UAV flights at\naltitudes of 10 m, 20 m, and 30 m were performed to generate brightness\ntemperatures (TB) at spatial resolutions of 7 m, 14 m, and 21 m. SM retrievals\nwere carried out using multiple tau-omega-based algorithms, including the\nsingle channel algorithm (SCA), dual channel algorithm (DCA), and\nmulti-temporal dual channel algorithm (MTDCA). A Bayesian inference framework\nwas then applied to provide probabilistic uncertainty characterization for both\nSM and vegetation optical depth (VOD). Results show that the gridded TB\ndistributions consistently capture dry-wet gradients associated with vegetation\ndensity variations, and spatial correlations between polarized observations are\nlargely maintained across scales. Validation against in situ measurements\nindicates that PoLRa derived SM retrievals from the SCAV and MTDCA algorithms\nachieve unbiased root-mean-square errors (ubRMSE) generally below 0.04 m3/m3\nacross different land covers. Bayesian posterior analyses confirm that\nreference SM values largely fall within the derived uncertainty intervals, with\nmean uncertainty ranges around 0.02 m3/m3 and 0.11 m3/m3 for SCA and DCA\nrelated retrievals.",

This provides additional supervision signals in the\ncamera-visible space, allowing 2D labels to improve the learning of 3D\nsemantics.

Our method can be seamlessly integrated into various existing occupancy\nmodels, enhancing performance without increasing inference time.

We then introduce direct\nsampling of Gaussian primitive positions and shapes, incrementally spawning\nprimitives where required, significantly accelerating training. These two\nefficient steps allow fast and robust joint optimization of poses and Gaussian\nprimitives. Our incremental approach handles large-scale scenes by introducing\nscalable radiance field construction, progressively clustering 3DGS primitives,\nstoring them in anchors, and offloading them from the GPU. Clustered primitives\nare progressively merged, keeping the required scale of 3DGS at any viewpoint.\nWe evaluate our solution on a variety of datasets and show that our solution\ncan provide on-the-fly processing of all the capture scenarios and scene sizes\nwe target while remaining competitive with other methods that only handle\nspecific capture styles or scene sizes in speed, image quality, or both.",

The simulations are performed using\nnon-additive isotropic ab initio two-body, three-body, and four-body potential\nenergy surfaces (PES).

With the four-body interaction energy, we predict an equilibrium\ndensity of $ 0.02608 \\, {\\r{A}}^{-3} $, very close to the experimental result\nof $ 0.0261 \\, {\\r{A}}^{-3} $. The inclusion of the four-body interaction\nenergy also brings the simulation results in excellent agreement with the\nexperimental pressure-density data until around $ 0.065 \\, {\\r{A}}^{-3} $,\nbeyond which the simulation results overestimate the pressure. These PESs\noverestimate the average kinetic energy per molecule at the equilibrium density\nby about $ 7 \\% $ compared to the experimental result. Our findings suggest\nthat, at higher densities, we require five-body and higher-order many-body\ninteractions to quantitatively improve the agreement between the\npressure-density curve produced by simulations, and that of experiment. Using\nthe four-body PES during sampling at excessively high densities, where such\nhigher-order many-body interactions are likely to be significant, causes an\nartificial symmetry breaking in the hcp lattice structure of the solid.",

DART-Vetter is a Convolutional Neural Network that\nprocesses only the light curves folded on the period of the relative signal,\nfeaturing a simpler and more compact architecture with respect to other\ntriaging and/or vetting models available in the literature. We trained and\ntested DART-Vetter on several dataset of publicly available and homogeneously\nlabelled TESS and Kepler light curves in order to prove the effectiveness of\nour model. Despite its simplicity, DART-Vetter achieves highly competitive\ntriaging performance, with a recall rate of 91% on an ensemble of TESS and\nKepler data, when compared to Exominer and Astronet-Triage.

To gain\ndeeper insight into how protein complexes modulate their stability, we\ninvestigated a model system with a well-characterized and fast evolutionary\nhistory: a set of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein variants bound to the human ACE2\nreceptor, for which experimental binding affinity data are available. Through\nMolecular Dynamics simulations, we analyzed both structural and dynamical\ndifferences between the unbound (apo) and bound (holo) forms of the spike\nprotein across several variants of concern. Our findings indicate that a more\nstable binding is associated with proteins that exhibit higher rigidity in\ntheir unbound state and display dynamical patterns similar to that observed\nafter binding to ACE2. The increase of binding stability is not the sole\ndriving force of SARS-CoV-2 evolution. More recent variants are characterized\nby a more dynamical behavior that determines a less efficient viral entry but\ncould optimize other traits, such as antibody escape.

    "abstract": "Computer vision is largely based on 2D techniques, with 3D vision still\nrelegated to a relatively narrow subset of applications. However, by building\non recent advances in 3D models such as neural radiance fields, some authors\nhave shown that 3D techniques can at last improve outputs extracted from\nindependent 2D views, by fusing them into 3D and denoising them. This is\nparticularly helpful in egocentric videos, where the camera motion is\nsignificant, but only under the assumption that the scene itself is static. In\nfact, as shown in the recent analysis conducted by EPIC Fields, 3D techniques\nare ineffective when it comes to studying dynamic phenomena, and, in\nparticular, when segmenting moving objects. In this paper, we look into this\nissue in more detail. First, we propose to improve dynamic segmentation in 3D\nby fusing motion segmentation predictions from a 2D-based model into layered\nradiance fields (Layered Motion Fusion). However, the high complexity of long,\ndynamic videos makes it challenging to capture the underlying geometric\nstructure, and, as a result, hinders the fusion of motion cues into the\n(incomplete) scene geometry. We address this issue through test-time\nrefinement, which helps the model to focus on specific frames, thereby reducing\nthe data complexity. This results in a synergy between motion fusion and the\nrefinement, and in turn leads to segmentation predictions of the 3D model that\nsurpass the 2D baseline by a large margin. This demonstrates that 3D techniques\ncan enhance 2D analysis even for dynamic phenomena in a challenging and\nrealistic setting.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in our understanding of foundations of quantum mechanics have\nshown that information can be made objective through quantum states. Such\nobjectification processes, predicted e.g. in a variety of quantum open systems,\nmust accompany any realistic quantum-to-classical transition mechanism in order\nto reproduce the objective character of the classical limit of our world.\nHowever, so far only examples of simple, unstructured information, such as a\nvalue of an observable, have been studied. In this work we show that a more\ncomplicated form of information, given by a Cartesian reference frame, can also\nbe made (at least partially) objective in quantum mechanics. The non-trivial\ninternal gauge structure of reference frames, given by the transformation\ngroup, leads to a more general form of objectivity, where all observers see the\nsame but modulo their relative orientations, like it happens in modern\nunderstanding of geometry. This opens a way to extend quantum objectivity\nbeyond simple scenarios and possibly link it to the foundations of modern\ngeometry.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces the MPS (Model Prediction Set), a novel framework for\nonline model selection for nonstationary time series. Classical model selection\nmethods, such as information criteria and cross-validation, rely heavily on the\nstationarity assumption and often fail in dynamic environments which undergo\ngradual or abrupt changes over time. Yet real-world data are rarely stationary,\nand model selection under nonstationarity remains a largely open problem. To\ntackle this challenge, we combine conformal inference with model confidence\nsets to develop a procedure that adaptively selects models best suited to the\nevolving dynamics at any given time. Concretely, the MPS updates in real time a\nconfidence set of candidate models that covers the best model for the next time\nperiod with a specified long-run probability, while adapting to nonstationarity\nof unknown forms. Through simulations and real-world data analysis, we\ndemonstrate that MPS reliably and efficiently identifies optimal models under\nnonstationarity, an essential capability lacking in offline methods. Moreover,\nMPS frequently produces high-quality sets with small cardinality, whose\nevolution offers deeper insights into changing dynamics. As a generic\nframework, MPS accommodates any data-generating process, data structure, model\nclass, training method, and evaluation metric, making it broadly applicable\nacross diverse problem settings.",

We then carry out a\ncradle-to-gate assessment for a nickel manganese cobalt 811 battery with a\nsilicon-coated graphite anode, analyzing how variations in the carbon intensity\nof the electricity mix affect emissions, with case studies for China, South\nKorea, and Sweden. Finally, we develop a set of regression models that link\nannual battery production and the carbon intensity of China's electricity mix\nto the average mass-specific emissions observed each year. The meta-analysis\nshows a median global warming potential of 17.63 kg CO2-eq./kg of battery, with\na standard deviation of 7.34. Differences in electricity mix mainly influence\nemissions from the energy-intensive cell production, particularly from cathode\nmaterial processing. We found that a multivariate linear regression using\nproduction volume and the carbon intensity of the Chinese electricity mix as\npredictors explains emissions with moderate accuracy. The environmental impact\nof battery manufacturing can be reduced by using clean energy sources in\nproduction processes. However, achieving substantial reductions requires clean\nenergy throughout the entire supply chain, as importing materials from regions\nwith carbon-intensive electricity mixes can undermine these efforts.

We then prove that many SGNNs are incomplete\neven on graphs with distinct eigenvalues. To mitigate this deficiency, we adapt\nrotation equivariant neural networks to the graph spectra setting to propose a\nmethod to provably improve SGNNs' expressivity on simple spectrum graphs. We\nempirically verify our theoretical claims via an image classification\nexperiment on the MNIST Superpixel dataset and eigenvector canonicalization on\ngraphs from ZINC.",

    "abstract": "Biological and psychological concepts have inspired reinforcement learning\nalgorithms to create new complex behaviors that expand agents' capacity. These\nbehaviors can be seen in the rise of techniques like goal decomposition,\ncurriculum, and intrinsic rewards, which have paved the way for these complex\nbehaviors. One limitation in evaluating these methods is the requirement for\nengineered extrinsic for realistic environments. A central challenge in\nengineering the necessary reward function(s) comes from these environments\ncontaining states that carry high negative rewards, but provide no feedback to\nthe agent. Death is one such stimuli that fails to provide direct feedback to\nthe agent. In this work, we introduce an intrinsic reward function inspired by\nearly amygdala development and produce this intrinsic reward through a novel\nmemory-augmented neural network (MANN) architecture. We show how this intrinsic\nmotivation serves to deter exploration of terminal states and results in\navoidance behavior similar to fear conditioning observed in animals.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate how modifying a threshold where the fear response\nis active produces a range of behaviors that are described under the paradigm\nof general anxiety disorders (GADs). We demonstrate this behavior in the\nMiniworld Sidewalk environment, which provides a partially observable Markov\ndecision process (POMDP) and a sparse reward with a non-descriptive terminal\ncondition, i.e., death. In effect, this study results in a\nbiologically-inspired neural architecture and framework for fear conditioning\nparadigms; we empirically demonstrate avoidance behavior in a constructed agent\nthat is able to solve environments with non-descriptive terminal conditions.",

    "abstract": "Flow models transform data gradually from one modality (e.g. noise) onto\nanother (e.g. images). Such models are parameterized by a time-dependent\nvelocity field, trained to fit segments connecting pairs of source and target\npoints. When the pairing between source and target points is given, training\nflow models boils down to a supervised regression problem. When no such pairing\nexists, as is the case when generating data from noise, training flows is much\nharder. A popular approach lies in picking source and target points\nindependently. This can, however, lead to velocity fields that are slow to\ntrain, but also costly to integrate at inference time. In theory, one would\ngreatly benefit from training flow models by sampling pairs from an optimal\ntransport (OT) measure coupling source and target, since this would lead to a\nhighly efficient flow solving the Benamou and Brenier dynamical OT problem. In\npractice, recent works have proposed to sample mini-batches of $n$ source and\n$n$ target points and reorder them using an OT solver to form better pairs.\nThese works have advocated using batches of size $n\\approx 256$, and considered\nOT solvers that return couplings that are either sharp (using e.g. the\nHungarian algorithm) or blurred (using e.g. entropic regularization, a.k.a.\nSinkhorn). We follow in the footsteps of these works by exploring the benefits\nof increasing $n$ by three to four orders of magnitude, and look more carefully\non the effect of the entropic regularization $\\varepsilon$ used in the Sinkhorn\nalgorithm. Our analysis is facilitated by new scale invariant quantities to\nreport the sharpness of a coupling, while our sharded computations across\nmultiple GPU or GPU nodes allow scaling up $n$. We show that in both synthetic\nand image generation tasks, flow models greatly benefit when fitted with large\nSinkhorn couplings, with a low entropic regularization $\\varepsilon$.",

In the literature,\nstate partitioning abstractions based on (bi)simulation and property-preserving\nstate relations have been successfully applied to abstract model checking.\nHere, we pursue a different track in which model checking is seen as an\ninstance of program verification. To this purpose, we introduce a suitable\nlanguage-called MOKA (for MOdel checking as abstract interpretation of Kleene\nAlgebras)-which is used to encode temporal formulae as programs. In particular,\nwe show that (universal fragments of) temporal logics, such as ACTL or, more\ngenerally, universal mu-calculus can be transformed into MOKA programs. Such\nprograms return all and only the initial states which violate the formula. By\napplying abstract interpretation to MOKA programs, we pave the way for reusing\nmore general abstractions than partitions as well as for tuning the precision\nof the abstraction to remove or avoid false alarms. We show how to perform\nmodel checking via a program logic that combines under-approximation and\nabstract interpretation analysis to avoid false alarms. The notion of locally\ncomplete abstraction is used to dynamically improve the analysis precision via\ncounterexample-guided domain refinement.",

    "abstract": "Cyclic loading is a common feature in poroelastic systems, the material\nresponse depending non-trivially on the exact form of boundary conditions, pore\nstructure, and mechanical properties. The situation becomes more complex when\nheterogeneity is introduced in the properties of the poroelastic material, yet\nheterogeneity too is common in physical poroelastic structures. In this paper,\nwe analyse the behaviour of a soft porous material in response to a uniaxial\ncyclic stress or displacement, with a focus on understanding how this response\nis affected by continuous heterogeneity in the stiffness or permeability. Our\nwork is motivated by observed altered material properties of the diseased\ntendon, but the framework we develop and analyse is generically applicable. We\nconstruct a one-dimensional non-linear poroelastic model, assuming Darcy flow\nthrough the pores of the solid skeleton which we assume has neo-Hookean\nelasticity. The system is driven by an applied uniaxial cyclic stress or a\nuniaxial cyclic displacement at one boundary. Heterogeneity in the stiffness or\npermeability profile is imposed via a Gaussian bump function. By exploring a\nrange of loading frequencies together with magnitudes and locations of\nheterogeneity, we characterise the effect of heterogeneity on the response of\nthe material, and show that the response of the system to an applied stress is\nqualitatively distinct from the response to an applied displacement. Our\nanalysis of this simple model provides a foundation for understanding how\nheterogeneity affects the poroelastic response to cyclic loading.",

Second, they narrowly focus on\nmathematical problem-solving, neglecting the broader spectrum of reasoning\nskills -- including abstract, physical, planning, spatial, and temporal\ncapabilities -- required for robust multimodal intelligence. Third, many\nbenchmarks quickly saturate, offering limited headroom for diagnosing failure\nmodes or measuring continued progress. We introduce MORSE-500 (Multimodal\nReasoning Stress-test Environment), a video benchmark composed of 500 fully\nscripted clips with embedded questions spanning six complementary reasoning\ncategories. Each instance is programmatically generated using deterministic\nPython scripts (via Manim, Matplotlib, MoviePy), generative video models, and\ncurated real footage. This script-driven design allows fine-grained control\nover visual complexity, distractor density, and temporal dynamics -- enabling\ndifficulty to be scaled systematically as models improve. Unlike static\nbenchmarks that become obsolete once saturated, MORSE-500 is built to evolve:\nits controllable generation pipeline supports the creation of arbitrarily\nchallenging new instances, making it ideally suited for stress-testing\nnext-generation models. Initial experiments with state-of-the-art systems --\nincluding various Gemini 2.5 Pro and OpenAI o3 which represent the strongest\navailable at the time, alongside strong open-source models -- reveal\nsubstantial performance gaps across all categories, with particularly large\ndeficits in abstract and planning tasks.

    "abstract": "Inspired by a common technique for shuffling a deck of cards on a table\nwithout riffling, we continue the study of a prequel paper on the pile shuffle\nand its capabilities as a sorting device. We study two sort feasibility\nproblems of general interest concerning pile shuffle, first introduced in the\nprequel. These problems are characterized by: (1) bounds on the number of\nsequential rounds of shuffle, and piles created in each round; (2) the use of a\nheterogeneous mixture of queue-like and stack-like piles, as when each round of\nshuffle may have a combination of face-up and face-down piles; and (3) the\nability of the dealer to choose the types of piles used during each round of\nshuffle. We prove by a sequence of reductions from the Boolean satisfiability\nproblem (SAT) that the more general problem is NP-Hard. We leave as an open\nquestion the complexity of its arguably more natural companion, but discuss\navenues for further investigation. Our analysis leverages a novel framework,\nintroduced herein, which equates instances of shuffle to members of a\nparticular class of deterministic finite automata.",

Recently, chaotic mixtures of multiple overlapping eruptions\nwith varying amplitudes have been observed in eRO-QPE1 obs1-features not\nreported in any other known QPE sources. This complex behavior presents a\nchallenge to the existing QPE models. In this paper, we propose that the\noverlapping features may be the result of gravitational lensing. We analyze the\nlight curve of eRO-QPE1 and compare its features to predictions from\ngravitational lensing scenarios. We discuss the implications for the trigger\nmechanism of QPEs in general.

However, traditional methods\nrelying on preplanned recovery motions, simplified dynamics or sparse rewards\noften fail to produce robust recovery policies. This paper presents a\nlearning-based framework integrating Episode-based Dynamic Reward Shaping and\ncurriculum learning, which dynamically balances exploration of diverse recovery\nmaneuvers with precise posture refinement. An asymmetric actor-critic\narchitecture accelerates training by leveraging privileged information in\nsimulation, while noise-injected observations enhance robustness against\nuncertainties. We further demonstrate that synergistic wheel-leg coordination\nreduces joint torque consumption by 15.8% and 26.2% and improves stabilization\nthrough energy transfer mechanisms. Extensive evaluations on two distinct\nquadruped platforms achieve recovery success rates up to 99.1% and 97.8%\nwithout platform-specific tuning.

Here we introduce novel input and output layers\nthat respect physical laws and symmetries on the staggered grids, and for the\nfirst time systematically investigate how these constraints, individually and\nin combination, affect the accuracy of PDE surrogates. We focus on two\nchallenging problems: shallow water equations with closed boundaries and\ndecaying incompressible turbulence. Compared to strong baselines, symmetries\nand physical constraints consistently improve performance across tasks,\narchitectures, autoregressive prediction steps, accuracy measures, and network\nsizes. Symmetries are more effective than physical constraints, but surrogates\nwith both performed best, even compared to baselines with data augmentation or\npushforward training, while themselves benefiting from the pushforward trick.\nDoubly-constrained surrogates also generalize better to initial conditions and\ndurations beyond the range of the training data, and more accurately predict\nreal-world ocean currents.",

      "Souvik Ghosh"
    ],
    "abstract": "Understanding the influence of realistic noise on quantum algorithms is\nparamount for the advancement of quantum computation. While often modeled as\nMarkovian, environmental noise in quantum systems frequently exhibits temporal\ncorrelations, leading to non-Markovian dynamics that can significantly alter\nalgorithmic performance. This paper investigates the impact of temporally\ncorrelated dephasing noise, modeled by the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process, on\nthe fidelity of the 2-qubit Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm. We perform numerical\nsimulations using Qiskit, systematically varying the noise strength\n($\\sigma_{\\text{OU}}$) and correlation time ($\\tau_c$) of the OU process. Our\nresults demonstrate that the algorithm's fidelity exhibits a non-monotonic\ndependence on $\\tau_c$, particularly at higher noise strengths, with certain\nintermediate correlation times proving more detrimental than others. We find\nthat a standard Markovian dephasing model, matched to the single-step error\nvariance of the OU process, accurately predicts fidelity only in the limit of\nvery short correlation times. For longer correlation times, the Markovian\napproximation often overestimates the algorithm's fidelity, failing to capture\nthe complex error dynamics introduced by the noise memory. These findings\nhighlight the necessity of incorporating non-Markovian characteristics for\naccurate performance assessment of quantum algorithms on near-term devices and\nunderscore the limitations of simpler, memoryless noise models.",

However, the precise mechanism\nlinking the chiral symmetry breaking to the mass generation associated with\nquark confinement remains one of the most profound open questions in physics.\nHere, we investigate high energy proton-proton collisions at the Relativistic\nHeavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory, where those\ncollisions could liberate virtual quark-antiquark pairs from the vacuum. These\nvirtual pairs, particularly the strange quark-antiquark pairs, are initially\nquantum spin-entangled and later undergo quark confinement to form hadrons such\nas $\\Lambda$ hyperons. In this Letter, we report the first evidence of spin\ncorrelation of $\\Lambda\\bar{\\Lambda}$ hyperon pairs measured by the STAR\nexperiment at RHIC - a relative polarization signal of $(18 \\pm 4)\\%$ that\nlinks the spin-entangled quark pairs of the Quantum Chromodynamic (QCD) vacuum\nto their final-state hadron counterparts. Crucially, this correlation vanishes\nwhen the hyperon pairs are widely separated in angle, consistent with the\ndecoherence of the quantum system.

We depart from this paradigm by studying CP in a\nquery only setting, where prediction sets must be constructed solely from\nfinite queries to a black box generative model, introducing a new trade off\nbetween coverage, test time query budget, and informativeness.

Our finite sample algorithm is\nbuilt on two core principles: one governs the optimal query policy, and the\nother defines the optimal mapping from queried samples to prediction sets.\nRemarkably, both are rooted in the classical missing mass problem in\nstatistics. Specifically, the optimal query policy depends on the rate of\ndecay, or the derivative, of the missing mass, for which we develop a novel\nestimator. Meanwhile, the optimal mapping hinges on the missing mass itself,\nwhich we estimate using Good Turing estimators.

Thus,\nwe consider the problem of hierarchical clustering given auxiliary information\nfrom natural oracles.

Traditionally, this cost has been\nmitigated through empirical or physics-based simplifications of the governing\nequations. However, such approaches often fail to retain the essential features\nof the original dynamics, particularly under strong nonequilibrium conditions.\nTo address these limitations, we develop a Petrov-Galerkin reduced-order model\n(ROM) for CR argon plasma based on oblique projections that optimally balance\nthe covariance of full-order state trajectories with that of the system's\noutput sensitivities. This construction ensures that the ROM captures both the\ndominant energetic modes and the directions most relevant to input-output\nbehavior. After offline training in a zero-dimensional setting using nonlinear\nforward and adjoint simulations, the ROM is coupled to a finite-volume solver\nand applied to one- (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) ionizing shock-tube problems.\nThe ROM achieves a 3$\\times$ reduction in state dimension and more than one\norder of magnitude savings in floating-point operations, while maintaining\nerrors below 1% for macroscopic quantities. In both 1D and 2D, it robustly\nreproduces complex unsteady plasma features -- such as periodic fluctuations,\nelectron avalanches, triple points, and cellular ionization patterns -- in\ncontrast to standard ROM strategies, which become unstable or inaccurate under\nthese challenging conditions. These results demonstrate that the proposed\nprojection-based ROM enables substantial model compression while preserving key\nphysical mechanisms in nonequilibrium plasma physics, paving the way for fast,\nreliable simulation of high-speed plasma flows.",

    "abstract": "Graph states and their entanglement properties are pivotal for the\ndevelopment of quantum computing and technologies. For qubits, local\ncomplementation, a graphical rule that connects all the equivalent states under\nLocal Clifford (LC) operations, was used for the complete characterization of\nall the LC equivalence classes up until 12 particles, assisting applications in\nquantum error correction and state preparation protocols optimization. This\nconcept has been extended for qudits. In this work, we provide a complete\ncharacterization of the entanglement classes up until 7 qutrits, mapping each\nclass into an orbit. The graph-theoretic properties of the orbits are studied,\nilluminating the rich structure they have. Clear connections between the\nconnectivity of the orbits and the entanglement properties are observed. The\ncorrelations between the graph-theoretic properties and the Schmidt measure\nprovide useful insights regarding qudit state preparation and fault-tolerance.\nThis work is accompanied by a repository consisting of the code to extract the\norbits and perform the presented statistical analysis. The strong interplay\nbetween quantum theory and graph theory is well-known and extensively studied\nfor qubits. Our work provides practical tools and results to assist this\nendeavor for the qudit case.",

    "abstract": "Numerical simulations of turbulent fluids are paramount to real-life\napplications, from predicting and modeling flows to diagnostic purposes in\nengineering. However, they are also computationally challenging due to their\nintrinsically non-linear dynamics, which requires a very high spatial\nresolution to accurately describe them. A promising idea is to represent flows\non a discrete mesh using tensor trains (TTs), featuring a convenient scaling of\nthe number of parameters with the mesh size. However, it is yet not clear how\nthe compression power of TTs is affected by the complexity of the flows,\nmeasured by the Reynolds number. In fact, no TT fluid solver has been\nextensively validated in a fully developed turbulent regime yet. We fill this\ngap. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of TTs as an Ansatz to compress,\nsimulate, and synthetically generate fiducial turbulent snapshots in 3D.\nSpecifically, first, we exhaustively investigate the effect of TT compression\nof given snapshots on key turbulence signatures, including the energy spectrum\nand different accuracy metrics. Second, we present a TT solver to simulate time\nevolution of 3D fluid fields according to the incompressible Navier-Stokes\nequations entirely within the compressed representation. Third, we develop a TT\nalgorithm to generate artificial snapshots displaying all the signatures of\nturbulence. In all three cases, a number of parameters scaling\npolylogarithmically with the mesh size is enough for accurate descriptions. Our\nfindings confirm that fluids in truly turbulent regimes admit an efficient TT\ndescription and offer a powerful, quantum-inspired toolkit for their\ncomputational treatment.",

However, progress in this field has been\nhampered by the limited number of observed events. In this work, we present\nTDECat, a comprehensive catalogue of 134 confirmed TDEs (131 optical TDEs and 3\njetted TDEs) discovered up to the end of 2024, accompanied by multi-wavelength\nphotometry (X-ray, UV, optical, and IR) and publicly available spectra. We also\nstudy the statistical properties, spectral classifications, and multi-band\nvariability of these events. Using a Bayesian Blocks algorithm, we determine\nthe duration, rise time , decay time, and their ratio for 103 flares in our\nsample. We find that these timescales follow a log-normal distribution.\nFurthermore, our spectral analysis shows that most optical TDEs belong to the\nTDE-H+He class, followed by the TDE-H, TDE-He, and TDE-featureless classes,\nwhich is consistent with expectations from main sequence star disruption. Using\narchival observations, we identify four new potentially repeating TDEs, namely\nAT 2024pvu, AT 2022exr, AT2021uvz, and AT 2019teq, increasing the number of\nknown repeating events. In both newly identified and previously known cases,\nthe secondary flares exhibit a similar shape to the primary. We also examine\nthe IR and X-ray emission from the TDEs in our catalogue, and find that 14 out\nof the 18 IR events have associated X-ray emission, strongly suggesting a\npotential correlation. Finally, we find that for three subsamples (repeating\nflares, IR-, and X-ray-emitting events), the spectral classes are unlikely to\nbe randomly distributed, suggesting a connection between spectral\ncharacteristics and multi-wavelength emission. TDEcat enables large-scale\npopulation studies across wavelengths and spectral classes, providing essential\ntools for navigating the data-rich era of upcoming surveys such as the LSST.",

These satellite galaxies suffer from ram-pressure\nstripping, leading to the formation of their distinctive gaseous tails. Some\nrecent observational studies find that jellyfish galaxies are more likely to\nhost active galactic nuclei (AGN) compared to central galaxies of the same\nmass, suggesting a link between ram pressure and supermassive black hole (SMBH)\naccretion. We use the IllustrisTNG cosmological-magnetohydrodynamical\nsimulations, namely TNG50 and TNG100, to explore the presence of AGN in\njellyfish galaxies with $M_{\\rm{stellar}}\\simeq10^{9.5-10.8}\\,\\rm{M}_\\odot$ at\nredshift $z=0$ from the Zooniverse \"Cosmological Jellyfish\" citizen-science\nproject.

Jellyfish are also\nmore likely to host an AGN than satellites of the same mass, largely because\nmany satellite galaxies are gas-poor and therefore have lower SMBH accretion\nrates. Compared to non-jellyfish satellites with similar gas content, jellyfish\ntypically undergo stronger ram pressure and have higher central gas densities\nalong with lower central gas sound speeds, although these effects are smaller\nat lower stellar masses ($M_{\\rm stellar}\\lesssim10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$).\nTogether with case studies of individual galaxies, our population analysis\nindicates that ram pressure can play a key role in fuelling AGN activity in a\nlarge fraction of jellyfish, where gas compression can lead to intense episodes\nof AGN feedback and star formation. Thus, it is essential to consider both\nenvironmental and secular processes for a more complete picture of satellite\ngalaxy evolution.",

The Extrinsic Hierarchy Problem (EHP) arises\nwhen the IR theory is augmented with generically assumed extra states and\ninteractions in the UV, making the resulting IR effective theory appear highly\nfinetuned. The IHP is straightforward to analyze within a theory, but has\nsuspicious regulator dependence, and so may be a fake problem. The EHP is less\nstraightforward to analyze, but has strength of physical intuition. We analyze\nEHP as a formal paradox, spelling out its premises and reasoning.

Accurate measurements of cosmological parameters with SNe Ia\nrequire a robust understanding and cross-calibration of the telescopes and\nfilters. A previous cross-calibration effort, 'Fragilistic', provided 25\nphotometric systems, but offered no public code or ability to add new surveys.\nWe provide an open-source cross-calibration solution, available at\nhttps://github.com/bap37/Dovekie/ . Using the Pan-STARRs (PS1) and Gaia all-sky\ntelescopes, we characterise the measured filters from 11 photometric systems,\nincluding CfA, PS1, Foundation, DES, CSP, SDSS, and SNLS, using published\nobservations of field stars. For the first time, we derive uncertainties on\neffective filter transmissions and modify filters to match the data. With the\naddition of direct observations of DA white dwarfs (Boyd et al. 2025), we\nsimultaneously cross-calibrate our zeropoints across photometric systems and\npropagate to cosmology. With improved uncertainties from DA WDs, we find\nimprovements to the calibration systematic uncertainty of x1.5 for the\nPantheon+ (Brout et al. 2022) sample with a new systematic photometric\nuncertainty = 0.016 for FlatwCDM, and modest improvements to that of the DES5YR\nanalysis. We find good agreement with previous calibration, and show that even\nthese small calibration changes can be amplified by up to a factor of x6 in the\ninferred SN Ia distances, driven by calibration sensitivity in the\ncolour-luminosity relations and SALT training. Initial results indicate that\nthese changes cause dmu/dz = 0.025 and change the recovered value of Omega_M in\nLCDM by ~0.01. These may have a potentially larger impact in w0/wa space and\ninferences about evolving dark energy. We pursue this calculation in an ongoing\nfull re-analysis of DES.",

We measure the velocity shift,\nvelocity dispersion, and column density separately for Ca II and Na I. About\nhalf of the galaxies present blueshifted Ca II, indicative of an outflow of\nneutral gas, consistent with previous results based on Na I. The velocity shift\nand the column density measured from Ca II are correlated with those measured\nfrom Na I, implying that these absorption lines trace gas in similar physical\nconditions. However, the column densities are not in a 1:1 relation, meaning\nthat the relative amount of Ca II and Na I atoms along the line of sight varies\nwith the gas column density. After discussing possible reasons for this\nbehavior, we derive an empirical relation between the column density of Ca II\nand the column density of Na I and, in a more indirect way, of neutral hydrogen\nH I.

However, chemical\nabundance measurements contradict this interpretation. Closely connected to the\nmorphology of the ejecta is its velocity distribution, which provides critical\ndetails for understanding the explosion mechanism. We report the first-ever\nobservational constraint on the kinematics of the ejecta in W49B using the\nResolve microcalorimeter spectrometer on the X-ray Imaging and Spectroscopy\nMission (XRISM). Using XRISM/Resolve, we measured the line-of-sight velocity\ntraced by the Fe He$\\alpha$ emission, which is the brightest feature in the\nResolve spectrum, to vary by $\\pm$300 km s$^{-1}$ with a smooth east-to-west\ngradient of a few tens of km s$^{-1}$ pc$^{-1}$ along the major axis. Similar\ntrends in the line-of-sight velocity structure were found for other Fe-group\nelements Cr and Mn, traced by the He$\\alpha$ emission, and also for\nintermediate-mass elements Si, S, Ar, and Ca, traced by the Ly$\\alpha$\nemission. The discovery of the east-west gradient in the line-of-sight\nvelocity, together with the absence of a twin-peaked line profile or enhanced\nbroadening in the central region, clearly rejects the equatorially expanding\ndisk model. In contrast, the observed velocity structure suggests bipolar flows\nreminiscent of a bipolar explosion scenario. An alternative scenario would be a\ncollimation of the ejecta by an elongated cavity sculpted by bipolar stellar\nwinds.",

While galaxy cluster surveys\nhave been used as cosmological probes for more than a decade, the accuracy of\ncluster count experiments is still hampered by systematic, such as the relation\nbetween observables and halo mass, the accuracy of the halo mass function, and\nthe survey selection function. Here we show that these uncertainties can be\nalleviated by forward modeling the observed cluster population with\nsimulation-based inference. We construct a pipeline that predicts the\ndistribution of observables from cosmological parameters and scaling relations,\nand then train a neural network to learn the mapping between the input\nparameters and the measured distributions. We focus on fiducial X-ray surveys\nwith available flux, temperature, and redshift measurements, although the\nmethod can be easily adapted to any available observable. We apply our method\nto mock samples extracted from the UNIT1i simulation and demonstrate the\naccuracy of our approach. We then study the impact of several systematic\nuncertainties on the recovered cosmological parameters. We show that sample\nvariance and the choice of the halo mass function are subdominant sources of\nuncertainty. Conversely, the absolute mass scale is the leading source of\nsystematic error and must be calibrated at the $<10\\%$ level to recover\naccurate values of $\\Omega_m$ and $\\sigma_8$. However, the quantity\n$S_8=\\sigma_8(\\Omega_m/0.3)^{0.3}$ appears to be less sensitive to the accuracy\nof the mass calibration.

A large subpopulation\nnaturally emerges from the broad Balmer line sources, with 36 exhibiting\n`v-shaped' UV-to-optical continua and a dominant point source component in the\nrest-optical; we define these as spectroscopic LRDs, constituting the largest\nsuch sample to date. Strikingly, the spectroscopic LRD population is largely\nrecovered when either a broad line or rest-optical point source is required in\ncombination with a v-shaped continuum, suggesting an inherent link between\nthese three defining characteristics. We compare the spectroscopic LRD sample\nto published photometric searches. Although these selections have high\naccuracy, down to $\\rm F444W<26.5$, only 50-62% of the RUBIES LRDs were\npreviously identified.

The benchmark spans 10 diverse\nmathematical domains, covering videos ranging from 10 seconds to over 1 hour.\nIt requires models to interpret structured visual content, understand\ninstructional narratives, and jointly ground concepts across visual, audio, and\ntextual modalities. We employ graduate-level experts to ensure high quality,\ntotaling over $920$ man-hours of annotation. To reflect real-world scenarios,\nquestions are designed around three core reasoning challenges: direct problem\nsolving, where answers are grounded in the presented question; conceptual\ntransfer, which requires applying learned methods to new problems; and deep\ninstructional comprehension, involving multi-step reasoning over extended\nexplanations and partially worked-out solutions.

    "abstract": "Inference-time scaling trades efficiency for increased reasoning accuracy by\ngenerating longer or more parallel sequences. However, in Transformer LLMs,\ngeneration cost is bottlenecked by the size of the key-value (KV) cache, rather\nthan the number of generated tokens. Hence, we explore inference-time\nhyper-scaling: by compressing the KV cache, we can generate more tokens within\nthe same compute budget and further improve the accuracy of scaled inference.\nThe success of this approach, however, hinges on the ability of compression\nmethods to preserve accuracy even at high compression ratios. To make\nhyper-scaling practical, we introduce Dynamic Memory Sparsification (DMS), a\nnovel method for sparsifying KV caches that only requires 1K training steps to\nachieve 8$\\times$ compression, while maintaining better accuracy than\ntraining-free sparse attention. Instead of prematurely discarding cached\ntokens, DMS delays token eviction, implicitly merging representations and\npreserving critical information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of\ninference-time hyper-scaling with DMS on multiple families of LLMs, showing\nthat it boosts accuracy for comparable inference runtime and memory load. For\ninstance, we enhance Qwen-R1 32B by an average of 9.1 points on AIME 24, 7.6 on\nGPQA, and 9.6 on LiveCodeBench across compute budgets.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have underscored their\nvulnerability to safety alignment jailbreaks, particularly when subjected to\ndownstream fine-tuning. However, existing mitigation strategies primarily focus\non reactively addressing jailbreak incidents after safety guardrails have been\ncompromised, removing harmful gradients during fine-tuning, or continuously\nreinforcing safety alignment throughout fine-tuning. As such, they tend to\noverlook a critical upstream factor: the role of the original safety-alignment\ndata. This paper therefore investigates the degradation of safety guardrails\nthrough the lens of representation similarity between upstream alignment\ndatasets and downstream fine-tuning tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that\nhigh similarity between these datasets significantly weakens safety guardrails,\nmaking models more susceptible to jailbreaks. Conversely, low similarity\nbetween these two types of datasets yields substantially more robust models and\nthus reduces harmfulness score by up to 10.33%. By highlighting the importance\nof upstream dataset design in the building of durable safety guardrails and\nreducing real-world vulnerability to jailbreak attacks, these findings offer\nactionable insights for fine-tuning service providers.",

    "abstract": "Designing model architectures requires decisions such as selecting operators\n(e.g., attention, convolution) and configurations (e.g., depth, width).\nHowever, evaluating the impact of these decisions on model quality requires\ncostly pretraining, limiting architectural investigation. Inspired by how new\nsoftware is built on existing code, we ask: can new architecture designs be\nstudied using pretrained models? To this end, we present grafting, a simple\napproach for editing pretrained diffusion transformers (DiTs) to materialize\nnew architectures under small compute budgets. Informed by our analysis of\nactivation behavior and attention locality, we construct a testbed based on the\nDiT-XL/2 design to study the impact of grafting on model quality. Using this\ntestbed, we develop a family of hybrid designs via grafting: replacing softmax\nattention with gated convolution, local attention, and linear attention, and\nreplacing MLPs with variable expansion ratio and convolutional variants.\nNotably, many hybrid designs achieve good quality (FID: 2.38-2.64 vs. 2.27 for\nDiT-XL/2) using <2% pretraining compute. We then graft a text-to-image model\n(PixArt-Sigma), achieving a 1.43x speedup with less than a 2% drop in GenEval\nscore. Finally, we present a case study that restructures DiT-XL/2 by\nconverting every pair of sequential transformer blocks into parallel blocks via\ngrafting. This reduces model depth by 2x and yields better quality (FID: 2.77)\nthan other models of comparable depth. Together, we show that new diffusion\nmodel designs can be explored by grafting pretrained DiTs, with edits ranging\nfrom operator replacement to architecture restructuring.

    "abstract": "Language models serve as proxies for human preference judgements in alignment\nand evaluation, yet they exhibit systematic miscalibration, prioritizing\nsuperficial patterns over substantive qualities. This bias manifests as\noverreliance on features like length, structure, and style, leading to issues\nlike reward hacking and unreliable evaluations. Evidence suggests these biases\noriginate in artifacts in human training data. In this work, we systematically\ninvestigate the relationship between training data biases and preference model\nmiscalibration across five idiosyncratic features of language model\ngenerations: length, structure, jargon, sycophancy and vagueness. Using\ncontrolled counterfactual pairs, we first quantify the extent to which\npreference models favor responses with magnified biases (skew), finding this\npreference occurs in >60% of instances, and model preferences show high\nmiscalibration (~40%) compared to human preferences. Notably, bias features\nonly show mild negative correlations to human preference labels (mean r_human =\n-0.12) but show moderately strong positive correlations with labels from a\nstrong reward model (mean r_model = +0.36), suggesting that models may overrely\non spurious cues. To mitigate these issues, we propose a simple post-training\nmethod based on counterfactual data augmentation (CDA) using synthesized\ncontrastive examples. Finetuning models with CDA reduces average miscalibration\nfrom 39.4% to 32.5% and average absolute skew difference from 20.5% to 10.0%,\nwhile maintaining overall RewardBench performance, showing that targeted\ndebiasing is effective for building reliable preference models.",

Prior work, grounded in compute-optimality, overlooks critical\nmemory access bottlenecks introduced by inference-time strategies (e.g.,\nBest-of-$N$, long CoTs). Our holistic analysis, spanning models from 0.6B to\n32B parameters, reveals a new Kinetics Scaling Law that better guides resource\nallocation by incorporating both computation and memory access costs. Kinetics\nScaling Law suggests that test-time compute is more effective when used on\nmodels above a threshold than smaller ones. A key reason is that in TTS,\nattention, rather than parameter count, emerges as the dominant cost factor.\nMotivated by this, we propose a new scaling paradigm centered on sparse\nattention, which lowers per-token cost and enables longer generations and more\nparallel samples within the same resource budget. Empirically, we show that\nsparse attention models consistently outperform dense counterparts, achieving\nover 60 points gains in low-cost regimes and over 5 points gains in high-cost\nregimes for problem-solving accuracy on AIME, encompassing evaluations on\nstate-of-the-art MoEs. These results suggest that sparse attention is essential\nand increasingly important with more computing invested, for realizing the full\npotential of test-time scaling where, unlike training, accuracy has yet to\nsaturate as a function of computation, and continues to improve through\nincreased generation.

    "abstract": "Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has widely enhanced mathematical reasoning in Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs), but it still remains challenging for extending it to\nmultimodal domains. Existing works either adopt a similar textual reasoning for\nimage input, or seek to interleave visual signals into mathematical CoT.\nHowever, they face three key limitations for math problem-solving: reliance on\ncoarse-grained box-shaped image regions, limited perception of vision encoders\non math content, and dependence on external capabilities for visual\nmodification. In this paper, we propose MINT-CoT, introducing Mathematical\nINterleaved Tokens for Chain-of-Thought visual reasoning. MINT-CoT adaptively\ninterleaves relevant visual tokens into textual reasoning steps via an\nInterleave Token, which dynamically selects visual regions of any shapes within\nmath figures. To empower this capability, we construct the MINT-CoT dataset,\ncontaining 54K mathematical problems aligning each reasoning step with visual\nregions at the token level, accompanied by a rigorous data generation pipeline.\nWe further present a three-stage MINT-CoT training strategy, progressively\ncombining text-only CoT SFT, interleaved CoT SFT, and interleaved CoT RL, which\nderives our MINT-CoT-7B model. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method for effective visual interleaved reasoning in\nmathematical domains, where MINT-CoT-7B outperforms the baseline model by\n+34.08% on MathVista, +28.78% on GeoQA, and +23.2% on MMStar, respectively.

Such particles frequently\narise in non-minimal hidden sectors that couple to the Standard Model through\nportal operators. We consider two distinct scenarios. In the first scenario,\nwhich arises from a neutrino portal interaction, a hidden sector particle is\nproduced inside the detector by the collision of an energetic neutrino with a\nnucleon, giving rise to a visible cascade. This new state then decays into a\nhidden sector daughter, which can naturally be long-lived. The eventual decay\nof the daughter particle back to Standard Model states gives rise to a second\ncascade inside the detector. This scenario therefore gives rise to a\ncharacteristic \"double bang\" signal arising from the two distinct cascades. In\nthe second scenario, which arises from a hypercharge portal interaction, a\nhidden sector particle is produced outside the detector by the collision of an\natmospheric muon with a nucleon. This new state promptly decays into a pair of\nhidden sector daughters that are long-lived. If both daughters decay into\nStandard Model states inside the detector, we again obtain a double-bang signal\nfrom the two distinct cascades. We explore the reach of IceCube for these two\nscenarios and show that it has the potential to significantly improve the\nsensitivity to hidden sector models in the mass range from about a GeV to about\n20 GeV.",

These 2D models are realised by giving critical\nboundary conditions to 3D topological orders (symTOs/symTFTs) described by\nstring-net models, often called the strange correlators. We engineer these\ncritical boundary conditions by introducing a commensurate amount of\nnon-commuting anyon condensates. The non-invertible symmetries preserved at the\ncritical point can be controlled by studying a novel ``refined condensation\ntree''. Our structured method generates an infinite family of critical lattice\nmodels, including the A-series minimal models, and uncovers previously unknown\ncritical points. Notably, we find at least three novel critical points\n(c$\\approx 1.3$, $1.8$, and $2.5$ respectively) preserving the Haagerup\nsymmetries, in addition to recovering previously reported ones. The\ncondensation tree, together with a generalised Kramers-Wannier duality,\npredicts precisely large swathes of phase boundaries, fixes almost completely\nthe global phase diagram, and sieves out second order phase transitions. This\nis not only illustrated in well-known examples (such as the 8-vertex model\nrelated to the $A_5$ category) but also further verified with precision\nnumerics, using our improved (non-invertible) symmetry-preserving\ntensor-network RG, in novel examples involving the Haagerup symmetries.

    "abstract": "Real-time decoding of neural activity is central to neuroscience and\nneurotechnology applications, from closed-loop experiments to brain-computer\ninterfaces, where models are subject to strict latency constraints. Traditional\nmethods, including simple recurrent neural networks, are fast and lightweight\nbut often struggle to generalize to unseen data. In contrast, recent\nTransformer-based approaches leverage large-scale pretraining for strong\ngeneralization performance, but typically have much larger computational\nrequirements and are not always suitable for low-resource or real-time\nsettings. To address these shortcomings, we present POSSM, a novel hybrid\narchitecture that combines individual spike tokenization via a cross-attention\nmodule with a recurrent state-space model (SSM) backbone to enable (1) fast and\ncausal online prediction on neural activity and (2) efficient generalization to\nnew sessions, individuals, and tasks through multi-dataset pretraining. We\nevaluate POSSM's decoding performance and inference speed on intracortical\ndecoding of monkey motor tasks, and show that it extends to clinical\napplications, namely handwriting and speech decoding in human subjects.\nNotably, we demonstrate that pretraining on monkey motor-cortical recordings\nimproves decoding performance on the human handwriting task, highlighting the\nexciting potential for cross-species transfer. In all of these tasks, we find\nthat POSSM achieves decoding accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art\nTransformers, at a fraction of the inference cost (up to 9x faster on GPU).\nThese results suggest that hybrid SSMs are a promising approach to bridging the\ngap between accuracy, inference speed, and generalization when training neural\ndecoders for real-time, closed-loop applications.",

Recent studies of\nanyon condensation in topological phases, however, may fit topological phases\nback in the Landau-Ginzburg paradigm. To truly do so, we realized that the\nstring-net model of topological phases is in fact an effective lattice gauge\ntheory coupled with anyonic matter once two modifications are made: (1) We\nreinterpret anyons as matter fields coupled to lattice gauge fields, thus\nextending the HGW model to a genuine Hamiltonian lattice gauge theory. (2) By\nexplicitly incorporating the internal degrees of freedom of anyons, we\nconstruct an enlarged Hilbert space that supports well-defined gauge\ntransformations and covariant coupling, restoring the analogy with conventional\nlattice gauge field theory. In this modified string-net model, topological\nphase transitions induced by anyon condensation and their consequent phenomena,\nsuch as order parameter fields, coherent states, Goldstone modes, and gapping\ngauge degrees of freedom, can be formulated exactly as Landau's effective\ntheory of the Higgs mechanism.

Based on their encoder design, this\npaper categorizes recent 3D VLMs into 3D object-centric, 2D image-based, and 3D\nscene-centric approaches. Despite the architectural similarity of 3D\nscene-centric VLMs to their 2D counterparts, they have exhibited comparatively\nlower performance compared with the latest 3D object-centric and 2D image-based\napproaches. To understand this gap, we conduct an in-depth analysis, revealing\nthat 3D scene-centric VLMs show limited reliance on the 3D scene encoder, and\nthe pre-train stage appears less effective than in 2D VLMs. Furthermore, we\nobserve that data scaling benefits are less pronounced on larger datasets.

In this\npaper, we propose two techniques to improve data efficiency in LLM RL\nfine-tuning: difficulty-targeted online data selection and rollout replay. We\nintroduce the notion of adaptive difficulty to guide online data selection,\nprioritizing questions of moderate difficulty that are more likely to yield\ninformative learning signals. To estimate adaptive difficulty efficiently, we\ndevelop an attention-based framework that requires rollouts for only a small\nreference set of questions.

Our theoretical analysis establishes this result by first showing\nthat the truncated estimator is in fact estimating an appropriate policy\ngradient that can be expressed as a difference in Q-values; thus we refer to\nour estimator as the truncated DQ estimator (by analogy to the DQ estimator).\nWe then show that the corresponding policy gradient is a first-order\napproximation to the GATE. Combining these insights yields our bias and\nvariance bounds. We validate our results through synthetic and realistic\nsimulations-including hospital and ride-sharing settings-and show that a\nwell-calibrated truncated DQ estimator achieves low bias and variance even in\nnonstationary environments.",

    "abstract": "The erasure of information is fundamentally an irreversible logical\noperation, carrying profound consequences for the energetics of computation and\ninformation processing. We investigate the thermodynamic costs associated with\nerasing (and preparing) quantum processes. Specifically, we analyze an\narbitrary bipartite unitary gate acting on logical and ancillary input-output\nsystems, where the ancillary input is always initialized in the ground state.\nWe focus on the adversarial erasure cost of the reduced dynamics -- that is,\nthe minimal thermodynamic work cost to erase the logical output of the gate for\nany logical input, assuming full access to the ancilla but no access to any\npurifying reference of the logical input state. We determine that this\nadversarial erasure cost is directly proportional to the negative min-entropy\nof the reduced dynamics, thereby giving the dynamical min-entropy a clear\noperational meaning. The dynamical min-entropy can take positive and negative\nvalues, depending on the underlying quantum dynamics. The negative value of the\nerasure cost implies that the extraction of thermodynamic work is possible\ninstead of its consumption during the process. A key foundation of this result\nis the quantum process decoupling theorem, which quantitatively relates the\ndecoupling ability of a process with its min-entropy. This insight bridges\nthermodynamics, information theory, and the fundamental limits of quantum\ncomputation.",

    "abstract": "Associative memory models such as the Hopfield network and its dense\ngeneralizations with higher-order interactions exhibit a \"blackout\ncatastrophe\"--a discontinuous transition where stable memory states abruptly\nvanish when the number of stored patterns exceeds a critical capacity. This\ntransition is often interpreted as rendering networks unusable beyond capacity\nlimits. We argue that this interpretation is largely an artifact of the\nequilibrium perspective. We derive dynamical mean-field equations using a\nbipartite cavity approach for graded-activity dense associative memory models,\nwith the Hopfield model as a special case, and solve them using a numerical\nscheme. We show that patterns can be transiently retrieved with high accuracy\nabove capacity despite the absence of stable attractors. This occurs because\nslow regions persist in the above-capacity energy landscape near stored\npatterns as lingering traces of the stable basins that existed below capacity.\nThe same transient-retrieval effect occurs in below-capacity networks\ninitialized outside basins of attraction. \"Transient-recovery curves\" provide a\nconcise visual summary of these effects, revealing graceful, non-catastrophic\nchanges in retrieval behavior above capacity and allowing us to compare the\nbehavior across interaction orders. This dynamical perspective reveals rich\nenergy landscape structure obscured by equilibrium analysis and suggests\nbiological neural circuits may exploit transient dynamics for memory retrieval.\nFurthermore, our approach suggests ways of understanding computational\nproperties of neural circuits without reference to fixed points, advances the\ntechnical repertoire of numerical mean-field solution methods for recurrent\nneural networks, and yields new theoretical results on generalizations of the\nHopfield model.",

This is particularly evident when employing the\nlattice Boltzmann method (LBM) as the numerical solution technique, which often\nsuffers from inaccuracies induced by artificial reflections from outflow\nboundaries. This paper investigates the use of neural networks (NN) to mitigate\nthese adverse boundary effects and enable truncated domain requirements. Two\ndistinct NN-based approaches are proposed: (1) direct reconstruction of unknown\nparticle distribution functions at the outflow boundary; and (2) enhancement of\nestablished characteristic boundary conditions (CBC) by dynamically tuning\ntheir parameters. The direct reconstruction model was trained on data generated\nfrom a 2D flow over a cylindrical obstruction. The drag, lift, and Strouhal\nnumber were used to test the new boundary condition. We analyzed results for\nvarious Reynolds numbers and restricted domain sizes where it demonstrated\nsignificantly improved predictions when compared with the traditional Zou & He\nboundary condition. To examine the robustness of the NN-based reconstruction,\nthe same condition was applied to the simulation of a NACA0012 airfoil, again\nproviding accurate aerodynamic performance predictions. The neural-enhanced CBC\nwere evaluated on a 2D convected vortex benchmark and showed superior\nperformance in minimizing density errors compared to CBCs with fixed\nparameters. These findings highlight the potential of NN-integrated boundary\nconditions to improve accuracy and reduce computational expense of aerodynamic\nand acoustic emissions simulations with the LBM.",

    "abstract": "Hydrodynamic noise is the Gaussian process that emerges at larges scales of\nspace and time in many-body systems. It is justified by the central limit\ntheorem, and represents degrees of freedom forgotten when projecting\ncoarse-grained observables onto conserved quantities. It is the basis for\nfluctuating hydrodynamics, where it appears along with bare diffusion terms\nrelated to the noise covariance by the Einstein relation. In one spatial\ndimension, nonlinearities are relevant and may modify the corrections to\nballistic behaviours by superdiffusive effects. But in systems where no shocks\nappear, such as linearly degenerate and integrable systems, the diffusive\nscaling of these corrections stays intact. Nevertheless, anomalies remain. We\nshow that in such systems, the noise covariance is given by a modification of\nthe Kubo formula, where effects of ballistic long-range correlations have been\nprojected out, and that nonlinearities are tamed by a point-splitting\nregularisation. With these ingredients, we obtain a well-defined hydrodynamic\nfluctuation theory in the ballistic scaling of space-time, as a stochastic PDE.\nIt describes the asymptotic expansion in the inverse variation scale of\nconnected correlation functions, self-consistently organised via a cumulant\nexpansion. The resulting anomalous hydrodynamic equation for average densities\ntakes into account both long-range correlations and bare diffusion,\ngeneralising recent results. Despite these anomalies, two-point functions\nsatisfy an ordinary diffusion equation, with diffusion matrix determined by the\nKubo formula. In integrable systems, we show that hydrodynamic noise, hence\nbare diffusion, must vanish, as was conjectured recently, and argue that under\nan appropriate gauge of the currents, this is true at all orders.

    "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems commonly suffer from Knowledge\nConflicts, where retrieved external knowledge contradicts the inherent,\nparametric knowledge of large language models (LLMs). It adversely affects\nperformance on downstream tasks such as question answering (QA). Existing\napproaches often attempt to mitigate conflicts by directly comparing two\nknowledge sources in a side-by-side manner, but this can overwhelm LLMs with\nextraneous or lengthy contexts, ultimately hindering their ability to identify\nand mitigate inconsistencies. To address this issue, we propose Micro-Act a\nframework with a hierarchical action space that automatically perceives context\ncomplexity and adaptively decomposes each knowledge source into a sequence of\nfine-grained comparisons. These comparisons are represented as actionable\nsteps, enabling reasoning beyond the superficial context. Through extensive\nexperiments on five benchmark datasets, Micro-Act consistently achieves\nsignificant increase in QA accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines across all\n5 datasets and 3 conflict types, especially in temporal and semantic types\nwhere all baselines fail significantly. More importantly, Micro-Act exhibits\nrobust performance on non-conflict questions simultaneously, highlighting its\npractical value in real-world RAG applications.",

    "abstract": "Minimizers are sampling schemes with numerous applications in computational\nbiology. Assuming a fixed alphabet of size $\\sigma$, a minimizer is defined by\ntwo integers $k,w\\ge2$ and a linear order $\\rho$ on strings of length $k$ (also\ncalled $k$-mers). A string is processed by a sliding window algorithm that\nchooses, in each window of length $w+k-1$, its minimal $k$-mer with respect to\n$\\rho$. A key characteristic of the minimizer is its density, which is the\nexpected frequency of chosen $k$-mers among all $k$-mers in a random infinite\n$\\sigma$-ary string. Minimizers of smaller density are preferred as they\nproduce smaller samples with the same guarantee: each window is represented by\na $k$-mer.\n  The problem of finding a minimizer of minimum density for given input\nparameters $(\\sigma,k,w)$ has a huge search space of $(\\sigma^k)!$ and is\nrepresentable by an ILP of size $\\tilde\\Theta(\\sigma^{k+w})$, which has\nworst-case solution time that is doubly-exponential in $(k+w)$ under standard\ncomplexity assumptions. We solve this problem in $w\\cdot 2^{\\sigma^k+O(k)}$\ntime and provide several additional tricks reducing the practical runtime and\nsearch space. As a by-product, we describe an algorithm computing the average\ndensity of a minimizer within the same time bound. Then we propose a novel\nmethod of studying minimizers via regular languages and show how to find, via\nthe eigenvalue/eigenvector analysis over finite automata, minimizers with the\nminimal density in the asymptotic case $w\\to\\infty$. Implementing our\nalgorithms, we compute the minimum density minimizers for\n$(\\sigma,k)\\in\\{(2,2),(2,3),(2,4),(2,5),(4,2)\\}$ and \\textbf{all} $w\\ge 2$. The\nobtained densities are compared against the average density and the theoretical\nlower bounds, including the new bound presented in this paper.",

TF-CoVR focuses on gymnastics and diving and provides 180K\ntriplets drawn from FineGym and FineDiving. Previous CoVR benchmarks focusing\non temporal aspect, link each query to a single target segment taken from the\nsame video, limiting practical usefulness.

We use it to derive a projection formula,\nexpressing $n$-point connected correlation functions (cumulants) of generic\nobservables at different space-time points, in terms of those of conserved\ndensities. This applies in every $d\\geq 1$ spatial dimensions and under the\nballistic scaling of space and time, both in and out of equilibrium.

The sum is combinatorially organised via certain covers of the\nset of space-time points, which we call minimal connected covers.

In the\nteam performing stage, maintaining cohesion and engagement is critical for\nsustaining high team performance. However, existing computational tools and\nalgorithms for team optimization often rely on static data inputs, narrow\nalgorithmic objectives, or solutions tailored for specific contexts, failing to\naccount for the dynamic interplay of team members personalities, evolving\ngoals, and changing individual preferences. Therefore, teams may encounter\nmember dissatisfaction, as purely algorithmic assignments can reduce members\ncommitment to team goals or experience suboptimal engagement due to the absence\nof timely, personalized guidance to help members adjust their behaviors and\ninteractions as team dynamics evolve. Ultimately, these challenges can lead to\nreduced overall team performance. My Ph.D. dissertation aims to develop\nAI-augmented team optimization frameworks and practical systems that enhance\nteam satisfaction, engagement, and performance. First, I propose a team\nformation framework that leverages a multi-armed bandit algorithm to\niteratively refine team composition based on user preferences, ensuring\nalignment between individual needs and collective team goals to enhance team\nsatisfaction. Second, I introduce tAIfa (Team AI Feedback Assistant), an\nAI-powered system that utilizes large language models (LLMs) to deliver\nimmediate, personalized feedback to both teams and individual members,\nenhancing cohesion and engagement. Finally, I present PuppeteerLLM, an\nLLM-based simulation framework that simulates multi-agent teams to model\ncomplex team dynamics within realistic environments, incorporating task-driven\ncollaboration and long-term coordination.",

The river network was\ntaken from a digital elevation model that was made to conform to observed\ncatchment boundaries. Perturbations of a subset of model parameters were\nexamined with reference to streamflow from 25 gauged catchments during the 2019\nwarm season. A data model defines the similarity of modelled streamflow to\nobservations, and improvements were found in about half the individual\ncatchments. With reference to 183 gauged catchments (1990-2022), further\nimprovements were obtained at monthly and annual scales by neural network\npost-processing that targets all catchments at once as well as individual\ncatchments.\n  This seasonal calibration was applied to uncoupled WRF-Hydro simulations for\nthe 1990-2100 warming period.

However, the\nlikelihood displacement observed in DPO indicates that both $\\log \\pi_\\theta\n(y_w\\mid x)$ and $\\log \\pi_\\theta (y_l\\mid x) $ often decrease during training,\ninadvertently boosting the probabilities of non-target responses. In this\npaper, we systematically revisit this phenomenon from LLMs to Video-LLMs,\nshowing that it intensifies when dealing with the redundant complexity of video\ncontent. To alleviate the impact of this phenomenon, we propose \\emph{Lean\nPreference Optimization} (LeanPO), a reference-free approach that reformulates\nthe implicit reward as the average likelihood of the response with respect to\nthe policy model. A key component of LeanPO is the reward-trustworthiness\ncorrelated self-generated preference data pipeline, which carefully infuses\nrelevant prior knowledge into the model while continuously refining the\npreference data via self-reflection. This allows the policy model to obtain\nhigh-quality paired data and accurately estimate the newly defined reward, thus\nmitigating the unintended drop. In addition, we introduce a dynamic label\nsmoothing strategy that mitigates the impact of noise in responses from diverse\nvideo content, preventing the model from overfitting to spurious details.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that LeanPO significantly enhances the\nperformance of state-of-the-art Video-LLMs, consistently boosting baselines of\nvarying capacities with minimal additional training overhead. Moreover, LeanPO\noffers a simple yet effective solution for aligning Video-LLM preferences with\nhuman trustworthiness, paving the way toward the reliable and efficient\nVideo-LLMs.",

    "abstract": "Transformer models have emerged as fundamental tools across various\nscientific and engineering disciplines, owing to their outstanding performance\nin diverse applications. Despite this empirical success, the theoretical\nfoundations of Transformers remain relatively underdeveloped, particularly in\nunderstanding their training dynamics. Existing research predominantly examines\nisolated components--such as self-attention mechanisms and feedforward\nnetworks--without thoroughly investigating the interdependencies between these\ncomponents, especially when residual connections are present. In this paper, we\naim to bridge this gap by analyzing the convergence behavior of a structurally\ncomplete yet single-layer Transformer, comprising self-attention, a feedforward\nnetwork, and residual connections. We demonstrate that, under appropriate\ninitialization, gradient descent exhibits a linear convergence rate, where the\nconvergence speed is determined by the minimum and maximum singular values of\nthe output matrix from the attention layer. Moreover, our analysis reveals that\nresidual connections serve to ameliorate the ill-conditioning of this output\nmatrix, an issue stemming from the low-rank structure imposed by the softmax\noperation, thereby promoting enhanced optimization stability. We also extend\nour theoretical findings to a multi-layer Transformer architecture, confirming\nthe linear convergence rate of gradient descent under suitable initialization.\nEmpirical results corroborate our theoretical insights, illustrating the\nbeneficial role of residual connections in promoting convergence stability.",

We demonstrate that quantum annealing\nplatforms, such as D-Wave, can enable fast and efficient training of classical\nNNs, which are then deployable on conventional hardware. From a physics\nperspective, NN training can be viewed as a dynamical phase transition: the\nsystem evolves from an initial spin glass state to a highly ordered, trained\nstate. This process involves eliminating numerous undesired minima in its\nenergy landscape--akin to cutting off the ever-regenerating heads of a dragon.\nThe advantage of annealing devices is their ability to rapidly find multiple\ndeep states (dragon heads to be cut). We found that this quantum-assisted\ntraining achieves superior performance scaling compared to classical\nbackpropagation methods, with a notably higher scaling exponent (1.01 vs.\n0.78). It may be further increased up to a factor of 2 with a fully coherent\nquantum platform using a variant of the Grover algorithm.

In this work, we propose that guiding\nsuch models to perform a systematic and comprehensive reasoning process -- one\nthat both decomposes the text into smaller facts and also finds evidence in the\nsource for each fact -- allows models to execute much finer-grained and\naccurate entailment decisions, leading to increased performance. To that end,\nwe define a 3-step reasoning process, consisting of (i) claim decomposition,\n(ii) sub-claim attribution and entailment classification, and (iii) aggregated\nclassification, showing that such guided reasoning indeed yields improved\nhallucination detection.

In recent years, PB model\ncounting has seen increased interest partly owing to the succinctness of PB\nformulas over typical propositional Boolean formulas in conjunctive normal form\n(CNF) at describing problem constraints. In particular, the research community\nhas developed tools to tackle exact PB model counting. These recently developed\ncounters follow one of the two existing major designs for model counters,\nnamely the bottom-up model counter design. A natural question would be whether\nthe other major design, the top-down model counter paradigm, would be effective\nat PB model counting, especially when the top-down design offered superior\nperformance in CNF model counting literature.\n  In this work, we investigate the aforementioned top-down design for PB model\ncounting and introduce the first exact top-down PB model counter, PBMC.

Through our evaluations, we\nhighlight the superior performance of PBMC at PB model counting compared to the\nexisting state-of-the-art counters PBCount, PBCounter, and Ganak.

The effective theory is based on the baryon sector\ndynamical spin-flavor SU(4) symmetry emergent in the large Nc limit, whose\nbreaking is controlled by the $1/N_c$ expansion. The non-commutativity of the\nchiral and 1/Nc expansions in unitarity corrections (loops) requires a linking\nof both expansions. As it was shown in the case of baryon masses and currents,\nthe natural linking is the $\\xi$-expansion, in which $O(p) = O(1/Nc ) =\nO(\\xi)A$. The spin-flavor symmetry requires that the ground state baryons span\nan SU(4) symmetric irreducible representation which implies that in particular\n$N$ and $\\Delta$ are active degrees of freedom in the effective theory. The\nscattering amplitude is expanded to the next-to-next-to leading order in the\n$\\xi$ expansion, corresponding to the one-loop contributions with the LO\nLagrangian. The results are given for generic $N_c$ in order to demonstrate the\nconsistency of the framework. The spin-flavor symmetry plays a central role in\nmaintaining the consistency of the effective theory with respect to the $1/N_c$\nexpansion. This consistency manifests itself in an improvement in the\nconvergence of the low energy expansion with respect to the case of the\nordinary BChPT without an explicit dynamical $\\Delta$, which is known to be\ninconsistent with the constraints of $N_c$ scaling.

    "abstract": "We introduce MonkeyOCR, a vision-language model for document parsing that\nadvances the state of the art by leveraging a Structure-Recognition-Relation\n(SRR) triplet paradigm. This design simplifies what would otherwise be a\ncomplex multi-tool pipeline (as in MinerU's modular approach) and avoids the\ninefficiencies of processing full pages with giant end-to-end models (e.g.,\nlarge multimodal LLMs like Qwen-VL). In SRR, document parsing is abstracted\ninto three fundamental questions - \"Where is it?\" (structure), \"What is it?\"\n(recognition), and \"How is it organized?\" (relation) - corresponding to layout\nanalysis, content identification, and logical ordering. This focused\ndecomposition balances accuracy and speed: it enables efficient, scalable\nprocessing without sacrificing precision. To train and evaluate this approach,\nwe introduce the MonkeyDoc (the most comprehensive document parsing dataset to\ndate), with 3.9 million instances spanning over ten document types in both\nChinese and English. Experiments show that MonkeyOCR outperforms MinerU by an\naverage of 5.1%, with particularly notable improvements on challenging content\nsuch as formulas (+15.0%) and tables (+8.6%). Remarkably, our 3B-parameter\nmodel surpasses much larger and top-performing models, including Qwen2.5-VL\n(72B) and Gemini 2.5 Pro, achieving state-of-the-art average performance on\nEnglish document parsing tasks. In addition, MonkeyOCR processes multi-page\ndocuments significantly faster (0.84 pages per second compared to 0.65 for\nMinerU and 0.12 for Qwen2.5-VL-7B). The 3B model can be efficiently deployed\nfor inference on a single NVIDIA 3090 GPU. Code and models will be released at\nhttps://github.com/Yuliang-Liu/MonkeyOCR.",

    "abstract": "Building an efficient and physically consistent world model from limited\nobservations is a long standing challenge in vision and robotics. Many existing\nworld modeling pipelines are based on implicit generative models, which are\nhard to train and often lack 3D or physical consistency. On the other hand,\nexplicit 3D methods built from a single state often require multi-stage\nprocessing-such as segmentation, background completion, and inpainting-due to\nocclusions. To address this, we leverage two perturbed observations of the same\nscene under different object configurations. These dual states offer\ncomplementary visibility, alleviating occlusion issues during state transitions\nand enabling more stable and complete reconstruction. In this paper, we present\nDSG-World, a novel end-to-end framework that explicitly constructs a 3D\nGaussian World model from Dual State observations. Our approach builds dual\nsegmentation-aware Gaussian fields and enforces bidirectional photometric and\nsemantic consistency. We further introduce a pseudo intermediate state for\nsymmetric alignment and design collaborative co-pruning trategies to refine\ngeometric completeness. DSG-World enables efficient real-to-simulation transfer\npurely in the explicit Gaussian representation space, supporting high-fidelity\nrendering and object-level scene manipulation without relying on dense\nobservations or multi-stage pipelines.

However, computing exact\nShapley values is difficult, generally requiring an exponential (in the feature\ndimension) number of model evaluations. To address this, many model-agnostic\nrandomized estimators have been developed, the most influential and widely used\nbeing the KernelSHAP method (Lundberg & Lee, 2017). While related estimators\nsuch as unbiased KernelSHAP (Covert & Lee, 2021) and LeverageSHAP (Musco &\nWitter, 2025) are known to satisfy theoretical guarantees, bounds for\nKernelSHAP have remained elusive. We describe a broad and unified framework\nthat encompasses KernelSHAP and related estimators constructed using both with\nand without replacement sampling strategies. We then prove strong\nnon-asymptotic theoretical guarantees that apply to all estimators from our\nframework. This provides, to the best of our knowledge, the first theoretical\nguarantees for KernelSHAP and sheds further light on tradeoffs between existing\nestimators. Through comprehensive benchmarking on small and medium dimensional\ndatasets for Decision-Tree models, we validate our approach against exact\nShapley values, consistently achieving low mean squared error with modest\nsample sizes. Furthermore, we make specific implementation improvements to\nenable scalability of our methods to high-dimensional datasets.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable improvements in\nreasoning and planning through increased test-time compute, often by framing\nproblem-solving as a search process. While methods like Monte Carlo Tree Search\n(MCTS) have proven effective in some domains, their reliance on fixed\nexploration hyperparameters limits their adaptability across tasks of varying\ndifficulty, rendering them impractical or expensive in certain settings. In\nthis paper, we propose \\textbf{LLM-First Search (LFS)}, a novel \\textit{LLM\nSelf-Guided Search} method that removes the need for pre-defined search\nstrategies by empowering the LLM to autonomously control the search process via\nself-guided exploration. Rather than relying on external heuristics or\nhardcoded policies, the LLM evaluates whether to pursue the current search path\nor explore alternative branches based on its internal scoring mechanisms. This\nenables more flexible and context-sensitive reasoning without requiring manual\ntuning or task-specific adaptation. We evaluate LFS on Countdown and Sudoku\nagainst three classic widely-used search algorithms, Tree-of-Thoughts' Breadth\nFirst Search (ToT-BFS), Best First Search (BestFS), and MCTS, each of which\nhave been used to achieve SotA results on a range of challenging reasoning\ntasks. We found that LFS (1) performs better on more challenging tasks without\nadditional tuning, (2) is more computationally efficient compared to the other\nmethods, especially when powered by a stronger model, (3) scales better with\nstronger models, due to its LLM-First design, and (4) scales better with\nincreased compute budget.

    "abstract": "Recently, breakthroughs in the video diffusion transformer have shown\nremarkable capabilities in diverse motion generations. As for the\nmotion-transfer task, current methods mainly use two-stage Low-Rank Adaptations\n(LoRAs) finetuning to obtain better performance. However, existing\nadaptation-based motion transfer still suffers from motion inconsistency and\ntuning inefficiency when applied to large video diffusion transformers. Naive\ntwo-stage LoRA tuning struggles to maintain motion consistency between\ngenerated and input videos due to the inherent spatial-temporal coupling in the\n3D attention operator. Additionally, they require time-consuming fine-tuning\nprocesses in both stages. To tackle these issues, we propose\nFollow-Your-Motion, an efficient two-stage video motion transfer framework that\nfinetunes a powerful video diffusion transformer to synthesize complex motion.\nSpecifically, we propose a spatial-temporal decoupled LoRA to decouple the\nattention architecture for spatial appearance and temporal motion processing.\nDuring the second training stage, we design the sparse motion sampling and\nadaptive RoPE to accelerate the tuning speed. To address the lack of a\nbenchmark for this field, we introduce MotionBench, a comprehensive benchmark\ncomprising diverse motion, including creative camera motion, single object\nmotion, multiple object motion, and complex human motion. We show extensive\nevaluations on MotionBench to verify the superiority of Follow-Your-Motion.",

Unlike many standard evaluations of\nLLMs' ability to use their context, this task requires composing together a\nlarge number of instructions (grammar productions) retrieved from the context.\nBecause the languages are synthetic, the task can be increased in complexity as\nLLMs' skills improve, and new instances can be automatically generated,\nmitigating data contamination. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on RELIC and\nfind that their accuracy can be reliably predicted from the complexity of the\ngrammar and the individual example strings, and that even the most advanced\nLLMs currently available show near-chance performance on more complex grammars\nand samples, in line with theoretical expectations.

Existing per-scene\noptimization methods require dense input views and incur high computational\ncosts, while generalizable approaches often struggle to reconstruct regions\noutside the input view cone. In this paper, we propose OGGSplat, an open\nGaussian growing method that expands the field-of-view in generalizable 3D\nreconstruction. Our key insight is that the semantic attributes of open\nGaussians provide strong priors for image extrapolation, enabling both semantic\nconsistency and visual plausibility. Specifically, once open Gaussians are\ninitialized from sparse views, we introduce an RGB-semantic consistent\ninpainting module applied to selected rendered views. This module enforces\nbidirectional control between an image diffusion model and a semantic diffusion\nmodel. The inpainted regions are then lifted back into 3D space for efficient\nand progressive Gaussian parameter optimization. To evaluate our method, we\nestablish a Gaussian Outpainting (GO) benchmark that assesses both semantic and\ngenerative quality of reconstructed open-vocabulary scenes. OGGSplat also\ndemonstrates promising semantic-aware scene reconstruction capabilities when\nprovided with two view images captured directly from a smartphone camera.",

Most methods typically follow a\ntwo-stage paradigm where a trained 3D detector's optimized backbone parameters\nare used to initialize a grounding model. In this study, we explore a\nfundamental question: Does embodied 3D grounding benefit enough from detection?\nTo answer this question, we assess the grounding performance of detection\nmodels using predicted boxes filtered by the target category. Surprisingly,\nthese detection models without any instruction-specific training outperform the\ngrounding models explicitly trained with language instructions. This indicates\nthat even category-level embodied 3D grounding may not be well resolved, let\nalone more fine-grained context-aware grounding.

Based on this framework, we further\nintroduce a regional activation grounding module that highlights\ninstruction-related regions and a query-wise modulation module that\nincorporates sentence-level semantic into the query representation,\nstrengthening the context-aware understanding of language instructions.\nRemarkably, DEGround outperforms state-of-the-art model BIP3D by 7.52% at\noverall accuracy on the EmbodiedScan validation set.

As\nthis is done with respect to a specific failure, it is called backward\nresponsibility.\n  This paper provides tight complexity bounds for backward responsibility for\nreachability, B\\\"uchi and parity objectives. For B\\\"uchi objectives, a\npolynomial algorithm is given to determine the set of responsible states. To\nanalyse systems that are too large for standard methods, the paper presents a\nnovel refinement algorithm that iteratively computes responsibility and\ndemonstrates its utility with a prototypical implementation.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we reveal that most current efficient multimodal fine-tuning\nmethods are hindered by a key limitation: they are directly borrowed from LLMs,\noften neglecting the intrinsic differences of multimodal scenarios and even\naffecting the full utilization of all modalities. Inspired by our empirical\nobservation, we argue that unimodal adaptation and cross-modal adaptation are\ntwo essential parts for the effective fine-tuning of MLLMs. From this\nperspective, we propose Multimodal low-rank Adaptation (MokA), a\nmultimodal-aware efficient fine-tuning strategy that takes multimodal\ncharacteristics into consideration. It compresses unimodal information by\nmodality-specific parameters while explicitly enhancing cross-modal\ninteraction, ensuring both unimodal and cross-modal adaptation. Extensive\nexperiments cover three representative multimodal scenarios (audio-visual-text,\nvisual-text, and speech-text), and multiple LLM backbones (LLaMA2/3, Qwen2,\nQwen2.5-VL, etc). Consistent improvements indicate the efficacy and versatility\nof the proposed method. Ablation studies and efficiency evaluation are also\nconducted to fully asses our method. Overall, we think MokA provides a more\ntargeted solution for efficient adaptation of MLLMs, paving the way for further\nexploration. The project page is at https://gewu-lab.github.io/MokA.",

We present a detailed model of the photodissociation region\n(PDR) component of a protoplanetary disk-comprising the outer disk surface and\nthe photoevaporative wind-exposed to strong external far-ultraviolet (FUV)\nradiation. We investigate key gas-phase reactions involving excited H2 that\nlead to the formation of H3+ in the PDR, including detailed state-to-state\ndynamical calculations of reactions H2(v>0) + HOC+ -> H3+ + CO and H2(v>0) + H+\n-> H2+ + H. We also consider the effects of photoionization of vibrationally\nexcited H2(v>=4), a process not previously included in PDR or disk models. We\nfind that these FUV-driven reactions dominate the formation of H3+ in the PDR\nof strongly irradiated disks, largely independently of cosmic-ray ionization.\nThe predicted H3+ abundance in the disk PDR peaks at x(H3+) ~ 1E-8, coinciding\nwith regions of enhanced HOC+ and water vapor abundances, and is linked to the\nstrength of the external FUV field (G_0). The predicted H3+ column density\n(~1E13 cm^-2) agrees with the presence of H3+ in the PDR of d203-506. We also\nfind that formation pumping, resulting from exoergic reactions between excited\nH2 and HOC+, drive the vibrational excitation of H3+ in these regions. We\nexpect this photochemistry to be highly active in disks where G_0 > 1E3. The\nH3+ formation pathways studied here may also be relevant in the inner disk\nregion (near the host star), in exoplanetary ionospheres, and in the early\nUniverse.",

Recently, the quantum query complexity of Boolean functions\nhas been used as a tool to probe their computational power in a standard\ncomplexity theoretic framework, but no separation in exact query complexity has\nthus-far been found. In this paper, we investigate this problem starting with\nthe simpler and fully classical notion of deterministic query complexity of\nBoolean functions, and using classical-deterministic processes -- which may\nexhibit causal indefiniteness -- as a generalised computational framework. We\nfirst show that the standard polynomial and certificate lower bounds of\ndeterministic query complexity also hold in such generalised models.

    "abstract": "Most protoplanetary disks experience a phase in which they are subjected to\nstrong ultraviolet radiation from nearby massive stars. This UV radiation can\nsubstantially alter their chemistry by producing numerous radicals and\nmolecular ions. In this Letter we present detailed analysis of the JWST-NIRSpec\nspectrum of the d203-506 obtained as part of the PDRs4All Early Release Science\nprogram. Using state-of-the-art spectroscopic data, we searched for species\nusing a multi-molecule fitting tool, PAHTATmol, that we developed for this\npurpose. Based on this analysis, we report the clear detection of\nro-vibrational emission of the CH radical and likely detection of the H$_3^+$\nmolecular ion, with estimated abundances of a few times 10$^{-7}$ and\napproximately 10$^{-8}$, respectively. The presence of CH is predicted by\ngas-phase models and well explained by hydrocarbon photochemistry. H$_3^+$ is\nusually formed through reactions of H$_2$ with H$_2^+$ originating from cosmic\nray ionization of H$_2$. However, recent theoretical studies suggest that\nH$_3^+$ also forms through UV-driven chemistry in strongly irradiated\n($G_0>$10$^3$), dense ($n_{\\rm H} >10^{6}$ cm$^{-3}$) gas. The latter is\nfavored as an explanation for the presence of ``hot'' H$_3^+$ ($T_{\\rm\nex}\\gtrsim$1000 K) in the outer disk layers of d203-506, coinciding with the\nemission of FUV-pumped H$_2$ and other ``PDR species'', such as CH$^+$,\nCH$_3^+$, and OH. Our detection of infrared emission from vibrationally excited\nH$_3^+$ and CH raises questions about their excitation mechanisms and,\nunderscore that UV radiation can have a profound impact on the chemistry of\nplanet forming disks.

We present a layering construction that allows us to elevate a DI in\n$d$ dimensions into a DWI in $(d\\,{+}\\,1)$ dimensions. We illustrate the\nphenomenology of DWIs by deploying the layering construction on three concrete\nmodels.",

While achieving provable deterministic safety--verifying system\nsafety across all possible scenarios--remains theoretically ideal, the rarity\nand complexity of corner cases make this approach impractical for scalable\nembodied AI systems. Instead, empirical safety evaluation is employed as an\nalternative, but the absence of provable guarantees imposes significant\nlimitations.

In this paper, we introduce NeuroMix, an MR-based simulator\nfor EVD placement. We conduct a study with 48 participants to assess the impact\nof 2D and 3D visual aids on usability, cognitive load, technology acceptance,\nand procedure precision and execution time. Three training modalities are\ncompared: one without visual aids, one with 2D aids only, and one combining\nboth 2D and 3D aids. The training phase takes place entirely on digital\nobjects, followed by a freehand EVD placement testing phase performed with a\nphysical catherer and a physical phantom without MR aids. We then compare the\nparticipants performance with that of a control group that does not undergo\ntraining. Our findings show that participants trained with both 2D and 3D aids\nachieve a 44\\% improvement in precision during unaided testing compared to the\ncontrol group, substantially higher than the improvement observed in the other\ngroups. All three training modalities receive high usability and technology\nacceptance ratings, with significant equivalence across groups. The combination\nof 2D and 3D visual aids does not significantly increase cognitive workload,\nthough it leads to longer operation times during freehand testing compared to\nthe control group.",

    "abstract": "The ram-pressure acceleration of cold gas by hot outflows plays a crucial\nrole in the dynamics of multiphase galactic winds. Recent numerical studies\nincorporating radiative cooling have identified a size threshold for idealized\ncold clouds to survive within high-velocity outflows. This study extends the\ninvestigation to a more complex morphology of cold gas as observed in the\ninterstellar medium. We conduct three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of\nensembles of individual spherical clouds to systematically explore under which\nconditions the cold clouds can survive. We find that cloud ensembles can\nsurvive collectively -- even when individual clouds, if isolated, would be\nrapidly destroyed. Our results indicate that, besides the morphology, factors\nsuch as tight packing, small inter-cloud distance and higher fragmentation\nfacilitate survival. We propose a novel multi-cloud survival criterion that\naccounts for collective properties of the cloud system, including total gas\nmass and the geometric configuration based on an effective volume filling\nfraction of the cold gas $F_V$. This fraction is computed by constructing a\ncomposite volume from individual enclosing conical boxes aligned with the wind,\nincorporating spatial overlap and cloud-tail spreading. The box dimensions\nscale with the critical survival radius $r_{\\rm crit}$ from the single-cloud\ncriterion. We find a universal threshold $F_{V,{\\rm crit}}\\approx 0.24$ that\nrobustly separates surviving from destroyed systems across diverse geometric\nconfigurations. Our findings emphasize the critical importance of initial cloud\ndistribution and fragmentation in governing the long-term evolution and\nsurvival of cold gas structures, providing insight into observed multiphase\noutflows and CGM dynamics.",

In an accompanying Letter, we introduced the notion of stochastic\nexcursions -- a framework to analyze far from equilibrium processes via\nsub-trajectories. Through counting observables, this framework captures\nfinite-time fluctuations and trajectory-level behavior, which provides insights\ninto thermodynamical trade-offs between thermodynamic quantities of interest,\nsuch as entropy production and dynamical activity. In this work, we enhance\nthis formalism by providing a suite of technical results on how to efficiently\ncompute excursion-related quantities. Our analytical results provide explicit\nformulas for general moments of counting variables and excursion duration, as\nwell as their covariance and conditional moments. We show that excursion\nstatistics recover full counting statistics results, and uncover a relation\nbetween fluctuations of counting observables at single-excursion level and the\nsteady state diffusion coefficient (noise). We also discuss a fluctuation\ntheorem for individual excursions. In addition, we explore how analyzing\nexcursions and using the results developed here can yield insights into three\nproblems of interest: the three-qubit absorption refrigerator, cellular\nsensing, and birth-and-death processes.",

    "abstract": "Binary systems in the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) phase are widely\nrecognized as a leading theoretical framework underpinning the observed\nasymmetric morphologies of planetary nebulae. However, the detection of binary\ncompanions in AGB systems is severely hampered by the overwhelming brightness\nand variability of the evolved primary star, which dominate the photo-metric\nand spectroscopic signatures. Ultraviolet (UV) excess emission has been\nproposed as a candidate diagnostic for the presence of binary companions in AGB\nsystems. This paper evaluates the Chinese Space Station Telescope's (CSST)\nability to detect UV excess emission in AGB stars, leveraging its unprecedented\nUV sensitivity and wide-field survey capabilities. We employed synthetic\nspectral libraries of M0-M8 type giants for primary stars and the ATLAS 9\natmospheric model grid for companion stars spanning a temperature range of 6500\nK to 12000 K. By convolving these model spectra with the CSST multi-band filter\nsystem, we computed color-color diagrams (g-y versus NUV-u) to construct a\ndiagnostic grid. This grid incorporates interstellar extinction corrections and\nestablishes a framework for identifying AGB binary candidates through direct\ncomparison between observed photometry and theoretical predictions.\nFurthermore, we discuss the physical origins of UV excess in AGB stars. This\nstudy pioneers a diagnostic framework leveraging CSST's unique multi-band\nUV-visible synergy to construct color-color grids for binary candidate\nidentification, overcoming limitations of non-simultaneous multi-instrument\nobservations.",

For example, every infinite run of a limit-average QWA A obtains a mean\npayoff, and every word w is assigned the maximal mean payoff obtained by\nnondeterministic runs of A over w. We introduce quantitative language automata\n(QLAs) that define functions from language generators (i.e., implementations)\nto values, where a language generator can be nonprobabilistic, defining a set\nof infinite words, or probabilistic, defining a probability measure over\ninfinite words. A QLA consists of a QWA and an aggregator function. For\nexample, given a QWA A, the infimum aggregator maps each language L to the\ngreatest lower bound assigned by A to any word in L. For boolean value sets,\nQWAs define boolean properties of traces, and QLAs define boolean properties of\nsets of traces, i.e., hyperproperties. For more general value sets, QLAs serve\nas a specification language for a generalization of hyperproperties, called\nquantitative hyperproperties. A nonprobabilistic (resp. probabilistic)\nquantitative hyperproperty assigns a value to each set (resp. distribution) G\nof traces, e.g., the minimal (resp. expected) average response time exhibited\nby the traces in G. We give several examples of quantitative hyperproperties\nand investigate three paradigmatic problems for QLAs: evaluation, nonemptiness,\nand universality. In the evaluation problem, given a QLA AA and an\nimplementation G, we ask for the value that AA assigns to G. In the\nnonemptiness (resp. universality) problem, given a QLA AA and a value k, we ask\nwhether AA assigns at least k to some (resp. every) language. We provide a\ncomprehensive picture of decidability for these problems for QLAs with common\naggregators as well as their restrictions to omega-regular languages and trace\ndistributions generated by finite-state Markov chains.",

However, for high-fidelity simulations\nof turbulence, such as direct and large-eddy simulation, the impact of reduced\nprecision on the computed solution and the resulting uncertainty across flow\nsolvers and different flow cases have not been explored in detail and limits\nthe optimal utilization of new high-performance computing systems. In this\nwork, the effect of reduced precision is studied using four diverse\ncomputational fluid dynamics (CFD) solvers (two incompressible, Neko and\nSimson, and two compressible, PadeLibs and SSDC) using four test cases:\nturbulent channel flow at Retau = 550 and higher, forced transition in a\nchannel, flow over a cylinder at ReD = 3900, and compressible flow over a wing\nsection at Rec = 50000. We observe that the flow physics are remarkably robust\nwith respect to reduction in lower floating-point precision, and that often\nother forms of uncertainty, due to for example time averaging, often have a\nmuch larger impact on the computed result. Our results indicate that different\nterms in the Navier-Stokes equations can be computed to a lower floating-point\naccuracy without affecting the results. In particular, standard IEEE single\nprecision can be used effectively for the entirety of the simulation, showing\nno significant discrepancies from double-precision results across the solvers\nand cases considered. Potential pitfalls are also discussed.",

The first is the optimization of a new compact magnetostatic\ncavity (\"Magic Box\") to house the $^{3}He$ spin filters based on an existing\ndesign. With a length of only 380 mm, it provides a field gradient relaxation\ntime for the $^{3}He$ cell of 421 h in ambient conditions. It also contains a\nradiofrequency coil for adiabatic fast passage flipping. The second project is\ndedicated to the improvement of the $^{3}He$ relaxation time inside the spin\nfilter cell. We have developed a chamber which allows for the deposition of\nalkali metal coatings on the surface of substrates. This emulates the spin\nfilter cell walls, as well as subsequent heat treatment, thus mimicking the\npreparation of a new spin filter cell. The chamber is air-tight and has\ntransparent windows, so that the structure resulting from the deposition of\nalkali metal on the surface of the wafer can be studied by X-ray or neutron\nreflectometry. We plan to continue this work by performing a systematic study\nat various conditions, which should help to shed light on the long-standing\nmystery of how alkali metal coatings help to improve relaxation time of\n$^{3}He$ cells.

These instruments use a combination of a high-resolution and a\nlow-resolution etalon together with an order-sorting prefilter to define the\nbandpass. The overall design is made robust and stable by tailoring the\nlow-resolution etalon reflectivity to accommodate expected cavity errors from\nboth etalons, and by using a compact optical design that eliminates the need\nfor folding mirrors. By using a telecentric design based on lenses rather than\nmirrors, image degradation by the FPI system is negligible, as shown in a\nprevious publication, and the throughput of the system is maximised. Initial\nalignment, and maintaining that alignment over time, is greatly simplified. The\ntelecentric design allows full calibration and/or modelling of essential system\nparameters to be carried out without interfering with the optical setup. We\nalso discuss briefly the polarimeters developed for CRISP and CHROMIS. The high\nperformance of CRISP and CHROMIS has been demonstrated in an earlier\npublication through measurements of the granulation contrast and comparisons\nwith similar measurements simultaneously made through broadband continuum\nfilters. Here, we focus on the aspects of the design that are central to\nenabling high performance and robustness, but also discuss the calibration and\nprocessing of the data, and use a few examples of processed data to demonstrate\nthe achievable image and data quality.

In this study, we systematically\ncompare human and LLM assessments of image descriptions containing controlled\nsemantic errors. We extend the experimental framework of van Miltenburg et al.\n(2020) to both unimodal (text-only) and multimodal (text + image) settings,\nevaluating four error types: age, gender, clothing type, and clothing colour.\nOur findings reveal that humans assign varying levels of severity to different\nerror types, with visual context significantly amplifying perceived severity\nfor colour and type errors. Notably, most LLMs assign low scores to gender\nerrors but disproportionately high scores to colour errors, unlike humans, who\njudge both as highly severe but for different reasons. This suggests that these\nmodels may have internalised social norms influencing gender judgments but lack\nthe perceptual grounding to emulate human sensitivity to colour, which is\nshaped by distinct neural mechanisms. Only one of the evaluated LLMs, Doubao,\nreplicates the human-like ranking of error severity, but it fails to\ndistinguish between error types as clearly as humans. Surprisingly,\nDeepSeek-V3, a unimodal LLM, achieves the highest alignment with human\njudgments across both unimodal and multimodal conditions, outperforming even\nstate-of-the-art multimodal models.",

    "abstract": "This work aims to understand how scaling improves language models,\nspecifically in terms of training dynamics. We find that language models\nundergo loss deceleration early in training; an abrupt slowdown in the rate of\nloss improvement, resulting in piecewise linear behaviour of the loss curve in\nlog-log space. Scaling up the model mitigates this transition by (1) decreasing\nthe loss at which deceleration occurs, and (2) improving the log-log rate of\nloss improvement after deceleration. We attribute loss deceleration to a type\nof degenerate training dynamics we term zero-sum learning (ZSL). In ZSL,\nper-example gradients become systematically opposed, leading to destructive\ninterference in per-example changes in loss. As a result, improving loss on one\nsubset of examples degrades it on another, bottlenecking overall progress. Loss\ndeceleration and ZSL provide new insights into the training dynamics underlying\nlanguage model scaling laws, and could potentially be targeted directly to\nimprove language models independent of scale.

Based on the experimentally\nfabricated MoS2-Bi-MoS2 trilayer heterostructure, we demonstrate the concept of\nlayer-selective Ohmic contact in which one MoS2 layer forms Ohmic contact to\nthe sandwiched Bi monolayer while the opposite MoS2 layer exhibits a Schottky\nbarrier. The Ohmic contact can be switched between the two sandwiching MoS2\nmonolayers by changing the polarity of an external gate field, thus enabling\ncharge to be spatially injected into different MoS2 layers.

This code in combination with simple statistical\nassumptions allow us to decontaminate, identify possible substructures or\npopulations, and estimate expansion ages. Results.

Due to their large electron densities, and high gas\ntemperatures, both electron and gas temperature driven chemistry are likely to\nbe important.

A new\nreaction scheme is developed for microdischarges in water vapour, including\nreactions for both high electron density, and high gas temperature regimes.\nMicrodischarges formed during plasma electrolytic oxidation are used as a test\ncase, however, the key results are expected to be transferable to other plasma\nelectrolysis systems with similar properties.

Comparison of measured\nand simulated electron densities shows good agreement, given the limitations of\nboth model and experiment.

A\nlarge dataset consisting of simulated wave propagation experiments was created\nusing a simplified two-dimensional finite element (FE) model. Using this\ndataset, a sensitivity analysis was performed, highlighting the effect of the\nmaterial parameters and material model on the Rayleigh and supersonic shear\nwave speeds. Then, a Gaussian process regression model was trained to solve the\nill-posed inverse problem of predicting stress and pre-stretch of skin using\nmeasurements of surface wave speed. This model had good predictive performance\n(R2 = 0.9570) and it was possible to interpolate simplified parametric\nequations to calculate the stress and pre-stretch. To demonstrate that wave\nspeed measurements could be obtained cheaply and easily, a simple experiment\nwas devised to obtain wave speed measurements from synthetic skin at different\nvalues of pre-stretch. These experimental wave speeds agree well with the FE\nsimulations and a model trained solely on the FE data provided accurate\npredictions of synthetic skin stiffness.

This paper addresses this challenge within the framework of\nElliptical Factor Models (EFM), which accommodate both heavy tails and\npotential non-linear dependencies common in real-world data. We demonstrate\ntheoretically and empirically that heavy-tailed noise generates spurious\neigenvalues that mimic true factor signals.

We show that\nunder magnifying perturbations, the eigenvalues associated with real factors\nexhibit significantly less fluctuation (stabilizing asymptotically) compared to\nspurious eigenvalues arising from heavy-tailed effects. This differential\nbehavior allows the identification and detection of the true and spurious\nfactors.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) models have achieved impressive\nquality and consistency. However, this has come at the cost of representation\ndiversity. While automatic evaluation methods exist for benchmarking model\ndiversity, they either require reference image datasets or lack specificity\nabout the kind of diversity measured, limiting their adaptability and\ninterpretability. To address this gap, we introduce the Does-it/Can-it\nframework, DIM-CIM, a reference-free measurement of default-mode diversity\n(\"Does\" the model generate images with expected attributes?) and generalization\ncapacity (\"Can\" the model generate diverse attributes for a particular\nconcept?). We construct the COCO-DIMCIM benchmark, which is seeded with COCO\nconcepts and captions and augmented by a large language model. With\nCOCO-DIMCIM, we find that widely-used models improve in generalization at the\ncost of default-mode diversity when scaling from 1.5B to 8.1B parameters.\nDIMCIM also identifies fine-grained failure cases, such as attributes that are\ngenerated with generic prompts but are rarely generated when explicitly\nrequested. Finally, we use DIMCIM to evaluate the training data of a T2I model\nand observe a correlation of 0.85 between diversity in training images and\ndefault-mode diversity. Our work provides a flexible and interpretable\nframework for assessing T2I model diversity and generalization, enabling a more\ncomprehensive understanding of model performance.",

    "abstract": "Misleading text detection on social media platforms is a critical research\narea, as these texts can lead to public misunderstanding, social panic and even\neconomic losses. This paper proposes a novel framework - CL-ISR (Contrastive\nLearning and Implicit Stance Reasoning), which combines contrastive learning\nand implicit stance reasoning, to improve the detection accuracy of misleading\ntexts on social media. First, we use the contrastive learning algorithm to\nimprove the model's learning ability of semantic differences between truthful\nand misleading texts. Contrastive learning could help the model to better\ncapture the distinguishing features between different categories by\nconstructing positive and negative sample pairs. This approach enables the\nmodel to capture distinguishing features more effectively, particularly in\nlinguistically complicated situations. Second, we introduce the implicit stance\nreasoning module, to explore the potential stance tendencies in the text and\ntheir relationships with related topics. This method is effective for\nidentifying content that misleads through stance shifting or emotional\nmanipulation, because it can capture the implicit information behind the text.\nFinally, we integrate these two algorithms together to form a new framework,\nCL-ISR, which leverages the discriminative power of contrastive learning and\nthe interpretive depth of stance reasoning to significantly improve detection\neffect.",

Both eruptions occurred approximately midway through a transient\nstate of high luminosity. A possible explanation of such a state is a\ndwarf-nova-like outburst, which may arise from a transient increase in the\nmass-transfer rate of the donor star. We simulate the response of an accretion\ndisk to an event of enhanced mass-transfer that is ``interrupted'' by a\npre-eruption dip associated to the convective phase leading to the\nthermonuclear runaway, and model the resulting optical light curve using the\nparameters of the T~CrB binary.

In a series of\npreceding works, a novel method for coupling 1D stellar structural models with\na grid of 3D surface convection simulations during stellar evolution was\ndeveloped, at solar metallicity. This 1D-3D coupling method slightly shifts\nevolutionary tracks relative to standard calculations, meanwhile providing\noscillation frequencies that agree more closely with asteroseismic\nobservations. Here we extend this method to model metal-poor and metal-rich\nFGK-type stars, by implementing interpolations on-the-fly across metallicity\n($\\rm -3 < [Fe/H] < 0.5$) for mean 3D models during stellar evolution. We\ndemonstrate quantitatively that the fundamental stellar parameters modeled\nwithin our framework are insensitive to the mixing-length parameter. A 20%\nchange in the mixing-length parameter results in evolutionary tracks with a\ntemperature shift of less than 30 K, compared to a difference of over 200 K in\nstandard evolution calculations. Our extension is validated against eclipsing\nbinary systems with extremely precise observational constraints as well as\nstars in binaries with asteroseismic data. Using a fixed mixing-length\nparameter that merely governs convective heat transport in the near-adiabatic\nlayers, the 1D-3D coupling method successfully reproduces most observational\nconstraints for all target stars. Coupling 1D stellar evolution models with 3D\nsimulations greatly reduces uncertainties associated with the choice of\natmosphere boundary conditions and mixing-length parameters, hence offering a\npowerful tool for characterizing stars with seismic measurements and\ndetermining ages for globular clusters.",

This challenge is particularly\npronounced in the domain of robotics, where diverse and dynamic scenarios\nfurther complicate the creation of representative datasets. To address this, we\npropose a novel method for automatically generating annotated synthetic data in\nUnreal Engine. Our approach leverages photorealistic 3D Gaussian splats for\nrapid synthetic data generation. We demonstrate that synthetic datasets can\nachieve performance comparable to that of real-world datasets while\nsignificantly reducing the time required to generate and annotate data.\nAdditionally, combining real-world and synthetic data significantly increases\nobject detection performance by leveraging the quality of real-world images\nwith the easier scalability of synthetic data. To our knowledge, this is the\nfirst application of synthetic data for training object detection algorithms in\nthe highly dynamic and varied environment of robot soccer. Validation\nexperiments reveal that a detector trained on synthetic images performs on par\nwith one trained on manually annotated real-world images when tested on robot\nsoccer match scenarios. Our method offers a scalable and comprehensive\nalternative to traditional dataset creation, eliminating the labour-intensive\nerror-prone manual annotation process.

We find a\nmoderate correlation in radius and a weak correlation in the densities of\nadjacent planets. However, masses of neighbouring planets show no overall\ncorrelation in our main sample and a weak correlation among pairs of planets\nsimilar in size or pairs restricted to Mp<100 M_Earth, Rp<10 R_Earth.\nSimilarly, we show that the intrasystem dispersion in radius is typically less\nthan that in mass and density. We identify ranges in stellar host properties\nthat correlate with stronger uniformity in pairs of adjacent planets: low Teff\nfor planet masses, and low metallicity and old age for planet densities.\nFurthermore, we explore whether peas in a pod trends extend into planet\ncompositions or interior structures.

    "abstract": "Online social media platforms are often seen as catalysts for radicalization,\nas they provide spaces where extreme beliefs can take root and spread,\nsometimes leading to real-world consequences. Conspiracy theories represent a\nspecific form of radicalization that is notoriously resistant to online\nmoderation strategies. One explanation for this resilience is the presence of a\n\"conspiratorial mindset\", a cognitive framework that fundamentally shapes how\nconspiracy believers perceive reality. However, the role of this mindset in\ndriving online user behavior remains poorly understood. In this study, we\nanalyze the psycholinguistic patterns of Reddit users who become active in a\nprominent conspiracy community by examining their activity in mainstream\ncommunities, which allows us to isolate linguistic markers for the presence of\na conspiratorial mindset. We find that conspiracy-engaged individuals exhibit\ndistinct psycholinguistic fingerprints, setting them apart from the general\nuser population. Crucially, this signal is already evident in their online\nactivity prior to joining the conspiracy community, allowing us to predict\ntheir involvement years in advance. These findings suggest that individuals who\nadopt conspiracy beliefs do not radicalize through community involvement, but\npossess a pre-existing conspiratorial mindset, which predisposes them to seek\nout and join extreme communities. By challenging the view that online social\nmedia platforms actively radicalize users into conspiracy theory beliefs, our\nfindings suggest that standard moderation strategies have limited impact on\ncurbing radicalization, and highlight the need for more targeted, supportive\ninterventions that encourage disengagement from extremist narratives.\nUltimately, this work contributes to fostering safer online and offline\nenvironments for public discourse.",

In this context, pressure-velocity coupling is a key\nissue, and countless numerical techniques and methods have been developed over\nthe decades to solve these equations efficiently and accurately. In two\ndimensions, an alternative approach is to rewrite the Navier-Stokes equations\nregarding two scalar quantities: the streamfunction and the vorticity. Compared\nto the primitive variables approach, this formulation does not require pressure\nto be computed, thereby avoiding the inherent difficulties associated with the\npressure-velocity coupling.

    "abstract": "Collisional Brownian engines have recently gained attention as alternatives\nto conventional nanoscale engines. However, a comprehensive optimization of\ntheir performance, which could serve as a benchmark for future engine designs,\nis still lacking. In this work, we address this gap by deriving and analyzing\nthe optimal driving protocol for a collisional Brownian engine. By maximizing\nthe average output work, we show that the optimal protocol consists of linear\nforce segments separated by impulsive delta-like kicks that instantaneously\nreverse the particle's velocity. This structure enforces constant velocity\nwithin each stroke, enabling fully analytical expressions for optimal output\npower, efficiency, and entropy production. We demonstrate that the optimal\nprotocol significantly outperforms standard strategies (such as constant,\nlinear, or periodic drivings) achieving higher performance while keeping\nentropy production under control. Remarkably, when evaluated using realistic\nexperimental parameters, the efficiency approaches near-unity at the power\noptimum, with entropy production remaining well controlled, a striking feature\nof the optimal protocol. To analyze a more realistic scenario, we examine the\nimpact of smoothing the delta-like forces by introducing a finite duration and\nfind that, although this reduces efficiency and increases entropy production,\nthe optimal protocol still delivers high power output in a robust manner.\nAltogether, our results provide a theoretical benchmark for finite-time\nthermodynamic optimization of Brownian engines under time-periodic drivings.",

We present results of calculations using density\nfunctionals of all rungs of Jacob's ladder, ranging from LDA to the DM21\nmachine learned local hybrid as well as double hybrids. For DMP$^+$, the\ncommonly used hybrid functionals, such as PBE0(.25) with FE weight of 0.25, as\nwell as PBE0(.32) with a weight of 0.32 only produce the more delocalised\ncharge. The latter mimics the DM21 energy surface well. However, hybrid\nfunctionals with stronger FE, such as BHLYP and PBE0(.50) as well as some\ndouble hybrid functionals, also produce local energy minima corresponding to\nlocalised charge. When full SIC is applied to the PBE functional, an energy\nsurface analogous to hybrid functionals with FE weight of 0.50 is obtained,\nwhile the scaling of SIC by 0.50, which has previously been shown to give\nimproved atomisation energy and band gap of solids, only produces the more\ndelocalised charge. For the 3s Rydberg excited state of DMP, two types of\nconfigurations with a localised hole are obtained in calculations using the\nPBE0(.32) functional, in addition to the delocalised hole, but only the latter\nis found with the PBE functional, showing that a significant reduction of the\nself-interaction error is needed in order to obtain agreement between density\nfunctional calculations and experimental measurements of the Rydberg state",

This work enhances LLMs' comprehension of self-harm by distinguishing\nintent through nuanced language-emoji interplay.

NVM, along with Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM), Solid\nState Disk (SSD), and Disk present a system designer with a wide array of\noptions in designing caching middleware. Moreover, design decisions to\nreplicate a data item in more than one level of a caching memory hierarchy may\nenhance the overall system performance with a faster recovery time in the event\nof a memory failure. Given a fixed budget, the key configuration questions are:\nWhich storage media should constitute the memory hierarchy? What is the storage\ncapacity of each hierarchy? Should data be replicated or partitioned across the\ndifferent levels of the hierarchy? We model these cache configuration questions\nas an instance of the Multiple Choice Knapsack Problem (MCKP). This model is\nguided by the specification of each type of memory along with an application's\ndatabase characteristics and its workload. Although MCKP is NP-complete, its\nlinear programming relaxation is efficiently solvable and can be used to\nclosely approximate the optimal solution. We use the resulting simple algorithm\nto evaluate design tradeoffs in the context of a memory hierarchy for a\nKey-Value Store (e.g., memcached) as well as a host-side cache (e.g.,\nFlashcache). The results show selective replication is appropriate with certain\nfailure rates and workload characteristics.

    "abstract": "Imitation learning has shown great promise in robotic manipulation, but the\npolicy's execution is often unsatisfactorily slow due to commonly tardy\ndemonstrations collected by human operators. In this work, we present\nDemoSpeedup, a self-supervised method to accelerate visuomotor policy execution\nvia entropy-guided demonstration acceleration. DemoSpeedup starts from training\nan arbitrary generative policy (e.g., ACT or Diffusion Policy) on normal-speed\ndemonstrations, which serves as a per-frame action entropy estimator. The key\ninsight is that frames with lower action entropy estimates call for more\nconsistent policy behaviors, which often indicate the demands for\nhigher-precision operations. In contrast, frames with higher entropy estimates\ncorrespond to more casual sections, and therefore can be more safely\naccelerated. Thus, we segment the original demonstrations according to the\nestimated entropy, and accelerate them by down-sampling at rates that increase\nwith the entropy values. Trained with the speedup demonstrations, the resulting\npolicies execute up to 3 times faster while maintaining the task completion\nperformance. Interestingly, these policies could even achieve higher success\nrates than those trained with normal-speed demonstrations, due to the benefits\nof reduced decision-making horizons.

Linear coefficients\nare interpretable as the marginal effect of a feature on the prediction,\nassuming all other features are kept fixed. To combine the benefits of both\napproaches, we introduce NIMO (Nonlinear Interpretable MOdel). The key idea is\nto define a model where the NN is designed to learn nonlinear corrections to\nthe linear model predictions, while also maintaining the original\ninterpretability of the linear coefficients. Relevantly, we develop an\noptimization algorithm based on profile likelihood that elegantly allows for\noptimizing over the NN parameters while updating the linear coefficients\nanalytically. By relying on adaptive ridge regression we can easily incorporate\nsparsity constraints as well. We show empirically that we can recover the\nunderlying linear coefficients while significantly improving the predictive\naccuracy. Compared to other hybrid interpretable approaches, our model is the\nonly one that actually maintains the same interpretability of linear\ncoefficients as in linear models.

This study investigates photoinduced\nultrafast demagnetization in monolayer CrSBr, a two-dimensional material with\nstrong spin-orbit and spin-lattice coupling, and resolves its demagnetization\nprocess. Two key stages are identified: the first, occurring within 20 fs, is\ncharacterized by rapid electron-driven demagnetization, where charge transfer\nand THz laser are strongly coupled. In the second stage, light-induced lattice\nvibrations coupled to spin dynamics lead to significant spin changes, with\nelectron-phonon coupling playing a key role. Importantly, the role of various\nphonon vibration modes in the electron relaxation process was clearly\ndetermined, pointing out that the electronic relaxation of the B3g1 phonon\nvibration mode occurs within 83 fs, which is less than the commonly believed\n100 fs. Moreover, the influence of this coherent phonon on the demagnetization\nchange is as high as 215 %. These insights into multiscale magneto-structural\ncoupling advance the understanding of nonequilibrium spin dynamics and provide\nguidelines for the design of light-controlled quantum devices, particularly in\nlayered heterostructures for spintronics and quantum information technologies.",

    "abstract": "Maintaining an active lifestyle is vital for quality of life, yet challenging\nfor wheelchair users. For instance, powered wheelchairs face increasing risks\nof obesity and deconditioning due to inactivity. Conversely, manual wheelchair\nusers, who propel the wheelchair by pushing the wheelchair's handrims, often\nface upper extremity injuries from repetitive motions. These challenges\nunderscore the need for a mobility system that promotes activity while\nminimizing injury risk. Maintaining optimal exertion during wheelchair use\nenhances health benefits and engagement, yet the variations in individual\nphysiological responses complicate exertion optimization. To address this, we\nintroduce PulseRide, a novel wheelchair system that provides personalized\nassistance based on each user's physiological responses, helping them maintain\ntheir physical exertion goals. Unlike conventional assistive systems focused on\nobstacle avoidance and navigation, PulseRide integrates real-time physiological\ndata-such as heart rate and ECG-with wheelchair speed to deliver adaptive\nassistance. Using a human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning approach with Deep\nQ-Network algorithm (DQN), the system adjusts push assistance to keep users\nwithin a moderate activity range without under- or over-exertion. We conducted\npreliminary tests with 10 users on various terrains, including carpet and\nslate, to assess PulseRide's effectiveness. Our findings show that, for\nindividual users, PulseRide maintains heart rates within the moderate activity\nzone as much as 71.7 percent longer than manual wheelchairs. Among all users,\nwe observed an average reduction in muscle contractions of 41.86 percent,\ndelaying fatigue onset and enhancing overall comfort and engagement. These\nresults indicate that PulseRide offers a healthier, adaptive mobility solution,\nbridging the gap between passive and physically taxing mobility options.",

    "abstract": "The pyroelectric effect in ferroelectric thin films is typically composed of\ndifferent contributions, which are difficult to disentangle. In addition,\nclamping to the substrate interface plays an important role. We studied\nepitaxial (Ba,Sr)TiO$_3$ thin films grown on NdScO$_3$ to see if time-resolved\nmeasurements can shed more light on the complex interaction. In particular, we\ncompare standard measurements of the pyroelectric coefficient by\ntemperature-dependent hysteresis loops to transient deformation measurements on\npicosecond timescales in the same material. The advantage of the time-resolved\napproach lies in its increased sensitivity in thin films compared to that of\npolarization hysteresis measurements. Whereas a fast thermal expansion of the\nferroelectric thin film was observed after femtosecond laser excitation of the\nintermediate SrRuO$_3$ layer, heat diffusion simulations reveal frustration of\nthe thermal expansion, which might be explained with the charge dynamics at the\nSchottky barrier formed at the SrRuO$_3$/(Ba,Sr)TiO$_3$. More studies are\nrequired to quantitatively assess the individual contributions to the\npyroelectric coefficient of the materials used in our layer architecture.",

    "abstract": "Liquid crystal mesophases of achiral molecules are normally achiral, yet in a\nfew materials they spontaneously deracemize and form right- and left-handed\nchiral domains. One mechanism that drives deracemization is molecular shape\nfluctuations between axial chiral conformations, where molecular interactions\nfavor matching chirality and promote helical twist. Cooperative chiral ordering\nmay also play a role in chirality amplification, as when a tiny fraction of\nchiral dopant drives a nematic phase to become cholesteric. We present a model\nof cooperative chiral ordering in liquid crystals using Maier-Saupe theory, and\npredict a phase diagram with a deracemized cholesteric phase as well as racemic\nnematic and isotropic phases. Our model also predicts chirality amplification\nin the nematic phase, which may be observed even in materials where the\nderacemization transition is preempted by a transition to another phase. We\ncompare these results with Monte Carlo simulation studies of the switchable\nchiral Lebwohl-Lasher model, where each spin switches between right- and\nleft-handed chiral states. Simulation results validate the predicted phase\ndiagram, demonstrate chiral amplification in the racemic nematic phase, and\nreveal coarsening dynamics in the deracemized phase. Our results suggest that\ncooperative chiral ordering via molecular shape transitions is a common\nmechanism in liquid crystals.",

Although many\ntwo-body nucleon decays into a vector meson have been experimentally searched\nfor and stringently constrained, a consistent theoretical framework for their\ncalculation is still lacking. In this Letter, we fill the gap by implementing\nchiral matching of all these triple-quark interactions onto hadronic\ninteractions involving octet vector mesons, baryons, and pseudoscalars. This\npaves the way for a consistent and comprehensive study of all relevant BNV\nprocesses. As an illustration of application, we show how degeneracy in the\nparameter space of Wilson coefficients can be broken by synthesizing\nexperimental constraints on nucleon decays into a vector or pseudoscalar meson\nwhen relevant hadronic low-energy constants can be reasonably determined.",

These results extend previous studies of point-contact\ntunneling and demonstrate how interactions qualitatively modify the transport\nproperties of multiterminal topological devices.",

Tensor networks can also represent\nthese states, have more structure and are easier to optimize. However, they can\nbe prohibitively costly computationally in two or higher dimensions. Here, we\npropose a generalization of the perceptron - the perceptrain - which borrows\nfeatures from the two different formalisms. We construct variational many-body\nansatz from a simple network of perceptrains. The network can be thought of as\na neural network with a few distinct features inherited from tensor networks.\nThese include efficient local optimization akin to the density matrix\nrenormalization algorithm, instead of optimizing of all the parameters at once;\nthe possibility to dynamically increase the number of parameters during the\noptimization; the possibility to compress the state to avoid overfitting; and a\nstructure that remains quantum-inspired. We showcase the ansatz using a\ncombination of Variational Monte-Carlo (VMC) and Green Function Monte-Carlo\n(GFMC) on a $10\\times 10$ transverse field quantum Ising model with a long\nrange $1/r^6$ antiferromagnetic interaction. The model corresponds to the\nRydberg (cold) atoms platform proposed for quantum annealing. We consistently\nfind a very high relative accuracy for the ground state energy, around\n$10^{-5}$ for VMC and $10^{-6}$ for GFMC in all regimes of parameters,\nincluding in the vicinity of the quantum phase transition. We used very small\nranks ($\\sim 2-5$) of perceptrains, as opposed to multiples of thousand used in\nmatrix product states. The optimization of the energy was robust with respect\nto the choice of initial conditions and hyper-parameters, in contrast to a\ncommon experience when using neural network wave functions.",

The basic concept is to verify whether the difference in\nvelocity between the WB components is compatible with what is expected from the\nNewton law.

Here we add to the Gaia transverse velocities\nprecise measurements of the third velocity component, the radial velocity (RV),\nin order to identify multiple stars, and to improve the reliability of the test\nby using velocity differences and positions in three dimensions. We use the\nHARPS spectra to determine accurate RV difference between the WB components,\ncorrecting the observed velocities for gravitational redshift and convective\nshift. We exploit the Gaia distance distributions to determine the projected\nand intrinsic separations s and r and the 3-dimensional velocity differences of\nthe binaries.

Their projected separation s is up to 14 kAU, or 0.06 parsec. We\ndetermine distances, eccentricities and position angles to reproduce the\nvelocity differences according to Newton's law, finding reasonable solutions\nfor all WBs but one, and with some systems possibly too near pericenter and/or\nat too high inclination.

A well-known strategy to mitigate this involves using\nnon-maximally entangled states, which Eberhard showed can tolerate lower\ndetection efficiencies. However, existing proposals and demonstrations have\nbeen limited to short distances, as their success rates scale linearly with\nchannel transmittance.

We identify the loss independence\nof the vacuum component amplitude of the prepared state as the source of this\nenhancement. Notably, our scheme requires only quantum interference at a\ncentral station, followed by the detection of a single photon, preserving the\noptimal square-root scaling with channel transmittance.

Under these\nmetrics, conventional IG outperforms recent counterparts.

These features are typically useful for robust\nclassification, which we offer theoretical evidence to illustrate through a\nsynthetic data model. Through systematic studies across multiple model\narchitectures and settings, we find that during the initial stage of AT, the\nmodel tends to learn more cross-class features until the best robustness\ncheckpoint.

Based on these discoveries, we further provide a unified view of two\nexisting properties of AT, including the advantage of soft-label training and\nrobust overfitting.

In this work, we\nleverage this capability to simulate the Hubbard model on a six-site graphene\nhexagon using Qiskit, employing the Iterative Quantum Phase Estimation (IQPE)\nand adiabatic evolution algorithms to determine its ground-state properties.\nOur results show that a single Slater determinant is sufficient to initialize\nIQPE and accurately recover ground-state energies (GSEs) in small-scale Hubbard\nsystems. In noiseless simulations, IQPE converges within a few iterations to\nexact GSEs, while adiabatic simulations yield charge and spin densities and\ncorrelation functions in excellent agreement with exact diagonalization.\nHowever, deploying IQPE and adiabatic evolution on today's noisy quantum\nhardware remains highly challenging. To investigate these limitations in IQPE,\nwe use the Qiskit Aer simulator with a custom noise model tailored to the\ncharacteristics of IBM's real hardware. This model includes realistic\ndepolarizing gate errors, thermal relaxation, and readout noise, allowing us to\nexplore how these factors degrade simulation accuracy. Further, we implement\nthe IQPE algorithm on IBM's ibm_strasbourg and ibm_fez devices for a reduced\nthree-site Hubbard model, enabling direct comparison between simulated and real\nhardware noise.

The overhead mainly comes from\nsanitizer checks due to the frequent and expensive shadow memory access.

    "abstract": "Solar water splitting has received a lot of attention due to its high\nefficiency and clean energy production potential. Herein, based on the band\nalignment principle, the g-C3N4/TiO2-B(001) heterostructure is strategically\ndesigned, then a Li-F co-doping approach is developed and implemented, leading\nto significant enhancement in the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution efficiency\nof the heterostructure systems. The decomposition of water molecule on the\nsurface of heterostructures, the migration and diffusion of proton across the\ninterface, and the hydrogen evolution performance are systematically studied\nand comprehensively analyzed. The results demonstrate that the heterojunction\nsurface exhibits a relatively low energy barrier for water decomposition,\nfacilitating both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution\nreaction (OER). Proton transfer preferentially occurs from the TiO2-B(001)\nsurface to the g-C3N4 surface through the interface. The presence of polar\ncovalent bonds establishes a substantial energy barrier for proton migration\nfrom TiO2-B(001) surface to the interface, representing a rate-determining\nfactor in the hydrogen evolution process. The formation of hydrogen bonds\nsignificantly reduces the migration energy barrier for protons crossing the\ninterface to the g-C3N4 surface. Hydrogen adsorption free energy analysis show\nthat that the heterojunction surface exhibits optimal proton adsorption and\ndesorption characteristics. The synergistic combination of low water\ndecomposition energy barrier, reduced proton migration energy barriers and\nexceptional HER performance endows both g-C3N4/TiO2-B(001) heterostructure and\nLi-F co-doped g-C3N4/TiO2-B(001) heterojunction with remarkbale potential as\nefficient HER photocatalyst.",

However, traditional approaches relying on static\nmodels often struggle with task diversity and dynamic environments.

To address\nthis, we propose a hierarchical framework integrating a prompted Large Language\nModel (LLM) and a GridMask-enhanced fine-tuned Vision Language Model (VLM). The\nLLM decomposes tasks and constructs a global semantic map, while the VLM\nextracts task-specified semantic labels and 2D spatial information from aerial\nimages to support local planning. Within this framework, the aerial robot\nfollows an optimized global semantic path and continuously provides bird-view\nimages, guiding the ground robot's local semantic navigation and manipulation,\nincluding target-absent scenarios where implicit alignment is maintained.\nExperiments on real-world cube or object arrangement tasks demonstrate the\nframework's adaptability and robustness in dynamic environments. To the best of\nour knowledge, this is the first demonstration of an aerial-ground\nheterogeneous system integrating VLM-based perception with LLM-driven task\nreasoning and motion planning.",

In the bottom-layer, we construct a domain-specific Large Processor\nChip Model (LPCM) that introduces novel designs in architecture, training, and\ninference, to address key challenges such as knowledge representation gap, data\nscarcity, correctness assurance, and enormous solution space. In the\nmiddle-layer, leveraging the LPCM's knowledge representation and inference\ncapabilities, we develop the Hardware Design Agent and the Software Design\nAgent to automate the design of hardware and software for processor chips.\nCurrently, several components of QiMeng have been completed and successfully\napplied in various top-layer applications, demonstrating significant advantages\nand providing a feasible solution for efficient, fully automated\nhardware/software design of processor chips. Future research will focus on\nintegrating all components and performing iterative top-down and bottom-up\ndesign processes to establish a comprehensive QiMeng system.",

    "abstract": "In this article, we review modern approaches to building interpretable models\nof property markets using machine learning on the base of mass valuation of\nproperty in the Primorye region, Russia. The researcher, lacking expertise in\nthis topic, encounters numerous difficulties in the effort to build a good\nmodel. The main source of this is the huge difference between noisy real market\ndata and ideal data which is very common in all types of tutorials on machine\nlearning. This paper covers all stages of modeling: the collection of initial\ndata, identification of outliers, the search and analysis of patterns in the\ndata, the formation and final choice of price factors, the building of the\nmodel, and the evaluation of its efficiency. For each stage, we highlight\npotential issues and describe sound methods for overcoming emerging\ndifficulties on actual examples. We show that the combination of classical\nlinear regression with interpolation methods of geostatistics allows to build\nan effective model for land parcels. For flats, when many objects are\nattributed to one spatial point the application of geostatistical methods is\ndifficult. Therefore we suggest linear regression with automatic generation and\nselection of additional rules on the base of decision trees, so called the\nRuleFit method. Thus we show, that despite such a strong restriction as the\nrequirement of interpretability which is important in practical aspects, for\nexample, legal matters, it is still possible to build effective models of real\nproperty markets.",

Depending upon the parameter $\\lambda$, the HHG emission spectrum can\nbe classified into three segments.

In the $\\lambda\\leq0$ regime, we observe the\nmid-gap states (MGSs) hybridize with the bulk, suppressing the earlier observed\nharmonic enhancements.

This is probably because there is no rational explanation for\nwhether the comprehension process of LLMs is aligned with that of experts. In\nthis paper, we propose SCOP to carefully examine how LLMs perform during the\ncomprehension process from a cognitive view. Specifically, it is equipped with\na systematical definition of five requisite skills during the comprehension\nprocess, a strict framework to construct testing data for these skills, and a\ndetailed analysis of advanced open-sourced and closed-sourced LLMs using the\ntesting data. With SCOP, we find that it is still challenging for LLMs to\nperform an expert-level comprehension process. Even so, we notice that LLMs\nshare some similarities with experts, e.g., performing better at comprehending\nlocal information than global information. Further analysis reveals that LLMs\ncan be somewhat unreliable -- they might reach correct answers through flawed\ncomprehension processes. Based on SCOP, we suggest that one direction for\nimproving LLMs is to focus more on the comprehension process, ensuring all\ncomprehension skills are thoroughly developed during training.",

To address the limitations of existing deep\nlearning models in cross-modal feature fusion, domain generalization, and\narchitectural optimization, this study proposes UniPTMs: the first unified\nframework for multi-type PTM prediction. The framework innovatively establishes\na \"Master-Slave\" dual-path collaborative architecture: The master path\ndynamically integrates high-dimensional representations of protein sequences,\nstructures, and evolutionary information through a Bidirectional Gated\nCross-Attention (BGCA) module, while the slave path optimizes feature\ndiscrepancies and recalibration between structural and traditional features\nusing a Low-Dimensional Fusion Network (LDFN).

Enhanced by a novel Hierarchical Contrastive loss function for\nfeature consistency optimization, UniPTMs demonstrates significant performance\nimprovements (3.2%-11.4% MCC and 4.2%-14.3% AP increases) over state-of-the-art\nmodels across five modification types and transcends the Single-Type Prediction\nParadigm.

This setup is\nexpected to produce a sizable number of $e^+e^-$ pairs via nonlinear\nBreit-Wheeler mechanism in the strong-field tunneling regime, with an estimated\nyield of ~0.01-0.1 pairs per collision. This small signal rate typically comes\nalong with large backgrounds originating, e.g., from dumping the high-charge\nprimary beam, secondaries induced by the beam halo, as well as photons and\nlow-energy electrons produced in the electron-laser collision itself. These\nbackgrounds may reach densities of O(100) charged particles per cm^2 (and even\nmore neutral particles) at the surface of the sensing elements, making it a\ntremendous challenge for an unambiguous detection of single particles. In this\nwork, we demonstrate how detectors and methods adapted from high-energy physics\nexperiments, can enable this measurement. The solution presented is based on a\nhighly granular, multi-layer, radiation-hard pixel detector paired with\npowerful particle-tracking algorithms. Using a detailed simulation of the\nexisting experimental setup, we show how the false-positive rate due to\nbackground processes can be reduced by more than an order of magnitude relative\nto the expected signal after full reconstruction. Furthermore, we show that the\nhigh spatial tracking resolution achievable (<10 microns) allows for positron\nmomentum measurements with a resolution of <2%, enabling spectral\ncharacterization of the nonlinear Breit-Wheeler process. Based on our extensive\nsimulation, with a conservatively large background assumption, we show that it\nis possible to measure single Breit-Wheeler positrons in the coming data taking\ncampaign of E320. That would be the first statistically significant observation\nand characterization of this elusive process in the (deep) tunneling regime.",

VAR iteratively estimates the\nresidual in latent space between gradually increasing image scales, a process\nreferred to as next-scale prediction. Thus, the strong priors learned during\npre-training align well with the downstream task (ISR). To our knowledge, only\nVARSR has exploited this synergy so far, showing promising results. However,\ndue to the limitations of existing residual quantizers, VARSR works only at a\nfixed resolution, i.e. it fails to map intermediate outputs to the\ncorresponding image scales. Additionally, it relies on a 1B transformer\narchitecture (VAR-d24), and leverages a large-scale private dataset to achieve\nstate-of-the-art results. We address these limitations through two novel\ncomponents: a) a Hierarchical Image Tokenization approach with a multi-scale\nimage tokenizer that progressively represents images at different scales while\nsimultaneously enforcing token overlap across scales, and b) a Direct\nPreference Optimization (DPO) regularization term that, relying solely on the\nLR and HR tokenizations, encourages the transformer to produce the latter over\nthe former. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a quantizer is\ntrained to force semantically consistent residuals at different scales, and the\nfirst time that preference-based optimization is used to train a VAR. Using\nthese two components, our model can denoise the LR image and super-resolve at\nhalf and full target upscale factors in a single forward pass. Additionally, we\nachieve \\textit{state-of-the-art results on ISR}, while using a small model\n(300M params vs ~1B params of VARSR), and without using external training data.",

This work proposes a\nconceptual framework that integrates Agentic AI with the intent-based paradigm,\noriginally developed in network research, to simplify human-machine interaction\n(HMI) and better align automation systems with the human-centric, sustainable,\nand resilient principles of Industry 5.0. Based on the intent-based processing,\nthe framework allows human operators to express high-level business or\noperational goals in natural language, which are decomposed into actionable\ncomponents. These intents are broken into expectations, conditions, targets,\ncontext, and information that guide sub-agents equipped with specialized tools\nto execute domain-specific tasks. A proof of concept was implemented using the\nCMAPSS dataset and Google Agent Developer Kit (ADK), demonstrating the\nfeasibility of intent decomposition, agent orchestration, and autonomous\ndecision-making in predictive maintenance scenarios.

Nanoantennas (NAs) made from high refractive\nindex dielectrics offer a suitable platform for polariton physics thanks to the\nstrongly confined optical Mie resonances and low optical losses in contrast to\nmetallic NAs. However, Mie modes are mainly confined within the NA, making\ninefficient their coupling with excitons in materials deposited externally.\nHere, we overcome this limitation by using a high-refractive index van der\nWaals material WS$_2$, which allows straightforward fabrication of NAs on gold.\nThe combination of a 27 nm tall WS$_2$ NA and a gold substrate enables strong\nmodification of the Mie mode distribution and field enhancement inside and in\nthe vicinity of the NA. This allows observation of room-temperature\nMie-polaritons (with a Rabi splitting above 80 meV) arising from the strong\ncoupling between Mie modes and the exciton in a monolayer WSe$_2$ placed on\nWS$_2$/gold NAs. We demonstrate strong nonlinearity of Mie-polaritons, one\norder of magnitude higher than for excitons in monolayer WSe$_2$ on gold.

Public\nMobile Network Operators (MNOs), utilizing outdoor macro base stations (BSs),\nsuffer from poor signal penetration.

Shared spectrum models,\nparticularly the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) utilized by private\n4G/5G networks, have emerged as a promising alternative to provide reliable\nindoor service. Moreover, these private networks are equipped with the\nneutral-host (NH) model, seamlessly offloading indoor MNOs' traffic to the\nprivate CBRS network.

Patching these vulnerabilities in a timely manner\nis crucial to restoring the integrity and security of software systems.\nHowever, previous work has shown that vulnerability reports often lack\nproof-of-concept (PoC) exploits, which are essential for fixing the\nvulnerability, testing patches, and avoiding regressions. Creating a PoC\nexploit is challenging because vulnerability reports are informal and often\nincomplete, and because it requires a detailed understanding of how inputs\npassed to potentially vulnerable APIs may reach security-relevant sinks. In\nthis paper, we present PoCGen, a novel approach to autonomously generate and\nvalidate PoC exploits for vulnerabilities in npm packages. This is the first\nfully autonomous approach to use large language models (LLMs) in tandem with\nstatic and dynamic analysis techniques for PoC exploit generation. PoCGen\nleverages an LLM for understanding vulnerability reports, for generating\ncandidate PoC exploits, and for validating and refining them. Our approach\nsuccessfully generates exploits for 77% of the vulnerabilities in the\nSecBench$.$js dataset and 39% in a new, more challenging dataset of 794 recent\nvulnerabilities.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a Finite Element Model Updating framework for identifying\nheterogeneous material distributions in planar Bernoulli-Euler beams based on a\nrotation-free isogeometric formulation. The procedure follows two steps: First,\nthe elastic properties are identified from quasi-static displacements; then,\nthe density is determined from modal data (low frequencies and mode shapes),\ngiven the previously obtained elastic properties. The identification relies on\nthree independent discretizations: the isogeometric finite element mesh, a\nhigh-resolution grid of experimental measurements, and a material mesh composed\nof low-order Lagrange elements. The material mesh approximates the unknown\nmaterial distributions, with its nodal values serving as design variables. The\nerror between experiments and numerical model is expressed in a least squares\nmanner. The objective is minimized using local optimization with the\ntrust-region method, providing analytical derivatives to accelerate\ncomputations. Several numerical examples exhibiting large displacements are\nprovided to test the proposed approach. To alleviate membrane locking, the B2M1\ndiscretization is employed when necessary. Quasi-experimental data is generated\nusing refined finite element models with random noise applied up to 4%. The\nmethod yields satisfactory results as long as a sufficient amount of\nexperimental data is available, even for high measurement noise. Regularization\nis used to ensure a stable solution for dense material meshes. The density can\nbe accurately reconstructed based on the previously identified elastic\nproperties.

This dual\ngranularity approach enables the processing of hour-long videos while\nmaintaining semantic fidelity. Experimental validations demonstrate significant\nperformance improvements, achieving 64.9\\% on LongVideoBench and 68.4\\% on\nVideoMME, which are state-of-the-art results for both training-free and\ntraining-based approaches.

Yet their adoption brings a\nfundamental risk: these models are inherently unstable. Adversarial\nmanipulations can easily fool them, inflating scores and undermining trust.\nTraditionally, such vulnerabilities are addressed through data-driven defenses\n-- adversarial retraining, regularization, or input purification. But what if\nthis is the wrong lens? What if robustness in perceptual models is not\nsomething to learn but something to design? In this work, we propose a\nprovocative idea: robustness as an architectural prior. Rather than training\nmodels to resist perturbations, we reshape their internal structure to suppress\nsensitivity from the ground up. We achieve this by enforcing orthogonal\ninformation flow, constraining the network to norm-preserving operations -- and\nfurther stabilizing the system through pruning and fine-tuning. The result is a\nrobust IQA architecture that withstands adversarial attacks without requiring\nadversarial training or significant changes to the original model. This\napproach suggests a shift in perspective: from optimizing robustness through\ndata to engineering it through design.",

This\nindicates that viability of the electroweak baryogenesis requires the phase\ntransition to be slightly stronger than previously anticipated. Finally, we\npresent a general template for analysing such viability in a wide class of\nbeyond the Standard Model theories, in which new fields are heavy enough to be\nintegrated out at high temperature.",

This result\ncontradicts a previous study that, based on density-functional theory\ncalculations and crystal-chemistry arguments, predicted a pressure-driven\ntransition from beta-SnWO4 to alpha-SnWO4. Our analysis indicates that the\nobserved decomposition is unrelated to mechanical or dynamic instabilities.\nInstead, it likely stems from frustration of the beta-alpha transition, as this\ntransformation requires a change in Sn coordination from octahedral to\ntetrahedral. The assessment of how pressure influences the volume of the unit\ncell provided an accurate determination of the room-temperature pressure-volume\nequation of state for beta-SnWO4. Furthermore, the elastic constants and\nmoduli, as well as the pressure dependence of Raman and infrared modes of\nbeta-SnWO4, were derived from density-functional theory calculations.

In its most\nbasic form, it asks for the set of substrings of a given string $S$ of length\n$n$ that occur at least $\\tau$ times in $S$, for some integer $\\tau\\in[1,n]$.\nWe introduce a resilient version of this classic problem, which we term the\n$(\\tau, k)$-Resilient Pattern Mining (RPM) problem. Given a string $S$ of\nlength $n$ and two integers $\\tau, k\\in[1,n]$, RPM asks for the set of\nsubstrings of $S$ that occur at least $\\tau$ times in $S$, even when the\nletters at any $k$ positions of $S$ are substituted by other letters.

We then present experiments on real large-scale datasets from\ndifferent domains demonstrating that: (I) The notion of resilient substrings is\nuseful in analyzing genomic data and is more powerful than that of frequent\nsubstrings, in scenarios where resilience is required, such as in the case of\nversioned datasets; (II) Our algorithm is several orders of magnitude faster\nand more space-efficient than a baseline algorithm that is based on dynamic\nprogramming; and (III) Clustering based on resilient substrings is effective.",

Drawing from\noptimal transport and recent advances in Lorentzian geometry and causality\ntheory, we define a \\emph{synthetic null hypersurface} as a triple $(H, G,\n\\mathfrak{m})$: $H$ is a closed achronal set in a topological causal space, $G$\nis a gauge function encoding affine parametrizations along null generators, and\n$\\mathfrak{m}$ is a Radon measure serving as a synthetic analog of the rigged\nmeasure. This generalizes classical differential geometric structures to\npotentially singular spacetimes.\n  A central object is the \\emph{synthetic null energy condition}\n($\\mathsf{NC}^e(N)$), defined via the concavity of an entropy power functional\nalong optimal transport, with parametrization given by the gauge $G$. This\ncondition is invariant under changes of gauge and measure within natural\nequivalence classes. It agrees with the classical Null Energy Condition in the\nsmooth setting and it applies to low-regularity spacetimes. A key property of\n($\\mathsf{NC}^e(N)$) is the stability under convergence of synthetic null\nhypersurfaces, inspired by measured Gromov--Hausdorff convergence.\n  As a first application, we obtain a synthetic version of Hawking's area\ntheorem.

Contrary to\nthe NiI2 case, the phase transition to helimagnetism rapidly shifts to lower\ntemperatures with increasing pressure. Similar to the NiI2, the Neel\ntemperature increases with pressure. The rate of increase accelerates when the\nhelimagnetic phase is suppressed by pressure. The ab initio calculations link\nthese contrasting trends to pressure-enhanced magnetic exchange interactions.\nSimilarly to the NiI2 case, the stabilization of the collinear AFM phase is\ndriven primarily by the second-nearest interlayer coupling (j2'). Furthermore,\nthe ratio of in-plane interactions makes helimagnetic order in NiBr2 much more\nvolatile, which permits its suppression with already small pressures.

It\nillustrates the diversity of photographic 3D digitization methods, but this is\nnot its only objective. Using a selection of objects from the collections of\nthe mus{\\'e}e d'Arch{\\'e}ologie nationale, it shows that no single method is\nsuitable for all cases. Rather, the method to be recommended for a given object\nshould be the result of a concerted choice between those involved in heritage\nand those involved in the digital domain, as each new object may require the\nadaptation of existing tools. It would therefore be pointless to attempt an\nabsolute classification of 3D digitization methods. On the contrary, we need to\nfind the digital tool best suited to each object, taking into account not only\nits characteristics, but also the future use of its digital twin.",

    "abstract": "Byzantine agreement is a fundamental problem in fault-tolerant distributed\ncomputing that has been studied intensively for the last four decades. Much of\nthe research has focused on a static Byzantine adversary, where the adversary\nis constrained to choose the Byzantine nodes in advance of the protocol's\nexecution. This work focuses on the harder case of an adaptive Byzantine\nadversary that can choose the Byzantine nodes \\emph{adaptively} based on the\nprotocol's execution. While efficient $O(\\log n)$-round protocols ($n$ is the\ntotal number of nodes) are known for the static adversary (Goldwasser, Pavlov,\nand Vaikuntanathan, FOCS 2006) tolerating up to $t < n/(3+\\epsilon)$ Byzantine\nnodes, $\\Omega(t/\\sqrt{n \\log n})$ rounds is a well-known lower bound for\nadaptive adversary [Bar-Joseph and Ben-Or, PODC 1998]. The best-known protocol\nfor adaptive adversary runs in $O(t/\\log n)$ rounds [Chor and Coan, IEEE Trans.\nSoft. Engg., 1985].\n  This work presents a synchronous randomized Byzantine agreement protocol\nunder an adaptive adversary that improves over previous results. Our protocol\nworks under the powerful \\emph{adaptive rushing adversary in the full\ninformation model}. That is, we assume that the Byzantine nodes can behave\narbitrarily and maliciously, have knowledge about the entire state of the\nnetwork at every round, including random choices made by all the nodes up to\nand including the current round, have unlimited computational power, and may\ncollude among themselves. Furthermore, the adversary can \\emph{adaptively}\ncorrupt up to $t < n/3$ nodes based on the protocol's execution. We present a\nsimple randomized Byzantine agreement protocol that runs in $O(\\min\\{t^2\\log\nn/n, t/\\log n\\})$ rounds that improves over the long-standing bound of\n$O(t/\\log n)$ rounds due to Chor and Coan [IEEE Trans.

This feature\nhas increased in amplitude over our observing seasons, and we measure its\nevolution in both amplitude and phase from year to year. Finally, we assess\ncolor as a function of phase and brightness.

In particular\nfor the latter, the intrinsic noise in the Jastrow factor due to its\noptimisation by VMC can pose a problem, especially when targeting weak\n(non-covalent) interactions. In this paper, we propose a deterministic\nalternative to VMC Jastrow optimisation, based on minimising the \"variance of\nthe TC reference energy\" in a standard basis set. Analytic expressions for the\nderivatives of the TC Hamiltonian matrix elements are derived and implemented.\nThis approach can be used to optimise the parameters in the Jastrow functions,\neither from scratch or to refine an initial VMC-based guess, to produce\nnoise-free Jastrows in a reproducible manner. Applied to the first row atoms\nand molecules, the results show that the method yields Slater-Jastrow\nwavefunctions whose variances are almost as low as those obtained from standard\nVMC variance optimisation, but whose energies are lower, and comparable to\nthose obtained from energy-minimisation VMC. We propose that the method can be\nused both in the context of the transcorrelated method or in standard VMC as a\nnew way to optimise Jastrow functions.",

To\naddress these challenges, we propose \\textbf{ICPC-Eval}, a top-level\ncompetitive coding benchmark designed to probing the frontiers of LLM\nreasoning. ICPC-Eval includes 118 carefully curated problems from 11 recent\nICPC contests held in various regions of the world, offering three key\ncontributions: 1) A challenging realistic ICPC competition scenario, featuring\na problem type and difficulty distribution consistent with actual contests. 2)\nA robust test case generation method and a corresponding local evaluation\ntoolkit, enabling efficient and accurate local evaluation. 3) An effective\ntest-time scaling evaluation metric, Refine@K, which allows iterative repair of\nsolutions based on execution feedback. The results underscore the significant\nchallenge in evaluating complex reasoning abilities: top-tier reasoning models\nlike DeepSeek-R1 often rely on multi-turn code feedback to fully unlock their\nin-context reasoning potential when compared to non-reasoning counterparts.\nFurthermore, despite recent advancements in code generation, these models still\nlag behind top-performing human teams.

By proving that the \\emph{constraint\nmatrix} is totally unimodular (TU) for certain classes of problems, the ILP\nformulation can be relaxed into a Linear Programming (LP) problem without\nlosing the integrality of the solution.

The method guarantees computational tractability, handles collision\navoidance and reduces computational demands through iterative LP optimization\ntechniques. Case studies demonstrate the efficiency of the algorithm in\ngenerating scalable, collision-free paths for large robot teams navigating in\ncomplex environments. While the conservative nature of collision avoidance\nintroduces additional constraints, and thus, computational requirements, the\nsolution remains practical and impactful for diverse applications. The\nalgorithm is particularly applicable to real-world scenarios, including\nwarehouse logistics where autonomous robots must efficiently coordinate tasks\nor search-and-rescue operations in various environments. This work contributes\nboth theoretically and practically to scalable multi-robot path planning and\ntask allocation, offering an efficient framework for coordinating autonomous\nagents in shared environments.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in both image generation\nand editing. However, recent studies have revealed their vulnerability to\nbackdoor attacks, in which specific patterns embedded in the input can\nmanipulate the model's behavior. Most existing research in this area has\nproposed attack frameworks focused on the image generation pipeline, leaving\nbackdoor attacks in image editing relatively unexplored. Among the few studies\ntargeting image editing, most utilize visible triggers, which are impractical\nbecause they introduce noticeable alterations to the input image before\nediting. In this paper, we propose a novel attack framework that embeds\ninvisible triggers into the image editing process via poisoned training data.\nWe leverage off-the-shelf deep watermarking models to encode imperceptible\nwatermarks as backdoor triggers. Our goal is to make the model produce the\npredefined backdoor target when it receives watermarked inputs, while editing\nclean images normally according to the given prompt. With extensive experiments\nacross different watermarking models, the proposed method achieves promising\nattack success rates. In addition, the analysis results of the watermark\ncharacteristics in term of backdoor attack further support the effectiveness of\nour approach.

In this work, we\nargue that CBMs do not impose a true bottleneck: the fact that a component can\npredict a concept does not guarantee that it encodes only information about\nthat concept. This shortcoming raises concerns regarding interpretability and\nthe validity of intervention procedures. To overcome this limitation, we\npropose Minimal Concept Bottleneck Models (MCBMs), which incorporate an\nInformation Bottleneck (IB) objective to constrain each representation\ncomponent to retain only the information relevant to its corresponding concept.\nThis IB is implemented via a variational regularization term added to the\ntraining loss.

Specifically, we perform a study of the\nbehaviour of the so-called internal force and pressure of these extended\nfield-theoretic solitonic objects, which are derived from the energy-momentum\ntensor. Our method is slightly different from the so-called Laue's criterion\nfor stability of nuclear matter, a local form of which had been proposed and\napplied in the earlier literature to the `t Hooft-Polyakov (HP) magnetic\nmonopole, and found to be violated.By applying our method first to HP monopole,\nwe also observe that, despite its topological stability, the total (finite)\ninternal force (which has only radial components) is directed inwards, towards\nthe centre of the monopole, which would imply instability. Thus this mechanical\ncriterion for stability is arguably violated in the case of the HP monopole, as\nis the local version of Laue's criterion. The criterion is satisfied for the\nshort-range part of the energy momentum tensor, in which the long-range part,\ndue to the massless photon of the U(1) subgroup, is subtracted. Par contrast,\nthe total internal force of the Cho-Maison (CM) electroweak monopole has both\nradial and angular components, which diverge at the origin, leading to\nrotational instabilities. Finally, by studying finite-energy extensions of the\nCM, either with non-minimal Higgs couplings with the hypercharge sector or\nhypercharge Born-Infeld type models, we find that the total force, integrated\nover space, is finite, but it has also angular components in the Born-Infeld\ncase. The latter feature is interpreted as indicating that the Born-Infeld-CM\nmonopole might be subject to rotations upon the action of perturbations, but it\ndoes not necessarily imply instabilities of the configuration.",

Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) and Pulsar Polarization Arrays (PPAs) aim\nto detect this dark matter through timing and polarization measurements,\nrespectively, of pulsars. The PTA relies on gravitational effects, as the ALDM\nhalo perturbs the spacetime metric within the Milky Way, while the PPA detects\nnon-gravitational effects, namely cosmological birefringence induced by the\nALDM Chern-Simons coupling with photons. These two methods complement each\nother, synergistically enhancing the pulsar array's capability to identify the\nALDM signals in the data. In this article, we provide a foundational\ndevelopment of this synergy. We begin by revisiting previously derived\ntwo-point correlation functions for both PTA and PPA, and expand our analysis\nto include correlations between timing and polarization signals. We then\nconstruct likelihood functions for PTA and combined PTA-PPA analyses within a\nBayesian framework, aimed at detecting the characteristic correlations of ALDM\nsignals. We emphasize the non-Gaussianity of the ALDM timing signals, which\narises from their non-linear dependence on the field, in contrast to the\nGaussian nature of its polarization signals. To address the complexities\nintroduced, we approach this investigation in two ways: one involves a Gaussian\napproximation with proper justifications, while the other derives the formalism\nfrom the generic Gaussian characteristics of the ALDM field.

    "abstract": "We revisit the question of whether the Crane-Yetter topological quantum field\ntheory (TQFT) associated to a modular tensor category admits a fully extended\nrefinement. More specifically, we use tools from stable homotopy theory to\nclassify extensions of invertible four-dimensional TQFTs to theories valued in\nsymmetric monoidal 4-categories whose Picard spectrum has nontrivial homotopy\nonly in degrees 0 and 4. We show that such extensions are classified by two\npieces of data: an equivalence class of an invertible object in the target and\na sixth root of unity. Applying this result to the 4-category $\\mathbf{BrFus}$\nof braided fusion categories, we find that there are infinitely many\nequivalence classes of fully extended invertible TQFTs reproducing the\nCrane-Yetter partition function on top-dimensional manifolds, parametrized by a\n$\\mathbb{Z}/6$-extension of the Witt group of nondegenerate braided fusion\ncategories.\n  This analysis clarifies common claims in the literature and raises the\nquestion of how to naturally pick out the $SO(4)$-fixed point data on the\nframed TQFT which assigns the input braided fusion category to the point so\nthat it selects the Crane-Yetter state-sum.",

    "abstract": "The Active Flux (AF) is a compact, high-order finite volume scheme that\nallows more flexibility by introducing additional point value degrees of\nfreedom at cell interfaces. This paper proposes a positivity-preserving (PP) AF\nscheme for solving the ideal magnetohydrodynamics, where the Godunov-Powell\nsource term is employed to deal with the divergence-free constraint. For the\nevolution of the cell average, apart from the standard conservative finite\nvolume method for the flux derivative, the nonconservative source term is built\non the quadratic reconstruction in each cell, which maintains the compact\nstencil in the AF scheme. For the point value update, the local Lax-Friedrichs\n(LLF) flux vector splitting is adopted for the flux derivative, originally\nproposed in [Duan, Barsukow, and Klingenberg, SIAM Journal on Scientific\nComputing, 47(2), A811--A837, 2025], and a central difference is used to\ndiscretize the divergence in the source term. A parametrized flux limiter and a\nscaling limiter are presented to preserve the density and pressure positivity\nby blending the AF scheme with the first-order PP LLF scheme with the source\nterm. To suppress oscillations, a new shock sensor considering the divergence\nerror is proposed, which is used to compute the blending coefficients for the\ncell average. Several numerical tests are conducted to verify the third-order\naccuracy, PP property, and shock-capturing ability of the scheme. The key role\nof the Godunov-Powell source term and its suitable discretization in\ncontrolling divergence error is also validated.",

To robustly search for ultra-low-frequency GWs,\npulsar timing arrays (PTAs) need to use models to describe the noise from the\nindividual pulsars. We report on the results from the single pulsar noise\nanalysis of the CPTA data release I (DR1). Conventionally, power laws in the\nfrequency domain are used to describe pulsar red noise and dispersion\nmeasurement (DM) variations over time. Employing Bayesian methods, we found the\nchoice of number and range of frequency bins with the highest evidence for each\npulsar individually. A comparison between a dataset using DM piecewise measured\n(DMX) values and a power-law Gaussian process to describe the DM variations\nshows strong Bayesian evidence in favour of the power-law model. Furthermore,\nwe demonstrate that the constraints obtained from four independent software\npackages are very consistent with each other. The short time span of the CPTA\nDR1, paired with the large sensitivity of FAST, has proved to be a challenge\nfor the conventional noise model using a power law. This mainly shows in the\ndifficulty to separate different noise terms due to their covariances with each\nother. Nineteen pulsars are found to display covariances between the short-term\nwhite noise and long-term red and DM noise. With future CPTA datasets, we\nexpect that the degeneracy can be broken. Finally, we compared the CPTA DR1\nresults against the noise properties found by other PTA collaborations. While\nwe can see broad agreement, there is some tension between different PTA\ndatasets for some of the overlapping pulsars.

To address these concerns, a novel dynamic HI\nthat considers HI-level temporal dependence is constructed through an\nunsupervised framework. Specifically, a degradation feature learning module\ncomposed of a skip-connection-based autoencoder first maps raw signals to a\nrepresentative degradation feature space (DFS) to automatically extract\nessential degradation features without the need for expert knowledge.\nSubsequently, in this DFS, a new HI-generating module embedded with an inner\nHI-prediction block is proposed for dynamic HI construction, where the temporal\ndependence between past and current HI states is guaranteed and modeled\nexplicitly. On this basis, the dynamic HI captures the inherent dynamic\ncontents of the degradation process, ensuring its effectiveness for degradation\ntendency modeling and future degradation prognostics. The experiment results on\ntwo bearing lifecycle datasets demonstrate that the proposed HI construction\nmethod outperforms comparison methods, and the constructed dynamic HI is\nsuperior for prognostic tasks.",

The contact tractions between interacting discrete segments are\nevaluated with respect to a midplane in a single pass, inherently maintaining\nthe equilibrium of tractions. These tractions are based on the penalisation of\ntrue interpenetration between opposite surfaces, and the procedure of their\nintegral for discrete contacting segments is described in this paper. A\nmeticulous examination of the different possible geometric configurations of\ninteracting 3D segments is presented to develop visual understanding and better\ntraction evaluation accuracy. The accuracy and robustness of the proposed\nmethod are validated against the analytical solutions of the contact patch\ntest, two-beam bending, Hertzian contact, and flat punch test, thus proving the\ncapability to reproduce contact between flat surfaces, curved surfaces, and\nsharp corners in contact, respectively. The method passes the contact patch\ntest with the uniform transmission of contact pressure matching the accuracy\nlevels of finite elements. It converges towards the analytical solution with\nmesh refinement and a suitably high penalty factor. The effectiveness of the\nproposed algorithm also extends to self-contact problems and has been tested\nfor self-contact between flat and curved surfaces with inelastic material.\nDynamic problems of elastic and inelastic collisions between bars, as well as\noblique collisions of cylinders, are also presented.

A key factor in achieving\nhigh error correction performance is the use of soft-decision decoding for\ncomponent codes. However, implementing optimal maximum a posteriori (MAP)\nprobability decoding for commonly used component codes, such as BCH and Polar\ncodes, is computationally prohibitive. Instead, practical systems rely on\napproximations, with the Chase-Pyndiah algorithm being a widely used suboptimal\nmethod. TPC are more powerful than their component codes and begin to function\neffectively at low signal-to-noise ratios. Consequently, during the initial\niterations, the component codes do not perform well and introduce errors in the\nextrinsic information updates. This phenomenon limits the performance of TPC.\nThis paper proposes a neural network-aided rollback Chase-Pyndiah decoding\nmethod to address this issue. A transformer-based neural network identifies\ncases where extrinsic updates are likely to introduce errors, triggering a\nrollback mechanism which prevents the update and keeps the component code\nmessage intact. Our results demonstrate that a neural network with a relatively\nsmall number of parameters can effectively distinguish destructive updates and\nimprove decoding performance. We evaluate the proposed approach using TPC with\n(256, 239) extended BCH component codes. We show that the proposed method\nenhances the bit error rate performance of Chase-Pyndiah p=6 decoding,\nachieving a gain of approximately 0.145 dB in a TPC scheme with four full\niterations, significantly outperforming conventional Chase p=7 decoding.",

The plasmonic response of the core-shell\nnanoparticle is described by incorporating Mie theory with electronic\ntemperature corrections to the refractive indices of gold, based on a Drude\nLorentz formulation. The thermal response of the core-shell nanoparticles is\nmodeled by coupling the two temperature model with molecular dynamics\nsimulations, providing an atomistic description of nanoscale heat transfer. We\ninvestigate nanoparticles with both dense and porous silica shells (with 50%\nporosity) under laser pulse durations of 100 fs, 10 ps, and 1 ns, and over a\nrange of fluences between 0.05 and 5mJ/cm2. We show that nanoparticles with a\nthin dense silica shell (5 nm) exhibit significantly faster water heating\ncompared to bare gold nanoparticles. This behavior is attributed to enhanced\nelectron-phonon coupling at the gold silica interface and to the relatively\nhigh thermal conductance between silica and water.

These modes allow for a look inside the stars. Among the parameters\nused to characterize mixed modes is the coupling strength q, which is sensitive\nto the stellar structure in the evanescent zone near the bottom of the\nconvective envelope.\n  Aims. The aim of this work is to probe the validity of the weak and strong\ncoupling approximations, commonly used to calculate q, during stellar evolution\nalong the red-giant branch (RGB).\n  Methods. To test the approximations empirically, we calculate q-values in\nboth, the weak and strong limit for stellar models on the RGB and compare them\nto the coupling derived from the mixed mode frequency pattern obtained from\nnumerical solutions to the oscillation equations.\n  Results. We find good agreement with the strong coupling approximation on the\nearly RGB, when the evanescent zone lies in the radiative layer right above the\nhydrogen-burning shell; and with the weak coupling approximation once the\nevanescent zone is situated in the convective envelope. This is consistent with\nearlier studies. Additionally, we find that it is viable to use the weak\ncoupling approximation as an estimate for q in the intermediate regime, in the\nmass range considered in this work (1.00 Msun <= M <= 2.00 Msun).\n  Conclusions. The width of the evanescent zone serves as a good measure for\nwhich approximation to use.

During May 2024, AR 13664 was among the most flare-productive\nregions in recent decades, generating 55 M-class and 12 X-class flares along\nwith multiple Earth-directed CMEs. The rapid succession of these CMEs triggered\nthe most intense geomagnetic storm in two decades. We study coronal dimmings\nfrom a single active region (AR 13664) and compare them with statistical\ndimming properties. We investigate how coronal dimming parameters - such as\narea, brightness, and magnetic flux - relate to key flare and CME properties.\nWe systematically identified all flares above M1.0, all coronal dimmings and\nall CMEs (from the CDAW SOHO/LASCO catalogue) produced by AR 13664 during 2024\nMay 1 - 15, and studied the associations between the different phenomena and\ntheir characteristic parameters. We detect coronal dimmings in 22 events, with\n16 occurring on-disc and six off-limb. Approximately 83% of X-class flares and\n23% of M-class flares are associated with CMEs, with 13 out of 16 on-disc\ndimmings linked to CME activity. Our results support the strong interplay\nbetween coronal dimmings and flares, as we find increased correlations between\nflare and dimming parameters in this single-AR study compared to the general\ndimming population. Furthermore, we confirm that coronagraphic observations,\nunable to observe the lower corona, underestimate correlations between CME\nvelocities and dimming parameters, as they fail to capture the early CME\nacceleration phase. This highlights the critical role of dimming observations\nin providing a more comprehensive understanding of CME dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Logical reasoning is a core capability for many applications of large\nlanguage models (LLMs), yet existing benchmarks often rely solely on\nfinal-answer accuracy, failing to capture the quality and structure of the\nreasoning process. We propose FineLogic, a fine-grained evaluation framework\nthat assesses logical reasoning across three dimensions: overall benchmark\naccuracy, stepwise soundness, and representation-level alignment. In addition,\nto better understand how reasoning capabilities emerge, we conduct a\ncomprehensive study on the effects of supervision format during fine-tuning. We\nconstruct four supervision styles (one natural language and three symbolic\nvariants) and train LLMs under each. Our findings reveal that natural language\nsupervision yields strong generalization even on out-of-distribution and\nlong-context tasks, while symbolic reasoning styles promote more structurally\nsound and atomic inference chains. Further, our representation-level probing\nshows that fine-tuning primarily improves reasoning behaviors through\nstep-by-step generation, rather than enhancing shortcut prediction or\ninternalized correctness. Together, our framework and analysis provide a more\nrigorous and interpretable lens for evaluating and improving logical reasoning\nin LLMs.",

The accurate\nrecognition of this vast number of characters, termed mega-category\nrecognition, presents a formidable yet crucial challenge for cultural heritage\npreservation and digital applications. Despite significant advances in Optical\nCharacter Recognition (OCR), mega-category recognition remains unexplored due\nto the absence of comprehensive datasets, with the largest existing dataset\ncontaining merely 16,151 categories. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce\nMegaHan97K, a mega-category, large-scale dataset covering an unprecedented\n97,455 categories of Chinese characters. Our work offers three major\ncontributions: (1) MegaHan97K is the first dataset to fully support the latest\nGB18030-2022 standard, providing at least six times more categories than\nexisting datasets; (2) It effectively addresses the long-tail distribution\nproblem by providing balanced samples across all categories through its three\ndistinct subsets: handwritten, historical and synthetic subsets; (3)\nComprehensive benchmarking experiments reveal new challenges in mega-category\nscenarios, including increased storage demands, morphologically similar\ncharacter recognition, and zero-shot learning difficulties, while also\nunlocking substantial opportunities for future research.

However, no significant\nfeatures were detected above a 3 sigma signal-to-noise threshold, which limits\nour ability to further investigate the association between NGC 5634 and the\nSagittarius (Sgr) stream based on morphological evidence. Incorporating GAIA\ndata, we further examine the orbital path of NGC 5634. We found that its orbit\nonly briefly intersects with the Sgr stream and diverges significantly over\nlong-term integrations. This behavior contrasts with that of confirmed\nSgr-associated clusters, whose orbits remain closely aligned with the stream\nthroughout their orbital evolution. Additionally, NGC 5634 exhibits a\nrelatively shorter semi-major axis and smaller apocenter and pericenter\ndistances compared to Sgr clusters. These orbital characteristics are more\nconsistent with clusters associated with the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) or\nthe Helmi streams. From a dynamical perspective, in the Lz-E space, NGC 5634 is\nalso distinctly different from Sgr clusters and aligns more closely with the\nGSE and Helmi regions. Taken together, these findings do not support a strong\nconnection between NGC 5634 and the Sgr dSph, but instead suggest a potential\nassociation with another progenitor system, such as GSE or Helmi stream.\nNevertheless, further evidence is needed to definitively establish its origin.",

Specifically, we\nidentify a critical regime where squared gradients become substantially smaller\nthan the second-order moment estimates, causing the latter to undergo a\n$\\beta_2$-exponential decay and to respond sluggishly to current gradient\ninformation. This mechanism can push the maximum eigenvalue of the\npreconditioned Hessian beyond the classical stability threshold $2/\\eta$ for a\nsustained period, inducing instability. This instability further leads to an\nalignment between the gradient and the maximum eigendirection, and a loss spike\noccurs precisely when the gradient-directional curvature exceeds $2/\\eta$.

RANSAC\nand its variants are the gold standard for estimating geometric models (e.g.,\nhomographies, relative/absolute poses) from outlier-contaminated data. Despite\nRANSAC's apparent simplicity, achieving consistently high performance across\ndifferent problems is challenging. While recent research often focuses on\nimproving specific RANSAC components (e.g., sampling, scoring), overall\nperformance is frequently more influenced by the \"bells and whistles\" (i.e.,\nthe implementation details and problem-specific optimizations) within a given\nlibrary. Popular frameworks like OpenCV and PoseLib demonstrate varying\nperformance, excelling in some tasks but lagging in others.

    "abstract": "Excitons in biased bilayer graphene are electrically tunable optical\nexcitations residing in the mid-infrared (MIR) spectral range, where intrinsic\noptical transitions are typically scarce. Such a tunable material system with\nan excitonic response offer a rare platform for exploring light-matter\ninteractions and optical hybridization of quasiparticles residing in the long\nwavelength spectrum. In this work, we demonstrate that when the bilayer is\nencapsulated in hexagonal-boron-nitride (hBN)-a material supporting optical\nphonons and hyperbolic-phonon-polaritons (HPhPs) in the MIR-the excitons can be\ntuned into resonance with the HPhP modes. We find that the overlap in energy\nand momentum of the two MIR quasiparticles facilitate the formation of multiple\nstrongly coupled hybridized exciton-HPhP states. Using an electromagnetic\ntransmission line model, we derive the dispersion relations of the hybridized\nstates and show that they are highly affected and can be manipulated by the\nsymmetry of the system, determining the hybridization selection rules. Our\nresults establish a general tunable MIR platform for engineering strongly\ncoupled quasiparticle states in biased graphene systems, opening new directions\nfor studying and controlling light-matter interactions in the long-wavelength\nregime.",

Existing methods\noften rely on task-specific embeddings that are tailored either for semantic\nunderstanding or geometric reconstruction.

In this paper, we propose Object-X, a versatile multi-modal\nobject representation framework capable of encoding rich object embeddings\n(e.g. images, point cloud, text) and decoding them back into detailed geometric\nand visual reconstructions. Object-X operates by geometrically grounding the\ncaptured modalities in a 3D voxel grid and learning an unstructured embedding\nfusing the information from the voxels with the object attributes.

Evaluations on two challenging\nreal-world datasets demonstrate that Object-X produces high-fidelity novel-view\nsynthesis comparable to standard 3D Gaussian Splatting, while significantly\nimproving geometric accuracy.

This inefficiency becomes a\nmajor scalability bottleneck in long-context learning scenarios.

By incorporating appropriate boundary\nconditions, we develop a set of differential equations that accurately simulate\nthe decay curves of various simultaneously stored ions in the storage ring:\n$^{205}$Tl$^{81+}$, $^{205}$Pb$^{81+}$, $^{205}$Pb$^{82+}$, $^{200}$Hg$^{79+}$,\nand $^{200}$Hg$^{80+}$. Through a quantitative comparison between simulations\nand experimental data, we provide insights into the detailed reaction\nmechanisms governing stored heavy ions within the storage ring. Our approach\neffectively models charge-changing processes, reduces the complexity of the\nexperimental setup, and provides a simpler method for measuring the decay\nhalf-lives of highly charged ions in storage rings.",

To harness this insight, we propose SPACE, a unified framework that\njointly enhances factuality and faithfulness by editing shared activation\nsubspaces.

When $\\upsilon =\n\\mathcal{O}(1)$, the best prior known regret upper bound is\n$\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(d T^{\\frac{1}{1+\\epsilon}})$. While a lower with the same\nscaling has been given, it relies on a construction using $\\upsilon =\n\\mathcal{O}(d)$, and adapting the construction to the bounded-moment regime\nwith $\\upsilon = \\mathcal{O}(1)$ yields only a\n$\\Omega(d^{\\frac{\\epsilon}{1+\\epsilon}} T^{\\frac{1}{1+\\epsilon}})$ lower bound.\nThis matches the known rate for multi-armed bandits and is generally loose for\nlinear bandits, in particular being $\\sqrt{d}$ below the optimal rate in the\nfinite-variance case ($\\epsilon = 1$).

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant challenges in edge deployment\ndue to their massive parameter scale. Vector Quantization (VQ), a\nclustering-based quantization method, serves as a prevalent solution to this\nissue for its extremely low-bit (even at 2-bit) and considerable accuracy.\nSince a vector is a quantity in mathematics and physics that has both direction\nand magnitude, existing VQ works typically quantize them in a coupled manner.\nHowever, we find that direction exhibits significantly greater sensitivity to\nquantization compared to the magnitude. For instance, when separately\nclustering the directions and magnitudes of weight vectors in LLaMA-2-7B, the\naccuracy drop of zero-shot tasks are 46.5\\% and 2.3\\%, respectively. This gap\neven increases with the reduction of clustering centers. Further, Euclidean\ndistance, a common metric to access vector similarities in current VQ works,\nplaces greater emphasis on reducing the magnitude error. This property is\ncontrary to the above finding, unavoidably leading to larger quantization\nerrors. To these ends, this paper proposes Polar Coordinate Decoupled Vector\nQuantization (PCDVQ), an effective and efficient VQ framework consisting of two\nkey modules: 1) Polar Coordinate Decoupling (PCD), which transforms vectors\ninto their polar coordinate representations and perform independent\nquantization of the direction and magnitude parameters.2) Distribution Aligned\nCodebook Construction (DACC), which optimizes the direction and magnitude\ncodebooks in accordance with the source distribution. Experimental results show\nthat PCDVQ outperforms baseline methods at 2-bit level by at least 1.5\\%\nzero-shot accuracy, establishing a novel paradigm for accurate and highly\ncompressed LLMs.",

By leveraging attention mechanisms, GTs are capable of\nmodeling long-range dependencies and complex structural relationships beyond\nlocal neighborhoods.

Our\nbenchmark evaluates GTs from multiple perspectives, encompassing diverse tasks\nand datasets with varying properties.

To mitigate these limitations, we\nexplore the use of zero-shot LLM-based query expansion to improve sparse\nretrieval, particularly for learned sparse retrievers. We introduce a novel\nfusion ranking framework, Exp4Fuse, which enhances the performance of sparse\nretrievers through an indirect application of zero-shot LLM-based query\nexpansion.

We conduct extensive\nevaluations of Exp4Fuse against leading LLM-based query expansion methods and\nadvanced retrieval techniques on three MS MARCO-related datasets and seven\nlow-resource datasets. Experimental results reveal that Exp4Fuse not only\nsurpasses existing LLM-based query expansion methods in enhancing sparse\nretrievers but also, when combined with advanced sparse retrievers, achieves\nSOTA results on several benchmarks.

The blue loops for lower mass Cepheids cannot always be reproduced\nwhen only classical, local mixing length theory (MLT) is used. Additionally,\nclassical models result in a mass discrepancy compared to pulsational and\ndynamical mass determinations. Both problems can be resolved through an ad-hoc\nextension of the MLT for convection. We use the non-local Kuhfuss turbulent\nconvection model (TCM) which can explain overshooting directly from the\nsolution of the TCM equations. The primary objective of this study is to test\nthe predictions of the Kuhfuss TCM when applied to intermediate-mass core\nHe-burning stars and validate the model predictions against observations of\nCepheids. We used the state-of-the-art 1D stellar evolution code GARSTEC with\nthe implementation of the Kuhfuss TCM and computed evolutionary tracks for\nintermediate-mass core He-burning stars. We compare these tracks with those\ncomputed with MLT including and excluding ad-hoc overshooting and with\nobservations of five Cepheids in detached binary systems obtained from the\nliterature. The stellar evolution tracks generated using the Kuhfuss TCM and\nMLT with ad-hoc overshooting exhibit similar appearances. Overshoot mixing from\nthe convective boundaries and the occurrence of the Cepheid blue-loop have been\nachieved naturally as solutions to the Kuhfuss TCM equations. Furthermore,\nthese models successfully reproduce observed stellar parameters including mass,\nluminosity, radius, and effective temperature. In conclusion, our TCM approach\nreproduces Cepheid blue loops and agrees with observations similarly well as\nMLT models with overshooting, however, without fine-tuning the model parameters\nor ad-hoc assumptions.",

    "abstract": "While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant\nprogress in complex reasoning tasks via reinforcement learning, it is commonly\nbelieved that extensive training data is necessary for improving multi-modal\nreasoning ability, inevitably leading to data redundancy and substantial\ncomputational costs. However, can smaller high-value datasets match or\noutperform full corpora for multi-modal reasoning in MLLMs? In this work, we\nchallenge this assumption through a key observation: meaningful multi-modal\nreasoning is triggered by only a sparse subset of training samples, termed\ncognitive samples, whereas the majority contribute marginally. Building on this\ninsight, we propose a novel data selection paradigm termed Reasoning Activation\nPotential (RAP), which identifies cognitive samples by estimating each sample's\npotential to stimulate genuine multi-modal reasoning by two complementary\nestimators: 1) Causal Discrepancy Estimator (CDE) based on the potential\noutcome model principle, eliminates samples that overly rely on language priors\nby comparing outputs between multi-modal and text-only inputs; 2) Attention\nConfidence Estimator (ACE), which exploits token-level self-attention to\ndiscard samples dominated by irrelevant but over-emphasized tokens in\nintermediate reasoning stages. Moreover, we introduce a Difficulty-aware\nReplacement Module (DRM) to substitute trivial instances with cognitively\nchallenging ones, thereby ensuring complexity for robust multi-modal reasoning.\nExperiments on six datasets show that our RAP method consistently achieves\nsuperior performance using only 9.3% of the training data, while reducing\ncomputational costs by over 43%.

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the conditions necessary for the elimination of\ntransition layers at interfaces involving compound domains, extending the\nclassical framework of cofactor conditions. Although cofactor conditions enable\nstress-free phase boundaries between Type I/II domains and austenite, their\napplicability to compound domains has remained limited. Here, we present a\ncomprehensive theoretical framework to characterize all compatible interfaces,\nhighlighting the fundamental importance of the commutation property among\nmartensitic variants. By establishing necessary and sufficient algebraic\nconditions, referred to as extreme compatibility conditions, we demonstrate the\nsimultaneous elimination of transition layers at phase interfaces for both Type\nI/II and compound laminates, across all volume fractions of the martensitic\nvariants. We also investigate the possibility of achieving supercompatibility\nin non-conventional twins, recently observed in the NiMnGa system. The focus of\nour work is on cubic-to-orthorhombic and cubic-to-monoclinic~II phase\ntransformations, for which the extreme compatibility conditions are explicitly\nderived and systematically analyzed. The theory predicts novel\nzero-elastic-energy microstructures, including an increased number of triple\nclusters, spearhead-shaped martensitic nuclei, stress-free inclusions of\naustenite within martensite, and distinctive four-fold martensitic clusters.\nThis significantly expands the possible modes of forming stress-free interfaces\nbetween phases and reveals new energy-minimizing microstructures that can\nfacilitate the nucleation of martensite within austenite and vice versa. These\nconfigurations highlight significant enhancements in transformation\nreversibility and material durability, guiding the rational design of\nnext-generation shape memory alloys with optimized functional properties.",

    "abstract": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in image\ncaptioning, but recent studies show they are vulnerable to backdoor attacks.\nAttackers can inject imperceptible perturbations-such as local pixel triggers\nor global semantic phrases-into the training data, causing the model to\ngenerate malicious, attacker-controlled captions for specific inputs. These\nattacks are hard to detect and defend due to their stealthiness and cross-modal\nnature. By analyzing attack samples, we identify two key vulnerabilities: (1)\nabnormal attention concentration on specific image regions, and (2) semantic\ndrift and incoherence in generated captions. To counter this, we propose\nSemantic Reward Defense (SRD), a reinforcement learning framework that\nmitigates backdoor behavior without prior knowledge of triggers. SRD uses a\nDeep Q-Network to learn policies for applying discrete perturbations (e.g.,\nocclusion, color masking) to sensitive image regions, aiming to disrupt the\nactivation of malicious pathways. We design a semantic fidelity score as the\nreward signal, which jointly evaluates semantic consistency and linguistic\nfluency of the output, guiding the agent toward generating robust yet faithful\ncaptions. Experiments across mainstream VLMs and datasets show SRD reduces\nattack success rates to 5.6%, while preserving caption quality on clean inputs\nwith less than 10% performance drop. SRD offers a trigger-agnostic,\ninterpretable defense paradigm against stealthy backdoor threats in multimodal\ngenerative models.",

    "abstract": "Neural networks have been used to solve optimal control problems, typically\nby training neural networks using a combined loss function that considers data,\ndifferential equation residuals, and objective costs. We show that including\ncost functions in the training process is unnecessary, advocating for a simpler\narchitecture and streamlined approach by decoupling the optimal control problem\nfrom the training process. Thus, our work shows that a simple neural operator\narchitecture, such as DeepONet, coupled with an unconstrained optimization\nroutine, can solve multiple optimal control problems with a single\nphysics-informed training phase and a subsequent optimization phase. We achieve\nthis by adding a penalty term based on the differential equation residual to\nthe cost function and computing gradients with respect to the control using\nautomatic differentiation through the trained neural operator within an\niterative optimization routine. We showcase our method on nine distinct optimal\ncontrol problems by training three separate DeepONet models, each corresponding\nto a different differential equation.

    "abstract": "We introduce the time glass, a non-periodic analogue of the discrete time\ncrystal that arises in periodically driven dissipative quantum many-body\nsystems. This phase is defined by two key features: (i) spatial long-range\norder arising from the spontaneous breaking of an internal symmetry, and (ii)\ntemporally chaotic oscillations of the order parameter, whose lifetime diverges\nwith system size. In other words, a time glass is a state of matter in which\nall components evolve in a synchronized yet chaotic manner. To characterize the\ntime glass phase, we focus on the spectral gap of the one-cycle (Floquet)\nLiouvillian, which determines the decay rate of the slowest relaxation mode.\nNumerical studies of periodically driven dissipative Ising models show that, in\nthe time glass phase, the Liouvillian gap remains finite in the thermodynamic\nlimit, in contrast to time crystals where the gap closes exponentially with\nsystem size. We further demonstrate that the Liouvillian gap converges to the\ndecay rate of the order-parameter autocorrelation derived from the classical\n(mean-field) dynamics in the thermodynamic limit. This result establishes a\ndirect correspondence between microscopic spectral features and emergent\nmacroscopic dynamics in driven dissipative quantum systems. At first glance,\nthe existence of a nonzero Liouvillian gap appears incompatible with the\npresence of indefinitely persistent chaotic oscillations. We resolve this\napparent paradox by showing that the quantum R\\'enyi divergence between a\nlocalized coherent initial state and the highly delocalized steady state grows\nunboundedly with system size. This divergence allows long-lived transients to\npersist even in the presence of a finite Liouvillian gap.",

To second order, we calculate the relativistic time delay from the\nnull geodesic equation (particle perspective), while the phase shift and the\nassociated effective time delay are derived from the Klein-Gordon equation\n(wave perspective). Since gravity influences both the temporal and spatial\nparts of the phase shift, these two time delays differ and lead to different\ncoincidence probabilities. The previous HOM experiment conducted on a rotating\nplatform suggests that the wave perspective can explain the experimental\nresults. We further explore the frame dragging and redshift effects in an\narbitrarily oriented rectangular interferometer under two distinct scenarios\nwith different photon paths, measuring one effect in each scenario. We find\nthat both effects can be amplified by increasing the number of light loops.\nAdditionally, we emphasize that the next-to-leading order Sagnac effect,\narising from gravitational acceleration, is comparable to the Thomas\nprecession, the geodetic effect, and the Lense-Thirring effect. To detect the\nleading order Sagnac effect and the redshift effect caused by gravitational\nacceleration, we estimate the number of loops that photons should travel in the\ninterferometer.

In this work, we solve\nDeo's transcendental mode-condition equation (Eq. 2.15 from Deo, 2021\n[Deo2021]) numerically -- using Python's NumPy and SciPy libraries -- for\nring-stub geometries with $v/u = 0.200, 0.205,$ and $0.210$ to generate\ndispersion relations ($ku$ vs. $\\Phi/\\Phi_{0}$) and the underlying function\n$\\text{Re}(1/T)$.

To address this gap, we\nintroduce a fine-grained analytic framework to dissect the impact of RL on\nreasoning. Our framework specifically investigates key elements that have been\nhypothesized to benefit from RL training: (1) plan-following and execution, (2)\nproblem decomposition, and (3) improved reasoning and knowledge utilization.\nUsing this framework, we gain insights beyond mere accuracy. For instance,\nproviding models with explicit step-by-step plans surprisingly degrades\nperformance on the most challenging benchmarks, yet RL-tuned models exhibit\ngreater robustness, experiencing markedly smaller performance drops than their\nbase counterparts. This suggests that RL may not primarily enhance the\nexecution of external plans but rather empower models to formulate and follow\ninternal strategies better suited to their reasoning processes. Conversely, we\nobserve that RL enhances the model's capacity to integrate provided knowledge\ninto its reasoning process, leading to performance improvements across diverse\ntasks. We also study difficulty, showing improved training by developing new\nways to exploit hard problems. Our findings lay a foundation for more\nprincipled training and evaluation of reasoning models.",

For each iteration, one instruction\nand two models are selected for a duel, the other models evaluate the two\nresponses, and their evaluation scores are aggregated through a adapted\nelo-ranking based reputation system, where winners/losers of combat gain/lose\nweight in evaluating others. The peer-evaluated combat results then become\npreference pairs where the winning response is preferred over the losing one,\nand all models learn from these preferences at the end of each iteration.\nSPARTA ALIGNMENT enables the self-evolution of multiple LLMs in an iterative\nand collective competition process.

Predicting dissection trajectories in ESD videos\noffers significant potential for enhancing surgical skill training and\nsimplifying the learning process, yet this area remains underexplored. While\nimitation learning has shown promise in acquiring skills from expert\ndemonstrations, challenges persist in handling uncertain future movements,\nlearning geometric symmetries, and generalizing to diverse surgical scenarios.\nTo address these, we introduce a novel approach: Implicit Diffusion Policy with\nEquivariant Representations for Imitation Learning (iDPOE). Our method models\nexpert behavior through a joint state action distribution, capturing the\nstochastic nature of dissection trajectories and enabling robust visual\nrepresentation learning across various endoscopic views. By incorporating a\ndiffusion model into policy learning, iDPOE ensures efficient training and\nsampling, leading to more accurate predictions and better generalization.\nAdditionally, we enhance the model's ability to generalize to geometric\nsymmetries by embedding equivariance into the learning process. To address\nstate mismatches, we develop a forward-process guided action inference strategy\nfor conditional sampling. Using an ESD video dataset of nearly 2000 clips,\nexperimental results show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods,\nboth explicit and implicit, in trajectory prediction. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first application of imitation learning to surgical\nskill development for dissection trajectory prediction.",

Therefore, an effective automatic visual\nquality assessment is of great importance for AIGV content regulation and\ngenerative model improvement. In this work, we decompose the visual quality of\nAIGVs into three dimensions: technical quality, motion quality, and video\nsemantics. For each dimension, we design corresponding encoder to achieve\neffective feature representation. Moreover, considering the outstanding\nperformance of large language models (LLMs) in various vision and language\ntasks, we introduce a LLM as the quality regression module.

As the adapted models inevitably encounter\nout-of-distribution (OOD) test data that deviates from the in-distribution (ID)\ntask-specific training data, enhancing OOD generalization in few-shot\nadaptation is critically important. We study robust few-shot VLM adaptation,\naiming to increase both ID and OOD accuracy. By comparing different adaptation\nmethods (e.g., prompt tuning, linear probing, contrastive finetuning, and full\nfinetuning), we uncover three key findings: (1) finetuning with proper\nhyperparameters significantly outperforms the popular VLM adaptation methods\nprompt tuning and linear probing; (2) visual encoder-only finetuning achieves\nbetter efficiency and accuracy than contrastively finetuning both visual and\ntextual encoders; (3) finetuning the top layers of the visual encoder provides\nthe best balance between ID and OOD accuracy. Building on these findings, we\npropose partial finetuning of the visual encoder empowered with two simple\naugmentation techniques: (1) retrieval augmentation which retrieves\ntask-relevant data from the VLM's pretraining dataset to enhance adaptation,\nand (2) adversarial perturbation which promotes robustness during finetuning.\nResults show that the former/latter boosts OOD/ID accuracy while slightly\nsacrificing the ID/OOD accuracy. Yet, perhaps understandably, naively combining\nthe two does not maintain their best OOD/ID accuracy. We address this dilemma\nwith the developed SRAPF, Stage-wise Retrieval Augmentation-based Adversarial\nPartial Finetuning. SRAPF consists of two stages: (1) partial finetuning the\nvisual encoder using both ID and retrieved data, and (2) adversarial partial\nfinetuning with few-shot ID data.

    "abstract": "The space-time geometry under investigation is chosen to be a\nhigh-dimensional, static, spherically symmetric solution in an asymptotically\nflat background within the Einstein-power-Yang-Mills-Gauss-Bonnet (EPYMGB)\ngravity. To address the limitations of previous shadow constraints, we\nconstruct a standardized framework based on the Schwarzschild-Tangherlini\nmetric to constrain the characteristic parameters of high-dimensional black\nholes by leveraging observational shadow data. Additionally, we provide a\nrigorous derivation of the shadow radius formula for a general high-dimensional\nspherically symmetric black hole. Subsequently, we systematically and\ncomprehensively present the equations of motion and master variables governing\nspin-0, spin-1, $p$-form, and spin-2 perturbations in high-dimensional static\nspherically symmetric flat space-time. Our analysis reveals that the Yang-Mills\nmagnetic charge $\\mathcal{Q}$ and the power $q$ have a negligible impact on\nboth the shadow radius and perturbations of the black hole when compared to the\nGauss-Bonnet coupling constant ${\\alpha}_2$ in various dimensions. Hence, the\nphysical signatures of the parameters $\\mathcal{Q}$ and $q$ in the black hole\nenvironment remain undetectable through either perturbation analysis or shadow\nobservations. Cross-validation of the allowable range of ${\\alpha}_2$ derived\nfrom the high-dimensional constraint on shadow radius and the dynamical\nstability analysis of gravitational perturbations demonstrates excellent\nagreement between these independent approaches. The conclusion of this\ncross-analysis further substantiate the accuracy of the high-dimensional shadow\nconstraint formula proposed in this work, and we argue that this formula may\nserve as a universal tool for constraining the characteristic parameters of\nother high-dimensional spherically symmetric black hole solutions.",

    "abstract": "We study single cell E.coli chemotaxis in a spatio-temporally varying\nattractant environment. Modeling the attractant concentration in the form of a\ntraveling sine wave, we measure in our simulations, the chemotactic drift\nvelocity of the cell for different propagation speed of the attractant wave. We\nfind a highly non-trivial dependence where the chemotactic drift velocity\nchanges sign, and also shows multiple peaks. For slowly moving attractant wave,\ndrift velocity is negative, i.e. the drift motion is directed opposite to wave\npropagation. As the wave speed increases, drift velocity shows a negative peak,\nthen changes sign, reaches a positive peak and finally becomes zero when the\nwave moves too fast for the cell to respond. We explain this rich behavior from\nthe difference in attractant gradient perceived by the cell during its run\nalong the propagation direction and opposite to it. In particular, when the\ncell moves in the same direction as the wave, the relative velocity of the cell\nwith respect to the wave becomes zero when the wave speed matches the run\nspeed. In this limit, the cell is able to ride the wave and experiences no\nconcentration gradient during these runs. On the contrary, for runs in the\nopposite direction, no such effect is present and the effective gradient\nincreases monotonically with the wave speed. We show, using detailed\nquantitative measurements, how this difference gives rise to the\ncounter-intuitive behavior of chemotactic drift velocity described above.",

In this work, we introduce dual-ISL, a novel\nlikelihood-free objective for training implicit generative models that\ninterchanges the roles of the target and model distributions in the ISL\nframework, yielding a convex optimization problem in the space of model\ndensities. We prove that the resulting rank-based discrepancy $d_K$ is i)\ncontinuous under weak convergence and with respect to the $L^1$ norm, and ii)\nconvex in its first argument-properties not shared by classical divergences\nsuch as KL or Wasserstein distances. Building on this, we develop a theoretical\nframework that interprets $d_K$ as an $L^2$-projection of the density ratio $q\n= p/\\tilde p$ onto a Bernstein polynomial basis, from which we derive exact\nbounds on the truncation error, precise convergence rates, and a closed-form\nexpression for the truncated density approximation. We further extend our\nanalysis to the multivariate setting via random one-dimensional projections,\ndefining a sliced dual-ISL divergence that retains both convexity and\ncontinuity. We empirically show that these theoretical advantages translate\ninto practical ones.

Consequently, here, an automated design method for the\ncontroller of soft actuators based on Neuroevolution is proposed.

Moreover, the use of an affluent and a more limited\nset of activation functions for the Neuroevolution targets was tested\nthroughout the experiments. The results support the hypothesis that\nNeuroevolution based methodologies are more appropriate for designing\ncontrollers that align with both types of morphologies.

However, this pool of natural data does not grow at the\nsame rate as the compute supply. Furthermore, the availability of high-quality\ntexts is even more limited: data filtering pipelines often remove up to 99% of\nthe initial web scrapes to achieve state-of-the-art. To address the \"data wall\"\nof pre-training scaling, our work explores ways to transform and recycle data\ndiscarded in existing filtering processes.

Hence, we focus on the joint optimization of the\nlocation of charging stations and the routing of EVs. When routing problems are\nformulated in the form of quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO),\nspecialized solvers such as quantum annealer are expected to provide optimal\nsolutions with high speed and accuracy. However, battery capacity constraints\nmake it hard to formulate into QUBO form without a large number of auxiliary\nqubits. Then, we propose a sequential optimization method utilizing the\nBayesian inference and QUBO solvers, in which method the battery capacity\nconstraints are automatically learned. This method enables us to optimize the\nnumber and location of charging stations and the routing of EVs with a small\nnumber of searches. Applying this method to a routing problem of 20 locations,\nwe confirmed that the learning process works well and efficient searches find\ngood solutions. This result enhances the possibility that the QUBO solver could\nbe applied to the constraints contained problems which is difficult to\nformulate into QUBO form without a large number of ancilla qubits.",

To\nachieve optimal performance, we formulate an optimization problem relying on\nsum spectral efficiency (SE) maximization of the communication users (CUs),\nwhile satisfying certain radar beampattern similarity (RBPS), total transmit\npower, and constant modulus constraints, where the latter are attributed to the\nhybrid mmWave MIMO architecture.

However, direct human testing poses risks due to possible\nexoskeleton malfunctions and inconsistent movement replication. To provide a\nsafer and more repeatable testing environment, this study employs a bipedal\nrobot platform to reproduce human gait, allowing for controlled exoskeleton\nevaluations. A control strategy based on the State-Dependent Riccati Equation\n(SDRE) is formulated to achieve optimal torque control for accurate gait\nreplication. The bipedal robot dynamics are represented using double pendulum\nmodel, where SDRE-optimized control inputs minimize deviations from human\nmotion trajectories. To align with motor behavior constraints, a parameterized\ncontrol method is introduced to simplify the control process while effectively\nreplicating human gait. The proposed approach initially adopts a ramping\ntrapezoidal velocity model, which is then adapted into a piecewise linear\nvelocity-time representation through motor command overwriting. This\nmodification enables finer control over gait phase transitions while ensuring\ncompatibility with motor dynamics. The corresponding cost function optimizes\nthe control parameters to minimize errors in joint angles, velocities, and\ntorques relative to SDRE control result. By structuring velocity transitions in\naccordance with motor limitations, the method reduce the computational load\nassociated with real-time control.

Extensive experiments on 30 representative activity cliff\ndatasets demonstrate that MTPNet significantly outperforms previous approaches,\nachieving an average RMSE improvement of 18.95% on top of several mainstream\nGNN architectures. Overall, MTPNet internalizes interaction patterns through\nconditional deep learning to achieve unified predictions of activity cliffs,\nhelping to accelerate compound optimization and design.

Specifically, our approach leverages a Mixture of\nLoRA Experts (MoLE) for parameter-efficient adaptation, ensuring a balanced\nallocation of trainable parameters between the backbone and the PCL\nmodule.Meanwhile, cross-module concept guidance enforces tight alignment\nbetween the backbone's feature representations and the prototypical concept\nactivation patterns.In addition, we incorporate a multi-level feature\npreservation strategy that fuses spatial and semantic cues across various\nlayers, thereby enriching the learned representations and mitigating the\nchallenges posed by limited data availability.Finally, to enhance\ninterpretability and minimize concept overlap, we introduce a geometry-aware\nconcept discrimination loss that enforces orthogonality among concepts,\nencouraging more disentangled and transparent decision boundaries.Experimental\nresults on six popular benchmarks (CUB-200-2011, mini-ImageNet, CIFAR-FS,\nStanford Cars, FGVC-Aircraft, and DTD) demonstrate that our approach\nconsistently outperforms existing SEMs by a notable margin, with 4.2%-8.7%\nrelative gains in 5-way 5-shot classification.These findings highlight the\nefficacy of coupling concept learning with few-shot adaptation to achieve both\nhigher accuracy and clearer model interpretability, paving the way for more\ntransparent visual recognition systems.",

Personalizing certain\nparts of the model can effectively address these issues by allowing those parts\nto differ across clients, while the remaining parts serve as a shared model.\nHowever, we found that partial model personalization may exacerbate client\ndrift (each client's local model diverges from the shared model), thereby\nreducing the effectiveness and efficiency of FL algorithms. We propose an FL\nframework based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM),\nreferred to as FedAPM, to mitigate client drift. We construct the augmented\nLagrangian function by incorporating first-order and second-order proximal\nterms into the objective, with the second-order term providing fixed correction\nand the first-order term offering compensatory correction between the local and\nshared models. Our analysis demonstrates that FedAPM, by using explicit\nestimates of the Lagrange multiplier, is more stable and efficient in terms of\nconvergence compared to other FL frameworks. We establish the global\nconvergence of FedAPM training from arbitrary initial points to a stationary\npoint, achieving three types of rates: constant, linear, and sublinear, under\nmild assumptions. We conduct experiments using four heterogeneous and\nmultimodal datasets with different metrics to validate the performance of\nFedAPM.

Existing PML methods\naddressing this problem are mainly based on the low-rank assumption.

Furthermore, we find that\nexisting methods have poor ability to identify positive labels, which is\nimportant in real-world scenarios.

Various\nneural network (NN) models have been proposed that acquire empirically good\nrepresentations. However, the formulation of a good representation has not been\nestablished. We recently proposed a method for categorizing changes between a\npair of sensory inputs. A unique feature of this approach is that\ntransformations between two sensory inputs are learned to satisfy algebraic\nstructural constraints. Conventional representation learning often assumes that\ndisentangled independent feature axes is a good representation; however, we\nfound that such a representation cannot account for conditional independence.\nTo overcome this problem, we proposed a new method using group decomposition in\nGalois algebra theory. Although this method is promising for defining a more\ngeneral representation, it assumes pixel-to-pixel translation without feature\nextraction, and can only process low-resolution images with no background,\nwhich prevents real-world application. In this study, we provide a simple\nmethod to apply our group decomposition theory to a more realistic scenario by\ncombining feature extraction and object segmentation. We replace pixel\ntranslation with feature translation and formulate object segmentation as\ngrouping features under the same transformation.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a fast and unsupervised scheme for the polygonal\napproximation of a closed digital curve. It is demonstrated that the\napproximation scheme is faster than state-of-the-art approximation and is\ncompetitive with Rosin's measure and aesthetic aspects. The scheme comprises of\nthree phases: initial segmentation, iterative vertex insertion, iterative\nmerging, and vertex adjustment. The initial segmentation is used to detect\nsharp turns, that is, vertices that seemingly have high curvature. It is likely\nthat some of the important vertices with low curvature might have been missed\nin the first phase; therefore, iterative vertex insertion is used to add\nvertices in a region where the curvature changes slowly but steadily. The\ninitial phase may pick up some undesirable vertices, and thus merging is used\nto eliminate redundant vertices. Finally, vertex adjustment was used to enhance\nthe aesthetic appearance of the approximation. The quality of the\napproximations was measured using the Rosin's method. The robustness of the\nproposed scheme with respect to geometric transformation was observed.",

    "abstract": "Various methods have been explored to prepare the spin-adapted ground state,\nthe lowest energy state within the Hilbert space constrained by externally\nspecified values of the total spin magnitude and the spin-$z$ component. In\nsuch problem settings, variational and non-variational methods commonly\nincorporate penalty terms into the original Hamiltonian to enforce the desired\nconstraints. While in variational approaches, only $O(n_{\\textrm{spin}}^2)$\nmeasurements are required for the calculation of the penalty terms for the\ntotal spin magnitude, non-variational approaches, such as probabilistic\nimaginary-time evolution or adiabatic time evolution, are expected to be more\ncomputationally intensive, requiring $O(n_{\\textrm{spin}}^4)$ gates naively.\nThis paper proposes a new procedure based on non-variational quantum algorithms\nto obtain the spin-adapted ground state. The proposed method consists of two\nsteps: the first step is to prepare a spin-magnitude adapted state and the\nsecond step is post-processing for the desired $S_z$. By separating into two\nsteps, the procedure achieves the desired spin-adapted ground state while\nreducing the number of penalty terms from $O(n_{\\textrm{spin}}^4)$ to\n$O(n_{\\textrm{spin}}^2)$. We conducted numerical experiments for spin-1/2\nHeisenberg ring models and manganese trimer systems. The results confirmed the\neffectiveness of our method, demonstrating a significant reduction in gate\ncomplexity and validating its practical usefulness.",

Real-world\ncomplex application scenarios place the demanding requirements on machine\nlearning models to consider all three modalities together.

We stacked images from multiple\nepochs to better recover the crosssection of the jet. By analyzing the\nrelationship between jet width and distance, we observed that the jet exhibits\na parabolic shape from the core, spanning a region from 0.12 to 6.1 mas. This\nstructure suggests the acceleration and collimation processes of the jet.\nBeyond 18 mas from the core, the jet adopts a conical shape, and the expansion\nspeed of the jet becomes faster within the range from 4500 to 6500 mas. We\nobtained the core shift of this source using five pairs of data from VLBA at\n1.6 GHz to 43 GHz. Based on previous studies, through proper motion analysis of\nthe jet components, we estimated the angle between the jet and the line of\nsight to be approximately 65.7{\\deg}, so 1 mas corresponds to 0.95 pc\n(de-projected distance). We then obtained the velocity field of the source\nwithin 3.14 mas from the central black hole and found that the jet exhibits\naccelerated motion within this range. At approximately 6.1 mas from the core,\nwe observed that the jet width begins to decrease, which we identified as\npossibly corresponding to the Bondi radius of this source. The reduction in jet\nwidth may be related to changes in the external environmental pressure,\nparticularly within the Bondi radius, indicating that the jet dynamics and\ncollimation characteristics are strongly influenced by the surrounding medium\nconditions.",

Existing\ndefense mechanisms often face critical trade-offs between effectiveness and\ngeneralizability. This highlights the urgent need for efficient prompt\ninjection detection methods that are applicable across a wide range of LLMs. To\naddress this challenge, we propose DMPI-PMHFE, a dual-channel feature fusion\ndetection framework. It integrates a pretrained language model with heuristic\nfeature engineering to detect prompt injection attacks.

In parallel,\nwe design heuristic rules based on known attack patterns to extract explicit\nstructural features commonly observed in attacks. Features from both channels\nare subsequently fused and passed through a fully connected neural network to\nproduce the final prediction. This dual-channel approach mitigates the\nlimitations of relying only on DeBERTa to extract features. Experimental\nresults on diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that DMPI-PMHFE outperforms\nexisting methods in terms of accuracy, recall, and F1-score.

In this paper, we investigate whether LLM agents\ncan self-improve when placed in environments that explicitly challenge their\nstrategic planning abilities. Using the board game Settlers of Catan, accessed\nthrough the open-source Catanatron framework, we benchmark a progression of\nLLM-based agents, from a simple game-playing agent to systems capable of\nautonomously rewriting their own prompts and their player agent's code. We\nintroduce a multi-agent architecture in which specialized roles (Analyzer,\nResearcher, Coder, and Player) collaborate to iteratively analyze gameplay,\nresearch new strategies, and modify the agent's logic or prompt. By comparing\nmanually crafted agents to those evolved entirely by LLMs, we evaluate how\neffectively these systems can diagnose failure and adapt over time. Our results\nshow that self-evolving agents, particularly when powered by models like Claude\n3.7 and GPT-4o, outperform static baselines by autonomously adopting their\nstrategies, passing along sample behavior to game-playing agents, and\ndemonstrating adaptive reasoning over multiple iterations.",

We focus on a specific aspect of the\nlegal landscape by introducing a corporate governance reasoning benchmark\n(CHANCERY) to test a model's ability to reason about whether\nexecutive/board/shareholder's proposed actions are consistent with corporate\ngovernance charters. This benchmark introduces a first-of-its-kind corporate\ngovernance reasoning test for language models - modeled after real world\ncorporate governance law. The benchmark consists of a corporate charter (a set\nof governing covenants) and a proposal for executive action. The model's task\nis one of binary classification: reason about whether the action is consistent\nwith the rules contained within the charter. We create the benchmark following\nestablished principles of corporate governance - 24 concrete corporate\ngovernance principles established in and 79 real life corporate charters\nselected to represent diverse industries from a total dataset of 10k real life\ncorporate charters. Evaluations on state-of-the-art (SOTA) reasoning models\nconfirm the difficulty of the benchmark, with models such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet\nand GPT-4o achieving 64.5% and 75.2% accuracy respectively. Reasoning agents\nexhibit superior performance, with agents based on the ReAct and CodeAct\nframeworks scoring 76.1% and 78.1% respectively, further confirming the\nadvanced legal reasoning capabilities required to score highly on the\nbenchmark. We also conduct an analysis of the types of questions which current\nreasoning models struggle on, revealing insights into the legal reasoning\ncapabilities of SOTA models.",

The resulting spin\nprecession dynamics induced by the gauge potential are analyzed with and\nwithout the adiabatic approximation. Under this approximation, the surface\ntopology is linked to the rotation angle of spin orientation along a surface\nboundary and to the pseudo-magnetic flux.

The curve's topology ensures closure of the spin direction and\nindependence of the spin from the path direction.

We formalize an agentic workflow as a directed\nacyclic graph, called an agent graph, where edges represent AI agents and paths\ncorrespond to feasible compositions of agents. When deploying these systems in\nthe real world, we need to choose compositions of agents that not only maximize\nthe task success, but also minimize risk where the risk captures requirements\nlike safety, fairness, and privacy. This additionally requires carefully\nanalyzing the low-probability (tail) behaviors of compositions of agents. In\nthis work, we consider worst-case risk minimization over the set of feasible\nagent compositions. We define worst-case risk as the tail quantile -- also\nknown as value-at-risk -- of the loss distribution of the agent composition\nwhere the loss quantifies the risk associated with agent behaviors. We\nintroduce an efficient algorithm that traverses the agent graph and finds a\nnear-optimal composition of agents by approximating the value-at-risk via a\nunion bound and dynamic programming. Furthermore, we prove that the\napproximation is near-optimal asymptotically for a broad class of practical\nloss functions.

Finally, we obtain Tool-MVR by finetuning open-source LLMs (e.g.,\nQwen-7B) on both ToolBench-V and ToolBench-R. Our experiments demonstrate that\nTool-MVR achieves state-of-the-art performance on StableToolBench, surpassing\nboth ToolLLM (by 23.9%) and GPT-4 (by 15.3%) while reducing API calls by 31.4%,\nwith strong generalization capabilities across unseen tools and scenarios.\nAdditionally, on our proposed RefineToolBench, the first benchmark specifically\ndesigned to evaluate tool reflection capabilities, Tool-MVR achieves a 58.9%\nerror correction rate, significantly outperforming ToolLLM's 9.1%.",

    "abstract": "3D semantic occupancy prediction aims to reconstruct the 3D geometry and\nsemantics of the surrounding environment. With dense voxel labels, prior works\ntypically formulate it as a dense segmentation task, independently classifying\neach voxel. However, this paradigm neglects critical instance-centric\ndiscriminability, leading to instance-level incompleteness and adjacent\nambiguities. To address this, we highlight a free lunch of occupancy labels:\nthe voxel-level class label implicitly provides insight at the instance level,\nwhich is overlooked by the community. Motivated by this observation, we first\nintroduce a training-free Voxel-to-Instance (VoxNT) trick: a simple yet\neffective method that freely converts voxel-level class labels into\ninstance-level offset labels. Building on this, we further propose VoxDet, an\ninstance-centric framework that reformulates the voxel-level occupancy\nprediction as dense object detection by decoupling it into two sub-tasks:\noffset regression and semantic prediction. Specifically, based on the lifted 3D\nvolume, VoxDet first uses (a) Spatially-decoupled Voxel Encoder to generate\ndisentangled feature volumes for the two sub-tasks, which learn task-specific\nspatial deformation in the densely projected tri-perceptive space. Then, we\ndeploy (b) Task-decoupled Dense Predictor to address this task via dense\ndetection. Here, we first regress a 4D offset field to estimate distances (6\ndirections) between voxels and object borders in the voxel space. The regressed\noffsets are then used to guide the instance-level aggregation in the\nclassification branch, achieving instance-aware prediction. Experiments show\nthat VoxDet can be deployed on both camera and LiDAR input, jointly achieving\nstate-of-the-art results on both benchmarks. VoxDet is not only highly\nefficient, but also achieves 63.0 IoU on the SemanticKITTI test set, ranking\n1st on the online leaderboard.",

One such enhancement is an exotic\nbaryon $\\Lambda(1405)$ which was first observed in 1973. Despite the few\navailable experimental data, the statistics of the measurements of\n$\\Lambda(1405)$ have improved for line shape analysis.

This survey adopts a unique perspective by\ncomprehensively reviewing how deep learning has incrementally transformed the\nclassical image matching pipeline.

Experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks\nshow that ADAPT reaches 80% accuracy using eight times less compute than strong\nbaselines. Our findings highlight the essential role of generative diversity in\nmaximizing TTS effectiveness.",

In contrast, SmartAvatar leverages the\ncommonsense reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (VLMs) in\ncombination with off-the-shelf parametric human generators to deliver\nhigh-quality, customizable avatars. A key innovation is an autonomous\nverification loop, where the agent renders draft avatars, evaluates facial\nsimilarity, anatomical plausibility, and prompt alignment, and iteratively\nadjusts generation parameters for convergence. This interactive, AI-guided\nrefinement process promotes fine-grained control over both facial and body\nfeatures, enabling users to iteratively refine their avatars via\nnatural-language conversations. Unlike diffusion models that rely on static\npre-trained datasets and offer limited flexibility, SmartAvatar brings users\ninto the modeling loop and ensures continuous improvement through an LLM-driven\nprocedural generation and verification system. The generated avatars are fully\nrigged and support pose manipulation with consistent identity and appearance,\nmaking them suitable for downstream animation and interactive applications.\nQuantitative benchmarks and user studies demonstrate that SmartAvatar\noutperforms recent text- and image-driven avatar generation systems in terms of\nreconstructed mesh quality, identity fidelity, attribute accuracy, and\nanimation readiness, making it a versatile tool for realistic, customizable\navatar creation on consumer-grade hardware.",

Here, we report the\nobservation of nonreciprocal superconducting critical currents (Ic) at zero\napplied magnetic field: Ic exhibits different values in opposite directions, in\nboth flakes and micro-bridges of the kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5. Such\nspontaneous nonreciprocity requires TRS and inversion symmetry breakings. We\nfind that the direction of asymmetry changes randomly in repeated sample\nheating to 300 K and cooling into the zero-resistance state, consistent with\nthe expected behavior arising from spontaneous TRS breaking. Crucially, on\napplying a perpendicular magnetic field at 300 K, above the charge density wave\n(CDW) transition at TCDW in this compound and removing it to zero well above\nthe superconducting onset critical temperature (Tc), the direction of the Ic\nasymmetry consistently flips on changing the direction of the field. This\nmagnetic field training ascertains that the CDW state above the superconducting\ntransition temperature may also break the Z2 TRS and has a macroscopic\ndirectionality which can be changed by a uniform training field. The symmetry\nbreaking continues into the superconducting state and gives rise to the\nnonreciprocal superconducting critical currents. These results indicate the\nloop-current CDW normal state with topological features in CsV3Sb5. Our\nobservations provide direct evidence for the TRS breaking in kagome\nsuperconductor CsV3Sb5, and offer new insights into the mechanism of TRS\nbreaking in kagome superconductors.",

For the first time, full scaling laws based on\ndense measurements across a wide span of model and samples seen scales are\nderived for two important language-vision learning procedures, CLIP and MaMMUT,\nthat use either contrastive only or contrastive and captioning text generative\nloss. Ensuring sufficient prediction accuracy for held out points, we use\nderived scaling laws to compare both models, obtaining evidence for MaMMUT's\nstronger improvement with scale and better sample efficiency than standard\nCLIP. To strengthen validity of the comparison, we show scaling laws for\nvarious downstream tasks, classification, retrieval, and segmentation, and for\ndifferent open datasets, DataComp, DFN and Re-LAION, observing consistently the\nsame trends. We show that comparison can also be performed when deriving\nscaling laws with a constant learning rate schedule, reducing compute cost.\nAccurate derivation of scaling laws provides thus means to perform model and\ndataset comparison across scale spans, avoiding misleading conclusions based on\nmeasurements from single reference scales only, paving the road for systematic\ncomparison and improvement of open foundation models and datasets for their\ncreation.

    "abstract": "WiFi networks have achieved remarkable success in enabling seamless\ncommunication and data exchange worldwide. The IEEE 802.11be standard, known as\nWiFi 7, introduces Multi-Link Operation (MLO), a groundbreaking feature that\nenables devices to establish multiple simultaneous connections across different\nbands and channels. While MLO promises substantial improvements in network\nthroughput and latency reduction, it presents significant challenges in channel\nallocation, particularly in dense network environments. Current research has\npredominantly focused on performance analysis and throughput optimization\nwithin static WiFi 7 network configurations. In contrast, this paper addresses\nthe dynamic channel allocation problem in dense WiFi 7 networks with MLO\ncapabilities. We formulate this challenge as a combinatorial optimization\nproblem, leveraging a novel network performance analysis mechanism. Given the\ninherent lack of prior network information, we model the problem within a\nMulti-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework to enable online learning of optimal channel\nallocations. Our proposed Best-Arm Identification-enabled Monte Carlo Tree\nSearch (BAI-MCTS) algorithm includes rigorous theoretical analysis, providing\nupper bounds for both sample complexity and error probability. To further\nreduce sample complexity and enhance generalizability across diverse network\nscenarios, we put forth LLM-BAI-MCTS, an intelligent algorithm for the dynamic\nchannel allocation problem by integrating the Large Language Model (LLM) into\nthe BAI-MCTS algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate that the BAI-MCTS\nalgorithm achieves a convergence rate approximately $50.44\\%$ faster than the\nstate-of-the-art algorithms when reaching $98\\%$ of the optimal value. Notably,\nthe convergence rate of the LLM-BAI-MCTS algorithm increases by over $63.32\\%$\nin dense networks.",

By leveraging a powerful video inpainting foundation model as a\ngenerative prior, we reformulate 4D video creation as a video inpainting task,\nenabling the model to fill in missing content caused by camera trajectory\nchanges or user edits. To facilitate this, we generate composite masked\ninpainting video data to effectively fine-tune the model for 4D video\ngeneration. Given an input video and its associated camera trajectory, we first\nperform depth-based point cloud rendering to obtain invisibility masks that\nindicate the regions that should be completed. Simultaneously, editing masks\nare introduced to specify user-defined modifications, and these are combined\nwith the invisibility masks to create a composite masks dataset. During\ntraining, we randomly sample different types of masks to construct diverse and\nchallenging inpainting scenarios, enhancing the model's generalization and\nrobustness in various 4D editing and generation tasks. To handle temporal\nconsistency under large camera motion, we design a self-iterative tuning\nstrategy that gradually increases the viewing angles during training, where the\nmodel is used to generate the next-stage training data after each fine-tuning\niteration. Moreover, we introduce a temporal packaging module during inference\nto enhance generation quality. Our method effectively leverages the prior\nknowledge of the base model without degrading its original performance,\nenabling the generation of 4D videos with consistent multi-view coherence.

    "abstract": "Solving bilevel optimization (BLO) problems to global optimality is generally\nintractable. A common alternative is to compute a hyper-stationary point -- a\nstationary point of the hyper-objective function formed by\nminimizing/maximizing the upper-level function over the lower-level solution\nset. However, existing approaches either yield weak notions of stationarity or\nrely on restrictive assumptions to ensure the smoothness of hyper-objective\nfunctions. In this paper, we remove these impractical assumptions and show that\nstrong (Clarke) hyper-stationarity is still computable even when the\nhyper-objective is nonsmooth. Our key tool is a new structural condition,\ncalled set smoothness, which captures the variational relationship between the\nlower-level solution set and the upper-level variable. We prove that this\ncondition holds for a broad class of BLO problems and ensures weak convexity\n(resp. concavity) of pessimistic (resp. optimistic) hyper-objective functions.\nBuilding on this, we show that a zeroth-order algorithm computes approximate\nClarke hyper-stationary points with a non-asymptotic convergence guarantee. To\nthe best of our knowledge, this is the first computational guarantee for\nClarke-type stationarity for nonsmooth hyper-objective functions in BLO.Our\ndevelopments, especially the set smoothness property, contribute to a deeper\nunderstanding of BLO computability and may inspire applications in other\nfields.",

Notable GW events observed\nby LIGO are discussed alongside persistent analytical challenges such as data\nquality, generalization, and computational constraints. A comprehensive\nperformance review of AI techniques, including supervised learning,\nunsupervised learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning, is presented\nbased on data spanning 2021 to 2024.

Less costly than physical experiments,\ncomputer experiments sometimes involve large number of trials. Conventional\ndesign optimization and model fitting methods for computer experiments are\ninefficient for large-scale problems. In this paper, we propose new methods to\noptimize good lattice point sets, using less computation to construct designs\nwith enhanced space-filling properties such as high separation distance, low\ndiscrepancy, and high separation distance on projections. These designs show\npromising performance in uncertainty quantification as well as physics-informed\nneural networks. We also propose a new type of space-filling design called\nregularly repeated lattice-based Latin hypercube designs, which contain lots of\nlocal space-filling Latin hypercube designs as subdesigns. Such designs\nfacilitate rapid fitting of multiple local Gaussian process models in a moving\nwindow type of modeling approach and thus are useful for large-scale emulation\nproblems.",

Despite their success, we find that LLMs, as translators,\nstruggle to handle lexical diversification, a common linguistic phenomenon,\nindicating that LLMs as logic translators are unreliable in real-world\nscenarios. Moreover, existing logical reasoning benchmarks lack lexical\ndiversity, failing to challenge LLMs' ability to translate such text and thus\nobscuring this issue.

High-order asymptotic methods,\nsuch as the Cornish-Fisher expansion, have become popular for balancing\ncomputational efficiency with improved accuracy when data are limited, but\nfrequently encounter the \"bend-back\" problem in high-reliability scenarios and\nrequire complex analytical computations. To overcome these limitations, we\npropose a novel method for SRA by modifying the double bootstrap framework,\ntermed the double bootstrap percentile with transformed resamples.

    "abstract": "Despite a strong desire to quit, individuals with long-term substance use\ndisorder (SUD) often struggle to resist drug use, even when aware of its\nharmful consequences. This disconnect between knowledge and compulsive behavior\nreflects a fundamental cognitive-behavioral conflict in addiction.\nNeurobiologically, differential cue-induced activity within striatal\nsubregions, along with dopamine-mediated connectivity from the ventral to the\ndorsal striatum, contributes to compulsive drug-seeking. However, the\nfunctional mechanism linking these findings to behavioral conflict remains\nunclear. Another hallmark of addiction is temporal discounting: individuals\nwith drug dependence exhibit steeper discount rates than non-users. Assuming\nthe ventral-dorsal striatal organization reflects a gradient from cognitive to\nmotor representations, addiction can be modeled within a hierarchical\nreinforcement learning (HRL) framework. However, integrating discounting into\nbiologically grounded HRL remains an open challenge. In this work, we build on\na model showing how action choices reinforced with drug rewards become\ninsensitive to the negative consequences that follow. We address the\nintegration of discounting by ensuring natural reward values converge across\nall levels in the HRL hierarchy, while drug rewards diverge due to their\ndopaminergic effects. Our results show that high discounting amplifies\ndrug-seeking across the hierarchy, linking faster discounting with increased\naddiction severity and impulsivity. We demonstrate alignment with empirical\nfindings on temporal discounting and propose testable predictions, establishing\naddiction as a disorder of hierarchical decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Computational inverse problems for biomedical simulators suffer from limited\ndata and relatively high parameter dimensionality. This often requires\nsensitivity analysis, where parameters of the model are ranked based on their\ninfluence on the specific quantities of interest. This is especially important\nfor simulators used to build medical digital twins, as the amount of data is\ntypically limited. For expensive models, such as blood flow models, emulation\nis employed to expedite the simulation time. Parameter ranking and fixing using\nsensitivity analysis are often heuristic, though, and vary with the specific\napplication or simulator used. The present study provides an innovative\nsolution to this problem by leveraging polynomial chaos expansions (PCEs) for\nboth multioutput global sensitivity analysis and formal parameter\nidentifiability. For the former, we use dimension reduction to efficiently\nquantify time-series sensitivity of a one-dimensional pulmonary hemodynamics\nmodel. We consider both Windkessel and structured tree boundary conditions. We\nthen use PCEs to construct profile-likelihood confidence intervals to formally\nassess parameter identifiability, and show how changes in experimental design\nimprove identifiability. Our work presents a novel approach to determining\nparameter identifiability and leverages a common emulation strategy for\nenabling profile-likelihood analysis in problems governed by partial\ndifferential equations.",

However, current modeling approaches remain constrained by the\nlimited availability and intrinsic variability of experimental neuronal data.\nTo capture variability, ensembles of deterministic models are often used, but\nare difficult to scale as model generation requires repeating computationally\nexpensive optimization for each neuron. While deep learning is becoming\nincreasingly relevant in this space, it fails to capture the full biophysical\ncomplexity of neurons, their nonlinear voltage dynamics, and variability. To\naddress these shortcomings, we introduce NOBLE, a neural operator framework\nthat learns a mapping from a continuous frequency-modulated embedding of\ninterpretable neuron features to the somatic voltage response induced by\ncurrent injection. Trained on data generated from biophysically realistic\nneuron models, NOBLE predicts distributions of neural dynamics accounting for\nthe intrinsic experimental variability. Unlike conventional bio-realistic\nneuron models, interpolating within the embedding space offers models whose\ndynamics are consistent with experimentally observed responses. NOBLE is the\nfirst scaled-up deep learning framework validated on real experimental data,\nenabling efficient generation of synthetic neurons that exhibit trial-to-trial\nvariability and achieve a $4200\\times$ speedup over numerical solvers.

    "abstract": "We propose a model to obtain phonemic and prosodic labels of speech that are\ncoherent with graphemes. Unlike previous methods that simply fine-tune a\npre-trained ASR model with the labels, the proposed model conditions the label\ngeneration on corresponding graphemes by two methods: 1) Add implicit grapheme\nconditioning through prompt encoder using pre-trained BERT features. 2)\nExplicitly prune the label hypotheses inconsistent with the grapheme during\ninference. These methods enable obtaining parallel data of speech, the labels,\nand graphemes, which is applicable to various downstream tasks such as\ntext-to-speech and accent estimation from text. Experiments showed that the\nproposed method significantly improved the consistency between graphemes and\nthe predicted labels. Further, experiments on accent estimation task confirmed\nthat the created parallel data by the proposed method effectively improve the\nestimation accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Crack detection on road surfaces is a critical measurement technology in the\ninstrumentation domain, essential for ensuring infrastructure safety and\ntransportation reliability. However, due to limited energy and low-resolution\nimaging, smart terminal devices struggle to maintain real-time monitoring\nperformance. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-stage\ndetection approach for road crack detection, EECD-Net, to enhance accuracy and\nenergy efficiency of instrumentation. Specifically, the sophisticated\nSuper-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network (SRCNN) is employed to address\nthe inherent challenges of low-quality images, which effectively enhance image\nresolution while preserving critical structural details. Meanwhile, a Spike\nConvolution Unit (SCU) with Continuous Integrate-and-Fire (CIF) neurons is\nproposed to convert these images into sparse pulse sequences, significantly\nreducing power consumption. Additionally, a Gated Attention Transformer (GAT)\nmodule is designed to strategically fuse multi-scale feature representations\nthrough adaptive attention mechanisms, effectively capturing both long-range\ndependencies and intricate local crack patterns, and significantly enhancing\ndetection robustness across varying crack morphologies. The experiments on the\nCrackVision12K benchmark demonstrate that EECD-Net achieves a remarkable 98.6\\%\ndetection accuracy, surpassing state-of-the-art counterparts such as\nHybrid-Segmentor by a significant 1.5\\%. Notably, the EECD-Net maintains\nexceptional energy efficiency, consuming merely 5.6 mJ, which is a substantial\n33\\% reduction compared to baseline implementations. This work pioneers a\ntransformative approach in instrumentation-based crack detection, offering a\nscalable, low-power solution for real-time, large-scale infrastructure\nmonitoring in resource-constrained environments.",

    "abstract": "Users of social media platforms based on recommendation systems (RecSys)\n(e.g. TikTok, X, YouTube) strategically interact with platform content to\ninfluence future recommendations. On some such platforms, users have been\ndocumented to form large-scale grassroots movements encouraging others to\npurposefully interact with algorithmically suppressed content in order to\n\"boost\" its recommendation; we term this behavior user altruism. To capture\nthis behavior, we study a game between users and a RecSys, where users provide\nthe RecSys (potentially manipulated) preferences over the contents available to\nthem, and the RecSys -- limited by data and computation constraints -- creates\na low-rank approximation preference matrix, and ultimately provides each user\nher (approximately) most-preferred item. We compare the users' social welfare\nunder truthful preference reporting and under a class of strategies capturing\nuser altruism. In our theoretical analysis, we provide sufficient conditions to\nensure strict increases in user social welfare under user altruism, and provide\nan algorithm to find an effective altruistic strategy. Interestingly, we show\nthat for commonly assumed recommender utility functions, effectively altruistic\nstrategies also improve the utility of the RecSys! We show that our results are\nrobust to several model misspecifications, thus strengthening our conclusions.\nOur theoretical analysis is complemented by empirical results of effective\naltruistic strategies on the GoodReads dataset, and an online survey on how\nreal-world users behave altruistically in RecSys. Overall, our findings serve\nas a proof-of-concept of the reasons why traditional RecSys may incentivize\nusers to form collectives and/or follow altruistic strategies when interacting\nwith them.",

Drawing inspiration from perturbation theory in physics, PGT uses\nrandom perturbations in the network's parameter space to approximate gradient\nupdates using only forward passes. We demonstrate the feasibility of this\napproach on both simulated neural network architectures, including a dense\nnetwork and a transformer model with a reservoir layer, and on experimental\nhardware using a magnonic auto-oscillation ring as the physical reservoir. Our\nresults show that PGT can achieve performance comparable to that of standard\nbackpropagation methods in cases where backpropagation is impractical or\nimpossible.

We report the\ndiscovery of five such transients, and classify them based on their synchrotron\nemission energetics and host galaxy properties.
