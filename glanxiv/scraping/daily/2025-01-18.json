    "abstract": "The variational autoencoder (VAE) is a popular, deep, latent-variable model\n(DLVM) due to its simple yet effective formulation for modeling the data\ndistribution. Moreover, optimizing the VAE objective function is more\nmanageable than other DLVMs. The bottleneck dimension of the VAE is a crucial\ndesign choice, and it has strong ramifications for the model's performance,\nsuch as finding the hidden explanatory factors of a dataset using the\nrepresentations learned by the VAE. However, the size of the latent dimension\nof the VAE is often treated as a hyperparameter estimated empirically through\ntrial and error. To this end, we propose a statistical formulation to discover\nthe relevant latent factors required for modeling a dataset. In this work, we\nuse a hierarchical prior in the latent space that estimates the variance of the\nlatent axes using the encoded data, which identifies the relevant latent\ndimensions. For this, we replace the fixed prior in the VAE objective function\nwith a hierarchical prior, keeping the remainder of the formulation unchanged.\nWe call the proposed method the automatic relevancy detection in the\nvariational autoencoder (ARD-VAE). We demonstrate the efficacy of the ARD-VAE\non multiple benchmark datasets in finding the relevant latent dimensions and\ntheir effect on different evaluation metrics, such as FID score and\ndisentanglement analysis.",

    "abstract": "We use a tensor unfolding technique to prove a new identifiability result for\ndiscrete bipartite graphical models, which have a bipartite graph between an\nobserved and a latent layer. This model family includes popular models such as\nNoisy-Or Bayesian networks for medical diagnosis and Restricted Boltzmann\nMachines in machine learning. These models are also building blocks for deep\ngenerative models. Our result on identifying the graph structure enjoys the\nfollowing nice properties. First, our identifiability proof is constructive, in\nwhich we innovatively unfold the population tensor under the model into\nmatrices and inspect the rank properties of the resulting matrices to uncover\nthe graph. This proof itself gives a population-level structure learning\nalgorithm that outputs both the number of latent variables and the bipartite\ngraph. Second, we allow various forms of nonlinear dependence among the\nvariables, unlike many continuous latent variable graphical models that rely on\nlinearity to show identifiability. Third, our identifiability condition is\ninterpretable, only requiring each latent variable to connect to at least two\n\"pure\" observed variables in the bipartite graph. The new result not only\nbrings novel advances in algebraic statistics, but also has useful implications\nfor these models' trustworthy applications in scientific disciplines and\ninterpretable machine learning.",

    "abstract": "We study the stationary, intermittent, and nonlinear dynamics of natural and\nforced supersonic twin-rectangular turbulent jets using spectral modal\ndecomposition. We decompose large-eddy simulation data into four reflectional\nsymmetry components about the major and minor axes. In the natural jet,\nspectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD) uncovers two resonant\ninstabilities antisymmetric about the major axis. Known as screech tones, the\nmore energetic of the two is symmetric about the minor axis and steady, while\nthe other is intermittent. We test the hypothesis that flow symmetry can be\nleveraged for control design. Time-periodic forcing symmetric about the major\nand minor axes is implemented using a plasma actuation model, and succeeds in\nremoving screech from a different symmetry component. We investigate the\nspectral peaks of the forced jet using an extension of bispectral mode\ndecomposition (BMD), where the bispectrum is bounded by unity and which\nconditionally recovers the SPOD. We explain the appearance of harmonic peaks as\nthree sets of triadic interactions between reflectional symmetries, forming an\ninterconnected triad network. BMD modes of active triads distil coherent\nstructures comprising multiple coupled instabilities, including\nKelvin-Helmholtz, core, and guided-jet modes (G-JM). Downstream-propagating\ncore modes can be symmetric or antisymmetric about the major axis, whereas\nupstream-propagating G-JM responsible for screech closure (Edgington-Mitchell\net al., 2022, JFM) are antisymmetric only. The dependence of G-JM on symmetry\nhence translates from the azimuthal symmetry of the round jet to the dihedral\ngroup symmetry of the twin-rectangular jet, and explains why the twin jet\nexhibits antisymmetric but not symmetric screech modes.",

    "abstract": "Electroencephalograph (EEG) is a crucial tool for studying brain activity.\nRecently, self-supervised learning methods leveraging large unlabeled datasets\nhave emerged as a potential solution to the scarcity of widely available\nannotated EEG data. However, current methods suffer from at least one of the\nfollowing limitations: i) sub-optimal EEG signal modeling, ii) model sizes in\nthe hundreds of millions of trainable parameters, and iii) reliance on private\ndatasets and/or inconsistent public benchmarks, hindering reproducibility. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce a Compact Encoder for Representations of\nBrain Oscillations using alternating attention (CEReBrO), a new small EEG\nfoundation model. Our tokenization scheme represents EEG signals at a\nper-channel patch granularity. We propose an alternating attention mechanism\nthat jointly models intra-channel temporal dynamics and inter-channel spatial\ncorrelations, achieving 2x speed improvement with 6x less memory required\ncompared to standard self-attention. We present several model sizes ranging\nfrom 3.6 million to 85 million parameters. Pre-trained on over 20,000 hours of\npublicly available scalp EEG recordings with diverse channel configurations,\nour models set new benchmarks in emotion detection and seizure detection tasks,\nwith competitive performance in anomaly classification and gait prediction.\nThis validates our models' effectiveness and efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is a promising technology that enables edge\ndevices/clients to collaboratively and iteratively train a machine learning\nmodel under the coordination of a central server. The most common approach to\nFL is first-order methods, where clients send their local gradients to the\nserver in each iteration. However, these methods often suffer from slow\nconvergence rates. As a remedy, second-order methods, such as quasi-Newton, can\nbe employed in FL to accelerate its convergence. Unfortunately, similarly to\nthe first-order FL methods, the application of second-order methods in FL can\nlead to unfair models, achieving high average accuracy while performing poorly\non certain clients' local datasets. To tackle this issue, in this paper we\nintroduce a novel second-order FL framework, dubbed \\textbf{d}istributed\n\\textbf{q}uasi-\\textbf{N}ewton \\textbf{fed}erated learning (DQN-Fed). This\napproach seeks to ensure fairness while leveraging the fast convergence\nproperties of quasi-Newton methods in the FL context. Specifically, DQN-Fed\nhelps the server update the global model in such a way that (i) all local loss\nfunctions decrease to promote fairness, and (ii) the rate of change in local\nloss functions aligns with that of the quasi-Newton method. We prove the\nconvergence of DQN-Fed and demonstrate its \\textit{linear-quadratic}\nconvergence rate. Moreover, we validate the efficacy of DQN-Fed across a range\nof federated datasets, showing that it surpasses state-of-the-art fair FL\nmethods in fairness, average accuracy and convergence speed.",

    "abstract": "Intelligent agents, such as robots and virtual agents, must understand the\ndynamics of complex social interactions to interact with humans. Effectively\nrepresenting social dynamics is challenging because we require multi-modal,\nsynchronized observations to understand a scene. We explore how using a single\nmodality, the pose behavior, of multiple individuals in a social interaction\ncan be used to generate nonverbal social cues for the facilitator of that\ninteraction. The facilitator acts to make a social interaction proceed smoothly\nand is an essential role for intelligent agents to replicate in human-robot\ninteractions. In this paper, we adapt an existing diffusion behavior cloning\nmodel to learn and replicate facilitator behaviors. Furthermore, we evaluate\ntwo representations of pose observations from a scene, one representation has\npre-processing applied and one does not. The purpose of this paper is to\nintroduce a new use for diffusion behavior cloning for pose generation in\nsocial interactions. The second is to understand the relationship between\nperformance and computational load for generating social pose behavior using\ntwo different techniques for collecting scene observations. As such, we are\nessentially testing the effectiveness of two different types of conditioning\nfor a diffusion model. We then evaluate the resulting generated behavior from\neach technique using quantitative measures such as mean per-joint position\nerror (MPJPE), training time, and inference time. Additionally, we plot\ntraining and inference time against MPJPE to examine the trade-offs between\nefficiency and performance. Our results suggest that the further pre-processed\ndata can successfully condition diffusion models to generate realistic social\nbehavior, with reasonable trade-offs in accuracy and processing time.",

Constrained decoding has emerged as\nthe dominant technology across sectors for enforcing structured outputs during\ngeneration. Despite its growing adoption, little has been done with the\nsystematic evaluation of the behaviors and performance of constrained decoding.\nConstrained decoding frameworks have standardized around JSON Schema as a\nstructured data format, with most uses guaranteeing constraint compliance given\na schema. However, there is poor understanding of the effectiveness of the\nmethods in practice. We present an evaluation framework to assess constrained\ndecoding approaches across three critical dimensions: efficiency in generating\nconstraint-compliant outputs, coverage of diverse constraint types, and quality\nof the generated outputs. To facilitate this evaluation, we introduce\nJSONSchemaBench, a benchmark for constrained decoding comprising 10K real-world\nJSON schemas that encompass a wide range of constraints with varying\ncomplexity. We pair the benchmark with the existing official JSON Schema Test\nSuite and evaluate six state-of-the-art constrained decoding frameworks,\nincluding Guidance, Outlines, Llamacpp, XGrammar, OpenAI, and Gemini. Through\nextensive experiments, we gain insights into the capabilities and limitations\nof constrained decoding on structured generation with real-world JSON schemas.\nOur work provides actionable insights for improving constrained decoding\nframeworks and structured generation tasks, setting a new standard for\nevaluating constrained decoding and structured generation.

These strategies jointly optimize the number\nof users, $\\Omega$, and the parallel streams decoded by each user, $\\beta_k$,\nensuring linear decodability for all target users.

    "abstract": "Optimal experimental design (OED) is a framework that leverages a\nmathematical model of the experiment to identify optimal conditions for\nconducting the experiment. Under a Bayesian approach, the design objective\nfunction is typically chosen to be the expected information gain (EIG).\nHowever, EIG is intractable for nonlinear models and must be estimated\nnumerically. Estimating the EIG generally entails some variant of Monte Carlo\nsampling, requiring repeated data model and likelihood evaluations\n$\\unicode{x2013}$ each involving solving the governing equations of the\nexperimental physics $\\unicode{x2013}$ under different sample realizations.\nThis computation becomes impractical for high-fidelity models.\n  We introduce a novel multi-fidelity EIG (MF-EIG) estimator under the\napproximate control variate (ACV) framework. This estimator is unbiased with\nrespect to the high-fidelity mean, and minimizes variance under a given\ncomputational budget. We achieve this by first reparameterizing the EIG so that\nits expectations are independent of the data models, a requirement for\ncompatibility with ACV. We then provide specific examples under different data\nmodel forms, as well as practical enhancements of sample size optimization and\nsample reuse techniques. We demonstrate the MF-EIG estimator in two numerical\nexamples: a nonlinear benchmark and a turbulent flow problem involving the\ncalibration of shear-stress transport turbulence closure model parameters\nwithin the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes model. We validate the estimator's\nunbiasedness and observe one- to two-orders-of-magnitude variance reduction\ncompared to existing single-fidelity EIG estimators.",

Far from being a moot historical point, this allows for a more\nunified approach in considering the many two-sample nonparametric tests based\non ranks, signs, placements, order statistics, and runs. Perhaps more\nimportantly, this approach also allows for the easy extension of many\nunivariate nonparametric tests into arbitrarily high dimensions that retain all\nnull properties regardless of dimensionality and are invariant to the scaling\nof the observations. These generalizations do not require depth functions or\nthe explicit use of spatial signs or ranks and may be of use in various areas\nsuch as life-testing and quality control.

    "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved notable performance in\ncomputer vision tasks that require reasoning across visual and textual\nmodalities, yet their capabilities are limited to their pre-trained data,\nrequiring extensive fine-tuning for updates. Recent researches have explored\nthe use of In-Context Learning (ICL) to overcome these challenges by providing\na set of demonstrating examples as context to augment MLLMs performance in\nseveral tasks, showing that many-shot ICL leads to substantial improvements\ncompared to few-shot ICL. However, the reliance on numerous demonstrating\nexamples and the limited MLLMs context windows presents significant obstacles.\nThis paper aims to address these challenges by introducing a novel approach,\nVisual RAG, that synergically combines the MLLMs capability to learn from the\ncontext, with a retrieval mechanism. The crux of this approach is to ensure to\naugment the MLLM knowledge by selecting only the most relevant demonstrating\nexamples for the query, pushing it to learn by analogy. In this way, relying on\nthe new information provided dynamically during inference time, the resulting\nsystem is not limited to the knowledge extracted from the training data, but\ncan be updated rapidly and easily without fine-tuning. Furthermore, this\ngreatly reduces the computational costs for improving the model image\nclassification performance, and augments the model knowledge to new visual\ndomains and tasks it was not trained for. Extensive experiments on eight\ndifferent datasets in the state of the art spanning several domains and image\nclassification tasks show that the proposed Visual RAG, compared to the most\nrecent state of the art (i.e., many-shot ICL), is able to obtain an accuracy\nthat is very close or even higher (approx. +2% improvement on average) while\nusing a much smaller set of demonstrating examples (approx. only 23% on\naverage).",

In this study, we investigate the collisional\nevolution of Hilda asteroids and apply it to study the cratering on asteroid\n334 Chicago, as well as to determine whether impacts between Hildas and qH can\nserve as a viable mechanism for inducing cometary activity. We simulated the\ncollisional evolution of Hilda asteroids over a period of 4 Gyr. We considered\nthree initial size-frequency distributions (SFD) and two scaling laws for the\ncollisional outcomes and performed a large set of simulations for each scenario\nwhich we used to construct median SFDs of the Hilda population. We also derived\nimpactor SFD on asteroid 334 Chicago and used it to calculate the crater SFD on\n334 Chicago. Additionally, we evaluated the subcatastrophic impact timescale\nbetween Hilda and qH objects. The observed SFD of Hilda asteroids larger than 3\nkm is best matched by scenarios assuming that such SFD is mostly primordial,\nimplying minimal collisional activity over time. For smaller sizes, although\nunconstrained, the SFD steepens significantly due to the catastrophic\nfragmentation of a small number of multikilometer-sized bodies. We determined\nthat the largest impactor on 334 Chicago measures a few kilometers in size,\nresulting in a maximum crater size of approximately 30 km. Furthermore, the\nslope of the crater SFD mirrors that of the initial SFD for subkilometric\nbodies. While impact events between Hildas and qH can induce observable\nactivity and although stochastic in nature, the timescale of such events\nexceeds the dynamical lifetime of qH, making them an unlikely primary mechanism\nfor inducing observable activity.",

This is the case for multilabel learning (MLL) algorithms used to\nclassify patterns, rank labels, or learn the distribution of outputs. Many\nsolutions have been proposed in the literature. The one that can be applied\nuniversally, independent of the algorithm used to build the model, is data\nresampling. The generation of new instances associated with minority labels, so\nthat empty areas of the feature space are filled, helps to improve the obtained\nmodels.

In this paper, a diffusion model tailored to produce new\ninstances for MLL data, called MLDM (\\textit{MultiLabel Diffusion Model}), is\nproposed.

    "abstract": "Trajectory prediction methods have been widely applied in autonomous driving\ntechnologies. Although the overall performance accuracy of trajectory\nprediction is relatively high, the lack of trajectory data in critical\nscenarios in the training data leads to the long-tail phenomenon. Normally, the\ntrajectories of the tail data are more critical and more difficult to predict\nand may include rare scenarios such as crashes. To solve this problem, we\nextracted the trajectory data from real-world crash scenarios, which contain\nmore long-tail data. Meanwhile, based on the trajectory data in this scenario,\nwe integrated graph-based risk information and diffusion with transformer and\nproposed the Risk-Informed Diffusion Transformer (RI-DiT) trajectory prediction\nmethod. Extensive experiments were conducted on trajectory data in the\nreal-world crash scenario, and the results show that the algorithm we proposed\nhas good performance. When predicting the data of the tail 10\\% (Top 10\\%), the\nminADE and minFDE indicators are 0.016/2.667 m. At the same time, we showed the\ntrajectory conditions of different long-tail distributions. The distribution of\ntrajectory data is closer to the tail, the less smooth the trajectory is.\nThrough the trajectory data in real-world crash scenarios, Our work expands the\nmethods to overcome the long-tail challenges in trajectory prediction. Our\nmethod, RI-DiT, integrates inverse time to collision (ITTC) and the feature of\ntraffic flow, which can predict long-tail trajectories more accurately and\nimprove the safety of autonomous driving systems.",

How the solar shape evolves with\nthe solar cycle has been a challenging problem. Analysis of the helioseismic\ndata, which are the most accurate measure of the solar structure up to now,\nleads to the determination of asphericity coeffcients which have been found to\nchange with time. We show here that by inverting even coeffcients of f-mode\noscillation frequency splitting to obtain the oblateness magnitude and its\ntemporal dependence can be inferred. It is found that the oblateness variations\nlag the solar activity cycles by about 3 years. A major change occurred between\nsolar cycles 23 and 24 is that the oblateness was greater in cycle 24 despite\nthe lower solar activity level. Such results may help to better understand the\nnear-subsurface layers as they strongly impacts the internal dynamics of the\nSun and may induce instabilities driving the transport of angular momentum.",

We propose\nto learn semantically comprehensive yet compact latent representations of the\n(image, mask) space, which we jointly model with a Latent Diffusion Model. We\nshow that our approach can effectively synthesise unseen high-quality paired\nsegmentation data of remarkable semantic coherence. Generative augmentation is\ntypically applied pre-training by synthesising a fixed number of additional\ntraining samples to improve downstream task models. To enhance this approach,\nwe further propose Generative Adaptive Uncertainty-guided Diffusion-based\nAugmentation (GAUDA), leveraging the epistemic uncertainty of a Bayesian\ndownstream model for targeted online synthesis. We condition the generative\nmodel on classes with high estimated uncertainty during training to produce\nadditional unseen samples for these classes.

The detailed analysis of each defense mechanism with real life\napplicability is explained.

In this paper, we first consider a general framework based on the\nconcept of a construction graph - a graph associated with an instance of the\noptimization problem under study, where feasible solutions are represented by\nwalks. We analyze the running time of this ACO variant, known as the\nGraph-based Ant System with time-dependent evaporation rate (GBAS/tdev), and\nprove that the algorithm's solution converges to the optimal solution of the\nproblem with probability 1 for a slightly stronger evaporation rate function\nthan was previously known. We then consider two time-dependent adaptations of\nAttiratanasunthron and Fakcharoenphol's $n$-ANT algorithm: $n$-ANT with\ntime-dependent evaporation rate ($n$-ANT/tdev) and $n$-ANT with time-dependent\nlower pheromone bound ($n$-ANT/tdlb). We analyze both variants on the single\ndestination shortest path problem (SDSP). Our results show that $n$-ANT/tdev\nhas a super-polynomial time lower bound on the SDSP. In contrast, we show that\n$n$-ANT/tdlb achieves a polynomial time upper bound on this problem.",

This study addresses this\nchallenge by exploring semi-supervised auto-labeling methods, integrating self\nand active learning approaches to develop an efficient, label-scarce framework\nfor auto-labeling large poultry datasets (ALPD). For this study, video data\nwere collected from broilers and laying hens housed. Various machine learning\nmodels, including zero-shot models and supervised models, were utilized for\nbroilers and hens detection. The results showed that YOLOv8s-World and YOLOv9s\nperformed better when compared performance metrics for broiler and hen\ndetection under supervised learning, while among the semi-supervised model,\nYOLOv8s-ALPD achieved the highest precision (96.1%) and recall (99%) with an\nRMSE of 1.87. The hybrid YOLO-World model, incorporating the optimal YOLOv8s\nbackbone with zero-shot models, demonstrated the highest overall performance.\nIt achieved a precision of 99.2%, recall of 99.4%, and an F1 score of 98.7% for\ndetection. In addition, the semi-supervised models with minimal human\nintervention (active learning) reduced annotation time by over 80% compared to\nfull manual labeling. Moreover, integrating zero-shot models with the best\nmodels enhanced broiler and hen detection, achieving comparable results to\nsupervised models while significantly increasing speed. In conclusion,\nintegrating semi-supervised auto-labeling and zero-shot models significantly\nimproves detection accuracy.

Conventional\nwisdom says that key features of scattering amplitudes, like factorization at\ntheir poles into lower-point amplitudes, are associated to their singularities.\nThe factorization behavior of CEGM amplitudes at their poles is interesting but\ncomplicated. Recent developments have revealed important properties of standard\nparticle and string scattering amplitudes from factorizations, known as splits,\nthat happen away from poles. In this paper we introduce a kinematic subspace on\nwhich the CEGM amplitude splits into very simple rational functions. These\nfunctions, called simplex amplitudes, arise from stringy integrals for the\nmultivariate beta function, and also from restricting the biadjoint scalar\namplitude in quantum field theory to certain kinematic loci.

A teacher model, trained with full or almost exact\nknowledge of a synthetic sensing operator, guides a student model with an\ninexact real sensing operator.

    "abstract": "Modeling the spectral energy distribution (SED) of active galactic nuclei\n(AGN) plays a very important role in constraining modern cosmological\nsimulations of galaxy formation. Here, we utilize an advanced supermassive\nblack hole (SMBH) accretion disk model to compute the accretion flow structure\nand AGN SED across a wide range of black hole mass ($M_{\\rm SMBH}$) and\ndimensionless accretion rates $\\dot{m}(\\equiv \\dot{M}_{\\rm\nacc}/\\dot{M}_\\mathrm{Edd})$, where $\\dot{M}_{\\rm acc}$ is the mass flow rate\nthrough the disk and $\\dot{M}_\\mathrm{Edd}$ is the Eddington mass accretion\nrate. We find that the radiative efficiency is mainly influenced by $\\dot m$,\nwhile contributions of $M_{\\rm SMBH}$ and $\\dot{m}$ to the bolometric\nluminosity are comparably important. We have developed new scaling\nrelationships that relate the bolometric luminosity of an AGN to its\nluminosities in the hard X-ray, soft X-ray, and optical bands. Our results\nalign with existing literature at high luminosities but suggest lower\nluminosities in the hard and soft X-ray bands for AGNs with low bolometric\nluminosities than commonly reported values. Combining with the semi-analytical\nmodel of galaxy formation \\textsc{L-Galaxies} and Millennium dark matter\nsimulation for the distribution of ($M_{\\rm SMBH}, \\dot{m}$) at different\nredshift, we find the model predictions align well with observational data at\nredshifts below 1 but deviates for higher redshifts regarding AGN detection\nfraction and luminosity functions. This deviation may arise from improper\ntreatment of SMBH growth at high redshifts in the model or bias from limited\nobservational data. This AGN SED calculation can be readily applied in other\ncosmological simulations.",

Recent studies, however, showed that metals can deliver ultra-high\nthermoelectric power factors (PFs) under certain conditions. In this work, we\ntheoretically examine the electronic structure and electronic transport\nspecifications which allow for such high PFs. Using Boltzmann transport (BTE)\nsimulations and a multi-band electronic structure model, we show that metals\nwith: i) high degree of transport asymmetry between their bands, ii) strong\ninter-band scattering, and iii) a large degree of band overlap, can provide\nultra-high power factors. We show that each of these characteristics adds to\nthe steepness of the transport distribution function of the BTE, which allows\nfor an increase of the Seebeck coefficient to sizable values, simultaneously\nwith an increase in the electrical conductivity. This work generalizes the\nconcept that transport asymmetry (i.e., mixture of energy regions of high and\nlow contributions to the electrical conductivity), through a combination of\ndifferent band masses, scattering strengths, or energy filtering scenarios,\netc., can indeed result in very high thermoelectric power factors, even in the\nabsence of a material bandgap. Under certain conditions, transport asymmetry\ncan over-compensate any performance degradation to the PF due to bipolar\nconduction and the naturally low Seebeck coefficients that otherwise exist in\nthis class of materials.",

Traditional sampling methods,\nsuch as farthest point sampling, lack task-specific information and, as a\nresult, cannot guarantee optimal performance in specific applications.\nLearning-based methods train a network to sample the point cloud for the\ntargeted downstream task. However, they do not guarantee that the sampled\npoints are the most relevant ones. Moreover, they may result in duplicate\nsampled points, which requires completion of the sampled point cloud through\npost-processing techniques. To address these limitations, we propose a\ncontribution-based sampling network (CS-Net), where the sampling operation is\nformulated as a Top-k operation. To ensure that the network can be trained in\nan end-to-end way using gradient descent algorithms, we use a differentiable\napproximation to the Top-k operation via entropy regularization of an optimal\ntransport problem. Our network consists of a feature embedding module, a\ncascade attention module, and a contribution scoring module. The feature\nembedding module includes a specifically designed spatial pooling layer to\nreduce parameters while preserving important features. The cascade attention\nmodule combines the outputs of three skip connected offset attention layers to\nemphasize the attractive features and suppress less important ones. The\ncontribution scoring module generates a contribution score for each point and\nguides the sampling process to prioritize the most important ones.

Recent appearance modeling\napproaches in Gaussian Splatting are either tightly coupled with the rendering\nprocess, hindering real-time rendering, or they only account for mild global\nvariations, performing poorly in scenes with local light changes.

    "abstract": "Toroidal structures are a common feature in a wide variety of astrophysical\nobjects, including dusty tori in AGNs, rings in galaxies, protoplanetary disks,\nand others. The matter distribution in such structures is not homogeneous and\ncan be flattened by self-gravity or become elongated in the vertical direction,\nas is the case with obscuring tori in AGNs. This led us to consider the more\ngeneral case of the gravitational potential of an inhomogeneous torus with an\nelliptical cross-section. We begin by showing that the outer potential of a\nhomogeneous elliptical torus can be effectively approximated with less than 1\\%\nerror by the potentials of two infinitely thin rings with a minor correction\nterm. These two rings have masses each equal to half the total mass of the\ntorus. The most notable feature is that each such infinitely thin ring is\npositioned at precisely the halfway point between the center and the focus of\nthe elliptical cross-section, regardless of the torus' other parameters. The\nresult, which holds for both oblate and prolate geometries, allows us to find a\nnew expression to handle the outer potential of an inhomogeneous torus with an\nelliptical cross-section. The confocal density distribution is a special case.\nWe have found that the outer potential of such a torus is only weakly dependent\nof the density distribution law. Consequently, even for the confocal\ninhomogeneous case, the outer potential is well represented by two infinitely\nthin rings. This approach can simplify problems of dynamics for the systems\nconsisting of toroidal structures. We have also derived the expressions for the\nexternal force components exerted by a homogeneous torus with an elliptical\ncross-section, both for the exact form of the potential and for our\napproximation by two infinitely thin rings. Comparison of the two shows that\nour model fits the true trend of the force well.",

Under the adiabatic approximation, the time-dependent spin\nmagnetization can be calculated by a Berry-phase method. In this paper, we\nfocus on its time average, which is evaluated by assuming that the phonon\ndisplacement is small. As a result, the time average of the spin magnetization\nis concisely formulated in the form of the Berry curvature defined in the\nphonon-displacement space as an intrinsic property of atomic rotations.

    "abstract": "Photon-counting detector based computed tomography (PCCT) has greatly\nadvanced in recent years. However, the spectral inconsistency is still a\nserious challenge for PCCT that could directly introduce obvious artifacts and\nsevere inaccuracies. This work attempts to overcome the challenge by modeling\nthe spectral inconsistency in a novel, unified, and two-term factorized\nframework, with a spectral skew term independent of the energy threshold, and\nan energy-threshold bias analytical characterization term. To solve the\nspectral inconsistency, a two-step decomposition algorithm called\nenergy-threshold bias calculator (ETB-Cal) is derived here, in which the\nspectral skew term is grossly determined at a relatively low energy threshold\nand only the energy-threshold bias is needed to be calculated as the energy\nthreshold changes. After the two terms being computed out in calibration stage,\nthey will be incorporated into our spectral model to generate the spectral\ncorrection vectors as well as the material decomposition vectors if needed, for\nPCCT projection data. To validate our method, both numerical simulations\nphysics experiments were carried out on a tabletop PCCT system. Preliminary\nresults showed that the spectral inconsistency can be significantly reduced,\nfor example, with an non-uniformity quantitative indicators decreasing from\n26.27 to 5.80 HU for Gammex multi-energy phantom and from 27.88 to 3.16 HU for\nkyoto head phantom. The considerable improvements consistently demonstrate a\ngreat potential of the proposed novel physics-model based correction scheme in\npractical applications, as computationally efficient, calibration-wise\nconvenient with high degree of generality, and substantially avoiding the use\nof X-ray florescence material in the energy-threshold calibration.",

However,\nthe integration of superconducting resonators with feedback mechanisms to\ncreate ultra-low noise oscillators is a relatively unexplored area, and the\napplication of such oscillators in ESR spectroscopy has not yet been\ndemonstrated. In this work, we report the design, fabrication, and application\nof microwave oscillators based on superconducting resonators for ESR\nspectroscopy, illustrating an alternative way for the improvement of the\nperformance of oscillator based ESR sensors. Specifically, ESR spectra are\nobtained by measuring the oscillator's frequency shift induced by the ESR\neffect as a function of the applied static magnetic field. The oscillators are\ncomposed of a single heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT) or high electron\nmobility transistor (HEMT) coupled with NbTi or YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ (YBCO)\nsuperconducting resonators. The fabricated oscillators operate at frequencies\nof 0.6 and 1.7 GHz and temperatures up to 80 K (for YBCO resonators) and 8 K\n(for NbTi resonators). The lowest measured frequency noise is about 9\nmHz/Hz$^{1/2}$ (-139 dBc/Hz), the best spin sensitivity is about\n$1\\times10^{10}$ spins/Hz$^{1/2}$, and the best concentration sensitivity is\nabout $3\\times10^{18}$ spins/Hz$^{1/2}$m$^3$.

We aim to investigate differences between different parts of the DR9\nfootprint. Furthermore, we want to measure the BAO scale for luminous red\ngalaxies within them. Our selected redshift range of 0.6 to 0.8 corresponds to\nthe bin in which a tension between DESI Y1 and eBOSS was found.\n  Methods. We calculated the anisotropic two-point correlation function in a\nmodified binning scheme to detect the BAOs in DR9 data. We then used template\nfits based on simulations to measure the BAO scale in the imaging data.\n  Results. Our analysis reveals the expected correlation function shape in most\nof the footprint areas, showing a BAO scale consistent with Planck's\nobservations. Aside from identified mask-related data issues in the southern\nregion of the South Galactic Cap, we find a notable variance between the\ndifferent footprints.\n  Conclusions. We find that this variance is consistent with the difference\nbetween the DESI Y1 and eBOSS data, and it supports the argument that that\ntension is caused by sample variance. Additionally, we also uncovered\nsystematic biases not previously accounted for in photometric BAO studies. We\nemphasize the necessity of adjusting for the systematic shift in the BAO scale\nassociated with typical photometric redshift uncertainties to ensure accurate\nmeasurements.",

    "abstract": "Flexible-antenna systems, such as fluid antennas and movable antennas, have\nbeen recognized as key enabling technologies for sixth-generation (6G) wireless\nnetworks, as they can intelligently reconfigure the effective channel gains of\nthe users and hence significantly improve their data transmission capabilities.\nHowever, existing flexible-antenna systems have been designed to combat\nsmall-scale fading in non-line-of-sight (NLoS) conditions. As a result, they\nlack the ability to establish line-of-sight links, which are typically 100\ntimes stronger than NLoS links. In addition, existing flexible-antenna systems\nhave limited flexibility, where adding/removing an antenna is not\nstraightforward. This article introduces an innovative flexible-antenna system\ncalled pinching antennas, which are realized by applying small dielectric\nparticles to waveguides. We first describe the basics of pinching-antenna\nsystems and their ability to provide strong LoS links by deploying pinching\nantennas close to the users as well as their capability to scale up/down the\nantenna system. We then focus on communication scenarios with different numbers\nof waveguides and pinching antennas, where innovative approaches to implement\nmultiple-input multiple-output and non-orthogonal multiple access are\ndiscussed. In addition, promising 6G-related applications of pinching antennas,\nincluding integrated sensing and communication and next-generation multiple\naccess, are presented. Finally, important directions for future research, such\nas waveguide deployment and channel estimation, are highlighted.",

This paper explores the capability of smartphones as computing\ndevices for a quadcopter, specifically in terms of the ability of drones to\nmaintain a position known as the position hold function. Image processing can\nbe performed with the phone's sensors and powerful built-in camera. Method.\nUsing Shi-Tomasi corner detection and the Lucas-Kanade sparse optical flow\nalgorithms, ground features are recognized and tracked using the\ndownward-facing camera. The position is maintained by computing quadcopter\ndisplacement from the center of the image using Euclidian distance, and the\ncorresponding pitch and roll estimate is calculated using the PID controller.\nResults. Actual flights show a double standard deviation of 18.66 cm from the\ncenter for outdoor tests. With a quadcopter size of 58cm x 58cm used, it\nimplies that 95% of the time, the quadcopter is within a diameter of 96 cm. For\nindoor tests, a double standard deviation of 10.55 cm means that 95% of the\ntime, the quadcopter is within a diameter of 79 cm. Conclusion. Smartphone\nsensors and cameras can be used to perform optical flow position hold\nfunctions, proving their potential as computing devices for drones.\nRecommendations. To further improve the positioning system of the phone-based\nquadcopter system, it is suggested that potential sensor fusion be explored\nwith the phone's GNSS sensor, which gives absolute positioning information for\noutdoor applications.

The results of\nthese methods cover large fields of physical quantities at very many discrete\nspatial locations and temporal points. Efficient compression methods can be\nhelpful for processing and reusing such large amounts of data. A compression\ntechnique is attractive if it causes only a small additional effort and the\nloss of information with strong compression is low. The paper presents the\ndevelopment of an incremental Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) strategy for\ncompressing time-dependent particle simulation results. The approach is based\non an algorithm that was previously developed for grid-based, regular snapshot\ndata matrices. It is further developed here to process highly irregular data\nmatrices generated by particle simulation methods during simulation. Various\naspects important for information loss, computational effort and storage\nrequirements are discussed, and corresponding solution techniques are\ninvestigated. These include the development of an adaptive rank truncation\napproach, the assessment of imputation strategies to close snapshot matrix gaps\ncaused by temporarily inactive particles, a suggestion for sequencing the data\nhistory into temporal windows as well as bundling the SVD updates. The\nsimulation-accompanying method is embedded in a parallel, industrialized\nSmoothed-Particle Hydrodynamics software and applied to several 2D and 3D test\ncases.

The ability to detect and quantify\nquantum steering is crucial for these applications. Semi-definite programming\n(SDP) has proven to be a valuable tool to quantify quantum steering. However,\nthe challenge lies in the fact that the optimal measurement strategy is not\npriori known, making it time-consuming to compute the steerable measure for any\ngiven quantum state. Furthermore, the utilization of SDP requires full\ninformation of the quantum state, necessitating quantum state tomography, which\ncan be complex and resource-consuming. In this work, we utilize the\nsemi-supervised self-training model to estimate the steerable weight, a pivotal\nmeasure of quantum steering. The model can be trained using a limited amount of\nlabeled data, thus reducing the time for labeling. The features are constructed\nby the probabilities derived by performing three sets of projective\nmeasurements under arbitrary local unitary transformations on the target\nstates, circumventing the need for quantum tomography.

However, RS images pose unique challenges, including rich multi-scale\nfeatures and high inter-class similarity. To address these problems, this paper\nproposes a novel semi-supervised Multi-Scale Uncertainty and\nCross-Teacher-Student Attention (MUCA) model for RS image semantic segmentation\ntasks. Specifically, MUCA constrains the consistency among feature maps at\ndifferent layers of the network by introducing a multi-scale uncertainty\nconsistency regularization.

Additionally, MUCA utilizes a\nCross-Teacher-Student attention mechanism to guide the student network, guiding\nthe student network to construct more discriminative feature representations\nthrough complementary features from the teacher network. This design\neffectively integrates weak and strong augmentations (WA and SA) to further\nboost segmentation performance. To verify the effectiveness of our model, we\nconduct extensive experiments on ISPRS-Potsdam and LoveDA datasets.

In this study, we propose Generative Error Correction via\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (GEC-RAG), a novel approach designed to improve\nASR accuracy for low-resource domains, like Persian. Our approach treats the\nASR system as a black-box, a common practice in cloud-based services, and\nproposes a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach within the In-Context\nLearning (ICL) scheme to enhance the quality of ASR predictions. By\nconstructing a knowledge base that pairs ASR predictions (1-best and 5-best\nhypotheses) with their corresponding ground truths, GEC-RAG retrieves lexically\nsimilar examples to the ASR transcription using the Term Frequency-Inverse\nDocument Frequency (TF-IDF) measure. This process provides relevant error\npatterns of the system alongside the ASR transcription to the Generative Large\nLanguage Model (LLM), enabling targeted corrections. Our results demonstrate\nthat this strategy significantly reduces WER in Persian and highlights a\npotential for domain adaptation and low-resource scenarios.

Yet, due to challenges like limited data availability, subtle\nparenchymal changes, and the irregular timing of medical screenings, current\napproaches have so far focused on cross-sectional imaging data. To address\nthis, we propose HCCNet, a novel model architecture that integrates a 3D\nadaptation of the ConvNeXt CNN architecture with a Transformer encoder,\ncapturing both the intricate spatial features of 3D MRIs and the complex\ntemporal dependencies across different time points. HCCNet utilizes a two-stage\npre-training process tailored for longitudinal MRI data.

We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of HCCNet by applying it to a cohort of liver\ncirrhosis patients undergoing regular MRI screenings for HCC surveillance. Our\nresults show that HCCNet significantly improves predictive accuracy and\nreliability over baseline models, providing a robust tool for personalized HCC\nsurveillance. The methodological approach presented in this paper is versatile\nand can be adapted to various longitudinal MRI screening applications.

To emphasize that the problem is not specific to a\nspecific discipline we will use the neutral term coarsened observation. For\nsingle-equation models estimation of the latent linear model by Maximum\nLikelihood (ML) is routine. But, for higher -dimensional multivariate models it\nis computationally cumbersome as estimation requires the evaluation of\nmultivariate normal distribution functions on a large scale. Our proposed\nalternative estimation method, based on the Generalized Method of Moments\n(GMM), circumvents this multivariate integration problem. The method is based\non the assumed zero correlations between explanatory variables and generalized\nresiduals. This is more general than ML but coincides with ML if the error\ndistribution is multivariate normal. It can be implemented by repeated\napplication of standard techniques. GMM provides a simpler and faster approach\nthan the usual ML approach. It is applicable to multiple -equation models with\n-dimensional error correlation matrices and response categories for the\nequation. It also yields a simple method to estimate polyserial and polychoric\ncorrelations.

    "abstract": "In this study, the Density of States (DOS) of CeO$_2$ was analyzed in detail\nusing the Density Functional Theory (DFT) method based on VASP software. As an\nimportant functional material, CeO$_2$ finds wide applications in catalysis,\noptics, and electronic devices. Through structural optimization,\nself-consistent electronic calculations, and non-self-consistent calculations,\nwe thoroughly investigated the crystal structure and electronic energy level\ndistribution of CeO$_2$. The lattice parameter optimization results from the\nstructural calculations indicated a stable crystal structure for CeO$_2$.\nSelf-consistent electronic calculations revealed a bandgap of approximately\n2.403 eV, with the valence band maximum primarily contributed by O 2p orbitals\nand the conduction band minimum mainly originating from Ce 4f orbitals.\nNon-self-consistent calculations further demonstrated the total DOS and partial\nDOS of CeO$_2$, confirming the significant roles of Ce 4f and O 2p states in\nits electronic conduction and optical properties. These results not only\nprovide theoretical support for the applications of CeO$_2$ in catalysis and\nelectronic materials but also deepen our understanding of its fundamental\nelectronic structural characteristics, offering guidance for the design and\ndevelopment of novel CeO$_2$-based materials.",

In systems using (3), rather than directly accessing the shared resources\nupon arrival, a customer is considerate and waits to access them until nearby\nusers in service have left. This new model can be seen as a missing piece of a\nlarger puzzle that contains such dynamics as spatial birth-and-death processes,\nthe Poisson-Hail model, and wireless dynamics as key other pieces. It is shown\nthat, under natural assumptions, this model can be represented as a Markov\nprocess on the space of counting measures. The main results are then two-fold.\nThe first is on the shape of the stability region and, more precisely, on the\ncharacterization of the critical value of the arrival rate that separates\nstability from instability. The second is of a more qualitative or perhaps even\nethical nature. There is evidence that for natural values of the system\nparameters, the implementation of sensing and collision avoidance stabilizes a\nsystem that would be unstable if immediate access to the shared resources would\nbe granted.

    "abstract": "Spatial navigation is a complex cognitive function involving sensory inputs,\nsuch as visual, auditory, and proprioceptive information, to understand and\nmove within space. This ability allows humans to create mental maps, navigate\nthrough environments, and process directional cues, crucial for exploring new\nplaces and finding one's way in unfamiliar surroundings. This study takes an\nalgorithmic approach to extract indices relevant to human spatial navigation\nusing eye movement data. Leveraging electrooculography signals, we analyzed\nstatistical features and applied feature engineering techniques to study eye\nmovements during navigation tasks. The proposed work combines signal processing\nand machine learning approaches to develop indices for navigation and\norientation, spatial anxiety, landmark recognition, path survey, and path\nroute. The analysis yielded five subscore indices with notable accuracy. Among\nthese, the navigation and orientation subscore achieved an R2 score of 0.72,\nwhile the landmark recognition subscore attained an R2 score of 0.50.\nAdditionally, statistical features highly correlated with eye movement metrics,\nincluding blinks, saccades, and fixations, were identified. The findings of\nthis study can lead to more cognitive assessments and enable early detection of\nspatial navigation impairments, particularly among individuals at risk of\ncognitive decline.",

However, the large number of\nantennas significantly increases the computational complexity in precoding\ndesign, even for linearly regularized zero-forcing (RZF) precoding. To address\nthis issue, a series of low-complexity iterative precoding are investigated.\nThe main idea of these methods is to avoid matrix inversion of RZF precoding.\nSpecifically, RZF precoding is equivalent to a system of linear equations that\ncan be solved by fast iterative algorithms, such as random Kaczmarz (RK)\nalgorithm. Yet, the performance of RK-based precoding algorithm is limited by\nthe energy distributions of multiple users, which restricts its application in\nELAA-assisted systems. To accelerate the RK-based precoding, we introduce the\ngreedy random Kaczmarz (GRK)-based precoding by using the greedy\ncriterion-based selection strategy. To further reduce the complexity of the\nGRK-based precoding, we propose a visibility region (VR)-based orthogonal GRK\n(VR-OGRK) precoding that leverages near-field spatial non-stationarity, which\nis characterized by the concept of VR. Next, by utilizing the information from\nmultiple hyperplanes in each iteration, we extend the GRK-based precoding to\nthe aggregation hyperplane Kaczmarz (AHK)-based pecoding algorithm, which\nfurther enhances the convergence rate. Building upon the AHK algorithm, we\npropose a VR-based orthogonal AHK (VR-OAHK) precoding to further reduce the\ncomputational complexity. Furthermore, the proposed iterative precoding\nalgorithms are proven to converge to RZF globally at an exponential rate.\nSimulation results show that the proposed algorithms achieve faster convergence\nand lower computational complexity than benchmark algorithms, and yield very\nsimilar performance to the RZF precoding.",

SkyByte also employs optimization techniques that include\nadaptive page migration for exploring the performance benefits of fast host\nmemory by promoting hot pages in CXL-SSD to the host. We implement SkyByte with\na CXL-SSD simulator and evaluate its efficiency with various data-intensive\napplications. Our experiments show that SkyByte outperforms current CXL-based\nSSD by 6.11X, and reduces the I/O traffic to flash chips by 23.08X on average.\nSkyByte also reaches 75% of the performance of the ideal case that assumes\nunlimited DRAM capacity in the host, which offers an attractive cost-effective\nsolution.",

We\ndemonstrated field-free current-induced magnetization switching (CIMS) in the\nbilayer structure, regardless of the charge current directions with respect to\nthe mirror symmetry lines of Cr2N crystal. This is a specific characteristic\nfor the 2D MXene-based SOT-devices, originating from an unconventional\nout-of-plane SOT. As the SOT efficiency increases with increasing the Cr2N\nthickness, the first-principles calculations predict an intrinsic orbital-Hall\nconductivity with the dominant out-of-plane component, comparing to the\nspin-Hall conductivity in the Cr2N. X-ray magnetic circular dichroism reveals\nthe out-of-plane uncompensated magnetic moment of Cr in the Cr2N layer at the\ninterface, induced by contact with the Co in the [Co/Pt]3 ferromagnetic layer.\nTherefore, the intrinsic bulk orbital Hall effect in MXene and the interfacial\ncontribution such as spin-filtering-like effect owing to uncompensated magnetic\nmoment of Cr are considered as possible major mechanisms for the unconventional\nout-of-plane SOT in the device, rather than a crystal symmetry and/or an\ninterlayer exchange coupling.",

The quasi-bolometric\nluminosities of the objects were calculated from the ZTF g- and r-band data\nusing the methodology of \\citet{chen23b}, and then they were modeled with the\nMinim code. It was found that the light curves of 45 SLSNe-I can be fitted\nequally well with both the magnetar and the CSM models, 14 objects prefer the\nmagnetar model and 39 SLSNe-I favor the CSM model. The magnetar modeling\nyielded a mean spin period of $P~=~4.1 \\pm 0.20$ ms and a magnetic field of\n$B~=~5.65 \\pm 0.43 \\cdot 10^{14}$ G, consistently with the literature.

Recent investigations have explored the\ndenoising potential of diffusion models in semantic communications. However, in\nprevious paradigms, noise distortion in the diffusion process does not match\nprecisely with digital channel noise characteristics. In this work, we\nintroduce the Score-Based Channel Denoising Model (SCDM) for Digital Semantic\nCommunications (DSC). SCDM views the distortion of constellation symbol\nsequences in digital transmission as a score-based forward diffusion process.\nWe design a tailored forward noise corruption to align digital channel noise\nproperties in the training phase. During the inference stage, the well-trained\nSCDM can effectively denoise received semantic symbols under various SNR\nconditions, reducing the difficulty for the semantic decoder in extracting\nsemantic information from the received noisy symbols and thereby enhancing the\nrobustness of the reconstructed semantic information. Experimental results show\nthat SCDM outperforms the baseline model in PSNR, SSIM, and MSE metrics,\nparticularly at low SNR levels. Moreover, SCDM reduces storage requirements by\na factor of 7.8. This efficiency in storage, combined with its robust denoising\ncapability, makes SCDM a practical solution for DSC across diverse channel\nconditions.",

We further discover that the weights share the i.i.d. properties of\nGaussian noise, and explore their direct relationship. We find that\ntransformation weights can be derived from Gaussian noise, and they primarily\nserve to increase the standard deviation of pre-trained weights, with their\nstandard deviation growing with layer depth. In other words, transformation\nweights broaden the acceptable deviation from the optimal weights, facilitating\nadaptation to downstream tasks. Building upon the above conclusions, we\nthoroughly discussed the nature of optimal weights, ultimately concluding that\nthey should exhibit zero-mean, symmetry, and sparsity, with the sparse values\nbeing a truncated Gaussian distribution and a few outliers.

    "abstract": "Enriching information of spectrum coverage, radiomap plays an important role\nin many wireless communication applications, such as resource allocation and\nnetwork optimization. To enable real-time, distributed spectrum management,\nparticularly in the scenarios with unstable and dynamic environments, the\nefficient transmission of spectrum coverage information for radiomaps from edge\ndevices to the central server emerges as a critical problem. In this work, we\npropose an innovative physics-enhanced semantic communication framework\ntailored for efficient radiomap transmission based on generative learning\nmodels. Specifically, instead of bit-wise message passing, we only transmit the\nkey \"semantics\" in radiomaps characterized by the radio propagation behavior\nand surrounding environments, where semantic compression schemes are utilized\nto reduce the communication overhead. Incorporating the novel concepts of Radio\nDepth Maps, the radiomaps are reconstructed from the delivered semantic\ninformation backboned on the conditional generative adversarial networks. Our\nframework is further extended to facilitate its implementation in the scenarios\nof multi-user edge computing, by integrating with federated learning for\ncollaborative model training while preserving the data privacy. Experimental\nresults show that our approach achieves high accuracy in radio coverage\ninformation recovery at ultra-high bandwidth efficiency, which has great\npotentials in many wireless-generated data transmission applications.",

We find a pair of chiral phonons with\ngiant energy splitting reaching 20% of the phonon frequency, due to\nspontaneously broken time-reversal symmetry. With a moderate magnetic field,\nthe phonon angular momentum of the two chiral phonon branches can be switched\nalong with the magnetization.

    "abstract": "Cognitive diagnosis aims to infer students' mastery levels based on their\nhistorical response logs. However, existing cognitive diagnosis models (CDMs),\nwhich rely on ID embeddings, often have to train specific models on specific\ndomains. This limitation may hinder their directly practical application in\nvarious target domains, such as different subjects (e.g., Math, English and\nPhysics) or different education platforms (e.g., ASSISTments, Junyi Academy and\nKhan Academy). To address this issue, this paper proposes the language\nrepresentation favored zero-shot cross-domain cognitive diagnosis (LRCD).\nSpecifically, LRCD first analyzes the behavior patterns of students, exercises\nand concepts in different domains, and then describes the profiles of students,\nexercises and concepts using textual descriptions. Via recent advanced\ntext-embedding modules, these profiles can be transformed to vectors in the\nunified language space. Moreover, to address the discrepancy between the\nlanguage space and the cognitive diagnosis space, we propose language-cognitive\nmappers in LRCD to learn the mapping from the former to the latter. Then, these\nprofiles can be easily and efficiently integrated and trained with existing\nCDMs. Extensive experiments show that training LRCD on real-world datasets can\nachieve commendable zero-shot performance across different target domains, and\nin some cases, it can even achieve competitive performance with some classic\nCDMs trained on the full response data on target domains. Notably, we\nsurprisingly find that LRCD can also provide interesting insights into the\ndifferences between various subjects (such as humanities and sciences) and\nsources (such as primary and secondary education).",

Hallucinations in\nopen-ended long medical text manifest as misleading critical claims, which are\ndifficult to verify due to two reasons. First, critical claims are often deeply\nentangled within the text and cannot be extracted based solely on surface-level\npresentation. Second, verifying these claims is challenging because\nsurface-level token-based retrieval often lacks precise or specific evidence,\nleaving the claims unverifiable without deeper mechanism-based analysis. In\nthis paper, we introduce a novel method termed Iterative Tree Analysis (ITA)\nfor medical critics. ITA is designed to extract implicit claims from long\nmedical texts and verify each claim through an iterative and adaptive tree-like\nreasoning process. This process involves a combination of top-down task\ndecomposition and bottom-up evidence consolidation, enabling precise\nverification of complex medical claims through detailed mechanism-level\nreasoning. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that ITA significantly\noutperforms previous methods in detecting factual inaccuracies in complex\nmedical text verification tasks by 10%.

Understanding corrections to the adiabatic result that\narise when the evolution of the Hamiltonian is slow -- but not arbitrarily slow\n-- has become increasingly important, especially since adiabatic evolution has\nbeen proposed as a method of state preparation in quantum computing. This paper\nidentifies two regimes, an adiabatic regime in which corrections are\ngenerically small and can depend on details of the evolution throughout the\npath, and a hyperadiabatic regime in which the error is given by a form similar\nto an asymptotic expansion in the inverse of the evolution time with the\ncoefficients depending principally on the behavior at the endpoints. However,\nthe error in this hyperadiabatic regime is neither given by a true asymptotic\nseries nor solely dependent on the endpoints: the coefficients combine the\ncontributions from both endpoints, with relative phase factors that depend on\nthe average spectral gaps along the trajectory, multiplied by the evolution\ntime. The central result of this paper is to identify a quantity, referred to\nas the typical error, which is obtained by appropriately averaging the error\nover evolution times that are small compared to the evolution time itself. This\ntypical error is characterized by an asymptotic series and depends solely on\nthe endpoints of the evolution, remaining independent of the details of the\nintermediate evolution.",

    "abstract": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Vision Transformers (ViT) have\ndominated the field of Computer Vision (CV). Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have\nperformed remarkably well across diverse domains because they can represent\ncomplex relationships via unstructured graphs. However, the applicability of\nGNNs for visual tasks was unexplored till the introduction of Vision GNNs\n(ViG). Despite the success of ViGs, their performance is severely bottlenecked\ndue to the expensive $k$-Nearest Neighbors ($k$-NN) based graph construction.\nRecent works addressing this bottleneck impose constraints on the flexibility\nof GNNs to build unstructured graphs, undermining their core advantage while\nintroducing additional inefficiencies. To address these issues, in this paper,\nwe propose a novel method called Dynamic Efficient Graph Convolution (DEGC) for\ndesigning efficient and globally aware ViGs. DEGC partitions the input image\nand constructs graphs in parallel for each partition, improving graph\nconstruction efficiency. Further, DEGC integrates local intra-graph and global\ninter-graph feature learning, enabling enhanced global context awareness. Using\nDEGC as a building block, we propose a novel CNN-GNN architecture, ClusterViG,\nfor CV tasks. Extensive experiments indicate that ClusterViG reduces end-to-end\ninference latency for vision tasks by up to $5\\times$ when compared against a\nsuite of models such as ViG, ViHGNN, PVG, and GreedyViG, with a similar model\nparameter count. Additionally, ClusterViG reaches state-of-the-art performance\non image classification, object detection, and instance segmentation tasks,\ndemonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed globally aware learning\nstrategy. Finally, input partitioning performed by DEGC enables ClusterViG to\nbe trained efficiently on higher-resolution images, underscoring the\nscalability of our approach.",

Furthermore, while adversarial\ntraining-based defense methods have shown promise, a prevalent issue is the\nunintended over-defense behavior, wherein models excessively reject benign\nqueries, significantly undermining their practical utility. To address these\nlimitations, we introduce LATPC, a Latent-space Adversarial Training with\nPost-aware Calibration framework. LATPC dynamically identifies safety-critical\nlatent dimensions by contrasting harmful and benign inputs, enabling the\nadaptive construction of targeted refusal feature removal attacks. This\nmechanism allows adversarial training to concentrate on real-world jailbreak\ntactics that disguise harmful queries as benign ones. During inference, LATPC\nemploys an efficient embedding-level calibration mechanism to minimize\nover-defense behaviors with negligible computational overhead. Experimental\nresults across five types of disguise-based jailbreak attacks demonstrate that\nLATPC achieves a superior balance between safety and utility compared to\nexisting defense frameworks.

To address this issue, we propose a computation and\nmemory-efficient retrieval (CMER) framework for RSTIR. To reduce the training\nmemory consumption, we propose the Focus-Adapter module, which adopts a side\nbranch structure.

Simultaneously, to enhance data efficacy, we regard\nthe RS scene category as the metadata and design a concise augmentation\ntechnique. The scene label augmentation leverages the prior knowledge from land\ncover categories and shrinks the search space. We propose the negative sample\nrecycling strategy to make the negative sample pool decoupled from the\nmini-batch size. It improves the generalization performance without introducing\nadditional encoders. We have conducted quantitative and qualitative experiments\non public datasets and expanded the benchmark with some advanced approaches,\nwhich demonstrates the competitiveness of the proposed CMER.

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising tool for channel\nstate information (CSI) feedback. While recent research primarily focuses on\nimproving feedback accuracy on a specific dataset through novel architectures,\nthe underlying mechanism of AI-based CSI feedback remains unclear. This study\nexplores the mechanism through analyzing performance across diverse datasets,\nwith findings suggesting that superior feedback performance stems from AI\nmodels' strong fitting capabilities and their ability to leverage environmental\nknowledge. Building on these findings, we propose a prompt enabled large AI\nmodel (LAM) for CSI feedback. The LAM employs powerful transformer blocks and\nis trained on extensive datasets from various scenarios. Meanwhile, the channel\ndistribution (environmental knowledge) -- represented as the mean of channel\nmagnitude in the angular-delay domain -- is incorporated as a prompt within the\ndecoder to further enhance reconstruction quality. Simulation results confirm\nthat the proposed prompt-enabled LAM significantly improves feedback accuracy\nand generalization performance while reducing data collection requirements in\nnew scenarios.",

    "abstract": "The flexibility and complexity of IPv6 extension headers allow attackers to\ncreate covert channels or bypass security mechanisms, leading to potential data\nbreaches or system compromises. The mature development of machine learning has\nbecome the primary detection technology option used to mitigate covert\ncommunication threats. However, the complexity of detecting covert\ncommunication, evolving injection techniques, and scarcity of data make\nbuilding machine-learning models challenging. In previous related research,\nmachine learning has shown good performance in detecting covert communications,\nbut oversimplified attack scenario assumptions cannot represent the complexity\nof modern covert technologies and make it easier for machine learning models to\ndetect covert communications. To bridge this gap, in this study, we analyzed\nthe packet structure and network traffic behavior of IPv6, used encryption\nalgorithms, and performed covert communication injection without changing\nnetwork packet behavior to get closer to real attack scenarios. In addition to\nanalyzing and injecting methods for covert communications, this study also uses\ncomprehensive machine learning techniques to train the model proposed in this\nstudy to detect threats, including traditional decision trees such as random\nforests and gradient boosting, as well as complex neural network architectures\nsuch as CNNs and LSTMs, to achieve detection accuracy of over 90\\%. This study\ndetails the methods used for dataset augmentation and the comparative\nperformance of the applied models, reinforcing insights into the adaptability\nand resilience of the machine learning application in IPv6 covert\ncommunication.

This study uses discrete\nelement method simulations to investigate how elongated particle shapes affect\nthe mobility of dense granular flows down a rough incline. For a range of\nsystematically varied particle length-to-diameter aspect ratios (AR), we run\nsimulations with various flow thicknesses $h$ and slope angles $\\theta$ to\nextract the well-known $h_\\textrm{stop}(\\theta)$ curves (below which the flow\nceases) and the $Fr$-$h/h_\\textrm{stop}$ relations following Pouliquen's\napproach, where $Fr=u/\\sqrt{gh}$ is the Froude number, $u$ is the mean flow\nvelocity, and $g$ is the gravitational acceleration. The slope $\\beta$ of the\n$Fr$-$h/h_\\textrm{stop}$ relations shows an intriguing S-shaped dependence on\nAR, with two plateaus at small and large AR, respectively, transitioning with a\nsharp increase. We understand this S-shaped dependence by examining statistics\nof particle orientation, alignment, and hindered rotation. We find that the\nrotation ability of weakly elongated particles ($\\textrm{AR}\\lesssim1.3$)\nremains similar to spheres, leading to the first plateau in the $\\beta$-AR\nrelation, whereas the effects of particle orientation saturates beyond\n$\\textrm{AR}\\approx2.0$, explaining the second plateau. An empirical sigmoidal\nfunction is proposed to capture this non-linear dependence.

Solutions of the crucial nonlinear differential equation\ndepend on used mathematical procedures. Two of them, continuum and\nsemi-discrete approximations, are explained. Finally, these solutions are shown\nand discussed. They are solitonic waves. Three different kinds of them are\nknown in the moment. They are kink solitons, breathers and bell-type solitons.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents the photometric and spectroscopic analysis of a\nlong-period totally eclipsing contact binary (HAT 307-0007476) for the first\ntime. This system is a low mass ratio ($q\\sim0.114$) and medium contact binary\n($f\\sim37.1\\%$). Two flare events were detected in multiple bands observations\nin December 2022. The interval between the two flare events is 4 days. The\naverage duration of these two flares is about 2289s. Both the two flares\nachieve the energy levels of superflares. The excess emission of the H$_\\alpha$\nline in the LAMOST spectra of this object was analyzed, indicating its\nchromospheric activity. The $O-C$ diagram showed a long-term orbital period\nincrease, which is due to the mass transfer between the two component stars. We\nconclude that HAT 307-0007476 is currently in a stable region based on both\n$J_{spin}/J_{orb}$ and the comparison between the instability parameters and\nits current values.",

    "abstract": "End-to-end blockchain latency has become a critical topic of interest in both\nacademia and industry. However, while modern blockchain systems process\ntransactions through multiple stages, most research has primarily focused on\noptimizing the latency of the Byzantine Fault Tolerance consensus component.\n  In this work, we identify key sources of latency in blockchain systems and\nintroduce Zaptos, a parallel pipelined architecture designed to minimize\nend-to-end latency while maintaining the high-throughput of pipelined\nblockchains.\n  We implemented Zaptos and evaluated it against the pipelined architecture of\nthe Aptos blockchain in a geo-distributed environment. Our evaluation\ndemonstrates a 25\\% latency reduction under low load and over 40\\% reduction\nunder high load. Notably, Zaptos achieves a throughput of 20,000 transactions\nper second with sub-second latency, surpassing previously reported blockchain\nthroughput, with sub-second latency, by an order of magnitude.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the coexistence of two competing species on random\ngeometric graphs (RGGs) in continuous time. The species grow by occupying\nvacant sites according to Richardson's model, while simultaneously competing\nfor occupied sites under the dynamics of the voter model. Coexistence is\ndefined as the event in which both species occupy at least one site\nsimultaneously at any given time. We prove that coexistence occurs with\nstrictly positive annealed probability by applying results from moderate\ndeviations in first-passage percolation and random walk theory, with a focus on\nspecific regions of the space.",
