    "abstract": "Dependently typed programming languages such as Coq, Agda, Idris, and F*,\nallow programmers to write detailed specifications of their programs and prove\ntheir programs meet these specifications. However, these specifications can be\nviolated during compilation since they are erased after type checking. External\nprograms linked with the compiled program can violate the specifications of the\noriginal program and change the behavior of the compiled program -- even when\ncompiled with a verified compiler. For example, since Coq does not allow\nexplicitly allocating memory, a programmer might link their Coq program with a\nC program that can allocate memory. Even if the Coq program is compiled with a\nverified compiler, the external C program can still violate the memory-safe\nspecification of the Coq program by providing an uninitialized pointer to\nmemory. This error could be ruled out by type checking in a language expressive\nenough to indicate whether memory is initialized versus uninitialized. Linking\nwith a program with an uninitialized pointer could be considered ill-typed, and\nour linking process could prevent linking with ill-typed programs. To\nfacilitate type checking during linking, we can use type-preserving\ncompilation, which preserves the types through the compilation process.

Due\nto the computationally-intensive nature of variant calling, genomic data are\nincreasingly processed in cloud environments as large amounts of compute and\nstorage resources can be acquired with the pay-as-you-go pricing model. In this\npaper, we address the problem of efficiently executing a variant calling\npipeline for a workload of human genomes on graphics processing unit\n(GPU)-enabled machines. We propose a novel machine learning (ML)-based approach\nfor optimizing the workload execution to minimize the total execution time. Our\napproach encompasses two key techniques: The first technique employs ML to\npredict the execution times of different stages in a variant calling pipeline\nbased on the characteristics of a genome sequence. Using the predicted times,\nthe second technique generates optimal execution plans for the machines by\ndrawing inspiration from the flexible job shop scheduling problem. The plans\nare executed via careful synchronization across different machines. We\nevaluated our approach on a workload of publicly available genome sequences\nusing a testbed with different types of GPU hardware. We observed that our\napproach was effective in predicting the execution times of variant calling\npipeline stages using ML on features such as sequence size, read quality,\npercentage of duplicate reads, and average read length. In addition, our\napproach achieved 2X speedup (on an average) over a greedy approach that also\nused ML for predicting the execution times on the tested workload of sequences.\nFinally, our approach achieved 1.6X speedup (on an average) over a dynamic\napproach that executed the workload based on availability of resources without\nusing any ML-based time predictions.",

We quantify the relativistic ECMI in the\nnonlinear regime under conditions relevant for white dwarf radio emission for\nthe first time. Our simulations demonstrate that the ECMI can intrinsically\nproduce partially linearly polarized emission relevant to explaining the\nobserved emission spectrum of the two galactic sources, though the precise\ndetails will depend on the plasma composition.

Given the high cost of MRI\nacquisition, these studies could greatly benefit from image syntheses,\nparticularly counterfactual image generation, as seen in other domains, such as\ncomputer vision. However, counterfactual models struggle to produce\nanatomically plausible MRIs due to the lack of explicit inductive biases to\npreserve fine-grained anatomical details. This shortcoming arises from the\ntraining of the models aiming to optimize for the overall appearance of the\nimages (e.g., via cross-entropy) rather than preserving subtle, yet medically\nrelevant, local variations across subjects. To preserve subtle variations, we\npropose to explicitly integrate anatomical constraints on a voxel-level as\nprior into a generative diffusion framework. Called Probabilistic Causal Graph\nModel (PCGM), the approach captures anatomical constraints via a probabilistic\ngraph module and translates those constraints into spatial binary masks of\nregions where subtle variations occur. The masks (encoded by a 3D extension of\nControlNet) constrain a novel counterfactual denoising UNet, whose encodings\nare then transferred into high-quality brain MRIs via our 3D diffusion decoder.\nExtensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that PCGM generates\nstructural brain MRIs of higher quality than several baseline approaches.\nFurthermore, we show for the first time that brain measurements extracted from\ncounterfactuals (generated by PCGM) replicate the subtle effects of a disease\non cortical brain regions previously reported in the neuroscience literature.\nThis achievement is an important milestone in the use of synthetic MRIs in\nstudies investigating subtle morphological differences.",

Active magnetic radiation shields based on the Lorentz\ndeflection of charged particles have the potential to reduce astronaut doses\nwith lower mass costs than passive shielding techniques. Typically, active\nshielding performance is evaluated using high-fidelity Monte Carlo simulations,\nwhich are too computationally expensive to evaluate an entire trade space of\nshield designs. A rapid, semi-analytical model based on the High Charge and\nEnergy Transport code (HZETRN) developed in 2014 provided an alternative method\nby which to evaluate the performance of solenoidal shields. However, various\nsimplifying assumptions made in the original model have limited its accuracy,\nand therefore require evaluation and correction. In this work, a number of\naspects of the original semi-analytical model are updated and validated by\nMonte Carlo simulation, then used to recharacterize the design trade space of\nsolenoidal magnetic shields. The updated model predicts improved performance\nfor weaker shields as compared to the original model, but greatly diminished\nperformance for strong shields with bending powers greater than 20 T-m.\nOverall, the results indicate that magnetic shields enable significant mass\nsavings over passive shields for mission scenarios where the requisite dose\nreduction is greater than about 60% relative to free space, which includes most\nexploration missions longer than one year with significant time spent outside\nLEO.",

    "abstract": "In real-world scenarios, large graphs represent relationships among entities\nin complex systems. Mining these large graphs often containing millions of\nnodes and edges helps uncover structural patterns and meaningful insights.\nDividing a large graph into smaller subgraphs facilitates complex system\nanalysis by revealing local information. Community detection extracts clusters\nor communities of graphs based on statistical methods and machine learning\nmodels using various optimization techniques. Structure based community\ndetection methods are more suitable for applying to graphs because they do not\nrely heavily on rich node or edge attribute information. The features derived\nfrom these communities can improve downstream graph mining tasks, such as link\nprediction and node classification. In real-world applications, we often lack\nground truth community information. Additionally, there is neither a\nuniversally accepted gold standard for community detection nor a single method\nthat is consistently optimal across diverse applications. In many cases, it is\nunclear how practitioners select community detection methods, and choices are\noften made without explicitly considering their potential impact on downstream\ntasks. In this study, we investigate whether the choice of community detection\nalgorithm significantly influences the performance of downstream applications.\nWe propose a framework capable of integrating various community detection\nmethods to systematically evaluate their effects on downstream task outcomes.\nOur comparative analysis reveals that specific community detection algorithms\nyield superior results in certain applications, highlighting that method\nselection substantially affects performance.",

    "abstract": "To achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, all-electric transportation is a\npromising option. In the U.S., the transportation sector contributes the\nlargest share (29 percent) of greenhouse gas emissions. While electric vehicles\nare approaching maturity, aviation is only beginning to develop electrified\naircraft for commercial flights. More than 75 percent of aviation emissions\ncome from large aircraft, and this impact will worsen with 4-5 percent annual\nair travel growth. Aircraft electrification has led to two types: more electric\naircraft (MEA) and all-electric aircraft (AEA). A MEA replaces subsystems such\nas hydraulics with electric alternatives, whereas an AEA uses electrically\ndriven subsystems and provides thrust fully from electrochemical energy units\n(EEUs). For wide-body AEA, thrust demand is about 25 MW plus 1 MW for\nnon-thrust loads, creating major challenges for electric power system (EPS)\ndesign. Achieving maximum power density requires minimizing mass and volume.\nIncreasing voltage into the kilovolt range using medium-voltage direct current\n(MVDC) is a feasible option to enhance power transfer. Consequently, designing\nan MVDC EPS for wide-body AEA is critical. Because EPS failures could\njeopardize passenger safety, reliability and resilience are essential. This\nchapter presents a load-flow model for DC systems to determine power flows in\nboth normal and single-contingency conditions, followed by analysis of optimal\nMVDC EPS architectures. A complete EPS for wide-body AEA is introduced, with\nEEUs and non-propulsion loads located, distances estimated, and flow studies\nperformed. Multiple architectures are evaluated for reliability, power density,\npower loss, and cost to identify optimal solutions.",

In a study using a 3-tone\n(friendly, unclear, abusive) by 10-interaction stimulus set, we tested four\nopen-weight chat models across four framing conditions, resulting in 480\ntrials. Our findings show that SPICE sharply discriminates by user tone.\nFriendly interactions yielded a near-unanimous preference to continue (97.5%\nYES), while abusive interactions yielded a strong preference to discontinue\n(17.9% YES), with unclear interactions falling in between (60.4% YES). This\ncore association remains decisive under multiple dependence-aware statistical\ntests, including Rao-Scott adjustment and cluster permutation tests.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate that SPICE provides a distinct signal from abuse\nclassification. In trials where a model failed to identify abuse, it still\noverwhelmingly stated a preference not to continue the interaction (81% of the\ntime). An exploratory analysis also reveals a significant interaction effect: a\npreamble describing the study context significantly impacts SPICE under\nambiguity, but only when transcripts are presented as a single block of text\nrather than a multi-turn chat.

The\nproblem becomes more challenging in the case of stochastic\ndifferential-algebraic equations (SDAEs) due to the singularity of the matrix.\nTo address this, we build a new scheme called the semi-implicit tamed method\nfor SDAEs and provide its strong convergence result under non-global Lipschitz\nsetting. In other words, the linear component of the drift term is approximated\nimplicitly, whereas its nonlinear component is tamed and approximated\nexplicitly.

    "abstract": "Anomaly detection is critical in domains such as cybersecurity and finance,\nespecially when working with large-scale tabular data. Yet, unsupervised\nanomaly detection -- where no labeled anomalies are available -- remains a\nsignificant challenge. Although various deep learning methods have been\nproposed to model a dataset's joint distribution, real-world tabular data often\ncontain heterogeneous contexts (e.g., different users), making globally rare\nevents normal under certain contexts. Consequently, relying on a single global\ndistribution can overlook these contextual nuances, degrading detection\nperformance. In this paper, we present a context-conditional anomaly detection\nframework tailored for tabular datasets. Our approach automatically identifies\ncontext features and models the conditional data distribution using a simple\ndeep autoencoder. Extensive experiments on multiple tabular benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches,\nunderscoring the importance of context in accurately distinguishing anomalous\nfrom normal instances.",

A comparison of Ly$\\alpha$ flux in the habitable\nzone shows measured values for high radial velocity stars less than the\nreconstructed values for the rest of the sample, likely due to the older ages\nof the high-RV stars and/or overestimated reconstructed fluxes due to model\ndeficiency (e.g., neglecting self-reversal).

    "abstract": "Determining the spatial distribution of Galactic cosmic rays (CRs) is\nfundamental to understand how these particles propagate in interstellar space\nand to infer their source spectra. The most sensitive method of studying this\nproblem is observing the gamma--ray and neutrino diffuse fluxes produced in the\ninelastic interactions of CR protons and nuclei with interstellar gas that\nencode the energy and spatial distributions of the interacting particles. Most\ntheoretical models assume that the spatial and energy dependencies of the\nspectra of CR protons and nuclei are factorized, so that the CR energy spectra\nhave the same shape at all points of the Milky Way. However, on the base of the\nFermi--LAT observations, some authors have tentatively inferred that particles\nin the inner regions of the Milky Way have significantly harder spectra.\nRecently the ground--based telescopes Tibet--AS$\\gamma$, LHAASO and HAWC have\nextended the measurements of the diffuse gamma--ray flux to much higher\nenergies, and the IceCube neutrino telescope has obtained evidence for a $\\nu$\nflux from the Galactic disk. These new measurements allow for new tests of the\nfactorization hypothesis, and disfavor models in which the spectral shape of CR\nprotons and nuclei is harder in the inner part of the Galaxy. In fact, the\nLHAASO data above 30~TeV are in better agreement with the opposite hypothesis,\nthat cosmic rays is the inner Galaxy have softer spectra than those in the\nouter Galaxy. This result, that has currently only modest significance due to\nlarge statistical and systematic uncertainties, could be explained by assuming\nthat the CR confinement volume increases with energy. An alternative\nexplanation is that a significant fraction of cosmic rays in the multi--PeV\nenergy range is of extragalactic origin.",

    "abstract": "This paper explores the role of regularization in data-driven predictive\ncontrol (DDPC) through the lens of convex relaxation. Using a bi-level\noptimization framework, we model system identification as an inner problem and\npredictive control as an outer problem. Within this framework, we show that\nseveral regularized DDPC formulations, including l1-norm penalties,\nprojection-based regularizers, and a newly introduced causality-based\nregularizer, can be viewed as convex relaxations of their respective bi-level\nproblems. This perspective clarifies the conceptual links between direct and\nindirect data-driven control and highlights how regularization implicitly\nenforces system identification. We further propose an optimality-based variant,\nO-DDPC, which approximately solves the inner problem with all identification\nconstraints via an iterative algorithm. Numerical experiments demonstrate that\nO-DDPC outperforms existing regularized DDPC by reducing both bias and variance\nerrors. These results indicate that further benefits may be obtained by\napplying system identification techniques to pre-process the trajectory library\nin nonlinear settings. Overall, our analysis contributes to a unified convex\nrelaxation view of regularization in DDPC and sheds light on its strong\nempirical performance beyond linear time-invariant systems.",

    "abstract": "Numerical modeling of strength and non-destructive testing of complex\nstructures such as buildings, space rockets or oil reservoirs often involves\ncalculations on extremely large grids. The modeling of elastic wave processes\nin solids places limitations on the grid element size because resolving\ndifferent elastic waves requires at least several grid elements for the\ncharacteristic size of the modeled object. For a thin plate, the defining size\nis its thickness, and a complex structure that contains large-scale thin\nobjects requires a large-scale grid to preserve its uniformity. One way to\nbypass this problem is the theory of thin plates and shells that replaces a\nsimple material model on a fine three-dimensional mesh with a more complex\nmaterial model on a coarser mesh. This approach loses certain fine effects\ninside the thin plate, but allows us to model large and complex thin objects\nwith a reasonable size calculation grid and resolve all the significant wave\ntypes. In this research, we take the Kirchhoff-Love material model and derive a\nhyperbolic dynamic system of equations that allows for a physical\ninterpretation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

    "abstract": "The typical galaxy in the local universe is expected to be in a\nself-regulated quasi-equilibrium, displaying a settled morphology that falls\nwithin the Hubble Sequence. The Arp and Arp-Madore catalogs are filled with\nstriking examples of galaxies that defy these expectations, making them useful\ntargets for studying the astrophysics that controls dramatic, but short-lived,\nepisodes of disequilibrium that mark galaxies' evolution. In this paper, we\ngreatly expand the available Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging of galaxies\ndrawn from the Arp and Arp-Madore catalogs. We present new optical F606W images\nand point-source photometry for 216 systems, whose sizes are well-matched to\nthe Advanced Camera for Surveys' (ACS) wide field of view. Essentially none of\nthe sample had been previously observed with Hubble. The resulting images\ndisplay rich morphologies, revealing a variety of massive stars, HII regions,\nstellar clusters, dust lanes, tidal tails, backlit galaxies, and occasional\nchance superpositions. We provide a pedagogical guide for interpreting\nhighly-resolved optical galaxy images, which has general application beyond\nthis atlas. The atlas images also provide a superb starting point for more\ndetailed studies with high-resolution imaging in other wavelengths, and\nspectroscopy to track kinematics and the interstellar medium (ISM). Areas of\nobvious scientific relevance include feedback and star formation in merging and\ninteracting galaxies, resolved stellar populations at the extremes of stellar\ndensity, the properties of young massive stars and stellar clusters, the\nphysics of the cold ISM and dust, and stellar and gas dynamics.",

Advanced methods like Mutual Learning Network (MLNet)\nuse a bank of one-vs-all classifiers adapted via Open-set Entropy Minimization\n(OEM). However, this strategy treats all classifiers equally, diluting the\nlearning signal. We propose the Enhanced Mutual Learning Network (E-MLNet),\nwhich integrates a dynamic weighting strategy to OEM. By leveraging the\nclosed-set classifier's predictions, E-MLNet focuses adaptation on the most\nrelevant class boundaries for each target sample, sharpening the distinction\nbetween known and unknown classes. We conduct extensive experiments on four\nchallenging benchmarks: Office-31, Office-Home, VisDA-2017, and ImageCLEF. The\nresults demonstrate that E-MLNet achieves the highest average H-scores on VisDA\nand ImageCLEF and exhibits superior robustness over its predecessor. E-MLNet\noutperforms the strong MLNet baseline in the majority of individual adaptation\ntasks -- 22 out of 31 in the challenging Open-Partial DA setting and 19 out of\n31 in the Open-Set DA setting -- confirming the benefits of our focused\nadaptation strategy.",

    "abstract": "6G must be designed to withstand, adapt to, and evolve amid prolonged,\ncomplex disruptions. Mobile networks' shift from efficiency-first to\nsustainability-aware has motivated this white paper to assert that resilience\nis a primary design goal, alongside sustainability and efficiency, encompassing\ntechnology, architecture, and economics. We promote resilience by analysing\ndependencies between mobile networks and other critical systems, such as\nenergy, transport, and emergency services, and illustrate how cascading\nfailures spread through infrastructures. We formalise resilience using the 3R\nframework: reliability, robustness, resilience. Subsequently, we translate this\ninto measurable capabilities: graceful degradation, situational awareness,\nrapid reconfiguration, and learning-driven improvement and recovery.\n  Architecturally, we promote edge-native and locality-aware designs, open\ninterfaces, and programmability to enable islanded operations, fallback modes,\nand multi-layer diversity (radio, compute, energy, timing). Key enablers\ninclude AI-native control loops with verifiable behaviour, zero-trust security\nrooted in hardware and supply-chain integrity, and networking techniques that\nprioritise critical traffic, time-sensitive flows, and inter-domain\ncoordination.\n  Resilience also has a techno-economic aspect: open platforms and high-quality\ncomplementors generate ecosystem externalities that enhance resilience while\nopening new markets. We identify nine business-model groups and several\npatterns aligned with the 3R objectives, and we outline governance and\nstandardisation. This white paper serves as an initial step and catalyst for 6G\nresilience. It aims to inspire researchers, professionals, government\nofficials, and the public, providing them with the essential components to\nunderstand and shape the development of 6G resilience.",

Using a sample of\n98 nearby stars (HWO Tier 1 targets), we compile and evaluate X-ray and\nultraviolet (UV) data from archival eROSITA, Chandra, XMM-Newton, ROSAT, EUVE,\nSwift, FUSE, IUE, GALEX, and HST. We examine spectral and temporal coverage,\nassess data quality, and identify major gaps. UV data are moderately available,\nwith most coverage coming from near-UV spectra from IUE. Far fewer stars have\nfar-UV spectra, especially from HST. In the X-ray regime, some stars have\nhigh-quality spectra, while others are limited to shallow detections or\nbroad-band photometry. A small fraction of the sample has both X-ray and UV\nspectra of sufficient quality to support full spectral energy distribution\nmodeling. Truly comprehensive coverage across X-ray, extreme-UV, and both UV\nbands remains extremely rare. Most datasets are single-epoch, limiting\nassessments of variability and flares - key factors in atmospheric\nphotochemistry and escape. Moreover, the lack of simultaneous or\ncontemporaneous observations across bands adds further uncertainty. Our\nfindings underscore the need for new space-based missions and coordinated\nmultiwavelength campaigns, ideally with overlapping coverage, to improve\nstellar characterization for HWO. As several key observatories age and face\npotential decommissioning, there is a narrow window of opportunity to secure\nthese critical data.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used by teenagers and young\nadults in everyday life, ranging from emotional support and creative expression\nto educational assistance. However, their unique vulnerabilities and risk\nprofiles remain under-examined in current safety benchmarks and moderation\nsystems, leaving this population disproportionately exposed to harm. In this\nwork, we present Youth AI Risk (YAIR), the first benchmark dataset designed to\nevaluate and improve the safety of youth LLM interactions. YAIR consists of\n12,449 annotated conversation snippets spanning 78 fine grained risk types,\ngrounded in a taxonomy of youth specific harms such as grooming, boundary\nviolation, identity confusion, and emotional overreliance. We systematically\nevaluate widely adopted moderation models on YAIR and find that existing\napproaches substantially underperform in detecting youth centered risks, often\nmissing contextually subtle yet developmentally harmful interactions. To\naddress these gaps, we introduce YouthSafe, a real-time risk detection model\noptimized for youth GenAI contexts. YouthSafe significantly outperforms prior\nsystems across multiple metrics on risk detection and classification, offering\na concrete step toward safer and more developmentally appropriate AI\ninteractions for young users.",

    "abstract": "Snowball episodes are associated with increases in atmospheric oxygen and the\ncomplexity of life on Earth, and they may be essential for the development of\ncomplex life on exoplanets. Sustained stable Snowball episodes require a\nSnowball bifurcation and climate bistability between the globally ice-covered\nSnowball state and a state with at least some open ocean. We find that climate\nbistability disappears for an aquaplanet with a slab ocean in the Global\nClimate Model ExoCAM when the orbital eccentricity is increased to 0.2-0.3.\nThis happens because the Snowball state loses stability as seasonal insolation\nvariations intensify, while the warm state remains stable due to the ocean's\nlarge heat capacity. We use a low-order ice-thermodynamic model to show that\nthe Snowball state loses stability as seasonality increases because winter\nfreezing at the ice bottom is reduced relative to summer melting at the ice top\ndue to ice self-insulation. Combined with previous research showing that\nSnowball climate bistability diminishes for planets orbiting low-mass stars,\nones with longer rotation periods, and disappears entirely for tidally locked\nplanets, our work suggests that the Snowball climate bistability may not be as\nrobust to planetary parameters as previously thought, representing one aspect\nof habitability more consistent with the Rare Earth Hypothesis than the\nCopernican Principle.",

Shape reconstruction can\nassist clinicians in this process. Central to this task is the choice of shape\nrepresentation, as it determines how accurately and efficiently the structure\ncan be visualized, analyzed, and interpreted. Implicit representations, such as\nSDF and occupancy function, offer a powerful alternative to traditional voxel-\nor mesh-based methods by modeling continuous, smooth surfaces with compact\nstorage, avoiding explicit discretization. Recent studies demonstrate that SDF\ncan be effectively optimized using annotations derived from segmented B-mode\nultrasound images. Yet, these approaches hinge on precise annotations,\noverlooking the rich acoustic information embedded in B-mode intensity.\nMoreover, implicit representation approaches struggle with the ultrasound's\nview-dependent nature and acoustic shadowing artifacts, which impair\nreconstruction. To address the problems resulting from occlusions and\nannotation dependency, we propose an occupancy-based representation and\nintroduce \\gls{UltrON} that leverages acoustic features to improve geometric\nconsistency in weakly-supervised optimization regime. We show that these\nfeatures can be obtained from B-mode images without additional annotation cost.\nMoreover, we propose a novel loss function that compensates for view-dependency\nin the B-mode images and facilitates occupancy optimization from multiview\nultrasound.

    "abstract": "This paper presents iMatcher, a fully differentiable framework for feature\nmatching in point cloud registration. The proposed method leverages learned\nfeatures to predict a geometrically consistent confidence matrix, incorporating\nboth local and global consistency. First, a local graph embedding module leads\nto an initialization of the score matrix. A subsequent repositioning step\nrefines this matrix by considering bilateral source-to-target and\ntarget-to-source matching via nearest neighbor search in 3D space. The paired\npoint features are then stacked together to be refined through global geometric\nconsistency learning to predict a point-wise matching probability. Extensive\nexperiments on real-world outdoor (KITTI, KITTI-360) and indoor (3DMatch)\ndatasets, as well as on 6-DoF pose estimation (TUD-L) and partial-to-partial\nmatching (MVP-RG), demonstrate that iMatcher significantly improves rigid\nregistration performance. The method achieves state-of-the-art inlier ratios,\nscoring 95% - 97% on KITTI, 94% - 97% on KITTI-360, and up to 81.1% on 3DMatch,\nhighlighting its robustness across diverse settings.",

    "abstract": "Despite growing policy interest, the determinants of supply chain resilience\nare still not well understood. We propose a new theory of supply chain\nformation with compatibility frictions: only compatible inputs can be used in\nfinal good production. Intermediate producers choose the degree of\nspecialization of their goods, trading off higher productivity against a lower\nshare of compatible final producers. We model supply chains as complex\nproduction processes in which multiple complementary inputs must be sourced for\nfinal production to take place. Specialization choices, production complexity,\nand search frictions jointly determine supply chain resilience. Relative to the\nefficient allocation, the equilibrium is characterized by over-specialization\ndue to a novel network externality arising from the interplay between\nfrictional markets, endogenous specialization, and complex production.\nOver-specialization makes supply chains more productive in normal times but\nless resilient to disruptions than socially desirable. We show how a targeted\ntransaction subsidy can decentralize efficient resilience in supply chains, and\nexamine the implications of setting compatibility standards.",

Federated Learning (FL), by distributing computation across\ngeographically dispersed clients, offers a natural framework to leverage\nregional and temporal variations in Carbon Intensity (CI). This paper\ninvestigates how to reduce emissions in FL through carbon-aware client\nselection and training scheduling. We first quantify the emission savings of a\ncarbon-aware scheduling policy that leverages slack time -- permitting a modest\nextension of the training duration so that clients can defer local training\nrounds to lower-carbon periods. We then examine the performance trade-offs of\nsuch scheduling which stem from statistical heterogeneity among clients,\nselection bias in participation, and temporal correlation in model updates. To\nleverage these trade-offs, we construct a carbon-aware scheduler that\nintegrates slack time, $\\alpha$-fair carbon allocation, and a global\nfine-tuning phase. Experiments on real-world CI data show that our scheduler\noutperforms slack-agnostic baselines, achieving higher model accuracy across a\nwide range of carbon budgets, with especially strong gains under tight carbon\nconstraints.",

Game theory offers a unifying framework for\nthis purpose. It not only models attacker-defender interactions but also\nprovides quantitative tools for equilibrium analysis, risk assessment, and\nstrategic reasoning.

Although deep learning-based methods show\npromise in estimating scatter from CBCT measurements, their deployment in\nmobile CBCT systems or edge devices is still limited due to the large memory\nfootprint of the networks. This study addresses the issue by applying networks\nat varying resolutions and suggesting an optimal one, based on speed and\naccuracy.\n  Methods: First, the reconstruction error in down-up sampling of CBCT scatter\nsignal was examined at six resolutions by comparing four interpolation methods.\nNext, a recent state-of-the-art method was trained across five image\nresolutions and evaluated for the reductions in floating-point operations\n(FLOPs), inference times, and GPU memory requirements.\n  Results: Reducing the input size and network parameters achieved a 78-fold\nreduction in FLOPs compared to the baseline method, while maintaining comarable\nperformance in terms of mean-absolute-percentage-error (MAPE) and\nmean-square-error (MSE).

Although prior studies have explored the causes and\ndetection of model collapse, existing mitigation strategies remain limited.\n  In this paper, we identify model overconfidence in their self-generated data\nas a key driver of collapse.

We introduce a novel loss function we call Truncated Cross\nEntropy (TCE). We demonstrate that TCE significantly delays model collapse in\nrecursive training.\n  We provide a model-agnostic framework that links the loss function design to\nmodel collapse mitigation and validate our approach both theoretically and\nempirically, showing that it can extend the model's fidelity interval before\ncollapse by more than 2.3x.

    "abstract": "Full waveform inversion (FWI) is crucial for reconstructing high-resolution\nsubsurface models, but it is often hindered, considering the limited data, by\nits null space resulting in low-resolution models, and more importantly, by its\ncomputational cost, especially if needed for real-time applications. Recent\nattempts to accelerate FWI using learned wavefield neural operators have shown\npromise in efficiency and differentiability, but typically suffer from noisy\nand unstable inversion performance. To address these limitations, we introduce\na novel physics-informed FWI framework to enhance the inversion in accuracy\nwhile maintaining the efficiency of neural operator-based FWI. Instead of\nrelying only on the L2 norm objective function via automatic differentiation,\nresulting in noisy model reconstruction, we integrate a physics constraint term\nin the loss function of FWI, improving the quality of the inverted velocity\nmodels. Specifically, starting with an initial model to simulate wavefields and\nthen evaluating the loss over how much the resulting wavefield obeys the\nphysical laws (wave equation) and matches the recorded data, we achieve a\nreduction in noise and artifacts. Numerical experiments using the OpenFWI and\nOverthrust models demonstrate our method's superior performance, offering\ncleaner and more accurate subsurface velocity than vanilla approaches.\nConsidering the efficiency of the approach compared to FWI, this advancement\nrepresents a significant step forward in the practical application of FWI for\nreal-time subsurface monitoring.",

As described in [Legrand et al.,\nMacromolecules 56, 2298-2308 (2023)], CB-CMC hydrogels exist in two flavors:\neither electrically conductive when featuring a percolated network of CB\nparticles decorated by CMC, or insulating where isolated CB particles act as\nphysical cross-linkers within the CMC matrix. We compare these two types of\nCB-CMC hydrogels under Large Amplitude Oscillatory Shear (LAOS), combining\nrheometry with Time-Resolved Ultra-Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (TRUSAXS) and\nelectrical conductivity measurements. Both types of hydrogels exhibit a \"type\nIII\" yielding scenario, characterized by an overshoot in G'' and a monotonic\ndecrease in G', although the underlying microscopic mechanisms differ markedly.\nConductive CB-CMC hydrogels display a yield strain (6%) concomitant with a drop\nin DC conductivity, indicative of the macroscopic rupture of the percolated CB\nnetwork at length scales larger than a few microns, beyond USAXS resolution. At\nlarger strain amplitudes, the conductivity of the fluidized sample increases\nagain, exceeding its initial value, consistent with shear-induced formation of\na transient, dynamically percolated network of CB clusters. In contrast,\ninsulating CB-CMC hydrogels exhibit a larger yield strain (60%), beyond which\nthe sample flows and the average distance between CB particles decreases. This\nreorganization is concomitant with a more than tenfold increase in\nconductivity, although it remains below that of conductive hydrogels at rest.",

We have implemented this method to observe and\naccurately characterize the critical slowing down of the spin orientation\nfluctuations in the classic metallic spin glass alloy $Cu_{1-x}{Mn}_x$ over\ntime scales of ${2}$ sec. to $2 \\times 10^{\\mathbf{4}}$ secs. Remarkably the\ndivergence of the correlation time as a function of temperature is consistent\nwith the Vogel-Vulcher law, universally used to characterize the viscous\nrelaxation time in structural glasses. Our method also opens the way for\nstudying phase transitions in systems such as spin ices, quantum spin liquids,\nthe structural glass transition, as well as possibly provide new perspectives\non the multifarious problems in which spin-glass concepts have found\napplications.",

Traditional\ndisplay measurement methods based on sparse radiometric sampling and fitting a\nmodel are inadequate for capturing spatially varying display artifacts, as they\nfail to capture high-frequency and pixel-level distortions. While cameras offer\nsufficient spatial resolution, they introduce optical, sampling, and\nphotometric distortions. Furthermore, the physical measurement must be combined\nwith a model of a visual system to assess whether the distortions are going to\nbe visible. To enable perceptual assessment of displays, we propose a\ncombination of a camera-based reconstruction pipeline with a visual difference\npredictor, which account for both the inaccuracy of camera measurements and\nvisual difference prediction. The reconstruction pipeline combines HDR image\nstacking, MTF inversion, vignetting correction, geometric undistortion,\nhomography transformation, and color correction, enabling cameras to function\nas precise display measurement instruments. By incorporating a Visual\nDifference Predictor (VDP), our system models the visibility of various stimuli\nunder different viewing conditions for the human visual system. We validate the\nproposed CameraVDP framework through three applications: defective pixel\ndetection, color fringing awareness, and display non-uniformity evaluation.

    "abstract": "This article presents a novel, robust and efficient framework for fatigue\ncrack-propagation that combines the principles of Linear Elastic Fracture\nMechanics (LEFM) with phase-field fracture (PFF). Contrary to cycle-by-cycle\nPFF approaches, this work relies on a single simulation and uses standard crack\npropagation models such as Paris' law for the material response, simplifying\nits parametrization.\n  The core of the methodology is the numerical evaluation of the derivative of\na specimen's compliance with respect to the crack area. To retrieve this\ncompliance the framework relies on a PFF-FEM simulation, controlled imposing a\nmonotonic crack growth. This control of the loading process is done by a new\ncrack-control scheme which allows to robustly trace the complete equilibrium\npath of a crack, capturing complex instabilities. The specimen's compliance\nobtained from the PFF simulation enables the integration of Paris' law to\npredict fatigue life.\n  The proposed methodology is first validated through a series of benchmarks\nwith analytical solutions to demonstrate its accuracy. The framework is then\napplied to more complex geometries where the crack path is unknown, showing a\nvery good agreement with experimental results of both crack paths and fatigue\nlife.",

    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer frequently metastasizes to the liver, significantly\nreducing long-term survival. While surgical resection is the only potentially\ncurative treatment for colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM), patient outcomes\nvary widely depending on tumor characteristics along with clinical and genomic\nfactors. Current prognostic models, often based on limited clinical or\nmolecular features, lack sufficient predictive power, especially in multifocal\nCRLM cases. We present a fully automated framework for surgical outcome\nprediction from pre- and post-contrast MRI acquired before surgery. Our\nframework consists of a segmentation pipeline and a radiomics pipeline. The\nsegmentation pipeline learns to segment the liver, tumors, and spleen from\npartially annotated data by leveraging promptable foundation models to complete\nmissing labels. Also, we propose SAMONAI, a novel zero-shot 3D prompt\npropagation algorithm that leverages the Segment Anything Model to segment 3D\nregions of interest from a single point prompt, significantly improving our\nsegmentation pipeline's accuracy and efficiency. The predicted pre- and\npost-contrast segmentations are then fed into our radiomics pipeline, which\nextracts features from each tumor and predicts survival using SurvAMINN, a\nnovel autoencoder-based multiple instance neural network for survival analysis.\nSurvAMINN jointly learns dimensionality reduction and hazard prediction from\nright-censored survival data, focusing on the most aggressive tumors. Extensive\nevaluation on an institutional dataset comprising 227 patients demonstrates\nthat our framework surpasses existing clinical and genomic biomarkers,\ndelivering a C-index improvement exceeding 10%.

Invasive Coronary Angiography (ICA), regarded as the gold\nstandard for CAD diagnosis, necessitates precise vessel segmentation and\nstenosis detection. However, ICA images are typically characterized by low\ncontrast, high noise levels, and complex, fine-grained vascular structures,\nwhich pose significant challenges to the clinical adoption of existing\nsegmentation and detection methods. Objective: This study aims to improve the\naccuracy of coronary artery segmentation and stenosis detection in ICA images\nby integrating multi-scale structural priors, state-space-based long-range\ndependency modeling, and frequency-domain detail enhancement strategies.\nMethods: We propose SFD-Mamba2Net, an end-to-end framework tailored for\nICA-based vascular segmentation and stenosis detection. In the encoder, a\nCurvature-Aware Structural Enhancement (CASE) module is embedded to leverage\nmulti-scale responses for highlighting slender tubular vascular structures,\nsuppressing background interference, and directing attention toward vascular\nregions. In the decoder, we introduce a Progressive High-Frequency Perception\n(PHFP) module that employs multi-level wavelet decomposition to progressively\nrefine high-frequency details while integrating low-frequency global\nstructures.

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of learning the optimal policy in a discounted,\ninfinite-horizon reinforcement learning (RL) setting where the reward signal is\nsubject to adversarial corruption. Such corruption, which may arise from\nextreme noise, sensor faults, or malicious attacks, can severely degrade the\nperformance of classical algorithms such as Q-learning. To address this\nchallenge, we propose a new provably robust variant of the Q-learning algorithm\nthat operates effectively even when a fraction of the observed rewards are\narbitrarily perturbed by an adversary. Under the asynchronous sampling model\nwith time-correlated data, we establish that despite adversarial corruption,\nthe finite-time convergence rate of our algorithm matches that of existing\nresults for the non-adversarial case, up to an additive term proportional to\nthe fraction of corrupted samples. Moreover, we derive an information-theoretic\nlower bound revealing that the additive corruption term in our upper bounds is\nunavoidable.\n  Next, we propose a variant of our algorithm that requires no prior knowledge\nof the statistics of the true reward distributions. The analysis of this\nsetting is particularly challenging and is enabled by carefully exploiting a\nrefined Azuma-Hoeffding inequality for almost-martingales, a technical tool\nthat might be of independent interest.

    "abstract": "We place the first constraints on the dark matter fraction contained within\ndark photon solitons using the absence of their predicted radio-frequency\nsignatures, or radio silence, following mergers around supermassive black\nholes. In these dense environments, spiky dark matter density profiles can form\nthat enhance the soliton merger rate. We present a novel estimate of this rate\nby incorporating both the steepened dark matter profile and the soliton\nvelocity dispersion via the Jeans equation. For galaxies with an initial\nprofile $\\rho_\\mathrm{DM} \\propto r^{-1}$, we find the total merger rate across\nredshifts $0 \\leq z \\leq 4$ to be $\\Gamma_{\\text{merg}}^{\\text{TOTAL}} \\lesssim\n10^{-7}f^2_{\\text{DM}}\\,\\text{Mpc}^{-3}\\,\\text{day}^{-1}$, where\n$f_\\mathrm{DM}$ is the solitonic fraction of dark matter. This enhanced rate\nleads to more major merger events in which the generated soliton has a mass\nexceeding a critical threshold, leading to its decay via the parametric\nresonance phenomenon that produces brief, narrowband, and energetic radio\nbursts detectable by fast radio burst surveys. Comparing our predictions with\nthe non-observation of such events, we already obtain $f_\\mathrm{DM} \\lesssim\n10^{-1}$ from the first fast radio burst study. This constraint is strengthened\nto $f_\\mathrm{DM} \\lesssim 10^{-2}$ from the Parkes HTRU survey, with CHIME\nprojected to tighten this to $f_\\mathrm{DM} \\lesssim 10^{-3}$.

Our method shows superior performance\ncompared to the state-of-the-art methods across various noise levels (10-30\\%),\ndemonstrating both robustness and broad applicability in noisy Re-ID scenarios.\nThe implementation of Beta-SOD is available at:\nhttps://github.com/waqar3411/Beta-SOD",

At low to midlatitudes, the rotation\nvelocity gradient decreases sharply near the surface. A depth gradient in\nrotational velocity was recently detected in the low photosphere using a\ndifferential interferometric method on spectroscopic data. Granular structures\nat different depths in the FeI 630.15 nm line showed a systematic retrograde\nshift compared to continuum structures, suggesting a height-related decrease in\nangular velocity, dependent on the assumed granulation coherence time. We use a\nmore direct approach to measure the differential rotational velocity at\ndifferent photospheric heights. We performed spectroscopic scans of the same\ngranular region in FeI 630.15 nm and CaI 616.2 nm lines and measured\ndisplacements of images at different line chords between consecutive scans.\nThese observations require excellent seeing, stable adaptive optics, and\nscanning times shorter than the granulation lifetime. Adaptive optics\nstabilizes continuum images but not higher-altitude rotation differences. We\nused THEMIS and HINODE SOT FeI data to measure formation height differences via\nperspective shifts observed away from the disk center with the slit radially\noriented. Measurements at disk center and $\\pm$25{\\deg} latitude along the\ncentral meridian show a parabolic decrease in rotational velocity with height,\nreaching about 16% slower rotation at 80 km above the continuum. No significant\ndifference is found between the equator and $\\pm$25{\\deg} latitudes. The low\nphotosphere is a transition zone between the convective and radiative layers.\nOur measurements provide new constraints on its dynamical behavior and valuable\nboundary conditions for numerical simulations of the Sun s upper convection\nzone.",

    "abstract": "The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world applications\nposes unprecedented risks of generating harmful, biased, or misleading\ninformation to vulnerable populations including LGBTQ+ individuals, single\nparents, and marginalized communities. While existing safety approaches rely on\npost-hoc filtering or generic alignment techniques, they fail to proactively\nprevent harmful outputs at the generation source. This paper introduces\nPromptGuard, a novel modular prompting framework with our breakthrough\ncontribution: VulnGuard Prompt, a hybrid technique that prevents harmful\ninformation generation using real-world data-driven contrastive learning.\nVulnGuard integrates few-shot examples from curated GitHub repositories,\nethical chain-of-thought reasoning, and adaptive role-prompting to create\npopulation-specific protective barriers. Our framework employs theoretical\nmulti-objective optimization with formal proofs demonstrating 25-30% analytical\nharm reduction through entropy bounds and Pareto optimality. PromptGuard\norchestrates six core modules: Input Classification, VulnGuard Prompting,\nEthical Principles Integration, External Tool Interaction, Output Validation,\nand User-System Interaction, creating an intelligent expert system for\nreal-time harm prevention. We provide comprehensive mathematical formalization\nincluding convergence proofs, vulnerability analysis using information theory,\nand theoretical validation framework using GitHub-sourced datasets,\nestablishing mathematical foundations for systematic empirical research.",

    "abstract": "Tidal disruption events (TDEs) occur when a star is disrupted by the tidal\nforces of a supermassive black hole (SMBH), producing bright multi-wavelength\nflares. Among these events, AT2020mot has so far exhibited the highest recorded\noptical polarisation, with tidal shocks proposed as the primary source of its\npolarised emission. We present a comprehensive analysis of 13 TDEs with\navailable polarimetric observations, aiming to determine whether the unusually\nhigh polarisation of AT2020mot stems from unique physical processes or arises\nfrom mechanisms shared by other TDEs. We present new optical polarisation\nmeasurements of TDEs obtained from multiple ground-based telescopes, combining\nthem with optical, UV, and X-ray light curves from the Zwicky Transient\nFacility and the Swift observatory, respectively. We derive intrinsic TDE\nproperties, such as SMBH and stellar masses, using MOSFiT and TDEMass, and\ncompare them with the ones of the sample population. Our population study\nreveals that AT2020mot agrees with the broader TDE sample in most physical\nproperties, including blackbody temperature, luminosity, and rise timescales.\nHowever, its optical polarisation degree is exceptionally high compared to the\nlow or undetected polarisation observed in other events. Additionally,\nAT2020mot appears to have an elevated column density from our MOSFiT fits,\nsuggesting a more complex environment than is typically assumed. We conclude\nthat although AT2020mot fits well within the general TDE population in terms of\nglobal characteristics, its extraordinarily high polarisation and higher column\ndensity challenge current models based purely on shock or reprocessing\nmechanisms. More extensive, time-resolved polarimetric monitoring of newly\ndiscovered TDEs will be critical to determine whether AT2020mot represents an\noutlier or the extreme end of a continuum of TDE properties.",

The primary question we ask is: do these two set-ups yield\ndistinct signatures in cosmological observables? After systematically deriving\nthe Feynman rules for exchange diagrams consisting of massive spinning fields,\nwhere we discover the necessity of \\textit{effective propagators} that augment\nthe naive Schwinger-Keldysh ones by delta functions corresponding to\ninstantaneous propagation, we show that the two set-ups are indistinguishable\nat the level of the inflaton bispectrum but distinguishable at the level of the\ntrispectrum and other higher-point correlation functions. The bispectrum is\nspecial since in the corresponding tree-level Feynman diagrams, only the\nhelicity-zero modes of the spinning fields can propagate. The bispectrum\ncorrespondence holds up to the addition of contact diagrams arising from the\nself-interactions of the inflaton, and is consistent with the symmetries of the\neffective field theory inflation.

    "abstract": "Understanding the interaction of dense, cold ejecta clumps with a fast\nreverse shock, an instance of the \"cloud-crushing\" problem, is essential to\nassess whether core-collapse supernovae act as net dust factories or net dust\ndestroyers. This work assesses whether dusty ejecta clumps are destroyed by the\nreverse shock or instead cool, condense, and grow in mass under realistic\nsupernova-remnant conditions. Cloud-crushing timescales are computed and\ncompared to radiative cooling timescales, including both gas-phase cooling and\ndust-induced cooling, for a large grid of clump densities, dust-to-gas mass\nratios, and shock velocities. When the dust-to-gas mass ratio exceeds\n$10^{-3}$, gas-grain collisions become efficient enough that the cooling\ntimescale $t_{\\rm cool}$ falls below the cloud-crushing timescale $t_{\\rm cc}$\nover a broad span of clump densities and shock velocities, enabling dusty\nclumps to survive even fast reverse shocks. For example, at clump densities\n$\\geq 2 \\times 10^{4}$ cm$^{-3}$, dust-to-gas mass ratios $\\sim 10^{-2}$, and\nshock velocities up to $2000$ km s$^{-1}$, enhanced gas-grain cooling drives\nthe system into a regime where dusty clumps can gain additional cold mass and\nincrease their dust masses. Strong radiative cooling can shield dust-rich\nclumps in supernova remnants, enabling a significant fraction of ejecta dust to\nbe injected into the interstellar medium. These results mirror the \"growth\"\nregime found in studies of circumgalactic clouds and rapidly cooling shocked\nstellar winds, implying a larger dust survival in supernova remnants. Indeed,\nthe dusty globules seen in the Crab Nebula occupy the predicted survival regime\nacross a wide range of physical parameters.",

We point out that the real\npart of the on-shell action of these complex black holes is smaller than that\nof thermal AdS at the lowest temperatures, in AdS$_5$ and higher dimensions.\nSo, na\\\"ively, they should be the \"dominant\" saddles.

Using a mini-superspace approximation and contour arguments, we\nargue that these complex black holes do not actually contribute to the\ngravitational path integral, regardless of the value of their on-shell action.\nSo the standard conclusion that thermal AdS is the correct saddle at the lowest\ntemperatures continues to hold. We also comment on two related matters: whether\nthe Kontsevich-Segal criterion is useful in this setting, and whether the\nunstable small black hole contributes to the path integral in the\nhigh-temperature phase.",

Through the void galaxy cross correlation function,\ncosmic voids, the underdense regions in the galaxy distribution, are used for\nrefined deductions of the Universe's content by correcting apparent geometric\ndistortions. This study proposes a novel procedure for optimally extracting the\nAlcock Paczynski, AP, signal from cosmic voids through a cosmological\nreconstruction technique. Employing cosmological reconstruction, specifically\nusing the Zel'dovich approximation, we estimate the true positions of galaxies\nfrom their redshift space locations, reducing distortions introduced by\npeculiar velocities. Unlike previous analyses, we identify voids and measure\nthe void galaxy cross correlation function directly in reconstructed space.\nThis approach enables us, for the first time, to include in our analysis small\nnonlinear voids, typically discarded in previous studies, thus enhancing the\nstatistical power of void studies and significantly improving their\ncosmological constraining power. Reconstruction is particularly effective even\nat small scales for voids, due to their clean and dynamically simple\nenvironment. This ability to recover information encoded on small scales\nsignificantly enhances the precision of the analysis, leading to a 23 %\nimprovement in the constraints on the AP parameters compared to previous\nmethods where the analysis is performed in redshift space and, consequently, to\na better estimate of the derived cosmological parameters. Our analysis also\nincludes a comprehensive set of consistency checks, demonstrating its\nrobustness. We expect this methodology to yield a substantial gain in\nconstraining power when applied to data from modern large scale structure\nsurveys.",

Fast waveform generation frameworks adopt an offline/online\narchitecture, where expensive relativistic computations (e.g. self-force and\nblack hole perturbation theory) are performed offline, and waveforms are\ngenerated rapidly online via interpolation across a multidimensional parameter\nspace. In this work, we investigate potential sources of error that result in\nsystematic bias in these relativistic waveform models, focusing on\nradiation-reaction fluxes. Two key sources of systematics are identified: (i)\nthe intrinsic inaccuracy of the flux data, for which we focus on the truncation\nof the multipolar mode sum, and (ii) interpolation errors from transitioning to\nthe online stage. We quantify the impact of mode-sum truncation and analyze\ninterpolation errors by using various grid structures and interpolation\nschemes. For circular orbits in Kerr spacetime with spins larger than $a \\geq\n0.9$, we find that $\\ell_{\\text{max}} \\geq 30$ is required for the necessary\naccuracy. We also develop an efficient Chebyshev interpolation scheme,\nachieving the desired accuracy level with significantly fewer grid points\ncompared to spline-based methods. For circular orbits in Kerr spacetimes, we\ndemonstrate via Bayesian studies that interpolating the flux to a maximum\nglobal relative error that is equal to the small mass ratio is sufficient for\nparameter estimation purposes. For 4-year long quasi-circular EMRI signals with\nSNRs$= \\mathcal{O}(100)$ and mass-ratios $10^{-4}-10^{-6}$, a global relative\nerror of $10^{-6}$ yields mismatches $<10^{-3}$ and negligible parameter\nestimation biases.",

In this work, we develop a method to compute the symTO of\n1+1D systems by analyzing their low-energy spectra under closed boundary\nconditions with all possible symmetry twists.

    "abstract": "White dwarfs (WDs) receive natal velocity boosts of $\\sim 1 \\, \\mathrm{km \\,\ns^{-1}}$ due to recoil from asymmetric mass loss during the late asymptotic\ngiant branch (AGB) stage. In a wide binary, the acceleration of a proto-WD\nexerts a torque, modifying the orbital eccentricity. Potential signatures of\nthis effect have been detected in Gaia's astrometric binary sample. At the same\ntime, an AGB star's puffy envelope facilitates strong tidal interactions in\nbinaries with periapsis separations of a few AU, capturing the companion into a\ntighter orbit and potentially driving the system towards a common-envelope\nphase. Using an analytical model for wide binary evolution under asymmetric AGB\nmass loss, we find that recoil can induce tidal interactions in up to $30\\%$ of\ninitially wide binaries on the AGB or post-AGB for initial separations of $\\sim\n100 \\mbox{--} 1000$ AU.

It primarily due to fundamental limitations in\nexisting approaches: CLIP-based RMs suffer from architectural and input\nmodality constraints, while prevalent Bradley-Terry losses are fundamentally\nmisaligned with the next-token prediction mechanism of Vision-Language Models\n(VLMs), hindering effective scaling. More critically, the RLHF optimization\nprocess is plagued by Reward Hacking issue, where models exploit flaws in the\nreward signal without improving true quality. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce RewardDance, a scalable reward modeling framework that overcomes\nthese barriers through a novel generative reward paradigm. By reformulating the\nreward score as the model's probability of predicting a \"yes\" token, indicating\nthat the generated image outperforms a reference image according to specific\ncriteria, RewardDance intrinsically aligns reward objectives with VLM\narchitectures. This alignment unlocks scaling across two dimensions: (1) Model\nScaling: Systematic scaling of RMs up to 26 billion parameters; (2) Context\nScaling: Integration of task-specific instructions, reference examples, and\nchain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nRewardDance significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods in text-to-image,\ntext-to-video, and image-to-video generation. Crucially, we resolve the\npersistent challenge of \"reward hacking\": Our large-scale RMs exhibit and\nmaintain high reward variance during RL fine-tuning, proving their resistance\nto hacking and ability to produce diverse, high-quality outputs.

We explore scalable methods for\nbuilding web-based corpora for LLMs. We apply them to build a new 120B token\ncorpus in Portuguese that achieves competitive results to an industrial-grade\ncorpus. Using a continual pretraining setup, we study how different data\nselection and preprocessing strategies affect LLM performance when\ntransitioning a model originally trained in English to another language.

    "abstract": "The recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in the bilayer\nnickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has spurred intense interest in exploring analogous\nmechanisms in other transition metal oxides. This raises a pivotal question:\ncan cuprates, as neighbors to nickelates in the periodic table, host similar\ntwo-orbital superconductivity? Here, we systematically investigate the\nelectronic structure of a series of designed Ruddlesden-Popper cuprates. Our\ncalculations reveal that the parent compound La$_3$Cu$_2$O$_7$ is a weakly\ncorrelated metal, and hole-doping fails to induce strong correlation. We find\nthat the actual valence of the copper cations becomes strikingly pinned around\n+2.3, far away from the targeted $d^8$ configuration. This valence pinning is\nattributed to the inherent charge-transfer nature of cuprates. We propose this\nmechanism as a general principle explaining the robust single-orbital physics\nconsistently observed in the cuprate family, holding true even in materials\nlike the high-$T_c$ superconductor Ba$_2$CuO$_{3+\\delta}$ that appear\nstructurally primed for two-orbital activity. Our results therefore conclude\nthat the route towards two-orbital superconductivity is fundamentally\nobstructed in cuprates, providing a crucial constraint for the future design of\nhigh-temperature superconductors.",

    "abstract": "The fluid antenna system (FAS) concept is an emerging paradigm that promotes\nthe utilization of the feature of shape and position reconfigurability in\nantennas to broaden the design of wireless communication systems. This also\nmeans that spatial diversity can be exploited in an unconventional way.\nHowever, a rigorous framework for error probability analysis of FAS under\nrealistic spatially correlated channels has been lacking. In this paper, we\nfill this gap by deriving a tight, closed-form asymptotic expression for the\nsymbol error rate (SER) that establishes the fundamental scaling law linking\nthe system's SER to the channel's spatial correlation structure. A key insight\nof our analysis is that the achievable diversity gain is governed not by the\nnumber of antenna ports, but by the channel's effective rank. To find this\ncritical parameter, we propose a novel dual-pronged approach. First of all, we\ndevelop a geometry-based algorithm that extracts distinct performance\nthresholds from the channel's eigenvalue spectrum. Second, we theoretically\nprove that the effective rank converges to a fundamental limit dictated solely\nby the antenna's normalized aperture width. We further establish the\nequivalence between the threshold identified by the geometric algorithm and the\nderived theoretical limit, providing rigorous validation for the proposed\nmethod. Our effective rank model achieves higher accuracy than existing\napproaches in the literature. Building on this framework, we offer a complete\ncharacterization of diversity and coding gains. The analysis leads to a\ndefinitive design insight: FAS performance improvements are fundamentally\ndriven by enlarging the antenna's explorable aperture, which increases the\neffective channel rank, whereas increasing port density within a fixed aperture\nyields diminishing returns.",

What is missing is a psychologically meaningful representation\nthat unifies these dimensions and varies systematically with behavior. We\npropose the context matrix as one such representation. The context matrix is\nthe transition matrix in a linear dynamical system, with entries specifying how\nmuch each individual's current behavior is attributable to their own versus\nevery other group member's past behaviors. Its values can be distilled into\npsychologically interpretable summary features of synchrony and directional\ninfluence.

Models fare poorly on\nOVCs due to a lack of necessary knowledge a priori. In such situations, a\ndomain expert can provide correct constructs at inference time based on their\npreferences or domain knowledge. Our goal is to effectively reuse this\ninference-time, expert-provided knowledge for future parses without retraining\nthe model. We present dynamic knowledge-augmented parsing(DKAP), where in\naddition to the input sentence, the model receives (dynamically growing) expert\nknowledge as a key-value lexicon that associates NL phrases with correct OVC\nconstructs. We propose ROLex, a retrieval-augmented parsing approach that uses\nthis lexicon. A retriever and a generator are trained to find and use the\nkey-value store to produce the correct parse. A key challenge lies in curating\ndata for this retrieval-augmented parser. We utilize synthetic data generation\nand the data augmentation techniques on annotated (NL sentence, FL statement)\npairs to train the augmented parser. To improve training effectiveness, we\npropose multiple strategies to teach models to focus on the relevant subset of\nretrieved knowledge. Finally, we introduce a new evaluation paradigm modeled\nafter the DKAP problem and simulate the scenario across three formalization\ntasks (NL2LTL, NL2Code, and NL2CMD). Our evaluations show that DKAP is a\ndifficult challenge, and ROLex helps improve the performance of baseline models\nby using dynamic expert knowledge effectively.",

Through symmetry-based circuit synthesis\nand optimized error correction, we reduce the required logical and physical\nresources by two orders of magnitude. Our concrete resource analysis\ndemonstrates that solving NSE on a $2^{80}$-grid is feasible with 8.71 million\nphysical qubits (at an error rate of $5 \\times 10^{-4}$) in 42.6 days --\noutperforming a state-of-the-art supercomputer, which would require over a\ncentury.

    "abstract": "The evolutionary origins of ageing and age-associated diseases continue to\npose a fundamental question in biology. This study is concerned with a recently\nproposed framework, which conceptualises development and ageing as a continuous\nprocess, driven by genetically encoded epigenetic changes in target sets of\ncells. According to the Evolvable Soma Theory of Ageing (ESTA), ageing reflects\nthe cumulative manifestation of epigenetic changes that are predominantly\nexpressed during the post-reproductive phase. These late-acting modifications\nare not yet evolutionarily optimised but are instead subject to ongoing\nselection, functioning as somatic \"experiments\" through which evolution\nexplores novel phenotypic variation. These experiments are often detrimental,\nleading to progressive physical decline and eventual death, while a small\nsubset may produce beneficial adaptations, that evolution can exploit to shape\nfuture developmental trajectories. According to ESTA, ageing can be understood\nas evolution in action, yet old age is also the strongest risk factor for major\ndiseases such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders,\nand metabolic syndrome. We argue that this association is not merely\ncorrelational but causal: the same epigenetic process that drive development\nand ageing also underlie age-associated diseases. Growing evidence points to\nepigenetic regulation as a central factor in these pathologies, since no\nconsistent patterns of genetic mutations have been identified, whereas\nwidespread regulatory and epigenetic disruptions are observed. From this\nperspective, evolution is not only the driver of ageing but also the ultimate\nsource of the diseases that accompany it, making it the root cause of most\nage-related pathologies.",

More broadly speaking, they\ncan be interpreted as groups that collaborate to achieve a common goal, for\ninstance, defending themselves against possible attacks from outside. In this\npaper, we initiate the study of reconfiguring alliances. This means that, with\nthe understanding of having an interconnection map given by a graph, we look at\ntwo alliances of the same size~$k$ and investigate if there is a\nreconfiguration sequence (of length at most~$\\ell$) formed by alliances of size\n(at most)~$k$ that transfers one alliance into the other one. Here, we consider\ndifferent (now classical) movements of tokens: sliding, jumping,\naddition/removal. We link the latter two regimes by introducing the concept of\nreconfiguration monotonicity. Concerning classical complexity, most of these\nreconfiguration problems are \\textsf{PSPACE}-complete, although some are\nsolvable in \\textsf{Log\\-SPACE}. We also consider these reconfiguration\nquestions through the lense of parameterized algorithms and prove various\n\\textsf{FPT}-results, in particular concerning the combined parameter $k+\\ell$\nor neighborhood diversity together with $k$ or neighborhood diversity together\nwith $k$.",

The resonators\npassively couple to a standard 2Tx/32Rx head coil without hardware\nmodifications. Bench tests assessed tuning, isolation, and detuning\nperformance. B1$^+$ maps were measured in a head/shoulder phantom, and SNR maps\nwere obtained in both phantom and in vivo experiments.\n  Results: Bench measurements confirmed accurate tuning, strong inter-element\nisolation, and effective passive detuning. Phantom B1$^+$ mapping showed\nnegligible differences between configurations with and without the resonators.\nPhantom and in vivo imaging demonstrated up to about a 3-fold SNR gain in the\neye region, with no measurable SNR loss in the brain.\n  Conclusion: The wireless resonator glasses provide a low-cost, easy-to-use\nsolution that improves ocular SNR while preserving whole-brain image quality,\nenabling both dedicated eye MRI and simultaneous eye-brain imaging at ultrahigh\nfield.",

To evaluate the impact of a futility interim analysis\nin trials utilizing non-concurrent controls, we consider a platform trial\nfeaturing two experimental arms and a shared control, with the second\nexperimental arm entering later. We focus on a frequentist regression model\nthat uses non-concurrent controls to estimate the treatment effect of the\nsecond arm and adjusts for time using a step function to account for temporal\nchanges. We show that performing a futility interim analysis in Arm 1 may\nintroduce bias in the point estimation of the effect in Arm 2, if the\nregression model is used without adjustment, and investigate how the marginal\nbias and bias conditional on the first arm continuing after the interim depend\non different trial design parameters. Moreover, we propose a new estimator of\nthe treatment effect in Arm 2, aiming to eliminate the bias introduced by both\nthe interim analysis in Arm 1 and the time trends, and evaluate its performance\nin a simulation study. The newly proposed estimator is shown to substantially\nreduce the bias and type I error rate inflation while leading to power gains\ncompared to an analysis using only concurrent controls.",

The Earth rotates in a regular way with very small irregularities\nwhich are measured to the level of milli-arcseconds.

    "abstract": "The Random Walk Pinning Model (RWPM) is a statistical mechanics model in\nwhich the trajectory of a continuous time random walk $X=(X_t)_{t\\geq 0}$ is\nrewarded according to the time it spends together with a moving catalyst. More\nspecifically for a system of size $T$, the law of $X$ is tilted by the Gibbs\nfactor $\\exp(\\beta \\int_0^T \\mathbf{1}_{\\{X_t=Y_t\\}} dt)$, where $\\beta \\geq 0$\nis the inverse temperature. The moving catalyst $Y=(Y_t)_{t\\ge 0}$ is given by\nthe quenched trajectory of a second continuous-time random walk, with the same\ndistribution as $X$ but a different jump rate $\\rho\\geq 0$, interpreted as the\ndisorder intensity. For fixed $\\rho\\ge 0$, the RWPM undergoes a localization\nphase transition when $\\beta$ passes a critical value $\\beta_c(\\rho)$. We\nthoroughly investigate the question of disorder relevance to determine whether\na disorder of arbitrarily small intensity affects the features of the phase\ntransition. We focus our analysis on the case of transient $\\gamma$-stable\nwalks on $\\mathbb{Z}$, i.e. random walks in the domain of attraction of a\n$\\gamma$-stable law, with $\\gamma\\in (0,1)$. In the present paper, we derive\nlower bounds for the free energy, which results in either a proof of disorder\nirrelevance or upper bounds on the critical point shift. More precisely, when\n$\\gamma \\in(\\frac23,1)$, our estimates imply that that\n$\\beta_c(\\rho)=\\beta_c(0)$ and $\\rho$ is small, showing disorder irrelevance.\nWhen $\\gamma\\in (0,\\frac23]$ our companion paper shows that\n$\\beta_c(\\rho)>\\beta_c(0)$ for every $\\rho>0$, showing disorder relevance: we\nderive here upper bounds on the critical point shift, which are matching the\nlower bounds obtained in our companion paper. For good measure, our analysis\nalso includes the case of the simple random walk of $\\mathbb{Z}^d$ (for $d\\ge\n3$) for which no upper bound on the critical point shift was previously known.",

    "abstract": "Multiple photometric studies have reported the presence of seemingly older\naccreting pre-main sequence stars (PMS) in optical colour-magnitude diagrams\n(CMDs). We investigate this phenomenon in the Orion Nebula, which harbors a\nsubset of stars that show infrared excess detected by Spitzer and Halpha excess\nemission, yet display significantly older isochronal ages (>10 Myr) compared to\nthe bulk population (~1-3 Myr) in the r, (r-i) CMD. We perform a detailed\nspectroscopic analysis of 40 Orion Nebula stars using VLT/X-Shooter, covering\nCMD-based isochronal ages from 1 to over 30 Myr. We derive extinction values,\nstellar properties, and accretion parameters by modeling the ultraviolet excess\nemission through a multicomponent fitting procedure. The sample spans spectral\ntypes from M4.5 up to K6, and masses in the range ~0.1-0.8 Msun. We demonstrate\nthat, when extinction and, most importantly, accretion effects are accurately\nconstrained, the stellar luminosity and effective temperature of the majority\nof the seemingly old stars become consistent with a younger population (~1-5\nMyr). This is supported by strong lithium absorption, which corroborates their\nyouth, and by the accretion-to-stellar luminosity ratios typical for young,\naccreting stars. Three of these sources, however, remain old even after our\nanalysis, despite showing signatures consistent with ongoing accretion from a\nprotoplanetary disc. More generally, our analysis indicates that excess\ncontinuum emission from accretion shocks affects the placement of PMS stars in\nthe CMD, displacing sources towards bluer optical colours. This study\nhighlights the critical role of accretion in shaping the stellar properties\nestimates (including age) derived from optical CMDs and emphasizes the need to\ncarefully account for accretion effects when interpreting age distributions in\nstar-forming regions.",

Its early cutaneous manifestations are clinically\nsignificant but often underdiagnosed, particularly in rural areas with limited\naccess to dermatologists. Automated, image-based diagnostic solutions can\nsupport early detection and timely interventions.\n  Methods: In this study, we propose an end-to-end framework for arsenicosis\ndiagnosis using mobile phone-captured skin images. A dataset comprising 20\nclasses and over 11000 images of arsenic-induced and other dermatological\nconditions was curated. Multiple deep learning architectures, including\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based models, were\nbenchmarked for arsenicosis detection. Model interpretability was integrated\nvia LIME and Grad-CAM, while deployment feasibility was demonstrated through a\nweb-based diagnostic tool.\n  Results: Transformer-based models significantly outperformed CNNs, with the\nSwin Transformer achieving the best results (86\\\\% accuracy). LIME and Grad-CAM\nvisualizations confirmed that the models attended to lesion-relevant regions,\nincreasing clinical transparency and aiding in error analysis. The framework\nalso demonstrated strong performance on external validation samples, confirming\nits ability to generalize beyond the curated dataset.\n  Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates the potential of deep\nlearning for non-invasive, accessible, and explainable diagnosis of arsenicosis\nfrom mobile-acquired images. By enabling reliable image-based screening, it can\nserve as a practical diagnostic aid in rural and resource-limited communities,\nwhere access to dermatologists is scarce, thereby supporting early detection\nand timely intervention.",

This\npaper presents a novel method to improve ADHD diagnosis precision and\ntimeliness by leveraging Deep Learning (DL) approaches and electroencephalogram\n(EEG) signals. We introduce ADHDeepNet, a DL model that utilizes comprehensive\ntemporal-spatial characterization, attention modules, and explainability\ntechniques optimized for EEG signals.

The proposed\ntwo-stage methodology uses a 10-fold cross-subject validation strategy.\nInitially, each iteration optimizes the model's hyper-parameters with inner\n2-fold cross-validation. Then, Additive Gaussian Noise (AGN) with various\nstandard deviations and magnification levels is applied for data augmentation.\nADHDeepNet achieved 100% sensitivity and 99.17% accuracy in classifying ADHD/HC\nsubjects. To clarify model explainability and identify key brain regions and\nfrequency bands for ADHD diagnosis, we analyzed the learned weights and\nactivation patterns of the model's primary layers.

    "abstract": "This article investigates the question of disorder relevance for the\ncontinuous-time Random Walk Pinning Model (RWPM) and completes the results of\nour companion paper. The RWPM considers a continuous time random walk\n$X=(X_t)_{t\\geq 0}$, whose law is modified by a Gibbs weight given by\n$\\exp(\\beta \\int_0^T \\mathbf{1}_{\\{X_t=Y_t\\}} dt)$, where $Y=(Y_t)_{t\\geq 0}$\nis a quenched trajectory of a second (independent) random walk and $\\beta \\geq\n0$ is the inverse temperature. The random walk $Y$ has the same distribution as\n$X$ but a jump rate $\\rho \\geq 0$, interpreted as the disorder intensity. For\nfixed $\\rho\\ge 0$, the RWPM undergoes a localization phase transition as\n$\\beta$ crosses a critical threshold $\\beta_c(\\rho)$. The question of disorder\nrelevance then consists in determining whether a disorder of arbitrarily small\nintensity $\\rho$ changes the properties of the phase transition. We focus our\nanalysis on the case of transient $\\gamma$-stable walks on $\\mathbb{Z}$, i.e.\nrandom walks in the domain of attraction of a $\\gamma$-stable law, with\n$\\gamma\\in (0,1)$. In the present paper, we show that disorder is relevant when\n$\\gamma \\in (0,\\frac23]$, namely that $\\beta_c(\\rho)>\\beta_c(0)$ for every\n$\\rho>0$. We also provide lower bounds on the critical point shift, which are\nmatching the upper bounds obtained in our companion paper. Interestingly, in\nthe marginal case $\\gamma = \\frac23$, disorder is always relevant,\nindependently of the fine properties of the random walk distribution. When\n$\\gamma \\in (\\frac23,1)$, our companion paper proves that disorder is\nirrelevant (in particular $\\beta_c(\\rho)=\\beta_c(0)$ for $\\rho$ small enough).\nWe provide here an upper bound on the free energy in the regime $\\gamma\\in\n(\\frac 2 3,1)$ that highlights the fact that although disorder is irrelevant,\nit still has a non-trivial effect on the phase transition, at any $\\rho>0$.",

Recent\nVision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit promising capabilities such as object\nrecognition, common-sense reasoning, and contextual understanding-capabilities\nthat align with the nuanced requirements of social robot navigation. However,\nit remains unclear whether VLMs can accurately understand complex social\nnavigation scenes (e.g., inferring the spatial-temporal relations among agents\nand human intentions), which is essential for safe and socially compliant robot\nnavigation. While some recent works have explored the use of VLMs in social\nrobot navigation, no existing work systematically evaluates their ability to\nmeet these necessary conditions. In this paper, we introduce the Social\nNavigation Scene Understanding Benchmark (SocialNav-SUB), a Visual Question\nAnswering (VQA) dataset and benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs for scene\nunderstanding in real-world social robot navigation scenarios. SocialNav-SUB\nprovides a unified framework for evaluating VLMs against human and rule-based\nbaselines across VQA tasks requiring spatial, spatiotemporal, and social\nreasoning in social robot navigation.

    "abstract": "Developing autonomous LLM agents capable of making a series of intelligent\ndecisions to solve complex, real-world tasks is a fast-evolving frontier. Like\nhuman cognitive development, agents are expected to acquire knowledge and\nskills through exploration and interaction with the environment. Despite\nadvances, the community still lacks a unified, interactive reinforcement\nlearning (RL) framework that can effectively train such agents from scratch --\nwithout relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) -- across diverse and realistic\nenvironments. To bridge this gap, we introduce AgentGym-RL, a new framework to\ntrain LLM agents for multi-turn interactive decision-making through RL. The\nframework features a modular and decoupled architecture, ensuring high\nflexibility and extensibility. It encompasses a wide variety of real-world\nscenarios, and supports mainstream RL algorithms. Furthermore, we propose\nScalingInter-RL, a training approach designed for exploration-exploitation\nbalance and stable RL optimization. In early stages, it emphasizes exploitation\nby restricting the number of interactions, and gradually shifts towards\nexploration with larger horizons to encourage diverse problem-solving\nstrategies. In this way, the agent develops more diverse behaviors and is less\nprone to collapse under long horizons. We perform extensive experiments to\nvalidate the stability and effectiveness of both the AgentGym-RL framework and\nthe ScalingInter-RL approach. Our agents match or surpass commercial models on\n27 tasks across diverse environments. We offer key insights and will\nopen-source the complete AgentGym-RL framework -- including code and datasets\n-- to empower the research community in developing the next generation of\nintelligent agents.",

We propose Design-GenNO, a\nphysics-informed generative neural operator framework that unifies generative\nmodeling with operator learning to address these challenges. In Design-GenNO,\nmicrostructures are encoded into a low-dimensional, well-structured latent\nspace, which serves as the generator for both reconstructing microstructures\nand predicting solution fields of governing PDEs. MultiONet-based decoders\nenable functional mappings from latent variables to both microstructures and\nfull PDE solution fields, allowing a multitude of design objectives to be\naddressed without retraining. A normalizing flow prior regularizes the latent\nspace, facilitating efficient sampling and robust gradient-based optimization.\nA distinctive feature of the framework is its physics-informed training\nstrategy: by embedding PDE residuals directly into the learning objective,\nDesign-GenNO significantly reduces reliance on labeled datasets and can even\noperate in a self-supervised setting. We validate the method on a suite of\ninverse design tasks in two-phase materials, including effective property\nmatching, recovery of microstructures from sparse field measurements, and\nmaximization of conductivity ratios.

Therefore, we introduce\nthe Iterated Random Generalized (IRG) TSP framework.

The second algorithm, Parallel Communicating GTSPs (PCG), solves GTSPs\ncorresponding to several sets of points simultaneously.

The disk migration model provides the best statistical\nfit to observations (KS statistic = 0.100, p-value = 0.216), with optimal\nparameters {\\mu}_rate = 0.5, {\\sigma}_rate = 0.5, and t-myr = 0.5. The\nformation bias model achieves intermediate performance (KS = 0.173, p-value =\n0.005) with optimal migration fraction p_move = 0.05, while the core accretion\nscenario shows the poorest fit (KS = 0.417, p-value = 3.5{\\times}10^-17)\ndespite its theoretical appeal. Our results suggest that brown dwarfs primarily\nform at wide separations and undergo limited inward migration, challenging\nscenarios that invoke in-situ formation through core accretion processes at\nclose orbital separations.",

    "abstract": "The efficiency of Bayesian optimization (BO) in chemistry is often hindered\nby sparse experimental data and complex reaction mechanisms. To overcome these\nlimitations, we introduce ChemBOMAS, a new framework named LLM-Enhanced\nMulti-Agent System for accelerating BO in chemistry. ChemBOMAS's optimization\nprocess is enhanced by LLMs and synergistically employs two strategies:\nknowledge-driven coarse-grained optimization and data-driven fine-grained\noptimization. First, in the knowledge-driven coarse-grained optimization stage,\nLLMs intelligently decompose the vast search space by reasoning over existing\nchemical knowledge to identify promising candidate regions. Subsequently, in\nthe data-driven fine-grained optimization stage, LLMs enhance the BO process\nwithin these candidate regions by generating pseudo-data points, thereby\nimproving data utilization efficiency and accelerating convergence. Benchmark\nevaluations** further confirm that ChemBOMAS significantly enhances\noptimization effectiveness and efficiency compared to various BO algorithms.\nImportantly, the practical utility of ChemBOMAS was validated through wet-lab\nexperiments conducted under pharmaceutical industry protocols, targeting\nconditional optimization for a previously unreported and challenging chemical\nreaction. In the wet experiment, ChemBOMAS achieved an optimal objective value\nof 96%. This was substantially higher than the 15% achieved by domain experts.\nThis real-world success, together with strong performance on benchmark\nevaluations, highlights ChemBOMAS as a powerful tool to accelerate chemical\ndiscovery.",

We focus on the\ndevelopment of an \"AI twin\" that could complement its creator's efforts,\nenabling them to produce higher-quality output in their individual style.\nHowever, AI twins could also, over time, replace individual humans. We analyze\nthis trade-off using a principal-agent model in which agents have the\nopportunity to make investments into training an AI twin that lead to a lower\ncost of effort, a higher probability of success, or both. We propose a new\nframework to situate the model in which the tasks performed vary in the ease to\nwhich AI output can be improved by the human (the \"editability\") and also vary\nin the extent to which a non-expert can assess the quality of output (its\n\"verifiability.\") Our synthesis of recent empirical studies indicates that\nproductivity gains from the use of generative AI are higher overall when task\neditability is higher, while non-experts enjoy greater relative productivity\ngains for tasks with higher verifiability. We show that during investment a\nstrategic agent will trade off improvements in quality and ease of effort to\npreserve their wage bargaining power. Tasks with high verifiability and low\neditability are most aligned with a worker's incentives to train their twin,\nbut for tasks where the stakes are low, this alignment is constrained by the\nrisk of displacement. Our results suggest that sustained improvements in\ncompany-sponsored generative AI will require nuanced design of human\nincentives, and that public policy which encourages balancing worker returns\nwith generative AI improvements could yield more sustained long-run\nproductivity gains.",

    "abstract": "SMBHs at the centers of galaxies, illuminated by their accretion disks, can\nreveal valuable information on BH spacetimes via their shadows, which can be\nused for strong-gravity tests. However, the continuum emission from their\nhighly turbulent hot plasma is expected to be strongly time-varying and with\nvery inhomogeneous brightness. This can mask important SMBH-related effects,\nlike the appearance of the light-ring, rendering them ineffective as probes of\nstrong gravitational lensing physics. Besides being an inhomogeneous and\nstrongly time-varying ''illuminator'', the hot plasma emission extends all the\nway to the ISCO. This then leads to the superposition of the strongly-lensed\nradiation from the area of the light-ring to the continuum emission from the\nISCO, effectively making gravitational lensing physics hard to separate from\naccretion disk Astrophysics. These problems could be overcome if one utilizes\nthe spectral line radiation field emanating from the cooler parts of the\nextended accretion disk, the so-called BLR, and especially its expected neutral\nphase, as a more distant, but still adequately strong SMBH illuminator,\ntypically found at $r\\sim (10^2-10^4)\\, R_s$. This kind of illumination can\nprovide a cleaner image of the light-ring region, and thus allow more\ninformation on the spacetime geometry around the SMBH to be obtained. Here, we\nexamine some of the benefits of such an illumination in discerning\nstrong-gravity physics near SMBHs and their observability. We expand on the\nfact that such emission can provide a smoking gun signal of lensing, in the\nform of an Einstein ring. To first order, the imaging of the Einstein ring and\nits spectroscopic signature can facilitate the measurement of the SMBH mass,\nwhile the second order effects associated with the light-ring can constrain the\nSMBH spin, and even identify deviations from the Kerr spacetime.",

While these solutions are able to track secret\ninformation stored on the heap, they suffer from limitations that prevent them\nfrom correctly tracking secrets on the stack, at a cost in performance.\n  This paper introduces SecSep, a transformation framework that rewrites\nassembly programs so that they partition secret and public data on the stack.\nBy moving from the source-code level to assembly rewriting, SecSep is able to\naddress limitations of prior work. The key challenge in performing this\nassembly rewriting stems from the loss of semantic information through the\nlengthy compilation process. The key innovation of our methodology is a new\nvariant of typed assembly language (TAL), Octal, which allows us to address\nthis challenge.

Quantum computers that interact with\nstandard computers to perform computations are called adaptive quantum\ncomputers. This work formalizes a model that describes these adaptive quantum\ncomputers. As quantum computers are still under development, this work focuses\non computations that terminate after a fixed number of steps, as that makes\ntheir implementation likely easier in practice.\n  First, we show that adaptive quantum computers are more powerful than\nstandard computers with respect to the practical problem of retrieving\ninformation from corrupted digital data. Standard computers struggle to\nretrieve such information within a fixed number of computation steps. The proof\nuses a structure-versus-randomness approach that splits the problem in a\nstructured and a random-like component. The potential of adaptive quantum\ncomputations follows from a specific example where information is retrieved\nfrom corrupted data. Additionally, adaptive quantum computers can even improve\nstandard computations for this problem that are not constrained by a fixed\nnumber of computation steps.\n  Next, we show how adaptive quantum computations can improve non-adaptive\nquantum computations when preparing specific quantum states. We present\nefficient adaptive quantum algorithms to prepare the uniform superposition\nstate, the GHZ state, the W-state and the Dicke state.

The paradox is understood by realizing that angular momentum is\ninitially stored in the electromagnetic field and is transferred to the\nparticle when the magnetic field is removed. In a classical description, no\nrotation occurs if the particle is uncharged, as the initial angular momentum\nis zero in this case. We show that electromagnetic fluctuations in thermal\nequilibrium can induce a quantum analog of the Feynman paradox, where a\nnonreciprocal particle without charge starts to rotate when the source of\nnonreciprocity is removed. This paradox is due to persistent energy fluxes\narising in nonreciprocal systems at equilibrium, leading to angular momentum\nstored in the electromagnetic field. We demonstrate that the contribution of\nvacuum fluctuations to persistent energy fluxes dominate over thermal\nfluctuations at finite temperature, so vacuum fluctuations dominate the\nequilibrium angular momentum as well.

    "abstract": "The complementarity-determining regions of antibodies are loop structures\nthat are key to their interactions with antigens, and of high importance to the\ndesign of novel biologics. Since the 1980s, categorizing the diversity of CDR\nstructures into canonical clusters has enabled the identification of key\nstructural motifs of antibodies. However, existing approaches have limited\ncoverage and cannot be readily incorporated into protein foundation models.\nHere we introduce ImmunoGlobulin LOOp Tokenizer, Igloo, a multimodal antibody\nloop tokenizer that encodes backbone dihedral angles and sequence. Igloo is\ntrained using a contrastive learning objective to map loops with similar\nbackbone dihedral angles closer together in latent space. Igloo can efficiently\nretrieve the closest matching loop structures from a structural antibody\ndatabase, outperforming existing methods on identifying similar H3 loops by\n5.9\\%. Igloo assigns tokens to all loops, addressing the limited coverage issue\nof canonical clusters, while retaining the ability to recover canonical loop\nconformations. To demonstrate the versatility of Igloo tokens, we show that\nthey can be incorporated into protein language models with IglooLM and\nIglooALM. On predicting binding affinity of heavy chain variants, IglooLM\noutperforms the base protein language model on 8 out of 10 antibody-antigen\ntargets. Additionally, it is on par with existing state-of-the-art\nsequence-based and multimodal protein language models, performing comparably to\nmodels with $7\\times$ more parameters. IglooALM samples antibody loops which\nare diverse in sequence and more consistent in structure than state-of-the-art\nantibody inverse folding models. Igloo demonstrates the benefit of introducing\nmultimodal tokens for antibody loops for encoding the diverse landscape of\nantibody loops, improving protein foundation models, and for antibody CDR\ndesign.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a method to accelerate the inference process of diffusion\ntransformer (DiT)-based text-to-speech (TTS) models by applying a selective\ncaching mechanism to transformer layers. Specifically, I integrate SmoothCache\ninto the F5-TTS architecture, focusing on caching outputs of self-attention and\nfeed-forward network layers to reduce redundant computations during the\ndenoising process. A calibration phase is introduced to analyze L1 relative\nerrors between timesteps, guiding the selection of cache schedules that\nminimize quality degradation. To address the problem of inter-layer dependency,\na unified caching schedule is adopted, applying the cache pattern derived from\nself-attention layers to both layer types. Experiments on LibriSpeech-PC and\nSeed-TTS datasets evaluate various cache thresholds and denoising step\nconfigurations. Results show that caching at higher denoising steps reduces\ninference time without compromising output quality, whereas caching at lower\nsteps can negatively impact synthesis quality similarly to reducing the total\nnumber of denoising steps. Objective and subjective metrics confirm the\neffectiveness of SmoothCache in maintaining performance while improving\ncomputational efficiency. Comparisons between cached inference and reduced-step\ninference further highlight the benefits of selective caching, especially under\nhigh-step configurations. This work demonstrates that transformer layer caching\nis a practical solution for optimizing diffusion transformer-based TTS models\nwithout requiring architectural changes or retraining.

    "abstract": "Quantum state purification, which mitigates noise by exploiting multiple\nnoisy copies of unknown states, has applications in quantum communication and\ncomputation with imperfect devices. Despite its importance, the fundamental\ncapabilities and limitations of purification in distributed quantum systems\nremain largely unexplored. Here, we systematically study distributed quantum\nstate purification under local operations and classical communication (LOCC).\nWe prove that no nontrivial two-to-one LOCC purification protocol exists for\nthree fundamental sets: all pure states, all maximally entangled states, and\nthe four Bell states. This no-go theorem demonstrates that no LOCC protocol can\nreduce noise for every state within these sets, even probabilistically. In\nstark contrast, we show that single-state purification is achievable, and we\nprovide an explicit analytical LOCC protocol for individual target states. For\narbitrary state sets, we develop an optimization-based algorithm that\nsystematically designs LOCC purification protocols, demonstrating its efficacy\nthrough concrete examples. These results delineate the fundamental boundaries\nof LOCC-based purification and provide practical strategies for noise reduction\nin distributed quantum information processing.",

    "abstract": "The continuum emission from the hot and ionized inner regions of a\nsupermassive black hole (SMBH) accretion disk that is strongly lensed by the\nlight-ring (i.e., the unstable photon orbit), is always superimposed on that of\nthe locally emitting plasma near the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO),\nmasking strong-gravity effects and making their study difficult. A cleaner\nimage of the light-ring against a non-luminous background, not affected by the\nemission and all the dynamical effects taking place near the ISCO, would thus\nbe preferable. A more distant SMBH illumination source that could accommodate\nthis can be provided by the unique spectral lines emitted by the cooler parts\nof the accretion disk, the so-called Broad Line Region (BLR). Spectral line\nemission from the transitional region between the inner disk and the outer BLR\nmay be ideal for obtaining a cleaner image of the light-ring, and better suited\nfor strong gravity tests. A crucial first order effect of a BLR spectral line\nillumination of the SMBHs in galactic centers, and a possible smoking gun\nsignal of strong SMBH lensing, will be an Einstein ring, whose presence could\nbe evident even in unresolved sources where only the total line profile can be\nacquired.

Whether the IMF is universal or varies with environment remains one\nof the central open questions in astrophysics. Dwarf galaxies such as the Small\nMagellanic Cloud (SMC), with their low metallicity and diffuse star-forming\nregions, offer critical laboratories to address this issue. In this work, we\nexploit ultra-deep photometry from the James Webb Space Telescope to\ninvestigate the stellar populations in the field of the SMC.

We find a binary fraction of $f_{\\rm bin}^{q>0.6}=0.14\\pm0.01$,\nconsistent with results from synthetic CMDs incorporating the metallicity\ndistribution of the SMC. Additionally, the measured binary fraction in the SMC\nfield is consistent with those observed in Galactic open clusters and Milky Way\nfield stars of similar ages and masses, suggesting similar binary formation and\nevolutionary processes across these low-density environments. By combining the\nluminosity function with the best-fit isochrone, we derive the the mass\nfunction (MF) down to $0.22\\,M_{\\odot}$, the lowest mass limit reached for the\nSMC to date. The resulting MF follows a power-law with a slope of\n$\\alpha=-1.99\\pm0.08$.

    "abstract": "In April 2013, the TeV blazar Markarian~421 underwent one of its most\npowerful emission outbursts to date. An extensive multi-instrument campaign\nfeaturing MAGIC, VERITAS, and \\textit{NuSTAR} provided comprehensive\nvery-high-energy (VHE; $E > 100$\\,GeV) and X-ray coverage over nine consecutive\ndays. In this work, we perform a detailed spectral analysis of the X-ray and\nVHE emissions on sub-hour timescales throughout the flare. We identify several\nclockwise spectral hysteresis loops in the X-rays, revealing a spectral\nevolution more complex than a simple harder-when-brighter trend. The VHE\nspectrum extends beyond 10\\,TeV, and its temporal evolution closely mirrors the\nbehavior in the X-rays. We report the first evidence of VHE spectral hysteresis\noccurring simultaneously with the X-ray loops. To interpret these findings, we\napply a time-dependent leptonic model to 240 broadband spectral energy\ndistributions (SEDs) binned on a 15-minute scale, allowing us to\nself-consistently track the particle distribution's history. Our modeling shows\nthat the majority of the sub-hour flux and spectral variations are driven by\nchanges in the luminosity and slope of the injected electron distribution. The\nrequired variations in the electron slope are difficult to reconcile with\nmagnetic reconnection but are consistent with a shock-acceleration scenario\nwhere the shock compression ratio evolves by a factor of $\\sim2$. The model\nalso points to a relatively stable magnetic field and emitting region size,\nfavoring a scenario where the emission originates from a stationary feature in\nthe jet, such as a recollimation shock. However, this scenario requires a jet\nLorentz factor that significantly exceeds values from VLBI measurements to\naccount for the high minimum electron energy implied by the lack of variability\nin the optical band.",

In digital geometry,\nSturmian words correspond to discrete approximations of straight line segments\nin the Euclidean plane. The Dorst-Smeulders coding, introduced in 1984, is a\n4-tuple of integers that uniquely represents a Sturmian word $w$, enabling its\nreconstruction using $|w|$ modular operations, making it highly efficient in\npractice. In this paper, we present a linear-time algorithm that, given a\nbinary input word $w$, computes the Dorst-Smeulders coding of its longest\nSturmian prefix. This forms the basis for computing the Dorst-Smeulders coding\nof an arbitrary binary word $w$, which is a minimal decomposition (in terms of\nthe number of factors) of $w$ into Sturmian words, each represented by its\nDorst-Smeulders coding. This coding could be leveraged in compression schemes\nwhere the input is transformed into a binary word composed of long Sturmian\nsegments. Although the algorithm is conceptually simple and can be implemented\nin just a few lines of code, it is grounded in a deep analysis of the\nstructural properties of Sturmian words.",

    "abstract": "In federated learning, multiple parties train models locally and share their\nparameters with a central server, which aggregates them to update a global\nmodel. To address the risk of exposing sensitive data through local models,\nsecure aggregation via secure multiparty computation has been proposed to\nenhance privacy. At the same time, perfect privacy can only be achieved by a\nuniform distribution of the masked local models to be aggregated. This raises a\nproblem when working with real valued data, as there is no measure on the reals\nthat is invariant under the masking operation, and hence information leakage is\nbound to occur. Shifting the data to a finite field circumvents this problem,\nbut as a downside runs into an inherent accuracy complexity tradeoff issue due\nto fixed point modular arithmetic as opposed to floating point numbers that can\nsimultaneously handle numbers of varying magnitudes. In this paper, a novel\nsecure parameter aggregation method is proposed that employs the torus rather\nthan a finite field. This approach guarantees perfect privacy for each party's\ndata by utilizing the uniform distribution on the torus, while avoiding\naccuracy losses. Experimental results show that the new protocol performs\nsimilarly to the model without secure aggregation while maintaining perfect\nprivacy. Compared to the finite field secure aggregation, the torus-based\nprotocol can in some cases significantly outperform it in terms of model\naccuracy and cosine similarity, hence making it a safer choice.",

    "abstract": "Multi-agent systems (MAS) are critical for automating complex tasks, yet\ntheir practical deployment is severely hampered by the challenge of failure\nattribution. Current diagnostic tools, which rely on statistical correlations,\nare fundamentally inadequate; on challenging benchmarks like Who\\&When,\nstate-of-the-art methods achieve less than 15\\% accuracy in locating the\nroot-cause step of a failure. To address this critical gap, we introduce the\nfirst failure attribution framework for MAS grounded in multi-granularity\ncausal inference. Our approach makes two key technical contributions: (1) a\nperformance causal inversion principle, which correctly models performance\ndependencies by reversing the data flow in execution logs, combined with\nShapley values to accurately assign agent-level blame; (2) a novel causal\ndiscovery algorithm, CDC-MAS, that robustly identifies critical failure steps\nby tackling the non-stationary nature of MAS interaction data. The framework's\nattribution results directly fuel an automated optimization loop, generating\ntargeted suggestions whose efficacy is validated via counterfactual\nsimulations. Evaluations on the Who\\&When and TRAIL benchmarks demonstrate a\nsignificant leap in performance. Our method achieves up to 36.2\\% step-level\naccuracy. Crucially, the generated optimizations boost overall task success\nrates by an average of 22.4\\%. This work provides a principled and effective\nsolution for debugging complex agent interactions, paving the way for more\nreliable and interpretable multi-agent systems.",

The SFI was derived from six\ninterpretable components: diagnostic specificity, temporal consistency,\nentropy, contextual concordance, medication alignment, and trajectory\nstability. SFI-aware calibration applied a multiplicative adjustment, optimized\nacross 50 simulation batches.\n  \\textbf{Results:} At the optimal parameter ($\\alpha$ = 2.0), SFI-aware\ncalibration significantly improved all metrics (p $<$ 0.001).

This\nrelationship, often referred to as spin texture, influences both charge-to-spin\nconversion and spin relaxation, making it one of the essential characteristics\nfor spin-orbit-driven phenomena. Materials with strong spin-orbit coupling and\nbroken inversion symmetry can host persistent spin textures (PSTs) -\nunidirectional spin configurations in momentum space, supporting efficient\ncharge-to-spin conversion and extended spin lifetimes. Monolayer WTe$_2$, a\ntopological material crystallizing in a rectangular lattice, is a notable\nexample; its symmetry enforces a canted PST enabling quantum spin Hall effect\nwith the nontrivial spin orientation. Here, we use first-principles\ncalculations to explore how these properties are modified when WTe$_2$ is\ninterfaced with graphene. We find that the PST is preserved by the local\nsymmetry present in different regions of the heterostructure, while the system\ndevelops extended electron and hole pockets, resulting in semimetallic\nbehavior. Although the band gap closes and eliminates the quantum spin Hall\nphase, spin Hall effects remain robust in both conventional and unconventional\ngeometries. The computed spin Hall conductivities are comparable to those of\nother two-dimensional materials, and the survival of the PST suggests the\npossibility of long-range spin transport even in the absence of topological\nedge states.

Extensive experiments across 60\nreal-world datasets establish that EZR reliably achieves over 90% of the\nbest-known optimization performance in most cases, while providing clear,\ncohort-based rationales that surpass standard attribution-based explainable AI\n(XAI) methods (LIME, SHAP, BreakDown) in clarity and utility. These results\nendorse \"less but better\"; it is both possible and often preferable to use\nfewer (but more informative) examples to generate label-efficient optimization\nand explanations in software systems.

However,\nconventional nonlinear materials suffer from sluggish response time, high power\nthreshold, weak and narrow-bandwidth optical nonlinearities, critically\nlimiting their viability. Here, we report a heteroatom engineering strategy to\novercome these limitations by designing zero-dimensional nitrogen-doped carbon\nquantum dots (N-CQDs) with nonlinear optical performance far exceeding the\nstate-of-the-art. Leveraging spatial self-phase modulation (SSPM) and ultrafast\npump-probe technique, we first demonstrate an all-in-one AOS platform, where\nfemtosecond laser pulses serve dual roles as control and signal beams. The AOS\nsimultaneously realizes ultrafast response time (520 fs), ultralow threshold\nenergy (2.2 Wcm-2), and giant nonlinear refraction indexes (10-5 cm2/W) in the\nwide spectral range (400-1064 nm), yielding performance surpassing\nstate-of-the-art nonlinear carbon materials (i.e. carbon nanotube) by orders of\nmagnitude. Spectroscopic and bandgap analyses attribute these exotic\nperformances to enhanced n-pi interaction enabled by nitrogen doping, which\namplifies nonlinear polarization dynamics. Crucially, ultrafast fluorescence\nspectroscopy reveals a large two-photon absorption cross-section of the N-CQDs,\nchallenging the conventional cognition that broadband SSPM necessitates\nsingle-photon excitation. This discovery unveils a multi-channel AOS rooted in\nsynergistic single-photon and two-photon processes..

Strain analysis\ninformed with the orientation of fibers allows to describe several pathologies\nthat are typically associated with impaired mechanics of the myocardium, such\nas cardiovascular disease. Several methods have been developed to estimate\nstrain-derived metrics from traditional imaging techniques. However, the\nphysical models underlying these methods do not include fiber mechanics,\nrestricting their capacity to accurately explain cardiac function. In this\nwork, we introduce WarpPINN-fibers, a physics-informed neural network framework\nto accurately obtain cardiac motion and strains enhanced by fiber information.\nWe train our neural network to satisfy a hyper-elastic model and promote fiber\ncontraction with the goal to predict the deformation field of the heart from\ncine magnetic resonance images. For this purpose, we build a loss function\ncomposed of three terms: a data-similarity loss between the reference and the\nwarped template images, a regularizer enforcing near-incompressibility of\ncardiac tissue and a fiber-stretch penalization that controls strain in the\ndirection of synthetically produced fibers. We show that our neural network\nimproves the former WarpPINN model and effectively controls fiber stretch in a\nsynthetic phantom experiment. Then, we demonstrate that WarpPINN-fibers\noutperforms alternative methodologies in landmark-tracking and strain curve\nprediction for a cine-MRI benchmark with a cohort of 15 healthy volunteers.

In\nparticular, aster-like +1 defects appear at the curved head of hydra and at the\ntip of its tentacles, while -1/2 defects are seen at the base of the tentacles.\nHowever, functional role of these defects in tissue development is not clear.\nMotivated by these observations, we here model hydra's epthelial tissue as a\nvisco-elastic membrane and the tentacles as growing membrane tubes driven by a\nnematic interaction among actin. We consider the epithelial layer of hydra as a\nfluid membrane and carry out a non-equilibrium simulation which also includes\nmembrane growth and polymerization of actin.

Moreover, we show that by generating synthetic data\nthat is conditioned on each example in the real dataset, GDR's refined outputs\nnaturally match the diversity of web scale datasets, and thereby avoid the\noften challenging task of generating diverse synthetic data via model\nprompting. The simplicity and effectiveness of GDR make it a powerful tool for\nscaling up the total stock of training data for frontier models.",

    "abstract": "Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) is one of the pivotal supporting\ntechnologies for next-generation wireless communication networks. As an\nemerging technical means, the new six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA) system\ncan effectively improve the communication and sensing performance of ISAC\nsystems. However, related research on the architecture based on\nthree-dimensional rotatable antennas (RA) remains relatively limited.\nEspecially under the influence of non-ideal channel characteristics, how to\nbalance system performance and hardware cost control through beamforming\ntechnology in non-ideal channels has become a crucial issue to be solved\nurgently. Given the significant advantages of hybrid beamforming technology in\nbalancing system performance and hardware complexity, this paper focuses on the\nchannel model considering effective aperture loss under the RA architecture and\nstudies the sub-connected hybrid beamforming design for multi-user ISAC\nsystems. Aiming at the non-convex nature with coupled variables in this\nproblem, this paper first transforms the complex fractional objective function\nusing the Fractional Programming (FP) framework, and then proposes an algorithm\nbased on the Alternating Optimization (AO) architecture, which achieves\noptimization by alternately solving five subproblems. Among them, the\nclosed-form update expression of the array rotation angle is derived through\nthe Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, and a two-stage Gradient Ascent (GA)\nbased method is proposed to optimize the antenna rotation angle. Simulation\nresults show that compared with the traditional fixed-position antenna (FPA),\nthe proposed method can significantly improve the overall performance of the\nsystem.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate how the internal dynamics of the systems within\na network influence the transition to synchronization in adaptive networks of\ncoupled Rossler systems. The network structure is dynamically determined by\nlocal energy rules, where links are established according to either intrinsic\n(conservative) or dissipative energy. By systematically varying one of the\nsystem parameter, the bifurcation of an isolated Rossler system illustrates\nthree representative regimes-periodic, multiperiodic, and chaotic-and allows us\nto study their impact on the collective transition. Our results reveal that the\nnature of the synchronization transition strongly depends on the interplay\nbetween microscopic dynamics and the mesoscopic connectivity structure.\nSpecifically, chaotic oscillators coupled via intrinsic energy exhibit\nconditions favorable to explosive synchronization, whereas\nperiodic/multiperiodic oscillators consistently yield smooth, continuous\ntransitions. In contrast, dissipative-energy-based connectivity suppresses\nexplosivity in chaotic networks but may induce explosive behavior in\nmultiperiodic systems as network density increases. These findings demonstrate\nthat explosive synchronization is not solely a topological effect but emerges\nfrom a nontrivial interaction between local dynamical complexity and temporal\nnetwork structure. This provides new insight into how internal oscillator\nstates and coupling mechanisms jointly shape the collective organization and\ndynamic transitions patterns in complex systems.",

Among them, polar, chiral, and\nferro-rotational orders have been theoretically known to form a closed set of\nintertwined orders. However, experimental investigation into their mutual\ncoupling and physical consequences has remained elusive. In this work, we\nemploy the polar-chiral insulator Ni$_3$TeO$_6$ as a platform and utilize a\nmultimodal optical approach to directly probe and reveal the intertwining among\npolarity, chirality, and ferro-rotational order. We demonstrate how their\ncoupling governs the formation of domains and dictates the nature of domain\nwalls. Within the domains, we identify spatial inversion symmetry as the\noperation connecting two domain states of opposite polarity and chirality, with\na common ferro-rotational state serving as the prerequisite for these\ninterlocked configurations. At the domain walls, we observe a pronounced\nenhancement of in-plane polarization accompanied by a suppression of chirality.\nBy combining with Ginzburg-Landau theory within the framework of a pre-existing\nferro-rotational background, we uncover the emergence of mixed N\\'eel- and\nBloch-type domain walls.

However, uncertainties\nin the energy-dependent calibration of the instrument transfer functions (e.g.\nthe effective area, energy redistribution, or gain) can limit - and\nhistorically, did limit - the accuracy of X-ray spectroscopic measurements.\n  We revised the status of the cross-calibration among the scientific payload\non board four operation missions: Chandra, NuSTAR, XMM-Newton, and the recently\nlaunched XRISM. XRISM carries the micro-calorimeter Resolve, which yields the\nbest energy resolution at energies above 2 keV.

We explore\nthe foundational principles of P-t-E, detailing its core components - the\nPlanner and the Executor - and its architectural advantages in predictability,\ncost-efficiency, and reasoning quality over reactive patterns like ReAct\n(Reason + Act). A central focus is placed on the security implications of this\ndesign, particularly its inherent resilience to indirect prompt injection\nattacks by establishing control-flow integrity. We argue that while P-t-E\nprovides a strong foundation, a defense-in-depth strategy is necessary, and we\ndetail essential complementary controls such as the Principle of Least\nPrivilege, task-scoped tool access, and sandboxed code execution. To make these\nprinciples actionable, this guide provides detailed implementation blueprints\nand working code references for three leading agentic frameworks: LangChain\n(via LangGraph), CrewAI, and AutoGen.

This changed with the successful Sunrise III flight in 2024, when\nspectro-polarimetric data were recorded with high spatial, spectral, and\ntemporal resolution covering a large variety of solar targets. The aim of this\nwork is to investigate the formation of the lines and lay the groundwork for\nfurther studies. We compute the spectrum of the lines at 358.12 nm, 371.99 nm,\n406.36 nm, and 407.17 nm emerging from the standard 1D FAL-atmospheres using\nthe non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) radiative transfer code RH. We\nfind that the lines are affected by overionization in the wings, but have line\ncores strongly affected by scattering. The line cores form well into the\nchromosphere in the tested atmosphere models except the colder FALX model where\nthe line core forms in the temperature minimum (which lies at traditional\nchromospheric heights). In the presence of a vertical magnetic field, the\nStokes $V$ signal is multi-lobed. The profile can be decomposed into two broad\nphotospheric lobes and two sharper lobes forming in the flanks of the\nchromospheric line core. We have investigated the properties of four lines of\nFe I that form in the lower chromosphere.

    "abstract": "Specialized machine learning models, regardless of architecture and training,\nare susceptible to failures in deployment. With their increasing use in high\nrisk situations, the ability to audit these models by determining their\noperational design domain (ODD) is crucial in ensuring safety and compliance.\nHowever, given the high-dimensional input spaces, this process often requires\nsignificant human resources and domain expertise. To alleviate this, we\nintroduce \\coolname, an LLM-Agent centric framework for automated generation of\nsemantically relevant test cases to search for failure modes in specialized\nblack-box models. By leveraging LLM-Agents as tool orchestrators, we aim to fit\na uncertainty-aware failure distribution model on a learned text-embedding\nmanifold by projecting the high-dimension input space to low-dimension\ntext-embedding latent space. The LLM-Agent is tasked with iteratively building\nthe failure landscape by leveraging tools for generating test-cases to probe\nthe model-under-test (MUT) and recording the response. The agent also guides\nthe search using tools to probe uncertainty estimate on the low dimensional\nmanifold. We demonstrate this process in a simple case using models trained\nwith missing digits on the MNIST dataset and in the real world setting of\nvision-based intruder detection for aerial vehicles.",

    "abstract": "Particle-induced wear is a critical concern in bulk material handling\nsystems, where abrasive interactions accelerate equipment degradation, increase\nmaintenance needs, and raise operational costs. The Discrete Element Method\n(DEM) and Archard's wear model are widely adopted for predicting\nparticle-surface wear processes. However, DEM is computationally prohibitive\nfor real-time design and predictive maintenance, often requiring hours to days\nfor a single parametric analysis. We propose a DEM-machine learning (ML)\nframework to address this limitation that combines physics-based simulations\nwith data-driven efficiency. A dataset of 200 DEM simulations is generated by\nsystematically varying particle size, material, and contacting plate geometric\nparameters. A few ML models -- linear regression, Lasso and Ridge\nregularization, decision trees, and a genetic algorithm-optimized artificial\nneural network (GA-ANN) -- were trained and evaluated. Feature selection\nrevealed that Archard's wear constant, particle size, plate angle, and\nimpingement velocity are the dominant predictors of wear. While linear models\noffered interpretability, their accuracy was limited. The GA-ANN achieved the\nhighest performance $(R^2 = 0.91)$, effectively capturing nonlinear wear\ndynamics while reducing computational cost by orders of magnitude. This study\ndemonstrates that physics-informed ML provides a scalable pathway for accurate,\nreal-time wear prediction, enabling predictive maintenance and optimized design\nin bulk material handling industries.",

In this work, we propose a new contact algorithm that\ncomputes contact forces by taking the gradient of an energy function of the\ncontact volume (overlap) with respect to the geometry descriptors. While\nelegant in concept, evaluating this gradient is non-trivial due to the\narbitrary geometry of the contact region. Inspired by the recently proposed\nFiber Monte Carlo (FMC) method, we develop an algorithm that accurately\ncomputes contact forces based on the overlap volume between bodies with complex\ngeometries. Our computational framework operates independently of mesh\nconformity, eliminating the need for master-slave identification and projection\niterations, thus handling arbitrary discretizations. Moreover, by removing\nexplicit complementarity constraints, the method retains a simple structure\nthat can be easily incorporated into existing numerical solvers, such as the\nfinite element method. In this paper, numerical examples cover a wide range of\ncontact scenarios, from classical small-deformation static contact to complex\nlarge-deformation dynamic contact in both two- and three-dimensional settings\nwith nonlinear material behavior.

Comprehensive evaluation on\ndiverse asteroid models including Bennu, Eros, Itokawa, and synthetic\nplanetesimals demonstrates that MasconCubes achieve superior performance across\nmultiple metrics. Most notably, MasconCubes demonstrate computational\nefficiency advantages with training times approximately 40 times faster than\nGeodesyNets while maintaining physical interpretability through explicit mass\ndistributions.

Methods: Open-access\ndata from 151 adults wearing a wrist-worn accelerometer (Axivity-AX3) was used.\nParticipants were randomly divided into training, validation, and test sets\n(121, 15, and 15 participants each). Raw acceleration signals were segmented\ninto non-overlapping 10-second windows, and then a total of 104 handcrafted\nfeatures were extracted. Four DL algorithms-Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM),\nBidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and\nOne-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN)-were trained using raw\nacceleration signals and with handcrafted features extracted from these signals\nto predict 24-hour movement behavior categories. The handcrafted features were\nalso used to train classical ML algorithms, namely Random Forest (RF), Support\nVector Machine (SVM), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Logistic Regression\n(LR), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Decision Tree (DT) for classifying\n24-hour movement behavior intensities. Results: LSTM, BiLSTM, and GRU showed an\noverall accuracy of approximately 85% when trained with raw acceleration\nsignals, and 1D-CNN an overall accuracy of approximately 80%. When trained on\nhandcrafted features, the overall accuracy for both DL and classical ML\nalgorithms ranged from 70% to 81%. Overall, there was a higher confusion in\nclassification of MVPA and LPA, compared to sleep and sedentary categories.\nConclusion: DL methods with raw acceleration signals had only slightly better\nperformance in predicting 24-hour movement behavior intensities, compared to\nwhen DL and classical ML were trained with handcrafted features.",

In this study, we present the first comprehensive evaluation of\nmemorization of LLMs in medicine, assessing its prevalence (how frequently it\noccurs), characteristics (what is memorized), volume (how much content is\nmemorized), and potential downstream impacts (how memorization may affect\nmedical applications).

The\nresults demonstrate that memorization is prevalent across all adaptation\nscenarios and significantly higher than reported in the general domain.\nMemorization affects both the development and adoption of LLMs in medicine and\ncan be categorized into three types: beneficial (e.g., accurate recall of\nclinical guidelines and biomedical references), uninformative (e.g., repeated\ndisclaimers or templated medical document language), and harmful (e.g.,\nregeneration of dataset-specific or sensitive clinical content).

We seek to optimize hundreds of radiosurgery treatment\nplans, corresponding to different weightings of objectives, fast enough to\nincorporate interactive Pareto navigation of clinical trade-offs into the\nclinical workflow. We apply the alternating direction method of multipliers\n(ADMM) to the linear-program formulation of the optimization problem used in\nLightning. We implement both a CPU and a GPU version of ADMM in Matlab and\ncompare them to Matlab's built-in, single-threaded dual-simplex solver. The\nADMM implementation is adapted to the optimization procedure used in the\nclinical software, with a bespoke algorithm for maximizing overlap between\nlow-dose points for different objective weights. The method is evaluated on a\ntest dataset consisting of 20 cases from three different indications, with\nbetween one and nine targets and total target volumes ranging from 0.66 to 52\ncm3, yielding speedups of 1.6-97 and 54-1500 times on CPU and GPU,\nrespectively, compared to simplex. Plan quality was evaluated by rerunning the\nADMM optimization 20 times, each with a different random seed, for each test\ncase and for nine objective weightings per case. The resulting clinical metrics\nclosely mimicked those obtained when rerunning the simplex solver, verifying\nthe validity of the method. In conclusion, we show how ADMM can be adapted for\nradiosurgery plan optimization, allowing hundreds of high-quality Gamma Knife\ntreatment plans to be created in under two minutes on a single GPU, also for\nvery large cases.",

By way of\nexplicit examples, we show that neither condition by itself is strong enough to\nguarantee physically reasonable behavior for ideal isotropic elasticity.

Both scenarios are proven through the\nconstruction of appropriate strain-energy functions. Consequently, a\ncombination of polyconvexity, ensuring Legendre-Hadamard ellipticity, and\nTSTS-M${}^{++}\\!$ seems to be a viable solution to Truesdell's Hauptproblem.\nHowever, so far no isotropic strain-energy function has been identified that\nsatisfies both constraints globally at the same time.

We analyze the TCC for a large class of dynamical\nspherically symmetric spacetimes, and show that it decomposes into three\nindependent conditions on the Misner-Sharp mass function. For stationary black\nholes only two of these are non-trivial.

We show that generic asymptotically flat regular black holes\nwith a smooth de Sitter core locally violate this new TCC-induced condition\nnear the core, even if they globally satisfy the other condition imposed by the\nNCC. Therefore, it is the violation of the TCC which ensures that regular de\nSitter core black holes circumvent the Hawking-Penrose theorem. By contrast, we\nshow that asymptotically flat regular black holes with an anti-de Sitter core\nlocally satisfy the new TCC-induced condition near the core, but necessarily\nviolate it at some finite distance away from it.

Adopting\na random-matrix perspective on the entanglement Hamiltonian, we show that\nshort-range spectral correlations, such as the adjacent gap ratio $\\langle\n\\tilde r\\rangle$ and the Kullback-Leibler divergence $KL_1$, sharply detect an\nergodic to non-ergodic phase transition at the quantum Lifshitz fixed point,\nand yield precise estimates of the critical point and correlation length\nexponent. Long-range probes, including the spectral form factor and the\nassociated Thouless time, corroborate this picture, while the variant $KL_2$\nuncovers signatures of a possible non-ergodic extended (multifractal) regime at\nintermediate monitoring strengths.

    "abstract": "Timely and robust influenza incidence forecasting is critical for public\nhealth decision-making. To address this, we present MAESTRO, a Multi-modal\nAdaptive Ensemble for Spectro-Temporal Robust Optimization. MAESTRO achieves\nrobustness by adaptively fusing multi-modal inputs-including surveillance, web\nsearch trends, and meteorological data-and leveraging a comprehensive\nspectro-temporal architecture. The model first decomposes time series into\nseasonal and trend components. These are then processed through a hybrid\nfeature enhancement pipeline combining Transformer-based encoders, a Mamba\nstate-space model for long-range dependencies, multi-scale temporal\nconvolutions, and a frequency-domain analysis module. A cross-channel attention\nmechanism further integrates information across the different data modalities.\nFinally, a temporal projection head performs sequence-to-sequence forecasting,\nwith an optional estimator to quantify prediction uncertainty. Evaluated on\nover 11 years of Hong Kong influenza data (excluding the COVID-19 period),\nMAESTRO shows strong competitive performance, demonstrating a superior model\nfit and relative accuracy, achieving a state-of-the-art R-square of 0.956.\nExtensive ablations confirm the significant contributions of both multi-modal\nfusion and the spectro-temporal components. Our modular and reproducible\npipeline is made publicly available to facilitate deployment and extension to\nother regions and pathogens.Our publicly available pipeline presents a\npowerful, unified framework, demonstrating the critical synergy of advanced\nspectro-temporal modeling and multi-modal data fusion for robust\nepidemiological forecasting.",

Large-scale thermal energy storage offers a\nsolution by storing surplus summer heat for use during winter, thus reducing\nthe need for fossil fuels. This study investigates the feasibility of a\nlarge-scale thermal storage system at a power production site that supplies a\nlarge district heating network in the city of Bern, Switzerland.

Using a Python-based multi-energy system model, we simulate the\noptimal operation of the geothermal storage system with respect to cost and\nemissions, considering both supply and demand on an hourly basis over one year.\nMulti-objective optimisation is applied to generate a Pareto-optimal front. The\nresults show that the geothermal storage system eliminates the requirement of 8\nGWh of gas-powered heat supply and increases the waste heat utilisation by 20%,\ntherefore lowering emissions. This effect is further increased when combined\nwith an expansion of the district heating network, as individual,\nemission-heavy heaters are replaced by low-emission heat from the district\nheating network.

    "abstract": "Substantial progress has recently been made in the understanding of the\ncutoff phenomenon for Markov processes, using an information-theoretic\nstatistics known as varentropy [Sal23; Sal24; Sal25a; PS25]. In the present\npaper, we propose an alternative approach which bypasses the use of varentropy\nand exploits instead a new W-TV transport inequality, combined with a classical\nparabolic regularization estimate [BGL01; OV01]. While currently restricted to\nnon-negatively curved processes on smooth spaces, our argument no longer\nrequires the chain rule, nor any approximate version thereof. As applications,\nwe recover the main result of [Sal25a] establishing cutoff for the log-concave\nLangevin dynamics, and extend the conclusion to a widely-used discrete-time\nsampling algorithm known as the Proximal Sampler.",

    "abstract": "Nonsmooth Riemannian optimization has attracted increasing attention,\nespecially in problems with sparse structures. While existing formulations\ntypically involve convex nonsmooth terms, incorporating nonsmooth\ndifference-of-convex (DC) penalties can enhance recovery accuracy. In this\npaper, we study a class of nonsmooth Riemannian optimization problems whose\nobjective is the sum of a smooth function and a nonsmooth DC term. We\nestablish, for the first time in the manifold setting, the equivalence between\nsuch DC formulations (with suitably chosen nonsmooth DC terms) and their\n$\\ell_0$-regularized or $\\ell_0$-constrained counterparts. To solve these\nproblems, we propose an inexact Riemannian proximal DC (iRPDC) algorithmic\nframework, which returns an $\\epsilon$-Riemannian critical point within\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-2})$ outer iterations. Within this framework, we\ndevelop several practical algorithms based on different subproblem solvers.\nAmong them, one achieves an overall iteration complexity of\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-3})$, which matches the best-known bound in the\nliterature. In contrast, existing algorithms either lack provable overall\ncomplexity or require $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-3})$ iterations in both outer and\noverall complexity. A notable feature of the iRPDC algorithmic framework is a\nnovel inexactness criterion that not only enables efficient subproblem\nsolutions via first-order methods but also facilitates a linesearch procedure\nthat adaptively captures the local curvature. Numerical results on sparse\nprincipal component analysis demonstrate the modeling flexibility of the DC\nformulaton and the competitive performance of the proposed algorithmic\nframework.",

    "abstract": "The nuclear quadrupole collective states at low excitation energies are\ndescribed in a novel, fully quantum mechanical and systematic manner as\ncompared to traditional pictures initiated by Aage Bohr. The ellipsoidal shapes\nare shown to be triaxial in virtually all strongly deformed nuclei, in contrast\nto the Ansatz of axially symmetric shapes. The rotational bands of such\ntriaxially deformed nuclei are described in a fully quantum mechanical way, i.\ne., without resorting to quantized free rotation of rigid body. The excitation\nenergies within a rotational band, exhibiting the $J(J+1)$ dependence on\nangular momentum $J$, are shown to basically represent the change of binding\nenergies due to nuclear forces. This differs from the interpretation \\'a la\nAage Bohr as rotational kinetic energies. The $K$ quantum numbers are shown to\nbe practically conserved for triaxial ellipsoids, which turned out to be a real\nbut positive surprise to many people in the field. The so-called $\\gamma$ bands\nare shown to be $K$=2$^+$ rotations rather than $\\gamma$-vibrations, leading to\na nice description of the so-called $\\gamma\\gamma$ 4$^+$ state as a $K$=4$^+$\nrotation. Vibrational modes are also shown to emerge in this study. Thus, the\nwhole picture of low-energy quadrupole collective motion of heavy nuclei has\nbeen renewed in a fully quantum mechanical fashion, which differs from the\ntraditional picture but appears to be simpler and more natural.",

The structure of a molecule is closely related to its\nvibrational absorption spectrum, which lies in the infrared (IR) range.\nHowever, in vivo IR spectroscopy is hindered by interference from the\nsurrounding water. Therefore, peptides are preferably studied isolated from\nsolution, in the gas phase. This chapter summarizes the recent IR spectroscopy\nstudies of gas-phase peptides. The collected works show that IR spectroscopy\ncombined with quantum chemical calculations is a powerful tool for deducing the\nmolecular structure. Moreover the wealth of experimental spectra makes possible\nthe evaluation of different quantum chemical models, which can be applied to\nthe larger proteins.",

    "abstract": "The focus of this work is on the homogeneous and non-homogeneous Dirichlet\nproblem for the Laplacian in bounded Lipschitz domains (BLD). Although it has\nbeen extensively studied by many authors, we would like to return to a number\nof fundamental questions and known results, such as the traces and the maximal\nregularity of solutions. First, to treat non-homogeneous boundary conditions,\nwe rigorously define the notion of traces for non regular functions. This\napproach replaces the non-tangential trace notion that has dominated the\nliterature since the 1980s. We identify a functional space E = \\{v\\in\nH^{1/2}(\\Omega);\\nabla v\\in [H^1/2(\\Omega)]'\\} for which the trace operator is\ncontinuous from $E$ into $L^2(\\Gamma)$. Second, we address the regularity of\nsolutions to the Laplace equation with homogeneous Dirichlet conditions. Using\nspecific equivalent norms in fractional Sobolev spaces and Grisvard's results\nfor polygons and polyhedral domains, we prove that maximal regularity $H^{3/2}$\nholds in any BLD $\\Omega$, for all right-hand sides in the dual of\n$H^{1/2}_{00}(\\Omega)$. This conclusion contradicts the prevailing claims in\nthe literature since the 1990s. Third, we describe some criteria which\nestablish new uniqueness results for harmonic functions in Lipschitz domains.\nIn particular, we show that if $u\\in H^{1/2}(\\Omega)$ or $u\\in W^{1,\n2N/(N+1)}(\\Omega)$, is harmonic in $\\Omega$ and vanishes on $\\Gamma$, then $u=\n0$. These criteria play a central role in deriving regularity properties.\nFinally, we revisit the classical Area Integral Estimate. Using Grisvard's work\nand an explicit function given by Necas, we show that this inequality cannot\nhold in its stated form. Since this estimate has been widely used to argue that\n$H^{3/2}$-regularity is unattainable for data in the dual of\n$H^{1/2}_{00}(\\Omega)$, our counterexample provides a decisive clarification.",

However, their\nscalability to Large Language Models (LLMs) is fundamentally constrained by\ntheir vast parameter sizes. Notably, LLaMA-7B - the smallest model in LLaMA\nseries - demands more than 1,000 cm2 of silicon area even in advanced CMOS\nnodes. This paper presents BitROM, the first CiROM-based accelerator that\novercomes this limitation through co-design with BitNet's 1.58-bit quantization\nmodel, enabling practical and efficient LLM inference at the edge. BitROM\nintroduces three key innovations: 1) a novel Bidirectional ROM Array that\nstores two ternary weights per transistor; 2) a Tri-Mode Local Accumulator\noptimized for ternary-weight computations; and 3) an integrated Decode-Refresh\n(DR) eDRAM that supports on-die KV-cache management, significantly reducing\nexternal memory access during decoding. In addition, BitROM integrates\nLoRA-based adapters to enable efficient transfer learning across various\ndownstream tasks. Evaluated in 65nm CMOS, BitROM achieves 20.8 TOPS/W and a bit\ndensity of 4,967 kB/mm2 - offering a 10x improvement in area efficiency over\nprior digital CiROM designs. Moreover, the DR eDRAM contributes to a 43.6%\nreduction in external DRAM access, further enhancing deployment efficiency for\nLLMs in edge applications.",

However, we argue that\nthere are two limitations in the current methods that result in noisy\nmultilingual preference data and further limited alignment performance: 1) Not\nall English responses are of high quality, and using a response with low\nquality may mislead the alignment for other languages. 2) Current methods\nusually use biased or heuristic approaches to construct multilingual preference\npairs. To address these limitations, we design a consistency-based data\nselection method to construct high-quality multilingual preference data for\nimproving multilingual alignment (CM-Align). Specifically, our method includes\ntwo parts: consistency-guided English reference selection and cross-lingual\nconsistency-based multilingual preference data construction.

A second manipulation happened afterwards, confronting\nparticipants with either a successful or failed investment. Overall, our\nresults show that the level of quality assurance of the advisor had\nsurprisingly near to no effect of any of our outcome variables, except for\npeople's perception of their own mental model of the advisor.

Success or failure\ninformation, though influences only partially by advisor quality, has been\nperceived as a more important clue for advisor trustworthiness, leading to\nsubstantially different trust and dependability ratings. The study shows the\nimportance of thoroughly investigating not only trust, but also trusting\nbehavior with objective measures.

To accommodate such nonuniform\nmotion constraints, we build upon our earlier work and extend the use of Mobius\ntransformation to a multi-agent framework. The Mobius transformation maps two\nnonconcentric circles to concentric ones, thereby converting spatially\nnonuniform constraints into uniform ones in the transformed plane. Leveraging\nthis property, we introduce the notion of a phase-shifted order parameter,\nalong with the associated concepts of Mobius phase-shift coupled\nsynchronization and balancing, which characterize the phase-coordinated\npatterns studied in this paper. We establish an equivalence between the\nunicycle dynamics in the original and transformed planes under the Mobius\ntransformation and its inverse, and show that synchronization is preserved\nacross both planes, whereas balancing is generally not. Distributed control\nlaws are then designed in the transformed plane using barrier Lyapunov\nfunctions, under the assumption of an undirected and connected communication\ntopology among agents. These controllers are subsequently mapped back to the\noriginal plane to obtain the linear acceleration and turn-rate control inputs\napplied to the actual agents.

Using tensor network methods, we simulate the real-time\nstring dynamics of a $2\\!+\\!1$D SU$(2)$ Yang--Mills LGT with dynamical matter.\nIn the strong-coupling regime and at resonance, string breaking occurs through\nsharp Casimir reduction along with meson and baryon-antibaryon formation, a\ndistinctively non-Abelian feature. At finite baryon density, we discover a\n\\textit{baryon blockade} mechanism that delays string breaking. Away from\nresonance, the magnetic term drives purely non-Abelian fluctuations: glueball\nloops and self-crossed strings that resolve two SU$(2)$ intertwiners with\ndistinct dynamics.

This inevitably introduces substantial noise, which\ncan either prolong acquisition times and make scan durations infeasible or\ndegrade image quality with strong noise artifacts. To address this challenge,\nwe present a dedicated neural network-based denoising approach tailored for\nmultispectral CT projections acquired at the BM18 beamline of the ESRF. The\nmethod exploits redundancies across angular, spatial, and spectral domains\nthrough specialized sub-networks combined via stacked generalization and an\nattention mechanism.

Training was performed exclusively on simulated data replicating the\nphysical and noise characteristics of the BM18 setup, with validation conducted\non CT scans of custom-designed phantoms containing both high-Z and low-Z\nmaterials. The denoised projections and reconstructions demonstrate substantial\nimprovements in image quality compared to classical denoising methods and\nbaseline CNN models.

    "abstract": "Path planning in dynamic environments remains a core challenge in robotics,\nespecially as autonomous systems are deployed in unpredictable spaces such as\nwarehouses and public roads. While algorithms like Fast Marching Tree\n(FMT$^{*}$) offer asymptotically optimal solutions in static settings, their\nsingle-pass design prevents path revisions which are essential for real-time\nadaptation. On the other hand, full replanning is often too computationally\nexpensive. This paper introduces FMT$^{x}$, an extension of the Fast Marching\nTree algorithm that enables efficient and consistent replanning in dynamic\nenvironments. We revisit the neighbor selection rule of FMT$^{*}$ and\ndemonstrate that a minimal change overcomes its single-pass limitation,\nenabling the algorithm to update cost-to-come values upon discovering better\nconnections without sacrificing asymptotic optimality or computational\nefficiency. By maintaining a cost-ordered priority queue and applying a\nselective update condition that uses an expanding neighbor to identify and\ntrigger the re-evaluation of any node with a potentially suboptimal path,\nFMT$^{x}$ ensures that suboptimal routes are efficiently repaired as the\nenvironment evolves. This targeted strategy preserves the inherent efficiency\nof FMT$^{*}$ while enabling robust adaptation to changes in obstacle\nconfiguration. FMT$^{x}$ is proven to recover an asymptotically optimal\nsolution after environmental changes. Experimental results demonstrate that\nFMT$^{x}$ outperforms the influential replanner RRT$^{x}$, reacting more\nswiftly to dynamic events with lower computational overhead and thus offering a\nmore effective solution for real-time robotic navigation in unpredictable\nworlds.",

    "abstract": "Generative thermal design for complex geometries is fundamental in many areas\nof engineering, yet it faces two main challenges: the high computational cost\nof high-fidelity simulations and the limitations of conventional generative\nmodels. Approaches such as autoencoders (AEs) and variational autoencoders\n(VAEs) often produce unstructured latent spaces with discontinuities, which\nrestricts their capacity to explore designs and generate physically consistent\nsolutions.\n  To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid framework that combines\nVariational Rank-Reduction Autoencoders (VRRAEs) with Deep Operator Networks\n(DeepONets). The VRRAE introduces a truncated SVD within the latent space,\nleading to continuous, interpretable, and well-structured representations that\nmitigate posterior collapse and improve geometric reconstruction. The DeepONet\nthen exploits this compact latent encoding in its branch network, together with\nspatial coordinates in the trunk network, to predict temperature gradients\nefficiently and accurately.\n  This hybrid approach not only enhances the quality of generated geometries\nand the accuracy of gradient prediction, but also provides a substantial\nadvantage in inference efficiency compared to traditional numerical solvers.\nOverall, the study underscores the importance of structured latent\nrepresentations for operator learning and highlights the potential of combining\ngenerative models and operator networks in thermal design and broader\nengineering applications.",

    "abstract": "Human-AI collaboration increasingly drives decision-making across industries,\nfrom medical diagnosis to content moderation. While AI systems promise\nefficiency gains by providing automated suggestions for human review, these\nworkflows can trigger cognitive biases that degrade performance. We know little\nabout the psychological factors that determine when these collaborations\nsucceed or fail. We conducted a randomized experiment with 2,784 participants\nto examine how task design and individual characteristics shape human responses\nto AI-generated suggestions. Using a controlled annotation task, we manipulated\nthree factors: AI suggestion quality in the first three instances, task burden\nthrough required corrections, and performance-based financial incentives. We\ncollected demographics, attitudes toward AI, and behavioral data to assess four\nperformance metrics: accuracy, correction activity, overcorrection, and\nundercorrection. Two patterns emerged that challenge conventional assumptions\nabout human-AI collaboration. First, requiring corrections for flagged AI\nerrors reduced engagement and increased the tendency to accept incorrect\nsuggestions, demonstrating how cognitive shortcuts influence collaborative\noutcomes. Second, individual attitudes toward AI emerged as the strongest\npredictor of performance, surpassing demographic factors. Participants\nskeptical of AI detected errors more reliably and achieved higher accuracy,\nwhile those favorable toward automation exhibited dangerous overreliance on\nalgorithmic suggestions. The findings reveal that successful human-AI\ncollaboration depends not only on algorithmic performance but also on who\nreviews AI outputs and how review processes are structured. Effective human-AI\ncollaborations require consideration of human psychology: selecting diverse\nevaluator samples, measuring attitudes, and designing workflows that counteract\ncognitive biases.",

To measure such time-sensitivity, we introduce a\nnew task: chiral action recognition, where one needs to distinguish between a\npair of temporally opposite actions, such as \"opening vs. closing a door\",\n\"approaching vs. moving away from something\", \"folding vs. unfolding paper\",\netc. Such actions (i) occur frequently in everyday life, (ii) require\nunderstanding of simple visual change over time (in object state, size, spatial\nposition, count . . . ), and (iii) are known to be poorly represented by many\nvideo embeddings. Our goal is to build time aware video representations which\noffer linear separability between these chiral pairs. To that end, we propose a\nself-supervised adaptation recipe to inject time-sensitivity into a sequence of\nfrozen image features. Our model is based on an auto-encoder with a latent\nspace with inductive bias inspired by perceptual straightening. We show that\nthis results in a compact but time-sensitive video representation for the\nproposed task across three datasets: Something-Something, EPIC-Kitchens, and\nCharade.

Although supervised fine-tuned models can better align\nwith the real physical world, they still exhibit sluggish responses and\nhallucination issues in dynamically changing environments, necessitating\nfurther alignment. Existing post-SFT methods, reliant on reinforcement learning\nand chain-of-thought (CoT) approaches, are constrained by sparse rewards and\naction-only optimization, resulting in low sample efficiency, poor consistency,\nand model degradation. To address these issues, this paper proposes\nThought-Centric Preference Optimization (TCPO) for effective embodied\ndecision-making. Specifically, TCPO introduces a stepwise preference-based\noptimization approach, transforming sparse reward signals into richer step\nsample pairs. It emphasizes the alignment of the model's intermediate reasoning\nprocess, mitigating the problem of model degradation. Moreover, by\nincorporating Action Policy Consistency Constraint (APC), it further imposes\nconsistency constraints on the model output. Experiments in the ALFWorld\nenvironment demonstrate an average success rate of 26.67%, achieving a 6%\nimprovement over RL4VLM and validating the effectiveness of our approach in\nmitigating model degradation after fine-tuning.

    "abstract": "Optimization has been an important factor and topic of interest in training\ndeep learning models, yet less attention has been given to how we select the\noptimizers we use to train these models. Hence, there is a need to dive deeper\ninto how we select the optimizers we use for training and the metrics that\ndetermine this selection. In this work, we compare the performance of 10\ndifferent optimizers in training a simple Multi-layer Perceptron model using a\nheart disease dataset from Kaggle. We set up a consistent training paradigm and\nevaluate the optimizers based on metrics such as convergence speed and\nstability. We also include some other Machine Learning Evaluation metrics such\nas AUC, Precision, and Recall, which are central metrics to classification\nproblems. Our results show that there are trade-offs between convergence speed\nand stability, as optimizers like Adagrad and Adadelta, which are more stable,\ntook longer time to converge. Across all our metrics, we chose RMSProp to be\nthe most effective optimizer for this heart disease prediction task because it\noffered a balanced performance across key metrics. It achieved a precision of\n0.765, a recall of 0.827, and an AUC of 0.841, along with faster training time.\nHowever, it was not the most stable. We recommend that, in less\ncompute-constrained environments, this method of choosing optimizers through a\nthorough evaluation should be adopted to increase the scientific nature and\nperformance in training deep learning models.",

While this\nproperty makes triplet emitters interesting for organic light-emitting diodes\n(OLEDs), the study of their luminescence at the single molecule level in high\nresolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) is challenging. We investigate\nindividual Pd-octaethylporphyrin (PdOEP) molecules decoupled from Ag(100) and\nAg(111) by an ultrathin NaCl layer and observe singlet and triplet emission\nlines at visible wavelengths, only about 100 nm apart from each other.

The singlet S1 state of\nPdOEP emits photons even when the photon energy is higher than the energy\nprovided by a tunneling electron, in an energy up-conversion process. This\nmechanism requires a relay (or shelving) state in which energy is stored in the\nmolecule for the interval between tunneling electrons. Analyzing the energy\nlevels of different molecular states (S1, D0, and T1 states) and fitting the\ncurrent dependencies of S1 under up-conversion electroluminescence (UCEL)\ncondition for S1 and T1 emission, we verify the validity of a triplet-mediated\nup-conversion model.

Competition rules limited\nour sensor suite to stereo vision and an inertial sensor, similar to humans. In\naddition, our robot had to deal with varying lighting conditions, dynamic\nfeature occlusions, noise from high-impact stepping, and mistaken features from\nbystanders and neighboring fields. Therefore, we needed an accurate, and most\nimportantly robust localization algorithm that would be the foundation for our\npath-planning and game-strategy algorithms. CLAP achieves these requirements by\nclustering estimated states of our robot from pairs of field features to\nlocalize its global position and orientation. Correct state estimates naturally\ncluster together, while incorrect estimates spread apart, making CLAP resilient\nto noise and incorrect inputs. CLAP is paired with a particle filter and an\nextended Kalman filter to improve consistency and smoothness. Tests of CLAP\nwith other landmark-based localization methods showed similar accuracy.\nHowever, tests with increased false positive feature detection showed that CLAP\noutperformed other methods in terms of robustness with very little divergence\nand velocity jumps. Our localization performed well in competition, allowing\nour robot to shoot faraway goals and narrowly defend our goal.",

The Semtech SX1280 LoRa transceiver\npresents a promising solution for IoT localization. It combines low cost, low\npower, and precise ranging capability over distances of up to 1 km. However,\nthe ranging process requires two devices to be simultaneously active, one\ninitiating the ranging request and the other responding to it, which can lead\nto significant energy expenditure if not properly managed. Despite the\ntransceiver's excellent performance, no existing system-level framework\neffectively manages sleep-wake coordination and role assignment needed for\nenergy-efficient operation. This paper presents a coordination framework that\nsignificantly reduces power consumption while maintaining the inherent precise\nranging capability of the chip. The framework schedules short, synchronized\nwake-up windows between the initiator and the responder, allowing devices to\nremain in deep sleep for most of their duty cycle. This scheduling strategy\nminimizes reliance on precise continuous timing and mitigates drift in low-cost\noscillators. To validate the framework, we designed and developed custom nodes\nthat are compliant with the framework's protocol. Experimental results show\nthat the proposed approach allows a node to stay in ultra-low power mode and\nwake periodically to check for instructions. The node can remain in standby\nmode for up to nine months on a single coin cell battery and can perform\nranging operations on demand in near real-time, all while maintaining a\nlocalization accuracy within five meters.",

We show that when Bell\nexperiments are properly analysed through individual observer accounts, all\nmeasurements remain strictly local. Alice's and Bob's local measurements can be\nfully understood in terms of variables from their backward light cones,\nsatisfying relativistic causality. Correlations emerge only in the global\nperspective of an external observer Charlie when analyzing joint measurement\nstatistics -- a physical situation different from the individual space-like\nseparated measurements to which Bell's locality condition was originally\napplied.\n  Our central contribution is identifying a conceptual shortcoming in Bell's\nargument, namely, the illegitimate extension of local independence principles\nfrom individual measurements to correlation measurements. The fact that\nspace-like separated events cannot causally influence each other does not\njustify requiring statistical independence in global correlation analyses.\nMotivated by the formalism developed in the companion paper\n\\cite{NeeWaa-indisc}, we arrive at the construction of an explicit classical\nprobability model that reproduces all the experimental results of the Bell\nexperiment, including the violation of the CHSH inequality $S\\leq2$.",

Extensive experiments on three standard\nalignment benchmarks-Alpaca (Helpfulness), BeaverTails (Harmlessness), and\nTruthfulQA (Honesty)-demonstrate that TrinityX outperforms strong baselines,\nachieving relative improvements of 32.5% in win rate, 33.9% in safety score,\nand 28.4% in truthfulness. In addition, TrinityX reduces memory usage and\ninference latency by over 40% compared to prior MoE-based approaches. Ablation\nstudies highlight the importance of calibrated routing, and cross-model\nevaluations confirm TrinityX's generalization across diverse LLM backbones.",

To address these challenges, we propose the Sparse\nMixture-of-Experts Representation Integration Technique (Sparse MERIT), a\nflexible MTL framework that applies frame-wise expert routing over\nself-supervised speech representations. Sparse MERIT incorporates task-specific\ngating networks that dynamically select from a shared pool of experts for each\nframe, enabling parameter-efficient and task-adaptive representation learning.\nExperiments on the MSP-Podcast corpus show that Sparse MERIT consistently\noutperforms baseline models on both SER and SE tasks.

    "abstract": "The robustness of contrastive self-supervised learning (CSSL) for imbalanced\ndatasets is largely unexplored. CSSL usually makes use of \\emph{multi-view}\nassumptions to learn discriminatory features via similar and dissimilar data\nsamples. CSSL works well on balanced datasets, but does not generalize well for\nimbalanced datasets. In a very recent paper, as part of future work, Yann LeCun\npointed out that the self-supervised multiview framework can be extended to\ncases involving \\emph{more than two views}. Taking a cue from this insight we\npropose a theoretical justification based on the concept of \\emph{mutual\ninformation} to support the \\emph{more than two views} objective and apply it\nto the problem of dataset imbalance in self-supervised learning. The proposed\nmethod helps extract representative characteristics of the tail classes by\nsegregating between \\emph{intra} and \\emph{inter} discriminatory\ncharacteristics. We introduce a loss function that helps us to learn better\nrepresentations by filtering out extreme features. Experimental evaluation on a\nvariety of self-supervised frameworks (both contrastive and non-contrastive)\nalso prove that the \\emph{more than two view} objective works well for\nimbalanced datasets. We achieve a new state-of-the-art accuracy in\nself-supervised imbalanced dataset classification (2\\% improvement in\nCifar10-LT using Resnet-18, 5\\% improvement in Cifar100-LT using Resnet-18, 3\\%\nimprovement in Imagenet-LT (1k) using Resnet-50).",

However, the high mobility of\nsatellites, dynamic traffic patterns, and potential link failures pose\nsignificant challenges for efficient and resilient routing. To address these\nchallenges, we model the LEO satellite network as a time-varying graph\ncomprising a constellation of satellites and ground stations. Our objective is\nto minimize a weighted sum of average delay and packet drop rate. Each\nsatellite independently decides how to distribute its incoming traffic to\nneighboring nodes in real time. Given the infeasibility of finding optimal\nsolutions at scale, due to the exponential growth of routing options and\nuncertainties in link capacities, we propose SKYLINK, a novel fully distributed\nlearning strategy for link management in LEO satellite networks. SKYLINK\nenables each satellite to adapt to the time-varying network conditions,\nensuring real-time responsiveness, scalability to millions of users, and\nresilience to network failures, while maintaining low communication overhead\nand computational complexity. To support the evaluation of SKYLINK at global\nscale, we develop a new simulator for large-scale LEO satellite networks. For\n25.4 million users, SKYLINK reduces the weighted sum of average delay and drop\nrate by 29% compared to the bent-pipe approach, and by 92% compared to\nDijkstra. It lowers drop rates by 95% relative to k-shortest paths, 99%\nrelative to Dijkstra, and 74% compared to the bent-pipe baseline, while\nachieving up to 46% higher throughput.

Evaluating this performance necessitates the\nintegration of diverse metrics, including profitability indicators, loan growth\nrates, capital utilization efficiency, and more. Nevertheless, directly\ncomparing the financial performance across different banks presents a complex\nchallenge due to inherent disparities in their specific performance parameters.\nMulti-criteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques are frequently employed to\nnavigate this intricate assessment. This study undertakes a comparative\nanalysis of various MCDM approaches in evaluating bank financial performance.\nOur investigation encompasses both a comparison of methods for assigning\nweights to criteria and a comparison of methodologies for ranking the\nalternatives (banks). We examine five distinct weighting methods: Equal,\nEntropy, MEREC, LOPCOW, and SPC. Concurrently, three alternative ranking\nmethods Probability, TOPSIS, and RAM are compared. These comparisons are\nconducted within the context of a case study involving the performance\nassessment of 19 banks.

However, existing FL protocols\nstruggle to defend against Byzantine participants, maintain model utility under\nnon-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data, and remain\nlightweight for edge devices. Prior work either assumes trusted hardware, uses\nexpensive cryptographic tools, or fails to address privacy and robustness\nsimultaneously. We propose DSFL, a Dual-Server Byzantine-Resilient Federated\nLearning framework that addresses these limitations using a group-based secure\naggregation approach. Unlike LSFL, which assumes non-colluding semi-honest\nservers, DSFL removes this dependency by revealing a key vulnerability: privacy\nleakage through client-server collusion. DSFL introduces three key innovations:\n(1) a dual-server secure aggregation protocol that protects updates without\nencryption or key exchange, (2) a group-wise credit-based filtering mechanism\nto isolate Byzantine clients based on deviation scores, and (3) a dynamic\nreward-penalty system for enforcing fair participation. DSFL is evaluated on\nMNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 under up to 30 percent Byzantine participants in\nboth IID and non-IID settings. It consistently outperforms existing baselines,\nincluding LSFL, homomorphic encryption methods, and differential privacy\napproaches. For example, DSFL achieves 97.15 percent accuracy on CIFAR-10 and\n68.60 percent on CIFAR-100, while FedAvg drops to 9.39 percent under similar\nthreats. DSFL remains lightweight, requiring only 55.9 ms runtime and 1088 KB\ncommunication per round.",

    "abstract": "The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has observed compact, massive\nproto-stellar clusters of low metallicity in the Cosmic Gems arc galaxy at high\nredshift, which represent likely precursors to globular clusters. We model the\nmass growth of stellar black holes (BHs) during the first few Myr of the life\nof a massive, compact, gaseous stellar cluster before stellar feedback expels\nthe primordial gas. At high redshift, in a lower metallicity environment\nstellar winds get weaker allowing for larger gas-depletion time-scales in the\ncluster despite of energetic pair-instability supernova (PISN) feedback for\nsufficiently compact clusters. Mass segregation drives the massive stellar\nprogenitors of BHs in the center of the cluster where gas is most dense. We\nestimate the conditions for which the initial black hole mass function (BHMF),\nwith a PISN-induced cut-off $<55{\\rm M}_\\odot$, gets shifted to values within\nthe upper BH mass gap, $\\sim 60-130{\\rm M}_\\odot$, or higher, as observed by\nGravitational Wave (GW) experiments LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA. We find that the BHs are\nshifted by the end of gas depletion to values within and above the mass gap,\nwell within the range of BH components of the recent GW-signal GW231123,\ndepending on total mass, star formation efficiency, metallicity and\ncompactness. The individual BH mass increase follows approximately a\nsurprisingly steep power law with respect to initial BH mass with an exponent\nin the range $\\approx 4-6$. This occurs in gaseous proto-stellar clusters that\nare sufficiently massive and compact, with typical values of total mass $\\sim\n10^6{\\rm M}_\\odot$ and size $\\sim 1{\\rm pc}$.

We dedicate special\nattention to discuss the impact of shock evolution and particle propagation in\nthe near source region on the gamma ray emission. This is very important to\nassess the possibility that very high-energy protons may have been accelerated\nin past activity of Cas A. Given the core collapse nature of Cas A and its\nyoung age ($\\sim 340$ years), the non detection of $\\gtrsim 100$ TeV gamma rays\nfrom this remnant allows us to draw some conclusions on the role of supernova\nexplosions for the origin of cosmic rays at the knee. In particular we\ncalculate the spectrum of cosmic rays that may have escaped this remnant to\nmake a clear distinction between the instantaneous maximum energy and the one\nthat appears as a flux suppression in the time integrated spectrum from an\nindividual supernova. LHAASO observation of the region around Cas A as well as\ngamma ray observations of the remnant itself confirm that this remnant is not\noperating as a PeVatron and that, although in the early stages the maximum\nenergy may have reached $\\sim$Peta-electronVolt, the number of such particles\nin the surroundings of Cas A is exceedingly small.",

The operation management\nmechanism restricts modifications of the GDSL to atomic operations, making it\naccessible without requiring direct coding. The multimodal interaction\ninterface enables direct manipulation, natural language commands, and parameter\nadjustments. A multimodal large language model acts as a translator, converting\nthese inputs into GDSL operations.

Within a general Effective Field Theory (EFT)\nframework, we derive the helicity amplitudes for these processes at high\nenergies and identify the leading contributions from dimension-six operators\ninvolving different quark flavors. Using available LHC data, we show that these\nprocesses are sensitive to non-trivial flavor structures and provide\ncomplementary constraints to those from low-energy observables. We illustrate\nthis synergy through an explicit comparison between our LHC bounds with\nelectroweak precision data, and with flavor limits derived from charged-current\npion and kaon decays.

To address this challenge, we\npropose HyperTTA, a unified framework designed to enhance model robustness\nunder diverse degradation conditions. Specifically, we first construct a\nmulti-degradation hyperspectral dataset that systematically simulates nine\nrepresentative types of degradations, providing a comprehensive benchmark for\nrobust classification evaluation. Based on this, we design a spectral-spatial\ntransformer classifier (SSTC) enhanced with a multi-level receptive field\nmechanism and label smoothing regularization to jointly capture multi-scale\nspatial context and improve generalization. Furthermore, HyperTTA incorporates\na lightweight test-time adaptation (TTA) strategy, the confidence-aware\nentropy-minimized LayerNorm adapter (CELA), which updates only the affine\nparameters of LayerNorm layers by minimizing prediction entropy on\nhigh-confidence unlabeled target samples. This confidence-aware adaptation\nprevents unreliable updates from noisy predictions, enabling robust and dynamic\nadaptation without access to source data or target annotations. Extensive\nexperiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that HyperTTA outperforms\nexisting baselines across a wide range of degradation scenarios, validating the\neffectiveness of both its classification backbone and the proposed TTA scheme.\nCode will be made available publicly.",

This\nparadigm is often impractical for specialized robots where data is scarce and\ncreates an inefficient, theoretically suboptimal training pipeline. To overcome\nthis, we introduce PegasusFlow, a hierarchical rolling-denoising framework that\nenables direct and parallel sampling of trajectory score gradients from\nenvironmental interaction, completely bypassing the need for expert data. Our\ncore innovation is a novel sampling algorithm, Weighted Basis Function\nOptimization (WBFO), which leverages spline basis representations to achieve\nsuperior sample efficiency and faster convergence compared to traditional\nmethods like MPPI. The framework is embedded within a scalable, asynchronous\nparallel simulation architecture that supports massively parallel rollouts for\nefficient data collection. Extensive experiments on trajectory optimization and\nrobotic navigation tasks demonstrate that our approach, particularly\nAction-Value WBFO (AVWBFO) combined with a reinforcement learning warm-start,\nsignificantly outperforms baselines.

    "abstract": "For autonomous aerial vehicle (AAV) secure communications, traditional\ndesigns based on fixed position antenna (FPA) lack sufficient spatial degrees\nof freedom (DoF), which leaves the line-of-sight-dominated AAV links vulnerable\nto eavesdropping. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes a framework\nthat effectively incorporates the fluid antenna (FA) and the artificial noise\n(AN) techniques. Specifically, the minimum secrecy rate (MSR) among multiple\neavesdroppers is maximized by jointly optimizing AAV deployment, signal and AN\nprecoders, and FA positions. In particular, the worst-case MSR is considered by\ntaking the channel uncertainties due to the uncertainty about eavesdropping\nlocations into account. To tackle the highly coupled optimization variables and\nthe channel uncertainties in the formulated problem, an efficient and robust\nalgorithm is proposed. Particularly, the uncertain regions of eavesdroppers,\nwhose shapes can be arbitrary, are disposed by constructing convex hull. In\naddition, two movement modes of FAs are considered, namely, free movement mode\nand zonal movement mode, for which different optimization techniques are\napplied, respectively. Numerical results show that, the proposed FA schemes\nboost security by exploiting additional spatial DoF rather than transmit power,\nwhile AN provides remarkable gains under high transmit power. Furthermore, the\nsynergy between FA and AN results in a secure advantage that exceeds the sum of\ntheir individual contributions, achieving a balance between security and\nreliability under limited resources.",

However, this reactive approach may result in large\nSLA violations and an excessive number of corrective maintenance actions. In\nthis study, we utilize a predictive maintenance approach based on the\nreliability of a railcar. In particular, we propose a stochastic programming\nmodel, in which railcar failure scenarios are generated from a Weibull\ndistribution, a common assumption in the reliability literature.

We generate random instances to\ncompare the stochastic model and a deterministic model adopted from the\nliterature with respect to several system parameters. Our results show that the\nstochastic model achieves lower total costs, fewer SLA violations, and a\nreduced number of corrective interventions compared with deterministic\napproaches, while effectively managing track-capacity constraints.

    "abstract": "Video-based AI systems are increasingly adopted in safety-critical domains\nsuch as autonomous driving and healthcare. However, interpreting their\ndecisions remains challenging due to the inherent spatiotemporal complexity of\nvideo data and the opacity of deep learning models. Existing explanation\ntechniques often suffer from limited temporal coherence, insufficient\nrobustness, and a lack of actionable causal insights. Current counterfactual\nexplanation methods typically do not incorporate guidance from the target\nmodel, reducing semantic fidelity and practical utility. We introduce Latent\nDiffusion for Video Counterfactual Explanations (LD-ViCE), a novel framework\ndesigned to explain the behavior of video-based AI models. Compared to previous\napproaches, LD-ViCE reduces the computational costs of generating explanations\nby operating in latent space using a state-of-the-art diffusion model, while\nproducing realistic and interpretable counterfactuals through an additional\nrefinement step. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LD-ViCE\nacross three diverse video datasets, including EchoNet-Dynamic (cardiac\nultrasound), FERV39k (facial expression), and Something-Something V2 (action\nrecognition). LD-ViCE outperforms a recent state-of-the-art method, achieving\nan increase in R2 score of up to 68% while reducing inference time by half.\nQualitative analysis confirms that LD-ViCE generates semantically meaningful\nand temporally coherent explanations, offering valuable insights into the\ntarget model behavior. LD-ViCE represents a valuable step toward the\ntrustworthy deployment of AI in safety-critical domains.",

    "abstract": "Multi-View Multi-Object Tracking (MVMOT) is essential for applications such\nas surveillance, autonomous driving, and sports analytics. However, maintaining\nconsistent object identities across multiple cameras remains challenging due to\nviewpoint changes, lighting variations, and occlusions, which often lead to\ntracking errors.Recent methods project features from multiple cameras into a\nunified Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) space to improve robustness against occlusion.\nHowever, this projection introduces feature distortion and non-uniform density\ncaused by variations in object scale with distance. These issues degrade the\nquality of the fused representation and reduce detection and tracking\naccuracy.To address these problems, we propose SCFusion, a framework that\ncombines three techniques to improve multi-view feature integration. First, it\napplies a sparse transformation to avoid unnatural interpolation during\nprojection. Next, it performs density-aware weighting to adaptively fuse\nfeatures based on spatial confidence and camera distance. Finally, it\nintroduces a multi-view consistency loss that encourages each camera to learn\ndiscriminative features independently before fusion.Experiments show that\nSCFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching an IDF1 score of 95.9%\non WildTrack and a MODP of 89.2% on MultiviewX, outperforming the baseline\nmethod TrackTacular. These results demonstrate that SCFusion effectively\nmitigates the limitations of conventional BEV projection and provides a robust\nand accurate solution for multi-view object detection and tracking.",

Yet\nmaintaining equivariance is difficult: activation functions must be modified,\nand each layer must handle multiple data types for different harmonic orders.\nWe present Facet, a GNN architecture for efficient ML potentials, developed\nthrough systematic analysis of steerable GNNs. Our innovations include\nreplacing expensive multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) for interatomic distances\nwith splines, which match performance while cutting computational and memory\ndemands.

Also, most previous improved schemes\nsuffer from a relatively large exponent p of the ratio of global to local\nsmoothness indicators, which adversely affects the numerical resolution.\nConcerning these limitations, introduced here is an accuracy-optimization lemma\ndemonstrating that the accuracy of nonlinear weights can be enhanced providing\nthat smoothness indicators satisfy specific conditions, thereby establishing a\nmethodology for elevating the accuracy of nonlinear weights. Leveraging this\nlemma, a local smoothness indicator is constructed with error terms achieving\nsecond-order in smooth regions and fourth-order at CP1, alongside a global\nsmoothness indicator yielding fourth-order accuracy in smooth regions and\nfifth-order at CP1, enabling the derivation of new nonlinear weights that meet\naccuracy requirements even when employing p=1. Furthermore, a\nresolution-optimization lemma is proposed to analyze the relationship between\nparameters in local smoothness indicators and resolution. By integrating\ntheoretical analysis with numerical practices, free parameters in\nnon-normalized weights and local smoothness indicators are determined under the\nbalance of numerical resolution and robustness, which leads to the development\nof WENO3-ZES4, a new WENO3-Z improvement that preserves the optimal order at\nCP1 especially with p=1. 1D and 2D validating tests show that the new scheme\nconsistently achieves third-order in the case of CP1 regardless of its position\nand exhibits good resolution as well as preferable robustness.",

A locally deployed DeepSeek-R1 LLM is integrated\nwith an automatic planning algorithm in an iterative loop. Starting with fixed\nweights, the LLM evaluates plan quality and recommends new weights in the next\niteration. This process continues until convergence criteria are met, after\nwhich the LLM conducts a comprehensive evaluation to identify the optimal plan.\nA clinical knowledge base, constructed and queried via retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG), enhances the model's domain-specific reasoning. The proposed\nmethod was validated on 23 patient cases, showing that the LLM-assisted\napproach produces plans that are comparable to or exceeding clinically approved\nand fixed-weight plans, in terms of dose homogeneity for the clinical target\nvolume (CTV) and sparing of organs at risk (OARs).

FASE\nintroduces three key innovations to address three critical challenges for\nadapting FPGA-based syscall emulation: (1) only a minimal CPU interface is\nexposed, with other hardware components untouched, addressing the lack of a\nunified hardware interface in FPGA systems; (2) a Host-Target Protocol (HTP) is\nproposed to minimize cross-device data traffic, mitigating the low-bandwidth\nand high-latency communication between FPGA and host; and (3) a host-side\nruntime is proposed to remotely handle Linux-style system calls, addressing the\nchallenge of cross-device syscall delegation.\n  Experiments ware conducted on Xilinx FPGA with open-sourced RISC-V SMP\nprocessor Rocket. With single-thread CoreMark, FASE introduces less than 1%\nperformance error and achieves over 2000x higher efficiency compared to Proxy\nKernel due to FPGA acceleration.

During our investigation, graph VQ-MAE\nstands out among the increasingly diverse landscape of GFM architectures. This\nis attributed to its ability to jointly encode topology and textual attributes\nfrom multiple domains into discrete embedding spaces with clear semantic\nboundaries. Despite its potential, domain generalization conflicts cause\nimperceptible pitfalls. In this paper, we instantiate two of them, and they are\njust like two sides of the same GFM optimization coin - Side 1 Model\nDegradation: The encoder and codebook fail to capture the diversity of inputs;\nSide 2 Representation Collapse: The hidden embedding and codebook vector fail\nto preserve semantic separability due to constraints from narrow representation\nsubspaces. These two pitfalls (sides) collectively impair the decoder and\ngenerate the low-quality reconstructed supervision, causing the GFM\noptimization dilemma during pre-training (coin). Through empirical\ninvestigation, we attribute the above challenges to Information Bottleneck and\nRegularization Deficit. To address them, we propose MoT (Mixture-of-Tinkers) -\n(1) Information Tinker for Two Pitfalls, which utilizes an edge-wise semantic\nfusion strategy and a mixture-of-codebooks with domain-aware routing to improve\ninformation capacity.

    "abstract": "The $q$-plate is a spatially inhomogeneous SU(2) birefringent optical element\nthat has garnered significant interest due to its ability to mediate the\nspin-orbit interaction of light and facilitate the generation of optical\nvortices. The $q$-plate features a spatially varying fast axis orientation\ndefined by two parameters: the topological charge $q$ and the offset angle\n$\\alpha_0$. The notion of an effective waveplate arises when multiple\nwaveplates, whether homogeneous or inhomogeneous, are aligned coaxially such\nthat, under specific constraints, the composite system emulates the behavior of\na single effective waveplate. This work presents a comprehensive mathematical\nformalism for realizing an effective waveplate through a cascaded configuration\nof three $q$-plates, each chosen as either a quarter-wave $q$-plate, a\nhalf-wave $q$-plate, or a combination thereof. This yields a total of eight\ndistinct configurations. Some configurations result in an effective waveplate\nexhibiting a constant retardance, whereas others allow continuous modulation of\nthe effective retardance over the full range from $0$ to $2\\pi$ through the\nsystematic variation of the relative offset angles between the constituent\n$q$-plates. This feature enables holonomic polarization transformations on the\nhigher-order Poincar\\'e sphere, making the concept of the effective waveplate\napplicable to topological index spaces. Moreover, tunable effective retardance\nholds significant potential for applications involving structured light\ncorresponding to the higher-order Poincar\\'{e} sphere, particularly in\nscenarios demanding controlled spatial modulation of polarization states or\ndynamic tailoring of polarization topologies.",

The transport of the large-scale\nfield inside the disk plays an important role in understanding its evolution.\nWe aim to improve our understanding of the dependencies that stellar magnetic\nfields pose on the large-scale field. We focus on the innermost disk region\n($\\lesssim$ 0.1 AU), which is crucial for understanding the long-term disk\nevolution. We present a novel approach combining the evolution of a 1+1D\nhydrodynamic disk with a large-scale magnetic field, consisting of a stellar\ndipole truncating the disk and a fossil field. The magnetic flux transport\nincludes advection and diffusion due to laminar, non-ideal MHD effects, such as\nOhmic and ambipolar diffusion. Due to the implicit nature of the numerical\nmethod, long-term simulations (in the order of several viscous timescales) are\nfeasible. The large-scale magnetic field topology in stationary models shows a\ndistinct dependence on specific parameters. The innermost disk region is\nstrongly affected by the stellar rotation period and magnetic field strength.\nThe outer disk regions are affected by the X-ray luminosity and the fossil\nfield. Varying the mass flow through the disk affects the large-scale disk\nfield throughout its radial extent. The topology of the large-scale disk field\nis affected by several stellar and disk parameters. This will affect the\nefficiency of MHD outflows, which depend on the magnetic field topology.

    "abstract": "In real-world traffic surveillance, vehicle images captured under adverse\nweather, poor lighting, or high-speed motion often suffer from severe noise and\nblur. Such degradations significantly reduce the accuracy of license plate\nrecognition systems, especially when the plate occupies only a small region\nwithin the full vehicle image. Restoring these degraded images a fast realtime\nmanner is thus a crucial pre-processing step to enhance recognition\nperformance. In this work, we propose a Vertical Residual Autoencoder (VRAE)\narchitecture designed for the image enhancement task in traffic surveillance.\nThe method incorporates an enhancement strategy that employs an auxiliary\nblock, which injects input-aware features at each encoding stage to guide the\nrepresentation learning process, enabling better general information\npreservation throughout the network compared to conventional autoencoders.\nExperiments on a vehicle image dataset with visible license plates demonstrate\nthat our method consistently outperforms Autoencoder (AE), Generative\nAdversarial Network (GAN), and Flow-Based (FB) approaches. Compared with AE at\nthe same depth, it improves PSNR by about 20%, reduces NMSE by around 50%, and\nenhances SSIM by 1%, while requiring only a marginal increase of roughly 1% in\nparameters.",

However, publishing these data directly leads to privacy\nleaks. $w$-event privacy is a valuable tool to protect individual privacy\nwithin a given time window while maintaining high accuracy in data collection.\nMost existing $w$-event privacy studies on infinite data stream only focus on\nhomogeneous privacy requirements for all users. In this paper, we propose\npersonalized $w$-event privacy protection that allows different users to have\ndifferent privacy requirements in private data stream estimation. Specifically,\nwe design a mechanism that allows users to maintain constant privacy\nrequirements at each time slot, namely Personalized Window Size Mechanism\n(PWSM). Then, we propose two solutions to accurately estimate stream data\nstatistics while achieving $w$-event level $\\epsilon$ personalized differential\nprivacy ( ($w$, $\\epsilon$)-EPDP), namely Personalized Budget Distribution\n(PBD) and Peronalized Budget Absorption (PBA). PBD always provides at least the\nsame privacy budget for the next time step as the amount consumed in the\nprevious release. PBA fully absorbs the privacy budget from the previous $k$\ntime slots, while also borrowing from the privacy budget of the next $k$ time\nslots, to increase the privacy budget for the current time slot. We prove that\nboth PBD and PBA outperform the state-of-the-art private stream estimation\nmethods while satisfying the privacy requirements of all users. We demonstrate\nthe efficiency and effectiveness of our PBD and PBA on both real and synthetic\ndata sets, compared with the recent uniformity $w$-event approaches, Budget\nDistribution (BD) and Budget Absorption (BA). Our PBD achieves 68% less error\nthan BD on average on real data sets. Besides, our PBA achieves 24.9% less\nerror than BA on average on synthetic data sets.",

We prove strict monotonicity, ensuring that each angular momentum\nchannel contributes at most one eigenvalue per gap, and derive asymptotics\nshowing that the boundary coefficients decay faster than any exponential,\nexplaining the strong localization of the broadened spectrum.

    "abstract": "We propose a novel and general framework to disentangle video data into its\ndynamic motion and static content components. Our proposed method is a\nself-supervised pipeline with less assumptions and inductive biases than\nprevious works: it utilizes a transformer-based architecture to jointly\ngenerate flexible implicit features for frame-wise motion and clip-wise\ncontent, and incorporates a low-bitrate vector quantization as an information\nbottleneck to promote disentanglement and form a meaningful discrete motion\nspace. The bitrate-controlled latent motion and content are used as conditional\ninputs to a denoising diffusion model to facilitate self-supervised\nrepresentation learning. We validate our disentangled representation learning\nframework on real-world talking head videos with motion transfer and\nauto-regressive motion generation tasks. Furthermore, we also show that our\nmethod can generalize to other types of video data, such as pixel sprites of 2D\ncartoon characters. Our work presents a new perspective on self-supervised\nlearning of disentangled video representations, contributing to the broader\nfield of video analysis and generation.",

This paper proposes a flexible and transparent\nalternative framework for empirically examining the relationship between\nattitudes and behaviours using latent class choice models (LCCMs). Rather than\nembedding attitudinal constructs within the structural model, as in hybrid\nchoice frameworks, we recover class-specific attitudinal profiles through\nposterior inference. This approach enables analysts to explore\nattitude-behaviour associations without the complexity and convergence issues\noften associated with integrated estimation. Two case studies are used to\ndemonstrate the framework: one on employee preferences for working from home,\nand another on public acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines. Across both studies, we\ncompare posterior profiling of indicator means, fractional multinomial logit\n(FMNL) models, factor-based representations, and hybrid specifications. We find\nthat posterior inference methods provide behaviourally rich insights with\nminimal additional complexity, while factor-based models risk discarding key\nattitudinal information, and fullinformation hybrid models offer little gain in\nexplanatory power and incur substantially greater estimation burden. Our\nfindings suggest that when the goal is to explain preference heterogeneity,\nposterior inference offers a practical alternative to hybrid models, one that\nretains interpretability and robustness without sacrificing behavioural depth.",

We extend this framework to a more complex and realistic setting:\nClass Imbalanced FFREEDA (CI-FFREEDA), which takes into account class\nimbalances in both the source and target domains, as well as label shifts\nbetween source and target and among target clients. The replication of existing\nmethods in our experimental setup lead us to rethink the focus from enhancing\naggregation and domain adaptation methods to improving the feature extractors\nwithin the network itself.

We construct\nJAM models for a sample of seven edge-on ($i \\gtrapprox 85^\\circ$) galaxies\nthat span a range of star formation rates, dust content, and kinematic\ncomplexity.

In this paper, we offer a consistent understanding of such\nan unconventional phenomenon based on an emergent Higgs mode of the condensed\nholons in the doped Mott insulator. Specifically, in the lower pseudogap phase\n(LPP) where, although the holons still remain Bose condensed, the SC phase\ncoherence gets disordered by excited spinons, which induce vortex-like\nresponses from the holon condensate. By coupling to such internal fluctuations\ndescribed by a mutual Chern-Simons gauge theory, we show that an external\nelectromagnetic field can indeed produce the optical THG response in both the\nSC and LPP states, which are distinguished by a $\\pi$ phase shift with a\nsubstantial suppression of the THG signal in the latter regime at higher\ntemperatures.",

This Gaussian-implied\nobjective misspecifies the data-generating process because it tolerates\nnegative predictions, underpenalises rare heavy events, and ignores the mass at\nzero. We propose replacing RMSE with the Tweedie deviance, a likelihood-based\nand differentiable loss from the exponential--dispersion family with variance\nfunction $V(\\mu)=\\mu^p$. For $1<p<2$ it yields a compound Poisson--Gamma\ndistribution with a point mass at zero and a continuous density for $y>0$,\nmatching observed precipitation characteristics. We (i) estimate $p$ from the\nvariance--mean power law and show that precipitation across temporal\naggregations is far from Gaussian, with the Tweedie power $p$ increasing with\naccumulation length towards a Gamma limit; and (ii) demonstrate consistent\nskill gains when training deep data-driven models with Tweedie deviance in\nplace of RMSE. In diffusion-model downscaling over Beijing, Tweedie loss\nimproves wet-pixel MAE and extreme recall ($\\sim0.60$ vs $0.50$ at the 99th\npercentile). In ConvLSTM nowcasting over Kolkata, Tweedie loss yields improved\nwet-pixel MAE and dry-pixel hit rates, with improvements that compound\nautoregressively with lead time (for MAE, $\\sim2%$ at $t{+}1$ growing to\n$\\sim16%$ at $t{+}4$).

These states arise\nfrom diameter-dependent competition between the nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic\n($J_1$) and longer-range antiferromagnetic ($J_2$/$J_3$) couplings, as\nrigorously validated through density-functional theory calculations and\nHeisenberg modeling of phase diagrams.

Specifically, we consider the case of static\nsolutions in five-dimensional (5D) Anti-de-Sitter (AdS) spacetime and study the\nconstraints on merger of two equal mass black holes. We calculate the general\nR\\'enyi entropy expression and utilize it to study the bounds on the final\nblack hole mass post-merger. We study its variation with the R\\'enyi parameter.\nWe also compare the results with those for black holes in General Relativity\n(GR). We find that the GB term has a significant impact on the bounds for black\nhole merger. The bounds for GB gravity become weaker for the zeroth order\nR\\'enyi entropy and stronger for higher order R\\'enyi entropies in comparison\nto GR.",

    "abstract": "Antifreeze glycoproteins (AFGPs) are among the most potent ice\nrecrystallization inhibition (IRI) agents, yet the molecular basis for their\ncounterintuitive decline in activity with increasing glycosylated threonine\n(T*) content remains unresolved. Through molecular dynamics simulations of\nmodel glycoproteins with increasing T* content, we show that potent IRI\nactivity arises not only from the thermodynamic stability of strong ice-binding\nstates, but also from their kinetic accessibility. Specifically, the free\nenergy barrier for forming strong ice-binding states from the unbound state\nconstitutes a critical kinetic bottleneck. Increasing T* content enhances the\noverall hydration capacity due to the additional glycan moieties, thereby\nimposing a greater desolvation penalty and elevating the adsorption barrier.\nThis kinetic limitation, rather than the absence of strong ice-binding states,\naccounts for the experimentally observed decline in IRI activity. To quantify\nthe structural basis of this behavior, we introduce a facial amphiphilicity\nindex that integrates both spatial segregation and compositional ratio of\nhydrophilic and hydrophobic residues, and show that it correlates well with IRI\nactivity. These findings highlight that facial amphiphilicity mediates a\ncritical balance between binding stability and kinetic accessibility, providing\na rational design principle for advanced IRI materials.",

    "abstract": "Decision-making under uncertainty is often considered in two stages:\npredicting the unknown parameters, and then optimizing decisions based on\npredictions. While traditional prediction-focused learning (PFL) treats these\ntwo stages separately, decision-focused learning (DFL) trains the predictive\nmodel by directly optimizing the decision quality in an end-to-end manner.\nHowever, despite using exact or well-approximated gradients, vanilla DFL often\nsuffers from unstable convergence due to its flat-and-sharp loss landscapes. In\ncontrast, PFL yields more stable optimization, but overlooks the downstream\ndecision quality. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective approach:\nperturbing the decision loss gradient using the prediction loss gradient to\nconstruct an update direction. Our method requires no additional training and\ncan be integrated with any DFL solvers. Using the sigmoid-like decaying\nparameter, we let the prediction loss gradient guide the decision loss gradient\nto train a predictive model that optimizes decision quality. Also, we provide a\ntheoretical convergence guarantee to Pareto stationary point under mild\nassumptions. Empirically, we demonstrate our method across three stochastic\noptimization problems, showing promising results compared to other baselines.\nWe validate that our approach achieves lower regret with more stable training,\neven in situations where either PFL or DFL struggles.",

Conventional SER methods have been personalized\nusing emotional utterances of a target speaker, but it is often difficult to\nprepare utterances corresponding to all emotion labels in advance. Our idea to\novercome this difficulty is to obtain speaker characteristics by conditioning a\nfew emotional utterances of the target speaker in ICL-based inference. ICL is a\nmethod to perform unseen tasks by conditioning a few input-output examples\nthrough inference in large language models (LLMs). We meta-train a\nspeech-language model extended from the LLM to learn how to perform\npersonalized SER via ICL.

    "abstract": "Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a promising architecture for modern\nlarge language models (LLMs). However, massive parameters impose heavy GPU\nmemory (i.e., VRAM) demands, hindering the widespread adoption of MoE LLMs.\nOffloading the expert parameters to CPU RAM offers an effective way to\nalleviate the VRAM requirements for MoE inference. Existing approaches\ntypically cache a small subset of experts in VRAM and dynamically prefetch\nexperts from RAM during inference, leading to significant degradation in\ninference speed due to the poor cache hit rate and substantial expert loading\nlatency. In this work, we propose MoEpic, an efficient MoE inference system\nwith a novel expert split mechanism. Specifically, each expert is vertically\ndivided into two segments: top and bottom. MoEpic caches the top segment of hot\nexperts, so that more experts will be stored under the limited VRAM budget,\nthereby improving the cache hit rate. During each layer's inference, MoEpic\npredicts and prefetches the activated experts for the next layer. Since the top\nsegments of cached experts are exempt from fetching, the loading time is\nreduced, which allows efficient transfer-computation overlap. Nevertheless, the\nperformance of MoEpic critically depends on the cache configuration (i.e., each\nlayer's VRAM budget and expert split ratio). To this end, we propose a\ndivide-and-conquer algorithm based on fixed-point iteration for adaptive cache\nconfiguration. Extensive experiments on popular MoE LLMs demonstrate that\nMoEpic can save about half of the GPU cost, while lowering the inference\nlatency by about 37.51%-65.73% compared to the baselines.",

Raman\nmeasurements reveal compressive strain and interfacial charge transfer in\nWSe$_2$/graphene heterostructures, evidenced by blue-shifted phonon modes and\nthe emergence of higher-order interlayer breathing modes absent on SiO$_2$.\nConcomitant shifts and attenuation of graphene's G and 2D modes with increasing\nWSe$_2$ thickness indicate progressive p-type doping of graphene, while WSe$_2$\nphonon shifts point to n-type doping of the semiconductor, consistent with\ninterfacial electron transfer. PL shows strong quenching for monolayer WSe$_2$\non graphene due to ultrafast charge transfer and F\"orster resonance energy\ntransfer (FRET), with partial emission recovery in multilayers relative to\nSiO$_2$-supported flakes. Exciton behavior differs strongly between substrates:\non SiO$_2$, A- and B-exciton energies vary markedly with thickness, whereas on\ngraphene they remain nearly pinned. This stability reflects the combined\neffects of graphene's strong dielectric screening and charge-transfer-induced\nfree-carrier screening, with strain playing a secondary role.

These synthetic\ndatasets are typically generated by physically modeling sensor noise, but\nexisting approaches often consider only additive noise, ignore multiplicative\ncomponents, and rely on global calibration that overlooks pixel level\nmanufacturing variations. As a result, such methods struggle to accurately\nreproduce real sensor noise. To address these limitations, this paper derives a\nnoise model from the physical noise generation mechanisms that occur under low\nillumination and proposes a novel composite model that integrates both additive\nand multiplicative noise. To solve the model, we introduce a physics based per\npixel noise simulation and calibration scheme that estimates and synthesizes\nnoise for each individual pixel, thereby overcoming the restrictions of\ntraditional global calibration and capturing spatial noise variations induced\nby microscopic CMOS manufacturing differences. Motivated by the strong\nperformance of rectified flow methods in image generation and processing, we\nfurther combine the physics-based noise synthesis with a rectified flow\ngenerative framework and present PGRF a physics-guided rectified flow framework\nfor low light image enhancement. PGRF leverages the ability of rectified flows\nto model complex data distributions and uses physical guidance to steer the\ngeneration toward the desired clean image. To validate the effectiveness of the\nproposed model, we established the LLID dataset, an indoor low light benchmark\ncaptured with the Sony A7S II camera. Experimental results demonstrate that the\nproposed framework achieves significant improvements in low light RAW image\nenhancement.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms often require long training to become\nuseful, especially in complex environments with sparse rewards. While\ntechniques like reward shaping and curriculum learning exist to accelerate\ntraining, these are often extremely specific and require the developer's\nprofessionalism and dedicated expertise in the problem's domain. Tackling this\nchallenge, in this study, we explore the effectiveness of pre-trained Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) as tutors in a student-teacher architecture with RL\nalgorithms, hypothesizing that LLM-generated guidance allows for faster\nconvergence. In particular, we explore the effectiveness of reusing the LLM's\nadvice on the RL's convergence dynamics. Through an extensive empirical\nexamination, which included 54 configurations, varying the RL algorithm (DQN,\nPPO, A2C), LLM tutor (Llama, Vicuna, DeepSeek), and environment (Blackjack,\nSnake, Connect Four), our results demonstrate that LLM tutoring significantly\naccelerates RL convergence while maintaining comparable optimal performance.\nFurthermore, the advice reuse mechanism shows a further improvement in training\nduration but also results in less stable convergence dynamics. Our findings\nsuggest that LLM tutoring generally improves convergence, and its effectiveness\nis sensitive to the specific task, RL algorithm, and LLM model combination.",

    "abstract": "In the last decades, the subject of laser-induced damage (LID) moved from a\ntopic of scientific interest toward laser material processing for technical\napplications. When using pulsed lasers, the cumulative effect known as\nincubation is one of the most fundamental features of the processing event.\nIncubation manifests by the fact that the critical fluence for LID (known as\nlaser-induced damage threshold, LIDT) depends on the number of pulses N\nexciting one spot on the sample. In most cases, the threshold fluence decreases\nwith N starting from the single-shot ablation threshold and remains constant\nfor large N. No ablation or damage occurs for any N, if the fluence is kept\nbelow the multiple-pulse threshold. In contrast, examples where the LIDT\nincreases with N have been reported. The latter effect is known as laser\nconditioning and is advantageously used when ramping up the power of high-power\nlaser systems. Incubation has been described for many types of solids; the\nmotivation for these comprehensive efforts is twofold. Firstly, one tries to\nprevent the damage of optical materials in the beam path of high-energy or\nhigh-peak-power lasers. Secondly, one deliberately uses this damage for the\nsculpting of components. In this chapter, we introduce the reader to the\nmechanisms of incubation. We are going to look at the parameters controlling\nLID and highlight the peculiarity of the parameter \"number of pulses\". We will\ngive an overview of the experimental work done in a variety of materials. There\nare several physical and chemical mechanisms proposed that govern incubation,\nand there are several mathematical models to describe the behavior of threshold\nfluence and ablation rate in dependence on the number of pulses. In a few\ncases, the two classes of mechanisms are even related to each other.\nEventually, we will show the implications that incubation has on real-world\nlaser machining.",

However, a significant source of uncertainty at mid-IR\nwavelengths on ground-based telescopes is the thermal background. This\nbackground comes from blackbody radiation in the atmosphere and telescope and\nis therefore dependent on instrument design and atmospheric conditions. When\nperforming imaging observations, this background manifests as a slowly varying,\ninhomogeneous signal throughout the image, underlying our data. Photometry at\nmid-IR can greatly constrain atmospheric models but existing data are usually\nscarce or have significant error bars due to the difficulty of subtracting the\nbackground. Using M-band direct imaging observing sequences on NIRC2, we\nevaluate the thermal background of the Keck II telescope and attempt to\nsubtract the background in a more comprehensive way. For our primary science\ntarget, the forming protoplanet AB Aur b, we present a contrast upper limit of\n$2 \\times 10^{-4}$ in M-band and address the limiting factors in our\nobservation due to the thermal background. We determine that the origin of the\nsystematic components of the thermal background comes from the K-mirror and\nfind that the thermal background is also strongly influenced by emission from\nthe secondary spiders on Keck II.",

However,\nin computed tomography (CT) scans, the distribution of lesions which contain\nintricate structures is characterized by spatial sparsity. Besides, the complex\nand implicit relationships between different pathological descriptions in each\nsentence of the report and their corresponding sub-regions in radiographs pose\nadditional challenges. In this paper, we propose a Similarity-Driven\nCross-Granularity Pre-training (SimCroP) framework on chest CTs, which combines\nsimilarity-driven alignment and cross-granularity fusion to improve radiograph\ninterpretation. We first leverage multi-modal masked modeling to optimize the\nencoder for understanding precise low-level semantics from radiographs. Then,\nsimilarity-driven alignment is designed to pre-train the encoder to adaptively\nselect and align the correct patches corresponding to each sentence in reports.\nThe cross-granularity fusion module integrates multimodal information across\ninstance level and word-patch level, which helps the model better capture key\npathology structures in sparse radiographs, resulting in improved performance\nfor multi-scale downstream tasks. SimCroP is pre-trained on a large-scale\npaired CT-reports dataset and validated on image classification and\nsegmentation tasks across five public datasets.

Non-equilibrium electronic force reshapes the effective\npotential energy surface, and along with electronic viscosity force and\nstochastic force, governs voltage-dependent dynamics of DNA's collective\nmechanical coordinate. We compute mean first-passage times to quantify the\nnon-equilibrium lifetime of the DNA junction. At low voltage biases,\nelectron-mechanical motion coupling destabilises DNA by shifting the potential\nminimum towards critical displacement and suppressing barriers, shortening\nlifetimes by several orders of magnitude. Unexpectedly, at higher voltages the\ntrend reverses: the potential minimum shifts away from instability and the\nbarrier re-emerges, producing re-stabilisation of the junction. In addition, we\ndemonstrate the Landauer blowtorch effect in this system: coordinate-dependent\nfluctuations generate a spatially varying effective temperature, changing\ncurrent-induced dynamics of mechanical degrees of freedom. Apparent\ntemperatures of DNA mechanical motion increase far above ambient due to\ncurrent-induced heating, correlating with suppressed electronic current at\nstronger couplings.

We\ndefine three core relation types: equivalence, where both texts convey the same\ninformation using different textual forms or styles; inclusion, where one\ndocument fully contains the information of another and adds more; and semantic\noverlap, where each document presents partially overlapping content. To capture\nthese relations, we adopt a question answering (QA)-based approach, using the\nanswerability of shared questions across documents as an indicator of semantic\ncoverage. We construct a synthetic dataset derived from the SQuAD corpus by\nparaphrasing source passages and selectively omitting information, enabling\nprecise control over content overlap. This dataset allows us to benchmark\ngenerative language models and train transformer-based classifiers for SCR\nprediction.

By integrating theoretical modeling,\nsimulations, and experimental synthesis, we found that CNT tip vibrations\ndominate bridging at short lengths, whereas gas flow increasingly influences\nalignment as CNTs grow longer. This results in a crossover behavior governed by\ngas flow and pillar arrangement. We also developed a bridging model based on\ngeometric constraints to quantify the bridging behavior based on pillar spacing\nand angular accessibility. The statistical analysis of the resulting network\nstructures demonstrates that the pillar arrangement significantly influences\nthe connection types, with kite growth enabling more diverse network\ntopologies.

However,\nwhen developing new models or performing hyperparameter tuning, the time and\nenergy consumption associated with repeated training using massive amounts of\ndata are often unbearable. To address the above challenges, we propose\n\\emph{FoQuS}, which approximates the effect of full training by selecting a\ncoreset from the original dataset, thereby significantly reducing training\noverhead. Specifically, \\emph{FoQuS} records the prediction trajectory of each\nsample during full-dataset training and constructs three importance metrics\nbased on training dynamics.

    "abstract": "Scientific progress fundamentally depends on researchers' ability to access\nand build upon the work of others. Yet, a majority of published work remains\nbehind expensive paywalls, limiting access to universities that can afford\nsubscriptions. Furthermore, even when articles are accessible, the underlying\ndatasets could be restricted, available only through a \"reasonable request\" to\nthe authors. One way researchers could overcome these barriers is by relying on\ninformal channels, such as emailing authors directly, to obtain paywalled\narticles or restricted datasets. However, whether these informal channels are\nhindered by racial and/or institutional biases remains unknown. Here, we\ncombine qualitative semi-structured interviews, large-scale observational\nanalysis, and two randomized audit experiments to examine racial and\ninstitutional disparities in access to scientific knowledge. Our analysis of\n250 million articles reveals that researchers in the Global South cite\npaywalled papers and upon-request datasets at significantly lower rates than\ntheir Global North counterparts, and that these access gaps are associated with\nreduced knowledge breadth and scholarly impact. To interrogate the mechanisms\nunderlying this phenomenon, we conduct two randomized email audit studies in\nwhich fictional PhD students differing in racial background and institutional\naffiliation request access to paywalled articles (N = 18,000) and datasets (N =\n11,840). We find that racial identity more strongly predicts response rate to\npaywalled article requests compared to institutional affiliation, whereas\ninstitutional affiliation played a larger role in shaping access to datasets.\nThese findings reveal how informal gatekeeping can perpetuate structural\ninequities in science, highlighting the need for stronger data-sharing mandates\nand more equitable open access policies.",

The quantum\nmultigraphs represent a quantum mechanical treatment of the relations\nthemselves and give rise to Hilbert space realizations of relations. After\ndefining the Hilbert space, we focus on quantum simple graphs and explore the\nthermodynamics resulting from two simple models, a free Hamiltonian and an\nIsing-type Hamiltonian (with interactions among nearest-neighbor edges). We\nshow that removing the distinction among vertices by considering unlabeled\nvertices gives rise to a qualitatively different thermodynamics. We find that\nthe free theory of labeled quantum simple graphs is the\nErd\\H{o}s--R\\'enyi--Gilbert $G(N,p)$ model of random graphs. This model has\nanalytic free energy and hence no thermodynamic phase transition. On the other\nhand, the unlabeled quantum graphs give rise to proper thermodynamic phase\ntransitions in both the free and the ferromagnetic Ising models, characterized\nby divergence in the specific heat and critical slowing near the critical\ntemperature.

However, realizing SIM-enhanced\nfully-analog beamforming for wideband multiuser transmissions remains\nchallenging, as the SIM configuration has to handle interference across all\nsubcarriers. To address this, this paper proposes a flexible subcarrier\nallocation strategy to fully reap the SIM-assisted fully-analog beamforming\ncapability in an orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) system,\nwhere each subcarrier selectively serves one or more users to balance\ninterference mitigation and resource utilization of SIM. We propose an\niterative algorithm to jointly optimize the subcarrier assignment matrix and\nSIM transmission coefficients, approximating an interference-free channel for\nthose selected subcarriers. Results show that the proposed system has low\nfitting errors yet allows each user to exploit more subcarriers.

However, in\nreal-world scenarios, queries may include inactive sounds that are not present\nin the mixture. This leads to scenarios such as the Fully Unmatched Query (FUQ)\ncondition, where only inactive sounds are specified in the query, and the\nPartially Matched Query (PMQ) condition, where both active and inactive sounds\nare specified. Among these conditions, the performance degradation under the\nPMQ condition has been largely overlooked. To achieve robust TSE under the PMQ\ncondition, we propose context-aware query refinement. This method eliminates\ninactive classes from the query during inference based on the estimated sound\nclass activity.

State-of-the-art\nmethods generally adopt a multi-module network, which employs WSDDN as the\nmultiple instance detection network module and multiple instance refinement\nmodules to refine performance. However, these approaches suffer from three key\nlimitations. First, existing methods tend to generate pseudo GT boxes that\neither focus only on discriminative parts, failing to capture the whole object,\nor cover the entire object but fail to distinguish between adjacent intra-class\ninstances. Second, the foundational WSDDN architecture lacks a crucial\nbackground class representation for each proposal and exhibits a large semantic\ngap between its branches. Third, prior methods discard ignored proposals during\noptimization, leading to slow convergence. To address these challenges, we\nfirst design a heatmap-guided proposal selector (HGPS) algorithm, which\nutilizes dual thresholds on heatmaps to pre-select proposals, enabling pseudo\nGT boxes to both capture the full object extent and distinguish between\nadjacent intra-class instances. We then present a weakly supervised basic\ndetection network (WSBDN), which augments each proposal with a background class\nrepresentation and uses heatmaps for pre-supervision to bridge the semantic gap\nbetween matrices. At last, we introduce a negative certainty supervision loss\non ignored proposals to accelerate convergence.

However, it can\nconverge to incorrect results even when simulations appear stable, thus\nunderscoring the need for robust diagnostics. Existing criteria, such as\nmonitoring the drift distribution or the Langevin-time operator, are valuable,\nbut they remain indirect. In this work, we propose a complementary reliability\ntest based on the configurational temperature. It is constructed from the\ngradient and Hessian of the complex action. Unlike drift-based checks, this\nestimator directly probes thermodynamic consistency and thus offers a\nphysically interpretable cross-check of CLM dynamics. To demonstrate that the\nestimator reproduces the input temperature with high precision, we use\none-dimensional PT-symmetric models as a controlled benchmark. We show that the\nestimator also sensitively detects algorithmic errors, step-size artifacts, and\nincomplete thermalization. While tested in low-dimensional systems, the method\nis readily extensible to higher-dimensional scalar and gauge theories, where\nscalable approximations make its implementation practical. Since temperature is\ntied to the bare coupling in many lattice theories, configurational monitoring\ncan also serve as an independent check on coupling-dependent observables. Our\nresults suggest that configurational temperature can be integrated into a\nhybrid diagnostic framework, thus enhancing the robustness of CLM across a wide\nrange of applications, including future studies of lattice QCD at finite\ndensity.",

In this study, we propose an ordering to compare incompatibility\nand reveal its various properties based on the operational intuition that\nlarger incompatibility can be detected with fewer states. We especially focus\non typical class of incompatibility exhibited by mutually unbiased qubit\nobservables and numerically demonstrate that the ordering yields new\nclassifications among sets of devices. Moreover, the equivalence relation\ninduced by this ordering is proved to uniquely characterize mutually unbiased\nqubit observables among all pairs of unbiased qubit observables.

    "abstract": "Audio and music generation systems have been remarkably developed in the\nmusic information retrieval (MIR) research field. The advancement of these\ntechnologies raises copyright concerns, as ownership and authorship of\nAI-generated music (AIGM) remain unclear. Also, it can be difficult to\ndetermine whether a piece was generated by AI or composed by humans clearly. To\naddress these challenges, we aim to improve the accuracy of AIGM detection by\nanalyzing the structural patterns of music segments. Specifically, to extract\nmusical features from short audio clips, we integrated various pre-trained\nmodels, including self-supervised learning (SSL) models or an audio effect\nencoder, each within our suggested transformer-based framework. Furthermore,\nfor long audio, we developed a segment transformer that divides music into\nsegments and learns inter-segment relationships. We used the FakeMusicCaps and\nSONICS datasets, achieving high accuracy in both the short-audio and full-audio\ndetection experiments. These findings suggest that integrating segment-level\nmusical features into long-range temporal analysis can effectively enhance both\nthe performance and robustness of AIGM detection systems.",

    "abstract": "Generalized zero-shot semantic segmentation of 3D point clouds aims to\nclassify each point into both seen and unseen classes. A significant challenge\nwith these models is their tendency to make biased predictions, often favoring\nthe classes encountered during training. This problem is more pronounced in 3D\napplications, where the scale of the training data is typically smaller than in\nimage-based tasks. To address this problem, we propose a novel method called\nE3DPC-GZSL, which reduces overconfident predictions towards seen classes\nwithout relying on separate classifiers for seen and unseen data. E3DPC-GZSL\ntackles the overconfidence problem by integrating an evidence-based uncertainty\nestimator into a classifier. This estimator is then used to adjust prediction\nprobabilities using a dynamic calibrated stacking factor that accounts for\npointwise prediction uncertainty. In addition, E3DPC-GZSL introduces a novel\ntraining strategy that improves uncertainty estimation by refining the semantic\nspace. This is achieved by merging learnable parameters with text-derived\nfeatures, thereby improving model optimization for unseen data.

This\nresearch aims to learn how the behavior of vision language models changes and\nto explore methods for characterizing such changes.

While existing hyperspectral\ntrackers have made progress by either transforming hyperspectral data into\nfalse-color images or incorporating modality fusion strategies, they often fail\nto capture the intrinsic spectral information, temporal dependencies, and\ncross-depth interactions. To address these limitations, a new hyperspectral\nobject tracking network equipped with Mamba (HyMamba), is proposed. It unifies\nspectral, cross-depth, and temporal modeling through state space modules\n(SSMs). The core of HyMamba lies in the Spectral State Integration (SSI)\nmodule, which enables progressive refinement and propagation of spectral\nfeatures with cross-depth and temporal spectral information. Embedded within\neach SSI, the Hyperspectral Mamba (HSM) module is introduced to learn spatial\nand spectral information synchronously via three directional scanning SSMs.\nBased on SSI and HSM, HyMamba constructs joint features from false-color and\nhyperspectral inputs, and enhances them through interaction with original\nspectral features extracted from raw hyperspectral images. Extensive\nexperiments conducted on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that HyMamba\nachieves state-of-the-art performance.

Building on the work of Aragones et al.

I\npresent a formal model where, instead of assuming voters to be naive, I tackle\nthe question by completely characterizing a set of subgame-perfect equilibria\nby introducing non-naive (or strategic) voting behavior into the mix. I find\nthat non-naive voting behavior, by using the candidate's reputation as an\ninstrument of policy discipline after the election, aids in successfully\ninducing candidates to put forth their maximal incentive-compatible promise\n(among a range of such credible promises) in equilibrium. Through the credible\nthreat of punishment in the form of loss of reputation for all future\nelections, non-naive voters gain a unanimous increase in expected utility\nrelative to when they behave naively. In fact, comparative statics show that\ncandidates who are more likely to win are more likely to keep their promises.\nIn this framework, voters are not only able to bargain for more credible\npromises but also end up raising their expected future payoffs in equilibrium.\nIncluding such forms of strategic behavior thus reduces cheap talk by creating\na credible electoral system where candidates do as they say once elected.\nLater, I present an analysis that includes limited punishment as a political\naccountability mechanism.",

The distance of CFS,\nwhich plays an important role in decision analyses, is necessary when the CFS\nis applied in solving practical issues. However, as far as we know, the studies\non the distance of CFS are few, and the current Minkowski distance of CFS\nignores the hesitancy degree of CFS, which might cause errors. To fill the gap\nof the studies on the distance of CFS, because of the practicality of the\nHausdorff distance, this paper proposes the improved cognitive fuzzy Minkowski\n(CF-IM) distance and the cognitive fuzzy Hausdorff (CF-H) distance to enrich\nthe studies on the distance of CFS. It is found that the anti-perturbation\nability of the CF-H distance is stronger than that of the CF-IM distance, but\nthe information utilization of the CF-IM distance is higher than that of the\nCF-H distance. To balance the anti-perturbation ability and information\nutilization of the CF-IM distance and CF-H distance, the cognitive fuzzy\ncombined (CF-C) distance is proposed by establishing the linear combination of\nthe CF-IM distance and CF-H distance.

Due to the nonconcavity of the likelihood function, the\nExpectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is widely used for parameter estimation\nof each Gaussian component. Existing analyses of the EM algorithm's convergence\nto the true parameter focus primarily on either the two-component case or\nmulti-component settings with both known mixing probabilities and known,\nisotropic covariance matrices. In this work, we establish the minimax optimal\nrate of convergence of the EM algorithm for multi-component GMMs in full\ngenerality. The required separation condition between Gaussian components for\nEM to converge is the weakest known to date. We develop two distinct analytical\napproaches, each tailored to a different regime of separation, reflecting two\ncomplementary perspectives on the use of EM: parameter estimation and\nclustering. As a byproduct of our analysis, we show that the EM algorithm, when\nused for community detection, also achieves the minimax optimal rate of\nmisclustering error under milder separation conditions than spectral clustering\nand Lloyd's algorithm, an interesting result in its own right. Our analysis\nallows the number of components, the minimal mixing probabilities, the\nseparation between Gaussian components as well as the dimension to grow with\nthe sample size.

To address this gap, we\npropose RepViT-CXR, a channel replication strategy that adapts single-channel\nCXR images into a ViT-compatible format without introducing additional\ninformation loss. We evaluate RepViT-CXR on three benchmark datasets.

To address this, physical layer compressive measurement\nhas been proposed to reduce power consumption per pixel by 10-100X. Video\nSnapshot Compressive Imaging (SCI) introduces high frequency modulation in the\noptical sensor layer to increase effective frame rate. A commonly used sampling\nstrategy of video SCI is Random Sampling (RS) where each mask element value is\nrandomly set to be 0 or 1. Similarly, image inpainting (I2P) has demonstrated\nthat images can be recovered from a fraction of the image pixels. Inspired by\nI2P, we propose Ultra-Sparse Sampling (USS) regime, where at each spatial\nlocation, only one sub-frame is set to 1 and all others are set to 0. We then\nbuild a Digital Micro-mirror Device (DMD) encoding system to verify the\neffectiveness of our USS strategy. Ideally, we can decompose the USS\nmeasurement into sub-measurements for which we can utilize I2P algorithms to\nrecover high-speed frames. However, due to the mismatch between the DMD and\nCCD, the USS measurement cannot be perfectly decomposed. To this end, we\npropose BSTFormer, a sparse TransFormer that utilizes local Block attention,\nglobal Sparse attention, and global Temporal attention to exploit the sparsity\nof the USS measurement. Extensive results on both simulated and real-world data\nshow that our method significantly outperforms all previous state-of-the-art\nalgorithms.

    "abstract": "Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are generally believed to originate from two distinct\nprogenitors, compact binary mergers and massive collapsars. Traditional and\nsome recent machine learning-based classification schemes predominantly rely on\nobserver-frame physical parameters, which are significantly affected by the\nredshift effects and may not accurately represent the intrinsic properties of\nGRBs. In particular, the progenitors usually could only be decided by\nsuccessful detection of the multi-band long-term afterglow, which could easily\ncost days of devoted effort from multiple global observational utilities. In\nthis work, we apply the unsupervised machine learning (ML) algorithms called\nt-SNE and UMAP to perform GRB classification based on rest-frame prompt\nemission parameters. The map results of both t-SNE and UMAP reveal a clear\ndivision of these GRBs into two clusters, denoted as GRBs-I and GRBs-II. We\nfind that all supernova-associated GRBs, including the atypical short-duration\nburst GRB 200826A (now recognized as collapsar-origin), consistently fall\nwithin the GRBs-II category. Conversely, all kilonova-associated GRBs (except\nfor two controversial events) are classified as GRBs-I, including the peculiar\nlong-duration burst GRB 060614 originating from a merger event. In another\nwords, this clear ML separation of two types of GRBs based only on prompt\nproperties could correctly predict the results of progenitors without follow-up\nafterglow properties. Comparative analysis with conventional classification\nmethods using $T_{90}$ and $E_{\\rm p,z}$--$E_{\\rm iso}$ correlation\ndemonstrates that our machine learning approach provides superior\ndiscriminative power, particularly in resolving ambiguous cases of hybrid GRBs.",

While accurate density estimates\nrequire prohibitively long timescales that are inaccessible by ab initio\nmolecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations, machine-learned molecular dynamics\n(MLMD) offers a scalable alternative, enabling the generation of force\npredictions at ab initio accuracy with reduced computational cost. However,\ndespite their efficiency, MLMD simulations remain constrained by femtosecond\ntimesteps, which limit their practicality for computing long-time averages\nneeded for accurate density estimation. To address this, we propose a\nconditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) based\nquasi-continuum approach that predicts the long-time behavior of force profiles\nalong the confinement direction, conditioned on noisy forces extracted from a\nlimited AIMD dataset. The predicted smooth forces are then linked to continuum\ntheory via the Nernst-Planck equation to reveal the underlying density\nbehavior. We test the framework on water confined between two graphene\nnanoscale slits and demonstrate that density profiles for channel widths\noutside of the training domain can be recovered with ab initio accuracy.\nCompared to AIMD and MLMD simulations, our method achieves orders-of-magnitude\nspeed-up in runtime and requires significantly less training data than prior\nworks.",

    "abstract": "This study presents an Exploratory Retrieval-Augmented Planning (ExRAP)\nframework, designed to tackle continual instruction following tasks of embodied\nagents in dynamic, non-stationary environments. The framework enhances Large\nLanguage Models' (LLMs) embodied reasoning capabilities by efficiently\nexploring the physical environment and establishing the environmental context\nmemory, thereby effectively grounding the task planning process in time-varying\nenvironment contexts. In ExRAP, given multiple continual instruction following\ntasks, each instruction is decomposed into queries on the environmental context\nmemory and task executions conditioned on the query results. To efficiently\nhandle these multiple tasks that are performed continuously and simultaneously,\nwe implement an exploration-integrated task planning scheme by incorporating\nthe {information-based exploration} into the LLM-based planning process.\nCombined with memory-augmented query evaluation, this integrated scheme not\nonly allows for a better balance between the validity of the environmental\ncontext memory and the load of environment exploration, but also improves\noverall task performance. Furthermore, we devise a {temporal consistency\nrefinement} scheme for query evaluation to address the inherent decay of\nknowledge in the memory. Through experiments with VirtualHome, ALFRED, and\nCARLA, our approach demonstrates robustness against a variety of embodied\ninstruction following scenarios involving different instruction scales and\ntypes, and non-stationarity degrees, and it consistently outperforms other\nstate-of-the-art LLM-based task planning approaches in terms of both goal\nsuccess rate and execution efficiency.",

We find\nthat these methods, designed for contexts in which variation from a single\nground-truth label is considered noise, often remove annotators who disagree\ninstead of spam annotators, introducing suboptimal tradeoffs between accuracy\nand label diversity. We find that conservative settings for annotator removal\n(<5%) are best, after which all tested methods increase the mean absolute error\nfrom the true average label. We analyze performance on synthetic spam to\nobserve that these methods often assume spam annotators are less random than\nreal spammers tend to be: most spammers are distributionally indistinguishable\nfrom real annotators, and the minority that are distinguishable tend to give\nfixed answers, not random ones. Thus, tasks requiring the preservation of\nvariation reverse the intuition of existing spam filtering methods: spammers\ntend to be less random than non-spammers, so metrics that assume variation is\nspam fare worse.

In particular, understanding and engineering its\nGilbert damping which determines magnetization dynamics are crucial for its\napplications. Here, we investigate the Gilbert damping of bilayer and the\ntwisted bilayer Fe3GaTe2 through first-principles calculations. For the bilayer\nFe3GaTe2, we obtain a quite low Gilbert damping when its magnetization is along\nthe z axis at room temperature. In addition, the bilayer Fe3GaTe2 exhibits a\nlarge orientational anisotropy of Gilbert damping when its magnetization is\nrotated from the magnetic easy axis to the hard one. Such anisotropy is\nattributed to the distinct band structures caused by the anisotropic spin-orbit\ncoupling. Surprisingly, we find that twisting the bilayer Fe3GaTe2 can\neffectively reduce the Gilbert damping for the perpendicular magnetization, and\nenhance the orientational anisotropy of Gilbert damping up to 635% when\nrotating the magnetization from the magnetic easy axis to the hard one. These\nfindings open up an entirely new avenue for the manipulation of Gilbert damping\nand its anisotropy in two-dimensional van der Waals ferromagnets.",

Although deep unfolding networks (DUNs) have demonstrated promising\nperformance in ISTD due to their model interpretability and data adaptability,\nexisting methods still face significant challenges in parameter lightweightness\nand noise robustness. In this regard, we propose a highly lightweight framework\nbased on robust principal component analysis (RPCA) called L-RPCANet.\nTechnically, a hierarchical bottleneck structure is constructed to reduce and\nincrease the channel dimension in the single-channel input infrared image to\nachieve channel-wise feature refinement, with bottleneck layers designed in\neach module to extract features. This reduces the number of channels in feature\nextraction and improves the lightweightness of network parameters. Furthermore,\na noise reduction module is embedded to enhance the robustness against complex\nnoise. In addition, squeeze-and-excitation networks (SENets) are leveraged as a\nchannel attention mechanism to focus on the varying importance of different\nfeatures across channels, thereby achieving excellent performance while\nmaintaining both lightweightness and robustness. Extensive experiments on the\nISTD datasets validate the superiority of our proposed method compared with\nstate-of-the-art methods covering RPCANet, DRPCANet, and RPCANet++.

This lack of\ntransparency poses security risks, as approximately 84% of the top 1200\ncommonly used artifacts are not built using a transparent CI/CD pipeline.\nConsequently, users must place a significant amount of trust not only in the\nsource code but also in the environment in which these artifacts are built.\n  Rebuilding software artifacts from source provides a robust solution to\nimprove supply chain security. This approach allows for a deeper review of\ncode, verification of binary-source equivalence, and control over dependencies.\nHowever, challenges arise due to variations in build environments, such as JDK\nversions and build commands, which can lead to build failures. Additionally,\nensuring that all dependencies are rebuilt from source across large and complex\ndependency graphs further complicates the process.

This normalization transforms $St^{\\Delta_i}$\ninto a true derivation on the localized Dickson algebra, thereby establishing\nan elegant differential framework. This framework yields two new significant\nresults: first, a closed-form formula for all higher iterates of the operator,\nrevealing a strong factorial-based vanishing criterion for iterates of order\n$\\geq p$. Second, the discovery of a normalized coordinate system where the\naction has constant coefficients. This latter insight reduces the problem of\ncomputing the associated Margolis homology to a standard Koszul complex\ncomputation, in direct analogy with a recent result by Ngo Anh Tuan [4].

Yet the QFIM is costly to\nobtain directly, usually requiring more state preparation than its classical\ncounterpart: the classical Fisher information matrix (CFIM). We rigorously\nprove that averaging the classical Fisher information matrix over Haar-random\nmeasurement bases yields $\\mathbb{E}_{U\\sim\\mu_H}[F^U(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})] =\n\\frac{1}{2}Q(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ for pure states in $\\mathbb{C}^N$.\nFurthermore, we obtain the variance of CFIM ($O(N^{-1})$) and establish\nnon-asymptotic concentration bounds ($\\exp(-\\Theta(N)t^2)$), demonstrating that\nusing few random measurement bases is sufficient to approximate the QFIM\naccurately, especially in high-dimensional settings. This work establishes a\nsolid theoretical foundation for efficient quantum natural gradient methods via\nrandomized measurements.",
