    "abstract": "Advanced gravitational-wave detector designs are pushing towards lower\nfrequencies, where certain types of noise, previously considered negligible,\nmay come to dominate the detectors' noise budgets. In particular, we revisit\natmospheric Newtonian noise, caused by the fluctuating gravitational field as\nregions of high and low gas density move past the detector. We consider density\nperturbations both due to pressure waves (infrasound) and due to advected\ntemperature fluctuations. In the absence of detailed site-specific models of\ntopography, airflow, and building design, we present general scaling formulae\nthat estimate the spectrum of atmospheric Newtonian noise, and show how it is\naffected by broad detector design choices. We confirm previous analyses that\nshow that atmospheric Newtonian noise is not likely a strong contributor to\nadvanced LIGO; however, it will be a dominant factor for third-generation\ndetectors targeting low frequencies, with the low-frequency cutoff principally\nconstrained by the depth of the detector underground.",

    "abstract": "Histopathology evaluation of tissue specimens through microscopic examination\nis essential for accurate disease diagnosis and prognosis. However, traditional\nmanual analysis by specially trained pathologists is time-consuming,\nlabor-intensive, cost-inefficient, and prone to inter-rater variability,\npotentially affecting diagnostic consistency and accuracy. As digital pathology\nimages continue to proliferate, there is a pressing need for automated analysis\nto address these challenges. Recent advancements in artificial\nintelligence-based tools such as machine learning (ML) models, have\nsignificantly enhanced the precision and efficiency of analyzing\nhistopathological slides. However, despite their impressive performance, ML\nmodels are invariant only to translation, lacking invariance to rotation and\nreflection. This limitation restricts their ability to generalize effectively,\nparticularly in histopathology, where images intrinsically lack meaningful\norientation. In this study, we develop robust, equivariant histopathological\nbiomarkers through a novel symmetric convolutional kernel via unsupervised\nsegmentation. The approach is validated using prostate tissue micro-array (TMA)\nimages from 50 patients in the Gleason 2019 Challenge public dataset. The\nbiomarkers extracted through this approach demonstrate enhanced robustness and\ngeneralizability against rotation compared to models using standard convolution\nkernels, holding promise for enhancing the accuracy, consistency, and\nrobustness of ML models in digital pathology. Ultimately, this work aims to\nimprove diagnostic and prognostic capabilities of histopathology beyond\nprostate cancer through equivariant imaging.",

Both dendrimers and network chains are modelled as\nbead-spring chain polymers, with hydrodynamic interactions incorporated for the\naccurate prediction of dynamic properties. Linear chains form a network via the\nassociating groups distributed along their backbones, and the dendrimers\ninteract attractively or repulsively with the network, enabling a direct\ncomparison of sticky and non-sticky behaviour of dendrimers. Structural\nanalysis reveals that while non-sticky dendrimers shrink with increasing\nnetwork concentration, similar to linear polymer behaviour, sticky dendrimers\nexhibit stretching at low concentrations due to binding interactions. Dendrimer\ndynamics are largely insensitive to network architecture but are strongly\ninfluenced by the strength of dendrimer-network interactions. Increasing\nattraction to the network leads to subdiffusive motion and non-Gaussian\ndisplacement statistics, even when dendrimers are smaller than the average mesh\nsize. The long-time diffusivity aligns with theoretical predictions for\nnanoparticle transport in polymer networks. Additionally, dendrimers deform the\nnetwork locally, altering the mesh size distribution depending on their\nstickiness.

The stellar gravitational\nquadrupole moment, which evolves over time due to stellar spin-down over the\nfirst $\\sim 100\\,$Myr, causes these resonances to sweep through the parameter\nspace (of masses and semimajor-axis ratios), affecting a wider variety of\nsystems than when spin-down is neglected. The angular momentum exchange in\nthese resonances typically aligns the outer planets' orbits together while\nmisaligning the innermost planet from its companions. Here, we explore how\nresonance-induced (mis-)alignments between planets affect the transit outcome.\nWe use the three-planet Kepler-619 system as a concrete case study that is\nrelatively likely (approximately $1$:$1$ odds) to have undergone a sweeping\nresonance. Consequently, if the outer planets are initially misaligned, a\nsweeping-resonance-induced push toward alignment in the outer planets' orbits\nsubstantially increases the probability that they are observed transiting\ntogether. However, the resulting misalignment of the innermost planet from its\nouter companions, reduces the overall probability that Kepler-619 is observed\nas a multi-planet transiting system when considering any pair of planets or all\nthree together. This implies that sweeping resonances (which may occur in\n$20\\%$ of systems) have a deleterious effect on the transiting exoplanet\nsample, suppressing the detection of multi-planet transiting systems in favor\nof apparent single-planet systems.",

Recent observations of X-GAP groups reveal large entropy\nexcesses and plateaus, in line with our findings and in contrast to the\npower-law-like profiles of most previous observations. While entropy plateaus\nand large entropy excesses may be observationally confirmed in unbiased\nsamples, reproducing the full diversity of entropy profiles remains an\noutstanding challenge for next-generation feedback models.

Today, such photoreal avatars are seen\nas a key component in emerging applications in telepresence, extended reality,\nand entertainment. Building a photoreal avatar requires estimating the complex\nnon-rigid motion of different facial components as seen in input video images;\ndue to inaccurate motion estimation, animatable models typically present a loss\nof fidelity and detail when compared to their non-animatable counterparts,\nbuilt from an individual facial expression. Also, recent state-of-the-art\nmodels are often affected by memory limitations that reduce the number of 3D\nGaussians used for modeling, leading to lower detail and quality. To address\nthese problems, we present a new high-detail 3D head avatar model that improves\nupon the state of the art, largely increasing the number of 3D Gaussians and\nmodeling quality for rendering at 4K resolution. Our high-quality model is\nreconstructed from multiview input video and builds on top of a mesh-based 3D\nmorphable model, which provides a coarse deformation layer for the head.\nPhotoreal appearance is modelled by 3D Gaussians embedded within the continuous\nUVD tangent space of this mesh, allowing for more effective densification where\nmost needed. Additionally, these Gaussians are warped by a novel UVD\ndeformation field to capture subtle, localized motion.

We introduce a new method to bridge this domain gap with an\nintermediate, synthetic representation of truth that differs from methods\noperating purely in latent space, such as normalizing flows or invertible\napproaches, in that the synthetic data is specifically engineered to represent\nintrinsic detector hardware capabilities of the system at hand. The hypothesis\nis that by encoding physical properties of the detector response available only\nin full simulation, such synthetic representations result in a less lossy\ncompression and recovery than a direct mapping from truth to experimental data.\nWe demonstrate a first implementation of this concept with full simulation of a\ndual-readout crystal electromagnetic calorimeter for future collider detectors,\nin which the synthetic data is constructed to be the simulated detector hits\ncorresponding to photon tracks of scintillation and Cerenkov photons. We refer\nto these signals as simulated observables as they would not be physical\nobservables in a real detector, but are nonetheless representations of a real\nphysical process. First results show that the synthetic representation\nnaturally anchors the neural network architecture to a known physical method,\nin this case the dual-readout correction.

    "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) increasingly adapt and personalize to diverse\nsets of users, there is an increased risk of systems appropriating sociolects,\ni.e., language styles or dialects that are associated with specific minoritized\nlived experiences (e.g., African American English, Queer slang). In this work,\nwe examine whether sociolect usage by an LLM agent affects user reliance on its\noutputs and user perception (satisfaction, frustration, trust, and social\npresence). We designed and conducted user studies where 498 African American\nEnglish (AAE) speakers and 487 Queer slang speakers performed a set of\nquestion-answering tasks with LLM-based suggestions in either standard American\nEnglish (SAE) or their self-identified sociolect. Our findings showed that\nsociolect usage by LLMs influenced both reliance and perceptions, though in\nsome surprising ways. Results suggest that both AAE and Queer slang speakers\nrelied more on the SAE agent, and had more positive perceptions of the SAE\nagent. Yet, only Queer slang speakers felt more social presence from the Queer\nslang agent over the SAE one, whereas only AAE speakers preferred and trusted\nthe SAE agent over the AAE one. These findings emphasize the need to test for\nbehavioral outcomes rather than simply assume that personalization would lead\nto a better and safer reliance outcome. They also highlight the nuanced\ndynamics of minoritized language in machine interactions, underscoring the need\nfor LLMs to be carefully designed to respect cultural and linguistic boundaries\nwhile fostering genuine user engagement and trust.",

The problem is challenging\nbecause it is a blind inverse problem, i.e., the microphone array geometry, the\nroom impulse response (RIR), and the speech sources, are all unknown. We\npropose ArrayDPS to solve the BSS problem in an unsupervised, array-agnostic,\nand generative manner. The core idea builds on diffusion posterior sampling\n(DPS), but unlike DPS where the likelihood is tractable, ArrayDPS must\napproximate the likelihood by formulating a separate optimization problem. The\nsolution to the optimization approximates room acoustics and the relative\ntransfer functions between microphones. These approximations, along with the\ndiffusion priors, iterate through the ArrayDPS sampling process and ultimately\nyield separated voice sources. We only need a simple single-speaker speech\ndiffusion model as a prior along with the mixtures recorded at the microphones;\nno microphone array information is necessary.

In terms of the interpolation parameter lambda, we argue that two\nsystems have very similar constant-potential-energy hypersurfaces if the\npotential energies of configurations rarely cross when plotted as functions of\nlambda. Such absence of \"level crossing\" applies to a very good approximation\nfor the LJ to WCA transformation, and it also applies to a quite good\napproximation for the LJ to IPL and the YK to YK transformations (the latter\nvaries the screening length). In all cases, structure and dynamics are shown to\nbe almost invariant as functions of lambda. The density is kept constant when\nlambda is varied. Temperature must generally be adjusted with lambda, which is\ndone by an iterative \"reduced-force-matching\" method with no free parameters.\nWe also apply the interpolation strategy to two versions of the Kob-Andersen\n(KA) binary LJ system and show that a recently introduced shifted-force-cutoff\nversion of this system has constant-potential-energy hypersurfaces, which are\nalmost identical to those of the original KA system.

However, its usage in\nsome areas is not correct.\n  For example, the chi-square test for homogeneity of proportions (that is,\ncomparing proportions across groups in a contingency table) is frequently used\nto verify if the rows of a given nonnegative $m \\times n$ (contingency) matrix\n$A$ are proportional. The null-hypothesis $H_0$: ``$m$ rows are proportional''\n(for the whole population) is rejected with confidence level $1 - \\alpha$ if\nand only if $\\chi^2_{stat} > \\chi^2_{crit}$, where the first term is given by\nPearson's formula, while the second one depends only on $m, n$, and $\\alpha$,\nbut not on the entries of $A$.\n  It is immediate to notice that the Pearson's formula is not invariant. More\nprecisely, whenever we multiply all entries of $A$ by a constant $c$, the value\n$\\chi^2_{stat}(A)$ is multiplied by $c$, too, $\\chi^2_{stat}(cA) = c\n\\chi^2_{stat} (A)$. Thus, if all rows of $A$ are exactly proportional then\n$\\chi^2_{stat}(cA) = c \\chi^2_{stat}(A) = 0$ for any $c$ and any $\\alpha$.\nOtherwise, $\\chi^2_{stat} (cA)$ becomes arbitrary large or small, as positive\n$c$ is increasing or decreasing. Hence, at any fixed significance level\n$\\alpha$, the null hypothesis $H_0$ will be rejected with confidence $1 -\n\\alpha$, when $c$ is sufficiently large and not rejected when $c$ is\nsufficiently small, Yet, obviously, the rows of $cA$ should be proportional or\nnot for all $c$ simultaneously.\n  Thus, any reasonable formula for the test statistic must be invariant, that\nis, take the same value for matrices $cA$ for all real positive $c$.\n  KEY WORDS: Pearson chi-square test, difference between two proportions,\ngoodness of fit, contingency tables.",

This modification\nsignificantly accelerates the convergence of expansions across the entire range\nof $\\lambda$, thereby greatly enhancing the efficiency of the method and\nallowing accurate calculations with a very small number of expansion functions\n$N\\lesssim 10$. As a result, this modified approach provides an essentially\ncomplete, simple, and efficient solution to the problem of the anharmonic\noscillator, enabling straightforward computation of all its physical properties\n-- including the energies and wave functions of both ground and excited states\n-- for arbitrary values of $\\lambda$.",

    "abstract": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a powerful noninvasive diagnostic imaging\ntool that provides unparalleled soft tissue contrast and anatomical detail.\nNoise contamination, especially in accelerated and/or low-field acquisitions,\ncan significantly degrade image quality and diagnostic accuracy. Supervised\nlearning based denoising approaches have achieved impressive performance but\nrequire high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) labels, which are often unavailable.\nSelf-supervised learning holds promise to address the label scarcity issue, but\nexisting self-supervised denoising methods tend to oversmooth fine spatial\nfeatures and often yield inferior performance than supervised methods. We\nintroduce Corruption2Self (C2S), a novel score-based self-supervised framework\nfor MRI denoising. At the core of C2S is a generalized denoising score matching\n(GDSM) loss, which extends denoising score matching to work directly with noisy\nobservations by modeling the conditional expectation of higher-SNR images given\nfurther corrupted observations. This allows the model to effectively learn\ndenoising across multiple noise levels directly from noisy data. Additionally,\nwe incorporate a reparameterization of noise levels to stabilize training and\nenhance convergence, and introduce a detail refinement extension to balance\nnoise reduction with the preservation of fine spatial features. Moreover, C2S\ncan be extended to multi-contrast denoising by leveraging complementary\ninformation across different MRI contrasts. We demonstrate that our method\nachieves state-of-the-art performance among self-supervised methods and\ncompetitive results compared to supervised counterparts across varying noise\nconditions and MRI contrasts on the M4Raw and fastMRI dataset.",

This work considers such stability limits for\nthree gnomonic cubed-sphere meshes -- 1) equidistant, 2) equiangular, and 3)\nequi-edge mappings. Von Neumann analysis is used to derive linear stability\nlimits, and these depend on the cell areas and aspect ratios of the\ncubed-sphere grid. The linear theory is compared to practical divergence and\nvorticity damping limits in NOAA GFDL's finite-volume dynamical core on the\ncubed-sphere (FV3), using a baroclinic wave initial condition and the\nequiangular and equi-edge grids. For divergence damping, both the magnitude of\nmaximum stable coefficients and the locations of instability agree with linear\ntheory. Due to implicit vorticity diffusion from the transport scheme,\npractical limits for vorticity damping are lower than the explicit stability\nlimits. The maximum allowable vorticity damping coefficient is dependent on the\nchoice of horizontal transport scheme for the equi-edge grid; it is\nhypothesised that this indicates the relative implicit diffusion of the\ntransport scheme in this test.",

In this study, we systematically\nevaluate the capability of LLMs, particularly the Llama-3.1 family (8B and\n70B), across three core biochemical tasks: Enzyme Commission number prediction,\nforward synthesis, and retrosynthesis. We compare single-task and multitask\nlearning strategies, employing parameter-efficient fine-tuning via LoRA\nadapters. Additionally, we assess performance across different data regimes to\nexplore their adaptability in low-data settings. Our results demonstrate that\nfine-tuned LLMs capture biochemical knowledge, with multitask learning\nenhancing forward- and retrosynthesis predictions by leveraging shared\nenzymatic information.

The expected absence of complete error\ncorrection for near-term and intermediate-term quantum devices means that QEM\nprotocols will remain relevant for devices with low enough error rates to\nattempt small examples of fault-tolerant algorithms.\n  Herein, we are interested in the performance of QEM with a template for\nquantum algorithms, quantum signal processing (QSP).

Hence, they may be a\nuseful playground for exploring QEM's practical performance and costs for a\nrange of controlled parameters. As a preliminary step in this direction, this\nwork explores the performance of zero-noise-extrapolation (ZNE) on a\nHamiltonian simulation algorithm designed within QSP under local depolarizing\nnoise.\n  We design a QSP-based Hamiltonian simulation of a modified Ising model under\ndepolarizing noise for low precision and varying simulation times.

In this context, regret minimisation in stochastic bandits under\n$\\epsilon$-global Differential Privacy (DP) has been widely studied. Unlike\nbandits without DP, there is a significant gap between the best-known regret\nlower and upper bound in this setting, though they \"match\" in order. Thus, we\nrevisit the regret lower and upper bounds of $\\epsilon$-global DP algorithms\nfor Bernoulli bandits and improve both. First, we prove a tighter regret lower\nbound involving a novel information-theoretic quantity characterising the\nhardness of $\\epsilon$-global DP in stochastic bandits. Our lower bound\nstrictly improves on the existing ones across all $\\epsilon$ values. Then, we\nchoose two asymptotically optimal bandit algorithms, i.e. DP-KLUCB and DP-IMED,\nand propose their DP versions using a unified blueprint, i.e., (a) running in\narm-dependent phases, and (b) adding Laplace noise to achieve privacy. For\nBernoulli bandits, we analyse the regrets of these algorithms and show that\ntheir regrets asymptotically match our lower bound up to a constant arbitrary\nclose to 1. This refutes the conjecture that forgetting past rewards is\nnecessary to design optimal bandit algorithms under global DP. At the core of\nour algorithms lies a new concentration inequality for sums of Bernoulli\nvariables under Laplace mechanism, which is a new DP version of the Chernoff\nbound. This result is universally useful as the DP literature commonly treats\nthe concentrations of Laplace noise and random variables separately, while we\ncouple them to yield a tighter bound.",

These models have become more complex as they are trained\nto jointly predict multiple objectives such as click, add-to-cart, checkout and\nother conversion types. Additionally, the capacity and performance of these\nmodels can often be increased with the use of embedding tables that encode high\ncardinality categorical features such as advertiser, user, campaign, and\nproduct identifiers (IDs). These embedding tables can be pre-trained, but also\nlearned end-to-end jointly with the model to directly optimize the model\nobjectives. Training these large tables is challenging due to: gradient\nsparsity, the high cardinality of the categorical features, the non-uniform\ndistribution of IDs and the very high label sparsity. These issues make\ntraining prone to both slow convergence and overfitting after the first epoch.\nPrevious works addressed the multi-epoch overfitting issue by using: stronger\nfeature hashing to reduce cardinality, filtering of low frequency IDs,\nregularization of the embedding tables, re-initialization of the embedding\ntables after each epoch, etc. Some of these techniques reduce overfitting at\nthe expense of reduced model performance if used too aggressively. In this\npaper, we share key learnings from the development of embedding table\noptimization and multi-epoch training in Pinterest Ads Conversion models. We\nshowcase how our Sparse Optimizer speeds up convergence, and how multi-epoch\noverfitting varies in severity between different objectives in a multi-task\nmodel depending on label sparsity.

    "abstract": "We use new HST observations coupled with archival data spanning a total\ntemporal baseline of 17 years to study the internal kinematics of the multiple\npopulations in the globular cluster NGC 2808 from its center out to ~8\nhalf-light radii (r_h). We detect different kinematical behaviors between the\nfirst- and second-generation populations. This is especially evident towards\nthe external regions of the cluster, where second-generation stars are\nincreasingly more radially anisotropic. Our results are in agreement with\ntheoretical simulations that predict that second-generation stars, initially\nmore concentrated in the inner regions, gradually diffuse outward and develop a\nstronger radially anisotropic velocity distribution with respect to the\nfirst-generation stars. We find the central regions of the cluster to exhibit a\nhigher degree of energy equipartition than the outskirts; our analysis reveals\nsimilar levels of energy equipartition in the radial and tangential components\nof the motion within about 4 r_h, while outside 4 r_h the data suggest that the\nequipartition level of the radial component of the velocity dispersion is\nslightly higher than that of the tangential component. Finally, we measured the\ndispersion of the angular momentum L_z for the three main subpopulations along\nthe main sequence, which provides further evidence of the differences in the\nvelocity anisotropy of 1G and 2G stars and shows marginal evidence for the most\nextreme second-generation subpopulation being slightly more radially\nanisotropic than the other second-generation subpopulation.",

    "abstract": "Economic theory implies strong limitations on what types of consumption\nbehavior are considered rational. Rationality implies that the Slutsky matrix,\nwhich captures the substitution effects of compensated price changes on demand\nfor different goods, is symmetric and negative semi-definite. While empirically\ninformed versions of negative semi-definiteness have been shown to be\nnonparametrically testable, the analogous question for Slutsky symmetry has\nremained open. Recently, it has even been shown that the symmetry condition is\nnot testable via the average Slutsky matrix, prompting conjectures about its\nnon-testability. We settle this question by deriving nonparametric conditional\nquantile restrictions on observable data that permit construction of a fully\nnonparametric test for Slutsky symmetry in an empirical setting with individual\nheterogeneity and endogeneity. The theoretical contribution is a multivariate\ngeneralization of identification results for partial effects in nonseparable\nmodels without monotonicity, which is of independent interest. This result has\nimplications for different areas in econometric theory, including nonparametric\nwelfare analysis with individual heterogeneity for which, in the case of more\nthan two goods, the symmetry condition introduces a nonlinear correction\nfactor.",

These challenges include the variability in the scale and\nappearance of the main object patterns, where the size, shape, and feature\nextent of objects of interest can differ significantly.

Recently, error-bounded lossy\ncompression methods emerged due to their ability to achieve high compression\nratios while controlling data distortion. However, they often overlook the\ninherent spatial and temporal correlations within scientific data, thus missing\nopportunities for higher compression. In this paper we propose GRAPHCOMP, a\nnovel graph-based method for error-bounded lossy compression of scientific\ndata. We perform irregular segmentation of the original grid data and generate\na graph representation that preserves the spatial and temporal correlations.\nInspired by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), we then propose a temporal graph\nautoencoder to learn latent representations that significantly reduce the size\nof the graph, effectively compressing the original data. Decompression reverses\nthe process and utilizes the learnt graph model together with the latent\nrepresentation to reconstruct an approximation of the original data. The\ndecompressed data are guaranteed to satisfy a user-defined point-wise error\nbound. We compare our method against the state-of-the-art error-bounded lossy\nmethods (i.e., HPEZ, SZ3.1, SPERR, and ZFP) on large-scale real and synthetic\ndata. GRAPHCOMP consistently achieves the highest compression ratio across most\ndatasets, outperforming the second-best method by margins ranging from 22% to\n50%.",

These\nchanges have been driven by agents' increasing capability to autonomously make\ndecisions and initiate actions, using existing applications; whether those\napplications are AI-based or not. This evolution enables unprecedented levels\nof AI integration, with agents now able to take actions on behalf of systems\nand users -- including, in some cases, the powerful ability for the AI to write\nand execute scripts as it deems necessary. With AI systems now able to\nautonomously execute code, interact with external systems, and operate without\nhuman oversight, traditional security approaches fall short.\n  This paper introduces an asset-centric methodology for threat modeling AI\nsystems that addresses the unique security challenges posed by integrated AI\nagents. Unlike existing top-down frameworks that analyze individual attacks\nwithin specific product contexts, our bottom-up approach enables defenders to\nsystematically identify how vulnerabilities -- both conventional and\nAI-specific -- impact critical AI assets across distributed infrastructures\nused to develop and deploy these agents. This methodology allows security teams\nto: (1) perform comprehensive analysis that communicates effectively across\ntechnical domains, (2) quantify security assumptions about third-party AI\ncomponents without requiring visibility into their implementation, and (3)\nholistically identify AI-based vulnerabilities relevant to their specific\nproduct context.

Then, what are the the best possible transfer operators $R$ and $P$ of\na given dimension $n_c < n$? Brannick et al. (2018) showed that when $A$ and\n$M$ are Hermitian positive definite (HPD), the optimal interpolation is such\nthat its range contains the $n_c$ smallest generalized eigenvectors of the\nmatrix pencil $(A, M)$. Recently, in Ali et al. (2025) we generalized this\nframework to the non-HPD setting, by considering both right (interpolation) and\nleft (restriction) generalized eigenvectors of $(A, M)$ and defining\ncorresponding nonsymmetric transfer operators $\\{R_\\#,P_\\#\\}$. Tight\nconvergence bounds for $\\{R_\\#,P_\\#\\}$ are derived in spectral radius, as well\nas a proof of pseudo-optimality. Note, $\\{R_\\#,P_\\#\\}$ are typically complex\nvalued, which is not practical for real-valued problems. Here we build on Ali\net al. (2025), first characterizing all inner products in which the\ncoarse-space correction defined by $\\{R_\\#,P_\\#\\}$ is orthogonal. We then\ndevelop tight two-level convergence bounds in these norms, and prove that the\nunderlying transfer operators $\\{R_\\#,P_\\#\\}$ are genuinely optimal. As a\nspecial case, our theory both recovers and extends the HPD results from\nBrannick et al. (2018). Finally, we show how to construct optimal, real-valued\ntransfer operators in the case of that $A$ and $M$ are real valued, but are not\nHPD. Numerical examples arising from discretized advection and wave-equation\nproblems are used to verify and illustrate the theory.",

    "abstract": "Venus, our neighboring planet, is an open-air laboratory that can be used to\nstudy why Earth and Venus evolved in such different ways. Noble gases in\nplanetary atmospheres are tracers of their geophysical evolution, and measuring\nthe elemental and isotopic composition of noble gases in the Venus atmosphere\ninforms us about the origin and evolution of the entire planet. In this work we\ndescribe a new SmallSat mission concept, Venus ATMOSpheric - Sample Return\n(VATMOS-SR), that would return gas samples from the upper atmosphere of Venus\nto Earth for scientific analysis. To ensure it is possible to relate the\ncomposition of the sampled gases (acquired when the spacecraft is traveling >10\nkm/s) to the free stream atmospheric composition, large-scale numerical\nsimulations are employed to model the flow into and through the sampling\nsystem. An emphasis is placed on quantifying noble gas elemental and isotopic\nfractionation that occurs during the sample acquisition and transfer process,\nto determine how measured isotopic ratios of noble gases in the sample would\ncompare to the actual isotopic ratios in the Venusian atmosphere. We find that\nlighter noble gases are depleted after they are sampled compared to the\nfreestream conditions, and heavier ones are enriched, due to the high pressure\ngradients present in the flowfield. Finally, we observe that, in general, the\nnumerical parameters do not have a major impact on the observed fractionation.\nHowever, the freestream velocity and density have a major impact on\nfractionation and need to be precisely known to properly reconstruct the\nfractionation in the sampling system. We demonstrate that the sample\nfractionation can be predicted with numerical simulations, and believe that\nVATMOS-SR, which could be the first mission to bring back samples from another\nplanet, could answer key scientific questions related to understanding the\nevolution of Venus.",

We propose Model-Based ReAnnotation (MBRA), a framework\nthat utilizes a learned short-horizon, model-based expert model to relabel or\ngenerate high-quality actions for these passive datasets. This relabeled data\nis then distilled into LogoNav, a long-horizon navigation policy conditioned on\nvisual goals or GPS waypoints.

OTI uses\ngradients in stellar astrophysical quantities, such as element abundances, as\nfunctions of dynamical quantities, like orbital actions or energy, to estimate\nthe Galactic mass distribution, assuming axisymmetry and steady-state of the\nsystem. While preliminary applications have shown promising outcomes, its\nsensitivity to disequilibrium effects is unknown. Here, we apply OTI to a\nbenchmark Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE-2) cosmological hydrodynamic\nsimulation, m12i, which enables a comparative analysis between known FIRE-2\nvertical acceleration profiles and total surface mass densities to the\nanalogous OTI-inferred results. We quantify OTI's accuracy within solar-analog\nvolumes embedded in the simulated galactic disk. Despite a dynamically-evolving\nsystem, we find that OTI recovers the known vertical acceleration profiles\nwithin 3 sigma/1 sigma errors for 94%/75% of the volumes considered. We discuss\nthe method's sensitivity to the local, instantaneous structure of the disk,\nreporting a loss in accuracy for volumes that have large (>1.5 kpc) scale\nheights and low total density at z=1.1 kpc.

To optimize scene coverage and capture\nfine details, 3DGS employs a densification algorithm to generate additional\npoints.

    "abstract": "Hierarchical Text Classification (HTC) involves assigning documents to labels\norganized within a taxonomy. Most previous research on HTC has focused on\nsupervised methods. However, in real-world scenarios, employing supervised HTC\ncan be challenging due to a lack of annotated data. Moreover, HTC often faces\nissues with large label spaces and long-tail distributions. In this work, we\npresent Knowledge Graphs for zero-shot Hierarchical Text Classification\n(KG-HTC), which aims to address these challenges of HTC in applications by\nintegrating knowledge graphs with Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide\nstructured semantic context during classification. Our method retrieves\nrelevant subgraphs from knowledge graphs related to the input text using a\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach. Our KG-HTC can enhance LLMs to\nunderstand label semantics at various hierarchy levels. We evaluate KG-HTC on\nthree open-source HTC datasets: WoS, DBpedia, and Amazon. Our experimental\nresults show that KG-HTC significantly outperforms three baselines in the\nstrict zero-shot setting, particularly achieving substantial improvements at\ndeeper levels of the hierarchy. This evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness\nof incorporating structured knowledge into LLMs to address HTC's challenges in\nlarge label spaces and long-tailed label distributions.

A key\nchallenge towards larger networks is to improve the storage of previously\ngenerated entangled states during new entanglement generation. Here, we\nintroduce a method that uses `spectator' qubits combined with real-time\ndecision making and feedforward to mitigate dephasing of stored quantum states\nduring remote entanglement sequences.

The framework also incorporates practical design\nconstraints such as inter-layer via density and vertical interconnect delay. We\ndemonstrate the capabilities of LaZagna by generating synthesizable RTL that\ncan be taken through full physical design flows for fabric generation, along\nwith functionally correct bitstreams. Furthermore, we conduct five case studies\nthat explore various architectural parameters and evaluate their impact on\nwirelength, critical path delay, and routing runtime. These studies showcase\nthe framework's scalability, flexibility, and effectiveness in guiding future\n3D FPGA architectural and packaging decisions.

Reversible automaton circuits, comprised of classical logic\ngates, have emerged as a tractable means to study such dynamics. Despite\ngenerating no entanglement in the computational basis, these circuits\nnevertheless capture many features expected from fully quantum evolutions. In\nthis work, we demonstrate that the differences between automaton dynamics and\nfully quantum dynamics are revealed by the operator entanglement spectrum, much\nlike the entanglement spectrum of a quantum state distinguishes between the\ndynamics of states under Clifford and Haar random circuits. While the operator\nentanglement spectrum under random unitary dynamics is governed by the\neigenvalue statistics of random Gaussian matrices, we show evidence that under\nrandom automaton dynamics it is described by the statistics of Bernoulli random\nmatrices, whose entries are random variables taking values $0$ or $1$. We study\nthe crossover between automaton and generic unitary operator dynamics as the\nautomaton circuit is doped with gates that introduce superpositions, namely\nHadamard or $R_x = e^{-i\\frac{\\pi}{4}X}$ gates. We find that a constant number\nof superposition-generating gates is sufficient to drive the operator dynamics\nto the random-circuit universality class, similar to earlier results on\nClifford circuits doped with $T$ gates.

We construct a\nprobability space whose underlying set consists of $\\sigma$-isomorphism classes\nof weak Schur $\\sigma$-groups and whose measure is constructed from the\nprinciple that the relations defining $G_K$ should be randomly distributed\naccording to the Haar measure. We also compute the measures of certain basic\nsubsets, the result being inversely proportional to the order of the\n$\\sigma$-automorphism group of a certain finite $\\sigma$-$p$-group, as has\noften been observed before. Finally, we show that the $\\sigma$-isomorphism\nclasses of weak Schur $\\sigma$-groups for which each open subgroup has finite\nabelianization form a subset of measure $1$.",

Unlike previous smaller models\nfocused on single RDB tasks, Griffin unifies the data encoder and task decoder\nto handle diverse tasks.

Griffin utilizes\npretraining on both single-table and RDB datasets, employing advanced encoders\nfor categorical, numerical, and metadata features, along with innovative\ncomponents such as cross-attention modules and enhanced message-passing neural\nnetworks (MPNNs) to capture the complexities of relational data. Evaluated on\nlarge-scale, heterogeneous, and temporal graphs extracted from RDBs across\nvarious domains (spanning over 150 million nodes), Griffin demonstrates\nsuperior or comparable performance to individually trained models, excels in\nlow-data scenarios, and shows strong transferability with similarity and\ndiversity in pretraining across new datasets and tasks, highlighting its\npotential as a universally applicable foundation model for RDBs.

In this scenario, binaries form when a star passes through the DM\nminihalo surrounding a PBH and loses sufficient energy due to dynamical\nfriction. The continued energy loss induced by this friction is expected to\ndrive the resulting systems to merge rapidly. We estimate their merger rate and\nexplore the implications for two observables: rapidly decaying X-ray binaries\nin the Milky Way and gravitational waves sourced by compact object mergers. We\nfind that, for a PBH abundance $\\Omega_\\text{PBH}/\\Omega_\\text{DM} = 0.01$,\nthis mechanism naturally produces a population of $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ currently\nobservable short-lived X-ray binaries.

In this work, we present a spectral analysis of the Gaia\nwhite dwarf population up to 500 pc from the Sun based on artificial\nintelligence algorithms to classify the sample into their main spectral types\nand subtypes. In order to classify the sample, which consists of 78 920 white\ndwarfs with available Gaia spectra, we have applied a Random Forest algorithm\nto the Gaia spectral coefficients. We used the Montreal White Dwarf Database of\nalready labeled objects as our training sample. The classified sample is\ncompared with other already published catalogs and with our own higher\nresolution Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) spectra, enabling the construction of\na golden sample of well-classified objects. The Random Forest spectral\nclassification of the 500-pc white dwarf population achieves an excellent\nglobal accuracy of 0.91 and an F1-score of 0.88 for the DA versus non-DA\nclassification. In addition, we obtain a very high accuracy of 0.76 and a\nglobal F1-score of 0.62 for the non-DA subtype classification. In particular,\nour classification shows an excellent recall for DAs, DBs and DCs and a very\ngood precision for DQs, DZs and DOs. The use of machine learning techniques,\nparticularly the Random Forest algorithm, has enabled us to spectrally classify\n78,920 white dwarfs with reasonable accuracy. Having an estimate of the\nspectral type for the vast majority of white dwarfs up to 500 pc provides the\npossibility of making better estimates of cooling ages, star formation rates,\nand stellar evolution processes, among other fundamental aspects for the study\nof the white dwarf population.",

The origin of both classes of objects remains uncertain but is likely\nlinked to the formation and early growth of the first massive black holes\n(MBHs), which may be more easily explained by invoking phases of\nsuper-Eddington accretion. In this study, we use a state-of-the-art zoom-in\ncosmological simulation of a quasar host to investigate whether these objects,\nduring their assembly, can resemble any of the peculiar sources observed with\nJWST. We find that the impact of MBH feedback on star formation is typically\nmoderate, with outflows preferentially escaping perpendicular to the galactic\ndisc. However, for approximately ten percent of the galaxy's lifetime, the\nsystem enters a distinct quenched phase, after a rapid MBH growth driven by\nsuper-Eddington accretion. This phase culminates in a powerful feedback event,\nduring which the MBH jet and disc-driven winds interact directly with the\ngalactic disc, carving out a central cavity. We also find that, during the\nhistory of the quasar host progenitor, the spectral properties of the system\ncan resemble both LRDs and quenched galaxies, depending on the specific\nevolutionary stage considered.

    "abstract": "Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) are X-ray binary systems containing an\naccreting neutron star (NS) or black hole emitting at luminosities above the\nEddington limit of a $10M_{\\odot}$ black hole. Approximately 1900 (either\nconfirmed or candidate) ULXs have been identified to date. Three systems have\nbeen confirmed to exhibit coherent signals consistent with NS spin frequencies\nand quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in the mHz range. Several\ninterpretations for generating such QPOs have been proposed, including general\nrelativistic frame-dragging effects. In this work, we test if an alternative\nmodel in which magnetically-driven precession of the inner accretion flow can\nself-consistently reproduce the observed NS spin and QPO frequencies for\nreasonable values for accretion rates and NS magnetic field strengths. For a\nrange of parameters, we recover family of solutions with accretion rates\n$\\approx10^{-7}$--$10^{-5}$\\,M$_{\\odot}$\\,yr$^{-1}$ and surface magnetic fields\n$\\gtrsim10^{12}$\\,G, in agreement with previous estimates. If validated, this\ninterpretation could reconcile several observed properties of pulsating ULXs,\nincluding QPO frequencies and the observed high luminosities of these systems,\nin a self-consistent framework without requiring general relativistic effects\nand/or strong beaming due to specific viewing angles. Although the predictive\npower of the model is currently limited by parameter degeneracies and\nuncertainties, searching for and discovering more pulsating ULX systems will\nallow to further test or refute the proposed model.",

GMCs\nexhibit remarkably universal properties, including mass function, size,\nturbulence, and surface density, regardless of the environment in which they\nare identified. The global gas depletion time (and the Kennicutt-Schmidt\nrelation) is determined by the GMC mass fraction in the ISM, while the\ncloud-scale SFE shows little variation.

Nearly-equal-mass\nbinaries behave similarly to their equal-mass counterparts: prograde binaries\ninspiral, albeit somewhat slowly, and have their eccentricities damped;\nretrograde binaries inspiral $\\sim2-3$ times faster than their prograde\ncounterparts, and those with near-equal masses are driven quickly towards\nnear-unity eccentricities.

Additionally, we find that while accretion drives\nprograde binaries towards equal masses thanks to the exchange of material\nbetween the primary and secondary accretion disks, retrograde binaries are\ndriven slowly towards more extreme mass ratios. Prograde binaries, and\ngenerally those with low mass ratios, likely accrete for multiple $e$-folding\ntimescales before merger.

To achieve this, we\nconstruct a large-scale, physically stable dataset of brick structures, along\nwith their associated captions, and train an autoregressive large language\nmodel to predict the next brick to add via next-token prediction. To improve\nthe stability of the resulting designs, we employ an efficient validity check\nand physics-aware rollback during autoregressive inference, which prunes\ninfeasible token predictions using physics laws and assembly constraints.

For a wide class of functions one can quickly compute the phases\napplying a desired function to the signal; surprisingly, this ability can be\nshown to unify many quantum algorithms. A separate, basic subfield in quantum\ncomputing is gate approximation: among its results, the Solovay-Kitaev theorem\n(SKT) establishes an equivalence between the universality of a gate set and its\nability to efficiently approximate other gates.\n  In this work we prove an 'SKT for QSP,' showing that the density of\nparameterized circuit ans\\\"atze in classes of functions implies the existence\nof short circuits approximating desired functions. This is quite distinct from\na pointwise application of the usual SKT, and yields a suite of independently\ninteresting 'lifted' variants of standard SKT proof techniques. Our method\nfurnishes alternative, flexible proofs for results in QSP, extends simply to\nans\\\"atze for which standard QSP proof methods fail, and establishes a formal\nintersection between QSP and gate approximation.",

    "abstract": "We re-examine the deep-focus methodology of time-distance helioseismology\npreviously used to estimate the power spectrum of the solar convection at a\ndepth of about 30 Mm, which was found to be significantly weaker than predicted\nby theory and simulations. The Global Acoustic, Linearized Euler (GALE) and\nEulerian Lagrangian (EULAG) codes are used to generate ground-truth simulations\nthrough which the accuracy of the convective power spectrum can be evaluated.\nThis validation process shows that the power spectrum diverges significantly\nfrom ground truth beyond spatial scales corresponding to the spherical harmonic\ndegree $\\ell=15$ - $30$ because of the limited resolution of helioseismic\nmeasurements. However, the power estimated at larger spatial scales ($\\ell<15$)\nis sufficiently accurate. We then apply the methodology to solar data and find\na spectrum that is substantially stronger than previously reported. We discuss\nsome possible differences in methodology that might have led to the initial\nunder-estimation of solar convective power. The new spectra are in line with\nrecent hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic simulations of solar convection and\nalso consistent with the previous inferences obtained by the ring-diagram\nlocal-helioseismology method.",

    "abstract": "With the recent success of large language models (LLMs), the idea of\nAI-augmented Business Process Management systems is becoming more feasible. One\nof their essential characteristics is the ability to be conversationally\nactionable, allowing humans to interact with the LLM effectively to perform\ncrucial process life cycle tasks such as process model design and redesign.\nHowever, most current research focuses on single-prompt execution and\nevaluation of results, rather than on continuous interaction between the user\nand the LLM. In this work, we aim to explore the feasibility of using LLMs to\nempower domain experts in the creation and redesign of process models in an\niterative and effective way. The proposed conversational process model redesign\n(CPD) approach receives as input a process model and a redesign request by the\nuser in natural language. Instead of just letting the LLM make changes, the LLM\nis employed to (a) identify process change patterns from literature, (b)\nre-phrase the change request to be aligned with an expected wording for the\nidentified pattern (i.e., the meaning), and then to (c) apply the meaning of\nthe change to the process model. This multi-step approach allows for\nexplainable and reproducible changes. In order to ensure the feasibility of the\nCPD approach, and to find out how well the patterns from literature can be\nhandled by the LLM, we performed an extensive evaluation. The results show that\nsome patterns are hard to understand by LLMs and by users. Within the scope of\nthe study, we demonstrated that users need support to describe the changes\nclearly. Overall the evaluation shows that the LLMs can handle most changes\nwell according to a set of completeness and correctness criteria.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning has become a powerful tool for enhancing data assimilation.\nWhile supervised learning remains the standard method, reinforcement learning\n(RL) offers unique advantages through its sequential decision-making framework,\nwhich naturally fits the iterative nature of data assimilation by dynamically\nbalancing model forecasts with observations. We develop RL-DAUNCE, a new\nRL-based method that enhances data assimilation with physical constraints\nthrough three key aspects. First, RL-DAUNCE inherits the computational\nefficiency of machine learning while it uniquely structures its agents to\nmirror ensemble members in conventional data assimilation methods. Second,\nRL-DAUNCE emphasizes uncertainty quantification by advancing multiple ensemble\nmembers, moving beyond simple mean-state optimization. Third, RL-DAUNCE's\nensemble-as-agents design facilitates the enforcement of physical constraints\nduring the assimilation process, which is crucial to improving the state\nestimation and subsequent forecasting. A primal-dual optimization strategy is\ndeveloped to enforce constraints, which dynamically penalizes the reward\nfunction to ensure constraint satisfaction throughout the learning process.\nAlso, state variable bounds are respected by constraining the RL action space.\nTogether, these features ensure physical consistency without sacrificing\nefficiency. RL-DAUNCE is applied to the Madden-Julian Oscillation, an\nintermittent atmospheric phenomenon characterized by strongly non-Gaussian\nfeatures and multiple physical constraints. RL-DAUNCE outperforms the standard\nensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), which fails catastrophically due to the\nviolation of physical constraints. Notably, RL-DAUNCE matches the performance\nof constrained EnKF, particularly in recovering intermittent signals, capturing\nextreme events, and quantifying uncertainties, while requiring substantially\nless computational effort.",

This implies that\nadditional DM components could coexist with PBHs, one of which could form \"dark\ndresses\" (DDs) around PBHs. DDs would cause PBH binaries to experience\ndynamical friction (DF), which would accelerate their inspirals with respect to\nthose in vacuum. Ignoring DF effects in matched-filtering searches could lead\nto significant sensitivity loss, especially in systems with asymmetric\nmass-ratios of q ~ 10^{-3}. We thus show that a method designed to find\ntime-frequency power-law tracks from inspiraling PBHs in vacuum could actually\nhandle the presence of DDs with minimal modifications. This method, the\ngeneralized frequency-Hough (GFH), maps points in the detector's time-frequency\nplane to lines in the source parameter space.

Our analysis differs\nfrom earlier, related, studies by treating the case where the dilaton's\ncouplings to matter are large enough to require screening to avoid unacceptable\ndilaton-mediated forces in the solar system. We use a recently proposed\nscreening mechanism that exploits the interplay between\nstronger-than-gravitational axion-matter couplings with the 2-derivative\naxion-dilaton interactions to suppress the couplings of the dilaton to bulk\nmatter. The required axion-matter couplings also modify cosmology, with the\naxion's background energy density turning out to resemble early dark energy. We\ncompute the properties of the axion fluid describing the rapid oscillations of\nthe axion field around the time-dependent minimum of its matter-dependent\neffective potential, extending the usual formalism to include nontrivial\nkinetic sigma-model interactions. We explore the implications of these models\nfor the Cosmic Microwave Background and the growth of structure and find that\nfor dilaton potentials of the Albrecht-Skordis form (itself well-motivated by\nUV physics), successful screening can be consistent with the early dark energy\ntemporarily comprising as much as 10% of the total density in the past.

Most of these\nmodels assume star formation efficiencies (SFE) of only a few percent,\nmotivated by observations of nearby galaxies. In this work, we incorporate a\nscaling of SFE with gas surface density (which we refer to as Density Modulated\nSFE; DMSFE), motivated by cloud-scale simulations and theory, into a\nsemi-analytic cosmological model (SAM) of galaxy formation which is calibrated\nto match the observed rest-UV sizes of high redshift galaxies. We also model\nthe impact of dust and bursty star formation on the SAM-predicted properties of\nobserved galaxies. We show that with plausible values of the main parameters,\nsuch as the fraction of gas in dense clouds $f_{\\rm dense}$, our new models\neasily reproduce or even exceed the observed galaxy number densities at $z\\sim\n6$-17. While no single value of $f_{\\rm dense}$ is able to reproduce the very\nshallow observed decline of the galaxy number density at $z\\gtrsim 12$, it is\nplausible and even expected for $f_{\\rm dense}$ to have some effective\ndependence on cosmic time, which could bring these models into closer agreement\nwith the data. We show that the combined effects of DMSFE, decreasing dust\nattenuation, and increasingly bursty star formation at earlier cosmic epochs\ncould conspire to reproduce the observed evolution.",

Cells forming\ntwo-dimensional epithelial tissues behave as active materials that undergo\nremodeling and spontaneous shape changes. Focussing on the fly wing as a model\nsystem, we find that the cellular packing in the wing epithelium transitions\nfrom a disordered packing to an ordered, crystalline packing. We investigate\nbiophysical mechanisms controlling this crystallization process. While previous\nstudies propose a role of tissue shear flow in establishing the ordered cell\npacking in the fly wing, we reveal a role of cell size heterogeneity. Indeed,\nwe find that even if tissue shear have been inhibited, cell packings in the\nfruit fly wing epithelium transition from disordered to an ordered packing. We\npropose that the transition is controlled by the cell size heterogeneity, which\nis quantified by the cell size polydispersity. We use the vertex model of\nepithelial tissues to show that there is a critical value of cell size\npolydispersity above which cellular packings are disordered and below which\nthey form a crystalline packing. By analyzing experimental data we find that\ncell size polydispersity decreases during fly wing development. The observed\ndynamics of tissue crystallisation is consistent with the slow ordering\nkinetics we observe in the vertex model. Therefore, although tissue shear does\nnot control the transition, it significantly enhances the rate of tissue scale\nordering by facilitating alingment of locally ordered crystallites.",

We point out that quantum many-body scars exist\nfor any nearest-neighbor spin-$S$ XYZ quantum spin chain, and arise in the form\nof an infinite family of highly excited yet nonentangled product-state\neigenstates, which define periodic textures in spin space. This set of scars,\ndiscovered originally by Granovskii and Zhedanov in 1985, encompasses both the\nexperimentally relevant 'spin helices' for XXZ chains and more complicated\nhelix-like states constructed from Jacobi elliptic functions for generic XYZ\nchains. An appealing feature of Granovskii-Zhedanov scars is that they are\nwell-defined in the semiclassical limit $S \\to \\infty$, which allows for a\nsystematic and analytical treatment of their dynamical instability to\nperturbations of the Hamiltonian. Using time-dependent spin-wave theory, we\npredict that upon perturbing along certain directions in Hamiltonian space,\nGranovskii-Zhedanov scars exhibit a dramatic asymmetry in their decay:\ndepending on the sign of the perturbation, the decrease of their contrast is\neither slow and linear, or fast and exponential in time. This asymmetry can be\ntraced to the absence (presence) of imaginarity in the spectrum of the\nBogoliubov Hamiltonian governing quantum fluctuations about the scar, which\ncorresponds to the absence (presence) of a non-zero Lyapunov exponent for the\nlimiting classical trajectory. Numerical simulations using matrix product\nstates (MPS) and infinite time-evolving block decimation (iTEBD) confirm that\nour prediction remains valid even far from the semiclassical limit. Our\nfindings challenge existing theories of how quantum-many body scars relax.",

To\nthis end, we first demonstrate that the open dynamics of CMs with sequentially\ngenerated correlations between groups of ancillas can be mapped onto a\ncomposite CM, where the memory part of the environment is incorporated into an\nenlarged Markovian system. We then apply this framework to an all-qubit CM, and\nshow that non-Markovian behavior emerges only when the next incoming pair of\nancillas are entangled prior to colliding with the system. On the other hand,\nwhen system-ancilla collisions precede ancilla-ancilla entanglement, we find\nthe open dynamics to always be Markovian.

    "abstract": "Data quality has become a key factor in enhancing model performance with the\nrapid development of large language models (LLMs). Model-driven data filtering\nhas increasingly become a primary approach for acquiring high-quality data.\nHowever, it still faces two main challenges: (1) the lack of an efficient data\nverification strategy makes it difficult to provide timely feedback on data\nquality; and (2) the selection of seed data for training classifiers lacks\nclear criteria and relies heavily on human expertise, introducing a degree of\nsubjectivity. To address the first challenge, we introduce an efficient\nverification strategy that enables rapid evaluation of the impact of data on\nLLM training with minimal computational cost. To tackle the second challenge,\nwe build upon the assumption that high-quality seed data is beneficial for LLM\ntraining, and by integrating the proposed verification strategy, we optimize\nthe selection of positive and negative samples and propose an efficient data\nfiltering pipeline. This pipeline not only improves filtering efficiency,\nclassifier quality, and robustness, but also significantly reduces experimental\nand inference costs. In addition, to efficiently filter high-quality data, we\nemploy a lightweight classifier based on fastText, and successfully apply the\nfiltering pipeline to two widely-used pre-training corpora, FineWeb and Chinese\nFineWeb datasets, resulting in the creation of the higher-quality Ultra-FineWeb\ndataset. Ultra-FineWeb contains approximately 1 trillion English tokens and 120\nbillion Chinese tokens. Empirical results demonstrate that the LLMs trained on\nUltra-FineWeb exhibit significant performance improvements across multiple\nbenchmark tasks, validating the effectiveness of our pipeline in enhancing both\ndata quality and training efficiency.",

In response to the urgent need for a specialized\nliterary evaluation metric, we introduce LiTransProQA, a novel, reference-free,\nLLM-based question-answering framework designed for literary translation\nevaluation. LiTransProQA uniquely integrates insights from professional\nliterary translators and researchers, focusing on critical elements in literary\nquality assessment such as literary devices, cultural understanding, and\nauthorial voice.

The key to forming effective mechanisms for information\nprocessing appears in the system's intrinsic relaxation abilities. These are\nprobed without actually enforcing a specific inference goal. The dynamical\nregime that achieves optimal computation is located just below a critical\ndamping threshold, involving a relaxation with multiple stages, and is readable\nat the single-particle level. At the many-body level, it yields substrates\nrobustly optimal for RC across varying physical parameters and inference tasks.\nA system in this regime exhibits a strong diversity of dynamic mechanisms under\nhighly fluctuating driving forces.

However, both the reproducibility of the quantized thermal\nHall conductivity and the fundamental nature of the associated heat carriers,\nwhether bosonic or fermionic, are subjects of ongoing and vigorous debate. In a\nrecent theoretical work, it was proposed that varying the sample geometry\nthrough creating constrictions can distinguish between different origins of the\nthermal Hall effect in magnetic insulators. Here, we provide experimental\nevidence of chiral fermion edge modes by comparing the thermal Hall effect of a\ngeometrically constricted $\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ sample with that of an\nunconstricted bulk sample. In contrast to the bulk crystals where the thermal\nHall signal fades below 5\\,K, the constricted crystals display a significant\nthermal Hall signal that remains measurable even at 2\\,K. This sharp difference\nagrees well with the theoretical prediction and provides compelling evidence\nfor the contribution of chiral fermion edge modes to the thermal Hall effect in\n$\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$.

With the\nincreasing presence of artificial agents in daily life, it is essential to\nunderstand how people perceive and trust these agents.

Despite growing interest in trust and the UVE, existing research\nvaries widely in terms of how these concepts are defined and operationalized.\nThis inconsistency raises important questions about how and under what\nconditions the UVE influences trust in agents. A systematic understanding of\ntheir relationship is currently lacking. This review aims to examine the impact\nof the UVE on human trust in agents and to identify methodological patterns,\nlimitations, and gaps in the existing empirical literature. Following PRISMA\nguidelines, a systematic search identified 53 empirical studies that\ninvestigated both UVE-related constructs and trust or trust-related outcomes.\nStudies were analyzed based on a structured set of categories, including types\nof agents and interactions, methodological and measurement approaches, and key\nfindings.

This review offers a novel\nframework for classifying trust measurement approaches with regard to the\nbest-practice criteria for empirically investigating the UVE.

A Fermi surface with\nreduced symmetry is intimately tied to unusual transport properties such as\nanomalous Hall effect and nonlinear Hall effect. Here, combining theoretical\ncalculations and transport measurements, we report the discovery of a new class\nof bulk Fermi surface structure with unprecedented low symmetry, the ``Fermi\nlune\", with peculiar crescent shaped Fermi energy contours, in rhombohedral\nmultilayer graphene. This emergent Fermi-lune structure driven by\nelectron-electron interactions spontaneously breaks time-reversal, mirror, and\nrotational symmetries, leading to two distinctive phenomena: giant intrinsic\nnon-reciprocity in longitudinal transport and a new type of magnetism termed\n``transdimensional orbital magnetism\". Coupling the Fermi lune to a\nsuperlattice potential further produces a novel Chern insulator exhibiting\nquantized anomalous Hall effect controlled by in-plane magnetic field. Our work\nunveils a new symmetry breaking state of matter in the transdimensional regime,\nwhich opens an avenue for exploring correlated and topological quantum\nphenomena in symmetry breaking phases.",

While benchmarks have been the primary method for\nestimating model capabilities, they often fail to establish true upper bounds\nor predict deployment behavior. This literature review consolidates the rapidly\nevolving field of AI safety evaluations, proposing a systematic taxonomy around\nthree dimensions: what properties we measure, how we measure them, and how\nthese measurements integrate into frameworks. We show how evaluations go beyond\nbenchmarks by measuring what models can do when pushed to the limit\n(capabilities), the behavioral tendencies exhibited by default (propensities),\nand whether our safety measures remain effective even when faced with\nsubversive adversarial AI (control). These properties are measured through\nbehavioral techniques like scaffolding, red teaming and supervised fine-tuning,\nalongside internal techniques such as representation analysis and mechanistic\ninterpretability. We provide deeper explanations of some safety-critical\ncapabilities like cybersecurity exploitation, deception, autonomous\nreplication, and situational awareness, alongside concerning propensities like\npower-seeking and scheming. The review explores how these evaluation methods\nintegrate into governance frameworks to translate results into concrete\ndevelopment decisions. We also highlight challenges to safety evaluations -\nproving absence of capabilities, potential model sandbagging, and incentives\nfor \"safetywashing\" - while identifying promising research directions.

    "abstract": "Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) is emerging as a promising approach for edge\nAI, offering a balance between accuracy and efficiency. However, current\nHDC-based applications often rely on high-precision models and/or encoding\nmatrices to achieve competitive performance, which imposes significant\ncomputational and memory demands, especially for ultra-low power devices. While\nrecent efforts use techniques like precision reduction and pruning to increase\nthe efficiency, most require retraining to maintain performance, making them\nexpensive and impractical. To address this issue, we propose a novel Post\nTraining Compression algorithm, Decomposition-Pruning-Quantization (DPQ-HD),\nwhich aims at compressing the end-to-end HDC system, achieving near floating\npoint performance without the need of retraining. DPQ-HD reduces computational\nand memory overhead by uniquely combining the above three compression\ntechniques and efficiently adapts to hardware constraints. Additionally, we\nintroduce an energy-efficient inference approach that progressively evaluates\nsimilarity scores such as cosine similarity and performs early exit to reduce\nthe computation, accelerating prediction inference while maintaining accuracy.\nWe demonstrate that DPQ-HD achieves up to 20-100x reduction in memory for image\nand graph classification tasks with only a 1-2% drop in accuracy compared to\nuncompressed workloads. Lastly, we show that DPQ-HD outperforms the existing\npost-training compression methods and performs better or at par with\nretraining-based state-of-the-art techniques, requiring significantly less\noverall optimization time (up to 100x) and faster inference (up to 56x) on a\nmicrocontroller",

In particular, underground hydrogen storage offers a promising\nsolution for integrating large-scale renewable energy into the power grid. When\ninjected into the subsurface, hydrogen's low viscosity compared to the resident\nbrine causes it to spread rapidly, forming a thin gas layer above the brine,\ncomplicating recovery. In long aquifers, the large viscous pressure drop\nbetween the source and the outlet induces significant pressure variations,\nwhich may lead to substantial density changes in the injected gas. To examine\nthe role of gas compressibility in the spreading dynamics, we use long-wave\ntheory to derive coupled nonlinear evolution equations for the gas pressure and\nliquid/gas interface height, focusing on the limit of long domains, weak gas\ncompressibility and low liquid/gas mobility ratio. Simulations using these\nequations are supplemented with a comprehensive asymptotic analysis of\nparameter regimes. Unlike the near-incompressible limit, in which gas spreading\nrates are dictated by the source strength and mobility ratio, and any\ncompressive effects are transient, we show how, in general, compression of the\nmain gas bubble can generate dynamic pressure changes that are coupled to those\nin the thin gas layer that spreads over the liquid, with compressive effects\nhaving a sustained influence along the layer. This allows compressibility to\nreduce spreading rates and lower gas pressures. We characterise this behaviour\nvia a set of low-order models that reveal dominant scalings, highlighting the\nrole of compressibility in mediating the evolution of the gas layer.",

    "abstract": "Electrocardiogram (ECG) classification is crucial for automated cardiac\ndisease diagnosis, yet existing methods often struggle to capture local\nmorphological details and long-range temporal dependencies simultaneously. To\naddress these challenges, we propose Cardioformer, a novel multi-granularity\nhybrid model that integrates cross-channel patching, hierarchical residual\nlearning, and a two-stage self-attention mechanism. Cardioformer first encodes\nmulti-scale token embeddings to capture fine-grained local features and global\ncontextual information and then selectively fuses these representations through\nintra- and inter-granularity self-attention. Extensive evaluations on three\nbenchmark ECG datasets under subject-independent settings demonstrate that\nmodel consistently outperforms four state-of-the-art baselines. Our\nCardioformer model achieves the AUROC of 96.34$\\pm$0.11, 89.99$\\pm$0.12, and\n95.59$\\pm$1.66 in MIMIC-IV, PTB-XL and PTB dataset respectively outperforming\nPatchTST, Reformer, Transformer, and Medformer models. It also demonstrates\nstrong cross-dataset generalization, achieving 49.18% AUROC on PTB and 68.41%\non PTB-XL when trained on MIMIC-IV. These findings underscore the potential of\nCardioformer to advance automated ECG analysis, paving the way for more\naccurate and robust cardiovascular disease diagnosis.

We\ninvestigate these effects in the X-ray emission of the Intermediate Polar IGR\nJ17195-4100 by carrying out the X-ray spectral analysis, spin modulation and\nhardness ratio. We present high-sensitivity broadband X-ray spectral analysis\nby combining NuSTAR and XMM-Newton observations in the 0.3-78.0 keV energy\nrange. The X-ray spectral analysis is performed using six composite models,\nincluding the angle-dependent reflection model (reflect), multi-temperature\nplasma emission models (CEVMKL, MKCFLOW), and photoionised and/or neutral\npartially covering absorption models (zxipcf, pcfabs) within XSPEC. We examine\nalso the spin modulation in four energy ranges and the hardness ratio, to\ndetermine the absorption and scattering effects. We find that the spectrum is\nbest modelled with a reflection amplitude ($\\Omega$) of 0.58\n$^{+0.38}_{-0.26}$, an ionisation parameter, log($\\xi$), of\n1.46$^{+0.44}_{-0.23}$ with an equivalent hydrogen column density of\n3.09$^{+2.26}_{-0.68}$ $\\times$ 10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$, a neutral absorber, and a\nmulti-temperature plasma temperature of 27.14$^{+2.0}_{-2.13}$ keV.

To address these challenges\nand guide the photonic design, we develop a theoretical framework to analyze\ndew-harvesting in a 24-h day-night cycle. Using Nanjing as an example, our\nanalyses reveal that, in the solar regime, a minimum average solar reflectivity\nof 0.92 is required; in the infrared regime, a 10% reduction in absorptivity\noutside the 8-13 um transparency window is equivalent to a 5.9% enhancement in\nemissivity within the window. Guided by these findings, we propose a photonic\ndesign, which, in a synthetic experiment with measured meteorological datasets,\nachieves a water production rate of 313 g/m2-day, in which nearly 40% is\ncontributed by daytime. This performance reaches approximately 70% of the\ntheoretical maximum predicted using the ideal spectrum. We end by optimizing\nthe layout of condensers in practical applications.",

To some extent, the key to the performance of a\npoint cloud detector lies in the receptive field of the network and the ability\nto effectively utilize the scene context. The recent emergence of Mamba, based\non State Space Model (SSM), has shaken up the traditional convolution and\ntransformers that have long been the foundational building blocks, due to its\nefficient global receptive field. In this work, we introduce Mamba to\npillar-based roadside point cloud perception and propose a framework based on\nCross-stage State-space Group (CSG), called PillarMamba.

    "abstract": "The efficiently computed multiangle centered discrete fractional Fourier\ntransform (MA-CDFRFT) [1] has proven as a useful tool for time-frequency\nanalysis; however, its scope is limited to the centered discrete fractional\nFourier transform (CDFRFT). Meanwhile, extensive research on the standard DFRFT\nhas lead to a better understanding of this transform as well as numerous\npossible choices for eigenvectors for implementation. In this letter we present\na simple adaptation of the MA-CDFRFT which allows us to efficiently compute its\nstandard counterpart, which we call the multiangle DFRFT (MA-DFRFT).\nFurthermore, we formalize the symmetries inherent to the MA-CDFRFT and MA-DFRFT\nto halve the number of FFTs needed to compute these transforms, paving the way\nfor applications in resource constrained environments.",

    "abstract": "Open Radio Access Network (Open RAN) is a new paradigm to provide fundamental\nfeatures for supporting next-generation mobile networks. Disaggregation,\nvirtualisation, closed-loop data-driven control, and open interfaces bring\nflexibility and interoperability to the network deployment. However, these\nfeatures also create a new surface for security threats. In this paper, we\nintroduce Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) poisoning attack in Near Real-Time\ncontrol loops as a new form of threat that can have significant effects on the\nOpen RAN functionality. This threat can arise from traffic spoofing on the E2\ninterface or compromised E2 nodes. The role of KPIs is explored in the use\ncases of Near Real-Time control loops. Then, the potential impacts of the\nattack are analysed. An ML-based approach is proposed to detect poisoned KPI\nvalues before using them in control loops. Emulations are conducted to generate\nKPI reports and inject anomalies into the values. A Long Short-Term Memory\n(LSTM) neural network model is used to detect anomalies. The results show that\nmore amplified injected values are more accessible to detect, and using more\nreport sequences leads to better performance in anomaly detection, with\ndetection rates improving from 62% to 99%.",

The\naddition of electrolytes to these dispersions may influence their\nzeta-potential, thus potentially affecting their physicochemical properties.\nThe electrolyte- and pH- driven gelation of aqueous dispersions of commercial\nsucrose stearate (S970) containing ca. 1:1 monoesters and diesters was studied\nusing optical microscopy, rheological and zeta-potential measurements, and\nsmall-angle X-ray scattering techniques. At low electrolyte concentrations and\npH $\\gtrapprox$ 5, 0.5-5 wt. % S970 dispersions exhibited low viscosities and\nbehaved as freely flowing liquids. The addition of electrolytes of low\nconcentrations, e.g. 9 mM NaCl or 1.5 mM MgCl$_2$, induced the formation of a\nnon-flowing gels. This sol-gel transition occurred due to the partial screening\nof the diesters particles charge, allowing the formation of an attractive gel\nnetwork, spanning across the dispersion volume. Complete charge screening,\nhowever, led to a gel-sol transition and phase separation. Gel formation was\nobserved also by pH variation without electrolyte addition, whereas the\naddition of free fatty acids had negligible impact on dispersion properties.\nThese findings support the hypothesis that the negative charge in sucrose ester\ndispersions arises from hydroxyl anions adsorption on particles surfaces. Gels\nwere formed using just 1.3 wt. % surfactant, and the critical electrolyte\nconcentration for gelation was found to scale approximately with the square of\nthe cation charge, in agreement with the low surface charge density theory. The\nbiodegradable sucrose esters gels offer a sustainable alternative for\nstructuring personal and home care products, replacing the wormlike micelles of\nsynthetic surfactants typically used at much higher surfactant and salt\nconcentrations.",

To reconstruct the hair purely from the observed geometry, our\nmethod finds sharp surface features directly on the scan and estimates strand\norientation through a neural 2D line detector applied to the renderings of scan\nshading. Additionally, we incorporate a diffusion prior trained on a diverse\nset of synthetic hair scans, refined with an improved noise schedule, and\nadapted to the reconstructed contents via a scan-specific text prompt. We\ndemonstrate that this combination of supervision signals enables accurate\nreconstruction of both simple and intricate hairstyles without relying on color\ninformation.

    "abstract": "Recently, spiking neural networks (SNNs), deployed on neuromorphic chips,\nprovide highly efficient solutions on edge devices in different scenarios.\nHowever, their ability to adapt to distribution shifts after deployment has\nbecome a crucial challenge. Online test-time adaptation (OTTA) offers a\npromising solution by enabling models to dynamically adjust to new data\ndistributions without requiring source data or labeled target samples.\nNevertheless, existing OTTA methods are largely designed for traditional\nartificial neural networks and are not well-suited for SNNs. To address this\ngap, we propose a low-power, neuromorphic chip-friendly online test-time\nadaptation framework, aiming to enhance model generalization under distribution\nshifts. The proposed approach is called Threshold Modulation (TM), which\ndynamically adjusts the firing threshold through neuronal dynamics-inspired\nnormalization, being more compatible with neuromorphic hardware. Experimental\nresults on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in\nimproving the robustness of SNNs against distribution shifts while maintaining\nlow computational cost. The proposed method offers a practical solution for\nonline test-time adaptation of SNNs, providing inspiration for the design of\nfuture neuromorphic chips.

    "abstract": "Estimating a child's age from ocular biometric images is challenging due to\nsubtle physiological changes and the limited availability of longitudinal\ndatasets. Although most biometric age estimation studies have focused on facial\nfeatures and adult subjects, pediatric-specific analysis, particularly of the\niris and periocular regions, remains relatively unexplored. This study presents\na comparative evaluation of iris and periocular images for estimating the ages\nof children aged between 4 and 16 years. We utilized a longitudinal dataset\ncomprising more than 21,000 near-infrared (NIR) images, collected from 288\npediatric subjects over eight years using two different imaging sensors. A\nmulti-task deep learning framework was employed to jointly perform age\nprediction and age-group classification, enabling a systematic exploration of\nhow different convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures, particularly\nthose adapted for non-square ocular inputs, capture the complex variability\ninherent in pediatric eye images. The results show that periocular models\nconsistently outperform iris-based models, achieving a mean absolute error\n(MAE) of 1.33 years and an age-group classification accuracy of 83.82%. These\nresults mark the first demonstration that reliable age estimation is feasible\nfrom children's ocular images, enabling privacy-preserving age checks in\nchild-centric applications. This work establishes the first longitudinal\nbenchmark for pediatric ocular age estimation, providing a foundation for\ndesigning robust, child-focused biometric systems. The developed models proved\nresilient across different imaging sensors, confirming their potential for\nreal-world deployment. They also achieved inference speeds of less than 10\nmilliseconds per image on resource-constrained VR headsets, demonstrating their\nsuitability for real-time applications.",

The\nautomated analysis qualitatively reproduced key findings from the expert-based\nstudy, including significant differences in fast spindle densities between\nbipolar patients and healthy controls, accomplishing in minutes what previously\ntook months to complete manually. While the results of the automated analysis\ndiffered quantitatively from the expert-based study, possibly due to biases\nbetween expert raters or between raters and the models, the models individually\nperformed at or above inter-rater agreement for both sleep staging and spindle\ndetection.

We present Walrus, a novel\ndecentralized blob storage system that addresses these limitations through\nmultiple technical innovations. At the core of Walrus is RedStuff, a\ntwo-dimensional erasure coding protocol that achieves high security with only\n4.5x replication factor, while enabling self-healing recovery that requires\nbandwidth proportional to only the lost data $(O(|blob|/n)$ versus $O(|blob|)$\nin traditional systems).

Our system incorporates\nauthenticated data structures to defend against malicious clients and ensures\ndata consistency throughout storage and retrieval processes. Experimental\nevaluation demonstrates that Walrus achieves practical performance at scale,\nmaking it suitable for a wide range of decentralized applications requiring\nhigh-integrity, available blob storage with reasonable overhead.",

This synergistic design enables gradual\nresolution enhancement from 10m to 1m while preserving fine-grained spatial\ntextures, and ensures high classification fidelity through effective\ncross-scale feature fusion. This method has been successfully applied to the\nYangtze River Economic Belt (YREB), a region characterized by complex\nurban-rural patterns and diverse topography. As a result, a comprehensive ISA\nmapping product for 2021, referred to as ISA-1, was generated, covering an area\nof over 2.2 million square kilometers. Quantitative comparisons against the 10m\nESA WorldCover and other benchmark products reveal that ISA-1 achieves an\nF1-score of 85.71%, outperforming bilinear-interpolation-based segmentation by\n9.5%, and surpassing other ISA datasets by 21.43%-61.07%.

With\nno intervention, 16% of the population was infected (25th percentile, 75th\npercentiles of simulations: 15.3%, 16.6%). With vaccination and behavior change\nin only the 25% of individuals most likely to have a one-time partner,\ncumulative infections were reduced by 30%, or a total reduction in nearly 500\ninfections. Earlier intervention further reduces cumulative infections;\nbeginning vaccination a year before the outbreak results in only 5.5% of men\nbeing infected, averting 950 infections or nearly 10% of the total population\nin our model. We also show that sustained partnerships drive the early\noutbreak, while one-time partnerships drive transmission after the first\ninitial weeks. The median effective reproductive number, Rt, at t = 0 days is\n1.30 for casual partnerships, 1.00 for main, and 0.6 for one-time. By t = 28,\nthe median Rt for one-time partnerships has more than doubled to 1.48, while it\ndecreased for casual and main partnerships: 0.46 and 0.29, respectively.

In this study, the accuracy of those PWV measurements\nby the GNSS stations was assessed by comparing the H.E.S.S. installed GNSS\nstation PWV measurements to that from a 210 GHz Water Vapour Radiometer (WVR)\nalso installed at the H.E.S.S. site. A correlation of 98% and an offset of 0.34\nmm was found between the GNSS station and the 210 GHz WVR PWV data when on-site\npressure and the Nevada Geodetic Laboratory (NGL) weighted mean temperature\n($\\mathrm{T_m}$) were used calculate the GNSS station PWV data. In comparison,\nthe offset reduces to 0.15 mm when on-site derived $\\mathrm{T_m}$ and pressure\nwere used to calculate the GNSS station PWV. The results show that the GNSS\nstation with on-site meteorological data can be used with high accuracy to\nreliably determine the PWV conditions at the H.E.S.S. site.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the robustness of online learning algorithms when\nlearners possess private information. No-external-regret algorithms, prevalent\nin machine learning, are vulnerable to strategic manipulation, allowing an\nadaptive opponent to extract full surplus. Even standard\nno-weak-external-regret algorithms, designed for optimal learning in stationary\nenvironments, exhibit similar vulnerabilities. This raises a fundamental\nquestion: can a learner simultaneously prevent full surplus extraction by\nadaptive opponents while maintaining optimal performance in well-behaved\nenvironments? To address this, we model the problem as a two-player repeated\ngame, where the learner with private information plays against the environment,\nfacing ambiguity about the environment's types: stationary or adaptive. We\nintroduce \\emph{partial safety} as a key design criterion for online learning\nalgorithms to prevent full surplus extraction. We then propose the\n\\emph{Explore-Exploit-Punish} (\\textsf{EEP}) algorithm and prove that it\nsatisfies partial safety while achieving optimal learning in stationary\nenvironments, and has a variant that delivers improved welfare performance. Our\nfindings highlight the risks of applying standard online learning algorithms in\nstrategic settings with adverse selection.

We address these limitations by creating a database of images with\nminimal semantic content and devising, and next exploiting, a method to\ngenerate images on the ugly side of aesthetic valuations. The resulting Minimum\nSemantic Content (MSC) database consists of a large and balanced collection of\n10,426 images, each evaluated by 100 observers. We next use established image\nmetrics to demonstrate how augmenting an image set biased towards beautiful\nimages with ugly images can modify, or even invert, an observed relationship\nbetween image features and aesthetics valuation. Taken together, our study\nreveals that works in empirical aesthetics attempting to link image content and\naesthetic judgements may magnify, underestimate, or simply miss interesting\neffects due to a limitation of the range of aesthetic values they consider.",

The proposed\nalgorithm, WOMBAT (Wide Object ML Boosted Algorithm Trigger), comprises a\nhigh-performance Master Model (W-MM) and a quantized, FPGA-synthesizable\nApprentice Model (W-AM), benchmarked against the standard Single Jet 180 and\nthe custom rule-based JEDI (Jet Event Deterministic Identifier) triggers.\n  All algorithms process calorimeter trigger primitive data to localize boosted\n$H\\rightarrow b\\bar{b}$ jets. Outputs are post-processed minimally to yield\nreal-valued $(\\eta, \\phi)$ jet coordinates at trigger tower granularity.\n  Trigger rates are evaluated using 2023 CMS ZeroBias data (0.64 fb$^{-1}$),\nwith efficiency assessed via a Monte Carlo sample of $H\\rightarrow b\\bar{b}$\noffline reconstructed AK8 jets. W-MM achieves a 1 kHz rate at an offline jet\n$p_T$ threshold of 146.8 GeV, 40.6 GeV lower than Single Jet 180, while\nmaintaining comparable signal efficiency. W-AM reduces the threshold further to\n140.4 GeV, with reduced efficiency due to fixed-output constraints and limited\nmulti-jet handling.\n  FPGA implementation targeting the Xilinx Virtex-7 XC7VX690T confirms that\nW-AM meets resource constraints with a pre-place-and-route latency of 22 clock\ncycles (137.5 ns). In contrast, JEDI requires excessive resource usage and a\n56-cycle latency, surpassing the 14-cycle L1T budget.\n  Originally developed for Run-3 CMS L1T, WOMBAT serves as a proof-of-concept\nfor Phase-2 triggers, where hardware advances will enable online deployment of\nmore sophisticated ML-based L1T systems.",

Their high abundance at redshifts of\n$z\\sim6-8$ and decline at lower redshifts suggest a transient origin. We\npropose that the spectral shape of LRDs originates from compact binary black\nhole systems, where each black hole is surrounded by a mini-disk and embedded\nin a larger circum-binary disk. With a binary separation of $\\lesssim 10^3$\nSchwarzschild radii, the Wien tail of a $T\\simeq 5000~{\\rm K}$ blackbody\nspectrum at the inner edge of the circum-binary disk produces the red optical\nemission, while the mini-disks power the UV continuum. Binary torques carve out\na gap between the circum-binary disk and mini-disks, setting the turnover\nwavelength of the v-shaped spectrum around the Balmer limit. This scenario\nnaturally reproduces LRD spectra requiring only modest dust attenuation\n($A_V\\lesssim 1$ mag), resolving overestimated luminosities for LRDs in\nprevious studies and alleviating a tension with the so-called Soltan argument.\nThis model predicts a distinct spectral evolution as the binary orbit decays\nthrough binary-disk interactions and gravitational waves (GWs), linking\nearly-stage \"proto-LRD\" binaries to the broader AGN population and late-stage\n\"LRD-descendants\" to coalescing binaries detectable in GW experiments.",

    "abstract": "Large reasoning models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable progress on complex\ntasks by generating extended chains of thought (CoT). However, their\nuncontrolled output lengths pose significant challenges for real-world\ndeployment, where inference-time budgets on tokens, latency, or compute are\nstrictly constrained. We propose Elastic Reasoning, a novel framework for\nscalable chain of thoughts that explicitly separates reasoning into two\nphases--thinking and solution--with independently allocated budgets. At test\ntime, Elastic Reasoning prioritizes the completeness of solution segments,\nsignificantly improving reliability under tight resource constraints. To train\nmodels that are robust to truncated thinking, we introduce a lightweight\nbudget-constrained rollout strategy, integrated into GRPO, which teaches the\nmodel to reason adaptively when the thinking process is cut short and\ngeneralizes effectively to unseen budget constraints without additional\ntraining. Empirical results on mathematical (AIME, MATH500) and programming\n(LiveCodeBench, Codeforces) benchmarks demonstrate that Elastic Reasoning\nperforms robustly under strict budget constraints, while incurring\nsignificantly lower training cost than baseline methods. Remarkably, our\napproach also produces more concise and efficient reasoning even in\nunconstrained settings.

Typical ITR estimation methods rely on\nconditional average treatment effects (CATEs) to guide treatment assignments.\nHowever, such methods overlook individual-level harm within covariate-specific\nsubpopulations, potentially leading many individuals to experience worse\noutcomes under CATE-based ITRs. In this article, we aim to estimate ITRs that\nmaximize the reward while ensuring that the harm rate induced by the ITR\nremains below a pre-specified threshold. We derive the explicit form of the\noptimal ITR, propose a plug-in estimator when both the CATE and harm rate are\nidentifiable, and establish the large-sample properties of the proposed\nestimator. Given that the harm rate is generally unidentifiable due to its\ndependence on the joint distribution of potential outcomes, we further propose\n{three} strategies for estimating ITRs with a controllable harm rate under\npartial identification. By accounting for both reward and harm, our method\noffers a reliable solution for developing ITRs in high-stakes domains where\nharm is crucial. Extensive simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed methods in controlling harm rates.

Considering a one-dimensional (1D) Rashba nanowire (RNW)\nproximitized to a regular $s$-wave superconductor and a $d$-wave AM, we\ngenerate both $0$- and $\\pi$-FMEMs by driving the nontopological phase of the\nstatic system. While the static counterpart hosts both topological Majorana\nzero modes (MZMs) and non-topological accidental zero modes (AZMs), the drive\ncan gap out the static AZMs and generate robust $\\pi$-FMEMs, termed as\ntopological AZMs (TAZMs). We topologically characterize the emergent FMEMs via\ndynamical winding numbers exploiting chiral symmetry of the system. Moreover,\nwe consider a periodically driven Josephson junction comprising of RNW/AM-based\n1D topological superconduting setup. We identify the signature of MZMs and\nFMEMs utilizing $4\\pi$-periodic Josephson effect, distinguishing them from\ntrivial AZMs exhibiting $2\\pi$-periodicty, in both static and driven platforms.\nThis Josephson current signal due to Majorana modes survives even in presence\nof finite disorder.

An excess of\nevents with a large imbalance of transverse momentum is searched for across 0,\n1 and 2 lepton final states. Novel multivariate techniques are used to take\nadvantage of the differences in kinematic properties between the two DM\nproduction mechanisms. No significant deviations with respect to the standard\nmodel predictions are observed. The results are interpreted considering a\nsimplified model in which the mediator is either a scalar or pseudoscalar\nparticle and couples to top quarks and to DM fermions. Axion-like particles\nthat are coupled to top quarks and DM fermions are also considered. Expected\nexclusion limits of 410 and 380 GeV for scalar and pseudoscalar mediator\nmasses, respectively, are set at the 95% confidence level. A DM particle mass\nof 1 GeV is assumed, with mediator couplings to fermions and DM particles set\nto unity. A small signal-like excess is observed in data, with the largest\nlocal significance observed to be 1.9 standard deviations for the 150 GeV\npseudoscalar mediator hypothesis. Because of this excess, mediator masses are\nonly excluded below 310 (320) GeV for the scalar (pseudoscalar) mediator.

In particular,\nwe choose four metrics from this large family: accuracy, precision, recall, and\nF$_1$, to demonstrate our method. CBPE treats the elements of the confusion\nmatrix as random variables and leverages calibrated confidence scores of the\nmodel to estimate their distributions. The desired metric is then also treated\nas a random variable, whose full probability distribution can be derived from\nthe estimated confusion matrix.

QUIC's multiplexing\ncapabilities, encrypted headers, dynamic IP address changes, and encrypted\nparameter negotiations make the protocol not only more efficient, secure, and\ncensorship-resistant, but also practically unmanageable by firewalls. This\nopens doors for attackers who may exploit certain traits of the QUIC protocol\nto perform targeted attacks, such as data exfiltration attacks. Whereas\nexisting data exfiltration techniques, such as TLS and DNS-based exfiltration,\ncan be detected on a firewall level, QUIC-based data exfiltration is more\ndifficult to detect, since changes in IP addresses and ports are inherent to\nthe protocol's normal behavior. To show the feasibility of a QUIC-based data\nexfiltration attack, we introduce a novel method leveraging the server\npreferred address feature of the QUIC protocol and, thus, allows an attacker to\nexfiltrate sensitive data from an infected machine to a malicious server,\ndisguised as a server-side connection migration. The attack is implemented as a\nproof of concept tool in Rust.

We inaugurate this task by proposing a new benchmark and evaluation\nprotocol. We also introduce a new dataset for training 3D LLMs on this task, as\nwell as the first method to serve as a non-trivial baseline. We believe that\nthis challenging task and our new benchmark could become part of the suite of\nbenchmarks used to evaluate and compare generalist 3D LLM models.",

    "abstract": "Humans naturally exhibit bilateral symmetry in their gross manipulation\nskills, effortlessly mirroring simple actions between left and right hands.\nBimanual robots-which also feature bilateral symmetry-should similarly exploit\nthis property to perform tasks with either hand. Unlike humans, who often favor\na dominant hand for fine dexterous skills, robots should ideally execute\nambidextrous manipulation with equal proficiency. To this end, we introduce\nSYMDEX (SYMmetric DEXterity), a reinforcement learning framework for\nambidextrous bi-manipulation that leverages the robot's inherent bilateral\nsymmetry as an inductive bias. SYMDEX decomposes complex bimanual manipulation\ntasks into per-hand subtasks and trains dedicated policies for each. By\nexploiting bilateral symmetry via equivariant neural networks, experience from\none arm is inherently leveraged by the opposite arm. We then distill the\nsubtask policies into a global ambidextrous policy that is independent of the\nhand-task assignment. We evaluate SYMDEX on six challenging simulated\nmanipulation tasks and demonstrate successful real-world deployment on two of\nthem. Our approach strongly outperforms baselines on complex task in which the\nleft and right hands perform different roles. We further demonstrate SYMDEX's\nscalability by extending it to a four-arm manipulation setup, where our\nsymmetry-aware policies enable effective multi-arm collaboration and\ncoordination. Our results highlight how structural symmetry as inductive bias\nin policy learning enhances sample efficiency, robustness, and generalization\nacross diverse dexterous manipulation tasks.",

Current LLM serving frameworks lack\neffective mechanisms for handling interdependent inference tasks, dynamic\nlatency variability, and resource heterogeneity, leading to suboptimal\nperformance and frequent service-level objective (SLO) violations. In this\npaper, we introduce HEXGEN-TEXT2SQL, a novel framework designed explicitly to\nschedule and execute agentic multi-stage LLM-based Text-to-SQL workflows on\nheterogeneous GPU clusters that handle multi-tenant end-to-end queries.\nHEXGEN-TEXT2SQL introduce a hierarchical scheduling approach combining global\nworkload-balanced task dispatching and local adaptive urgency-guided\nprioritization, guided by a systematic analysis of agentic Text-to-SQL\nworkflows.

Analysis for pairs of pions is most common, due to\ntheir large abundance in the collisions, as well as well-understood theoretical\nformalism and advanced experimental methodology. It is usually performed in\nthree dimensions in longitudinally co-moving reference frame of the pair, to\nmaximize the amount of information obtained about the source. Similar\nthree-dimensional analysis has also been performed for charged and neutral\nkaons. In contrast analyses for all other pair types -- either for pairs of\nidentical protons, or for pairs of non-identical particles are only\none-dimensional. The abundance of heavier particles is lower than for pions,\nwhile the theoretical formalism for such correlations, as well as practical\nexperimental methodology is limited to one-dimensional case up to now. This\nwork identifies specific challenges arising in the analysis of\nthree-dimensional proton-proton femtoscopy and proposes a theoretical formalism\nto analyze them, as well as specific experimental methods to extract and fit\ncorrelations. A test and validation of these methods is performed on\ncorrelations simulated in the LHyquid+Therminator2 model, and demonstrates the\nfeasibility of such analysis.

    "abstract": "Learning to reject provide a learning paradigm which allows for our models to\nabstain from making predictions. One way to learn the rejector is to learn an\nideal marginal distribution (w.r.t. the input domain) - which characterizes a\nhypothetical best marginal distribution - and compares it to the true marginal\ndistribution via a density ratio. In this paper, we consider learning a joint\nideal distribution over both inputs and labels; and develop a link between\nrejection and thresholding different statistical divergences. We further find\nthat when one considers a variant of the log-loss, the rejector obtained by\nconsidering the joint ideal distribution corresponds to the thresholding of the\nskewed Bhattacharyya divergence between class-probabilities. This is in\ncontrast to the marginal case - that is equivalent to a typical\ncharacterization of optimal rejection, Chow's Rule - which corresponds to a\nthresholding of the Kullback-Leibler divergence. In general, we find that\nrejecting via a Bhattacharyya divergence is less aggressive than Chow's Rule.",

Previous efforts have focused on designing\nvarious downstream relation learning modules to better capture interactions\nbetween tokens in the table, revealing that a stronger capability to capture\nrelations can lead to greater improvements in the model. Motivated by this, we\nattempt to directly utilize transformer layers as downstream relation learning\nmodules. Due to the powerful semantic modeling capability of transformers, it\nis foreseeable that this will lead to excellent improvement. However, owing to\nthe quadratic relation between the length of the table and the length of the\ninput sentence sequence, using transformers directly faces two challenges:\noverly long table sequences and unfair local attention interaction. To address\nthese challenges, we propose a novel Table-Transformer (T-T) for the\ntagging-based ASTE method. Specifically, we introduce a stripe attention\nmechanism with a loop-shift strategy to tackle these challenges. The former\nmodifies the global attention mechanism to only attend to a 2-dimensional local\nattention window, while the latter facilitates interaction between different\nattention windows.

    "abstract": "Lip segmentation plays a crucial role in various domains, such as lip\nsynchronization, lipreading, and diagnostics. However, the effectiveness of\nsupervised lip segmentation is constrained by the availability of lip contour\nin the training phase. A further challenge with lip segmentation is its\nreliance on image quality , lighting, and skin tone, leading to inaccuracies in\nthe detected boundaries. To address these challenges, we propose a sequential\nlip segmentation method that integrates attention UNet and multidimensional\ninput. We unravel the micro-patterns in facial images using local binary\npatterns to build multidimensional inputs. Subsequently, the multidimensional\ninputs are fed into sequential attention UNets, where the lip contour is\nreconstructed. We introduce a mask generation method that uses a few anatomical\nlandmarks and estimates the complete lip contour to improve segmentation\naccuracy. This mask has been utilized in the training phase for lip\nsegmentation. To evaluate the proposed method, we use facial images to segment\nthe upper lips and subsequently assess lip-related facial anomalies in subjects\nwith fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Using the proposed lip segmentation method,\nwe achieved a mean dice score of 84.75%, and a mean pixel accuracy of 99.77% in\nupper lip segmentation. To further evaluate the method, we implemented\nclassifiers to identify those with FAS. Using a generative adversarial network\n(GAN), we reached an accuracy of 98.55% in identifying FAS in one of the study\npopulations. This method could be used to improve lip segmentation accuracy,\nespecially around Cupid's bow, and shed light on distinct lip-related\ncharacteristics of FAS.",

This\nexoplanet can be confirmed if these variations are long-lived and coherent.\nContinued monitoring may also reveal other companions. We have acquired\nadditional RV measurements of 42 Dra spanning fifteen years. Periodogram\nanalyses were used to investigate the stability of the planet RV signal. We\nalso investigated variations in the spectral line shapes using the bisector\nvelocity span as well as infrared photometry from the COBE mission. The new RV\nmeasurements do not follow the published planet orbit. An orbital solution\nusing the 2004 - 2011 data yields a period and eccentricity consistent with the\npublished values, but the RV amplitude has decreased by a factor of four from\nthe earlier measurements. Including some additional RV measurements taken\nbetween 2014 and 2018 reveal the presence of a second period at 530 d. The\nbeating of this period with the one at 479-d may account for the observed\namplitude variations. The planet hypothesis is conclusively ruled out by\nCOBE/DIRBE 1.25 micron photometry that shows variations with the planet orbital\nperiod as well as an additional 170 d period. The amplitude variations in the\nRV as well the COBE/DIRBE photometry firmly establish that there is no giant\nplanet around 42 Dra. The presence of multi-periodic variations suggests that\nthese may be stellar oscillations, most likely oscillatory convection modes.\nThese oscillations may account for some of the long period RV variations\nattributed to planets around K giant stars. This may skew the statistics of\nplanet occurrence around intermediate mass stars. Long-term monitoring with\nexcellent sampling is required to exclude amplitude variations in the\nlong-periods found in radial velocity of K giant stars.",

Despite these developments, few studies have\ninvestigated MP control in heterogeneously distributed and partially CV\nenvironments while ensuring network queue stability. To address these research\ngaps, we propose a CV-based MP control (CV-MP) method that leverages real-time\nCV travel time information to compute the pressure, thereby incorporating both\nthe spatial distribution and temporal delays of vehicles, unlike existing\napproaches that utilized only spatial distribution or temporal delays. In\nparticular, we establish sufficient conditions for road network queue stability\nthat are compatible with most existing MP control methods. Moreover, we\npioneered the proof of network queue stability even if the vehicles are only\npartially connected and heterogeneously distributed, and gave a necessary\ncondition of CV observation for maintaining the stability. Evaluation results\non an Amsterdam corridor show that CV-MP significantly reduces vehicle delays\ncompared to both actuated control and conventional MP control across various CV\npenetration rates.

This approach can introduce significant errors in two-way coupled\nsimulations, especially when the particle diameter is not much smaller than the\ncomputational grid spacing. In this study, we propose a novel force correlation\nframework that circumvents the need for undisturbed velocity estimation by\nleveraging volume-filtered quantities available directly from EL simulations.\nThrough a rigorous analytical derivation in the Stokes regime and extensive\nparticle-resolved direct numerical simulations (PR-DNS) at finite Reynolds\nnumbers, we formulate force correlations that depend solely on the\nvolume-filtered fluid velocity and local volume fraction, parametrized by the\nfilter width. These correlations are shown to recover known drag laws in the\nappropriate asymptotic limits and exhibit a good agreement with analytical and\nhigh-fidelity numerical benchmarks for single particle cases, and, compared to\nexisting correlations, an improved agreement for the drag force on particles in\nparticle assemblies. The proposed framework significantly enhances the accuracy\nof hydrodynamic force predictions for both isolated particles and dense\nsuspensions, without incurring the prohibitive computational costs associated\nwith reconstructing undisturbed flow fields. This advancement lays the\nfoundation for robust, scalable, and high-fidelity EL simulations of complex\nparticulate flows across a wide range of industrial and environmental\napplications.",

    "abstract": "In a vast class of systems, which includes members as diverse as active\ncolloids and bird flocks, interactions do not stem from a potential, and are in\ngeneral nonreciprocal. Thus, it is not possible to define a conventional energy\nfunction, nor to use analytical or numerical tools that rely on it. Here, we\novercome these limitations by constructing a Hamiltonian that includes\nauxiliary degrees of freedom; when subject to a constraint, this Hamiltonian\nyields the original non-reciprocal dynamics. We show that Glauber dynamics\nbased on the constrained Hamiltonian reproduces the steady states of the\noriginal Langevin dynamics, as we explicitly illustrate for dissipative XY\nspins with vision-cone interactions. Further, the symplectic structure inherent\nto our construction allows us to apply the well-developed notions of\nHamiltonian engineering, which we demonstrate by varying the amplitude of a\nperiodic drive to tune the spin interactions between those of a square and a\nchain lattice geometry. Overall, our framework for generic nonreciprocal\npairwise interactions paves the way for bringing to bear the full conceptual\nand methodological power of conventional statistical mechanics and Hamiltonian\ndynamics to nonreciprocal systems.",

    "abstract": "A common technique used in factories to shape metal panels is shot peen\nforming. The impacts between the hard steel shot and the softer metal of the\npanel cause localized plastic deformation used to improve the fatigue\nproperties of the material's surface. The residual stress distribution imparted\nby impacts also results in bending, which suggests that a torque is associated\nwith it. In this paper, we model shot peen forming as the application of\nspatially varying torques to a Kirchhoff plate, opting to use the language of\nthermoelasticity in order to introduce these torque distributions. First, we\nderive the governing equations for the thermoelastic thin plate model and show\nthat only a torque-type resultant of the temperature distribution shows up in\nthe bending equation. Next, to calibrate from the shot peen operation an\nempirical effective torque parameter used in the thermoelastic model, a simple\nand non-invasive test is devised. This test relies only on measuring the\nmaximum displacement of a uniformly shot peened plate as opposed to\ncharacterizing the residual stress distribution. After discussing how to handle\nthe unconventional fully-free boundary conditions germane for peened plates, we\nintroduce an approach to solving the inverse problem whereby the peening\ndistribution required to obtain a specified plate contour can be obtained.\nGiven the non-unique relationship between peening distributions and the\ndisplacement at discrete points, we explore a regularization of the inverse\nproblem which gives rise to shot peen distributions that match the capabilities\nof equipment in the factory. In order to validate our proposed model, an\nexperiment with quantified uncertainty is designed and carried out which\ninvestigates the agreement between the predictions of the calibrated model and\nreal shot peen forming operations.",

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) has revolutionized collaborative model training in\ndistributed networks, prioritizing data privacy and communication efficiency.\nThis paper investigates efficient deployment of FL in wireless heterogeneous\nnetworks, focusing on strategies to accelerate convergence despite stragglers.\nThe primary objective is to minimize long-term convergence wall-clock time\nthrough optimized user scheduling and resource allocation. While stragglers may\nintroduce delays in a single round, their inclusion can expedite subsequent\nrounds, particularly when they possess critical information. Moreover,\nbalancing single-round duration with the number of cumulative rounds,\ncompounded by dynamic training and transmission conditions, necessitates a\nnovel approach beyond conventional optimization solutions. To tackle these\nchallenges, convergence analysis with respect to adaptive and biased scheduling\nis derived. Then, by factoring in real-time system and statistical information,\nincluding diverse energy constraints and users' energy harvesting capabilities,\na deep reinforcement learning approach, empowered by proximal policy\noptimization, is employed to adaptively select user sets. For the scheduled\nusers, Lagrangian decomposition is applied to optimize local resource\nutilization, further enhancing system efficiency. Simulation results validate\nthe effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework for various FL\ntasks, demonstrating reduced task time compared to existing benchmarks under\nvarious settings.",

While the interplay of the $d$-wave superconductor and QSHI has\nbeen studied as a platform to realize Majorana corner modes (MCMs), we show\nthat the addition of the spin texture enables the tunability of these MCMs.\nEach corner of this hybrid system can host one or two Majorana modes depending\non the system parameters, in particular, exchange strength and pitch vector of\nthe spin texture.

    "abstract": "The geomagnetic field has undergone hundreds of polarity reversals over\nEarth's history, at a variable pace. In numerical models of Earth's core\ndynamics, reversals occur with increasing frequency when the convective forcing\nis increased past a critical level. This transition has previously been related\nto the influence of inertia in the force balance. Because this force is\nsubdominant in Earth's core, concerns have been raised regarding the\ngeophysical applicability of this paradigm. Reproducing the reversal rate of\nthe past million years also requires forcing conditions that do not guarantee\nthat the rest of the geomagnetic variation spectrum is reproduced. These issues\nmotivate the search for alternative reversal mechanisms. Using a suite of\nnumerical models where buoyancy is provided at the bottom of the core by\ninner-core freezing, we show that the magnetic dipole amplitude is controlled\nby the relative strength of subsurface upwellings and horizontal circulation at\nthe core surface. A relative weakening of upwellings brings the system from a\nstable to a reversing dipole state. This mechanism is purely kinematic because\nit operates irrespectively of the interior force balance. It is therefore\nexpected to apply at the physical conditions of Earth's core. Subsurface\nupwellings may be impeded by stable stratification in the outermost core. We\nshow that with weak stratification levels corresponding to a nearly adiabatic\ncore surface heat flow, a single model reproduces the observed geomagnetic\nvariations ranging from decades to millions of years. \\rev{In contrast with}\nthe existing paradigm, reversals caused by this stable top core mechanism\nbecome more frequent when the level of stratification increases i.e. when the\ncore heat flow decreases. This suggests that the link between mantle dynamics\nand magnetic reversal frequency needs to be reexamined.",

We consider two skip connection\nconfigurations, which either include or omit the current process state in the\ndenoiser's output, enabling the network to predict either environmental noise\nor clean speech. Each approach leads to improved performance on different\nspeech enhancement metrics. To maintain stable magnitude levels and balance\nduring training, we use a magnitude-preserving network architecture that\nnormalizes all activations and network weights to unit length.

Though any\nmetastable mode is expected to decay after a finite time, stochastic switching\npersists indefinitely. Here, we elaborate on the connection between switching\ndynamics and quantum metastability through the lens of the large deviation\nprinciples, spectral decomposition, and quantum-jump simulations. Specifically,\nwe distinguish the trajectory-level noise-induced metastability (stochastic\nswitching) from the spectrum-level deterministic metastability (small\nLiouvillian gap) in a Markovian open quantum system with bistability. Without\nstochastic switching, whether a small spectral gap leads to slow relaxation\ndepends on initial states. In contrast, with switching, the memory of initial\nconditions is quickly lost, and the relaxation is limited by the rare switching\nbetween the metastable states. Consistent with the exponential scaling of the\nLiouvillian gap with system size, the switching rates conform to the Arrhenius\nlaw, with the inverse system size serving as the nonequilibrium analog of\ntemperature. Using the dynamical path integral and the instanton approach, we\nfurther extend the connection between the quasipotential functional and the\nprobabilities of rare fluctuations to the quantum realm.

We thus associate to any quantum Hamiltonian a random\nprocess on the plane. We set down rigorously the conditions under which such\nrandom process becomes a Wiener process in the thermodynamic limit and the\nassociated distribution of the distance from the origin becomes Gaussian. This\nleads to the well known Gaussian behavior of the spectral form factor for\nquantum chaotic (non-integrable) models, which we show to be violated at low\ntemperature. For systems with quasi-free spectrum (integrable), instead, the\ndistribution of the SFF is Log-Normal. We compute all the moments of the\nspectral form factor exactly without resorting to the Gaussian approximation.\nAssuming degeneracies in the quantum chaotic spectrum we solve the classical\nproblem of random walker taking steps of unequal lengths. Furthermore, we\ndemonstrate that the Hausdorff dimension of the frontier of the random walk,\ndefined as the boundary of the unbounded component of the complement,\napproaches 1 for the integrable Brownian motion, while the non-integrable walk\napproaches that obtained by the Schramm-Loewner Evolution (SLE) with the\nfractal dimension $4/3$.

Recently, van der Waals magnets have demonstrated\nsubtle interlayer exchange interactions, offering a promising approach to\nelectrically control spin states without structural transformation.

The introduction of 16%\nCo-doping in Fe3GaTe2 modulates the interlayer magnetic interaction, enabling\nmultiple spin orderings within the same lattice system with three critical\ntemperatures: a Curie temperature for a ferromagnetic state (Tc=210 K) and two\nNeel temperatures for the collinear (TN1=110 K) and non-collinear (TN2=30 K)\nantiferromagnetic states.

Treating that premise as both optional and doubtful, we propose\nwhat we call the appropriateness framework: an alternative approach grounded in\nconflict theory, cultural evolution, multi-agent systems, and institutional\neconomics. The appropriateness framework treats persistent disagreement as the\nnormal case and designs for it by applying four principles: (1) contextual\ngrounding, (2) community customization, (3) continual adaptation, and (4)\npolycentric governance. We argue here that adopting these design principles is\na good way to shift the main alignment metaphor from moral unification to a\nmore productive metaphor of conflict management, and that taking this step is\nboth desirable and urgent.",

However, in real-world applications, these assumptions are\ntypically violated which limits their practical effectiveness.

    "abstract": "The safety of autonomous cars has come under scrutiny in recent years,\nespecially after 16 documented incidents involving Teslas (with autopilot\nengaged) crashing into parked emergency vehicles (police cars, ambulances, and\nfiretrucks). While previous studies have revealed that strong light sources\noften introduce flare artifacts in the captured image, which degrade the image\nquality, the impact of flare on object detection performance remains unclear.\nIn this research, we unveil PaniCar, a digital phenomenon that causes an object\ndetector's confidence score to fluctuate below detection thresholds when\nexposed to activated emergency vehicle lighting. This vulnerability poses a\nsignificant safety risk, and can cause autonomous vehicles to fail to detect\nobjects near emergency vehicles. In addition, this vulnerability could be\nexploited by adversaries to compromise the security of advanced driving\nassistance systems (ADASs). We assess seven commercial ADASs (Tesla Model 3,\n\"manufacturer C\", HP, Pelsee, AZDOME, Imagebon, Rexing), four object detectors\n(YOLO, SSD, RetinaNet, Faster R-CNN), and 14 patterns of emergency vehicle\nlighting to understand the influence of various technical and environmental\nfactors. We also evaluate four SOTA flare removal methods and show that their\nperformance and latency are insufficient for real-time driving constraints. To\nmitigate this risk, we propose Caracetamol, a robust framework designed to\nenhance the resilience of object detectors against the effects of activated\nemergency vehicle lighting. Our evaluation shows that on YOLOv3 and Faster\nRCNN, Caracetamol improves the models' average confidence of car detection by\n0.20, the lower confidence bound by 0.33, and reduces the fluctuation range by\n0.33. In addition, Caracetamol is capable of processing frames at a rate of\nbetween 30-50 FPS, enabling real-time ADAS car detection.",

SVP treats layer activations as latent variables and optimizes local\nEvidence Lower Bounds (ELBOs), enabling independent, local updates while\npreserving global coherence. However, directly applying KL divergence in\nlayer-wise ELBOs risks inter-layer's representation collapse due to excessive\ncompression. To prevent this, SVP projects activations into low-dimensional\nspaces via fixed random matrices, ensuring information preservation and\nrepresentational diversity. Combined with a feature alignment loss for\ninter-layer consistency, SVP achieves competitive accuracy with BP across\ndiverse architectures (MLPs, CNNs, Transformers) and datasets (MNIST to\nImageNet), reduces memory usage by up to 4x, and significantly improves\nscalability.

In this direction, one typical paradigm evaluates\nmodel performance separately on known classes (i.e., base domain) and unseen\nclasses (i.e., new domain). However, real-world scenarios require models to\nhandle inputs without prior domain knowledge. This practical challenge has\nspurred the development of open-world prompt tuning, which demands a unified\nevaluation of two stages: 1) detecting whether an input belongs to the base or\nnew domain (P1), and 2) classifying the sample into its correct class (P2).\nWhat's more, as domain distributions are generally unknown, a proper metric\nshould be insensitive to varying base/new sample ratios (P3). However, we find\nthat current metrics, including HM, overall accuracy, and AUROC, fail to\nsatisfy these three properties simultaneously. To bridge this gap, we propose\nOpenworldAUC, a unified metric that jointly assesses detection and\nclassification through pairwise instance comparisons. To optimize OpenworldAUC\neffectively, we introduce Gated Mixture-of-Prompts (GMoP), which employs\ndomain-specific prompts and a gating mechanism to dynamically balance detection\nand classification. Theoretical guarantees ensure generalization of GMoP under\npractical conditions.

This entropy obeys the composition rule which coincides\nwith the composition rule in the non-extensive Tsallis-Cirto $\\delta=2$\nstatistics. Here we extend this approach to the thermodynamics of white holes.\nThe entropy of the white hole is negative as follows from the rate of\nmacroscopic quantum tunneling from black hole to white hole. The white hole\nentropy is with the minus sign the entropy of the black hole with the same\nmass, $S_{\\rm WH}(M)=-S_{\\rm BH}(M)$. This reflects the anti-symmetry with\nrespect to time reversal, at which the shift vector in the\nArnowitt-Deser-Misner formalism changes sign. This symmetry allows one to\nextend the Tsallis-Chirto entropy by adding a minus sign to the Tsallis-Chirto\nformula applied to white hole. As a result, the composition rule remains the\nsame, with the only difference being that instead of entropy it contains the\nentropy modulus. The same non-extensive composition rule is obtained for the\nentropy of the Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om black hole. This entropy is formed by the\npositive entropy of the outer horizon and the negative entropy of the inner\nhorizon. The model of the black hole formed by \"black hole atoms\" with\nPlanck-scale mass is also extended to include the negative entropy of white\nholes.",

The goal of this problem is to\nmaximize the minimum utility among agents with additive valuations by\nrepeatedly assigning indivisible goods to them. One key feature of this problem\nis that each agent's valuation for each item can only be observed through the\nsemi-bandit feedback, while existing work supposes that the item values are\nprovided at the beginning of each round. Another key feature is that the\nalgorithm's reward function is not additive with respect to rounds, unlike most\nbandit-setting problems.\n  Our first contribution is to propose an algorithm that has an asymptotic\nregret bound of $O(m\\sqrt{T}\\ln T/n + m\\sqrt{T \\ln(mnT)})$, where $n$ is the\nnumber of agents, $m$ is the number of items, and $T$ is the time horizon. This\nis based on a novel combination of bandit techniques and a resource allocation\nalgorithm studied in the literature on competitive analysis. Our second\ncontribution is to provide the regret lower bound of $\\Omega(m\\sqrt{T}/n)$.\nWhen $T$ is sufficiently larger than $n$, the gap between the upper and lower\nbounds is a logarithmic factor of $T$.",

On the other hand, modern programming\nlanguages, such as Go, Rust and Kotlin, advocate a paradigm shift towards\nchannel-based (i.e., message-passing) communication. However, the consistency\nquestion for channel-based concurrency is currently poorly understood.\n  In this paper we lift the study of fundamental consistency problems to\nchannels, taking into account various input parameters, such as the number of\nthreads executing, the number of channels, and the channel capacities. We draw\na rich complexity landscape, including upper bounds that become polynomial when\ncertain input parameters are fixed, as well as hardness lower bounds. Our upper\nbounds are based on novel algorithms that can drive the verification of channel\nconsistency in automated verification tools.

With the advances\nin Liquid Crystals (LCs) in microwave engineering, we have observed a new trend\nin using LC for realizing phase shifter networks of RISs.

    "abstract": "Current speech generation research can be categorized into two primary\nclasses: non-autoregressive and autoregressive. The fundamental distinction\nbetween these approaches lies in the duration prediction strategy employed for\npredictable-length sequences. The NAR methods ensure stability in speech\ngeneration by explicitly and independently modeling the duration of each\nphonetic unit. Conversely, AR methods employ an autoregressive paradigm to\npredict the compressed speech token by implicitly modeling duration with Markov\nproperties. Although this approach improves prosody, it does not provide the\nstructural guarantees necessary for stability. To simultaneously address the\nissues of stability and naturalness in speech generation, we propose\nFlexSpeech, a stable, controllable, and expressive TTS model. The motivation\nbehind FlexSpeech is to incorporate Markov dependencies and preference\noptimization directly on the duration predictor to boost its naturalness while\nmaintaining explicit modeling of the phonetic units to ensure stability.\nSpecifically, we decompose the speech generation task into two components: an\nAR duration predictor and a NAR acoustic model. The acoustic model is trained\non a substantial amount of data to learn to render audio more stably, given\nreference audio prosody and phone durations. The duration predictor is\noptimized in a lightweight manner for different stylistic variations, thereby\nenabling rapid style transfer while maintaining a decoupled relationship with\nthe specified speaker timbre. Experimental results demonstrate that our\napproach achieves SOTA stability and naturalness in zero-shot TTS. More\nimportantly, when transferring to a specific stylistic domain, we can\naccomplish lightweight optimization of the duration module solely with about\n100 data samples, without the need to adjust the acoustic model, thereby\nenabling rapid and stable style transfer.",

    "abstract": "Existing machine learning models approach the task of melody estimation from\npolyphonic audio as a classification problem by discretizing the pitch values,\nwhich results in the loss of finer frequency variations present in the melody.\nTo better capture these variations, we propose to approach this task as a\nregression problem. Apart from predicting only the pitch for a particular\nregion in the audio, we also predict its uncertainty to enhance the\ntrustworthiness of the model. To perform regression-based melody estimation, we\npropose three different methods that use histogram representation to model the\npitch values. Such a representation requires the support range of the histogram\nto be continuous. The first two methods address the abrupt discontinuity\nbetween unvoiced and voiced frequency ranges by mapping them to a continuous\nrange. The third method reformulates melody estimation as a fully Bayesian\ntask, modeling voicing detection as a classification problem, and voiced pitch\nestimation as a regression problem. Additionally, we introduce a novel method\nto estimate the uncertainty from the histogram representation that correlates\nwell with the deviation of the mean of the predicted distribution from the\nground truth. Experimental results demonstrate that reformulating melody\nestimation as a regression problem significantly improves the performance over\nclassification-based approaches. Comparing the proposed methods with a\nstate-of-the-art regression model, it is observed that the Bayesian method\nperforms the best at estimating both the melody and its associated uncertainty.",

While Trajectory Data Preparation (TDP)\ncan enhance data quality, existing methods suffer from two key limitations: (i)\nthey do not address data privacy concerns, particularly in federated settings\nwhere trajectory data sharing is prohibited, and (ii) they typically design\ntask-specific models that lack generalizability across diverse TDP scenarios.\nTo overcome these challenges, we propose FedTDP, a privacy-preserving and\nunified framework that leverages the capabilities of Large Language Models\n(LLMs) for TDP in federated environments. Specifically, we: (i) design a\ntrajectory privacy autoencoder to secure data transmission and protect privacy,\n(ii) introduce a trajectory knowledge enhancer to improve model learning of\nTDP-related knowledge, enabling the development of TDP-oriented LLMs, and (iii)\npropose federated parallel optimization to enhance training efficiency by\nreducing data transmission and enabling parallel model training.

In this study, we rigorously prove\nthat this approach leads to a worst-case linear scaling of Kullback-Leibler\n(KL) divergence with data dimension. To address this, we propose a Quantum\nDiscrete Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (QD3PM), which enables joint\nprobability learning through diffusion and denoising in exponentially large\nHilbert spaces, offering a theoretical pathway to faithfully capture the true\njoint distribution. By deriving posterior states through quantum Bayes'\ntheorem, similar to the crucial role of posterior probabilities in classical\ndiffusion models, and by learning the joint probability, we establish a solid\ntheoretical foundation for quantum-enhanced diffusion models. For denoising, we\ndesign a quantum circuit that utilizes temporal information for parameter\nsharing and incorporates learnable classical-data-controlled rotations for\nencoding. Exploiting joint distribution learning, our approach enables\nsingle-step sampling from pure noise, eliminating iterative requirements of\nexisting models.

    "abstract": "The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) suggests there exists a sparse LTH mask\nand weights that achieve the same generalization performance as the dense model\nwhile using significantly fewer parameters. However, finding a LTH solution is\ncomputationally expensive, and a LTH sparsity mask does not generalize to other\nrandom weight initializations. Recent work has suggested that neural networks\ntrained from random initialization find solutions within the same basin modulo\npermutation, and proposes a method to align trained models within the same loss\nbasin. We hypothesize that misalignment of basins is the reason why LTH masks\ndo not generalize to new random initializations and propose permuting the LTH\nmask to align with the new optimization basin when performing sparse training\nfrom a different random init. We empirically show a significant increase in\ngeneralization when sparse training from random initialization with the\npermuted mask as compared to using the non-permuted LTH mask, on multiple\ndatasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet) and models (VGG11, ResNet20 and\nResNet50).",

This suggests activation-based guidance\nproves more effective in low-dimensional pruning environments, where\nconstrained sample spaces can lead to deviations from true uniformity in\nrandomization. Conversely, population-driven strategies enhance robustness by\nexpanding the total pruning dimensionality, achieving statistically uniform\nrandomness that better preserves system dynamics.

Its severity is typically\nevaluated by estimating the percentage of obstructed airway. This estimation\ncan be obtained from CT data or through visual inspection by experts exploring\nthe region. However, visual inspections are inherently subjective, leading to\nless consistent and robust diagnoses. No public methods or datasets are\ncurrently available for automated evaluation of this condition from\nbronchoscopy video.\n  Methods: We propose a pipeline for automated subglottic stenosis severity\nestimation during the bronchoscopy exploration, without requiring the physician\nto traverse the stenosed region. Our approach exploits the physical effect of\nillumination decline in endoscopy to segment and track the lumen and obtain a\n3D model of the airway. This 3D model is obtained from a single frame and is\nused to measure the airway narrowing.\n  Results: Our pipeline is the first to enable automated and robust subglottic\nstenosis severity measurement using bronchoscopy images. The results show\nconsistency with ground-truth estimations from CT scans and expert estimations,\nand reliable repeatability across multiple estimations on the same patient. Our\nevaluation is performed on our new Subglottic Stenosis Dataset of real\nbronchoscopy procedures data.\n  Conclusion: We demonstrate how to automate evaluation of subglottic stenosis\nseverity using only bronchoscopy. Our approach can assist with and shorten\ndiagnosis and monitoring procedures, with automated and repeatable estimations\nand less exploration time, and save radiation exposure to patients as no CT is\nrequired.

Federated Learning (FL) offers a\ndecentralized solution by enabling model training across local clients without\ncentralizing sensitive data, but the high communication and computation costs\nof transmitting full pre-trained models during training limit its scalability.\nAdditionally, non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) data across\nlocal clients can negatively impact model convergence and performance.

In our continuum approach, the\ngranular pile and the overlying fluid layer evolve as a system of coupled thin\nfilms. We model the granular phase as a dense, porous, visco-plastic material\nthat experiences Coulomb-like friction with the walls. Conservation of mass and\nmomentum under a thin-film approximation leads to an elliptic equation for the\nvelocity of the grains that is coupled with an evolution equation for the\nheight of the granular pile. We solve our model numerically for a variety of\ndifferent scenarios to explore the interactions between wall friction, internal\nviscous-like stresses, and fluid flow above and through the pile. We complement\nour numerical results with a series of experiments that provide insight into\nthe validity and limitations of the model.",

The strong coupling regime, where coherent energy exchange\nexceeds losses, has also been widely explored. However, the transition-coupling\nregime, which lies between the above two and exhibits rich, unique physics,\nremains underexplored. In this study, we fabricate a tunable coupling device to\ninvestigate the coupling of a superconducting transmon qubit to a seven-mode\nsurface acoustic wave resonator (SAWR), with a particular focus on the\ntransition-coupling regime. Through a series of phonon oscillation experiments\nand studies in the dispersive regime, we systematically characterize the\nperformance of the SAWR. We then explore the complex dynamics of energy\nexchange between the qubit and the mechanical modes, highlighting the interplay\nbetween dissipation and coherence. Finally, we propose a protocol for qubit\nreadout and fast reset with a multimode mechanical cavity using one mode for\nreadout and another mode for reset. We have demonstrated in simulation that the\nqubit achieves both fast reset and high coherence performance when the qubit is\ncoupled to the reset mode in the transition-coupling regime.",

To address\nthis, existing approaches incorporate conservatism by indiscriminately\ndiscouraging all OOD actions, thereby hindering the agent's ability to\ngeneralize and exploit beneficial ones. In this paper, we propose\nAdvantage-based Diffusion Actor-Critic (ADAC), a novel method that\nsystematically evaluates OOD actions using the batch-optimal value function.\nBased on this evaluation, ADAC defines an advantage function to modulate the\nQ-function update, enabling more precise assessment of OOD action quality.

    "abstract": "Human emotional expression emerges through coordinated vocal, facial, and\ngestural signals. While speech face alignment is well established, the broader\ndynamics linking emotionally expressive speech to regional facial and hand\nmotion remains critical for gaining a deeper insight into how emotional and\nbehavior cues are communicated in real interactions. Further modulating the\ncoordination is the structure of conversational exchange like sequential turn\ntaking, which creates stable temporal windows for multimodal synchrony, and\nsimultaneous speech, often indicative of high arousal moments, disrupts this\nalignment and impacts emotional clarity. Understanding these dynamics enhances\nrealtime emotion detection by improving the accuracy of timing and synchrony\nacross modalities in both human interactions and AI systems. This study\nexamines multimodal emotion coupling using region specific motion capture from\ndyadic interactions in the IEMOCAP corpus. Speech features included low level\nprosody, MFCCs, and model derived arousal, valence, and categorical emotions\n(Happy, Sad, Angry, Neutral), aligned with 3D facial and hand marker\ndisplacements. Expressive activeness was quantified through framewise\ndisplacement magnitudes, and speech to gesture prediction mapped speech\nfeatures to facial and hand movements. Nonoverlapping speech consistently\nelicited greater activeness particularly in the lower face and mouth. Sadness\nshowed increased expressivity during nonoverlap, while anger suppressed\ngestures during overlaps. Predictive mapping revealed highest accuracy for\nprosody and MFCCs in articulatory regions while arousal and valence had lower\nand more context sensitive correlations. Notably, hand speech synchrony was\nenhanced under low arousal and overlapping speech, but not for valence.",

    "abstract": "Building on the recent empirical work of Kwa et al.

This implies an exponentially declining success rate with the length\nof the task and that each agent could be characterised by its own half-life.\nThis empirical regularity allows us to estimate the success rate for an agent\nat different task lengths. And the fact that this model is a good fit for the\ndata is suggestive of the underlying causes of failure on longer tasks -- that\nthey involve increasingly large sets of subtasks where failing any one fails\nthe task. Whether this model applies more generally on other suites of tasks is\nunknown and an important subject for further work.",

However, previous studies have primarily focused on single\nlow-dose PET denoising, neglecting two critical factors: discrepancies in dose\nresponse caused by inter-patient variability, and complementary anatomical\nconstraints derived from CT images. In this work, we propose a novel CT-Guided\nMulti-dose Adaptive Attention Denoising Diffusion Model (MDAA-Diff) for\nmulti-dose PET denoising. Our approach integrates anatomical guidance and\ndose-level adaptation to achieve superior denoising performance under low-dose\nconditions. Specifically, this approach incorporates a CT-Guided High-frequency\nWavelet Attention (HWA) module, which uses wavelet transforms to separate\nhigh-frequency anatomical boundary features from CT images. These extracted\nfeatures are then incorporated into PET imaging through an adaptive weighted\nfusion mechanism to enhance edge details. Additionally, we propose the\nDose-Adaptive Attention (DAA) module, a dose-conditioned enhancement mechanism\nthat dynamically integrates dose levels into channel-spatial attention weight\ncalculation. Extensive experiments on 18F-FDG and 68Ga-FAPI datasets\ndemonstrate that MDAA-Diff outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in\npreserving diagnostic quality under reduced-dose conditions.

In this paper, we\nintroduce the concept of $p$-complete square-free word-representable graph\n$G(V,E)$. A word $w$ defined over alphabet $V$ is called $p$-complete\nsquare-free word if there does not exist any subset $S\\subseteq \\Sigma$ such\nthat the word $w_{S}$ contains a square $XX$ where $|X| \\ge p$ and $1\\le p \\le\n|w|/2$. A word-representable graph is considered $p$-complete square-free\nword-representable if there exists a $p$-complete square-free word-representant\nof that graph. This pattern is significant as it proves the existence of\npatterns that do not depend on graph labelling and cannot be avoided by certain\nclasses of word-representable graphs. The class of word-representable graphs\nincludes both $p$-complete square-free word-representable graphs and\nnon-$p$-complete square-free word-representable graphs. Additionally, this\nconcept generalises the square pattern found in the words. A word-representable\ngraph is $p$-complete square-free uniform word-representable if its\n$p$-complete square-free word-representant is a uniform word. We analyse the\nproperties of $p$-complete square-free uniform words and find that the graphs\nrepresented by these words avoid having $K_p$ (the complete graph on $p$\nvertices) as an induced subgraph. We provide classifications for small values\nof $p$: for $p=1$, only complete graphs and for $p=2$, only complete and\nedgeless graphs satisfy the condition. We find that $K_3$-free circle graphs\nare 3-complete square-free uniform word-representable. Furthermore, we\nestablish that only graphs with representation number at most 3 can be\n3-complete square-free uniform word-representable and provide a constructive\nmethod to generate such graphs.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide\nrange of applications. However, individual LLMs often produce inconsistent,\nbiased, or hallucinated outputs due to limitations in their training corpora\nand model architectures. Recently, collaborative frameworks such as the\nMulti-LLM Network (MultiLLMN) have been introduced, enabling multiple LLMs to\ninteract and jointly respond to user queries. Nevertheless, MultiLLMN\narchitectures raise critical concerns regarding the reliability and security of\nthe generated content, particularly in open environments where malicious or\ncompromised LLMs may be present. Moreover, reliance on centralized coordination\nundermines system efficiency and introduces single points of failure. In this\npaper, we propose a novel Trusted MultiLLMN framework, driven by a Weighted\nByzantine Fault Tolerance (WBFT) blockchain consensus mechanism, to ensure the\nreliability, security, and efficiency of multi-LLM collaboration. In WBFT,\nvoting weights are adaptively assigned to each LLM based on its response\nquality and trustworthiness, incentivizing reliable behavior, and reducing the\nimpact of malicious nodes. Extensive simulations demonstrate that WBFT\nsignificantly improves both consensus security and efficiency compared to\nclassical and modern consensus mechanisms, particularly under wireless network\nconditions. Furthermore, our evaluations reveal that Trusted MultiLLMN\nsupported by WBFT can deliver higher-quality and more credible responses than\nboth single LLMs and conventional MultiLLMNs, thereby providing a promising\npath toward building robust, decentralized AI collaboration networks.",

    "abstract": "Multi-object editing aims to modify multiple objects or regions in complex\nscenes while preserving structural coherence. This task faces significant\nchallenges in scenarios involving overlapping or interacting objects: (1)\nInaccurate localization of target objects due to attention misalignment,\nleading to incomplete or misplaced edits; (2) Attribute-object mismatch, where\ncolor or texture changes fail to align with intended regions due to\ncross-attention leakage, creating semantic conflicts (\\textit{e.g.}, color\nbleeding into non-target areas). Existing methods struggle with these\nchallenges: approaches relying on global cross-attention mechanisms suffer from\nattention dilution and spatial interference between objects, while mask-based\nmethods fail to bind attributes to geometrically accurate regions due to\nfeature entanglement in multi-object scenarios. To address these limitations,\nwe propose a training-free, inference-stage optimization approach that enables\nprecise localized image manipulation in complex multi-object scenes, named\nMDE-Edit. MDE-Edit optimizes the noise latent feature in diffusion models via\ntwo key losses: Object Alignment Loss (OAL) aligns multi-layer cross-attention\nwith segmentation masks for precise object positioning, and Color Consistency\nLoss (CCL) amplifies target attribute attention within masks while suppressing\nleakage to adjacent regions. This dual-loss design ensures localized and\ncoherent multi-object edits.

In this regard, remarkable attention has been paid\nrecently to the integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) paradigm as an\nenabler for efficiently and jointly performing communication and sensing using\nthe same spectrum and hardware resources. On the other hand, ensuring\ncommunication and data security has been an imperative requirement for wireless\nnetworks throughout their evolution. The physical-layer security (PLS) concept\npaved the way to catering to the security needs in wireless networks in a\nsustainable way while guaranteeing theoretically secure transmissions,\nindependently of the computational capacity of adversaries. Therefore, it is of\nparamount importance to consider a balanced trade-off between communication\nreliability, sensing, and security in future networks, such as the 5G and\nbeyond, and the 6G. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive and system-wise\nreview of designed secure ISAC systems from a PLS point of view. In particular,\nthe impact of various physical-layer techniques, schemes, and wireless\ntechnologies to ensure the sensing-security trade-off is studied from the\nsurveyed work. Furthermore, the amalgamation of PLS and ISAC is analyzed in a\nbroader impact by considering attacks targeting data confidentiality,\ncommunication covertness, and sensing spoofing.

Additionally, these methods assume linear motion between consecutive\nevents within the loss time window, which increases optical flow errors in\nlong-time sequences. In this work, we observe that rich spatio-temporal\ninformation and accurate nonlinear motion between events are crucial for\nevent-based optical flow estimation. Therefore, we propose E-NMSTFlow, a novel\nunsupervised event-based optical flow network focusing on long-time sequences.\nWe propose a Spatio-Temporal Motion Feature Aware (STMFA) module and an\nAdaptive Motion Feature Enhancement (AMFE) module, both of which utilize rich\nspatio-temporal information to learn spatio-temporal data associations.\nMeanwhile, we propose a nonlinear motion compensation loss that utilizes the\naccurate nonlinear motion between events to improve the unsupervised learning\nof our network.

As a result, the generated images not\nonly lose key identity characteristics but also suffer from significantly\nreduced diversity. To address this issue, previous works have combined the W+\nspace from StyleGAN with diffusion models, leveraging this space to provide a\nmore accurate and comprehensive representation of identity features through\nmulti-level feature extraction. However, the entanglement of identity and\nbackground information in in-the-wild images during training prevents accurate\nidentity localization, resulting in severe semantic interference between\nidentity and background.

To favour\ntransparency, we introduce the Affordance Sheet, a document to detail the\nproposed solution, the datasets, and the validation. As the physical properties\nof an object influence the interaction with the robot, we present a generic\nframework that links visual affordance prediction to the physical world. Using\nthe weight of an object as an example for this framework, we discuss how\nestimating object mass can affect the affordance prediction.

However, the computational efficiency of the model and\nthe treatment of overlapping targets are the major challenges in the studies of\nthis problem. To this end, a neural network model RepSNet was designed based on\na nucleus boundary regression and a structural re-parameterization scheme for\nsegmenting and classifying the nuclei in H\\&E-stained histopathological images.\nFirst, RepSNet estimates the boundary position information (BPI) of the parent\nnucleus for each pixel. The BPI estimation incorporates the local information\nof the pixel and the contextual information of the parent nucleus. Then, the\nnucleus boundary is estimated by aggregating the BPIs from a series of pixels\nusing a proposed boundary voting mechanism (BVM), and the instance segmentation\nresults are computed from the estimated nucleus boundary using a connected\ncomponent analysis procedure. The BVM intrinsically achieves a kind of\nsynergistic belief enhancement among the BPIs from various pixels. Therefore,\ndifferent from the methods available in literature that obtain nucleus\nboundaries based on a direct pixel recognition scheme, RepSNet computes its\nboundary decisions based on some guidances from macroscopic information using\nan integration mechanism. In addition, RepSNet employs a re-parametrizable\nencoder-decoder structure. This model can not only aggregate features from some\nreceptive fields with various scales which helps segmentation accuracy\nimprovement, but also reduce the parameter amount and computational burdens in\nthe model inference phase through the structural re-parameterization technique.\nExtensive experiments demonstrated the superiorities of RepSNet compared to\nseveral typical benchmark models.",

    "abstract": "Simulating seismic first-arrival traveltime plays a crucial role in seismic\ntomography. First-arrival traveltime simulation relies on solving the eikonal\nequation. The accuracy of conventional numerical solvers is limited to a\nfinite-difference approximation. In recent years, physics-informed neural\nnetworks (PINNs) have been applied to achieve this task. However, traditional\nPINNs encounter challenges in accurately solving the eikonal equation,\nespecially in cases where the model exhibits directional scaling differences.\nThese challenges result in substantial traveltime prediction errors when the\ntraveling distance is long. To improve the accuracy of PINN in traveltime\nprediction, we incorporate the reciprocity principle as a constraint into the\nPINN training framework. Based on the reciprocity principle, which states that\nthe traveltime between two points remains invariant when their roles as source\nand receiver are exchanged, we propose to apply this principle to multiple\nsource-receiver pairs in PINN-based traveltime prediction. Furthermore, a\ndynamic weighting mechanism is proposed to balance the contributions of the\neikonal equation loss and the reciprocity-constrained loss during the training\nprocess. This adaptive weighting evolves dynamically with the training epochs,\nenhancing the convergency of the training process. Experiments conducted on a\nsimple lens velocity model, the Overthrust velocity model, and a 3D velocity\nmodel demonstrate that the introduction of the reciprocity-constrained PINN\nsignificantly improves the accuracy of traveltime predictions.",

    "abstract": "Swift J1727.8-1613 went into outburst in August 2023 and was one of the\nbrightest black hole X-ray binaries (BHXRBs) in recent years, leading to\nextensive observing campaigns by NICER and Insight-HXMT. The source exhibited\nstrong X-ray variability and showed type-C quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs)\non a wide range of frequencies. The high data quality over a broad range of\nX-ray energies (0.5-150 keV) enables us to study the energy-dependence of the\nQPO waveform and the phase lags at the QPO fundamental and second harmonic\nfrequencies. Using the biphase, we find that the QPO waveform is strongly\nenergy-dependent, with energy bands below and above 15-20 keV showing opposite\nwaveform evolution. We interpret the energy-dependence of the waveform as being\ndue to a pivoting spectral component at the second harmonic frequency, with a\npivot energy around 15-20 keV. Using the cross-spectrum, we find that the phase\nlags between energy bands above 7 keV at the QPO fundamental are small, while\nthose at the harmonic frequency are dominated by a separate lag component that\nextends over a broader range of frequencies and relates to the broadband noise\nvariability. Comparing the energy-dependent results obtained with the\nbispectrum and the cross-spectrum, we show that these two Fourier products\nextract different variability components, e.g. the QPO and the broadband noise,\nat the same frequencies. Finally, we compare Swift J1727.8-1613 to BHXRB MAXI\nJ1535-571 and find that their spectral-timing properties are similar,\nindicating that these QPO properties may represent a subset of sources.",

The BS algorithm enhances the agent's inference\nprocess, allowing for the generation of flexible floorplans by accomodating\nvarious objective weightings, and addressing congestion without without the\nneed for policy retraining or fine-tuning. Moreover, the RL agent's\ngeneralization ability stays intact, along with its efficient handling of\ncircuit features and constraints. Experimental results show approx. 5-85%\nimprovement in area, dead space and half-perimeter wire length compared to a\nstandard RL application, along with higher rewards for the agent. Moreover,\nperformance and efficiency align closely with those of existing\nstate-of-the-art techniques.",

Large Language Models (LLMs) assist in automated code generation\nbut often struggle with API hallucination, including invoking non-existent APIs\nand misusing existing ones in practical development scenarios. Existing studies\nresort to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods for mitigating the\nhallucination issue, but tend to fail since they generally ignore the\nstructural dependencies in practical projects and do not indeed validate\nwhether the generated APIs are available or not. To address these limitations,\nwe propose MARIN, a framework for mitigating API hallucination in code\ngenerated by LLMs with hierarchical dependency aware. MARIN consists of two\nphases: Hierarchical Dependency Mining, which analyzes local and global\ndependencies of the current function, aiming to supplement comprehensive\nproject context in LLMs input, and Dependency Constrained Decoding, which\nutilizes mined dependencies to adaptively constrain the generation process,\naiming to ensure the generated APIs align with the projects specifications. To\nfacilitate the evaluation of the degree of API hallucination, we introduce a\nnew benchmark APIHulBench and two new metrics including Micro Hallucination\nNumber (MiHN) and Macro Hallucination Rate (MaHR). Experiments on six\nstate-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate that MARIN effectively reduces API\nhallucinations, achieving an average decrease of 67.52% in MiHN and 73.56% in\nMaHR compared to the RAG approach. Applied to Huaweis internal projects and two\nproprietary LLMs, MARIN achieves average decreases of 57.33% in MiHN and 59.41%\nin MaHR.",

    "abstract": "MIDI performances are generally expedient in performance research and music\ninformation retrieval, and even more so if they can be connected to a score.\nThis connection is usually established by means of alignment, linking either\nnotes or time points between the score and the performance. The first obstacle\nwhen trying to establish such an alignment is that a performance realizes one\n(out of many) structural versions of the score that can plausibly result from\ninstructions such as repeats, variations, and navigation markers like 'dal\nsegno/da capo al coda'. A score needs to be unfolded, that is, its repeats and\nnavigation markers need to be explicitly written out to create a single\ntimeline without jumps matching the performance, before alignment algorithms\ncan be applied. In the curation of large performance corpora this process is\ncarried out manually, as no tools are available to infer the repeat structure\nof the performance. To ease this process, we develop a method to automatically\ninfer the repeat structure of a MIDI performance, given a symbolically encoded\nscore including repeat and navigation markers. The intuition guiding our design\nis: 1) local alignment of every contiguous section of the score with a section\nof a performance containing the same material should receive high alignment\ngain, whereas local alignment with any other performance section should accrue\na low or zero gain. And 2) stitching local alignments together according to a\nvalid structural version of the score should result in an approximate full\nalignment and correspondingly high global accumulated gain if the structural\nversion corresponds to the performance, and low gain for all other, ill-fitting\nstructural versions.",

Moreover, we focus on the DNA stretching due to the confinement in\nnano-pores and, finally, on the computation of the cyclization probability of\nopen ends molecules of $\\sim 100$ base pairs under physiological conditions.\nThe mesoscopic model shows a distinct advantage over the elastic rod model in\nestimating the molecule bendability at short length scale.",

The polarization\nmeasurements for Lambda and Anti-Lambda are consistent with each other,\nindicating little contribution of the spin-magnetic coupling in the observed\npolarization. The results for Lambda hyperons measurements are qualitatively\nconsistent with hydrodynamic calculations incorporating effects from\nshear-induced polarization and thermal vorticity, and show no obvious system\nsize dependence in comparison with previous results in Au+Au collisions. For\nthe first time, the dependence of the polarization on the hyperon's emission\nazimuthal angle with respect to the second harmonic event plane is extracted\nand shows stronger polarization for the in-plane emitted hyperons at the level\nof 2.4$\\sigma$ significance in 20-50% centrality. The measurements of Xi\nhyperons polarization via the polarization transfer analysis exhibit a finite\npositive polarization, 2.9$\\sigma$ significance in 20-50% centrality, slightly\nenhanced compared to the inclusive Lambda polarization.",

    "abstract": "Multi-frequency massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) communication is a\npromising strategy for both 5G and future 6G systems, ensuring reliable\ntransmission while enhancing frequency resource utilization. Statistical\nchannel state information (CSI) has been widely adopted in multi-frequency\nmassive MIMO transmissions to reduce overhead and improve transmission\nperformance. In this paper, we propose efficient and accurate methods for\nobtaining statistical CSI in multi-frequency massive MIMO systems. First, we\nintroduce a multi-frequency massive MIMO channel model and analyze the mapping\nrelationship between two types of statistical CSI, namely the angular power\nspectrum (APS) and the spatial covariance matrix, along with their correlation\nacross different frequency bands. Next, we propose an autoregressive (AR)\nmethod to predict the spatial covariance matrix of any frequency band based on\nthat of another frequency band. Furthermore, we emphasize that channels across\ndifferent frequency bands share similar APS characteristics. Leveraging the\nmaximum entropy (ME) criterion, we develop a low-complexity algorithm for\nhigh-resolution APS estimation. Simulation results validate the effectiveness\nof the AR-based covariance prediction method and demonstrate the\nhigh-resolution estimation capability of the ME-based approach. Furthermore, we\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of multi-frequency cooperative transmission by\napplying the proposed methods to obtain statistical CSI from low-frequency\nbands and utilizing it for high-frequency channel transmission. This approach\nsignificantly enhances high-frequency transmission performance while\neffectively reducing system overhead.",

In this\nregard, the electronic device community has expanded its focus to ultrascaled\ntransistors targeting 7-nm technology node and beyond.

Despite significant advancements in recent years, it\nstill remains a challenge to build a robust and reliable system for\nnaturalistic and in-the-wild facial expressive behaviour analysis in real time.\nThis paper addresses two key challenges in building such a system: (1). The\npaucity of large-scale labelled facial affect video datasets with extensive\ncoverage of the 2D emotion space, and (2). The difficulty of extracting facial\nvideo features that are discriminative, interpretable, robust, and\ncomputationally efficient. Toward addressing these challenges, we introduce\nxTrace, a robust tool for facial expressive behaviour analysis and predicting\ncontinuous values of dimensional emotions, namely valence and arousal, from\nin-the-wild face videos.\n  To address challenge (1), our affect recognition model is trained on the\nlargest facial affect video data set, containing ~450k videos that cover most\nemotion zones in the dimensional emotion space, making xTrace highly versatile\nin analysing a wide spectrum of naturalistic expressive behaviours. To address\nchallenge (2), xTrace uses facial affect descriptors that are not only\nexplainable, but can also achieve a high degree of accuracy and robustness with\nlow computational complexity. The key components of xTrace are benchmarked\nagainst three existing tools: MediaPipe, OpenFace, and Augsburg Affect Toolbox.\nOn an in-the-wild validation set composed of 50k videos, xTrace achieves 0.86\nmean CCC and 0.13 mean absolute error values. We present a detailed error\nanalysis of affect predictions from xTrace, illustrating (a). its ability to\nrecognise emotions with high accuracy across most bins in the 2D emotion space,\n(b). its robustness to non-frontal head pose angles, and (c). a strong\ncorrelation between its uncertainty estimates and its accuracy.",

Traditional Importance\nSampling (IS) often suffers from poor performance since it heavily relies on\nthe choice of the proposal distributions. The AMIS and the Modified version of\nAMIS (MAMIS) address this by iteratively refining proposal distributions and\nreusing all past samples through a recycling strategy. We introduce the RQMC\nmethods into the MAMIS, achieving higher convergence rates compared to the\nMonte Carlo (MC) methods. Our main contributions include a detailed convergence\nanalysis of the MAMIS estimator under randomized QMC (RQMC) sampling.\nSpecifically, we establish the $L^q$ $(q \\geq 2)$ error bound for the\nRQMC-based estimator using a smoothed projection method, which enables us to\napply the H\\\"older's inequality in the error analysis of the RQMC-based MAMIS\nestimator. As a result, we prove that the root mean square error of the\nRQMC-based MAMIS estimator converges at a rate of\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\bar{N}_T^{-1+\\epsilon})$, where $\\bar{N}_T$ is the average number\nof samples used in each step over $T$ iterations, and $\\epsilon > 0$ is\narbitrarily small.

    "abstract": "Cold-start bundle recommendation focuses on modeling new bundles with\ninsufficient information to provide recommendations. Advanced bundle\nrecommendation models usually learn bundle representations from multiple views\n(e.g., interaction view) at both the bundle and item levels. Consequently, the\ncold-start problem for bundles is more challenging than that for traditional\nitems due to the dual-level multi-view complexity. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel Mixture of Diffusion Experts (MoDiffE) framework, which employs a\ndivide-and-conquer strategy for cold-start bundle recommendation and follows\nthree steps:(1) Divide: The bundle cold-start problem is divided into\nindependent but similar sub-problems sequentially by level and view, which can\nbe summarized as the poor representation of feature-missing bundles in\nprior-embedding models. (2) Conquer: Beyond prior-embedding models that\nfundamentally provide the embedded representations, we introduce a\ndiffusion-based method to solve all sub-problems in a unified way, which\ndirectly generates diffusion representations using diffusion models without\ndepending on specific features. (3) Combine: A cold-aware hierarchical Mixture\nof Experts (MoE) is employed to combine results of the sub-problems for final\nrecommendations, where the two models for each view serve as experts and are\nadaptively fused for different bundles in a multi-layer manner. Additionally,\nMoDiffE adopts a multi-stage decoupled training pipeline and introduces a\ncold-start gating augmentation method to enable the training of gating for cold\nbundles. Through extensive experiments on three real-world datasets, we\ndemonstrate that MoDiffE significantly outperforms existing solutions in\nhandling cold-start bundle recommendation. It achieves up to a 0.1027 absolute\ngain in Recall@20 in cold-start scenarios and up to a 47.43\\% relative\nimprovement in all-bundle scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Cloud-device collaboration leverages on-cloud Large Language Models (LLMs)\nfor handling public user queries and on-device Small Language Models (SLMs) for\nprocessing private user data, collectively forming a powerful and\nprivacy-preserving solution. However, existing approaches often fail to fully\nleverage the scalable problem-solving capabilities of on-cloud LLMs while\nunderutilizing the advantage of on-device SLMs in accessing and processing\npersonalized data. This leads to two interconnected issues: 1) Limited\nutilization of the problem-solving capabilities of on-cloud LLMs, which fail to\nalign with personalized user-task needs, and 2) Inadequate integration of user\ndata into on-device SLM responses, resulting in mismatches in contextual user\ninformation.\n  In this paper, we propose a Leader-Subordinate Retrieval framework for\nPrivacy-preserving cloud-device collaboration (LSRP), a novel solution that\nbridges these gaps by: 1) enhancing on-cloud LLM guidance to on-device SLM\nthrough a dynamic selection of task-specific leader strategies named as\nuser-to-user retrieval-augmented generation (U-U-RAG), and 2) integrating the\ndata advantages of on-device SLMs through small model feedback Direct\nPreference Optimization (SMFB-DPO) for aligning the on-cloud LLM with the\non-device SLM.

To address this challenge, this paper explores the\nuse of reputation systems as a remedy. We propose RepuNet, a dynamic,\ndual-level reputation framework that models both agent-level reputation\ndynamics and system-level network evolution. Specifically, driven by direct\ninteractions and indirect gossip, agents form reputations for both themselves\nand their peers, and decide whether to connect or disconnect other agents for\nfuture interactions. Through two distinct scenarios, we show that RepuNet\neffectively mitigates the 'tragedy of the commons', promoting and sustaining\ncooperation in generative MASs. Moreover, we find that reputation systems can\ngive rise to rich emergent behaviors in generative MASs, such as the formation\nof cooperative clusters, the social isolation of exploitative agents, and the\npreference for sharing positive gossip rather than negative ones.",

While recent studies have explored UI\nquality evaluation using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), they largely\nfocus on surface-level features, overlooking behavior-oriented aspects. To fill\nthis gap, we introduce WiserUI-Bench, a novel benchmark for assessing models'\nmultimodal understanding of UI/UX design. It includes 300 diverse real-world UI\nimage pairs, each consisting of two design variants A/B-tested at scale by\nactual companies, where one was empirically validated to steer more user\nactions than the other. Each pair is accompanied one or more of 684\nexpert-curated rationales that capture key factors behind each winning design's\neffectiveness, spanning diverse cognitive dimensions of UX. Our benchmark\nsupports two core tasks: (1) selecting the more effective UI/UX design by\npredicting the A/B test verified winner and (2) assessing how well a model,\ngiven the winner, can explain its effectiveness in alignment with expert\nreasoning. Experiments across several MLLMs show that current models exhibit\nlimited nuanced reasoning about UI/UX design and its behavioral impact.

We demonstrate that as\ntemperature increases from zero, the phason gradually softens, leading to a\ndepinning transition (where the phason becomes gapless) at $T_d$ and a\nsubsequent first-order CDW phase transition at $T_c>T_d$.

To further validate the theory, we calculate the energy gap of CDW\namplitudon and its lifetime, and reveal a transition of amplitudon from a\nlightly damped to a heavily damped excitation during pinning-depinning\ntransition while its energy gap is nearly unchanged throughout the entire CDW\nphase.

As an alternative to fully\nsupervised approaches, query-based segmentation has shown great latent in ZSS,\nas it enables object localization without relying on explicit labels. However,\nconventional Hungarian matching, a core component in query-based frameworks,\nneeds full supervision and often misclassifies unseen categories as background\nin the setting of ZSS. To address this issue, we propose Split Matching (SM), a\nnovel assignment strategy that decouples Hungarian matching into two\ncomponents: one for seen classes in annotated regions and another for latent\nclasses in unannotated regions (referred to as unseen candidates).\nSpecifically, we partition the queries into seen and candidate groups, enabling\neach to be optimized independently according to its available supervision. To\ndiscover unseen candidates, we cluster CLIP dense features to generate pseudo\nmasks and extract region-level embeddings using CLS tokens. Matching is then\nconducted separately for the two groups based on both class-level similarity\nand mask-level consistency. Additionally, we introduce a Multi-scale Feature\nEnhancement (MFE) module that refines decoder features through residual\nmulti-scale aggregation, improving the model's ability to capture spatial\ndetails across resolutions.

    "abstract": "In this paper, AN is introduced into semantic communication systems for the\nfirst time to prevent semantic eavesdropping. However, the introduction of AN\nalso poses challenges for the legitimate receiver in extracting semantic\ninformation. Recently, denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM) have\ndemonstrated their powerful capabilities in generating multimedia content.\nHere, the paired pluggable modules are carefully designed using DDPM.\nSpecifically, the pluggable encryption module generates AN and adds it to the\noutput of the semantic transmitter, while the pluggable decryption module\nbefore semantic receiver uses DDPM to generate the detailed semantic\ninformation by removing both AN and the channel noise. In the scenario where\nthe transmitter lacks eavesdropper's knowledge, the artificial Gaussian noise\n(AGN) is used as AN. We first model a power allocation optimization problem to\ndetermine the power of AGN, in which the objective is to minimize the weighted\nsum of data reconstruction error of legal link, the mutual information of\nillegal link, and the channel input distortion. Then, a deep reinforcement\nlearning framework using deep deterministic policy gradient is proposed to\nsolve the optimization problem. In the scenario where the transmitter is aware\nof the eavesdropper's knowledge, we propose an AN generation method based on\nadversarial residual networks (ARN). Unlike the previous scenario, the mutual\ninformation term in the objective function is replaced by the confidence of\neavesdropper correctly\n  retrieving private information. The adversarial residual network is then\ntrained to minimize the modified objective function. The simulation results\nshow that the diffusion-enabled pluggable encryption module prevents semantic\neavesdropping while the pluggable decryption module achieves the high-quality\nsemantic communication.",

Although some efforts have been made to detect or mitigate IoT\nsecurity vulnerabilities, they often struggle to adapt to the complexity of IoT\nenvironments, especially when dealing with dynamic security scenarios. How to\nautomatically, efficiently, and accurately understand these vulnerabilities\nremains a challenge. To address this, we propose an IoT security assistant\ndriven by Large Language Model (LLM), which enhances the LLM's understanding of\nIoT security vulnerabilities and related threats. The aim of the ICoT method we\npropose is to enable the LLM to understand security issues by breaking down the\nvarious dimensions of security vulnerabilities and generating responses\ntailored to the user's specific needs and expertise level. By incorporating\nICoT, LLM can gradually analyze and reason through complex security scenarios,\nresulting in more accurate, in-depth, and personalized security recommendations\nand solutions.

Previously, Group Recommender Systems\n(GRS) often used social choice-based aggregation strategies to derive a single\nrecommendation based on the preferences of multiple people. In this paper, we\ninvestigate under which conditions language models can perform these strategies\ncorrectly based on zero-shot learning and analyse whether the formatting of the\ngroup scenario in the prompt affects accuracy. We specifically focused on the\nimpact of group complexity (number of users and items), different LLMs,\ndifferent prompting conditions, including In-Context learning or generating\nexplanations, and the formatting of group preferences. Our results show that\nperformance starts to deteriorate when considering more than 100 ratings.\nHowever, not all language models were equally sensitive to growing group\ncomplexity. Additionally, we showed that In-Context Learning (ICL) can\nsignificantly increase the performance at higher degrees of group complexity,\nwhile adding other prompt modifications, specifying domain cues or prompting\nfor explanations, did not impact accuracy. We conclude that future research\nshould include group complexity as a factor in GRS evaluation due to its effect\non LLM performance. Furthermore, we showed that formatting the group scenarios\ndifferently, such as rating lists per user or per item, affected accuracy.

Our starting point is the well-studied\npairwise same-set queries which ask if a pair of elements belong to the same\nclass. It is known that non-adaptive algorithms require $\\Theta(n^2)$ queries,\nwhile adaptive algorithms require $\\Theta(nk)$ queries, and the best known\nalgorithm uses $k-1$ rounds. This problem has been studied extensively over the\nlast two decades in multiple communities due to its fundamental nature and\nrelevance to clustering, active learning, and crowd sourcing. In many\napplications, it is of high interest to reduce adaptivity while minimizing\nquery complexity. We give a complete characterization of the deterministic\nquery complexity of this problem as a function of the number of rounds, $r$,\ninterpolating between the non-adaptive and adaptive settings: for any constant\n$r$, the query complexity is\n$\\Theta(n^{1+\\frac{1}{2^r-1}}k^{1-\\frac{1}{2^r-1}})$. Our algorithm only needs\n$O(\\log \\log n)$ rounds to attain the optimal $O(nk)$ query complexity.\n  Next, we consider two generalizations of pairwise queries to subsets $S$ of\nsize at most $s$: (1) weak subset queries which return the number of classes\nintersected by $S$, and (2) strong subset queries which return the entire\npartition restricted on $S$. Once again in crowd sourcing applications, queries\non large sets may be prohibitive. For non-adaptive algorithms, we show\n$\\Omega(n^2/s^2)$ strong queries are needed. Perhaps surprisingly, we show that\nthere is a non-adaptive algorithm using weak queries that matches this bound up\nto log-factors for all $s \\leq \\sqrt{n}$.

Current online map matching\nmethods are prone to errors in complex road networks, especially in multilevel\nroad area. To address this challenge, we propose an online Standard Definition\n(SD) map matching method by constructing a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) with\nmultiple probability factors. Our proposed method can achieve accurate map\nmatching even in complex road networks by carefully leveraging lane markings\nand scenario recognition in the designing of the probability factors. First,\nthe lane markings are generated by a multi-lane tracking method and associated\nwith the SD map using HMM to build an enriched SD map. In areas covered by the\nenriched SD map, the vehicle can re-localize itself by performing Iterative\nClosest Point (ICP) registration for the lane markings. Then, the probability\nfactor accounting for the lane marking detection can be obtained using the\nassociation probability between adjacent lanes and roads. Second, the driving\nscenario recognition model is applied to generate the emission probability\nfactor of scenario recognition, which improves the performance of map matching\non elevated roads and ordinary urban roads underneath them. We validate our\nmethod through extensive road tests in Europe and China, and the experimental\nresults show that our proposed method effectively improves the online map\nmatching accuracy as compared to other existing methods, especially in\nmultilevel road area. Specifically, the experiments show that our proposed\nmethod achieves $F_1$ scores of 98.04% and 94.60% on the Zenseact Open Dataset\nand test data of multilevel road areas in Shanghai respectively, significantly\noutperforming benchmark methods.

    "abstract": "Using data from the SRG/eROSITA all-sky X-ray survey and the GAIA-based\ncatalog of 2,209 members of the Pleiades open star cluster, we found 850 X-ray\nsources associated with the cluster stars. Over 650 of them were detected in\nX-rays for the first time. At the distance of the Pleiades, the nominal\nsensitivity of eROSITA corresponds to a luminosity of $L_X \\sim 1.6 \\cdot\n10^{28}$ erg/s in the 0.3-2.3 keV band. The eROSITA sources associated with\nPleiades stars have a total luminosity of $L_{X,tot} \\sim 1.3 \\cdot 10^{32}$\nerg/s , a million times greater than the X-ray luminosity of the quiet Sun.\nStrong X-ray variability, more than 10 times, was recorded for 27 sources. Most\nof them are known as eruptive optical variables of the dM class. The value of\n$R_X=log(L_X/L_{bol})$ increases with decreasing effective temperature of the\nstar from $R_X\\approx -5$ to $R_X\\approx -2$. The distribution of stars over\n$R_X$ is bimodal, with the left peak at $R_X\\sim-4.3$ being formed by stars of\nFGK classes, and the right peak at $R_X\\sim-3.1$ being mainly populated by\nM-stars. The relation between $R_X$ and the Rossby number $Ro$ depends on the\nspectral class. For K- and M- stars, at low Rossby numbers $R_X\\sim -3$ and\ndepends weakly on $Ro$. At $Ro \\gt 0.25$, a rapid drop in $R_X$ is observed for\nK stars, while in our sample there are no M stars with large Rossby number.\nMost of F- and G- stars appear to have smaller $R_X\\sim -4.5$, however, our\nsample size is insufficient for a more detailed characterization of their\n$R_X-Ro$ dependence.",

Compared to\nmonostatic ISAC, bistatic ISAC can eliminate the critical challenge of\nself-interference cancellation and is well compatible with the existing network\ninfrastructures. However, the synchronization between the transmitter and the\nsensing receiver becomes a crucial problem. The extracted channel state\ninformation (CSI) for sensing under communication synchronization contains\ndifferent types of system errors, such as the sampling time offset (STO),\ncarrier frequency offset (CFO), and random phase shift, which can severely\ndegrade sensing performance or even render sensing infeasible. To address this\nproblem, a reference-path-aided system calibration scheme is designed for\nmmWave bistatic ISAC systems, where the line-of-sight (LoS) path can be\nblocked. By exploiting the delay-angle sparsity feature in mmWave ISAC systems,\nthe reference path, which can be either a LoS or a non-LoS (NLoS) path, is\nfirst identified. By leveraging the fact that all the paths suffer the same\nsystem errors, the channel parameter extracted from the reference path is\nutilized to compensate for the system errors in all other paths. A mmWave ISAC\nsystem is developed to validate our design. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat the proposed scheme can support precise estimation of Doppler shift and\ndelay, maintaining time-synchronization errors within 1 nanosecond.",

Even if the input videos are\nstable, the stitched video can inevitably cause undesired warping shakes and\naffect the visual experience. To address this issue, we propose StabStitch++, a\nnovel video stitching framework to realize spatial stitching and temporal\nstabilization with unsupervised learning simultaneously. First, different from\nexisting learning-based image stitching solutions that typically warp one image\nto align with another, we suppose a virtual midplane between original image\nplanes and project them onto it. Concretely, we design a differentiable\nbidirectional decomposition module to disentangle the homography transformation\nand incorporate it into our spatial warp, evenly spreading alignment burdens\nand projective distortions across two views. Then, inspired by camera paths in\nvideo stabilization, we derive the mathematical expression of stitching\ntrajectories in video stitching by elaborately integrating spatial and temporal\nwarps. Finally, a warp smoothing model is presented to produce stable stitched\nvideos with a hybrid loss to simultaneously encourage content alignment,\ntrajectory smoothness, and online collaboration. Compared with StabStitch that\nsacrifices alignment for stabilization, StabStitch++ makes no compromise and\noptimizes both of them simultaneously, especially in the online mode. To\nestablish an evaluation benchmark and train the learning framework, we build a\nvideo stitching dataset with a rich diversity in camera motions and scenes.\nExperiments exhibit that StabStitch++ surpasses current solutions in stitching\nperformance, robustness, and efficiency, offering compelling advancements in\nthis field by building a real-time online video stitching system.",

This paper innovatively proposes an\nInter-Diffusion Generation Model of Speakers and Listeners for Effective\nCommunication. For the first time, we integrate the full-body gestures of\nlisteners into the generation framework. By devising a novel inter-diffusion\nmechanism, this model can accurately capture the complex interaction patterns\nbetween speakers and listeners during communication. In the model construction\nprocess, based on the advanced diffusion model architecture, we innovatively\nintroduce interaction conditions and the GAN model to increase the denoising\nstep size. As a result, when generating gesture sequences, the model can not\nonly dynamically generate based on the speaker's speech information but also\nrespond in realtime to the listener's feedback, enabling synergistic\ninteraction between the two. Abundant experimental results demonstrate that\ncompared with the current state-of-the-art gesture generation methods, the\nmodel we proposed has achieved remarkable improvements in the naturalness,\ncoherence, and speech-gesture synchronization of the generated gestures. In the\nsubjective evaluation experiments, users highly praised the generated\ninteraction scenarios, believing that they are closer to real life human\ncommunication situations.

    "abstract": "In-Context Learning (ICL) has emerged as a pivotal capability of\nauto-regressive large language models, yet it is hindered by a notable\nsensitivity to the ordering of context examples regardless of their mutual\nindependence. To address this issue, recent studies have introduced several\nvariant algorithms of ICL that achieve permutation invariance. However, many of\nthese do not exhibit comparable performance with the standard auto-regressive\nICL algorithm. In this work, we identify two crucial elements in the design of\nan invariant ICL algorithm: information non-leakage and context\ninterdependence, which are not simultaneously achieved by any of the existing\nmethods. These investigations lead us to the proposed Invariant ICL (InvICL), a\nmethodology designed to achieve invariance in ICL while ensuring the two\nproperties. Empirically, our findings reveal that InvICL surpasses previous\nmodels, both invariant and non-invariant, in most benchmark datasets,\nshowcasing superior generalization capabilities across varying input lengths.\nCode is available at https://github.com/PKU-ML/InvICL.",

Existing\napproaches to preference modeling often rely on an explicit or implicit reward\nfunction, overlooking the intricate and multifaceted nature of human\npreferences that may encompass conflicting factors across diverse tasks and\npopulations. To address this limitation, we introduce Latent Preference Coding\n(LPC), a novel framework that models the implicit factors as well as their\ncombinations behind holistic preferences using discrete latent codes. LPC\nseamlessly integrates with various offline alignment algorithms, automatically\ninferring the underlying factors and their importance from data without relying\non pre-defined reward functions and hand-crafted combination weights. Extensive\nexperiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that LPC consistently improves\nupon three alignment algorithms (DPO, SimPO, and IPO) using three base models\n(Mistral-7B, Llama3-8B, and Llama3-8B-Instruct). Furthermore, deeper analysis\nreveals that the learned latent codes effectively capture the differences in\nthe distribution of human preferences and significantly enhance the robustness\nof alignment against noise in data. By providing a unified representation for\nthe multifarious preference factors, LPC paves the way towards developing more\nrobust and versatile alignment techniques for the responsible deployment of\npowerful LLMs.",

In many of these scenarios, the quantum state of the probe is flipped\nregularly by the application of ${\\pi}$-pulses to accumulate information about\nthe target periodic-field. The emergence of a discrete time crystalline phase,\nas a nonequilibrium phase of matter, naturally provides oscillations in a\nmany-body system with an inherent controllable frequency. They benefit from\nlong coherence time and robustness against imperfections, which makes them\nexcellent potential quantum sensors. In this paper, through theoretical and\nnumerical analysis, we show that a disorder-free discrete time crystal probe\ncan reach the ultimate achievable precision for sensing a periodic-field. As\nthe amplitude of the periodic-field increases, the discrete time crystalline\norder diminishes, and the performance of the probe decreases remarkably.\nNevertheless, the obtained quantum enhancement in the discrete time crystal\nphase shows robustness against different imperfections in the protocol.\nFinally, we propose the implementation of our protocol in ultra-cold atoms in\noptical lattices.",

We investigated this potential dependence, since\nunaccounted variations of the instrumental response could degrade polarimetric\nmeasurements. Additionally, we aimed to develop a method for properly\ncalibrating NRT pulsar observations conducted before November 2019. We\nconducted three series of observations of bright pulsars over wide declination\nranges, in a special observation mode in which the feed horn rotates by $\\sim$\n180$^\\circ$ degrees across the observation, enabling us to determine the full\npolarimetric response of the NRT while modeling potential variations of\ncalibration parameters with hour angle and declination. In addition, we used\nthe METM technique to improve the calibration of pre-November 2019 data. From\nthe analysis of the series of observations of bright pulsars with horn\nrotation, we found that the polarimetric response of the NRT does not appear to\nvary with hour angle or declination.

In irregular and dispersed plantations,\ntraditional grid-based CPP often causes redundant coverage over non-vegetated\nareas, leading to waste and pollution. To overcome these limitations, we\npropose CPP-DIP, a multi-objective CPP framework designed for Micro Air\nVehicles (MAVs). The framework transforms the CPP task into a Traveling\nSalesman Problem (TSP) and optimizes flight paths by minimizing travel\ndistance, turning angles, and intersection counts. Unlike conventional\napproaches, our method does not rely on GPS-based environmental modeling.\nInstead, it uses aerial imagery and a Histogram of Oriented Gradients\n(HOG)-based approach to detect trees and extract image coordinates. A\ndensity-aware waypoint strategy is applied: Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) is\nused to reduce redundant waypoints in dense regions, while a greedy algorithm\nensures complete coverage in sparse areas. To verify the generality of the\nframework, we solve the resulting TSP using three different methods: Greedy\nHeuristic Insertion (GHI), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), and Monte Carlo\nReinforcement Learning (MCRL). Then an object-based optimization is applied to\nfurther refine the resulting path. Additionally, CPP-DIP integrates ForaNav,\nour insect-inspired navigation method, for accurate tree localization and\ntracking. The experimental results show that MCRL offers a balanced solution,\nreducing the travel distance by 16.9 % compared to ACO while maintaining a\nsimilar performance to GHI. It also improves path smoothness by reducing\nturning angles by 28.3 % and 59.9 % relative to ACO and GHI, respectively, and\neffectively eliminates intersections. These results confirm the robustness and\neffectiveness of CPP-DIP in different TSP solvers.",

However, since these foundation\nmodels are not specifically designed for driving and their reasoning is not\nconsistent with the feasibility of low-level motion planning, concerns remain\nregarding safety and smooth task switching. This paper integrates LVLMs with\nMPC Builder, which automatically generates MPCs on demand, based on symbolic\ntask commands generated by the LVLM, while ensuring optimality and safety. The\ngenerated MPCs can strongly assist the execution or rejection of LVLM-driven\ntask switching by providing feedback on the feasibility of the given tasks and\ngenerating task-switching-aware MPCs. Our approach provides a safe, flexible,\nand adaptable control framework, bridging the gap between cutting-edge\nfoundation models and reliable vehicle operation. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our approach through a simulation experiment, showing that our\nsystem can safely and effectively handle highway driving while maintaining the\nflexibility and adaptability of LVLMs.",

    "abstract": "Biological brains demonstrate complex neural activity, where the timing and\ninterplay between neurons is critical to how brains process information. Most\ndeep learning architectures simplify neural activity by abstracting away\ntemporal dynamics. In this paper we challenge that paradigm. By incorporating\nneuron-level processing and synchronization, we can effectively reintroduce\nneural timing as a foundational element. We present the Continuous Thought\nMachine (CTM), a model designed to leverage neural dynamics as its core\nrepresentation. The CTM has two core innovations: (1) neuron-level temporal\nprocessing, where each neuron uses unique weight parameters to process a\nhistory of incoming signals; and (2) neural synchronization employed as a\nlatent representation. The CTM aims to strike a balance between oversimplified\nneuron abstractions that improve computational efficiency, and biological\nrealism. It operates at a level of abstraction that effectively captures\nessential temporal dynamics while remaining computationally tractable for deep\nlearning. We demonstrate the CTM's strong performance and versatility across a\nrange of challenging tasks, including ImageNet-1K classification, solving 2D\nmazes, sorting, parity computation, question-answering, and RL tasks. Beyond\ndisplaying rich internal representations and offering a natural avenue for\ninterpretation owing to its internal process, the CTM is able to perform tasks\nthat require complex sequential reasoning. The CTM can also leverage adaptive\ncompute, where it can stop earlier for simpler tasks, or keep computing when\nfaced with more challenging instances. The goal of this work is to share the\nCTM and its associated innovations, rather than pushing for new\nstate-of-the-art results. To that end, we believe the CTM represents a\nsignificant step toward developing more biologically plausible and powerful\nartificial intelligence systems.",

Their online computing\nnature allows for ready application to new tasks without extensive retraining.\nHowever, due to the complexity of physical contacts, existing model-based\nmethods encounter challenges in efficient online planning and handling modeling\nerrors, which limit their practical applications. To advance the effectiveness\nand robustness of model-based contact-rich in-hand manipulation, this paper\nproposes a novel integrated framework that mitigates these limitations.

The\nhigh-level module facilitates real-time planning and disturbance recovery. At\nthe low level, these integrated references are concurrently tracked using a\nhand force-motion model and actual tactile feedback.

In this paper, we propose a secure DNN watermarking\nscheme named ChainMarks, which generates secure and robust watermarks by\nintroducing a cryptographic chain into the trigger inputs and utilizes a\ntwo-phase Monte Carlo method for determining watermark presence. First,\nChainMarks generates trigger inputs as a watermark dataset by repeatedly\napplying a hash function over a secret key, where the target labels associated\nwith trigger inputs are generated from the digital signature of model owner.\nThen, the watermarked model is produced by training a DNN over both the\noriginal and watermark datasets. To verify watermarks, we compare the predicted\nlabels of trigger inputs with the target labels and determine ownership with a\nmore accurate decision threshold that considers the classification probability\nof specific models. Experimental results show that ChainMarks exhibits higher\nlevels of robustness and security compared to state-of-the-art watermarking\nschemes.

The\noptimised CF models were used to study the internal and external field impacts\nto the CF excitation peaks of these Kramers and non-Kramers ions. The Kramers\nions excitations consist of doublets due to the Kramers degeneracy theorem\nwhile the non-Kramers ions excitations are non-degenerated singlets. The\nground-state doublets of all Kramers ions undergo peak splitting and generate\nlow energy excitation peaks ~ 1 meV under the internal magnetic fields from the\nFe$^{3+}$ and RE$^{3+}$ sublattices. The ground-states of non-Kramers ions may\nform pseudo doublets due to the accidental degeneracy of two singlet states, as\nthe case of Ho$^{3+}$ in HoFeO$_3$. Such pseudo-doublet ground states can split\nand produce low energy excitations just like the Kramers ions. However, singlet\nground states of non-Kramers ions without accidental degeneracy, like\nPr$^{3+}$, has no ground state excitation and splitting at zero fields. A\nground-state singlet excitation shows up under non-zero magnetic fields due to\nthe symmetry breaking induced by the magnetic fields.

Previous theoretical\nstudies predicted 16O + 2$\\alpha$ condensed states.

Purpose: To address this issue, we aim to provide\na more robust theoretical verification of the 16O + 2$\\alpha$ condensation. Our\ngoal is to clearly identify the resonant states and predict their properties,\nsuch as decay widths. Method: We employ the real-time evolution method (REM),\nwhich generates physically important basis states using the equation of motion,\nminimizing contamination from the continuum. The analytical continuation in the\ncoupling constant (ACCC) was used to estimate the $\\alpha$-decay widths.\nResults: The present calculations show much better convergence of eigenstates,\nand the $0^+_3$ and $0^+_4$ states showed remarkable isoscalar monopole\ntransition strengths, which were in good agreement with the predictions of\nIchikawa et al. The small alpha-decay widths for these states suggest that\nexperimental observation appears feasible. Conclusion: The present results show\nthe reasonable agreement with a previous work, firmly establishing the $0^+_3$\nand $0^+_4$ states approximately 5 and 1 MeV below the 16O + 2$\\alpha$\nthreshold as candidates for the 2$\\alpha$ condensation around the core nucleus\n16O.

    "abstract": "Hypergraphs, capable of representing high-order interactions via hyperedges,\nhave become a powerful tool for modeling real-world biological and social\nsystems. Inherent relationships within these real-world systems, such as the\nencoding relationship between genes and their protein products, drive the\nestablishment of interconnections between multiple hypergraphs. Here, we\ndemonstrate how to utilize those interconnections between multiple hypergraphs\nto synthesize integrated information from multiple higher-order systems,\nthereby enhancing understanding of underlying structures. We propose a model\nbased on the stochastic block model, which integrates information from multiple\nhypergraphs to reveal latent high-order structures. Real-world hyperedges\nexhibit preferential attachment, where certain nodes dominate hyperedge\nformation. To characterize this phenomenon, our model introduces hyperedge\ninternal degree to quantify nodes' contributions to hyperedge formation. This\nmodel is capable of mining communities, predicting missing hyperedges of\narbitrary sizes within hypergraphs, and inferring inter-hypergraph edges\nbetween hypergraphs. We apply our model to high-order datasets to evaluate its\nperformance. Experimental results demonstrate strong performance of our model\nin community detection, hyperedge prediction, and inter-hypergraph edge\nprediction tasks. Moreover, we show that our model enables analysis of multiple\nhypergraphs of different types and supports the analysis of a single hypergraph\nin the absence of inter-hypergraph edges. Our work provides a practical and\nflexible tool for analyzing multiple hypergraphs, greatly advancing the\nunderstanding of the organization in real-world high-order systems.",

    "abstract": "The peer review process in major artificial intelligence (AI) conferences\nfaces unprecedented challenges with the surge of paper submissions (exceeding\n10,000 submissions per venue), accompanied by growing concerns over review\nquality and reviewer responsibility. This position paper argues for the need to\ntransform the traditional one-way review system into a bi-directional feedback\nloop where authors evaluate review quality and reviewers earn formal\naccreditation, creating an accountability framework that promotes a\nsustainable, high-quality peer review system. The current review system can be\nviewed as an interaction between three parties: the authors, reviewers, and\nsystem (i.e., conference), where we posit that all three parties share\nresponsibility for the current problems. However, issues with authors can only\nbe addressed through policy enforcement and detection tools, and ethical\nconcerns can only be corrected through self-reflection. As such, this paper\nfocuses on reforming reviewer accountability with systematic rewards through\ntwo key mechanisms: (1) a two-stage bi-directional review system that allows\nauthors to evaluate reviews while minimizing retaliatory behavior, (2)a\nsystematic reviewer reward system that incentivizes quality reviewing. We ask\nfor the community's strong interest in these problems and the reforms that are\nneeded to enhance the peer review process.",

A fundamental task in this field is ego-centric 3D visual\ngrounding, where agents locate target objects in real-world 3D spaces based on\nverbal descriptions. However, this task faces two significant challenges: (1)\nloss of fine-grained visual semantics due to sparse fusion of point clouds with\nego-centric multi-view images, (2) limited textual semantic context due to\narbitrary language descriptions. We propose DenseGrounding, a novel approach\ndesigned to address these issues by enhancing both visual and textual\nsemantics. For visual features, we introduce the Hierarchical Scene Semantic\nEnhancer, which retains dense semantics by capturing fine-grained global scene\nfeatures and facilitating cross-modal alignment. For text descriptions, we\npropose a Language Semantic Enhancer that leverages large language models to\nprovide rich context and diverse language descriptions with additional context\nduring model training. Extensive experiments show that DenseGrounding\nsignificantly outperforms existing methods in overall accuracy, with\nimprovements of 5.81% and 7.56% when trained on the comprehensive full dataset\nand smaller mini subset, respectively, further advancing the SOTA in egocentric\n3D visual grounding.

Existing methods often struggle to\nmaintain anatomical fidelity while accurately modeling pathological features,\nfrequently relying on priors derived from natural images or inefficient\nmulti-step sampling. In this work, we introduce ViCTr (Vital Consistency\nTransfer), a novel two-stage framework that combines a rectified flow\ntrajectory with a Tweedie-corrected diffusion process to achieve high-fidelity,\npathology-aware image synthesis.

As a consequence, item ID\nembeddings frequently exhibit suboptimal characteristics despite the\nconvergence of multimodal feature parameters. Given the rich informational\ncontent inherent in multimodal features, in this paper, we propose a novel\nmodel (i.e., LIRDRec) that learns item representations directly from these\nfeatures to augment recommendation performance. Recognizing that features\nderived from each modality may capture disparate yet correlated aspects of\nitems, we propose a multimodal transformation mechanism, integrated with\nmodality-specific encoders, to effectively fuse features from all modalities.\nMoreover, to differentiate the influence of diverse modality types, we devise a\nprogressive weight copying fusion module within LIRDRec. This module\nincrementally learns the weight assigned to each modality in synthesizing the\nfinal user or item representations. Finally, we utilize the powerful visual\nunderstanding of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to convert the item\nimages into texts and extract semantics embeddings upon the texts via LLMs.\nEmpirical evaluations conducted on five real-world datasets validate the\nsuperiority of our approach relative to competing baselines.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce zip-tries, which are simple, dynamic,\nmemory-efficient data structures for strings. Zip-tries support search and\nupdate operations for $k$-length strings in $\\mathcal{O}(k+\\log n)$ time in the\nstandard RAM model or in $\\mathcal{O}(k/\\alpha+\\log n)$ time in the word RAM\nmodel, where $\\alpha$ is the length of the longest string that can fit in a\nmemory word, and $n$ is the number of strings in the trie. Importantly, we show\nhow zip-tries can achieve this while only requiring $\\mathcal{O}(\\log{\\log{n}}\n+ \\log{\\log{\\frac{k}{\\alpha}}})$ bits of metadata per node w.h.p., which is an\nexponential improvement over previous results for long strings. Despite being\nconsiderably simpler and more memory efficient, we show how zip-tries perform\ncompetitively with state-of-the-art data structures on large datasets of long\nstrings.\n  Furthermore, we provide a simple, general framework for parallelizing string\ncomparison operations in linked data structures, which we apply to zip-tries to\nobtain parallel zip-tries. Parallel zip-tries are able to achieve good search\nand update performance in parallel, performing such operations in\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\log{n})$ span. We also apply our techniques to an existing\nexternal-memory string data structure, the string B-tree, obtaining a parallel\nstring B-tree which performs search operations using $\\mathcal{O}(\\log_B{n})$\nI/O span and $\\mathcal{O}(\\frac{k}{\\alpha B} + \\log_B{n})$ I/O work in the\nparallel external memory (PEM) model. The parallel string B-tree can perform\nprefix searches using only $\\mathcal{O}(\\frac{\\log{n}}{\\log{\\log{n}}})$ span\nunder the practical PRAM model.\n  For the case of long strings that share short common prefixes, we provide\nLCP-aware variants of all our algorithms that should be quite efficient in\npractice, which we justify empirically.",

    "abstract": "Neural operators have demonstrated promise in modeling and controlling\nsystems governed by Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). Beyond PDEs,\nStochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDEs) play a critical role in\nmodeling systems influenced by randomness, with applications in finance,\nphysics, and beyond. However, controlling SPDE-governed systems remains a\nsignificant challenge. On the one hand, the regularity of the system's state\n(which can be intuitively understood as smoothness) deteriorates, making\nmodeling and generalization more challenging. On the other hand, this\nstochasticity also renders control more unstable and thus less accurate. To\naddress this gap, we propose the Model-Based Closed-Loop Control Algorithm\n(MB-CC), the first model-based closed-loop control method for SPDEs. MB-CC\nintroduces two key innovations to enhance control robustness and efficiency: a\nRegularity Feature (RF) block and a closed-loop strategy with an\noperator-encoded policy network. The RF block, inspired by the regularity\nstructure theory of SPDEs, addresses noise-induced irregularities by\ntransforming the network's input, including the system state and\nnoise-perturbed external forces, into a refined feature space for improved\nforward prediction. Compared to previous works using regularity features, we\nintroduce a new parameterization, data augmentation, and extend the RF block as\na plug-and-play component. Additionally, to achieve closed-loop control, we\nintroduce an operator-encoded policy network to map the current state to\noptimal control, which integrates physical priors and swiftly makes decisions\nbased on states returned by the environment. We conduct a systematic evaluation\nof MB-CC on two notable SPDEs, showcasing its effectiveness and efficiency. The\nablation studies show its ability to handle stochasticity more effectively.",

    "abstract": "Recommender systems are essential for delivering personalized content across\ndigital platforms by modeling user preferences and behaviors.

In the presence of traveling delays, the\njoin-the-shortest-queue (JSQ) policy induces queue length oscillations and\nprolongs the mean waiting time. A variant of the JSQ policy, dubbed the\nrandomized join-the-shortest-queue (RJSQ) policy, is devised to mitigate the\noscillation phenomenon. By the RJSQ policy, customers are sent to each station\nwith a probability approximately proportional to its service capacity; only a\nsmall fraction of customers are purposely routed to the shortest queue. The\nadditional probability of routing a customer to the shortest queue, referred to\nas the balancing fraction, dictates the policy's performance. When the\nbalancing fraction is within a certain range, load imbalance between the\nstations is negligible in heavy traffic, so that complete resource pooling is\nachieved. We specify the optimal order of magnitude for the balancing fraction,\nby which heuristic formulas are proposed to fine-tune the RJSQ policy. A joint\nproblem of capacity planning and load balancing is considered for\ngeographically separated stations. With well planned service capacities, the\nRJSQ policy sends all but a small fraction of customers to the nearest\nstations, rendering the system asymptotically equivalent to an aggregated\nsingle-server system with all customers having minimum traveling delays.

    "abstract": "Accurate building damage assessment using bi-temporal multi-modal remote\nsensing images is essential for effective disaster response and recovery\nplanning. This study proposes a novel Building-Guided Pseudo-Label Learning\nFramework to address the challenges of mapping building damage from\npre-disaster optical and post-disaster SAR images. First, we train a series of\nbuilding extraction models using pre-disaster optical images and building\nlabels. To enhance building segmentation, we employ multi-model fusion and\ntest-time augmentation strategies to generate pseudo-probabilities, followed by\na low-uncertainty pseudo-label training method for further refinement. Next, a\nchange detection model is trained on bi-temporal cross-modal images and damaged\nbuilding labels. To improve damage classification accuracy, we introduce a\nbuilding-guided low-uncertainty pseudo-label refinement strategy, which\nleverages building priors from the previous step to guide pseudo-label\ngeneration for damaged buildings, reducing uncertainty and enhancing\nreliability. Experimental results on the 2025 IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest\ndataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which achieved the\nhighest mIoU score (54.28%) and secured first place in the competition.",

    "abstract": "While Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have become increasingly popular across various\nscientific disciplines for their ability to model and interlink huge quantities\nof data, essentially all real-world KGs are known to be incomplete. As such,\nwith the growth of KG use has been a concurrent development of machine learning\ntools designed to predict missing information in KGs, which is referred to as\nthe Link Prediction Task. The majority of state-of-the-art link predictors to\ndate have followed an embedding-based paradigm. In this paradigm, it is assumed\nthat the information content of a KG is best represented by the (individual)\nvector representations of its nodes and edges, and that therefore node and edge\nembeddings are particularly well-suited to performing link prediction.\n  This thesis proposes an alternative perspective on the field's approach to\nlink prediction and KG data modelling. Specifically, this work re-analyses KGs\nand state-of-the-art link predictors from a graph-structure-first perspective\nthat models the information content of a KG in terms of whole triples, rather\nthan individual nodes and edges.\n  Following a literature review and two core sets of experiments, this thesis\nconcludes that a structure-first perspective on KGs and link prediction is both\nviable and useful for understanding KG learning and for enabling cross-KG\ntransfer learning for the link prediction task. This observation is used to\ncreate and propose the Structural Alignment Hypothesis, which postulates that\nlink prediction can be understood and modelled as a structural task.\n  All code and data used for this thesis are open-sourced.

However, in practice, we are often\nlimited to a fixed pool of reusable labeled data points, making it inevitable\nto recycle data across tuples to create sufficiently large datasets. Therefore,\nthe tuple-wise independence condition imposed by previous works is invalidated.\nIn this paper, we provide a generalization analysis for the CRL framework under\nnon-$i.i.d.$ settings that adheres to practice more realistically.

Belief filters act as content-aware\noperations on these fragments across various cognitive transitions.

However, previous\nmethods for constructing effective Hamiltonian models suffer from key\nlimitations: some require to manually predefine interaction terms limited\nflexibility in capturing complex systems, while others lack efficiency in\nselecting optimal interactions. In this work, we introduce the Lasso-GA Hybrid\nMethod (LGHM), a novel approach that combines Lasso regression and genetic\nalgorithms to rapidly construct effective Hamiltonian models. Such method is\nbroadly applicable to both magnetic systems (e.g., spin Hamiltonians) and\natomic displacement models. To verify the reliability and usefulness of LGHM,\nwe take monolayer CrI_3 and Fe_3 GaTe_2 as examples. In both cases, LGHM not\nonly successfully identifies key interaction terms with high fitting accuracy,\nbut also reproduces experimental magnetic ground states and Curie temperatures\nwith further Monte Carlo simulations. Notable, our analysis of monolayer Fe_3\nGaTe_2 reveals that the single-ion anisotropy and Heisenberg interaction lead\nto an out-of-plane ferromagnetic ground state, while the fourth-order\ninteractions contribute significantly to the high Curie temperature. Our method\nis general so it can be applied to construct other effective Hamiltonian\nmodels.",

In artificial\nintelligence, as systems increasingly operate in open, uncertain, and\nmultimodal environments, reasoning becomes essential for enabling robust and\nadaptive behavior. Large Multimodal Reasoning Models (LMRMs) have emerged as a\npromising paradigm, integrating modalities such as text, images, audio, and\nvideo to support complex reasoning capabilities and aiming to achieve\ncomprehensive perception, precise understanding, and deep reasoning. As\nresearch advances, multimodal reasoning has rapidly evolved from modular,\nperception-driven pipelines to unified, language-centric frameworks that offer\nmore coherent cross-modal understanding. While instruction tuning and\nreinforcement learning have improved model reasoning, significant challenges\nremain in omni-modal generalization, reasoning depth, and agentic behavior. To\naddress these issues, we present a comprehensive and structured survey of\nmultimodal reasoning research, organized around a four-stage developmental\nroadmap that reflects the field's shifting design philosophies and emerging\ncapabilities. First, we review early efforts based on task-specific modules,\nwhere reasoning was implicitly embedded across stages of representation,\nalignment, and fusion. Next, we examine recent approaches that unify reasoning\ninto multimodal LLMs, with advances such as Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT)\nand multimodal reinforcement learning enabling richer and more structured\nreasoning chains. Finally, drawing on empirical insights from challenging\nbenchmarks and experimental cases of OpenAI O3 and O4-mini, we discuss the\nconceptual direction of native large multimodal reasoning models (N-LMRMs),\nwhich aim to support scalable, agentic, and adaptive reasoning and planning in\ncomplex, real-world environments.",

It uses a detection model to evaluate the existence of these\nobjects in each incoming frame. Then, it blurs out a subset of objects such\nthat the existence of the remaining objects satisfies the specification. We\nthen propose a conformal prediction approach to (i) establish a theoretical\nlower bound on the probability of the existence of these objects in a sequence\nof frames satisfying the specification and (ii) update the bound with the\narrival of each subsequent frame. Quantitative evaluations show that PCVS\nachieves over 95 percent specification satisfaction rate in multiple datasets,\nsignificantly outperforming other methods.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in AI have catalyzed the adoption of intelligent educational\ntools, yet many semantic retrieval systems remain ill-suited to the unique\nlinguistic and structural characteristics of academic content. This study\npresents two open-source embedding models fine-tuned for educational question\nanswering, particularly in the context of course syllabi. A synthetic dataset\nof 3,197 sentence pairs, spanning synonymous terminology, paraphrased\nquestions, and implicit-explicit mappings, was constructed through a\ncombination of manual curation and large language model (LLM)-assisted\ngeneration. Two training strategies were evaluated: (1) a baseline model\nfine-tuned using MultipleNegativesRankingLoss (MNRL), and (2) a dual-loss model\nthat combines MNRL with CosineSimilarityLoss to improve both semantic ranking\nand similarity calibration. Evaluations were conducted on 28 university course\nsyllabi using a fixed set of natural language questions categorized into\ncourse, faculty, and teaching assistant information. Results demonstrate that\nboth fine-tuned models outperform strong open-source baselines, including\nall-MiniLM-L6-v2 and multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-cos-v1, and that the dual-loss model\nnarrows the performance gap with high-performing proprietary embeddings such as\nOpenAI's text-embedding-3 series.

While diffusion-based methods have shown promise in\ntext generation, they still struggle to produce high-quality results. These\nmethods often generate distorted or unrecognizable characters, particularly\nwhen dealing with complex characters like Chinese. In such systems, characters\nare composed of intricate stroke patterns and spatial relationships that must\nbe precisely maintained. We present GlyphMastero, a specialized glyph encoder\ndesigned to guide the latent diffusion model for generating texts with\nstroke-level precision. Our key insight is that existing methods, despite using\npretrained OCR models for feature extraction, fail to capture the hierarchical\nnature of text structures - from individual strokes to stroke-level\ninteractions to overall character-level structure. To address this, our glyph\nencoder explicitly models and captures the cross-level interactions between\nlocal-level individual characters and global-level text lines through our novel\nglyph attention module. Meanwhile, our model implements a feature pyramid\nnetwork to fuse the multi-scale OCR backbone features at the global-level.\nThrough these cross-level and multi-scale fusions, we obtain more detailed\nglyph-aware guidance, enabling precise control over the scene text generation\nprocess.

We\nperform 2D hydrodynamic simulations of six stars with the fully compressible\nMultidimensional Stellar Implicit Code (MUSIC). Our simulations do not model\nthe radial pulsations but focus on the interior structure of Cepheids, which\ninvolves an interior convective shell and a convective envelope. We develop a\nnew statistical analysis to examine overshooting in this inner convection zone.\nUsing the extreme value theory, we find that overshooting above the convective\nshell fills the space between these convectively unstable layers. We develop a\nnew statistical analysis that provides a clearer picture of how overshooting\nfills this layer, and also allows us to formulate a detailed comparison between\novershooting above and below the convective shell. Our analysis effectively\ndecomposes the overshooting layer into two layers: a weak and a strong\novershooting layer. Statistically, this is accomplished by decomposing the\nstrongly non-Gaussian probability density function into a mixture of Gamma\ndistributions. Using our mixture model, we show that the ratio of overshooting\nlengths above and below the convective shell depends directly on the radial\nextent of the convective shell as well as its depth in the star. We propose a\nnew form for the diffusion coefficient, which addresses the need for\noverlapping overshooting layers between convective shells.

Our non-asymptotic state evolution\ntheory captures Gaussian fluctuations in first-layer weights and concentration\nin deeper-layer weights, and remains valid for non-Gaussian features.\n  Our theory differs from existing neural tangent kernel (NTK), mean-field (MF)\ntheories and tensor program (TP) in several key aspects.

Second, our theory allows weights to evolve from\nindividual initializations beyond the lazy training regime, whereas NTK and MF\nare either frozen at or only weakly sensitive to initialization, and TP relies\non special initialization schemes. Third, our theory characterizes both\ntraining and generalization errors for general multi-layer neural networks\nbeyond the uniform convergence regime, whereas existing theories study\ngeneralization almost exclusively in two-layer settings.\n  As a statistical application, we show that vanilla gradient descent can be\naugmented to yield consistent estimates of the generalization error at each\niteration, which can be used to guide early stopping and hyperparameter tuning.\nAs a further theoretical implication, we show that despite model\nmisspecification, the model learned by gradient descent retains the structure\nof a single-index function with an effective signal determined by a linear\ncombination of the true signal and the initialization.",

This paper therefore proposes a novel method, so-called CubeDAgger,\nwhich improves robustness while reducing dynamic stability violations by making\nthree improvements to a baseline method, EnsembleDAgger. The first improvement\nadds a regularization to explicitly activate the threshold for deciding the\nsupervision timing.

Previous works have predominantly focused on either heavy or\npersistent flows, with limited attention given to PS flows. Although some\nrecent studies pay attention to PS flows, they struggle to establish an\nobjective criterion due to insufficient data-driven observations, resulting in\nreduced accuracy. In this paper, we define a new criterion \"anomaly boundary\"\nto distinguish PS flows from regular flows. Specifically, a flow whose\npersistence exceeds a threshold will be protected, while a protected flow with\na density lower than a threshold is reported as a PS flow. We then introduce\nPSSketch, a high-precision layered sketch to find PS flows. PSSketch employs\nvariable-length bitwise counters, where the first layer tracks the frequency\nand persistence of all flows, and the second layer protects potential PS flows\nand records overflow counts from the first layer. Some optimizations have also\nbeen implemented to reduce memory consumption further and improve accuracy. The\nexperiments show that PSSketch reduces memory consumption by an order of\nmagnitude compared to the strawman solution combined with existing work.\nCompared with SOTA solutions for finding PS flows, it outperforms up to 2.94x\nin F1 score and reduces ARE by 1-2 orders of magnitude. Meanwhile, PSSketch\nachieves a higher throughput than these solutions.",

We propose CCCVAE, a novel variational\nautoencoder framework that incorporates CCC signals into single-cell\nrepresentation learning. By leveraging a communication-aware kernel derived\nfrom ligand-receptor interactions and a sparse Gaussian process, CCCVAE encodes\nbiologically informed priors into the latent space. Unlike conventional VAEs\nthat treat each cell independently, CCCVAE encourages latent embeddings to\nreflect both transcriptional similarity and intercellular signaling context.\nEmpirical results across four scRNA-seq datasets show that CCCVAE improves\nclustering performance, achieving higher evaluation scores than standard VAE\nbaselines.

Substantial efforts have been made to integrate local\ndifferential privacy (LDP) into the system to achieve a strict privacy\nguarantee. However, existing methods fail to take practical issues into account\nby merely perturbing each sample with the same mechanism while each client may\nhave their own privacy preferences on privacy-sensitive information (PSI),\nwhich is not uniformly distributed across the raw data. In such a case,\nexcessive privacy protection from private-insensitive information can\nadditionally introduce unnecessary noise, which may degrade the model\nperformance. In this work, we study the PSI within data and develop FedRE, that\ncan simultaneously achieve robustness and effectiveness benefits with LDP\nprotection. More specifically, we first define PSI with regard to the privacy\npreferences of each client. Then, we optimize the LDP by allocating less\nprivacy budget to gradients with higher PSI in a layer-wise manner, thus\nproviding a stricter privacy guarantee for PSI. Furthermore, to mitigate the\nperformance degradation caused by LDP, we design a parameter aggregation\nmechanism based on the distribution of the perturbed information.

    "abstract": "Mixed Precision Quantization (MPQ) has become an essential technique for\noptimizing neural network by determining the optimal bitwidth per layer.\nExisting MPQ methods, however, face a major hurdle: they require a\ncomputationally expensive search for quantization policies on large-scale\ndatasets. To resolve this issue, we introduce a novel approach that first\nsearches for quantization policies on small datasets and then generalizes them\nto large-scale datasets. This approach simplifies the process, eliminating the\nneed for large-scale quantization fine-tuning and only necessitating model\nweight adjustment. Our method is characterized by three key techniques:\nsharpness-aware minimization for enhanced quantization generalization, implicit\ngradient direction alignment to handle gradient conflicts among different\noptimization objectives, and an adaptive perturbation radius to accelerate\noptimization. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results validate our\napproach. Using the CIFAR10 dataset (just 0.5\\% the size of ImageNet training\ndata) for MPQ policy search, we achieved equivalent accuracy on ImageNet with a\nsignificantly lower computational cost, while improving efficiency by up to\n150% over the baselines.",

    "abstract": "One use case of ``physics-informed neural networks'' (PINNs) is solution\nreconstruction, which aims to estimate the full-field state of a physical\nsystem from sparse measurements. Parameterized governing equations of the\nsystem are used in tandem with the measurements to regularize the regression\nproblem. However, in real-world solution reconstruction problems, the\nparameterized governing equation may be inconsistent with the physical\nphenomena that give rise to the measurement data. We show that due to assuming\nconsistency between the true and parameterized physics, PINNs-based approaches\nmay fail to satisfy three basic criteria of interpretability, robustness, and\ndata consistency. As we argue, these criteria ensure that (i) the quality of\nthe reconstruction can be assessed, (ii) the reconstruction does not depend\nstrongly on the choice of physics loss, and (iii) that in certain situations,\nthe physics parameters can be uniquely recovered. In the context of elasticity\nand heat transfer, we demonstrate how standard formulations of the physics loss\nand techniques for constraining the solution to respect the measurement data\nlead to different ``constraint forces\" -- which we define as additional source\nterms arising from the constraints -- and that these constraint forces can\nsignificantly influence the reconstructed solution. To avoid the potentially\nsubstantial influence of the choice of physics loss and method of constraint\nenforcement on the reconstructed solution, we propose the ``explicit constraint\nforce method'' (ECFM) to gain control of the source term introduced by the\nconstraint. We then show that by satisfying the criteria of interpretability,\nrobustness, and data consistency, this approach leads to more predictable and\ncustomizable reconstructions from noisy measurement data, even when the\nparameterization of the missing physics is inconsistent with the measured\nsystem.",

Third, we fine-tune the LLaMA3-8B\nmodel for crash severity inference, demonstrating superior performance over\nbaseline approaches, including zero-shot, zero-shot with chain-of-thought\nprompting, and few-shot learning, with multiple models (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini,\nLLaMA3-70B). Finally, we employ a gradient-based explainability technique to\nelucidate model decisions at both the individual crash level and across broader\nrisk factor dimensions. This interpretability mechanism enhances transparency\nand enables targeted road safety interventions by providing deeper insights\ninto the most influential factors.",

SOP is driven by asymmetric intermolecular\ninteractions; however, the design of polar molecules for the improvement of\ndipole orientation is limited. In this study, we developed SOP molecules with\nhigh structural asymmetry by introducing multiple fluoroalkyl groups into a\npolar molecule. The developed polar molecules exhibited high dipole orientation\ndegrees in vacuum-deposited films and achieved a high surface potential growth\nrate relative to the film thickness, over -350 mV nm-1, which is a record high\nfor the reported compounds.

    "abstract": "Optical spectroscopies provide a powerful tool for harnessing light-matter\ninteractions for unraveling complex electronic features such as the flat bands\nand nontrivial topologies of materials. These insights are crucial for the\ndevelopment and optimization of optoelectronic devices, including solar cells,\nlight-emitting diodes, and photodetectors, where device performance is closely\nconnected with the nature of the underlying electronic spectrum. Realistic\nmodeling of tensor optical responses in materials, which are computationally\nquite demanding, however, remains challenging. Here we introduce the Tensorial\nSpectra Equivariant Neural Network (TSENN), which is a equivariant graph neural\nnetwork architecture that maps crystal structures directly to their full\nphoton-frequency-dependent optical tensors. By encoding the isotropic\nsequential scalar components along with the anisotropic sequential tensor\ncomponents into l = 0 and l = 2 spherical tensor components, TSENN ensures\nsymmetry-aware predictions that are consistent with the constraints of\ncrystalline symmetries of materials. Trained on a dataset of\nfrequency-dependent permittivity tensors of 1,432 bulk semiconductors computed\nusing first-principles methods, our model achieves a mean absolute error (MAE)\nof 21.181 millifarads per meter (mF/m), demonstrating its potential for\nefficient modeling of other related properties such as the optical\nconductivities.

    "abstract": "The Segment Anything Model (SAM) is a popular vision foundation model;\nhowever, its high computational and memory demands make deployment on\nresource-constrained devices challenging. While Post-Training Quantization\n(PTQ) is a practical approach for reducing computational overhead, existing PTQ\nmethods rely on fixed bit-width quantization, leading to suboptimal accuracy\nand efficiency. To address this limitation, we propose Mix-QSAM, a\nmixed-precision PTQ framework for SAM. First, we introduce a layer-wise\nimportance score, derived using Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, to quantify\neach layer's contribution to the model's output. Second, we introduce\ncross-layer synergy, a novel metric based on causal mutual information, to\ncapture dependencies between adjacent layers. This ensures that highly\ninterdependent layers maintain similar bit-widths, preventing abrupt precision\nmismatches that degrade feature propagation and numerical stability. Using\nthese metrics, we formulate an Integer Quadratic Programming (IQP) problem to\ndetermine optimal bit-width allocation under model size and bit-operation\nconstraints, assigning higher precision to critical layers while minimizing\nbit-width in less influential layers. Experimental results demonstrate that\nMix-QSAM consistently outperforms existing PTQ methods on instance segmentation\nand object detection tasks, achieving up to 20% higher average precision under\n6-bit and 4-bit mixed-precision settings, while maintaining computational\nefficiency.",

    "abstract": "Learning bimanual manipulation is challenging due to its high dimensionality\nand tight coordination required between two arms. Eye-in-hand imitation\nlearning, which uses wrist-mounted cameras, simplifies perception by focusing\non task-relevant views. However, collecting diverse demonstrations remains\ncostly, motivating the need for scalable data augmentation. While prior work\nhas explored visual augmentation in single-arm settings, extending these\napproaches to bimanual manipulation requires generating viewpoint-consistent\nobservations across both arms and producing corresponding action labels that\nare both valid and feasible. In this work, we propose Diffusion for COordinated\nDual-arm Data Augmentation (D-CODA), a method for offline data augmentation\ntailored to eye-in-hand bimanual imitation learning that trains a diffusion\nmodel to synthesize novel, viewpoint-consistent wrist-camera images for both\narms while simultaneously generating joint-space action labels. It employs\nconstrained optimization to ensure that augmented states involving\ngripper-to-object contacts adhere to constraints suitable for bimanual\ncoordination. We evaluate D-CODA on 5 simulated and 3 real-world tasks. Our\nresults across 2250 simulation trials and 300 real-world trials demonstrate\nthat it outperforms baselines and ablations, showing its potential for scalable\ndata augmentation in eye-in-hand bimanual manipulation.
