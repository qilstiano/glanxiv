    "abstract": "This paper investigates the impact of banking competition on interest rates\nfor household consumption loans in the Euro Area from 2014 to 2020. Utilizing a\npanel data regression approach, we analyze how various factors, including local\nbanking competition, influence the interest rates set by banks across 13\nEuro-area countries. Our key independent variable, local banking competition,\nis measured by the number of commercial bank branches per 100,000 adults.\nControl variables include the ECB interest rate, euro exchange rate, real GDP\ngrowth rate, inflation rate, unemployment rate, bank business volumes, and\ncountry risk. We address potential endogeneity and heterogeneity biases and\nemploy both Fixed Effects and Hausman-Taylor models to ensure robust results.\nOur findings indicate that higher local banking competition is associated with\na slight increase in interest rates for household loans. Additionally, factors\nsuch as ECB interest rate, country risk, and euro appreciation significantly\naffect interest rates. The results offer insights into how competitive dynamics\nin the banking sector influence borrowing costs for households, providing\nvaluable implications for policymakers and financial institutions in the Euro\nArea.",

Accurate race car dynamics modeling is\nessential for capturing and predicting future states like position,\norientation, and velocity.

In this paper, we\nintroduce the Deep Kernel-based Multi-task Gaussian Process (DKMGP), which\nleverages the structure of a variational multi-task and multi-step Gaussian\nprocess model enhanced with deep kernel learning for vehicle dynamics modeling.\nUnlike existing single-step methods, DKMGP performs multi-step corrections with\nan adaptive correction horizon (ACH) algorithm that dynamically adjusts to\nvarying driving conditions. To validate and evaluate the proposed DKMGP method,\nwe compare the model performance with DKL-SKIP and a well-tuned single-track\nmodel, using high-speed dynamics data (exceeding 230kmph) collected from a\nfull-scale Indy race car during the Indy Autonomous Challenge held at the Las\nVegas Motor Speedway at CES 2024.

Here, we introduce a fully neural Iterative and Parallel Reasoning\nMechanism (IPRM) that combines two distinct forms of computation -- iterative\nand parallel -- to better address complex VQA scenarios. Specifically, IPRM's\n\"iterative\" computation facilitates compositional step-by-step reasoning for\nscenarios wherein individual operations need to be computed, stored, and\nrecalled dynamically (e.g. when computing the query \"determine the color of pen\nto the left of the child in red t-shirt sitting at the white table\").\nMeanwhile, its \"parallel\" computation allows for the simultaneous exploration\nof different reasoning paths and benefits more robust and efficient execution\nof operations that are mutually independent (e.g. when counting individual\ncolors for the query: \"determine the maximum occurring color amongst all\nt-shirts\"). We design IPRM as a lightweight and fully-differentiable neural\nmodule that can be conveniently applied to both transformer and non-transformer\nvision-language backbones.

We take a bottom-up approach\nin deriving FAST-Splat, dismantling the limitations of closed-set semantic\ndistillation to enable open-set (open-vocabulary) semantic distillation.\nUltimately, this key approach enables FAST-Splat to provide precise semantic\nobject localization results, even when prompted with ambiguous user-provided\nnatural-language queries. Further, by exploiting the explicit form of the\nGaussian Splatting scene representation to the fullest extent, FAST-Splat\nretains the remarkable training and rendering speeds of Gaussian Splatting.\nPrecisely, while existing semantic Gaussian Splatting methods distill semantics\ninto a separate neural field or utilize neural models for dimensionality\nreduction, FAST-Splat directly augments each Gaussian with specific semantic\ncodes, preserving the training, rendering, and memory-usage advantages of\nGaussian Splatting over neural field methods. These Gaussian-specific semantic\ncodes, together with a hash-table, enable semantic similarity to be measured\nwith open-vocabulary user prompts and further enable FAST-Splat to respond with\nunambiguous semantic object labels and $3$D masks, unlike prior methods. In\nexperiments, we demonstrate that FAST-Splat is 6x to 8x faster to train,\nachieves between 18x to 51x faster rendering speeds, and requires about 6x\nsmaller GPU memory, compared to the best-competing semantic Gaussian Splatting\nmethods.

We model a\ncrystalline polymer solid by using highly coarse-grained particles, of which\nsize is comparable to the crystalline layer thickness. One coarse-grained\nparticle consists of multiple subchains, and is much larger than monomers.\nCoarse-grained particles are connected by bonds to form a network structure.\nParticles are connected by soft but ductile bonds, to form a rubber-like\nnetwork. Particles in the crystalline region are connected by hard but brittle\nbonds. Brittle bonds are broken when large deformations are applied. We perform\nuniaxial elongation simulations based on our coarse-grained model. As the\napplied strain increases, crystalline layers are broken into pieces and\nnon-affine and collective motions of broken pieces are observed.

Nevertheless, the intricate and undefined\nformation pathways of twin kHz QPOs present a compelling avenue for\nexploration. This area of study holds great interest as it provides an\nopportunity to derive crucial parameters related to compact stars. Aims:We\nstrives to develop a self-consistent model elucidating the radiation mechanism\nof twin kHz QPOs, subsequently comparing it with observations. Methods: A\nsample of 28 twin kHz QPOs observed from the X-ray binary 4U 1636--53 are used\nto compare with the results of the MCMC calculations according to our model of\nthe radiation mechanism of twin kHz QPOs, which is related to twin MHD waves.\nResults: We obtain twenty-eight groups of parameters of 4U 1636--53 and a tight\nexponential fit between the flux and the temperature of seed photons to Compton\nup-scattering and find that the electron temperature in the corona around the\nneutron star decreases with the increasing temperature of the seed photons.\nConclusions: The origin of twin kHz QPOs can be attributed to dual disturbances\narising from twin MHD waves generated at the innermost radius of an accretion\ndisc.

The observed overscreening occurs because\na significant portion of water polarization directly responds to the graphene\nsurface, in addition to screening the electrostatic interactions between ions\nand charged surfaces. Furthermore, we reveal that this surface-induced\npolarization of interfacial water governs the electric potential distribution\nand EDL capacitance, and can even invert the electrode surface potential\npolarity, overriding the contribution of ions.

Beyond team results, we discuss the hackathon event and\nits hybrid format, which included physical hubs in Toronto, Montreal, San\nFrancisco, Berlin, Lausanne, and Tokyo, alongside a global online hub to enable\nlocal and virtual collaboration. Overall, the event highlighted significant\nimprovements in LLM capabilities since the previous year's hackathon,\nsuggesting continued expansion of LLMs for applications in materials science\nand chemistry research.

    "abstract": "The spectroscopic study of mature giant planets and low mass planets\n(Neptune-like, Earth-like) requires instruments capable of achieving very high\ncontrasts ($10^{-10}-10^{-11}$) at short angular separations. To achieve such\nhigh performance on a real instrument, many limitations must be overcome:\ncomplex component defects (coronagraph, deformable mirror), optical aberrations\nand scattering, mechanical vibrations and drifts, polarization effects, etc.\n  To study the overall impact on a complete system representative of high\ncontrast instruments, we have developed a test bench at Paris Observatory,\ncalled THD2. In this paper, we focus on the polarization effects that are\npresent on the bench which creates differential aberrations between the two\nlinear polarization states. We compare the recorded beam positions of the two\npolarization states with the predicted from the Goos-H\\\"anchen and\nImbert-Fedorov effects, both of which cause spatial shifts and angular\ndeviations of the beam, longitudinal and transverse respectively. Although\nthese effects have already been studied in the literature from the optical and\nquantum mechanical points of view, their measurement and impact on a complete\noptical bench are rather rare, although they are crucial for high-contrast\ninstruments.\n  After describing the Goos-H\\\"anchen and Imbert-Fedorov effects and estimating\ntheir amplitude on the THD2 bench, we present the protocol we used to measure\nthese effects of polarization on the light beam. We compare predictions and\nmeasurements and we conclude on the most limiting elements on our bench\npolarization-wise.",

This, however, typically also increases the lattice temperature of\nthe solar cells significantly. Accordingly, the solar cells subject to high\nconcentration illumination also need to withstand high operating temperatures.\nHaving previously demonstrated the high temperature tolerance of the triple\nhalide perovskite (FA0.8Cs0.2Pb1.02I2.4Br0.6Cl0.02) solar cells, here the hot\ncarrier relaxation dynamics are studied in these devices using high power\ntransient absorption (TA) measurements. In addition to monitoring TA spectra\nobtained at different time delays, the thermalization mechanisms of hot\ncarriers is mapped with power dependent TA to extract the carrier cooling time\nin this system under in-operando conditions at various bias conditions that\nreflect the Jsc, Vmax and Voc of these structures, and subsequently deconvolve\nthe underlying physics of carrier relaxation; as well as track the dynamics of\nthe thermalization close to working conditions of the solar cells. These\nmeasurements uncover a complex interaction of hot carrier thermalization\ninvolving the temporal carrier density, transport, and extraction, and apparent\nnon-equivalent contributions with respect to non-equilibrium photogenerated\nelectrons and holes in these metal halide perovskite solar cell architectures.",

The present study\naims to provide an understanding of the interaction between five different\nmetal precipitates (molybdenum [Mo], ruthenium [Ru], palladium [Pd], technetium\n[Tc], and rhodium [Rh]) and the Xe fission gas atoms in UO2, by using density\nfunctional theory (DFT) in combination with the Hubbard U correction to compute\nthe formation energies involved. All DFT+U calculations were performed with\noccupation matrix control to ensure antiferromagnetic ordering of UO2. The\ncalculated formation and binding energies of the Xe and solid fission products\nin the NMP reveal that these metal precipitates form stable pair structures\nwith Xe.

Since this Ph.D. Thesis is a symbiosis between\ntheoretical and experimental results, an experimental investigation of\ncorrelated phenomena was carried out for molecular conductors of the\n(TMTTF)$_2$X family, where TMTTF is the base molecule\ntetramethyltetrathiafulvalene and X a monovalent counter-anion such as PF$_6$,\nSbF$_6$, or AsF$_6$. Such strongly correlated electron systems are considered\nsuitable ones for the exploration of Mott insulating phase, charge-ordering,\nspin-Peierls, and superconductivity. In particular, the investigation of a\npossible multiferroic character in these salts was performed via quasi-static\n(low-frequency) dielectric constant $\\varepsilon'$ measurements as a function\nof temperature where a maximum in $\\varepsilon'$ as a function of temperature\nwas observed at the corresponding charge-ordering temperature for both\nhydrogenated and 97.5% deuterated (TMTTF)$_2$SbF$_6$ salts. Furthermore, Raman\nmeasurements were performed on the 97.5% deuterated (TMTTF)$_2$PF$_6$, showing\na possible magneto-optical effect on the $\\nu_4(a_g)$ vibrational mode of the\nTMTTF molecule. Yet, fluorescence measurements demonstrated that the\nfully-hydrogenated (TMTTF)$_2$AsF$_6$ presents an expressive fluorescence\nbackground, which is roughly five orders of magnitude lower than that for the\n97.5% deuterated variant of (TMTTF)$_2$PF$_6$.",

We also consider\nusing simultaneous perturbation (inspired by SPSA) as a gradient subroutine:\nhere finite difference can lead to a more precise estimate of the ground state\nbut uses more calls, whereas simultaneous perturbation can converge quicker but\nmay be less precise in the later stages. Finally, we also study the quantum\nnatural gradient algorithm: we implement this method for 1-dimensional\nFermi-Hubbard systems, and find that whilst it can reach a lower energy with\nfewer iterations, this improvement is typically lost when taking total function\ncalls into account.

For each category, an in-depth investigation and review of\nthe representative methods are provided, covering background, challenges,\nproblem formalisation, solutions, and limitations. Besides, existing real-world\napplications empowered by FCL are reviewed, indicating the current progress and\npotential of FCL in diverse application domains.

One quantity which is important in\nestablishing this rate is the spectral gap of a random quantum ensemble. In\nthis work we establish a new bound on the spectral gap of the t-th moment of a\none-dimensional brickwork architecture on N qudits. This bound is independent\nof both t and N, provided t does not exceed the qudit dimension q. We also show\nthat the bound is nearly optimal. The improved spectral gaps gives large\nimprovements to the constant factors in known results on the approximate\nt-design depths of the 1D brickwork, of generic circuit architectures, and of\nspecially-constructed architectures which scramble in depth O(log N). We\nmoreover show that the spectral gap gives the dominant epsilon-dependence of\nthe t-design depth at small epsilon. Our spectral gap bound is obtained by\nbounding the N-site 1D brickwork architecture by the spectra of 3-site\noperators. We then exploit a block-triangular hierarchy and a global symmetry\nin these operators in order to efficiently bound them. The technical methods\nused are a qualitatively different approach for bounding spectral gaps and and\nhave little in common with previous techniques.",

    "abstract": "One of the future plans at Jefferson Lab is running electron scattering\nexperiments with large acceptance detectors at luminosities $>\n10^{37}cm^{-2}s^{-1}$. These experiments allow the measurements of the Double\nDeeply Virtual Compton Scattering (DDVCS) reaction, an important physics\nprocess in the formalism of Generalized Parton Distributions, which has never\nbeen measured because of its small cross-section. The luminosity upgrade of\nCLAS12 or the SOLID detector makes Jefferson Lab a unique place to measure\nDDVCS. One of the important components of these high luminosity detectors is a\ntracking system that can withstand high rates of $\\approx 1MHz/cm^{2}$. The\nrecently developed Micro-Resistive Well (uRWELL) detector technology is a\npromising option for such a tracking detector by combining good position\nresolutions, low material budget with simple mechanical construction, and low\nproduction costs. In this proceeding, we will discuss recent developments and\nstudies with uRWELL detectors at Jefferson Lab for future upgrades of the\nCLAS12 detector to study the DDVCS reaction.",

    "abstract": "Addressing data integrity challenges, such as unlearning the effects of data\npoisoning after model training, is necessary for the reliable deployment of\nmachine learning models. State-of-the-art influence functions, such as EK-FAC,\noften fail to accurately attribute abnormal model behavior to the specific\npoisoned training data responsible for the data poisoning attack. In addition,\ntraditional unlearning algorithms often struggle to effectively remove the\ninfluence of poisoned samples, particularly when only a few affected examples\ncan be identified. To address these challenge, we introduce $\\Delta$-Influence,\na novel approach that leverages influence functions to trace abnormal model\nbehavior back to the responsible poisoned training data using as little as just\none poisoned test example. $\\Delta$-Influence applies data transformations that\nsever the link between poisoned training data and compromised test points\nwithout significantly affecting clean data. This allows $\\Delta$-Influence to\ndetect large negative shifts in influence scores following data\ntransformations, a phenomenon we term as influence collapse, thereby accurately\nidentifying poisoned training data. Unlearning this subset, e.g. through\nretraining, effectively eliminates the data poisoning. We validate our method\nacross three vision-based poisoning attacks and three datasets, benchmarking\nagainst four detection algorithms and five unlearning strategies. We show that\n$\\Delta$-Influence consistently achieves the best unlearning across all\nsettings, showing the promise of influence functions for corrective unlearning.\nOur code is publicly available at:\n\\url{https://github.com/andyisokay/delta-influence}",

The Inert Doublet Model is a two-Higgs-doublet\nmodel variant with an unbroken discrete $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, featuring new\nstable scalar particles that can serve as dark matter candidates. Current dark\nmatter data constrain the phenomenologically viable parameter space of the IDM\nand render certain collider signatures elusive due to tiny couplings.

Both voters\nand alternatives lie on the line metric, and the goal is to minimize a social\ncost function based on metric distances. While the distances to committee\nmembers fully determine the social cost, voting rules only have access to the\nordinal preference list of each voter. The distortion of a voting rule is the\nworst-case ratio between the cost of the selected committee and the cost of the\noptimal one, over all consistent distance metrics. Extending distortion to\nmulti-winner elections requires defining how a voter's cost is aggregated over\nthe committee. Caragiannis et al. (2022) studied $q$-cost, where the cost is\ndefined as the distance to the voter's $q$th closest committee member. In this\nwork, we focus on the additive cost, where a voter's cost is the sum of their\ndistances to all committee members. The overall social cost is either\nutilitarian (sum of individual costs) or egalitarian (maximum individual cost).\n  We introduce a new voting rule, the Polar Comparison Rule, and analyze its\ndistortion for the utilitarian additive cost. We show that it achieves a\ndistortion of roughly $7/3$ for any committee size $k$. More specifically, for\n$k = 2$ and $k = 3$, we establish tight bounds of $1 + \\sqrt{2} \\approx 2.41$\nand $7/3 \\approx 2.33$, respectively. Moreover, we provide lower bounds that\ndepend on the parity of $k$, and analyze both small and large committee sizes.\nFinally, we study the egalitarian additive cost and analyze the distortion\nbounds in multi-winner elections.",

    "abstract": "Reliably predicting nuclear properties across the entire chart of isotopes is\nimportant for applications ranging from nuclear astrophysics to superheavy\nscience to nuclear technology. To this day, however, all the theoretical models\nthat can scale at the level of the chart of isotopes remain semi\nphenomenological. Because they are fitted locally, their predictive power can\nvary significantly; different versions of the same theory provide different\npredictions. Bayesian model mixing takes advantage of such imperfect models to\nbuild a local mixture of a set of models to make improved predictions. Earlier\nattempts to use Bayesian model mixing for mass table calculations relied on\nmodels treated at single-reference energy density functional level, which fail\nto capture some of the correlations caused by configuration mixing or the\nrestoration of broken symmetries. In this study we have applied Bayesian model\nmixing techniques within a multi-reference energy density functional (MR-EDF)\nframework. We considered predictions of two-particle separation energies from\nparticle number projection or angular momentum projection with four different\nenergy density functionals - a total of eight different MR-EDF models. We used\na hierarchical Bayesian stacking framework with a Dirichlet prior distribution\nover weights together with an inverse log-ratio transform to enable positive\ncorrelations between different models. We found that Bayesian model mixing\nprovide significantly improved predictions over results from single MR-EDF\ncalculations.",

This\nfifth paper of the ROME (Radio Observations of Magnetized Exoplanets) series\npresents the results of a targeted mini-survey of nine white dwarfs within 25\npc without known stellar mass companions in search of radio emissions generated\nby magnetic interactions between white dwarfs and their planetary remnants.\nThis $\\sim$5 GHz Arecibo radio telescope survey achieved mJy-level sensitivity\nover $<$1 s integration times.

It is also the most extensive and sensitive radio\nsurvey for intrinsic coronal emissions from apparently isolated white dwarfs.\nThe study of radio emissions from white dwarf systems may present a new means\nto detect and measure DC and DQ magnetic fields, search for white dwarf\ncoronae, characterize the density and spatial distribution of white dwarf\nmagnetospheric plasma, characterize the dynamical and electrical properties of\nplanetary cores, and offer new constraints on the modeling of double degenerate\nmerger events.",

    "abstract": "Critical systems host nontrivial entanglement structure that is generally\nsensitive to additional couplings. In the present work, we study the effect of\nweak measurements on the entanglement Hamiltonian of massless free fermions\nwhich are prepared in their critical ground state. While the power-law decaying\ncorrelation and logarithmic growing entanglement entropy have been observed as\ntypical signatures of quantum criticality after the weak measurement, in this\nwork we show that the conformal symmetry is lost and the entanglement\nHamiltonian generally becomes gapped for arbitrary small measurement strength.\nTo reveal this unconventional entanglement structure, we consider a\nfield-theory description that allows us to establish an analytic mapping\nbetween the entanglement Hamiltonians before and after the weak measurements.\nFrom this mapping, we find that although the measurements lead to a significant\nmodification of the entanglement spectrum, the real-space distribution of the\neigenfunction of the kernel of entanglement Hamiltonian is unchanged, which is\nresponsible for the coexistence of a gapped entanglement Hamiltonian and the\nlogarithmic entanglement entropy. Moreover, as the mapping works for\narbitrarily many disjoint intervals, the multi-interval entanglement entropy\nalso exhibits the same scaling behavior as the critical ground state, and\nshares the same effective central charge with the single-interval case. We\nnumerically demonstrate these field-theory results on a lattice model, where\nthe entanglement Hamiltonian after weak measurements exhibits the typical\nsignature of a finite gap and becomes long-ranged even in the single-interval\ncase. This is distinct from the critical ground state, where the entanglement\nHamiltonian for a single interval is gapless and local.",

We combine observations from the\nJWST NIRSpec Integral Field Spectrograph (IFS) with archival VLT VIMOS\nlong-slit spectroscopic data, as part of the GA-NIFS project. We perform a\nmulti-component kinematic decomposition of the UV and optical line profiles to\nderive the physical properties of the absorbing and emitting gas in GS133. Our\nkinematic decomposition reveals two distinct components in the optical lines.\nThe first component likely traces a rotating disk with a dynamical mass of 2e10\nMsun. The second component corresponds to a galaxy-wide, bi-conical outflow,\nwith a velocity of 1000 km/s and an extension of 3 kpc. The UV absorption lines\nshow two outflow components, with bulk velocities v_out = -900 km/s and -1900\nkm/s, respectively. This characterises GS133 as a mini-BAL system. Balmer\nabsorption lines with similar velocities are tentatively detected in the\nNIRSpec spectrum. Both photoionisation models and outflow energetics suggest\nthat the ejected absorbing gas is located at 1-10 kpc from the AGN. We use 3D\ngas kinematic modelling to infer the orientation of the [O III] bi-conical\noutflow, and find that a portion of the emitting gas resides along our line of\nsight, suggesting that [O III] and absorbing gas clouds are partially mixed in\nthe outflow. The derived mass-loading factor (i.e. the mass outflow rate\ndivided by the SFR) of 1-10, and the kinetic coupling efficiency (i.e. the\nkinetic power divided by LAGN) of 0.1-1% per cent suggest that the outflow in\nGS133 provides significant feedback on galactic scales.",

    "abstract": "Sport climbing is an athletic discipline comprised of three sub-disciplines\n-- lead climbing, bouldering, and speed climbing.

The year 2020 marked the first inclusion of sport climbing in the\nOlympic Games. While this decision was met with excitement from the climbing\ncommunity, it was not without controversy. The International Olympic Committee\nhad allocated one set of medals for the entire sport, necessitating the\ncombination of sub-disciplines into one competition. As a result, athletes who\nspecialized in lead and bouldering were forced to train and compete in speed\nfor the first time in their careers. One such athlete was Tomoa Narasaki, a\nWorld Champion boulderer, who introduced a new method of approaching the speed\nevent. This approach, deemed the Tomoa Skip (TS), was subsequently adopted by\nmany of the top speed climbers. Concurrently, speed records fell rapidly (from\n5.48s in 2017 to 4.90s in 2023). Speed climbing involves ascending a 15m wall\ncontaining the same pattern of obstacles. Thus, records can be compared across\ntime. In this paper we investigate the effect of the TS on speed climbing by\nanswering two questions: (1) Did the TS result in a decrease in speed times?\nand (2) Do climbers who utilize the TS show less consistency? The success of\nthe TS highlights the potential of collaboration between different disciplines\nof sport, showing athletes of diverse backgrounds may contribute to the\nevolution of competition.",

Prior methods for randomized basket\ntrials required baskets to have the same sample and effect sizes.

Prior work\nshowed that finding the alloy composition with the highest melting temperature\nrequired testing 15 alloy compositions, and establishing the melting\ntemperature for each composition took, on average, 4 simulations. By developing\na workflow that utilizes the FAIR data in the nanoHUB database, we reduced the\nnumber of simulations per composition to one and found the alloy with the\nlowest melting temperature testing only three compositions.

It is one of the key research areas in molecular\nmachine learning and computational drug discovery. Recently, message-passing\ngraph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a novel method to learn\ndifferentiable features directly from molecular graphs. While such techniques\nhold great promise, further investigations are needed to clarify if and when\nthey indeed manage to definitively outcompete classical molecular\nfeaturisations such as extended-connectivity fingerprints (ECFPs) and\nphysicochemical-descriptor vectors (PDVs). We systematically explore and\nfurther develop classical and graph-based molecular featurisation methods for\ntwo important tasks: molecular property prediction, in particular, quantitative\nstructure-activity relationship (QSAR) prediction, and the largely unexplored\nchallenge of activity-cliff (AC) prediction. We first give a technical\ndescription and critical analysis of PDVs, ECFPs and message-passing GNNs, with\na focus on graph isomorphism networks (GINs). We then conduct a rigorous\ncomputational study to compare the performance of PDVs, ECFPs and GINs for QSAR\nand AC-prediction. Following this, we mathematically describe and\ncomputationally evaluate a novel twin neural network model for AC-prediction.\nWe further introduce an operation called substructure pooling for the\nvectorisation of structural fingerprints as a natural counterpart to graph\npooling in GNN architectures. We go on to propose Sort & Slice, a simple\nsubstructure-pooling technique for ECFPs that robustly outperforms hash-based\nfolding at molecular property prediction. Finally, we outline two ideas for\nfuture research: (i) a graph-based self-supervised learning strategy to make\nclassical molecular featurisations trainable, and (ii) trainable\nsubstructure-pooling via differentiable self-attention.",

    "abstract": "Many known rocky exoplanets are so highly irradiated that their dayside\nsurfaces are molten, and `silicate atmospheres', composed of rock-forming\nelements, are generated above these lava pools. The compositions of these `lava\nplanet' atmospheres are of great interest because they must be linked to the\ncomposition of the underlying rocky interiors. It may be possible to\ninvestigate these atmospheres, either by detecting them directly via emission\nspectroscopy or by observing the dust tails which trail the low mass\n`catastrophically evaporating planets'. In this work, we develop a simple\nchemical model of the lava pool--atmosphere system under mass loss, to study\nits evolution. Mass loss can occur both into space and from the day to the\nnightside. We show that the system reaches a steady state, where the material\nin the escaping atmosphere has the same composition as that melted into the\nlava pool from the mantle. We show that the catastrophically evaporating\nplanets are likely to be in this evolved state. This means that the composition\nof their dust tails is likely to be a direct trace of the composition of the\nmantle material that is melted into the lava pool. We further show that, due to\nthe strength of day-to-nightside atmospheric transport, this evolved state may\neven apply to relatively high-mass planets (>1 Earth Mass). Moreover, the low\npressure of evolved atmospheres implies that non-detections may not be due to\nthe total lack of an atmosphere.

After applying the blow-up transformation, we obtain a system\nof PDEs which can be studied in local coordinate charts. Importantly, the\nblow-up procedure resolves a spectral degeneracy in which continuous spectrum\nalong the entire negative real axis is 'pushed back' so as to create a spectral\ngap in the linearisation about particular steady states which arise within the\nso-called entry and exit charts. This makes it possible to extend slow-type\ninvariant manifolds into and out of a neighbourhood of the singular point using\ncenter manifold theory, in a manner which is conceptually analogous to the\nestablished approach in the ODE setting. We expect that the approach can be\nadapted and applied to the study of dynamic bifurcations in PDEs in a wide\nvariety of different contexts.",

However, these type of\nsimulations are performed by solving the field-equations of QUMOND and already\nbecome non-practical for star cluster masses at around 5000 Msun. Nearby star\nclusters have masses of 1000 Msun or ~1000 particles and less/fewer and can\ncurrently not be simulated reliably in field-theoretical formulations of MOND.\nIn order to handle particle numbers below the QUMOND-limit the star cluster is\nsimulated in Milgrom-law dynamics (MLD): Milgrom's law is postulated to be\nvalid for discrete systems in vectorial form. In order to suppress the\nNewtonisation of compact subsystems in the star cluster the gravitational force\nis softened below particle distances of 0.001 pc ~206 AU. Thus, MLD can only be\nconsidered as an approximation of a full MOND-theoretical description of\ndiscrete systems which are internally in the MOND regime. The MLD equations of\nmotion are integrated by the standard Hermite scheme generally applied to\nNewtonian N-body systems, which is extended to solve for the accelerations and\njerks associated with Milgrom's law. It is found that the tidal tails of a\nlow-mass star cluster are populated asymmetrically in the MLD-treatment, very\nsimilar to the QUMOND simulations of the higher-mass star clusters. In the\nMLD-simulations the leading tail hosts up to twice as many members than the\ntrailing arm and the low-mass open star cluster dissolves approximately 25%\nfaster than in the respective Newtonian case.",

Attention mechanism has become an essential\ncomponent of foundation models, due to their superb capability of capturing\ncorrelations in a sequence. However, attention results in quadratic complexity\nin memory and compute as the context length grows. Although many fusion-based\nexact attention acceleration algorithms have been developed for\ndatacenter-grade GPUs and accelerators leveraging multi-core parallelism and\ndata locality, yet it remains a significant challenge to accelerate attention\non resource-constrained edge neural accelerators with limited compute units and\nstringent on-chip caches. In this paper, we propose a scheme for exact\nattention inference acceleration on memory-constrained edge accelerators, by\nparallelizing the utilization of heterogeneous compute units, i.e., vector\nprocessing units and matrix processing units. Our method involves scheduling\nworkloads onto these different compute units in a multi-tiered tiling scheme to\nprocess tiled vector workloads and matrix workloads in attention as two\nstreams, respecting the workload dependencies. We search for tiling factors to\nmaximize the parallelization of both compute units while considering I/O\noverhead, and propose a proactive cache overwrite strategy to avoid undesirable\ncache spills in reality. Extensive results based on open-sourced simulation\nframeworks show up to 2.75x speedup and 54% reduction in energy consumption as\ncompared to the state-of-the-art attention fusion method (FLAT) in the edge\ncomputing scenario. Further experiments on a real-world edge neural processing\nunit demonstrate speedup of up to 1.76x for attention as compared to FLAT,\nwithout affecting model output accuracy.",

Assuming that no BNS was\ndetected during O4 until the end of 2024, we present updated GW BNS (NSBH)\nmerger detection rates: $\\sim 1-9$ ($2-9$) yr$^{-1}$ in O4, and $13-110$\n($18-110$) yr$^{-1}$ in O5.

We explain the extensive\nentanglement growth as a consequence of the peculiar distribution of quantum\njumps in time, which display superpoissonian waiting time distribution\ncharacterised by a bunching of quantum jumps followed by long dark intervals\nwhere no-clicks are detected, akin to the distribution of fluorescence light in\na driven atom.

The complex potential energy landscape (PEL) in CSS\ndisrupts dislocation propagation, leading to spatially dispersed networks.\nNotably, CSS exhibits reduced stair-rod dislocation density compared to RSS,\nhighlighting its superior resistance to irradiation swelling. Localized shear\nstrain causes dislocations to preferentially nucleate in/near Cu-rich regions\nthough their growth is hindered by chemical heterogeneity of the alloy.\nNotably, prolonged irradiation induces slow Cu segregation in the RSS\nstructure, while slowly annihilating pre-existing Cu clusters in CSS\nsimultaneously.

We show that\nlbGRBs, powered by massive accretion disks around black holes (BHs), should be\naccompanied by bright, red kilonovae. In contrast, sbGRBs - if also powered by\nBHs - would produce fainter, red kilonovae, potentially biasing against their\ndetection. However, magnetized hypermassive neutron star (HMNS) remnants that\nprecede BH formation can produce jets with power ($P_{\\rm NS} \\approx\n10^{51}\\,{\\rm erg\\,s^{-1}}$) and Lorentz factor ($\\Gamma>10$), likely\ncompatible with sbGRB observations, and would result in distinctly bluer\nkilonovae, offering a pathway to identifying the sbGRB central engine. Recent\nmodeling by Rastinejad et al. (2024) found luminous red kilonovae consistently\naccompany lbGRBs, supporting lbGRB originating from BH-massive disk systems,\nlikely following a short-lived HMNS phase. The preferential association of\nsbGRBs with comparably luminous kilonovae argues against the BH engine\nhypothesis for sbGRBs, while the bluer hue of these KNe provides additional\nsupport for an HMNS-driven mechanism. Within this framework, BH-NS mergers\nlikely contribute exclusively to the lbGRB population with red kilonovae. Our\nfindings suggest that GW170817 may, in fact, have been an lbGRB to on-axis\nobservers. Finally, we discuss major challenges faced by alternative lbGRB\nprogenitor models, such as white dwarf-NS or white dwarf-BH mergers and\naccretion-induced collapse forming magnetars, which fail to align with observed\nGRB timescales, energies, and kilonova properties.",

In this paper, I will show that for widely considered\ninference settings in complex social systems the train-test paradigm does not\nonly lack a justification but is indeed invalid for any risk estimator,\nincluding counterfactual and causal estimators, with high probability. These\nformal impossibility results highlight a fundamental epistemic issue, i.e.,\nthat for key tasks in modern AI we cannot know whether models are valid under\ncurrent data collection practices. Importantly, this includes variants of both\nrecommender systems and reasoning via large language models, and neither\nna\\\"ive scaling nor limited benchmarks are suited to address this issue.

    "abstract": "We provide a method for constructing many-body scar states in fermionic\nlattice models that incorporate a given type of correlations with one of the\nstates maximizing them over the full Hilbert space. Therefore this state may\nalways be made the ground state by adding such correlations as a \"pairing\npotential\" $\\delta H_0$ to any Hamiltonian $H=H_0+OT$ supporting\ngroup-invariant scars [arXiv:2007.00845]. In case of single-flavour spin-full\nfermions the ground state is a special case of the BCS wavefunction written in\nreal space and invariant under any site index relabelling. For multi-orbital\nfermions this state also resembles BCS but includes higher order terms\ncorresponding to \"pairing\" of more than two fermions. The broad class of\neligible Hamiltonians $H$ is well documented\n[arXiv:2007.00845],[arXiv:2106.10300] and includes many conventional condensed\nmatter interactions. The part of the Hamiltonian $(H_0+\\delta H_0)$ that\ngoverns the exact dynamics of the scar subspace coincides with the BCS\nmean-field Hamiltonian. We therefore show that its BCS ground state and the\nexcitations above it are many-body scars that are dynamically decoupled from\nthe rest of the Hilbert space and thereby protected from thermalization. These\nstates are insensitive to a variety of $OT$ Hamiltonian terms that among others\ninclude interactions and (spin-orbit) hoppings. Our results point out a\nconnection between the fields of superconductivity and weak ergodicity breaking\n(many-body scars) and will hopefully encourage further investigations.

    "abstract": "We perform a comprehensive study of charge excitations in a bilayer electron\nsystem in the presence of the long-range Coulomb interaction (LRC). Our major\npoint is to derive formulae of the LRC that fully respect the bilayer lattice\nstructure. This is an extension of the LRC obtained by Fetter in the\nelectron-gas model 50 years ago and can now be applicable to any electron\ndensity. We then provide general formulae of the charge susceptibility in the\nrandom phase approximation and study them numerically. The charge ordering\ntendency is not found and instead we find two plasmon modes, w_{+} and w_{-}\nmodes. Our second major point is to elucidate their spectral weight\ndistribution and the effect of electron tunneling between the layers. The\nspectral weight of the w_{+-} modes does not have 2pi periodicity along the\nq_{z}c direction. The w_{+} mode loses spectral weight at inplane momentum\nq_{||}=(0,0) at q_{z}c=2n pi with n being integer whereas the w_{-} mode has no\nspectral weight at q_{z}c=0 for any q_{||} but acquires sizable spectral weight\nat q_{z}c=2n pi with n \\ne 0. Both w_{+-} modes are gapped at q_{||}=(0,0).\nWhen q_{z}c is away from 2n pi, the w_{+-} modes show striking behavior. When\nthe intrabilayer hopping t_z is relatively small (large), the w_{-} (w_{+})\nmode becomes gapless at q_{||}=(0,0) whereas the w_{+} (w_{-}) mode retains the\ngap. However, when the interbilayer hopping integral t_{z}' is taken into\naccount, the gapless mode acquires a gap at q_{||}=(0,0) and both w_{+-} modes\nare gapped at any q_{z}c. To highlight the special feature of the LRC, we also\nclarify a difference to the case of a short-range interaction. While the strong\nelectron correlation effects are not included, the present theory captures\navailable data of the charge excitations observed by resonant inelastic x-ray\nscattering for Y-based cuprate superconductors.",

    "abstract": "We present a detailed study of the large-scale shock front in Stephan's\nQuintet, a byproduct of past and ongoing interactions. Using integral-field\nspectroscopy from the new William Herschel Telescope Enhanced Area Velocity\nExplorer (WEAVE), recent 144 MHz observations from the LOFAR Two-metre Sky\nSurvey (LoTSS), and archival data from the Very Large Array and James Webb\nSpace Telescope (JWST), we obtain new measurements of key shock properties and\ndetermine its impact on the system. Harnessing the WEAVE large integral field\nunit's (LIFU) field of view (90 $\\times$ 78 arcsec$^{2}$), spectral resolution\n($R\\sim2500$) and continuous wavelength coverage across the optical band, we\nperform robust emission line modeling and dynamically locate the shock within\nthe multi-phase intergalactic medium (IGM) with higher precision than\npreviously possible. The shocking of the cold gas phase is hypersonic, and\ncomparisons with shock models show that it can readily account for the observed\nemission line ratios. In contrast, we demonstrate that the shock is relatively\nweak in the hot plasma visible in X-rays (with Mach number of $\\mathcal{M} \\sim\n2 - 4$), making it inefficient at producing the relativistic particles needed\nto explain the observed synchrotron emission. Instead, we propose that it has\nled to an adiabatic compression of the medium, which has increased the radio\nluminosity ten-fold. Comparison of the Balmer line-derived extinction map with\nthe molecular gas and hot dust observed with JWST suggests that pre-existing\ndust may have survived the collision, allowing the condensation of H$_{2}$ - a\nkey channel for dissipating the shock energy.",

Although many 1-loop processes, especially those that break\nde Sitter (dS) boosts, can generate significant leading signals for various\nparticle models in cosmological collider physics, the precise results for these\ncorrelators or their full signals remain unknown due to the lack of symmetry.\nIn this work, we apply the method of partial Mellin-Barnes (PMB) representation\nto the calculation of cosmological correlators at the loop level. As a first\nstep, we use the PMB representation to calculate four-point cosmological\ncorrelators with bubble topology. We find that both the nonlocal and local\nsignals arise from the factorized part, validating the cutting rules proposed\nin previous work, and are free from UV divergence. Furthermore, the UV\ndivergence originates solely from the background piece and can be manifestly\ncanceled by introducing the appropriate counterterm, similar to the procedure\nin flat spacetime. We also demonstrate how to renormalize the 1-loop\ncorrelators in Mellin space. After a consistency check with known results for\nthe covariant case, we provide new analytical results for the signals generated\nfrom a nontrivial dS-boost-breaking bubble.",

In this work, we\nfocus on a dissipative impurity problem as a testbed for new methodological\ndevelopments. We introduce an efficient non-perturbative framework that\ncombines the superposition of Gaussian states (SGS) variational ansatz with the\nquantum trajectory approach to simulate open systems featuring a dissipative\nimpurity. Applying this method to a spinful impurity subject to two-body losses\nand embedded in a bath of noninteracting fermions, we explore the full\ncrossover from weak to strong dissipation regimes. The non-perturbative nature\nof the SGS ansatz allows us to thoroughly examine this crossover, providing\ncomprehensive insights into the system's behavior. In the strong dissipation\nregime, our approach reproduces the finding that localized two-body losses can\ninduce the Kondo effect [arXiv:2406.03527], characterized by a slowdown of spin\nrelaxation and an enhancement of charge conductance. Furthermore, we reveal an\nexotic ``negative conductance\" phenomenon at zero potential bias -- a\ncounter-intuitive single-body effect resulting from intermediate dissipation\nand finite bandwidth. Finally, we investigate the formation of ferromagnetic\ndomains and propose an extension to realize a higher-spin Kondo model using\nlocalized dissipation.",

These robust\nsources were identified using a combination of Lyman-break selection and\nphotometric redshift estimates. The ultra-deep NIRCam imaging from GLIMPSE,\ncombined with the strong gravitational lensing of the Abell S1063 galaxy\ncluster, allows us to probe an intrinsically fainter population (down to\n$M_{\\rm UV} =-17.0$ mag) than previously achievable. These galaxies have\nabsolute magnitudes ranging from $M_{\\rm UV} = -17.0$ to $-17.2$ mag, with blue\n($\\beta \\simeq -2.87$) UV continuum slopes, consistent with young, dust-free\nstellar populations. The number density of these objects, log$_{\\rm\n10}$($\\phi$/[Mpc$^{-3}$ mag$^{-1}$])=$-3.47^{+0.13}_{-0.10}$ at $M_{\\rm\nUV}=-17$ is in clear tension with pre-JWST theoretical predictions, extending\nthe over-abundance of galaxies from $z\\sim10$ to $z\\sim 17$. These results,\ntogether with the scarcity of brighter galaxies in other public surveys,\nsuggest a steep decline in the bright-end of the UV luminosity function at $z\n\\sim 16$, implying efficient star formation and possibly a close connection to\nthe halo mass function at these redshifts. Testing a variety of star formation\nhistories suggests that these sources are plausible progenitors of the\nunusually UV-bright galaxies that JWST now routinely uncovers at $z = 10-14$.\nOverall, our results indicate that the luminosity distribution of the earliest\nstar-forming galaxies could be shifting towards fainter luminosities, implying\nthat future surveys of cosmic dawn will need to explore this faint luminosity\nregime.",

Very recently, SC is\nfound in the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ ultrathin film grown on the SrLaAlO$_4$\nsubstrate with $T_c$ above the McMillan limit ($\\approx 40\\text{ K}$) at\nambient pressure (AP), allowing various experimental investigation on the\npairing mechanism in this material. It is now eager to enhance the $T_c$ of\nLa$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at AP. Here we propose that an imposed strong perpendicular\nelectric field can strongly enhance the $T_c$ in the single-bilayer film of\nLa$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at AP. The physics underlying this proposal is clear and\nsimple. Under strong electric field, the layer with lower potential energy will\naccept electrons flowing from the other layer to fill in the Ni-$3d_{x^2-y^2}$\norbitals in this layer, as the nearly half-filled Ni-$3d_{z^2}$ orbital in this\nlayer cannot accommodate more electrons. With the enhancement of the filling\nfraction in the $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals in this layer, the interlayer $s$-wave\npairing will be subjected to the pair-breaking effect and be suppressed, but\nthe intralayer $d$-wave pairing in this layer is promptly and strongly\nenhanced, which mimics the cuprates. Our combined simplified one-orbital study\nand comprehensive two-orbital one under the mean-field treatment and the\ndensity matrix renormalization group approach consistently verify this idea and\nyield that an imposed voltage of about $0.1\\sim0.2$ volt between the two layers\nis enough to realize HTSC with $T_c$ above the boiling point of liquid nitrogen\nin this single bilayer at AP. Our results appeal for experimental verification.",

    "abstract": "We address the problem of generating videos from unposed internet photos. A\nhandful of input images serve as keyframes, and our model interpolates between\nthem to simulate a path moving between the cameras. Given random images, a\nmodel's ability to capture underlying geometry, recognize scene identity, and\nrelate frames in terms of camera position and orientation reflects a\nfundamental understanding of 3D structure and scene layout. However, existing\nvideo models such as Luma Dream Machine fail at this task. We design a\nself-supervised method that takes advantage of the consistency of videos and\nvariability of multiview internet photos to train a scalable, 3D-aware video\nmodel without any 3D annotations such as camera parameters. We validate that\nour method outperforms all baselines in terms of geometric and appearance\nconsistency. We also show our model benefits applications that enable camera\ncontrol, such as 3D Gaussian Splatting. Our results suggest that we can scale\nup scene-level 3D learning using only 2D data such as videos and multiview\ninternet photos.",

    "abstract": "The ability to synthesize personalized group photos and specify the positions\nof each identity offers immense creative potential. While such imagery can be\nvisually appealing, it presents significant challenges for existing\ntechnologies. A persistent issue is identity (ID) leakage, where injected\nfacial features interfere with one another, resulting in low face resemblance,\nincorrect positioning, and visual artifacts. Existing methods suffer from\nlimitations such as the reliance on segmentation models, increased runtime, or\na high probability of ID leakage. To address these challenges, we propose\nID-Patch, a novel method that provides robust association between identities\nand 2D positions. Our approach generates an ID patch and ID embeddings from the\nsame facial features: the ID patch is positioned on the conditional image for\nprecise spatial control, while the ID embeddings integrate with text embeddings\nto ensure high resemblance. Experimental results demonstrate that ID-Patch\nsurpasses baseline methods across metrics, such as face ID resemblance,\nID-position association accuracy, and generation efficiency.

While recent\nsparse learning methods have shown promising performance up to moderate\nsparsity levels such as 95% and 98%, accuracy quickly deteriorates when pushing\nsparsities to extreme levels due to unique challenges such as fragile gradient\nflow. In this work, we explore network performance beyond the commonly studied\nsparsities, and propose a collection of techniques that enable the continuous\nlearning of networks without accuracy collapse even at extreme sparsities,\nincluding 99.90%, 99.95% and 99.99% on ResNet architectures.

This problem is\ncompounded for first responders, who often have no clear information about the\nextent or nature of the damage within the mine. The poor-light or even total\ndarkness inside the mines makes rescue efforts incredibly difficult, leading to\na tragic loss of life. In this paper, we propose a novel instance segmentation\nmethod called DIS-Mine, specifically designed to identify disaster-affected\nareas within underground mines under low-light or poor visibility conditions,\naiding first responders in rescue efforts. DIS-Mine is capable of detecting\nobjects in images, even in complete darkness, by addressing challenges such as\nhigh noise, color distortions, and reduced contrast. The key innovations of\nDIS-Mine are built upon four core components: i) Image brightness improvement,\nii) Instance segmentation with SAM integration, iii) Mask R-CNN-based\nsegmentation, and iv) Mask alignment with feature matching. On top of that, we\nhave collected real-world images from an experimental underground mine,\nintroducing a new dataset named ImageMine, specifically gathered in\nlow-visibility conditions. This dataset serves to validate the performance of\nDIS-Mine in realistic, challenging environments. Our comprehensive experiments\non the ImageMine dataset, as well as on various other datasets demonstrate that\nDIS-Mine achieves a superior F1 score of 86.0% and mIoU of 72.0%, outperforming\nstate-of-the-art instance segmentation methods, with at least 15x improvement\nand up to 80% higher precision in object detection.",

    "abstract": "Novel view synthesis refers to the problem of synthesizing novel viewpoints\nof a scene given the images from a few viewpoints. This is a fundamental\nproblem in computer vision and graphics, and enables a vast variety of\napplications such as meta-verse, free-view watching of events, video gaming,\nvideo stabilization and video compression. Recent 3D representations such as\nradiance fields and multi-plane images significantly improve the quality of\nimages rendered from novel viewpoints. However, these models require a dense\nsampling of input views for high quality renders. Their performance goes down\nsignificantly when only a few input views are available. In this thesis, we\nfocus on the sparse input novel view synthesis problem for both static and\ndynamic scenes. In the first part of this work, we mainly focus on sparse input\nnovel view synthesis of static scenes using neural radiance fields (NeRF). We\nstudy the design of reliable and dense priors to better regularize the NeRF in\nsuch situations. In particular, we propose a prior on the visibility of the\npixels in a pair of input views. We show that this visibility prior, which is\nrelated to the relative depth of objects, is dense and more reliable than\nexisting priors on absolute depth. We compute the visibility prior using plane\nsweep volumes without the need to train a neural network on large datasets. We\nevaluate our approach on multiple datasets and show that our model outperforms\nexisting approaches for sparse input novel view synthesis. In the second part,\nwe aim to further improve the regularization by learning a scene-specific prior\nthat does not suffer from generalization issues. We achieve this by learning\nthe prior on the given scene alone without pre-training on large datasets. In\nparticular, we design augmented NeRFs to obtain better depth supervision in\ncertain regions of the scene for the main NeRF. Further, we extend this\nframework to also apply to newer and faster radiance field models such as\nTensoRF and ZipNeRF. Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets, we\nshow the superiority of our approach in sparse input novel view synthesis. The\ndesign of sparse input fast dynamic radiance fields is severely constrained by\nthe lack of suitable representations and reliable priors for motion. We address\nthe first challenge by designing an explicit motion model based on factorized\nvolumes that is compact and optimizes quickly. We also introduce reliable\nsparse flow priors to constrain the motion field, since we find that the\npopularly employed dense optical flow priors are unreliable. We show the\nbenefits of our motion representation and reliable priors on multiple datasets.\nIn the final part of this thesis, we study the application of view synthesis\nfor frame rate upsampling in video gaming. Specifically, we consider the\nproblem of temporal view synthesis, where the goal is to predict the future\nframes given the past frames and the camera motion. The key challenge here is\nin predicting the future motion of the objects by estimating their past motion\nand extrapolating it. We explore the use of multi-plane image representations\nand scene depth to reliably estimate the object motion, particularly in the\noccluded regions. We design a new database to effectively evaluate our approach\nfor temporal view synthesis of dynamic scenes and show that we achieve\nstate-of-the-art performance.",

Hence, in this paper, firstly we propose a\nquantitative definition of circularity, namely, $\\lambda$, predicated on\ncompartmental dynamical thermodynamics, and then, we use it to state the\noptimization of the circularity $\\lambda$ as an arg-max problem. By leveraging\nthe derivation of Lagrange's equations of motion from the first law of\nthermodynamics, we apply the analytical mechanics approaches to circularity.\nThree examples illustrate the calculation of $\\lambda$ for different settings\nof two compartmental networks. In particular, hypothesizing a repair stage\nfollowed by product reuse we highlight the memory property of $\\lambda$.\nFinally, robotic repair is proposed within this framework to pave the way for\ncircular robotics as a new area of research in which the performance of a\nrobotic system is measured against $\\lambda$.",

To this end, we propose the\nMetacognition for Unknown Situations and Environments (MUSE) framework, which\nintegrates metacognitive processes--specifically self-awareness and\nself-regulation--into autonomous agents. We present two initial implementations\nof MUSE: one based on world modeling and another leveraging large language\nmodels (LLMs), both instantiating the metacognitive cycle. Our system\ncontinuously learns to assess its competence on a given task and uses this\nself-awareness to guide iterative cycles of strategy selection. MUSE agents\nshow significant improvements in self-awareness and self-regulation, enabling\nthem to solve novel, out-of-distribution tasks more effectively compared to\nDreamer-v3-based reinforcement learning and purely prompt-based LLM agent\napproaches. This work highlights the promise of approaches inspired by\ncognitive and neural systems in enabling autonomous systems to adapt to new\nenvironments, overcoming the limitations of current methods that rely heavily\non extensive training data.",

    "abstract": "3D head stylization transforms realistic facial features into artistic\nrepresentations, enhancing user engagement across gaming and virtual reality\napplications. While 3D-aware generators have made significant advancements,\nmany 3D stylization methods primarily provide near-frontal views and struggle\nto preserve the unique identities of original subjects, often resulting in\noutputs that lack diversity and individuality. This paper addresses these\nchallenges by leveraging the PanoHead model, synthesizing images from a\ncomprehensive 360-degree perspective. We propose a novel framework that employs\nnegative log-likelihood distillation (LD) to enhance identity preservation and\nimprove stylization quality. By integrating multi-view grid score and mirror\ngradients within the 3D GAN architecture and introducing a score rank weighing\ntechnique, our approach achieves substantial qualitative and quantitative\nimprovements. Our findings not only advance the state of 3D head stylization\nbut also provide valuable insights into effective distillation processes\nbetween diffusion models and GANs, focusing on the critical issue of identity\npreservation.

Abnormal cell growth in the squamous epithelial\nlining of the cervix leads to cervical cancer in females.

For population-based cervical cancer screening, visual\ninspection with acetic acid is a cost-effective method with high sensitivity.\nHowever, Pap smears are also suitable for mass screening due to their higher\nspecificity. The current Pap smear analysis method is manual, time-consuming,\nlabor-intensive, and prone to human error.

Various machine learning (ML) algorithms, including Gradient\nBoosting, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and k-Nearest Neighbor, as\nwell as deep learning (DL) approaches like ResNet-50, were employed for this\nclassification task.

This stress is frequently expressed in\nLGBTQ+ users' posts on social media platforms. However, these expressions are\nnot just straightforward manifestations of minority stress. They involve\nlinguistic complexity (e.g., idiom or lexical diversity), rendering them\nchallenging for many traditional natural language processing methods to detect.\nIn this work, we designed a hybrid model using Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and\nBidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), a pre-trained\ndeep language model to improve the classification performance of minority\nstress detection. We experimented with our model on a benchmark social media\ndataset for minority stress detection (LGBTQ+ MiSSoM+). The dataset is\ncomprised of 5,789 human-annotated Reddit posts from LGBTQ+ subreddits. Our\napproach enables the extraction of hidden linguistic nuances through\npretraining on a vast amount of raw data, while also engaging in transductive\nlearning to jointly develop representations for both labeled training data and\nunlabeled test data. The RoBERTa-GCN model achieved an accuracy of 0.86 and an\nF1 score of 0.86, surpassing the performance of other baseline models in\npredicting LGBTQ+ minority stress.

Solving tridiagonal systems on\ndistributed-memory environments is not straightforward, and often requires\nsignificant amount of communication. In this article, we present a novel\ndistributed-memory tridiagonal solver algorithm, DistD2-TDS, based on a\nspecialised data structure. DistD2-TDS algorithm takes advantage of the\ndiagonal dominance in tridiagonal systems to reduce the communications in\ndistributed-memory environments. The underlying data structure plays a crucial\nrole for the performance of the algorithm. First, the data structure improves\ndata localities and makes it possible to minimise data movements via cache\nblocking and kernel fusion strategies. Second, data continuity enables a\ncontiguous data access pattern and results in efficient utilisation of the\navailable memory bandwidth. Finally, the data layout supports vectorisation on\nCPUs and thread level parallelisation on GPUs for improved performance. In\norder to demonstrate the robustness of the algorithm, we implemented and\nbenchmarked the algorithm on CPUs and GPUs. We investigated the single rank\nperformance and compared against existing algorithms. Furthermore, we analysed\nthe strong scaling of the implementation up to 384 NVIDIA H100 GPUs and up to\n8192 AMD EPYC 7742 CPUs. Finally, we demonstrated a practical use case of the\nalgorithm by using compact finite difference schemes to solve a 3D non-linear\nPDE. The results demonstrate that DistD2 algorithm can sustain around 66% of\nthe theoretical peak bandwidth at scale on CPU and GPU based supercomputers.",

These methods integrate an\nencoding of the state of the nonlinear dynamical system forward in time. We\npropose a space-time method -- one that solves a system of algebraic equations\nfor the encoding of the trajectory, i.e., the solution on a time interval\n$[0,T]$. The benefit of this approach is that with the same total number of\ndegrees of freedom, a space-time encoding can leverage spatiotemporal\ncorrelations to represent the trajectory far more accurately than a space-only\none. We use spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD) modes, a spatial\nbasis at each temporal frequency tailored to the structures that appear at that\nfrequency, to represent the trajectory. These modes have a number of properties\nthat make them an ideal choice for space-time model reduction. We derive an\nalgebraic system involving the SPOD coefficients that represent the solution,\nas well as the initial condition and the forcing. The online phase of the\nmethod consists of solving this system for the SPOD coefficients given the\ninitial condition and forcing. We test the model on a Ginzburg-Landau system, a\n$1 + 1$ dimensional nonlinear PDE. We find that the proposed method is $\\sim 2$\norders of magnitude more accurate than POD-Galerkin at the same number of modes\nand CPU time for all of our tests.

    "abstract": "Machine learning models are increasingly being utilized across various fields\nand tasks due to their outstanding performance and strong generalization\ncapabilities. Nonetheless, their success hinges on the availability of large\nvolumes of annotated data, the creation of which is often labor-intensive,\ntime-consuming, and expensive. Many active learning (AL) approaches have been\nproposed to address these challenges, but they often fail to fully leverage the\ninformation from the core phases of AL, such as training on the labeled set and\nquerying new unlabeled samples. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel AL\napproach, Loss Prediction Loss with Gradient Norm (LPLgrad), designed to\nquantify model uncertainty effectively and improve the accuracy of image\nclassification tasks. LPLgrad operates in two distinct phases: (i) {\\em\nTraining Phase} aims to predict the loss for input features by jointly training\na main model and an auxiliary model. Both models are trained on the labeled\ndata to maximize the efficiency of the learning process, an aspect often\noverlooked in previous AL methods. This dual-model approach enhances the\nability to extract complex input features and learn intrinsic patterns from the\ndata effectively; (ii) {\\em Querying Phase} that quantifies the uncertainty of\nthe main model to guide sample selection. This is achieved by calculating the\ngradient norm of the entropy values for samples in the unlabeled dataset.\nSamples with the highest gradient norms are prioritized for labeling and\nsubsequently added to the labeled set, improving the model's performance with\nminimal labeling effort. Extensive evaluations on real-world datasets\ndemonstrate that the LPLgrad approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods by\norder of magnitude in terms of accuracy on a small number of labeled images,\nyet achieving comparable training and querying times in multiple image\nclassification tasks.",

In 2023, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development reported\n653,100 people experiencing homelessness on any given night -- a 23% rise since\n2022, though likely an undercount. This paper examines a unique three-year\ndataset (2022-2024) of survey responses from over 3,000 unhoused individuals in\nKing County, WA, collected via network-based sampling methods to estimate the\nunsheltered population. Our study analyzes the networks of the unsheltered\npopulation, focusing on acquaintance, close friendship, kinship, and peer\nreferral networks. Findings reveal a decline in social connectivity over time.\nThe average number of acquaintances dropped from 80 in 2023 to 40 in 2024.\nClose friendship levels remained stable at 2.5, but given the growth in the\nhomeless population, this suggests decreased network connectivity. Kinship\nnetworks expanded, indicating that more family members of unhoused individuals\nare also experiencing homelessness. These trends suggest increasing social\ndisconnection, possibly driven by displacement and a rise in newly homeless\nindividuals. The growing isolation may reduce opportunities for information\nsharing and mutual support. However, the increased reliance on family networks\nhighlights the shifting dynamics of social support within this community. This\nresearch underscores the need for policies fostering social connections and\ncommunity building, such as reducing displacement and providing spaces for\ncongregation, to counter the growing anomie among unhoused populations.",

In this paper we completely resolve\nthis problem, proving an optimal dependence of the number of disjoint pairs on\nthe size of family $F$. We also prove the natural variant of the\nDaykin-Erd\\H{o}s conjecture in which disjoint pairs are replaced by pairs with\nintersection $\\lambda\\neq 0$.\n  - Motivated by a conjecture of Lovett related to the famous log-rank\nconjecture, Singer and Sudan asked to show that for two families $A, B\n\\subseteq 2^{[n]}$ with a positive constant fraction of set pairs $(a,b)\\in\nA\\times B$ being disjoint, there are $R\\subset A$ and $S\\subset B$ such that\nall set pairs $(r, s)\\in R\\times S$ are disjoint, and $|R|\\geq\n2^{-O(\\sqrt{n})}|A|$ and $|S|\\geq 2^{-O(\\sqrt{n})}|B|$.

    "abstract": "Erasures are the primary type of errors in physical systems dominated by\nleakage errors. While quantum error correction (QEC) using stabilizer codes can\ncombat erasure errors, it remains unknown which constructions achieve capacity\nperformance. If such codes exist, decoders with linear runtime in the code\nlength are also desired. In this paper, we present erasure capacity-achieving\nquantum codes under maximum-likelihood decoding (MLD), though MLD requires\ncubic runtime in the code length. For QEC, using an accurate decoder with the\nshortest possible runtime will minimize the degradation of quantum information\nwhile awaiting the decoder's decision. To address this, we propose belief\npropagation (BP) decoders that run in linear time and exploit error degeneracy\nin stabilizer codes, achieving capacity or near-capacity performance for a\nbroad class of codes, including bicycle codes, product codes, and topological\ncodes. We furthermore explore the potential of our BP decoders to handle mixed\nerasure and depolarizing errors, and also local deletion errors via\nconcatenation with permutation invariant codes.",

To assess faint\nactivity, we establish constraints on dust production driven by the limited\nsublimating area of water ice, based on studies of the 1956 Phoenicids. The\nejected dust mass is $M_{\\rm d}$ = 4100 $\\pm$ 200 kg (inbound) and 1700 $\\pm$\n200 kg (outbound), respectively.

    "abstract": "Axionic domain walls, as they move through the early universe plasma during\ntheir collapse, can generate a net baryon and lepton number through the\nmechanism of spontaneous baryogenesis, provided that there is a coupling\nbetween the axion and the lepton or baryon current. In this paper, we study\nsystematically the baryon asymmetry produced by these domain walls (DWs) at\nannihilation, within different realisations of the $L$- or $B$-violating\nsector, and refer to this process as DW-genesis. We find that the baryon number\nis maximised when the DW network collapses approximately at the moment when the\n$L$- or $B$-violating interaction decouples. We study a model of minimal\nleptogenesis, a model of cogenesis, a model of baryogenesis and finally the\npossibility that the baryon asymmetry is produced by electroweak sphalerons. As\nphenomenological consequences of DW-genesis, we discuss the expected\ngravitational wave signal from the DW network annihilation and the prospects\nfor detecting it. However, we finally emphasize that in realisations of the\nDW-genesis in minimal post-inflationary scenarios, there is a suppression\ninduced by the cancellation between the asymmetry created by \"opposite\" axionic\ndomain walls attached to the string. We quantify the impact of this\ncancellation and discuss possible ways to avoid it.",

In this work, we demonstrate this challenge by studying how the\ngalaxy-halo size relations impact the galaxy clustering signals. We investigate\nthe reason that a simple linear relation model, which prescribes that the\ngalaxy size is linearly proportional to the dark matter halo's virial radius,\ncan still produce clustering signals that match the observational data\nreasonably well. We find that this simple linear relation model for galaxy\nsizes, when combined with the subhalo abundance matching technique, introduces\nan implicit dependence on the halo formation history. As a result, the effect\nof halo assembly bias enters the resulting galaxy clustering, especially at\nlower stellar masses, producing a clustering signal that resembles the observed\none. At higher stellar masses, the effect of halo assembly bias weakens and is\npartially canceled out by the effect of halo bias, and the clustering of large\nand small galaxies becomes more similar. This combined effect implies that\nsmall and large galaxies not only occupy halos of different masses, but they\nmust also occupy halos of different assembly histories. Our study highlights\nthe challenge of identifying a particular halo property that controls galaxy\nsizes through constraints from galaxy clustering alone.",

On the lattice side, the shift goes from the notion of frame\nhomomorphism to that of closed subfit morphism between bounded distributive\nlattices (closed subfit morphisms are defined by a natural and first order\nexpressible constraint). The reflection becomes a duality when one restricts on\nthe algebraic side to the complete and compact subfit lattices (i.e. compact\nsubfit frames). Furthermore, restricting our duality on the topological side to\nthe subcategory of compact $T_2$-spaces with all continuous maps, we obtain a\nduality for these with the category of complete, compact and normal lattices,\nthus recovering a classical result of Cornish.

The method was validated against simulation results for room-temperature\nirradiation and transmission electron microscopy observations for higher\ntemperatures. After irradiation at 500 and 700{\\deg}C, small clusters (<20\nvacancies, ~0.85 nm) undetectable by TEM were unveiled, with concentrations\nexceeding 10$^{25}$ m$^{-3}$, significantly higher than the concentration of\nTEM-visible defects (10$^{24}$ m$^{-3}$). Moreover, incorporating an\noxygen-vacancy complex is deemed necessary to accurately replicate experimental\ndata in samples subjected to high-temperature irradiation.",

However, we observe that using\nRoPE with BFloat16 format results in numerical issues, causing it to deviate\nfrom its intended relative positional encoding, especially in long-context\nscenarios. This issue arises from BFloat16's limited precision and accumulates\nas context length increases, with the first token contributing significantly to\nthis problem. To address this, we develop AnchorAttention, a plug-and-play\nattention method that alleviates numerical issues caused by BFloat16, improves\nlong-context capabilities, and speeds up training. AnchorAttention reduces\nunnecessary attention computations, maintains semantic coherence, and boosts\ncomputational efficiency by treating the first token as a shared anchor with a\nconsistent position ID, making it visible to all documents within the training\ncontext. Experiments on three types of LLMs demonstrate that AnchorAttention\nsignificantly improves long-context performance and reduces training time by\nover 50\\% compared to standard full attention mechanisms, while preserving the\noriginal LLM's capabilities on general tasks.

As a result, algorithms that control the reconfigurable\nelements of REMSs (e.g., the phase shifts of an RIS) are often built on\nsimplistic models that are inaccurate. To enable physically accurate\nREMS-parameter tuning, we present a new framework for efficient and physically\nconsistent modeling of general REMSs. Our modeling method combines a\ncircuit-theoretic approach with a new formalism that describes a REMS's\ninteraction with the electromagnetic (EM) waves in its far-field region. Our\nmodeling method enables efficient computation of the entire far-field radiation\npattern for arbitrary configurations of the REMS reconfigurable elements once a\nsingle full-wave EM simulation of the non-reconfigurable parts of the REMS has\nbeen performed. The predictions made by the proposed framework align with the\nphysical laws of classical electrodynamics and model effects caused by\ninter-antenna coupling, non-reciprocal materials, polarization, ohmic losses,\nmatching losses, influence of metallic housings, noise from low-noise\namplifiers, and noise arising in or received by antennas. In order to validate\nthe efficiency and accuracy of our modeling approach, we (i) compare our\nmodeling method to EM simulations and (ii) conduct a case study involving a\nplanar RRA that enables simultaneous multiuser beam- and null-forming using a\nnew, computationally efficient, and physically accurate parameter tuning\nalgorithm.",

Equivalently, polyhedral graphs are\nKronecker products in at most one way. This is a special case of the deep and\ninteresting question, open in general, of Kronecker product cancellation for\nsimple graphs: when does $A\\wedge C\\simeq B\\wedge C$ imply $A\\simeq B$?\n  We complete our investigation on simultaneous products by characterising and\nconstructing the planar graphs that are Cartesian products in two distinct\nways, and the planar, $3$-connected graphs that are both Kronecker and\nCartesian products.\n  The other type of results we obtain are in extremal graph theory. We classify\nthe polyhedral Kronecker products that are either face-regular or\nvertex-regular graphs. The face-regular ones are certain quadrangulations of\nthe sphere, while the vertex-regular ones are certain cubic graphs (duals of\nmaximal planar graphs).

While orthogonal to this direction\nthe OTOC thermalizes as an usual MBL time-independent system (at stroboscopic\ntimes), along the $\\ell$-bit direction the system features a more complex\nstructure. The scrambling appears as a combination of an initially frozen\ndynamics (while in the stable period doubling magnetization time window) and a\nlater logarithmic slow growth (over its decoherence regime) till full\nthermalization. Interestingly, in the late time regime, since the wavefront\npropagation of correlations has already settled through the whole chain,\nscrambling occurs at the same rate regardless of the distance between the\nspins, thus resulting in an overall envelope-like structure of all OTOCs,\nindependent of their distance, merging into a single growth.

The mathematical questions that are raised by the DK\nequation are presented in a non-specialist language. In the last parts of the\nreview, I show how the original result was extended in several directions, I\npresent the different strategies and approximations that have been employed to\nsolve the DK equation, both analytically and numerically. I finally list the\ndifferent situations where SDFT was employed to describe the fluctuations of\nBrownian suspensions, from the physics of active matter to the description of\ncharged particles and electrolytes.",

We perform numerical simulations of dense\nsuspensions of rigid non-Brownian spherical particles at volume fractions\n($\\phi$) between 0.40 and 0.55 subject to this new RS protocol and compare to\nthe classical OS protocol. We find that the suspension viscosity displays a\nsimilar non-monotonic response as the strain amplitude ($\\gamma_0$) is\nincreased: a minimum viscosity is found at an intermediate, volume-fraction\ndependent strain amplitude. However, the suspension dynamics is different in\nthe new protocol. Unlike the OS protocol, suspensions under RS do not show\nself-adsorbing states at any $\\gamma_0$ and do not undergo the\nreversible-irreversible transition: the stroboscropic particle dynamics are\nalways diffusive, which we attribute to the fact that the RS protocol is\nirreversible. To validate this hypothesis, we introduce a reversible-RS (RRS)\nprotocol, a combination of RS and OS, where we rotate the shear direction (as\nin RS) until it is instantaneously reversed (as in OS), and find the resulting\nrheology and dynamics to be closer to OS. Detailed microstructure analysis\nshows that both the OS and RRS protocols result in a contact-free, isotropic to\nan in-contact, anisotropic microstructure at the dynamically\nreversible-to-irreversible transition. The RS protocol does not render such a\ntransition, and the dynamics remain diffusive with an in-contact, anisotropic\nmicrostructure for all strain amplitudes.",

Their physical origin remains debated, although so-called\nimpacts models in which a secondary orbiting body pierces through the accretion\ndisc around the primary supermassive black hole (SMBH) in an extreme mass-ratio\ninspiral (EMRI) system are considered promising. In this work, we study the QPE\ntiming properties of GSN 069, the first galactic nucleus in which QPEs were\nidentified, primarily focusing on Observed minus Calculated (O-C) diagrams. The\nO-C data in GSN 069 are consistent with a super-orbital modulation on tens of\ndays whose properties do not comply with the impacts model. We suggest that\nrigid precession of a misaligned accretion disc or, alternatively, the presence\nof a second SMBH forming a sub-milliparsec binary with the inner EMRI is needed\nto reconcile the model with the data. In both cases, the quiescent accretion\ndisc emission should also be modulated on similar timescales. Current X-ray\nmonitoring indicates that this might be the case, although a longer baseline of\nhigher-cadence observations is needed to confirm the tentative X-ray flux\nperiodicity on firm statistical grounds. Future dedicated monitoring campaigns\nwill be crucial to test the overall impacts plus modulation model in GSN 069,\nand to distinguish between the two proposed modulating scenarios. If our\ninterpretation is correct, QPEs in GSN 069 represent the first electromagnetic\ndetection of a short-period EMRI system in an external galaxy, opening the way\nto future multi-messenger astronomical observations.

The theoretical\nanalysis demonstrates that the vehicle state evolution and the corresponding\nsafety of ACC in cut-in situations are influenced by multiple factors,\nincluding the original leading vehicle's state, the initial conditions of the\ncut-in vehicle, subsequent cut-in maneuvers, sensing delays, and the ACC's\nanticipation capabilities. To quantitatively assess these influences, a series\nof numerical experiments were conducted to perform a stochastic safety analysis\nof ACC systems, accounting for embedded sensing delays and anticipation, using\nempirically calibrated control parameters from real-world data. The experiments\nrevealed that the impact of sensing delays on ACC is multifaceted.\nSpecifically, sensing delays negatively affect ACC stability, with the severity\nincreasing as the delay lengthens. Furthermore, collision risk in cut-in\nscenarios becomes more significant with sensing delays, particularly when the\ncut-in vehicle is slower than the following vehicle and when cut-ins are\naggressive. However, anticipation plays a crucial role in mitigating these\nrisks. Even with a 0.6-second anticipation, collision risk can be reduced by\n91% in highly adverse scenarios. Finally, both sensing delays and anticipation\nhave effects that intensify with their duration. An anticipation period of 2\nseconds effectively ensures safety in aggressive cut-in conditions, even in the\npresence of sensing delays.",

    "abstract": "Throughout a planetary system's formation evolution, some of the planetary\nmaterial may end up falling into the host star and be engulfed by it, leading\nto a potential variation of the stellar composition. The present study explores\nhow planet engulfment may impact the chemical composition of the stellar\nsurface and discusses what would be the rate of events with an observable\nimprint, for Sun-like stars. We use data from the NGPPS calculations by the\nGeneration III Bern model to analyse the conditions under which planet\nengulfment may occur. Additionally, we use stellar models computed with\nCesam2k20 to account for how the stellar internal structure and its processes\nmay affect the dilution of the signal caused by planet engulfment. Our results\nshow that there are three different phases associated to different mechanisms\nunder which engulfment events may happen. Moreover, systems that undergo planet\nengulfment are more likely to come from protoplanetary disks that are more\nmassive and more metal-rich than non-engulfing systems. Engulfment events\nleading to an observable signal happen after the dissipation of the\nprotoplanetary disk when the convective envelope of the stars becomes thinner.\nWith the stellar convective layer shrinking as the star evolves in the main\nsequence, they display a higher variation of chemical composition, which also\ncorrelates with the amount of engulfed material. By accounting for the physical\nprocesses happening in the stellar interior and in the optimistic case of being\nable to detect variations above 0.02 dex in the stellar composition, we find an\nengulfment rate no higher than $20\\%$ for Sun-like stars that may reveal\ndetectable traces of planet engulfment. Engulfment events that lead to an\nobservable variation of the stellar composition are rare due to the specific\nconditions required to result in such signatures.",

Over a field of characteristic zero, this problem is resolved\nby the Borel-Weil-Bott theorem. In positive characteristic, we give recursive\nformulas for cohomology, generalizing work of Donkin and Liu in the case of the\n3-dimensional flag variety. In characteristic 2, we provide non-recursive\nformulas describing the cohomology characters in terms of truncated Schur\npolynomials and Nim symmetric polynomials. The main technical ingredient in our\nwork is the recursive description of the splitting type of vector bundles of\nprincipal parts on the projective line. We also discuss properties of the\nstructure constants in the graded Han-Monsky representation ring, and explain\nhow our cohomology calculation characterizes the Weak Lefschetz Property for\nArtinian monomial complete intersections.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of a deformed subcritical fast magnetosonic shock front is\ncompared between two two-dimensional PIC simulations with different\norientations of the magnetic field relative to the simulation box. All other\ninitial and simulation conditions are kept identical. Shock boundary\noscillations are observed in the simulation where the magnetic field direction\nis resolved. This oscillation is caused by the reformation of the shock front.\nOne part of the front acts as a shock, while the other functions as a magnetic\npiston, with both halves changing their states in antiphase. The oscillation\nperiod corresponds to the time required for one shock wave to grow as the other\ncollapses. In contrast, the corrugated fast magnetosonic shock does not\noscillate in the second simulation, where the magnetic field is oriented out of\nthe simulation plane. This dependence on magnetic field orientation suggests\nthat the shock oscillation is induced by magnetic tension, which is only\neffective in the first simulation. In both simulations, the shock perturbation\ndoes not grow over time, indicating that the shocks are stable. The potential\nrelevance of these findings for the Alfv\\'enic oscillations of the\nsupercritical Earth's bow shock, detected by the MMS multi-spacecraft mission,\nis also discussed.",

    "abstract": "Melting of two-dimensional mono-crystals is described within the celebrated\nKosterlitz-Thouless-Halperin-Nelson-Young scenario (KTHNY-Theory) by the\ndissociation of topological defects. It describes the shielding of elasticity\ndue to thermally activated topological defects until shear elasticity\ndisappears. As a well defined continuous phase transition, freezing and melting\nshould be reversible and independent of history. However, this is not the case:\ncooling an isotropic 2D fluid with a finite but nonzero rate does not end in\nmono-crystals. The symmetry can not be broken globally but only locally in the\nthermodynamic limit due to the critical slowing down of order parameter\nfluctuations. This results in finite sized domains with the same order\nparameter. For linear cooling rates, the domain size is described by the\nKibble-Zurek mechanism, originally developed for the defect formation of the\nprimordial Higgs-field shortly after the Big-Bang. In the present manuscript,\nwe investigate the limit of the deepest descent quench on a colloidal monolayer\nand resolve the time dependence of structure formation for (local) symmetry\nbreaking. Quenching to various target temperatures below the melting point\n(deep in the crystalline phase and just close to the transition), we find\nuniversal behaviour if the timescale is re-scaled properly.",

    "abstract": "Imbalanced data distributions are prevalent in real-world scenarios, posing\nsignificant challenges in both imbalanced classification and imbalanced\nregression tasks. They often cause deep learning models to overfit in areas of\nhigh sample density (many-shot regions) while underperforming in areas of low\nsample density (few-shot regions). This characteristic restricts the utility of\ndeep learning models in various sectors, notably healthcare, where areas with\nfew-shot data hold greater clinical relevance. While recent studies have shown\nthe benefits of incorporating distribution information in imbalanced\nclassification tasks, such strategies are rarely explored in imbalanced\nregression. In this paper, we address this issue by introducing a novel loss\nfunction, termed Dist Loss, designed to minimize the distribution distance\nbetween the model's predictions and the target labels in a differentiable\nmanner, effectively integrating distribution information into model training.\nDist Loss enables deep learning models to regularize their output distribution\nduring training, effectively enhancing their focus on few-shot regions. We have\nconducted extensive experiments across three datasets spanning computer vision\nand healthcare: IMDB-WIKI-DIR, AgeDB-DIR, and ECG-Ka-DIR. The results\ndemonstrate that Dist Loss effectively mitigates the negative impact of\nimbalanced data distribution on model performance, achieving state-of-the-art\nresults in sparse data regions. Furthermore, Dist Loss is easy to integrate,\ncomplementing existing methods.",

    "abstract": "At sub-eikonal order in the high-energy limit, helicity dependences are\ngenerally contained in the transverse components of the gluon field. In the\ngluon saturation regime, novel helicity effects arise from the nonlinear\ninteraction between the eikonal-order longitudinal gluon field and the\nsub-eikonal-order transverse gluon field. We derive this saturation induced\nhelicity-dependent field both by solving the classical Yang-Mills equations and\nthrough direct diagrammatic calculations. Our analysis shows that the\nsaturation induced helicity effect is intrinsically a two-particle (or\nmulti-particle) correlation effect, rather than a single-particle distribution\neffect. Furthermore, we evaluate this effect in the context of double-spin\nasymmetry for incoherent diffractive dijet production in longitudinally\npolarized electron-nucleus collisions, using a simplified helicity-extended\nMcLerran-Venugopalan model. We find that the saturation induced helicity effect\nfurther suppresses the back-to-back peak in the dijet azimuthal angle\ncorrelation, with a magnitude comparable to that of the direct helicity effect.\nThis gluon saturation induced helicity effect may offer a novel avenue to probe\ngluon saturation in polarized collisions.",

Here we\nresolve this discrepancy by studying the interplay between the thermal entropy,\ndensity disorder and antiferromagnetism of half-filled 3D Hubbard model with\nnumerically exact auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We have\nachieved accurate entropy phase diagram, which allows us to simulate arbitrary\nentropy path on the temperature-interaction plane and to track the experimental\nparameters. We then find that above discrepancy can be quantitatively explained\nby the {\\it entropy increase} as enhancing the interaction in experiment, and\ntogether by the lattice {\\it density disorder} existing in the experimental\nsetup.

Our calculations pinpoint the\ndivergences in the AF phase diagram, showing that while the onset of AF order\nmitigates the breakdown of the perturbation expansion, it does not fully\nprevent it. Moreover, we have been able to link the changes in the dynamical\nstructure of the corresponding generalized susceptibilities to the physical\ncrossover from a weak-coupling (Slater) to a strong-coupling (Heisenberg)\nantiferromagnet, which takes place as the interaction strength is gradually\nincreased. Finally, we discuss possible physical consequences of the\nirreducible vertex divergences in triggering phase-separation instabilities\nwithin the AF phase and elaborate on the implications of our findings for\ntwo-dimensional systems, where the onset of a long-range AF order is prevented\nby the Mermin-Wagner theorem.",

While individual POI recommendation methods\nleverage users' check-in histories to provide personalized suggestions, they\nstruggle to address scenarios requiring group decision-making. Group POI\nrecommendation systems aim to satisfy the collective preferences of multiple\nusers, but existing approaches face two major challenges: diverse group\npreferences and extreme data sparsity in group check-in data. To overcome these\nchallenges, we propose LLMGPR, a novel framework that leverages large language\nmodels (LLMs) for group POI recommendations. LLMGPR introduces\nsemantic-enhanced POI tokens and incorporates rich contextual information to\nmodel the diverse and complex dynamics of group decision-making. To further\nenhance its capabilities, we developed a sequencing adapter using Quantized\nLow-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA), which aligns LLMs with group POI recommendation\ntasks. To address the issue of sparse group check-in data, LLMGPR employs an\naggregation adapter that integrates individual representations into meaningful\ngroup representations. Additionally, a self-supervised learning (SSL) task is\ndesigned to predict the purposes of check-in sequences (e.g., business trips\nand family vacations), thereby enriching group representations with deeper\nsemantic insights. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of\nLLMGPR, showcasing its ability to significantly enhance the accuracy and\nrobustness of group POI recommendations.",

Assumptions such\nas Gaussianity, stationarity, and data continuity are unrealistic, and must be\nreplaced with physically motivated data simulations, and data analysis methods\nadapted to accommodate such likely imperfections. To this end, the LISA Data\nChallenges have produced datasets featuring time-varying and unequal\nconstellation armlength, and measurement artifacts including data interruptions\nand instrumental transients. In this work, we assess the impact of these data\nartifacts on the inference of Galactic Binary and Massive Black Hole\nproperties. Our analysis shows that the treatment of noise transients and gaps\nis necessary for effective parameter estimation, as they substantially corrupt\nthe analysis if unmitigated. We find that straightforward mitigation techniques\ncan significantly if imperfectly suppress artifacts. For the Galactic Binaries,\nmitigation of glitches was essentially total, while mitigations of the data\ngaps increased parameter uncertainty by approximately 10%. For the Massive\nBlack Hole binaries the particularly pernicious glitches resulted in a 30%\nuncertainty increase after mitigations, while the data gaps can increase\nparameter uncertainty by up to several times.

This model enhances the\nNS_Tide's ability to accurately predict water levels from tide-dominated\nsections downstream to discharge-dominated areas upstream. River discharge was\nidentified as the dominant factor for predicting stage levels at most stations,\nwhile the influence of storm surge, though consistent, decreased upstream.\nStrong tide-river interactions were observed throughout the study domain, with\nthe stationary tidal component consistently contributing to water level\nfluctuations at all locations, and minimal influence from the tide-surge\ninteraction component. Simulations using the STREAM numerical model were also\nused to isolate the variability in water levels caused by power peaking. These\nsimulations demonstrated that high-frequency discharge fluctuations due to\nhydropower plant operations amplify the $S_1$ constituent in upstream river\nsections and modulate the amplitudes of other tidal constituents in the\nestuarine and tidal river sections.

Aims: L$_2$ Pup is often called the second-closest Asymptotic Giant\nBranch (AGB) star to the sun, second only to R Doradus. However, whether the\nstar is indeed on the AGB or the Red Giant Branch (RGB) is questionable. We\nreview its evolutionary state. Methods: We analyse high-resolution optical\narchive spectra to search for absorption lines of the third dredge-up indicator\ntechnetium (Tc) in L$_2$~Pup. We also compare the star to a sample of\nwell-known AGB stars in terms of luminosity and pulsation properties and place\nit in a Gaia-2MASS diagram. Results: L$_2$ Pup is found to be Tc-poor. Thus, it\nis not undergoing third dredge-up events. The star is fainter than the RGB tip\nand fainter than all Tc-rich stars in the comparison sample. L$_2$ Pup pulsates\nin the fundamental mode, similar to Mira variables, but its pulsation\nproperties do not allow us to distinguish between the RGB and AGB stages.\nConclusions: In conclusion, L$_2$ Pup could be an RGB or early AGB star, but it\nis more likely to be an RGB than an AGB star. Our findings are important for a\nbetter understanding of the L$_2$ Pup system and its past and future evolution",

The\nsymbol $[\\dots ]$ denotes the integer part. This map reduces to the ordinary\nGauss map for $\\alpha=1$. The system exhibits a sudden `jump into chaos' at the\ncritical parameter value $\\alpha=\\alpha_c \\equiv 0.241485141808811\\dots$ which\nwe analyse in detail in this paper. Several analytical and numerical results\nare established for this new map as a function of the parameter $\\alpha$. In\nparticular, we show that, at the critical point, the invariant density\napproaches a $q$-Gaussian with $q=2$ (i.e., the Cauchy distribution), which\nbecomes infinitely narrow as $\\alpha \\to \\alpha_c^+$. Moreover, in the chaotic\nregion for large values of the parameter $\\alpha$ we analytically derive\napproximate formulas for the invariant density, by solving the corresponding\nPerron-Frobenius equation. For $\\alpha \\to \\infty$ the uniform density is\napproached.

A flavour non-universal gauged abelian symmetry is\nimposed on top of LRSM, which helps in inducing the masses of second and\nfirst-generation fermions at one-loop and two-loop, respectively, and thereby\nreproduces the hierarchical spectrum of the masses. Parity invariance requires\nthe vanishing of the strong CP parameter at the zeroth order, and the non-zero\ncontribution arises at the two-loop level, which is in agreement with the\nexperimental constraints. The minimal model predicts flavour symmetry breaking\nscale and the $SU(2)_R$ symmetry breaking scale at the same level. flavour\nnon-universality of the new gauge interaction leads to various flavour-changing\ntransitions both in quarks and leptonic sectors and, therefore, has various\nphenomenologically interesting signatures. The model predicts a new physics\nscale near $10^8$ GeV or above for phenomenological consistent solutions. This,\nin turn, restricts strong CP phase $\\bar{\\theta} \\lesssim 10^{-14}$ as the\nparity breaking scale and flavour scale are related in the minimal framework.",

While many Stable Diffusion (SD)-based Real-ISR methods have\nachieved remarkable success, their slow, multi-step inference hinders practical\ndeployment. Recent SD-based one-step networks like OSEDiff and S3Diff alleviate\nthis issue but still incur high computational costs due to their reliance on\nlarge pretrained SD models. This paper proposes a novel Real-ISR method, AdcSR,\nby distilling the one-step diffusion network OSEDiff into a streamlined\ndiffusion-GAN model under our Adversarial Diffusion Compression (ADC)\nframework. We meticulously examine the modules of OSEDiff, categorizing them\ninto two types: (1) Removable (VAE encoder, prompt extractor, text encoder,\netc.) and (2) Prunable (denoising UNet and VAE decoder). Since direct removal\nand pruning can degrade the model's generation capability, we pretrain our\npruned VAE decoder to restore its ability to decode images and employ\nadversarial distillation to compensate for performance loss. This ADC-based\ndiffusion-GAN hybrid design effectively reduces complexity by 73% in inference\ntime, 78% in computation, and 74% in parameters, while preserving the model's\ngeneration capability. Experiments manifest that our proposed AdcSR achieves\ncompetitive recovery quality on both synthetic and real-world datasets,\noffering up to 9.3$\\times$ speedup over previous one-step diffusion-based\nmethods.

The main\nresult of this work describes the structure of all \\emph{normalized\nintersection models} of circular-arc graphs. Normalized models of a\ncircular-arc graph reflect the neighborhood relation between its vertices and\ncan be seen as its canonical representations; in particular, any intersection\nmodel can be made normalized by possibly extending some of its arcs. We~devise\na data-structure, called \\emph{PQM-tree}, that maintains the set of all\nnormalized models of a circular-arc graph. We show that the PQM-tree of a\ncircular-arc graph can be computed in linear time. Finally, basing on\nPQM-trees, we provide a linear-time algorithm for the canonization and the\nisomorphism problem for circular-arc graphs.\n  We describe the structure of the normalized models of circular-arc graphs\nusing an approach proposed by Hsu~[\\emph{SIAM J.

In the aforementioned work, Hsu claimed the construction of\ndecomposition trees representing the set of all normalized intersection models\nof circular-arc graphs and an $\\mathcal{O}(nm)$ time isomorphism algorithm for\nthis class of graphs. However, the counterexample given in~[\\emph{Discrete\nMath. Theor. Comput. Sci., 15(1), 157--182, 2013}] shows that Hsu's isomorphism\nalgorithm is incorrect. Also, in a companion paper we show that the\ndecomposition trees proposed by Hsu are not constructed correctly; in\nparticular, we showed that there are circular-arc graphs whose all normalized\nmodels do not follow the description given by Hsu.",

    "abstract": "The Kerr spacetime is one of the most widely known solutions to Einstein's\nvacuum field equations and is commonly used to describe a black hole with mass\n$m$ and spin $a$. Astrophysical observations in the electromagnetic spectrum as\nwell as detected gravitational wave signals indicate that it can be used to\ndescribe the spacetime around candidates for rotating black holes. While the\ngeodesic structure of the Kerr spacetime is already well known for decades,\nusing exact analytic solutions to the equations of motion for applications to\nastrophysical problems has only attracted attention relatively recently. Here,\nthese applications mainly focus on predicting observations for the shadow, the\nphoton rings, and characteristic structures in the accretion disk. Using the\nexact analytic solutions to investigate exact gravitational lensing of light\nand gravitational waves emitted by sources outside the accretion disk has only\nreceived limited attention so far. Therefore, the focus of this paper will be\nto address this question. For this purpose we assume that we have a standard\nobserver in the domain of outer communication. We introduce a local orthonormal\ntetrad to relate the constants of motion of light rays and high-frequency\ngravitational waves detected by the observer to latitude-longitude coordinates\non the observer's celestial sphere. In this parameterisation we derive the\nradius coordinates of the photon orbits and their latitudinal projections onto\nthe observer's celestial sphere as functions of the celestial longitude. We use\nthe latitude-longitude coordinates to classify the different types of motion,\nand solve the equations of motion analytically using elementary and Jacobi's\nelliptic functions as well as Legendre's elliptic integrals. We use the\nanalytic solutions to write down an exact lens equation, and to calculate the\nredshift and the travel time.",

However, this comes at the cost of losing accuracy close to\ncritical points in the systems dynamics and an inability to capture\ncorrelations in the system. In this work, we introduce a tunable approximation\nscheme for Markovian spreading models on networks based on Matrix Product\nStates (MPS). By controlling the bond dimensions of the MPS, we can investigate\nthe effective dimensionality needed to accurately represent the exact $2^n$\ndimensional steady-state distribution. We introduce the entanglement entropy as\na measure of the compressibility of the system and find that it peaks just\nafter the phase transition on the disordered side, in line with the intuition\nthat more complex states are at the 'edge of chaos'. We compare the accuracy of\nthe MPS with exact methods on different types of small random networks and with\nMarkov Chain Monte Carlo methods for a simplified version of the railway\nnetwork of the Netherlands with 55 nodes. The MPS provides a systematic way to\ntune the accuracy of the approximation by reducing the dimensionality of the\nsystems state vector, leading to an improvement over second-order mean-field\napproximations for sufficiently large bond dimensions.",

    "abstract": "Super-resolution (SR) is a key technique for improving the visual quality of\nvideo content by increasing its spatial resolution while reconstructing fine\ndetails. SR has been employed in many applications including video streaming,\nwhere compressed low-resolution content is typically transmitted to end users\nand then reconstructed with a higher resolution and enhanced quality. To\nsupport real-time playback, it is important to implement fast SR models while\npreserving reconstruction quality; however most existing solutions, in\nparticular those based on complex deep neural networks, fail to do so. To\naddress this issue, this paper proposes a low-complexity SR method, RTSR,\ndesigned to enhance the visual quality of compressed video content, focusing on\nresolution up-scaling from a) 360p to 1080p and from b) 540p to 4K. The\nproposed approach utilizes a CNN-based network architecture, which was\noptimized for AV1 (SVT)-encoded content at various quantization levels based on\na dual-teacher knowledge distillation method. This method was submitted to the\nAIM 2024 Video Super-Resolution Challenge, specifically targeting the\nEfficient/Mobile Real-Time Video Super-Resolution competition. It achieved the\nbest trade-off between complexity and coding performance (measured in PSNR,\nSSIM and VMAF) among all six submissions. The code will be available soon.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the fracture mechanisms in composite materials across scales,\nfrom nano- to micro-scales, is essential for an in-depth understanding of the\nreinforcement mechanisms and designing the next generation of lightweight,\nhigh-strength composites. However, conventional methods struggle to model the\ncomplex fracture behavior of nanocomposites, particularly at the fiber-matrix\ninterface. The phase-field regularized cohesive fracture model has proven to be\neffective in simulating crack initiation, branching, and propagation; however,\ncapturing the cohesive fracture strength at smaller scales remains a\nsignificant challenge. This study introduces a novel approach that combines an\nenergy-based star-convex decomposition cohesive phase-field fracture model with\nmolecular dynamics simulations to explore the thickness dependency of\nnanocomposite mechanical properties. The proposed framework enables\nhierarchical modeling of carbon-nitride nanosheet-reinforced composites'\nmechanical and fracture behaviors.

A\nsystematic assessment of their combined influence on analytical accuracy and\nefficiency is notably lacking. The present work offers a comprehensive\ncomparative study, employing a scalable case study in computational mechanics\nfocused on the inference of spatially varying material parameters, that sheds\nlight on the impact of methodological choices for surrogate modelling and\nsampling. We show that a priori training of the surrogate model introduces\nlarge errors in the posterior estimation even in low to moderate dimensions. We\nintroduce a simple active learning strategy based on the path of the MCMC\nalgorithm that is superior to all a priori trained models, and determine its\ntraining data requirements. We demonstrate that the choice of the MCMC\nalgorithm has only a small influence on the amount of training data but no\nsignificant influence on the accuracy of the resulting surrogate model.\nFurther, we show that the accuracy of the posterior estimation largely depends\non the surrogate model, but not even a tailored surrogate guarantees\nconvergence of the MCMC.Finally, we identify the forward model as the\nbottleneck in the inference process, not the MCMC algorithm. While related\nworks focus on employing advanced MCMC algorithms, we demonstrate that the\ntraining data requirements render the surrogate modelling approach infeasible\nbefore the benefits of these gradient-based MCMC algorithms on cheap models can\nbe reaped.",

However, prior evaluation methods for implicit graph generative\nmodels have focused on validating statistics computed from the thick support\n(e.g., mean and variance of a graph property). Therefore, there is a mismatch\nbetween the goal of generating novel graphs and the evaluation methods. To\naddress this evaluation gap, we design a novel evaluation method called\nVertical Validation (VV) that systematically creates thin support regions\nduring the train-test splitting procedure and then reweights generated samples\nso that they can be compared to the held-out test data. This procedure can be\nseen as a generalization of the standard train-test procedure except that the\nsplits are dependent on sample features.

Likewise, $\\theta$-chains, i.e., chains at the transition from a\nswollen coil to a globular phase, are also thought to behave like ideal chains,\nas attractive forces are counterbalanced by repulsive entropic contributions.\nWhile the simple mapping to an equivalent Kuhn chain works rather well in most\nscenarios with corrections to scaling, random walks do not accurately capture\nthe topology and knots particularly for flexible chains. In this paper, we\ndemonstrate with Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations that chains in\npolymer melts and $\\theta$-chains not only agree on a structural level for a\nrange of stiffnesses, but also topologically. They exhibit similar knotting\nprobabilities and knot sizes, both of which are not captured by ideal chain\nrepresentations. This discrepancy comes from the suppression of small knots in\nreal chains, which is strongest for very flexible chains because excluded\nvolume effects are still active locally and become weaker with increasing\nsemiflexibility. Our findings suggest that corrections to ideal behavior are\nindeed similar for the two scenarios of real chains and that structure and\ntopology of a chain in a melt can be approximately reproduced by a\ncorresponding $\\theta$-chain.",

Three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations have shown that this disk\nwas optically thick and significantly heated to very high temperatures due to\nthe intense radiation emitted by the hot, young planet. Analyzing the impact of\nJupiter's radiative heating and shadowing on the structure of the\ncircumplanetary disk can provide valuable insights into the conditions that\nshaped the formation of the Galilean moons. To assess the impact of Jupiter's\nradiative heating and shadowing, we have developed a two-dimensional\nquasi-stationary circumplanetary disk model and used a grey atmosphere\nradiative transfer method to determine the thermal structure of the disk. We\nfind that the circumplanetary disk self-shadowing has a significant effect,\nwith a temperature drop of approximately 100 K in the shadowed zone compared to\nthe surrounding areas. This shadowed zone, located around 10 Jupiter radii, can\nact as a cold trap for volatile species such as NH$_3$, CO$_2$ and H$_2$S. The\nexistence of these shadows in Jupiter's circumplanetary disk may have\ninfluenced the composition of the building blocks of the Galilean moons,\npotentially shaping their formation and characteristics.

Our dual-stage\nrecognition approach achieves new top scores in Ge'ez handwriting recognition,\noutperforming eight state-of-the-art methods, which are SVTR, ASTER, and others\nas well as human performance, as measured in the HHD-Ethiopic dataset work.\nThis research significantly advances the preservation and accessibility of\nGe'ez cultural heritage, with implications for historical document\ndigitization, educational tools, and cultural preservation. The code will be\nreleased upon acceptance.",

To effectively reduce high-order,\ninterconnected models, it is usually not sufficient to consider the subsystems\nseparately. Instead, structure-preserving reduction methods should be employed,\nwhich consider the interconnected dynamics to select which subsystem dynamics\nto retain in reduction. However, structure-preserving methods are often not\ncomputationally tractable. To overcome this issue, we propose to connect each\nsubsystem model to a low-order abstraction of its environment to reduce it both\neffectively and efficiently. By means of a high-fidelity structural-dynamics\nmodel from the lithography industry, we show, on the one hand, significantly\nincreased accuracy with respect to standard subsystem reduction and, on the\nother hand, similar accuracy to direct application of expensive\nstructure-preserving methods, while significantly reducing computational cost.\nFurthermore, we formulate a systematic approach to automatically determine\nsufficient abstraction and reduction orders to preserve stability and guarantee\na given frequency-dependent error specification. We apply this approach to the\nlithography equipment use case and show that the environment model can indeed\nbe reduced by over 80\\% without significant loss in the accuracy of the reduced\ninterconnected model.",

But GNSS positioning with DPE is mostly\nleft unapplied commercially, and continuing research into DPE has remained\nrelatively stagnant over the past few years. To encourage further research on\nDPE by the GNSS community, we propose a DPE plug-in module that can be\nintegrated into the conventional 2SP software-defined receivers (SDRs).\nProgrammed in MATLAB, the proposed DPE plug-in module is aimed for better\nunderstanding and familiarity of a practical implementation of DPE. Its plug-in\nmodule architecture allows it to be incorporated with 2SP MATLAB SDRs, both\nvector tracking and scalar tracking with minimum changes, making it easy to\nuse, and provides greater flexibility for researchers using various 2SP SDRs.\nWe propose to further improve the performance of DPE against MP by\nincorporating Multipath Mitigation Technology (MMT) into DPE.

Tactile sensing arrays provide rich contact\ninformation across the manipulator's surface. However their implementation\nfaces two main challenges: accurate force estimation across complex surfaces\nlike robotic hands, and integration of these estimates into reactive control\nloops. We present a data-efficient calibration method that enables rapid,\nfull-array force estimation across varying geometries, providing online\nfeedback that accounts for non-linearities and deformation effects. Our force\nestimation model serves as feedback in an online closed-loop control system for\ninteraction force tracking. The accuracy of our estimates is independently\nvalidated against measurements from a calibrated force-torque sensor. Using the\nAllegro Hand equipped with Xela uSkin sensors, we demonstrate precise force\napplication through an admittance control loop running at 100Hz, achieving up\nto 0.12+/-0.08 [N] error margin-results that show promising potential for\ndexterous manipulation.",

    "abstract": "We present the first sublinear-in-$n$ round algorithm for sampling an\napproximately uniform spanning tree of an $n$-vertex graph in the\nCongestedClique model of distributed computing. In particular, our algorithm\nrequires $\\Tilde{O}(n^{0.657})$ rounds for sampling a spanning tree within\ntotal variation distance $1/n^c$, for arbitrary constant $c > 0$, from the\nuniform distribution. More precisely, our algorithm requires $\\Tilde{O}(n^{1/2\n+ \\alpha})$ rounds, where $O(n^\\alpha)$ is the running time of matrix\nmultiplication in the CongestedClique model (currently $\\alpha = 1 - 2/\\omega =\n0.157$, where $\\omega$ is the sequential matrix multiplication time exponent).\nWe can adapt our algorithm to give exact rather than approximate samples, but\nwith a larger, though still $o(n)$, runtime of $\\Tilde{O}(n^{2/3+\\alpha}) =\nO(n^{.824})$.\n  In a remarkable result, Aldous (SIDM 1990) and Broder (FOCS 1989) showed that\nthe first visit edge to each vertex, excluding the start vertex, during a\nrandom walk forms a uniformly chosen spanning tree of the underlying graph. Our\nalgorithm is a significant departure from known techniques, featuring a\ntop-down walk filling approach paired with Schur complement graphs for walk\nshortcutting. To make this idea work in the CongestedClique model, we present a\nnovel compressed random walk reconstruction algorithm, based on randomly\nsampling a weighted perfect matching.\n  In addition, we show how to take somewhat shorter random walks even more\nefficiently in the CongestedClique model, obtaining an $O(\\log^3 n)$-round\nalgorithm for uniformly sampling spanning trees from graphs with $O(n\\log n)$\ncover times. These results are obtained by adding a load balancing component to\nthe random walk algorithm of Bahmani, Chakrabarti and Xin (SIGMOD 2011) that\nuses the bottom-up ``doubling'' technique.",

In this, every sampling process has a\nmechanical analogue. Consequently, the divide between ensembles of samplers in\nparameter space and sampling from a mechanical system in thermodynamic\nequilibrium would be artificial. Based on this realisation, we construct a\ncontinuous modelling of a Bayes update akin to a transition between\nthermodynamic ensembles.

We propose one way to transfer the vocabulary and the\nformalism of thermodynamics (energy, work, heat) and statistical mechanics\n(partition functions) to statistical inference, starting from Bayes' law.\nDifferent kinds of inference processes are discussed and relative entropies are\nshown to follow from suitably constructed partitions as an analytical\nformulation of sampling processes.

The rapid developing\nthin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) platform, for its numerous advantages\nincluding high electro-optic coefficient and scalability, is well compatible\nwith the realization of synthetic dimensions in the frequency together with\nspatial domain. While coupling resonators with fixed beam splitters is a common\nexperimental approach, it often lacks tunability and limits coupling between\nadjacent lattices to sites occupying the same frequency domain positions. Here,\non the contrary, we conceive the resonator arrays connected by electro-optic\ntunable Mach-Zehnder interferometers in our configuration instead of fixed beam\nsplitters. By applying bias voltage and RF modulation on the interferometers,\nour design extends such coupling to long-range scenario and allows for\ncontinuous tuning on each coupling strength and synthetic effective magnetic\nflux. Therefore, our design enriches controllable coupling types that are\nessential for building programmable lattice networks and significantly\nincreases versatility. As the example, we experimentally fabricate a\ntwo-resonator prototype on the TFLN platform, and on this single chip we\nrealize well-known models including tight-binding lattices, topological Hall\nladder and Creutz ladder. We directly observe the band structures in the\nquasi-momentum space and important phenomena such as spin-momentum locking and\nthe Aharonov-Bohm cage effect.

The presence of FST enhances the magnitude of\nthe loads acting on the cylinder. This results from a decreased vortex\nformation length, increased coherence of regular vortex shedding, and energy\nassociated with this flow structure in the near-wake.

    "abstract": "The scaling law is a notable property of neural network models and has\nsignificantly propelled the development of large language models. Scaling laws\nhold great promise in guiding model design and resource allocation. Recent\nresearch increasingly shows that scaling laws are not limited to NLP tasks or\nTransformer architectures; they also apply to domains such as recommendation.\nHowever, there is still a lack of literature on scaling law research in online\nadvertisement retrieval systems. This may be because 1) identifying the scaling\nlaw for resource cost and online revenue is often expensive in both time and\ntraining resources for large-scale industrial applications, and 2) varying\nsettings for different systems prevent the scaling law from being applied\nacross various scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a lightweight\nparadigm to identify the scaling law of online revenue and machine cost for a\ncertain online advertisement retrieval scenario with a low experimental cost.\nSpecifically, we focus on a sole factor (FLOPs) and propose an offline metric\nnamed R/R* that exhibits a high linear correlation with online revenue for\nretrieval models. We estimate the machine cost offline via a simulation\nalgorithm. Thus, we can transform most online experiments into low-cost offline\nexperiments. We conduct comprehensive experiments to verify the effectiveness\nof our proposed metric R/R* and to identify the scaling law in the online\nadvertisement retrieval system of Kuaishou. With the scaling law, we\ndemonstrate practical applications for ROI-constrained model designing and\nmulti-scenario resource allocation in Kuaishou advertising system. To the best\nof our knowledge, this is the first work to study the scaling laws for online\nadvertisement retrieval of real-world systems, showing great potential for\nscaling law in advertising system optimization.",

    "abstract": "While WISE is the largest, best quality infrared all-sky survey to date, a\nsmaller coverage mission, Spitzer, was designed to have better sensitivity and\nspatial resolution at similar wavelengths. Confusion and contamination in WISE\ndata result in discrepancies between them. We present a novel approach to work\nwith WISE measurements with the goal of maintaining both its high coverage and\nvast amount of data while taking full advantage of the higher sensitivity and\nspatial resolution of Spitzer. We have applied machine learning (ML) techniques\nto a complete WISE data sample of open cluster members, using a training set of\npaired data from high-quality Spitzer Enhanced Imaging Products (SEIP), MIPS\nand IRAC, and allWISE catalogs, W1 (3.4 {\\mu}m) to W4 (22 {\\mu}m) bands. We\nhave tested several ML regression models with the aim of predicting\nmid-infrared fluxes at MIPS1 (24 {\\mu}m) and IRAC4 (8 {\\mu}m) bands from WISE\nfluxes and quality flags. In addition, to improve the prediction quality, we\nhave implemented feature selection techniques to remove irrelevant WISE\nvariables. We have notably enhanced WISE detection capabilities, mostly at\nlowest magnitudes, which previously showed the largest discrepancies with\nSpitzer. In our particular case, extremely randomized trees was found to be the\nbest algorithm to predict mid-infrared fluxes from WISE variables. We have\ntested our results in the SED of members of IC 348. We show discrepancies in\nthe measurements of Spitzer and WISE and demonstrate the good concordance of\nour predicted fluxes with the real ones. ML is a fast and powerful tool that\ncan be used to find hidden relationships between datasets, as the ones that\nexist between WISE and Spitzer fluxes. We believe this approach could be\nemployed for other samples from the allWISE catalog with SEIP positional\ncounterparts, and in other astrophysical studies with analogous discrepancies.",

We determine shear\nstrain to be the origin of this new structure, which can readily result in\nshifts of neighboring atomic chains because of the weak inter-chain bonding.\nFor the observed $b/3$ structure, the (residual) atomic chain shift corresponds\nto an in-plane shear strain of $\\gamma\\approx7.5\\%$.

In this work,\nwe focus on the task of few-shot personalized localization, where a model is\ngiven a small set of annotated images (in-context examples) -- each with a\ncategory label and bounding box -- and is tasked with localizing the same\nobject type in a query image. Personalized localization can be particularly\nimportant in cases of ambiguity of several related objects that can respond to\na text or an object that is hard to describe with words. To provoke\npersonalized localization abilities in models, we present a data-centric\nsolution that fine-tunes them using carefully curated data from video object\ntracking datasets. By leveraging sequences of frames tracking the same object\nacross multiple shots, we simulate instruction-tuning dialogues that promote\ncontext awareness. To reinforce this, we introduce a novel regularization\ntechnique that replaces object labels with pseudo-names, ensuring the model\nrelies on visual context rather than prior knowledge. Our method significantly\nenhances the few-shot localization performance of recent VLMs ranging from 7B\nto 72B in size, without sacrificing generalization, as demonstrated on several\nbenchmarks tailored towards evaluating personalized localization abilities.\nThis work is the first to explore and benchmark personalized few-shot\nlocalization for VLMs -- exposing critical weaknesses in present-day VLMs, and\nlaying a foundation for future research in context-driven vision-language\napplications.",

Our analysis\nreveals significant deviations in the behavior of the Innermost Stable Circular\nOrbit (ISCO) due to quantum effects. In the first effective metric, as $\\zeta$\nincreases, the ISCO's radial position shifts, and for sufficiently large values\nof $\\zeta$ (greater than 4.55), the ISCO disappears, allowing particles to\nhover above the black hole or oscillate radially.

However, there are a variety of steps and decisions for database\ndevelopment that can fall outside astronomy expertise. Here we offer\ngeneralized discussions on design and process that are accompanied by\nreal-world examples from the SpExoDisks developer team and website. Starting\nfrom the database portal design and data organization, we demonstrate on-demand\ndata distribution and query using publicly accessible database software. These\nsystems support interactive visualizations such that users can explore spectra\ndirectly from their browsers. We also offer details that show how the technical\nconcepts in SpExoDisks are implemented, particularly emphasizing sustainability\nand long-term management of the codebase and processes.

Unlike conventional diagonal RISs (D-RISs), which suffer\nfrom limited beamforming capability, a BD-RIS provides enhanced control over\nboth phase and amplitude, significantly improving localization accuracy. By\nconducting a comprehensive Cram\\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) analysis across\nvarious system parameters in both near-field and far-field scenarios, we\nestablish the BD-RIS structure as a competitive alternative to traditional\nactive antenna arrays. Our results reveal that BD-RISs achieve near active\nantenna arrays performance in localization precision, overcoming the\nlimitations of D-RISs and underscoring its potential for high-accuracy\npositioning in future communication networks. This work envisions the use of\nBD-RIS for enabling passive beamforming-based localization, setting the stage\nfor more efficient and scalable localization strategies in sixth-generation\nnetworks and beyond.",

    "abstract": "We quantify the topological expansion properties of bounded degree simplicial\ncomplexes in terms of a family of sublinear functions, in analogy with the\nseparation profile of Benjamini-Schramm-Tim\\'ar for classical expansion of\nbounded degree graphs. We prove that, like the separation profile, these new\ninvariants are monotone under regular maps between complexes satisfying\nappropriate higher connectivity assumptions. In the dimension $1$ case, we\nrecover the cutwidth profile of Huang-Hume-Kelly-Lam. We also prove the\nseemingly new result that any $1$-dimensional topological expander necessarily\ncontains a graphical expander.\n  In higher dimensions, we give full calculations of these new invariants for\nEuclidean spaces, which are natural analogues of waist and width-volume\ninequalities due to Gromov and Guth respectively. We present several other\nmethods of obtaining upper bounds including na\\\"ive (yet useful) direct product\nand fibring theorems, and show how lower bounds can be obtained via thick\nembeddings of complexes, in analogy with previous work of Barrett-Hume. Using\nthis, we find lower bounds for $k$-expansion of $(k+1)$-fold horocyclic\nproducts of trees, and for rank $k$ symmetric spaces of non-compact type. As a\nfurther application, we prove that for every $k\\geq 2$ there is no coarse\nembedding (and more generally, no regular map) from the $k$-fold horocyclic\nproduct of $3$-regular trees to either any product $(\\mathbb{H}^2)^{k-2}\\times\nH \\times D$ where $\\mathbb{H}^2$ is the real hyperbolic plane, $H$ is a bounded\ndegree hyperbolic graph and $D$ is a doubling metric space, or to any symmetric\nspace whose non-compact factor has corank (dimension minus rank) is strictly\nless than $k$.",

Traditional frameworks, such as\nParticleSfM~\\cite{zhao2022particlesfm}, address this problem by sequentially\ncomputing the optical flow between adjacent frames to obtain point\ntrajectories. They then remove dynamic trajectories through motion segmentation\nand perform global bundle adjustment. However, the process of estimating\noptical flow between two adjacent frames and chaining the matches can introduce\ncumulative errors. Additionally, motion segmentation combined with single-view\ndepth estimation often faces challenges related to scale ambiguity. To tackle\nthese challenges, we propose a dynamic-aware tracking any point (DATAP) method\nthat leverages consistent video depth and point tracking. Specifically, our\nDATAP addresses these issues by estimating dense point tracking across the\nvideo sequence and predicting the visibility and dynamics of each point. By\nincorporating the consistent video depth prior, the performance of motion\nsegmentation is enhanced. With the integration of DATAP, it becomes possible to\nestimate and optimize all camera poses simultaneously by performing global\nbundle adjustments for point tracking classified as static and visible, rather\nthan relying on incremental camera registration. Extensive experiments on\ndynamic sequences, e.g., Sintel and TUM RGBD dynamic sequences, and on the wild\nvideo, e.g., DAVIS, demonstrate that the proposed method achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in terms of camera pose estimation even in complex\ndynamic challenge scenes.",

To address this limitation-and\ndue to the prohibitive cost and slow pace of human annotation for video\ntasks-we introduce VideoAutoArena, an arena-style benchmark inspired by LMSYS\nChatbot Arena's framework, designed to automatically assess LMMs' video\nanalysis abilities. VideoAutoArena utilizes user simulation to generate\nopen-ended, adaptive questions that rigorously assess model performance in\nvideo understanding. The benchmark features an automated, scalable evaluation\nframework, incorporating a modified ELO Rating System for fair and continuous\ncomparisons across multiple LMMs. To validate our automated judging system, we\nconstruct a 'gold standard' using a carefully curated subset of human\nannotations, demonstrating that our arena strongly aligns with human judgment\nwhile maintaining scalability.

We propose a novel\nnormalizing flow based infinite-dimensional variational inference method\n(NF-iVI) to extract posterior information efficiently. Specifically, by\nintroducing well-defined transformations, the prior in Bayes' formula is\ntransformed into post-transformed measures that approximate the true posterior.\nTo circumvent the issue of mutually singular probability measures, we formulate\ngeneral conditions for the employed transformations. As guiding principles,\nthese conditions yield four concrete transformations. Additionally, to minimize\ncomputational demands, we have developed a conditional normalizing flow\nvariant, termed CNF-iVI, which is adept at processing measurement data of\nvarying dimensions while requiring minimal computational resources. We apply\nthe proposed algorithms to two typical inverse problems governed by a simple\nsmooth equation and the steady-state Darcy flow equation.

However, in\nparticle-hole-symmetric systems, electric current and momentum flow are\nentirely decoupled because electrons and holes move in opposite directions with\nequal distribution functions. This makes it challenging to link NS equations to\nobserved flow patterns. In this work, we demonstrate that the hydrodynamic\nbehavior of the charge current at half filling can emerge despite the absence\nof momentum flow.

Our method does not\nrequire any prior information about the observed SB profile or a detailed\nfitting of the PSF, making it ideal for the automatic analysis of large galaxy\nsamples.

To solve\nthe associated pALM subproblems, efficient methods such as Newton-type methods\nare essential. Consequently, the effectiveness of the inexact pALM hinges on\nthe error criteria used to control the inexactness when solving these\nsubproblems. However, existing inexact pALMs either rely on absolute-type error\ncriteria (which may complicate implementation by necessitating the\npre-specification of an infinite sequence of error tolerance parameters) or\nrequire an additional correction step when using relative error criteria (which\ncan potentially slow down the convergence of the pALM). To address this\ndeficiency, this paper proposes ripALM, a relative-type inexact pALM, which can\nsimplify practical implementation while preserving the appealing convergence\nproperties of the classical absolute-type inexact pALM. We emphasize that\nripALM is the first relative-type inexact version of the vanilla pALM with\nprovable convergence guarantees. Numerical experiments on quadratically\nregularized optimal transport (OT) problems demonstrate the competitive\nefficiency of the proposed method compared to existing methods.

Then, we explore real-world applications of LLMs in\nhuman-centric domains such as behavioral science, political science, and\nsociology, assessing their effectiveness in replicating human behaviors and\ninteractions. Finally, we identify challenges and future research directions,\nsuch as improving LLM adaptability, emotional intelligence, and cultural\nsensitivity, while addressing inherent biases and enhancing frameworks for\nhuman-AI collaboration.

One step of the cryo-EM\npipeline involves solving an inverse-problem. This inverse-problem, referred to\nas \\textit{ab-initio} single-particle reconstruction, takes as input a\ncollection of 2d-images -- each a projection of a molecule from an unknown\nviewing-angle -- and attempts to reconstruct the 3d-volume representing the\nunderlying molecular density.\n  Most methods for solving this inverse-problem search for a solution which\noptimizes a posterior likelihood of generating the observed image-data, given\nthe reconstructed volume. Within this framework, it is natural to study the\nHessian of the log-likelihood: the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the Hessian\ndetermine how the likelihood changes with respect to perturbations in the\nsolution, and can give insight into the sensitivity of the solution to aspects\nof the input.\n  In this paper we describe a simple strategy for estimating the smallest\neigenvalues and eigenvectors (i.e., the `softest modes') of the Hessian of the\nlog-likelihood for the \\textit{ab-initio} single-particle reconstruction\nproblem. This strategy involves rewriting the log-likelihood as a 3d-integral.\nThis interpretation holds in the low-noise limit, as well as in many practical\nscenarios which allow for noise-marginalization.\n  Once we have estimated the softest modes, we can use them to perform many\nkinds of sensitivity analysis. For example, we can determine which parts of the\nreconstructed volume are trustworthy, and which are unreliable, and how this\nunreliability might depend on the data-set and the imaging parameters. We\nbelieve that this kind of analysis can be used alongside more traditional\nstrategies for sensitivity analysis, as well as in other applications, such as\nfree-energy estimation.",

However, due to the small scale of infrared small\ntarget datasets and the limited number of pixels occupied by the targets\nthemselves, it is a challenging task for deep learning methods to directly\nlearn from these samples. Utilizing human expert knowledge to assist deep\nlearning methods in better learning is worthy of exploration. To effectively\nguide the model to focus on targets' spatial features, this paper proposes the\nLocal Contrast Attention Enhanced infrared small target detection Network\n(LCAE-Net), combining prior knowledge with data-driven deep learning methods.\nLCAE-Net is a U-shaped neural network model which consists of two developed\nmodules: a Local Contrast Enhancement (LCE) module and a Channel Attention\nEnhancement (CAE) module. The LCE module takes advantages of prior knowledge,\nleveraging handcrafted convolution operator to acquire Local Contrast Attention\n(LCA), which could realize background suppression while enhance the potential\ntarget region, thus guiding the neural network to pay more attention to\npotential infrared small targets' location information. To effectively utilize\nthe response information throughout downsampling progresses, the CAE module is\nproposed to achieve the information fusion among feature maps' different\nchannels. Experimental results indicate that our LCAE-Net outperforms existing\nstate-of-the-art methods on the three public datasets NUDT-SIRST, NUAA-SIRST,\nand IRSTD-1K, and its detection speed could reach up to 70 fps.

    "abstract": "The standardization of an interface for dense linear algebra operations in\nthe BLAS standard has enabled interoperability between different linear algebra\nlibraries, thereby boosting the success of scientific computing, in particular\nin scientific HPC. Despite numerous efforts in the past, the community has not\nyet agreed on a standardization for sparse linear algebra operations due to\nnumerous reasons. One is the fact that sparse linear algebra objects allow for\nmany different storage formats, and different hardware may favor different\nstorage formats. This makes the definition of a FORTRAN-style all-circumventing\ninterface extremely challenging. Another reason is that opposed to dense linear\nalgebra functionality, in sparse linear algebra, the size of the sparse data\nstructure for the operation result is not always known prior to the\ninformation. Furthermore, as opposed to the standardization effort for dense\nlinear algebra, we are late in the technology readiness cycle, and many\nproduction-ready software libraries using sparse linear algebra routines have\nimplemented and committed to their own sparse BLAS interface. At the same time,\nthere exists a demand for standardization that would improve interoperability,\nand sustainability, and allow for easier integration of building blocks. In an\ninclusive, cross-institutional effort involving numerous academic institutions,\nUS National Labs, and industry, we spent two years designing a\nhardware-portable interface for basic sparse linear algebra functionality that\nserves the user needs and is compatible with the different interfaces currently\nused by different vendors.

In the extensive\nexperimental evaluation conducted using a real-world dataset, we demonstrate\nthat the embeddings generated by our methodology effectively capture urban\ncharacteristics. Specifically, our embeddings are compared against those of a\nstate-of-the-art competitor across two downstream tasks. Additionally, through\nclustering techniques, we investigate how well the embeddings produced by our\nmethodology capture the temporal dynamics and characteristics of the underlying\nurban regions. Overall, this work highlights the potential of service-specific\nmobile traffic data for urban research and emphasizes the importance of making\nsuch data accessible to support public innovation.",

    "abstract": "Deployment of machine learning algorithms into real-world practice is still a\ndifficult task. One of the challenges lies in the unpredictable variability of\ninput data, which may differ significantly among individual users,\ninstitutions, scanners, etc. The input data variability can be decreased by\nusing suitable data preprocessing with robust data harmonization. In this\npaper, we present a method of image harmonization using Cumulative Distribution\nFunction (CDF) matching based on curve fitting. This approach does not ruin\nlocal variability and individual important features. The transformation of\nimage intensities is non-linear but still ``smooth and elastic\", as compared to\nother known histogram matching algorithms. Non-linear transformation allows for\na very good match to the template. At the same time, elasticity constraints\nhelp to preserve local variability among individual inputs, which may encode\nimportant features for subsequent machine-learning processing. The pre-defined\ntemplate CDF offers a better and more intuitive control for the input data\ntransformation compared to other methods, especially ML-based ones. Even though\nwe demonstrate our method for MRI images, the method is generic enough to apply\nto other types of imaging data.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale 2D datasets have been instrumental in advancing machine learning;\nhowever, progress in 3D vision tasks has been relatively slow. This disparity\nis largely due to the limited availability of 3D benchmarking datasets. In\nparticular, creating real-world point cloud datasets for indoor scene semantic\nsegmentation presents considerable challenges, including data collection within\nconfined spaces and the costly, often inaccurate process of per-point labeling\nto generate ground truths. While synthetic datasets address some of these\nchallenges, they often fail to replicate real-world conditions, particularly\nthe occlusions that occur in point clouds collected from real environments.\nExisting 3D benchmarking datasets typically evaluate deep learning models under\nthe assumption that training and test data are independently and identically\ndistributed (IID), which affects the models' usability for real-world point\ncloud segmentation. To address these challenges, we introduce the BelHouse3D\ndataset, a new synthetic point cloud dataset designed for 3D indoor scene\nsemantic segmentation. This dataset is constructed using real-world references\nfrom 32 houses in Belgium, ensuring that the synthetic data closely aligns with\nreal-world conditions. Additionally, we include a test set with data occlusion\nto simulate out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios, reflecting the occlusions\ncommonly encountered in real-world point clouds. We evaluate popular\npoint-based semantic segmentation methods using our OOD setting and present a\nbenchmark.

Our findings indicate that while most GRB-SNe share\ncommon physical characteristics, a few outliers, notably SNe 2010ma and 2011kl,\nexhibit distinct features. These events suggest potential differences in\nprogenitor properties or explosion mechanisms, offering deeper insight into the\ndiversity of GRB-SNe and their central engines.",

    "abstract": "As one of the most prevalent diseases worldwide, plaque formation in human\narteries, known as atherosclerosis, is the focus of many research efforts.\nPreviously, molecular communication (MC) models have been proposed to capture\nand analyze the natural processes inside the human body and to support the\ndevelopment of diagnosis and treatment methods. In the future, synthetic MC\nnetworks are envisioned to span the human body as part of the Internet of\nBio-Nano Things (IoBNT), turning blood vessels into physical communication\nchannels. By observing and characterizing changes in these channels, MC\nnetworks could play an active role in detecting diseases like atherosclerosis.\nIn this paper, building on previous preliminary work for simulating an MC\nscenario in a plaque-obstructed blood vessel, we evaluate different analytical\nmodels for non-Newtonian flow and derive associated channel impulse responses\n(CIRs). Additionally, we add the crucial factor of flow pulsatility to our\nsimulation model and investigate the effect of the systole-diastole cycle on\nthe received particles across the plaque channel. We observe a significant\ninfluence of the plaque on the channel in terms of the flow profile and CIR\nacross different emission times in the cycle. These metrics could act as\ncrucial indicators for early non-invasive plaque detection in advanced future\nMC methods.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we develop and implement an efficient asymptotic-preserving\n(AP) scheme to solve the gas mixture of Boltzmann equations under the disparate\nmass scaling relevant to the so-called \"epochal relaxation\" phenomenon. The\ndisparity in molecular masses, ranging across several orders of magnitude,\nleads to significant challenges in both the evaluation of collision operators\nand the designing of time-stepping schemes to capture the multi-scale nature of\nthe dynamics. A direct implementation of the spectral method faces prohibitive\ncomputational costs as the mass ratio increases due to the need to resolve\nvastly different thermal velocities. Unlike [I. M. Gamba, S. Jin, and L. Liu,\nCommun. Math. Sci., 17 (2019), pp. 1257-1289], we propose an alternative\napproach based on proper truncation of asymptotic expansions of the collision\noperators, which significantly reduces the computational complexity and works\nwell for small $\\varepsilon$. By incorporating the separation of three time\nscales in the model's relaxation process [P. Degond and B. Lucquin-Desreux,\nMath. Models Methods Appl. Sci., 6 (1996), pp. 405-436], we design an AP scheme\nthat captures the specific dynamics of the disparate mass model while\nmaintaining computational efficiency.

The\nnonuniformity of the ground state is handled by pointwise aligning the\nquantization axis of the magnetization field operator with the classical ground\nstate. The Hamiltonian is expanded in the large spin-number limit and truncated\nto retain only terms quadratic in the components of the magnetization operator\ntransverse to the quantization axis. This quadratic Hamiltonian is used to\nderive the linear quantum Landau-Lifshitz equation. By diagonalizing this\nequation under appropriate boundary and normalization conditions, a discrete\nset of magnon creation and annihilation operators is obtained, enabling a\ncomplete description of the magnon spectrum.

This\nmodel incorporates a nonlinear friction force expressed in the general form\nf(x)={\\gamma} v(x)^{\\alpha}, where {\\gamma} is the frictional coefficient,\nwhich is fitted to data. We study this by applying voltages just below the\nbarrier height up to near break down voltages. Furthermore, by lowering the\ntemperature and adjusting the applied voltage to the junction, the effect on\ndissipation caused by the variation in barrier height is examined. We underline\nthat the crucial dependency of dissipation on the fraction of particle energy\nlost is modulated by two primary mechanisms: the application of voltage and the\nvariation of temperature. The fraction of energy dissipated decreases in\ngeneral for increasing energies of the tunneling particles at a given\ntemperature. However, for a given energy of the tunneling particle, the present\nwork demonstrates a turning point at a temperature of 137 K, after which the\ndissipated energy starts increasing for higher temperatures. The latter can\npossibly be due to the increase of electron-phonon interactions which become\npredominant over barrier height reduction at higher temperatures and hence we\nidentify T = 137 K as a critical temperature for change in dissipative\ncharacteristics of the solid-state junction under consideration. Notably, also\nthe study identifies significant changes in dissipation parameters, {\\gamma}\nand {\\alpha}, above 137 K, exhibiting a linear decline and underscoring the\nimportance of further research at higher temperatures.",

This means that Hubble tensions were\nalways present in the literature, due either to the underestimation of\nstatistical error bars associated with the observed parameter measurements, or\nto the fact that systematic errors were not properly taken into account in many\nof the measurements.\n  The fact that the underestimation of error bars for $H_0$ is so common might\nexplain the apparent 4.4-sigma discrepancy by Riess et al. As a matter of fact,\nmore recent precise $H_0$ measurements with JWST data by Freedman et al. using\nstandard candles in galaxies find there is no tension with CMBR data, possibly\nindicating that previously Riess et al. had underestimated their errors.\n  Here we have carried out a recalibration of the probabilities. The tension of\n4.4-$\\sigma $, estimated between the local Cepheid-supernova distance ladder\nand cosmic microwave background (CMB) data, is indeed a 2.1-$\\sigma $ tension\nin equivalent terms of a normal distribution, with an associated probability\n$P$ = 0.036 (1 in 28). This can be increased to an equivalent tension of\n2.5-$\\sigma $ in the worst cases of claimed 6-$\\sigma $ tension, which may in\nany case happen as a random statistical fluctuation.\n  If Hubble tensions were always present in the literature, and present day\ntensions are not more important than previous ones, why, then, is there so much\nnoise and commotion surrounding Hubble tension after 2019?

We focus\non a specific privacy risk where LLMs may help identify the authorship of\nanonymous texts, which challenges the effectiveness of anonymity in real-world\nsystems such as anonymous peer review systems. To investigate these risks, we\npresent AIDBench, a new benchmark that incorporates several author\nidentification datasets, including emails, blogs, reviews, articles, and\nresearch papers. AIDBench utilizes two evaluation methods: one-to-one\nauthorship identification, which determines whether two texts are from the same\nauthor; and one-to-many authorship identification, which, given a query text\nand a list of candidate texts, identifies the candidate most likely written by\nthe same author as the query text. We also introduce a Retrieval-Augmented\nGeneration (RAG)-based method to enhance the large-scale authorship\nidentification capabilities of LLMs, particularly when input lengths exceed the\nmodels' context windows, thereby establishing a new baseline for authorship\nidentification using LLMs. Our experiments with AIDBench demonstrate that LLMs\ncan correctly guess authorship at rates well above random chance, revealing new\nprivacy risks posed by these powerful models.

Magnetic batteries are potential sources that may drive the\ngeneration of a seed magnetic field, even if this field is initially zero.\nThese batteries can be the result of non-aligned thermodynamic gradients in a\nplasma, as well as of special and general relativistic effects.

We\nstudy the non-ideal fluid effects introduced by the energy flux in the vortical\ndynamics of a magnetized plasma in curved spacetime. We propose a novel\nmechanism for generating a heat flux-driven magnetic seed within a simple\naccretion disk model around a Schwarzschild black hole. Methods. We use the 3+1\nformalism for the splitting of the space-time metric into space-like and\ntime-like components. We study the vortical dynamics of a magnetized fluid with\na heat flux in the Schwarzschild geometry in which thermodynamic and\nhydrodynamic quantities are only dependent on the radial coordinate. Assuming\nthat the magnetic field is initially zero, we estimate linear time evolution of\nthe magnetic field due to the inclusion of non-ideal fluid effects. Results.\nWhen the thermodynamic and hydrodynamic quantities vary only radially, the\neffect of the coupling between the heat flux, spacetime curvature and fluid\nvelocity acts as the primary driver for an initial linearly time growing\nmagnetic field. The plasma heat flux completely dominates the magnetic field\ngeneration at an specific distance from the black hole, where the fluid\nvorticity vanishes. This distance depends on the thermodynamical properties of\nthe Keplerian plasma accretion disk. These properties control the strength of\nthe non-ideal effects in the generation of seed magnetic fields.",

It is a\nmodification of the classical billiard, obtained as the return map of a\nnonsmooth geodesic flow on a cylinder that has homeomorphic copies of a\nclassical billiard on the top and on the bottom (a coin). The return dynamics\nis described by a map $T$ of the annulus $\\mathbb A = \\mathbb T \\times\n(0,\\pi)$. We prove the following three main theorems: in two different\nscenarios (when the height of the coin is small, or when the coin is\nnear-circular) there is a family of KAM curves close to, but not accumulating\non, the boundary $\\partial \\mathbb A$; for any noncircular coin, if the height\nof the coin is sufficiently large, there is a neighbourhood of $\\partial\n\\mathbb A$ through which there passes no invariant essential curve; and the\nonly coin billiard for which the phase space $\\mathbb A$ is foliated by\nessential invariant curves is the circular one. These results provide partial\nanswers to questions of Bialy. Finally, we describe the results of some\nnumerical experiments on the elliptical coin billiard.",

Given the diverse range of control schemes, grid operators\nare typically provided with black-box models of IBRs from various equipment\nmanufacturers. As such, they are integrated into simulation models of the\nentire power system for analysis, and due to their nature, they can only be\nsimulated in the time domain. Other system analysis approaches, like eigenvalue\nanalysis, cannot be applied, making the comprehensive analysis of defined\nsystems more challenging.

Further\ncorrecting for the absorption of the intergalactic medium, these mean/median\nquasar SEDs constitute a surprisingly redshift-independent mean/median\ncomposite SED from the rest-frame optical down to $\\simeq 500~{\\rm \\mathring\nA}$ for quasars with bolometric luminosity brighter than $10^{45.5}~{\\rm erg\ns^{-1}}$. Moreover, the mean/median composite quasar SED is plausibly also\nindependent of black hole mass and Eddington ratio, and suggests similar\nproperties of dust and gas in the quasar host galaxies since cosmic noon. Both\nthe mean and median composite SEDs are nicely consistent with previous mean\ncomposite quasar spectra at wavelengths beyond $\\simeq 1000~{\\rm \\mathring A}$,\nbut at shorter wavelengths, are redder, indicating, on average, less ionizing\nradiation than previously expected. Through comparing the model-predicted to\nthe observed composite quasar SEDs, we favor a simply truncated disk model,\nrather than a standard thin disk model, for the quasar central engine, though\nwe request more sophisticated disk models.

We present an automated method for measuring the ISA of LLMs,\nwhich covers all 30 security topics in a mobile ISA taxonomy, using realistic\nscenarios that create tension between implicit security implications and user\nsatisfaction. Applying this method to leading LLMs, we find that most of the\npopular models exhibit only medium to low levels of ISA, exposing their users\nto cybersecurity threats.

These results reveal a widespread vulnerability affecting current LLM\ndeployments: the majority of popular models, and particularly their smaller\nvariants, may systematically endanger users.

Prior work on simultaneous communication\nand tracking assumes a colocated radar receiver at the transmitter for sensing\nmeasurements using the reflected Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC)\nsignals in the mmWave band. Full isolation between transmitter and receiver is\nrequired here to avoid self-interference. We consider the bistatic setting\nwhere the sensing receivers are not colocated and can be realized in practice\nusing traditional half-duplex transmit or receive nodes. First, we process the\nechoes reflected from the vehicle at multiple multi-antenna nodes at various\nlocations, facilitating estimation of the vehicle's current position. Then, we\npropose selection criteria for the estimates and a maximum likelihood (ML)\nfusion scheme to fuse these selected estimates based on the estimated error\ncovariance matrices of these measurements. This fusion scheme is important in\nbistatic and multistatic settings as the localization error depends\nsignificantly on the geometry of the transmitter, target, and receiver\nlocations. Finally, we predict the vehicle's next location using a simple\nkinematic equation-based model. Through extensive simulation, we study the\naverage spectral efficiency of communication with a moving user using the\nproposed simultaneous communication and tracking scheme. The proposed\nfusion-based scheme achieves almost the same average spectral efficiency as an\nideal scheme that knows the exact trajectory. We also show that the proposed\nscheme can be easily extended to systems with Hybrid Digital-Analog\narchitectures and performs similarly even in these systems.",

This paper proposes an improved method named Intensity-Spatial Dual\nMasked AutoEncoder (ISD-MAE). Based on the tissue-contrast semi-masked\nautoencoder, a Masked AutoEncoder (MAE) branch is introduced to perform\nintensity masking and spatial masking operations on chest CT images for\nmulti-scale feature learning and segmentation tasks. The model utilizes a\ndual-branch structure and contrastive learning to enhance the ability to learn\ntissue features and boundary details. Experiments are conducted on multiple 2D\nand 3D datasets. The results show that ISD-MAE significantly outperforms other\nmethods in 2D pneumonia and mediastinal tumor segmentation tasks. For example,\nthe Dice score reaches 90.10% on the COVID19 LESION dataset, and the\nperformance is relatively stable. However, there is still room for improvement\non 3D datasets. In response to this, improvement directions are proposed,\nincluding optimizing the loss function, using enhanced 3D convolution blocks,\nand processing datasets from multiple perspectives.Our code is available\nat:https://github.com/prowontheus/ISD-MAE.",

With this technique bubbles\nare injected under the hull where they then lubricate the hull, thus reducing\nthe drag of the vessel. Understanding the effects of salts on bubbly drag\nreduction is therefore of crucial importance in the application of this\ntechnique for salt waters. In this study we investigate the effects of MgCl2,\nNa2SO4, substitute sea salt, and NaCH3COO on the reduction of drag by bubbles\nin turbulent Taylor-Couette flow. We find that MgCl2, Na2SO4, and substitute\nsea salt inhibit bubble coalescence, leading to smaller bubbles in the flow,\nwhich prove to be less effective for bubbly drag reduction. For these salts we\nfind that the ionic strength is a decent indicator for the observed drag\nreduction and solutions of these salts with an ionic strength higher than I >=\n0.7 mol/l show little to no drag reduction. In contrast, NaCH3COO solutions do\nnot inhibit bubble coalescence and for this salt we even observe an enhanced\ndrag reduction with increasing salt concentration.

Specifically, we consider real-time remote\ntracking of an information source, where a device monitors its evolution and\nsends updates to a base station (BS), which is responsible for real-time source\nreconstruction and, potentially, remote actuation. To achieve this, the BS\nemploys a grant-free access mechanism to serve the monitoring device together\nwith a broadband user, which share the available wireless resources through\northogonal or non-orthogonal multiple access schemes. We analyse the\nperformance of the system with time-averaged reconstruction error,\ntime-averaged cost of actuation error, and update-delivery cost as performance\nmetrics.

This is obtained through the use of feed-forward neural\nnetworks with special attention to the architecture of the network in order to\nfulfil several physical restrictions such as objectivity, polyconvexity,\nnon-negativity, material symmetry and thermodynamic consistency. The result is\na compact neural network with few parameters that is able to reconstruct the\nhyperelastic behaviour with Mullinstype damage. The network is trained with\nartificially generated plane stress data and even correctly captures the full\n3D behaviour with much more complex loading conditions. The energy and stress\nresponses are correctly captured, as well as the evolution of the damage. The\nresulting neural network can be seamlessly implemented in widely used\nsimulation software.

    "abstract": "Advancements in computer science, artificial intelligence, and control\nsystems of the recent have catalyzed the emergence of cybernetic societies,\nwhere algorithms play a significant role in decision-making processes affecting\nthe daily life of humans in almost every aspect. Algorithmic decision-making\nexpands into almost every industry, government processes critical\ninfrastructure, and shapes the life-reality of people and the very fabric of\nsocial interactions and communication. Besides the great potentials to improve\nefficiency and reduce corruption, missspecified cybernetic systems harbor the\nthreat to create societal inequities, systematic discrimination, and dystopic,\ntotalitarian societies. Fairness is a crucial component in the design of\ncybernetic systems, to promote cooperation between selfish individuals, to\nachieve better outcomes at the system level, to confront public resistance, to\ngain trust and acceptance for rules and institutions, to perforate\nself-reinforcing cycles of poverty through social mobility, to incentivize\nmotivation, contribution and satisfaction of people through inclusion, to\nincrease social-cohesion in groups, and ultimately to improve life quality.\nQuantitative descriptions of fairness are crucial to reflect equity into\nalgorithms, but only few works in the fairness literature offer such measures;\nthe existing quantitative measures in the literature are either too\napplication-specific, suffer from undesirable characteristics, or are not\nideology-agnostic. Therefore, this work proposes a quantitative, transactional,\ndistributive fairness framework, which enables systematic design of socially\nfeasible decision-making systems. Moreover, it emphasizes the importance of\nfairness and transparency when designing algorithms for equitable, cybernetic\nsocieties.",

Previous work has verified\nthe efficacy of symbolic time series representation in a variety of engineering\napplications due to its storage efficiency and numerosity reduction. The most\nrecent symbolic aggregate approximation technique, ABBA, has been shown to\npreserve essential shape information of time series and improve downstream\napplications, e.g., neural network inference regarding prediction and anomaly\ndetection in time series.\n  Motivated by the emergence of high-performance hardware which enables\nefficient computation for low bit-width representations, we present a new\nquantization-based ABBA symbolic approximation technique, QABBA, which exhibits\nimproved storage efficiency while retaining the original speed and accuracy of\nsymbolic reconstruction. We prove an upper bound for the error arising from\nquantization and discuss how the number of bits should be chosen to balance\nthis with other errors.\n  An application of QABBA with large language models (LLMs) for time series\nregression is also presented, and its utility is investigated. By representing\nthe symbolic chain of patterns on time series, QABBA not only avoids the\ntraining of embedding from scratch, but also achieves a new state-of-the-art on\nMonash regression dataset. The symbolic approximation to the time series offers\na more efficient way to fine-tune LLMs on the time series regression task which\ncontains various application domains.

Below 10 keV, the\ndominant ENA loss processes are charge exchange collisions with protons and\nphotoionization.

    "abstract": "The parameterized analysis of graph modification problems represents the most\nextensively studied area within Parameterized Complexity. Given a graph $G$ and\nan integer $k\\in\\mathbb{N}$ as input, the goal is to determine whether we can\nperform at most $k$ operations on $G$ to transform it into a graph belonging to\na specified graph class $\\mathcal{F}$. Typical operations are combinatorial and\ninclude vertex deletions and edge deletions, insertions, and contractions.\nHowever, in many real-world scenarios, when the input graph is constrained to\nbe a geometric intersection graph, the modification of the graph is influenced\nby changes in the geometric properties of the underlying objects themselves,\nrather than by combinatorial modifications. It raises the question of whether\nvertex deletions or adjacency modifications are necessarily the most\nappropriate modification operations for studying modifications of geometric\ngraphs.\n  We propose the study of the disk intersection graph modification through the\nscaling of disks. This operation is typical in the realm of topology control\nbut has not yet been explored in the context of Parameterized Complexity. We\ndesign parameterized algorithms and kernels for modifying to the most basic\ngraph classes: edgeless, connected, and acyclic. Our technical contributions\nencompass a novel combination of linear programming, branching, and\nkernelization techniques, along with a fresh application of bidimensionality\ntheory to analyze the area covered by disks, which may have broader\napplicability.",

    "abstract": "Averaging iterations of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) have achieved\nempirical success in training deep learning models, such as Stochastic Weight\nAveraging (SWA), Exponential Moving Average (EMA), and LAtest Weight Averaging\n(LAWA). Especially, with a finite weight averaging method, LAWA can attain\nfaster convergence and better generalization. However, its theoretical\nexplanation is still less explored since there are fundamental differences\nbetween finite and infinite settings. In this work, we first generalize SGD and\nLAWA as Finite Weight Averaging (FWA) and explain their advantages compared to\nSGD from the perspective of optimization and generalization. A key challenge is\nthe inapplicability of traditional methods in the sense of expectation or\noptimal values for infinite-dimensional settings in analyzing FWA's\nconvergence. Second, the cumulative gradients introduced by FWA introduce\nadditional confusion to the generalization analysis, especially making it more\ndifficult to discuss them under different assumptions. Extending the final\niteration convergence analysis to the FWA, this paper, under a convexity\nassumption, establishes a convergence bound\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\log\\left(\\frac{T}{k}\\right)/\\sqrt{T})$, where $k\\in[1, T/2]$ is a\nconstant representing the last $k$ iterations. Compared to SGD with\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\log(T)/\\sqrt{T})$, we prove theoretically that FWA has a faster\nconvergence rate and explain the effect of the number of average points. In the\ngeneralization analysis, we find a recursive representation for bounding the\ncumulative gradient using mathematical induction. We provide bounds for\nconstant and decay learning rates and the convex and non-convex cases to show\nthe good generalization performance of FWA. Finally, experimental results on\nseveral benchmarks verify our theoretical results.",

ALIGN outperformed the LLM baselines,\nwhile also providing capabilities for trustworthy deployment. For MedDRA\ncoding, ALIGN achieved high accuracy across all levels, matching RAG and\nexcelling at the most specific levels (87-90% for HLGT). For ATC coding, ALIGN\ndemonstrated superior performance, particularly at lower hierarchy levels (ATC\nLevel 4), with 72-73% overall accuracy and 86-89% accuracy for common\nmedications, outperforming baselines by 7-22%.

However, the cascaded connection between converters and qubits usually\nbrings additional insertion loss and intermediate noises. Here, we propose a\ncooperative quantum interface (CQI) that integrates the converter and qubit\ncoupling into a single device for efficient long-distance entanglement\ngeneration. Compared to traditional cascaded systems, our scheme offers several\nadvantages, including compactness, reduced insertion loss, and suppression of\nnoise from intermediate modes. We prove the excellent performance over the\nseparated devices by about two orders of magnitude for the entangled infidelity\nof two remote nodes. Moreover, we discuss an extended scheme for multiple\nremote nodes, revealing an exponential advantage in performance as the number\nof nodes increases. The cooperative effect is universal that can be further\napplied to multifunctional integrated quantum devices.

Existing pose-NeRF joint optimization methods handle\nposes with small noise (inliers) effectively but struggle with large noise\n(outliers), such as mirrored poses. In this work, we focus on mitigating the\nimpact of outlier poses. Our method integrates an inlier-outlier confidence\nestimation scheme, leveraging scene graph information gathered during the data\npreparation phase. Unlike previous works directly using rendering metrics as\nthe reference, we employ a detached color network that omits the viewing\ndirection as input to minimize the impact caused by shape-radiance ambiguities.\nThis enhanced confidence updating strategy effectively differentiates between\ninlier and outlier poses, allowing us to sample more rays from inlier poses to\nconstruct more reliable radiance fields. Additionally, we introduce a\nre-projection loss based on the current Signed Distance Function (SDF) and pose\nestimations, strengthening the constraints between matching image pairs. For\noutlier poses, we adopt a Monte Carlo re-localization method to find better\nsolutions. We also devise a scene graph updating strategy to provide more\naccurate information throughout the training process. We validate our approach\non the SG-NeRF and DTU datasets.

As part of the effort towards early detection of abnormal behaviors,\nwe propose a simulator-based detection systems for six typical anomalies: being\nsemi-bedridden, being housebound, forgetting, wandering, fall while walking and\nfall while standing. Our detection system can be customized for various room\nlayout, sensor arrangement and resident's characteristics by training detection\nclassifiers using the simulator with the parameters fitted to individual cases.\nConsidering that the six anomalies that our system detects have various\noccurrence durations, such as being housebound for weeks or lying still for\nseconds after a fall, the detection classifiers of our system produce anomaly\nlabels depending on each anomaly's occurrence duration, e.g., housebound per\nday and falls per second. We propose a method that standardizes the processing\nof sensor data, and uses a simple detection approach. Although the validity\ndepends on the realism of the simulation, numerical evaluations using sensor\ndata that includes a variety of resident behavior patterns over nine years as\ntest data show that (1) the methods for detecting wandering and falls are\ncomparable to previous methods, and (2) the methods for detecting being\nsemi-bedridden, being housebound, and forgetting achieve a sensitivity of over\n0.9 with fewer than one false alarm every 50 days.",

Our approximation confirms that for $ k=1 $, the only solution\nis $ m=3 $, and for $ k \\geq 2 $ it suggests there are no further positive\ninteger solutions. However, because Diophantine problems demand exactness, any\nomission of correction terms in the Euler-MacLaurin formula could mask genuine\nsolutions. Thus, while our method offers valuable insights into the behavior of\nthe Erd\\\"{o}s-Moser equation and illustrates the analytical challenges\ninvolved, it does not constitute a definitive proof.

    "abstract": "Hard negative generation aims to generate informative negative samples that\nhelp to determine the decision boundaries and thus facilitate advancing deep\nmetric learning. Current works select pair/triplet samples, learn their\ncorrelations, and fuse them to generate hard negatives. However, these works\nmerely consider the local correlations of selected samples, ignoring global\nsample correlations that would provide more significant information to generate\nmore informative negatives. In this work, we propose a Globally\nCorrelation-Aware Hard Negative Generation (GCA-HNG) framework, which first\nlearns sample correlations from a global perspective and exploits these\ncorrelations to guide generating hardness-adaptive and diverse negatives.\nSpecifically, this approach begins by constructing a structured graph to model\nsample correlations, where each node represents a specific sample and each edge\nrepresents the correlations between corresponding samples. Then, we introduce\nan iterative graph message propagation to propagate the messages of node and\nedge through the whole graph and thus learn the sample correlations globally.\nFinally, with the guidance of the learned global correlations, we propose a\nchannel-adaptive manner to combine an anchor and multiple negatives for HNG.\nCompared to current methods, GCA-HNG allows perceiving sample correlations with\nnumerous negatives from a global and comprehensive perspective and generates\nthe negatives with better hardness and diversity. Extensive experiment results\ndemonstrate that the proposed GCA-HNG is superior to related methods on four\nimage retrieval benchmark datasets.

In real-world applications,\nwhere domain shifts occur and labels are often unavailable for a new target\ndomain, graph domain adaptation (GDA) approaches have been proposed to\nfacilitate knowledge transfer from the source domain to the target domain.\nPrevious efforts in tackling distribution shifts across domains have mainly\nfocused on aligning the node embedding distributions generated by the GNNs in\nthe source and target domains. However, as the core part of GDA approaches, the\nimpact of the underlying GNN architecture has received limited attention. In\nthis work, we explore this orthogonal direction, i.e., how to facilitate GDA\nwith architectural enhancement. In particular, we consider a class of GNNs that\nare designed explicitly based on optimization problems, namely unfolded GNNs\n(UGNNs), whose training process can be represented as bi-level optimization.\nEmpirical and theoretical analyses demonstrate that when transferring from the\nsource domain to the target domain, the lower-level objective value generated\nby the UGNNs significantly increases, resulting in an increase in the\nupper-level objective as well. Motivated by this observation, we propose a\nsimple yet effective strategy called cascaded propagation (CP), which is\nguaranteed to decrease the lower-level objective value. The CP strategy is\nwidely applicable to general UGNNs, and we evaluate its efficacy with three\nrepresentative UGNN architectures. Extensive experiments on five real-world\ndatasets demonstrate that the UGNNs integrated with CP outperform\nstate-of-the-art GDA baselines.",

This can\nmake it difficult, or even impossible, to perform certain tasks of interest,\nsuch as the segmentation of some urban space based on the location of its\nconstituting elements. Indeed, traditional approaches to tackle this specific\ntask require knowing the position of all these elements before clustering them.\nYet, alternative information is sometimes available, which can be leveraged to\naddress this challenge. For instance, in the Middle Ages, land registries\ntypically do not provide exact addresses, but rather locate spatial objects\nrelative to each other, e.g. x being to the North of y. Spatial graphs are\nparticularly adapted to model such spatial relationships, called confronts,\nwhich is why we propose their use over standard tabular databases. However,\nhistorical data are rich and allow extracting confront networks in many ways,\nmaking the process non-trivial. In this article, we propose several extraction\nmethods and compare them to identify the most appropriate. We postulate that\nthe best candidate must constitute an optimal trade-off between covering as\nmuch of the original data as possible, and providing the best graph-based\napproximation of spatial distance. Leveraging a dataset that describes Avignon\nduring its papal period, we show empirically that the best results require\nignoring some of the information present in the original historical sources,\nand that including additional information from secondary sources significantly\nimproves the confront network. We illustrate the relevance of our method by\npartitioning the best graph that we extracted, and discussing its community\nstructure in terms of urban space organization, from a historical perspective.\nOur data and source code are both publicly available online.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents an investigation into the high-order asymptotic expansion\nfor 2D and 3D cubic nonlinear Klein-Gordon equations in the non-relativistic\nlimit regime. There are extensive numerical and analytic results concerning\nthat the solution of NLKG can be approximated by first-order modulated\nSchr\\\"odinger profiles in terms of $e^{i\\frac t {\\varepsilon^2}}v + c.c. $,\nwhere $v$ is the solution of related NLS and ``$c.c.$\" denotes the complex\nconjugate. Particularly, the best analytic result up to now is given in\n\\cite{lei}, which proves that the $L_x^2$ norm of the error can be controlled\nby $\\varepsilon^2 +(\\varepsilon^2t)^{\\frac \\alpha 4}$ for $H^\\alpha_x$-data,\n$\\alpha \\in [1, 4]$. As for the high-order expansion, to our best knowledge,\nthere are only numerical results, while the theoretical one is lacking.\n  In this paper, we extend this study further and give the first high-order\nanalytic result.

    "abstract": "Herd immunity is a critical concept in epidemiology, describing a threshold\nat which a sufficient proportion of a population is immune, either through\ninfection or vaccination, thereby preventing sustained transmission of a\npathogen. In the classic Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model, which\nhas been widely used to study infectious disease dynamics, the achievement of\nherd immunity depends on key parameters, including the transmission rate\n($\\beta$) and the recovery rate ($\\gamma$), where $\\gamma$ represents the\ninverse of the mean infectious period. While the transmission rate has received\nsubstantial attention, recent studies have underscored the significant role of\n$\\gamma$ in determining the timing and sustainability of herd immunity.\nAdditionally, it is becoming increasingly evident that assuming $\\gamma$ as a\nconstant parameter might oversimplify the dynamics, as variations in recovery\ntimes can reflect diverse biological, social, and healthcare-related factors.\n  In this paper, we investigate how heterogeneity in the recovery rate affects\nherd immunity. We show empirically that the mean of the recovery rate is not a\nreliable metric for determining the achievement of herd immunity. Furthermore,\nwe provide a theoretical result demonstrating that it is instead the mean\nrecovery time, which is the mean of the inverse $1/\\gamma$ of the recovery rate\nthat is critical in deciding whether herd immunity is achievable within the SIR\nframework. A similar result is proved for the SEIR model. These insights have\nsignificant implications for public health interventions and theoretical\nmodeling of epidemic dynamics.",

For example, in\nCyber-Physical Systems (CPS) controlled by RL, the attacker can manipulate the\nactions of the adopted RL to other actions during the training phase, which\nwill lead to bad consequences. Existing work has studied action-manipulation\nattacks in tabular settings, where the states and actions are discrete. As seen\nin many up-and-coming RL applications, such as autonomous driving, continuous\naction space is widely accepted, however, its action-manipulation attacks have\nnot been thoroughly investigated yet.

However, our understanding of the mechanism underlying this\nphenomenon remains limited. In this study, we use three-dimensional direct\nnumerical simulations with a modified multi-marker volume-of-fluid method to\ninvestigate liquid-liquid two-phase turbulence in a Taylor-Couette geometry.\nThe dispersed phase has the same density and viscosity as the continuous phase.\nThe Reynolds number $Re\\equiv r_i\\omega_i d/\\nu$ is fixed at 5200, the volume\nfraction of the dispersed phase is up to $40\\%$, and the Weber number $We\\equiv\n\\rho u^2_\\tau d/\\sigma$ is around 8. It is found that the increase in the\nsystem's drag originates from the contribution of interfacial tension.\nSpecifically, droplets experience significant deformation and stretching in the\nstreamwise direction due to shear near the inner cylinder. Consequently, the\nrear end of the droplets lags behind the fore head. This causes opposing\ninterfacial tension effects on the fore head and rear end of the droplets. For\nthe fore head of the droplets, the effect of interfacial tension appears to act\nagainst the flow direction. For the rear end, the effect appears to act in the\nflow direction. The increase in the system's drag is primarily attributed to\nthe effect of interfacial tension on the fore head of the droplets which leads\nto the hindering effect of the droplets on the surrounding continuous phase.\nThis hindering effect disrupts the formation of high-speed streaks, favoring\nthe formation of low-speed ones, which are generally associated with higher\nviscous stress and drag of the system. This study provides new insights into\nthe mechanism of drag enhancement reported in our previous experiments.",

Built on the nuScenes dataset, SURDS comprises 41,080\nvision-question-answer training instances and 9,250 evaluation samples,\nspanning six spatial categories: orientation, depth estimation, pixel-level\nlocalization, pairwise distance, lateral ordering, and front-behind relations.\nWe benchmark leading general-purpose VLMs, including GPT, Gemini, and Qwen,\nrevealing persistent limitations in fine-grained spatial understanding. To\naddress these deficiencies, we go beyond static evaluation and explore whether\nalignment techniques can improve spatial reasoning performance.

However, this method requires vehicles to\nautonomously select communication resources based on the Semi-Persistent\nScheduling (SPS) protocol, which may lead to collisions due to different\nvehicles sharing the same communication resources, thereby affecting\ncommunication effectiveness. Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) is\nconsidered a potential solution for handling large-scale vehicle communication,\nas it can enhance the Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) by\nemploying Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC), thereby reducing the\nnegative impact of communication collisions. When evaluating vehicle\ncommunication performance, traditional metrics such as reliability and\ntransmission delay present certain contradictions. Introducing the new metric\nAge of Information (AoI) provides a more comprehensive evaluation of\ncommunication system. Additionally, to ensure service quality, user terminals\nneed to possess high computational capabilities, which may lead to increased\nenergy consumption, necessitating a trade-off between communication energy\nconsumption and effectiveness. Given the complexity and dynamics of\ncommunication systems, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) serves as an\nintelligent learning method capable of learning optimal strategies in dynamic\nenvironments. Therefore, this paper analyzes the effects of multi-priority\nqueues and NOMA on AoI in the C-V2X vehicular communication system and proposes\nan energy consumption and AoI optimization method based on DRL. Finally,\nthrough comparative simulations with baseline methods, the proposed approach\ndemonstrates its advances in terms of energy consumption and AoI.",

Time-delay embeddings have been effectively\napplied to chaotic time series data, offering a principled method to\nreconstruct relevant information of the full attractor from partial time series\nobservations. In this study, we investigate the structure of the unstable\nperiodic orbits of an attractor using time-delay embeddings. First, we embed\ntime-series data from a periodic orbit into a higher-dimensional space through\nthe construction of a Hankel matrix, formed by arranging time-shifted copies of\nthe data. We then examine the influence of the width and height of the Hankel\nmatrix on the geometry of unstable periodic orbits in the delay-embedded space.\nThe right singular vectors of the Hankel matrix provide a basis for embedding\nthe periodic orbits. We observe that increasing the length of the delay (e.g.,\nthe height of the Hankel matrix) leads to a clear separation of the periodic\norbits into distinct clusters within the embedded space. Our analysis\ncharacterizes these separated clusters and provides a mathematical framework to\ndetermine the relative position of individual unstable periodic orbits in the\nembedded space. Additionally, we present a modified formula to derive the\nsymbolic representation of distinct periodic orbits for a specified sequence\nlength, extending the Poly\\'a-Redfield enumeration theorem.",

However, conventional\nholographic imaging often relies on magnifying optical systems to compensate\nfor the low resolution of holograms captured by image sensors. The spatial\nresolution of the reconstructed image is fundamentally constrained by the\nspace-bandwidth of the hologram due to aliasing errors at insufficient sampling\nrates. This study analyzes the spatial distribution of the angular spectrum in\nundersampled holograms using angle modulation techniques. Aliased replica\nfunctions are identified as phase-modulated functions by multiples of the\nsampling frequency, with the spatial frequency components continuously\nextending into the replica regions. Optical imaging simulations demonstrate\nthat image reconstruction beyond the space-bandwidth limitation of digital\nholograms is feasible. In particular, high-order diffraction fields,\ncharacterized by orthogonality, can be effectively eliminated through an\nupsampling process. By sequentially removing high-order terms and applying a\nlearning-based denoising algorithm, wide-field high-resolution optical imaging\nis achieved. This approach demonstrates that only a captured low-resolution\nhologram can reconstruct a high-resolution image, thereby overcoming the\nlimitations imposed by the finite space-bandwidth of digital holography.",

Most existing LDL methods consider\nthe number of labels to be static. However, in various LDL-specific contexts\n(e.g., disease diagnosis), the label count grows over time (such as the\ndiscovery of new diseases), a factor that existing methods overlook. Learning\nsamples with new labels directly means learning all labels at once, thus\nwasting more time on the old labels and even risking overfitting the old\nlabels. At the same time, learning new labels by the LDL model means\nreconstructing the inter-label relationships. How to make use of constructed\nrelationships is also a crucial challenge. To tackle these challenges, we\nintroduce Incremental Label Distribution Learning (ILDL), analyze its key\nissues regarding training samples and inter-label relationships, and propose\nScalable Graph Label Distribution Learning (SGLDL) as a practical framework for\nimplementing ILDL.

Aims: SDSS\nJ102915.14+172927.9 is one of the most metal-poor star known to date. Since no\ncarbon can be detected in its spectrum, a careful upper limit is important,\nboth to classify this star and to distinguish it from the carbon-enhanced stars\nthat represent the majority at these metallicities. Methods: We undertook a new\nobservational campaign to acquire high-resolution UVES spectra. The new spectra\nwere combined with archival spectra in order to increase the signal-to-noise\nratio. From the combined spectrum, we derived abundances for seven elements\n(Mg, Si, Ca, Ti, Fe, Ni, and a tentative Li) and five significant upper limits\n(C, Na, Al, Sr, and Ba). Results: The star has a carbon abundance A(C) <4.68\nand therefore is not enhanced in carbon, at variance with the majority of the\nstars at this Fe regime, which typically show A(C)> 6.0. A feature compatible\nwith the Li doublet at 670.7 nm is tentatively detected. Conclusions: The upper\nlimit on carbon implies $Z<1.915 \\times 10^{-6}$, more than 20 times lower than\nthe most iron-poor star known. Therefore, the gas cloud out of which the star\nwas formed did not cool via atomic lines but probably through dust.\nFragmentation of the primordial cloud is another possibility for the formation\nof a star with a metallicity this low.",

We first clarify the spectral stability of such solutions\ndepending on the convexity of the flux for the underlying conservation law. The\nmain contribution of this article is a detailed study of the so-called Green's\nfunction for the linearized numerical scheme. As evidenced on numerical\nsimulations, the Green's function exhibits a highly oscillating behavior ahead\nof the leading wave before this wave reaches the shock location. One of our\nmain results gives a quantitative description of this behavior. Because of the\nexistence of a one-parameter family of stationary shock profiles, the\nlinearized numerical scheme admits the eigenvalue 1 that is embedded in its\ncontinuous spectrum, which gives rise to several contributions in the Green's\nfunction. Our detailed analysis of the Green's function describes these\ncontributions by means of a so-called activation function. For large times, the\nactivation function describes how the mass of the initial condition accumulates\nalong the eigenvector associated with the eigenvalue 1 of the linearized\nnumerical scheme. We can then obtain sharp decay estimates for the linearized\nnumerical scheme in polynomially weighted spaces, which in turn yield a\nnonlinear orbital stability result for spectrally stable stationary shock\nprofiles. This nonlinear result is obtained despite the lack of uniform\n${\\ell}$ 1 estimates for the Green's function of the linearized numerical\nscheme, the lack of such estimates being linked with the dispersive nature of\nthe numerical scheme. This dispersive feature is in sharp contrast with\nprevious results on the orbital stability of traveling waves or discrete shock\nprofiles for parabolic perturbations of conservation laws.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel 3D speech-to-animation (STA) generation framework\ndesigned to address the shortcomings of existing models in producing diverse\nand emotionally resonant animations. Current STA models often generate\nanimations that lack emotional depth and variety, failing to align with human\nexpectations. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel STA model\ncoupled with a reward model. This combination enables the decoupling of emotion\nand content under audio conditions through a cross-coupling training approach.\nAdditionally, we develop a training methodology that leverages automatic\nquality evaluation of generated facial animations to guide the reinforcement\nlearning process. This methodology encourages the STA model to explore a\nbroader range of possibilities, resulting in the generation of diverse and\nemotionally expressive facial animations of superior quality. We conduct\nextensive empirical experiments on a benchmark dataset, and the results\nvalidate the effectiveness of our proposed framework in generating\nhigh-quality, emotionally rich 3D animations that are better aligned with human\npreferences.",

Omniprediction requires\napproximating the Bayes-optimal predictor beyond the loss minimization\nparadigm, and has generated significant interest in the learning theory\ncommunity. However, even for basic settings such as agnostically learning\nsingle-index models (SIMs), existing omnipredictor constructions require\nimpractically-large sample complexities and runtimes, and output complex,\nhighly-improper hypotheses.\n  Our main contribution is a new, simple construction of omnipredictors for\nSIMs. We give a learner outputting an omnipredictor that is\n$\\varepsilon$-competitive on any matching loss induced by a monotone, Lipschitz\nlink function, when the comparator class is bounded linear predictors. Our\nalgorithm requires $\\approx \\varepsilon^{-4}$ samples and runs in nearly-linear\ntime, and its sample complexity improves to $\\approx \\varepsilon^{-2}$ if link\nfunctions are bi-Lipschitz. This significantly improves upon the only prior\nknown construction, due to [HJKRR18, GHK+23], which used $\\gtrsim\n\\varepsilon^{-10}$ samples.\n  We achieve our construction via a new, sharp analysis of the classical\nIsotron algorithm [KS09, KKKS11] in the challenging agnostic learning setting,\nof potential independent interest.

A NACA 0012 airfoil was simulated at\nhigh Reynolds number with the Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model in\nincompressible, steady flow. We use the impulse form of the lift, drag, and\nmoment equations applied to a control volume coincident with the square\ncomputational domain, to explore the BCs. It is well known that consistency\nwith the lift requires representing the airfoil by a point vortex, but it is\nlargely unknown that consistency with the drag requires a point source as was\nfirst discovered by Lagally (1922) and Filon (1926). We show that having a\npoint source in the BCs is more important at high drag than using a point\nvortex. The reason is that BCs without a point source cause blockage at the top\nand bottom sidewalls in a manner very similar to wind tunnel blockage for\nexperiments. A simple \"Lagally-Filon\" correction for small levels of blockage\nis derived and shown to bring the results much closer to those obtained using\nboundary conditions including a point source. Although consistent with the lift\nand drag, the combined point vortex and source boundary condition is not\nconsistent with the moment equation but the further correction for this\ninconsistency is shown to be very small. We speculate that the correction may\nbe more important in cases where the moment is critical, such as vertical-axis\nturbines.",

To address this, we propose the Hints\nof Prompt (HoP) framework, which introduces three key enhancements: Affinity\nhint to emphasize instance-level structure by strengthening token-wise\nconnections, Semantic hint to incorporate high-level information relevant to\ndriving-specific cases, such as complex interactions among vehicles and traffic\nsigns, and Question hint to align visual features with the query context,\nfocusing on question-relevant regions. These hints are fused through a Hint\nFusion module, enriching visual representations and enhancing multimodal\nreasoning for autonomous driving VQA tasks. Extensive experiments confirm the\neffectiveness of the HoP framework, showing it significantly outperforms\nprevious state-of-the-art methods across all key metrics.",

    "abstract": "Traditional approaches to training agents have generally involved a single,\ndeterministic environment of minimal complexity to solve various tasks such as\nrobot locomotion or computer vision. However, agents trained in static\nenvironments lack generalization capabilities, limiting their potential in\nbroader scenarios. Thus, recent benchmarks frequently rely on multiple\nenvironments, for instance, by providing stochastic noise, simple permutations,\nor altogether different settings. In practice, such collections result mainly\nfrom costly human-designed processes or the liberal use of random number\ngenerators. In this work, we introduce AMaze, a novel benchmark generator in\nwhich embodied agents must navigate a maze by interpreting visual signs of\narbitrary complexities and deceptiveness. This generator promotes human\ninteraction through the easy generation of feature-specific mazes and an\nintuitive understanding of the resulting agents' strategies. As a\nproof-of-concept, we demonstrate the capabilities of the generator in a simple,\nfully discrete case with limited deceptiveness. Agents were trained under three\ndifferent regimes (one-shot, scaffolding, interactive), and the results showed\nthat the latter two cases outperform direct training in terms of generalization\ncapabilities. Indeed, depending on the combination of generalization metric,\ntraining regime, and algorithm, the median gain ranged from 50% to 100% and\nmaximal performance was achieved through interactive training, thereby\ndemonstrating the benefits of a controllable human-in-the-loop benchmark\ngenerator.",

Since a single scan from\nterrestrial laser systems captures data from only one angle, multiple scans\nmust be registered and fused to obtain complete tree point cloud data. This\npaper proposes a marker-free automatic registration method for single-tree\npoint clouds based on similar tetrahedras. First, two point clouds from two\nscans of the same tree are used to generate tree skeletons, and key point sets\nare constructed from these skeletons. Tetrahedra are then filtered and matched\naccording to similarity principles, with the vertices of these two matched\ntetrahedras selected as matching point pairs, thus completing the coarse\nregistration of the point clouds from the two scans. Subsequently, the ICP\nmethod is applied to the coarse-registered leaf point clouds to obtain fine\nregistration parameters, completing the precise registration of the two tree\npoint clouds. Experiments were conducted using terrestrial laser scanning data\nfrom eight trees, each from different species and with varying shapes. The\nproposed method was evaluated using RMSE and Hausdorff distance, compared\nagainst the traditional ICP and NDT methods. The experimental results\ndemonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms both ICP and NDT\nin registration accuracy, achieving speeds up to 593 times and 113 times faster\nthan ICP and NDT, respectively. In summary, the proposed method shows good\nrobustness in single-tree point cloud registration, with significant advantages\nin accuracy and speed compared to traditional ICP and NDT methods, indicating\nexcellent application prospects in practical registration scenarios.",

The equation of motion of a\ncurrent-driven skyrmion in a quadratic energy landscape is mathematically\nequivalent to the differential equation characterizing an RC circuit: the\napplied current resembles the applied input voltage, and the skyrmion position\nresembles the output voltage at the capacitor. These predictions are confirmed\nvia micromagnetic simulations. We show that such a skyrmion system reproduces\nthe characteristic exponential voltage decay upon charging and discharging the\ncapacitor under constant input. Furthermore, it mimics the low-pass filter\nbehavior of RC circuits by filtering high-frequencies in periodic input\nsignals. Since RC circuits are mathematically equivalent to the\nLeaky-Integrate-Fire (LIF) model widely used to describe biological neurons,\nour device concept can also be regarded as a perfect artificial LIF neuron.",

The qubits on the ring are\nperiodically measured and reused to achieve a teleportation depth that exceeds\nthe total number of available qubits in the quantum processor. Using the\noutcomes measured during teleportation, we calculate and apply byproduct\noperators through dynamic circuits to correct local transformations induced on\nthe teleported state. We evaluate the quality of teleportation by tracing the\npreserved entanglement and fidelity of the teleported two-qubit graph state\nfrom its density matrix. In the real-machine experiments, we demonstrate that\n58% of the teleported state's entanglement is sustained with a measured\ntwo-qubit negativity of $0.291\\pm0.018$ after three complete revolutions around\nthe hamster wheel, or equivalently, after hopping across 56 qubits. On the\nmachine-specific noisy emulator, we found that the teleported state after 100\nhops still sustained 45% of its entanglement.

Each interaction technique\nexhibits its own strength, and solely using one type usually constrains the\nmodel's capability to capture the complex feature relationships, especially for\nindustrial data with enormous input feature fields. Recent research shows that\neffective CTR models often combine an MLP network with a dedicated feature\ninteraction network in a two-parallel structure. However, the interplay and\ncooperative dynamics between different streams or branches remain\nunder-researched. In this work, we introduce a novel Multi-Branch Cooperation\nNetwork (MBCnet) which enables multiple branch networks to collaborate with\neach other for better complex feature interaction modeling. Specifically,\nMBCnet consists of three branches: the Extensible Feature Grouping and Crossing\n(EFGC) branch that promotes the model's memorization ability of specific\nfeature fields, the low rank Cross Net branch and Deep branch to enhance\nexplicit and implicit feature crossing for improved generalization. Among these\nbranches, a novel cooperation scheme is proposed based on two principles:\nBranch co-teaching and moderate differentiation. Branch co-teaching encourages\nwell-learned branches to support poorly-learned ones on specific training\nsamples. Moderate differentiation advocates branches to maintain a reasonable\nlevel of difference in their feature representations on the same inputs.

When the PIM presumption of \"pre-loading DNN\nweights/parameters only once before repetitive computing\" is no longer\npractical, concurrent writing and computing techniques become necessary for\nPIM. Conventional methods of naive ping-pong or in~situ concurrent\nwrite/compute scheduling for PIM cause low utilization of off-chip memory\nbandwidth, subsequently offsetting the efficiency gain brought by PIM\ntechnology. To address this challenge, we propose an off-chip memory bandwidth\ncentric pipelining strategy, named \"generalized ping-pong\", to maximize the\nutilization and performance of PIM accelerators toward large DNN models. The\ncore idea of the proposed generalized ping-pong strategy is to evenly\ndistribute the active time and fully utilize the off-chip memory bandwidth.\nBased on a programmable and scalable SRAM PIM architecture, we quantitatively\nanalyze and compare the generalized ping-pong with the conventional scheduling\nstrategies of naive ping-pong and in-situ write/compute for PIM. Experiments\nshow that the generalized ping-pong strategy achieves acceleration of over 1.67\ntimes when fully utilizing the off-chip memory bandwidth.

The\ncombined system, dubbed Topkima-Former, enhances 1.8x-84x speedup and 1.3x-35x\nenergy efficiency (EE) over prior In-memory computing (IMC) accelerators.\nCompared to a conventional softmax macro and a digital top-k (Dtopk) softmax\nmacro, our proposed tokima softmax macro achieves about 15x and 8x faster speed\nrespectively.",

This paper investigates\nthe optical appearance of scalar hairy black holes (SHBHs) with asymmetric\npotential, a numerical solution obtained in Phys. Rev. D 73, 084002 (2006) and\ndiscussed in Phys.Rev.D 108 (2023) 4, 044020. Since the solution is spherically\nsymmetric and surrounded by a thin accretion disk, we base our analysis on the\nwork of J.~P. Lumininet (1979). We discuss the behavior of the effective\npotential for massive and massless particles, the innermost stable circular\norbits (ISCO), and the photon sphere radius for different SHBHs. The study\nincludes the plots of isoradial curves and spectral shifts arising from\ngravitational and Doppler shifts by considering direct and secondary images.\nBased on the work of Page and Thorne (1974), we also investigate the intrinsic\nintensity of radiation emitted by the disk at a given radius, which allows the\ncalculation of the distribution of observed bolometric flux. We use the angular\nsize of the shadow reported by the EHT for Sagittarius A* and M87* to constrain\nthe SHBHs parameters.",

We study how the\nglobal graph of reproductive relationships, or population pedigree, influences\nthe genealogical relationships of a sample of two gene copies at a genetic\nlocus. Specifically, we consider a diploid Moran model with constant population\nsize $N$ over time, in which a proportion of offspring are produced by selfing.\nWe show that the conditional distribution of the pairwise coalescence time at a\nsingle locus given the random pedigree converges to a limit law as $N$ tends to\ninfinity. The distribution of coalescence times obtained in this way predicts\nvariation among unlinked loci in a sample of individuals. Traditional\ncoalescent analyses implicitly average over pedigrees and generally make\ndifferent predictions. We describe three different behaviors in the limit\ndepending on the relative strengths, from large to small, of selfing versus\noutcrossing: partial selfing, limited outcrossing, and negligible outcrossing.\nIn the case of partial selfing, coalescence times are related to the Kingman\ncoalescent, similar to what is found in traditional analyses. In the case of\nlimited outcrossing, the retained pedigree information forms a random graph,\nwith coalescence times given by the meeting times of random walks on this\ngraph. In the case of negligible outcrossing, which represents complete or\nnearly complete selfing, coalescence times are determined entirely by the fixed\ntimes to common ancestry of diploid individuals in the pedigree.",

In this attack, the attacker attempts to duplicate the target\nmodel by abusing the responses from the API. Backdoor-based DNN watermarking is\nknown as a promising defense against MEAs, wherein the defender injects a\nbackdoor into extracted models via API responses. The backdoor is used as a\nwatermark of the model; if a suspicious model has the watermark (i.e.,\nbackdoor), it is verified as an extracted model. This work focuses on object\ndetection (OD) models. Existing backdoor attacks on OD models are not\napplicable for model watermarking as the defense against MEAs on a realistic\nthreat model. Our proposed approach involves inserting a backdoor into\nextracted models via APIs by stealthily modifying the bounding-boxes (BBs) of\nobjects detected in queries while keeping the OD capability.

Though promising, current LLM-based methods encounter the following\ninadequacies in practice: First, the massive parameters and computational\ndemands make it difficult to be deployed online.

These methods utilize convolution to extract intricate\nlocal features and attention mechanisms to gather long-range information,\nimproving the overall comprehension of the scene. However, a common drawback of\nthese approaches is that the resulting images often suffer from blurriness,\nartifacts, and inconsistencies. This is partly because attention mechanisms\napply weights to all features based on generalized similarity scores, which can\ninadvertently introduce noise and irrelevant details from cloud-covered areas.\nTo overcome this limitation and better capture relevant distant context, we\nintroduce a novel approach named Attentive Contextual Attention (AC-Attention).\nThis method enhances conventional attention mechanisms by dynamically learning\ndata-driven attentive selection scores, enabling it to filter out noise and\nirrelevant features effectively. By integrating the AC-Attention module into\nthe DSen2-CR cloud removal framework, we significantly improve the model's\nability to capture essential distant information, leading to more effective\ncloud removal. Our extensive evaluation of various datasets shows that our\nmethod outperforms existing ones regarding image reconstruction quality.\nAdditionally, we conducted ablation studies by integrating AC-Attention into\nmultiple existing methods and widely used network architectures.

However, using\nsupervised learning methods is often challenging or costly due to the\ndifficulty of collecting ground-truth data. In response, unsupervised learning\napproaches have emerged. Most early methods, though, assume that the given\nimage pairs are from the same camera or have minor lighting differences.\nConsequently, while these methods perform effectively under such conditions,\nthey generally fail when input image pairs come from different domains,\nreferred to as multimodal image pairs. To address these limitations, we propose\nAltO, an unsupervised learning framework for estimating homography in\nmultimodal image pairs.

As a result, we\ndemonstrate that our method, AltO, can be trained on multimodal datasets\nwithout any ground-truth data.

The refractive indices contrast between GaAs, InP, GaSb, and sapphire\nare sufficiently high to achieve low loss over a broad optical wavelength. The\ncalculated loss at wavelengths of 1330 nm, 1550 nm, and 2000 nm for the GaAs,\nInP, and GaSb rib waveguides are 0.32 dB/cm, 0.67 dB/cm, and 0.70 dB/cm,\nre-spectively.

However, the multidisciplinary nature of breeding has brought\ntechnical barriers and efficiency challenges to knowledge mining. Therefore, it\nis important to develop a smart breeding goal tool to mine cross-domain\nmultimodal data. Based on different pre-trained open-source multimodal large\nlanguage models (MLLMs) (e.g., Qwen-VL, InternVL, Deepseek-VL), this study used\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and\nreinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) technologies to inject\ncross-domain knowledge into MLLMs, thereby constructing multiple multimodal\nlarge language models for wheat breeding (WBLMs).

The\nresults showed that the WBLM constructed using SFT, RAG and RLHF technologies\nand InternVL2-8B has leading performance. Then, subsequent experiments were\nconducted using the WBLM. Ablation experiments indicated that the combination\nof SFT, RAG, and RLHF technologies can improve the overall generation\nperformance, enhance the generated quality, balance the timeliness and\nadaptability of the generated answer, and reduce hallucinations and biases. The\nWBLM performed best in wheat yield prediction using cross-domain data (remote\nsensing, phenotyping, weather, germplasm) simultaneously, with R2 and RMSE of\n0.821 and 489.254 kg/ha, respectively.

In these tasks, balancing\nprecision (the proportion of relevant items among those predicted) and recall\n(the proportion of relevant items successfully predicted) is crucial. A key\nchallenge is that one-sided feedback--where only positive examples are observed\nduring training--is inherent in many practical problems. For instance, in\nrecommender systems like YouTube, training data only consists of videos that a\nuser has actively selected, while unselected items remain unseen. Despite this\nlack of negative feedback in training, avoiding undesirable recommendations at\ntest time is essential.\n  We introduce a PAC learning framework where each hypothesis is represented by\na graph, with edges indicating positive interactions, such as between users and\nitems. This framework subsumes the classical binary and multi-class PAC\nlearning models as well as multi-label learning with partial feedback, where\nonly a single random correct label per example is observed, rather than all\ncorrect labels.\n  Our work uncovers a rich statistical and algorithmic landscape, with nuanced\nboundaries on what can and cannot be learned. Notably, classical methods like\nEmpirical Risk Minimization fail in this setting, even for simple hypothesis\nclasses with only two hypotheses. To address these challenges, we develop novel\nalgorithms that learn exclusively from positive data, effectively minimizing\nboth precision and recall losses. Specifically, in the realizable setting, we\ndesign algorithms that achieve optimal sample complexity guarantees. In the\nagnostic case, we show that it is impossible to achieve additive error\nguarantees--as is standard in PAC learning--and instead obtain meaningful\nmultiplicative approximations.",

    "abstract": "Physics-driven deep learning (PD-DL) approaches have become popular for\nimproved reconstruction of fast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Though\nPD-DL offers higher acceleration rates than existing clinical fast MRI\ntechniques, their use has been limited outside specialized MRI centers. A key\nchallenge is generalization to underrepresented pathologies or populations,\nnoted in multiple studies, with fine-tuning on target populations suggested for\nimprovement. However, current approaches for PD-DL training require access to\nraw k-space measurements, which is typically only available at specialized MRI\ncenters that have research agreements for such data access. This is especially\nan issue for rural and underserved areas, where commercial MRI scanners only\nprovide access to a final reconstructed image. To tackle these challenges, we\npropose Compressibility-inspired Unsupervised Learning via Parallel Imaging\nFidelity (CUPID) for high-quality PD-DL training using only routine clinical\nreconstructed images exported from an MRI scanner. CUPID evaluates output\nquality with a compressibility-based approach while ensuring that the output\nstays consistent with the clinical parallel imaging reconstruction through\nwell-designed perturbations. Our results show CUPID achieves similar quality to\nestablished PD-DL training that requires k-space data while outperforming\ncompressed sensing (CS) and diffusion-based generative methods. We further\ndemonstrate its effectiveness in a zero-shot training setup for retrospectively\nand prospectively sub-sampled acquisitions, attesting to its minimal training\nburden. As an approach that radically deviates from existing strategies, CUPID\npresents an opportunity to provide equitable access to fast MRI for underserved\npopulations in an attempt to reduce the inequalities associated with this\nexpensive imaging modality.",

Two crucial\ninsights enable AsymDex to reduce the observation and action space dimensions\nand improve sample efficiency. First, true ambidexterity is rare in humans and\nmost of us exhibit strong \"handedness\". Inspired by this observation, we assign\ncomplementary roles to each hand: the facilitating hand repositions and\nreorients one object, while the dominant hand performs complex manipulations to\nachieve the desired result (e.g., opening a bottle cap, or pouring liquids).\nSecond, controlling the relative motion between the hands is crucial for\ncoordination and synchronization of the two hands. As such, we design relative\nobservation and action spaces and leverage a relative-pose tracking controller.\nFurther, we propose a two-phase decomposition in which AsymDex can be readily\nintegrated with recent advances in grasp learning to facilitate both the\nacquisition and manipulation of objects using two hands. Unlike existing\nRL-based methods for bimanual dexterity with multi-fingered hands, which are\neither sample inefficient or tailored to a specific task, AsymDex can\nefficiently learn a wide variety of bimanual skills that exhibit asymmetry.\nDetailed experiments on seven asymmetric bimanual dexterous manipulation tasks\n(four simulated and three real-world) reveal that AsymDex consistently\noutperforms strong baselines that challenge our design choices.

For a dense\nnetwork with CKMs of existing access points (APs), it will be useful to\nefficiently generate CKMs of potentially new APs with only AP location\ninformation. The generation of inferred CKMs across APs can help dense networks\nachieve convenient initial CKM generation, environment-aware AP deployment, and\ncost-effective CKM updates.

    "abstract": "Our work proposes a novel approach to designing activation functions by\nfocusing on their gradients and deriving the corresponding activation functions\nusing integration. We introduce the Expanded Integral of the Exponential Linear\nUnit (xIELU), a trainable piecewise activation function derived by integrating\ntrainable affine transformations applied to the Exponential Linear Unit (ELU).\nxIELU combines two key properties for the gradient: (1) a trainable and\nlinearly increasing gradient for positive inputs, similar to Squared ReLU\n(ReLU$^2$), and (2) a trainable gradient that can take negative values for\nnegative inputs, inspired by Expanded SiLU (xSiLU). Conceptually, xIELU can be\nviewed as an extension of ReLU$^2$ to handle negative inputs. The trainable\nparameters in xIELU allow it to adaptively reduce its nonlinearity for\nhigher-level representations deeper in the network. In experiments with 1.1B\nand 3B parameter Llama models trained on 125B tokens of FineWeb Edu, xIELU\nachieves lower perplexity compared to popular activation functions like\nReLU$^2$ and SwiGLU when matched for the same compute cost and parameter count.\nA reference implementation is available at\nhttps://github.com/Anonymous5823/xielu.",

    "abstract": "The reward function is an essential component in robot learning. Reward\ndirectly affects the sample and computational complexity of learning, and the\nquality of a solution. The design of informative rewards requires domain\nknowledge, which is not always available. We use the properties of the dynamics\nto produce system-appropriate reward without adding external assumptions.\nSpecifically, we explore an approach to utilize the Lyapunov exponents of the\nsystem dynamics to generate a system-immanent reward. We demonstrate that the\n`Sum of the Positive Lyapunov Exponents' (SuPLE) is a strong candidate for the\ndesign of such a reward. We develop a computational framework for the\nderivation of this reward, and demonstrate its effectiveness on classical\nbenchmarks for sample-based stabilization of various dynamical systems. It\neliminates the need to start the training trajectories at arbitrary states,\nalso known as auxiliary exploration. While the latter is a common practice in\nsimulated robot learning, it is unpractical to consider to use it in real\nrobotic systems, since they typically start from natural rest states such as a\npendulum at the bottom, a robot on the ground, etc. and can not be easily\ninitialized at arbitrary states. Comparing the performance of SuPLE to\ncommonly-used reward functions, we observe that the latter fail to find a\nsolution without auxiliary exploration, even for the task of swinging up the\ndouble pendulum and keeping it stable at the upright position, a prototypical\nscenario for multi-linked robots. SuPLE-induced rewards for robot learning\noffer a novel route for effective robot learning in typical as opposed to\nhighly specialized or fine-tuned scenarios.

This work provides a critical analysis regarding generative\nLLM's ability to understand language and dynamics in social contexts,\nparticularly considering cyberbullying and anti-cyberbullying (posts aimed at\nreducing cyberbullying) interactions.

We found that while fine-tuned LLMs exhibit\npromising results in some social media understanding tasks (understanding\ndirectionality), they presented mixed results in others (proper paraphrasing\nand bullying/anti-bullying detection).

We employed our\nin-house CFD solver coupled with Lagrangian tracking and cell-resolved\nfluid-structure interaction to measure flow-induced stresses and strains on the\nRBC membrane. The Norwood procedure, well-known to be associated with high\nmortality rate, is selected for its importance in the survival of the\nsingle-ventricle population. We simulated three anatomies including 2.5mm and\n4.0mm diameter modified Blalock-Taussig (BT) shunts and a 2.5mm central shunt\n(CS), with hundreds of RBCs in each case for statistical analysis. The results\nshow that the conditions created by these surgeries can elongate RBCs by more\nthan two-fold (3.1% of RBCs for 2.5mm BT shunt, 1.4% for 4mm BT shunt, and 8.8%\nfor CS). Shear and areal strain metrics also reveal that the central shunt\ncreates the greatest deformations on the RBCs membrane, indicating it is a more\nhemolytic procedure in comparison to the BT shunt.

Despite two decades of effort to make\ndesign scripting more accessible, a disconnect between a designer's free ways\nof thinking and the rigidity of algorithms remains (Burry, 2011). Recent\ndevelopments in Large Language Models (LLMs) suggest this might soon change, as\nLLMs encode a general understanding of human context and exhibit the capacity\nto produce geometric logic. This project speculates that if LLMs can\neffectively mediate between user intent and algorithms, they become a powerful\ntool to make scripting in design more widespread and fun. We explore if such\nsystems can interpret natural language prompts to assemble geometric operations\nrelevant to computational design scripting. In the system, multiple layers of\nLLM agents are configured with specific context to infer the user intent and\nconstruct a sequential logic. Given a user's high-level text prompt, a\ngeometric description is created, distilled into a sequence of logic\noperations, and mapped to software-specific commands. The completed script is\nconstructed in the user's visual programming interface. The system succeeds in\ngenerating complete visual scripts up to a certain complexity but fails beyond\nthis complexity threshold.

This is made possible by utilizing an\nalternative method for feature transformation to replace the linear projection\nof fully-connected layers.

We then use a hash\nalgorithm to retrieve a correlated subset of vectors dynamically based on the\ninput embedding. The retrieved vectors combined together will form the output\nembedding, which provides an estimation of the result of matrix multiplication\noperation in a fully-connected layer. Compared to conducting matrix\nmultiplication, retrieving data blocks from memory is a much cheaper operation\nwhich requires little computations.

In this paper, we propose a \"DISCO\" IOS (DIOS) based fully-passive\njammer (FPJ) that can launch omnidirectional fully-passive jamming attacks. In\nthe proposed DIOS-based FPJ, the interrelated refractive and reflective (R&R)\ncoefficients of the adversarial IOS are randomly generated, acting like a\n\"DISCO\" that distributes wireless energy radiated by the base station. By\nintroducing active channel aging (ACA) during channel coherence time, the\nDIOS-based FPJ can perform omnidirectional fully-passive jamming without\nneither jamming power nor channel knowledge of legitimate users (LUs). To\ncharacterize the impact of the DIOS-based PFJ, we derive the statistical\ncharacteristics of DIOS-jammed channels based on two widely-used IOS models,\ni.e., the constant-amplitude model and the variable-amplitude model.\nConsequently, the asymptotic analysis of the ergodic achievable sum rates under\nthe DIOS-based omnidirectional fully-passive jamming is given based on the\nderived stochastic characteristics for both the two IOS models. Based on the\nderived analysis, the omnidirectional jamming impact of the proposed DIOS-based\nFPJ implemented by a constant-amplitude IOS does not depend on either the\nquantization number or the stochastic distribution of the DIOS coefficients,\nwhile the conclusion does not hold on when a variable-amplitude IOS is used.\nNumerical results based on one-bit quantization of the IOS phase shifts are\nprovided to verify the effectiveness of the derived theoretical analysis.

    "abstract": "In recent years, there has been an increasing number of information hiding\ntechniques based on network streaming media, focusing on how to covertly and\nefficiently embed secret information into real-time transmitted network media\nsignals to achieve concealed communication. The misuse of these techniques can\nlead to significant security risks, such as the spread of malicious code,\ncommands, and viruses. Current steganalysis methods for network voice streams\nface two major challenges: efficient detection under low embedding rates and\nshort duration conditions. These challenges arise because, with low embedding\nrates (e.g., as low as 10%) and short transmission durations (e.g., only 0.1\nsecond), detection models struggle to acquire sufficiently rich sample\nfeatures, making effective steganalysis difficult. To address these challenges,\nthis paper introduces a Dual-View VoIP Steganalysis Framework (DVSF). The\nframework first randomly obfuscates parts of the native steganographic\ndescriptors in VoIP stream segments, making the steganographic features of\nhard-to-detect samples more pronounced and easier to learn. It then captures\nfine-grained local features related to steganography, building on the global\nfeatures of VoIP. Specially constructed VoIP segment triplets further adjust\nthe feature distances within the model. Ultimately, this method effectively\naddress the detection difficulty in VoIP. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat our method significantly improves the accuracy of streaming voice\nsteganalysis in these challenging detection scenarios, surpassing existing\nstate-of-the-art methods and offering superior near-real-time performance.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in Visual Language Models (VLMs) have made them crucial\nfor visual question answering (VQA) in autonomous driving, enabling natural\nhuman-vehicle interactions. However, existing methods often struggle in dynamic\ndriving environments, as they usually focus on static images or videos and rely\non downsampling to manage computational costs. This results in the loss of\ncritical details and the difficulty in effectively integrating spatial and\ntemporal information, undermining fine-grained perception and temporal\ncoherence essential for effective decision-making. To tackle these challenges,\nwe introduce LaVida Drive, a novel and efficient VQA framework for autonomous\ndriving. LaVida Drive seamlessly integrates temporal data while maintaining\nhigh-resolution inputs for detailed visual perception. It optimizes spatial\nprocessing by retaining high-resolution data for intricate details and using\nlower-resolution inputs for temporal analysis to focus on motion-related\nfeatures, thereby boosting computational efficiency. The core of LaVida Drive\nconsists of two modules: the \\textit{Query-aware Token Selection} module and\nthe \\textit{Spatial-Temporal Token Recovery and Enhancement} module. The former\ndynamically selects the most relevant visual tokens based on semantic alignment\nwith the input query, reducing the token count from high-resolution spatial\ninput. The latter ensures smooth and coherent interactions between spatial and\ntemporal information, preserving contextual continuity across frames. Extensive\nexperiments on various autonomous driving question-answering benchmarks show\nthat LaVida Drive significantly reduces visual tokens, enhances efficiency, and\nimproves overall performance.",

The advent of the X-ray\nmicrocalorimeter onboard the \\textit{XRISM} satellite will bring new\nconstraints on the emission line. We present one of the first such results for\nthe high-mass X-ray binary Centaurus X-3, which is composed of an O-type star\nand a neutron star (NS). We conducted a 155 ks observation covering an entire\nbinary orbit. A weak Fe K$\\alpha$ line was detected in all orbital phases at an\nequivalent width (EW) of 10--20 eV. We found for the first time that its radial\nvelocity (RV) is sinusoidally modulated by the orbital phase. The RV amplitude\nis 248 $\\pm$ 13 km s$^{-1}$, which is significantly smaller than the value (391\nkm s$^{-1}$) expected if the emission is from the NS surface, but is consistent\nif the emission takes place at the O star surface. We discuss several\npossibilities of the line production site, including the NS surface, O star\nsurface, O star wind, and accretion stream from the O star to the NS. We ran\nradiative transfer calculation for some of them assuming spherically-symmetric\ndensity and velocity profiles and an isotropic distribution of X-ray emission\nfrom the NS. None of them explains the observed EW and velocity dispersion\ndependence on the orbital phase, suggesting that more elaborated modeling is\nneeded.

These algorithms independently and\nrandomly assign each vertex $v$ to either $S$ or $V \\setminus S$, and the\ndistribution of $v$'s assignment is determined using only extremely local\ninformation about $v$: its bias, i.e., the relative difference between its out-\nand in-degrees.

By employing tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS), we observe a novel\ndouble donor-double acceptor (DDAA) peak that emerges in the OH stretching band\nof water molecules at room temperature and at sub-nanometer confinement. This\nRaman peak indicates the presence of a solid phase of water, namely ice-VII\nwith the body-centered cubic (bcc) unit. Interestingly, we observe a structural\ntransition from bcc DDAA (ice-VII) to tetrahedral DDAA as the confinement is\nweakened. Moreover, by identifying the spatial distribution of the HB network,\nwe find that the bcc DDAA network of ice-VII is predominantly present within\nthe interior of the confined water, rather than at air/water or at solid/water\ninterfaces. This suggest the possibility that the appearance of ice-VII in the\nstrongly confined space could be a general characteristic of water under\nextreme confinement.",

Assuming that aggregates are made of cubic\nparticles, we first use a boundary integral method to compute the stresses\nacting on the boundary of the aggregates. From these external stresses, we\ncompute the stresses within the aggregates in order to gain insights on their\nbreakup, or disaggregation. We focus on systems in which aggregates are either\nsettling under gravity or subjected to a background shear flow and study two\ntypes of aggregates, one with fractal dimension slightly less than two and one\nwith fractal dimension slightly above two. We partition the aggregates into\nmultiple shells based on the distance between the individual cubes in the\naggregates and their center of mass and observe the distribution of internal\nstresses in each shell. Our findings indicate that large stresses are least\nlikely to occur near the far edges of the aggregates. We also find that, for\nsettling aggregates, the maximum internal stress scales as about 7.5% of the\nratio of an aggregate's apparent weight to the area of the thinnest connection,\nhere a single square. For aggregates exposed to a shear flow, we find that the\nmaximum internal stress scales roughly quadratically with the aggregate radius.\nIn addition, after breaking aggregates at the face with the maximum internal\nstress, we compute the mass distribution of sub-aggregates and observe\nsignificant differences between the settling and shear setups for the two types\nof aggregates, with the low-fractal-dimension aggregates being more likely to\nsplit approximately evenly.

Existing metrics, such as\nFr\\'echet Video Distance (FVD), Inception Score (IS), and ClipSim, measure\nquality primarily in latent space rather than from a human visual perspective,\noften overlooking key aspects like appearance and motion consistency to\nphysical laws. In this paper, we propose a novel metric, VAMP (Visual\nAppearance and Motion Plausibility), that evaluates both the visual appearance\nand physical plausibility of generated videos. VAMP is composed of two main\ncomponents: an appearance score, which assesses color, shape, and texture\nconsistency across frames, and a motion score, which evaluates the realism of\nobject movements. We validate VAMP through two experiments: corrupted video\nevaluation and generated video evaluation. In the corrupted video evaluation,\nwe introduce various types of corruptions into real videos and measure the\ncorrelation between corruption severity and VAMP scores. In the generated video\nevaluation, we use state-of-the-art models to generate videos from carefully\ndesigned prompts and compare VAMP's performance to human evaluators' rankings.\nOur results demonstrate that VAMP effectively captures both visual fidelity and\ntemporal consistency, offering a more comprehensive evaluation of video quality\nthan traditional methods.",

In cases where an EV's remaining energy\nis limited and charging locations are not easily accessible, some destinations\nmay only be reachable through an energy-optimal path: a route that consumes\nless energy than all other alternatives. The feasibility of such\nenergy-efficient paths depends heavily on the accuracy of the energy model used\nfor planning, and thus failing to account for vehicle dynamics can lead to\ninaccurate energy estimates, rendering some planned routes infeasible in\nreality.

This\npaper introduces PHLAME, which applies pseudospectral collocation and spatial\nvector algebra to efficiently solve the Affine Geometric Heat Flow (AGHF)\nPartial Differential Equation (PDE) for trajectory optimization. Unlike\ntraditional PDE approaches like the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) PDE, which\nsolve for a function over the entire state space, computing a solution to the\nAGHF PDE scales more efficiently because its solution is defined over a\ntwo-dimensional domain, thereby avoiding the intractability of state-space\nscaling. To solve the AGHF one usually applies the Method of Lines (MOL), which\ndiscretizes one variable of the AGHF PDE, and converts the PDE into a system of\nordinary differential equations (ODEs) that are solved using standard\ntime-integration methods. Though powerful, this method requires a fine\ndiscretization to generate accurate solutions and requires evaluating the AGHF\nPDE which is computationally expensive for high-dimensional systems. PHLAME\novercomes this deficiency by using a pseudospectral method, which reduces the\nnumber of function evaluations required to yield a high accuracy solution\nthereby allowing it to scale efficiently to high-dimensional robotic systems.\nTo further increase computational speed, this paper presents analytical\nexpressions for the AGHF and its Jacobian, both of which can be computed\nefficiently using rigid body dynamics algorithms. PHLAME is tested across\nvarious dynamical systems, with and without obstacles and compared to a number\nof state-of-the-art techniques. PHLAME generates trajectories for a\n44-dimensional state-space system in $\\sim5$ seconds, much faster than current\nstate-of-the-art techniques.

The corresponding QSR-dissipative properties of the\noverall matrix-gain-scheduled system, which depends on the QSR properties of\nthe subsystems scheduled, are explicitly derived. The use of scheduling\nmatrices is a generalization of the scalar scheduling signals used in the\nliterature, and allows for greater design freedom when scheduling systems, such\nas in the case of gain-scheduled control. Furthermore, this work extends the\nexisting gain-scheduling results to a broader class of QSR-dissipative systems.\nThe matrix-scheduling of important special cases, such as passive, input\nstrictly passive, output strictly passive, finite L2 gain, very strictly\npassive, and conic systems are presented. The proposed gain-scheduling\narchitecture is used in the context of controlling a planar three-link robot\nsubject to model uncertainty. A novel control synthesis technique is used to\ndesign QSR-dissipative subcontrollers that are gain-scheduled using scheduling\nmatrices.

    "abstract": "The UV/optical light curves observed in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are\nwell-characterized by damped random walk (DRW) process, with the damping time\n$\\tau_d$ exhibiting correlations with both the black hole mass ($M_{BH}$) and\nthe photon wavelength ($\\lambda$). However, the underlying physical origins for\nthe DRW process and the scaling laws remain unclear. We aim to understand the\nAGN variability induced by a quasi-periodic large-scale dynamo in an accretion\ndisk, and examine whether it reproduces the observed variability features in\nAGN UV/optical light curves. Using a one-dimensional, optically thick,\ngeometrically thin disk model, we introduce variability into the viscosity\nparameter $\\alpha$ by incorporating quasi-periodic large-scale magnetic fields.\nWith reasonable dynamo parameters, our model successfully reproduces both the\nlinear relation between the root-mean-square and the mean values of the\nradiation flux, and the log-normal distribution of the flux variability. The\nPSDs of accretion rates and radiation fluxes align well with DRW models, and\nyield consistent values of $\\tau_d$ with AGN observations. Analytical\narguments, supported by numerical evidence, suggest that the flattening of flux\nPSDs at low frequencies is governed by the timescale at the inner boundary of\nthe emission region for a given wavelength. For $M_{BH} \\gtrsim 10^6 M_\\odot$,\nvariations in the Eddington ratio flatten the $\\tau_d$-$M_{BH}$ scaling,\nresulting in $\\tau_d \\propto M_{BH}^{0.5-1}$. For $M_{BH} \\lesssim 10^6\nM_\\odot$, we find a steeper scaling, $\\tau_d \\propto M_{BH}$.

However, existing approaches encounter two critical challenges in\nmodeling: (1) semantic relevance-the challenge of insufficiently capturing the\nnecessary contextual interactions among entities, relations, and numerical\nattributes, often resulting in suboptimal inference; and (2) semantic\nambiguity-the difficulty in accurately distinguishing ordinal relationships\nduring numerical reasoning, which compromises the generation of high-quality\nsamples and limits the effectiveness of contrastive learning.

Since an information\ncascade process is essentially a propagation tree, recent rumor detection\nmodels leverage graph neural networks to additionally capture information\npropagation patterns, thus outperforming text-only solutions. Given the\nvariations in topics and social impact of the root node, different source\ninformation naturally has distinct outreach capabilities, resulting in\ndifferent heights of propagation trees. This variation, however, impedes the\ndata-driven design of existing graph-based rumor detectors. Given a shallow\npropagation tree with limited interactions, it is unlikely for graph-based\napproaches to capture sufficient cascading patterns, questioning their ability\nto handle less popular news or early detection needs. In contrast, a deep\npropagation tree is prone to noisy user responses, and this can in turn\nobfuscate the predictions. In this paper, we propose a novel\nEpidemiology-informed Network (EIN) that integrates epidemiological knowledge\nto enhance performance by overcoming data-driven methods sensitivity to data\nquality. Meanwhile, to adapt epidemiology theory to rumor detection, it is\nexpected that each users stance toward the source information will be\nannotated. To bypass the costly and time-consuming human labeling process, we\ntake advantage of large language models to generate stance labels, facilitating\noptimization objectives for learning epidemiology-informed representations. Our\nexperimental results demonstrate that the proposed EIN not only outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods on real-world datasets but also exhibits enhanced\nrobustness across varying tree depths.",

    ],
    "abstract": "Comet ATLAS (C/2024 S1) is a bright dwarf sungrazer, the second Kreutz comet\ndiscovery from the ground this century, 13 years after comet Lovejoy (C/2011\nW3). The Population II membership of comet ATLAS sets it apart from the\noverwhelming majority of other bright dwarf sungrazers, most of them classified\nas members of Populations I, Pe, or Pre-I in the context of the contact-binary\nmodel. The new sungrazer might be closely related to comet du Toit (C/1945 X1),\nbut most exciting is the possibility that it is a fragment of the parent comet\nof the Great September Comet of 1882 (C/1882 R1) and comet Ikeya-Seki (C/1965\nS1). However, this scenario requires that the original orbital period of comet\nATLAS -- rather poorly known at present -- be 886 yr. If its orbital period\nshould turn out to be decidedly shorter, another scenario involving a\n13th-century sungrazer should be preferred instead. More work on the orbit\nneeds to be done. The apparent contradiction between the discovery of comet\nATLAS and previous failures to find any dwarf Kreutz sungrazers in images taken\nwith large ground-based telescopes at moderate heliocentric distances is\nexplained by the propensity of Population II dwarf comets for outbursts, acting\nin collusion with extremely rare occurrences of these objects. Also addressed\nare the dynamical properties of perihelion fragmentation as well as the nature\nand timing of the expected 21st-century cluster of Kreutz comets, swarms of\ndwarf sungrazers, and related issues.",

    "abstract": "This work explores the relationship between state space methods and Koopman\noperator-based methods for predicting the time-evolution of nonlinear dynamical\nsystems. We demonstrate that extended dynamic mode decomposition with\ndictionary learning (EDMD-DL), when combined with a state space projection, is\nequivalent to a neural network representation of the nonlinear discrete-time\nflow map on the state space. We highlight how this projection step introduces\nnonlinearity into the evolution equations, enabling significantly improved\nEDMD-DL predictions. With this projection, EDMD-DL leads to a nonlinear\ndynamical system on the state space, which can be represented in either\ndiscrete or continuous time. This system has a natural structure for neural\nnetworks, where the state is first expanded into a high dimensional feature\nspace followed by a linear mapping which represents the discrete-time map or\nthe vector field as a linear combination of these features. Inspired by these\nobservations, we implement several variations of neural ordinary differential\nequations (ODEs) and EDMD-DL, developed by combining different aspects of their\nrespective model structures and training procedures. We evaluate these methods\nusing numerical experiments on chaotic dynamics in the Lorenz system and a\nnine-mode model of turbulent shear flow, showing comparable performance across\nmethods in terms of short-time trajectory prediction, reconstruction of\nlong-time statistics, and prediction of rare events. These results highlight\nthe equivalence of the EDMD-DL implementation with a state space projection to\na neural ODE representation of the dynamics. We also show that these methods\nprovide comparable performance to a non-Markovian approach in terms of\nprediction of extreme events.",

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of stabilization of switched affine systems\nunder dwell-time constraint, giving guarantees on the bound of the quadratic\ncost associated with the proposed state switching control law. Specifically,\ntwo switching rules are presented relying on the solution of differential\nLyapunov inequalities and Lyapunov-Metzler inequalities, from which the\nstability conditions are expressed. The first one allows to regulate the state\nof linear switched systems to zero, whereas the second one is designed for\nswitched affine systems proving practical stability of the origin. In both\ncases, the determination of a guaranteed cost associated with each control\nstrategy is shown. In the cases of linear and affine systems, the existence of\nthe solution for the Lyapunov-Metzler condition is discussed and guidelines for\nthe selection of a solution ensuring suitable performance of the system\nevolution are provided. The theoretical results are finally assessed by means\nof three examples.",

    "abstract": "Ratio statistics and distributions are fundamental in various disciplines,\nincluding linear regression, metrology, nuclear physics, operations research,\neconometrics, biostatistics, genetics, and engineering. In this work, we\nintroduce two novel computational approaches for evaluating ratio distributions\nusing open data science tools and modern numerical quadratures. The first\napproach employs 1D double exponential quadrature of the Mellin convolution\nwith/without barycentric interpolation, which is a very fast and efficient\nquadrature technique. The second approach utilizes 2D vectorized Broda-Khan\nnumerical inversion of characteristic functions. It offers broader\napplicability by not requiring knowledge of PDFs or the independence of ratio\nconstituents. The pilot numerical study, conducted in the context of Hake's\nratio - a widely used measure of effect size and educational effectiveness in\nphysics education - demonstrates the proposed methods' speed, accuracy, and\nreliability. The analytical and numerical explorations also provide more\nclarifying insight into the theoretical and empirical properties of Hake's\nratio distribution. The proposed methods appear promising in a robust framework\nfor fast and exact ratio distribution computations beyond normal random\nvariables, with potential applications in multidimensional statistics and\nuncertainty analysis in metrology, where precise and reliable data handling is\nessential.",

    "abstract": "Mean-field limits have been used now as a standard tool in approximations,\nincluding for networks with a large number of nodes. Statistical inference on\nmean-filed models has attracted more attention recently mainly due to the rapid\nemergence of data-driven systems. However, studies reported in the literature\nhave been mainly limited to continuous models. In this paper, we initiate a\nstudy of statistical inference on discrete mean-field models (or jump\nprocesses) in terms of a well-known and extensively studied model, known as the\npower-of-L, or the supermarket model, to demonstrate how to deal with new\nchallenges in discrete models. We focus on system parameter estimation based on\nthe observations of system states at discrete time epochs over a finite period.\nWe show that by harnessing the weak convergence results developed for the\nsupermarket model in the literature, an asymptotic inference scheme based on an\napproximate least squares estimation can be obtained from the mean-field\nlimiting equation. Also, by leveraging the law of large numbers alongside the\ncentral limit theorem, the consistency of the estimator and its asymptotic\nnormality can be established when the number of servers and the number of\nobservations go to infinity. Moreover, numerical results for the power-of-two\nmodel are provided to show the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed\nestimator.",

The\nhybrid model, combining physics-based and data-driven methods, is tested across\ndifferent driving cycles to demonstrate the ability to significantly reduce the\nvoltage prediction error compared to the baseline LFM, while preserving\ncomputational efficiency.
