    "abstract": "Despite recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), their\nperformance on complex reasoning problems requiring multi-step thinking and\ncombining various skills is still limited. To address this, we propose a novel\nframework HDFlow for complex reasoning with LLMs that combines fast and slow\nthinking modes in an adaptive manner. Our approach consists of two key\ncomponents: 1) a new approach for slow, deliberate reasoning called Dynamic\nWorkflow, which automatically decomposes complex problems into more manageable\nsub-tasks and dynamically designs a workflow to assemble specialized LLM or\nsymbolic reasoning tools to solve sub-tasks; 2) Hybrid Thinking, a general\nframework that dynamically combines fast and slow thinking based on problem\ncomplexity. Finally, we propose an easy-to-scale method for automatically\nsynthesizing a large-scale dataset of 27K challenging reasoning problems for\ncomplex reasoning and a hybrid thinking tuning method that trains smaller LLMs\non this dataset to internalize the fast/slow hybrid reasoning strategies.\nExperiments on four reasoning benchmark datasets demonstrate that our slow\nthinking with dynamic workflows significantly outperforms Chain-of-Thought, and\nhybrid thinking achieves the highest accuracy while providing an effective\nbalance between computational efficiency and performance. Fine-tuning using our\nhybrid thinking approach also significantly boosts the complex reasoning\ncapabilities of open-source language models. The results showcase the promise\nof slow thinking, dynamic workflows, and hybrid thinking in expanding the\nfrontier of complex problem-solving with LLMs\\footnote{Code and data will be\nreleased at \\url{https://github.com/wenlinyao/HDFlow}.}.",

The lack of real-life hazy ground truth images\nnecessitates synthetic datasets, which often lack diverse haze types, impeding\neffective haze type classification and dehazing algorithm selection. This\nresearch introduces the HazeSpace2M dataset, a collection of over 2 million\nimages designed to enhance dehazing through haze type classification.\nHazeSpace2M includes diverse scenes with 10 haze intensity levels, featuring\nFog, Cloud, and Environmental Haze (EH). Using the dataset, we introduce a\ntechnique of haze type classification followed by specialized dehazers to clear\nhazy images. Unlike conventional methods, our approach classifies haze types\nbefore applying type-specific dehazing, improving clarity in real-life hazy\nimages. Benchmarking with state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, ResNet50 and AlexNet\nachieve 92.75\\% and 92.50\\% accuracy, respectively, against existing synthetic\ndatasets. However, these models achieve only 80% and 70% accuracy,\nrespectively, against our Real Hazy Testset (RHT), highlighting the challenging\nnature of our HazeSpace2M dataset. Additional experiments show that haze type\nclassification followed by specialized dehazing improves results by 2.41% in\nPSNR, 17.14% in SSIM, and 10.2\\% in MSE over general dehazers. Moreover, when\ntesting with SOTA dehazing models, we found that applying our proposed\nframework significantly improves their performance.

Semi-decentralized FL (SD-FL) has proposed a solution for\ndevice-to-device (D2D) enabled networks that divides model cooperation into two\nstages: at the lower stage, D2D communications is employed for local model\naggregations within subnetworks (subnets), while the upper stage handles\ndevice-server (DS) communications for global model aggregations. However,\nexisting SD-FL schemes are based on gradient diversity assumptions that become\nperformance bottlenecks as data distributions become more heterogeneous. In\nthis work, we develop semi-decentralized gradient tracking (SD-GT), the first\nSD-FL methodology that removes the need for such assumptions by incorporating\ntracking terms into device updates for each communication layer. Our analytical\ncharacterization of SD-GT reveals upper bounds on convergence for non-convex,\nconvex, and strongly-convex problems. We show how the bounds enable the\ndevelopment of an optimization algorithm that navigates the\nperformance-efficiency trade-off by tuning subnet sampling rate and D2D rounds\nfor each global training interval.

By leveraging a chain-connection method, each unit\nreceives independent vibration commands from a control unit, with fine-grained\ncontrol over intensity and frequency. We also designed a GUI Editor to expedite\nthe authoring of spatial vibrotactile patterns. Technical evaluation showed\nthat vibration units reliably reproduced audio waveforms with low-latency and\nhigh-bandwidth data communication. Case studies of a phonemic tactile display,\nvirtual reality fitness training, and drone teleoperation demonstrated the\npotential usage of VibraForge within different domains. A usability study with\nnon-expert users highlighted the low technical barrier and customizability of\nthe toolkit.",

    "abstract": "Gravitational waves have been shown to provide new constraints on\ngravitational theories beyond general relativity (GR), especially in the strong\nfield regime. Gravitational wave signals from galactic double white dwarfs,\nexpected to be detected by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), also\nhave the potential to place stringent bounds on certain theories that give rise\nto relatively large deviations from GR in less compact binaries, such as\nthrough scalar radiation. Nevertheless, the orbital evolution of close double\nwhite dwarf systems is also affected by various astrophysical effects, such as\nstellar rotation, tidal interactions, and magnetic interactions, which add\ncomplexity to the gravity tests. In this work, we employ the parametrized\npost-Einsteinian model to capture the leading beyond-GR effect on the signal\nand estimate the measurement uncertainties using the Fisher information matrix.\nWe then study the systematic error caused by ignoring each astrophysical effect\nmentioned above on the parameter estimation. Our numerical results show that,\nto place bounds on the non-GR effects comparable to existing bounds from pulsar\nobservations, tight priors on the mass of the binary and long observation time\nare required. At this level of sensitivity, we found that systematic errors\nfrom the astrophysical effects dominate statistical errors. The most\nsignificant effects investigated here are torques from tidal synchronization\nand magnetic unipolar induction for sufficiently large magnetic fields\n($>10^7$G). Meanwhile, even the weaker astrophysical effects from quadrupolar\ndeformations are of a similar order of magnitude as the statistical\nuncertainty, and hence cannot be ignored in the waveform model. We conclude\nthat the astrophysical effects must be carefully accounted for in the parameter\nestimation to test gravity with galactic double white dwarfs detected by LISA.",

    "abstract": "Fake news poses a significant threat to the integrity of information\necosystems and public trust. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) holds\nconsiderable promise for transforming the battle against fake news. Generally,\nLLMs represent a double-edged sword in this struggle. One major concern is that\nLLMs can be readily used to craft and disseminate misleading information on a\nlarge scale. This raises the pressing questions: Can LLMs easily generate\nbiased fake news? Do all LLMs have this capability? Conversely, LLMs offer\nvaluable prospects for countering fake news, thanks to their extensive\nknowledge of the world and robust reasoning capabilities. This leads to other\ncritical inquiries: Can we use LLMs to detect fake news, and do they outperform\ntypical detection models? In this paper, we aim to address these pivotal\nquestions by exploring the performance of various LLMs. Our objective is to\nexplore the capability of various LLMs in effectively combating fake news,\nmarking this as the first investigation to analyze seven such models. Our\nresults reveal that while some models adhere strictly to safety protocols,\nrefusing to generate biased or misleading content, other models can readily\nproduce fake news across a spectrum of biases. Additionally, our results show\nthat larger models generally exhibit superior detection abilities and that\nLLM-generated fake news are less likely to be detected than human-written ones.\nFinally, our findings demonstrate that users can benefit from LLM-generated\nexplanations in identifying fake news.",

As a result, the relaxation dynamics\nis dominated by the activation of the lowest, extremal tail of the\ndistribution. This framework predicts logarithmic creep, as well as correlated\nbursts of slow activated rearrangements, or 'thermal avalanches', whose size\ngrows logarithmically with their duration. The time interval between events\nwithin avalanches obeys a universal power-law distribution, with a cut-off that\nis simply proportional to the age of the system. We show that these predictions\nhold both in numerical models of amorphous solids, as well as in experiments\nwith thin crumpled sheets.

The outlet flow variation is generated by a periodic\nlinear dynamic system, which we use as a model of load fluctuations caused by\nvarying consumer demands. We first linearize the nonlinear equations around the\nequilibrium point and obtain a 2-by-2 coupled hyperbolic partial differential\nequation (PDE) system expressed in canonical form.

Furthermore, we extend the observer-based\ncontroller to the case when the outlet flow variation is uncertain within a\nbounded set.

Central to this process is\nthe reward model (RM), which translates human feedback into training signals\nfor optimising LLM behaviour. However, RMs can develop biases by exploiting\nspurious correlations in their training data, such as favouring outputs based\non length or style rather than true quality. These biases can lead to incorrect\noutput rankings, sub-optimal model evaluations, and the amplification of\nundesirable behaviours in LLMs alignment. This paper addresses the challenge of\ncorrecting such biases without additional data and training, introducing the\nconcept of Post-hoc Reward Calibration. We first propose an intuitive approach\nto estimate the bias term and, thus, remove it to approximate the underlying\ntrue reward. We then extend the approach to a more general and robust form with\nthe Locally Weighted Regression. Focusing on the prevalent length bias, we\nvalidate our proposed approaches across three experimental settings,\ndemonstrating consistent improvements: (1) a 3.11 average performance gain\nacross 33 reward models on the RewardBench dataset; (2) enhanced alignment of\nRM rankings with GPT-4 evaluations and human preferences based on the\nAlpacaEval benchmark; and (3) improved Length-Controlled win rate of the RLHF\nprocess in multiple LLM--RM combinations.

    "abstract": "Covariate-dependent graph learning has gained increasing interest in the\ngraphical modeling literature for the analysis of heterogeneous data. This\ntask, however, poses challenges to modeling, computational efficiency, and\ninterpretability. The parameter of interest can be naturally represented as a\nthree-dimensional array with elements that can be grouped according to two\ndirections, corresponding to node level and covariate level, respectively. In\nthis article, we propose a novel dual group spike-and-slab prior that enables\nmulti-level selection at covariate-level and node-level, as well as individual\n(local) level sparsity. We introduce a nested strategy with specific choices to\naddress distinct challenges posed by the various grouping directions. For\nposterior inference, we develop a tuning-free Gibbs sampler for all parameters,\nwhich mitigates the difficulties of parameter tuning often encountered in\nhigh-dimensional graphical models and facilitates routine implementation.\nThrough simulation studies, we demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms\nexisting methods in its accuracy of graph recovery. We show the practical\nutility of our model via an application to microbiome data where we seek to\nbetter understand the interactions among microbes as well as how these are\naffected by relevant covariates.",

    "abstract": "Reward inference (learning a reward model from human preferences) is a\ncritical intermediate step in the Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback\n(RLHF) pipeline for fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs). In practice, RLHF\nfaces fundamental challenges such as distribution shift, reward model\noverfitting, and problem misspecification. An alternative approach is direct\npolicy optimization without reward inference, such as Direct Preference\nOptimization (DPO), which provides a much simpler pipeline and has shown\nempirical success in LLM applications. However, DPO utilizes the closed-form\nexpression between the optimal policy and the reward function, which is only\nsuitable under the bandit setting or deterministic MDPs. This paper develops\ntwo RLHF algorithms without reward inference for general RL problems beyond\nbandits and deterministic MDPs, and general preference models beyond the\nBradley-Terry model. The key idea is to estimate the local value function\ndifference from human preferences and then approximate the policy gradient with\na zeroth-order gradient approximator. For both algorithms, we establish\npolynomial convergence rates in terms of the number of policy gradient\niterations, the number of trajectory samples, and human preference queries per\niteration. Numerical experiments in stochastic environments validate the\nperformance of our proposed algorithms, outperforming popular RLHF baselines\nsuch as DPO and PPO.

Automated\nflower and fruit density estimation, localization, and counting could help\nstreamline harvesting, yield estimation, and crop-load management strategies\nsuch as flower and fruitlet thinning. This article proposes a deep\nregression-based network, AgRegNet, to estimate density, count, and location of\nflower and fruit in tree fruit canopies without explicit object detection or\npolygon annotation. Inspired by popular U-Net architecture, AgRegNet is a\nU-shaped network with an encoder-to-decoder skip connection and modified\nConvNeXt-T as an encoder feature extractor. AgRegNet can be trained based on\ninformation from point annotation and leverages segmentation information and\nattention modules (spatial and channel) to highlight relevant flower and fruit\nfeatures while suppressing non-relevant background features. Experimental\nevaluation in apple flower and fruit canopy images under an unstructured\norchard environment showed that AgRegNet achieved promising accuracy as\nmeasured by Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), percentage Mean Absolute Error\n(pMAE) and mean Average Precision (mAP) to estimate flower and fruit density,\ncount, and centroid location, respectively. Specifically, the SSIM, pMAE, and\nmAP values for flower images were 0.938, 13.7%, and 0.81, respectively. For\nfruit images, the corresponding values were 0.910, 5.6%, and 0.93. Since the\nproposed approach relies on information from point annotation, it is suitable\nfor sparsely and densely located objects. This simplified technique will be\nhighly applicable for growers to accurately estimate yields and decide on\noptimal chemical and mechanical flower thinning practices.",

    "abstract": "Fruit monitoring plays an important role in crop management, and rising\nglobal fruit consumption combined with labor shortages necessitates automated\nmonitoring with robots. However, occlusions from plant foliage often hinder\naccurate shape and pose estimation. Therefore, we propose an active fruit shape\nand pose estimation method that physically manipulates occluding leaves to\nreveal hidden fruits. This paper introduces a framework that plans robot\nactions to maximize visibility and minimize leaf damage. We developed a novel\nscene-consistent shape completion technique to improve fruit estimation under\nheavy occlusion and utilize a perception-driven deformation graph model to\npredict leaf deformation during planning. Experiments on artificial and real\nsweet pepper plants demonstrate that our method enables robots to safely move\nleaves aside, exposing fruits for accurate shape and pose estimation,\noutperforming baseline methods.

    "abstract": "Unsupervised Multiplex Graph Learning (UMGL) aims to learn node\nrepresentations on various edge types without manual labeling. However,\nexisting research overlooks a key factor: the reliability of the graph\nstructure. Real-world data often exhibit a complex nature and contain abundant\ntask-irrelevant noise, severely compromising UMGL's performance. Moreover,\nexisting methods primarily rely on contrastive learning to maximize mutual\ninformation across different graphs, limiting them to multiplex graph redundant\nscenarios and failing to capture view-unique task-relevant information. In this\npaper, we focus on a more realistic and challenging task: to unsupervisedly\nlearn a fused graph from multiple graphs that preserve sufficient task-relevant\ninformation while removing task-irrelevant noise. Specifically, our proposed\nInformation-aware Unsupervised Multiplex Graph Fusion framework (InfoMGF) uses\ngraph structure refinement to eliminate irrelevant noise and simultaneously\nmaximizes view-shared and view-unique task-relevant information, thereby\ntackling the frontier of non-redundant multiplex graph.

However, training\nadvanced trajectory prediction models on large-scale datasets is both\ntime-consuming and computationally expensive. In addition, the imbalanced\ndistribution of driving scenarios often biases models toward data-rich cases,\nlimiting performance in safety-critical, data-scarce conditions. To address\nthese challenges, we propose the Sample Selection for Trajectory Prediction\n(SSTP) framework, which constructs a compact yet balanced dataset for\ntrajectory prediction. SSTP consists of two main stages (1) Extraction, in\nwhich a pretrained trajectory prediction model computes gradient vectors for\neach sample to capture their influence on parameter updates; and (2) Selection,\nwhere a submodular function is applied to greedily choose a representative\nsubset that covers diverse driving scenarios. This approach significantly\nreduces the dataset size and mitigates scenario imbalance, without sacrificing\nprediction accuracy and even improving in high-density cases. We evaluate our\nproposed SSTP on the Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2 benchmarks using a wide range\nof recent state-of-the-art models. Our experiments demonstrate that SSTP\nachieves comparable performance to full-dataset training using only half the\ndata while delivering substantial improvements in high-density traffic scenes\nand significantly reducing training time.

We investigate fatigue failure for glasses subjected to cyclic shear\ndeformation through computer simulations.

We explore several measures of damage,\nbased on quantification of plastic rearrangements and on dissipated energy.\nStrikingly, the fraction of particles that undergo plastic rearrangements, and\na percolation transition they undergo, are predictive of failure. We also find\na robust power law relationship between accumulated damage, quantified by\ndissipated energy or non-affine displacements, and the failure times, which\npermits prediction of failure times based on behavior in the initial cycles.\nThese observations reveal salient new microscopic features of fatigue failure\nand suggest approaches for developing a full microscopic picture of fatigue\nfailure in amorphous solids.",

Numerous efficient techniques, including weight pruning,\nquantization, and distillation, have been embraced to compress LLMs, targeting\nmemory reduction and inference acceleration, which underscore the redundancy in\nLLMs. However, most model compression techniques concentrate on weight\noptimization, overlooking the exploration of optimal architectures. Besides,\ntraditional architecture search methods, limited by the elevated complexity\nwith extensive parameters, struggle to demonstrate their effectiveness on LLMs.\nIn this paper, we propose a training-free architecture search framework to\nidentify optimal subnets that preserve the fundamental strengths of the\noriginal LLMs while achieving inference acceleration. Furthermore, after\ngenerating subnets that inherit specific weights from the original LLMs, we\nintroduce a reformation algorithm that utilizes the omitted weights to rectify\nthe inherited weights with a small amount of calibration data. Compared with\nSOTA training-free structured pruning works that can generate smaller networks,\nour method demonstrates superior performance across standard benchmarks.\nFurthermore, our generated subnets can directly reduce the usage of GPU memory\nand achieve inference acceleration.

This behavior can\nseverely compromise the model's generalization capabilities, making it\ndisproportionately dependent on certain features that might not represent the\nbroader context of images. While the conditions leading to this phenomenon\nremain elusive, the primary intent of this article is to shed light on this\nobserved behavior of neural networks. Our research endeavors to prioritize\ncomprehensive insight and to outline an initial response to this phenomenon. In\nline with this, we introduce Saliency Guided Dropout (SGDrop), a pioneering\nregularization approach tailored to address this specific issue. SGDrop\nutilizes attribution methods on the feature map to identify and then reduce the\ninfluence of the most salient features during training. This process encourages\nthe network to diversify its attention and not focus solely on specific\nstandout areas.

    "abstract": "Carlsson, Singh and Memoli's TDA mapper takes a point cloud dataset and\noutputs a graph that depends on several parameter choices. Dey, Memoli, and\nWang developed Multiscale Mapper for abstract topological spaces so that\nparameter choices can be analyzed via persistent homology. However, when\napplied to actual data, one does not always obtain filtrations of mapper\ngraphs. DBSCAN, one of the most common clustering algorithms used in the TDA\nmapper software, has two parameters, \\textbf{$\\epsilon$} and \\textbf{MinPts}.\nIf \\textbf{MinPts = 1} then DBSCAN is equivalent to single linkage clustering\nwith cutting height \\textbf{$\\epsilon$}. We show that if DBSCAN clustering is\nused with \\textbf{MinPts $>$ 2}, a filtration of mapper graphs may not exist\nexcept in the absence of free-border points; but such filtrations exist if\nDBSCAN clustering is used with \\textbf{MinPts = 1} or \\textbf{2} as the cover\nsize increases, \\textbf{$\\epsilon$} increases, and/or \\textbf{MinPts}\ndecreases. However, the 1-dimensional filtration is unstable. If one adds noise\nto a data set so that each data point has been perturbed by a distance at most\n\\textbf{$\\delta$}, the persistent homology of the mapper graph of the perturbed\ndata set can be significantly different from that of the original data set. We\nshow that we can obtain stability by increasing both the cover size and\n\\textbf{$\\epsilon$} at the same time. In particular, we show that the\nbi-filtrations of the homology groups with respect to cover size and $\\epsilon$\nbetween these two datasets are \\textbf{2$\\delta$}-interleaved.",

Underlying both the spread of disease and misinformation\nepidemics is the evolution of the contagion as it propagates, leading to the\nemergence of different strains, e.g., through genetic mutations in pathogens\nand alterations in the information content. Recent studies have revealed that\nmodels that do not account for heterogeneity in transmission risks associated\nwith different strains of the circulating contagion can lead to inaccurate\npredictions. However, existing results on multi-strain spreading assume that\nthe network has a vanishingly small clustering coefficient, whereas clustering\nis widely known to be a fundamental property of real-world social networks. In\nthis work, we investigate spreading processes that entail evolutionary\nadaptations on random graphs with tunable clustering and arbitrary degree\ndistributions. We derive a mathematical framework to quantify the epidemic\ncharacteristics of a contagion that evolves as it spreads, with the structure\nof the underlying network as given via arbitrary {\\em joint} degree\ndistributions of single-edges and triangles.

    "abstract": "Background: Quantification of cardiac motion on pre-treatment CT imaging for\nstereotactic arrhythmia radiotherapy patients is difficult due to the presence\nof image artifacts caused by metal leads of implantable\ncardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs). New methods are needed to accurately reduce\nthe metal artifacts in already reconstructed CTs to recover the otherwise lost\nanatomical information. Purpose: To develop a methodology to automatically\ndetect metal artifacts in cardiac CT scans and inpaint the affected volume with\nanatomically consistent structures and values. Methods: ECG-gated 4DCT scans of\n12 patients who underwent cardiac radiation therapy for treating ventricular\ntachycardia were collected. The metal artifacts in the images were manually\ncontoured. A 2D U-Net deep learning (DL) model was developed to segment the\nmetal artifacts. A dataset of synthetic CTs was prepared by adding metal\nartifacts from the patient images to artifact-free CTs. A 3D image inpainting\nDL model was trained to refill the metal artifact portion in the synthetic\nimages with realistic values. The inpainting model was evaluated by analyzing\nthe automated segmentation results of the four heart chambers on the synthetic\ndataset. Additionally, the raw cardiac patient cases were qualitatively\ninspected. Results: The artifact detection model produced a Dice score of 0.958\n+- 0.008. The inpainting model was able to recreate images with a structural\nsimilarity index of 0.988 +- 0.012. With the chamber segmentations improved\nsurface Dice scores from 0.684 +- 0.247 to 0.964 +- 0.067 and the Hausdorff\ndistance reduced from 3.4 +- 3.9 mm to 0.7 +- 0.7 mm. The inpainting model's\nuse on cardiac patient CTs was visually inspected and the artifact-inpainted\nimages were visually plausible. Conclusion: We successfully developed two deep\nmodels to detect and inpaint metal artifacts in cardiac CT images.",

    "abstract": "Current video-based computer vision (CV) applications typically suffer from\nhigh energy consumption due to reading and processing all pixels in a frame,\nregardless of their significance. While previous works have attempted to reduce\nthis energy by skipping input patches or pixels and using feedback from the end\ntask to guide the skipping algorithm, the skipping is not performed during the\nsensor read phase. As a result, these methods can not optimize the front-end\nsensor energy. Moreover, they may not be suitable for real-time applications\ndue to the long latency of modern CV networks that are deployed in the\nback-end. To address this challenge, this paper presents a custom-designed\nreconfigurable CMOS image sensor (CIS) system that improves energy efficiency\nby selectively skipping uneventful regions or rows within a frame during the\nsensor's readout phase, and the subsequent analog-to-digital conversion (ADC)\nphase. A novel masking algorithm intelligently directs the skipping process in\nreal-time, optimizing both the front-end sensor and back-end neural networks\nfor applications including autonomous driving and augmented/virtual reality\n(AR/VR). Our system can also operate in standard mode without skipping,\ndepending on application needs. We evaluate our hardware-algorithm co-design\nframework on object detection based on BDD100K and ImageNetVID, and gaze\nestimation based on OpenEDS, achieving up to 53% reduction in front-end sensor\nenergy while maintaining state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy.",

Models were benchmarked to RETFound, a state-of-the-art foundation\nmodel in ophthalmology. DINORET and BE DINORET demonstrated competitive\nperformance on retinal imaging tasks, with the block expanded model achieving\nthe highest scores on most datasets. Block expansion successfully mitigated\ncatastrophic forgetting. Our few-shot learning studies indicated that DINORET\nand BE DINORET outperform RETFound in terms of data-efficiency. This study\nhighlights the potential of adapting natural domain vision models to retinal\nimaging using self-supervised learning and block expansion. BE DINORET offers\nrobust performance without sacrificing previously acquired capabilities. Our\nfindings suggest that these methods could enable healthcare institutions to\ndevelop tailored vision models for their patient populations, enhancing global\nhealthcare inclusivity.",

This improvement further leads to\nbetter crosslingual transfer performance. However, it remains unclear how and\nwhy a better crosslingual alignment is achieved, as this technique only\ninvolves transliterations, and does not use any parallel data. This paper\nattempts to explicitly evaluate the crosslingual alignment and identify the key\nelements in transliteration-based approaches that contribute to better\nperformance. For this, we train multiple models under varying setups for two\npairs of related languages: (1) Polish and Ukrainian and (2) Hindi and Urdu. To\nassess alignment, we define four types of similarities based on sentence\nrepresentations. Our experimental results show that adding transliterations\nalone improves the overall similarities, even for random sentence pairs. With\nthe help of auxiliary transliteration-based alignment objectives, especially\nthe contrastive objective, the model learns to distinguish matched from random\npairs, leading to better crosslingual alignment. However, we also show that\nbetter alignment does not always yield better downstream performance,\nsuggesting that further research is needed to clarify the connection between\nalignment and performance.

Such an\nextension is critical, as multi-block methods leverage the separable structure\nof optimization problems, offering substantial reductions in per-iteration\ncomplexity.

Despite its\npromise, the adaptability of rPPG models to new, unseen domains is hindered due\nto the environmental sensitivity of physiological signals. To address this, we\npioneer the Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) in rPPG, enabling the adaptation of\npre-trained models to the target domain during inference, sidestepping the need\nfor annotations or source data due to privacy considerations. Particularly,\nutilizing only the user's face video stream as the accessible target domain\ndata, the rPPG model is adjusted by tuning on each single instance it\nencounters. However, 1) TTA algorithms are designed predominantly for\nclassification tasks, ill-suited in regression tasks such as rPPG due to\ninadequate supervision. 2) Tuning pre-trained models in a single-instance\nmanner introduces variability and instability, posing challenges to effectively\nfiltering domain-relevant from domain-irrelevant features while simultaneously\npreserving the learned information. To overcome these challenges, we present\nBi-TTA, a novel expert knowledge-based Bidirectional Test-Time Adapter\nframework. Specifically, leveraging two expert-knowledge priors for providing\nself-supervision, our Bi-TTA primarily comprises two modules: a prospective\nadaptation (PA) module using sharpness-aware minimization to eliminate\ndomain-irrelevant noise, enhancing the stability and efficacy during the\nadaptation process, and a retrospective stabilization (RS) module to\ndynamically reinforce crucial learned model parameters, averting performance\ndegradation caused by overfitting or catastrophic forgetting.

Generative Models optimized for continuous data struggle to\nmodel discrete and non-Gaussian features that have domain constraints.\nChallenges increase when the training datasets are limited and not diverse. In\nsuch cases, generative models create synthetic data that repeats sensitive\nfeatures, which is a privacy risk. Moreover, generative models face\ndifficulties comprehending attribute constraints in specialized domains. This\nleads to the generation of unrealistic data that impacts downstream accuracy.\nTo address these issues, this paper proposes a novel model, KIPPS, that infuses\nDomain and Regulatory Knowledge from Knowledge Graphs into Generative Deep\nLearning models for enhanced Privacy Preserving Synthetic data generation. The\nnovel framework augments the training of generative models with supplementary\ncontext about attribute values and enforces domain constraints during training.\nThis added guidance enhances the model's capacity to generate realistic and\ndomain-compliant synthetic data. The proposed model is evaluated on real-world\ndatasets, specifically in the domains of Cybersecurity and Healthcare, where\ndomain constraints and rules add to the complexity of the data.

An AV traffic sign classification system is integral\nto this module, which helps AVs recognize roadway traffic signs. However,\nadversarial attacks, in which an attacker modifies or alters the image captured\nfor traffic sign recognition, could lead an AV to misrecognize the traffic\nsigns and cause hazardous consequences. Deepfake presents itself as a promising\ntechnology to be used for such adversarial attacks, in which a deepfake traffic\nsign would replace a real-world traffic sign image before the image is fed to\nthe AV traffic sign classification system. In this study, the authors present\nhow a generative adversarial network-based deepfake attack can be crafted to\nfool the AV traffic sign classification systems.

    "abstract": "Mixing and heat transfer rates are typically enhanced when operating at\nhigh-pressure transcritical turbulent flow regimes. The rapid variation of\nthermophysical properties in the vicinity of the pseudo-boiling region can be\nleveraged to significantly increase the Reynolds numbers and destabilize the\nflow. The underlying physical mechanism responsible for this destabilization is\nthe presence of a baroclinic torque mainly driven by large localized density\ngradients across the pseudo-boiling line. As a result, the enstrophy levels are\nenhanced compared to equivalent low-pressure cases, and the flow physics\nbehavior deviates from standard wall turbulence characteristics. In this work,\nthe nature of this instability is carefully analyzed and characterized by means\nof linear stability theory. It is found that, at isothermal wall-bounded\ntranscritical conditions, the non-linear thermodynamics exhibited near the\npseudo-boiling region propitiates the laminar-to-turbulent transition with\nrespect to sub- and super-critical thermodynamic states. This transition is\nfurther exacerbated for non-isothermal flows even at low Brinkman numbers.\nParticularly, neutral curve sensitivity to Brinkman numbers and perturbation\nprofiles of dynamic and thermodynamic unstable modes based on modal and\nnon-modal analysis, which trigger the early flow destabilization, confirm this\nphenomenon. Nonetheless, a non-isothermal setup is a necessary condition for\ntransition when operating at low-Mach/Reynolds-number regimes. In detail, on\nequal Brinkman number, turbulence transition is accelerated and algebraic\ngrowth enhanced in comparison to isothermal cases. Consequently, high-pressure\ntranscritical setups result in larger kinetic energy budgets due to larger\nproduction rates and lower viscous dissipation.",

Here we establish a more rigorous foundation\nto fully develop a continuum model based on the respective microscopic dynamics\nthrough coarse-graining. All the assumptions needed to reach popular continuum\nmodels from a multi-particle Fokker-Planck equation, which governs the\nprobability of the full configuration space, are explicitly presented. In the\ndilute limit, this approach leads to the mean-field model (a.k.a.\nDoi-Saintillan-Shelley model), which can be further reduced to a continuum\nequation for particle density. Moreover, we review the limitations and\nhighlight the challenges related to continuum descriptions, including\nsignificant issues in implementing physical boundary conditions and the\npossible emergence of singular solutions.",

For this we apply the framework of\nnonlinear conjugate gradient methods in combination with the paradigm of\nSobolev gradients to investigate different metrics. Here we build on previous\nwork that proposed to enhance the convergence of regular Riemannian gradients\nmethods by an adaptively changing metric that is based on the current energy.\nIn this work, we extend this approach to the branch of Riemannian conjugate\ngradient (CG) methods and investigate the arising schemes numerically. Special\nattention is given to the selection of the momentum parameter in search\ndirection and how this affects the performance of the resulting schemes. As\nknown from similar applications, we find that the choice of the momentum\nparameter plays a critical role, with certain parameters reducing the number of\niterations required to achieve a specified tolerance by a significant factor.\nBesides the influence of the momentum parameters, we also investigate how the\nmethods with adaptive metric compare to the corresponding realizations with a\nstandard $H^1_0$-metric. As one of our main findings, the results of the\nnumerical experiments show that the Riemannian CG method with the proposed\nadaptive metric along with a Polak-Ribi\\'ere or Hestenes-Stiefel-type momentum\nparameter show the best performance and highest robustness compared to the\nother CG methods that were part of our numerical study.",

Previous work interpreted this as\ndue to resonance line scattering of the SLSN continuum by rapidly expanding\ncircumstellar material (CSM) expelled shortly before the explosion. The peak\nrest-frame $g$-band magnitude of SN 2020xga is $-22.30 \\pm 0.04$ mag and of SN\n2022xgc is $-21.97 \\pm 0.05$ mag, placing them among the brightest SLSNe-I.

We\nfind that the CSM shell of SN 2020xga resides at $\\sim 1.3 \\times 10^{16}~\\rm\ncm$, moving with a maximum velocity of $4275~\\rm km~s^{-1}$, and the shell of\nSN 2022xgc is located at $\\sim 0.8 \\times 10^{16}~\\rm cm$, reaching up to\n$4400~\\rm km~s^{-1}$.

The\nresults support very energetic magnetars, approaching the mass-shedding limit,\npowering these SNe with ejecta masses of $\\sim 7-9~\\rm M_\\odot$.

    "abstract": "Analyzing the spreading of information in many-body systems is crucial to\nunderstanding their quantum dynamics. At the most fundamental level, this task\nis accomplished by Bell inequalities, whose violation by quantum mechanics\nimplies that information cannot always be stored locally. While Bell-like\ninequalities, such as the one of Clauser and Horne, envisage a situation in\nwhich two parties perform measurements on systems at different positions, one\ncould formulate temporal inequalities, in which the two parties measure at\ndifferent times. However, for causally-connected measurement events, these\nextensions are compatible with a local description, so that no\nintrinsically-quantum information spreading is involved in such temporal\ncorrelations. Here we show that a temporal Clauser-Horne inequality for two\nspins is violated for a nonzero time interval between the measurements if the\ntwo measured parties are connected by a spin chain. Since the chain constitutes\nthe sole medium for the spreading of quantum information, it prevents the\nimmediate vanishing of Bell correlations after the first measurement and it\ninduces violation revivals. The dynamics we analyze shows that, as expected in\na non-relativistic setup, the spreading of information is fundamentally limited\nby the Lieb-Robinson bound. New insights on many-body quantum dynamics could\nemerge through future applications of our temporal Bell inequality to more\ngeneral systems.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely applied in summarization due to\ntheir speedy and high-quality text generation. Summarization for sensemaking\ninvolves information compression and insight extraction. Human guidance in\nsensemaking tasks can prioritize and cluster relevant information for LLMs.\nHowever, users must translate their cognitive thinking into natural language to\ncommunicate with LLMs. Can we use more readable and operable visual\nrepresentations to guide the summarization process for sensemaking? Therefore,\nwe propose introducing an intermediate step--a schematic visual workspace for\nhuman sensemaking--before the LLM generation to steer and refine the\nsummarization process. We conduct a series of proof-of-concept experiments to\ninvestigate the potential for enhancing the summarization by GPT-4 through\nvisual workspaces. Leveraging a textual sensemaking dataset with a ground truth\nsummary, we evaluate the impact of a human-generated visual workspace on\nLLM-generated summarization of the dataset and assess the effectiveness of\nspace-steered summarization. We categorize several types of extractable\ninformation from typical human workspaces that can be injected into engineered\nprompts to steer the LLM summarization. The results demonstrate how such\nworkspaces can help align an LLM with the ground truth, leading to more\naccurate summarization results than without the workspaces.",

In this work, we propose a divide-and-conquer (DaC) method to mitigate\nthese issues. The proposed algorithm efficiently finds small, medium, and\nlarge-scale holes by partitioning data into sub-regions and uses a\nVietoris-Rips filtration. Furthermore, we provide theoretical results that\nquantify the bottleneck distance between DaC and the true persistence diagram\nand the recovery probability of holes in the data. We empirically verify that\nthe rate coincides with our theoretical rate, and find that the memory and\ncomputational complexity of DaC outperforms an alternative method that relies\non a clustering preprocessing step to reduce the memory and computational\ncomplexity of the persistent homology computations. Finally, we test our\nalgorithm using spatial data of the locations of lakes in Wisconsin, where the\nclassical persistent homology is computationally infeasible.",

We design a QC\npipeline that allows for low time cost and effort across a team setting for a\nlarge database of diffusion weighted and structural magnetic resonance images.\nOur proposed method satisfies the following design criteria: 1.) a consistent\nway to perform and manage quality control across a team of researchers, 2.)\nquick visualization of preprocessed data that minimizes the effort and time\nspent on the QC process without compromising the condition or caliber of the\nQC, and 3.) a way to aggregate QC results across pipelines and datasets that\ncan be easily shared. In addition to meeting these design criteria, we also\nprovide information on what a successful output should be and common\noccurrences of algorithm failures for various processing pipelines. Our method\nreduces the time spent on QC by a factor of over 20 when compared to naively\nopening outputs in an image viewer and demonstrate how it can facilitate\naggregation and sharing of QC results within a team.

Even well-trained machine\nlearning models may produce unreliable predictions due to discrepancies between\ntraining data and real-world conditions encountered during inference.

In addition, it often overlooks unpredictable real-world events such\nas sudden braking or falling objects. To ensure safety, it is critical to\ndetect in real-time when a model's predictions become unreliable. Leveraging\nthe intuition that in-distribution (ID) scenes exhibit error patterns similar\nto training data, while out-of-distribution (OOD) scenes do not, we introduce a\nprincipled, real-time approach for OOD detection by framing it as a\nchange-point detection problem.

This non-intrusive, model-agnostic approach\ntreats the contributing models as black boxes and accommodates outputs from\ndiverse methodologies, including machine learning algorithms and traditional\nnumerical solvers. We advocate for a point-wise linear aggregation process and\nconsider two methods for optimizing this aggregate: Minimal Error Aggregation\n(MEA), which minimizes the prediction error, and Minimal Variance Aggregation\n(MVA), which focuses on reducing variance. We prove a theorem showing that MVA\ncan be more robustly estimated from data than MEA, making MEVA superior to\nMinimal Empirical Error Aggregation (MEEA).

Employing Galerkin's method and the\nNewton-Kantorovich theorem, we prove well-posedness for the abstract nonlinear\nsystem with possibly nonhomogeneous boundary data.\n  The connection between (spectral) fractional powers of the Laplacian and\nfractional Sobolev spaces due to interpolation theory allows us to transfer\nthese results to the nonlinear acoustic model under nonhomogeneous Dirichlet\nand Neumann boundary conditions, yielding fractional Sobolev regularity.

This process causes gas infalling close to the\nrotation axis to reach super-virial temperatures just before cooling and\njoining the disk. Stellar feedback heating accounts for less than 1% of the\nsuper-virial gas, indicating its minimal influence despite expectations. Even\nin scenarios with no stellar feedback effects considered, abundant super-virial\ngas persists, highlighting the dominance of alternative heating mechanisms.

These exotic materials have attracted considerable\nattention in recent years for potential applications in catalysis, rechargeable\nbatteries, and display technology. Among this class of materials, electride\nsemiconductors can further expand the horizon of potential applications due to\nthe presence of a band gap. However, there are only limited reports on\nsemiconducting electrides, hindering the understanding of their physical and\nchemical properties. In a recent work, we initiated an approach to derive\npotential electrides via selective removal of symmetric Wyckoff sites of anions\nfrom existing complex minerals. Herein, we present a follow-up effort to design\nthe semiconducting electrides from parental complex sodalites. Among four\ncandidate compounds, we found that a cubic Ca$_4$Al$_6$O$_{12}$ structure with\nthe $I$-43$m$ space group symmetry exhibits perfect electron localization at\nthe sodalite cages, with a narrow electronic band gap of 1.2 eV, making it\nsuitable for use in photocatalysis. Analysis of the electronic structures\nreveals that a lower electronegativity of surrounding cations drives greater\nelectron localization and promotes the formation of an electride band near the\nFermi level.

We confirm an efficient amplification of magnetic field during\ncollapse, the formation of a geometrically thick self-gravitating accretion\ndisk inside 0.1 pc, and damping of fragmentation in the disk by the field. This\ndisk differs profoundly from SMBH accretion disks. We find the following: (1)\nThe accretion disk is subject to the magnetorotational instability which\nfurther amplifies the field to near equipartition. No artificial seeding of the\ndisk field has been used. (2) The equipartition toroidal field changes its\npolarity in the midplane. (3) The nonlinear Parker instability develops,\naccompanied by the vertical buckling of the field lines, which injects material\nabove the disk, leading to an increase in the disk scale height; (4) With the\nCoriolis force producing a coherent helicity above the disk, vertical poloidal\nfield has been generated and amplified. (5) We estimate that the associated\noutflow will be most probably squashed by accretion. The resulting\nconfiguration consists of a magnetized disk with $\\beta > 0.1$ and its\nmagnetosphere with $\\beta << 1$, where $\\beta = P_{\\rm th}/P_{\\rm B}$ is the\nratio of thermal to magnetic energy density.

As a guide to future experiments, we show how the local optical\nconductivity and density of states present distinct qualitative features\ndepending on the symmetry of the superconductivity, that can be tuned via the\nmagnetization and temperature. In particular, the presence of the Majorana edge\nstate leads to a characteristic non-monotonic temperature dependence achieved\nby tuning the magnetization.",

We present a follow-up study of one recently-discovered\nstrongly lensed SN, the quadruply-imaged Type Ia SN 2022qmx (aka, \"SN Zwicky\")\nat z = 0.3544. We measure updated, template-subtracted photometry for SN Zwicky\nand derive improved time delays and magnifications. This is possible because\nSNe are transient, fading away after reaching their peak brightness.\nSpecifically, we measure point spread function (PSF) photometry for all four\nimages of SN Zwicky in three Hubble Space Telescope WFC3/UVIS passbands (F475W,\nF625W, F814W) and one WFC3/IR passband (F160W), with template images taken\n$\\sim 11$ months after the epoch in which the SN images appear. We find\nconsistency to within $2\\sigma$ between lens model predicted time delays\n($\\lesssim1$ day), and measured time delays with HST colors ($\\lesssim2$ days),\nincluding the uncertainty from chromatic microlensing that may arise from stars\nin the lensing galaxy. The standardizable nature of SNe Ia allows us to\nestimate absolute magnifications for the four images, with images A and C being\nelevated in magnification compared to lens model predictions by about $6\\sigma$\nand $3\\sigma$ respectively, confirming previous work.

With this\nmotivation in mind, we study weakly unstable modes, i.e., those with small\ngrowth rates. We show that our newly developed dispersion relation (Paper~I of\nthis series) allows for an expansion in powers of the small growth rate. For\nweakly unstable distributions, we show that the unstable modes must either move\nwith subluminal phase velocity, or very close to the speed of light. The\ninstability is fed from neutrinos moving resonantly with the waves, allowing us\nto derive explicit expressions for the growth rate. For axisymmetric\ndistributions, often assumed in the literature, numerical examples show the\naccuracy of these expressions.

Theoretical models of galaxy\nevolution cannot explain their high number density, rapid growth and truncation\nof star formation at such early times, which likely requires extreme feedback\nto destroy the cold interstellar medium (the fuel for star formation). We\nreport the discovery of a significant reservoir of hot dust in one of the most\ndistant known examples at $z = 4.658$, GS-9209. The dust was identified using\nJWST's Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI), whose unprecedented sensitivity and high\nspatial resolution, for the first time, firmly show that this dust is\nsignificantly more extended than the stars by $\\gtrsim 3$ times. We find that\nthe dust has preferentially been evacuated or diluted in the galaxy center. Our\nanalysis finds that the extended hot dust emission is consistent with recent\nheating by a younger and more spatially extended generation of star formation.\nThis reveals that the earliest quiescent galaxies did not form in a single\nrapid burst; instead, similar to galaxy growth at later times, the center\nformed first with star formation continuing in an extended envelope. The growth\nof this galaxy is truncating from the inside out, consistent with central gas\ndepletion from early AGN feedback.",

To demonstrate this scenario, we\nfocus on the WIMP dark matter candidate from a $U(1)_x$ hidden sector, which\ncouples more strongly to another concealed $U(1)_c$ sector than to the standard\nmodel. We explore two possible cases for the evolution of dark particles among\nhidden sectors: (1) The WIMP annihilates efficiently and achieves the observed\nrelic density with the assistance of the concealed sector. (2) The WIMP\ntransforms into another type of dark matter within the concealed sector and\nattains the observed relic density. Annihilating to the darker explains why\nWIMPs have remained undetected, and all WIMP models will continue to hold\ninterest.",

It remains unclear the degree\nto which infall shapes disc populations at ages $\\gtrsim 1$~Myr. We explore\npossible spatial correlations between stellar accretion rates in the Lupus star\nforming region, which would support the hypothesis that infall can regulate\nstellar accretion. We consider both the `clustered' stars towards the center of\nLupus 3, and the `distributed' stars that are more sparsely distributed across\nthe Lupus complex. We take the observed accretion rates in the literature and\nexplore spatial correlations. In particular, we test whether the clustered\nstars exhibit a radial gradient in normalised accretion rates, and whether the\ndistributed stars have spatially correlated accretion rates. We find\nstatistically significant correlations for both the clustered and distributed\nsamples. The clustered sample exhibits higher accretion rates in the central\nregion, consistent with the expected Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion rate.\nStars that are spatially closer among the distributed population also exhibit\nmore similar accretion rates. These results cannot be explained by the stellar\nmass distribution for either sample. Age gradients are disfavoured, though not\ndiscounted, because normalised disc dust masses are not spatially correlated\nacross the region. Spatially correlated stellar accretion rates within the\nLupus star forming region argue in favour of an environmental influence on\nstellar accretion, possibly combined with internal processes in the inner disc.\nRefined age measurements and searches for evidence of infalling material are\npotential ways to further test this finding.",

Then the heatmap simply multiplies the pixel\nvalues of the original image to obtain the actual input image for the LVLM.\nExtensive experiments on various vison-language benchmarks verify the\neffectiveness of our technique. For example, Attention Prompting on Image\nimproves LLaVA-1.5 by 3.8% and 2.9% on MM-Vet and LLaVA-Wild benchmarks,\nrespectively.",

Here,\nwe investigate the dynamics of local excitations in a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT using\na two-dimensional lattice of superconducting qubits. We first construct a\nsimple variational circuit which prepares low-energy states that have a large\noverlap with the ground state; then we create charge excitations with local\ngates and simulate their quantum dynamics via a discretized time evolution. As\nthe electric field coupling constant is increased, our measurements show\nsignatures of transitioning from deconfined to confined dynamics. For confined\nexcitations, the electric field induces a tension in the string connecting\nthem. Our method allows us to experimentally image string dynamics in a (2+1)D\nLGT from which we uncover two distinct regimes inside the confining phase: for\nweak confinement the string fluctuates strongly in the transverse direction,\nwhile for strong confinement transverse fluctuations are effectively frozen. In\naddition, we demonstrate a resonance condition at which dynamical string\nbreaking is facilitated. Our LGT implementation on a quantum processor presents\na novel set of techniques for investigating emergent excitations and string\ndynamics.",

In this paper, we provide an in-depth\nanalysis of neural network and transformer-based compression techniques to\nanswer this question. We compare traditional text compression systems with\nneural network and LLM-based text compression methods. Although LLM-based\nsystems significantly outperform conventional compression methods, they are\nhighly impractical. Specifically, LLMZip, a recent text compression system\nusing Llama3-8B requires 9.5 days to compress just 10 MB of text, although with\nhuge improvements in compression ratios. To overcome this, we present FineZip -\na novel LLM-based text compression system that combines ideas of online\nmemorization and dynamic context to reduce the compression time immensely.\nFineZip can compress the above corpus in approximately 4 hours compared to 9.5\ndays, a 54 times improvement over LLMZip and comparable performance. FineZip\noutperforms traditional algorithmic compression methods with a large margin,\nimproving compression ratios by approximately 50\\%. With this work, we take the\nfirst step towards making lossless text compression with LLMs a reality. While\nFineZip presents a significant step in that direction, LLMs are still not a\nviable solution for large-scale text compression.

However, the optimization of tasks\nperformance often comes at the cost of generalizability in fine-tuned models.\nTo address this issue, we theoretically connect smaller weight gradient norms\nduring training and larger datasets to the improvements in model\ngeneralization. Motivated by this connection, we propose reducing gradient\nnorms for enhanced generalization and aligning fine-tuned model with the\npre-trained counterpart to retain knowledge from large-scale pre-training data.\nYet, naive alignment does not guarantee gradient reduction and can potentially\ncause gradient explosion, complicating efforts to manage gradients.

We perturb features learned from\nthe adapter with the multiplicative noise and ensure the fine-tuned model\nremains consistent for same sample under different perturbations. Theoretical\nanalysis shows that PACE not only implicitly regularizes gradients for enhanced\ngeneralization, but also implicitly aligns the fine-tuned and pre-trained\nmodels to retain knowledge. Experimental evidence supports our theories.

Nevertheless, they\nare extremely rare and existing solvable models and solution techniques have\nserious limitations. In this paper we introduce a new family of exactly\nsolvable unitary circuits which model quantum many body dynamics in discrete\nspace and time. Unlike many previous solvable models, one can exactly compute\nthe full quantum dynamics initialized from any matrix product state in this new\nfamily of models. The time evolution of local observables and correlations, the\nlinear growth of Renyi entanglement entropy, spatiotemporal correlations, and\nout-of-time-order correlations are all exactly computable. A key property of\nthese models enabling the exact solution is that any time evolved local\noperator is an exact matrix product operator with finite bond dimension, even\nat arbitrarily long time, which we prove using the underlying (weak) Hopf\nalgebra structure along with tensor network techniques. We lay down the general\nframework for the construction and solution of this family of models, and give\nseveral explicit examples. In particular, we study in detail a model\nconstructed out of a weak Hopf algebra that is very close to a floquet version\nof the PXP model, and the exact results we obtain may shed light on the\nphenomenon of quantum many body scars, and more generally, floquet quantum\ndynamics in constrained systems.",

An\nimportant new tool for answering this question is a causality analysis in the\nnonlinear regime -- if the solutions of the evolution equations do not respect\nrelativistic causality, they are not a faithful representation of the\nunderlying relativistic theory (in this case, quantum chromodynamics). Using\nthis non-linear criterion, it has recently been shown that hydrodynamics is\nindeed being used outside its regime of validity in simulations, at least\nsometimes. Here we explore the phenomenological implications, particularly the\nquantitative effects of demanding limits on acausality in modern Bayesian\nparameter estimation. We find that, while typically only a small fraction of\nthe system's energy is initially in an acausal regime, placing strict limits on\nthe allowed energy fraction significantly changes the preferred properties of\nthe initial condition, which in turn alters the extracted medium properties\nsuch as bulk viscosity, where large values are no longer favored.

In this context, the combination\nof machine learning and proximity sensors is emerging as a technique capable of\nachieving this detection efficiently and effectively. For example, this machine\nlearning approach has been applied to potato crops -- to detect late blight\n(Phytophthora infestans) -- and grapevine crops -- to detect downy mildew.\nHowever, most of these AI models found in the specialised literature have been\ndeveloped using leaf-by-leaf images taken in the lab, which does not represent\nfield conditions and limits their applicability.\n  In this study, we present the first machine learning model capable of\ndetecting mild symptoms of late blight in potato crops through the analysis of\nhigh-resolution RGB images captured directly in the field, overcoming the\nlimitations of other publications in the literature and presenting real-world\napplicability. Our proposal exploits the availability of high-resolution images\nvia the concept of patching, and is based on deep convolutional neural networks\nwith a focal loss function, which makes the model to focus on the complex\npatterns that arise in field conditions. Additionally, we present a data\naugmentation scheme that facilitates the training of these neural networks with\nfew high-resolution images, which allows for development of models under the\nsmall data paradigm.\n  Our model correctly detects all cases of late blight in the test dataset,\ndemonstrating a high level of accuracy and effectiveness in identifying early\nsymptoms.

    "abstract": "Large language model pre-training has traditionally relied on human experts\nto craft heuristics for improving the corpora quality, resulting in numerous\nrules developed to date. However, these rules lack the flexibility to address\nthe unique characteristics of individual example effectively. Meanwhile,\napplying tailored rules to every example is impractical for human experts. In\nthis paper, we demonstrate that even small language models, with as few as 0.3B\nparameters, can exhibit substantial data refining capabilities comparable to\nthose of human experts. We introduce Programming Every Example (ProX), a novel\nframework that treats data refinement as a programming task, enabling models to\nrefine corpora by generating and executing fine-grained operations, such as\nstring normalization, for each individual example at scale. Experimental\nresults show that models pre-trained on ProX-curated data outperform either\noriginal data or data filtered by other selection methods by more than 2%\nacross various downstream benchmarks. Its effectiveness spans various model\nsizes and pre-training corpora, including C4, RedPajama-V2, FineWeb,\nFineWeb-Edu, and DCLM. Furthermore, ProX exhibits significant potential in\ndomain-specific continual pre-training: without domain specific design, models\ntrained on OpenWebMath refined by ProX outperform human-crafted rule-based\nmethods, improving average accuracy by 7.6% over Mistral-7B, with 14.6% for\nLlama-2-7B and 20.3% for CodeLlama-7B, all within 10B tokens to be comparable\nto models like Llemma-7B trained on 200B tokens. Further analysis highlights\nthat ProX significantly saves training FLOPs, offering a promising path for\nefficient LLM pre-training.

Nowadays, robotic arm\nmanufactures are aimed to their robots could increasingly perform tasks\ncollaborating with humans. One of the ways to improve this collaboration is by\nmaking the movement of robots more humanlike. This way, it would be easier for\na human to foresee the movement of the robot and approach it without fear of\ncontact. The main difference between the movement of a human and of a robotic\narm is that the former has a bell-shaped speed profile while the latter has a\nuniform speed one. To generate this speed profile, the kinematic theory of\nrapid human movements and its Sigma-Lognormal model has been used. This model\nis widely used to explain most of the basic phenomena related to the control of\nhuman movements. Both human-like and robotic-like movements are transferred to\nthe UR3 robot. In this paper we detail the how the UR3 robot was programmed to\nproduce both kinds of movement. The dissimilarities result between the input\nmotion and output motion to the robot confirm the possibility to develop\nhuman-like velocities in the UR3 robot.",

However, most solutions for soft robot proprioception use\ndedicated sensors, particularly for external forces, which introduce design\ntrade-offs, rigidity, and risk of failure. This work presents an approach for\npose estimation and contact detection for soft robots actuated by shape memory\nalloy (SMA) artificial muscles, using no dedicated force sensors. Our framework\nuses the unique material properties of SMAs to self-sense their internal\nstress, via offboard measurements of their electrical resistance and in-situ\ntemperature readings, in an existing fully-soft limb design. We demonstrate\nthat a simple polynomial regression model on these measurements is sufficient\nto predict the robot's pose, under no-contact conditions. Then, we show that if\nan additional measurement of the true pose is available (e.g. from an\nalready-in-place bending sensor), it is possible to predict a binary\ncontact/no-contact using multiple combinations of self-sensing signals. Our\nhardware tests verify our hypothesis via a contact detection test with a human\noperator. This proof-of-concept validates that self-sensing signals in soft\nSMA-actuated soft robots can be used for proprioception and contact detection,\nand suggests a direction for integrating proprioception into soft robots\nwithout design compromises.

Unfortunately, the\nlearned qualitative knowledge is opaque, preventing easy inspection,\nvalidation, or adaptation against available QR models. So far, it is possible\nto associate pre-defined concepts with latent representations of DNNs, but\nextractable relations are mostly limited to semantic similarity. As a next step\ntowards QR for validation and verification of DNNs: Concretely, we propose a\nmethod that extracts the learned superclass hierarchy from a multimodal DNN for\na given set of leaf concepts. Under the hood we (1) obtain leaf concept\nembeddings using the DNN's textual input modality; (2) apply hierarchical\nclustering to them, using that DNNs encode semantic similarities via vector\ndistances; and (3) label the such-obtained parent concepts using search in\navailable ontologies from QR.

We aim to isolate the effects of the internal temperature on the\nmixing efficiency in the atmospheres of Ultra Hot Jupiters (UHJ) and the\nspacial distribution of cloud particles across the globe. We couple a\nsimplified tracer based cloud model, picket fence radiative-transfer scheme and\nmixing length theory to the Exo-FMS general circulation model. We run the model\nfor five different internal temperatures at typical UHJ atmosphere system\nparameters. Our results show the convective eddy diffusion coefficient remains\nlow throughout the vast majority of the atmosphere, with mixing dominated by\nadvective flows. However, some regions can show convective mixing in the upper\natmosphere for colder interior temperatures. The vertical extent of the clouds\nis reduced as the internal temperature is increased. Additionally, a global\ncloud layer gets formed below the radiative-convective boundary (RCB) in the\ncooler cases. Convection is generally strongly inhibited in UHJ atmospheres\nabove the RCB due to their strong irradiation. Convective mixing plays a minor\nrole compared to advective mixing in keeping cloud particles aloft in ultra hot\nJupiters with warm interiors. Higher vertical turbulent heat fluxes and the\nadvection of potential temperature inhibit convection in warmer interiors. Our\nresults suggest isolated upper atmosphere regions above cold interiors may\nexhibit strong convective mixing in isolated regions around Rossby gyres,\nallowing aerosols to be better retained in these areas.",

We then develop computationally efficient criteria for SFO and\nSOC within the context of generically diagonalizable systems. Our work expands\nthe class of systems amenable to polynomial-time SOC verification. Thanks to\nthe simplicity of the obtained criteria, we derive closed-form solutions for\ndetermining the minimal sensor placement to achieve SFO and the minimal\nactuator deployment to achieve SOC in such systems, along with efficient\nweighted maximum matching based and weighted maximum flow based algorithms. For\nmore general systems to achieve SFO, an upper bound is given by identifying a\nnon-decreasing property of SFO with respect to a specific class of edge\nadditions, which is shown to be optimal under certain circumstances.",

Detection-based approaches have until now been largely discarded\nfor HTR because reading characters separately is often challenging, and\ncharacter-level annotation is difficult and expensive. We overcome these\nchallenges thanks to three main insights: (i) synthetic pre-training with\nsufficiently diverse data enables learning reasonable character localization\nfor any script; (ii) modern transformer-based detectors can jointly detect a\nlarge number of instances, and, if trained with an adequate masking strategy,\nleverage consistency between the different detections; (iii) once a pre-trained\ndetection model with approximate character localization is available, it is\npossible to fine-tune it with line-level annotation on real data, even with a\ndifferent alphabet. Our approach, dubbed DTLR, builds on a completely different\nparadigm than state-of-the-art HTR methods, which rely on autoregressive\ndecoding, predicting character values one by one, while we treat a complete\nline in parallel. Remarkably, we demonstrate good performance on a large range\nof scripts, usually tackled with specialized approaches.

The model profiles\nof the distributions of the velocity VR demonstrate a periodic increase and the\nformation of a hump (elevation) in the distance range of 6--7 kpc. The average\namplitude and period of variations in the velocity VR are A=1.76 +/- 0.15 km\ns-1 and P=2.1 +/- 0.1 Gyr. We calculated angles theta_01, theta_02 and theta_03\nwhich determine orientations of orbits relative to the major axis of the bar at\nthe time intervals: 0--1, 1--2 and 2--3 Gyr from the start of simulation. Stars\nwhose orbits change orientations as follows: 0 <theta_01< 45 degrees, -45\n<theta_02< 0 degrees and 0 <theta_03< 45 degrees, make a significant\ncontribution to the hump formation. The fraction of orbits trapped into\nlibration among orbits lying both inside and outside the Outer Lindblad\nResonance (OLR) is 28%. The median period P of long-term variations in the\nangular momentum and total energy of stars increases as Jacobi energy\napproaches the values typical for the OLR but then sharply drops. The\ndistribution of model stars over the period P has two maxima located at P=0.6\nand 1.9 Gyr. Stars with orbits lying both inside and outside the corotation\nradius (CR) concentrate to the first maximum. The distribution of stars whose\norbits lie both inside and outside the OLR depends on their orientation. The\nfact that the observed profile of the VR-velocity distribution derived from the\nGaia DR3 data does not show a hump suggests that the age of the Galactic bar,\ncounted from the moment of reaching its full power, must lie near one of two\nvalues: 2.0 +/- 0.3 or 4.0 +/- 0.5 Gyr.",

One drawback however\nis the significant high computational complexity and memory consumption, which\nmakes them unfeasible to run real-time on embedded platforms because of the\nlimited hardware resources. Block floating point (BFP) quantization is one of\nthe representative compression approaches for reducing the memory and\ncomputational burden owing to their capability to effectively capture the broad\ndata distribution of DNN models. Unfortunately, prior works on BFP-based\nquantization empirically choose the block size and the precision that preserve\naccuracy. In this paper, we develop a BFP-based bitwidth-aware analytical\nmodeling framework (called ``BitQ'') for the best BFP implementation of DNN\ninference on embedded platforms. We formulate and resolve an optimization\nproblem to identify the optimal BFP block size and bitwidth distribution by the\ntrade-off of both accuracy and performance loss. Experimental results show that\ncompared with an equal bitwidth setting, the BFP DNNs with optimized bitwidth\nallocation provide efficient computation, preserving accuracy on famous\nbenchmarks.

Recent studies show that\nreducing addition costs via low-precision accumulation improves throughput,\npower, and area across inference platforms, albeit with an increased risk of\noverflow. Accumulator-aware quantization research has so far only considered\nthe quantization-aware training (QAT) paradigm, in which models are fine-tuned\nor trained from scratch with quantization in the loop. As models and datasets\ncontinue to grow in size, QAT techniques become increasingly more expensive,\nwhich has motivated the recent surge in post-training quantization (PTQ)\nresearch. To bridge this gap, we introduce AXE, the first accumulator-aware\nquantization framework explicitly designed to endow overflow avoidance\nguarantees to PTQ algorithms. We present theoretical motivation for AXE and\ndemonstrate its flexibility by implementing it on top of two existing\nalgorithms: GPFQ and OPTQ. We design AXE to support multi-stage accumulation,\nopening the door to full datapath optimization for the first time. We evaluate\nAXE using recent language generation models; when quantizing Llama3 8B for a\n16-bit multi-stage accumulation datapath, AXE maintains up to 98% of the FP16\nperplexity, surpassing naive bit width manipulation by up to 15%.",

Holding constant all variables other than imaging quality, we\npresent the performance of the CNNs on reserved test set data for each image\nquality. The success of CNNs on a given dataset is found to be sensitive to\nboth imaging depth and resolution. We find that post-merger recovery generally\nincreases with depth, but that limiting 5 sigma point-source depths in excess\nof ~25 mag, similar to what is achieved in CFIS, are only marginally\nbeneficial.

My analysis shows that ACT and WMAP data, when combined with\nDESI BAO and Pantheon-plus Supernovae, yield independent constraints with a\nprecision comparable to Planck. Notably, in this case, the cosmological\nconstant value is recovered within two standard deviations. A preference for\nDDE reappears when Pantheon-plus is replaced with distance moduli measurements\nfrom the Dark Energy Survey Supernova program (DESy5). However, it remains less\npronounced compared to the Planck-based results. When considering SPT data, no\nclear preference for DDE is found in combinations involving Pantheon-plus\nSupernovae, and the preference is significantly weaker in combinations\ninvolving DESy5. Overall, CMB experiments other than Planck generally weaken\nthe evidence for DDE.

    "abstract": "A mathematical description of the reduced dynamics of an open quantum system\ncan often be given in terms of a completely positive and trace preserving\n(CPTP) map, also known as quantum channel. In a seminal work by Wolf et al.\n[Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 150402 (2008)], it was shown that deciding whether a\ngiven quantum channel was generated from an underlying effective Markovian\ndynamics, with time-independent generator of Lindblad form, is generally an\nNP-hard problem. The difficulty is related to the fact that one has to search\nthrough all possible branches of the operator logarithm of the map, in order to\nidentify, if any of the resulting effective generators is of Lindblad form. In\nthis work we show that in cases where one has access to the full reduced\ndynamics at all previous times (the dynamical map) one can significantly\nfacilitate the search for an effective generator by making use of Floquet\ntheory. By performing a spectral unwinding such that the effective micromotion\nis minimized, the effective Floquet generator is often an excellent candidate\nfor an effective generator of Lindblad form. This significantly reduces the\ncomplexity of the search for an effective generator of Lindblad form in many\n(though not all) cases.

However, field trials often\nyield suboptimal results due to the presence of indigenous soil microbes. To\nevaluate their impact, bacteria from natural soil were classified into two\ngroups: low-ureolysis and high-ureolysis. These were combined with S. pasteurii\nin experiments using microfluidic chips and sand columns. The analysis covered\nbacterial populations, urease activity, pH changes, calcium carbonate crystal\nmetrics, and unconfined compressive strength (UCS). Results indicated that\nmixing low-ureolysis bacteria with S. pasteurii resulted in a 74-84% reduction\nin bacterial activity and a 60% decrease in chemical conversion rate, leading\nto a 60% drop in UCS. In contrast, combining high-ureolysis bacteria with S.\npasteurii reduced bacterial activity by 49-54%, which was less than the 64%\nreduction seen with S. pasteurii alone. This combination improved calcium\ncarbonate conversion rates by 9% to 45% and slightly enhanced UCS.The study\nhighlights the distinct effects of low-ureolysis and high-ureolysis bacteria on\nMICP efficiency, particularly regarding their influence on pH. Low-ureolysis\nbacteria decrease pH, while high-ureolysis bacteria increase it. Maintaining\nhigh bacterial activity and precipitation rates is crucially dependent on pH\nlevels.

    "abstract": "Scaling model size significantly challenges the deployment and inference of\nLarge Language Models (LLMs). Due to the redundancy in LLM weights, recent\nresearch has focused on pushing weight-only quantization to extremely low-bit\n(even down to 2 bits). It reduces memory requirements, optimizes storage costs,\nand decreases memory bandwidth needs during inference. However, due to\nnumerical representation limitations, traditional scalar-based weight\nquantization struggles to achieve such extreme low-bit. Recent research on\nVector Quantization (VQ) for LLMs has demonstrated the potential for extremely\nlow-bit model quantization by compressing vectors into indices using lookup\ntables.\n  In this paper, we introduce Vector Post-Training Quantization (VPTQ) for\nextremely low-bit quantization of LLMs. We use Second-Order Optimization to\nformulate the LLM VQ problem and guide our quantization algorithm design by\nsolving the optimization. We further refine the weights using\nChannel-Independent Second-Order Optimization for a granular VQ. In addition,\nby decomposing the optimization problem, we propose a brief and effective\ncodebook initialization algorithm. We also extend VPTQ to support residual and\noutlier quantization, which enhances model accuracy and further compresses the\nmodel. Our experimental results show that VPTQ reduces model quantization\nperplexity by $0.01$-$0.34$ on LLaMA-2, $0.38$-$0.68$ on Mistral-7B,\n$4.41$-$7.34$ on LLaMA-3 over SOTA at 2-bit, with an average accuracy\nimprovement of $0.79$-$1.5\\%$ on LLaMA-2, $1\\%$ on Mistral-7B, $11$-$22\\%$ on\nLLaMA-3 on QA tasks on average.

      "Andrés Franco-Grisales"
    ],
    "abstract": "In a recent work, Ringstr\\\"om proposed a geometric notion of initial data on\nbig bang singularities. Moreover, he conjectured that initial data on the\nsingularity could be used to parameterize quiescent solutions to Einstein's\nequations; that is, roughly speaking, solutions whose leading order asymptotics\nare convergent. We prove that given initial data on the singularity for the\nEinstein-nonlinear scalar field equations in 4 spacetime dimensions, as defined\nby Ringstr\\\"om, there is a corresponding unique development of the data. We do\nnot assume any symmetry or analyticity, and we allow for arbitrary closed\nspatial topology. Our results thus present an important step towards resolving\nRingstr\\\"om's conjecture. Furthermore, our results show that the\nEinstein-nonlinear scalar field equations have a geometric singular initial\nvalue problem formulation, which is analogous to the classical result by\nChoquet-Bruhat and Geroch for initial data on a Cauchy hypersurface.\n  In the literature, there are two conditions which are expected to ensure that\nquiescent behavior occurs. The first one is an integrability condition on a\nspecial spatial frame. The second one is an algebraic condition on the\neigenvalues of the expansion normalized Weingarten map associated with a\nfoliation of the spacetime near the singularity. Our result is the first such\nresult where both possibilities are allowed. That is, we allow for the first\ncondition to ensure quiescence in one region of space and for the second\ncondition to take over in the region where the first one is violated. This fact\nallows for our results to include the vacuum setting.",

Addressing this requires domain generalization (DG)\nalgorithms. However, a systematic evaluation of DG algorithms in the CPath\ncontext is lacking. This study aims to benchmark the effectiveness of 30 DG\nalgorithms on 3 CPath tasks of varying difficulty through 7,560\ncross-validation runs. We evaluate these algorithms using a unified and robust\nplatform, incorporating modality-specific techniques and recent advances like\npretrained foundation models. Our extensive cross-validation experiments\nprovide insights into the relative performance of various DG strategies. We\nobserve that self-supervised learning and stain augmentation consistently\noutperform other methods, highlighting the potential of pretrained models and\ndata augmentation. Furthermore, we introduce a new pan-cancer tumor detection\ndataset (HISTOPANTUM) as a benchmark for future research. This study offers\nvaluable guidance to researchers in selecting appropriate DG approaches for\nCPath tasks.",

    "abstract": "In June 1925 Heisenberg arrived at Helgoland/Heligoland island to escape a\nfit of hay fever. He returned with a sketch of a strange theory of the\nmicro-world, which we now call quantum mechanics. This essay attempts to\npresent a look at this theory, which tries to return to the original insight of\nHeisenberg on what should be the essence of a theory of atomic realm: it must\nbe a theory of the observable events, in which fundamentally unobservable\nquantities have no place. No ontological status is given to elements of the\nmathematical formulation of the theory. The theory is about our description of\nevents in laboratories, probabilities of which are given by the Born rule.\n  Following Bohr, these events involve macroscopic measuring apparatuses, and\nthe accessible final events are classically describable. Information about the\nevents is cloneable, as it is of a classical nature.\n  The modern quantum theory of classicality is the decoherence theory. It\ntreats \"the pointer variable\" of measuring apparatus as an open system\ninteracting with an environment consisting of all other \"zillions\" of degrees\nof freedom of the device, and anything coupled to it. Because such environment\nis uncontrollable we have no possibility to reverse measurements. The quantum\nmechanical measurement theory based on decoherence theory is reproducing the\npredictions of Born rule.\n  Notwithstanding, possibility of reversing measurements and of application of\nBorn rule in situations other than these which lead to macroscopically\nobservable events are features of a modification of quantum mechanics which is\ncalled by its adherents \"unitary quantum mechanics\".\n  As its predictions, which go beyond quantum mechanics, are not testable - we\nclaim that unitary quantum mechanics in an interpretation of quantum mechanics.\nAs such it is metaphysics.",

However, these methods still face two challenges: the requirement for\ndozens of sampling steps to achieve satisfactory results, which limits\nefficiency in real scenarios, and the neglect of degradation models, which are\ncritical auxiliary information in solving the SR problem. In this work, we\nintroduced a novel one-step SR model, which significantly addresses the\nefficiency issue of diffusion-based SR methods. Unlike existing fine-tuning\nstrategies, we designed a degradation-guided Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) module\nspecifically for SR, which corrects the model parameters based on the\npre-estimated degradation information from low-resolution images. This module\nnot only facilitates a powerful data-dependent or degradation-dependent SR\nmodel but also preserves the generative prior of the pre-trained diffusion\nmodel as much as possible. Furthermore, we tailor a novel training pipeline by\nintroducing an online negative sample generation strategy. Combined with the\nclassifier-free guidance strategy during inference, it largely improves the\nperceptual quality of the super-resolution results. Extensive experiments have\ndemonstrated the superior efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed model\ncompared to recent state-of-the-art methods.",

The use of diverse modalities, including histopathology slides,\nMRI, and genetic data, offers unprecedented opportunities to improve prognosis\nprediction and to unveil new treatment pathways. Contrastive learning, widely\nused for deriving representations from paired data in multimodal tasks, assumes\nthat different views contain the same task-relevant information and leverages\nonly shared information. This assumption becomes restrictive when handling\nmedical data since each modality also harbors specific knowledge relevant to\ndownstream tasks. We introduce DRIM, a new multimodal method for capturing\nthese shared and unique representations, despite data sparsity. More\nspecifically, given a set of modalities, we aim to encode a representation for\neach one that can be divided into two components: one encapsulating\npatient-related information common across modalities and the other,\nencapsulating modality-specific details. This is achieved by increasing the\nshared information among different patient modalities while minimizing the\noverlap between shared and unique components within each modality.

In the context of mobile\nsurveillance utilizing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), achieving LPD\ncommunication presents significant challenges due to the UAVs' rapid and\ncontinuous movements, which are characterized by unknown nonlinear dynamics.\nTherefore, accurately predicting future locations of UAVs is essential for\nenabling real-time LPD communication. In this paper, we introduce a novel\nframework termed predictive covert communication, aimed at minimizing\ndetectability in terrestrial ad-hoc networks under multi-UAV surveillance. Our\ndata-driven method synergistically integrates graph neural networks (GNN) with\nKoopman theory to model the complex interactions within a multi-UAV network and\nfacilitating long-term predictions by linearizing the dynamics, even with\nlimited historical data. Extensive simulation results substantiate that the\npredicted trajectories using our method result in at least 63%-75% lower\nprobability of detection when compared to well-known state-of-the-art baseline\napproaches, showing promise in enabling low-latency covert operations in\npractical scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Given a finite ribbon category, which is a particular case of a cyclic\nalgebra over the operad of genus zero surfaces, there are two possibilities for\nan extension defined on all three-dimensional handlebodies: On the one hand,\none can use the admissible skein module construction of\nCostantino-Geer-Patureau-Mirand. On other hand, by a construction of the\nauthors using Costello's modular envelope, one can build a so-called ansular\nfunctor, a handlebody version of the notion of a modular functor. Unlike the\nadmissible skein modules with their construction through the Reshetikhin-Turaev\ngraphical calculus, the ansular functor is defined purely through a universal\nproperty. In this note, we prove the widely held expectation that these\nconstructions are related by giving an isomorphism between them, with the\nsomewhat surprising subtlety that we need to include consistently on one of the\nsides an additional boundary component labeled by the distinguished invertible\nobject of Etingof-Nikshych-Ostrik. In other words, the constructions agree on\nhandlebodies up to a `background charge' that becomes trivial in the unimodular\ncase. Our comparison result includes the handlebody group action as well as the\nskein algebra action.",

GeoBiked is curated to contain 4 355 bicycle\nimages, annotated with structural and technical features and is used to\ninvestigate two automated labeling techniques: The utilization of consolidated\nlatent features (Hyperfeatures) from image-generation models to detect\ngeometric correspondences (e.g. the position of the wheel center) in structural\nimages and the generation of diverse text descriptions for structural images.\nGPT-4o, a vision-language-model (VLM), is instructed to analyze images and\nproduce diverse descriptions aligned with the system-prompt. By representing\ntechnical images as Diffusion-Hyperfeatures, drawing geometric correspondences\nbetween them is possible. The detection accuracy of geometric points in unseen\nsamples is improved by presenting multiple annotated source images. GPT-4o has\nsufficient capabilities to generate accurate descriptions of technical images.\nGrounding the generation only on images leads to diverse descriptions but\ncauses hallucinations, while grounding it on categorical labels restricts the\ndiversity. Using both as input balances creativity and accuracy. Successfully\nusing Hyperfeatures for geometric correspondence suggests that this approach\ncan be used for general point-detection and annotation tasks in technical\nimages. Labeling such images with text descriptions using VLMs is possible, but\ndependent on the models detection capabilities, careful prompt-engineering and\nthe selection of input information. Applying foundation models in engineering\ndesign is largely unexplored.

Within this context, the simultaneous detection of significant\nfeatures and groups aimed at a specific response with false discovery rate\n(FDR) control stands as a crucial issue, such as the spatial genome-wide\nassociation studies. Existing methods typically require maintaining the same\ndetection approach at different resolutions to achieve multilayer FDR control,\nwhich may be not efficient. For instance, it is unsuitable to apply knockoff\nmethod to detect features with high correlations, therefore, the efficiency of\nmultilayer knockoff filter (MKF) is also not guaranteed. To tackle this\nproblem, we introduce a novel method of derandomized flexible e-filter\nprocedure (DFEFP) by developing generalized e-values. This method utilizes a\nwide variety of base detection procedures that operate effectively across\nvarious resolutions to provide stable and consistent results, while controlling\nthe false discovery rate at multiple resolutions simultaneously. Furthermore,\nwe investigate the statistical properties of the DFEFP, encompassing multilayer\nFDR control, stability guarantee, and solution correctness of algorithm. The\nDFEFP is initially exemplified to construct an e-value data splitting filter\n(eDS-filter). Subsequently, the eDS-filter in combination with the group\nknockoff filter (gKF) is used to develop more flexible methodology which\nreferred to as the eDS+gKF-filter. Simulation studies demonstrate that the\neDS+gKF-filter effectively controls FDR at multiple resolutions while either\nmaintaining or enhancing power compared to MKF.

Our analysis begins with a specific case involving a truncated\nP\\\"oschl-Teller potential for which we derive an explicit form of the\ncriterion. Notably, it is shown analytically, contrary to other cases studied\nin the literature, that the fundamental mode is stable. These derivations are\nthen generalized to a broader context, embracing two underlying mathematical\nformalisms. Specifically, the spiral is attributed to either the poles in the\nblack hole's reflection amplitude or the zeros in the transmission amplitude.\nAdditionally, we revisit and then generalize a toy model in which perturbations\nto the effective potential are disjointed, demonstrating that such a\nconfiguration invariably leads to instability in the fundamental mode, and the\nresulting outward spiral always occurs in the counter-clockwise direction. The\nderived criterion is not restricted to the fundamental mode but is generally\nrelevant for the first few low-lying modes.

However, existing RIS methods tend to explore top-performance\nmodels, disregarding considerations for practical applications on\nresources-limited edge devices. This oversight poses a significant challenge\nfor on-device RIS inference. To this end, we propose an effective and efficient\npost-training quantization framework termed PTQ4RIS. Specifically, we first\nconduct an in-depth analysis of the root causes of performance degradation in\nRIS model quantization and propose dual-region quantization (DRQ) and\nreorder-based outlier-retained quantization (RORQ) to address the quantization\ndifficulties in visual and text encoders. Extensive experiments on three\nbenchmarks with different bits settings (from 8 to 4 bits) demonstrates its\nsuperior performance. Importantly, we are the first PTQ method specifically\ndesigned for the RIS task, highlighting the feasibility of PTQ in RIS\napplications.

Fundamentally,\nthis is due to the fact that one cannot measure the same particle multiple\ntimes. We propose a simple experiment that uses a cell sorter to distinguish\ninstrument-specific variation. For a population of beads whose intensities are\ndistributed around a single peak, the sorter is used to collect beads whose\nmeasured intensities lie below some threshold. This subset of particles is then\nremeasured. If the variation in the measured values is only due to the sample,\nthe second set of measurements should also lie entirely below our threshold.\nAny 'spillover' is therefore due to instrument specific effects - we\ndemonstrate how the distribution of the post-sort measurements is sufficient to\nextract an estimate of the cumulative variability induced by the instrument. A\ndistinguishing feature of our work is that we do not make any assumptions about\nthe sources of said noise. We then show how 'local affine transformations' let\nus transfer these estimates to cytometers not equipped with a sorter. We use\nour analysis to estimate noise for a set of three instruments and two bead\ntypes, across a range of sample flow rates.

To determine the\ncorrect symbol in the decoder, each of these methods requires the comparison of\na state variable with subinterval boundaries. In adaptive operation,\nconsidering varying symbol statistics, an array of interval boundaries must\nadditionally be kept up to date. The larger the symbol alphabet, the more\ntime-consuming both the search for the correct subinterval and the updating of\ninterval borders become.\n  Detailed pseudo-code is used to discuss different approaches to speed up the\nsymbol search in the decoder and the adaptation of the array of interval\nborders, both depending on the chosen alphabet size. It is shown that reducing\nthe $\\mathcal{O}$-complexity does not lead to an acceleration in practical\nimplementations if the alphabet size is too small. In adaptive compression\nmode, the binary indexing method proves to be superior when considering the\noverall processing time. Although the symbol search (in the decoder) takes\nlonger than with other algorithms, the faster updating of the array of interval\nborders more than compensates for this disadvantage.

Despite its potential, this approach\nhas only been demonstrated on 2D and quasi-2D targets to date. As such, this\npaper presents the first 3D implementation of an interior cloak. Here, the\ndesign of a cloak array capable of hiding a conductive, circular cylinder in\nfree-space is first presented. Cloaking performance is then validated via\nfull-wave simulations and an experimental demonstration in which the device\nsuccessfully suppresses scattering when the target is illuminated by a ridged\nhorn antenna at 1.2 GHz.",

For example, if a\nuser asks the robot to find an object in a home environment with underspecified\ninstructions, the object could be in multiple locations depending on missing\nfactors. For instance, a bowl might be in the kitchen cabinet or on the dining\nroom table, depending on whether it is clean or dirty, full or empty, and the\npresence of other objects around it.

This paper focuses on these\ngaps and presents a novel model-agnostic approach leveraging semantically\ndriven clarifications to enhance the robot's ability to locate queried objects\nin fewer attempts.

The\nobservations are used to characterize the morphology, velocity field, and the\nphysical conditions in the G1 - G3 filaments. The velocity-resolved [C II]\nspectra show evidence of a velocity shift at the head of the brightest G1\nfilament, possibly caused by radiation pressure from the impinging UV photons\nor the rocket effect of the evaporating gas. Archival Herschel PACS and SPIRE\ndata imply H2 column densities in the range 10^{21} - 10^{22} cm^{-2},\ncorresponding to maximum visual extinction AV = 10 mag, and average H2 volume\ndensity of about 4500 cm^{-3} in the filaments. The [C II] emission traces ~\n17% of the total H2 column density, as derived from dust SED fits. PDR models\nare unable to explain the observed line intensities of the two [O I] fine\nstructure lines in IC1848, with the observed [O I] 145 {\\mu}m line being too\nstrong compared to the model predictions.

This process operates on multiple\ntimescales, with the final radiative step consisting of spontaneous emission,\nwhich can be modeled within the framework of quasi-equilibrium fluctuational\nelectrodynamics. Scintillation can therefore be controlled and enhanced via\nnanophotonic effects, which has been proposed and experimentally demonstrated.\nSuch designs have thus far obeyed Lorentz reciprocity, meaning there is a\ndirect equivalence between scintillation emission and absorption by the\nscintillator.

    "abstract": "Optical flow has made great progress in clean scenes, while suffers\ndegradation under adverse weather due to the violation of the brightness\nconstancy and gradient continuity assumptions of optical flow. Typically,\nexisting methods mainly adopt domain adaptation to transfer motion knowledge\nfrom clean to degraded domain through one-stage adaptation. However, this\ndirect adaptation is ineffective, since there exists a large gap due to adverse\nweather and scene style between clean and real degraded domains. Moreover, even\nwithin the degraded domain itself, static weather (e.g., fog) and dynamic\nweather (e.g., rain) have different impacts on optical flow. To address above\nissues, we explore synthetic degraded domain as an intermediate bridge between\nclean and real degraded domains, and propose a cumulative\nhomogeneous-heterogeneous adaptation framework for real adverse weather optical\nflow. Specifically, for clean-degraded transfer, our key insight is that static\nweather possesses the depth-association homogeneous feature which does not\nchange the intrinsic motion of the scene, while dynamic weather additionally\nintroduces the heterogeneous feature which results in a significant boundary\ndiscrepancy in warp errors between clean and degraded domains. For\nsynthetic-real transfer, we figure out that cost volume correlation shares a\nsimilar statistical histogram between synthetic and real degraded domains,\nbenefiting to holistically aligning the homogeneous correlation distribution\nfor synthetic-real knowledge distillation. Under this unified framework, the\nproposed method can progressively and explicitly transfer knowledge from clean\nscenes to real adverse weather. In addition, we further collect a real adverse\nweather dataset with manually annotated optical flow labels and perform\nextensive experiments to verify the superiority of the proposed method.",

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a method to preserve privacy in\ncollaborative distributed learning. In FL, clients train AI models directly on\ntheir devices rather than sharing data with a centralized server, which can\npose privacy risks. However, it has been shown that despite FL's partial\nprotection of local data privacy, information about clients' data can still be\ninferred from shared model updates during training. In recent years, several\nprivacy-preserving approaches have been developed to mitigate this privacy\nleakage in FL, though they often provide privacy at the cost of model\nperformance or system efficiency. Balancing these trade-offs presents a\nsignificant challenge in implementing FL schemes. In this manuscript, we\nintroduce a privacy-preserving FL framework that combines differential privacy\nand system immersion tools from control theory. The core idea is to treat the\noptimization algorithms used in standard FL schemes (e.g., gradient-based\nalgorithms) as a dynamical system that we seek to immerse into a\nhigher-dimensional system (referred to as the target optimization algorithm).\nThe target algorithm's dynamics are designed such that, first, the model\nparameters of the original algorithm are immersed in its parameters; second, it\noperates on distorted parameters; and third, it converges to an encoded version\nof the true model parameters from the original algorithm. These encoded\nparameters can then be decoded at the server to retrieve the original model\nparameters. We demonstrate that the proposed privacy-preserving scheme can be\ntailored to offer any desired level of differential privacy for both local and\nglobal model parameters, while maintaining the same accuracy and convergence\nrate as standard FL algorithms.",

Understanding this\nis crucial for the design and optimisation of future nanotechnology\nscintillators. In this work, we address these open questions by theoretically\nand experimentally studying the size-dependent scintillation of CsPbBr3\nnanocrystals using a combination of Monte Carlo simulations, spectroscopic, and\nradiometric techniques. The results reveal and unravel a complex parametric\nspace where the fine balance between the simultaneous effects of size-dependent\nenergy deposition, (multi-)exciton population, and light emission under\nionizing excitation, typical of confined particles, combine to maximize the\nscintillation efficiency and time performance of larger nanocrystals due to\ngreater stopping power and reduced Auger decay. The remarkable agreement\nbetween theory and experiment produces a fully validated descriptive model that\nunprecedentedly predicts the scintillation yield and kinetics of nanocrystals\nwithout free parameters, providing the first fundamental guide for the rational\ndesign of nanoscale scintillators.",

    "abstract": "In a previous paper, we introduced a new tool called GaiaPMEX. It\ncharacterizes the mass and semi-major axis relative to the central star (sma)\nof a possible companion around any source observed with Gaia. It uses the value\nof RUWE, or, with both Gaia and Hipparcos, the value of proper motion anomaly\n(PMa), alone or combined with the RUWE. Our goal is to exploit the large volume\nof sources in Gaia's DR3 and find new exoplanet candidates. We wish to create a\nnew input catalog of planet-candidate hosting systems to the disposal of future\nfollow-up projects. Beyond G=14, this catalog would prepare the arrival of\npowerful instruments on the ELTs, that could include RV follow-up of faint\nstars and direct imaging of planets around main sequence Gyr-old stars. We used\nthe mass-sma degenerate set of solutions obtained by GaiaPMEX from any value of\nRUWE to select a sample of bright (G<16) Gaia sources whose companions could be\nplanetary, with a mass <13.5 MJup. It led us to identify a sample of 9,698\nplanet candidate hosting sources, whose companion may have a mass <13.5 MJup in\nthe range of 1-3-au sma. We identified 19 systems that are also reported in the\nNasa exoplanet archive. We detected 8 substellar companions with a 1-3-au sma,\ninitially discovered and characterised with RV and astrometry. Moreover, we\nfound 6 transiting-planet systems and 2 wide-orbit systems for whom we predict\nthe existence of supplementary companions. Focusing on the subsample of sources\nobserved with Hipparcos, combining RUWE and PMa, we confirmed the\nidentification of 4 new planetary candidate systems HD 187129, HD 81697, CD-42\n883, and HD 105330. Given the degeneracy of mass-sma, many of the candidates in\nthis 9,698 sources catalog might have a larger mass, in the brown-dwarf and\nstellar domain, if their sma departs from the 1-3-au range. The vetting of this\nlarge catalog will be the subject of future studies.",

Although\nthe harvest is expected to occur when the astrometric time series will be\npublished with DR4 at the eve of 2026, the DR3 is already a precious database\nto search for exoplanet beyond 1 au. With this objective, we characterized\nmultiple systems by exploiting two astrometric signatures derived from the DR3\nastrometric solution of bright sources (G<16). We have the proper motion\nanomaly, or PMa, for sources also observed with Hipparcos, and the excess of\nresiduals in the RUWE and the astrometric excess noise (AEN). Those astrometric\nsignatures give an accurate measurement of the astrometric motion of a source\nseen with Gaia, even in the presence of calibration and measurement noises. We\nfound that they can allow identifying stellar binaries and hint to companions\nwith a mass in the planetary domain. We introduce a tool called GaiaPMEX, that\nis able, for a given source, to model its astrometric signatures, by a\nphotocenter orbit due to a companion with certain mass and semi-major axis\n(sma). Comparing to their actual measurements from the DR3 and Hipparcos,\nGaiaPMEX calculates a confidence map of the possible companion's mass and sma.\nThe constraints on mass are, as expected, degenerate, but when allowed,\ncoupling the use of PMa and RUWE, may significantly narrow the space of\nsolutions. Thanks to combining Gaia and Hipparcos, planets are expected to be\nmost frequently found within 1-10 au from their star, at the scale of\nEarth-to-Saturn orbits. In this range, exoplanets with mass down to 0.1 MJup\nare more favorably detected around M-dwarfs closer than 10 pc. Some fraction,\nif not all, of companions identified with GaiaPMEX may be characterized in the\nfuture using the astrometric time series that will be published with the DR4.",

In the\ncontext of increasingly extreme summers, this study focuses on European summer\nWRs (June-August, JJA) over the last three decades (1990-2019), and aims to\nexamine the changing characteristics of these WRs and their potential\nimplications. In addition, based on ERA5 reanalysis data, the WR representation\nfrom a carefully preselected, small ensemble of global general circulation\nmodels (GCMs) is analyzed. A methodological refinement concerns the combination\nof Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) with a novel GCM selection technique, which\nenhances the robustness of the simulated large-scale circulation patterns. WRs\nare defined using daily sea level pressure (SLP) and wind in the upper\ntroposphere. Results reveal that the SOM captures predominant European summer\nsynoptic patterns, and the salient result is a positive trend in 2 m air\ntemperature across nearly all WRs. The selected GCMs - MPI-ESM1-2-LR r29i1p1f1,\nCanESM5 r1i1p1f1 and MRI-ESM2-0 r5i1p1f1 - identify WRs correctly and\nERA5-based results are always within the range of this small GCM ensemble. Its\nmembers clearly show skill in representing large-scale WRs accurately and,\nthus, serve as valuable tools for studying synoptic weather patterns during\nsummer in Central Europe. Therefore, we can recommend these GCMs for studies on\nWR-related climate projections of future summer conditions, particularly for\nthose interested in climate impacts in Central Europe from a synoptic-scale\nperspective.",

To achieve this, researchers are currently investigating the\nuse of data influence to measure the importance of data instances, $i.e.,$ a\nhigh influence score indicates that incorporating this instance to the training\nset is likely to enhance the model performance. Consequently, they select the\ntop-$k$ instances with the highest scores. However, this approach has several\nlimitations. (1) Computing the influence of all available data is\ntime-consuming.

For the\ndiversity, \\texttt{Quad} clusters the dataset into similar data instances\nwithin each cluster and diverse instances across different clusters.

In this work, we revisit the description\nof this period of Triton's history, by developing methods that allow us to\nsimulate high-eccentricity spin-orbit evolution for an arbitrary rheological\nmodel. Our aim is to provide a framework on which future work can build with\nmore detailed planetological models, while still capturing the full intricacies\nof high-eccentricity tidal evolution. We forego simplifications used in past\nwork and rather determine the convergence properties of each infinite sum in\nthe Darwin-Kaula expansion, truncating them appropriately. We achieve this with\na new conservative empirical upper bound on the expansion into eccentricity\nfunctions of part of the tidal potential, and with a novel, fast-converging\npower series expansion for these eccentricity functions borrowed from\nartificial satellite theory. Consequently, we examine the case of Triton. We\nfind that the use of the constant time lag model fails to match the capture\ninto spin-orbit resonances we expect from a sufficiently viscous icy body at\nnon-zero eccentricities. Additionally, we find that Triton can have experienced\ntidal heating rates orders of magnitude greater even than present-day Io, and\nso likely possessed a massive Titan-like atmosphere throughout its tidal\nevolution, with a surface or thin-shell ocean. Whether this would significantly\nextend the epoch of tidal heating will be the subject of future work.",

    "abstract": "Background and purpose: IMPT faces challenges in lung cancer treatment, like\nmaintaining plan robustness for moving tumors against setup, range errors, and\ninterplay effects. Proton Arc Therapy (PAT) is an alternative to maintain\ntarget coverage, potentially improving organ at risk (OAR) sparing, reducing\nbeam delivery time (BDT), and enhancing patient experience. We aim to perform a\nsystematic plan comparison study between IMPT and ELSA-PAT to assess its\npotential for lung cancer treatment. Material and Methods: 14 Lung ELSA-PAT\nplans were compared retrospectively with IMPT plans. 4D worst-case minimax\nrobust optimization was performed, including 84 scenarios (3%,3 mm). Dosimetry\nassessment included target (CTV) and important OARs, on nominal and worst-case\nscenarios. Most relevant normal tissue complication probabilities (NTCP),\ntarget coverage robustness against interplay effect and beam delivery time\n(BDT) were evaluated. Results: CTV D95% and D98% showed no significant\ndifference in comparison. PAT demonstrated better conformality by 66% (p =\n0.00012) but delivered a higher heart mean dose (HMD,23%). There was a 2%\nincrease in NTCP 2-year mortality risk with PAT. Total BDT was comparable among\ntechniques. IMPT was more robust than PAT against interplay effect, considering\nboth D1% (1,0 $\\pm$ 0.8 Gy vs 1.1 $\\pm$ 1.4 Gy) and D98% bandwidths\n(0.9$\\pm$0.9 Gy vs 1.1 $\\pm$ 1.3 Gy). Interpretation: both techniques provide a\nsimilar level of dose coverage to the target volume. Although PAT improved dose\nconformality, higher HMD translated into increased heart toxicity, presumably\ndue to chosen planning methodology and OAR proximity to target. Increased\nenergy layers and spots raised PAT beam delivery time, although it could\nimprove daily treatment workflow.",

Our study is based on 231 and\n164 spectroscopic redshifts, for the clusters A76 and A1307, respectively. We\nfind that A76 and A1307 are two galaxy clusters at $z=0.0390$ and 0.0815,\nrespectively, with velocity dispersions of $650 \\pm 56$ km s$^{-1}$ and $863\n\\pm 85$ km s$^{-1}$, and showing velocity distributions following, in practice,\nGaussian profiles.

We find that the spatial distribution of likely cluster members\nin the case of A76 is very anisotropic, while A1307 shows a compact\ndistribution of galaxies, but double peaked and elongated in the south-north\ndirection. we compare the XMM-Newton surface brightness maps with galaxy\ndistributions and see that both distributions are correlated. We reconstruct\nthe total mass profile and velocity anisotropy of both clusters by analysing\nthe full projected phase space, through the MG-MAMPOSSt code. Our study reveals\na slight indication of radial orbits for A76, while A1307 seems to prefer more\nisotropic orbits in the whole cluster range. Summarizing, A76 represent a\ntypical young cluster, in an early stage of formation, with a very low X-ray\nsurface brightness but high temperature showing a very anisotropic galaxy\ndistribution. A1307 is however more consolidated and massive showing\nin-homogeneous galaxy distribution and an asymmetric X-ray emission, which\nsuggest a scenario characterised by recent minor mergers.",

    "abstract": "Despite a significant proportion of the Earth being covered in water,\nexploration of what lies below has been limited due to the challenges and\ndifficulties inherent in the process. Current state of the art robots such as\nRemotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) and Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are\nbulky, rigid and unable to conform to their environment. Soft robotics offers\nsolutions to this issue. Fluid-actuated eversion or growing robots, in\nparticular, are a good example. While current eversion robots have found many\napplications on land, their inherent properties make them particularly well\nsuited to underwater environments. An important factor when considering\nunderwater eversion robots is the establishment of a suitable steering\nmechanism that can enable the robot to change direction as required. This\nproject proposes a design for an eversion robot that is capable of steering\nwhile underwater, through the use of bending pouches, a design commonly seen in\nthe literature on land-based eversion robots. These bending pouches contract to\nenable directional change. Similar to their land-based counterparts, the\nunderwater eversion robot uses the same fluid in the medium it operates in to\nachieve extension and bending but also to additionally aid in neutral buoyancy.\nThe actuation method of bending pouches meant that robots needed to fully\nextend before steering was possible. Three robots, with the same design and\ndimensions were constructed from polyethylene tubes and tested. Our research\nshows that although the soft eversion robot design in this paper was not\ncapable of consistently generating the same amounts of bending for the\ninflation volume, it still achieved suitable bending at a range of inflation\nvolumes and was observed to bend to a maximum angle of 68 degrees at 2000 ml,\nwhich is in line with the bending angles reported for land-based eversion\nrobots in the literature.",

Traditional time series models, such\nas GRUs, have been widely used but often struggle to capture the intricate\nnonlinear dynamics of markets, particularly in the flexible selection and\neffective utilization of key historical information. Recently, methods like\nGraph Neural Networks and Reinforcement Learning have shown promise in stock\nprediction but require high data quality and quantity, and they tend to exhibit\ninstability when dealing with data sparsity and noise. Moreover, the training\nand inference processes for these models are typically complex and\ncomputationally expensive, limiting their broad deployment in practical\napplications. Existing approaches also generally struggle to capture\nunobservable latent market states effectively, such as market sentiment and\nexpectations, microstructural factors, and participant behavior patterns,\nleading to an inadequate understanding of market dynamics and subsequently\nimpact prediction accuracy. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a\nstock prediction model, MCI-GRU, based on a multi-head cross-attention\nmechanism and an improved GRU. First, we enhance the GRU model by replacing the\nreset gate with an attention mechanism, thereby increasing the model's\nflexibility in selecting and utilizing historical information. Second, we\ndesign a multi-head cross-attention mechanism for learning unobservable latent\nmarket state representations, which are further enriched through interactions\nwith both temporal features and cross-sectional features.

The\nconstruction of these random measures makes use of the Brownian motion and the\nPoisson random measure (which are the sources of noise in the original model\ndynamics) as well as the additional random variables, which are sampled on the\ngrid for the control execution. Then, we prove a limit theorem for these random\nmeasures as the mesh-size of the sampling grid goes to zero, which leads to the\ngrid-sampling limit SDE that is jointly driven by white noise random measures\nand a Poisson random measure. We also argue that the grid-sampling limit SDE\ncan substitute the exploratory SDE and the sample SDE of the recent\ncontinuous-time RL literature, i.e., it can be applied for the theoretical\nanalysis of exploratory control problems and for the derivation of learning\nalgorithms.",

    "abstract": "We propose a new stochastic proximal quasi-Newton method for minimizing the\nsum of two convex functions in the particular context that one of the functions\nis the average of a large number of smooth functions and the other one is\nnonsmooth. The new method integrates a simple single-loop SVRG (L-SVRG)\ntechnique for sampling the gradient and a stochastic limited-memory BFGS\n(L-BFGS) scheme for approximating the Hessian of the smooth function\ncomponents. The globally linear convergence rate of the new method is proved\nunder mild assumptions. It is also shown that the new method covers a proximal\nvariant of the L-SVRG as a special case, and it allows for various\ngeneralizations through the integration with other variance reduction methods.\nFor example, the L-SVRG can be replaced with the SAGA or SEGA in the proposed\nnew method and thus other new stochastic proximal quasi-Newton methods with\nrigorously guaranteed convergence can be proposed accordingly. Moreover, we\nmeticulously analyze the resulting nonsmooth subproblem at each iteration and\nutilize a compact representation of the L-BFGS matrix with the storage of some\nauxiliary matrices. As a result, we propose a very efficient and easily\nimplementable semismooth Newton solver for solving the involved subproblems,\nwhose arithmetic operation per iteration is merely order of $O(d)$, where d\ndenotes the dimensionality of the problem. With this efficient inner solver,\nthe new method performs well and its numerical efficiency is validated through\nextensive experiments on a regularized logistic regression problem.",

Multi-robot systems offer scalability and\nefficiency, especially in terms of the number of robots deployed in more\ncomplex environments.

We aim to maximize the number of\ndiscovered stationary targets in an unknown 3D environment while operating\nunder resource constraints (such as path length). Here, each robot aims to\nmaximize discovered targets, avoid unknown static obstacles, and prevent\ninter-robot collisions while operating under communication and resource\nconstraints.

FRB emission characteristics favor highly magnetized neutron\nstars, or magnetars, as the sources, as evidenced by FRB-like bursts from a\ngalactic magnetar, and the star-forming nature of FRB host galaxies. However,\nthe processes that produce FRB sources remain unknown. Although galactic\nmagnetars are often linked to core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), it's uncertain\nwhat determines which supernovae result in magnetars. The galactic environments\nof FRB sources can be harnessed to probe their progenitors. Here, we present\nthe stellar population properties of 30 FRB host galaxies discovered by the\nDeep Synoptic Array. Our analysis shows a significant deficit of low-mass FRB\nhosts compared to the occurrence of star-formation in the universe, implying\nthat FRBs are a biased tracer of star-formation, preferentially selecting\nmassive star-forming galaxies. This bias may be driven by galaxy metallicity,\nwhich is positively correlated with stellar mass. Metal-rich environments may\nfavor the formation of magnetar progenitors through stellar mergers, as higher\nmetallicity stars are less compact and more likely to fill their Roche lobes,\nleading to unstable mass transfer. Although massive stars do not have\nconvective interiors to generate strong magnetic fields by dynamo, merger\nremnants are thought to have the requisite internal magnetic-field strengths to\nresult in magnetars. The preferential occurrence of FRBs in massive\nstar-forming galaxies suggests that CCSN of merger remnants preferentially\nforms magnetars.",

To assess the efficacy\nof the approach, the resulting network is compared against the B-CNN, a\nconvolutional neural network tailored for hierarchical classification tasks, on\nthe CIFAR10, CIFAR100 (where it has been originally and recently proposed\nbefore being adopted and tuned for multiple real-world applications) and\nFashion-MNIST benchmarks. Evidence states that an LH-DNN can achieve comparable\nif not superior performance, especially in the learning of the hierarchical\nrelations, in the face of a drastic reduction of the learning parameters,\ntraining epochs, and computational time, without the need for ad-hoc loss\nfunctions weighting values.",

    "abstract": "An ordinary differential model is proposed to understand the role of egg\nquiescence on the efficacy of releasing Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes to\ncontrol arbovirus transmission. The model admits up to five equilibrium points\nand four biologically meaningful scenarios: extinction of both populations;\npersistence of the uninfected population with extinction of the infected one;\npersistence of the infected population with extinction of the uninfected one;\nand coexistence of both populations. This occurs because the coexistence\nscenario allows for bistability in the system. A sensitivity analysis shows\nthat mosquitoes optimize their fitness by adjusting the quiescence rate.\nBecause Wolbachia-infected eggs do not survive quiescence, or the adults that\nemerge are infertile, quiescence negatively impacts the fitness of infected\nmosquitoes, thereby reducing the prevalence of infection in the mosquito\npopulation. This increases the chance of encountering an uninfected mosquito,\nwhich is more likely to carry the dengue virus compared to a Wolbachia-infected\none, potentially increasing the risk of dengue transmission during or after\nenvironmental stress that triggers quiescence. More importantly, quiescence can\ncompromise the establishment of infection within the mosquito population by\nincreasing the number of infected mosquitoes required during the release\nperiod. Therefore, the use of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes to control\narbovirus transmission in regions where quiescence occurs at a high rate can be\njeopardized.",

To exploit event cameras for object/action recognition,\nexisting methods predominantly sample and aggregate events in a second-level\nduration at every fixed temporal interval (or frequency). However, they often\nface difficulties in capturing the spatiotemporal relationships for longer,\ne.g., minute-level, events and generalizing across varying temporal\nfrequencies. To fill the gap, we present a novel framework, dubbed PAST-SSM,\nexhibiting superior capacity in recognizing events with arbitrary duration\n(e.g., 0.1s to 4.5s) and generalizing to varying inference frequencies. Our key\ninsight is to learn the spatiotemporal relationships from the encoded event\nfeatures via the state space model (SSM) -- whose linear complexity makes it\nideal for modeling high temporal resolution events with longer sequences. To\nachieve this goal, we first propose a Path-Adaptive Event Aggregation and Scan\n(PEAS) module to encode events of varying duration into features with fixed\ndimensions by adaptively scanning and selecting aggregated event frames. On top\nof PEAS, we introduce a novel Multi-faceted Selection Guiding (MSG) loss to\nminimize the randomness and redundancy of the encoded features. This subtly\nenhances the model generalization across different inference frequencies.\nLastly, the SSM is employed to better learn the spatiotemporal properties from\nthe encoded features. Moreover, we build a minute-level event-based recognition\ndataset, named ArDVS100, with arbitrary duration for the benefit of the\ncommunity.

This severe challenge requires FFD models to possess strong\ncapabilities in representing complex facial features and extracting subtle\nforgery cues. Although previous FFD models directly employ existing backbones\nto represent and extract facial forgery cues, the critical role of backbones is\noften overlooked, particularly as their knowledge and capabilities are\ninsufficient to address FFD challenges, inevitably limiting generalization.\nTherefore, it is essential to integrate the backbone pre-training\nconfigurations and seek practical solutions by revisiting the complete FFD\nworkflow, from backbone pre-training and fine-tuning to inference of\ndiscriminant results.

    "abstract": "As a variety of automated collision prevention systems gain presence within\npersonal vehicles, rating and differentiating the automated safety performance\nof car models has become increasingly important for consumers, manufacturers,\nand insurers. In 2023, Swiss Re and partners initiated an eight-month long\nvehicle testing campaign conducted on a recognized UNECE type approval\nauthority and Euro NCAP accredited proving ground in Germany. The campaign\nexposed twelve mass-produced vehicle models and one prototype vehicle fitted\nwith collision prevention systems to a selection of safety-critical traffic\nscenarios representative of United States and European Union accident\nlandscape. In this paper, we compare and evaluate the relative safety\nperformance of these thirteen collision prevention systems (hardware and\nsoftware stack) as demonstrated by this testing campaign. We first introduce a\nnew scoring system which represents a test system's predicted impact on overall\nreal-world collision frequency and reduction of collision impact energy,\nweighted based on the real-world relevance of the test scenario. Next, we\nintroduce a novel metric that quantifies the realism of the protocol and\nconfirm that our test protocol is a plausible representation of real-world\ndriving. Finally, we find that the prototype system in its pre-release state\noutperforms the mass-produced (post-consumer-release) vehicles in the majority\nof the tested scenarios on the test track.",

Mini-autonomous\ncars, which provide a good benchmark for use, are employed as a testing\nplatform. This approach simplifies the control system by directly mapping the\ndriver's movements to the control outputs, avoiding the need for complex\nalgorithms.

It begins by introducing key DRL concepts\nand frameworks, such as deep Q-networks and actor-critic algorithms, and\nreviews recent research utilizing DRL for intrusion detection. The study\nevaluates challenges related to model training efficiency, detection of\nminority and unknown class attacks, feature selection, and handling unbalanced\ndatasets. The performance of DRL models is comprehensively analyzed, showing\nthat while DRL holds promise, many recent technologies remain underexplored.\nSome DRL models achieve state-of-the-art results on public datasets,\noccasionally outperforming traditional deep learning methods. The paper\nconcludes with recommendations for enhancing DRL deployment and testing in\nreal-world network scenarios, with a focus on Internet of Things intrusion\ndetection. It discusses recent DRL architectures and suggests future policy\nfunctions for DRL-based intrusion detection. Finally, the paper proposes\nintegrating DRL with generative methods to further improve performance,\naddressing current gaps and supporting more robust and adaptive network\nintrusion detection systems.",

By retrieving drone-view images in geo-tagged satellite image\ndatabase, approximate localization information can be obtained. However, due to\nhigh costs and privacy concerns, it is usually difficult to obtain large\nquantities of drone-view images from a continuous area. Existing drone-view\ndatasets are mostly composed of small-scale aerial photography with a strong\nassumption that there exists a perfect one-to-one aligned reference image for\nany query, leaving a significant gap from the practical localization scenario.\nIn this work, we construct a large-range contiguous area UAV geo-localization\ndataset named GTA-UAV, featuring multiple flight altitudes, attitudes, scenes,\nand targets using modern computer games. Based on this dataset, we introduce a\nmore practical UAV geo-localization task including partial matches of\ncross-view paired data, and expand the image-level retrieval to the actual\nlocalization in terms of distance (meters). For the construction of drone-view\nand satellite-view pairs, we adopt a weight-based contrastive learning\napproach, which allows for effective learning while avoiding additional\npost-processing matching steps.

Current state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) MoCo algorithms often rely on extensive high-quality MR images to\npre-train neural networks, which constrains the solution space and leads to\noutstanding image reconstruction results. However, the need for large-scale\ndatasets significantly increases costs and limits model generalization. In this\nwork, we propose Moner, an unsupervised MoCo method that jointly reconstructs\nartifact-free MR images and estimates accurate motion from undersampled, rigid\nmotion-corrupted k-space data, without requiring any training data. Our core\nidea is to leverage the continuous prior of implicit neural representation\n(INR) to constrain this ill-posed inverse problem, facilitating optimal\nsolutions. Specifically, we integrate a quasi-static motion model into the INR,\ngranting its ability to correct subject's motion. To stabilize model\noptimization, we reformulate radial MRI reconstruction as a back-projection\nproblem using the Fourier-slice theorem. Additionally, we propose a novel\ncoarse-to-fine hash encoding strategy, significantly enhancing MoCo accuracy.\nExperiments on multiple MRI datasets show our Moner achieves performance\ncomparable to SOTA MoCo techniques on in-domain data, while demonstrating\nsignificant improvements on out-of-domain data.

We study the predicted number density and stellar mass function of\nmassive-quenched galaxies, their formation and quenching timescales and\nstar-formation properties of their progenitors. Predictions are disparate in\nall these diagnostics, for instance: (i) some simulations reproduce the\nobserved number density of very massive-quenched galaxies ($>10^{11}\\rm\nM_{\\odot}$) but underpredict the high density of intermediate-mass ones, while\nothers fit well the lower masses but underpredict the higher ones; (ii) In most\nsimulations, except for GAEA and EAGLE, most massive-quenched galaxies had\nstarburst periods, with the most intense ones happening at $4<z<5$; however,\nonly in SHARK and IllustrisTNG we do find a large number of progenitors with\nstar formation rates $>300\\rm M_{\\odot}\\,yr^{-1}$; (iii) quenching timescales\nare in the range $\\approx 20-150$~Myr depending on the simulation; among other\ndifferences. These disparate predictions can be tied to the adopted Active\nGalactic Nuclei (AGN) feedback model. For instance, the explicit black-hole\n(BH) mass dependence to trigger the \"radio mode\" in IllustrisTNG and Simba\nmakes it difficult to produce quenched galaxies with intermediate stellar\nmasses, also leading to higher baryon collapse efficiencies ($\\approx 15-30$%);\nwhile the strong bolometric luminosity dependence of the AGN outflow rate in\nGAEA leads to BHs of modest mass quenching galaxies. Current observations are\nunable to distinguish between these different predictions due to the small\nsample sizes.

The $\\rho$ values are used\nto compute excess molar volumes, $V_{\\text{m}}^{\\text{E}}$, and, together with\n$\\nu$ results, dynamic viscosities ($\\eta$). Deviations from linear dependence\non mole fraction for viscosity, $\\Delta \\eta$, are also provided. Different\nsemi-empirical equations have been employed to correlate viscosity data.\nParticularly, the equations used are: Grunberg-Nissan, Hind, Frenkel,\nKatti-Chaudhri, McAllister and Heric. Calculations show that better results are\nobtained from the Hind equation. The $V_{\\text{m}}^{\\text{E}}$ values are large\nand negative and contrast with the positive excess molar enthalpies,\n$H_{\\text{m}}^{\\text{E}}$, available in the literature, for these systems. This\nindicates that structural effects are dominant. The $\\Delta \\eta$ results are\npositive and correlate well with the difference in volume of the mixture\ncompounds confirming the importance of structural effects. The temperature\ndependences of $\\eta$ and of the molar volume have been used to calculate\nenthalpies, entropies and Gibbs energies, $\\Delta G^*$, of viscous flow. It is\ndemonstrated that $\\Delta G^*$ is essentially determined by enthalpic effects.\nMethanol + CH$_3$-O-(CH$_2$CH$_2$O)$_n$-CH$_3$ mixtures have been treated in\nthe framework of the ERAS model. Results on $H_{\\text{m}}^{\\text{E}}$ are\nacceptable, while the composition dependence of the $V_{\\text{m}}^{\\text{E}}$\ncurves is poorly represented. This has been ascribed to the existence of strong\ndipolar and structural effects in the present solutions.",

This work introduces an adaptive surface triangulation in the image\ndomain and afterwards performs the normal integration on a triangle mesh. Our\nkey insight is that surface curvature can be computed from normals. Based on\nthe curvature, we identify flat areas and aggregate pixels into triangles. The\napproximation quality is controlled by a single user parameter facilitating a\nseamless generation of low- to high-resolution meshes. Compared to pixel grids,\nour triangle meshes adapt locally to surface details and allow for a sparser\nrepresentation. Our new mesh-based formulation of the normal integration\nproblem is strictly derived from discrete differential geometry and leads to\nwell-conditioned linear systems. Results on real and synthetic data show that\n10 to 100 times less vertices are required than pixels. Experiments suggest\nthat this sparsity translates into a sublinear runtime in the number of pixels.\nFor 64 MP normal maps, our meshing-first approach generates and integrates\nmeshes in minutes while pixel-based approaches require hours just for the\nintegration.",

Using\nthis, we then characterize when one SMA Jordan-embeds into another and in that\ncase we describe the form of such Jordan embeddings. As a consequence, we\nobtain a description of Jordan automorphisms of SMAs, generalizing Coelho's\nresult on their algebra automorphisms.

Dipolar interactions are stronger\nin nitrobenzene solutions than in those containing the smaller 1-nitropropane,\nalthough both nitroalkanes have very similar effective dipole moment\n(aromaticity effect). Systems with 1-alkanols are characterized by dipolar\ninteractions between like molecules which sharply increases when the alkanol\nsize increases. Simultaneously, interactions between unlike molecules become\nweaker, as the OH group is then more sterically hindered. Interactions between\nunlike molecules are stronger in systems with nitromethane than in nitrobenzene\nsolutions. The replacement of nitromethane by nitroethane in systems with a\ngiven 1-alkanol leads to strengthen those effects related with the alcohol\nself-association.

For solving the relatively high\ncomputational cost for the existing approaches, works based on anchor have been\npresented recently. Even with acceptable clustering performance, these methods\ntend to map the original representation from multiple views into a fixed shared\ngraph based on the original dataset. However, most studies ignore the\ndiscriminative property of the learned anchors, which ruin the representation\ncapability of the built model. Moreover, the complementary information among\nanchors across views is neglected to be ensured by simply learning the shared\nanchor graph without considering the quality of view-specific anchors. In this\npaper, we propose discriminative anchor learning for multi-view clustering\n(DALMC) for handling the above issues.

    "abstract": "Japan faces many challenges related to its aging society, including\nincreasing rates of cognitive decline in the population and a shortage of\ncaregivers. Efforts have begun to explore solutions using artificial\nintelligence (AI), especially socially embodied intelligent agents and robots\nthat can communicate with people. Yet, there has been little research on the\ncompatibility of these agents with older adults in various everyday situations.\nTo this end, we conducted a user study to evaluate a robot that functions as a\nfacilitator for a group conversation protocol designed to prevent cognitive\ndecline. We modified the robot to use backchannelling, a natural human way of\nspeaking, to increase receptiveness of the robot and enjoyment of the group\nconversation experience. We conducted a cross-generational study with young\nadults and older adults. Qualitative analyses indicated that younger adults\nperceived the backchannelling version of the robot as kinder, more trustworthy,\nand more acceptable than the non-backchannelling robot. Finally, we found that\nthe robot's backchannelling elicited nonverbal backchanneling in older\nparticipants.",

    "abstract": "Intra-cardiac echocardiography (ICE) is a crucial imaging modality used in\nelectrophysiology (EP) and structural heart disease (SHD) interventions,\nproviding realtime, high-resolution views from within the heart. Despite its\nadvantages, effective manipulation of the ICE catheter requires significant\nexpertise, which can lead to inconsistent outcomes, especially among less\nexperienced operators. To address this challenge, we propose an AIdriven view\nguidance system that operates in a continuous closed-loop with\nhuman-in-the-loop feedback, designed to assist users in navigating ICE imaging\nwithout requiring specialized knowledge. Specifically, our method models the\nrelative position and orientation vectors between arbitrary views and\nclinically defined ICE views in a spatial coordinate system. It guides users on\nhow to manipulate the ICE catheter to transition from the current view to the\ndesired view over time. By operating in a closedloop configuration, the system\ncontinuously predicts and updates the necessary catheter manipulations,\nensuring seamless integration into existing clinical workflows. The\neffectiveness of the proposed system is demonstrated through a simulation-based\nperformance evaluation using real clinical data, achieving an 89% success rate\nwith 6,532 test cases. Additionally, a semi-simulation experiment with\nhuman-in-the-loop testing validated the feasibility of continuous yet discrete\nguidance. These results underscore the potential of the proposed method to\nenhance the accuracy and efficiency of ICE imaging procedures.",

    "abstract": "We present an analysis of the photometric and spectroscopic dataset of the\nType II supernova (SN) 2018ivc in the nearby (10 Mpc) galaxy Messier 77. Thanks\nto the high cadence of the CHASE survey, we observed the SN rising very rapidly\nby nearly three magnitudes in five hours (or 18 mag d$^{-1}$). The $r$-band\nlight curve presents four distinct phases: the maximum light is reached in just\none day, then a first, rapid linear decline precedes a short-duration plateau.\nFinally, a long, slower linear decline lasted for one year. Following a radio\nrebrightening, we detected SN 2018ivc four years after the explosion. The early\nspectra show a blue, nearly featureless continuum, but the spectra evolve\nrapidly: after about 10 days a prominent H$\\alpha$ line starts to emerge, with\na peculiar profile, but the spectra are heavily contaminated by emission lines\nfrom the host galaxy. He I lines, namely $\\lambda\\lambda$5876,7065, are also\nstrong. On top of the former, a strong absorption from the Na I doublet is\nvisible, indicative of a non-negligible internal reddening. From its equivalent\nwidth, we derive a lower limit on the host reddening of $A_V\\simeq1.5$ mag,\nwhile from the Balmer decrement and a match of the $B-V$ colour curve of SN\n2018ivc to that of the comparison objects, a host reddening of $A_V\\simeq3.0$\nmag is obtained. The spectra are similar to those of SNe II, but with strong He\nlines. Given the peculiar light curve and spectral features, we suggest SN\n2018ivc could be a transitional object between the Type IIL and Type IIb SNe\nclasses. In addition, we found signs of interaction with circumstellar medium\nin the light curve, making SN 2018ivc also an interacting event. Finally, we\nmodelled the early multi-band light curves and photospheric velocity of SN\n2018ivc to estimate the explosion and CSM physical parameters.",

Since\nstar clusters spend their lifetime immersed in the gravitational potential of\ntheir host galaxy, they are also subject to the effects of galactic tides. In\nthis work, I show that the $A^+$ index of a star cluster depends on both, its\ninternal dynamics as it were in isolation and on the effects of galactic tides.\nParticularly, I focused on the largest sample of open clusters harboring blue\nstraggler stars with robust cluster membership. I found that these open\nclusters exhibit an overall dispersion of the $A^+$ index in diagnostic\ndiagrams where Milky Way globular clusters show a clear linear trend. However,\nas also experienced by globular clusters, $A^+$ values of open clusters show\nsome dependence on their galactocentric distances, in the sense that clusters\nlocated closer or farther that $\\sim$ 11 kpc from the Galactic center have\nlarger and smaller $A^+$ values, respectively. This different response to\ntwo-body relaxation and galactic tides in globular and open clusters, which\nhappen concurrently, can be due to their different masses.

    "abstract": "Hawrami, a dialect of Kurdish, is classified as an endangered language as it\nsuffers from the scarcity of data and the gradual loss of its speakers. Natural\nLanguage Processing projects can be used to partially compensate for data\navailability for endangered languages/dialects through a variety of approaches,\nsuch as machine translation, language model building, and corpora development.\nSimilarly, NLP projects such as text classification are in language\ndocumentation. Several text classification studies have been conducted for\nKurdish, but they were mainly dedicated to two particular dialects: Sorani\n(Central Kurdish) and Kurmanji (Northern Kurdish). In this paper, we introduce\nvarious text classification models using a dataset of 6,854 articles in Hawrami\nlabeled into 15 categories by two native speakers. We use K-nearest Neighbor\n(KNN), Linear Support Vector Machine (Linear SVM), Logistic Regression (LR),\nand Decision Tree (DT) to evaluate how well those methods perform the\nclassification task. The results indicate that the Linear SVM achieves a 96% of\naccuracy and outperforms the other approaches.",

The aim is to optimize the sequence in which all the given debris\nshould be visited to get the least total time for rendezvous for the entire\nmission. A neural network (NN) policy is developed, trained on simulated space\nmissions with varying debris fields. After training, the neural network\ncalculates approximately optimal paths using Izzo's adaptation of Lambert\nmaneuvers. Performance is evaluated against standard heuristics in mission\nplanning. The reinforcement learning approach demonstrates a significant\nimprovement in planning efficiency by optimizing the sequence for debris\nrendezvous, reducing the total mission time by an average of approximately\n{10.96\\%} and {13.66\\%} compared to the Genetic and Greedy algorithms,\nrespectively.

An exact solution can be obtained since\nthe complete system has few sites. That solution is employed to calculate the\natomic Green's functions and the approximate cumulants used to obtain the\nimpurity and conduction Green's functions for the SIAM, and no self-consistency\nloop is required.\n  We calculated the density of states, the Friedel sum rule, and the impurity\noccupation number, all benchmarked against results from the numerical\nrenormalization group (NRG). One of the main insights obtained is that, at very\nlow temperatures, only four atomic transitions contribute to generating the\nentire SIAM density of states, regardless of the number of sites in the chain\nand the model's parameters and different regimes: Empty orbital, mixed-valence,\nand Kondo.

In this paper, we introduce GRACE, a novel approach\naddressing this while generating socially appropriate robot actions.

The bidirectional\nstructure of GRACE enables robots to refine and enhance LLM predictions by\nutilizing human explanations and makes robots capable of generating such\nexplanations for human-specified actions.

However, current modeling approaches remain\nlabor-intensive and prone to human errors due to their dependence on manual\nworkflows. These processes typically involve extensive literature reviews,\nformula tuning, and iterative testing, which often lead to inefficiencies. To\naddress this, we propose TR-Agent, an AI-powered framework that autonomously\ndevelops and refines traffic models through a closed-loop, iterative process.\nWe structure the research pipeline into four key stages: idea generation,\ntheory formulation, theory evaluation, and iterative optimization, and\nimplement TR-Agent with four corresponding modules. These modules collaborate\nto retrieve knowledge from external sources, generate novel hypotheses,\nimplement and debug models, and evaluate their performance on evaluation\ndatasets. Through iteratively feedback and refinement, TR-Agent improves both\nmodeling efficiency and effectiveness. We validate the framework on three\nrepresentative traffic models: the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) for\ncar-following behavior, the MOBIL model for lane-changing, and the\nLighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) speed-density relationship for macroscopic\ntraffic flow modeling. Experimental results show substantial performance gains\nover the original models. To assess the robustness and generalizability of the\nimprovements, we conduct additional evaluations across multiple real-world\ndatasets, demonstrating consistent performance gains beyond the original\ndevelopment data.

    "abstract": "Heuristics are commonly used to tackle various search and optimization\nproblems. Design heuristics usually require tedious manual crafting with domain\nknowledge. Recent works have incorporated Large Language Models (LLMs) into\nautomatic heuristic search, leveraging their powerful language and coding\ncapacity. However, existing research focuses on the optimal performance on the\ntarget problem as the sole objective, neglecting other criteria such as\nefficiency and scalability, which are vital in practice. To tackle this\nchallenge, we propose to model the heuristic search as a multi-objective\noptimization problem and consider introducing additional practical criteria\nbeyond optimal performance. Due to the complexity of the search space,\nconventional multi-objective optimization methods struggle to effectively\nhandle LLM-based multi-objective heuristic search. We propose the first\nLLM-based multi-objective heuristic search framework, Multi-objective Evolution\nof Heuristic (MEoH), which integrates LLMs in a zero-shot manner to generate a\nnon-dominated set of heuristics to meet multiple design criteria. We design a\nnew dominance-dissimilarity mechanism for effective population management and\nselection, which incorporates both code dissimilarity in the search space and\ndominance in the objective space. MEoH is demonstrated in two well-known\ncombinatorial optimization problems: the online Bin Packing Problem (BPP) and\nthe Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The results indicate that a variety of\nelite heuristics are automatically generated in a single run, offering more\ntrade-off options than the existing methods. It successfully achieves\ncompetitive or superior performance while improving efficiency up to 10 times.\nMoreover, we also observe that the multi-objective search introduces novel\ninsights into heuristic design and leads to the discovery of diverse\nheuristics.",

For each atom site, the brightness or some comparable metric is\nestimated and used to predict the presence or absence of an atom. Across\ndifferent setups, we can see a vast number of different approaches used to\nanalyze these images. Often, the choice of detection algorithm is either not\nmentioned at all or it is not justified. We investigate several different\nalgorithms and compare their performance in terms of both precision and\nexecution run time. To do so, we rely on a set of synthetic images across\ndifferent simulated exposure times with known occupancy states. Since the use\nof simulation provides us with the ground truth of atom site occupancy, we can\neasily state precise error rates and variances of the reconstructed property.\nTo also rule out the possibility of better algorithms existing, we calculated\nthe Cram\\'er-Rao bound in order to establish an upper limit that even a perfect\nestimator cannot outperform. As the metric of choice, we used the number of\nphotonelectrons that can be contributed to a specific atom site. Since the\nbound depends on the occupancy of neighboring sites, we provide the best and\nworst cases, as well as a half filled one. Our comparison shows that of our\ntested algorithms, a global non-linear least-squares solver that uses the\noptical system's PSF to return a each sites' number of photoelectrons performed\nthe best, on average crossing the worst-case bound for longer exposure times.\nIts main drawback is its huge computational complexity and, thus, required\ncalculation time. We manage to somewhat reduce this problem, suggesting that\nits use may be viable. However, our study also shows that for cases where\nutmost speed is required, simple algorithms may be preferable.",

    "abstract": "Synthesizing accurate hands-object interactions (HOI) is critical for\napplications in Computer Vision, Augmented Reality (AR), and Mixed Reality\n(MR). Despite recent advances, the accuracy of reconstructed or generated HOI\nleaves room for refinement. Some techniques have improved the accuracy of dense\ncorrespondences by shifting focus from generating explicit contacts to using\nrich HOI fields. Still, they lack full differentiability or continuity and are\ntailored to specific tasks. In contrast, we present a Coarse Hand-Object\nInteraction Representation (CHOIR), a novel, versatile and fully differentiable\nfield for HOI modelling. CHOIR leverages discrete unsigned distances for\ncontinuous shape and pose encoding, alongside multivariate Gaussian\ndistributions to represent dense contact maps with few parameters. To\ndemonstrate the versatility of CHOIR we design JointDiffusion, a diffusion\nmodel to learn a grasp distribution conditioned on noisy hand-object\ninteractions or only object geometries, for both refinement and synthesis\napplications. We demonstrate JointDiffusion's improvements over the SOTA in\nboth applications: it increases the contact F1 score by $5\\%$ for refinement\nand decreases the sim. displacement by $46\\%$ for synthesis. Our experiments\nshow that JointDiffusion with CHOIR yield superior contact accuracy and\nphysical realism compared to SOTA methods designed for specific tasks.

    "abstract": "Survey researchers face the problem of sensitivity bias: since people are\nreluctant to reveal socially undesirable or otherwise risky traits, aggregate\nestimates of these traits will be biased. List experiments offer a solution by\nconferring respondents greater privacy. However, little is know about how list\nexperiments fare when sensitivity bias varies across respondent subgroups. For\nexample, a trait that is socially undesirable to one group may socially\ndesirable in a second group, leading sensitivity bias to be negative in the\nfirst group, while it is positive in the second. Or a trait may be not\nsensitive in one group, leading sensitivity bias to be zero in one group and\nnon-zero in another. We use Monte Carlo simulations to explore what happens\nwhen the polarity (sign) of sensitivity bias is non-uniform. We find that a\ngeneral diagnostic test yields false positives and that commonly used\nestimators return biased estimates of the prevalence of the sensitive trait,\ncoefficients of covariates, and sensitivity bias itself. The bias is worse when\npolarity runs in opposite directions across subgroups, and as the difference in\nsubgroup sizes increases. Significantly, non-uniform polarity could explain why\nsome list experiments appear to 'fail'. By defining and systematically\ninvestigating the problem of non-uniform polarity, we hope to save some studies\nfrom the file-drawer and provide some guidance for future research.",

Third, we improve feature extraction from target\nand shadow regions by implementing a positional supervision task using mask\nground truth encoding. The improvement enhances the ability of the model to\ndiscriminate between classes. Our proposed IRASNet presents new\nstate-of-the-art public SAR datasets utilizing target and shadow information to\nachieve superior performance across various test conditions.

However, these methods typically model text instances\nin a bottom-up manner, which is highly susceptible to noise. In addition, the\nprediction of pixels is isolated without introducing pixel-feature interaction,\nwhich also influences the detection performance. To alleviate these problems,\nwe propose a multi-information level arbitrary-shaped text detector consisting\nof a focus entirety module (FEM) and a perceive environment module (PEM). The\nformer extracts instance-level features and adopts a top-down scheme to model\ntexts to reduce the influence of noises. Specifically, it assigns consistent\nentirety information to pixels within the same instance to improve their\ncohesion. In addition, it emphasizes the scale information, enabling the model\nto distinguish varying scale texts effectively. The latter extracts\nregion-level information and encourages the model to focus on the distribution\nof positive samples in the vicinity of a pixel, which perceives environment\ninformation. It treats the kernel pixels as positive samples and helps the\nmodel differentiate text and kernel features.

FTD and AD display unique traits in their onset, progression, and\ntreatment responses. In particular, FTD often faces a prolonged diagnostic\nprocess and is commonly misdiagnosed with AD due to overlapping symptoms. This\nstudy utilizes a complex network model of brain electrical activity using\nresting-state EEG recordings to address the misdiagnosis. It compares the\nnetwork organization between AD and FTD, highlighting connectivity differences\nand examining the significance of EEG signals across frequency bands in\ndistinguishing AD and FTD. The publicly available EEG dataset of 36 AD and 23\nFTD patients is utilized for analyses. Cross-plot transition entropy (CPTE) is\nemployed to measure synchronization between EEG signals and construct\nconnection matrices. CPTE offers advantages in parameter setting, computational\nefficiency, and robustness. The analysis reveals significantly different\nclustering coefficients (CC), subgraph centrality (SC), and eigenvector\ncentrality (EC) between the two groups. FTD shows higher connectivity,\nparticularly in delta, theta, and gamma bands, owing to lower\nneurodegeneration. The CPTE-based network parameters effectively classify the\ntwo groups with an accuracy of 87.58\\%, with the gamma band demonstrating the\nhighest accuracy of 92.87%.

    "abstract": "This article presents an extended algorithm for computing the lower spectral\nradius of finite, non-negative matrix sets. Given a set of matrices\n$\\mathcal{F} = \\{A_1, \\ldots, A_m\\}$, the lower spectral radius represents the\nminimal growth rate of sequences in the product semigroup generated by\n$\\mathcal{F}$. This quantity is crucial for characterizing optimal stable\ntrajectories in discrete dynamical systems of the form $x_{k+1} = A_{i_k} x_k$,\nwhere $A_{i_k} \\in \\mathcal{F}$ for all $k \\ge 0$. For the well-known joint\nspectral radius (which represents the highest growth rate), a famous algorithm\nproviding suitable lower and upper bounds and able to approximate the joint\nspectral radius with arbitrary accuracy was proposed by Gripenberg in 1996. For\nthe lower spectral radius, where a lower bound is not directly available\n(contrarily to the joint spectral radius), this computation appears more\nchallenging.\n  Our work extends Gripenberg's approach to the lower spectral radius\ncomputation for non-negative matrix families. The proposed algorithm employs a\ntime-varying antinorm and demonstrates rapid convergence. Its success is\nrelated to the property that the lower spectral radius can be obtained as a\nGelfand limit, which was recently proved in Guglielmi and Zennaro (2020).\nAdditionally, we propose an improvement to the classical Gripenberg algorithm\nfor approximating the joint spectral radius of arbitrary matrix sets.",

Based on this equation,\nthe theory consistently captures the contribution of transient heterogeneous\ntemperature fields on the evolution of the (polar) dislocation density. The\ngoverning equations of the model are obtained from the conservation of Burgers\nvector, mass, linear and angular momenta, and the First Law.

An\nevolution equation for temperature is obtained from the First Law and the\nHelmholtz free energy density, which is taken as a function of the following\nmeasurable quantities: elastic distortion, temperature and the dislocation\ndensity (the theory allows prescribing additional measurable quantities as\ninternal state variables if needed).

In\nresponse to the complex, heterogeneous, and dynamic serving scenarios and\nstringent performance expectations for 6G SAGINs, it is crucial to undertake\nmodeling, assurance, and analysis of the key technologies, aligned with the\ndiverse demands for QoS provisioning in the non-asymptotic regime, i.e., when\nimplementing finite blocklength coding (FBC) as a new dimension for error-rate\nbounded QoS metric. However, how to design new statistical QoS-driven\nperformance modeling approaches that accurately delineate the complex and\ndynamic behaviors of networks, particularly in terms of constraining both delay\nand error rate, persists as a significant challenge for implementing mURLLC\nwithin 6G SAGINs in the finite blocklength regime. To overcome these\ndifficulties, in this paper we propose to develop a set of analytical modeling\nframeworks for 6G SAGIN in supporting statistical delay and error-rate bounded\nQoS in the finite blocklength regime. First we establish the SAGIN system\narchitecture model. Second, the aggregate interference and decoding error\nprobability functions are modeled and examined through using Laplace transform.\nThird, we introduce modeling techniques aimed at defining\nthe$\\epsilon$-effective capacity function as a crucial metric for facilitating\nstatistical QoS standards with respect to delay and error-rate. To validate the\neffectiveness of the developed performance modeling schemes, we have executed a\nseries of simulations over SAGINs.",

This paper proposes a\nthree-stage modular system to enhance single-channel neural speaker diarization\nsystems and recognition performance by utilizing spatial cues from\nmulti-channel speech to provide more accurate initialization for each stage of\nneural speaker diarization (NSD) decoding: (1) Overlap detection and continuous\nspeech separation (CSS) on multi-channel speech are used to obtain cleaner\nsingle speaker speech segments for clustering, followed by the first NSD\ndecoding pass.

In these\nsystems, the dynamics arise from the collective effects of mutual interactions\nbetween individual elements, as well as their interactions with obstacles or\nboundaries. In this study, we turn our focus to an artificial system and\nexperimentally investigate the emergence of directional revolution in dimer and\ntrimer structures composed of colloidal particles in ring-shaped optical\nillumination. In this case, the movement of these colloidal structures is\nexclusively facilitated by optothermal interactions without any direct\nmechanical force applied from the external optical field. Depending on the\noptical absorption properties of the colloidal particles, these optothermal\ninteractions can exhibit both attractive and repulsive characteristics. The\nattractive interactions provide the necessary driving force that propels the\nmotion, while the repulsive interactions serve to control the structural\nparameters of the system. The arrangement and interaction of the colloidal\nparticles within these dimer and trimer structures fuel the controlled,\ndirectional revolution, with the optical gradient force acting as a confining\nfactor, guiding the movement along a specific path. Notably, the dynamics of\nthese systems can be tuned by altering the intensity of the optical field.

The calculation of cross sections, the optical theorem and\nBoltzmann $H$-theorem from unitarity of the $S$ matrix are also explained.\nSpecial emphasis is given to expansions in partial-wave amplitudes of two-body\nscattering amplitudes, both for massive and massless particles, and to\nunitarity in partial-wave amplitudes. In this way, partial-wave expansions in\nterms of $\\ell SJ$ states, and using helicity states with definite total\nangular momentum $J$ are discussed. Crossing symmetry is also explained, and\nconnected to crossed channels, analyticity and crossed-channel cuts in\npartial-wave amplitudes. Different non-perturbative techniques and general\nparameterizations are developed for partial-wave amplitudes that satisfy\nunitarity and are consistent with the analyticity properties that they must\nhave. Then, the $N/D$ method and additional solutions generated by adding CDD\npoles are covered in detail.

The goal was\nto reveal the structure of the hidden percolative patterns (order parameters)\nin the active phase and the nature of transitions those patterns emerge\nthrough. Our results corroborate the earlier conjecture that in general the\nactive (percolating) phases possess the hierarchical structure (tower of\npercolation patterns), where more complicated patterns emerge on the top of\ncoexistent patterns of lesser complexity. Plethora of different patterns emerge\nvia cascades of continuous transitions. We detect five phases with distinct\npatterns of percolation within the active phase of the model. All transitions\non the phase diagram belong to the directed percolation universality class, as\nconfirmed by the scaling analysis.

However, learning directly from high-dimensional visual input is often\ndata-inefficient and intricate. To address this issue, traditional methods\nattempt to learn a teacher policy with access to privileged information first\nand then learn a student policy to imitate the teacher's behavior with visual\ninput. Despite some progress, this imitation framework prevents the student\npolicy from achieving optimal performance due to the information gap between\ninputs. Furthermore, the learning process is unnatural since animals\nintuitively learn to traverse different terrains based on their understanding\nof the world without privileged knowledge. Inspired by this natural ability, we\npropose a simple yet effective method, World Model-based Perception (WMP),\nwhich builds a world model of the environment and learns a policy based on the\nworld model. We illustrate that though completely trained in simulation, the\nworld model can make accurate predictions of real-world trajectories, thus\nproviding informative signals for the policy controller.

    "abstract": "One in about a few hundred thousand sub-Coulomb $d$-$t$ collisions is\naccompanied by the emission of a $\\gamma$-photon. The $\\gamma$-spectrum from\nthese collisions is dominated by a 16.7 MeV peak, corresponding to the\npopulation of the $p$-wave $3/2^-$ $\\alpha$-$n$ ground-state resonance in the\nE1 transition from an intermediate $d$-wave $\\alpha$-$n$ state, corresponding\nto the $^5$He excited state around 16.7 MeV. The strength of this spectrum at\nthe large $\\gamma$-energy endpoint decreases fast both due to kinematic factors\nand due to centrifugal repulsion between neutron and $\\alpha$-particle at\nnear-zero relative energies. However, no centrifugal repulsion would occur if\n$s$-wave $\\alpha$-$n$ states were populated in magnetic dipole transition.\nTherefore, one can expect that close to the $\\gamma$-spectrum endpoint around\n17.5 MeV the M1 transition could dominate, leading to additional counts in\nexperimental spectra which could be easily misinterpreted as a background. This\nwork presents calculations of the M1 contribution to the $d+t\\rightarrow\n\\alpha+n+\\gamma$ cross section caused both by convection and magnetization\ncurrents. While the first contribution was found to be negligible, the one from\nmagnetization depends strongly on the choice of the model for the $d$-$t$\nchannel scattering wave function. Using $d$-$t$ interaction models from the\nliterature, represented either by a gaussian of by a square well, resulted in\nunrealistically strong M1 contribution. With constructed in the present work\noptical folding potential, correctly representing the sizes of deuteron and\ntriton, the M1 contribution near the endpoint is reduced to about 2$\\%$ of the\n16.7-MeV E1 peak. Arguments in favor of more detailed calculations, that could\npotentially change this number, are put forward.",

To achieve this, MixPolyp introduces three novel\nsupervision losses to handle various annotations: Subspace Projection loss\n(L_SP), Binary Minimum Entropy loss (L_BME), and Linear Regularization loss\n(L_LR). For box annotations, L_SP eliminates shape inconsistencies between the\nprediction and the supervision.

Furthermore, L_LR provides dense supervision\nby enforcing consistency among the predictions, thus reducing the\nnon-uniqueness. These losses are independent of the model structure, making\nthem generally applicable. They are used only during training, adding no\ncomputational cost during inference.

    "abstract": "RAN Intelligent Controllers (RICs) are programmable platforms that enable\ndata-driven closed-loop control in the O-RAN architecture. They collect\ntelemetry and data from the RAN, process it in custom applications, and enforce\ncontrol or new configurations on the RAN. Such custom applications in the\nNear-Real-Time (RT) RIC are called xApps, and enable a variety of use cases\nrelated to radio resource management. Despite numerous open-source and\ncommercial projects focused on the Near-RT RIC, developing and testing xApps\nthat are interoperable across multiple RAN implementations is a time-consuming\nand technically challenging process. This is primarily caused by the complexity\nof the protocol of the E2 interface, which enables communication between the\nRIC and the RAN while providing a high degree of flexibility, with multiple\nService Models (SMs) providing plug-and-play functionalities such as data\nreporting and RAN control. In this paper, we propose xDevSM, an open-source\nflexible framework for O-RAN service models, aimed at simplifying xApp\ndevelopment for the O-RAN Software Community (OSC) Near-RT RIC. xDevSM reduces\nthe complexity of the xApp development process, allowing developers to focus on\nthe control logic of their xApps and moving the logic of the E2 service models\nbehind simple Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of this framework by deploying and testing xApps across various\nRAN software platforms, including OpenAirInterface and srsRAN. This framework\nsignificantly facilitates the development and validation of solutions and\nalgorithms on O-RAN networks, including the testing of data-driven solutions\nacross multiple RAN implementations.",

However, quantum\nphenomena are typically observed only at cryogenic temperatures, which limits\ntheir practical applications. Two-dimensional materials and their van der Waals\n(vdW) heterostructures provide a promising platform for high-temperature\nquantum devices owing to their strong Coulomb interactions and/or spin-orbit\ncoupling. In this review, we summarise recent research on emergent quantum\nphenomena in vdW heterostructures based on interlayer tunnelling and the\ncoupling of charged particles and spins, including negative differential\nresistance, Josephson tunnelling, exciton condensation, and topological\nsuperconductivity. These are the underlying mechanisms of energy-efficient\ndevices, including tunnel field-effect transistors, topological/superconducting\ntransistors, and quantum computers. The natural homojunction within vdW layered\nmaterials offers clean interfaces and perfectly aligned structures for enhanced\ninterlayer coupling. Twisted bilayers with small angles may also give rise to\nnovel quantum effects. In addition, we highlight several proposed structures\nfor achieving high-temperature Majorana zero modes, which are critical elements\nof topological quantum computing.

    "abstract": "Translating Natural Language Queries into Structured Query Language\n(Text-to-SQL or NLQ-to-SQL) is a critical task extensively studied by both the\nnatural language processing and database communities, aimed at providing a\nnatural language interface to databases (NLIDB) and lowering the barrier for\nnon-experts. Despite recent advancements made through the use of Large Language\nModels (LLMs), significant challenges remain. These include handling complex\ndatabase schemas, resolving ambiguity in user queries, and generating SQL\nqueries with intricate structures that accurately reflect the user's intent. In\nthis work, we introduce E-SQL, a novel pipeline specifically designed to\naddress these challenges through direct schema linking and candidate predicate\naugmentation. E-SQL enhances the natural language query by incorporating\nrelevant database items (i.e., tables, columns, and values) and conditions\ndirectly into the question and SQL construction plan, bridging the gap between\nthe query and the database structure. The pipeline leverages candidate\npredicate augmentation to mitigate erroneous or incomplete predicates in\ngenerated SQLs. Comprehensive evaluations on the BIRD benchmark illustrate that\nE-SQL achieves competitive performance, particularly excelling in complex\nqueries with a 66.29% execution accuracy on the test set. A further observation\nfrom our experiments reveals that incorporating schema filtering into the\ntranslation pipeline does not have a positive impact on performance when the\nmost advanced proprietary LLMs are used. Additionally, our experiments with\nsmall LLMs highlight the importance and positive impact of enriched questions\non their performance.

We\ndemonstrate such a protocol in an architecture consisting of fixed-frequency\ntransmon qubits pair-wise coupled via tunable couplers -- an architecture that\nis compatible with the surface code. We use tunable couplers to transfer any\nundesired qubit excitation to the readout resonator of the qubit, from which\nthis excitation decays into the feedline. In total, the combination of qubit\nreset, leakage reduction, and coupler reset takes only 83ns to complete. Our\nreset scheme is fast, unconditional, and achieves fidelities well above 99%,\nthus enabling fixed-frequency qubit architectures as future implementations of\nfault-tolerant quantum computers.

The proposed method uses local measurements to estimate the current\ncaused by the other terminals affected by the contingency.

The\nalgorithm takes consecutive voltage and current samples, including the\nestimated current of the other terminal, into the analysis.

The emission happening in the vicinity of the shock front will be more\npolarized due to the ordered magnetic field resulting from shock compression.\nThe X-ray emission, involving high-energy electrons, originates closer to the\nshock front than the optical emission. The difference in the spatial extension\ncould plausibly account for the observed variation in polarization between\nX-ray and optical wavelengths.

    "abstract": "Test smells arise from poor design practices and insufficient domain\nknowledge, which can lower the quality of test code and make it harder to\nmaintain and update. Manually refactoring test smells is time-consuming and\nerror-prone, highlighting the necessity for automated approaches. Current\nrule-based refactoring methods often struggle in scenarios not covered by\npredefined rules and lack the flexibility needed to handle diverse cases\neffectively. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called UTRefactor, a\ncontext-enhanced, LLM-based framework for automatic test refactoring in Java\nprojects. UTRefactor extracts relevant context from test code and leverages an\nexternal knowledge base that includes test smell definitions, descriptions, and\nDSL-based refactoring rules. By simulating the manual refactoring process\nthrough a chain-of-thought approach, UTRefactor guides the LLM to eliminate\ntest smells in a step-by-step process, ensuring both accuracy and consistency\nthroughout the refactoring. Additionally, we implement a checkpoint mechanism\nto facilitate comprehensive refactoring, particularly when multiple smells are\npresent. We evaluate UTRefactor on 879 tests from six open-source Java\nprojects, reducing the number of test smells from 2,375 to 265, achieving an\n89% reduction. UTRefactor outperforms direct LLM-based refactoring methods by\n61.82% in smell elimination and significantly surpasses the performance of a\nrule-based test smell refactoring tool. Our results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of UTRefactor in enhancing test code quality while minimizing\nmanual involvement.",

    "abstract": "Structural transformation, the shift from agrarian economies to more\ndiversified industrial and service-based systems, is a key driver of economic\ndevelopment. However, in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), data\nscarcity and unreliability hinder accurate assessments of this process. This\npaper presents a novel statistical framework designed to address these\nchallenges by integrating Bayesian hierarchical modeling, machine\nlearning-based data imputation, and factor analysis. The framework is\nspecifically tailored for conditions of data sparsity and is capable of\nproviding robust insights into sectoral productivity and employment shifts\nacross diverse economies. By utilizing Bayesian models, uncertainties in data\nare effectively managed, while machine learning techniques impute missing data\npoints, ensuring the integrity of the analysis. Factor analysis reduces the\ndimensionality of complex datasets, distilling them into core economic\nstructures. The proposed framework has been validated through extensive\nsimulations, demonstrating its ability to predict structural changes even when\nup to 60\\% of data is missing. This approach offers policymakers and\nresearchers a valuable tool for making informed decisions in environments where\ndata quality is limited, contributing to the broader understanding of economic\ndevelopment in LMICs.",

Traditional frameworks, often reliant on solid, yet\noutdated APIs like OpenGL, limit the exploration of cutting-edge graphics\ntechniques. To address this, we introduce pyGANDALF, a unique, lightweight,\nopen-source CG framework built on three pillars: Entity-Component-System (ECS)\narchitecture, Python programming, and WebGPU integration. This combination sets\npyGANDALF apart by providing a streamlined ECS design with an editor layer,\ncompatibility with WebGPU for state-of-the-art features like compute and ray\ntracing pipelines, and a programmer-friendly Python environment. The framework\nsupports modern features, such as Physically Based Rendering (PBR) capabilities\nand integration with Universal Scene Description (USD) formats, making it\nsuitable for both educational demonstrations and real-world applications.\nEvaluations by expert users confirmed that pyGANDALF effectively balances ease\nof use with advanced functionality, preparing students for contemporary CG\ndevelopment challenges.",

    "abstract": "Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have sparked great\nresearch interests owing to their exceptional content-reasoning and\ninstruction-following capabilities. To effectively instruct an MLLM, in\naddition to conventional language expressions, the practice of referring to\nobjects by painting with brushes on images has emerged as a prevalent tool\n(referred to as \"referring visual prompts\") due to its efficacy in aligning the\nuser's intention with specific image regions. To accommodate the most common\nreferring visual prompts, namely points, boxes, and masks, existing approaches\ninitially utilize specialized feature encoding modules to capture the semantics\nof the highlighted areas indicated by these prompts. Subsequently, these\nencoded region features are adapted to MLLMs through fine-tuning on a\nmeticulously curated multimodal instruction dataset. However, such designs\nsuffer from redundancy in architecture. Moreover, they face challenges in\neffectively generalizing when encountering a diverse range of arbitrary\nreferring visual prompts in real-life scenarios. To address the above issues,\nwe propose EAGLE, a novel MLLM that empowers comprehension of arbitrary\nreferring visual prompts with less training efforts than existing approaches.\nSpecifically, our EAGLE maintains the innate format of the referring visual\nprompts as colored patches rendered on the given image for conducting the\ninstruction tuning. Our approach embeds referring visual prompts as spatial\nconcepts conveying specific spatial areas comprehensible to the MLLM, with the\nsemantic comprehension of these regions originating from the MLLM itself.\nBesides, we also propose a Geometry-Agnostic Learning paradigm (GAL) to further\ndisentangle the MLLM's region-level comprehension with the specific formats of\nreferring visual prompts. Extensive experiments are conducted to prove the\neffectiveness of our proposed method.",

Specifically, we demonstrate that by incorporating a label\nchannel into the standard RC, a single machine is able to learn from data the\ndynamics of multiple chaotic attractors, while each attractor can be accurately\nretrieved by inputting just a scalar in the prediction phase. The dependence of\nthe machine performance on the labeling and separation parameters is\ninvestigated, and it is found that the machine performance is optimized when\nthe parameters take intermediate values. The working mechanism of\nmulti-functional RC is analyzed by the method of functional networks in\nneuroscience, and it is revealed that each attractor is represented by a\nstable, unique functional network in the reservoir, and the optimal performance\narises as a balance between the stability, complexity, and distinguishability\nof the functional networks.",

Given the critical role that spatial symmetries and invariances\nplay in determining material behaviour, it is essential to incorporate these\naspects into the probabilistic description and modelling of material\nproperties. In particular, we focus on spatial point symmetries or invariances\nunder rotations, a classical subject in elasticity. Following this, we\nformulate a stochastic modelling framework using a Lie algebra representation\nvia a memoryless transformation that respects the requirements of positive\ndefiniteness and invariance. With this, it is shown how to generate a random\nensemble of elasticity tensors that allows an independent control of strength,\neigenstrain, and orientation. The procedure also accommodates the requirement\nto prescribe specific spatial symmetries and invariances for each member of the\nwhole ensemble, while ensuring that the mean or expected value of the ensemble\nconforms to a potentially 'higher' class of spatial invariance. Furthermore, it\nis important to highlight that the set of SPD tensors forms a differentiable\nmanifold, which geometrically corresponds to an open cone within the ambient\nspace of symmetric tensors. Thus, we explore the mathematical structure of the\nunderlying sample space of such tensors, and introduce a new distance measure\nor metric, called the 'elasticity metric', between the tensors. Finally, we\nmodel and visualize a one-dimensional spatial field of orthotropic Kelvin\nmatrices using interpolation based on the elasticity metric.",

    "abstract": "Sign language videos are an important medium for spreading and learning sign\nlanguage. However, most existing human image synthesis methods produce sign\nlanguage images with details that are distorted, blurred, or structurally\nincorrect. They also produce sign language video frames with poor temporal\nconsistency, with anomalies such as flickering and abrupt detail changes\nbetween the previous and next frames. To address these limitations, we propose\na novel Pose-Guided Motion Model (PGMM) for generating fine-grained and\nmotion-consistent sign language videos. Firstly, we propose a new Coarse Motion\nModule (CMM), which completes the deformation of features by optical flow\nwarping, thus transfering the motion of coarse-grained structures without\nchanging the appearance; Secondly, we propose a new Pose Fusion Module (PFM),\nwhich guides the modal fusion of RGB and pose features, thus completing the\nfine-grained generation. Finally, we design a new metric, Temporal Consistency\nDifference (TCD) to quantitatively assess the degree of temporal consistency of\na video by comparing the difference between the frames of the reconstructed\nvideo and the previous and next frames of the target video. Extensive\nqualitative and quantitative experiments show that our method outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods in most benchmark tests, with visible improvements in\ndetails and temporal consistency.",

Specifically, we\nexamine the ISM of simulated galaxies to detect evidence of strong magnetic\nturbulence and provide statistics on the associated magnetic coherent\nstructures (MCoSs), such as current sheets, that arise in this context. We\nanalyzed MHD galaxy simulations with different initial magnetic field\nstructures (ordered or random) and studied the magnetic field fluctuations\n($\\delta B/B_0$) and the MCoSs, defined here as regions where the current\ndensity surpasses a certain threshold. We also studied the MCoS sizes and\nkinematics. The magnetic field disturbances in both models follow a log-normal\ndistribution, peaking at values close to unity, which turns into a power-law at\nlarge values ($\\rm \\delta B/B_0 > 1$). The current densities are widely\ndistributed, with deviations from a log-normal at the largest values. These\ndeviating values of the current density define MCoSs. We find that, in both\nmodels, MCoSs are fractally distributed in space, with a typical volume-filling\nfactor of about 10 percent, and tend to coincide with peaks of star formation\ndensity. Their fractal dimension is close to unity below kpc scales and between\n2 and 3 on larger scales. Our work challenges the prevailing paradigm of weak\nmagnetic turbulence in the ISM by demonstrating that strong magnetic\ndisturbances occur even when the initial magnetic field is initially ordered\ndue to differential rotation and supernova feedback.

It can be argued that these phenomena happen in the\nfinal stages of evaporation, where the semiclassical approximation needs to be\nrefined with quantum corrections also for the gravitational interaction. A\nnatural way to describe gravity at high energies is to add quadratic curvature\nterms to the Einstein-Hilbert action, i.e. quadratic gravity. At the\ncosmological level it is known that its classical solutions can give rise to a\nmodel of inflation that matches observations strikingly well, while in an\nastrophysical context it allows for the possibility of non-Schwarzschild black\nholes at small masses. These solutions have very peculiar properties, due to\nthe presence of a massive spin-2 particle corresponding to a ghost at the\nquantum level. The branch of non-Schwarzschild solutions crosses the one of\nSchwarzschild ones at a specific mass which could be between the one of an\nasteroid and the Planck mass, depending on the value of a slightly constrained\nfree parameter. By analyzing their dynamical stability and thermodynamical\nproperties, we investigate what could happen to a black hole that has\nevaporated to this crossing point.

In recent\ndecades, the analysis of this archetypal system has been mostly pursued under\nlinearized conditions, to calculate the critical boundaries separating stable\nfrom unstable behavior. However, nonlinear analysis of the self-sustained\noscillations ensuing flutter instabilities are considerably rarer. Here we\npresent a simplified one-dimensional nonlinear model describing a cantilever\nbeam subjected to confined axial flow, for generic axial profiles of the fluid\nchannels. In particular, we explore how the shape of the confinement walls\naffects the dynamics of the system. To simplify the problem, we consider\nsymmetric channels with plane walls in either converging or diverging\nconfigurations. The beam is modeled in a modal framework, while bulk-flow\nequations, including singular head-loss terms, are used to model the\nflow-structure coupling forces. The dynamics of the system are first analyzed\nthrough linear stability analysis to assess the stabilizing/destabilizing\neffects of the channel walls configuration. Subsequently, we develop a\nsystematic nonlinear analysis based on the continuation of periodic solutions.\nThe harmonic balance method is used in conjunction with the asymptotic\nnumerical method to calculate branches of periodic solutions. The\ncontinuation-based methods are used to investigate bifurcations with respect to\nboth the reduced flow velocity and the channel slope parameter. From the\nresults presented, we illustrate how continuationbased approaches and\nbifurcation analysis provide an efficient tool to analyze the nonlinear\nbehavior of flow-induced vibration problems, particularly when\nreduced/simplified models are available.",

The proposed method addresses the challenges of aligning aerial\nand ground data for pose estimation, which is crucial for accurate\npoint-to-point navigation in GPS-degraded environments. By integrating\ninformation from both perspectives into a factor graph framework, our approach\neffectively estimates the robot's global position and orientation.\nAdditionally, we enhance the repeatability of deep-learned keypoints for metric\nlocalisation in forests by incorporating a semantically-guided regression loss.\nThis loss encourages greater attention to wooden structures, e.g., tree trunks,\nwhich serve as stable and distinguishable features, thereby improving the\nconsistency of keypoints and increasing the success rate of global\nregistration, a process we refer to as re-localisation. The re-localisation\nmodule along with the factor-graph structure, populated by odometry and\nground-to-aerial factors over time, allows global localisation under dense\ncanopies. We validate the performance of our method through extensive\nexperiments in three forest scenarios, demonstrating its global localisation\ncapability and superiority over alternative state-of-the-art in terms of\naccuracy and robustness in these challenging environments.

    "abstract": "A global threshold (e.g., 0.5) is often applied to determine which bounding\nboxes should be included in the final results for an object detection task. A\nhigher threshold reduces false positives but may result in missing a\nsignificant portion of true positives. A lower threshold can increase detection\nrecall but may also result in more false positives. Because of this, using a\npreset global threshold (e.g., 0.5) applied to all the bounding box candidates\nmay lead to suboptimal solutions. In this paper, we propose a Test-time\nSelf-guided Bounding-box Propagation (TSBP) method, leveraging Earth Mover's\nDistance (EMD) to enhance object detection in histology images. TSBP utilizes\nbounding boxes with high confidence to influence those with low confidence,\nleveraging visual similarities between them. This propagation mechanism enables\nbounding boxes to be selected in a controllable, explainable, and robust\nmanner, which surpasses the effectiveness of using simple thresholds and\nuncertainty calibration methods. Importantly, TSBP does not necessitate\nadditional labeled samples for model training or parameter estimation, unlike\ncalibration methods. We conduct experiments on gland detection and cell\ndetection tasks in histology images. The results show that our proposed TSBP\nsignificantly improves detection outcomes when working in conjunction with\nstate-of-the-art deep learning-based detection networks.

Traditional Fully\nHomomorphic Encryption (FHE)-based non-inter-active training models are heavily\nburdened by computationally demanding bootstrapping. To develop an efficient\nsecure training system, we established a foundational framework, CryptoTrain-B,\nutilizing a hybrid cryptographic protocol that merges FHE with Oblivious\nTransfer (OT) for handling linear and non-linear operations, respectively. This\nintegration eliminates the need for costly bootstrapping. Although\nCryptoTrain-B sets a new baseline in performance, reducing its training\noverhead remains essential. We found that ciphertext-ciphertext multiplication\n(CCMul) is a critical bottleneck in operations involving encrypted inputs and\nmodels. Our solution, the CCMul-Precompute technique, involves precomputing\nCCMul offline and resorting to the less resource-intensive ciphertext-plaintext\nmultiplication (CPMul) during private training. Furthermore, conventional\npolynomial convolution in FHE systems tends to encode irrelevant and redundant\nvalues into polynomial slots, necessitating additional polynomials and\nciphertexts for input representation and leading to extra multiplications.\nAddressing this, we introduce correlated polynomial convolution, which encodes\nonly related input values into polynomials, thus drastically reducing the\nnumber of computations and overheads. By integrating CCMul-Precompute and\ncorrelated polynomial convolution into CryptoTrain-B, we facilitate a rapid and\nefficient secure training framework, CryptoTrain.

    "abstract": "Creative story generation has long been a goal of NLP research. While\nexisting methodologies have aimed to generate long and coherent stories, they\nfall significantly short of human capabilities in terms of diversity and\ncharacter depth. To address this, we introduce a novel story generation\nframework called CCI (Character-centric Creative story generation via\nImagination). CCI features two modules for creative story generation: IG\n(Image-Guided Imagination) and MW (Multi-Writer model). In the IG module, we\nutilize a text-to-image model to create visual representations of key story\nelements, such as characters, backgrounds, and main plots, in a more novel and\nconcrete manner than text-only approaches. The MW module uses these story\nelements to generate multiple persona-description candidates and selects the\nbest one to insert into the story, thereby enhancing the richness and depth of\nthe narrative. We compared the stories generated by CCI and baseline models\nthrough statistical analysis, as well as human and LLM evaluations. The results\nshowed that the IG and MW modules significantly improve various aspects of the\nstories' creativity. Furthermore, our framework enables interactive multi-modal\nstory generation with users, opening up new possibilities for human-LLM\nintegration in cultural development.

This paper investigates channel\nestimation in XL-RIS-aided massive MIMO systems under hybrid-field scenarios\nwhere far-field and near-field channels coexist. We formulate this problem\nusing dictionary learning, which allows for joint optimization of the\ndictionary and estimated channel. To handle the high-dimensional nature of\nXL-RIS channels, we specifically adopt a convolutional dictionary learning\n(CDL) formulation. The CDL formulation is cast as a bilevel optimization\nproblem, which we solve using a gradient-based approach.

In this paper, we propose a multi-stage image enhancement\nframework that models high-quality image distribution via a diffusion-based\nmodel. Specifically, we integrate the underlying morphological information from\nimages taken at different depths of the 3D volume to calibrate the reverse\nprocess toward high-quality and high-fidelity image generation. This is\nachieved through a fusion operation with a learnable tuner module that learns\nthe multi-to-one mapping from multi-depth to high-quality images. Moreover, the\nseparate learning of the high-quality image distribution and the spinal\nfeatures guarantees the preservation of consistent spinal pose descriptions in\nthe generated images, which is crucial in evaluating spinal deformities.\nRemarkably, our proposed enhancement algorithm significantly outperforms other\nenhancement-based methods on ultrasound images in terms of image quality.\nUltimately, we conduct the intra-rater and inter-rater measurements of UCA and\nhigher ICC (0.91 and 0.89 for thoracic and lumbar angles) on enhanced images,\nindicating our method facilitates the measurement of ultrasound curve angles\nand offers promising prospects for automated scoliosis diagnosis.",

Tin (Sn), a post-transition metal with a similar oxidation state (+4) as\nZr and Hf in ABX$_{3}$ structures but with different valence characteristics,\nremains underexplored in CPs. Given the influence of valence states on material\nproperties, Sn-based CPs are of great interest. This study employs density\nfunctional theory (DFT), density functional perturbation theory (DFPT), and\nmany-body perturbation theory (GW and BSE) to investigate a series of distorted\nSn-based CPs (ASnX$_{3}$, A = Ca, Sr, Ba; X = S, Se). Our results demonstrate\nthat these perovskites are mechanically stable and exhibit lower direct\nG$_{0}$W$_{0}$ bandgaps (0.79-1.50 eV) compared to their Zr- and Hf-based\ncounterparts. Analysis of carrier-phonon interactions reveals that the\ncharge-separated polaronic state is less stable than the bound exciton state in\nthese materials. Additionally, polaron-assisted charge carrier mobilities for\nelectrons (21.33-416.02 cm^{2}V^{-1}s^{-1}) and holes (7.02-260.69\ncm^{2}V^{-1}s^{-1}) are comparable to or higher than those in lead-based HPs\nand significantly exceed those of Zr- and Hf-based CPs, owing to reduced\ncarrier-phonon coupling. The estimated spectroscopic limited maximum efficiency\n(24.2%-31.2%)-confirmed through perovskite solar cell (PSC) simulations using\nSCAPS-1D software-indicates that these materials are promising candidates for\nphotovoltaic applications.",

    "abstract": "In the mobile development process, creating the user interface (UI) is highly\nresource intensive. Consequently, numerous studies have focused on automating\nUI development, such as generating UI from screenshots or design\nspecifications. However, they heavily rely on computer vision techniques for\nimage recognition. Any recognition errors can cause invalid UI element\ngeneration, compromising the effectiveness of these automated approaches.\nMoreover, developing an app UI from scratch remains a time consuming and labor\nintensive task.\n  To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach called GUIMIGRATOR,\nwhich enables the cross platform migration of existing Android app UIs to iOS,\nthereby automatically generating UI to facilitate the reuse of existing UI.\nThis approach not only avoids errors from screenshot recognition but also\nreduces the cost of developing UIs from scratch. GUIMIGRATOR extracts and\nparses Android UI layouts, views, and resources to construct a UI skeleton\ntree. GUIMIGRATOR generates the final UI code files utilizing target code\ntemplates, which are then compiled and validated in the iOS development\nplatform, i.e., Xcode. We evaluate the effectiveness of GUIMIGRATOR on 31\nAndroid open source applications across ten domains. The results show that\nGUIMIGRATOR achieves a UI similarity score of 78 between migration screenshots,\noutperforming two popular existing LLMs substantially. Additionally,\nGUIMIGRATOR demonstrates high efficiency, taking only 7.6 seconds to migrate\nthe datasets. These findings indicate that GUIMIGRATOR effectively facilitates\nthe reuse of Android UI code on iOS, leveraging the strengths of both platforms\nUI frameworks and making new contributions to cross platform development.",

However, learning robust object\nrepresentations for UAV tracking is especially challenging in complex dynamic\nenvironments, when confronted with aspect ratio change and occlusion. These\nchallenges severely alter the original information of the object. To handle the\nabove issues, this work proposes a novel progressive representation learning\nframework for UAV tracking, i.e., PRL-Track. Specifically, PRL-Track is divided\ninto coarse representation learning and fine representation learning. For\ncoarse representation learning, two innovative regulators, which rely on\nappearance and semantic information, are designed to mitigate appearance\ninterference and capture semantic information. Furthermore, for fine\nrepresentation learning, a new hierarchical modeling generator is developed to\nintertwine coarse object representations. Exhaustive experiments demonstrate\nthat the proposed PRL-Track delivers exceptional performance on three\nauthoritative UAV tracking benchmarks. Real-world tests indicate that the\nproposed PRL-Track realizes superior tracking performance with 42.6 frames per\nsecond on the typical UAV platform equipped with an edge smart camera.

In the hard parameter sharing approach, an\nencoder shared through multiple tasks generates data representations passed to\ntask-specific predictors. Therefore, it is crucial to have a shared encoder\nthat provides decent representations for every and each task. However, despite\nrecent advances in multi-task learning, the question of how to improve the\nquality of representations generated by the shared encoder remains open. To\naddress this gap, we propose a novel approach called Dummy Gradient norm\nRegularization that aims to improve the universality of the representations\ngenerated by the shared encoder.

Inspired by this, we\ninvestigate the analogous entropy inequalities in Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) and\nsparse SYK models, which involve the entanglement among different flavors of\nMajorana fermions rather than spatial entanglement. Sparse SYK models are\nmodels where some of the SYK couplings are set to zero. Since these models have\nbeen argued to admit gravity duals up to a certain sparseness, it is\ninteresting to see whether the multipartite entanglement structure changes in a\nsparseness-dependent manner. In the parameter space explored by our numerical\nanalysis, which we performed upto five parties, we find that all entropy\ninequalities are satisfied for any temperature and degree of sparseness for an\narbitrary choice of flavor subregions. In addition, if we plot the multipartite\nentanglement entropy in terms of purity, the only significant effect of\nsparseness is to change the range of purity. Thus, we conclude that\nmultipartite information is almost unaffected by sparseness. As a\ncounterexample, we also show that in a vector model of $N$-flavored Majorana\nfermions which contains no random variables, choices of subregions exist for\nwhich the entropy inequalities are violated.",

Here, we\nimprove the estimate of the Trotter error over existing bounds, by introducing\na general framework of commutant decomposition that separates disjoint error\ncomponents that have fundamentally different scaling with time. In particular\nwe identify two error components that each scale as $O(\\tau^pt)$ and\n$O(\\tau^p)$ for a $p$th-order product formula evolving to time $t$ using a\nfixed step size $\\tau$, it implies one would scale linearly with time $t$ and\nthe other would be constant of $t$.

However, the state-of-the-art (SOTA) enhancers\nfor nighttime UAV tracking always neglect the uneven light distribution in\nlow-light images, inevitably leading to excessive enhancement in scenarios with\ncomplex illumination. To address these issues, this work proposes a novel\nenhancer, i.e., LDEnhancer, enhancing nighttime UAV tracking with light\ndistribution suppression. Specifically, a novel image content refinement module\nis developed to decompose the light distribution information and image content\ninformation in the feature space, allowing for the targeted enhancement of the\nimage content information.

This is primarily due to the need for efficient recommendation,\nwhich requires adaptive and interactive responses. In this study, we focus on\nsequential recommendation and introduce a lightweight framework called\nfull-scale Matryoshka representation learning for multimodal recommendation\n(fMRLRec). Our fMRLRec captures item features at different granularities,\nlearning informative representations for efficient recommendation across\nmultiple dimensions. To integrate item features from diverse modalities,\nfMRLRec employs a simple mapping to project multimodal item features into an\naligned feature space. Additionally, we design an efficient linear\ntransformation that embeds smaller features into larger ones, substantially\nreducing memory requirements for large-scale training on recommendation data.\nCombined with improved state space modeling techniques, fMRLRec scales to\ndifferent dimensions and only requires one-time training to produce multiple\nmodels tailored to various granularities. We demonstrate the effectiveness and\nefficiency of fMRLRec on multiple benchmark datasets, which consistently\nachieves superior performance over state-of-the-art baseline methods.

    "abstract": "Information popularity prediction is important yet challenging in various\ndomains, including viral marketing and news recommendations. The key to\naccurately predicting information popularity lies in subtly modeling the\nunderlying temporal information diffusion process behind observed events of an\ninformation cascade, such as the retweets of a tweet. To this end, most\nexisting methods either adopt recurrent networks to capture the temporal\ndynamics from the first to the last observed event or develop a statistical\nmodel based on self-exciting point processes to make predictions. However,\ninformation diffusion is intrinsically a complex continuous-time process with\nirregularly observed discrete events, which is oversimplified using recurrent\nnetworks as they fail to capture the irregular time intervals between events,\nor using self-exciting point processes as they lack flexibility to capture the\ncomplex diffusion process. Against this background, we propose ConCat, modeling\nthe Continuous-time dynamics of Cascades for information popularity prediction.\nOn the one hand, it leverages neural Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) to\nmodel irregular events of a cascade in continuous time based on the cascade\ngraph and sequential event information. On the other hand, it considers cascade\nevents as neural temporal point processes (TPPs) parameterized by a conditional\nintensity function which can also benefit the popularity prediction task. We\nconduct extensive experiments to evaluate ConCat on three real-world datasets.\nResults show that ConCat achieves superior performance compared to\nstate-of-the-art baselines, yielding a 2.3%-33.2% improvement over the\nbest-performing baselines across the three datasets.",

Here, we quantify these back-fluxes,\nincluding neutrons, gamma rays, and electrons, using Monte Carlo calculations\nfor a range of structural material candidates and first wall thicknesses. The\nradiation back-flux magnitudes are remarkably large, with neutron and gamma\nradiation back-fluxes on the same order of magnitude as the incident fusion\nneutron flux. Electron back-fluxes are two orders of magnitudes lower, but are\nemitted at sufficiently high energies to provide a relatively large\nback-current through the sheath which may cause sheath reversal. Material\nconfiguration plays a key role in determining back-flux magnitudes. The\nstructural material chiefly determines the neutron back-flux magnitude, while\nthe first wall thickness principally attenuates the gamma ray and electron\nback-fluxes. In addition to prompt back-fluxes, which are emitted immediately\nafter fusion neutrons impact the surface, significant delayed gamma ray and\nelectron back-fluxes arise from nuclear decay processes in the activated\nmaterials. These delayed back-flux magnitudes range from 2%--7% of the prompt\nback-fluxes, and remain present during transients when fusion no longer occurs.\nDuring disruptions, build-up of delayed gamma radiation back-flux represents\npotential runaway electron seeding mechanisms, posing additional challenges for\ndisruption mitigation in a power reactor compared with non-nuclear plasma\noperations. This work highlights the impact of these radiation back-fluxes\nplasma performance and demonstrates the importance of considering back-flux\ngeneration in materials selection for fusion power reactors.",

    "abstract": "We introduce the ECG-Image-Database, a large and diverse collection of\nelectrocardiogram (ECG) images generated from ECG time-series data, with\nreal-world scanning, imaging, and physical artifacts. We used ECG-Image-Kit, an\nopen-source Python toolkit, to generate realistic images of 12-lead ECG\nprintouts from raw ECG time-series. The images include realistic distortions\nsuch as noise, wrinkles, stains, and perspective shifts, generated both\ndigitally and physically. The toolkit was applied to 977 12-lead ECG records\nfrom the PTB-XL database and 1,000 from Emory Healthcare to create\nhigh-fidelity synthetic ECG images. These unique images were subjected to both\nprogrammatic distortions using ECG-Image-Kit and physical effects like soaking,\nstaining, and mold growth, followed by scanning and photography under various\nlighting conditions to create real-world artifacts.\n  The resulting dataset includes 35,595 software-labeled ECG images with a wide\nrange of imaging artifacts and distortions. The dataset provides ground truth\ntime-series data alongside the images, offering a reference for developing\nmachine and deep learning models for ECG digitization and classification. The\nimages vary in quality, from clear scans of clean papers to noisy photographs\nof degraded papers, enabling the development of more generalizable digitization\nalgorithms.\n  ECG-Image-Database addresses a critical need for digitizing paper-based and\nnon-digital ECGs for computerized analysis, providing a foundation for\ndeveloping robust machine and deep learning models capable of converting ECG\nimages into time-series. The dataset aims to serve as a reference for ECG\ndigitization and computerized annotation efforts. ECG-Image-Database was used\nin the PhysioNet Challenge 2024 on ECG image digitization and classification.",

Rather than utilizing RFR for\nclassification or regression tasks (the most common use case for RFR), we\npropose a fundamentally new workflow in which we: (i) train random forest (RF)\nregressors on a set of spatio-temporal features of interest, (ii) calculate\ntheir pair-wise feature importances using the SHAP weights associated with\nthose features, and (iii) translate these feature importances into a weighted\npathway network (i.e., a weighted directed graph), which can be used to trace\nout and rank interdependencies between climate features and/or modalities.\nImportantly, while herein we employ RFR and SHAP feature importance in steps\n(i) and (ii) of our algorithm, our novel workflow is in no way tied to these\napproaches, which could be replaced with any regression method and sensitivity\nmethod. We adopt a tiered verification approach to verify our new pathway\nidentification methodology.

    "abstract": "This paper presents Omni 3D - a 3D-stacked device architecture that is\nnaturally enabled by back-end-of-line (BEOL)-compatible transistors. Omni 3D\narbitrarily interleaves metal layers for both signal/power with FETs in 3D\n(i.e., nFETs and pFETs are stacked in 3D). Thus, signal/power routing layers\nhave fine-grained, all-sided access to the FET active regions maximizing 3D\nstandard cell design flexibility. This is in sharp contrast to approaches such\nas back-side power delivery networks (BSPDNs), complementary FETs (CFETs), and\nstacked FETs. Importantly, the routing flexibility of Omni 3D is enabled by\ndouble-side routing and an interleaved metal (IM) layer for inter- and\nintra-cell routing, respectively. In this work, we explore Omni 3D variants\n(e.g., both with and without the IM layer) and optimize these variants using a\nvirtual-source BEOL-FET compact model. We establish a physical design flow that\nefficiently utilizes the double-side routing in Omni 3D and perform a thorough\ndesign-technology-co-optimization (DTCO) of Omni 3D device architecture on\nseveral design points. From our design flow, we project 2.0x improvement in the\nenergy-delay product and 1.5x reduction in area compared to the\nstate-of-the-art CFETs with BSPDNs.",

Sensitive radio continuum data could remove the difference between\nthe number of known supernova remnants (SNRs) in the Galaxy compared to that\nexpected, but due to confusion in the Galactic plane, faint SNRs can be\nchallenging to distinguish from brighter HII regions and filamentary radio\nemission. Aims. We wish to exploit new SARAO MeerKAT 1.3 GHz Galactic Plane\nSurvey (SMGPS) radio continuum data, which covers $251\\deg \\le l \\le 358\\deg$\nand $2\\deg \\le l \\le 61\\deg$ at $|b|\\le 1.5\\deg$, to search for SNR candidates\nin the Milky Way disk. Methods. We also use MIR data from the Spitzer GLIMPSE,\nSpitzer MIPSGAL, and WISE surveys to help identify SNR candidates. The\nidentified SNR candidate are sources of extended radio continuum emission that\nlack MIR counterparts, are not known as HII regions in the WISE Catalog of\nGalactic HII Regions, and are not known previously as SNRs Results. We locate\n237 new Galactic SNR candidates in the SMGPS data. We also identify and confirm\nthe expected radio morphology for 201 objects listed in the literature as being\nSNRs and 130 previously-identified SNR candidates. The known and candidate SNRs\nhave similar spatial distributions and angular sizes. Conclusions. The SMGPS\ndata allowed us to identify a large population of SNR candidates that can be\nconfirmed as true SNRs using radio polarization measurements or by deriving\nradio spectral indices. If the 237 candidates are confirmed as true SNRs, it\nwould approximately double the number of known Galactic SNRs in the survey\narea, alleviating much of the difference between the known and expected\npopulations.",

This delay\ncan expose OSS users to risks as malicious parties might exploit the software\nbefore fixes are publicly known. Therefore, it is important to identify\nvulnerability fixes early and automatically. Existing methods classify\nvulnerability fixes by learning code change representations from commits,\ntypically by concatenating code changes, which does not effectively highlight\nnuanced differences. Additionally, previous approaches fine-tune code embedding\nmodels and classification models separately, which limits overall\neffectiveness. We propose VFDelta, a lightweight yet effective framework that\nembeds code before and after changes using independent models with surrounding\ncode as context. By performing element-wise subtraction on these embeddings, we\ncapture fine-grain changes.

This work proposes a\nmean-teacher-based semi-supervised low-light enhancement (Semi-LLIE) framework\nthat integrates the unpaired data into model training. The mean-teacher\ntechnique is a prominent semi-supervised learning method, successfully adopted\nfor addressing high-level and low-level vision tasks. However, two primary\nissues hinder the naive mean-teacher method from attaining optimal performance\nin low-light image enhancement. Firstly, pixel-wise consistency loss is\ninsufficient for transferring realistic illumination distribution from the\nteacher to the student model, which results in color cast in the enhanced\nimages. Secondly, cutting-edge image enhancement approaches fail to effectively\ncooperate with the mean-teacher framework to restore detailed information in\ndark areas due to their tendency to overlook modeling structured information\nwithin local regions. To mitigate the above issues, we first introduce a\nsemantic-aware contrastive loss to faithfully transfer the illumination\ndistribution, contributing to enhancing images with natural colors. Then, we\ndesign a Mamba-based low-light image enhancement backbone to effectively\nenhance Mamba's local region pixel relationship representation ability with a\nmulti-scale feature learning scheme, facilitating the generation of images with\nrich textural details.

Further, we perform\nself-supervised training by enforcing flow-aided multi-level consistencies to\nadapt it to the real-world underwater environment. Our framework relies solely\non the 3D model and RGB images, alleviating the need for any real pose\nannotations or other-modality data like depths. We evaluate the effectiveness\nof FAFA on common underwater object pose benchmarks and showcase significant\nperformance improvements compared to state-of-the-art methods.

In the context of increasing climate change risks, despite\ngrowing interest and demand,, weather parametric insurance's market share\nremains limited due to inherent basis risk, which is the mismatch between\nactual loss and payout, leading to loss without payout or payout without loss.\nThis paper proposes a novel empirical research using Monte Carlo simulations to\ntest whether basis risk can be managed through diversification and hedged like\nother risks. Key findings include: Firstly, portfolio basis risk and volatility\ndecrease as the number of contracts increases. Secondly, spatial relationships\nsignificantly impact basis risk, with risk levels correlating with the ratio\nbetween insured location, weather station, and disaster footprint radius, and\nthirdly, event severity does not significantly impact basis risk, suggesting\nthat catastrophic disaster severity should not hinder parametric insurance\ndevelopment.",

To mitigate this gap, we propose EventHallusion, a novel\nbenchmark that focuses on assessing the VideoLLMs' hallucination toward event,\nthe crux of video analysis. From a hallucination attribution perspective, our\nEventHallusion benchmark is curated to assess a VideoLLM's susceptibility\ntoward language priors and vision-language biases.

Through comprehensive evaluation of eight open-source and two\nclosed-source VideoLLMs on the proposed EventHallusion benchmark, we observe\nthat the open-source models suffer significantly from hallucination problems,\nwhereas the closed-source ones perform markedly better.

Since the magnetic reconnection is thought to occur\nfrequently in the accretion flow around compact objects which induce strong\ngravitational field, it is now regarded to be a practical mechanism to extract\nenergy from rotation black holes, which motivates people to consider how to\ndescribe the process of magnetic reconnection in a generally relativistic way.\nIn this work, I try to explore the description of Sweet-Parker model, one of\nthe most famous theoretical models of magnetic reconnection, in general\nrelativity. I begin with revisiting the Sweet-Parker model in special\nrelativity and reorganize the calculations in seven steps, whose generally\nrelativistic forms are discussed. I propose in this work, from the general\ndiscussions and consequences of specific examples, that no property in\nSweet-Parker model would be modified by spacetime curvature, which is opposite\nto the conclusions in previous work.

    "abstract": "Quantum Machine Learning (QML) is an emerging field of research with\npotential applications to distributed collaborative learning, such as Split\nLearning (SL). SL allows resource-constrained clients to collaboratively train\nML models with a server, reduce their computational overhead, and enable data\nprivacy by avoiding raw data sharing. Although QML with SL has been studied,\nthe problem remains open in resource-constrained environments where clients\nlack quantum computing capabilities. Additionally, data privacy leakage between\nclient and server in SL poses risks of reconstruction attacks on the server\nside. To address these issues, we propose Hybrid Quantum Split Learning (HQSL),\nan application of Hybrid QML in SL. HQSL enables classical clients to train\nmodels with a hybrid quantum server and curtails reconstruction attacks.\nAdditionally, we introduce a novel qubit-efficient data-loading technique for\ndesigning a quantum layer in HQSL, minimizing both the number of qubits and\ncircuit depth. Evaluations on real hardware demonstrate HQSL's practicality\nunder realistic quantum noise. Experiments on five datasets demonstrate HQSL's\nfeasibility and ability to enhance classification performance compared to its\nclassical models. Notably, HQSL achieves mean improvements of over 3% in both\naccuracy and F1-score for the Fashion-MNIST dataset, and over 1.5% in both\nmetrics for the Speech Commands dataset. We expand these studies to include up\nto 100 clients, confirming HQSL's scalability. Moreover, we introduce a\nnoise-based defense mechanism to tackle reconstruction attacks on the server\nside. Overall, HQSL enables classical clients to train collaboratively with a\nhybrid quantum server, improving model performance and resistance against\nreconstruction attacks.",

Based on this, we design the\nCSI-ReST method, which injects channel state information (CSI) into the initial\nstate of GSSM to utilize its native response, and into the residual state to\nmitigate CSI forgetting, enabling effective channel adaptation without\nintroducing additional computational and parameter overhead.

Specifically, if $n$ represents the number of data points, $f$ denotes\nthe underlying function to be estimated, $\\hat{\\nu}_n$ is an estimate of $f$,\nand $\\sigma_n$ is the standard deviation of the additive Gaussian noise, then\n$\\inf_{\\hat{\\nu}_n} \\sup_f \\mathbb{E}_f\\| \\hat{\\nu}_n - f \\|^2_2$ decays at the\nrate $(\\max(1,\\sigma_n^4)/n)^{\\frac{2\\beta}{2\\beta+1}}$. Note that the rate\nachieved under purely additive noise is\n$({\\sigma_n^2/n})^{\\frac{2\\beta}{2\\beta+1}}$. We will provide a detailed\ncomparison of this rate with the one obtained in the presence of both noise\ntypes across different regimes of their relative magnitudes, and discuss the\ninsights that emerge from these comparisons.",

The flow shear perpendicular to the reconnecting plane prevails\nat the flank magnetopause under southward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF)\nconditions. However, the effect of the out-of-plane flow shear on asymmetric\nreconnection is an open question. In this study, we utilize kinetic simulations\nto investigate the impact of the out-of-plane flow shear on asymmetric\nreconnection. By systematically varying the flow shear strength, we analyze the\nflow shear effects on the reconnection rate, the diffusion region structure,\nand the energy conversion rate. We find that the reconnection rate increases\nwith the upstream out-of-plane flow shear, and for the same upstream\nconditions, it is higher at the dusk side than at the dawn side. The diffusion\nregion is squeezed in the outflow direction due to magnetic pressure which is\nproportional to the square of the Alfv\\'en Mach number of the shear flow.

A more lenient approach incorporates task-adaptive elements, such as\nfew-shot learning with an 137B LLM. In this paper, we challenge a trend\nequating query and question, and instead conceptualize query generation task as\na \"compilation\" of high-level intent into task-adaptive query.

Our method outperforms baselines and existing\nmodels on four tasks with underexplored intents, while utilizing a query\ngenerator 47 times smaller than the previous state-of-the-art. Our findings\nreveal that instructing the LM with explicit search intent is a key aspect of\nmodeling an effective query generator.",

    "abstract": "The efficiencies and form of the upconversion spectra of rare earth ions\nembedded in crystalline matrices strongly depend upon the phonon dispersion of\nthese, since the inter-level energy transition probabilities are influenced by\nthe phonon energies. The aim of this study is to show a novel method of\ninfluencing the phonon energy values of crystalline $BaY_2O_4$ and, by this, to\nfinely tune the spectra of any rare earth ion as a dopant of it. We used\n$Er^{3+}$ sensitized by $Yb^{3+}$ as dopants, but the same method can be\ngeneralized for other kind of rare earth ions. As such, we synthesized\n$BaY_2O_4$ and $BaY_2O_4:MgO (BaY_2MgO_5)$ ceramics having as\nactivator-sensitizer pairs the $Er^{3+}$ 1% and $Yb^{3+}$ 2% relative to the\nsubstituted $Y^{3+}$. Firstly, we synthesized the mix of precursor metallic\noxides by the citrate-gel method, pressed these into pellets, and sintered them\nto obtain doped crystalline ceramic samples. The ceramic samples were\nilluminated with 976 nm from a laser diode, and the resulting upconversion\nspectra of $Er^{3+}$ were measured. $BaY_2O_4$ and $BaY_2O_4:MgO (BaY_2MgO_5)$\nhave almost the same XRD signature, showing that the crystal unit cells have\nthe same parameters but they differ in the phononic energies due to the\npresence of the additional MgO. Comparing the results of these two extreme\ncases $BaY_2O_4$ vs. $BaY_2O_4:MgO (BaY_2MgO_5)$ reveals that the presence of\nthe MgO modifies the upconversion response. So, this study fulfills two goals:\nFirst, it reveals the structure of the undocumented $BaY_2O_4:MgO (BaY_2MgO_5)$\nand shows how it is based on the crystal structure of $BaY_2O_4$ with $Mg^{2+}$\nions occupying the unit cell interstitions. Secondly, it suggests a method of\ntuning the phononic energies of $BaY_2O_4$ and, as a consequence, the\nupconversion response of $Er^{3+}$.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, in an effort to promote fairness in the election process, a\nwide variety of techniques and metrics have been proposed to determine whether\na map is a partisan gerrymander. The most accessible measures, requiring easily\nobtained data, are metrics such as the Mean-Median Difference, Efficiency Gap,\nDeclination, and GEO metric. But for most of these metrics, researchers have\nstruggled to describe, given no additional information, how a value of that\nmetric on a single map indicates the presence or absence of gerrymandering.\n  Our main result is that each of these metrics is gameable when used as a\nsingle, isolated quantity to detect gerrymandering (or the lack thereof). That\nis, for each of the four metrics, we can find district plans for a given state\nwith an extremely large number of Democratic-won (or Republican-won) districts\nwhile the metric value of that plan falls within a reasonable, predetermined\nbound. We do this by using a hill-climbing method to generate district plans\nthat are constrained by the bounds on the metric but also maximize or nearly\nmaximize the number of districts won by a party.\n  In addition, extreme values of the Mean-Median Difference do not necessarily\ncorrespond to maps with an extreme number of districts won. Thus, the Mean-\nMedian Difference metric is particularly misleading, as it cannot distinguish\nmore extreme maps from less extreme maps. The other metrics are more nuanced,\nbut when assessed on an ensemble, none perform substantially differently from\nsimply measuring number of districts won by a fixed party.\n  One clear consequence of these results is that they demonstrate the folly of\nspecifying a priori bounds on a metric that a redistricting commission must\nmeet in order to avoid gerrymandering.",

The method takes into account uncertainty\nin fatigue lifetimes in structures due to defects at two scales: micro-scale\nheterogeneity & meso-scale pores. An element-wise probabilistic strain-life\nmodel with its criterion modified for taking into account multiaxial loading is\ndeveloped for taking into account the effect of micro-scale defects on the\nlifetime. Meso-scale pores in the structure are taken into account via\nstatistical modelling of the expected pore populations via a finite element\nmethod, based on tomographic scans of a small region of porous material used to\nmake the structure. A previously implemented Neuber-type plastic correction\nalgorithm is used for fast full-field approximation of the strain-life\ncriterion around the statistically generated pore fields. The probability of\nfailure of a porous structure is obtained via a weakest link assumption at the\nlevel of its constituent finite elements. The fatigue model can be identified\nvia a maximum likelihood estimate on experimental fatigue data of structures\ncontaining different types of pore populations. The proposed method is tested\non an existing high-cycle fatigue data-set of an aluminium alloy with two\nlevels of porosity. The model requires lesser data for identification than\ntraditional models that consider porous media as a homogeneous material, as the\nsame base material is considered for the two grades of porous material.\nNumerical studies on synthetically generated data show that the method is\ncapable of taking into account the statistical size effect in fatigue, and\ndemonstrate that fatigue properties of subsurface porous material are lower\nthan that of core porous material, which makes homogenisation of the method\nnon-trivial.",

Deep neural networks, known for their efficiency in\nhandling big data, are anticipated to be adept at extracting underlying\ninformation from images sharing certain characteristics, such as specific types\nof natural or medical images. We introduce a Normalizing Flow Regularization\n(NFR) method designed to reconstruct images from incomplete and noisy\nmeasurements. The method involves training a normalizing flow network to\nunderstand the statistical distribution of sample images by mapping them to\nGaussian distributions. This well-trained network then acts as a regularization\ntool within a Bayesian inversion framework. Additionally, we explore the\nconcept of adaptive regularization selection, providing theoretical proof of\nits admissibility. A significant challenge in three-dimensional image training\nis the extensive memory and computation requirements. We address this by\ntraining the normalizing flow model using only small-size images and applying a\npatch-based model for reconstructing larger images. Our approach is\nmodel-independent, allowing the reuse of a well-trained network as\nregularization for various imaging systems.

There is\na lack of label-free techniques for monitoring activity-dependent intracellular\nchanges. Electromagnetic (EM) waves at frequencies larger than 1x10^6 Hz (1\nMHz) were previously used to probe intracellular contents of cells, as cell\nmembrane becomes transparent at this frequency range. EM waves interact with\nmembranes of intracellular organelles, proteins, and water in the MHz-GHz\nrange. In this work, we developed a device for probing the interaction between\nintracellular contents of active neurons and EM waves. The device used an array\nof grounded coplanar waveguides (GCPWs) to deliver EM waves to a\nthree-dimensional (3D) spheroid of rat cortical neurons. Neural activity was\nevoked using optogenetics, with synchronous detection of propagation of EM\nwaves. Broadband measurements were conducted in the MHz-GHz range to track\nchanges in transmission coefficients. Neuronal activity was found to reversibly\nalter EM wave transmission. Pharmacological suppression of neuronal activity\nabolished changes in transmission. Time constants of changes in transmission\nwere in the range of seconds to tens of seconds, suggesting the presence of\nrelatively slow, activity-dependent intracellular processes.

Firstly, we show that for\n$\\kappa\\in (8/3,8)$, the loop intensity measure of the conformal loop ensemble\nagrees with the SLE loop measure as defined by Zhan (2021). The former was\ninitially considered by Kemppainen and Werner (2016) for $\\kappa\\in (8/3,4]$,\nand the latter was constructed for $\\kappa\\in (0,8)$.

However, existing\napproaches can only identify important parameters through qualitative analysis\nand manual experiments without quantitatively analyzing how their importance is\ndetermined. We propose a new criterion, so-called 'precision alignment', to\nbuild a quantitative framework to holistically evaluate the importance of\nparameters in mixed-precision quantization.

Different from existing quantization approaches\nthat focus on memory saving, this work directly aims to accelerate LLM\ninference through quantifying floating numbers.

These constraints in each hierarchy are derived\nfrom sequential measurement operators and the inner-product matrix of the\nnon-orthogonal quantum states. We apply the adapted NPA-hierarchy to tackle\nsome quantum information tasks, including sequential quantum random access\ncodes (QRACs) and randomness certification. First, we derive the optimal\ntrade-off between the two sequential receivers in the $2 \\to 1$ sequential\nQRACs. Furthermore, we have investigated semi-device-independent randomness\ncertification in the double violation region of $2 \\to 1$ sequential QRACs.\nSecond, considering the presence of eavesdropper (Eve) in actual communication,\nwe show how much global and local randomness can be certified using the optimal\ntrade-off of $2 \\to 1$ sequential QRACs. Additionally, we quantify the amount\nof local and global randomness that can be certified from the complete\nprobabilities generated by the two sequential receivers.

Thus, the model split inference is proposed to improve the\nperformance of edge intelligence, in which the AI model is divided into\ndifferent sub models and the resource-intensive sub model is offloaded to edge\nserver wirelessly for reducing resource requirements and inference latency.\nHowever, the previous works mainly concentrate on improving and optimizing the\nsystem QoS, ignore the effect of QoE which is another critical item for the\nusers except for QoS. Even the QoE has been widely learned in EC, considering\nthe differences between task offloading in EC and split inference in EI, and\nthe specific issues in QoE which are still not addressed in EC and EI, these\nalgorithms cannot work effectively in edge split inference scenarios. Thus, an\neffective resource allocation algorithm is proposed in this paper, for\naccelerating split inference in EI and achieving the tradeoff between inference\ndelay, QoE, and resource consumption, abbreviated as ERA. Specifically, the ERA\ntakes the resource consumption, QoE, and inference latency into account to find\nthe optimal model split strategy and resource allocation strategy. Since the\nminimum inference delay and resource consumption, and maximum QoE cannot be\nsatisfied simultaneously, the gradient descent based algorithm is adopted to\nfind the optimal tradeoff between them. Moreover, the loop iteration GD\napproach is developed to reduce the complexity of the GD algorithm caused by\nparameter discretization. Additionally, the properties of the proposed\nalgorithms are investigated, including convergence, complexity, and\napproximation error.

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have recently surpassed GANs in image synthesis and editing,\noffering superior image quality and diversity. However, achieving precise\ncontrol over attributes in generated images remains a challenge. Concept\nSliders introduced a method for fine-grained image control and editing by\nlearning concepts (attributes/objects). However, this approach adds parameters\nand increases inference time due to the loading and unloading of Low-Rank\nAdapters (LoRAs) used for learning concepts. These adapters are model-specific\nand require retraining for different architectures, such as Stable Diffusion\n(SD) v1.5 and SD-XL. In this paper, we propose a straightforward textual\ninversion method to learn concepts through text embeddings, which are\ngeneralizable across models that share the same text encoder, including\ndifferent versions of the SD model. We refer to our method as Prompt Sliders.\nBesides learning new concepts, we also show that Prompt Sliders can be used to\nerase undesirable concepts such as artistic styles or mature content. Our\nmethod is 30% faster than using LoRAs because it eliminates the need to load\nand unload adapters and introduces no additional parameters aside from the\ntarget concept text embedding. Each concept embedding only requires 3KB of\nstorage compared to the 8922KB or more required for each LoRA adapter, making\nour approach more computationally efficient.

Diamond nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center\nmagnetometry has emerged as an ideal tool, offering $\\mu$m-scale resolution,\nmillimeter-scale field of view, high sensitivity, and non-invasive imaging\ncompatible with diverse samples.

Without updating their knowledge, LLMs may\ninadvertently generate code that includes these newly discovered\nvulnerabilities.

Additionally, APILOT\nutilizes an augmented generation method that leverages this dataset to navigate\nLLMs in generating secure, version-aware code. We conducted a comprehensive\nevaluation to measure the effectiveness of APILOT in reducing the incidence of\noutdated API recommendations across seven different state-of-the-art LLMs. The\nevaluation results indicate that APILOT can reduce outdated code\nrecommendations by 89.42% on average with limited performance overhead.\nInterestingly, while enhancing security, APILOT also improves the usability of\nthe code generated by LLMs, showing an average increase of 27.54% in usability.\nThis underscores APILOT's dual capability to enhance both the safety and\npractical utility of code suggestions in contemporary software development\nenvironments.",

The problem is nonlinearly coupled in the\nsense that the a priori unknown (and random) displacement of the elastic\nstructure from its reference configuration determines the a priori unknown (and\nrandom) time-dependent fluid domain on which the compressible isentropic\nNavier-Stokes equations are posed. We use a splitting method, consisting of a\nfluid and structure subproblem, to construct random approximate solutions to an\napproximate Galerkin form of the problem with artificial viscosity and\nartificial pressure. We introduce stopped processes of structure displacements\nwhich handle the issues associated with potential fluid domain degeneracy. In\nthis splitting scheme, we handle mathematical difficulties associated with the\na priori unknown and time-dependent fluid domain by using an extension of the\nfluid equations to a fixed maximal domain and we handle difficulties associated\nwith imposing the no-slip condition in the stochastic setting by using a novel\npenalty term defined on an external tubular neighborhood of the moving\nfluid-structure interface. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\nwell-posedness result for stochastic fluid-structure interaction with\ncompressible fluids.",

    "abstract": "We theoretically and computationally investigate the cooling of antihydrogen,\n$\\bar{H}$, using optical molasses cooling. This updates the results in Ref. [1]\nto the current capabilities of the ALPHA experiment. Through Monte Carlo\nsimulation, we show that $\\bar{H}$s do not give the standard cooling even in an\nideal optical molasses because of their small mass and large transition\nfrequency. For optical molasses cooling in the ALPHA trap, the photons are\nconstrained to travel in one direction only. It is only through the phase space\nmixing in the trap that cooling in all directions can be achieved. We explore\nthe nontrivial role that laser intensity plays in the cooling. We also\ninvestigate the possibility for simultaneously cooling atoms in either of the\ntrapped ground states.",
