    "abstract": "Robust facial expression recognition in unconstrained, \"in-the-wild\"\nenvironments remains challenging due to significant domain shifts between\ntraining and testing distributions. Test-time adaptation (TTA) offers a\npromising solution by adapting pre-trained models during inference without\nrequiring labeled test data. However, existing TTA approaches typically rely on\nmanually selecting which parameters to update, potentially leading to\nsuboptimal adaptation and high computational costs. This paper introduces a\nnovel Fisher-driven selective adaptation framework that dynamically identifies\nand updates only the most critical model parameters based on their importance\nas quantified by Fisher information. By integrating this principled parameter\nselection approach with temporal consistency constraints, our method enables\nefficient and effective adaptation specifically tailored for video-based facial\nexpression recognition. Experiments on the challenging AffWild2 benchmark\ndemonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing TTA methods,\nachieving a 7.7% improvement in F1 score over the base model while adapting\nonly 22,000 parameters-more than 20 times fewer than comparable methods. Our\nablation studies further reveal that parameter importance can be effectively\nestimated from minimal data, with sampling just 1-3 frames sufficient for\nsubstantial performance gains. The proposed approach not only enhances\nrecognition accuracy but also dramatically reduces computational overhead,\nmaking test-time adaptation more practical for real-world affective computing\napplications.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge graphs (KGs) are ubiquitous and widely used in various\napplications. However, most real-world knowledge graphs are incomplete, which\nsignificantly degrades their performance on downstream tasks. Additionally, the\nrelationships in real-world knowledge graphs often follow a long-tail\ndistribution, meaning that most relations are represented by only a few\ntraining triplets. To address these challenges, few-shot learning has been\nintroduced. Few-shot KG completion aims to make accurate predictions for\ntriplets involving novel relations when only a limited number of training\ntriplets are available. Although many methods have been proposed, they\ntypically learn each relation individually, overlooking the correlations\nbetween different tasks and the relevant information in previously trained\ntasks. In this paper, we propose a transfer learning-based few-shot KG\ncompletion method (TransNet). By learning the relationships between different\ntasks, TransNet effectively transfers knowledge from similar tasks to improve\nthe current task's performance. Furthermore, by employing meta-learning,\nTransNet can generalize effectively to new, unseen relations. Extensive\nexperiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of TransNet over\nstate-of-the-art methods. Code can be found at\nhttps://github.com/lihuiliullh/TransNet/tree/main",

This literature emphasizes the\nimproved performance of these models relative to other natural language models,\nnoting that generative LLMs typically outperform other models and even humans\nacross several metrics. Previous literature has examined bias across many\napplications and contexts, but less work has focused specifically on bias in\ngenerative LLMs' responses to subjective annotation tasks. This bias could\nresult in labels applied by LLMs that disproportionately align with majority\ngroups over a more diverse set of viewpoints. In this paper, we evaluate how\nLLMs represent diverse viewpoints on these contentious tasks. Across four\nannotation tasks on four datasets, we show that LLMs do not show systematic\nsubstantial disagreement with annotators on the basis of demographics. Rather,\nwe find that multiple LLMs tend to be biased in the same directions on the same\ndemographic categories within the same datasets. Moreover, the disagreement\nbetween human annotators on the labeling task -- a measure of item difficulty\n-- is far more predictive of LLM agreement with human annotators.

This objective treats all documents\nthat are not explicitly annotated as relevant on an equally negative footing,\nregardless of their actual degree of relevance, thus (a) missing subtle nuances\nthat are useful for ranking and (b) being susceptible to annotation noise.

Taking a modular view, one may regard BKW as a combination of Wagner's\nalgorithm (CRYPTO 2002), run over the corresponding dual problem, and the\nAharonov-Regev distinguisher (JACM 2005). Hence the subexponential Wagner step\nalone should be of interest for solving this dual problem - namely, the Short\nInteger Solution problem (SIS) - but this appears to be undocumented so far.\n  We re-interpret this Wagner step as walking backward through a chain of\nprojected lattices, zigzagging through some auxiliary superlattices. We further\nrandomize the bucketing step using Gaussian randomized rounding to exploit the\npowerful discrete Gaussian machinery. This approach avoids sample amplification\nand turns Wagner's algorithm into an approximate discrete Gaussian sampler for\n$q$-ary lattices.\n  For an SIS lattice with $n$ equations modulo $q$, this algorithm runs in\nsubexponential time $\\exp(O(n/\\log \\log n))$ to reach a Gaussian width\nparameter $s = q/\\mathrm{polylog}(n)$ only requiring $m = n + \\omega(n/\\log\n\\log n)$ many SIS variables.

Regarding the second strategy, the ML-computed\nsolution vector generates residuals with mean absolute errors of\n$\\mathcal{O}(10^{-5})$. However, convergence studies reveal this level of\naccuracy to be insufficient, causing derivative operators to diverge at a lower\nresolution and achieve a lower accuracy than LABFM theoretically allows.\nFurthermore, there is marginal computational gain when computing the solution\nvector with neural networks compared to LU factorisation.

In this work, we investigate the impact of\nthis new dataset on dark sector interaction models, which are motivated by\nnon-gravitational interactions between dark energy (DE) and dark matter (DM),\ncommonly referred to as interacting dark energy models (IDE). We focus on two\nframeworks: the traditional IDE model and the recently proposed sign-switching\nInteracting model (S-IDE), aiming to derive new and robust constraints on both\nscenarios. After carefully selecting the sample for the joint analysis,\nensuring compatibility among the data without significant tension, our main\nresults indicate that both models can alleviate the $H_0$ tension, reducing it\nto moderate tension approximately $2.7\\sigma$. The IDE model shows\ncompatibility with the latest $S_8$ constraints from cosmic shear surveys,\nwhile the S-IDE model predicts lower values of $S_8$, which align with\nalternative perspectives on the $S_8$ tension. For the traditional IDE model,\nwe derive new bounds for the coupling parameter, marking the strongest\nconstraints to date through geometric measurements.

It localizes faulty program elements based on\na set of passing and failing test executions. Since whether a fault could be\ntriggered and detected by a test is related to program semantics, it is crucial\nto model program semantics in fault localization approaches. Existing\napproaches either consider the full semantics of the program (e.g.,\nmutation-based fault localization and angelic debugging), leading to\nscalability issues, or ignore the semantics of the program (e.g.,\nspectrum-based fault localization), leading to imprecise localization results.\nOur key idea is: by modeling only the correctness of program values but not\ntheir full semantics, a balance could be reached between effectiveness and\nscalability. To realize this idea, we introduce a probabilistic model by\nefficient approximation of program semantics and several techniques to address\nscalability challenges. Our approach, SmartFL(SeMantics bAsed pRobabilisTic\nFault Localization), is evaluated on a real-world dataset, Defects4J 2.0. The\ntop-1 statement-level accuracy of our approach is {14\\%}, which improves 130\\%\nover the best SBFL and MBFL methods. The average time cost is {205} seconds per\nfault, which is half of SBFL methods.

This couples learning and generating labels on the target\ndomain, and other recent works also leverage the generated labels to add\nadditional domain alignment losses. We believe this coupling is brittle and\nexcessively constrained: there is no guarantee that a student trained only on\nsource data can generate accurate target domain labels and initiate the\npositive feedback loop, and much better target domain labels can likely be\ngenerated by using a large pretrained network that has been exposed to much\nmore data. Vision foundational models are exactly such models, and they have\nshown impressive task generalization capabilities even when frozen.

First, we train a new labeller on source data only using a\nlarge frozen DINOv2 backbone and show it generates more accurate labels than\nMean Teacher. Next, we align the student's source and target image patch\nfeatures with those from a DINO encoder, driving source and target\nrepresentations closer to the generalizable DINO representation.

In this paper, we develop\na decentralized reinforcement learning (RL) method for D2D graph discovery that\npromotes communication of impactful datapoints over reliable links for multiple\nlearning paradigms, while following both data and device-specific trust\nconstraints. An independent RL agent at each device trains a policy to predict\nthe impact of incoming links in a decentralized manner without exposure of\nlocal data or significant communication overhead.

For unsupervised settings, we\ndevelop a variation-based diversity metric which estimates data diversity in\nterms of occupied latent space. Numerical experiments on five widely used\ndatasets confirm that the data diversity improvements induced by our method\nincrease convergence speed by up to 3 times while reducing energy consumption\nby up to 5 times.

    "abstract": "Cooperative speech is purposive. From the speaker's perspective, one crucial\npurpose is the transmission of knowledge. Cooperative speakers care about\ngetting things right for their conversational partners. This attitude is a kind\nof respect. Cooperative speech is an ideal form of communication because\nparticipants have respect for each other. And having respect within a\ncooperative enterprise is sufficient for a particular kind of moral standing:\nwe ought to respect those who have respect for us. Respect demands reciprocity.\nI maintain that large language models aren't owed the kind of respect that\npartly constitutes a cooperative conversation. This implies that they aren't\ncooperative interlocutors, otherwise we would be obliged to reciprocate the\nattitude. Leveraging this conclusion, I argue that present-day LLMs are\nincapable of assertion and that this raises an overlooked doubt about their\nsemantic competence. One upshot of this argument is that knowledge of meaning\nisn't just a subject for the cognitive psychologist. It's also a subject for\nthe moral psychologist.",

    "abstract": "The growing ageing population and their preference to maintain independence\nby living in their own homes require proactive strategies to ensure safety and\nsupport. Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) technologies have emerged to facilitate\nageing in place by offering continuous monitoring and assistance within the\nhome. Within AAL technologies, action recognition plays a crucial role in\ninterpreting human activities and detecting incidents like falls, mobility\ndecline, or unusual behaviours that may signal worsening health conditions.\nHowever, action recognition in practical AAL applications presents challenges,\nincluding occlusions, noisy data, and the need for real-time performance. While\nadvancements have been made in accuracy, robustness to noise, and computation\nefficiency, achieving a balance among them all remains a challenge. To address\nthis challenge, this paper introduces the Robust and Efficient Temporal\nConvolution network (RE-TCN), which comprises three main elements: Adaptive\nTemporal Weighting (ATW), Depthwise Separable Convolutions (DSC), and data\naugmentation techniques. These elements aim to enhance the model's accuracy,\nrobustness against noise and occlusion, and computational efficiency within\nreal-world AAL contexts. RE-TCN outperforms existing models in terms of\naccuracy, noise and occlusion robustness, and has been validated on four\nbenchmark datasets: NTU RGB+D 60, Northwestern-UCLA, SHREC'17, and DHG-14/28.\nThe code is publicly available at: https://github.com/Gbouna/RE-TCN",

Patterns in the dataset\nhighlight specific areas where improved safety measures could have significant\nimpact. We extend our analysis by demonstrating interactive clustering maps\nthat embed all recalls into a shared latent space based on recall descriptions\nand product names. Leveraging these data-driven tools, we explore three case\nstudies to demonstrate the dataset's utility in identifying product risks and\nguiding safer design decisions. The first two case studies illustrate how\ndesigners can visualize patterns across recalled products and situate new\nproduct ideas within the broader recall landscape to proactively anticipate\nhazards. In the third case study, we extend our approach by employing a large\nlanguage model (LLM) to predict potential hazards based solely on product\nimages. This demonstrates the model's ability to leverage visual context to\nidentify risk factors, revealing strong alignment with historical recall data\nacross many hazard categories. However, the analysis also highlights areas\nwhere hazard prediction remains challenging, underscoring the importance of\nrisk awareness throughout the design process.

We consider a $\\gamma$ dimensional measure embedded in\nan $N$ dimensional space and discuss how to determine its dimension, both in\n$N$ dimensions and projected into $D$ dimensions.\n  It is a highly non-trivial problem to decode the original geometry from lower\ndimensional projection of a high-dimensional measure. The projections are\nspace-feeling, the popular box-counting techniques do not apply, and the\nFourier methods are contaminated by aliasing effects. In the present paper we\ndemonstrate that under the \"Copernican hypothesis'' that we are not observing\nobjects from a special direction, projection in a wavelet basis is remarkably\nsimple: the wavelet power spectrum of a projected $\\gamma$ dimensional measure\nis $P_j \\propto 2^{-j\\gamma}$. This holds regardless of the embedded dimension,\n$N$, and the projected dimension, $D$. This approach could have potentially\nbroad applications in data sciences where a typically sparse matrix encodes\nlower dimensional information embedded in an extremely high dimensional field\nand often measured in projection to a low dimensional space.\n  Here, we apply this method to JWST and Chandra observations of the nearby\nsupernova Cas A.

In order to\nsolve these problems, we propose a novel LIDAR-based localization framework,\nwhich achieves high accuracy and provides robust localization in 3D pointcloud\nmaps with information of multi-sensors. The system integrates global\ninformation with LIDAR-based odometry to optimize the localization state. To\nimprove robustness and enable fast resumption of localization, this paper uses\noffline pointcloud maps for prior knowledge and presents a novel registration\nmethod to speed up the convergence rate.

This paper presents a\ncomprehensive study on the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in\npredicting Ethereum prices for short-term and few-shot forecasting scenarios.\nThe main challenge in training models for time series analysis is the lack of\ndata. We address this by leveraging a novel approach that adapts existing\npre-trained LLMs on natural language or images from billions of tokens to the\nunique characteristics of Ethereum price time series data. Through thorough\nexperimentation and comparison with traditional and contemporary models, our\nresults demonstrate that selectively freezing certain layers of pre-trained\nLLMs achieves state-of-the-art performance in this domain. This approach\nconsistently surpasses benchmarks across multiple metrics, including Mean\nSquared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error\n(RMSE), demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness. Our research not only\ncontributes to the existing body of knowledge on LLMs but also provides\npractical insights in the cryptocurrency prediction domain.

While\ntopological invariants are generally regarded as global quantities, we argue\nthat space-resolved topological markers can act as local order parameters,\nrevealing the role of fluctuations and correlations in the local topology under\nAnderson disorder and vacancies.

We analyzed their DRS spectra using the Kubelka-Munk (KM) function, the\nTauc plot, and the first derivative of the reflectance for a comparative study.\nBiMnO3 exhibits an electronic transition with indirect band gap energy, Eg =\n0.92 eV.

Moreover, a reduction in the band gap energy of multiferroic\nBiFeO3 was observed due to induced chemical pressure from (Ba, Ca) doping and a\ndecrease in particle size.

To address\nthese challenges, we introduce AstroAgents, a large language model-based,\nmulti-agent AI system for hypothesis generation from mass spectrometry data.\nAstroAgents is structured around eight collaborative agents: a data analyst, a\nplanner, three domain scientists, an accumulator, a literature reviewer, and a\ncritic. The system processes mass spectrometry data alongside user-provided\nresearch papers. The data analyst interprets the data, and the planner\ndelegates specific segments to the scientist agents for in-depth exploration.\nThe accumulator then collects and deduplicates the generated hypotheses, and\nthe literature reviewer identifies relevant literature using Semantic Scholar.\nThe critic evaluates the hypotheses, offering rigorous suggestions for\nimprovement. To assess AstroAgents, an astrobiology expert evaluated the\nnovelty and plausibility of more than a hundred hypotheses generated from data\nobtained from eight meteorites and ten soil samples. Of these hypotheses, 36%\nwere identified as plausible, and among those, 66% were novel. Project website:\nhttps://astroagents.github.io/",

    "abstract": "In this work, we construct three coupled optical modes systems to obtain\neffective Hamiltonian mediated by coherent dissipative coupling during\nadiabatic elimination of large dissipation mode. We investigate the cooperative\neffect of coherent and dissipative photon-photon couplings in an open cavity\nsystem, which leads to nonreciprocity with a considerably large isolation ratio\nand flexible controllability. We discover unidirectional invisibility for\nelectromagnetic wave propagation, which appears at the zero-damping condition\n(ZDC) for hybrid photon-photon modes and obtain transmission spectrum on the\nZDC. We study the influences of the parameters on the nonreciprocal\ntransmission of the system to capture the generic physics of the interference\nbetween coherent and dissipative couplings, which accurately reproduces the\nresults of numerical simulation over a broad range of parameters. Moreover, we\nextend the study of nonreciprocal transmission with the Markovian approximation\nto the non-Markovian environments, which consist of a collection of oscillators\n(bosonic photonic modes) and give the adiabatic elimination method with\nnon-Markovian effects. We illustrate that nonreciprocal transmission on ZDC\nexhibits a crossover from the non-Markovian to the Markovian regimes by\ncontrolling the environmental spectral width. This indicates a promising way to\nenhance or steer quantum nonreciprocal devices in optical cavities and provides\npotential applications for precision measurements and optical communications\nwith non-Markovian effects.",

    "abstract": "Recently, tensor fibered rank has demonstrated impressive performance by\neffectively leveraging the global low-rank property in all directions for\nlow-rank tensor completion (LRTC). However, it still has some limitations.\nFirstly, the typical tensor fibered rank approximation based on tensor nuclear\nnorm (TNN) processes fixed and data-independent transformation, which may not\nbe optimal for the underlying tensor structure. Secondly, it ignores the local\npiecewise smoothness of the dataset. To address these limitations, we present a\nnonconvex learnable transformed fibered nuclear norm (NLTFNN) model for\nLRTC,which uses a learnable transformed fibered nuclear norm with\nLog-Determinant (LTFNNLog) as tensor fibered rank approximation, and employs a\ntotal variation (TV) regularization to explore local piecewise smoothness. An\nefficient algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers\n(ADMM) is developed to solve NLTFNN and the convergence of the algorithm is\nproved theoretically. Experiments on various datasets show the superiority of\nNLTFNN over several existing methods.",

In the GAM analysis, word and\nsense emerged as crucial predictors of f0 contours, with effect sizes that\nexceed those of tone pattern. For each word token in our dataset, we then\nobtained a contextualized embedding by applying the GPT-2 large language model\nto the context of that token in the corpus. We show that the pitch contours of\nword tokens can be predicted to a considerable extent from these contextualized\nembeddings, which approximate token-specific meanings in contexts of use.

Using 3D-printed phantom\nmoulds generated from a magnetic resonance image of a human forearm, we moulded\nthe material into an anthropomorphic shape.

Through a\nsystematic review of 72 papers, this work reviewed previously studied older\nadults' characteristics and analyzed participants' experiences and expectations\nof CAs for health. We found that (1) Past research has an increasing interest\non chatbots and voice assistants and applied CA as multiple roles in older\nadults' health. (2) Older adults mainly showed low acceptance CAs for health\ndue to various reasons, such as unstable effects, harm to independence, and\nprivacy concerns. (3) Older adults expect CAs to be able to support multiple\nfunctions, to communicate using natural language, to be personalized, and to\nallow users full control. We also discuss the implications based on the\nfindings.",

The Motion Plane Adaptive\n(MPA) motion model projects the frames on multiple perspective planes in the 3D\nspace.

In this work, we enhance this\nmotion model with an affine parameterization and motion estimation method.\nThereby, we find a feasible trade-off between the quality of the reconstructed\nframes and the computational cost. The affine motion estimation is hereby done\nwith the inverse compositional Lucas-Kanade algorithm. With the proposed\nmethod, it is possible to improve the motion compensation significantly, so\nthat the motion compensated frame has a Weighted-to-Spherically-uniform Peak\nSignal-to-Noise Ratio (WS-PSNR) which is about 1.6 dB higher than with the\nconventional MPA.

    "abstract": "In order to shed light on the quantum-to-classical transition of the\nprimordial perturbations in single field inflation, we investigate the\ndecoherence and associated quantum corrections to the correlation functions of\nsuperhorizon scalar curvature perturbations. The latter are considered as an\nopen quantum system which undergoes quantum decoherence induced by a\ntime-dependent environment of deep subhorizon tensorial modes through the\ntrilinear interactions predicted by General Relativity. We first prove that, in\nfull generality, a time dependent subhorizon environment can be relevant for\ndecoherence during inflation, by considering derivativeless interactions,\nwhich, in our case, give the most important results. For the first time, the\ntime dependence of the environment is properly taken into account by modifying\nthe quantum master equation. Important non-Markovian effects pop up, instead,\nwhen dealing with derivative interactions. We adopt a possible way to treat\nthem which has been recently proposed and seems well suited for our case. Our\nresults show that when considering the interplay between derivativeless and\nderivative interactions, decoherence is slowed down. This underlines the\nimportance of accounting for all the interactions in open quantum-system\ncalculations in an inflationary setting. We finally compute the quantum\ncorrections to cosmological correlation functions, by solving the transport\nequations induced by the quantum master equation. We also compare the results\nto the solutions obtained by an alternative method previously used in the\nliterature. We observe a resummation of the quantum corrections to the\npower-spectrum, which is a general property of quantum master equations. We\nextend these results to the bispectrum, showing a decay of this correlation\nfunction in time which is analogous to the one found, previously, for the\npower-spectrum.",

A\ngrating interferometer uses a diffraction grating to produce a periodic\ninterference pattern and measures how a patient or sample perturbs the pattern,\nproducing three unique images that highlight X-ray absorption, refraction, and\nsmall angle scattering, known as the transmission, differential-phase, and\ndark-field images, respectively. Image artifacts that are unique to X-ray\ninterferometry are introduced when assuming the fringe pattern is perfectly\nsinusoidal and the phase steps are evenly spaced. Inaccuracies in grating\nposition, coupled with multi-harmonic fringes, lead to remnant oscillations and\nphase wraparound artifacts. We have developed an image recovery algorithm that\nuses additional harmonics, direct relative phase fitting, and phase step\ncorrections to prevent them. The direct relative phase fitting removes the\nphase wraparound artifact. Correcting the phase step positions and introducing\nthe additional harmonic removes the grating remnant artifact present in the\ntransmission, differential-phase, and dark-field images.

However, the high-security status of such facilities\nmay restrict modelers from deploying human activity sensors for data\ncollection. This problem was encountered when deploying MetaPOL, a digital twin\nsystem to prevent insider threat or sabotage of secure facilities, at a secure\nnuclear reactor facility at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). This\nchallenge was addressed using an agent-based model (ABM), driven by anecdotal\nevidence of facility personnel POL, to generate synthetic movement\ntrajectories. These synthetic trajectories were then used to train deep neural\nnetwork surrogates for next location and stay duration prediction to drive NPCs\nin the VR environment. In this study, we evaluate the efficacy of this\ntechnique for establishing NPC movement within MetaPOL and the ability to\ndistinguish NPC movement during normal operations from that during a simulated\nemergency response. Our results demonstrate the success of using a multi-layer\nperceptron for next location prediction and mixture density network for stay\nduration prediction to predict the ABM generated trajectories.

Regression analysis on\nblood pressure data from patients experiencing a variety of heart rates\ncaptured a logarithmic relationship between mean arterial pressure and heart\nrate, F_S=0.086 *ln(HR-41.2)+0.079, where F_S is the MAP form factor\ncorresponding to the fraction of time the cardiac cycle spends in ventricular\nsystole. The logarithmic relationship is qualitatively distinct from the linear\nand exponential relationships previously suggested in the literature yet better\naligns with the known human physiology. This heart rate-dependent formula for\nthe mean arterial pressure recapitulates the classic intuition as a special\ncase (HR=60bpm implies F_S =1/3).

This limitation hinders AI's ability\nto engage in human-like reasoning and cultural expression. In this paper, we\ninvestigate this challenge through an in-depth analysis of comics that\njuxtapose panels to create humor through contradictions. We introduce the\nYesBut (V2), a novel benchmark with 1,262 comic images from diverse\nmultilingual and multicultural contexts, featuring comprehensive annotations\nthat capture various aspects of narrative understanding. Using this benchmark,\nwe systematically evaluate a wide range of VLMs through four complementary\ntasks spanning from surface content comprehension to deep narrative reasoning,\nwith particular emphasis on comparative reasoning between contradictory\nelements. Our extensive experiments reveal that even the most advanced models\nsignificantly underperform compared to humans, with common failures in visual\nperception, key element identification, comparative analysis and\nhallucinations. We further investigate text-based training strategies and\nsocial knowledge augmentation methods to enhance model performance. Our\nfindings not only highlight critical weaknesses in VLMs' understanding of\ncultural and creative expressions but also provide pathways toward developing\ncontext-aware models capable of deeper narrative understanding though\ncomparative reasoning.",

    "abstract": "A theoretical framework bridging General Relativity (GR) and Quantum Dynamics\n(QD) is introduced through the application of Kripke semantics and linear\nlogic. While conventional unification efforts often rely on structural or\ngeometrical formulations, we instead treat causality, energy and information as\nfinite, non-replicable resources constraining physical transitions and\ninference. Our framework, termed Energy Constrained Linear Causality (ECLC),\nmodels quantum transitions and spacetime evolution as logically constrained\nprocesses in which each implication spends limited resources and cannot be\narbitrarily duplicated or reversed. We construct a causal inference model where\nphysical operations like quantum measurement, entanglement propagation and\nspacetime curvature are expressed as energy-weighted, one-time transformations.\nKripke semantics formalizes the logical accessibility of physical states,\ncapturing context-sensitive transitions and the irreversibility of information\nflow under finite conditions. We derive a structured method for modelling\nobserver-dependent outcomes without invoking background-independence or\nhigh-dimensional embeddings. We formulate a series of testable predictions with\ncontrolled deviations from standard GR and QD expectations. The\nconsumption-based irreversibility introduces an intrinsic mechanism of symmetry\nbreaking. In GR, it restricts mutual causal accessibility by bounding inference\ndepth with curvature-weighted energy costs. In QD, it disrupts the reciprocity\nof conditional probabilities and undermines time symmetry in measurement\nsequences. Therefore, ECLC provides a unified, resource-aware logic for\ndescribing causality, computation and emergence within a finite physical\nuniverse.",

While all models produce\nvisually realistic images with well-preserved morphological variable\ndistributions, we focus on their ability to learn and generalize the underlying\ndata distribution. The diffusion model shows a transition from memorization to\ngeneralization as the dataset size increases, confirming previous findings.\nSmaller datasets lead to overfitting, while larger datasets enable novel sample\ngeneration, supported by the denoising process's theoretical basis. For the\nflow-based model, we propose an \"inversion test\" leveraging its bijective\nnature. Similarly, the GAN-based model achieves comparable morphological\nconsistency but lacks bijectivity. We then introduce a \"discriminator test\",\nwhich shows successful learning for larger datasets but poorer confidence with\nsmaller ones. Across all models, dataset sizes below O(100,000) pose challenges\nto learning.

    "abstract": "We discuss the results of the spectroscopic and photometric monitoring of the\ntype IIn supernova (SN) 2023ldh. Survey archive data show that the SN\nprogenitor experienced some erratic outbursts in the years before exploding.\nFrom May 2023, the source shows a general slow luminosity rise lasting over\nfour months with some superposed luminosity fluctuations. In analogy to SN\n2009ip, we label this brightening as Event A. During Event A, SN 2023ldh\nreaches a maximum absolute magnitude of Mr = -15.52 +- 0.24 mag. Then the light\ncurves show a luminosity decline of about 1 mag in all filters lasting about\ntwo weeks, followed by a steep brightening (Event B) to an absolute peak\nmagnitude of Mr = -18.53 +- 0.23 mag, replicating the evolution of SN 2009ip\nand similar SNe IIn. Three spectra of SN 2023ldh are obtained during Event A,\nshowing multi-component P Cygni profiles of H I and Fe II lines. During the\nrise to the Event B peak, the spectrum shows a blue continuum dominated by\nBalmer lines in emission with Lorentzian profiles, with a full width at\nhalf-maximum (FWHM) velocity of about 650 km/s. Later, in the post-peak phase,\nthe spectrum reddens, and broader wings appear in the Halpha line profile.\nMetal lines are well visible with P Cygni profiles and velocities of about 2000\nkm/s. Beginning around three months past maximum and until very late phases,\nthe Ca II lines become among the most prominent features, while Halpha is\ndominated by an intermediate-width component with a boxy profile. Although SN\n2023ldh mimics the evolution of other SN 2009ip-like transients, it is slightly\nmore luminous and has a slower photometric evolution. The surprisingly\nhomogeneous observational properties of SN 2009ip-like events may indicate\nsimilar explosion scenarios and similar progenitor parameters.",

These hyperfluids encode the\nmicrostructure of matter including shear, dilation, and spin via the\nhypermomentum tensor. In this paper, we focus on the observational constraints\nof the recently introduced Yano-Schr\\\"odinger hyperfluid, which sources a\nspecial type of nonmetricity, that preserves the lengths of vectors under\nautoparallel transport. We propose a model in which the effective nonmetricity\ncontributions to pressure and matter density are related linearly as\n$p_{\\text{eff}} = \\omega \\rho_{\\text{eff}}$. This assumption allows for a\nstraightforward parameterization of deviations from standard cosmological\nbehavior while maintaining analytical tractability. To constrain the effective\nequation of state parameter $\\omega$, we perform a Bayesian parameter\nestimation using Nested Sampling, implemented via the \\texttt{PyPolyChord}\nlibrary. We use Baryon Acoustic Oscillation measurements from the Dark Energy\nSpectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 2 (DR2), along with Type Ia\nsupernova and Cosmic Chronometer data.

Analytical approximations of the synchrotron\nemissivity, absorptivity, and rotativity are limited to a few simple electron\ndistribution functions that inadequately capture the complexity of cosmic\nplasmas. Numerical integrations of the transfer coefficients, on the other\nhand, are accurate but computationally prohibitive for large-scale simulations.\nIn this paper, we present a new numerical method, Chorus, which evaluates the\ntransfer coefficients by expressing any electron distribution function as a\nweighted sum of functions with known analytical formulas. Specifically, the\nMaxwell-J\\\"uttner distribution function is employed as the basic component in\nthe weighted sum. The Chorus leverages the additivity of transfer coefficients,\ndrawing inspiration from an analogous approach that uses stochastic averaging\nto approximate the $\\kappa$ distribution function. The key findings demonstrate\nmedian errors below $5\\%$ for emissivity and absorptivity, with run times\nreduced from hours to milliseconds compared to first-principles numerical\nintegrations. Validation against a single $\\kappa$ distribution, as well as its\nextension to more complex distributions, confirms the robustness and\nversatility of the method. However, limitations are found, including increased\nerrors at higher energies due to numerical precision constraints and challenges\nwith rotativity calculations arising from fit function inaccuracies.

Given a\nfunction f and an input x, it quantifies each feature's contribution to f(x).\nRecently, SHAP has been increasingly used for global insights: practitioners\naverage the absolute SHAP values over many data points to compute global\nfeature importance scores, which are then used to discard unimportant features.\nIn this work, we investigate the soundness of this practice by asking whether\nsmall aggregate SHAP values necessarily imply that the corresponding feature\ndoes not affect the function. Unfortunately, the answer is no: even if the i-th\nSHAP value is 0 on the entire data support, there exist functions that clearly\ndepend on Feature i. The issue is that computing SHAP values involves\nevaluating f on points outside of the data support, where f can be\nstrategically designed to mask its dependence on Feature i. To address this, we\npropose to aggregate SHAP values over the extended support, which is the\nproduct of the marginals of the underlying distribution. With this\nmodification, we show that a small aggregate SHAP value implies that we can\nsafely discard the corresponding feature. We then extend our results to\nKernelSHAP, the most popular method to approximate SHAP values in practice. We\nshow that if KernelSHAP is computed over the extended distribution, a small\naggregate value justifies feature removal. This result holds independently of\nwhether KernelSHAP accurately approximates true SHAP values, making it one of\nthe first theoretical results to characterize the KernelSHAP algorithm itself.\nOur findings have both theoretical and practical implications. We introduce the\nShapley Lie algebra, which offers algebraic insights that may enable a deeper\ninvestigation of SHAP and we show that randomly permuting each column of the\ndata matrix enables safely discarding features based on aggregate SHAP and\nKernelSHAP values.",

However, the\nbroadcast nature of wireless channels makes SemCom systems vulnerable to\neavesdropping, which poses a serious threat to data privacy. Therefore, we\ninvestigate secure SemCom systems that preserve data privacy in the presence of\neavesdroppers. Specifically, we first explore a scenario where eavesdroppers\nare intelligent and can exploit semantic information to reconstruct the\ntransmitted data based on advanced artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. To\ncounter this, we introduce novel eavesdropping attack strategies that utilize\nmodel inversion attacks and generative AI (GenAI) models. These strategies\neffectively reconstruct transmitted private data processed by the semantic\nencoder, operating in both glass-box and closed-box settings. Existing defense\nmechanisms against eavesdropping often cause significant distortions in the\ndata reconstructed by eavesdroppers, potentially arousing their suspicion. To\naddress this, we propose a semantic covert communication approach that\nleverages an invertible neural network (INN)-based signal steganography module.\nThis module covertly embeds the channel input signal of a private sample into\nthat of a non-sensitive host sample, thereby misleading eavesdroppers. Without\naccess to this module, eavesdroppers can only extract host-related information\nand remain unaware of the hidden private content. We conduct extensive\nsimulations under various channel conditions in image transmission tasks.\nNumerical results show that while conventional eavesdropping strategies achieve\na success rate of over 80\\% in reconstructing private information, the proposed\nsemantic covert communication effectively reduces the eavesdropping success\nrate to 0.",

Our approach exploits the problem's geometric properties,\nyielding high-quality motion capture free from common artifacts in prior works.\nQualitative and quantitative evaluations, along with extensive comparisons,\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Specifically, we organize these events into a dynamic event graph,\nwhich represents the interplay between \\textbf{core events} that shape the\nprimary idea and \\textbf{supporting events} that provide critical context\nduring the whole dialogue. By leveraging this dynamic graph, EventWeave helps\nmodels focus on the most relevant events when generating responses, thus\navoiding repeated visits of the entire dialogue history.

    "abstract": "Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) significantly improve the reasoning ability of\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) by learning to reason, exhibiting promising\nperformance in solving complex tasks. However, their deliberative reasoning\nprocess leads to inefficiencies in token usage, memory consumption, and\ninference time. Thus, this survey provides a review of efficient inference\nmethods designed specifically for LRMs, focusing on mitigating token\ninefficiency while preserving the reasoning quality. The overview structure of\nthis paper is shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:paper_structure}. First, we introduce a\ntaxonomy to group the recent methods into two main categories: (a) explicit\ncompact Chain-of-Thought (CoT), which reduces tokens while keeping the explicit\nreasoning structure, and (b) implicit latent CoT, which encodes reasoning steps\nwithin hidden representations instead of explicit tokens. Meanwhile, we discuss\ntheir strengths and weaknesses. Then, we conduct empirical analyses on existing\nmethods from reasoning scenarios, object functions, and performance \\&\nefficiency aspects. Besides, we present open challenges in this field,\nincluding human-centric controllable reasoning, trade-off between\ninterpretability and efficiency of reasoning, ensuring the safety of efficient\nreasoning, and broader applications of efficient reasoning. In addition, we\nhighlight key insights for enhancing LRMs' inference efficiency via techniques\nsuch as model merging, new architectures, and agent routers.

Based on\nthis classification, we determine the minimal cardinality of indistinguishable\nGBS sets in $\\mathbb{C}^{6}\\otimes \\mathbb{C}^{6}$ under one-way local\noperations and classical communication (one-way LOCC). We propose first two\nclassification methods based on LU-equivalence for all $l$-GBS sets for $l\\geq\n2$. We then establish LU-classification for all 2-GBS, 3-GBS, 4-GBS and 5-GBS\nsets in $\\mathbb{C}^{6}\\otimes \\mathbb{C}^{6}$. Since LU-equivalent sets share\nidentical local distinguishability, it suffices to examine representative GBS\nsets from equivalent classes.

    "abstract": "In this study, we investigate traversable wormholes within the framework of\nEinstein-Euler-Heisenberg (EEH) nonlinear electrodynamics. By employing the\nEinstein field equations with quantum corrections from the Euler-Heisenberg\nLagrangian, we derive wormhole solutions and examine their geometric, physical,\nand gravitational properties. Two redshift function models are analyzed: one\nwith a constant redshift function and another with a radial-dependent function\n$\\Phi=r_{0}/r$. Our analysis demonstrates that the inclusion of quantum\ncorrections significantly influences the wormhole geometry, particularly by\nmitigating the need for exotic matter. The shape function and energy density\nare derived and examined in both models, revealing that the energy conditions,\nincluding the weak and null energy conditions (WEC and NEC), are generally\nviolated at the wormhole throat. However, satisfaction of the strong energy\ncondition (SEC) is observed, consistent with the nature of traversable\nwormholes. The Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) mass of the EEH wormhole is\ncalculated, showing contributions from geometric, electromagnetic, and quantum\ncorrections. The mass decreases with the Euler-Heisenberg correction parameter,\nindicating that quantum effects contribute significantly to the wormhole mass.\nFurthermore, we investigate gravitational lensing within the EEH wormhole\ngeometry using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, revealing that the deflection angle is\ninfluenced by both the electric charge and the nonlinear parameter. The\nnonlinear electrodynamic corrections enhance the gravitational lensing effect,\nparticularly at smaller impact parameters.",

However, existing benchmarks primarily evaluate pre-trained\nmodels without additional training or fine-tuning, often lack a dedicated focus\non reasoning, and fail to establish a systematic evaluation framework. To\naddress these limitations, we introduce VGRP-Bench, a Visual Grid Reasoning\nPuzzle Benchmark featuring 20 diverse puzzles. VGRP-Bench spans multiple\ndifficulty levels, and includes extensive experiments not only on existing chat\nLVLMs (e.g., GPT-4o), but also on reasoning LVLMs (e.g., Gemini-Thinking). Our\nresults reveal that even the state-of-the-art LVLMs struggle with these\npuzzles, highlighting fundamental limitations in their puzzle-solving\ncapabilities. Most importantly, through systematic experiments, we identify and\nanalyze key factors influencing LVLMs' puzzle-solving performance, including\nthe number of clues, grid size, and rule complexity. Furthermore, we explore\ntwo Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) strategies that can be used in post-training:\nSFT on solutions (S-SFT) and SFT on synthetic reasoning processes (R-SFT).\nWhile both methods significantly improve performance on trained puzzles, they\nexhibit limited generalization to unseen ones.

Asteroseismic characterisation of red giants has traditionally relied\non global seismic parameters, not the full spectrum of individual oscillation\nmodes. Here, we present the first characterisation of two evolved very\nmetal-poor stars, including the detailed mixed-mode patterns. We demonstrate\nthat incorporating individual frequencies into grid-based modelling of\nred-giant stars enhances its precision, enabling detailed studies of these\nancient stars and allowing us to infer the stellar properties of two\n$[\\mathrm{Fe}/\\mathrm{H}]{\\sim}{-}2.5$ dex Kepler stars: KIC 4671239 and KIC\n7693833. Recent developments in both observational and theoretical\nasteroseismology allows for detailed studies of the complex oscillation pattern\nof evolved giants. We employ Kepler time series and surface properties from\nhigh-resolution spectroscopic data to asteroseismically characterise the two\nstars using the BAyesian STellar Algorithm, BASTA. Both stars show agreement\nbetween constraints from seismic and classical observables; an overlap\nunrecoverable when purely considering the global seismic parameters. KIC\n4671239 and KIC 7693833 were determined to have masses of\n$0.78^{+0.04}_{-0.03}$ and $0.83^{+0.03}_{-0.01} M_{\\odot}$ with ages of\n$12.1^{+1.6}_{-1.5}$ and $10.3^{+0.6}_{-1.4}$ Gyr, respectively.

Simultaneously, a THz radio map, which\ncaptures signal propagation characteristics through the distribution of\nreceived signal strength (RSS), is well-suited for sensing, as it inherently\ncontains obstacle-related information and reflects the unique properties of the\nTHz channel. This means that communication-assisted sensing in ISAC can be\neffectively achieved using a THz radio map. However, constructing a radio map\npresents significant challenges due to the sparse deployment of THz sensors and\ntheir limited ability to accurately measure the RSS distribution, which\ndirectly affects obstacle sensing. In this paper, we formulate an integrated\nproblem for the first time, leveraging the mutual enhancement between sensed\nobstacles and the constructed THz radio maps. To address this challenge while\nimproving generalization, we propose an integration framework based on a\nconditional generative adversarial network (CGAN), which uncovers the manifold\nstructure of THz radio maps embedded with obstacle information. Furthermore,\nrecognizing the shared environmental semantics across THz radio maps from\ndifferent beam directions, we introduce a novel voting-based sensing scheme,\nwhere obstacles are detected by aggregating votes from THz radio maps generated\nby the CGAN. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework\noutperforms non-integrated baselines in both radio map construction and\nobstacle sensing, achieving up to 44.3% and 90.6% reductions in mean squared\nerror (MSE), respectively, in a real-world scenario.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in solving\ncomplex tasks. Recent work has explored decomposing such tasks into subtasks\nwith independent contexts. However, some contextually related subtasks may\nencounter information loss during execution, leading to redundant operations or\nexecution failures. To address this issue, we propose a training-free framework\nwith an interaction mechanism, which enables a subtask to query specific\ninformation or trigger certain actions in completed subtasks by sending\nrequests. To implement interaction, we introduce a subtask trajectory memory to\nenable resumption of completed subtasks upon receiving interaction requests.\nAdditionally, we propose a new action during execution, which generates a\nconcise and precise description of execution process and outcomes of a subtask,\nto assist subsequent subtasks in determining interaction targets and requests.\nWe evaluate our framework on interactive decision-making task WebShop and\nmulti-hop question answering HotpotQA, with GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, and comparison\nresults show that our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art training-free\nbaselines.",

    "abstract": "Learned Image Compression (LIC) has attracted considerable attention due to\ntheir outstanding rate-distortion (R-D) performance and flexibility. However,\nthe substantial computational cost poses challenges for practical deployment.\nThe issue of feature redundancy in LIC is rarely addressed. Our findings\nindicate that many features within the LIC backbone network exhibit\nsimilarities.\n  This paper introduces ShiftLIC, a novel and efficient LIC framework that\nemploys parameter-free shift operations to replace large-kernel convolutions,\nsignificantly reducing the model's computational burden and parameter count.\nSpecifically, we propose the Spatial Shift Block (SSB), which combines shift\noperations with small-kernel convolutions to replace large-kernel. This\napproach maintains feature extraction efficiency while reducing both\ncomputational complexity and model size. To further enhance the representation\ncapability in the channel dimension, we propose a channel attention module\nbased on recursive feature fusion. This module enhances feature interaction\nwhile minimizing computational overhead. Additionally, we introduce an improved\nentropy model integrated with the SSB module, making the entropy estimation\nprocess more lightweight and thereby comprehensively reducing computational\ncosts.\n  Experimental results demonstrate that ShiftLIC outperforms leading\ncompression methods, such as VVC Intra and GMM, in terms of computational cost,\nparameter count, and decoding latency. Additionally, ShiftLIC sets a new SOTA\nbenchmark with a BD-rate gain per MACs/pixel of -102.6\\%, showcasing its\npotential for practical deployment in resource-constrained environments.

Automatically identifying the root cause of these\nfailures is critical for ensuring high reliability and availability.

Recent methods leverage large language models (LLMs) to\nanalyze issue reports, but their effectiveness is limited by incomplete or\nambiguous user-provided information. To obtain more accurate and comprehensive\nRCA results, the core idea of this work is to extract additional diagnostic\nclues from code to supplement data-limited issue reports.

Our evaluation on datasets from five real-world\ndistributed systems demonstrates that COCA significantly outperforms existing\nmethods, achieving a 28.3% improvement in root cause localization and a 22.0%\nimprovement in root cause summarization.

To understand their impact, studies are performed with two levels\nof geometry simplifications. Our results indicate that flow field predictions\non these simplified geometries are visibly affected. The first level of\nsimplification loses the local asymmetry but is able to reasonably approximate\nvarious parameters, capturing patterns with the correct magnitude. However,\nfurther simplification to a smooth one does not show vortex structures in the\nflow field.

In this context, the isomeric\nratio can be used as a powerful tool to distinguish between different formation\nroutes of molecules with increasing levels of complexity. While the most stable\ncis conformer of methyl formate (CH3OCHO, MF) is ubiquitous in the ISM, there\nis just one tentative detection of the higher-energy trans form toward the\nenvelope of the star-forming region Sgr B2(N). Here, we present the detections\nof trans-methyl formate toward the Galactic Center molecular cloud\nG+0.693-0.027 and the protostellar shock L1157-B1, providing definite\nobservational evidence of its presence in the ISM. Numerous unblended or\nslightly blended $a$-type $K_a$ = 0, 1 transitions belonging to the\n$A$-substate of trans-MF have been identified in both sources. We derive a\nmolecular column density for trans-methyl formate of N = (8.2 $\\pm$ 0.4)\n$\\times$10$^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$ and N = (1.6 $\\pm$ 0.3) $\\times$10$^{12}$\ncm$^{-2}$, respectively, yielding a molecular abundance with respect to H$_2$\nof $\\sim$6 $\\times$ 10$^{-11}$ and $\\sim$8 $\\times$ 10$^{-10}$.

These results are compared with new grain-surface theoretical\ncomputations, which suggest that a stereoespecific formation of trans-MF via\nthe CH3O + HCO route on grain surfaces can qualitatively explain the observed\ncis/trans abundance ratio. Nevertheless, we show that additional\nstereoespecific gas-phase routes could also play a crucial role in maintaining\nthe intricate balance between formation and destruction of trans-MF, ultimately\nleading to its detection.",

    "abstract": "Stable aerial manipulation during dynamic tasks such as object catching,\nperching, or contact with rigid surfaces necessarily requires compliant\nbehavior, which is often achieved via impedance control. Successful\nmanipulation depends on how effectively the impedance control can tackle the\nunavoidable coupling forces between the aerial vehicle and the manipulator.\nHowever, the existing impedance controllers for aerial manipulator either\nignore these coupling forces (in partitioned system compliance methods) or\nrequire their precise knowledge (in complete system compliance methods).\nUnfortunately, such forces are very difficult to model, if at all possible. To\nsolve this long-standing control challenge, we introduce an impedance\ncontroller for aerial manipulator which does not rely on a priori knowledge of\nthe system dynamics and of the coupling forces. The impedance control design\ncan address unknown coupling forces, along with system parametric\nuncertainties, via suitably designed adaptive laws. The closed-loop system\nstability is proved analytically and experimental results with a\npayload-catching scenario demonstrate significant improvements in overall\nstability and tracking over the state-of-the-art impedance controllers using\neither partitioned or complete system compliance.",

Here, we take\nexperimentally synthesized 2D ferromagnetic $\\mathrm{CrX_3}$ (X=Cl, Br and I)\nas the parent material and achieve altermagnetism through external field.\nFirst, we achieve the transition from ferromagnetism to antiferromagnetism\nthrough biaxial strain.

Moreover, through the application of Janus engineering to\nconstruct $\\mathrm{CrX_{1.5}Y_{1.5}}$ (X$\\neq$Y=Cl, Br and I), the phase\ntransition from ferromagnetism to antiferromagnetism induced by strain alone is\nsufficient to trigger the emergence of altermagnetism.

In this work,\nwe present a nearly free-lunch method (named FreeInv) to address the issue more\neffectively and efficiently. In FreeInv, we randomly transform the latent\nrepresentation and keep the transformation the same between the corresponding\ninversion and reconstruction time-step.

FreeInv can be\nfreely integrated into existing inversion-based image and video editing\ntechniques. Especially for inverting video sequences, it brings more\nsignificant fidelity and efficiency improvements.

To address these issues, we propose a pipeline that uses LLMs to\nconstruct a biomedical knowledge graph (BioStrataKG) from large-scale articles\nand builds a cross-document question-answering dataset (BioCDQA) to evaluate\nlatent knowledge retrieval and multi-hop reasoning. We then introduce\nIntegrated and Progressive Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning (IP-RAR) to enhance\nretrieval accuracy and knowledge reasoning. IP-RAR maximizes information recall\nthrough Integrated Reasoning-based Retrieval and refines knowledge via\nProgressive Reasoning-based Generation, using self-reflection to achieve deep\nthinking and precise contextual understanding. Experiments show that IP-RAR\nimproves document retrieval F1 score by 20\\% and answer generation accuracy by\n25\\% over existing methods.

    "abstract": "In the domain of 3D content creation, achieving optimal mesh topology through\nAI models has long been a pursuit for 3D artists. Previous methods, such as\nMeshGPT, have explored the generation of ready-to-use 3D objects via mesh\nauto-regressive techniques. While these methods produce visually impressive\nresults, their reliance on token-by-token predictions in the auto-regressive\nprocess leads to several significant limitations. These include extremely slow\ngeneration speeds and an uncontrollable number of mesh faces. In this paper, we\nintroduce MeshCraft, a novel framework for efficient and controllable mesh\ngeneration, which leverages continuous spatial diffusion to generate discrete\ntriangle faces. Specifically, MeshCraft consists of two core components: 1) a\ntransformer-based VAE that encodes raw meshes into continuous face-level tokens\nand decodes them back to the original meshes, and 2) a flow-based diffusion\ntransformer conditioned on the number of faces, enabling the generation of\nhigh-quality 3D meshes with a predefined number of faces. By utilizing the\ndiffusion model for the simultaneous generation of the entire mesh topology,\nMeshCraft achieves high-fidelity mesh generation at significantly faster speeds\ncompared to auto-regressive methods. Specifically, MeshCraft can generate an\n800-face mesh in just 3.2 seconds (35$\\times$ faster than existing baselines).\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that MeshCraft outperforms state-of-the-art\ntechniques in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations on ShapeNet dataset\nand demonstrates superior performance on Objaverse dataset. Moreover, it\nintegrates seamlessly with existing conditional guidance strategies, showcasing\nits potential to relieve artists from the time-consuming manual work involved\nin mesh creation.",

The current paradigm is that sub-Neptunes on close-in orbits\nevolve into super-Earths via atmospheric escape driven by high-energy stellar\nirradiation. We use an integrated hydrodynamic-radiation-chemical network model\nof outflow to demonstrate that this escape is modulated by the abundance of\nH2O, an efficient infrared coolant.

While Bayesian model selection is a helpful tool to compare\nthese models using measurement data, it requires the computationally expensive\nestimation of a multidimensional integral -- known as the marginal likelihood\nor as the model evidence (\\textit{i.e.}, the probability of observing the\nmeasured data given the model). This study presents efficient approaches for\nestimating this marginal likelihood by transforming it into a one-dimensional\nintegral that is subsequently evaluated using a quadrature rule at multiple\nadaptively-chosen iso-likelihood contour levels. Three different algorithms are\nproposed to estimate the probability mass at each adapted likelihood level\nusing samples from importance sampling, stratified sampling, and Markov chain\nMonte Carlo sampling, respectively. The proposed approach is illustrated\nthrough four numerical examples. The first example validates the algorithms\nagainst a known exact marginal likelihood. The second example uses an 11-story\nbuilding subjected to an earthquake excitation with an uncertain hysteretic\nbase isolation layer with two models to describe the isolation layer behavior.\nThe third example considers flow past a cylinder when the inlet velocity is\nuncertain. Based on these examples, the method with stratified sampling is by\nfar the most accurate and efficient method for complex model behavior in low\ndimension.

While\nsingle-species protein function prediction methods have achieved remarkable\nsuccess, multi-species protein function prediction methods are still in the\nstage of using PPI networks and sequence features. Providing effective\ncross-species label propagation for species with sparse protein annotations\nremains a challenging issue. To address this problem, we propose the MSNGO\nmodel, which integrates structural features and network propagation methods.\nOur validation shows that using structural features can significantly improve\nthe accuracy of multi-species protein function prediction. Results: We employ\ngraph representation learning techniques to extract amino acid representations\nfrom protein structure contact maps and train a structural model using a graph\nconvolution pooling module to derive protein-level structural features. After\nincorporating the sequence features from ESM-2, we apply a network propagation\nalgorithm to aggregate information and update node representations within a\nheterogeneous network. The results demonstrate that MSNGO outperforms previous\nmulti-species protein function prediction methods that rely on sequence\nfeatures and PPI networks.

Although advances\nin deep learning have enabled automatic classification of coral reef\nconditions, conventional deep models struggle to achieve high performance when\nprocessing complex underwater ecological images. Vision foundation models,\nknown for their high accuracy and cross-domain generalizability, offer\npromising solutions. However, fine-tuning these models requires substantial\ncomputational resources and results in high carbon emissions. To address these\nchallenges, adapter learning methods such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) have\nemerged as a solution. This study introduces an approach integrating the DINOv2\nvision foundation model with the LoRA fine-tuning method. The approach\nleverages multi-temporal field images collected through underwater surveys at\n15 dive sites at Koh Tao, Thailand, with all images labeled according to\nuniversal standards used in citizen science-based conservation programs. The\nexperimental results demonstrate that the DINOv2-LoRA model achieved superior\naccuracy, with a match ratio of 64.77%, compared to 60.34% achieved by the best\nconventional model. Furthermore, incorporating LoRA reduced the trainable\nparameters from 1,100M to 5.91M. Transfer learning experiments conducted under\ndifferent temporal and spatial settings highlight the exceptional\ngeneralizability of DINOv2-LoRA across different seasons and sites.

This phenomenon represents\none of the critical challenges in quality control for hydraulic dams, bridge\npiers and abutments, tunnel linings, and similar engineering structures. To\nensure structural safety, it is imperative to calculate temperature variations\nwhile optimizing and controlling the temperature stress field. In this paper, a\nnovel method for calculating the zero-stress temperature field is proposed,\nconsidering the temperature history and hydration heat release increments at\nvarious locations within mass concrete during the curing period, the parameter\nof average forming temperature field is defined to subsequently solve the\ntemperature stress field. Several typical hydration heat release models were\nselected to calibrate the computational accuracy of the average forming\ntemperature. Based on simulation results, an optimal model was applied to\nvalidate the effectiveness of the proposed method through practical engineering\ncase studies. The impacts of casting temperature, ambient temperature during\nthe curing period, and dimensional thickness on temperature-induced stresses\nwere systematically investigated.

    "abstract": "In order to reconcile the entropy reduction of a system through external\ninterventions that are linked to a measurement with the second law of\nthermodynamics, there are two main proposals: (i) The entropy reduction is\ncompensated by the entropy increase as a result of the measurement on the\nsystem (``Szilard principle\"). (ii) The entropy reduction is compensated by the\nentropy increase as a result of the erasure of the measurement results\n(``Landauer/Bennett principle\"). It seems that the LB principle is widely\naccepted in the scientific debate. In contrast, in this paper we argue for a\nmodified S principle and criticize the LB principle with regard to various\npoints. Our approach is based on the concept of ``conditional action\", which is\ndeveloped in detail. To illustrate our theses, we consider the entropy balance\nof a variant of the well-known Szilard engine, understood as a classical\nmechanical system.",

    "abstract": "Despite advancements in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), adaptive attacks\ncontinue to challenge their robustness. Certified robustness based on\nrandomized smoothing has emerged as a promising solution, offering provable\nguarantees that a model's predictions remain stable under adversarial\nperturbations within a specified range. However, existing methods face a\ncritical trade-off between accuracy and robustness, as achieving stronger\nrobustness requires introducing greater noise into the input graph. This\nexcessive randomization degrades data quality and disrupts prediction\nconsistency, limiting the practical deployment of certifiably robust GNNs in\nreal-world scenarios where both accuracy and robustness are essential. To\naddress this challenge, we propose \\textbf{AuditVotes}, the first framework to\nachieve both high clean accuracy and certifiably robust accuracy for GNNs. It\nintegrates randomized smoothing with two key components,\n\\underline{au}gmentation and con\\underline{dit}ional smoothing, aiming to\nimprove data quality and prediction consistency. The augmentation, acting as a\npre-processing step, de-noises the randomized graph, significantly improving\ndata quality and clean accuracy. The conditional smoothing, serving as a\npost-processing step, employs a filtering function to selectively count votes,\nthereby filtering low-quality predictions and improving voting consistency.\nExtensive experimental results demonstrate that AuditVotes significantly\nenhances clean accuracy, certified robustness, and empirical robustness while\nmaintaining high computational efficiency. Notably, compared to baseline\nrandomized smoothing, AuditVotes improves clean accuracy by $437.1\\%$ and\ncertified accuracy by $409.3\\%$ when the attacker can arbitrarily insert $20$\nedges on the Cora-ML datasets, representing a substantial step toward deploying\ncertifiably robust GNNs in real-world applications.",

However, they also openly\nengaged in risky behaviors, such as sharing personal account information with\npeers and even perpetrating privacy and security risks against others.\nNonetheless, we found many of these behaviors could be explained by the unique\n\"privacy calculus\" of youth, where they often prioritized social benefits over\npotential risks; for instance, youth often shared account credentials with\npeers to foster social connection and affirmation. As such, we provide a\nnuanced understanding of youth decision-making regarding digital security and\nprivacy, highlighting both positive behaviors, tensions, and points of concern.\nWe encourage future research to continue to challenge the potentially untrue\nnarratives regarding youth and their digital privacy and security to unpack the\nnuance of their privacy calculus that may differ from that of adults.",

A critical challenge in\nDP-SGD is selecting the optimal clipping threshold C, which involves balancing\nthe trade-off between clipping bias and noise magnitude, incurring substantial\nprivacy and computing overhead during hyperparameter tuning.\n  In this paper, we propose Dynamic Clipping DP-SGD (DC-SGD), a framework that\nleverages differentially private histograms to estimate gradient norm\ndistributions and dynamically adjust the clipping threshold C.

However, most existing\nmethods focus on sparse view reconstruction of small regions and cannot produce\neligible whole-scene reconstruction results in terms of either quality or\nefficiency. In this paper, we propose FreeSplat++, which focuses on extending\nthe generalizable 3DGS to become an alternative approach to large-scale indoor\nwhole-scene reconstruction, which has the potential of significantly\naccelerating the reconstruction speed and improving the geometric accuracy. To\nfacilitate whole-scene reconstruction, we initially propose the Low-cost\nCross-View Aggregation framework to efficiently process extremely long input\nsequences. Subsequently, we introduce a carefully designed pixel-wise triplet\nfusion method to incrementally aggregate the overlapping 3D Gaussian primitives\nfrom multiple views, adaptively reducing their redundancy. Furthermore, we\npropose a weighted floater removal strategy that can effectively reduce\nfloaters, which serves as an explicit depth fusion approach that is crucial in\nwhole-scene reconstruction. After the feed-forward reconstruction of 3DGS\nprimitives, we investigate a depth-regularized per-scene fine-tuning process.\nLeveraging the dense, multi-view consistent depth maps obtained during the\nfeed-forward prediction phase for an extra constraint, we refine the entire\nscene's 3DGS primitive to enhance rendering quality while preserving geometric\naccuracy. Extensive experiments confirm that our FreeSplat++ significantly\noutperforms existing generalizable 3DGS methods, especially in whole-scene\nreconstructions.

    "abstract": "Long-context question-answering (LCQA) systems have greatly benefited from\nthe powerful reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), which can\nbe categorized into slow and quick reasoning modes. However, both modes have\ntheir limitations. Slow thinking generally leans to explore every possible\nreasoning path, which leads to heavy overthinking and wastes time. Quick\nthinking usually relies on pattern matching rather than truly understanding the\nquery logic, which misses proper understanding. To address these issues, we\npropose FReM: Flexible Reasoning Mechanism, a method that adjusts reasoning\ndepth according to the complexity of each question. Specifically, FReM\nleverages synthetic reference QA examples to provide an explicit chain of\nthought, enabling efficient handling of simple queries while allowing deeper\nreasoning for more complex ones. By doing so, FReM helps quick-thinking models\nmove beyond superficial pattern matching and narrows the reasoning space for\nslow-thinking models to avoid unnecessary exploration. Experiments on seven QA\ndatasets show that FReM improves reasoning accuracy and scalability,\nparticularly for complex multihop questions, indicating its potential to\nadvance LCQA methodologies.",

    "abstract": "Developing a face anti-spoofing model that meets the security requirements of\nclients worldwide is challenging due to the domain gap between training\ndatasets and diverse end-user test data. Moreover, for security and privacy\nreasons, it is undesirable for clients to share a large amount of their face\ndata with service providers. In this work, we introduce a novel method in which\nthe face anti-spoofing model can be adapted by the client itself to a target\ndomain at test time using only a small sample of data while keeping model\nparameters and training data inaccessible to the client. Specifically, we\ndevelop a prototype-based base model and an optimal transport-guided adaptor\nthat enables adaptation in either a lightweight training or training-free\nfashion, without updating base model's parameters. Furthermore, we propose\ngeodesic mixup, an optimal transport-based synthesis method that generates\naugmented training data along the geodesic path between source prototypes and\ntarget data distribution. This allows training a lightweight classifier to\neffectively adapt to target-specific characteristics while retaining essential\nknowledge learned from the source domain. In cross-domain and cross-attack\nsettings, compared with recent methods, our method achieves average relative\nimprovements of 19.17% in HTER and 8.58% in AUC, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Fluorescence microscopy, while being a key driver for progress in the life\nsciences, is also subject to technical limitations. To overcome them,\ncomputational multiplexing techniques have recently been proposed, which allow\nmultiple cellular structures to be captured in a single image and later be\nunmixed. Existing image decomposition methods are trained on a set of\nsuperimposed input images and the respective unmixed target images. It is\ncritical to note that the relative strength (mixing ratio) of the superimposed\nimages for a given input is a priori unknown. However, existing methods are\ntrained on a fixed intensity ratio of superimposed inputs, making them not\ncognizant to the range of relative intensities that can occur in fluorescence\nmicroscopy. In this work, we propose a novel method called indiSplit that is\ncognizant of the severity of the above mentioned mixing ratio. Our idea is\nbased on InDI, a popular iterative method for image restoration, and an ideal\nstarting point to embrace the unknown mixing ratio in any given input. We\nintroduce (i) a suitably trained regressor network that predicts the\ndegradation level (mixing asymmetry) of a given input image and (ii) a\ndegradation-specific normalization module, enabling degradation-aware inference\nacross all mixing ratios. We show that this method solves two relevant tasks in\nfluorescence microscopy, namely image splitting and bleedthrough removal, and\nempirically demonstrate the applicability of indiSplit on $5$ public datasets.\nWe will release all sources under a permissive license.",

    "abstract": "By provisioning inference offloading services, edge inference drives the\nrapid growth of AI applications at the network edge. However, achieving high\ntask throughput with stringent latency requirements remains a significant\nchallenge. To address this issue, we develop a parameter-sharing AI model\nloading (PartialLoading) framework for multi-user edge inference, which\nexploits two key insights: 1) the majority of latency arises from loading AI\nmodels into server GPU memory, and 2) different AI models can share a\nsignificant number of parameters, for which redundant loading should be\navoided. Towards this end, we formulate a joint multi-user scheduling and\nspectrum bandwidth allocation problem to maximize task throughput by exploiting\nshared parameter blocks across models. The intuition is to judiciously schedule\nuser requests to reuse the shared parameter blocks between consecutively loaded\nmodels, thereby reducing model loading time substantially. To facilitate\nsolution finding, we decouple the problem into two sub-problems, i.e., user\nscheduling and bandwidth allocation, showing that solving them sequentially is\nequivalent to solving the original problem. Due to the NP-hardness of the\nproblem, we first study an important special case called the\n\"bottom-layer-sharing\" case, where AI models share some bottom layers within\nclusters, and design a dynamic programming-based algorithm to obtain the\noptimal solution in polynomial time. For the general case, where shared\nparameter blocks appear at arbitrary positions within AI models, we propose a\ngreedy heuristic to obtain the sub-optimal solution efficiently. Simulation\nresults demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves task\nthroughput under deadline constraints compared with user scheduling without\nexploiting parameter sharing.",

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm in machine\nlearning, enabling collaborative model training across decentralized devices\nwithout the need for raw data sharing. In FL, a global model is trained\niteratively on local datasets residing on individual devices, each contributing\nto the model's improvement. However, the heterogeneous nature of these local\ndatasets, stemming from diverse user behaviours, device capabilities, and data\ndistributions, poses a significant challenge. The inherent heterogeneity in\nfederated learning gives rise to various issues, including model performance\ndiscrepancies, convergence challenges, and potential privacy concerns. As the\nglobal model progresses through rounds of training, the disparities in local\ndata quality and quantity can impede the overall effectiveness of federated\nlearning systems. Moreover, maintaining fairness and privacy across diverse\nuser groups becomes a paramount concern. To address this issue, this paper\nintroduces a novel FL framework, ClusterGuardFL, that employs dissimilarity\nscores, k-means clustering, and reconciliation confidence scores to dynamically\nassign weights to client updates. The dissimilarity scores between global and\nlocal models guide the formation of clusters, with cluster size influencing the\nweight allocation. Within each cluster, a reconciliation confidence score is\ncalculated for individual data points, and a softmax layer generates customized\nweights for clients. These weights are utilized in the aggregation process,\nenhancing the model's robustness and privacy.

The commonly used RPMD treatment of gas-phase\nbimolecular reactions adopts two dividing surfaces, one at the transition state\nand another in the reactant asymptote, where partition functions of separated\nreactants can be readily obtained. With some exceptions, however, this strategy\nis difficult to implement for processes on surfaces or in liquids, because the\nreactants are often strongly coupled with the extended medium (surface or\nsolvent) and thus non-separable.

However, making timely adaptive dosing decisions is challenging due to\nthe rapid patient accrual rate and the late-onset toxicity and/or efficacy\noutcomes associated with these therapies. The Simple Toxicity and Efficacy\nInterval (STEIN) design has demonstrated strong performance in accommodating\ndiverse dose-efficacy patterns and incorporating both toxicity and efficacy\noutcomes to select the OBD. However, the rapid accrual of patients and the\noften-delayed onset of toxicity and/or efficacy pose challenges to timely\nadaptive dose decisions. To address these challenges, we propose TITE-STEIN, a\nmodel-assisted design that incorporates time-to-event (TITE) outcomes for\ntoxicity and/or efficacy, by extending STEIN. In this article, we demonstrate\nthat TITE-STEIN significantly shortens trial duration compared to STEIN.\nFurthermore, by integrating an OBD verification procedure during OBD selection,\nTITE-STEIN effectively mitigates the risk of exposing patients to inadmissible\ndoses when the OBD does not exist. Extensive simulations demonstrate that\nTITE-STEIN outperforms existing TITE designs, including TITE-BONI12,\nTITE-BOIN-ET, LO-TC, and Joint TITE-CRM, by selecting the OBD more accurately,\nallocating more patients to it, and improving overdose control.",

To address this issue, a high-order\nstochastic-statistical modeling framework is proposed that integrates\nstatistical data assimilation into finite ensemble predictions. The method\neffectively reduces the approximation errors in finite ensemble estimates of\nnon-Gaussian distributions by employing a filtering update step that\nincorporates observation data in leading moments to refine the high-order\nstatistical feedback.

However, the presence of substantial\nnoisy events, lack of stable, persistent semantic information, and large data\nvolume pose challenges for event-based data processing on resource-constrained\nmobile devices. This paper surveys the literature from 2014 to 2025 and\npresents a comprehensive overview of event-based mobile sensing, encompassing\nits fundamental principles, event \\textit{abstraction} methods,\n\\textit{algorithm} advancements, and both hardware and software\n\\textit{acceleration} strategies. We discuss key \\textit{applications} of event\ncameras in mobile sensing, including visual odometry, object tracking, optical\nflow, and 3D reconstruction, while highlighting challenges associated with\nevent data processing, sensor fusion, and real-time deployment. Furthermore, we\noutline future research directions, such as improving the event camera with\nadvanced optics, leveraging neuromorphic computing for efficient processing,\nand integrating bio-inspired algorithms. To support ongoing research, we\nprovide an open-source \\textit{Online Sheet} with recent developments. We hope\nthis survey serves as a reference, facilitating the adoption of event-based\nvision across diverse applications.",

Traditional navigation methods focus on optimal trajectory\ngeneration within free space, struggling in environments lacking viable paths\nto the goal, such as disaster zones or cluttered warehouses. To address this\ngap, we propose an adaptive interactive navigation approach that proactively\ninteracts with environments to create feasible paths to reach originally\nunavailable goals. Specifically, we present a primitive tree for task planning\nwith large language models (LLMs), facilitating effective reasoning to\ndetermine interaction objects and sequences. To ensure robust subtask\nexecution, we adopt reinforcement learning to pre-train a comprehensive skill\nlibrary containing versatile locomotion and interaction behaviors for motion\nplanning. Furthermore, we introduce an adaptive replanning method featuring two\nLLM-based modules: an advisor serving as a flexible replanning trigger and an\narborist for autonomous plan adjustment. Integrated with the tree structure,\nthe replanning mechanism allows for convenient node addition and pruning,\nenabling rapid plan modification in unknown environments.

To ensure real-time performance,\nfrequency-enhanced LIO systems must process each sweep within significantly\nreduced timeframe, which presents substantial challenges for deployment on\nlow-computational-power platforms. To address these limitations, we introduce\nSR-LIO++, an innovative LIO system capable of achieving doubled output\nfrequency relative to input frequency on resource-constrained hardware\nplatforms, including the Raspberry Pi 4B. Our system employs a sweep\nreconstruction methodology to enhance LiDAR sweep frequency, generating\nhigh-frequency reconstructed sweeps. Building upon this foundation, we propose\na caching mechanism for intermediate results (i.e., surface parameters) of the\nmost recent segments, effectively minimizing redundant processing of common\nsegments in adjacent reconstructed sweeps. This method decouples processing\ntime from the traditionally linear dependence on reconstructed sweep frequency.\nFurthermore, we present a quantized map point management based on index table\nmapping, significantly reducing memory usage by converting global 3D point\nstorage from 64-bit double precision to 8-bit char representation. This method\nalso converts the computationally intensive Euclidean distance calculations in\nnearest neighbor searches from 64-bit double precision to 16-bit short and\n32-bit integer formats, significantly reducing both memory and computational\ncost. Extensive experimental evaluations across three distinct computing\nplatforms and four public datasets demonstrate that SR-LIO++ maintains\nstate-of-the-art accuracy while substantially enhancing efficiency.

Inspection points are then optimized\nusing the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) to create efficient task sequences.\nIn the autonomous phase, the quadrotor autonomously executes the planned tasks,\nensuring safe and efficient data acquisition. Comprehensive field experiments\nconducted in various environments, including slopes, landslides, agricultural\nfields, factories, and forests, confirm the system's reliability and\nflexibility.
