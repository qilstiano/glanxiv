Measurements of charge balance functions for\ninclusive and identified particle pairs are reported as a function of charged\nparticle multiplicity in proton--proton collisions simulated with the PYTHIA8\nand the EPOS4 models. The charge balance functions of inclusive, pion, kaon,\nand proton pairs exhibit amplitudes and shapes that depend on particle species\nand differ significantly in the two models due to the different particle\nproduction mechanisms implemented in PYTHIA and EPOS. The shapes and amplitudes\nalso evolve with multiplicity in both models.

The inherent complexity of deep learning models,\nwhile contributing to their effectiveness, also renders them susceptible to\nadversarial attacks. Among these, backdoor attacks are especially concerning,\nas they involve surreptitiously embedding specific triggers within training\ndata, causing the model to exhibit aberrant behavior when presented with input\ncontaining the triggers. Such attacks often exploit vulnerabilities in\noutsourced processes, compromising model integrity without affecting\nperformance on clean (trigger-free) input data. In this paper, we present a\ncomprehensive review of existing mitigation strategies designed to counter\nbackdoor attacks in image recognition. We provide an in-depth analysis of the\ntheoretical foundations, practical efficacy, and limitations of these\napproaches. In addition, we conduct an extensive benchmarking of sixteen\nstate-of-the-art approaches against eight distinct backdoor attacks, utilizing\nthree datasets, four model architectures, and three poisoning ratios. Our\nresults, derived from 122,236 individual experiments, indicate that while many\napproaches provide some level of protection, their performance can vary\nconsiderably. Furthermore, when compared to two seminal approaches, most newer\napproaches do not demonstrate substantial improvements in overall performance\nor consistency across diverse settings.

    "abstract": "Splenomegaly, the enlargement of the spleen, is an important clinical\nindicator for various associated medical conditions, such as sickle cell\ndisease (SCD). Spleen length measured from 2D ultrasound is the most widely\nused metric for characterising spleen size. However, it is still considered a\nsurrogate measure, and spleen volume remains the gold standard for assessing\nspleen size. Accurate spleen volume measurement typically requires 3D imaging\nmodalities, such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, but\nthese are not widely available, especially in the Global South which has a high\nprevalence of SCD. In this work, we introduce a deep learning pipeline,\nDeepSPV, for precise spleen volume estimation from single or dual 2D ultrasound\nimages. The pipeline involves a segmentation network and a variational\nautoencoder for learning low-dimensional representations from the estimated\nsegmentations. We investigate three approaches for spleen volume estimation and\nour best model achieves 86.62%/92.5% mean relative volume accuracy (MRVA) under\nsingle-view/dual-view settings, surpassing the performance of human experts. In\naddition, the pipeline can provide confidence intervals for the volume\nestimates as well as offering benefits in terms of interpretability, which\nfurther support clinicians in decision-making when identifying splenomegaly. We\nevaluate the full pipeline using a highly realistic synthetic dataset generated\nby a diffusion model, achieving an overall MRVA of 83.0% from a single 2D\nultrasound image. Our proposed DeepSPV is the first work to use deep learning\nto estimate 3D spleen volume from 2D ultrasound images and can be seamlessly\nintegrated into the current clinical workflow for spleen assessment.",

These agents are well suited to control grid actions since the\naction space is constantly growing due to uncertainties in renewable\ngeneration, microgrid integration, and cybersecurity threats. To assess the\nefficacy of RL agents in response to an adverse grid event, we use the Grid2Op\nplatform for agent training. We employ a proximal policy optimization (PPO)\nalgorithm in conjunction with graph neural networks (GNNs). By simulating\nagents' responses to grid events, we assess their performance in avoiding grid\nfailure for as long as possible. The performance of an agent is expressed\nconcisely through its reward function, which helps the agent learn the most\noptimal ways to reconfigure a grid's topology amidst certain events. To model\nmulti-actor scenarios that threaten modern power networks, particularly those\nresulting from cyberattacks, we integrate an opponent that acts iteratively\nagainst a given agent. This interplay between the RL agent and opponent is\nutilized in N-k contingency screening, providing a novel alternative to the\ntraditional security assessment.",

In low lunar orbit, the detector FoV will look at the Moon\nsurface. The IRADCAL detectors consist of several layers, from top to down: a\nMulti-Layer Insulator (MLI); a thin plastic scintillator (S1) seen by four\nSilicon Photomultipliers (SIPMs), placed to form a cross on light guide\nsurrounding the scintillator (S1); a 26x26x70 mm3 CsI(Tl) crystal scintillator\n(S2) and a thin crystal scintillator seen by four SIPMs (S3). The detector is\ndesigned to measure contained proton energy spectrum from 400 keV to 150 MeV,\nelectron from 50 keV to 10 MeV and heavy ions (up to the CNO group) with\nenergies up to 20 MeV/n. IRADCAL will provide two dE/dX values from two thin\nscintillators, Etot or dE/dX from thick scintillator, and dE/E ratios for\nparticle identification. A multi-layer perceptron is being developed by using\ndeep neural network algorithm to estimate the Depth of Interaction (DoI). S1\nprovides level 1 trigger and hit position, which, combined with DoI point, will\nhelp determine if a particle is escaping from the sides and to separate\nup/down-going particles.

    "abstract": "This paper builds upon our previous work on the Reconciled Polynomial Network\n(RPN). The original RPN model was designed under the assumption of input data\nindependence, presuming the independence among both individual instances within\ndata batches and attributes in each data instance. However, this assumption\noften proves invalid for function learning tasks involving complex,\ninterdependent data such as language, images, time series, and graphs. Ignoring\nsuch data interdependence may inevitably lead to significant performance\ndegradation.\n  To overcome these limitations, we introduce the new Reconciled Polynomial\nNetwork (version 2), namely RPN 2, in this paper. By incorporating data and\nstructural interdependence functions, RPN 2 explicitly models data\ninterdependence via new component functions in its architecture.\n  This enhancement not only significantly improves RPN 2's learning performance\nbut also substantially expands its unifying potential, enabling it to encompass\na broader range of contemporary dominant backbone models within its canonical\nrepresentation. These backbones include, but are not limited to, convolutional\nneural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), graph neural networks\n(GNNs), and Transformers. Our analysis reveals that the fundamental\ndistinctions among these backbone models primarily stem from their diverse\napproaches to defining the interdependence functions.

We keep the\nReynolds number, defined based on the cylinder diameter, at 100 and consider\nfive different configurations for the initial positions of the cluster\ncylinders: linear, rectangular, V-shaped, triangular, and circular. In each\nconfiguration, we consider progressively increasing number of cylinders in the\ncluster. We show that overall, the cylinders tend to form final linear\nconfigurations, in which, after their transition, the cylinders form one or\nmore lines. Some free-to-move cylinders might take the lead position in some of\nthese linear formations depending on the initial configuration. These\nsteady-state positions are achieved when the mean value of lift that acts on\nthe cylinders becomes negligible. As a byproduct of these reconfigurations, the\noverall drag force that acts on the collection of cylinders reduces at their\nfinal steady-state locations in comparison with their original configurations.\nThe complicated wakes that are observed in the fixed counterparts of these\nconfigurations are replaced by a series of vortex rows in the wake of separate\nlines of cylinders. Reducing the mass ratio allows the cylinders to oscillate\nabout their mean displacement paths, but their transient paths and their final\nsteady-state positions are not affected significantly by the decrease in the\nmass ratio.",

The approach\nleverages the physical correlation between increasing $M_s$ and the\nshock-induced small-scale fluctuations that alter the morphological features in\nintensity, velocity centroid, and velocity channel maps.

The median uncertainty of the CNN-predicted $M_s$ ranges\nfrom 0.5 to 1.5 depending on the noise level.

We extend our study of\nincompatibility in the prepare and measure scenario, focusing on quantum random\naccess codes (QRACs). Surprisingly, we show that the monotonicity of average\nsuccess probability with measurement incompatibility does not hold for higher\ndimensions, as opposed to two dimensions, even though the maximum probability\nof QRAC behaves monotonically with incompatibility.",

In this paper, we present a person segmentation and action\nclassification approach that operates on 3D scans of hemisphere field of view\nLiDAR sensors. We recorded a data set with an Ouster OSDome-64 sensor\nconsisting of scenes where persons perform three different actions and\nannotated it. We propose a method based on a MaskDINO model to detect and\nsegment persons and to recognize their actions from combined spherical\nprojected multi-channel representations of the LiDAR data with an additional\npositional encoding.

In this article, we\nmeticulously analyze the current state of VQA datasets and models, while\ncleanly dividing them into distinct categories and then summarizing the\nmethodologies and characteristics of each category. We divide VQA datasets into\nfour categories: (1) available datasets that contain a rich collection of\nauthentic images, (2) synthetic datasets that contain only synthetic images\nproduced through artificial means, (3) diagnostic datasets that are specially\ndesigned to test model performance in a particular area, e.g., understanding\nthe scene text, and (4) KB (Knowledge-Based) datasets that are designed to\nmeasure a model's ability to utilize outside knowledge. Concurrently, we\nexplore six main paradigms of VQA models: fusion, where we discuss different\nmethods of fusing information between visual and textual modalities; attention,\nthe technique of using information from one modality to filter information from\nanother; external knowledge base, where we discuss different models utilizing\noutside information; composition or reasoning, where we analyze techniques to\nanswer advanced questions that require complex reasoning steps; explanation,\nwhich is the process of generating visual and textual descriptions to verify\nsound reasoning; and graph models, which encode and manipulate relationships\nthrough nodes in a graph.

In the context of mineral site records, accurate\nrecord linkage is crucial for identifying and mapping mineral deposits.\nProperly linking records that refer to the same mineral deposit helps define\nthe spatial coverage of mineral areas, benefiting resource identification and\nsite data archiving. Mineral site record linkage falls under the spatial record\nlinkage category since the records contain information about the physical\nlocations and non-spatial attributes in a tabular format. The task is\nparticularly challenging due to the heterogeneity and vast scale of the data.\nWhile prior research employs pre-trained discriminative language models (PLMs)\non spatial entity linkage, they often require substantial amounts of curated\nground-truth data for fine-tuning. Gathering and creating ground truth data is\nboth time-consuming and costly. Therefore, such approaches are not always\nfeasible in real-world scenarios where gold-standard data are unavailable.\nAlthough large generative language models (LLMs) have shown promising results\nin various natural language processing tasks, including record linkage, their\nhigh inference time and resource demand present challenges.

However, in realistic scenarios, it is difficult for\nthe adversary to obtain enough qualified samples that mark accurate identity\ninformation, especially since most samples are non-members in real world\napplications. To address this limitation, in this paper, we propose a new\nattack method called CLMIA, which uses unsupervised contrastive learning to\ntrain an attack model without using extra membership status information.\nMeanwhile, in CLMIA, we require only a small amount of data with known\nmembership status to fine-tune the attack model. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that CLMIA performs better than existing attack methods for\ndifferent datasets and model structures, especially with data with less marked\nidentity information. In addition, we experimentally find that the attack\nperforms differently for different proportions of labeled identity information\nfor member and non-member data.

In our model, we address a notable\ndiscrepancy that arose from the previous model where they did not consider the\nvolume of QDs within the intrinsic region, leading to an overestimation of the\nphotocarrier generation rate. Our present model rectifies this by incorporating\nthe volume of quantum dots, resulting in adjustments to the photocarrier\ngeneration rate. Additionally, we determine the absorption coefficient of the\nQDs based on Mie theory for different diameter sizes considering the constant\nvolume fraction of the total number of QDs in the intrinsic region. We observe\nin our analysis that the absorption spectra of the QDs and host material may\noverlap in certain cases, although the previous model assumed no overlap. This\nfinding suggests the need for caution when evaluating spectral overlap: if the\nspectra do not overlap, both the previous and current modified models can be\nreliably applied. However, in cases of overlap, careful consideration is\nrequired to ensure accurate predictions of photocarrier generation.\nFurthermore, investigating the effect of QD diameter size on the photocarrier\ngeneration rate in the intrinsic region, we find that smaller QD sizes result\nin a higher absorption coefficient as well as a higher generation rate for a\nconstant volume of QDs in the region. Moreover, we establish the optimization\nof the QDs array size by varying the size and the total volume of QDs to\nimprove the generation rate. Our analysis reveals that a higher volume of QDs\nand a smaller size of QDs result in the maximum generation rate. From an\nexperimental perspective, we propose that the optimal arrangement of QDs in\nsuch solar cells is a 0.5 volume fraction with a QD diameter of 2 nm.",

    "abstract": "This paper explores how automation and artificial intelligence (AI) are\ntransforming U.S. cyber diplomacy. Leveraging these technologies helps the U.S.\nmanage the complexity and urgency of cyber diplomacy, improving\ndecision-making, efficiency, and security. As global inter connectivity grows,\ncyber diplomacy, managing national interests in the digital space has become\nvital. The ability of AI and automation to quickly process vast data volumes\nenables timely responses to cyber threats and opportunities. This paper\nunderscores the strategic integration of these tools to maintain U.S.\ncompetitive advantage and secure national interests. Automation enhances\ndiplomatic communication and data processing, freeing diplomats to focus on\nstrategic decisions. AI supports predictive analytics and real time decision\nmaking, offering critical insights and proactive measures during high stakes\nengagements. Case studies show AIs effectiveness in monitoring cyber activities\nand managing international cyber policy. Challenges such as ethical concerns,\nsecurity vulnerabilities, and reliance on technology are also addressed,\nemphasizing human oversight and strong governance frameworks. Ensuring proper\nethical guidelines and cybersecurity measures allows the U.S. to harness the\nbenefits of automation and AI while mitigating risks. By adopting these\ntechnologies, U.S. cyber diplomacy can become more proactive and effective,\nnavigating the evolving digital landscape with greater agility.",

    "abstract": "In the last decade, crowdsourcing has become a popular method for conducting\nquantitative empirical studies in human-machine interaction. The remote work on\na given task in crowdworking settings suits the character of typical\nspeech/language-based interactive systems for instance with regard to\nargumentative conversations and information retrieval. Thus, crowdworking\npromises a valuable opportunity to study and evaluate the usability and user\nexperience of real humans in interactions with such interactive systems. In\ncontrast to physical attendance in laboratory studies, crowdsourcing studies\noffer much more flexible and easier access to large numbers of heterogeneous\nparticipants with a specific background, e.g., native speakers or domain\nexpertise. On the other hand, the experimental and environmental conditions as\nwell as the participant's compliance and reliability (at least better\nmonitoring of the latter) are much better controllable in a laboratory.\n  This paper seeks to present a (self-)critical examination of\ncrowdsourcing-based studies in the context of complex (spoken) dialogue\nsystems. It describes and discusses observed issues in crowdsourcing studies\ninvolving complex tasks and suggests solutions to improve and ensure the\nquality of the study results.

Both PPO and ACER are used\nwithin the same experimental setup to assess their performance in a scenario of\nlatency-sensitive and latency-tolerant users and compare them. The aim is to\nverify the efficacy of on-policy and off-policy DRL models in the context of\nO-RAN resource allocation.

    "abstract": "The interval count problem, a classical question in the study of interval\norders, was introduced by Ronald Graham in the 1980s. This problem asks: given\nan interval order $P$, what is the minimum number of distinct interval lengths\nrequired to construct an interval representation of $P$? Interval orders that\ncan be represented with just one interval length are known as semiorders, and\ntheir characterizations are well known. However, the characterization of\ninterval orders that require at most $k$ interval lengths -- termed $k$-count\ninterval orders -- remains an open and challenging problem for $k\\geq 2$.\n  Our investigation into $2$-count interval orders led us naturally to consider\na related problem, interval representations of permutations, which we introduce\nin this paper. Specifically, we characterize permutations that have a $2$-count\ninterval representation. We prove that a permutation admits a $2$-count\ninterval representation if and only if its longest decreasing subsequences have\nlength at most $2$. For larger values of $k$, however, a similar\ncharacterization does not hold. There are permutations that do not permit a\n$3$-count interval representation despite having decreasing subsequences of\nlength at most $3$. Characterizing $k$-count permutations remains open for $k\n\\geq 3$.\n  The $k$-count permutation representation problem appears to capture essential\naspects of the broader problem of characterizing $k$-count interval orders. To\nsupport this connection, we apply our findings on interval representations of\npermutations to demonstrate that a height-$3$ interval order is $2$-count if\nand only if it has depth at most $2$, where the depth of an interval order\nrefers to the length of the longest nested chain of intervals required in any\ninterval representation of the order.",

However, due\nto the lengthy nature of ECG recordings, numerous machine learning methods have\nbeen developed for automated heart disease detection to reduce human workload.\nDespite these efforts, performance remains suboptimal. A key obstacle is the\ninherent complexity of ECG data, which includes heterogeneity (e.g., varying\nsampling rates), high levels of noise, demographic-related pattern shifts, and\nintricate rhythm-event associations. To overcome these challenges, this paper\nintroduces AnyECG, a foundational model designed to extract robust\nrepresentations from any real-world ECG data. Specifically, a tailored ECG\nTokenizer encodes each fixed-duration ECG fragment into a token and, guided by\nproxy tasks, converts noisy, continuous ECG features into discrete, compact,\nand clinically meaningful local rhythm codes. These codes encapsulate basic\nmorphological, frequency, and demographic information (e.g., sex), effectively\nmitigating signal noise. We further pre-train the AnyECG to learn rhythmic\npattern associations across ECG tokens, enabling the capture of cardiac event\nsemantics. By being jointly pre-trained on diverse ECG data sources, AnyECG is\ncapable of generalizing across a wide range of downstream tasks where ECG\nsignals are recorded from various devices and scenarios. The experimental\nresults show that AnyECG achieves an average performance improvement of 6%\nacross four critical tasks-anomaly detection, arrhythmia classification,\ncorrupted lead generation, and ultra-long ECG recognition. AnyECG learns common\nECG rhythm from data and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in\neach of these tasks.",

We then point out that, while dynamically there exists a\nnet equivalence between the Jordan and Einstein frames, the number of particles\nappears quite different passing from a representation to another one, thus\npointing out the existence of a possible \\emph{quantum frame issue}. In\nsummary, while the classical inflationary dynamics is equivalently described in\nthe Jordan and Einstein frames, a viable physical description of particle\nproduction valid in both the frames may be hindered by the absence of a\ncomplete quantum gravity.

Cognitive tests can be quickly administered and are predictive\nof forecasting performance, but it is unclear which and how many tests are\noptimal. In this study, we develop adaptive cognitive tests that optimize the\nselection and efficiency of cognitive tests to assess forecasters of different\nskill levels. The tests are based on item response models and the adaptive\ntesting procedures commonly used in educational testing. We show how the\nprocedures can select highly informative cognitive tests from a larger battery\nof tests, thereby reducing the time taken to administer the tests. We use a\nsecond, independent dataset to show that the selected tests yield scores that\nare highly related to out-of-sample forecasting performance. The approach\nenables real-time, adaptive testing, providing immediate insights into\nforecasting talent in practical contexts.",

An\nedge-coloring is a parity edge-coloring if for each path $P$ in $G$, it uses\nsome color on an odd number of edges in $P$. It is a strong parity\nedge-coloring if for every open walk $W$ in $G$, it uses some color an odd\nnumber of times along $W$. The minimum numbers of colors in parity and strong\nparity edge-colorings of $G$ are denoted $p(G)$ and $\\hat{p}(G)$, respectively.\n  We characterize strong parity edge-colorings and use this characterization to\nprove lower bounds on $\\hat{p}(G)$ and answer several questions of Bunde,\nMilans, West, and Wu. The applications are as follows. (1) We prove the\nconjecture that $\\hat{p}(K_{s,t})=s \\circ t$, where $s \\circ t$ is the\nHopf-Stiefel function. (2) We show that $\\hat{p}(G)$ for a connected $n$-vertex\ngraph $G$ equals the known lower bound $\\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil$ if and only if\n$G$ is a subgraph of the hypercube $Q_{\\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil }$.

While some approaches address these limitations by generating\nexcessive trajectory candidates, they necessitate a post-processing stage to\nidentify the most representative modes, a process lacking universal principles\nand compromising trajectory accuracy. We are thus motivated to introduce\nModeSeq, a new multimodal prediction paradigm that models modes as sequences.\nUnlike the common practice of decoding multiple plausible trajectories in one\nshot, ModeSeq requires motion decoders to infer the next mode step by step,\nthereby more explicitly capturing the correlation between modes and\nsignificantly enhancing the ability to reason about multimodality. Leveraging\nthe inductive bias of sequential mode prediction, we also propose the\nEarly-Match-Take-All (EMTA) training strategy to diversify the trajectories\nfurther. Without relying on dense mode prediction or heuristic post-processing,\nModeSeq considerably improves the diversity of multimodal output while\nattaining satisfactory trajectory accuracy, resulting in balanced performance\non motion prediction benchmarks. Moreover, ModeSeq naturally emerges with the\ncapability of mode extrapolation, which supports forecasting more behavior\nmodes when the future is highly uncertain.",

Although jailbreak attacks are prevalent, the understanding of their\nunderlying mechanisms remains limited. Recent studies have explained typical\njailbreaking behavior (e.g., the degree to which the model refuses to respond)\nof LLMs by analyzing representation shifts in their latent space caused by\njailbreak prompts or identifying key neurons that contribute to the success of\njailbreak attacks. However, these studies neither explore diverse jailbreak\npatterns nor provide a fine-grained explanation from the failure of circuit to\nthe changes of representational, leaving significant gaps in uncovering the\njailbreak mechanism. In this paper, we propose JailbreakLens, an interpretation\nframework that analyzes jailbreak mechanisms from both representation (which\nreveals how jailbreaks alter the model's harmfulness perception) and circuit\nperspectives~(which uncovers the causes of these deceptions by identifying key\ncircuits contributing to the vulnerability), tracking their evolution\nthroughout the entire response generation process. We then conduct an in-depth\nevaluation of jailbreak behavior on five mainstream LLMs under seven jailbreak\nstrategies. Our evaluation reveals that jailbreak prompts amplify components\nthat reinforce affirmative responses while suppressing those that produce\nrefusal. This manipulation shifts model representations toward safe clusters to\ndeceive the LLM, leading it to provide detailed responses instead of refusals.\nNotably, we find a strong and consistent correlation between representation\ndeception and activation shift of key circuits across diverse jailbreak methods\nand multiple LLMs.",

Alternatively, multi-task\narchitectures with shared encoders and multiple segmentation heads or shared\nweights with compound labels can also be made use of. This work proposes a\nnovel label sharing framework where a shared common label space is constructed\nand each of the individual label sets are systematically mapped to the common\nlabels. This transforms multiple datasets with disparate label sets into a\nsingle large dataset with shared labels, and therefore all the segmentation\ntasks can be addressed by learning a single model. This eliminates the need for\ntask specific adaptations in network architectures and also results in\nparameter and data efficient models. Furthermore, label sharing framework is\nnaturally amenable for incremental learning where segmentations for new\ndatasets can be easily learnt. We experimentally validate our method on various\nmedical image segmentation datasets, each involving multi-label segmentation.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in terms of\nperformance and incremental learning ability vis-a-vis alternative methods.",

In addition to pseudotransitions for the\n``pure'' system, similar to those observed in other one-dimensional spin\nmodels, this study also reveals the presence of ``second-order''\npseudotransitions for the dilute case. We show that the nature of these\ndiscovered pseudotransitions is associated with the phase separation in the\nchain into regions of (anti)ferromagnetic and charge-ordered phases.

To achieve this, TSOs have created several products called\nfrequency-supporting ancillary services. The Frequency Containment Reserve\n(FCR) is one of these ancillary service products. This article focuses on the\nTSO problem of determining the volume procured for FCR. Specifically, we\ninvestigate the potential benefits and impact on grid security when\ntransitioning from a traditionally \\textit{static} procurement method to a\n\\textit{dynamic} strategy for FCR volume. We take the Nordic synchronous area\nin Europe as a case study and use a diffusion model to capture its frequency\ndevelopment. We introduce a controlled mean reversal parameter to assess\nchanges in FCR obligations, in particular for the Nordic FCR-N ancillary\nservice product. We establish closed-form expressions for exceedance\nprobabilities and use historical frequency data as input to calibrate the\nmodel. We show that a dynamic dimensioning approach for FCR has the potential\nto significantly reduce the exceedance probabilities (up to $37\\%$) while\nmaintaining the total yearly procured FCR volume equal to that of the current\nstatic approach.

    "abstract": "The demand for deploying deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) on\nresource-constrained devices for real-time applications remains substantial.\nHowever, existing state-of-the-art structured pruning methods often involve\nintricate implementations, require modifications to the original network\narchitectures, and necessitate an extensive fine-tuning phase. To overcome\nthese challenges, we propose a novel method that, for the first time,\nincorporates the concepts of charge and electrostatic force from physics into\nthe training process of DCNNs. The magnitude of this force is directly\nproportional to the product of the charges of the convolution filter and the\nsource filter, and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between\nthem. We applied this electrostatic-like force to the convolution filters,\neither attracting filters with opposite charges toward non-zero weights or\nrepelling filters with like charges toward zero weights. Consequently, filters\nsubject to repulsive forces have their weights reduced to zero, enabling their\nremoval, while the attractive forces preserve filters with significant weights\nthat retain information. Unlike conventional methods, our approach is\nstraightforward to implement, does not require any architectural modifications,\nand simultaneously optimizes weights and ranks filter importance, all without\nthe need for extensive fine-tuning. We validated the efficacy of our method on\nmodern DCNN architectures using the MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet datasets,\nachieving competitive performance compared to existing structured pruning\napproaches.",

Recently, several\nstudies have demonstrated the great potential of subspace clustering models for\npartitioning vertices in attributed graphs, referred to as SCAG. However, these\nworks either demand significant computational overhead for constructing the nxn\nself-expressive matrix, or fail to incorporate graph topology and attribute\ndata into the subspace clustering framework effectively, and thus, compromise\nresult quality.\n  Motivated by this, this paper presents two effective and efficient\nalgorithms, S2CAG and M-S2CAG, for SCAG computation. Particularly, S2CAG\nobtains superb performance through three major contributions. First, we\nformulate a new objective function for SCAG with a refined representation model\nfor vertices and two non-trivial constraints. On top of that, an efficient\nlinear-time optimization solver is developed based on our theoretically\ngrounded problem transformation and well-thought-out adaptive strategy. We then\nconduct an in-depth analysis to disclose the theoretical connection of S2CAG to\nconductance minimization, which further inspires the design of M-S2CAG that\nmaximizes the modularity. Our extensive experiments, comparing S2CAG and\nM-S2CAG against 17 competitors over 8 benchmark datasets, exhibit that our\nsolutions outperform all baselines in terms of clustering quality measured\nagainst the ground truth while delivering high efficiency",

Although Chile's Atacama Desert is considered\nthe sunniest place on Earth, PV power production, even in this area, can be\nhighly volatile. Successful integration of PV energy into the country's power\ngrid requires accurate short-term PV power forecasts, which can be obtained\nfrom predictions of solar irradiance and related weather quantities. Nowadays,\nin weather forecasting, the state-of-the-art approach is the use of ensemble\nforecasts based on multiple runs of numerical weather prediction models.\nHowever, ensemble forecasts still tend to be uncalibrated or biased, thus\nrequiring some form of post-processing. The present work investigates\nprobabilistic forecasts of solar irradiance for Regions III and IV in Chile.\nFor this reason, 8-member short-term ensemble forecasts of solar irradiance for\ncalendar year 2021 are generated using the Weather Research and Forecasting\n(WRF) model, which are then calibrated using the benchmark ensemble model\noutput statistics (EMOS) method based on a censored Gaussian law, and its\nmachine learning-based distributional regression network (DRN) counterpart.\nFurthermore, we also propose a neural network-based post-processing method\nresulting in improved 8-member ensemble predictions. All forecasts are\nevaluated against station observations for 30 locations, and the skill of\npost-processed predictions is compared to the raw WRF ensemble. Our case study\nconfirms that all studied post-processing methods substantially improve both\nthe calibration of probabilistic- and the accuracy of point forecasts. Among\nthe methods tested, the corrected ensemble exhibits the best overall\nperformance. Additionally, the DRN model generally outperforms the\ncorresponding EMOS approach.",

These tend to\nappear along network lanes, and most do not reach coronal temperatures. We\nisolated two hot (around 1 MK) events and one cool (order of 0.1 MK) event and\nexamined the magnetic field evolution in and around these selected events.\nFurthermore, we investigated why some explosive events reach coronal\ntemperatures while most remain cool. The field lines around two events\nreconnect at small angles, i.e., they undergo component reconnection. The third\ncase is associated with the relaxation of a highly twisted flux rope. All of\nthe three events reveal signatures in the synthesized EUI 174 {\\AA} images. The\nintensity variations in two events are dominated by variations of the coronal\nemissions, while the cool component seen in the respective channel contributes\nsignificantly to the intensity variation in one case. Comparing to the cool\nevent, one hot event is embedded in regions with higher magnetic field strength\nand heating rates while the densities are comparable, and the other hot event\nis heated to coronal temperatures mainly because of the low density.\nSmall-scale heating events seen in EUV channels of AIA or EUI might be hot or\ncool.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great\nsuccess in understanding multi-modal contents. For video understanding tasks,\ntraining-based video LLMs are difficult to build due to the scarcity of\nhigh-quality, curated video-text paired data. In contrast, paired image-text\ndata are much easier to obtain, and there is substantial similarity between\nimages and videos. Consequently, extending image LLMs for video understanding\ntasks presents an appealing alternative. Developing effective strategies for\ncompressing visual tokens from multiple frames is a promising way to leverage\nthe powerful pre-trained image LLM. In this work, we explore the limitations of\nthe existing compression strategies for building a training-free video LLM. The\nfindings lead to our method TS-LLaVA, which constructs visual tokens through a\nThumbnail-and-Sampling strategy. Given a video, we select few equidistant\nframes from all input frames to construct a Thumbnail image as a detailed\nvisual cue, complemented by Sampled visual tokens from all input frames. Our\nmethod establishes the new state-of-the-art performance among training-free\nvideo LLMs on various benchmarks. Notably, our 34B model outperforms GPT-4V on\nthe MVBench benchmark, and achieves performance comparable to the 72B\ntraining-based video LLM, Video-LLaMA2, on the challenging MLVU benchmark.

However, manipulation by optical\ntweezers is challenged by adsorption forces, including van der Waals forces,\ncapillary forces, and electrostatic forces, which are present between micro-\nand nano-objects. Due to the inherent limitations of optical forces imposed by\nlaser power, these adsorption forces are difficult to overcome. Inspired by\nmaglev trains, we propose a multiphysics coupling method that combines\ndielectrophoretic and optical gradient forces to achieve broad applicability\nand low-damage micro-nanoscale particle manipulation. We developed a device\nthat introduces electric fields to detach objects from hard substrates using\nalternating current (AC) dielectric levitation before manipulation with optical\ntweezers. We utilized micron-sized polystyrene (PS) microspheres as objects and\nelucidated the levitation mechanism through finite element simulation. For\nlarger particles, such as a 100 {\\mu}m PS microparticle and a 200 {\\mu}m\nmicro-gear, AC dielectric levitation enabled manipulation by optical tweezers.\nAlso, the better viability of three kinds of cells displayed the low bio-damage\nof the proposed method.

However, this reprogrammability also introduces\nsignificant security challenges, as bitstream manipulation can directly alter\nhardware circuits. Malicious manipulations may lead to leakage of secret data\nand the implementation of hardware Trojans. In this paper, we present a\ncomprehensive framework for manipulating bitstreams with minimal reverse\nengineering, thereby exposing the potential risks associated with inadequate\nbitstream protection. Our methodology does not require a complete understanding\nof proprietary bitstream formats or a fully reverse-engineered target design.\nInstead, it enables precise modifications by inserting pre-synthesized circuits\ninto existing bitstreams. This novel approach is demonstrated through a\nsemi-automated framework consisting of five steps: (1) partial bitstream\nreverse engineering, (2) designing the modification, (3) placing and (4)\nrouting the modification into the existing circuit, and (5) merging of the\nmodification with the original bitstream. We validate our framework through\nfour practical case studies on the OpenTitan design synthesized for Xilinx\n7-Series FPGAs.

SLS poses unique challenges due to its blend of cooperative and\nadversarial dynamics, making it an ideal platform for studying multi-agent\nlearning and game theory. The study's primary goal is to teach autonomous\nagents the game's rules and strategies using classical DRL methods. To support\nthis effort, the authors developed a novel, publicly available implementation\nof SLS, featuring a graphical user interface (GUI) and benchmarking tools for\nDRL algorithms. Experimental results reveal that while considered basic by\nmodern DRL standards, DQN, DDQN, and Dueling DQN agents achieved roughly 50% of\nthe maximum possible game reward. This suggests a baseline understanding of the\ngame's mechanics, with agents favoring legal moves over illegal ones. However,\na significant limitation was the extensive training required, around 2000\ngames, for agents to reach peak performance, compared to human players who\ngrasp the game within a few rounds. Even after prolonged training, agents\noccasionally made illegal moves, highlighting both the potential and\nlimitations of these classical DRL methods in semi-complex, socially driven\ngames. The findings establish a foundational benchmark for training agents in\nSLS and similar negotiation-based environments while underscoring the need for\nadvanced or hybrid DRL approaches to improve learning efficiency and\nadaptability.

The CRT symmetry is\nglobal with respect to the big bang for these two-sheet universes. In this\nconstruction the presence of an observer is equivalent to taking a CRT gauge,\nthus breaks the global CRT symmetry. In de Sitter space the observer need not\nto carry a clock, as the clock is equivalent to a way telling the temporal\norder of events. The role of a clock can be replaced by redshift, like in FLRW\ncosmology, points to the adaptability of measurement in cosmological contexts.\nThis concept drives us to write gauge invariant formulas, i.e. correlation\nfunction [O(t-w),O(-t-w)]=0 identically for w the time from the observer to big\nbang. In this spirit, the gauge invariant formula overlaps with the fact that\nthe Hilbert space is real in holographic de Sitter universe. The observer is\nhighly entangled with the rest of the universe in a thermofield double state,\nthus contributes to no extra degrees of freedom.

    "abstract": "An $f$-edge (or vertex) connectivity certificate is a sparse subgraph that\nmaintains connectivity under the failure of at most $f$ edges (or vertices). It\nis well known that any $n$-vertex graph admits an $f$-edge (or vertex)\nconnectivity certificate with $\\Theta(f n)$ edges (Nagamochi and Ibaraki,\nAlgorithmica 1992). A recent work by (Bodwin, Haeupler and Parter, SODA 2024)\nintroduced a new and considerably stronger variant of connectivity certificates\nthat can preserve connectivity under any failing set of edges with bounded\ndegree. For every $n$-vertex graph $G=(V,E)$ and a degree threshold $f$, an\n$f$-Edge-Faulty-Degree (EFD) certificate is a subgraph $H \\subseteq G$ with the\nfollowing guarantee: For any subset $F \\subseteq E$ with $deg(F)\\leq f$ and\nevery pair $u,v \\in V$, $u$ and $v$ are connected in $H - F$ iff they are\nconnected in $G - F$. For example, a $1$-EFD certificate preserves connectivity\nunder the failing of any matching edge set $F$ (hence, possibly\n$|F|=\\Theta(n)$). In their work, [BHP'24] presented an expander-based approach\n(e.g., using the tools of expander decomposition and expander routing) for\ncomputing $f$-EFD certificates with $O(f n \\cdot poly(\\log n))$ edges. They\nalso provided a lower bound of $\\Omega(f n\\cdot \\log_f n)$, hence $\\Omega(n\\log\nn)$ for $f=O(1)$. In this work, we settle the optimal existential size bounds\nfor $f$-EFD certificates (up to constant factors), and also extend it to\nsupport vertex failures with bounded degrees (where each vertex is incident to\nat most $f$ faulty vertices). Specifically, we show that for every $n>f/2$, any\n$n$-vertex graph admits an $f$-EFD (and $f$-VFD) certificates with $O(f n \\cdot\n\\log(n/f))$ edges and that this bound is tight. Our upper bound arguments are\nconsiderably simpler compared to prior work, do not use expanders, and only\nexploit the basic structure of bounded degree edge and vertex cuts.",

Leftist heaps are constructed for efficiency in the worst-case\nsense whereas skew heaps are self-adjusting, designed for efficiency in the\namortized sense. In this paper, we analyze the amortized complexity of leftist\nheaps to initiate a full performance comparison with skew heaps. We consider\nboth the leftist heaps originally developed by Crane and Knuth, which are also\nreferred to as rank-biased (or, height-biased) leftist heaps, and the\nweight-biased leftist heaps introduced by Cho and Sahni. We show how\nweight-biased leftist heaps satisfy the same exact amortized bounds as skew\nheaps. With these matching bounds we establish a nice trade-off in which\nstorage of weights is used to limit the worst-case complexity of leftist heaps,\nwithout affecting the amortized complexity compared to skew heaps. For\nrank-biased leftist heaps, we obtain the same amortized lower bounds as for\nskew heaps, but whether these bounds are tight is left as an open problem.",

    "abstract": "Energy conditions are attempts to summarise the properties of realistic\ndescriptions of matter via constraints on the energy-momentum tensor. This is,\nfor example, useful when one wants to understand the types of spacetime\ngeometry that can be realised in general relativity. However, it is currently\nunknown what (if any) energy condition a realistic quantum theory interacting\ngravitationally would obey.\n  In this thesis, we provide support for the conformally invariant averaged\nnull energy condition (CANEC), a particular proposal towards a more generally\nvalid energy condition. We motivate our interest in the CANEC by reviewing the\nrole of the null energy condition (NEC) in classical gravity, summarising a\ngeneral proof of the averaged NEC (ANEC) for quantum field theories in flat\nspacetime, and going over a holographic proof of the CANEC in a class of curved\nspacetimes. The context in which the CANEC applies is then extended with two\nproofs: a holographic proof in two types of spacetime to which the existing\nproof does not apply, and a field theoretical proof for conformal field\ntheories in conformally flat spacetimes.\n  Finally, we consider light-ray operators in Minkowski spacetime. The\nconnection between these operators and the CANEC is that the CANEC on a\nlightcone in Minkowski spacetime constrains a light-ray operator for an even\nnumber of spacetime dimensions $d$. Via an explicit computation, we show that\nmany light-ray operators are positive-semidefinite in a class of non-minimally\ncoupled but otherwise free real scalar field theories. One of the operators for\nwhich this holds is the CANEC-operator on the lightcone for even $d$.",

Creating\nthem is a long and expensive process, which could potentially be improved\nthrough analysis of social media posts related to symptoms and behaviors prior\nto diagnosis.

The method first identifies a cohort of relevant users through\ntheir posts in dedicated patient groups and a control group of users who\nreported similar symptoms but did not report being diagnosed with the condition\nof interest. Posts made prior to diagnosis are used to generate decision rules\nto differentiate between the different groups, by clustering symptoms mentioned\nby these users and training a decision tree to differentiate between the two\ngroups.

The most straightforward approach to achieve unlearning is to train\nthe model from scratch, excluding clients who request data removal, but it is\nresource-intensive. Current state-of-the-art FU methods extend traditional FL\nframeworks by leveraging stored historical updates, enabling more efficient\nunlearning than training from scratch. However, the use of stored updates\nintroduces significant privacy risks. Adversaries with access to these updates\ncan potentially reconstruct clients' local data, a well-known vulnerability in\nthe privacy domain. While privacy-enhanced techniques exist, their applications\nto FU scenarios that balance unlearning efficiency with privacy protection\nremain underexplored. To address this gap, we propose FedADP, a method designed\nto achieve both efficiency and privacy preservation in FU. Our approach\nincorporates an adaptive differential privacy (DP) mechanism, carefully\nbalancing privacy and unlearning performance through a novel budget allocation\nstrategy tailored for FU. FedADP also employs a dual-layered selection process,\nfocusing on global models with significant changes and client updates closely\naligned with the global model, reducing storage and communication costs.\nAdditionally, a novel calibration method is introduced to facilitate effective\nunlearning.

Compared to passive RIS, active RIS\nare equipped with amplifiers on each reflecting element, allowing them to\nsimultaneously reflect and amplify signals, thereby overcoming the double\nmultiplicative fading in the phase response, and improving both system coverage\nand performance. Additionally, the Integrated Relative Energy Efficiency (IREE)\nmetric, as introduced in [1], addresses the dynamic variations in traffic and\ncapacity over time and space, enabling more energy-efficient wireless systems.\nBuilding on these advancements, this paper investigates the problem of\nmaximizing IREE in active RIS-assisted green communication systems.

In the context of video data, such\nmodels can be utilized to transform the coordinates of pixel locations along\nwith frame occurrence times (or indices) into RGB color values. Although INRs\nfacilitate effective compression, they are unsuitable for editing purposes. One\npotential solution is to use a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based model, such\nas the Video Gaussian Representation (VGR), which is capable of encoding video\nas a multitude of 3D Gaussians and is applicable for numerous video processing\noperations, including editing.

    "abstract": "SRAM-based Analog Compute-in-Memory (ACiM) demonstrates promising energy\nefficiency for deep neural network (DNN) processing. Nevertheless, efforts to\noptimize efficiency frequently compromise accuracy, and this trade-off remains\ninsufficiently studied due to the difficulty of performing full-system\nvalidation. Specifically, existing simulation tools rarely target SRAM-based\nACiM and exhibit inconsistent accuracy predictions, highlighting the need for a\nstandardized, SRAM CiM circuit-aware evaluation methodology. This paper\npresents ASiM, a simulation framework for evaluating inference accuracy in\nSRAM-based ACiM systems. ASiM captures critical effects in SRAM based analog\ncompute in memory systems, such as ADC quantization, bit parallel encoding, and\nanalog noise, which must be modeled with high fidelity due to their distinct\nbehavior in charge domain architectures compared to other memory technologies.\nASiM supports a wide range of modern DNN workloads, including CNN and\nTransformer-based models such as ViT, and scales to large-scale tasks like\nImageNet classification. Our results indicate that bit-parallel encoding can\nimprove energy efficiency with only modest accuracy degradation; however, even\n1 LSB of analog noise can significantly impair inference performance,\nparticularly in complex tasks such as ImageNet. To address this, we explore\nhybrid analog-digital execution and majority voting schemes, both of which\nenhance robustness without negating energy savings. ASiM bridges the gap\nbetween hardware design and inference performance, offering actionable insights\nfor energy-efficient, high-accuracy ACiM deployment.",

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely employed for semi-supervised\nnode classification tasks on graphs. However, the performance of GNNs is\nsignificantly affected by label noise, that is, a small amount of incorrectly\nlabeled nodes can substantially misguide model training. Mainstream solutions\ndefine node classification with label noise (NCLN) as a reliable labeling task,\noften introducing node similarity with quadratic computational complexity to\nmore accurately assess label reliability. To this end, in this paper, we\nintroduce the Label Ensemble Graph Neural Network (LEGNN), a lower complexity\nmethod for robust GNNs training against label noise. LEGNN reframes NCLN as a\nlabel ensemble task, gathering informative multiple labels instead of\nconstructing a single reliable label, avoiding high-complexity computations for\nreliability assessment. Specifically, LEGNN conducts a two-step process:\nbootstrapping neighboring contexts and robust learning with gathered multiple\nlabels. In the former step, we apply random neighbor masks for each node and\ngather the predicted labels as a high-probability label set. This mitigates the\nimpact of inaccurately labeled neighbors and diversifies the label set. In the\nlatter step, we utilize a partial label learning based strategy to aggregate\nthe high-probability label information for model training. Additionally, we\nsymmetrically gather a low-probability label set to counteract potential noise\nfrom the bootstrapped high-probability label set. Extensive experiments on six\ndatasets demonstrate that LEGNN achieves outstanding performance while ensuring\nefficiency. Moreover, it exhibits good scalability on dataset with over one\nhundred thousand nodes and one million edges.",

To answer these questions, we\nconduct interviews with maintainers at several major Linux distributions and\nintroduce a Linux package malware benchmark dataset. Using this dataset, we\nevaluate the performance of six open-source malware detection scanners.\nDistribution maintainers, according to the interviews, have mostly focused on\nreproducible builds to date. Our interviews identified only a single Linux\ndistribution, Wolfi OS, that performs active malware scanning. Using this new\nbenchmark dataset, the evaluation found that the performance of existing\nopen-source malware scanners is underwhelming. Most studied tools excel at\nproducing false positives but only infrequently detect true malware.

It simultaneously raises\nserious concerns regarding privacy and security. Some methods are proposed to\ndistinguish the diffusion model generated images through reconstructing.\nHowever, the inversion and denoising processes are time-consuming and heavily\nreliant on the pre-trained generative model. Consequently, if the pre-trained\ngenerative model meet the problem of out-of-domain, the detection performance\ndeclines. To address this issue, we propose a universal synthetic image\ndetector Time Step Generating (TSG), which does not rely on pre-trained models'\nreconstructing ability, specific datasets, or sampling algorithms. Our method\nutilizes a pre-trained diffusion model's network as a feature extractor to\ncapture fine-grained details, focusing on the subtle differences between real\nand synthetic images. By controlling the time step t of the network input, we\ncan effectively extract these distinguishing detail features. Then, those\nfeatures can be passed through a classifier (i.e. Resnet), which efficiently\ndetects whether an image is synthetic or real.

    "abstract": "Density-integrated, multi-wavelength nanoscale lasers with ultra-low power\nconsumption and ultra-compact footprints are essential for energy-efficient,\nfast and high-throughput data processing. Currently, on-chip multi-wavelength\nlasers predominantly rely on arrays of discrete large-scale conventional\nsemiconductor lasers that are susceptible to the fabrication imperfections.\nTopological rainbow nanolasers, which spatially confine and emit specific\ntopologically protected light frequencies, offer a prospective approach for\nachieving ultra-compact integrated multi-wavelength light sources with enhanced\nrobustness against perturbations and defects. However, it remains a significant\nchallenge to achieve highly localized topological rainbow trapping in\nnanocavities for laser emission with both high quality factors and ultra-small\nmode volumes. Here, we experimentally report ultra-compact topological photonic\ncrystal rainbow nanolasers operating in the 1550 nm telecom band. Specifically,\nwe present rainbow-like emission with uniform wavelength spacing and\nwavelength-scale mode volume $\\sim 0.7 \\left(\\frac{\\lambda}{n}\\right)^3$ in a\none-dimensional topological rainbow nanolaser, exhibiting robust lasing\noperation across a wide temperature range and a spectral tuning capability of\napproximately 70 nm. Additionally, we demonstrate an ultra-compact\ntwo-dimensional topological rainbow nanolaser in an exceptionally compact\nfootprint of nearly 0.002 $\\text{mm}^2$, featuring a broad rainbow spectra with\n64 continuously tuned lasing peaks. Our work provides a promising method for\nrealizing robust and nanoscale multi-wavelength tunable laser sources, paving\nthe way for numerous potential applications in ultra-compact photonic chips.",

    "abstract": "In laser-driven indirect inertial confinement fusion (ICF), a hohlraum--a\ncavity constructed from high-Z materials--serves the purpose of converting\nlaser energy into thermal x-ray energy. This process involves the interaction\nof low-density ablated plasmas, which can give rise to weakly collisional shock\nwaves characterized by a Knudsen number $K_n$ on the order of 1. The Knudsen\nnumber serves as a metric for assessing the relative importance of collisional\ninteractions. Preliminary experimental investigations and computational\nsimulations have demonstrated that the kinetic effects associated with weakly\ncollisional shock waves significantly impact the efficiency of the implosion\nprocess. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the physics underlying\nweakly collisional shock waves is essential. This research aims to explore the\nformation and fundamental structural properties of weakly collisional shock\nwaves within a hohlraum, as well as the phenomena of ion mixing and ion\nseparation in multicomponent plasmas. Weakly collisional shocks occupy a\ntransition regime between collisional shock waves ($K_n \\ll 1$) and\ncollisionless shock waves ($K_n \\gg 1$), thereby exhibiting both kinetic\neffects and hydrodynamic behavior. These shock waves are primarily governed by\nan electrostatic field, which facilitates significant electrostatic sheath\nacceleration and ion reflection acceleration. The differentiation of ions\noccurs due to the varying charge-to-mass ratios of different ion species in the\npresence of electrostatic field, resulting in the separation of ion densities,\nvelocities, temperatures and concentrations. The presence of weakly collisional\nshock waves within the hohlraum is expected to affect the transition of laser\nenergy and the overall efficiency of the implosion process.",

When data with a trigger is processed by a\nbackdoor model, it can lead to mispredictions targeted by attackers, whereas\nnormal data yields regular results. The scope of backdoor attacks is expanding\nbeyond computer vision and encroaching into areas such as natural language\nprocessing and speech recognition. Nevertheless, existing backdoor defense\nmethods are typically tailored to specific data modalities, restricting their\napplication in multimodal contexts. While multimodal learning proves highly\napplicable in facial recognition, sentiment analysis, action recognition,\nvisual question answering, the security of these models remains a crucial\nconcern. Specifically, there are no existing backdoor benchmarks targeting\nmultimodal applications or related tasks.\n  In order to facilitate the research in multimodal backdoor, we introduce\nBackdoorMBTI, the first backdoor learning toolkit and benchmark designed for\nmultimodal evaluation across three representative modalities from eleven\ncommonly used datasets. BackdoorMBTI provides a systematic backdoor learning\npipeline, encompassing data processing, data poisoning, backdoor training, and\nevaluation. The generated poison datasets and backdoor models enable detailed\nevaluation of backdoor defenses. Given the diversity of modalities,\nBackdoorMBTI facilitates systematic evaluation across different data types.\nFurthermore, BackdoorMBTI offers a standardized approach to handling practical\nfactors in backdoor learning, such as issues related to data quality and\nerroneous labels.

These observations reveal that after exhibiting very regular behavior\nas a ``clocked'' burster, the peak luminosity of the SRGA J144459.2$-$604207\nX-ray bursts shows a gradual decline. The observed light curves exhibit a short\nplateau feature, potentially with a double peak, followed by a rapid decay in\nthe tail-features unlike those seen in previously observed clocked bursters. In\nthis study, we calculate a series of multizone X-ray burst models with various\ncompositions of accreted matter, specifically varying the mass fractions of\nhydrogen ($X$), helium ($Y$), and heavier CNO elements or metallicity ($Z_{\\rm\nCNO}$). We demonstrate that a model with higher $Z_{\\rm CNO}$ and/or lower\n$X/Y$ compared to the solar values can reproduce the observed behavior of SRGA\nJ144459.2$-$604207. Therefore, we propose that this new X-ray burster is likely\nthe first clocked burster with non-solar elemental compositions. Moreover,\nbased on the X-ray burst light curve morphology in the decline phase observed\nby NinjaSat, a He-enhanced model with $X/Y \\approx 1.5$ seems preferred over\nhigh-metallicity cases. We also give a brief discussion on the implications for\nthe neutron star mass, binary star evolution, inclination angle, and the\npotential for a high-metallicity scenario, the last of which is closely related\nto the properties of the hot CNO cycle.",

    "abstract": "A random recurrent neural network, called a reservoir, can be used to learn\nrobot movements conditioned on context inputs that encode task goals. The\nLearning is achieved by mapping the random dynamics of the reservoir modulated\nby context to desired trajectories via linear regression. This makes the\nreservoir computing (RC) approach computationally efficient as no iterative\ngradient descent learning is needed. In this work, we propose a novel RC-based\nLearning from Demonstration (LfD) framework that not only learns to generate\nthe demonstrated movements but also allows online modulation of the reservoir\ndynamics to generate movement trajectories that are not covered by the initial\ndemonstration set. This is made possible by using a Reinforcement Learning (RL)\nmodule that learns a policy to output context as its actions based on the robot\nstate. Considering that the context dimension is typically low, learning with\nthe RL module is very efficient. We show the validity of the proposed model\nwith systematic experiments on a 2 degrees-of-freedom (DOF) simulated robot\nthat is taught to reach targets, encoded as context, with and without obstacle\navoidance constraint. The initial data set includes a set of reaching\ndemonstrations which are learned by the reservoir system. To enable reaching\nout-of-distribution targets, the RL module is engaged in learning a policy to\ngenerate dynamic contexts so that the generated trajectory achieves the desired\ngoal without any learning in the reservoir system. Overall, the proposed model\nuses an initial learned motor primitive set to efficiently generate diverse\nmotor behaviors guided by the designed reward function. Thus the model can be\nused as a flexible and effective LfD system where the action repertoire can be\nextended without new data collection.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a multi-level approximate computing approach for\nreal-time traffic sign recognition in autonomous vehicles called AppSign. Since\nautonomous vehicles are real-time systems, they must gather environmental\ninformation and process them instantaneously to respond properly. However, due\nto the limited resources of these systems, executing computation-intensive\nalgorithms such as deep-learning schemes that lead to precise output is\nimpossible and takes a long time. To tackle this, imprecise computation schemes\ncompromise the complexity and real-time operations. In this context, AppSign\npresents a multi-level approximate computing scheme to balance the accuracy and\ncomputation cost of the computation-intensive schemes and make them appropriate\nfor real-time applications. AppSign is applied to the CNN-based traffic sign\nrecognition unit by approximating the convolution operation of CNN which is the\nprimal solution for image processing applications. In AppSign a novel\napproximate multiplication method called \"TIRuD\" is proposed that truncates the\noperations while keeping the accuracy acceptable. Moreover, it provides the\nadaptive approximation of the underlying CNN by involving various levels of\ncomputation and considering different approximation methods. The efficiency of\nthe proposed AppSign, in real-time traffic sign recognition, is evaluated\nthrough several experiments. Based on these experiments, our proposed TIRuD\nreduces the accuracy by about $10\\%$ while saving execution time about $64\\%$\nover the exact multiplication, averagely.

    "abstract": "Precision medicine is a promising approach for accessible disease diagnosis\nand personalized intervention planning in high-mortality diseases such as\ncoronary artery disease (CAD), drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE), and chronic\nillnesses like Type 1 diabetes (T1D). By leveraging artificial intelligence\n(AI), precision medicine tailors diagnosis and treatment solutions to\nindividual patients by explicitly modeling variance in pathophysiology.\nHowever, the adoption of AI in medical applications faces significant\nchallenges, including poor generalizability across centers, demographics, and\ncomorbidities, limited explainability in clinical terms, and a lack of trust in\nethical decision-making. This paper proposes a framework to develop and\nethically evaluate expert-guided multi-modal AI, addressing these challenges in\nAI integration within precision medicine. We illustrate this framework with\ncase study on insulin management for T1D. To ensure ethical considerations and\nclinician engagement, we adopt a co-design approach where AI serves an\nassistive role, with final diagnoses or treatment plans emerging from\ncollaboration between clinicians and AI.",

Specifically, the infrared\nspectral data facilitate the precise estimation of stellar masses of numerous\nlow-redshift galaxies. We utilize the synthetic spectral energy distribution\n(SED) of 2853 nearby galaxies drawn from the DustPedia (435) and Stripe 82\nregions (2418). The stellar mass-to-light ratio ($M_*/L$) estimation accuracy\nover a wavelength range of $0.75-5.0$ $\\mu$m is computed through the SED\nfitting of the multi-wavelength photometric dataset, which has not yet been\nintensively explored in previous studies. We find that the scatter in $M_*/L$\nis significantly larger in the shorter and longer wavelength regimes due to the\neffect of the young stellar population and the dust contribution, respectively.\nWhile the scatter in $M_*/L$ approaches its minimum ($\\sim0.10$ dex) at\n$\\sim1.6$ $\\mu$m, it remains sensitive to the adopted star formation history\nmodel. Furthermore, $M_*/L$ demonstrates weak and strong correlations with the\nstellar mass and the specific star formation rate (SFR), respectively.

    "abstract": "We present the broadband spectral and timing properties of the atoll source\n4U 1702-429 using two observations of AstroSat with the second one having\nsimultaneous NICER data. For both observations, the spectra can be represented\nby a Comptonizing medium with a black body seed photon source which can be\nidentified with the surface of the neutron star. A disk emission along with a\ndistant reflection is also required for both spectra. For the first\nobservation, the coronal temperature ($\\sim 7$ keV) is smaller than the second\n($\\sim 13$ keV), and the disk is truncated at a larger radius, $\\sim 150$ km,\ncompared to the second, $\\sim 25$ km, for an assumed distance of 7 kpc. A kHz\nQPO at $\\sim 800$ Hz is detected in the first and is absent in the second\nobservation. Modeling the energy-dependent r.m.s and time lag of the kHz QPO\nreveals a corona size of $\\leq$ 30 km. A similar model can explain the energy\ndependence of the broadband noise at $\\sim 10$ Hz for the second observation.\nThe results suggest that kHz QPOs are associated with a compact corona\nsurrounding the neutron star and may occur when the disk is truncated at large\ndistances. We emphasize the need for more wide-band observations of the source\nto confirm these results.",

The\nproposed approach is verified through three numerical experiments. The results\nshow that even when the quadcopter is disturbed by different forces, the\nposition error of the end-effector achieves millimeter-level accuracy, and the\nattitude error remains within 1 degree.

Previous studies have demonstrated the\neffectiveness of cooperative perception in extending the perception range and\novercoming occlusions, thereby enhancing the safety of autonomous driving. In\nrecent years, a series of cooperative perception datasets have emerged;\nhowever, these datasets primarily focus on cameras and LiDAR, neglecting 4D\nRadar, a sensor used in single-vehicle autonomous driving to provide robust\nperception in adverse weather conditions. In this paper, to bridge the gap\ncreated by the absence of 4D Radar datasets in cooperative perception, we\npresent V2X-Radar, the first large-scale, real-world multi-modal dataset\nfeaturing 4D Radar.

We show that\nthis method is biased whenever the RSV is post-outcome, i.e. if variation in\nthe economic outcome causes variation in the RSV.

This question is especially relevant in the context of the Low\nLatency, Low Loss, Scalable Throughput (L4S) architecture, where the full\nbenefit is realized only when compatible protocols (scalable congestion\ncontrol, accurate ECN, and flow isolation at queues) are adopted at both\nendpoints of a connection and also at the bottleneck router.

We show that whether the sender uses TCP Prague or BBRv2 as\nthe scalable congestion control, it cannot be assured that it will not harm or\nbe harmed by another flow sharing the bottleneck link.

    "abstract": "In recent years, with the rapid development of augmented reality (AR)\ntechnology, there is an increasing demand for multi-user collaborative\nexperiences. Unlike for single-user experiences, ensuring the spatial\nlocalization of every user and maintaining synchronization and consistency of\npositioning and orientation across multiple users is a significant challenge.\nIn this paper, we propose a multi-user localization system based on ORB-SLAM2\nusing monocular RGB images as a development platform based on the Unity 3D game\nengine. This system not only performs user localization but also places a\ncommon virtual object on a planar surface (such as table) in the environment so\nthat every user holds a proper perspective view of the object. These generated\nvirtual objects serve as reference points for multi-user position\nsynchronization. The positioning information is passed among every user's AR\ndevices via a central server, based on which the relative position and movement\nof other users in the space of a specific user are presented via virtual\navatars all with respect to these virtual objects. In addition, we use deep\nlearning techniques to estimate the depth map of an image from a single RGB\nimage to solve occlusion problems in AR applications, making virtual objects\nappear more natural in AR scenes.",

We argue that these measurement tasks are highly\nreminiscent of measurement tasks found throughout the social sciences. With\nthis in mind, we present a framework, grounded in measurement theory from the\nsocial sciences, for measuring concepts related to the capabilities, impacts,\nopportunities, and risks of GenAI systems. The framework distinguishes between\nfour levels: the background concept, the systematized concept, the measurement\ninstrument(s), and the instance-level measurements themselves. This four-level\napproach differs from the way measurement is typically done in ML, where\nresearchers and practitioners appear to jump straight from background concepts\nto measurement instruments, with little to no explicit systematization in\nbetween. As well as surfacing assumptions, thereby making it easier to\nunderstand exactly what the resulting measurements do and do not mean, this\nframework has two important implications for evaluating evaluations: First, it\ncan enable stakeholders from different worlds to participate in conceptual\ndebates, broadening the expertise involved in evaluating GenAI systems.

To address these\nchallenges, we propose SCAN, a simple yet effective memory-augmented framework\nthat leverages Multimodal LLMs to improve surgical context comprehension via\nSelf-Contained Inquiry. SCAN operates autonomously, generating two types of\nmemory for context augmentation: Direct Memory (DM), which provides multiple\ncandidates (or hints) to the final answer, and Indirect Memory (IM), which\nconsists of self-contained question-hint pairs to capture broader scene\ncontext. DM directly assists in answering the question, while IM enhances\nunderstanding of the surgical scene beyond the immediate query. Reasoning over\nthese object-aware memories enables the model to accurately interpret images\nand respond to questions.

    "abstract": "Despite increasing demands for the thermodynamic data of liquids in a wide\nrange of science and engineering fields, there is a still a considerable lack\nof reliable data over a wide range of temperature ($T$) and pressure\nconditions. The most significant obstacle is that there is no practical method\nto calculate the entropy ($S$) of liquids. This problem can be solved using the\nthermodynamic definition of entropy, i.e., $S = \\int C d\\ln T$, where $C$ is\nspecific heat. The specific heat is calculated by the derivative of the\ninternal energy $U$ with respect to $T$. Both quantities, i.e., $U$ and $T$,\nare well defined in the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations based on density\nfunctional theory. The reliability of the present method is entirely dependent\non the accuracy of the specific heat of liquid, for which there is no standard\nmodel. The problem with liquids is that there are no eigenstates, based on\nwhich the standard procedures are constructed. The relationship between $U$ and\n$T$ is affected by the energy relaxation processes, the effect of which appears\nin the $T$ dependence on the specific heat of liquids. This motivates us to\nconduct MD simulations by isolating the system from an external heat bath. In\nthis paper, by applying this method to the liquid sodium, it is demonstrated\nthat the experimental $T$ dependence of the isochoric specific heat is\nreproduced well without any empirical parameter. On this basis, the entropy of\nthe liquid Na is obtained with a good agreement with experimental values.",

System operators employ PSPS\nto deactivate portions of the electric grid with heightened wildfire risks to\nprevent wildfire ignition and redispatch generators to minimize load shedding.\nA measure of vegetation flammability, called the Wildland Fire Potential Index\n(WFPI), has been widely used to evaluate the risk of nearby wildfires to power\nsystem operation. However, the WFPI does not correlate as strongly to\nhistorically observed wildfire ignition probabilities (OWIP) as WFPI-based the\nLarge Fire Probability (WLFP).Prior work chose not to incorporate\nwildfire-driven failure probabilities, such as the WLFP, because constraints\nwith Bernoulli random variables to represent wildfire ignitions could require\nnon-linear or non-convex constraints. This paper uses a deterministic\nequivalent of an otherwise complicating line de-energization constraint by\nquantifying the wildfire risk of operating transmission line as a sum of each\nenergized line's wildfire ignition log probability (log(WIP)) rather than as a\nsum of each energized line's WFPI. A day-ahead unit commitment and line\nde-energization PSPS framework is used to assess the cost differences driven by\nthe choice between the WFPI and WLFP risk metrics. Training the optimization on\nscenarios developed by mapping WLFP to log(WIP) rather than mapping the WFPI to\nlog(WIP) leads to reductions in the total real-time costs. For the IEEE RTS\n24-bus test system, mapping transmission line WLFP values to log(WIP) resulted\nin a 14.8 % (on average) decrease in expected real-time costs.",

To unleash this potential, it\nis crucial to achieve efficient packet delivery. In this paper, we propose a\nLink-identified Routing (LiR) architecture for LEO satellite networks. The LiR\narchitecture leverages the deterministic neighbor relation of LEO\nconstellations, and identifies each inter-satellite link (ISL). Moreover, LiR\narchitecture adopts source-route-style forwarding based on in-packet bloom\nfilter (BF). Each satellite could efficiently encode multiple ISL identifiers\nvia an in-packet BF to specify the end-to-end path for the packets. Due to\nfalse positives caused by BF, the more ISLs are encoded at a time, the more\nredundant forwarding cases emerge. Based on the topology characteristics, we\nderive the expected forwarding overhead in a closed-form and propose the\noptimal encoding policy. To accommodate link-state changes in LEO satellite\nnetworks, we propose the on-demand rerouting scheme and the on-demand detouring\nscheme to address the intermittent ISLs.

    "abstract": "Cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) networks provide a promising solution\nto improve road safety and traffic efficiency. One key challenge in such\nsystems lies in meeting different quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of\ncoexisting vehicular communication links, particularly under imperfect channel\nstate information (CSI) conditions caused by the highly dynamic environment. In\nthis paper, a novel analytical framework for examining the resilience of C-V2X\nnetworks in face of imperfect CSI is proposed. In this framework, the\nadaptation phase of the C-V2X network is studied, in which an adaptation power\nscheme is employed and the probability distribution function (PDF) of the\nimperfect CSI is estimated. Then, the resilience of C-V2X networks is studied\nthrough two principal dimensions: remediation capability and adaptation\nperformance, both of which are defined, quantified, and analyzed for the first\ntime. Particularly, an upper bound on the estimation's mean square error (MSE)\nis explicitly derived to capture the C-V2X's remediation capability, and a\nnovel metric named hazard rate (HR) is exploited to evaluate the C-V2X's\nadaptation performance. Afterwards, the impact of the adaptation power scheme\non the C-V2X's resilience is examined, revealing a tradeoff between the C-V2X's\nremediation capability and adaptation performance. Simulation results validate\nthe framework's superiority in capturing the interplay between adaptation and\nremediation, as well as the effectiveness of the two proposed metrics in\nguiding the design of the adaptation power scheme to enhance the system's\nresilience.",

    "abstract": "Recently hyperspectral imaging (HSI)-based grain quality assessment has\ngained research attention. However, unlike other imaging modalities, HSI data\nlacks sufficient labelled samples required to effectively train deep\nconvolutional neural network (DCNN)-based classifiers. In this paper, we\npresent a novel approach to grain quality assessment using HSI combined with\nfew-shot learning (FSL) techniques. Traditional methods for grain quality\nevaluation, while reliable, are invasive, time-consuming, and costly. HSI\noffers a non-invasive, real-time alternative by capturing both spatial and\nspectral information. However, a significant challenge in applying DCNNs for\nHSI-based grain classification is the need for large labelled databases, which\nare often difficult to obtain. To address this, we explore the use of FSL,\nwhich enables models to perform well with limited labelled data, making it a\npractical solution for real-world applications where rapid deployment is\nrequired. We also explored the application of FSL for the classification of\nhyperspectral images of bulk grains to enable rapid quality assessment at\nvarious receival points in the grain supply chain. We evaluated the performance\nof few-shot classifiers in two scenarios: first, classification of grain types\nseen during training, and second, generalisation to unseen grain types, a\ncrucial feature for real-world applications. In the first scenario, we\nintroduce a novel approach using pre-computed collective class prototypes\n(CCPs) to enhance inference efficiency and robustness. In the second scenario,\nwe assess the model's ability to classify novel grain types using limited\nsupport examples. Our experimental results show that despite using very limited\nlabelled data for training, our FSL classifiers accuracy is comparable to that\nof a fully trained classifier trained using a significantly larger labelled\ndatabase.",

    "abstract": "Action detection aims to detect (recognize and localize) human actions\nspatially and temporally in videos. Existing approaches focus on the closed-set\nsetting where an action detector is trained and tested on videos from a fixed\nset of action categories. However, this constrained setting is not viable in an\nopen world where test videos inevitably come beyond the trained action\ncategories. In this paper, we address the practical yet challenging\nOpen-Vocabulary Action Detection (OVAD) problem. It aims to detect any action\nin test videos while training a model on a fixed set of action categories. To\nachieve such an open-vocabulary capability, we propose a novel method OpenMixer\nthat exploits the inherent semantics and localizability of large\nvision-language models (VLM) within the family of query-based detection\ntransformers (DETR). Specifically, the OpenMixer is developed by spatial and\ntemporal OpenMixer blocks (S-OMB and T-OMB), and a dynamically fused alignment\n(DFA) module. The three components collectively enjoy the merits of strong\ngeneralization from pre-trained VLMs and end-to-end learning from DETR design.\nMoreover, we established OVAD benchmarks under various settings, and the\nexperimental results show that the OpenMixer performs the best over baselines\nfor detecting seen and unseen actions.

    "abstract": "Accurate forecasts of distributed solar generation are necessary to reduce\nnegative impacts resulting from the increased uptake of distributed solar\nphotovoltaic (PV) systems. However, the high variability of solar generation\nover short time intervals (seconds to minutes) caused by cloud movement makes\nthis forecasting task difficult. To address this, using cloud images, which\ncapture the second-to-second changes in cloud cover affecting solar generation,\nhas shown promise. Recently, deep neural networks with \"attention\" that focus\non important regions of an image have been applied with success in many\ncomputer vision applications. However, their use for forecasting cloud movement\nhas not yet been extensively explored. In this work, we propose an\nattention-based convolutional long short-term memory network to forecast cloud\nmovement and apply an existing self-attention-based method previously proposed\nfor video prediction to forecast cloud movement. We investigate and discuss the\nimpact of cloud forecasts from attention-based methods towards forecasting\ndistributed solar generation, compared to cloud forecasts from\nnon-attention-based methods. We further provide insights into the different\nsolar forecast performances that can be achieved for high and low altitude\nclouds. We find that for clouds at high altitudes, the cloud predictions\nobtained using attention-based methods result in solar forecast skill score\nimprovements of 5.86% or more compared to non-attention-based methods.",

While traditional onboard and operando methods can\nmeasure impedance, voltage, or capacity, they lack spatial resolution to\npinpoint the properties to specific layers and interfaces. In this work, we\ndescribe an approach of using thermal waves to measure entropy change,\ntransport resistance, and charge-transfer resistance with depth resolution of a\nfew microns within an electrochemical cell. We achieve this by relating heat\ngeneration at multiple harmonics of an AC current to electrochemical processes\nand leveraging frequency dependence of thermal penetration depth for spatial\nresolution. We name this frequency domain spectroscopy of the thermal\nsignatures of the electrochemical processes measured at multiple harmonics of\nthe alternating current as Multi-harmonic ElectroThermal Spectroscopy (METS).\nThis technique enables isolation and measurement of solvation entropy at\nindividual electrode-electrolyte interfaces from the first harmonic (1{\\omega})\nthermal signature and resolution of the overall interfacial impedance into\ncharge-transfer and interface transport resistance components from the second\nharmonic (2{\\omega}) thermal signature. From this, we also demonstrate an\noperando measurement of the growth of the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI)\nlayer at the lithium-electrolyte interface and show that two chemically similar\nelectrodes can have significantly different interfacial transport resistance\nbased on the preparation of the electrodes.

However, relying on human\nannotations to assess feedback effectiveness is laborious and prone to biases,\nunderscoring the need for an automated, scalable, and objective method.\nCreating such an automated system poses challenges, as it requires an\nunderstanding of both the verbal feedback delivered by the trainer and the\nvisual context of the real-time surgical scene.
