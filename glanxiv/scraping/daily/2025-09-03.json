This enables\nreliable separation of competing reaction pathways and makes this approach\nuniquely suited for characterizing weak reaction channels. However, rich\ninformation contained in experimental CEI patterns remains largely\nunderexploited due to challenges in visualizing correlations between multiple\nobservables in multi-dimensional parameter space. Here we present a new\napproach to CEI of intermediate-sized polyatomic molecules, detecting up to\neight ionic fragments in coincidence and leveraging machine-learning-based\nanalysis to identify patterns and correlations in the resulting\nhigh-dimensional momentum-space data, enabling robust molecular structure\nidentification and differentiation. Our approach provides high-dimensional\nbackground-free data encoding exceptionally rich structural information and\nestablishes an automated, scalable framework for extracting insightful\ninformation from the data. As a demonstration, we apply this method to image\nand distinguish dichloroethylene isomers, showcasing its potential for broader\napplications in molecular imaging. Our results pave the way for\nchannel-specific analysis of ultrafast structural dynamics in chemically\nrelevant systems, particularly for disentangling mixed reaction pathways and\ndetecting contributions from weak channels and minority species.",

Typically, a higher quality\nrepresentation can be achieved by using a large number of 3D Gaussians.\nHowever, using large 3D Gaussian counts significantly increases the GPU device\nmemory for storing model parameters. A large model thus requires powerful GPUs\nwith high memory capacities for training and has slower training/rendering\nlatencies due to the inefficiencies of memory access and data movement. In this\nwork, we introduce ContraGS, a method to enable training directly on compressed\n3DGS representations without reducing the Gaussian Counts, and thus with a\nlittle loss in model quality. ContraGS leverages codebooks to compactly store a\nset of Gaussian parameter vectors throughout the training process, thereby\nsignificantly reducing memory consumption. While codebooks have been\ndemonstrated to be highly effective at compressing fully trained 3DGS models,\ndirectly training using codebook representations is an unsolved challenge.\nContraGS solves the problem of learning non-differentiable parameters in\ncodebook-compressed representations by posing parameter estimation as a\nBayesian inference problem. To this end, ContraGS provides a framework that\neffectively uses MCMC sampling to sample over a posterior distribution of these\ncompressed representations. With ContraGS, we demonstrate that ContraGS\nsignificantly reduces the peak memory during training (on average 3.49X) and\naccelerated training and rendering (1.36X and 1.88X on average, respectively),\nwhile retraining close to state-of-art quality.",

    "abstract": "World models that infer and predict environmental dynamics are foundational\nto embodied intelligence. However, their potential is often limited by the\nfinite complexity and implicit biases of hand-crafted training environments. To\ndevelop truly generalizable and robust agents, we need environments that scale\nin complexity alongside the agents learning within them. In this work, we\nreframe the challenge of environment generation as the problem of learning a\ngoal-conditioned, generative world model. We propose a system where a\ngenerative **Attacker** agent learns an implicit world model to synthesize\nincreasingly difficult challenges for a team of cooperative **Defender**\nagents. The Attacker's objective is not passive prediction, but active,\ngoal-driven interaction: it models and generates world states (i.e.,\nconfigurations of enemy units) specifically to exploit the Defenders'\nweaknesses. Concurrently, the embodied Defender team learns a cooperative\npolicy to overcome these generated worlds. This co-evolutionary dynamic creates\na self-scaling curriculum where the world model continuously adapts to\nchallenge the decision-making policy of the agents, providing an effectively\ninfinite stream of novel and relevant training scenarios. We demonstrate that\nthis framework leads to the emergence of complex behaviors, such as the world\nmodel learning to generate flanking and shielding formations, and the defenders\nlearning coordinated focus-fire and spreading tactics. Our findings position\nadversarial co-evolution as a powerful method for learning instrumental world\nmodels that drive agents toward greater strategic depth and robustness.",

We measure stellar rotation\nperiods and disk corotation radii ($R_{\\rm co}$) for 47 CTTS from the HST\nULLYSES sample. We compare $R_{\\rm co}$ to the magnetospheric truncation radii\n($R_{\\rm i}$) and show that most CTTS are in the spin-up regime based on model\npredictions, which may indicate efficient angular momentum loss processes. We\nfind evidence of magnetospheric outflows and episodic accretion, and our\nobservations are consistent with the presence of accretion-powered stellar\nwinds. We confirm predictions that $R_{\\rm i}$ is variable over timescales of\ndays, causing some CTTS to cross accretion stability regime boundaries. We\ncharacterize light curve morphologies and confirm that our inclined CTTS with\n$R_{\\rm i}\\sim R_{\\rm co}$ show dipper light curves, consistent with\nexpectations from disk warp models. However, dippers occur at all values of\n$R_{\\rm i}/R_{\\rm co}$, suggesting that they do not need to be near the\npropeller regime. Finally, we show that our measured $R_{\\rm i}$ locations are\nconsistent with observed ultra-short-period planet (USP) semi-major axes. If\nUSPs are stable against tidal dissipation, as has been suggested in the\nliterature, then our work provides a plausible USP formation channel.

The second problem addresses a semidiscrete Cauchy inverse\nproblem, which involves determining the solution of the stochastic parabolic\nequation in a subdomain of space-time, from the data of the solution and the\ntrace of the discrete spatial derivative on a subdomain of the boundary of\nspace and time. To address these problems, we establish two Carleman estimates\nfor a semidiscrete stochastic parabolic operator in arbitrary dimensions: one\nfor the homogeneous boundary condition and the other for the nonhomogeneous\nboundary condition.

    "abstract": "Responding to rising global food security needs, precision agriculture and\ndeep learning-based plant disease diagnosis have become crucial. Yet, deploying\nhigh-precision models on edge devices is challenging. Most lightweight networks\nuse attention mechanisms designed for generic object recognition, which poorly\ncapture subtle pathological features like irregular lesion shapes and complex\ntextures. To overcome this, we propose a twofold solution: first, using a\ntraining-free neural architecture search method (DeepMAD) to create an\nefficient network backbone for edge devices; second, introducing the\nShape-Texture Attention Module (STAM). STAM splits attention into two branches\n-- one using deformable convolutions (DCNv4) for shape awareness and the other\nusing a Gabor filter bank for texture awareness. On the public CCMT plant\ndisease dataset, our STA-Net model (with 401K parameters and 51.1M FLOPs)\nreached 89.00% accuracy and an F1 score of 88.96%. Ablation studies confirm\nSTAM significantly improves performance over baseline and standard attention\nmodels. Integrating domain knowledge via decoupled attention thus presents a\npromising path for edge-deployed precision agriculture AI. The source code is\navailable at https://github.com/RzMY/STA-Net.",

Therefore, metasurfaces are highly appealing to\nenable the engineering of nonlinear optical interactions at an unprecedented\nlevel.

    "abstract": "The rapid expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Wireless Sensor\nNetworks (WSNs) has significantly increased the attack surface of such systems,\nmaking them vulnerable to a wide range of cyber threats. Traditional Intrusion\nDetection Systems (IDS) often fail to meet the stringent requirements of\nresource-constrained IoT environments due to their high computational cost and\nreliance on large labeled datasets. To address these challenges, this paper\nproposes a novel hybrid Intrusion Detection System that integrates a Quantum\nGenetic Algorithm (QGA) with Self-Supervised Learning (SSL). The QGA leverages\nquantum-inspired evolutionary operators to optimize feature selection and\nfine-tune model parameters, ensuring lightweight yet efficient detection in\nresource-limited networks. Meanwhile, SSL enables the system to learn robust\nrepresentations from unlabeled data, thereby reducing dependency on manually\nlabeled training sets. The proposed framework is evaluated on benchmark IoT\nintrusion datasets, demonstrating superior performance in terms of detection\naccuracy, false positive rate, and computational efficiency compared to\nconventional evolutionary and deep learning-based IDS models. The results\nhighlight the potential of combining quantum-inspired optimization with\nself-supervised paradigms to design next-generation intrusion detection\nsolutions for IoT and WSN environments.",

The length of dislocation\nlinks, connecting neighboring nodes within this network, contains crucial\ninformation about the evolving dislocation microstructure. By analyzing data\nfrom Discrete Dislocation Dynamics (DDD) simulations in face-centered cubic\n(fcc) Cu, we characterize the statistical distribution of link lengths of\ndislocation networks during strain hardening on individual slip systems. Our\nanalysis reveals that link lengths on active slip systems follow a\ndouble-exponential distribution, while those on inactive slip systems conform\nto a single-exponential distribution. The distinctive long tail observed in the\ndouble-exponential distribution is attributed to the stress-induced bowing out\nof long links on active slip systems, a feature that disappears upon removal of\nthe applied stress. We further demonstrate that both observed link length\ndistributions can be explained by extending a one-dimensional Poisson process\nto include different growth functions. Specifically, the double-exponential\ndistribution emerges when the growth rate for links exceeding a critical length\nbecomes super-linear, which aligns with the physical phenomenon of long links\nbowing out under stress. This work advances our understanding of dislocation\nmicrostructure evolution during strain hardening and elucidates the underlying\nphysical mechanisms governing its formation.",

However, adapting\nthese models to new fine-grained domains remains difficult due to reliance on\nprompt engineering and the high cost of full model fine-tuning. Existing\nadaptation approaches rely on augmented components, such as prompt tokens and\nadapter modules, which could limit adaptation quality, destabilize the model,\nand compromise the rich knowledge learned during pretraining. In this work, we\npresent \\textbf{CLIP-SVD}, a novel \\textit{multi-modal} and\n\\textit{parameter-efficient} adaptation technique that leverages Singular Value\nDecomposition (SVD) to modify the internal parameter space of CLIP without\ninjecting additional modules.

Understanding these patterns is crucial, yet prior work\nprimarily relied on simplified self-reports and heuristic prompting, with\nlittle behavioral validation. In this study, we systematically characterize LLM\npersonality across three dimensions: (1) the dynamic emergence and evolution of\ntrait profiles throughout training stages; (2) the predictive validity of\nself-reported traits in behavioral tasks; and (3) the impact of targeted\ninterventions, such as persona injection, on both self-reports and behavior.\nOur findings reveal that instructional alignment (e.g., RLHF, instruction\ntuning) significantly stabilizes trait expression and strengthens trait\ncorrelations in ways that mirror human data. However, these self-reported\ntraits do not reliably predict behavior, and observed associations often\ndiverge from human patterns. While persona injection successfully steers\nself-reports in the intended direction, it exerts little or inconsistent effect\non actual behavior.

As an\ninitial step towards incorporating people's background and identities in\nautomated red-teaming, we develop and evaluate a novel method, PersonaTeaming,\nthat introduces personas in the adversarial prompt generation process to\nexplore a wider spectrum of adversarial strategies. In particular, we first\nintroduce a methodology for mutating prompts based on either \"red-teaming\nexpert\" personas or \"regular AI user\" personas.

In a series of papers over the past five\nyears, we have collected spectropolarimetric measurements to constrain the\nlarge-scale magnetic fields for a sample of stars spanning this transition,\nincluding a range of spectral types from late F to early K.

We supplement the sample with two additional active stars\nto provide more context for the evolution of wind braking torque with stellar\nRossby number (Ro).

However, most dynamic testing techniques follow a\ntop-down paradigm, and struggle to reach and exercise functions deep within the\ncall graph. While recent works have proposed Bottom-Up approaches to address\nthese limitations, they face challenges with false positives and generating\nvalid inputs that adhere to the context of the entire program.\n  In this work, we introduce a new paradigm that we call Reactive Bottom-Up\nTesting. Our insight is that function-level testing is necessary but not\nsufficient for the validation of vulnerabilities in functions. What we need is\na systematic approach that not only tests functions in isolation but also\nvalidates their behavior within the broader program context, ensuring that\ndetected vulnerabilities are both reachable and triggerable. We develop a\nthree-stage bottom-up testing scheme: (1) identify likely-vulnerable functions\nand generate type- and context-aware harnesses; (2) fuzz to find crashes and\nextract input constraints via symbolic execution; (3) verify crashes by\ncombining constraints to remove false positives. We implemented an automated\nprototype, which we call Griller. We evaluated Griller in a controlled setting\nusing a benchmark of 48 known vulnerabilities across 5 open-source projects,\nwhere we successfully detected 28 known vulnerabilities. Additionally, we\nevaluated Griller on several real-world applications such as Pacman, and it\ndiscovered 6 previously unknown vulnerabilities.

    "abstract": "This paper studies an online learning problem that seeks optimal testing\npolicies for a stream of subjects, each of whom can be evaluated through a\nsequence of candidate tests drawn from a common pool. We refer to this problem\nas the Online Testing Problem (OTP). Although conducting every candidate test\nfor a subject provides more information, it is often preferable to select only\na subset when tests are correlated and costly, and make decisions with partial\ninformation. If the joint distribution of test outcomes were known, the problem\ncould be cast as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and solved exactly. In\npractice, this distribution is unknown and must be learned online as subjects\nare tested. When a subject is not fully tested, the resulting missing data can\nbias estimates, making the problem fundamentally harder than standard episodic\nMDPs. We prove that the minimax regret must scale at least as\n$\\Omega(T^{\\frac{2}{3}})$, in contrast to the $\\Theta(\\sqrt{T})$ rate in\nepisodic MDPs, revealing the difficulty introduced by missingness. This\nelevated lower bound is then matched by an Explore-Then-Commit algorithm whose\ncumulative regret is $\\tilde{O}(T^{\\frac{2}{3}})$ for both discrete and\nGaussian distributions. To highlight the consequence of missingness-dependent\nrewards in OTP, we study a variant called the Online Cost-sensitive Maximum\nEntropy Sampling Problem, where rewards are independent of missing data. This\nstructure enables an iterative-elimination algorithm that achieves\n$\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{T})$ regret, breaking the $\\Omega(T^{\\frac{2}{3}})$ lower\nbound for OTP. Numerical results confirm our theory in both settings. Overall,\nthis work deepens the understanding of the exploration--exploitation trade-off\nunder missing data and guides the design of efficient sequential testing\npolicies.",

Noticeably, most existing systems rely on full-precision models,\nwhich incur high computational and transmission costs, making them impractical\nfor real-time operation in resource-constrained environments. In this paper, we\nintroduce \\textbf{QuantV2X}, the first fully quantized multi-agent system\ndesigned specifically for efficient and scalable deployment of multi-modal,\nmulti-agent V2X cooperative perception. QuantV2X introduces a unified\nend-to-end quantization strategy across both neural network models and\ntransmitted message representations that simultaneously reduces computational\nload and transmission bandwidth. Remarkably, despite operating under low-bit\nconstraints, QuantV2X achieves accuracy comparable to full-precision systems.\nMore importantly, when evaluated under deployment-oriented metrics, QuantV2X\nreduces system-level latency by 3.2$\\times$ and achieves a +9.5 improvement in\nmAP30 over full-precision baselines.

    "abstract": "In the mid-1990s, the concept of smart growth emerged in the United States as\na critical response to the phenomenon of suburban sprawl. To promote\nsustainable urban development, it is necessary to further investigate the\nprinciples and applications of smart growth. In this paper, we propose a Smart\nGrowth Index (SGI) as a standard for measuring the degree of responsible urban\ndevelopment. Based on this index, we construct a comprehensive 3E evaluation\nmodel (covering economic prosperity, social equity, and environmental\nsustainability) to systematically assess the level of smart growth. For\nempirical analysis, we selected two medium-sized cities from different\ncontinents: Wuhu County, China, and Colima, Mexico. Using an improved entropy\nmethod, we evaluated the degree of smart growth in recent years and analyzed\nthe contributions of various policies to sustainable urban development. Guided\nby the ten principles of smart growth, we further linked theoretical insights\nto practical challenges and formulated a development plan for both cities. To\nforecast long-term trends, we employed trend extrapolation based on historical\ndata, enabling the prediction of SGI values for 2020, 2030, and 2050. The\nresults indicate that Wuhu demonstrates greater potential for smart growth\ncompared with Colima. We also simulated a scenario in which the population of\nboth cities increased by 50 percent and re-evaluated the SGI. The analysis\nsuggests that while rapid population growth tends to slow the pace of smart\ngrowth, it does not necessarily exert a negative impact on the overall\ntrajectory of sustainable development. Finally, we conducted a study on the\napplication of Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) theory in Wuhu County and\nproposed several policy recommendations aimed at enhancing the city's\nsustainable urban development.",

As a result, newly trained models may inherit and\nreinforce the biases of prior ranking models rather than genuinely improving\nrelevance. A standard approach to mitigate position bias is Inverse Propensity\nScoring (IPS), where the model's loss is weighted by the inverse of a\npropensity function, an estimate of the probability that an item at a given\nposition is examined. However, accurate propensity estimation is challenging,\nespecially in interfaces with complex non-linear layouts.

This approach offers a\ncost-effective alternative to online experimentation. Our experiments show that\npropensities estimated with our LLM-as-a-judge approach are stable across score\nbuckets and reveal the row-column effects of Viator's grid layout that simpler\nheuristics overlook.

To address this\nlimitation, we explore various explanations beyond content explanation, such as\n\"social explanation\" that considers the broader social context surrounding\nmisinformation, as well as a \"combined explanation\" where both the content and\nsocial explanations are presented in scenarios that are either aligned or\nmisaligned with each other.

Experimental investigations\nof rotating magnetoconvection (RMC) in the magnetostrophic regime are therefore\nessential to broadly characterize the properties of local-scale planetary core\nflow. Towards this end, we present here the first thermovelocimetric\nmeasurements of magnetostrophic, liquid metal convection, which are made using\nliquid gallium as the working fluid, at moderate rotation rates (Ekman numbers\n$10^{-4} \\leq Ek\\leq 10^{-5}$) and in the presence of dynamically strong\nmagnetic fields (Elsasser number $\\Lambda=1$). Complementary rotating\nconvection (RC) experiments are performed at the same rotation rates to serve\nas reference cases. Our RMC velocity measurements adequately follow a\ngeostrophic turbulent scaling for cases in which local-scale convective\ninertial forces exceed the Lorentz forces in the fluid bulk. In cases where\nLorentz forces exceed local-scale inertia ($N_\\ell \\gtrsim 3$), the\nroot-mean-square RMC velocities are magnetically damped, yielding values below\nthe geostrophic turbulent RC scaling prediction. An enhancement in heat\ntransfer is observed, which we attribute to the increased coherence of\nvertically aligned magnetostrophic convective flow. Extrapolating these\nlaboratory results, we predict that convection-scale flows in Earth's core\noccur in the magnetically damped $N_\\ell \\gtrsim 3$ regime with Rayleigh number\nvalues between $10^{24}$ and $10^{26}$.",

    "abstract": "Reliable and robust positioning of radio devices remains a challenging task\ndue to multipath propagation, hardware impairments, and interference from other\nradio transmitters. A frequently overlooked but critical factor is the agent\nitself, e.g., the user carrying the device, which potentially obstructs\nline-of-sight (LOS) links to the base stations (anchors). This paper addresses\nthe problem of accurate positioning in scenarios where LOS links are partially\nblocked by the agent. The agent is modeled as an extended object (EO) that\nscatters, attenuates, and blocks radio signals. We propose a Bayesian method\nthat fuses ``active'' measurements (between device and anchors) with\n``passive'' multistatic radar-type measurements (between anchors, reflected by\nthe EO). To handle measurement origin uncertainty, we introduce an multi-sensor\nand multiple-measurement probabilistic data association (PDA) algorithm that\njointly fuses all EO-related measurements. Furthermore, we develop an EO model\ntailored to agents such as human users, accounting for multiple reflections\nscattered off the body surface, and propose a simplified variant for\nlow-complexity implementation. Evaluation on both synthetic and real radio\nmeasurements demonstrates that the proposed algorithm outperforms conventional\nPDA methods based on point target assumptions, particularly during and after\nobstructed line-of-sight (OLOS) conditions.",

The\nreleased tracer is subsequently trapped again by the optical force. By\nrepeating the set of trap and release phases, we can accumulate the sequential\nimages of the tracer that have the same initial position. In this way, we can\nreduce the effect of statistical noise inherent in the Brownian motion of small\ntracers, thereby achieving both high spatial resolution and a high\nsignal-to-noise ratio, which are necessary for the analysis of extremely slow\nmicroflows, such as near-wall creeping flows.

    "abstract": "This paper considers two investors who perform mean-variance portfolio\nselection with asymmetric information: one knows the true stock dynamics, while\nthe other has to infer the true dynamics from observed stock evolution. Their\nportfolio selection is interconnected through relative performance concerns,\ni.e., each investor is concerned about not only her terminal wealth, but how it\ncompares to the average terminal wealth of both investors. We model this as\nStackelberg competition: the partially-informed investor (the \"follower\")\nobserves the trading behavior of the fully-informed investor (the \"leader\") and\ndecides her trading strategy accordingly; the leader, anticipating the\nfollower's response, in turn selects a trading strategy that best suits her\nobjective. To prevent information leakage, the leader adopts a randomized\nstrategy selected under an entropy-regularized mean-variance objective, where\nthe entropy regularizer quantifies the randomness of a chosen strategy. The\nfollower, on the other hand, observes only the actual trading actions of the\nleader (sampled from the randomized strategy), but not the randomized strategy\nitself. Her mean-variance objective is thus a random field, in the form of an\nexpectation conditioned on a realized path of the leader's trading actions. In\nthe idealized case of continuous sampling of the leader's trading actions, we\nderive a Stackelberg equilibrium where the follower's trading strategy depends\nlinearly on the actual trading actions of the leader and the leader samples her\ntrading actions from Gaussian distributions. In the realistic case of discrete\nsampling of the leader's trading actions, the above becomes an\n$\\epsilon$-Stackelberg equilibrium.",

    "abstract": "Background and Context: Programming process data can be utilized to\nunderstand the processes students use to write computer programming\nassignments. Keystroke- and line-level event logs have been used in the past in\nvarious ways, primarily in high-level descriptive statistics (e.g., timings,\ncharacter deletion rate, etc). Analysis of behavior in context (e.g., how much\ntime students spend working on loops) has been cumbersome because of our\ninability to automatically track high-level code representations, such as\nabstract syntax trees, through time and unparseable states.\n  Objective: Our study has two goals. The first is to design the first\nalgorithm that tracks parse tree nodes through time. Second, we utilize this\nalgorithm to perform a partial replication study of prior work that used manual\ntracking of code representations, as well as other novel analyses of student\nprogramming behavior that can now be done at scale.\n  Method: We use two algorithms presented in this paper to track parse tree\nnodes through time and construct tree representations for unparseable code\nstates. We apply these algorithms to a public keystroke data from student\ncoursework in a 2021 CS1 course and conduct analysis on the resulting parse\ntrees.\n  Findings: We discover newly observable statistics at scale, including that\ncode is deleted at similar rates inside and outside of conditionals and loops,\na third of commented out code is eventually restored, and that frequency with\nwhich students jump around in their code may not be indicative of struggle.\n  Implications: The ability to track parse trees through time opens the door to\nunderstanding new dimensions of student programming, such as best practices of\nstructural development of code over time, quantitative measurement of what\nsyntactic constructs students struggle most with, refactoring behavior, and\nattention shifting within the code.",

We present a comprehensive performance\nevaluation of these protocols in various network conditions for a range of\nquantum memory technologies.

We\nthen determine the total number of entangled pairs required to complete a\nmulti-round purification protocol, and the steady-state throughput of entangled\npairs with purified fidelities that exceed application-specific thresholds.\nThis provides latency budgets, memory quality targets, and resource-overhead\nestimates for deploying purification on current and near-future networks.",

Informed by PIC simulation, we develop a steady-state, 1D-axial\nfluid model of the sheath and presheath that also reproduces this V-P\ndependence. The V-P dependence is the relationship between the steady-state\nvoltage needed to maintain a constant discharge current and the neutral gas\npressure. V-P dependence is fundamental to device performance, but has not\npreviously been reproduced with simulation or satisfactorily explained. In this\nwork, we compare the V-P curve of our simulated device and fluid model with\npast experiments and then present a theoretical explanation for this V-P\ndependence. We find that the decrease in voltage with increasing pressure is\nnot due to electron recapture at the cathode. Rather, the constant current\ndictates a constant global ionization rate, so the voltage decrease compensates\nfor the increase in neutral gas density by lowering the energy of the plasma\nelectrons, which decreases their ionization probability. The PIC simulations\nalso reveal that the presheath and bulk plasma are unaffected by the electron\nreflection coefficient at the cathode; the only effect of increasing reflection\nis a reduction in the sheath voltage and width. In addition to the potential\nstructure, we explore how pressure affects the plasma density, particle drifts,\nand particle energy distributions.",

Using Normalized Pointwise Mutual Information (NPMI) and pretrained\nembeddings (e.g., ClinicalBERT, BioBERT), we examine whether frequently\nco-occurring concepts are also semantically close, whether embeddings can\nsuggest missing concepts, and how these relationships evolve temporally and\nacross specialties.

Clustering of concept embeddings\nyielded coherent clinical themes (symptoms, labs, diagnoses, cardiovascular\nconditions) that map to patient phenotypes and care patterns.

A common method of computing such manifolds in the\nliterature involves linear approximations of the manifolds, while the author's\npast work has developed a nonlinear manifold computation method under the\nassumption that the periodic orbit intersects the chosen Poincar\\'e section\nonly once. However, linear manifold approximations may require large amounts of\nnumerical integration for globalization, while the single-intersection\nassumption of the previous nonlinear method often does not hold.\n  In this paper, a parameterization method is developed and implemented for\ncomputing such stable and unstable manifolds even in the case of multiple\nperiodic orbit intersections with a chosen Poincar\\'e section. The method\ndeveloped avoids the need to compose polynomials with Poincar\\'e maps - a\nrequirement of some previous related algorithms - by using an intermediate step\ninvolving fixed-time maps. The step yields curves near the chosen Poincar\\'e\nsection lying on the flow's periodic orbit manifolds, which are used to\nparameterize and compute the Poincar\\'e map manifold curves themselves. These\nlast curves and parameterizations in turn enable highly-accurate computation of\nheteroclinics between periodic orbits. The method has already been used for\nvarious studies of resonant dynamics in the planar circular restricted 3-body\nproblem, which are briefly summarized in this paper, demonstrating the\nalgorithm's utility for real-world investigations.",

This is a\nset of nodes in the underlying network whose evolution determines the whole\nnetwork's dynamics after a transient time. In this paper, we focus on the case\nof Boolean networks. We define a reduced graph on the dominant vertices and an\ninduced automata network on this graph, which we prove is asymptotically\nequivalent to the original Boolean dynamics. Asymptotic conjugacy ensures that\nthe systems, restricted to their respective attractors, are dynamically\nequivalent. For a significant class of networks, the induced automata network\nis indeed a reduction of the original system. In these cases, the reduction,\nwhich is obtained from the structure of dominant vertices, supplies a more\ntractable system with the same structure of attractors as the original one.\nFurthermore, the structure of the induced system allows us to establish bounds\non the number and period of the attractors, as well as on the reduction of the\nbasin's sizes and transient lengths. We illustrate this reduction by\nconsidering a class of networks, which we call clover networks, whose dominant\nset is a singleton. To get insight into the structure of the basins of\nattraction of Boolean networks with a single dominant vertex, we complement\nthis work with a numerical exploration of the behavior of a parametrized\nensemble of systems of this kind.",

Among attribution methods, SHapley Additive\nexPlanations (SHAP) is widely regarded as an excellent attribution method; but\nits computational complexity, which scales exponentially with the number of\nfeatures, limits its practicality for long time series. To address this, recent\nstudies have shown that aggregating features via segmentation, to compute a\nsingle attribution value for a group of consecutive time points, drastically\nreduces SHAP running time. However, the choice of the optimal segmentation\nstrategy remains an open question. In this work, we investigated eight\ndifferent Time Series Segmentation algorithms to understand how segment\ncompositions affect the explanation quality. We evaluate these approaches using\ntwo established XAI evaluation methodologies: InterpretTime and AUC Difference.\nThrough experiments on both Multivariate (MTS) and Univariate Time Series\n(UTS), we find that the number of segments has a greater impact on explanation\nquality than the specific segmentation method. Notably, equal-length\nsegmentation consistently outperforms most of the custom time series\nsegmentation algorithms.

    "abstract": "We present a machine vision approach to quantify galaxy structure combining a\nvariational autoencoder (VAE) framework with principal component analysis\n(PCA). Using mock gri-band images from the EAGLE simulation, the VAE finds that\n35 features are needed to describe images. Adding the PCA, we identify an\noptimal range of 10-12 features needed to capture 99.9 per cent of the variance\nin galaxy morphology. The exact optimal number varies with galaxy complexity:\ndisk-dominated galaxies require 12 features, bulge-dominated galaxies need 9,\nand intermediate systems require 10-11 features. Correlations between extracted\nPCA features and structural measurements reveal that the VAE prioritizes galaxy\nsize during reconstruction, with half-light radius strongly correlating with\nthe highest-ranked principal components. Subsequent features capture\nmorphology-dependent characteristics: disk-dominated galaxies emphasize size,\nasymmetry, and position angle; bulge-dominated systems focus on size,\nconcentration, and axis ratio; while intermediate galaxies show enhanced\nattention to S\\'ersic index, indicating greater emphasis on accurately\nreproducing both disk and bulge structures. The PCA process significantly\nreduces the entanglement of the features compared to the raw VAE latent\nfeatures, decreasing the correlations with the half-light radius and the\nS\\'ersic index from 14.5\\pm1.0 and 6.0\\pm1.5 features, respectively, to only\n2.0\\pm1.0 components after PCA. Using UMAP technique, we construct 2D\nvisualizations that preserve neighborhood relationships from the\nhigh-dimensional feature space. This demonstrates that machine vision can\neffectively distinguish galaxy populations across different morphological\ntypes, including systems with atypical structures that may be overlooked by\ntraditional classification methods, providing a data-driven complement to\nconventional structural measurements.",

Existing approaches\npredominantly rely on text-only supervision, which fails to provide the\ngeometric constraints required for learning robust 3D spatial representations.\nIn this paper, we introduce Reg3D, a novel Reconstructive Geometry Instruction\nTuning framework that addresses this limitation by incorporating geometry-aware\nsupervision directly into the training process. Our key insight is that\neffective 3D understanding necessitates reconstructing underlying geometric\nstructures rather than merely describing them. Unlike existing methods that\ninject 3D information solely at the input level, Reg3D adopts a\ndual-supervision paradigm that leverages 3D geometric information both as input\nand as explicit learning targets. Specifically, we design complementary\nobject-level and frame-level reconstruction tasks within a dual-encoder\narchitecture, enforcing geometric consistency to encourage the development of\nspatial reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on ScanQA, Scan2Cap,\nScanRefer, and SQA3D demonstrate that Reg3D delivers substantial performance\nimprovements, establishing a new training paradigm for spatially aware\nmultimodal models.",

As a resource-efficient\nalternative, we present a revised version of the treeX algorithm, an\nunsupervised method that combines clustering-based stem detection with region\ngrowing for crown delineation. While the original treeX algorithm was developed\nfor personal laser scanning (PLS) data, we provide two parameter presets, one\nfor ground-based laser scanning (stationary terrestrial - TLS and PLS), and one\nfor UAV-borne laser scanning (ULS). We evaluated the method on six public\ndatasets (FOR-instance, ForestSemantic, LAUTx, NIBIO MLS, TreeLearn, Wytham\nWoods) and compared it to six open-source methods (original treeX, treeiso,\nRayCloudTools, ForAINet, SegmentAnyTree, TreeLearn). Compared to the original\ntreeX algorithm, our revision reduces runtime and improves accuracy, with\ninstance detection F$_1$-score gains of +0.11 to +0.49 for ground-based data.\nFor ULS data, our preset achieves an F$_1$-score of 0.58, whereas the original\nalgorithm fails to segment any correct instances. For TLS and PLS data, our\nalgorithm achieves accuracy similar to recent open-source methods, including\ndeep learning. Given its algorithmic design, we see two main applications for\nour method: (1) as a resource-efficient alternative to deep learning approaches\nin scenarios where the data characteristics align with the method design\n(sufficient stem visibility and point density), and (2) for the semi-automatic\ngeneration of labels for deep learning models.

Our approach extends the mode-shell correspondence,\noriginally formulated for single-particle Hamiltonians, to Gaussian states\nsubject to chiral constraints. In this correspondence, the mode index counts\ntopological boundary modes, while the shell index quantifies the bulk topology\nin a surrounding region, providing a bulk-boundary diagnostic. In\none-dimensional topological insulators, the shell index reduces to the local\nchiral marker, recovering the winding number in the translation-invariant\nlimit. We apply the mode-shell correspondence to a $C_4$-symmetric higher-order\ntopological insulator with a chiral constraint and show that a fractional shell\nindex implies that the higher-order phase is intrinsic. The one-particle\ndensity matrix is formulated in real space, so the mode-shell correspondence\napplies to models without translation invariance. By introducing structural\ndisorder into the $C_4$-symmetric higher-order insulator, we show that the\nmode-shell correspondence remains a meaningful diagnostic in the amorphous\nlimit. The mode-shell correspondence generalizes to interacting states with a\ngapped bulk spectrum in the one-particle density matrix, providing a practical\nand diverse route to characterize higher-order topology from the quantum state\nitself.",

    "abstract": "The third medium contact has been proven to be an effective approach for\nsimulating contact problems involving large deformations. Unlike traditional\ncontact algorithms, the third medium contact introduces a third medium between\ntwo contacting bodies, thereby avoiding the complex treatment of the contact\nconstraints. The approach has been successfully applied in different\napplications in the framework of the finite element method (FEM). As a\ngeneralization of the finite element method, the virtual element method (VEM)\ncan handle arbitrary polygonal elements, providing greater flexibility for\nmodeling third medium contact. However, due to the introduction of the\nprojection operator, VEM requires additional stabilization terms to control the\nrank of the stiffness matrix. Moreover, the regularization term in the third\nmedium contact formulation requires a second-order numerical scheme, which\nfurther complicates the application of VEM to such problems. In this work, the\nstabilization-free virtual element method (SFVEM) is developed and applied to\nsolve the third medium contact problems. Different from the traditional VEM,\nSFVEM does not require additional stabilization terms, which simplifies the\nconstruction of the regularization term in third medium contact. Building upon\nthe traditional second-order FEM framework, we present the specific format of\nSFVEM for solving third medium contact, including the construction of\nhigh-order projection operator and the tangent stiffness matrix. Numerical\nexamples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of\nSFVEM in solving complex 2D third medium contact problems.",

The differential cross section with respect to muon momentum is\nbased on a subset of selected events with the muon track fully contained in the\ndetector, whereas the cross section with respect to pion momentum is based on a\nsubset of selected events rich in pions that have not hadronically scattered on\nthe argon before coming to rest.

Atmospheric parameters (Teff 1650-2050 K,\nlog(g) 3.5-5.5) remain poorly constrained due to model differences and\nheterogeneous datasets. Aims. We refine the characterization of kAndb using\nmid-infrared data to capture its bolometric emission. Combined with NIR\nmeasurements, we constrain Teff, log(g), and radius to reduce uncertainties in\nage and mass. Methods. We obtained JWST/MIRI coronagraphic data (F1065C,\nF1140C, F1550C) and recalibrated NIR photometry with an updated ATLAS stellar\nmodel. MIRI color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) probe the likelihood of species\n(CH4, NH3, silicates). We compared H and F1140C colors and magnitudes to\nisochrones to constrain age and mass. We modeled the spectral energy\ndistribution with atmosphere models to refine Teff, radius, and log(g), and to\nconstrain age and mass using evolutionary models. Results. Cloudy atmosphere\nmodels fit best, consistent with the L0/L2 spectral type and position near\nsilicate-atmosphere field objects in the MIRI CMD. We derived an age of 47+-7\nMyr and mass of 17.3+-1.8 MJup by weighted-mean model combination. Modeling\nyielded Teff = 1791+-68 K and radius = 1.42+-0.06 RJup, improving precision by\n30%. Log(g) = 4.35+-0.07 dex represents a 70% improvement over the previous\nbest value (4.75+-0.25). Conclusions. The new mass places kAndb just above the\ndeuterium-burning limit. The age is 75% more precise and consistent with the\nColumba association (42 Myr). The Teff suggests silicate clouds, requiring\nspectroscopic confirmation. MIRI data were crucial to refining radius and\ntemperature, which led to stronger constraints on age and mass and improving\nthe overall characterization of kAndb.",

Then Gradient Suppression Fine\nTuning prunes those very bias directions from the backbone's gradients, leaving\na single compact network that ignores all the shortcuts it just learned to\nrecognize. Moreover we find that existing bias metrics break under subgroup\nimbalance and train test distribution shifts, so we introduce Scaled Bias\nAmplification (SBA): a test time measure that disentangles model induced bias\namplification from distributional differences. We validate GMBM on FB CMNIST,\nCelebA, and COCO, where we boost worst group accuracy, halve multi attribute\nbias amplification, and set a new low in SBA even as bias complexity and\ndistribution shifts intensify, making GMBM the first practical, end to end\nmultibias solution for visual recognition.

    "abstract": "Optical Character Recognition (OCR) in multilingual, noisy, and diverse\nreal-world images remains a significant challenge for optical character\nrecognition systems. With the rise of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs),\nthere is growing interest in their ability to generalize and reason beyond\nfixed OCR pipelines. In this work, we introduce Sprinklr-Edge-OCR, a novel OCR\nsystem built specifically optimized for edge deployment in resource-constrained\nenvironments. We present a large-scale comparative evaluation of five\nstate-of-the-art LVLMs (InternVL, Qwen, GOT OCR, LLaMA, MiniCPM) and two\ntraditional OCR systems (Sprinklr-Edge-OCR, SuryaOCR) on a proprietary, doubly\nhand annotated dataset of multilingual (54 languages) images. Our benchmark\ncovers a broad range of metrics including accuracy, semantic consistency,\nlanguage coverage, computational efficiency (latency, memory, GPU usage), and\ndeployment cost. To better reflect real-world applicability, we also conducted\nedge case deployment analysis, evaluating model performance on CPU only\nenvironments. Among the results, Qwen achieved the highest precision (0.54),\nwhile Sprinklr-Edge-OCR delivered the best overall F1 score (0.46) and\noutperformed others in efficiency, processing images 35 faster (0.17 seconds\nper image on average) and at less than 0.01 of the cost (0.006 USD per 1,000\nimages) compared to LVLM. Our findings demonstrate that the most optimal OCR\nsystems for edge deployment are the traditional ones even in the era of LLMs\ndue to their low compute requirements, low latency, and very high\naffordability.",

    "abstract": "Counting mitotic figures is time-intensive for pathologists and leads to\ninter-observer variability. Artificial intelligence (AI) promises a solution by\nautomatically detecting mitotic figures while maintaining decision consistency.\nHowever, AI tools are susceptible to domain shift, where a significant drop in\nperformance can occur due to differences in the training and testing sets,\nincluding morphological diversity between organs, species, and variations in\nstaining protocols. Furthermore, the number of mitoses is much less than the\ncount of normal nuclei, which introduces severely imbalanced data for the\ndetection task. In this work, we formulate mitosis detection as a pixel-level\nsegmentation and propose a teacher-student model that simultaneously addresses\nmitosis detection (Track 1) and atypical mitosis classification (Track 2). Our\nmethod is based on a UNet segmentation backbone that integrates domain\ngeneralization modules, namely contrastive representation learning and\ndomain-adversarial training. A teacher-student strategy is employed to generate\npixel-level pseudo-masks not only for annotated mitoses and hard negatives but\nalso for normal nuclei, thereby enhancing feature discrimination and improving\nrobustness against domain shift. For the classification task, we introduce a\nmulti-scale CNN classifier that leverages feature maps from the segmentation\nmodel within a multi-task learning paradigm. On the preliminary test set, the\nalgorithm achieved an F1 score of 0.7660 in Track 1 and balanced accuracy of\n0.8414 in Track 2, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating\nsegmentation-based detection and classification into a unified framework for\nrobust mitosis analysis.",

Using a functional renormalization group (FRG)\napproach, we demonstrate that the low-energy physics is controlled by a\nnonperturbative fixed point. The universal energy crossover in both the linear\nconductance and the impurity entropy is obtained. We reproduce the\nzero-frequency conductance and the leading low-energy exponent of the\nthree-channel Kondo model, confirming their universality across all\ntransparencies. For interacting leads -- a model that continuously connects to\nthe pseudo-gap Kondo model at low transparency -- we find a line of fixed\npoints as the Luttinger parameter $K$, which encodes the strength of the\ninteractions, changes.

Spectral sirens,\nusing GW data alone, can circumvent these limitations by leveraging features in\nthe mass distribution of compact binaries. With the recent release of the\nGravitational-Wave Transient Catalog 4 (GWTC-4.0), the number of significant\nbinary black hole (BBH) merger candidates has increased to 153, enabling more\nrobust population studies and cosmological constraints. This work builds upon\nprevious spectral siren analyses by analyzing the latest BBH observations with\nparametric and non-parametric models. In particular, we consider a parametric\napproach using the Powerlaw + Peak and Broken Powerlaw + 2 Peaks models as well\nas a more flexible non-parametric model based on Gaussian processes. We find\nbroad consistency in the inferred Hubble constant $H_0$ constraints across\nmodels.

Such engineered\nprofiles enable configurations that balance the high efficiency of sharp\nLorentzian resonances with the high power output of boxcar-like spectra,\nyielding near-optimal power-efficiency trade-offs. For symmetric quantum-dot\narrays in square, pentagonal, and hexagonal configurations, we identify an\noptimal regime, $t/\\gamma \\approx 2$, where the interdot tunneling amplitude\n$t$ and the dot-lead coupling $\\gamma$ yield the best balance of power and\nefficiency. A hexagonal six-dot configuration achieves $ZT \\sim 30$ at dilution\ntemperatures, while the four-dot geometry reaches about $76\\%$ of Carnot\nefficiency with output power $4.74$ fW. We also find a direct correspondence\nbetween the high-$ZT$ regime and maximal violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law.\nIntroducing source-drain coupling asymmetry further enhances both efficiency\nand power. A scaling analysis reveals that efficiency systematically increases\nwith the number of quantum dots, whereas power output is maximized at\nintermediate system sizes.

In primordial collapse, the threshold shift enters\nexponentially into the formation fraction, while the gap truncates the low-mass\ntail -- effects that may reshape the predicted mass spectrum.

    "abstract": "We revisit the momentum-resolved entanglement spectrum (ES) of the spin-1/2\nladder in the Haldane phase, long believed to exhibit a des Cloizeaux-Pearson\n(dCP)-type $\\sin|k|$ dispersion. Using exact diagonalization up to 40 spins, we\nresolve two distinct branches at $k=0$ and $k=\\pi$, which were previously\ninterpreted as a single smooth mode due to SU(2) degeneracy and limited\nresolution. Breaking SU(2) symmetry via XXZ anisotropy opens a spin or neutral\ngap at $k=\\pi$, depending on the anisotropy direction, triggering an\nentanglement quantum phase transition that is disconnected from the bulk\ncritical point. In the easy-plane regime, the entanglement ground state is\nunique in the $S_A^z=0$ sector but becomes quasi-degenerate across $S_A^z$\nsectors in the thermodynamic limit, consistent with spontaneous U(1) symmetry\nbreaking. This separation between bulk and entanglement transitions\ndemonstrates that the Li-Haldane correspondence can fail in topological\nladders, even at the level of low-energy dispersions. These results revise the\nprevailing picture of ES in spin ladders under extensive bipartitioning, and\nsuggest that the entanglement Hamiltonian, being nonlocal, can circumvent\nconventional constraints such as the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis and Mermin-Wagner\ntheorems.",

As evidence, we give examples in which disjoint\nadditivity is preserved when ordinary additivity is violated; we show that Haag\nduality and disjoint additivity are satisfied in rather general lattice systems\nwith local symmetry constraints; we give examples of nonlocal theories in which\neither disjoint additivity or Haag duality is violated; and finally we give\nexamples of systems with nonlocal symmetry constraints in which disjoint\nadditivity is violated, but can be restored by passing to a local \"SymTFT\"\nsystem in one higher dimension.",

We also draw on literature surveys\n(including XQ-100) of lower redshift quasars to investigate the possible\nevolution of this clustering towards cosmic noon (i.e., z~2-3). We find no\nsignificant evolution with redshift when considering the separation of\nabsorbers in velocity space. Since we are comparing data across a large\ninterval of cosmic time, we also consider the separation between absorbers in\nthe reference frame of physical distances. In this reference frame, we find\nthat the amplitude of the clustering increases with cosmic time for both C IV\nand Si IV on the scales of <1500 physical kpc. For the first time, we assess\nthe 2PCF of C IV and Si IV close to the epoch of reionisation utilising the\nabsorber catalogue from the E-XQR-30 survey. We compare this with lower\nredshift data and find that, on small scales, the clustering of these\nstructures grows with cosmic time. We compare these results to the clustering\nof galaxies in the GAEA simulations. It appears that the structures traced by C\nIV are broadly comparable to the galaxies from the considered simulations. The\nclustering is most similar to that of the galaxies with virial masses M~10^10.5\nM_sun.

Introducing a\nsecond moir\\'e pattern extends this paradigm: interference between the two\nmoir\\'e patterns produces a supermoir\\'e modulation, opening a route to further\ntailor electronic properties. Twisted trilayer graphene generally exemplifies\nsuch a system: two distinct moir\\'e patterns arise from the relative twists\nbetween adjacent graphene layers. Here, we report the observation of correlated\nphenomena across a wide range of twisted trilayer graphene devices whose twist\nangles lie along two continuous lines in the twist-angle parameter space.\nDepending on the degree of lattice relaxation, twisted trilayer graphene falls\ninto two classes: moir\\'e polycrystals, composed of periodic domains with\nlocally commensurate moir\\'e order, and moir\\'e quasicrystals, characterized by\nsmoothly varying local moir\\'e configurations. In helically twisted moir\\'e\npolycrystals, we observe an anomalous Hall effect, consistent with topological\nbands arising from domains with broken $xy$-inversion symmetry. In contrast,\nsuperconductivity appears generically in our moir\\'e quasicrystals. A subset of\nthese systems exhibits signatures of spatially modulated superconductivity,\nwhich we attribute to the supermoir\\'e structure. Our findings uncover the\norganizing principles of the observed correlated phases in twisted trilayer\ngraphene, highlight the critical roles of the supermoir\\'e modulation and\nlattice relaxation, and suggest a broader framework in which magic conditions\narise not as isolated points but as extended manifolds within the\nmulti-dimensional twist-angle space of complex moir\\'e materials.",

    "abstract": "Critical gravitational collapse offers a unique window into regimes of\narbitrarily high curvature, culminating in a naked singularity arising from\nsmooth initial data -- thus providing a dynamical counterexample to weak cosmic\ncensorship. Near the critical regime, quantum effects from the collapsing\nmatter are expected to intervene before full quantum gravity resolves the\nsingularity. Despite its fundamental significance, a self-consistent treatment\nhas so far remained elusive. In this work, we perform a one-loop semiclassical\nanalysis using the robust anomaly-based method in the canonical setup of\nEinstein gravity minimally coupled to a free, massless scalar field. Focusing\non explicitly solvable critical solutions in both 2+1 and 3+1 dimensions, we\nanalytically solve the semiclassical Einstein equations and provide definitive\nanswers to several long-standing questions. We find that regularity uniquely\nselects a Boulware-like quantum state, encoding genuine vacuum polarization\neffects from the collapsing matter. Remarkably, the resulting quantum\ncorrections manifest as a growing mode. Horizon-tracing analyses, incorporating\nboth classical and quantum modes, reveal the emergence of a finite mass gap,\nsignaling a phase transition from classical Type II to quantum-modified Type I\nbehavior, thereby providing a quantum enforcement of the weak cosmic\ncensorship. The most nontrivial aspect of our analysis involves dealing with\nnon-conformal matter fields in explicitly time-dependent critical spacetimes.\nAlong the way, we uncover intriguing and previously underexplored features of\nquantum field theory in curved spacetime.",

Recently, studies of this\nphenomenon have been extended beyond closed quantum systems to include\nenvironmental interactions, often modeled through non-Hermitian effects.\nHowever, because non-Hermitian descriptions neglect both quantum jump processes\nand interaction effects, the ultimate fate of interacting quantum systems under\nfull open-system quantum dynamics remains an open question. In this paper, by\nincorporating both interactions and full Liouvillian dynamics, we prove that\nDQPTs in open quantum systems remain robust when subject to either particle\nloss or particle gain alone, but are generically smeared out when both\nprocesses coexist, as a result of many-body particle backflow. Furthermore, we\nuncover a non-perturbative dynamical effect: even a weak admixture of gain\n(loss) into a system with loss (gain) can dramatically reshape the long-time\nbehavior of DQPT dynamics, leading to substantial deviations over time. These\nphenomena--including the universal smearing of DQPTs and the emergence of large\ndynamical deviations in the long-time limit--arise intrinsically from\nnon-equilibrium many-body effects in open quantum systems.

While the simplest explanation for LRDs is\nthat they are high redshift active galactic nuclei (AGN), due to their\ncompactness and frequent association with broad line emission, the lack of\ncorresponding X-ray emission and observed variability cast doubt on this\npicture. Here, we simulate LRD light curves using both traditional models for\nsub-Eddington AGN variability derived empirically from lower-redshift AGN\nobservations and moderately super-Eddington AGN disk models from radiation\nmagnetohydrodynamic simulations to examine the reason for the lack of\nvariability. We find that even though most LRDs have only been observed 2--4\ntimes in a given waveband, we should still be detecting significantly more\nvariability if traditional sub-Eddington AGN variability models can be applied\nto LRDs. Instead, our super-Eddington model light curves are consistent with\nthe lack of observed LRD variability. In addition, the ongoing high-cadence\n{\\sc nexus} campaign will detect changes in magnitude, $\\Delta m>1$, for\ntraditional sub-Eddington models, but will only observe significant continuum\nvariability for the lowest mass LRDs for our super-Eddington AGN models. Even\nif LRDs lack continuum variability, we find that the ongoing spectroscopic JWST\ncampaign {\\sc twinkle} should observe broad emission line variability as long\nas soft X-ray irradiation manages to reach the broad line region from the inner\ndisk. Our models show that super-Eddington accretion can easily explain the\nlack of continuum variability in LRDs.",

These interactions\ninherently incorporate spin-momentum locking and anisotropic spin\nsusceptibilities stemming from the Dirac-like dispersion of the TI surface\nelectrons. The analysis reveals that the interplay between the spin-orbit\ncoupling intrinsic to the TI and the magnetization texture in the FM layer\ninduces highly nonlocal and retarded, chiral, and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya\n(DM)-like contributions to the effective spin Hamiltonian. Furthermore, the\nspin dynamics is studied through a derivation of the LLG equation for this\nproblem. The induced interactions renormalize many of the FM's intrinsic\nproperties, but a term in the LLG equation is induced that is related to the\nrate of change of the magnetization's curl, which is relevant to skyrmion\ndynamics. The magnon dispersion exhibits modifications due to the TI-mediated\ninteractions, including tunable magnon gaps, sensitive to a tunable chemical\npotential and interfacial exchange coupling strength. The results also apply to\nfinite temperatures.

The\nmomentum dependence of the pairing gap, motivated by the running of the QCD\ncoupling and introduced similarly to chiral quark models with nonlocal\ninteraction, is a novel element of the model that is crucial for enabling the\nsimultaneous onset of all color-flavor quark states in the presence of color\nsuperconductivity. While asymptotically conformal behavior of the present model\nis ensured by construction, we demonstrate that reaching the conformal limit in\nagreement with the predictions of perturbative QCD is provided by the proper\nmomentum dependence of the thickness of the hadron shell in momentum space. We\nemploy the flexible meta-modeling approach to nuclear matter, analyzing the\nstructure of the hadron shell in momentum space and focusing on the effects of\ncolor superconductivity in quarkyonic matter. Similar to the effects induced by\nthe onset of the quarkyonic phase, color superconductivity leads to stiffening\nof the equation of state of the NS matter. This causes a significant impact on\nobservable properties of neutron stars, which are analyzed and compared to\nrecent astrophysical and theoretical constraints. We argue that the developed\nmodel of color-superconducting quarkyonic matter provides a new, consistent\ntool for studying the scenario of smooth quark-hadron transition in NSs.",

However, with the emerging advances of T2I models in reasoning\nbeyond composition, existing benchmarks reveal clear limitations in providing\ncomprehensive evaluations across and within these capabilities. Meanwhile,\nthese advances also enable models to handle more complex prompts, whereas\ncurrent benchmarks remain limited to low scene density and simplified\none-to-one reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose T2I-CoReBench, a\ncomprehensive and complex benchmark that evaluates both composition and\nreasoning capabilities of T2I models. To ensure comprehensiveness, we structure\ncomposition around scene graph elements (instance, attribute, and relation) and\nreasoning around the philosophical framework of inference (deductive,\ninductive, and abductive), formulating a 12-dimensional evaluation taxonomy. To\nincrease complexity, driven by the inherent complexities of real-world\nscenarios, we curate each prompt with high compositional density for\ncomposition and multi-step inference for reasoning. We also pair each prompt\nwith a checklist that specifies individual yes/no questions to assess each\nintended element independently to facilitate fine-grained and reliable\nevaluation. In statistics, our benchmark comprises 1,080 challenging prompts\nand around 13,500 checklist questions. Experiments across 27 current T2I models\nreveal that their composition capability still remains limited in complex\nhigh-density scenarios, while the reasoning capability lags even further behind\nas a critical bottleneck, with all models struggling to infer implicit elements\nfrom prompts.

This study examines whether WOMD accurately\ncaptures the dynamics and interactions observed in real-world AV operations.\nLeveraging an independently collected naturalistic dataset from Level 4 AV\noperations in Phoenix, Arizona (PHX), we perform comparative analyses across\nthree representative urban driving scenarios: discharging at signalized\nintersections, car-following, and lane-changing behaviors. For the discharging\nanalysis, headways are manually extracted from aerial video to ensure\nnegligible measurement error. For the car-following and lane-changing cases, we\napply the Simulation-Extrapolation (SIMEX) method to account for empirically\nestimated error in the PHX data and use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distances to\nquantify behavioral differences. Results across all scenarios consistently show\nthat behavior in PHX falls outside the behavioral envelope of WOMD. Notably,\nWOMD underrepresents short headways and abrupt decelerations. These findings\nsuggest that behavioral models calibrated solely on WOMD may systematically\nunderestimate the variability, risk, and complexity of naturalistic driving.\nCaution is therefore warranted when using WOMD for behavior modeling without\nproper validation against independently collected data.",

In this\nmodel, to each lattice bond $b$ there is assigned a bond variable $U_b\\in\nSU(N)$. Gluon fields are parameters in the Lie algebra of $SU(N)$. We define a\ncharge conjugation operator $\\mathcal C$ in the physical Hilbert space $H$ and\nprove that, for $N\\not=2$, $H$ admits an orthogonal decomposition into two\nsectors with charge conjugation $\\pm1$. There is only one sector for $N=2$. In\nthe space of correlations, a charge conjugation operator $C_E$ is defined and a\nsimilar decomposition holds. Besides, a version of Elitzur's theorem is shown;\napplications are given. It is proven that the expectation averages of two\ndistinct lattice vector potential correlators is zero. Surprisingly, the\nexpectation of two distinct field strength tensors is also zero. In the gluon\nfield parametrization it is known that Wilson action is bounded quadratically\nin the gluon fields. Towards solving the mass gap problem, in the gluon field\nexpansion of the action, we show there are no local terms, such as a mass term.\nHowever, the action associated with the exponent of the exponentiated Haar\nmeasure density has a positive local mass term which is proportional to the\nsquare of the gauge coupling $\\beta=g^{-2}>0$ and the $SU(N)$ quadratic Casimir\noperator eigenvalue. Our results also hold in dimension three. Of course, the\northogonal decomposition of the Hilbert space $H$ has consequences in the\nanalysis of the truncated two-point plaquette field correlation and the\nYang-Mills mass gap problem: for $N\\not=2$ and at least for small $\\beta$, a\nmultiplicity-two one-particle glueball state (two mass gaps) is expected to be\npresent in the energy-momentum spectrum of the Yang-Mills model.",

    "abstract": "The Rayleigh diffraction limit imposes a fundamental restriction on the\nresolution of direct imaging systems, hindering the identification of\nincoherent optical sources, such as celestial bodies in astronomy and\nfluorophores in bioimaging. Recent advances in quantum sensing have shown that\nthis limit can be circumvented through spatial demultiplexing (SPADE) and\nphoton detection. Notably, the latter is a semi-classical detection strategy,\nbeing SPADE a linear transformation of the field and photon detection a\nmeasurement of intensity. However, the general optimality for arbitrary\nintensity distributions and bright sources remains unproven. In this work, we\ndevelop a general model for incoherent light with arbitrary intensity collected\nby passive, linear optical systems. We employ this framework to compute the\nquantum Chernoff exponent for generic incoherent-source discrimination\nproblems, and we analyze several special cases, with particular focus on the\nsubdiffraction regime for Gaussian point-spread functions. We show that,\nsurprisingly, SPADE measurements do not always saturate the quantum Chernoff\nbound in the subdiffraction regime; the quantum optimality holds only when\ncertain compatibility conditions, such as covariance matrix commutativity, are\nmet. These findings suggest that collective measurements may actually be needed\nto achieve the ultimate quantum Chernoff bound for the discrimination of\nspecific incoherent sources. For the fully general case, our analysis can still\nbe used to find the best SPADE configurations, generally achieved through a\nhypotheses-dependent rotation of the SPADE modes.

This report presents LimiX, the first installment of our large\nstructured-data models (LDMs). LimiX treats structured data as a joint\ndistribution over variables and missingness, thus capable of addressing a wide\nrange of tabular tasks through query-based conditional prediction via a single\nmodel. LimiX is pretrained using masked joint-distribution modeling with an\nepisodic, context-conditional objective, where the model predicts for query\nsubsets conditioned on dataset-specific contexts, supporting rapid,\ntraining-free adaptation at inference. We evaluate LimiX across 10 large\nstructured-data benchmarks with broad regimes of sample size, feature\ndimensionality, class number, categorical-to-numerical feature ratio,\nmissingness, and sample-to-feature ratios. With a single model and a unified\ninterface, LimiX consistently surpasses strong baselines including\ngradient-boosting trees, deep tabular networks, recent tabular foundation\nmodels, and automated ensembles, as shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2. The\nsuperiority holds across a wide range of tasks, such as classification,\nregression, missing value imputation, and data generation, often by substantial\nmargins, while avoiding task-specific architectures or bespoke training per\ntask. All LimiX models are publicly accessible under Apache 2.0.",

    "abstract": "Accurately obtaining crop type and its spatial distribution at a global scale\nis critical for food security, agricultural policy-making, and sustainable\ndevelopment. Remote sensing offers an efficient solution for large-scale crop\nclassification, but the limited availability of reliable ground samples in many\nregions constrains applicability across geographic areas. To address\nperformance declines under geospatial shifts, this study identifies remote\nsensing features that are invariant to geographic variation and proposes\nstrategies to enhance cross-regional generalization. We construct CropGlobe, a\nglobal crop type dataset with 300,000 pixel-level samples from eight countries\nacross five continents, covering six major food and industrial crops (corn,\nsoybeans, rice, wheat, sugarcane, cotton). With broad geographic coverage,\nCropGlobe enables a systematic evaluation under cross-country, cross-continent,\nand cross-hemisphere transfer. We compare the transferability of temporal\nmulti-spectral features (Sentinel-2-based 1D/2D median features and harmonic\ncoefficients) and hyperspectral features (from EMIT). To improve generalization\nunder spectral and phenological shifts, we design CropNet, a lightweight and\nrobust CNN tailored for pixel-level crop classification, coupled with temporal\ndata augmentation (time shift, time scale, and magnitude warping) that\nsimulates realistic cross-regional phenology. Experiments show that 2D median\ntemporal features from Sentinel-2 consistently exhibit the strongest invariance\nacross all transfer scenarios, and augmentation further improves robustness,\nparticularly when training data diversity is limited.

    "abstract": "For RL algorithms, appropriate entropy control is crucial to their\neffectiveness. To control the policy entropy, a commonly used method is entropy\nregularization, which is adopted in various popular RL algorithms including\nPPO, SAC and A3C. Although entropy regularization proves effective in robotic\nand games RL conventionally, studies found that it gives weak to no gains in\nLLM-RL training. In this work, we study the issues of entropy bonus in LLM-RL\nsetting. Specifically, we first argue that the conventional entropy\nregularization suffers from the LLM's extremely large response space and the\nsparsity of the optimal outputs. As a remedy, we propose AEnt, an entropy\ncontrol method that utilizes a new clamped entropy bonus with an automatically\nadjusted coefficient. The clamped entropy is evaluated with the re-normalized\npolicy defined on certain smaller token space, which encourages exploration\nwithin a more compact response set. In addition, the algorithm automatically\nadjusts entropy coefficient according to the clamped entropy value, effectively\ncontrolling the entropy-induced bias while leveraging the entropy's benefits.\nAEnt is tested in math-reasoning tasks under different base models and\ndatasets, and it is observed that AEnt outperforms the baselines consistently\nacross multiple benchmarks.",

We focus on giant planets from\n30 $M_{\\oplus}$ to 10 $M_{Jup}$ on orbits from 0.3 to 30 AU, and assume that\neach planet is orbited by a moon with moon-planet mass ratio from $10^{-4}$ to\n$10^{-2}$ and separations from 0.1 to 0.5 planet Hill radii. We find that Roman\nis sensitive to exomoons, although the number of expected detections is only of\norder one over the duration of the survey, unless exomoons are more common or\nmassive than we assumed. We argue that changes in the survey strategy, in\nparticular focusing on a few fields with higher cadence, may allow for the\ndetection of more exomoons with Roman. Regardless, the ability to detect\nexomoons reinforces the need to develop robust methods for modeling triple lens\nmicrolensing events to fully utilize the capabilities of Roman.",

Here, we show that noise buildup in nonlinear\nmultimode systems can be strongly suppressed by controlling the input\nwavefront. We demonstrate this approach in a multimode fiber by using an active\nwavefront-shaping protocol to focus a region of high intensity - yet low\nintensity noise - at the output. Our programmable control of both the input and\noutput reduces the beam noise by 12 dB beyond what linear attenuation achieves,\nreaching levels near the quantum shot-noise limit. We show that this is\npossible because the optimally shaped wavefront maximally decouples the output\nintensity fluctuations from the input laser fluctuations. These findings are\nsupported by a new theoretical and simulation framework that efficiently\ncaptures spatiotemporal quantum noise dynamics in highly multimode nonlinear\nsystems.

    "abstract": "Using time-to-event methods such as Cox proportional hazards models, it is\nwell established that unmeasured heterogeneity in exposure or infection risk\ncan lead to downward bias in point estimates of the per-contact vaccine\nefficacy (VE) in infectious disease trials. In this study, we explore an\nunreported source of bias-arising from temporally correlated exposure\nstatus-that is typically unmeasured and overlooked in standard analyses.\nAlthough this form of bias can plausibly affect a wide range of VE trials, it\nhas received limited empirical attention. We develop a mathematical framework\nto characterize the mechanism of this bias and derive a closed-form\napproximation to quantify its magnitude without requiring direct measurement of\nexposure. Our findings show that, under realistic parameter settings, the\nresulting bias can be substantial. These results suggest that temporally\ncorrelated exposure should be recognized as a potentially important factor in\nthe design and analysis of infectious disease vaccine trials.",

    "abstract": "Inverse problems lie at the heart of modern imaging science, with broad\napplications in areas such as medical imaging, remote sensing, and microscopy.\nRecent years have witnessed a paradigm shift in solving imaging inverse\nproblems, where data-driven regularizers are used increasingly, leading to\nremarkably high-fidelity reconstruction. A particularly notable approach for\ndata-driven regularization is to use learned image denoisers as implicit priors\nin iterative image reconstruction algorithms. This survey presents a\ncomprehensive overview of this powerful and emerging class of algorithms,\ncommonly referred to as plug-and-play (PnP) methods. We begin by providing a\nbrief background on image denoising and inverse problems, followed by a short\nreview of traditional regularization strategies. We then explore how proximal\nsplitting algorithms, such as the alternating direction method of multipliers\n(ADMM) and proximal gradient descent (PGD), can naturally accommodate learned\ndenoisers in place of proximal operators, and under what conditions such\nreplacements preserve convergence. The role of Tweedie's formula in connecting\noptimal Gaussian denoisers and score estimation is discussed, which lays the\nfoundation for regularization-by-denoising (RED) and more recent\ndiffusion-based posterior sampling methods. We discuss theoretical advances\nregarding the convergence of PnP algorithms, both within the RED and proximal\nsettings, emphasizing the structural assumptions that the denoiser must satisfy\nfor convergence, such as non-expansiveness, Lipschitz continuity, and local\nhomogeneity. We also address practical considerations in algorithm design,\nincluding choices of denoiser architecture and acceleration strategies.",

    "abstract": "Differentially-Private SGD (DP-SGD) is a powerful technique to protect user\nprivacy when using sensitive data to train neural networks. During training,\nconverting model weights and activations into low-precision formats, i.e.,\nquantization, can drastically reduce training times, energy consumption, and\ncost, and is thus a widely used technique. In this work, we demonstrate that\nquantization causes significantly higher accuracy degradation in DP-SGD\ncompared to regular SGD. We observe that this is caused by noise injection in\nDP-SGD, which amplifies quantization variance, leading to disproportionately\nlarge accuracy degradation. To address this challenge, we present QPQuant, a\ndynamic quantization framework that adaptively selects a changing subset of\nlayers to quantize at each epoch. Our method combines two key ideas that\neffectively reduce quantization variance: (i) probabilistic sampling of the\nlayers that rotates which layers are quantized every epoch, and (ii) loss-aware\nlayer prioritization, which uses a differentially private loss sensitivity\nestimator to identify layers that can be quantized with minimal impact on model\nquality. This estimator consumes a negligible fraction of the overall privacy\nbudget, preserving DP guarantees. Empirical evaluations on ResNet18, ResNet50,\nand DenseNet121 across a range of datasets demonstrate that DPQuant\nconsistently outperforms static quantization baselines, achieving near\nPareto-optimal accuracy-compute trade-offs and up to 2.21x theoretical\nthroughput improvements on low-precision hardware, with less than 2% drop in\nvalidation accuracy.",

Despite its\nsignificance, limited public awareness of SL often leads to inequitable access\nto educational and professional opportunities, thereby contributing to social\nexclusion, particularly in Saudi Arabia, where over 84,000 individuals depend\non Saudi Sign Language (SSL) as their primary form of communication. Although\ncertain technological approaches have helped to improve communication for\nindividuals with hearing impairments, there continues to be an urgent\nrequirement for more precise and dependable translation techniques, especially\nfor Arabic sign language variants like SSL. Most state-of-the-art solutions\nhave primarily focused on non-Arabic sign languages, resulting in a\nconsiderable absence of resources dedicated to Arabic sign language,\nspecifically SSL. The complexity of the Arabic language and the prevalence of\nisolated sign language datasets that concentrate on individual words instead of\ncontinuous speech contribute to this issue. To address this gap, our research\nrepresents an important step in developing SSL resources.

    "abstract": "This work introduces SAM-LLM, a novel hybrid architecture that bridges the\ngap between the contextual reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the\nphysical precision of kinematic lane change models for autonomous driving. The\nsystem is designed for interpretable lane change trajectory prediction by\nfinetuning an LLM to output the core physical parameters of a trajectory model\ninstead of raw coordinates. For lane-keeping scenarios, the model predicts\ndiscrete coordinates, but for lane change maneuvers, it generates the\nparameters for an enhanced Sinusoidal Acceleration Model (SAM), including\nlateral displacement, maneuver duration, initial lateral velocity, and\nlongitudinal velocity change. This parametric approach yields a complete,\ncontinuous, and physically plausible trajectory model that is inherently\ninterpretable and computationally efficient, achieving an 80% reduction in\noutput size compared to coordinate-based methods. The SAM-LLM achieves a\nstate-of-the-art overall intention prediction accuracy of 98.73%, demonstrating\nperformance equivalent to traditional LLM predictors while offering significant\nadvantages in explainability and resource efficiency.",

Gaia data for $\\approx$400 previously cataloged candidate cluster\nstars allowed us to identify $\\approx$300 as members. With [Fe/H] measurements\nfor nine members, we found that Coma Ber has a solar metallicity, and then fit\nisochrones to its color--magnitude diagram to determine that it is 675$\\pm$100\nMyr old. With photometry obtained by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite\n(TESS) and Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), we measured rotation periods for\n137 of Coma Ber's low-mass stars, increasing the sample of members with\nmeasured periods by a factor of six, and extending the rotational census for\nthe cluster from its late F stars through to its fully convective M dwarfs. By\nmeasuring the equivalent width of the H$\\alpha$ line for $\\approx$250 stars and\ncollecting X-ray detections for $\\approx$100 ($\\approx$85% and $\\approx$33% of\nthe cluster's members, respectively), we characterized magnetic activity in\nComa Ber and examined the dependence of chromospheric and of coronal activity\non rotation in these stars. Despite having a metallicity that is 0.2 dex below\nthat of their coeval cousins in Praesepe and the Hyades, low-mass stars in Coma\nBer seem to follow a similar rotation--activity relation.

This work develops and applies an innovative methodological framework\nto model the occurrence of $T_x$ records and their relationship with\ngeopotential height fields. We used daily $T_x$ data from 36 Spanish stations\n(1960-2023) provided by ECA&D and geopotential height data at 300, 500, and 700\nhPa from ERA5. Exploratory analysis revealed a non-stationary trend in records,\na higher frequency in the interior of the peninsula, and decreasing spatial\nco-occurrence with distance. We designed a hierarchical spatio-temporal\nlogistic regression algorithm prioritizing interpretability and\nhigh-dimensionality reduction. The approach involves: (1) fitting local models\nper station; (2) applying a spatial consensus filter based on statistical\nsignificance to reduce the initial 1620 covariates to 17 in a base model (M1);\nand (3) a controlled incorporation of interaction terms. Among the tested\nmodels, a global model (M2) that enhances M1 with geodetic interactions was\nselected for its optimal balance between predictive performance (AUC) and\ncomplexity.

If the planet is a hycean world (liquid water\nocean + hydrogen-dominated atmosphere), it could be habitable under certain\nconditions. The presence of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen was already confirmed,\nhowever, there was no detection of nitrogen or its compounds. Molecular\nnitrogen is difficult to detect directly. This study concentrates on possible\nphotochemical products of N2 such as HCN, NH3 and HC3N. We set approximate\nlimits on the amount of nitrogen bearing species by varying atmospheric\nparameters, such as the Eddy Diffusion coefficient and the amount of N2 present\nfrom 10 ppm to 10%. If the bulk nitrogen-containing gas in the atmosphere is\nN2, photochemistry produces only trace amounts of the aforementioned species.\nHowever, if ammonia is the main source of nitrogen, then the quantities of NH3,\nCH5N and HCN approach detectable range. HC3N and NO are bad tracers of the\nnitrogen source in the atmosphere, because they are produced in similar amounts\nin all tested scenarios. Assuming equilibrium chemistry at the surface of\nK2-18b results in underprediction of CO2 abundance. This result combined with\nthe non-detection of ammonia by JWST suggests the planet is not a typical\nsub-Neptune, but could be indeed a hycean world or magma ocean planet.

Here we present an exact\nanalytical framework, supported by simulations, to characterize the steady\nstates of two-dimensional chiral active Brownian particles and\nthree-dimensional torque-driven counterparts in a harmonic trap. Using a\nLaplace-transform approach of the Fokker-Planck equation, we derive closed-form\nexpressions for displacement moments and excess kurtosis, providing a precise\nprobe of non-Gaussian statistics. Our analysis reveals three distinct regimes:\nbimodal active states with off-center peaks, Gaussian-like passive states, and\nweakly heavy-tailed distributions unique to two dimensions. We show that\ndimensionality plays a decisive role: in two dimensions, increasing chirality\nsuppresses activity and restores passive behavior, while in three dimensions\ntorque preserves activity along the torque axis, producing anisotropic steady\nstates. These behaviors are captured by simple active length-scale arguments\nthat map the boundaries between passive and active phases. Our results offer\nconcrete experimental signatures - including kurtosis crossovers, off-center\npeaks, and torque-induced anisotropy - that establish confinement as a powerful\ntool to probe and control chiral and torque-driven active matter.",

Here, we propose a GNN-based framework designed\nfrom the ground up to learn the dynamics of liquids under rigid body\ninteractions and active manipulations, where particles are represented as graph\nnodes and particle-object collisions are handled using surface representations\nwith the bounding volume hierarchy (BVH) algorithm. This approach enables the\nnetwork to model complex interactions between liquid particles and intricate\nsurface geometries. Our model accurately captures fluid behavior in dynamic\nsettings and can also function as a simulator in static free-fall environments.\nDespite being trained on a single-object manipulation task of pouring, our\nmodel generalizes effectively to environments with unseen objects and novel\nmanipulation tasks such as stirring and scooping.

The FSI model under consideration describes\nthe vibrations of an incompressible fluid within a 3D cavity as it interacts\nwith the elastic membrane on the ``free\" upper boundary of the cavity. Such\ncoupled PDE systems appear in variety of natural settings such as biomedicine,\naeroelasticity, and fluid dynamics.\n  Our proof of $C_0$-semigroup wellposedness is based on a proper application\nof Lumer Phillips Theorem. In this regard, our main challenge is to show the\nmaximality of the corresponding semigroup generator. To this end, we develop a\n``nonstandard\" inf-sup approach which avoids the use of technical nonlocal maps\nin the associated bilinear forms--unlike the earlier paper Avalos-Clark\n(2014)--and allows for the solution of the fluid and plate solution variables\nsimultanously. Our new inf-sup strategy will lead to a more efficient mixed\nfinite element method (FEM) for approximating solutions to the FSI problem,\ninasmuch our novel variational formulation avoids bilinear forms which are free\nfrom the computationally-intensive nonlocal solution operators invoked in\nAvalos-Clark (2014).

The proximity to a rational surface in a\nvery low shear region weakens field line bending stabilisation and amplifies\nthe effects of toroidal coupling between modes, leading to the emergence of\nlong-wavelength resistive infernal modes. These modes can grow collectively as\na discrete spectrum, leading to a cascade of different perturbations for single\nmode numbers $(m, n)$, with subdominant modes showing increasingly oscillatory\nradial structures. These spectra of fast-growing modes are significant for\ndeveloping stable scenarios in future reactors, and for the understanding of\nglobal reconnection events like sawteeth, motivating a deeper investigation\ninto their fundamental physics.

Our approach encodes the broadband nature of the\nnanocavity field through a non-Markovian memory kernel, derived from\nmacroscopic QED theory.

This dynamical\ncrossover is accompanied by the formation of single-photon interference\npatterns in frequency and time, propagating coherently over a timescale limited\nby the shape of kernel spectrum to $\\sim 100-150$ fs, which is accessible to\nultrafast spectroscopy. We also show that the stationary spectrum of the\ncoupled system can be manipulated by driving the nanocavity field using\ncoherent pulses with variable spectral bandwidth.

Aims: We focus on the S3 stream, a long ($\\sim30^\\circ$) and narrow\n($\\sim1.2^\\circ$) structure at 60-80 kpc, nearly aligned with the LMC. Our\ngoals are: 1) to validate the stream through a kinematic analysis of S3\ncandidates with Gaia DR3 data; 2) to enlarge the sample of potential members;\nand 3) to model the stream in order to test its association with either the MW\nor the LMC. Methods: We selected new S3 candidates with a neural network\nclassifier trained on Gaia DR3 data, and further reduced contamination through\na cut in the proper-motion space. To investigate the origin of S3, we evolve\nstream models within time-dependent, deforming MW and LMC haloes, thereby\naccounting for possible effects of the MW-LMC interaction. Results: We identify\n1,542 high-confidence new S3 stream candidates and find that the stream's\napparent width has grown from $\\sim1.2^\\circ$ to $\\sim3$-$4^\\circ$ compared to\nprevious studies. We also present a list of 440 potential S3 red clump stars,\nwhich are valuable targets for spectroscopic follow-up thanks to their\nwell-defined luminosities and ability to yield precise distances. Both\nmodelling and a comparison of S3 stars' closest approach distance and velocity\nwith the LMC's escape velocity indicate that S3 is unlikely to originate from\nthe LMC, instead representing a distant ($\\sim75$ kpc) MW stream. Conclusions:\nS3 is the most distant ($\\sim75$ kpc) extended ($\\sim30^\\circ$ long,\n$\\sim3$-$4^\\circ$ thick) MW stream known, offering a unique probe of the outer\nhalo and the LMC's recent influence.

We consider Toric Code states\ncorresponding to various planar graphs and apply non-local dientanglers to\nqubits corresponding to non-contractible cycles that satisfy a topological\nconstraint. We demonstrate that, independent of the geometry of the underlying\ngraph, disentanglers convert Toric Code states into a tensor product of\nKitaev's Ladder states. Since Kitaev's Ladders with arbitrary geometric\nconfigurations include the short-range entanglements, we conclude that the\nabove universal and non-local pattern of entanglement between ladders is\nresponsible of the long-range entanglement inherent in Toric Code states.

We review integrable structures for periodic boundary conditions\non both sides, while focusing on the eight- and six-vertex model and the\nbi-scalar fishnet theory. The latter is a double-scaled $\\gamma$-deformation of\n$\\mathcal{N} = 4$ super Yang-Mills theory. Interesting applications of\nintegrability existing in the literature that we reconsider are the computation\nof the free energy in the thermodynamic limit and its QFT counterpart, the\ncritical coupling. In addition, we provide a detailed overview of the\ncalculation of exact anomalous dimensions and operator product expansion (OPE)\ncoefficients in the conformal bi-scalar fishnet theory. The original\ncontributions of this work comprise the results of the critical coupling for\nmodels with fermions, the brick wall theory, and the fermionic fishnet theory.\nAdditionally, we extend the study of integrable Feynman graphs to\nsupersymmetric diagrams in superspace. By establishing an efficient graphical\nformalism, we obtain the critical coupling of double-scaled\n$\\beta$-deformations of $\\mathcal{N} = 4$ super Yang-Mills theory and\nAharony-Bergman-Jafferis-Maldacena theory, the super brick wall and\nsuperfishnet theory, respectively. Moreover, we apply superspace methods to the\nsuperfishnet theory and find results for anomalous dimensions and an OPE\ncoefficient, which are all-loop exact in the coupling. In addition, we study\nboundary integrability in the six-vertex model and for Feynman diagrams. We\npresent new box-shaped boundary conditions for the six-vertex model and\nconjecture a closed form for its partition function at any lattice size. On the\nQFT side, we find integrable boundary scattering matrices in the form of\ngeneralized Feynman diagrams by graphical methods.",

Twofold goals are examined; to understand the\nmechanism underlying successful pre-training and to determine the interplay\nbetween the pre-training accuracy and the fine-tuning of classification tasks.\nThe following main results were obtained; the accuracy per token (APT)\nincreased with its appearance frequency in the dataset, and its average over\nall tokens served as an order parameter to quantify pre-training success, which\nincreased along the transformer blocks. Pre-training broke the symmetry among\ntokens and grouped them into finite, small, strong match token clusters, as\ninferred from the presented token confusion matrix. This feature was sharpened\nalong the transformer blocks toward the output layer, enhancing its performance\nconsiderably compared with that of the embedding layer. Consequently,\nhigher-order language structures were generated by pre-training, even though\nthe learning cost function was directed solely at identifying a single token.\nThese pre-training findings were reflected by the improved fine-tuning accuracy\nalong the transformer blocks. Additionally, the output label prediction\nconfidence was found to be independent of the average input APT, as the input\nmeaning was preserved since the tokens are replaced primarily by strong match\ntokens. Finally, although pre-training is commonly absent in image\nclassification tasks, its underlying mechanism is similar to that used in\nfine-tuning NLP classification tasks, hinting at its universality.

Insights into these processes could pave the way for developing LMs\nwith knowledge representations that are more consistent, robust, and complete.\nTo facilitate studying these questions, we present LMEnt, a suite for analyzing\nknowledge acquisition in LMs during pretraining. LMEnt introduces: (1) a\nknowledge-rich pretraining corpus, fully annotated with entity mentions, based\non Wikipedia, (2) an entity-based retrieval method over pretraining data that\noutperforms previous approaches by as much as 80.4%, and (3) 12 pretrained\nmodels with up to 1B parameters and 4K intermediate checkpoints, with\ncomparable performance to popular open-sourced models on knowledge benchmarks.\nTogether, these resources provide a controlled environment for analyzing\nconnections between entity mentions in pretraining and downstream performance,\nand the effects of causal interventions in pretraining data. We show the\nutility of LMEnt by studying knowledge acquisition across checkpoints, finding\nthat fact frequency is key, but does not fully explain learning trends.

Methods. We select approximately 890,000 galaxies with r <= 20 mag\nand photometric redshifts in the range 0.05 <= z <= 0.20. Stellar masses and\nstar formation rates were derived through spectral energy distribution fitting\nwith CIGALE, confronted with spectroscopic samples. Galaxies are classified as\nstar-forming or quiescent based on their specific star formation rate (sSFR),\nadopting log(sSFR [yr^-1]) = -10.2. We compute SMFs for both populations using\nthe 1/Vmax method, apply completeness corrections, and fit Schechter functions.\nResults. The SMFs from J-PLUS DR3 are well described by Schechter functions and\nagree with previous photometric and spectroscopic studies. The characteristic\nmass for quiescent galaxies, log(M*/Msun) = 10.80, is 0.4 dex larger than that\nof star-forming galaxies. The faint-end slope is steeper for star-forming\ngalaxies (alpha = -1.2) than for quiescent ones (alpha = -0.7). The quiescent\nfraction rises by 40 percent per dex in stellar mass, reaching fQ > 0.95 at\nlog(M*/Msun) > 11. Comparisons with the GAEA semi-analytic model reveal an\nexcess of star-forming galaxies at intermediate masses. Conclusions. J-PLUS DR3\nstellar mass functions and quiescent fractions are consistent with the\nliterature and provide robust constraints for galaxy formation models.\nQuiescent galaxies represent 45 percent of number density above log(M*) > 9,\nbut 75 percent of stellar mass density.

The proposed model leverages smartphone\nsensors such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, and GPS to provide a non-invasive,\ncontinuous solution for detecting impaired driving patterns in real time. This\nstudy adapts existing data processing and pattern matching methodologies to\nlabel real-world driving data collected from Nigerian drivers, which are then\nused to train the model. A decision tree classifier is developed to detect\nalcohol influence, based on behavioural and temporal features, achieving a\nrecall of 100%, a precision of 60%, and an F1 score of 75%. The model's overall\naccuracy was 90.91%, ensuring that no alcohol influenced trips were missed. Key\npredictive features included speed variability, course deviation, and time of\nday, which align with established patterns of alcohol consumption. This study\ncontributes to the field by demonstrating how machine learning can be applied\nin low-resource environments to improve road safety. The findings suggest that\nthe model can significantly enhance the detection and prevention of risky\ndriving behaviours, with the potential for future integration into mobile\napplications to provide real-time feedback and encourage safer driving\npractices.

We perform detailed Monte Carlo\npost-processing nucleosynthesis calculations based on updated thermonuclear\nreaction rates and uncertainties from the 2025 evaluation.

Competition for shared resources such\nas last-level cache, memory bandwidth, and network interfaces often leads to\nsevere performance degradation. Existing management techniques, including VM\nscheduling and resource provisioning, require accurate performance prediction\nto mitigate interference.

CloudFormer jointly models temporal dynamics and\nsystem-level interactions, leveraging 206 system metrics at one-second\nresolution across both static and dynamic scenarios.

Experimental\nresults demonstrate that CloudFormer consistently outperforms state-of-the-art\nbaselines across multiple evaluation metrics, achieving robust generalization\nacross diverse and previously unseen workloads.

Given the complexity\nof modern healthcare data, representing data as a graph may provide a more\nnatural and effective approach. This study models patient data from the\nwell-known MIMIC-III dataset as a heterogeneous graph that evolves over time.\nSubsequently, we explore two Graph Neural Network architectures - GraphSAGE and\nGATv2 - for learning patient state representations, adopting the approach of\ndecoupling representation learning from policy learning. The encoders are\ntrained to produce latent state representations, jointly with decoders that\npredict the next patient state. These representations are then used for policy\nlearning with the dBCQ algorithm. The results of our experimental evaluation\nconfirm the potential of a graph-based approach, while highlighting the\ncomplexity of representation learning in this domain.",

By developing a\ndecentralized dissipative force model, our approach enables autonomous\nformation stabilization and adaptive load allocation without the requirement of\nexplicit communication.

In real-world experiments with six flying\nrobots, the cooperative aerial transportation system achieved a 94% success\nrate under single-robot failure, disconnection events, 25% payload variation,\nand 40% cable length uncertainty, demonstrating strong robustness under outdoor\nwinds up to Beaufort scale 4.

Integrating orbits in the\nGalactic potential and propagating the astrometric and radial-velocity\nuncertainties of 30 million Gaia stars, we identify 25 encounters with median\nencounter distances less than 1 pc. However, because the encounter speeds\nbetween 3I/ATLAS and each encounter exceed 20 km/s, none is a plausible host\nunder common ejection mechanisms. We infer stellar masses for most stars and\nquantify the gravitational perturbations exerted by each individual star or\neach binary system on 3I/ATLAS.

Among all past encounters, the binary's\nbarycenter and 3I/ATLAS reach the small encounter distance of 0.242 pc and the\nencounter speed of 28.39 km/s,1.64 Myr ago. We further demonstrate that the\ncumulative influence of the stellar encounters on both the speed and direction\nof 3I/ATLAS is weak.

To overcome this\nchallenge, we demonstrate that the solutions of convex QPs can be localized\nwithin a feasible region corresponding to a special active set, utilizing\nCaratheodory's theorem. Building on such observation, we propose the unrolled\nactive set method, which models the computation of the optimal value as a\nGoldberg-Jerrum (GJ) algorithm with bounded complexities, thereby establishing\nlearning guarantees. We then further extend our analysis to other settings,\nincluding learning to match the optimal solution and input-aware setting, where\nwe learn a mapping from QP problem instances to projection matrices.",

    "abstract": "Interfacial thermal transport is a critical bottleneck in nanoscale systems,\nwhere heat dissipation and energy efficiency are strongly modulated by\nmolecular ordering at solid-liquid boundaries. Here, using atomistic\nsimulations of hexadecane confined by structured silica substrates, we reveal\nhow interfacial geometry, specifically curvature, governs the density\ndistribution and thermal transport across the interface. At flat and mildly\ncurved surfaces, the liquid exhibits surface-templated layering, promoting\nefficient heat transfer, which is enhanced with increasing contact surface\narea. As curvature increases, this ordering breaks down, giving rise to\ninterference-like density patterns, reduced molecular packing, and localized\ndepletion zones. This structural reorganization leads to a systematic increase\nin interfacial thermal resistance (ITR), even when the contact area is kept\nconstant. By decomposing the interface into convex (\"hill\" of solid) and\nconcave (\"valley\" of solid) regions, we find that valleys consistently offer\nlower thermal resistance. In contrast, hills act as bottlenecks to heat flow.\nRemarkably, we show that the work of adhesion and entropy-related energy losses\nscale non-trivially with curvature: while adhesion increases with contact area,\nthe entropic penalty dominates the total energy change, reflecting\ncurvature-induced frustration of molecular alignment. These findings unveil a\ndirect link between surface geometry, thermodynamic dissipation, and heat\ntransport, offering new design principles for thermally tunable nanostructured\nmaterials, thermal interface coatings, and phase-change systems.",

In\nthis paper, targeting the semi-structured sparsity, we introduce a Silent Until\nSparse (SUS) backdoor attack, where the released full model remains silent\n(benign), but becomes a backdoored model after sparsification. The attack\noperates in two phases: (i) in the backdoor training phase, the backdoor\nfunctionality is injected into specific weights that will be retained during\nthe pruning process; (ii) in the backdoor hiding phase, the malicious behavior\nis concealed by fine-tuning elements that will be pruned away.

This is the first method that does not rely on external\nauxiliary information or assumptions about the underlying data distribution.\nCRA leverages the utility-optimizing behavior of local recoding anonymization\nof ARX, which is a widely used open-source software for anonymizing data in\nclinical settings, to formulate a linear program that significantly reduces the\nspace of plausible sensitive values. To validate our findings, we partnered\nwith a network of free community health clinics, an environment where (1)\nauxiliary information is indeed hard to find due to the population they serve\nand (2) open-source k-anonymity solutions are attractive due to regulatory\nobligations and limited resources.

    "abstract": "Reasoning is a core capability in artificial intelligence systems, for which\nlarge language models (LLMs) have recently shown remarkable progress. However,\nmost work focuses exclusively on deductive reasoning, which is problematic\nsince other types of reasoning are also essential in solving real-world\nproblems, and they are less explored. This work focuses on evaluating LLMs'\ninductive and abductive reasoning capabilities. We introduce a programmable and\nsynthetic dataset, InAbHyD (pronounced in-a-bid), where each reasoning example\nconsists of an incomplete world model and a set of observations. The task for\nthe intelligent agent is to produce hypotheses to explain observations under\nthe incomplete world model to solve each reasoning example. We propose a new\nmetric to evaluate the quality of hypotheses based on Occam's Razor. We\nevaluate and analyze some state-of-the-art LLMs. Our analysis shows that LLMs\ncan perform inductive and abductive reasoning in simple scenarios, but struggle\nwith complex world models and producing high-quality hypotheses, even with\npopular reasoning-enhancing techniques such as in-context learning and RLVR.",

Analyzing these in reverse, that is, separating them into\ncontributions from pairs, triples, or larger groups, is typically intricate and\nseldom pursued. However, this could offer essential insights into the\nstructural architecture of complex systems, such as soft materials. This\ncontribution tackles this issue employing a new simulation-based approach to\naccurately determine effective interactions. The approach is sufficiently\nsensitive to assess the effects of higher-order terms in the depletion\npotentials between large particles. Previous research has primarily focused on\nthe role of small particles, and this work expands on these findings. However,\nunderstanding the contributions of large particles on the effective forces,\nparticularly beyond the dilute limit, remains challenging and is not yet fully\ngrasped, leading us to primarily focus on exploring this topic. Within the\nrange of particle concentrations examined here, while maintaining a constant\nchemical potential for smaller particles, we have observed that the\nconcentration of larger particles has no impact on the entropic potential\nbetween large colloids, as long as the size ratio remains below $q=0.15$. This\nconfirms a long-established prediction founded on purely geometric\nconsiderations, which we have confirmed by means of direct observation. In\ncontrast, for mixtures with less size asymmetry, such effects become\nconsiderably influential. Specifically, we have conducted an in-depth\nexamination of scenarios with size asymmetries of $q=0.45$ and $0.60$. Our\nresults for the depletion forces were directly compared with those obtained\nfrom the integral equation theory, which has also enabled us to improve and\nrefine the approaches involved.",

Matrix integer-valued autoregression (MINAR)\nmodel captures row-column cross-correlations and reduces the number of\nparameters to be estimated.

To solve the limitations of the MINAR model described\nabove, this paper proposes the reduced-rank matrix integer-valued\nautoregression (RRMINAR) model. Reducing rank is achieved by adding low-rank\nconstraints to the coefficient matrices in the MINAR model, leading to RRMINAR\nreducing parameter quantity while incorporating matrix structure information.\nWe develop an iterative conditional least squares estimation and analyze its\nasymptotic properties. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed RRMINAR\nmodel exhibits more robust parameter estimation and higher prediction accuracy\nthan MGINAR and MINAR models when the data structure is low-rank.

This paper\nintroduces VulnRepairEval, an evaluation framework anchored in functional\nProof-of-Concept (PoC) exploits. Our framework delivers a comprehensive,\ncontainerized evaluation pipeline that enables reproducible differential\nassessment, where repair success requires the original exploit to fail\nexecution against the modified code. The benchmark construction involved\nextensive data curation: we processed over 400 CVEs and approximately 2,500\npotential sources to extract a collection of authentic vulnerability instances\n(23 Python CVEs) amenable to automated testing with working PoCs. Through\nVulnRepairEval, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 12 popular LLMs and\nobserve a significant performance deficit: even the top-performing model\nsuccessfully addresses merely 5/23 instances (about 21.7%), exposing critical\nweaknesses in security-focused applications. Our failure analysis reveals that\nmost unsuccessful attempts stem from imprecise vulnerability identification and\npatches containing syntactic or semantic errors. Enhanced prompting strategies\nand multi-agent approaches yield minimal improvements, with overall\neffectiveness remaining largely unaffected.

We\nintroduce a novel, culturally-grounded framework for detecting social biases in\ninstruction-tuned LLMs. Our approach adapts the underspecified question\nmethodology from the BBQ dataset by incorporating culturally-specific\nexpressions and sayings that encode regional stereotypes across four social\ncategories: gender, race, socioeconomic class, and national origin.

To our knowledge, our work\npresents the first systematic evaluation examining how leading commercial LLMs\nrespond to culturally specific bias in the Spanish language, revealing varying\npatterns of bias manifestation across state-of-the-art models.

The contrast of the\ndisc-free reductions was measured, and forward modelling was used to estimate\nthe signal loss from over-subtraction using synthetic pole-on discs with two\ndifferent widths and four different radii. The signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of\nthe real disc targets was measured. Results: Diverse reference libraries built\nusing subsets of frames that closely matched different parameters achieved the\nbest disc S/N and smallest deviation from the best contrast of each target,\noutperforming libraries built using a single criterion as a selection metric.\nLibraries built using frame-to-frame Pearson correlation coefficient alone as a\nselection criterion achieved the best mean contrast overall. Both selection\nmetrics performed consistently well for all disc radii and observational\nconditions.

In this paper, we formalize semantic\nlifting and semantic reflection for a small programming language, SMOL, explain\nthe operational aspects of the language, and consider type correctness and\nvirtualisation for runtime program queries through the semantic reflection\nlayer. We illustrate semantic lifting and semantic reflection through a case\nstudy of geological modelling and discuss different applications of the\ntechnique. The language implementation is open source and available online.",

It has\nreceived significant attention for capturing complex non-linear relationships\nand interactions among predictors. However, the accuracy of BART often comes at\nthe cost of interpretability. To address this limitation, we propose ANOVA\nBayesian Additive Regression Trees (ANOVA-BART), a novel extension of BART\nbased on the functional ANOVA decomposition, which is used to decompose the\nvariability of a function into different interactions, each representing the\ncontribution of a different set of covariates or factors. Our proposed\nANOVA-BART enhances interpretability, preserves and extends the theoretical\nguarantees of BART, and achieves superior predictive performance. Specifically,\nwe establish that the posterior concentration rate of ANOVA-BART is nearly\nminimax optimal, and further provides the same convergence rates for each\ninteraction that are not available for BART. Moreover, comprehensive\nexperiments confirm that ANOVA-BART surpasses BART in both accuracy and\nuncertainty quantification, while also demonstrating its effectiveness in\ncomponent selection. These results suggest that ANOVA-BART offers a compelling\nalternative to BART by balancing predictive accuracy, interpretability, and\ntheoretical consistency.",

The purpose of this work was to extend gMicroMC to support multiple\npulse simulations and Flash dose rates, and to investigate, in a pure water\nmodel, the mechanisms underlying the enhancement of radical-radical reactions\nunder Flash conditions. gMicroMC, a GPU-based Monte Carlo track-structure\nalgorithm, was extended to simulate multiple pulses. Pure water was exposed to\nmultiple 70 MeV protons pulses delivering up to 20 Gy. The pulse dose rate was\nset to 2*10^5 and 10^6 Gy/s, while the average dose rate ranged from 0.01 to\n100000 Gy/s. The G-values of H2O2 were used to monitor the influence of dose\nrate on radical-radical reactions. The multiple pulse extension of gMicroMC was\nvalidated against Kinetiscope. Multiple pulse simulations indicated an average\ndose rate threshold. Below it, complete radical depletion occurred within the\npulses, leading to constant G-values. Above it, reactive species accumulated\nthroughout the irradiation, resulting in an increase of radical-radical\nreactions and thus the G-values of H2O2. The average dose rate thresholds were\nin the order of 10 and 100 Gy/s for pulse dose rates of 2*10^5 and 10^6 Gy/s,\nrespectively. At ultra-high dose rates, the brief intervals between pulses led\nto a reactive species build-up, which enhanced radical-radical reactions. This\nbuild-up is more likely to promote radical-radical reactions than the\ninter-track mechanism.

However, FL is vulnerable to poisoning attacks, where\nByzantine clients compromise the integrity of the global model by submitting\nmalicious updates. Robust aggregation methods have been widely adopted to\nmitigate such threats, relying on the core assumption that malicious updates\nare inherently out-of-distribution and can therefore be identified and excluded\nbefore aggregating client updates. In this paper, we challenge this underlying\nassumption by showing that a model can be poisoned while keeping malicious\nupdates within the main distribution. We propose Chameleon Poisoning (CHAMP),\nan adaptive and evasive poisoning strategy that exploits side-channel feedback\nfrom the aggregation process to guide the attack. Specifically, the adversary\ncontinuously infers whether its malicious contribution has been incorporated\ninto the global model and adapts accordingly. This enables a dynamic adjustment\nof the local loss function, balancing a malicious component with a camouflaging\ncomponent, thereby increasing the effectiveness of the poisoning while evading\nrobust aggregation defenses. CHAMP enables more effective and evasive\npoisoning, highlighting a fundamental limitation of existing robust aggregation\ndefenses and underscoring the need for new strategies to secure federated\nlearning against sophisticated adversaries.

Both approaches are also compared to traditional\nsummary statistics, in this case histograms of kinematic and angular\nobservables, as commonly used in experimental analyses. SBI methods provide\ntighter constraints than one-dimensional summary statistics, though their\nperformance is comparable to two-dimensional histogram analysis. The\noptimal-observable approach remains promising for its ability to probe multiple\ncouplings simultaneously. Restricting the analysis to a region of high $S/B$\nalso enhances sensitivity to CP-odd operators while preserving sensitivity to\nCP-even operators, which histogram analyses often lose.

    "abstract": "Agent-based models (ABMs) simulate complex systems by capturing the bottom-up\ninteractions of individual agents comprising the system. Many complex systems\nof interest, such as epidemics or financial markets, involve thousands or even\nmillions of agents. Consequently, ABMs often become computationally demanding\nand rely on the calibration of numerous free parameters, which has\nsignificantly hindered their widespread adoption. In this paper, we demonstrate\nthat automatic differentiation (AD) techniques can effectively alleviate these\ncomputational burdens. By applying AD to ABMs, the gradients of the simulator\nbecome readily available, greatly facilitating essential tasks such as\ncalibration and sensitivity analysis. Specifically, we show how AD enables\nvariational inference (VI) techniques for efficient parameter calibration. Our\nexperiments demonstrate substantial performance improvements and computational\nsavings using VI on three prominent ABMs: Axtell's model of firms; Sugarscape;\nand the SIR epidemiological model. Our approach thus significantly enhances the\npracticality and scalability of ABMs for studying complex systems.",

This\nnovel force corrects the electromagnetic vertex, leading to an effective\ncoupling which is flavor off-diagonal at tree level. Consequently, it yields\nthe CLFV decays with a very strongly amplified sensitivity, allowing for the\nCLFV probes in the small flavor-violating parameter region which is out of\nreach of the previous models.

This is followed by slow algebraic\ndecay $\\sim n^{-1/2}$ with the number of Floquet cycles $n$.

    "abstract": "AI is transforming the healthcare domain and is increasingly helping\npractitioners to make health-related decisions. Therefore, accountability\nbecomes a crucial concern for critical AI-driven decisions. Although regulatory\nbodies, such as the EU commission, provide guidelines, they are highlevel and\nfocus on the ''what'' that should be done and less on the ''how'', creating a\nknowledge gap for actors. Through an extensive analysis, we found that the term\naccountability is perceived and dealt with in many different ways, depending on\nthe actor's expertise and domain of work. With increasing concerns about AI\naccountability issues and the ambiguity around this term, this paper bridges\nthe gap between the ''what'' and ''how'' of AI accountability, specifically for\nAI systems in healthcare. We do this by analysing the concept of\naccountability, formulating an accountability framework, and providing a\nthree-tier structure for handling various accountability mechanisms. Our\naccountability framework positions the regulations of healthcare AI systems and\nthe mechanisms adopted by the actors under a consistent accountability regime.\nMoreover, the three-tier structure guides the actors of the healthcare AI\nsystem to categorise the mechanisms based on their conduct. Through our\nframework, we advocate that decision-making in healthcare AI holds shared\ndependencies, where accountability should be dealt with jointly and should\nfoster collaborations. We highlight the role of explainability in instigating\ncommunication and information sharing between the actors to further facilitate\nthe collaborative process.",

Seeds are\nbred out of Pop-III stars formed during the first collapse of pristine gas in\nmini-halos that have reached the ${\\rm H}_2$-cooling limit, modulated by UV\nradiation from star formation and dynamical heating from fast halo assembly.\nSuch breeding persists until the enrichment of the intergalactic medium (IGM)\nenables Pop-II stars to form. Post-seeding growth of black holes (BHs) is\ndriven by distinct channels, starting with episodic super-Eddington accretion\nassociated with nuclear bursts induced by global disturbances of galaxies,\nfollowed by sustained sub-Eddington accretion via capturing sub-clouds formed\nin self-gravitating gas clouds (SGCs) in halos of fast assembly, and ending\nwith merger-dominated, quiescent growth. We implement the model in subhalo\nmerger trees to build a coherent framework to follow the SMBH-galaxy-halo\nco-evolution over their full lives in the full structure hierarchy. BH seeds\nare bred with a broad mass spectrum of $M_{\\rm BH} = 10$--$10^5\\,{\\rm M}_\\odot$\nat $z \\approx 20$--$30$ in mini-halos with masses of $10^5$--$10^8\\,{\\rm\nM}_\\odot$.

The $M_{\\rm BH}$-$M_*$ relation is a multi-piece, redshift-dependent\nfunction shaped by the interplay among different growth channels.

    "abstract": "While spiking neural networks (SNNs) provide a biologically inspired and\nenergy-efficient computational framework, their robustness and the dynamic\nadvantages inherent to biological neurons remain significantly underutilized\nowing to oversimplified neuron models. In particular, conventional leaky\nintegrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons often omit the dynamic conductance mechanisms\ninherent in biological neurons, thereby limiting their capacity to cope with\nnoise and temporal variability. In this work, we revisit dynamic conductance\nfrom a functional perspective and uncover its intrinsic role as a biologically\nplausible gating mechanism that modulates information flow. Building on this\ninsight, we introduce the Dynamic Gated Neuron~(DGN), a novel spiking unit in\nwhich membrane conductance evolves in response to neuronal activity, enabling\nselective input filtering and adaptive noise suppression. We provide a\ntheoretical analysis showing that DGN possess enhanced stochastic stability\ncompared to standard LIF models, with dynamic conductance intriguingly acting\nas a disturbance rejection mechanism.

This is particularly true for\ndebugging due to quantum bugs, i.e., bugs that occur precisely because an\nalgorithm is a quantum algorithm. Pinpointing a quantum bug's root cause often\nrequires significant developer time, as there is little established guidance\nfor quantum debugging techniques. Developing such guidance is the main\nchallenge we sought to address. In this work, we describe a set of 14 quantum\nbugs, sourced primarily from our experience as quantum software developers, and\nsupplemented by analysis of open-source GitHub repositories. We detail their\ncontext, symptoms, and the techniques applied to identify and fix them. While\nclassifying these bugs based on existing schemes, we observed that most emerged\ndue to unique interactions between multiple aspects of an algorithm or\nworkflow. In other words, they occurred because more than one thing went wrong,\nwhich provided important insight into why quantum debugging is more\nchallenging.

To this end, we propose a unified framework to comprehensively\ndetect and segment 3D anomalies by leveraging both point- and pixel-level\ninformation. We first design PointAD, which leverages point-pixel\ncorrespondence to represent 3D anomalies through their associated rendering\npixel representations. This approach is referred to as implicit 3D\nrepresentation, as it focuses solely on rendering pixel anomalies but neglects\nthe inherent spatial relationships within point clouds. Then, we propose\nPointAD+ to further broaden the interpretation of 3D anomalies by introducing\nexplicit 3D representation, emphasizing spatial abnormality to uncover abnormal\nspatial relationships. Hence, we propose G-aggregation to involve geometry\ninformation to enable the aggregated point representations spatially aware. To\nsimultaneously capture rendering and spatial abnormality, PointAD+ proposes\nhierarchical representation learning, incorporating implicit and explicit\nanomaly semantics into hierarchical text prompts: rendering prompts for the\nrendering layer and geometry prompts for the geometry layer. A cross-hierarchy\ncontrastive alignment is further introduced to promote the interaction between\nthe rendering and geometry layers, facilitating mutual anomaly learning.\nFinally, PointAD+ integrates anomaly semantics from both layers to capture the\ngeneralized anomaly semantics. During the test, PointAD+ can integrate RGB\ninformation in a plug-and-play manner and further improve its detection\nperformance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of PointAD+ in\nZS 3D anomaly detection across unseen objects with highly diverse class\nsemantics, achieving a holistic understanding of abnormality.",

    "abstract": "The growing integration of large language models across professional domains\ntransforms how experts make critical decisions in healthcare, education, and\nlaw. While significant research effort focuses on getting these systems to\ncommunicate their outputs with probabilistic measures of reliability, many\nconsequential forms of uncertainty in professional contexts resist such\nquantification. A physician pondering the appropriateness of documenting\npossible domestic abuse, a teacher assessing cultural sensitivity, or a\nmathematician distinguishing procedural from conceptual understanding face\nforms of uncertainty that cannot be reduced to percentages. This paper argues\nfor moving beyond simple quantification toward richer expressions of\nuncertainty essential for beneficial AI integration. We propose participatory\nrefinement processes through which professional communities collectively shape\nhow different forms of uncertainty are communicated. Our approach acknowledges\nthat uncertainty expression is a form of professional sense-making that\nrequires collective development rather than algorithmic optimization.",

    "abstract": "Chromonic liquid crystals (CLCs) are lyotropic materials which are attracting\ngrowing interest for their adaptability to living systems. A considerable body\nof works has been devoted to exploring their properties and applications. In\nthis paper, I endeavour to review some of the contributions concerning their\ntheoretical modelling, aimed at rationalizing experimental observations. The\nelastic theory of CLCs is not completely established. Their ground state in the\n3D space, as revealed by a number of recent experiments, is quite different\nfrom that of ordinary nematic liquid crystals: it is twisted instead of\nuniform. The common explanation provided for this state within the classical\nOseen-Frank elastic theory demands that one Ericksen's inequality is violated.\nSince such a violation would make the Oseen-Frank stored energy density\nunbounded below, the legitimacy of these theoretical treatments is threatened\nby a number of mathematical issues. To overcome these difficulties, a novel\nelastic theory has been proposed and tested for CLCs; it extends the classical\nOseen-Frank energy by incorporating a quartic twist term. Another key\ncharacteristic of CLCs is that they exhibit broad biphasic regions, in which\nthe nematic and isotropic phases coexist. Mathematical models inspired by\nexperimental settings have been developed for CLC droplets in 2D. The\ncontributions reviewed here address the morphogenesis of nuclei and topological\ndefects during phase transitions, the topological shape transformations arising\nfrom the interplay of nematic elastic constants, and the prediction of shape\nbistability (yet to be observed) where tactoids and smooth-edged discoids can\ncoexist in equilibrium. General methods have also been applied to experimental\ndata to extract estimates of the isotropic surface tension at the nematic\nisotropic interface and the chromonics' planar anchoring strength.",

This approach enables\nflexible estimation of self-heating under various practical conditions, such as\ndifferent substrate materials, interfacial thermal resistances, and geometric\nlayouts.

However, ensuring constraint satisfaction is\nchallenging for nonlinear systems/constraints. A well-known tool to make\ncontrollers safe is the so-called control-invariant set (a.k.a. safe set).

We solve\nseveral MPC problems at the same time, where each problem instantiates the\nsafe-set constraint at a different time step along the horizon.

This paper introduces\nHyPV-LEAD (Hyperbolic Peak-Valley Lead-time Enabled Anomaly Detection), a\ndata-driven early-warning framework that explicitly incorporates lead time into\nanomaly detection. Unlike prior methods, HyPV-LEAD integrates three\ninnovations: (1) window-horizon modeling to guarantee actionable lead-time\nalerts, (2) Peak-Valley (PV) sampling to mitigate class imbalance while\npreserving temporal continuity, and (3) hyperbolic embedding to capture the\nhierarchical and scale-free properties of blockchain transaction networks.\nEmpirical evaluation on large-scale Bitcoin transaction data demonstrates that\nHyPV-LEAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a\nPR-AUC of 0.9624 with significant gains in precision and recall.

    "abstract": "The $GW$ approximation has become a method of choice for predicting\nquasiparticle properties in solids and large molecular systems, owing to its\nfavorable accuracy-cost balance. However, its accuracy is the result of a\nfortuitous cancellation of vertex corrections in the polarizability and\nself-energy. Hence, when attempting to go beyond $GW$ through inclusion of\nvertex corrections, the accuracy can deteriorate if this delicate balance is\ndisrupted. In this work, we explore an alternative route that theoretically\ngoes beyond $GW$: the parquet formalism. Unlike approaches that focus on a\nsingle correlation channel, such as the electron-hole channel in $GW$ or the\nparticle-particle channel in $T$-matrix theory, parquet theory treats all\ntwo-body scattering channels on an equal footing. We present the formal\nstructure of the parquet equations, which couple the one-body Green's function,\nthe self-energy, and the two-body vertex. We discuss the approximations\nnecessary to solve this set of equations, the advantages and limitations of\nthis approach, outline its implementation for molecular systems, and assess its\naccuracy for principal ionization potentials of small molecular systems.",

    "abstract": "(abridged) The acceleration of particles at the Sun and their propagation\nthrough interplanetary space are key topics in heliophysics. Specifically,\nsolar energetic electrons (SEEs) measured in situ can be linked to solar flares\nand coronal mass ejections (CMEs), which can be observed remotely in radio,\noptical, UV and X-rays. Solar Orbiter, equipped with a wide range of\nremote-sensing and in situ detectors, provides an excellent opportunity to\ninvestigate SEEs and their solar origin from the inner heliosphere. The\nComprehensive Solar Energetic Electron event Catalogue (CoSEE-Cat) provides\ndetails for all SEE events measured in situ by Solar Orbiter, as well as\nassociated flares, CMEs, and radio bursts. The catalogue contains key\nparameters of the SEEs, as derived from the Energetic Particle Detector (EPD),\ncomplemented with basic parameters of associated X-ray flares provided by STIX,\ninformation on eruptive phenomena seen by EUI, characteristics of type III\nradio bursts observed by RPW, and indications of CME observed by Metis and\nSoloHI. The conditions in interplanetary space were characterised using SWA and\nMAG measurements. Finally, data-driven modelling with the Magnetic Connectivity\nTool provided an independent estimate of the solar source position of the SEEs.\nThe first data release contains 303 SEE events observed from November 2020\nuntil the end of 2022. In this paper, we describe the catalogue and provide a\nfirst statistical analysis. Preliminary results support the flare-related\norigin of events with an impulsive ion composition and the association of\ngradual events with extended structures such as CME-driven shocks or erupting\nflux ropes. We also show that the commonly observed delays of the solar release\ntimes of the SEEs relative to the associated X-ray flares and type III radio\nbursts are at least partially due to propagation effects.",

    ],
    "abstract": "We introduce the Cut-Based Valuation (CBV), a unified framework for\nconsolidated value in equity/flow networks. The central idea is that economic\nvalue is never absolute: it is always defined relative to an observer Omega,\nwhich fixes perimeter, measurement basis, units/FX/PPP, discounting,\ninformational regime, and control rules. Given Omega, the Cut Theorem shows\nthat the consolidated value of a perimeter P depends only on boundary\nquantities across the cut P -> O, while internal reconnections are\nvaluation-invariant. This provides (i) sufficient statistics for valuation with\nlinear computational complexity, (ii) standardized reporting through the\nPerimeter-of-Validity and Cut Summary, and (iii) transformation laws that\nclarify how different observers relate. Applications span IFRS consolidation,\nnational accounts, fund-of-funds, pyramids, and clearing networks, all seen as\nspecial cases of a general principle of economic relativity. Case studies\n(market capitalization by country, keiretsu, fund-of-funds) illustrate how CBV\neliminates double counting while ensuring comparability and auditability.\n  To address practical concerns, we establish robustness bounds that quantify\nhow errors in initial data propagate to consolidated values, and we introduce a\ndynamic CBV-Fisher protocol for intertemporal comparisons, ensuring consistency\nwith official chain-linking practices. These additions clarify the time scale\nof application, the role of averaging procedures, and the horizon of reliable\nmeasurement. Finally, we make explicit the scope and limitations of CBV: it is\na normative measurement/consolidation rule in linear accounting environments,\nwhile in macroeconomic closures or with nonlinear payoffs it must be coupled\nwith equilibrium or clearing models.",

A major unsolved problem, addressed in this\npaper, is how to devise representational-system (RS) agnostic techniques that\ndrive representation transformation and choice. We present a novel calculus,\ncalled structure transfer, that enables representation transformation across\ndiverse RSs. Specifically, given a source representation drawn from a source\nRS, the rules of structure transfer allow us to generate a target\nrepresentation for a target RS. The generality of structure transfer comes in\npart from its ability to ensure that the source representation and the\ngenerated target representation satisfy any specified relation (such as\nsemantic equivalence). This is done by exploiting schemas, which encode\nknowledge about RSs. Specifically, schemas can express preservation of\ninformation across relations between any pair of RSs, and this knowledge is\nused by structure transfer to derive a structure for the target representation\nwhich ensures that the desired relation holds. We formalise this using\nRepresentational Systems Theory, building on the key concept of a construction\nspace. The abstract nature of construction spaces grants them the generality to\nmodel RSs of diverse kinds, including formal languages, geometric figures and\ndiagrams, as well as informal notations. Consequently, structure transfer is a\nsystem-agnostic calculus that can be used to identify alternative\nrepresentations in a wide range of practical settings.",

    "abstract": "Testing Deep Learning (DL)-based systems is an open challenge. Although it is\nrelatively easy to find inputs that cause a DL model to misbehave, the grouping\nof inputs by features that make the DL model under test fail is largely\nunexplored. Existing approaches for DL testing introduce perturbations that may\nfocus on specific failure-inducing features, while neglecting others that\nbelong to different regions of the feature space. In this paper, we create an\nexplicit topographical map of the input feature space. Our approach, named\nTopoMap, is both black-box and model-agnostic as it relies solely on features\nthat characterise the input space. To discriminate the inputs according to the\nspecific features they share, we first apply dimensionality reduction to obtain\ninput embeddings, which are then subjected to clustering. Each DL model might\nrequire specific embedding computations and clustering algorithms to achieve a\nmeaningful separation of inputs into discriminative groups. We propose a novel\nway to evaluate alternative configurations of embedding and clustering\ntechniques. We used a deep neural network (DNN) as an approximation of a human\nevaluator who could tell whether a pair of clusters can be discriminated based\non the features of the included elements. We use such a DNN to automatically\nselect the optimal topographical map of the inputs among all those that are\nproduced by different embedding/clustering configurations. The evaluation\nresults show that the maps generated by TopoMap consist of distinguishable and\nmeaningful regions. In addition, we evaluate the effectiveness of TopoMap using\nmutation analysis. In particular, we assess whether the clusters in our\ntopographical map allow for an effective selection of mutation-killing inputs.\nExperimental results show that our approach outperforms random selection by 35%\non average on killable mutants; by 61% on non-killable ones.",

In\nthis paper, we consider the entanglement of cat-state-like throughout states,\nwhich can be generated in magnon systems with parametric pumps beyond the\nparametric stable intensities.

This\nstudy presents a method to examine their persuasive capabilities. We designed\nan experimental framework focused on decision making and tested it in a pilot\nthat varied robot appearance and self-knowledge. Using qualitative analysis, we\nevaluated interaction quality, persuasion effectiveness, and the robot's\ncommunicative strategies. Participants generally experienced the interaction\npositively, describing the robot as competent, friendly, and supportive, while\nnoting practical limits such as delayed responses and occasional\nspeech-recognition errors. Persuasiveness was highly context dependent and\nshaped by robot behavior: Participants responded well to polite, reasoned\nsuggestions and expressive gestures, but emphasized the need for more\npersonalized, context-aware arguments and clearer social roles. These findings\nsuggest that generative social robots can influence user decisions, but their\neffectiveness depends on communicative nuance and contextual relevance. We\npropose refinements to the framework to further study persuasive dynamics\nbetween robots and human users.",

    "abstract": "Complex systems of interacting components often can be modeled by a simple\ngraph $\\mathcal{G}$ that consists of a set of $n$ nodes and a set of $m$ edges.\nSuch a graph can be represented by an adjacency matrix $A\\in\\R^{n\\times n}$,\nwhose $(ij)$th entry is one if there is an edge pointing from node $i$ to node\n$j$, and is zero otherwise. The matrix $A$ and its positive integer powers\nreveal important properties of the graph and allow the construction of the path\nlength matrix $L$ for the graph. The $(ij)$th entry of $L$ is the length of the\nshortest path from node $i$ to node $j$; if there is no path between these\nnodes, then the value of the entry is set to $\\infty$. We are interested in how\nwell information flows via shortest paths of the graph. This can be studied\nwith the aid of the path length matrix. The path length matrix allows the\ndefinition of several measures of communication in the network defined by the\ngraph such as the global $K$-efficiency, which considers shortest paths that\nare made up of at most $K$ edges for some $K<n$, as well as the number of such\nshortest paths. Novel notions of connectivity introduced in this paper help us\nunderstand the importance of specific edges for the flow of information through\nthe graph. This is of interest when seeking to simplify a network by removing\nselected edges or trying to assess the sensitivity of the flow of information\nto changes due to exterior causes such as a traffic stoppage on a road network.",

This paper presents\nNeurStore, a novel in-database model management system that enables efficient\nstorage and utilization of deep learning models. First, NeurStore employs a\ntensor-based model storage engine to enable fine-grained model storage within\ndatabases.

Finally, we devise a compression-aware model loading\nmechanism, which improves model utilization performance by enabling direct\ncomputation on compressed tensors. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that\nNeurStore achieves superior compression ratios and competitive model loading\nthroughput compared to state-of-the-art approaches.",

The key advantages of the model include the appearance of a weakly\ninteracting massive particle (WIMP) like dark matter (DM) candidate from the\nneutral component of the IHD, along with the plausible explanation of the\nsub-eV mass range of SM neutrinos via the radiative seesaw mechanism.\nAdditionally, the decay of RHNs can contextualize the baryon asymmetry of the\nuniverse via leptogenesis and is intricately connected to CP violation. Also,\ngiven the ongoing searches for light scalars at various experimental\nfacilities, the extended Higgs sector of the model continues to be at the\nforefront. However, this scotogenic framework encounters a deficiency in\nproviding the observed amount of relic density for a particular mass range\n$\\sim (80 - 500) $ GeV of its DM candidate, hence requiring further\naugmentation. Also, the WIMP scenarios have not yet resulted in conclusive\nhints at the direct detection experiments. In this context, our work is based\non further extension of the above Scotogenic model by a dark sector.\nAdditionally, considering the cosmic coincidence aspect, we operate within the\nframework of two-sector leptogenesis. To have a predictive flavor structure in\nthe visible sector, we impose $A_4$ symmetry. Also, we adhere to spontaneous CP\nviolation via complex vacuum expectation value of the falvon field, leading to\na situation where there is only one CP-violating phase as a common connection\nbetween the visible and dark sectors. In our analysis, we find for the lightest\nRHN mass $\\sim 10^{10}$ GeV, our results are in good agreement with the\nobservational ratio of relic densities, i.e., $\\Omega_{\\rm DM}/\\Omega_{\\rm b}\n\\sim 5$ for a few GeV range of mass of the dark sector DM candidate.",

    "abstract": "Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) over high-dimensional vectors is a\nfoundational problem in databases, where disk I/O often emerges as the dominant\nperformance bottleneck at scale. Existing graph indexing solutions for\ndisk-based ANNS typically either optimize the storage layout for a given graph\nor construct the graph independently of the storage layout, thus overlooking\ntheir interaction. In this paper, we propose the Block-aware Monotonic Relative\nNeighborhood Graph (BMRNG), a novel graph structure that jointly considers both\ngeometric distance and storage layout for edge selection, theoretically\nguaranteeing the existence of I/O monotonic search paths. To address the\nscalability challenge of BMRNG construction, we further develop a practical and\nefficient variant, the Block-Aware Monotonic Graph (BAMG), which can be\nconstructed in linear time from a monotonic graph considering the storage\nlayout. BAMG integrates block-aware edge pruning with a decoupled storage\ndesign that separates raw vectors from the graph index, thereby maximizing\nblock utilization and minimizing redundant disk reads. Additionally, we design\na multi-layer navigation graph for adaptive and efficient query entry, along\nwith a block-first search algorithm that prioritizes intra-block traversal to\nfully exploit each disk I/O operation. Extensive experiments on real-world\ndatasets demonstrate that BAMG achieves up to 2.1x higher throughput and\nreduces I/O reads by up to 52% compared to state-of-the-art methods, while\nmaintaining comparable recall.",

This\nbecomes especially crucial for challenging long-horizon mobile manipulation\ntasks that require whole-body coordination. We compare two distinct robot\ncontrol paradigms: a coupled embodiment integrating arm manipulation and base\nnavigation functions, and a decoupled embodiment treating these systems as\nseparate control entities. Additionally, we evaluate two visual feedback\nmechanisms: immersive virtual reality and conventional screen-based\nvisualization of the robot's field of view. These configurations were\nsystematically assessed across a complex, multi-stage task sequence requiring\nintegrated planning and execution. Our results show that the use of VR as a\nfeedback modality increases task completion time, cognitive workload, and\nperceived effort of the teleoperator. Coupling manipulation and navigation\nleads to a comparable workload on the user as decoupling the embodiments, while\npreliminary experiments suggest that data acquired by coupled teleoperation\nleads to better imitation learning performance.

In this paper, we propose a bounded reachability\nanalysis algorithm for compositional hybrid systems with piecewise affine\ndynamics, based on the principle of counterexample guided abstraction\nrefinement (CEGAR). In particular, the algorithm searches for a counterexample\nin the discrete abstraction of the composition model, without explicitly\ncomputing a product automaton. When a counterexample is discovered in the\nabstraction, its validity is verified by a refinement of the state-space guided\nby the abstract counterexample. The state-space refinement is through a\nsymbolic reachability analysis, particularly using a state-of-the-art algorithm\nwith support functions as the continuous state representation. In addition, the\nalgorithm mixes different semantics of composition with the objective of\nimproved efficiency. Step compositional semantics is followed while exploring\nthe abstract (discrete) state-space, while shallow compositional semantics is\nfollowed during state-space refinement with symbolic reachability analysis.\nOptimizations such as caching the results of the symbolic reachability\nanalysis, which can be later reused, have been proposed.

    "abstract": "Double degenerate white dwarf (WD) mergers can exhibit extreme magnetic\nfields exceeding $10^{8}$ G and rapid rotation, but their spectral-energy\ndistributions and high-energy emission mechanisms remain poorly characterised.\nZTF J1901+1458 stands out as the most compact and strongly magnetised object\ndiscovered in this class to date. Recent Chandra observations have revealed\nthat the white dwarf is also a source of soft X-ray emission, inconsistent with\na photospheric origin. We analyse new phase resolved UV spectroscopy from the\nHST combined with optical and near-infrared photometry and spectroscopy, with\nnewly developed magnetic atmosphere models to determine its effective\ntemperature, radius, mass, average surface magnetic field strength, and cooling\nage. Our results demonstrate that the spectral break at $\\approx$3000 {\\AA},\nobserved in several highly magnetised WDs, is well-reproduced by our new\nmodels, which take into account the effect of magnetic opacities on the\nstructure of the atmosphere. Our best-fit parameters for the WD yield an\neffective temperature ($T_{\\rm{eff}}=28,015\\pm 20$ K) and larger radius\n($2630\\pm10$ km) than previously reported. Furthermore, the near-infrared data\nexclude the presence of a stellar or brown dwarf companion hotter than\n$\\approx$700 K. We also jointly analyse the previously published Chandra data\nand new XMM-Newton X-ray spectra. The faint X-ray emission, $L_X\n=(1.3\\pm0.2)\\times10^{27}$ erg/s is very soft and highly pulsed on the rotation\nperiod of the WD. We suggest that the X-rays are powered by accretion or via\nthe interaction of the WD magnetosphere with CSM. If the rapidly rotating\nmagnetic field could power a weak wind along open field lines, material could\nbe extracted directly from the surface of the WD. Alternatively, accretion of\nfallback material from the merger or the tidal disruption of a planetary body\nare possible sources of CSM.",

To\ntackle this, we introduce an active training framework designed to selectively\nextract training data from diverse environments, thereby reducing the training\nload and enhancing model generalization. Our framework is based on two key\nstrategies: Initial Training Set Selection (ITSS) and Active Incremental\nSelection (AIS). ITSS begins by breaking down motion sequences from general\nweather into nodes and edges for detailed trajectory analysis, prioritizing\ndiverse sequences to form a rich initial training dataset for training the base\nmodel. For complex sequences that are difficult to analyze, especially under\nchallenging snowy weather conditions, AIS uses scene reconstruction and\nprediction inconsistency to iteratively select training samples, refining the\nmodel to handle a wide range of real-world scenarios. Experiments across\ndatasets and weather conditions validate our approach's effectiveness. Notably,\nour method matches the performance of full-dataset training with just 52\\% of\nthe sequence volume, demonstrating the training efficiency and robustness of\nour active training paradigm.

The emerging shift\ncurrent model, involving the transfer of photogenerated charges through the\ndisplacement of wave functions, has attracted considerable attention for its\nunique insights into the bulk photovoltaic effect. Here, we present strong APV\nproperties in a high-temperature double perovskite ferroelectric\n(cyclohexylmethylammonium)$_2$CsAgBiBr$_7$, showing an extremely large\nabove-bandgap photovoltage up to about 40 V. This figure-of-merit is far beyond\nits bandgap of about 2.3 eV and comparable to the state-of-art molecular\nferroelectrics. Strikingly, the shift current model reveals an intrinsic\ncorrelation with Cs$^{+}$ cation displacement and provides, for the first time,\nan explicit explanation for the structural origin of ferroelectric APV\nactivities. Besides, its steady-state APV photocurrent exhibits the unique\nlight-polarization dependence, which endows remarkable polarization-sensitivity\nwith the highest polarization ratios of about 41 among the known 2D\nsingle-phase materials.

These\nspectral shifts correlate with alloy composition and enable the tuning of\nbandgap energies between 1.6 eV and 2.0 eV at room temperature.

If we assume one target variable y and one sensitive\nattribute s, the design space of tree learning algorithms can be spanned as\nfollows: (i) One can have one tree T that is built using an objective function\nthat is a function of y, s, and T. For instance, one can build a tree based on\nthe weighted information gain regarding y (maximizing) and s (minimizing). (ii)\nThe second option is to have one tree model T that uses an objective function\nin y and T and a constraint on s and T. Here, s is no longer part of the\nobjective, but part of a constraint. This can be achieved greedily by aborting\na further split as soon as the condition that optimizes the objective in y\nfails to satisfy the constraint on s. A simple way to explore other splits is\nto backtrack during tree construction once a fairness constraint is violated.\n(iii) The third option is to have two trees T_y and T_s, one for y and one for\ns, such that the tree structure for y and s does not have to be shared.

However, due to the large size and\ncomplexity these state-of-the-art deep learning techniques poses significant\nchallenges when deploying on resource-constrained edge devices. In this work,\nwe propose a novel capsule network based beamformer called CapsBeam, designed\nto operate on raw radio-frequency data and provide an envelope of beamformed\ndata through non-steered plane wave insonification. Experiments on in-vivo\ndata, CapsBeam reduced artifacts compared to the standard Delay-and-Sum (DAS)\nbeamforming. For in-vitro data, CapsBeam demonstrated a 32.31% increase in\ncontrast, along with gains of 16.54% and 6.7% in axial and lateral resolution\ncompared to the DAS. Similarly, in-silico data showed a 26% enhancement in\ncontrast, along with improvements of 13.6% and 21.5% in axial and lateral\nresolution, respectively, compared to the DAS. To reduce the parameter\nredundancy and enhance the computational efficiency, we pruned the model using\nour multi-layer LookAhead Kernel Pruning (LAKP-ML) methodology, achieving a\ncompression ratio of 85% without affecting the image quality. Additionally, the\nhardware complexity of the proposed model is reduced by applying quantization,\nsimplification of non-linear operations, and parallelizing operations. Finally,\nwe proposed a specialized accelerator architecture for the pruned and optimized\nCapsBeam model, implemented on a Xilinx ZU7EV FPGA. The proposed accelerator\nachieved a throughput of 30 GOPS for the convolution operation and 17.4 GOPS\nfor the dynamic routing operation.",

The proposed method, SE-QRSC, is particularly effective\nfor wide matrices with significantly more columns than rows. Starting from a\nmatrix $A$, the algorithm selects $k$ columns from the sketched matrix $B = A\n\\Omega^T$, where $\\Omega$ is a sparse subspace embedding of\n$\\mathrm{range}(A^T)$. The sparsity structure of $\\Omega$ is then exploited to\nmap the selected pivots back to the corresponding columns of $A$, which are\nthen used to produce the final subset of selected columns. We prove that this\nprocedure yields a factorization with strong rank-revealing properties, thus\nrevealing the spectrum of $A$. The resulting bounds exhibit a reduced\ndependence on the number of columns of $A$ compared to those obtained from the\nstrong rank-revealing QR factorization of $A$. Moreover, when the leverage\nscores are known, such as for orthogonal matrices, or can be efficiently\napproximated, the bounds become entirely independent of the column dimension.\nFor general matrices, the algorithm can be extended by first applying an\nadditional subspace embedding of $range(A)$.",

In this paper we investigate if balance functions triggered by\nprotons and deuterons can be used to distinguish between the two production\nmechanisms. The coalescence model is investigated using PYTHIA, while the\nstatistical thermal model is examined using the Thermal-FIST package. We find\nthat for both models the same simple relation between proton and deuteron\ntriggered balance functions is applicable. However, there is a striking\ndifference between the two models when the transverse momentum of trigger\nparticles is varied.

Traditional methods, such as logistic regression,\noften impose rigid parametric assumptions that may lead to misspecification\nerrors, compromising causal inference. Recent classical and machine learning\nalternatives, such as boosted CART, random forests, and Stable Balancing\nWeights, seem to be attractive in a predictive perspective, but they typically\nlack asymptotic properties, such as consistency, efficiency, and valid variance\nestimation. In contrast, the recently proposed BNPS to estimate propensity\nscores uses Bayesian Networks to flexibly model conditional dependencies while\npreserving essential statistical properties such as consistency, asymptotic\nnormality and asymptotic efficiency. Combined with the H\\'ajek estimator, BNPS\nenables robust estimation of the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) in scenarios\nwith strong covariate interactions and unknown data-generating mechanisms.\nThrough extensive simulations across fifteen realistic scenarios and varying\nsample sizes, BNPS consistently outperforms benchmark methods in both empirical\nrejection rates and coverage accuracy. Finally, an application to a real-world\ndataset of 7,162 prostate cancer patients from San Raffaele Hospital (Milan,\nItaly) demonstrates BNPS's practical value in assessing the impact of pelvic\nlymph node dissection on hospitalization duration and biochemical recurrence.\nThe findings support BNPS as a statistically robust, interpretable and\ntransparent alternative for causal inference in complex observational settings,\nenhancing the reliability of evidence from real-world biomedical data.",

A\nlarger pericenter distance typically requires a higher host mass in order to\ntransform the galaxy, but the interactions show no preference for prograde\nconfigurations.

Various DMD algorithms allow one to fit data with\na low-rank model that decomposes it into a sum of coherent spatiotemporal\npatterns. Nominally, each rank of the DMD model is interpreted as a complex,\nstationary spatial mode modulated by a single set of complex time dynamics\n(consisting of exponential growth/decay and oscillation), and an amplitude.\nHowever, the specifics of how these DMD components are interpreted do not\nappear to be consistent with the information actually present in the DMD\ndecomposition or the underlying data. While there is a clear physical\ninterpretation for the complex time dynamics, there is practically no guidance\non the complex spatial modes. To resolve these issues, we introduce the phasor\nnotation of the DMD model for conjugate pair DMD modes, which results in a\nstrictly positive and real spatial pattern as well as spatiotemporal waveform.\nThe phasor notation terms result in an interpretable DMD model that provides a\nmore complete diagnoses of the model components, as demonstrated on a toy\nmodel. This DMD interpretation needs to be adjusted for DMD variants which\nalter the relationship between the DMD model and the data, such as those that\nwindow data in time.

Despite the\nseverity of this threat, there is limited research on the application and\ndetection of poisoning attacks on object detection systems. This is especially\nproblematic in the military domain, where attacks can have grave consequences.\nIn this work, we both investigate the effect of poisoning attacks on military\nobject detectors in practice, and the best approach to detect these attacks. To\nsupport this research, we create a small, custom dataset featuring military\nvehicles: MilCivVeh. We explore the vulnerability of military object detectors\nfor poisoning attacks by implementing a modified version of the BadDet attack:\na patch-based poisoning attack. We then assess its impact, finding that while a\npositive attack success rate is achievable, it requires a substantial portion\nof the data to be poisoned -- raising questions about its practical\napplicability. To address the detection challenge, we test both specialized\npoisoning detection methods and anomaly detection methods from the visual\nindustrial inspection domain. Since our research shows that both classes of\nmethods are lacking, we introduce our own patch detection method: AutoDetect, a\nsimple, fast, and lightweight autoencoder-based method. Our method shows\npromising results in separating clean from poisoned samples using the\nreconstruction error of image slices, outperforming existing methods, while\nbeing less time- and memory-intensive.

One of the main\nreasons is the insufficient consideration of experimental boundary conditions.\nA central experimental problem arises from the fact that the time constants\nrequired to achieve thermodynamic equilibrium increase sharply in the vicinity\nof and above a hypothetical static glass transition. If these equilibrium\nconditions are violated, additional internal thermodynamic variables come into\nplay that normally alter the static and dynamic susceptibilities significantly\nand thus lead to misinterpretations of the experimental data. This raises, for\nexample, the question of whether there are static property changes during the\ncanonical glass transition and how these correlate with dynamic precursors. In\nthis article, we attempt to find answers to these questions using a new\nexperimental method called temperature-modulated optical refractometry in\ncombination with the temperature-jump technique. The total time required to\ninvestigate the glass transition behaviour of our model epoxy was approximately\ntwo years.",

Manual\ncoronary artery segmentation from these images is time-consuming and\ninefficient, prompting the development of automated models. However, existing\nmethods, whether rule-based or deep learning models, struggle with issues like\npoor performance and limited generalizability. Moreover, current knowledge\ndistillation methods applied in this field have not fully exploited the\nhierarchical knowledge of the model, leading to certain information waste and\ninsufficient enhancement of the model's performance capabilities for\nsegmentation tasks. To address these issues, this paper introduces Deep\nSelf-knowledge Distillation, a novel approach for coronary artery segmentation\nthat leverages hierarchical outputs for supervision. By combining Deep\nDistribution Loss and Pixel-wise Self-knowledge Distillation Loss, our method\nenhances the student model's segmentation performance through a hierarchical\nlearning strategy, effectively transferring knowledge from the teacher model.\nOur method combines a loosely constrained probabilistic distribution vector\nwith tightly constrained pixel-wise supervision, providing dual regularization\nfor the segmentation model while also enhancing its generalization and\nrobustness.

The main challenge\nin this domain is the reliance on fine-grained location-level annotations,\n(i.e. points placed on top of each individual) to train deep networks.\nCollecting such detailed annotations is both tedious, time-consuming, and poses\na significant barrier to scalability for real-world applications. To alleviate\nthis burden, we present Count2Density: a novel pipeline designed to predict\nmeaningful density maps containing quantitative spatial information using only\ncount-level annotations (i.e., total number of people) during training. To\nachieve this, Count2Density generates pseudo-density maps leveraging past\npredictions stored in a Historical Map Bank, thereby reducing confirmation\nbias. This bank is initialised using an unsupervised saliency estimator to\nprovide an initial spatial prior and is iteratively updated with an EMA of\npredicted density maps. These pseudo-density maps are obtained by sampling\nlocations from estimated crowd areas using a hypergeometric distribution, with\nthe number of samplings determined by the count-level annotations. To further\nenhance the spatial awareness of the model, we add a self-supervised\ncontrastive spatial regulariser to encourage similar feature representations\nwithin crowded regions while maximising dissimilarity with background regions.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms\ncross-domain adaptation methods and achieves better results than recent\nstate-of-the-art approaches in semi-supervised settings across several\ndatasets. Additional analyses validate the effectiveness of each individual\ncomponent of our pipeline, confirming the ability of Count2Density to\neffectively retrieve spatial information from count-level annotations and\nenabling accurate subregion counting.",

Several non-CDM models\npredict that the DM distribution thermalizes over time, transforming initially\ncuspy halos into cores. This transformation weakens the gravitational\npotential, allowing the stellar component to expand and form diffuse, core-like\nstructures. Using analytical models and adiabatic invariants, we examine\nstellar systems with purely tangential, purely radial, and isotropic orbits\nevolving under a slowly changing potential. Across a wide range of initial and\nfinal conditions, we find that stellar cores form relatively easily, though\ntheir properties depend sensitively on these conditions. Orbit types preserve\ntheir nature during the DM halo expansion: tangential and radial orbits remain\nso, while isotropic orbits remain nearly isotropic in the central regions.\nSystems with circular orbits develop stellar cores when the initial stellar\ndensity logarithmic slope lies between -0.5 and -1.2, whereas radial systems do\nnot form cores. Isotropic systems behave similarly to tangential ones,\nproducing cores that are isotropic in the center but develop increasing radial\nanisotropy outward; the anisotropy parameter \"beta\" grows from sim 0.07 at the\ncore radius to sim 0.5 at three core radii. The theoretical and observational\nliterature suggests initial DM profiles with steep slopes and stellar\ndistributions that are shallower and isotropic at the center.

The dataset includes over\n7,000 questions spanning secondary to collegiate education levels, aligned with\nthe Sri Lankan national curriculum, and covers six domains and 30 subjects,\nencompassing both general academic topics and culturally grounded knowledge. We\nevaluate 26 LLMs on SinhalaMMLU and observe that, while Claude 3.5 sonnet and\nGPT-4o achieve the highest average accuracies at 67% and 62% respectively,\noverall model performance remains limited. In particular, models struggle in\nculturally rich domains such as the Humanities, revealing substantial room for\nimprovement in adapting LLMs to low-resource and culturally specific contexts.",

Current applications in PM have predominantly centered on prompt\nengineering strategies or the transformation of event logs into narrative-style\ndatasets, thereby exploiting the semantic capabilities of LLMs to address\ndiverse tasks. In contrast, this study investigates the direct adaptation of\npretrained LLMs to process data without natural language reformulation,\nmotivated by the fact that these models excel in generating sequences of\ntokens, similar to the objective in PM. More specifically, we focus on\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques to mitigate the computational\noverhead typically associated with such models. Our experimental setup focuses\non Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM), and considers both single- and\nmulti-task predictions. The results demonstrate a potential improvement in\npredictive performance over state-of-the-art recurrent neural network (RNN)\napproaches and recent narrative-style-based solutions, particularly in the\nmulti-task setting. Additionally, our fine-tuned models exhibit faster\nconvergence and require significantly less hyperparameter optimization.",

Comprehensive studies of intensive multi-wavelength monitoring\nand surveys of local and high-redshift AGNs have shown that X-ray illumination\nof AGN accretion discs is a potential explanation for the observed variability.\nOur main objective is to study the UV/optical power spectra of AGNs under the\nassumption of X-ray reverberation and to test whether this model can explain\nthe observed power spectra of distant quasars. To do this, we computed the disc\ntransfer function in the case of X-ray reverberation using a recent physical\nmodel and studied its dependence on the parameters of the model. This model\nallows us to explore the variability of X-ray illuminated discs under the\nscenario in which the X-ray corona is powered by the accretion process or by an\nexternal source. We then calculated UV/optical power spectra using the disc\ntransfer function and assuming a bending power law for the X-ray power\nspectrum. We fitted our models to the observed power spectra of quasars\ndetermined by a recent power spectrum analysis of the SDSS Stripe-82 light\ncurves. We demonstrate that X-ray reverberation can fit the power spectra of\nquasars in our sample well at all wavelengths, from $\\sim 1300$\\AA\\ up to\n$4000$\\AA. Our best-fit models imply that the X-ray corona is powered by the\naccretion disc, and that the black hole spin is probably lower than 0.7, while\nthe X-ray corona height is in the range of $20 - 60 R_{g}$. This is in\nagreement with previous findings from the application of the X-ray\nreverberation model to the quasar micro-lensing disc size problem, as well as\nrecent time-lag measurements.",

    "abstract": "Despite the promising optoelectronic properties of methylammonium lead iodide\n(MAPbI3)-based perovskite solar cells (PSCs), their commercial viability is\nhindered by interfacial energy misalignment, suboptimal light absorption, and\nthermal instability. Here, we present a comprehensive theoretical framework to\nenhance the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of MAPbI3 based PSC through\nintegrated electronic and morphological engineering. Firstly, to address\ninterfacial recombination and inefficient hole extraction at the perovskite/HTL\njunction, we introduced a double hole transport layer (HTL) stack comprising\nCuO and I2O5-doped Spiro-OMeTAD, which significantly improved energy level\nalignment and carrier selectivity. Comprehensive multiphysics simulations,\ncombining finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) optical analysis with finite\nelement method (FEM) based electrical and thermal modeling, demonstrated that\noptimized doping concentrations and thickness parameters within the\nCuO/Spiro-OMeTAD hole transport layers can enhance the PCE to 22.78%. However,\nplanar architectures, while offering ease of fabrication and scalability,\nexhibit weak near-UV and near-infrared absorption, whereas nanostructures\nattain superior light trapping but incur significant fabrication complexity,\nunderscoring the need for balanced design strategies. To address these inherent\nlimitations, we propose a hierarchical ellipsoidal patterned solar cell\n(HEPSC), wherein a top-layer ellipsoidal nanostructure is introduced across the\nfull device stack. This design enhances broadband light trapping and optical\nconfinement throughout the active layers while maintaining fabrication\nfeasibility through geometrically realistic structuring.",

Five response variables (first fixation duration, total fixation\nduration, number of fixations, word naming latency, and spoken word duration)\nare analyzed with the generalized additive model. Of central interest is the\nquestion of whether measures for lexical processing generated by a\ncomputational model of the mental lexicon (the Discriminative Lexicon Model,\nDLM) are predictive for these response variables, and how they compare to\nclassical predictors such as word frequency, neighborhood size, and\ninflectional paradigm size. Computational models were implemented both with\nlinear and deep mappings. Central findings are, first, that DLM-based measures\nare powerful predictors for lexical processing, second, that DLM-measures using\ndeep learning are not necessarily more precise predictors of lexical processing\nthan DLM-measures using linear mappings, third, that classical predictors tend\nto provide somewhat more precise fits compared to DLM-based predictors (except\nfor total fixation duration, where the two provide equivalent goodness of fit),\nand fourth, that in the naming task lexical variables are not predictive for\nfirst fixation duration and the total number of fixations. As the DLM works\nwith mappings from form to meaning, the predictivity of DLM-based measures for\ntotal fixation duration, naming latencies, and spoken word duration indicates\nthat meaning is heavily involved in the present word naming task.",

However,\ncurrent existing methods present some limitations: (i) some approaches fail to\nexplicitly capture the relationship between structural changes and time\nintervals, especially when trained on age-imbalanced datasets; (ii) others rely\nonly on scan interpolation, which lack clinical utility, as they generate\nintermediate images between timepoints rather than future pathological\nprogression; and (iii) most approaches rely on 2D slice-based architectures,\nthereby disregarding full 3D anatomical context, which is essential for\naccurate longitudinal predictions. We propose a 3D Temporally-Aware Diffusion\nModel (TADM-3D), which accurately predicts brain progression on MRI volumes. To\nbetter model the relationship between time interval and brain changes, TADM-3D\nuses a pre-trained Brain-Age Estimator (BAE) that guides the diffusion model in\nthe generation of MRIs that accurately reflect the expected age difference\nbetween baseline and generated follow-up scans. Additionally, to further\nimprove the temporal awareness of TADM-3D, we propose the Back-In-Time\nRegularisation (BITR), by training TADM-3D to predict bidirectionally from the\nbaseline to follow-up (forward), as well as from the follow-up to baseline\n(backward). Although predicting past scans has limited clinical applications,\nthis regularisation helps the model generate temporally more accurate scans.

    "abstract": "An amplitude analysis of the $B^0 \\rightarrow \\eta_{c}(1S) K^+ \\pi^- $ decays\nwith $\\eta_{c}(1S) \\to p \\bar{p}$ is performed using a sample corresponding to\nan integrated luminosity of 9$\\text{fb}^{-1}$ of $pp$ collision data collected\nby the LHCb detector at centre-of-mass energies of $\\sqrt{s}$ = 7, 8 and 13TeV.\nThe data are described with a model including only intermediate contributions\nfrom known $K^{0\\star}$ resonances. Evidence for an exotic resonance in the\n$\\eta_{c}(1S) \\pi^{-} $ system, reported in a previous analysis of this decay\nchannel, is not confirmed. The inclusive branching fraction of the $B^0\n\\rightarrow \\eta_{c}(1S) K^+ \\pi^- $ decays is measured to be \\begin{align*}\n\\mathcal{B}(B^0 \\rightarrow \\eta_{c}(1S) K^+ \\pi^- ) = (5.82 \\pm 0.20 \\pm 0.23\n\\pm 0.55) \\times 10^{-4}, \\end{align*} where the first uncertainty is\nstatistical, the second systematic, and the third arises from the limited\nknowledge of external branching fractions.",

To solve these problems, various\nprivacy-preserving inference schemes have been proposed. In particular, due to\nthe efficiency and interpretability of decision trees, private decision tree\nevaluation (PDTE) has garnered significant attention. However, existing PDTE\nschemes suffer from significant limitations: their communication and\ncomputation costs scale with the number of trees, the number of nodes, or the\ntree depth, which makes them inefficient for large-scale models, especially\nover WAN networks. To address these issues, we propose Kangaroo, a private and\namortized decision tree inference framework build upon packed homomorphic\nencryption. Specifically, we design a novel model hiding and encoding scheme,\ntogether with secure feature selection, oblivious comparison, and secure path\nevaluation protocols, enabling full amortization of the overhead as the number\nof nodes or trees scales. Furthermore, we enhance the performance and\nfunctionality of the framework through optimizations, including\nsame-sharing-for-same-model, latency-aware, and adaptive encoding adjustment\nstrategies. Kangaroo achieves a $14\\times$ to $59\\times$ performance\nimprovement over state-of-the-art (SOTA) one-round interactive schemes in WAN\nenvironments.

The Javalambre VARiability (J-VAR) survey provides\nvaluable time-series data across seven optical bands, including gri and four\nmedium and narrow bands. Aims. Our goal is to construct and analyze light\ncurves for RR Lyrae stars identified in the first data release (DR1) of the\nJ-VAR survey using the Gaia DR3 variable stars catalog as a reference. Methods.\nThe light curves of 315 RR Lyrae were analyzed by fitting templates from the\nSloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) multiband template library. The periods and\namplitudes for the seven bands in J-VAR were independently obtained from the\nbest-fitted templates. Results. The J-VAR periods show strong agreement with\nGaia DR3 values, which confirms the reliability of the applied methodology. The\nBailey diagram for each J-VAR filter reveals the expected trend for RRab and\nRRc stars, with larger pulsation amplitudes at bluer wavelengths. After\nnormalizing by the r-band amplitude, an exponential trend is found, with the\nbluer J-VAR filter centered at 395 nm having twice the amplitude of the reddest\nJ-VAR passband at 861 nm. The normalized amplitudes of the RR Lyrae stars from\nGaia and the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) are consistent with the J-VAR\ntrend. Finally, the SDSS templates derived from broadbands also provide a\nproper description for the medium and narrow band light curves.

    "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has become a popular approach in traffic\nsignal control (TSC) due to its ability to learn adaptive policies from complex\ntraffic environments. Within DRL-based TSC methods, two primary control\nparadigms are ``choose phase\" and ``switch\" strategies. Although the agent in\nthe choose phase paradigm selects the next active phase adaptively, this\nparadigm may result in unexpected phase sequences for drivers, disrupting their\nanticipation and potentially compromising safety at intersections. Meanwhile,\nthe switch paradigm allows the agent to decide whether to switch to the next\npredefined phase or extend the current phase. While this structure maintains a\nmore predictable order, it can lead to unfair and inefficient phase\nallocations, as certain movements may be extended disproportionately while\nothers are neglected. In this paper, we propose a DRL model, named Deep\nHierarchical Cycle Planner (DHCP), to allocate the traffic signal cycle\nduration hierarchically. A high-level agent first determines the split of the\ntotal cycle time between the North-South (NS) and East-West (EW) directions\nbased on the overall traffic state. Then, a low-level agent further divides the\nallocated duration within each major direction between straight and left-turn\nmovements, enabling more flexible durations for the two movements.

    "abstract": "The rapid progress of large language models (LLMs) has greatly enhanced\nreasoning tasks and facilitated the development of LLM-based applications. A\ncritical factor in improving LLM-based applications is the design of effective\nsystem prompts, which significantly impact the behavior and output quality of\nLLMs. However, system prompts are susceptible to theft and misuse, which could\nundermine the interests of prompt owners. Existing methods protect prompt\ncopyrights through watermark injection and verification but face challenges due\nto their reliance on intermediate LLM outputs (e.g., logits), which limits\ntheir practical feasibility.\n  In this paper, we propose PromptCOS, a method for auditing prompt copyright\nbased on content-level output similarity. It embeds watermarks by optimizing\nthe prompt while simultaneously co-optimizing a special verification query and\ncontent-level signal marks. This is achieved by leveraging cyclic output\nsignals and injecting auxiliary tokens to ensure reliable auditing in\ncontent-only scenarios. Additionally, it incorporates cover tokens to protect\nthe watermark from malicious deletion. For copyright verification, PromptCOS\nidentifies unauthorized usage by comparing the similarity between the\nsuspicious output and the signal mark. Experimental results demonstrate that\nour method achieves high effectiveness (99.3% average watermark similarity),\nstrong distinctiveness (60.8% greater than the best baseline), high fidelity\n(accuracy degradation of no more than 0.58%), robustness (resilience against\nthree types of potential attacks), and computational efficiency (up to 98.1%\nreduction in computational cost).

We address these questions with a\ncomprehensive evaluation of LLM-based approaches to scalar construct\nmeasurement in social science. Using multiple datasets sourced from the\npolitical science literature, we evaluate four approaches: unweighted direct\npointwise scoring, aggregation of pairwise comparisons,\ntoken-probability-weighted pointwise scoring, and finetuning. Our study yields\nactionable findings for applied researchers. First, LLMs prompted to generate\npointwise scores directly from texts produce discontinuous distributions with\nbunching at arbitrary numbers. The quality of the measurements improves with\npairwise comparisons made by LLMs, but it improves even more by taking\npointwise scores and weighting them by token probability. Finally, finetuning\nsmaller models with as few as 1,000 training pairs can match or exceed the\nperformance of prompted LLMs.",

    "abstract": "In technical applications, more than 90\\% of the energy required to pump the\nfluids through pipes is dissipated by turbulence near the wall. In this\nrespect, streamwise traveling waves of wall blowing and suction have been used\nto relaminarize turbulent pipe flow at a low friction Reynolds number of\n$\\mathrm{Re}_\\tau=110$, considerably reducing friction losses and energy\nconsumption. Here, we demonstrate that streamwise traveling waves of wall\nblowing and suction applied to initially turbulent pipe flow can trigger\nrelaminarization up to friction Reynolds numbers of $\\mathrm{Re}_\\tau=720$.\nFurthermore, we perform a parametric study comprising both upstream traveling\nwaves (UTWs, $c<0$) and downstream traveling waves (DTWs, $c>0$) by varying the\ntraveling wave amplitude $a$, celerity $c$, and wavelength $\\lambda$ at\n$\\mathrm{Re}_\\tau=180$ and $\\mathrm{Re}_\\tau=360$ in order to investigate the\nscaling of the maximum drag reduction and of the net energy saving rate in\ndirect numerical simulations. Consistent with channel flow studies in the\nliterature, we found that UTWs destabilize the flow, while generating\nsublaminar drag due to the pumping effect. However, only low-speed UTWs with\nlarge amplitudes were discovered to decisively reduce energy consumption. For\nDTWs, a large range of wave parameters lead to a conspicuous drag reduction.\nNevertheless, only a subgroup of these wave parameters are associated with\nsiginificant net energy savings, i.e. $0.067U_{c,lam} \\lesssim a\n\\lesssim0.1U_{c,lam}$, $c \\approx U_{c,lam}$, and $\\lambda\\approx\n360\\delta_\\nu$, independent of the Reynolds number.

While deep learning has shown excellent\nperformance in this domain, it continues to approach change area detection and\nchange moment identification as distinct tasks. Given that change area can be\ninferred from change moment, we propose a time series change detection network,\nnamed CAIM-Net (Change Area Inference from Moment Network), to ensure\nconsistency between change area and change moment results. CAIM-Net infers\nchange area from change moment based on the intrinsic relationship between time\nseries analysis and spatial change detection.

In the Difference\nExtraction and Enhancement, a lightweight encoder with batch dimension stacking\nis designed to rapidly extract difference features. Subsequently, boundary\nenhancement convolution is applied to amplify these difference features. In the\nCoarse Change Moment Extraction, the enhanced difference features from the\nfirst step are used to spatiotemporal correlation analysis, and then two\ndistinct methods are employed to determine coarse change moments. In the Fine\nChange Moment Extraction and Change Area Inference, a multiscale temporal Class\nActivation Mapping (CAM) module first increases the weight of the\nchange-occurring moment from coarse change moments.

Towards this, we propose a novel\ntwo-step approach that deploys a full-fledged CapsNet on FPGA. First, we prune\nthe network using a novel Look-Ahead Kernel Pruning (LAKP) methodology that\nuses the sum of look-ahead scores of the model parameters. Next, we simplify\nthe nonlinear operations, reorder loops, and parallelize operations of the\nrouting algorithm to reduce CapsNet hardware complexity. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first work accelerating a full-fledged CapsNet on FPGA.\nExperimental results on the MNIST and F-MNIST datasets (typical in Capsule\nNetwork community) show that the proposed LAKP approach achieves an effective\ncompression rate of 99.26% and 98.84%, and achieves a throughput of 82 FPS and\n48 FPS on Xilinx PYNQ-Z1 FPGA, respectively. Furthermore, reducing the hardware\ncomplexity of the routing algorithm increases the throughput to 1351 FPS and\n934 FPS respectively. As corroborated by our results, this work enables highly\nperformance-efficient deployment of CapsNets on low-cost FPGA that are popular\nin modern edge devices.",

However, these observed redshifts are systematically\nmodified by the effect of galaxy peculiar velocities. Although these velocities\nmay be estimated from the local density field by the process of velocity-field\nreconstruction, the intrinsic errors and covariance in these estimates\ncontribute to the error in the H_0 determination. In this paper we demonstrate\nhow the impact of peculiar velocities can be propagated into H_0 measurements\nfrom local distance indicators with observed redshifts, incorporating the full\ncovariance of the velocity field induced by bulk flows. We apply our methods to\ncosmological simulations, testing the importance of this effect in the context\nof future analyses of gravitational wave sources with electromagnetic\ncounterparts used as bright sirens. We conclude that H_0 errors may be\nincreased by up to a factor of 2 in comparison with neglecting peculiar\nvelocity covariance, with the highest impacts expected for sources at nearby\ndistances or with small distance errors. Our analytical methods may also be\napplied to other local distance indicators, such as Type Ia supernovae.",

Existing\nsolutions typically focus on individual SOLID principles or specific\nprogramming languages, leaving a gap in the ability to detect violations across\nall five principles in multi-language codebases. This paper presents a new\napproach: a methodology that leverages tailored prompt engineering to assess\nLLMs on their ability to detect SOLID violations across multiple languages. We\npresent a benchmark of four leading LLMs-CodeLlama, DeepSeekCoder, QwenCoder,\nand GPT-4o Mini-on their ability to detect violations of all five SOLID\nprinciples. For this evaluation, we construct a new benchmark dataset of 240\nmanually validated code examples. Using this dataset, we test four distinct\nprompt strategies inspired by established zero-shot, few-shot, and\nchain-of-thought techniques to systematically measure their impact on detection\naccuracy. Our emerging results reveal a stark hierarchy among models, with\nGPT-4o Mini decisively outperforming others, yet even struggles with\nchallenging principles like DIP. Crucially, we show that prompt strategy has a\ndramatic impact, but no single strategy is universally best; for instance, a\ndeliberative ENSEMBLE prompt excels at OCP detection while a hint-based EXAMPLE\nprompt is superior for DIP violations. Across all experiments, detection\naccuracy is heavily influenced by language characteristics and degrades sharply\nwith increasing code complexity. These initial findings demonstrate that\neffective, AI-driven design analysis requires not a single best model, but a\ntailored approach that matches the right model and prompt to the specific\ndesign context, highlighting the potential of LLMs to support maintainability\nthrough AI-assisted code analysis.",

A major challenge in\nthe simulations is in modelling of the outermost layers, known as the envelope,\nexhibiting a drop of many orders of magnitude in temperature and density in a\ngeometrically thin shell. This is often addressed by constructing a separate\nenvelope model in plane-parallel approximation that produces a relation between\nthe temperature at the bottom of the envelope, $T_b$, and the surface\ntemperature, $T_s$. Our aim is to construct a general framework for\napproximating the $T_b$-$T_s$ relation that is able to include the dependencies\nfrom the strength and orientation of the magnetic field. We used standard\nprescriptions to calculate a large number of magnetised envelope models to be\nused as a training sample and employed single-hidden-layer feedforward neural\nnetworks as approximators, providing the flexibility, high accuracy, and fast\nevaluation necessary in neutron star simulations. We explored the optimal\nnetwork architecture and hyperparameter choices and used a special holdout set\ndesigned to avoid overfitting to the structure of the input data.

The government\nmay be honest, in which case revenue is converted one-for-one into public\nconsumption, or opportunistic, in which case nothing is delivered. We treat\ntrust as the prior probability that the government is honest and ask how it\nshapes both the overall scale of taxation and the choice between a labor tax\nand a broad commodity (output) tax. Three results emerge. First, there is a\ntrust threshold below which any positive tax lowers welfare. Second, above that\nthreshold there is an equivalence frontier: a continuum of tax mixes that\nimplement the same allocation and welfare. Third, small instrument-specific\nadministrative or salience costs uniquely select the revenue instrument,\ntypically favoring the cheaper broad base. An isoelastic specialization yields\nclosed-form expressions that make the threshold, optimal rates, delivered\npublic consumption, and welfare transparent.

    "abstract": "It is well-known that exotic compact objects (ECOs) are a class of objects\ncategorised as Black Hole (BH) mimickers. ECOs have been shown to possess\nsignatures distinguishing them from BHs. However, in our universe, no object\nexists in complete isolation. Consequently, any compact object, whether a BH or\nan ECO, must reside within some environment that inevitably influences the\nsurrounding spacetime geometry due to back-reaction. In this paper, we\ninvestigate a scenario where an ECO is embedded in an environment of dark\nmatter (DM). In this work, we assume two different models of the DM halo\nprofile. We compute the Love numbers and GW echoes of this composite system to\nassess the impact of the surrounding dark matter halo. To analyze the echoes,\nwe focus on odd-parity perturbations, while for calculating the tidal Love\nnumbers, we consider both even and odd parity perturbations. We aim to\nunderstand how the DM properties couple to the ECO signatures in the Love\nnumber or the GW-echo signal, both of which have a strong bearing as\nobservables in future-generation detectors.",

By exploiting the permutation symmetry\nof the emitters and weak U(1) symmetry, we develop a numerical method capable\nof exactly solving the Tavis-Cummings model with local dissipation for up to\n140 emitters. Using the exact method, we validate mean-field and second-order\ncumulant approximations and use them to describe macroscopic numbers of\nemitters. We analyse the dynamics of the average cavity photon number,\nelectronic coherence, and Bloch vector length, and show that the effect of\nvibrational mode coupling goes beyond simple dephasing. Our results show that\nsuperradiance is possible in the presence of vibrational mode coupling; for\nnegative cavity detunings, the vibrational coupling may even enhance\nsuperradiance.

Despite the numerous algorithms proposed with\ndifferent DL architectures, maintaining a balance among performance,\ncomputational complexity, and multi-source ECG feature fusion remains\nchallenging. Recently, state space models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, have\ndemonstrated remarkable effectiveness across various fields. Their inherent\ndesign for high-efficiency computation and linear complexity makes them\nparticularly suitable for low-dimensional data like ECGs. This work proposes\nS2M2ECG, an SSM architecture featuring three-level fusion mechanisms: (1)\nSpatio-temporal bi-directional SSMs with segment tokenization for low-level\nsignal fusion, (2) Intra-lead temporal information fusion with bi-directional\nscanning to enhance recognition accuracy in both forward and backward\ndirections, (3) Cross-lead feature interaction modules for spatial information\nfusion. To fully leverage the ECG-specific multi-lead mechanisms inherent in\nECG signals, a multi-branch design and lead fusion modules are incorporated,\nenabling individual analysis of each lead while ensuring seamless integration\nwith others. Experimental results reveal that S2M2ECG achieves superior\nperformance in the rhythmic, morphological, and clinical scenarios. Moreover,\nits lightweight architecture ensures it has nearly the fewest parameters among\nexisting models, making it highly suitable for efficient inference and\nconvenient deployment. Collectively, S2M2ECG offers a promising alternative\nthat strikes an excellent balance among performance, computational complexity,\nand ECG-specific characteristics, paving the way for high-performance,\nlightweight computations in CVD diagnosis.",

A graph is\nco-bipartite if its complement is bipartite. Therefore, the vertex set of a\nco-bipartite graph can be partitioned into two disjoint subsets $X$ and $Y$\nsuch that the subgraphs induced by $X$ and $Y$ are cliques.\n  The concept of word-representability for graph classes has gained significant\nattention in recent years. The book Words and Graphs by Sergey Kitaev and Vadim\nLozin presents examples of co-bipartite graphs that are not word-representable.\nIt is known that a graph is word-representable if and only if it admits a\nsemi-transitive orientation. Although the necessary and sufficient conditions\nfor the existence of a semi-transitive orientation in co-bipartite graphs have\nbeen established, the characterization based on vertex ordering remains open.\nIn this paper, we present necessary and sufficient conditions for a\nco-bipartite graph to be word-representable in terms of its vertex ordering.\nFurthermore, based on this vertex ordering, we provide an algorithm to\nconstruct a $3$-uniform word-representation for any word-representable\nco-bipartite graph.

This\npaper addresses this gap by proposing a new causal inference framework that\nestimates how continuous changes in the credit limit affect the entire\ndistribution of consumer spending. We formalize distributional causal effects\nwithin the Wasserstein space and introduce a robust Distributional Double\nMachine Learning estimator, supported by asymptotic theory to ensure\nconsistency and validity. To implement this estimator, we design a deep\nlearning architecture comprising two components: a Neural Functional Regression\nNet to capture complex, nonlinear relationships between treatments, covariates,\nand distributional outcomes, and a Conditional Normalizing Flow Net to estimate\ngeneralized propensity scores under continuous treatment. Numerical experiments\ndemonstrate that the proposed estimator accurately recovers distributional\neffects in a range of data-generating scenarios. Applying our framework to\ntransaction-level data from a major BigTech platform, we find that increased\ncredit limits primarily shift consumers towards higher-value purchases rather\nthan uniformly increasing spending, offering new insights for personalized\nmarketing strategies and digital consumer finance.",

    "abstract": "Business sentiment analysis (BSA) is one of the significant and popular\ntopics of natural language processing. It is one kind of sentiment analysis\ntechniques for business purposes. Different categories of sentiment analysis\ntechniques like lexicon-based techniques and different types of machine\nlearning algorithms are applied for sentiment analysis on different languages\nlike English, Hindi, Spanish, etc. In this paper, long short-term memory (LSTM)\nis applied for business sentiment analysis, where a recurrent neural network is\nused. An LSTM model is used in a modified approach to prevent the vanishing\ngradient problem rather than applying the conventional recurrent neural network\n(RNN). To apply the modified RNN model, product review dataset is used. In this\nexperiment, 70\\% of the data is trained for the LSTM and the rest 30\\% of the\ndata is used for testing. The result of this modified RNN model is compared\nwith other conventional RNN models, and a comparison is made among the results.\nIt is noted that the proposed model performs better than the other conventional\nRNN models. Here, the proposed model, i.e., the modified RNN model approach has\nachieved around 91.33\\% of accuracy. By applying this model, any business\ncompany or e-commerce business site can identify the feedback from their\ncustomers about different types of products that customers like or dislike.\nBased on the customer reviews, a business company or e-commerce platform can\nevaluate its marketing strategy.",

However, extending this success to other\nreasoning-intensive domains remains challenging due to the scarcity of\nhigh-quality, verifiable datasets and the high cost of human supervision. In\nthis work, we introduce the Loong Project: an open-source framework for\nscalable synthetic data generation and verification across a diverse range of\nreasoning-intensive domains. The framework consists of two key components: (1)\nLoongBench, a curated seed dataset containing 8,729 human-vetted examples\nacross 12 domains (e.g., Advanced Mathematics, Chemistry, Logic), each paired\nwith executable code and rich metadata; and (2) LoongEnv, a modular synthetic\ndata generation environment that supports multiple prompting strategies to\nproduce new question-answer-code triples. Together, these components form an\nagent-environment loop that enables reinforcement learning, where an LLM-based\nagent is rewarded for generating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) solutions that align\nwith code-executed answers. Empirically, we benchmark LoongBench on a broad\nsuite of both open-source and proprietary LLMs to evaluate domain coverage and\nreveal performance bottlenecks. In addition, we conduct a comprehensive\nanalysis of synthetic data generated by LoongEnv, examining correctness,\ndifficulty, and diversity.

Binary quantization, which\ncompresses model weights from 16-bit Brain Float to 1-bit representations in\n{-1, 1}, offers significant reductions in storage and inference costs.

    "abstract": "In randomized experiments, covariates are often used to reduce variance and\nimprove the precision of treatment effect estimates. However, in many real\nworld settings, interference between units, where one unit's treatment affects\nanother's outcome, complicates causal inference. This raises a key question:\nhow can covariates be effectively used in the presence of interference?\nAddressing this challenge is nontrivial, as direct covariate adjustment, such\nas through regression, can sometimes increase variance due to dependencies\nacross units. In this paper, we study how to use covariate information to\nreduce the variance of treatment effect estimators under interference. We focus\non the total treatment effect (TTE), defined as the difference in average\noutcomes when all units are treated versus when all are controlled. Our\nanalysis is conducted under the neighborhood interference model and a low order\ninteraction outcome model. Building on the SNIPE estimator from\nCortez-Rodriguez et al. (2023), we propose a covariate adjusted SNIPE estimator\nand show that, under sparsity conditions on the interference network, the\nproposed estimator is asymptotically unbiased and has asymptotic variance no\ngreater than that of the original SNIPE estimator. This parallels the classical\nresult of Lin (2013) under the no interference assumption, where covariate\nadjustment does not worsen estimation precision. Importantly, our variance\nimprovement result does not rely on strong assumptions about the covariates:\nthe covariates may be arbitrarily dependent, affect outcomes across units, and\ndepend on the interference network itself.",

However, training these models at\nunprecedented scales requires extensive AI accelerator clusters and\nsophisticated parallelism strategies, which pose significant challenges in\nmaintaining system reliability over prolonged training periods. A major concern\nis the substantial loss of training time caused by inevitable hardware and\nsoftware failures. To address these challenges, we present FlashRecovery, a\nfast and low-cost failure recovery system comprising three core modules: (1)\nActive and real-time failure detection. This module performs continuous\ntraining state monitoring, enabling immediate identification of hardware and\nsoftware failures within seconds, thus ensuring rapid incident response; (2)\nScale-independent task restart. By employing different recovery strategies for\nnormal and faulty nodes, combined with an optimized communication group\nreconstruction protocol, our approach ensures that the recovery time remains\nnearly constant, regardless of cluster scale; (3) Checkpoint-free recovery\nwithin one step. Our novel recovery mechanism enables single-step restoration,\ncompletely eliminating dependence on traditional checkpointing methods and\ntheir associated overhead. Collectively, these innovations enable FlashRecovery\nto achieve optimal Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective\n(RPO), substantially improving the reliability and efficiency of long-duration\nLLM training. Experimental results demonstrate that FlashRecovery system can\nachieve training restoration on training cluster with 4, 800 devices in 150\nseconds. We also verify that the time required for failure recovery is nearly\nconsistent for different scales of training tasks.",

In addition, traditional static condition control makes it\ndifficult for networks to learn in multi-task scenarios with its dynamically\nevolving characteristics. To address these challenges, we propose a dynamic\nconditional double diffusion bridge training paradigm to build a general\nframework for ill-posed multi-tasks. Firstly, this paradigm decouples the\ndiffusion and condition generation processes, avoiding the dependence of the\ndiffusion model on supervised data in ill-posed tasks. Secondly, generated by\nthe same noise schedule, dynamic conditions are used to gradually adjust their\nstatistical characteristics, naturally embed time-related information, and\nreduce the difficulty of network learning. We analyze the learning objectives\nof the network under different conditional forms in the single-step denoising\nprocess and compare the changes in its attention weights in the network,\ndemonstrating the superiority of our dynamic conditions. Taking dehazing and\nvisible-infrared fusion as typical ill-posed multi-task scenarios, we achieve\nthe best performance in multiple indicators on public datasets.

    "abstract": "The basic and conceptual notion of this work starts from the recent\ninvestigations of Marios Christodoulou and Carlo Rovelli (CR) in their paper\nentitled ''How big is a black hole?''. This work is related to the black hole\ninterior volume and the entropy by Baocheng Zhang. In CR work, a spherically\nsymmetric Schwarzschild black hole is considered and defines the interior\nvolume, as the volume inside a sphere $S$ is the maximal proper volume of a\nspace-like spherically symmetric $3d$ hypersurface bounded by the sphere $S$.\nUsing this definition, they found the interior volume of a black hole is\nproportional to the advanced time. This is the main characteristic of this\nformulation. Which means that a black hole could store a large amount of\ninfalling information. Using this special property, one can prob the nature of\nHawking radiation emitted by a black hole. They also extend their result to the\ncharged static black hole and found a consistent result. Their numerical\nanalysis showed that the special character of this formulation is that the\nvolume linearly increases with advancing time.\n  Later, the CR work is followed by Baocheng Zhang, who investigated the\nentropy of scalar quantum modes in the interior of the Schwarzschild Black\nhole. He found the entropy of scalar quantum modes in the interior of Black\nhole is proportional to the lack hole surface area. The proportionality\nconstant is found to be less than unity, which means that the interior entropy\nis less as compared to the Bekenstein Hawking entropy (horizon entropy). Note\nthat these analyses are only applicable for black holes with mass greater than\nthe Planck mass. If massless than Planck's mass, then one needs to understand\nthe uncertainty relation.",

This study assesses the Across-the-Curve Credit\nSpread Index (AXI) -- a transparent, transaction-based measure of wholesale\nbank funding costs -- as a complement to SOFR, summarizing its behavior,\nconstruction, and loan-pricing implications. AXI aggregates observable\nunsecured funding transactions across short- and long-term maturities to\nproduce a daily credit spread that is IOSCO-aligned and operationally\ncompatible with SOFR-based infrastructure. The Financial Conditions Credit\nSpread Index (FXI) is a broader market companion to AXI and serves as its\nfallback. FXI co-moves closely with AXI in normal times; under stress, the\ncorrelation of daily changes exceeds 0.9 for economy-wide shocks and remains\nstrong in bank-specific stress, around 0.8 during the Silicon Valley Bank\nepisode. Empirically, AXI is strongly correlated with standard credit-spread\nmeasures and market-stress indicators and is inversely related to\nfinancial-sector performance. SOFR+AXI exhibits correlations with macroeconomic\nvariables with the signs and magnitudes expected of a credit-sensitive rate. In\nloan-pricing applications, SOFR+AXI reduces funding risk and can support spread\ndiscounts of up to 65 basis points without lowering risk-adjusted returns. In\nstress scenarios, banks relying on SOFR-only pricing can fail to recover as\nmuch as 15 basis points on revolving credit lines over as little as three\nmonths.

    "abstract": "Person re-identification faces two core challenges: precisely locating the\nforeground target while suppressing background noise and extracting\nfine-grained features from the target region. Numerous visual-only approaches\naddress these issues by partitioning an image and applying attention modules,\nyet they rely on costly manual annotations and struggle with complex\nocclusions. Recent multimodal methods, motivated by CLIP, introduce semantic\ncues to guide visual understanding. However, they focus solely on foreground\ninformation, but overlook the potential value of background cues. Inspired by\nhuman perception, we argue that background semantics are as important as the\nforeground semantics in ReID, as humans tend to eliminate background\ndistractions while focusing on target appearance. Therefore, this paper\nproposes an end-to-end framework that jointly models foreground and background\ninformation within a dual-branch cross-modal feature extraction pipeline. To\nhelp the network distinguish between the two domains, we propose an\nintra-semantic alignment and inter-semantic adversarial learning strategy.\nSpecifically, we align visual and textual features that share the same\nsemantics across domains, while simultaneously penalizing similarity between\nforeground and background features to enhance the network's discriminative\npower. This strategy drives the model to actively suppress noisy background\nregions and enhance attention toward identity-relevant foreground cues.\nComprehensive experiments on two holistic and two occluded ReID benchmarks\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the proposed method, with\nresults that match or surpass those of current state-of-the-art approaches.",

For\nexample, high-speed X-ray imaging offers valuable spatial information about\nsubsurface melt pool behavior but is costly and impractical for most industrial\nsettings. In contrast, absorptivity data from low-cost photodiodes correlate\nwith melt pool dynamics but is often too noisy for accurate prediction when\nused alone. In this paper, we propose a multimodal data fusion approach for\npredicting melt pool dynamics by combining high-fidelity X-ray data with\nlow-fidelity absorptivity data in the Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) process.\nOur multimodal learning framework integrates convolutional neural networks\n(CNNs) for spatial feature extraction from X-ray data with recurrent neural\nnetworks (RNNs) for temporal feature extraction from absorptivity signals,\nusing an early fusion strategy. The multimodal model is further used as a\ntransfer learning model to fine-tune the RNN model that can predict melt pool\ndynamics only with absorptivity, with greater accuracy compared to the\nmultimodal model. Results show that training with both modalities significantly\nimproves prediction accuracy compared to using either modality alone.\nFurthermore, once trained, the model can infer melt pool characteristics using\nonly absorptivity data, eliminating the need for expensive X-ray imaging.

    "abstract": "Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) based on ferromagnets are canonical devices\nin spintronics, with wide-ranging applications in data storage, computing, and\nsensing. They simultaneously exhibit mechanisms for electrical detection of\nmagnetic order through the tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) effect, and\nreciprocally, for controlling magnetic order by electric currents through\nspin-transfer torque (STT). It was long assumed that neither of these effects\ncould be sizeable in tunnel junctions made from antiferromagnetic materials,\nsince they exhibit no net magnetization. Recently, however, it was shown that\nall-antiferromagnetic tunnel junctions (AFMTJs) based on chiral\nantiferromagnets do exhibit TMR due to their non-relativistic\nmomentum-dependent spin polarization and cluster magnetic octupole moment,\nwhich are manifestations of their spin-split band structure. However, the\nreciprocal effect, i.e., the antiferromagnetic counterpart of STT driven by\ncurrents through the AFMTJ, has been assumed non-existent due to the total\nelectric current being spin-neutral. Here, in contrast to this common\nexpectation, we report nanoscale AFMTJs exhibiting this reciprocal effect,\nwhich we term octupole-driven spin-transfer torque (OTT). We demonstrate\ncurrent-induced OTT switching of PtMn3|MgO|PtMn3 AFMTJs, fabricated on a\nthermally oxidized silicon substrate, exhibiting a record-high TMR value of\n363% at room temperature and switching current densities of the order of 10\nMA/cm2. Our theoretical modeling explains the origin of OTT in terms of the\nimbalance between intra- and inter-sublattice spin currents across the AFMTJ,\nand equivalently, in terms of the non-zero net cluster octupole polarization of\neach PtMn3 layer. This work establishes a new materials platform for\nantiferromagnetic spintronics and provides a pathway towards deeply scaled\nmagnetic memory and room-temperature terahertz technologies.",

    "abstract": "Physical aging is one of the non-equilibrium phenomena where physical\nproperties change over time due to structural relaxation. Aging in spin glass\nsystems has been explained by a trap model on the temperature-independent\nenergy landscape. Meanwhile, in the free energy landscape (FEL) approach to\naging phenomena, it is assumed that the FEL responds to temperature changes\nwith a time delay. In this paper, aging in a glass forming model in which both\nthe trapping effect and the delayed response of the FEL exist is studied after\nthe temperature is changed. It is confirmed that the trapping effect gives rise\nto Type-I aging where the relaxation time increases with waiting time\nregardless of the direction of temperature change, and that the delayed\nresponse of the FEL produces Type-II aging where the waiting-time dependence of\nthe relaxation time depends on the direction of temperature change. When both\neffects exist and the response time of the FEL is appropriate, these effects\ncan be differentiated in the short-time behavior of the temporal relaxation\ntime. It is argued that the material time or the internal clock and the fictive\ntemperature introduced phenomenologically are understood as the concepts\ndescribing the delayed response of the FEL to temperature change.",

Adapting to a\ncontinuously evolving environment is a safety-critical challenge inevitably\nfaced by all autonomous systems deployed to the real world. Recent work on\ntest-time training proposes methods that adapt to a new test distribution on\nthe fly by optimizing the DNN model for each test input using self-supervision.\nHowever, these techniques result in a sharp increase in inference time as\nmultiple forward and backward passes are required for a single test sample (for\ntest-time training) before finally making the prediction based on the\nfine-tuned features. This is undesirable for real-world robotics applications\nwhere these models may be deployed to resource constraint hardware with strong\nlatency requirements. In this work, we propose a new framework (called UT$^3$)\nthat leverages test-time training for improved performance in the presence of\ncontinuous domain shift while also decreasing the inference time, making it\nsuitable for real-world applications. Our method proposes an uncertainty-aware\nself-supervision task for efficient test-time training that leverages the\nquantified uncertainty to selectively apply the training leading to sharp\nimprovements in the inference time while performing comparably to standard\ntest-time training protocol.

    "abstract": "To fulfill the requirements of space object cataloging and enable automated\nintelligent responses to anomalous events, we designed a novel observation\nscheduling system named Sky Survey Schedule (SSS). This framework facilitates\ncoordinated operations across multi-site observational networks comprising\ndozens of instruments, while simultaneously supporting asteroid monitoring and\ntime-domain astronomy studies. The system implements two principal observation\nmodes: fixed sky regions and target-centered tracking. The former is used for\nsidereal or static observation, while the latter provides dedicated follow-up\ncapabilities for transient targets. The sky regions are divided into latitude\nbands, each of which is subdivided into sectors to ensure minimal overlap and\ncomprehensive coverage. These sectors are mapped to high-level HEALPix sky\ngrids, enabling rapid cross-referencing and correlation between instruments. At\nthe core of SSS lies an adaptive weighting architecture that integrates\nmultiple parameters. Initial target priorities are determined from orbital\ncatalogs containing both known and uncorrelated objects according to cataloging\nrequirements. The system implements dynamic weight adjustments through feedback\nmechanisms: confirmed stable objects receive decaying weights, long-unobserved\ntargets experience weight recovery, while anomalies (e.g., newly detected or\nlost objects) trigger priority escalation. These target-specific weights\ncombine with observational factors - including phase angle constraints, lunar\ninterference, Earth shadowing, and elevation limits - to generate space-time\npriority matrices. This quantitative framework systematically incorporates\noperator-defined priorities for specific regions/targets through configurable\nweight modifiers. Observation plans are dynamically optimized considering:....",

Focusing\non the broad case of sequences of correlated random variables, i.e., classical\nstochastic processes, we tackle the question of determining whether or not two\ndifferent models produce the same observable behavior. This is the problem of\nidentifiability. Curiously, the physics of the model need not correspond to the\nphysics of the observations; recent work has shown that it is even advantageous\n-- in terms of memory and thermal efficiency -- to employ quantum models to\ngenerate classical stochastic processes. We resolve the identifiability problem\nin this regime, providing a means to compare any two models of a classical\nprocess, be the models classical, quantum, or `post-quantum', by mapping them\nto a canonical `generalized' hidden Markov model. Further, this enables us to\nplace (sometimes tight) bounds on the minimal dimension required of a quantum\nmodel to generate a given classical stochastic process.",

While current research primarily focuses on small object\ndetection, instance segmentation for small objects remains underexplored, with\nno dedicated datasets available. This gap stems from the technical challenges\nand high costs of pixel-level annotation for small objects. While the Segment\nAnything Model (SAM) demonstrates impressive zero-shot generalization, its\nperformance on small-object segmentation deteriorates significantly, largely\ndue to the coarse 1/16 feature resolution that causes severe loss of fine\nspatial details. To this end, we propose SOPSeg, a prompt-based framework\nspecifically designed for small object segmentation in remote sensing imagery.\nIt incorporates a region-adaptive magnification strategy to preserve\nfine-grained details, and employs a customized decoder that integrates edge\nprediction and progressive refinement for accurate boundary delineation.\nMoreover, we introduce a novel prompting mechanism tailored to the oriented\nbounding boxes widely adopted in remote sensing applications. SOPSeg\noutperforms existing methods in small object segmentation and facilitates\nefficient dataset construction for remote sensing tasks. We further construct a\ncomprehensive small object instance segmentation dataset based on SODA-A, and\nwill release both the model and dataset to support future research.",

For $\\pi$-stationary $P$ in which $\\pi$ is invariant with\nrespect to $G$, we show that in general $P_{da}$ enjoys favorable convergence\nproperties than $P$ based on metrics such as spectral gap or asymptotic\nvariance, and within the family of $P_{da}$ the most preferable kernel is in\ngeneral $(P_{la})_{ra}$. We demonstrate that $P_{la}, P_{ra}, (P_{la})_{ra}$\nare comparable in terms of mixing times, which supports the use of $P_{la},\nP_{ra}$ in practice as computationally cheaper alternatives over\n$(P_{la})_{ra}$. These averaged kernels also admit natural geometric\ninterpretations: they emerge as unique projections of $P$ onto specific\n$G$-invariant structures under the Kullback-Leibler divergence or the\nHilbert-Schmidt norm and satisfy Pythagorean identities. On the other hand, in\nthe general case if $\\pi$ is not invariant with respect to $G$, we propose and\nstudy a technique that we call state-dependent averaging of Markov kernels\nwhich generalizes the earlier results to this setting. As examples and\napplications, this averaging perspective not only allows us to recast\nstate-of-the-art Markov chain samplers such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo or\npiecewise-deterministic Markov processes as specific cases of $P_{da}$, but\nalso enables improvements to existing samplers such as Metropolis-Hastings,\nachieving rapid mixing in some toy models or when $\\pi$ is the discrete uniform\ndistribution.",

    "abstract": "Few-Shot Medical Image Segmentation (FSMIS) aims to segment novel classes of\nmedical objects using only a few labeled images. Prototype-based methods have\nmade significant progress in addressing FSMIS. However, they typically generate\na single global prototype for the support image to match with the query image,\noverlooking intra-class variations. To address this issue, we propose a\nSelf-guided Prototype Enhancement Network (SPENet). Specifically, we introduce\na Multi-level Prototype Generation (MPG) module, which enables\nmulti-granularity measurement between the support and query images by\nsimultaneously generating a global prototype and an adaptive number of local\nprototypes. Additionally, we observe that not all local prototypes in the\nsupport image are beneficial for matching, especially when there are\nsubstantial discrepancies between the support and query images. To alleviate\nthis issue, we propose a Query-guided Local Prototype Enhancement (QLPE)\nmodule, which adaptively refines support prototypes by incorporating guidance\nfrom the query image, thus mitigating the negative effects of such\ndiscrepancies. Extensive experiments on three public medical datasets\ndemonstrate that SPENet outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods,\nachieving superior performance.",

We present a framework that leverages this\ndiversity to reduce the resources for generating optically heralded spin\ncluster states across $N_q$ emitters from the conventional order $O(N_q)$ to\n$O(1)$ in ensembles of $N_q \\sim 10$-$100$. An optimized pulse sequence\nsimultaneously corrects pulse-length and detuning errors, achieving\nsingle-qubit gate fidelities exceeding $99.99\\%$ for errors (normalized\nrelative to the Rabi drive strength) up to 0.3, while maintaining fidelities\nabove $99\\%$ for errors as large as 0.4. Applied as a Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill\n(CPMG) dynamical decoupling protocol to the dominant noise spectrum of\nsilicon-vacancy centers in diamond, it enhances ensemble coherence times by\nover $7\\times$ compared to interleaved bang-bang based CPMG. For\nstate-of-the-art dilution refrigerators, global resonant optimal decoupling\nacross $N_q$ spins sharply reduces heating, addressing the trade-off between\nthe spin coherence and scaling to $N_q \\gg 1$. We further introduce a modified\nsingle-photon entanglement protocol with an efficient algorithm for\ndeterministic entanglement compilation. Depending on the decoupling time\nwindow, our method yields order $O(10^2$-$10^4)$ more entanglement links than\nbang-bang sequences, with theoretical guarantees of order $\\Omega(N_q)$ unique\nlinks, improvable by control tuning.

The intermediate shell\ncontains ultra-relativistic plasma fluids, with pressure proportional to\ndensity, balancing the interior's repulsive force. The exterior region is a\nvacuum, described by a generalized Schwarzschild solution.

To overcome these limitations, we propose\nautomatically generating high-precision simulated road networks in traffic\nscenario, an efficient and fully automated solution. Initially, real-world road\nstreet view data is collected through open-source street view map platforms,\nand a large-scale street view lane line dataset is constructed to provide a\nrobust foundation for subsequent analysis. Next, an end-to-end lane line\ndetection approach based on deep learning is designed, where a neural network\nmodel is trained to accurately detect the number and spatial distribution of\nlane lines in street view images, enabling automated extraction of lane\ninformation. Subsequently, by integrating coordinate transformation and map\nmatching algorithms, the extracted lane information from street views is fused\nwith the foundational road topology obtained from open-source map service\nplatforms, resulting in the generation of a high-precision lane-level\nsimulation road network. This method significantly reduces the costs associated\nwith data collection and manual editing while enhancing the efficiency and\naccuracy of simulation road network generation.

Following a doubly covariant formalism,\nwe show that the $R^2$-Higgs inflation, when modified by a dimension-six $R^3$\nterm, can account for the high $n_s$ reported by CMB+BAO. In this regard, we\nfind that preheating may play a pivotal role.

    "abstract": "Hawking radiation elucidates black holes as quantum thermodynamic systems,\nthereby establishing a conceptual bridge between general relativity and quantum\nmechanics through particle emission phenomena. While conventional theoretical\nframeworks predominantly focus on classical spacetime configurations, recent\nadvancements in Extended Phase Space thermodynamics have redefined cosmological\nparameters (such as the $\\Lambda$-term) as dynamic variables. Notably, the\nthermodynamics of Anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes has been successfully\nextended to incorporate thermodynamic pressure $P$. Within this extended phase\nspace framework, although numerous intriguing physical phenomena have been\nidentified, the tunneling mechanism of particles incorporating pressure and\nvolume remains unexplored. This study investigates Hawking radiation through\nparticle tunneling in Schwarzschild Anti-de Sitter black holes within the\nextended phase space, where the thermodynamic pressure $P$ is introduced via a\ndynamic cosmological constant $\\Lambda$. By employing semi-classical tunneling\ncalculations with self-gravitation corrections, we demonstrate that emission\nprobabilities exhibit a direct correlation with variations in\nBekenstein-Hawking entropy. Significantly, the radiation spectrum deviates from\npure thermality, aligning with unitary quantum evolution while maintaining\nconsistency with standard phase space results. Moreover, through thermodynamic\nanalysis, we have verified that the emission rate of particles is related to\nthe difference in Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the emitted particles before\nand after they tunnel through the potential barrier. These findings establish\nparticle tunneling as a unified probe of quantum gravitational effects in black\nhole thermodynamics.",

    "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) expand multilingual capabilities, questions\nremain about the equity of their performance across languages. While many\ncommunities stand to benefit from AI systems, the dominance of English in\ntraining data risks disadvantaging non-English speakers. To test the hypothesis\nthat such data disparities may affect model performance, this study compares\ntwo monolingual BERT models: one trained and tested entirely on Swahili data,\nand another on comparable English news data. To simulate how multilingual LLMs\nprocess non-English queries through internal translation and abstraction, we\ntranslated the Swahili news data into English and evaluated it using the\nEnglish-trained model. This approach tests the hypothesis by evaluating whether\ntranslating Swahili inputs for evaluation on an English model yields better or\nworse performance compared to training and testing a model entirely in Swahili,\nthus isolating the effect of language consistency versus cross-lingual\nabstraction. The results prove that, despite high-quality translation, the\nnative Swahili-trained model performed better than the Swahili-to-English\ntranslated model, producing nearly four times fewer errors: 0.36% vs. 1.47%\nrespectively. This gap suggests that translation alone does not bridge\nrepresentational differences between languages and that models trained in one\nlanguage may struggle to accurately interpret translated inputs due to\nimperfect internal knowledge representation, suggesting that native-language\ntraining remains important for reliable outcomes. In educational and\ninformational contexts, even small performance gaps may compound inequality.\nFuture research should focus on addressing broader dataset development for\nunderrepresented languages and renewed attention to multilingual model\nevaluation, ensuring the reinforcing effect of global AI deployment on existing\ndigital divides is reduced.",

This model includes both $V_7$ and $V_8$, which are hybridizations\nbetween localized $4f$- and conduction electrons in $\\Gamma_7$ and $\\Gamma_8$\norbitals, respectively. For the case of $V_7=V_8$ with the local $\\Gamma_5$\ntriplet ground state, we have reported the discovery of a three-channel Kondo\n(TCK) phase, characterized by a residual entropy of $\\log \\phi$ with the golden\nratio $\\phi=(1+\\sqrt{5})/2$.

The boundary curves surrounding the TCK phase\nare determined by the variation of the temperature dependence in entropy and\nthe abrupt change in energy spectra.

Recent studies have utilized the integration of\nCopy-Paste and diffusion models to create more diverse datasets. However, these\nstudies often lack deep collaboration between large language models (LLMs) and\ndiffusion models, and underutilize the rich information within the existing\ntraining data. To address these limitations, we propose InstaDA, a novel,\ntraining-free Dual-Agent system designed to augment instance segmentation\ndatasets. First, we introduce a Text-Agent (T-Agent) that enhances data\ndiversity through collaboration between LLMs and diffusion models. This agent\nfeatures a novel Prompt Rethink mechanism, which iteratively refines prompts\nbased on the generated images. This process not only fosters collaboration but\nalso increases image utilization and optimizes the prompts themselves.\nAdditionally, we present an Image-Agent (I-Agent) aimed at enriching the\noverall data distribution. This agent augments the training set by generating\nnew instances conditioned on the training images. To ensure practicality and\nefficiency, both agents operate as independent and automated workflows,\nenhancing usability.

Traditional SLAM methods, based on static environment\nassumptions, struggle to handle complex dynamic environments. Recent dynamic\nSLAM systems employ geometric constraints and deep learning to remove dynamic\nfeatures, yet this creates a new challenge: insufficient remaining point\nfeatures for subsequent SLAM processes. Existing solutions address this by\ncontinuously introducing additional line and plane features to supplement point\nfeatures, achieving robust tracking and pose estimation. However, current\nmethods continuously introduce additional features regardless of necessity,\ncausing two problems: unnecessary computational overhead and potential\nperformance degradation from accumulated low-quality additional features and\nnoise. To address these issues, this paper proposes a feature-aware mechanism\nthat evaluates whether current features are adequate to determine if line\nfeature support should be activated. This decision mechanism enables the system\nto introduce line features only when necessary, significantly reducing\ncomputational complexity of additional features while minimizing the\nintroduction of low-quality features and noise. In subsequent processing, the\nintroduced line features assist in obtaining better initial camera poses\nthrough tracking, local mapping, and loop closure, but are excluded from global\noptimization to avoid potential negative impacts from low-quality additional\nfeatures in long-term process.

    "abstract": "Registration of serial whole-slide histopathological images (WSIs) is\ncritical for enabling direct comparison across diverse stains and for preparing\npaired datasets in artificial intelligence (AI) workflows such as virtual\nstaining and biomarker prediction. While existing methods often rely on complex\ndeformable or deep learning approaches that are computationally intensive and\ndifficult to reproduce, lightweight rigid frameworks-sufficient for many\nconsecutive-section scenarios-remain underdeveloped. We introduce STAR (Serial\nTissue Alignment for Rigid registration), a fast and robust open-source\nframework for multi-WSI alignment. STAR integrates stain-conditioned\npreprocessing with a hierarchical coarse-to-fine correlation strategy, adaptive\nkernel scaling, and built-in quality control, achieving reliable rigid\nregistration across heterogeneous tissue types and staining protocols,\nincluding hematoxylin-eosin (H&E), special histochemical stains (e.g., PAS,\nPASM, Masson's), and immunohistochemical (IHC) markers (e.g., CD31, KI67).\nEvaluated on the ANHIR 2019 and ACROBAT 2022 datasets spanning multiple organs\nand scanning conditions, STAR consistently produced stable alignments within\nminutes per slide, demonstrating robustness to cross-stain variability and\npartial tissue overlap. Beyond benchmarks, we present case studies on H&E-IHC\nalignment, construction of multi-IHC panels, and typical failure modes,\nunderscoring both utility and limitations. Released as an open and lightweight\ntool, STAR provides a reproducible baseline that lowers the barrier for\nclinical adoption and enables large-scale paired data preparation for\nnext-generation computational pathology.",

    "abstract": "Background Double Kissing Crush (DKC) is a preferred two-stent technique for\ncomplex coronary bifurcation lesions. Proximal cell rewiring is routinely\nrecommended to reduce technical failure, and DKC is considered effective across\nvarious bifurcation angles. However, it remains unclear whether this standard\napproach is optimal for all patients. This study investigates the interaction\nbetween bifurcation angle and rewiring configuration to identify\nanatomy-specific strategies. Methods Computational modeling of the DKC\nprocedure was used to simulate 12 DKC procedures across three left main\nbifurcation angles (45{\\deg}, 70{\\deg}, and 100{\\deg}) and four rewiring\nconfigurations: proximal-proximal (P-P), proximal-distal (P-D), distal-proximal\n(D-P), and distal-distal (D-D). Evaluation metrics included stent\nmalapposition, side branch ostium clearance, arterial wall stress, low\ntime-averaged endothelial shear stress, and high shear rates. Results DKC\nperformed in wide bifurcations (100{\\deg}) resulted in worse outcomes, with\nmalapposition reaching 18%, side branch clearance down to 23%, and up to twice\nthe exposure to adverse high shear rates compared to narrower angles. In\ncontrast, intermediate (70{\\deg}) and narrow (45{\\deg}) angles generally\nresulted in more favorable outcomes, though optimal rewiring varied by angle.\nProximal strategies, i.e. P-P and P-D, were most effective at 70{\\deg}, while\nD-D performed best at 45{\\deg}. No single strategy was consistently superior\nacross all bifurcation angles. Conclusions DKC outcomes depend on bifurcation\nangle and can be optimized by tailoring rewiring strategies, challenging the\ncurrent clinical understanding. These findings support anatomy-specific\nprocedural planning and intravascular imaging to guide rewiring. This study\nprovides a mechanistic rationale to improve clinical decision-making and tailor\nbifurcation interventions.",

Our analysis reveals a\nfundamental tension between early- and late-universe constraints within both\nframeworks: ACT favors a quintom scenario where the dark energy equation of\nstate (EoS) evolves from $w>-1$ at early times to $w<-1$ at late times, while\nDESI+DESY5 exhibits a distinct preference for quintessence where $w>-1$ across\ncosmic evolution. The joint analysis yields constraints that align more closely\nwith the ACT preference. Critically, the canonical RDE model fails to provide a\ncoherent description of cosmic evolution, as it manifests severe tensions (even\nexceeding $10\\sigma$ significance) between early- and late-universe parameter\nreconstructions. Based on the combined data, Bayesian evidence decisively\ndisfavors both HDE and RDE models relative to the $\\Lambda$ cold dark matter\nmodel, with ACT providing decisive disfavor and DESI+DESY5 yielding moderate\ndisfavor.

Recent work proposed the\nfirst-order method, F${}^2$SA, achieving the\n$\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\epsilon^{-6})$ upper complexity bound for first-order\nsmooth problems. This is slower than the optimal $\\Omega(\\epsilon^{-4})$\ncomplexity lower bound in its single-level counterpart. In this work, we show\nthat faster rates are achievable for higher-order smooth problems. We first\nreformulate F$^2$SA as approximating the hyper-gradient with a forward\ndifference. Based on this observation, we propose a class of methods\nF${}^2$SA-$p$ that uses $p$th-order finite difference for hyper-gradient\napproximation and improves the upper bound to $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(p\n\\epsilon^{4-p/2})$ for $p$th-order smooth problems. Finally, we demonstrate\nthat the $\\Omega(\\epsilon^{-4})$ lower bound also holds for stochastic bilevel\nproblems when the high-order smoothness holds for the lower-level variable,\nindicating that the upper bound of F${}^2$SA-$p$ is nearly optimal in the\nhighly smooth region $p = \\Omega( \\log \\epsilon^{-1} / \\log \\log\n\\epsilon^{-1})$.",

We find that lithium abundances in NGC 188 are lower than\npredictions from standard stellar evolution theory. As expected, stars in NGC\n188 are more lithium-depleted than those in the younger Hyades and Praesepe\nclusters (650 Myr).

    "abstract": "In self-supervised reinforcement learning (RL), one of the key challenges is\nlearning a diverse set of skills to prepare agents for unknown future tasks.\nDespite impressive advances, scalability and evaluation remain prevalent\nissues. Regarding scalability, the search for meaningful skills can be obscured\nby high-dimensional feature spaces, where relevant features may vary across\ndownstream task domains. For evaluating skill diversity, defining what\nconstitutes \"diversity\" typically requires a hard commitment to a specific\nnotion of what it means for skills to be diverse, potentially leading to\ninconsistencies in how skill diversity is understood, making results across\ndifferent approaches hard to compare, and leaving many forms of diversity\nunexplored. To address these issues, we adopt a measure of sample diversity\nthat translates ideas from ecology to machine learning -- the Vendi Score --\nallowing the user to specify and evaluate any desired form of diversity. We\ndemonstrate how this metric facilitates skill evaluation and introduce VendiRL,\na unified framework for learning diversely diverse sets of skills. Given\ndistinct similarity functions, VendiRL motivates distinct forms of diversity,\nwhich could support skill-diversity pretraining in new and richly interactive\nenvironments where optimising for various forms of diversity may be desirable.",

    "abstract": "In this work, tunable vanadium dioxide (VO2) metafilms on different substrate\nmaterials fabricated via low-oxygen furnace oxidation are demonstrated for\nself-adaptive daytime solar heating and nighttime radiative cooling. Because of\nits thermally-driven insulator-to-metal phase transition behavior, the VO2\nmetafilms work as spectrally-selective solar absorber with a high solar\nabsorptance of 0.86 and a low infrared emissivity of ~0.2 at daytime, while\nthey behave as selective cooler at nighttime to dissipate heat effectively\nthrough the atmospheric transparency window with a high emissivity of ~0.76 to\ncold outer space. From the outdoor vacuum tests, a significant temperature rise\nup to 169 K upon solar heating and a temperature drop of 17 K at night are\nexperimentally observed from these tunable VO2 metafilms. With the atmosphere\ntemperature fitted in-situ, the accurate heat transfer model shows excellent\nagreement with the stagnation temperature measurement, and indicates a high\nheating power of ~400 W/m2 at 80{\\deg}C sample temperature in the middle of the\nday, and a cooling power of ~60 W/m2 at 30{\\deg}C in equilibrium with ambient\nat night. This work would facilitate the development of self-adaptive coatings\nwith cost-effective and scalable fabrication approaches for all-day energy\nharvesting.",

    "abstract": "Detecting elephants through seismic signals is an emerging research topic\naimed at developing solutions for Human-Elephant Conflict (HEC). Despite the\npromising results, such solutions heavily rely on manual classification of\nelephant footfalls, which limits their applicability for real-time\nclassification in natural settings. To address this limitation and build on our\nprevious work, this study introduces a classification framework targeting\nresource-constrained implementations, prioritizing both accuracy and\ncomputational efficiency. As part of this framework, a novel event detection\ntechnique named Contextually Customized Windowing (CCW), tailored specifically\nfor detecting elephant footfalls, was introduced, and evaluations were\nconducted by comparing it with the Short-Term Average/Long-Term Average\n(STA/LTA) method. The yielded results show that the maximum validated detection\nrange was 155.6 m in controlled conditions and 140 m in natural environments.\nElephant footfall classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a\nRadial Basis Function (RBF) kernel demonstrated superior performance across\nmultiple settings, achieving an accuracy of 99% in controlled environments, 73%\nin natural elephant habitats, and 70% in HEC-prone human habitats, the most\nchallenging scenario. Furthermore, feature impact analysis using explainable AI\nidentified the number of Zero Crossings and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)\nAlignment Cost as the most influential factors in all experiments, while\nPredominant Frequency exhibited significant influence in controlled settings.",

We propose KG-DG, a neuro-symbolic framework for diabetic retinopathy\n(DR) classification that integrates vision transformers with expert-guided\nsymbolic reasoning to enable robust generalization across unseen domains. Our\napproach leverages clinical lesion ontologies through structured, rule-based\nfeatures and retinal vessel segmentation, fusing them with deep visual\nrepresentations via a confidence-weighted integration strategy. The framework\naddresses both single-domain generalization (SDG) and multi-domain\ngeneralization (MDG) by minimizing the KL divergence between domain embeddings,\nthereby enforcing alignment of high-level clinical semantics. Extensive\nexperiments across four public datasets (APTOS, EyePACS, Messidor-1,\nMessidor-2) demonstrate significant improvements: up to a 5.2% accuracy gain in\ncross-domain settings and a 6% improvement over baseline ViT models. Notably,\nour symbolic-only model achieves a 63.67% average accuracy in MDG, while the\ncomplete neuro-symbolic integration achieves the highest accuracy compared to\nexisting published baselines and benchmarks in challenging SDG scenarios.\nAblation studies reveal that lesion-based features (84.65% accuracy)\nsubstantially outperform purely neural approaches, confirming that symbolic\ncomponents act as effective regularizers beyond merely enhancing\ninterpretability.

    "abstract": "We investigate the problem of finding a static treasure in anonymous graphs\nusing oblivious agents and introduce a novel approach that leverages quantum\ninformation. In anonymous graphs, vertices are unlabelled, indistinguishable,\nand edges are locally labelled with port numbers. Agents typically rely on\nstationary classical pebbles placed by an oracle to guide their search.\nHowever, this classical approach is constrained by limited information\ntransmission and high traversal complexity. Classical pebbles are not\nsufficient for search if the agents are oblivious. We propose the first use of\nquantum pebbles for search in anonymous graphs. Quantum pebbles periodically\nemit qubits in a fixed quantum state. Each pebble encodes the port number to\nthe next node using a unique quantum state. The agent determines the correct\npath by performing measurements in multiple bases, exploiting the probabilistic\nnature of quantum measurement to distinguish states. We show that this strategy\nenables an oblivious agent to locate the treasure in $D$ steps using $D$\nquantum pebbles, where $D$ is the length of the shortest path between the\nstarting point and the treasure. Moreover, only $O((\\log D + \\log \\Delta)/(\\log\n1/\\delta))$ measurements per node are required to ensure high success\nprobability in a graph with maximum degree $\\Delta$ where $\\delta =\n\\cos^2(\\frac{\\pi}{2\\Delta})$. We propose the use of quantum information as a\nguidance mechanism in anonymous graph search. We demonstrate that quantum\npebbles can not only emulate the functionality of classical pebbles but can do\nso with improved efficiency, offering a promising direction for future\nquantum-enhanced distributed algorithms.",

This study\npresents the first comprehensive evaluation of transformer-based architectures\nfor detecting minority stress in online discourse. We benchmark multiple\ntransformer models including ELECTRA, BERT, RoBERTa, and BART against\ntraditional machine learning baselines and graph-augmented variants. We further\nassess zero-shot and few-shot learning paradigms to assess their applicability\non underrepresented datasets. Experiments are conducted on the two largest\npublicly available Reddit corpora for minority stress detection, comprising\n12,645 and 5,789 posts, and are repeated over five random seeds to ensure\nrobustness. Our results demonstrate that integrating graph structure\nconsistently improves detection performance across transformer-only models and\nthat supervised fine-tuning with relational context outperforms zero and\nfew-shot approaches. Theoretical analysis reveals that modeling social\nconnectivity and conversational context via graph augmentation sharpens the\nmodels' ability to identify key linguistic markers such as identity\nconcealment, internalized stigma, and calls for support, suggesting that\ngraph-enhanced transformers offer the most reliable foundation for digital\nhealth interventions and public health policy.",

We quantify radial velocity\nvariations between sub-exposures to identify binary candidates, and also\nmeasure the orbital period for a subset of DWD binary candidates. We find 63\nDWD binary candidates, of which 43 are new discoveries, and we provide\ntentative periods for 10 binary systems.

We predict that $\\leq 5$\nsystems in our sample should be detectable via gravitational waves by LISA\n(Laser Interferometer Space Antenna), one of which has already been identified\nas a LISA verification source.

    "abstract": "Sim2Real domain transfer offers a cost-effective and scalable approach for\ndeveloping LiDAR-based perception (e.g., object detection, tracking,\nsegmentation) in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). However, perception\nmodels trained in simulation often under perform on real-world data due to\ndistributional shifts. To address this Sim2Real gap, this paper proposes a\nhigh-fidelity digital twin (HiFi DT) framework that incorporates real-world\nbackground geometry, lane-level road topology, and sensor-specific\nspecifications and placement. We formalize the domain adaptation challenge\nunderlying Sim2Real learning and present a systematic method for constructing\nsimulation environments that yield in-domain synthetic data. An off-the-shelf\n3D object detector is trained on HiFi DT-generated synthetic data and evaluated\non real data. Our experiments show that the DT-trained model outperforms the\nequivalent model trained on real data by 4.8%. To understand this gain, we\nquantify distributional alignment between synthetic and real data using\nmultiple metrics, including Chamfer Distance (CD), Maximum Mean Discrepancy\n(MMD), Earth Mover's Distance (EMD), and Fr'echet Distance (FD), at both\nraw-input and latent-feature levels. Results demonstrate that HiFi DTs\nsubstantially reduce domain shift and improve generalization across diverse\nevaluation scenarios.
