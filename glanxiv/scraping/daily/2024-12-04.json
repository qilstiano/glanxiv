    "abstract": "Community detection is the task of clustering objects based on their pairwise\nrelationships. Most of the model-based community detection methods, such as the\nstochastic block model and its variants, are designed for networks with binary\n(yes/no) edges. In many practical scenarios, edges often possess continuous\nweights, spanning positive and negative values, which reflect varying levels of\nconnectivity. To address this challenge, we introduce the heterogeneous block\ncovariance model (HBCM) that defines a community structure within the\ncovariance matrix, where edges have signed and continuous weights. Furthermore,\nit takes into account the heterogeneity of objects when forming connections\nwith other objects within a community. A novel variational\nexpectation-maximization algorithm is proposed to estimate the group\nmembership. The HBCM provides provable consistent estimates of memberships, and\nits promising performance is observed in numerical simulations with different\nsetups. The model is applied to a single-cell RNA-seq dataset of a mouse embryo\nand a stock price dataset. Supplementary materials for this article are\navailable online.",

Significant wall slip was observed in HDPE\nunder non-linear conditions, complicating the characterization of its damping\nfunction using step strain data. In contrast, TPE exhibited negligible wall\nslip across a wide range of strains and shear rates, facilitating successful\nparameterization of its damping function using the Wagner-type K-BKZ equation\nand enabling accurate predictions of various material functions.

We apply a hybrid supervised-unsupervised method to classify\n$\\sim 14,000$ galaxies in the CANDELS fields at $0.2 \\leq z \\leq 2.4$ into\nspheroid, disk, and irregular systems. Unlike previous works, our method is\napplied to redshift bins of width 0.2. Comparison between models applied to a\nwide redshift range versus bin-specific models reveals significant differences\nin galaxy morphology beyond $z \\geq 1$ and a consistent $\\sim 25\\%$\ndisagreement. This suggests that using a single model across wide redshift\nranges may introduce biases due to the large time intervals involved compared\nto galaxy evolution timescales. Using the FERENGI code to assess the impact of\ncosmological effects, we find that flux dimming and smaller angular scales may\nlead to the misclassification of up to $18\\%$ of disk galaxies as spheroids or\nirregulars. Contrary to previous studies, we find an almost constant fraction\nof disks ($\\sim 60\\%$) and spheroids ($\\sim 30\\%$) across redshifts. We\nattribute discrepancies with earlier works, which suggest a decreasing fraction\nof disks beyond $z \\sim 1$, to the biases introduced by visual classification.\nOur claim is further strengthened by the striking agreement to the results\nreported by Lee et al.

Exploring mass dependence, we observe a\n$\\sim 40\\%$ increase in the fraction of massive ($M_{\\rm stellar} \\geq\n10^{10.5}{\\rm M}_{\\odot}$) spheroids with decreasing redshift, well balanced\nwith a decrease of $\\sim 20\\%$ in the fraction of $M_{\\rm stellar} \\geq\n10^{10.5}{\\rm M}_{\\odot}$ disks, suggesting that merging massive disk galaxies\nmay form spheroidal systems.",

We also present a sharper version of the so-called Laurent-Massart\ninequality (LM inequality) through which we are able to increase the absolute\nconstant in HW inequality from its largest currently available value of $0.134$\ndue to LM~inequality itself to at least $0.152$ in the positive-semidefinite\ncase. Generalizing HW inequality in the symmetric case, we derive a sequence of\nconcentration bounds for Gaussian quadratic chaos indexed over $m=1,2,3,\\cdots$\nthat involves the Schatten norms of the underlying matrix. The case $m=1$\nreduces to HW inequality. These bounds exhibit a phase transition in behaviour\nin the sense that $m=1$ results in the tightest bound if the deviation is\nsmaller than a critical threshold and the bounds keep getting tighter as the\nindex $m$ increases when the deviation is larger than the aforementioned\nthreshold. Finally, we derive a concentration bound that is asymptotically\ntighter than HW inequality both in the small and large deviation regimes.\nFinally, we explore concentration bounds when the underlying matrix is\npositive-semidefinite and only the dimension~$n$ and its operator norm (largest\neigenvalue) are known.

Existing\ntechniques, however, focus exclusively on synthesizer training, assuming that\nthe training data is already preprocessed and that the desired synthetic data\ncan be delivered in one shot, without any hyperparameter tuning. In this paper,\nwe propose an end-to-end collaborative framework for publishing of synthetic\ndata that accounts for privacy-preserving preprocessing as well as evaluation.\nWe instantiate this framework with Secure Multiparty Computation (MPC)\nprotocols and evaluate it in a use case for privacy-preserving publishing of\nsynthetic genomic data for leukemia.",

The goal is to\nsupport the design of AI systems that can enhance learner conceptual\nunderstanding of algebra by taking into account their current level of algebra\ncomprehension. The data set comprises 55 misconceptions about algebra, common\nerrors, and 220 diagnostic examples identified in previous peer-reviewed\nstudies. We provide an example application using a large language model,\nobserving a range of precision and recall scores depending on the topic and\nexperimental setup that reaches 83.9% when including educator feedback and\nrestricting it by topic. We found that topics such as ratios and proportions\nprove as difficult for LLMs as they are for students. We included a human\nassessment of LLMs results and feedback from five middle school math educators\non the clarity and occurrence of misconceptions in the dataset and the\npotential use of AI in conjunction with the dataset. Most educators (80% or\nmore) indicated that they encounter these misconceptions among their students,\nsuggesting the relevance of the data set to teaching middle school algebra.\nDespite varying familiarity with AI tools, four out of five educators expressed\ninterest in using the data set with AI to diagnose student misconceptions or\ntrain teachers. The results emphasize the importance of topic-constrained\ntesting, the need for multimodal approaches, and the relevance of human\nexpertise to gain practical insights when using AI for human learning.",

For one algorithm, we present a direct map\nbetween the Born-Oppenheimer Hamiltonian describing the wavepacket\ntime-evolution and the control parameters of a spin-lattice Hamiltonian that\ndescribes the dynamics of qubit states in an ion-trap quantum computer. This\nmap is exact for three qubits, and when implemented, the dynamics of the spin\nstates emulate those of the nuclear wavepacket. However, this map becomes\napproximate as the number of qubits grow. In a second algorithm we present a\ngeneral quantum circuit decomposition formalism for such problems using a\nmethod called the Quantum Shannon Decomposition. This algorithm is more robust\nand is exact for any number of qubits, at the cost of increased circuit\ncomplexity. The resultant circuit is implemented on IBM's quantum simulator\n(QASM) for 3-7 qubits.

This work\nfocuses on the performance of the E91 quantum key distribution protocol under\nthe variation of two elements: first, the phase in the input state when the\nprotocol is implemented using entangled photons generated via the radiative\ncascade, and second, the relative directions of the polarization analyzers.

    "abstract": "Directly probing deep tissue activities from body surfaces offers a\nnoninvasive approach to monitoring essential physiological processes1-3.\nHowever, this method is technically challenged by rapid signal attenuation\ntoward the body surface and confounding motion artifacts4-6 primarily due to\nexcessive contact impedance and mechanical mismatch with conventional\nelectrodes. Herein, by formulating and directly spray coating biocompatible\ntwo-dimensional nanosheet ink onto the human body under ambient conditions, we\ncreate microscopically conformal and adaptive van der Waals thin films (VDWTFs)\nthat seamlessly merge with non-Euclidean, hairy, and dynamically evolving body\nsurfaces. Unlike traditional deposition methods, which often struggle with\nconformality and adaptability while retaining high electronic performance, this\ngentle process enables the formation of high-performance VDWTFs directly on the\nbody surface under bio-friendly conditions, making it ideal for biological\napplications. This results in low-impedance electrically functionalized body\nsurfaces (EFBS), enabling highly robust monitoring of biopotential and\nbioimpedance modulations associated with deep-tissue activities, such as blood\ncirculation, muscle movements, and brain activities. Compared to commercial\nsolutions, our VDWTF-EFBS exhibits nearly two-orders of magnitude lower contact\nimpedance and substantially reduces the extrinsic motion artifacts, enabling\nreliable extraction of bioelectrical signals from irregular surfaces, such as\nunshaved human scalps.

INR-based ISR methods typically learn\ncontinuous representations, providing flexibility for generating\nhigh-resolution images at any desired scale from their low-resolution\ncounterparts. However, existing INR-based ISR methods utilize multi-layer\nperceptrons for parameterization in the network; this does not take account of\nthe hierarchical structure existing in local sampling points and hence\nconstrains the representation capability. In this paper, we propose a new\n\\textbf{H}ierarchical encoding based \\textbf{I}mplicit \\textbf{I}mage\n\\textbf{F}unction for continuous image super-resolution, \\textbf{HIIF}, which\nleverages a novel hierarchical positional encoding that enhances the local\nimplicit representation, enabling it to capture fine details at multiple\nscales. Our approach also embeds a multi-head linear attention mechanism within\nthe implicit attention network by taking additional non-local information into\naccount. Our experiments show that, when integrated with different backbone\nencoders, HIIF outperforms the state-of-the-art continuous image\nsuper-resolution methods by up to 0.17dB in PSNR.

To account for\nsuch uncertainties and factors involved in haze degradation, we introduce a\nvariational Bayesian framework for single image dehazing.

Based on a physical\nmodel for haze degradation, our variational Bayesian framework leads to a new\nobjective function that encourages the cooperation between them, facilitating\nthe joint training of and thereby boosting the performance of each other. In\nour framework, a dehazing network can estimate a clean image independently of a\ntransmission map estimation during inference, introducing no overhead.\nFurthermore, our model-agnostic framework can be seamlessly incorporated with\nother existing dehazing networks, greatly enhancing the performance\nconsistently across datasets and models.",

The undercooled melts show a pronounced short-range order,\nmajorly a five-fold symmetry (FFS) around the Cu atoms, which competes with bcc\nordering. This complex SRO is also reflected in the partial coordination\nnumbers, where mainly a Z12 coordination is present around Cu, which\ncorresponds to an icosahedral ordering.

The increasing\nFrank-Kasper polyhedra coordination scenario around Ti impacts on the\ninteratomic distances of Ti atoms, which increase with increasing Ti content.\nThe Cu$_{50}$Ti$_{50}$ composition exhibits the highest FFS ordering and amount\nof Frank-Kasper polyhedra, which explains the slowest melt dynamics, found\nexperimentally and in simulations for this composition.

However, hallucination, where models generate\ninaccurate or misleading content, remains underexplored in the video domain.\nBuilding on the observation that MLLM visual encoders often fail to distinguish\nvisually different yet semantically similar video pairs, we introduce\nVidHalluc, the largest benchmark designed to examine hallucinations in MLLMs\nfor video understanding. It consists of 5,002 videos, paired to highlight cases\nprone to hallucinations. VidHalluc assesses hallucinations across three\ncritical dimensions: (1) action, (2) temporal sequence, and (3) scene\ntransition. Comprehensive testing shows that most MLLMs are vulnerable to\nhallucinations across these dimensions. Furthermore, we propose DINO-HEAL, a\ntraining-free method that reduces hallucinations by incorporating spatial\nsaliency from DINOv2 to reweight visual features during inference. Our results\nshow that DINO-HEAL consistently improves performance on VidHalluc, achieving\nan average improvement of 3.02% in mitigating hallucinations across all tasks.\nBoth the VidHalluc benchmark and DINO-HEAL code are available at\nhttps://people-robots.github.io/vidhalluc.",

However, quantifying the drivers of trends in wildfires and\nsubsequent smoke exposure is challenging, as both natural variability and\nanthropogenic climate change play important roles. Here we devise an approach\ninvolving observed meteorology and vegetation and a range of models to\ndetermine the relative roles of anthropogenic climate change and natural\nvariability in driving burned area across the western US. We also examine the\ninfluence of anthropogenic climate change on smoke exposure. We estimate that\nanthropogenic climate change accounts for 33-82% of observed total burned area,\ndepending on the ecoregion, yielding 65% of total fire emissions on average\nacross the western US from 1992 to 2020. In all ecoregions except Mediterranean\nCalifornia, anthropogenic climate change contributes to a greater percentage of\nburned area in lightning-caused wildfires than in human-caused wildfires. On\naverage, anthropogenic climate change contributes 49% to smoke PM2.5\nconcentrations in the western US from 1997 to 2020, and explains 58% of the\nincreasing trend in smoke PM2.5 from 2010 to 2020.

This requires introducing the notion of\n(maximal) Lyapunov exponent in this general context of Lipschitz\ntransformations on compact metric spaces.

To estimate\ninterference-aware causal effects, a traditional approach is to inherit the\nindependent settings, where practitioners randomly assign experimental\nparticipants into different groups and compare their outcomes. While effective\nin offline settings, this strategy becomes problematic in sequential\nexperiments, where suboptimal decision persists, leading to substantial regret.\nTo address this issue, we introduce a unified interference-aware framework for\nonline experimental design.

On\nthe other hand, the resulting jamiton has a greater length than the incoming\nones. Finally, the behavior for various driver reaction times is explored. It\nis obtained that some properties do not depend on that time, such as the\namplitude, exit velocity, or maximum density, while the exit length does depend\non driver reaction time.",

    "abstract": "Background: Liver diseases present a significant global health challenge and\noften require costly, invasive diagnostics. Electrocardiography (ECG), a widely\navailable and non-invasive tool, can enable the detection of liver disease by\ncapturing cardiovascular-hepatic interactions.\n  Methods: We trained tree-based machine learning models on ECG features to\ndetect liver diseases using two large datasets: MIMIC-IV-ECG (467,729 patients,\n2008-2019) and ECG-View II (775,535 patients, 1994-2013). The task was framed\nas binary classification, with performance evaluated via the area under the\nreceiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). To improve interpretability,\nwe applied explainability methods to identify key predictive features.\n  Findings: The models showed strong predictive performance with good\ngeneralizability. For example, AUROCs for alcoholic liver disease (K70) were\n0.8025 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.8020-0.8035) internally and 0.7644 (95%\nCI, 0.7641-0.7649) externally; for hepatic failure (K72), scores were 0.7404\n(95% CI, 0.7389-0.7415) and 0.7498 (95% CI, 0.7494-0.7509), respectively. The\nexplainability analysis consistently identified age and prolonged QTc intervals\n(corrected QT, reflecting ventricular repolarization) as key predictors.\nFeatures linked to autonomic regulation and electrical conduction abnormalities\nwere also prominent, supporting known cardiovascular-liver connections and\nsuggesting QTc as a potential biomarker.\n  Interpretation: ECG-based machine learning offers a promising, interpretable\napproach for liver disease detection, particularly in resource-limited\nsettings.

    "abstract": "Advances in tracking technologies have spurred the rapid growth of\nlarge-scale trajectory data. Building a compact collection of pathlets,\nreferred to as a trajectory pathlet dictionary, is essential for supporting\nmobility-related applications. Existing methods typically adopt a top-down\napproach, generating numerous candidate pathlets and selecting a subset,\nleading to high memory usage and redundant storage from overlapping pathlets.\nTo overcome these limitations, we propose a bottom-up strategy that\nincrementally merges basic pathlets to build the dictionary, reducing memory\nrequirements by up to 24,000 times compared to baseline methods. The approach\nbegins with unit-length pathlets and iteratively merges them while optimizing\nutility, which is defined using newly introduced metrics of trajectory loss and\nrepresentability. We develop a deep reinforcement learning framework,\nPathletRL, which utilizes Deep Q-Networks (DQN) to approximate the utility\nfunction, resulting in a compact and efficient pathlet dictionary. Experiments\non both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method\noutperforms state-of-the-art techniques, reducing the size of the constructed\ndictionary by up to 65.8%. Additionally, our results show that only half of the\ndictionary pathlets are needed to reconstruct 85% of the original trajectory\ndata. Building on PathletRL, we introduce PathletRL++, which extends the\noriginal model by incorporating a richer state representation and an improved\nreward function to optimize decision-making during pathlet merging. These\nenhancements enable the agent to gain a more nuanced understanding of the\nenvironment, leading to higher-quality pathlet dictionaries. PathletRL++\nachieves even greater dictionary size reduction, surpassing the performance of\nPathletRL, while maintaining high trajectory representability.",

This capability is known to be a core step towards\nthe self-improving models in recent large language model studies. In this\npaper, we present Vision Value Model (VisVM) that can guide VLM inference-time\nsearch to generate responses with better visual comprehension. Specifically,\nVisVM not only evaluates the generated sentence quality in the current search\nstep, but also anticipates the quality of subsequent sentences that may result\nfrom the current step, thus providing a long-term value. In this way, VisVM\nsteers VLMs away from generating sentences prone to hallucinations or\ninsufficient detail, thereby producing higher quality responses. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that VisVM-guided search significantly enhances VLMs'\nability to generate descriptive captions with richer visual details and fewer\nhallucinations, compared with greedy decoding and search methods with other\nvisual reward signals. Furthermore, we find that self-training the model with\nthe VisVM-guided captions improve VLM's performance across a wide range of\nmultimodal benchmarks, indicating the potential for developing self-improving\nVLMs. Our value model and code are available at\nhttps://github.com/si0wang/VisVM.",

We present results on the correlation between\nthe 2175{\\AA} feature and PAH abundances in a spatially-resolved manner for 15\nlocal galaxies in the PHANGS-JWST survey that have NUV and mid-IR imaging data\nfrom Swift/UVOT and JWST/MIRI, respectively. We find a moderate positive\ncorrelation between the 2175{\\AA} feature strength and PAH abundance, albeit\nwith large intrinsic scatter. However, most of this trend can be attributed to\na stronger negative correlation of both quantities with SFR surface density and\nspecific-SFR (proxies of ionising radiation). The latter trends are consistent\nwith previous findings that both the 2175{\\AA} carrier and PAHs are small\ngrains that are easily destroyed by UV photons, although the proxy for PAH\nabundance could also be influenced by dust heating. When controlling for SFR\nsurface density, we find weaker correlations between the 2175{\\AA} feature and\nPAH abundances, disfavouring a direct link. However, analyses based on\nspectroscopic measurements of the 2175{\\AA} feature and PAH features are\nrequired to verify our findings. No significant trends with gas-phase\nmetallicity are found for the 2175{\\AA} feature and PAHs, however the\nmetallicity range of our sample is limited. We provide prescriptions for the\nstrength of the 2175{\\AA} feature and PAHs in local massive (metal-rich)\ngalaxies with SFR surface density and specific-SFR, however the former should\nbe used with caution since bump strengths measured from Swift/UVOT are expected\nto be underestimated.",

In\n2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) such as tungsten diselenide\n(WSe$_2$), quantum emission has been broadly attributed to exciton localization\nfrom atomic point defects, yet the precise microscopic picture is not fully\nunderstood. This work presents a new framework, supported by both computational\nand experimental evidence, to explain both the origins of facile SPE in WSe2\nand the relative scarcity of SPE in the related 2D TMD, tungsten disulfide\n(WS$_2$). A vertical divacancy configuration of selenium creates a\ndefect-centered, direct energy gap in the band structure of WSe2, giving rise\nto highly localized, radiative transitions. This configuration is shown to be\nenergetically preferred in the monolayer lattice, which is reflected in the\nabundant experimental observation of SPE in WSe2 both from the literature and\nthis work. In contrast, the same vertical divacancy configuration in WS2 does\nnot create direct localized transitions, consistent with scarce observations of\nSPE in that material. By revealing a single mechanism in tungsten-based TMDs\nthat addresses the prevalence of SPE and is consistent between theory and\nexperiment, these results provide a framework for better understanding the\nrules governing the atomic origins of single photon emission in TMDs.",

Soft errors are an increasing concern in\nmodern digital processors since smaller transistor geometries and lower\nvoltages give electronic devices a higher sensitivity to background radiation.\nThe resilience of deep neural network (DNN) models to perturbations in their\nparameters is determined, to a large extent, by the structure of the model\nitself, and also by the selected numerical representation and used arithmetic\nprecision. When compression techniques such as model pruning and model\nquantization are applied to reduce memory footprint and computational\ncomplexity for deployment, both model structure and numerical representation\nare modified and thus, soft error robustness also changes. In this sense,\nalthough the choice of activation functions (AFs) in DNN models is frequently\nignored, it conditions not only their accuracy and trainability, but also\ncompressibility rates and numerical robustness.

    "abstract": "Water has proven to be ubiquitously detected in near-infrared (NIR)\ntransmission spectroscopy observations of hot Jupiter atmospheres, including\nWASP-17b. However, previous analyses of WASP-17b's atmosphere based upon Hubble\nSpace Telescope (HST) and Spitzer data could not constrain the water abundance,\nfinding that sub-solar, super-solar and bimodal posterior distributions were\nall statistically valid. In this work, we observe one transit of the hot\nJupiter WASP-17b using JWST's Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph\nSingle Object Slitless Spectroscopy (NIRISS SOSS) mode. We analyze our data\nusing three independent data analysis pipelines, finding excellent agreement\nbetween results. Our transmission spectrum shows multiple H$_2$O absorption\nfeatures and a flatter slope towards the optical than seen in previous HST\nobservations. We analyze our spectrum using both PICASO+Virga forward models\nand free retrievals. POSEIDON retrievals provide a well-constrained super-solar\n$\\log$(H$_2$O) abundance (-2.96$^{+0.31}_{-0.24}$), breaking the degeneracy\nfrom the previous HST/Spitzer analysis. We verify our POSEIDON results with\npetitRADTRANS retrievals. Additionally, we constrain the abundance of\n$\\log$(H$^-$), -10.19$^{+0.30}_{-0.23}$, finding that our model including H$^-$\nis preferred over our model without H$^-$ to 5.1 $\\sigma$. Furthermore, we\nconstrain the $\\log$(K) abundance (-8.07$^{+0.58}_{-0.52}$) in WASP-17b's\natmosphere for the first time using space-based observations. Our abundance\nconstraints demonstrate the power of NIRISS SOSS's increased resolution,\nprecision, and wavelength range to improve upon previous NIR space-based\nresults.

We examine trends in galaxy assembly by analyzing the median\n$\\mu_g$ profiles in different SFG and QG \\msS ranges with decreasing redshift\nand connecting evolution in galaxy $\\mu_g$ profiles with the underlying stellar\nmass growth in galaxies. Since $z=1.1$, the majority of evolution in the median\n$\\mu_g$ profiles of galaxies ($\\sim$64$\\%$ in SFGs and $\\sim$71$\\%$ in QGs)\noccurs throughout their stellar halo regions (2-10$R_e$). More massive galaxies\nassemble stellar halo material more rapidly at $0.2 \\leq z \\leq 1.1$. Over this\nperiod, QGs grow a larger fraction of their stellar haloes than SFGs at fixed\n$M_{\\star}$ (factor of $\\sim$1.2). Although star formation can account for the\nstellar halo growth observed in low-mass SFGs ($10^{9.5}M_\\odot \\leq M_\\star <\n10^{10.5}M_\\odot$), high-mass SFGs ($M_\\star \\geq 10^{10.5}M_\\odot$) and both\nlow- and high-mass QGs require an additional assembly mechanism. Our results\nsuggest accretion via minor mergers drives additional stellar halo growth in\nthese galaxies. The contribution from accretion is larger in more massive\ngalaxies (over $M_{\\star} \\geq 10^{9.5}M_{\\odot}$), and QGs exhibit larger\nfractional increases to their ex-situ fractions over $0.2 \\leq z \\leq 1.1$ than\nSFGs at fixed $M_{\\star}$.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we develop the first comprehensive tutorial on designing\nfuture 6G networks that synergistically integrate notions of resilience and\ncriticality from the ground up. While resilience refers to the ability to\nabsorb, adapt to, and recover from adversarial or challenging conditions,\ncriticality indicates the degree of importance or urgency assigned to a\nparticular service or component. Despite a spiking interest in designing\nresilient wireless networks, most prior works do not provide a unified\nresilience definition, nor harness the intricate interplay between resilience\nand criticality. In order to fill this gap, in this paper, we highlight the\nimportance of a criticality-aware approach as a key enabler for providing\nreliable and resilient service functionality. Moreover, we delve into the\nunique challenges and opportunities of the envisioned 6G features pertaining to\nresilience and (mixed) criticality. After reviewing resilience definitions, we\npresent a core resilience strategy, a unified resilience metric, different\ncriteria for service criticality, and prioritization frameworks, that augment\nthe 6G resilience prospects. Afterwards, we explore the opportunities presented\nby promising technologies that enable a resilient 6G network design from a\nradio access network protocol stack perspective. We briefly revisit\nstate-of-the-art network architectures, establish a rough connection to the\nOpen-RAN Alliance vision, and discuss opportunities, existing techniques, and\npromising enabling mechanisms for 6G at each layer. Finally, the article\ndiscusses important research directions and open problems concerning resilience\nand criticality in 6G.",

Simulations can efficiently exploit the near-axisymmetry of these\nsystems by reducing the number of points in the angular direction around the\nnear-symmetry axis, enabling efficient simulations over seconds-long timescales\nwith minimal computational expense. In this paper, we introduce GRoovy, a novel\ncode capable of modeling astrophysical systems containing compact objects by\nsolving the equations of general relativistic hydrodynamics (GRHD) in full\ngeneral relativity using singular curvilinear (spherical-like and\ncylindrical-like) and Cartesian coordinates. We demonstrate the code's\nrobustness through a battery of challenging GRHD tests, ranging from flat,\nstatic spacetimes to curved, dynamical spacetimes. These tests further showcase\nthe code's capabilities in modeling systems with realistic, finite-temperature\nequations of state and neutrino cooling via a leakage scheme. GRoovy\nextensively leverages GRHayL, an open-source, modular, and\ninfrastructure-agnostic general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics library built\nfrom the highly robust algorithms of IllinoisGRMHD.

In this scenario, UV/optical variability is suppressed due to photon\ntrapping within super-Eddington disks, while X-ray emissions remain weak yet\nexhibit significant relative variability. These characteristics are\nparticularly evident in high-redshift AGNs powered by lower-mass BHs with\n$\\lesssim 10^{7-8}~M_\\odot$, which undergo rapid mass accretion following\novermassive evolutionary tracks relative to the BH-to-stellar mass correlation\nin the local universe.",

Our analysis identifies special drive frequencies at which the\ndriven XY chain exhibits dynamic symmetry restoration and displays quantum\nMpemba effect over a long timescale; we identify an emergent approximate\nsymmetry in its Floquet Hamiltonian which plays a crucial role for realization\nof both these phenomena.

Such a driven CFT, depending on the drive\namplitude and frequency, exhibits two distinct phases, heating and non-heating,\nthat are separated by a critical line.

Using a Bayesian framework, we\nre-derive constraints on axions using the inferred spins of solar mass black\nholes, demonstrating that previously adopted limit-setting procedures have\nunderestimated current sensitivity to the axion decay constant $f_a$ by around\none order of magnitude, and that the inclusion to higher order states allows\none to reasonably capture the evolution of typical high-spin black holes across\na much wider range of parameter space, thereby allowing constraints to be\nextended to more massive axions.

We 'euclidized' the HST galaxy images by creating composite RGB\nimages, using the F160W (H-band), F125W (J-band), and F814W + F606W (I-band +\nV-band) HST filters, respectively. Using these processed images as input for\nSAM, we retrieved various truncation masks for each galaxy image under\ndifferent configurations of the input data. We find excellent agreement between\nthe galaxy sizes identified by SAM and those measured manually (i.e., by using\nthe radial positions of the stellar disk edges in galaxy light profiles), with\nan average deviation of approximately $3\\%$.

Unlike most previous methods that require\ncase- or style-specific training, Style3D supports instant 3D object\nstylization. Our key insight is that 3D object stylization can be decomposed\ninto two interconnected processes: multi-view dual-feature alignment and\nsparse-view spatial reconstruction. We introduce MultiFusion Attention, an\nattention-guided technique to achieve multi-view stylization from the\ncontent-style pair. Specifically, the query features from the content image\npreserve geometric consistency across multiple views, while the key and value\nfeatures from the style image are used to guide the stylistic transfer. This\ndual-feature alignment ensures that spatial coherence and stylistic fidelity\nare maintained across multi-view images. Finally, a large 3D reconstruction\nmodel is introduced to generate coherent stylized 3D objects. By establishing\nan interplay between structural and stylistic features across multiple views,\nour approach enables a holistic 3D stylization process. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that Style3D offers a more flexible and scalable solution for\ngenerating style-consistent 3D assets, surpassing existing methods in both\ncomputational efficiency and visual quality.",

    "abstract": "Inferring the 3D structure underlying a set of multi-view images typically\nrequires solving two co-dependent tasks -- accurate 3D reconstruction requires\nprecise camera poses, and predicting camera poses relies on (implicitly or\nexplicitly) modeling the underlying 3D. The classical framework of analysis by\nsynthesis casts this inference as a joint optimization seeking to explain the\nobserved pixels, and recent instantiations learn expressive 3D representations\n(e.g., Neural Fields) with gradient-descent-based pose refinement of initial\npose estimates. However, given a sparse set of observed views, the observations\nmay not provide sufficient direct evidence to obtain complete and accurate 3D.\nMoreover, large errors in pose estimation may not be easily corrected and can\nfurther degrade the inferred 3D. To allow robust 3D reconstruction and pose\nestimation in this challenging setup, we propose SparseAGS, a method that\nadapts this analysis-by-synthesis approach by: a) including\nnovel-view-synthesis-based generative priors in conjunction with photometric\nobjectives to improve the quality of the inferred 3D, and b) explicitly\nreasoning about outliers and using a discrete search with a continuous\noptimization-based strategy to correct them. We validate our framework across\nreal-world and synthetic datasets in combination with several off-the-shelf\npose estimation systems as initialization. We find that it significantly\nimproves the base systems' pose accuracy while yielding high-quality 3D\nreconstructions that outperform the results from current multi-view\nreconstruction baselines.",

Unfortunately, typically using this method requires\nsolving a semidefinite program, which can be computationally expensive.\nFurther, the typically used degree-$4$ sum-of-squares (also known as the 2RDM\nmethod) does not correctly reproduce second order perturbation theory. Here, we\ngive a general method, an analogue of Wigner's $2n+1$ rule for perturbation\ntheory, to compute the order of the error in a given sum-of-squares ansatz. We\nalso give a method for finding solutions of the dual semidefinite program,\nbased on a perturbative ansatz combined with a self-consistent method. As an\nillustration, we show that for a class of model Hamiltonians (with a gap in the\nquadratic term and quartic terms chosen as i.i.d. Gaussians), this\nself-consistent sum-of-squares method significantly improves over the 2RDM\nmethod in both speed and accuracy, and also improves over low order\nperturbation theory.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces MIDI, a novel paradigm for compositional 3D scene\ngeneration from a single image. Unlike existing methods that rely on\nreconstruction or retrieval techniques or recent approaches that employ\nmulti-stage object-by-object generation, MIDI extends pre-trained image-to-3D\nobject generation models to multi-instance diffusion models, enabling the\nsimultaneous generation of multiple 3D instances with accurate spatial\nrelationships and high generalizability. At its core, MIDI incorporates a novel\nmulti-instance attention mechanism, that effectively captures inter-object\ninteractions and spatial coherence directly within the generation process,\nwithout the need for complex multi-step processes. The method utilizes partial\nobject images and global scene context as inputs, directly modeling object\ncompletion during 3D generation. During training, we effectively supervise the\ninteractions between 3D instances using a limited amount of scene-level data,\nwhile incorporating single-object data for regularization, thereby maintaining\nthe pre-trained generalization ability. MIDI demonstrates state-of-the-art\nperformance in image-to-scene generation, validated through evaluations on\nsynthetic data, real-world scene data, and stylized scene images generated by\ntext-to-image diffusion models.",

We model the lifetime\nof each scientific entity as the time-dependent document frequency, which is\nfit by the composition of multiple Gaussian profiles. The lifetime ratio is\nthen calculated as the cumulative document frequency at the publication time\n$t_0$ divided by the cumulative document frequency over its entire lifetime.\nThe informativity is calculated by normalizing the document frequency across\nall scientific entities recognized in a title. Using the ACL Anthology, we\nverified the trend formerly observed in several other domains that the number\nof unique scientific entities per quota increased gradually at a slower rate.\nWe found that FICE exhibits a strong correlation with the average cumulative\ncitation count within a quota.

We find that BoN Jailbreaking achieves high\nattack success rates (ASRs) on closed-source language models, such as 89% on\nGPT-4o and 78% on Claude 3.5 Sonnet when sampling 10,000 augmented prompts.\nFurther, it is similarly effective at circumventing state-of-the-art\nopen-source defenses like circuit breakers. BoN also seamlessly extends to\nother modalities: it jailbreaks vision language models (VLMs) such as GPT-4o\nand audio language models (ALMs) like Gemini 1.5 Pro, using modality-specific\naugmentations. BoN reliably improves when we sample more augmented prompts.\nAcross all modalities, ASR, as a function of the number of samples (N),\nempirically follows power-law-like behavior for many orders of magnitude.

    "abstract": "Compute-in-memory (CiM)-based binary neural network (CiM-BNN) accelerators\nmarry the benefits of CiM and ultra-low precision quantization, making them\nhighly suitable for edge computing. However, CiM-enabled crossbar (Xbar) arrays\nare plagued with hardware non-idealities like parasitic resistances and device\nnon-linearities that impair inference accuracy, especially in scaled\ntechnologies. In this work, we first analyze the impact of Xbar non-idealities\non the inference accuracy of various CiM-BNNs, establishing that the unique\nproperties of CiM-BNNs make them more prone to hardware non-idealities compared\nto higher precision deep neural networks (DNNs). To address this issue, we\npropose BinSparX, a training-free technique that mitigates non-idealities in\nCiM-BNNs. BinSparX utilizes the distinct attributes of BNNs to reduce the\naverage current generated during the CiM operations in Xbar arrays. This is\nachieved by statically and dynamically sparsifying the BNN weights and\nactivations, respectively (which, in the context of BNNs, is defined as\nreducing the number of +1 weights and activations). This minimizes the IR drops\nacross the parasitic resistances, drastically mitigating their impact on\ninference accuracy. To evaluate our technique, we conduct experiments on\nResNet-18 and VGG-small CiM-BNNs designed at the 7nm technology node using\n8T-SRAM and 1T-1ReRAM. Our results show that BinSparX is highly effective in\nalleviating the impact of non-idealities, recouping the inference accuracy to\nnear-ideal (software) levels in some cases and providing accuracy boost of up\nto 77.25%.

An important contribution of Argos is showing that\nthe major security pitfall associated with trusted hardware, microarchitectural\nside channels, can be completely mitigated by excluding any secrets from the\nCPU and the memory hierarchy. This is made possible by focusing on building a\nplatform that only enforces program and data integrity and not confidentiality.\nAll secrets related to the attestation mechanism are kept in a separate\ncoprocessor (e.g., a TPM)-inaccessible to any software-based attacker. Relying\non a discrete TPM typically incurs significant performance overhead, which is\nwhy (insecure) software-based TPMs are used in practice. As a second\ncontribution, we show that for FHE applications, the attestation protocol can\nbe adapted to only incur a fixed cost.\n  Argos requires no dedicated hardware extensions and is supported on commodity\nprocessors from 2008 onward. Our prototype implementation introduces 3%\noverhead for FHE evaluation, and 8% for more complex protocols.

    "abstract": "Recent results from DESI combined with cosmic microwave background data give\nthe tightest constraints on the sum of neutrino masses to date. However, these\nanalyses approximate the neutrino mass hierarchy by three degenerate-mass (DM)\nneutrinos, instead of the normal (NH) and inverted hierarchies (IH) informed by\nterrestrial neutrino oscillation experiments. Given the stringency of the upper\nlimits from DESI data, we test explicitly whether the inferred neutrino\nconstraints are robust to the choice of neutrino mass ordering using both\nBayesian and frequentist methods. For Planck data alone, we find that the DM\nhierarchy presents a good approximation to the physically motivated hierarchies\nwhile showing a strong dependence on the assumed lower bound of the prior,\nconfirming previous studies. For the combined Planck and DESI baryon acoustic\noscillation data, we find that assuming NH ($M_\\mathrm{tot} <\n0.13\\,\\mathrm{eV}$) or IH ($M_\\mathrm{tot} < 0.16\\,\\mathrm{eV}$) loosens the\nBayesian upper limits compared to the DM approximation ($M_\\mathrm{tot} <\n0.086\\,\\mathrm{eV}$). The frequentist analysis shows that the different\nneutrino models fit the data equally well and the loosening of the constraints\ncan thus be attributed to the lower bounds induced by NH and IH. Overall, we\nfind that the DM hierarchy presents a good approximation to the physically\nmotivated hierarchies also for Planck+DESI data as long as the corresponding\nlower neutrino mass bounds are imposed.",

The inelastic spectrum is well-modeled using $J_1, ~J_2,\n~J_3$ nearest-neighbor exchange interactions with weak uniaxial anisotropy.\nThese interactions have higher symmetry than the crystal lattice, while the\ninteractions predicted to produce the altermagnetic splitting are negligibly\nsmall.

We find a 7.2$\\sigma$ detection in the\nmonopole of the signal (i.e., the gas density profile) and a 4$\\sigma$\ndetection in the quadrupole ($m = 2$), constituting the first measurement of\nthe alignment between gas distribution and the cosmic web through the kSZ\neffect. As it is a linear probe of the local gas density, the kSZ has\nheightened sensitivity to the warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM), which is\nbelieved to house the majority of the ``missing baryons.'' Mapping out the gas\ndensity at low redshifts, as enabled by our measurements, is crucial for weak\nlensing surveys, for which the impact of baryons on small scales is a major\nimpediment. We compare the anisotropic signal against two hydrodynamical\nsimulations, TNG300-1 and Illustris, which have very different baryonic\nfeedback prescriptions. We find that the anisotropic signal measured in the\ndata is comparable but slightly larger and more extended compared with the\nsimulations.

Materials and Methods: This study utilizes four LLMs:\nEncoder-based GatorTron-Base (345M)/Large (8.9B); Decoder-based\nLLaMA3-8B/MeLLaMA-13B. We developed full (FFT) and parameter-efficient (PEFT)\nfine-tuning strategies and evaluated these strategies on the 2012 i2b2 CTRE\ntask. We explored four fine-tuning strategies for GatorTron-Base: (1) Standard\nFine-Tuning, (2) Hard-Prompting with Unfrozen LLMs, (3) Soft-Prompting with\nFrozen LLMs, and (4) Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) with Frozen LLMs. For\nGatorTron-Large, we assessed two PEFT strategies-Soft-Prompting and LoRA with\nFrozen LLMs-leveraging Quantization techniques. Additionally, LLaMA3-8B and\nMeLLaMA-13B employed two PEFT strategies: LoRA strategy with Quantization\n(QLoRA) applied to Frozen LLMs using instruction tuning and standard\nfine-tuning. Results: Under fully supervised settings, Hard-Prompting with\nUnfrozen GatorTron-Base achieved the highest F1 score (89.54%), surpassing the\nSOTA model (85.70%) by 3.74%. Additionally, two variants of QLoRA adapted to\nGatorTron-Large and Standard Fine-Tuning of GatorTron-Base exceeded the SOTA\nmodel by 2.36%, 1.88%, and 0.25%, respectively. Decoder-based models with\nfrozen parameters outperformed their Encoder-based counterparts in this\nsetting; however, the trend reversed in few-shot scenarios. Discussions and\nConclusions: This study presented new methods that significantly improved CTRE\nperformance, benefiting downstream tasks reliant on CTRE systems. The findings\nunderscore the importance of selecting appropriate models and fine-tuning\nstrategies based on task requirements and data availability.

    "abstract": "Young and forming planetesimals experience impacts from particles present in\na protostellar disk. Using crater scaling laws, we integrate ejecta\ndistributions for oblique impacts. For impacts at 10 to 65 m/s, expected for\nimpacts associated with a disk wind, we estimate the erosion rate and torque\nexerted on the planetesimal. We find that the mechanism for angular momentum\ndrain proposed by Dobrovolskis and Burns (1984) for asteroids could operate in\nthe low velocity regime of a disk wind. Though spin-down associated with\nimpacts can facilitate planetesimal collapse, we find that the process is\ninefficient. We find that angular momentum drain via impacts operates in the\ngravitational focusing regime. The angular momentum transfer is most effective\nwhen the wind speed is high, the projectile density is high compared to the\nbulk planetesimal density, and the planetesimal is sufficiently weak that\ncratering is in the gravity regime. We find that angular momentum drain due to\nimpacts within a pebble cloud may, in those specific conditions, facilitate\ncollapse of single planetesimals.",

    "abstract": "Energy dissipation in collisionless shocks is a key mechanism in various\nastrophysical environments. Its non-linear nature complicates analytical\nunderstanding and necessitate Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations. This study\nexamines the impact of reducing the ion-to-electron mass ratio ($m_r$), to\ndecrease computational cost, on energy partitioning in 1D3V (one spatial and\nthree velocity-space dimensions) PIC simulations of strong, non-relativistic,\nparallel electron-ion collisionless shocks using the SHARP code. We compare\nsimulations with a reduced mass ratio ($m_r = 100$) to those with a realistic\nmass ratio ($m_r = 1836$) for shocks with high ($\\mathcal{M}_A = 21.3$) and low\n($\\mathcal{M}_A = 5.3$) Alfv$\\acute{\\text{e}}$n Mach numbers. Our findings show\nthat the mass ratio significantly affects particle acceleration and thermal\nenergy dissipation. At high $\\mathcal{M}_A$, a reduced mass ratio leads to more\nefficient electron acceleration and an unrealistically high ion flux at higher\nmomentum. At low $\\mathcal{M}_A$, it causes complete suppression of electron\nacceleration, whereas the realistic mass ratio enables efficient electron\nacceleration. The reduced mass ratio also results in excessive electron heating\nand lower heating in downstream ions at both Mach numbers, with slightly more\nmagnetic field amplification at low $\\mathcal{M}_A$. Consequently, the\nelectron-to-ion temperature ratio is high at low $\\mathcal{M}_A$ due to reduced\nion heating and remains high at high $\\mathcal{M}_A$ due to increased electron\nheating. In contrast, simulations with the realistic $m_r$ show that the\nion-to-electron temperature ratio is independent of the upstream magnetic\nfield, a result not observed in reduced $m_r$ simulations.",

While many methodologies aim to\ndraw causal inferences from observational data, there is a growing trend to\nmodel observational study designs after RCTs, a strategy known as \"target trial\nemulation.\" Despite its potential, causal inference through target trial\nemulation cannot fully address the confounding bias in real-world data due to\nthe lack of randomization. In this work, we present a novel framework for\ntarget trial emulation that aims to overcome several key limitations, including\nconfounding bias. The framework proceeds as follows: First, we apply the\neligibility criteria of a specific trial to an observational cohort. We then\n\"correct\" this cohort by extracting a subset that matches both the distribution\nof covariates and the baseline prognosis of the control group in the target\nRCT. Next, we address unmeasured confounding by adjusting the prognosis\nestimates of the treated group to align with those observed in the trial.\nFollowing trial emulation, we go a step further by leveraging the emulated\ncohort to train optimal decision trees, to identify subgroups of patients with\nheterogeneity in treatment effects (HTE). The absence of confounding is\nverified using two external models, and the validity of the treatment\nrecommendations is independently confirmed by the team responsible for the\noriginal trial we emulate. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to\nsuccessfully address both observed and unobserved confounding, a challenge that\nhas historically limited the use of randomized trial emulation and causal\ninference. Additionally, our framework holds promise in advancing precision\nmedicine by identifying patient subgroups that benefit most from specific\ntreatments.",

The hierarchy of fluxes includes Rusanov schemes, HLL\nschemes, HLLC schemes, and other variations. All of these schemes rely on wave\nspeed estimates. Recent work has shown that most wave speed estimates in\ncurrent use underestimate the true wave speeds. In the present paper we carry\nout a theoretical study of the consequences arising from errors in the wave\nspeed estimates, on the monotonicity and stability properties of the derived\nschemes. For the simplest case of the hierarchy, that is Rusanov-type schemes,\nwe carry out a detailed analysis in terms of the linear advection equation in\none and two space dimensions. It is found that errors from underestimates of\nthe wave speed could cause loss of monotonicity, severe reduction of the\nstability limit, and even loss of stability. Errors from overestimates, though\npreserving monotonicity, will cause a reduction of the stability limit. We find\nthat overestimation is preferable to underestimation, for two reasons. First,\nschemes from overestimation are monotone, and second, their stability regions\nare larger than those from underestimation, for equivalent displacements from\nthe exact speed. The findings of this paper may prove useful in raising\nawareness of the potential pitfalls of a seemingly simple practical\ncomputational task, that of providing wave speed estimates. Our reported\nfindings may also motivate subsequent studies for complex non-linear hyperbolic\nsystems, requiring estimates for two or more waves, such as in HLL and HLLC\nschemes.",

We also propose a lightweight controller tailored for CogDriving,\ni.e., Micro-Controller, which uses only 1.1% of the parameters of the standard\nControlNet, enabling precise control over Bird's-Eye-View layouts. To enhance\nthe generation of object instances crucial for autonomous driving, we propose a\nre-weighted learning objective, dynamically adjusting the learning weights for\nobject instances during training. CogDriving demonstrates strong performance on\nthe nuScenes validation set, achieving an FVD score of 37.8, highlighting its\nability to generate realistic driving videos.

Our\nmethod estimates RS compensated views and dense RS compensated disparity maps.\nWe present a two-stage method based on a 2D Gaussians Splatting that allows for\na ``render and compare\" strategy with a point cloud formulation. In the first\nstage, a subset of sub-aperture images is used to estimate an RS agnostic 3D\nshape that is related to the scene target shape ``up to a motion\".

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in generative models have significantly improved novel\nview synthesis (NVS) from multi-view data. However, existing methods depend on\nexternal multi-view alignment processes, such as explicit pose estimation or\npre-reconstruction, which limits their flexibility and accessibility,\nespecially when alignment is unstable due to insufficient overlap or occlusions\nbetween views. In this paper, we propose NVComposer, a novel approach that\neliminates the need for explicit external alignment. NVComposer enables the\ngenerative model to implicitly infer spatial and geometric relationships\nbetween multiple conditional views by introducing two key components: 1) an\nimage-pose dual-stream diffusion model that simultaneously generates target\nnovel views and condition camera poses, and 2) a geometry-aware feature\nalignment module that distills geometric priors from dense stereo models during\ntraining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NVComposer achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in generative multi-view NVS tasks, removing the\nreliance on external alignment and thus improving model accessibility. Our\napproach shows substantial improvements in synthesis quality as the number of\nunposed input views increases, highlighting its potential for more flexible and\naccessible generative NVS systems.

It plays a key role in the\ndevelopment of educational technology systems and is traditionally rooted in\ndeterministic feedback defined by experts and their experience. However, with\nthe rise of generative AI and especially Large Language Models (LLMs), we\nexpect feedback as part of learning systems to transform, especially for the\ncontext of programming. In the past, it was challenging to automate feedback\nfor learners of programming. LLMs may create new possibilities to provide\nricher, and more individual feedback than ever before.\n  Objectives: This paper aims to generate specific types of feedback for\nintroductory programming tasks using LLMs. We revisit existing feedback\ntaxonomies to capture the specifics of the generated feedback, such as\nrandomness, uncertainty, and degrees of variation.\n  Methods: We iteratively designed prompts for the generation of specific\nfeedback types (as part of existing feedback taxonomies) in response to\nauthentic student programs. We then evaluated the generated output and\ndetermined to what extent it reflected certain feedback types.\n  Results and Conclusion: The present work provides a better understanding of\ndifferent feedback dimensions and characteristics.

However, the slow\nsampling speed limits the practical application of diffusion-based scene\ncompletion models since autonomous vehicles require an efficient perception of\nsurrounding environments. This paper proposes a novel distillation method\ntailored for 3D Li- DAR scene completion models, dubbed ScoreLiDAR, which\nachieves efficient yet high-quality scene completion. Score- LiDAR enables the\ndistilled model to sample in significantly fewer steps after distillation. To\nimprove completion quality, we also introduce a novel Structural Loss, which\nencourages the distilled model to capture the geometric structure of the 3D\nLiDAR scene. The loss contains a scene-wise term constraining the holistic\nstructure and a point-wise term constraining the key landmark points and their\nrelative configuration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ScoreLiDAR\nsignificantly accelerates the completion time from 30.55 to 5.37 seconds per\nframe (>5x) on SemanticKITTI and achieves superior performance compared to\nstate-of-the-art 3D LiDAR scene completion models.

    "abstract": "Many environmental, energy, and industrial processes involve the flow of\npolymer solutions in three-dimensional (3D) porous media where fluid is\nconfined to navigate through complex pore space geometries. As polymers are\ntransported through the tortuous pore space, elastic stresses accumulate,\nleading to the onset of unsteady flow fluctuations above a threshold flow rate.\nHow does pore space geometry influence the development and features of this\nelastic instability? Here, we address this question by directly imaging polymer\nsolution flow in microfabricated 3D ordered porous media with precisely\ncontrolled geometries consisting of simple-cubic (SC) or body-centered cuboid\n(BC) arrays of spherical grains. In both cases, we find that the flow\ninstability is generated at stagnation points arising at the contacts between\ngrains rather than at the polar upstream/downstream grain surfaces, as is the\ncase for flow around a single grain. The characteristics of the flow\ninstability are strongly dependent on the unit cell geometry: in SC packings,\nthe instability manifests through the formation of time-dependent, fluctuating\n3D eddies, whereas in BC packings, it manifests as continual fluctuating\n'wobbles' and crossing in the flow pathlines. Despite this difference, we find\nthat characteristics of the transition from steady to unsteady flow with\nincreasing flow rate have commonalities across geometries. Moreover, for both\npacking geometries, our data indicate that extensional flow-induced polymeric\nstresses generated by contact-associated stagnation points are the primary\ncontributor to the macroscopic resistance to flow across the entire medium.\nAltogether, our work highlights the pivotal role of inter-grain contacts --\nwhich are typically idealized as discrete points and therefore overlooked, but\nare inherent in most natural and engineered media -- in shaping elastic\ninstabilities in porous media.",

Typically, these\ncannot be measured except by fitting the models to the data from the\nexperiment, requiring simultaneous measurement of interesting parameters that\nare our target of inference and nuisance terms that are not directly of\ninterest. A recent example of this is fitting Effective Field Theory (EFT)\nmodels to large-scale structure (LSS) data to make cosmological inferences.\nThese models have a large number of nuisance parameters that are typically\ncorrelated with cosmological parameters in the posterior, leading to strong\ndependence on the nuisance parameter priors. We introduce a reparametrization\nmethod that leverages Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) to decorrelate\nnuisance parameters from the parameters of interest in the likelihood, even in\nthe presence of non-linear relationships. This reparametrization forms a\nnatural basis within which to define priors that are independent between\nnuisance and target parameters: the separation means that the marginal\nposterior for cosmological parameters does not depend on simple priors placed\non nuisance terms. In application to EFT models using LSS data, we demonstrate\nthat the proposed approach leads to robust cosmological inference.",

This is a test of fundamental importance for self-organized\ncriticality (SOC) systems.

Our statistical test, carried out with 61\npublished data sets, yields strong support for the former option, which implies\nthat observed power laws can simply be derived from the scale-freeness and do\nnot require specific physical models to understand their statistical\ndistributions.

A central challenge lies in understanding how\ncontrollable parameters induce qualitative changes in system behavior called\nbifurcations. This endeavor is particularly difficult in realistic settings\nwhere governing partial differential equations (PDEs) are unknown and data is\nlimited and noisy. To address this challenge, we propose TRENDy (Temporal\nRegression of Effective Nonlinear Dynamics), an equation-free approach to\nlearning low-dimensional, predictive models of spatiotemporal dynamics. TRENDy\nfirst maps input data to a low-dimensional space of effective dynamics through\na cascade of multiscale filtering operations. Our key insight is the\nrecognition that these effective dynamics can be fit by a neural ordinary\ndifferential equation (NODE) having the same parameter space as the input PDE.\nThe preceding filtering operations strongly regularize the phase space of the\nNODE, making TRENDy significantly more robust to noise compared to existing\nmethods. We train TRENDy to predict the effective dynamics of synthetic and\nreal data representing dynamics from across the physical and life sciences. We\nthen demonstrate how we can automatically locate both Turing and Hopf\nbifurcations in unseen regions of parameter space. We finally apply our method\nto the analysis of spatial patterning of the ocellated lizard through\ndevelopment. We found that TRENDy's predicted effective state not only\naccurately predicts spatial changes over time but also identifies distinct\npattern features unique to different anatomical regions, such as the tail,\nneck, and body--an insight that highlights the potential influence of surface\ngeometry on reaction-diffusion mechanisms and their role in driving spatially\nvarying pattern dynamics.",

We present a new\napproach for calculating the equipartition magnetic field strength based on\nBayesian methods. In this approach, the magnetic field is a random variable\nthat is distributed according to a posterior distribution conditional on\nsynchrotron emission and the size of the emitting region. It allows the direct\napplication of the general formulas for total and polarized synchrotron\nradiation without the need to invert these formulas, which has limited the\nequipartition method to highly simplified cases. We have derived the\nequipartition condition for the case of different low-energy breaks, slopes,\nand high-energy cutoffs of power law spectra of the CR proton and electron\ndistributions. The derived formalism was applied in the general case of a\nmagnetic field consisting of both uniform and randomly oriented field\ncomponents.

    "abstract": "Adequately generating and evaluating prediction models based on supervised\nmachine learning (ML) is often challenging, especially for less experienced\nusers in applied research areas. Special attention is required in settings\nwhere the model generation process involves hyperparameter tuning, i.e.\ndata-driven optimization of different types of hyperparameters to improve the\npredictive performance of the resulting model. Discussions about tuning\ntypically focus on the hyperparameters of the ML algorithm (e.g., the minimum\nnumber of observations in each terminal node for a tree-based algorithm). In\nthis context, it is often neglected that hyperparameters also exist for the\npreprocessing steps that are applied to the data before it is provided to the\nalgorithm (e.g., how to handle missing feature values in the data). As a\nconsequence, users experimenting with different preprocessing options to\nimprove model performance may be unaware that this constitutes a form of\nhyperparameter tuning, albeit informal and unsystematic, and thus may fail to\nreport or account for this optimization. To illuminate this issue, this paper\nreviews and empirically illustrates different procedures for generating and\nevaluating prediction models, explicitly addressing the different ways\nalgorithm and preprocessing hyperparameters are typically handled by applied ML\nusers. By highlighting potential pitfalls, especially those that may lead to\nexaggerated performance claims, this review aims to further improve the quality\nof predictive modeling in ML applications.",

A comprehensive analysis is conducted\nto obtain the optimized device parameters while simultaneously allowing\nflexible placement of implants at different depths and alignments. To\nsubstantiate the proposed design concept, a prototype was simulated in Ansys\nHFSS, employing a multi-layered tissue medium of 10mm radius and targeting the\nsciatic nerve of a rat.

    "abstract": "Contrastive representation learning is a modern paradigm for learning\nrepresentations of unlabeled data via augmentations -- precisely, contrastive\nmodels learn to embed semantically similar pairs of samples (positive pairs)\ncloser than independently drawn samples (negative samples). In spite of its\nempirical success and widespread use in foundation models, statistical theory\nfor contrastive learning remains less explored. Recent works have developed\ngeneralization error bounds for contrastive losses, but the resulting risk\ncertificates are either vacuous (certificates based on Rademacher complexity or\n$f$-divergence) or require strong assumptions about samples that are\nunreasonable in practice. The present paper develops non-vacuous PAC-Bayesian\nrisk certificates for contrastive representation learning, considering the\npractical considerations of the popular SimCLR framework. Notably, we take into\naccount that SimCLR reuses positive pairs of augmented data as negative samples\nfor other data, thereby inducing strong dependence and making classical PAC or\nPAC-Bayesian bounds inapplicable. We further refine existing bounds on the\ndownstream classification loss by incorporating SimCLR-specific factors,\nincluding data augmentation and temperature scaling, and derive risk\ncertificates for the contrastive zero-one risk. The resulting bounds for\ncontrastive loss and downstream prediction are much tighter than those of\nprevious risk certificates, as demonstrated by experiments on CIFAR-10.",

A key component of semi-numerical models of reionization is\nthe collapse fraction field $f_{\\text{coll}}(\\mathbf{x})$, which represents the\nfraction of mass within dark matter halos at each location. Using high-dynamic\nrange N-body simulations to obtain this is computationally prohibitive and\nsemi-analytical approaches, while being fast, end up compromising on accuracy.\nIn this work, we bridge the gap by developing a machine learning model that can\ngenerate $f_{\\text{coll}}$ maps by sampling from the full distribution of\n$f_{\\text{coll}}$ conditioned on the dark matter density contrast $\\delta$. The\nconditional distribution functions and the input density field to the model are\ntaken from low-dynamic range N-body simulations that are more efficient to run.\nWe evaluate the performance of our ML model by comparing its predictions to a\nhigh-dynamic range N-body simulation. Using these $f_{\\text{coll}}$ maps, we\ncompute the HI and HII maps through a semi-numerical code for reionization. We\nare able to recover the large-scale HI density field power spectra $(k \\lesssim\n1\\ h\\,{\\rm Mpc}^{-1})$ at the $\\lesssim10\\%$ level, while the HII density field\nis reproduced with errors well below 10% across all scales.

After obtaining the\nrepresentation vector via the CNN layers, a sparsely gated MoE layer is used.\nThis layer consists of a set of experts (dense layers) and a router, where the\nrouter assigns weights to the output of each expert.

    "abstract": "Given the fact that climate change has become one of the most pressing\nproblems in many countries in recent years, specialized research on how to\nmitigate climate change has been adopted by many countries. Within this\ndiscussion, the influence of advanced technologies in achieving carbon\nneutrality has been discussed. While several studies investigated how AI and\nDigital innovations could be used to reduce the environmental footprint, the\nactual influence of AI in reducing CO2 emissions (a proxy measuring carbon\nfootprint) has yet to be investigated. This paper studies the role of advanced\ntechnologies in general, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) and ICT use in\nparticular, in advancing carbon neutrality in the United States, between 2021.\nSecondly, this paper examines how Stock Market Growth, ICT use, Gross Domestic\nProduct (GDP), and Population affect CO2 emissions using the STIRPAT model.\nAfter examining stationarity among the variables using a variety of unit root\ntests, this study concluded that there are no unit root problems across all the\nvariables, with a mixed order of integration. The ARDL bounds test for\ncointegration revealed that variables in this study have a long-run\nrelationship. Moreover, the estimates revealed from the ARDL model in the\nshort- and long-run indicated that economic growth, stock market\ncapitalization, and population significantly contributed to the carbon\nemissions in both the short-run and long-run. Conversely, AI and ICT use\nsignificantly reduced carbon emissions over both periods. Furthermore, findings\nwere confirmed to be robust using FMOLS, DOLS, and CCR estimations.\nFurthermore, diagnostic tests indicated the absence of serial correlation,\nheteroscedasticity, and specification errors and, thus, the model was robust.",

    "abstract": "The Material Point Method (MPM) has become a cornerstone of physics-based\nsimulation, widely used in geomechanics and computer graphics for modeling\nphenomena such as granular flows, viscoelasticity, fracture mechanics, etc.\nDespite its versatility, the original MPM suffers from cell-crossing\ninstabilities caused by discontinuities in particle-grid transfer kernels.\nExisting solutions mostly mitigate these issues by adopting smoother shape\nfunctions, but at the cost of increased numerical diffusion and computational\noverhead due to larger kernel support. In this paper, we propose a novel\nC^2-continuous compact kernel for MPM that achieves a unique balance in terms\nof stability, accuracy, and computational efficiency. Our method integrates\nseamlessly with Affine Particle-In-Cell (APIC) and Moving Least Squares (MLS)\nMPM, while only doubling the number of grid nodes associated with each particle\ncompared to linear kernels. At its core is an innovative dual-grid framework,\nwhich associates particles with grid nodes exclusively within the cells they\noccupy on two staggered grids, ensuring consistent and stable force\ncomputations. We demonstrate that our method can be conveniently implemented\nusing a domain-specific language, Taichi, or based on open-source GPU MPM\nframeworks, achieving faster runtime and less numerical diffusion compared to\nquadratic B-spline MPM. Comprehensive validation through unit tests,\ncomparative studies, and stress tests demonstrates the efficacy of our approach\nin conserving both linear and angular momentum, handling stiff materials, and\nscaling efficiently for large-scale simulations. Our results highlight the\ntransformative potential of compact, high-order kernels in advancing MPM's\ncapabilities for stable, accurate, and high-performance simulations.",

Some methods leverage 4D\nGaussian Splatting (4DGS) to represent the entire scene, but they treat static\nand dynamic objects uniformly, leading to unnecessary updates for static\nelements and ultimately degrading reconstruction quality. To address these\nissues, we propose UrbanGS, which leverages 2D semantic maps and an existing\ndynamic Gaussian approach to distinguish static objects from the scene,\nenabling separate processing of definite static and potentially dynamic\nelements. Specifically, for definite static regions, we enforce global\nconsistency to prevent unintended changes in dynamic Gaussian and introduce a\nK-nearest neighbor (KNN)-based regularization to improve local coherence on\nlow-textured ground surfaces. Notably, for potentially dynamic objects, we\naggregate temporal information using learnable time embeddings, allowing each\nGaussian to model deformations over time. Extensive experiments on real-world\ndatasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in\nreconstruction quality and efficiency, accurately preserving static content\nwhile capturing dynamic elements.",

Despite its widespread\napplication, there is no established definition of a ``good'' representation.\nTypically, the representation quality is evaluated based on its performance in\ndownstream tasks such as clustering, de-noising, etc. However, this\ntask-specific approach has a limitation where a representation that performs\nwell for one task may not necessarily be effective for another. This highlights\nthe need for a more agnostic formulation, which is the focus of our work. We\npropose a downstream-agnostic formulation: when inherent clusters exist in the\ndata, the representations should be specific to each cluster. Under this idea,\nwe develop a meta-algorithm that jointly learns cluster-specific\nrepresentations and cluster assignments. As our approach is easy to integrate\nwith any representation learning framework, we demonstrate its effectiveness in\nvarious setups, including Autoencoders, Variational Autoencoders, Contrastive\nlearning models, and Restricted Boltzmann Machines. We qualitatively compare\nour cluster-specific embeddings to standard embeddings and downstream tasks\nsuch as de-noising and clustering.

However, the explicit analytical expression for the\nmaximal value of the CHSH expectation under local Alice and Bob spin-$s$\nmeasurements is still known only for $s=1/2$. In the present article, for an\narbitrary state of two spin-$s$ qudits, each of dimension $d=2s+1\\geq 2$, we\nintroduce the notion of the spin-$s$ correlation matrix, which has dimension\n$3\\times 3$ for all $s\\geq \\frac{1}{2}$; establish its relation to the general\ncorrelation $(d^{2}-1)\\times (d^{2}-1)$ matrix of this state within the\ngeneralized Pauli representation and derive in terms of the spin-$s$\ncorrelation matrix the explicit analytical expression for the maximal value of\nthe CHSH expectation under local Alice and Bob spin-$s$ measurements in this\nstate. Specifying this general expression for the two-qudit GHZ state, the\nnonlocal two-qudit Werner state, and some nonseparable pure two-qudit states,\nwe find that, under local Alice and Bob high-spin ($s\\geq1$) measurements in\neach of these nonseparable states, including the maximally entangled one, the\nCHSH inequality is not violated. Moreover, unlike the case of spin-$1/2$\nmeasurements, where each pure nonseparable two-qubit state violates the CHSH\ninequality and the maximal value of its CHSH expectation increases\nmonotonically with a growth of its entanglement, the situation under high-spin\nmeasurements is quite different -- for a pure two-qudit state with a higher\ndegree of entanglement, the maximal value of the CHSH expectation turns out to\nbe less than for a pure two-qudit state with lower entanglement and even for a\nseparable one.",

    "abstract": "As bipedal robots become more and more popular in commercial and industrial\nsettings, the ability to control them with a high degree of reliability is\ncritical. To that end, this paper considers how to accurately estimate which\nfeet are currently in contact with the ground so as to avoid improper control\nactions that could jeopardize the stability of the robot. Additionally, modern\nalgorithms for estimating the position and orientation of a robot's base frame\nrely heavily on such contact mode estimates. Dedicated contact sensors on the\nfeet can be used to estimate this contact mode, but these sensors are prone to\nnoise, time delays, damage/yielding from repeated impacts with the ground, and\nare not available on every robot. To overcome these limitations, we propose a\nmomentum observer based method for contact mode estimation that does not rely\non such contact sensors. Often, momentum observers assume that the robot's base\nframe can be treated as an inertial frame. However, since many humanoids' legs\nrepresent a significant portion of the overall mass, the proposed method\ninstead utilizes multiple simultaneous dynamic models. Each of these models\nassumes a different contact condition. A given contact assumption is then used\nto constrain the full dynamics in order to avoid assuming that either the body\nis an inertial frame or that a fully accurate estimate of body velocity is\nknown. The (dis)agreement between each model's estimates and measurements is\nused to determine which contact mode is most likely using a Markov-style fusion\nmethod. The proposed method produces contact detection accuracy of up to 98.44%\nwith a low noise simulation and 77.12% when utilizing data collect on the\nSarcos Guardian XO robot (a hybrid humanoid/exoskeleton).",

    "abstract": "The origin of black hole (BH) spins remains one of the least understood\naspects of BHs. Despite many uncertainties, it is commonly assumed that if BHs\noriginated from isolated massive star binaries, their spins should be aligned\nwith the orbital angular momentum of the binary system. This assumption stems\nfrom the notion that BHs inherit their spins from their progenitor stars. In\nthis study, we relax this long-held viewpoint and explore various mechanisms\nthat can spin up BHs before or during their formation. In addition to natal\nspins, we discuss physical processes that can spin BHs isotropically, parallel\nto natal kicks, and perpendicular to natal kicks. These different mechanisms\nleave behind distinct imprints on the observable distributions of spin\nmagnitudes, spin-orbit misalignments and the effective inspiral spin of merging\nbinaries. In particular, these mechanisms allow even the binaries originating\nin the field to exhibit precession and retrograde spin ($\\chi_{\\rm eff}<0$).\nThis broadens the parameter space allowed for isolated binary evolution into\nregimes which were previously thought to be exclusive to dynamically assembled\nbinaries.",

We propose a pipeline to efficiently sample rare behaviors from\nlarge datasets, enabling the creation of training datasets for rare behavior\nclassifiers. Our method only needs an unlabeled animal pose or acceleration\ndataset as input and makes no assumptions regarding the type, number, or\ncharacteristics of the rare behaviors.\n  Our pipeline is based on a recent graph-based anomaly detection model for\nhuman behavior, which we apply to this new data domain. It leverages anomaly\nscores to automatically label normal samples while directing human annotation\nefforts toward anomalies. In research data, anomalies may come from many\ndifferent sources (e.g., signal noise versus true rare instances). Hence, the\nentire labeling budget is focused on the abnormal classes, letting the user\nreview and label samples according to their needs.\n  We tested our approach on three datasets of freely-moving animals, acquired\nin the laboratory and the field. We found that graph-based models are\nparticularly useful when studying motion-based behaviors in animals, yielding\ngood results while using a small labeling budget. Our method consistently\noutperformed traditional random sampling, offering an average improvement of\n70% in performance and creating datasets even when the behavior of interest was\nonly 0.02% of the data.

Furthermore, the\nessential merits of plane-based representation plus CUDA-based implementation\nof planar splatting functions, PlanarSplatting reconstructs an indoor scene in\n3 minutes while having significantly better geometric accuracy.

    "abstract": "Earlier we showed that in the molecular dynamics simulation of a rigid model\nof water it is necessary to use an integration time-step $\\delta t \\leq 0.5$ fs\nto ensure equipartition between translational and rotational modes. Here we\nextend that study in the $NVT$ ensemble to $NpT$ conditions and to an aqueous\nprotein. We study neat liquid water with the rigid, SPC/E model and the protein\nBBA (PDB ID: 1FME) solvated in the rigid, TIP3P model. We examine integration\ntime-steps ranging from $0.5$ fs to $4.0$ fs for various thermostat plus\nbarostat combinations. We find that a small $\\delta t$ is necessary to ensure\nconsistent prediction of the simulation volume. Hydrogen mass repartitioning\nalleviates the problem somewhat, but is ineffective for the typical time-step\nused with this approach. The compressibility, a measure of volume fluctuations,\nand the dielectric constant, a measure of dipole moment fluctuations, are also\nseen to be sensitive to $\\delta t$. Using the mean volume estimated from the\n$NpT$ simulation, we examine the electrostatic and van der Waals contribution\nto the hydration free energy of the protein in the $NVT$ ensemble. These\ncontributions are also sensitive to $\\delta t$. In going from $\\delta t = 2$ fs\nto $\\delta t = 0.5$ fs, the change in the net electrostatic plus van der Waals\ncontribution to the hydration of BBA is already in excess of the folding free\nenergy reported for this protein.",

In this article, we provide a discrete matrix\nanalysis of this mathematical framework which parallels the continuum theory.\nWe show that discretizations of the operators yield real-symmetric random\nmatrices which are composed of projection matrices. We derive discrete\nresolvent representations for $\\boldsymbol{E}$ and $\\boldsymbol{J}$ involving\nthe matrices which lead to eigenvector expansions of $\\boldsymbol{E}$ and\n$\\boldsymbol{J}$.

Concretely, our contributions are threefold: (i) we\nintroduce MRGen-DB, a large-scale radiology image-text dataset comprising\nextensive samples with rich metadata, including modality labels, attributes,\nregions, and organs information, with a subset featuring pixel-wise mask\nannotations; (ii) we present MRGen, a diffusion-based data engine for\ncontrollable medical image synthesis, conditioned on text prompts and\nsegmentation masks.

For instance, adversaries could inject\nmalicious samples into public malware repositories, contaminating the training\ndata and potentially misclassifying malware by the ML model. Current\ncountermeasures predominantly focus on detecting poisoned samples by leveraging\ndisagreements within the outputs of a diverse set of ensemble models on\ntraining data points. However, these methods are not suitable for scenarios\nwhere Machine Learning-as-a-Service (MLaaS) is used or when users aim to remove\nbackdoors from a model after it has been trained. Addressing this scenario, we\nintroduce PBP, a post-training defense for malware classifiers that mitigates\nvarious types of backdoor embeddings without assuming any specific backdoor\nembedding mechanism. Our method exploits the influence of backdoor attacks on\nthe activation distribution of neural networks, independent of the\ntrigger-embedding method. In the presence of a backdoor attack, the activation\ndistribution of each layer is distorted into a mixture of distributions. By\nregulating the statistics of the batch normalization layers, we can guide a\nbackdoored model to perform similarly to a clean one. Our method demonstrates\nsubstantial advantages over several state-of-the-art methods, as evidenced by\nexperiments on two datasets, two types of backdoor methods, and various attack\nconfigurations. Notably, our approach requires only a small portion of the\ntraining data -- only 1\\% -- to purify the backdoor and reduce the attack\nsuccess rate from 100\\% to almost 0\\%, a 100-fold improvement over the baseline\nmethods.

    "abstract": "This study investigates the influence of initial conditions on the evolution\nand properties of linear quasi-normal modes (QNMs). Using a toy model in which\nthe quasi-normal mode can be unambiguously identified, we highlight an aspect\nof QNMs that is long known yet often ignored: the amplitude of a QNM (after\nfactoring out the corresponding exponential with a complex frequency) is not\nconstant but instead varies with time. We stress that this is true even within\nthe regime of validity of linear perturbation theory. The precise time\nvariation depends on the initial conditions. In particular, it is possible to\nfind initial conditions for which the QNM fails to materialize; it is also\npossible to find those for which the QNM amplitude grows indefinitely. Focusing\non cases where the QNM amplitude does stabilize at late times, we explore how\nthe timescale for amplitude stabilization depends on the shape and location of\nthe initial perturbation profile. Our findings underscore the need for care in\nfitting linear QNMs to ringdown data. They also suggest recent computations of\nquadratic QNMs, sourced purely by {\\it stabilized} linear QNMs, do not fully\ncapture what determines the amplitude of the quadratic QNMs, even at late\ntimes. Our results motivate a detailed investigation of the initial\nperturbations generated in the aftermath of a binary merger.",

This work introduces a systematic\npipeline for rapidly and efficiently evaluating foundation models' transfer\ncapabilities in medical contexts.

Finally, the pipeline validates these representations through\nspecific downstream medical tasks. Initial testing of our pipeline on the\nMoirai time series foundation model revealed significant limitations in\nphysiological signal processing, including feature entanglement, temporal\ndynamics distortion, and reduced scenario discrimination.

Solutions to hyperbolic conservation\nlaws typically have an invariant domain, and ensuring numerical solutions stay\nwithin this domain is essential yet nontrivial. This paper presents a novel\nframework for designing efficient Invariant-Domain-Preserving (IDP) PAMPA\nschemes. We first analyze the IDP property for updated cell averages in the\noriginal PAMPA scheme, revealing the role of cell average decomposition and\nmidpoint values in maintaining the invariant domain. This analysis highlights\nthe difficulty of relying on continuous fluxes alone to preserve the invariant\ndomain. Building on these insights, we introduce a simple IDP limiter for cell\nmidpoint values, and propose a provably IDP PAMPA scheme that guarantees the\npreservation of the invariant domain for updated cell averages without\nrequiring post-processing limiters. This approach contrasts with existing\nbound-preserving PAMPA schemes, which often require additional convex limiting\nto blend high-order and low-order solutions. Most notably, inspired by the\nSoftplus and Clipped ReLU functions from machine learning, we propose an\nautomatic IDP reformulation of the governing equations, resulting in an\nunconditionally limiter-free IDP scheme for evolving point values. We also\nintroduce techniques to suppress spurious oscillations, enabling the scheme to\ncapture strong shocks effectively.

    "abstract": "The rising popularity of the microservice architectural style has led to a\ngrowing demand for automated testing approaches tailored to these systems.\nEvoMaster is a state-of-the-art tool that uses Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) to\nautomatically generate test cases for microservices' REST APIs. One limitation\nof these EAs is the use of unit-level search heuristics, such as branch\ndistances, which focus on fine-grained code coverage and may not effectively\ncapture the complex, interconnected behaviors characteristic of system-level\ntesting. To address this limitation, we propose a new search heuristic (MISH)\nthat uses real-time automaton learning to guide the test case generation\nprocess. We capture the sequential call patterns exhibited by a test case by\nlearning an automaton from the stream of log events outputted by different\nmicroservices within the same system. Therefore, MISH learns a representation\nof the systemwide behavior, allowing us to define the fitness of a test case\nbased on the path it traverses within the inferred automaton. We empirically\nevaluate MISH's effectiveness on six real-world benchmark microservice\napplications and compare it against a state-of-the-art technique, MOSA, for\ntesting REST APIs. Our evaluation shows promising results for using MISH to\nguide the automated test case generation within EvoMaster.",

Our findings suggest that the average mass of M-dwarf Jupiters is lower\nthan that of their solar-type counterparts, primarily due to the scarcity of\nsuper-Jupiters ( $\\gtrsim$ 2 $M_J$) around M-dwarfs. However, when\nsuper-Jupiters are excluded from the analysis, we observe a striking similarity\nin the average masses of M-dwarf and FGK warm-Jupiters.

This simplistic explanation suggests that the\ndisk mass has more of an influence on giant planet formation than other factors\nsuch as the host star mass, formation location, metallicity, radiation\nenvironment, etc., and also accounts for the lower occurrence of giant planets\naround M-dwarf stars. Additionally, we explore the possibility of an abrupt\ntransition in the ratio of super-Jupiters to Jupiters around F-type stars at\nthe Kraft break, which could be a product of $v$sin$i$ related detection\nbiases, but requires additional data from an unbiased sample with published\nnon-detections to confirm.

However, optimizing these systems often requires\nsubstantial manual labor. Recent studies have demonstrated that these systems\ncan be represented as computational graphs, enabling automatic optimization.\nDespite these advancements, most current efforts in Graph-based Agentic System\nOptimization (GASO) fail to properly assign feedback to the system's components\ngiven feedback on the system's output. To address this challenge, we formalize\nthe concept of semantic backpropagation with semantic gradients -- a\ngeneralization that aligns several key optimization techniques, including\nreverse-mode automatic differentiation and the more recent TextGrad by\nexploiting the relationship among nodes with a common successor. This serves as\na method for computing directional information about how changes to each\ncomponent of an agentic system might improve the system's output.

Our results on both BIG-Bench Hard and GSM8K show\nthat our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods for solving\nGASO problems.

    "abstract": "Implicit assumptions and priors are often necessary in text-to-image\ngeneration tasks, especially when textual prompts lack sufficient context.\nHowever, these assumptions can sometimes reflect outdated concepts,\ninaccuracies, or societal bias embedded in the training data. We present\nEmbedding-only Editing (Embedit), a method designed to efficiently adjust\nimplict assumptions and priors in the model without affecting its\ninterpretation of unrelated objects or overall performance. Given a \"source\"\nprompt (e.g., \"rose\") that elicits an implicit assumption (e.g., rose is red)\nand a \"destination\" prompt that specifies the desired attribute (e.g., \"blue\nrose\"), Embedit fine-tunes only the word token embedding (WTE) of the target\nobject (\"rose\") to optimize the last hidden state of text encoder in Stable\nDiffusion, a SOTA text-to-image model. This targeted adjustment prevents\nunintended effects on other objects in the model's knowledge base, as the WTEs\nfor unrelated objects and the model weights remain unchanged. Consequently,\nwhen a prompt does not contain the edited object, all representations, and the\nmodel outputs are identical to those of the original, unedited model. Our\nmethod is highly efficient, modifying only 768 parameters for Stable Diffusion\n1.4 and 2048 for XL in a single edit, matching the WTE dimension of each\nrespective model. This minimal scope, combined with rapid execution, makes\nEmbedit highly practical for real-world applications. Additionally, changes are\neasily reversible by restoring the original WTE layers. Our experimental\nresults demonstrate that Embedit consistently outperforms previous methods\nacross various models, tasks, and editing scenarios (both single and sequential\nmultiple edits), achieving at least a 6.01% improvement (from 87.17% to\n93.18%).",

In this work we present a theoretical\ninvestigation of the sliding dynamics of this new type of electron crystal,\ntaking into account the system's nontrivial quantum geometry. We find that when\naccelerated by an external electric field, the crystal acquires a transverse\nanomalous velocity that stems from not only the Berry curvature of the parent\nband but also the Galilean non-invariance of the crystal state (i.e., crystal\nstates with different momenta are not related by simple momentum boosts). We\nfurther show that acceleration of the crystal modifies its internal current\nfrom the static crystal value that is determined by the Chern number of the\ncrystal state. The net Hall conductance including contributions from\ncenter-of-mass motion and internal current is in general not quantized.

In particular,\nthey are $C^2$-inextendible towards the past where causal geodesics become\nincomplete. Moreover, we show that geometry and matter are asymptotically\nvelocity term dominated toward the past, remaining close to their background\ncounterparts. Where the asymptotics do not coincide with those of the isotropic\nbackground solution, the momentum support of the Vlasov distribution approaches\na smooth one-dimensional subbundle of the mass shell. Compared to previous\nresults in higher dimensions, inhomogeneous terms in the wave and Vlasov\nequations factor in more strongly in our setting, which a priori creates\nadditional hurdles to establish stability. As a corollary, our main result\nshows that the Strong Cosmic Censorship conjecture holds for certain polarized\n$U(1)$-symmetric solutions to the Einstein vacuum equations that emanate from a\nspatial hypersurface diffeomorphic to $M\\times\\mathbb{S}^1$.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into mobile services\nover wireless networks to support complex user requests. This trend has led to\nlonger prompts, which improve LLMs' performance but increase data transmission\ncosts and require more processing time, thereby reducing overall system\nefficiency and negatively impacting user experience. To address these\nchallenges, we propose Joint Prompt and Power Optimization (JPPO), a framework\nthat jointly optimizes prompt compression and wireless transmission power for\nmobile LLM services. JPPO leverages a Small Language Model (SLM) deployed at\nedge devices to perform lightweight prompt compression, reducing communication\nload before transmission to the cloud-based LLM. A Deep Reinforcement Learning\n(DRL) agent dynamically adjusts both the compression ratio and transmission\npower based on network conditions and service constraints, aiming to minimize\nservice time while preserving response fidelity. We further extend the\nframework to JPPO++, which introduces a denoising-inspired compression scheme.\nThis design performs iterative prompt refinement by progressively removing less\ninformative tokens, allowing for more aggressive yet controlled compression.\nExperimental results show that JPPO++ reduces service time by 17% compared to\nthe no-compression baseline while maintaining output quality. Under\ncompression-prioritized settings, a reduction of up to 16x in prompt length can\nbe achieved with an acceptable loss in accuracy. Specifically, JPPO with a 16x\nratio reduces total service time by approximately 42.3%, and JPPO++ further\nimproves this reduction to 46.5%.",

Property (i) implies that each variable appears in\nexactly $k$ clauses and each clause consists of exactly 3 unnegated variables.\nTherewith, we improve upon our earlier result (Darmann and D\\\"ocker, 2020).\nComplementing the hardness result for at least $4$ partitions, we show that for\n$k\\leq 3$ the corresponding decision problem is in P. In particular, for $k\\in\n\\{1,2\\}$, all instances that satisfy Property (i) are nae-satisfiable.\n  By the well-known correspondence between Not-All-Equal 3-Sat and hypergraph\ncoloring, we obtain the following corollary of our results: For $k\\geq 4$,\nBicolorability is NP-complete for linear 3-uniform $k$-regular hypergraphs even\nif the edges are given as a decomposition into $k$ perfect matchings; with the\nsame restrictions, for $k \\leq 3$ Bicolorability is in P, and for $k \\in\n\\{1,2\\}$ all such hypergraphs are bicolorable.\n  Finally, we deduce from a construction in the work by Pilz (Pilz, 2019) that\nevery instance of Positive Planar Not-All-Equal Sat with at least three\ndistinct variables per clause is nae-satisfiable.

The natural way out is the introduction of\nstrongly monotone diffeomorphisms and layerwise strongly monotone neural\noperators which have continuous approximations by strongly monotone\ndiffeomorphisms on finite-dimensional spaces.

To\naddress this, we studied a modified MoM estimator proposed by Minsker [PMLR\n195, 5925 (2023)] that uses optimal constants and involves a U-statistic over\nthe data set. For efficient estimation, we implemented two types of incomplete\nU-statistics estimators, the first based on random sampling and the second\nbased on cyclically permuted sampling. We compared the performance of the\noriginal and modified estimators when used with the classical shadows protocol\nwith single-qubit Clifford unitaries (Pauli measurements) for an Ising spin\nchain, and global Clifford unitaries (Clifford measurements) for the\nGreenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state. While the original estimator\noutperformed the modified estimators for Pauli measurements, the modified\nestimators showed improved performance over the original estimator for Clifford\nmeasurements. Our findings highlight the importance of tailoring estimators to\nspecific measurement settings to optimize the performance of the classical\nshadows protocol in practical applications.",

Therefore, long-range interactions are not used in 3D to the extent done\nin 2D and the strength of transformers is not realized. We propose a\nmulti-scale transformer-based model based on hierarchical attention blocks\ncombined with carrier tokens at multiple scales to overcome this. Here\ninformation from larger regions at coarse resolution is sequentially carried on\nto finer-resolution regions to predict the super-resolved image. Using\ntransformer layers at each resolution, our coarse-to-fine modeling limits the\nnumber of tokens at each scale and enables attention over larger regions than\nwhat has previously been possible. We experimentally compare our method,\nMTVNet, against state-of-the-art volumetric super-resolution models on five 3D\ndatasets demonstrating the advantage of an increased receptive field. This\nadvantage is especially pronounced for images that are larger than what is seen\nin popularly used 3D datasets. Our code is available at\nhttps://github.com/AugustHoeg/MTVNet",

Although the cone geometry is flat on\nthe flanks, the concentrated Gaussian curvature at the cone apex geometrically\nfrustrates liquid crystal orientational fields arbitrarily far away. The apex\nacts as an unquantized pseudo-defect interacting with the topological defects\non the flank. By exploiting the conformal mapping methods of F.

We find that additional quantized negative\ndefects are created on the flank as the cone apex becomes sharper via a defect\nunbinding process, such that an equivalent number of quantized positive defects\nbecome trapped at the apex, thus partially screening the apex charge, whose\nmagnitude is a continuous function of cone angle.",

Unlike existing TSVM methods, the proposed GBU-TSVM represents data\ninstances as hyper-balls rather than points in the feature space. This\ninnovative approach improves the model's robustness and efficiency,\nparticularly in handling noisy and large datasets. By grouping data points into\ngranular balls, the model achieves superior computational efficiency, increased\nnoise resistance, and enhanced interpretability. Additionally, the inclusion of\nUniversum data, which consists of samples that are not strictly from the target\nclasses, further refines the classification boundaries. This integration\nenriches the model with contextual information, refining classification\nboundaries and boosting overall accuracy. Experimental results on UCI benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate that the GBU-TSVM outperforms existing TSVM models in both\naccuracy and computational efficiency.

    "abstract": "Physical movement therapy is a crucial method of rehabilitation aimed at\nreinstating mobility among patients facing motor dysfunction due to\nneurological conditions or accidents. Such therapy is usually featured as\npatient-specific, repetitive, and labor-intensive. The conventional method,\nwhere therapists collaborate with patients to conduct repetitive physical\ntraining, proves strenuous due to these characteristics. The concept of\nrobot-assisted rehabilitation, assisting therapists with robotic systems, has\ngained substantial popularity. However, building such systems presents\nchallenges, such as diverse task demands, uncertainties in dynamic models, and\nsafety issues. To address these concerns, in this paper, we proposed a\nbilateral teleoperation system for rehabilitation. The control scheme of the\nsystem is designed as an integrated framework of impedance control and\ndisturbance observer where the former can ensure compliant human-robot\ninteraction without the need for force sensors while the latter can compensate\nfor dynamic uncertainties when only a roughly identified dynamic model is\navailable.

This study examines mmWave-based coordinated multi-point networks for\nVR applications, where two or multiple APs cooperatively transmit the signals\nto an HMD for connectivity diversity. Instead of using omnireception, we\npropose dual-beam reception based on the analog beamforming at the HMD,\nenhancing the receive beamforming gain towards serving APs while achieving\ndiversity. Evaluation using actual HMD movement data demonstrates the\neffectiveness of our approach, showcasing a reduction in outage rates of up to\n13% compared to quasi-omnidirectional reception with two serving APs, and a 17%\ndecrease compared to steerable single-beam reception with a serving AP.\nWidening the separation angle between two APs can further reduce outage rates\ndue to head rotation as rotations can still be tracked using the steerable\nmulti-beam, albeit at the expense of received signal levels reduction during\nthe non-outage period.",

    "abstract": "As a sensitive functional imaging technique, positron emission tomography\n(PET) plays a critical role in early disease diagnosis. However, obtaining a\nhigh-quality PET image requires injecting a sufficient dose (standard dose) of\nradionuclides into the body, which inevitably poses radiation hazards to\npatients. To mitigate radiation hazards, the reconstruction of standard-dose\nPET (SPET) from low-dose PET (LPET) is desired. According to imaging theory,\nPET reconstruction process involves multiple domains (e.g., projection domain\nand image domain), and a significant portion of the difference between SPET and\nLPET arises from variations in the noise levels introduced during the sampling\nof raw data as sinograms. In light of these two facts, we propose an end-to-end\nTriPle-domain LPET EnhancemenT (TriPLET) framework, by leveraging the\nadvantages of a hybrid denoising-and-reconstruction process and a triple-domain\nrepresentation (i.e., sinograms, frequency spectrum maps, and images) to\nreconstruct SPET images from LPET sinograms. Specifically, TriPLET consists of\nthree sequentially coupled components including 1) a Transformer-assisted\ndenoising network that denoises the inputted LPET sinograms in the projection\ndomain, 2) a discrete-wavelet-transform-based reconstruction network that\nfurther reconstructs SPET from LPET in the wavelet domain, and 3) a pair-based\nadversarial network that evaluates the reconstructed SPET images in the image\ndomain. Extensive experiments on the real PET dataset demonstrate that our\nproposed TriPLET can reconstruct SPET images with the highest similarity and\nsignal-to-noise ratio to real data, compared with state-of-the-art methods.",

While building a\nvoxel map through a hierarchical structure can refine exteroception processing,\nit introduces significant computational overhead, noise, and delays. In this\npaper, we present MOVE, a one-stage end-to-end learning framework capable of\nmulti-skill omnidirectional legged locomotion with limited view in 3D\nenvironments, just like what a real animal can do. When movement aligns with\nthe robot's line of sight, exteroceptive perception enhances locomotion,\nenabling extreme climbing and leaping. When vision is obstructed or the\ndirection of movement lies outside the robot's field of view, the robot relies\non proprioception for tasks like crawling and climbing stairs. We integrate all\nthese skills into a single neural network by introducing a pseudo-siamese\nnetwork structure combining supervised and contrastive learning which helps the\nrobot infer its surroundings beyond its field of view. Experiments in both\nsimulations and real-world scenarios demonstrate the robustness of our method,\nbroadening the operational environments for robotics with egocentric vision.",

To address\nthese issues, this paper proposes DINO-guided Video Editing (DIVE), a framework\ndesigned to facilitate subject-driven editing in source videos conditioned on\neither target text prompts or reference images with specific identities. The\ncore of DIVE lies in leveraging the powerful semantic features extracted from a\npretrained DINOv2 model as implicit correspondences to guide the editing\nprocess. Specifically, to ensure temporal motion consistency, DIVE employs DINO\nfeatures to align with the motion trajectory of the source video. For precise\nsubject editing, DIVE incorporates the DINO features of reference images into a\npretrained text-to-image model to learn Low-Rank Adaptations (LoRAs),\neffectively registering the target subject's identity. Extensive experiments on\ndiverse real-world videos demonstrate that our framework can achieve\nhigh-quality editing results with robust motion consistency, highlighting the\npotential of DINO to contribute to video editing.

Although several fine-tuning and prompting techniques have\nbeen suggested to tackle the issue, they are often tailored to specific tasks\nor come with a substantial increase in computational cost and latency.

Given the same\nprompt, models fine-tuned with PEFT can simultaneously generate multiple\ndiverse responses, each corresponding with a controllable possibility number.\nExperiments on dialogue and story generation tasks demonstrate that PEFT\nsignificantly enhances the diversity of LLM outputs, as evidenced by lower\nsimilarity between candidate responses.

Moreover, even within the same domain,\ncurrent VAD approaches often follow a \"one-category-one-model\" paradigm,\nrequiring large amounts of normal samples to train class-specific models,\nresulting in poor generalizability and hindering unified evaluation across\ndomains. To address this issue, we propose a generalized few-shot VAD method,\nUniVAD, capable of detecting anomalies across various domains, such as\nindustrial, logical, and medical anomalies, with a training-free unified model.\nUniVAD only needs few normal samples as references during testing to detect\nanomalies in previously unseen objects, without training on the specific\ndomain. Specifically, UniVAD employs a Contextual Component Clustering ($C^3$)\nmodule based on clustering and vision foundation models to segment components\nwithin the image accurately, and leverages Component-Aware Patch Matching\n(CAPM) and Graph-Enhanced Component Modeling (GECM) modules to detect anomalies\nat different semantic levels, which are aggregated to produce the final\ndetection result.

Estimated g-band\nmagnitudes for vehicles were 19.57 at a range of 4.4e5 km and 15.53 at a range\nof 3.2e5 km for CAPSTONE and Artemis Orion, respectively. In addition to\nobservations, we present reflectance signature modeling implemented in the\nLunaTK space-sensing simulation framework and compare calculated apparent\nmagnitudes to observed. Design of RApid Telescopes for Optical Response\n(RAPTOR) instruments, observing campaigns of Artemis Orion and CAPSTONE\nmissions, and initial comparisons to electro-optical modeling are reviewed.",

    "abstract": "Understanding travelers' route choices can help policymakers devise optimal\noperational and planning strategies for both normal and abnormal circumstances.\nHowever, existing choice modeling methods often rely on predefined assumptions\nand struggle to capture the dynamic and adaptive nature of travel behavior.\nRecently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative,\ndemonstrating remarkable ability to replicate human-like behaviors across\nvarious fields. Despite this potential, their capacity to accurately simulate\nhuman route choice behavior in transportation contexts remains doubtful. To\nsatisfy this curiosity, this paper investigates the potential of LLMs for route\nchoice modeling by introducing an LLM-empowered agent, \"LLMTraveler.\" This\nagent integrates an LLM as its core, equipped with a memory system that learns\nfrom past experiences and makes decisions by balancing retrieved data and\npersonality traits. The study systematically evaluates the LLMTraveler's\nability to replicate human-like decision-making through two stages of\nday-to-day (DTD) congestion games: (1) analyzing its route-switching behavior\nin single origin-destination (OD) pair scenarios, where it demonstrates\npatterns that align with laboratory data but cannot be fully explained by\ntraditional models, and (2) testing its capacity to model adaptive learning\nbehaviors in multi-OD scenarios on the Ortuzar and Willumsen (OW) network,\nproducing results comparable to Multinomial Logit (MNL) and Reinforcement\nLearning (RL) models. These experiments demonstrate that the framework can\npartially replicate human-like decision-making in route choice while providing\nnatural language explanations for its decisions. This capability offers\nvaluable insights for transportation policymaking, such as simulating traveler\nresponses to new policies or changes in the network.",

    "abstract": "In a previous paper we showed that an inhomogeneous body in vacuum will\nexperience a spontaneous force if it is not in thermal equilibrium with its\nenvironment. This is due to the asymmetric asymptotic radiation pattern such an\nobject emits. We demonstrated this self-propulsive force by considering an\nexpansion in powers of the electric susceptibility: A torque arises in first\norder, but only if the material constituting the body is nonreciprocal. No\nforce arises in first order. A force does occur for bodies made of ordinary\n(reciprocal) materials in second order. Here we extend these considerations to\nthe torque. As one would expect, a spontaneous torque will also appear on an\ninhomogeneous chiral object if it is out of thermal equilibrium with its\nenvironment. Once a chiral body starts to rotate, it will experience a small\nquantum frictional torque, but much more important, unless a mechanism is\nprovided to maintain the nonequilibrium state, is thermalization: The body will\nrapidly reach thermal equilibrium with the vacuum, and the angular acceleration\nwill essentially become zero. For a small, or even a large, inhomogeneous\nchiral body, a terminal angular velocity will result, which seems to be in the\nrealm of observability.",

Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets\ndemonstrate that our approach outperforms previously proposed approaches\nregarding per-key accuracy and distribution.

To test the interaction between the CPS software and the\nsystem's physics, engineers provide traces of desired physical states and\nobserve traces of the actual physical states. CPS requirements describe how\nclosely the actual physical traces should track the desired traces. These\nrequirements are typically defined for specific, simple input traces such as\nstep or ramp sequences, and thus are not applicable to arbitrary inputs. This\nlimits the availability of oracles for CPSs. Our recent work proposes an\napproach to testing CPS using control-theoretical design assumptions instead of\nrequirements. This approach circumvents the oracle problem by leveraging the\ncontrol-theoretical guarantees that are provided when the design assumptions\nare satisfied. To address the test case generation and oracle problems,\nresearchers have proposed metamorphic testing, which is based on the study of\nrelations across tests, i.e., metamorphic relations (MRs). In this work, we\ndefine MRs based on the design assumptions and explore combinations of these\nMRs using genetic programming to generate CPS test cases. This enables the\ngeneration of CPS input traces with potentially arbitrary shapes, together with\nassociated expected output traces. We use the deviation from the expected\noutput traces to guide the generation of input traces that falsify the MRs. Our\nexperiment results show that the MR-falsification provides engineers with new\ninformation, helping them identify passed and failed test cases. Furthermore,\nwe show that the generation of traces that falsify the MRs is a non-trivial\nproblem, which is successfully addressed by our genetic search.",

Roughness and adhesion are known to constrain\nthe relative motion of particles, and thus globally affect the shear response,\nbut an experimental description of how they microscopically influence the\ntransmission of forces and relative displacements within contacts is lacking.\nHere we show that an innovative colloidal-probe atomic force microscopy\ntechnique allows the simultaneous measurement of normal and tangential forces\nexchanged between tailored surfaces and microparticles while tracking their\nrelative sliding and rolling, unlocking the direct measurement of coefficients\nof rolling friction, as well as of sliding friction. We demonstrate that, in\nthe presence of sufficient traction, particles spontaneously roll, reducing\ndissipation and promoting longer-lasting contacts. Conversely, when rolling is\nprevented, friction is greatly enhanced for rough and adhesive surfaces, while\nsmooth particles coated by polymer brushes maintain well-lubricated contacts.\nWe find that surface roughness induces rolling due to load-dependent asperity\ninterlocking, leading to large off-axis particle rotations. In contrast,\nsmooth, adhesive surfaces promote rolling along the principal axis of motion.\nOur results offer direct values of friction coefficients for numerical studies\nand an interpretation of the onset of discontinuous shear thickening based on\nthem, opening up new ways to tailor rheology via contact engineering.",

A promising approach to accelerating\nlarge VLM inference is using partial information, such as attention maps from\nspecific layers, to assess token importance and prune less essential tokens.\nHowever, our study reveals three key insights: (i) Partial attention\ninformation is insufficient for accurately identifying critical visual tokens,\nresulting in suboptimal performance, especially at low token retention ratios;\n(ii) Global attention information, such as the attention map aggregated across\nall layers, more effectively preserves essential tokens and maintains\ncomparable performance under aggressive pruning. However, the attention maps\nfrom all layers requires a full inference pass, which increases computational\nload and is therefore impractical in existing methods; and (iii) The global\nattention map aggregated from a small VLM closely resembles that of a large\nVLM, suggesting an efficient alternative.

Unlike previous works\nthat typically focus on one-to-one generation, producing a single output image\nfrom a single input image, our approach acknowledges the inherent one-to-many\nnature of the problem. This recognition stems from the challenges posed by\ndifferences in illumination, weather conditions, and occlusions between the two\nviews.

Specifically, we exploit random Gaussian noise to\nrepresent the diverse possibilities learnt from the target view data. We\nintroduce a Geometry-guided Cross-view Condition (GCC) strategy to establish\nexplicit geometric correspondences between satellite and street-view features.\nThis enables us to resolve the geometry ambiguity introduced by camera pose\nbetween image pairs, boosting the performance of cross-view image synthesis.\nThrough extensive quantitative and qualitative analyses on three benchmark\ncross-view datasets, we demonstrate the superiority of our proposed\ngeometry-guided cross-view condition over baseline methods, including recent\nstate-of-the-art approaches in cross-view image synthesis. Our method generates\nimages of higher quality, fidelity, and diversity than other state-of-the-art\napproaches.",

    "abstract": "Augmentation-based self-supervised learning methods have shown remarkable\nsuccess in self-supervised visual representation learning, excelling in\nlearning invariant features but often neglecting equivariant ones. This\nlimitation reduces the generalizability of foundation models, particularly for\ndownstream tasks requiring equivariance. We propose integrating an image\nreconstruction task as an auxiliary component in augmentation-based\nself-supervised learning algorithms to facilitate equivariant feature learning\nwithout additional parameters. Our method implements a cross-attention\nmechanism to blend features learned from two augmented views, subsequently\nreconstructing one of them. This approach is adaptable to various datasets and\naugmented-pair based learning methods. We evaluate its effectiveness on\nlearning equivariant features through multiple linear regression tasks and\ndownstream applications on both artificial (3DIEBench) and natural (ImageNet)\ndatasets. Results consistently demonstrate significant improvements over\nstandard augmentation-based self-supervised learning methods and\nstate-of-the-art approaches, particularly excelling in scenarios involving\ncombined augmentations. Our method enhances the learning of both invariant and\nequivariant features, leading to more robust and generalizable visual\nrepresentations for computer vision tasks.",

The\ndewetting process is observed using a transparent lifted Hele-Shaw cell.

Finger-like\nstructures, characteristic of the Saffman-Taylor instability are observed. The\ntotal length of the dendrites and the intersecting number of branches are\nquantified. We reveal the roles of microparticles, nanoparticles, and the\nsecondary liquid during the fingering instability. The addition of\nmicroparticles to pure liquid enhanced finger length due to increased particle\ninteractions and nucleation sites for bubbles. The addition of secondary fluid\nreduces fingering length by forming a strong interparticle network.\nIncorporation of nanoparticles induces an early onset of cavitation and\nenhances fingering instability. However, nanoparticles make the capillary\nsuspensions' overall microstructure more homogeneous, reduce the sample\nvariation in fingering patterns, and promote the even distribution of gel on\nboth slides during splitting. These findings highlight the complex interactions\ngoverning dewetting in capillary (nano)suspensions.

These biases stem not only from\ndifferences in language but also from the cultural knowledge required to\ninterpret questions, reducing the practical utility of translated datasets like\nMMLU. Furthermore, translation often introduces artefacts that can distort the\nmeaning or clarity of questions in the target language. A common practice in\nmultilingual evaluation is to rely on machine-translated evaluation sets, but\nsimply translating a dataset is insufficient to address these challenges. In\nthis work, we trace the impact of both of these issues on multilingual\nevaluations and ensuing model performances. Our large-scale evaluation of\nstate-of-the-art open and proprietary models illustrates that progress on MMLU\ndepends heavily on learning Western-centric concepts, with 28% of all questions\nrequiring culturally sensitive knowledge. Moreover, for questions requiring\ngeographic knowledge, an astounding 84.9% focus on either North American or\nEuropean regions. Rankings of model evaluations change depending on whether\nthey are evaluated on the full portion or the subset of questions annotated as\nculturally sensitive, showing the distortion to model rankings when blindly\nrelying on translated MMLU.

    "abstract": "Human emotions are complex and can be conveyed through nuanced touch\ngestures. Previous research has primarily focused on how humans recognize\nemotions through touch or on identifying key features of emotional expression\nfor robots. However, there is a gap in understanding how reliably these\nemotions and gestures can be communicated to robots via touch and interpreted\nusing data driven methods. This study investigates the consistency and\ndistinguishability of emotional and gestural expressions through touch and\nsound. To this end, we integrated a custom piezoresistive pressure sensor as\nwell as a microphone on a social robot. Twenty-eight participants first\nconveyed ten different emotions to the robot using spontaneous touch gestures,\nthen they performed six predefined social touch gestures. Our findings reveal\nstatistically significant consistency in both emotion and gesture expression\namong participants. However, some emotions exhibited low intraclass correlation\nvalues, and certain emotions with similar levels of arousal or valence did not\nshow significant differences in their conveyance. To investigate emotion and\nsocial gesture decoding within affective human-robot tactile interaction, we\ndeveloped single-modality models and multimodal models integrating tactile and\nauditory features. A support vector machine (SVM) model trained on multimodal\nfeatures achieved the highest accuracy for classifying ten emotions, reaching\n40 %.For gesture classification, a Convolutional Neural Network- Long\nShort-Term Memory Network (CNN-LSTM) achieved 90.74 % accuracy. Our results\ndemonstrate that even though the unimodal models have the potential to decode\nemotions and touch gestures, the multimodal integration of touch and sound\nsignificantly outperforms unimodal approaches, enhancing the decoding of both\nemotions and gestures.",

    "abstract": "Estimates of seismic wave speeds in the Earth (seismic velocity models) are\nkey input parameters to earthquake simulations for ground motion prediction.\nOwing to the non-uniqueness of the seismic inverse problem, typically many\nvelocity models exist for any given region. The arbitrary choice of which\nvelocity model to use in earthquake simulations impacts ground motion\npredictions. However, current hazard analysis methods do not account for this\nsource of uncertainty. We present a proof-of-concept ground motion prediction\nworkflow for incorporating uncertainties arising from inconsistencies between\nexisting seismic velocity models. Our analysis is based on the probabilistic\nfusion of overlapping seismic velocity models using scalable Gaussian process\n(GP) regression. Specifically, we fit a GP to two synthetic 1-D velocity\nprofiles simultaneously, and show that the predictive uncertainty accounts for\nthe differences between the models. We subsequently draw velocity model samples\nfrom the predictive distribution and estimate peak ground displacement using\nacoustic wave propagation through the velocity models. The resulting\ndistribution of possible ground motion amplitudes is much wider than would be\npredicted by simulating shaking using only the two input velocity models. This\nproof-of-concept illustrates the importance of probabilistic methods for\nphysics-based seismic hazard analysis.",

For this purpose, we propose a two-stage dose-finding design.

Subsequently, a diffusion model is\nattached to generate robust action outputs. To enhance policy learning through\nself-reasoning, we introduce a novel reasoning injection module that integrates\nreasoning phrases directly into the policy learning process. The whole\nframework is simple and flexible, making it easy to deploy and upgrade. We\nconduct extensive experiments using multiple real robots to validate the\neffectiveness of DiffusionVLA. Our tests include a challenging factory sorting\ntask, where DiffusionVLA successfully categorizes objects, including those not\nseen during training. We observe that the reasoning module makes the model\ninterpretable. It allows observers to understand the model thought process and\nidentify potential causes of policy failures. Additionally, we test\nDiffusionVLA on a zero-shot bin-picking task, achieving 63.7\\% accuracy on 102\npreviously unseen objects.

This approach not\nonly ensures convergence to a unique global optimum, but also enhances the\nefficiency and accuracy of modeling dynamical systems in an online setting.\nLeveraging the Bayesian DMD framework, we propose a probabilistic\ninterpretation of Physics-informed DMD (piDMD), examining the impact of\nphysical constraints on the DMD linear operator. Further, we implement online\nproximal gradient descent and formulate specific algorithms to tackle problems\nwith different physical constraints, enabling real-time solutions across\nvarious scenarios. Compared with existing algorithms such as Exact DMD, Online\nDMD, and piDMD, OPIDMD achieves the best prediction performance in short-term\nforecasting, e.g. an $R^2$ value of 0.991 for noisy Lorenz system.

Many\napproaches have been proposed to overcome these limitations, but efforts to\nmake them efficient and widely available are hampered by the need to\nincorporate an ad hoc implementation of methods to treat long-range\ninteractions.

We provide a reference implementation for pyTorch as\nwell as an experimental one for JAX. Beyond Coulomb and more general long-range\npotentials, we introduce purified descriptors which disregard the immediate\nneighborhood of each atom, and are more suitable for general long-ranged ML\napplications. Our implementations are fast, feature-rich, and modular: They\nprovide an accurate evaluation of physical long-range forces that can be used\nin the construction of (semi)empirical baseline potentials; they exploit the\navailability of automatic differentiation to seamlessly combine long-range\nmodels with conventional, local ML schemes; and they are sufficiently flexible\nto implement more complex architectures that use physical interactions as\nbuilding blocks.

Although conventional channel estimation methods calibrate array\nerrors through offline operation with large training pilots, the calibration\nerrors remain due to time-varying array errors. Therefore, the proposed channel\nestimation method calibrates array errors online with small pilot overhead. In\nthe proposed method, array response matrices are explicitly decomposed into a\nsmall number of physical parameters including path gains, angles and array\nerrors, which are iteratively estimated by alternating optimization based on a\nmaximum likelihood (ML) criterion. To enhance the convergence performance, we\nintroduce a switching mechanism from an ongrid algorithm to an off-gird\nalgorithm depending on the estimation accuracy of the array error during\nalgorithmic iterations. Furthermore, we introduce an approximate mutual\ncoupling model to reduce the number of parameters.

Lately, interest has risen around a\ngeneralization of the theory of $(\\varphi,\\Gamma)$-modules, replacing the\ncyclotomic extension with an arbitrary infinitely ramified $p$-adic Lie\nextension. Computations from Berger suggest that locally analytic vectors\nshould provide such a generalization for any arbitrary infinitely ramified\n$p$-adic Lie extension, and this has been conjectured by Kedlaya.\n  In this paper, we focus on the case of $\\mathbf{Z}_p$-extensions, using\nrecent work of Berger-Rozensztajn and Porat on an integral version of locally\nanalytic vectors and explain what is the structure of the locally analytic\nvectors in the higher rings of periods $\\widetilde{\\mathbf{A}}^{\\dagger}$ in\nthis setting. We then use this result to construct, in the anticyclotomic\nsetting and assuming that Kedlaya's conjecture holds, an element in the field\nof fractions of the Robba ring which ``should not exist'' according to a\nconjecture of Berger. As a consequence, we prove that this conjecture of Berger\non substitution maps on the Robba ring is incompatible with Kedlaya's\nconjecture.\n  Should Berger's conjecture hold, this would provide an example of an\nextension for which there is no overconvergent lift of its field of norms and\nfor which there exist nontrivial higher locally analytic vectors.",

    "abstract": "Dialogue state tracking (DST) plays an essential role in task-oriented\ndialogue systems. However, user's input may contain implicit information,\nposing significant challenges for DST tasks. Additionally, DST data includes\ncomplex information, which not only contains a large amount of noise unrelated\nto the current turn, but also makes constructing DST datasets expensive. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce Intent-driven In-context Learning for\nFew-shot DST (IDIC-DST). By extracting user's intent, we propose an\nIntent-driven Dialogue Information Augmentation module to augment the dialogue\ninformation, which can track dialogue states more effectively. Moreover, we\nmask noisy information from DST data and rewrite user's input in the\nIntent-driven Examples Retrieval module, where we retrieve similar examples. We\nthen utilize a pre-trained large language model to update the dialogue state\nusing the augmented dialogue information and examples. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that IDIC-DST achieves state-of-the-art performance in few-shot\nsettings on MultiWOZ 2.1 and MultiWOZ 2.4 datasets.",

Most of the existing methods adopt the denoising loss\nfrom DDPMs for model optimization. We posit that introducing reward feedback\nlearning to finetune the existing models can further improve the quality of the\ngenerated images. In this paper, we propose a timestep-aware training strategy\nwith reward feedback learning. Specifically, in the initial denoising stages of\nISR diffusion, we apply low-frequency constraints to super-resolution (SR)\nimages to maintain structural stability. In the later denoising stages, we use\nreward feedback learning to improve the perceptual and aesthetic quality of the\nSR images. In addition, we incorporate Gram-KL regularization to alleviate\nstylization caused by reward hacking. Our method can be integrated into any\ndiffusion-based ISR model in a plug-and-play manner. Experiments show that ISR\ndiffusion models, when fine-tuned with our method, significantly improve the\nperceptual and aesthetic quality of SR images, achieving excellent subjective\nresults.

CoTM utilizes\nTsetlin automata (TA) to create Boolean feature selections stochastically\nacross parallel clauses.

We find that the final separation\nvelocity between the centers of masses of the two WDs' ejecta is ~80% of the\npre-explosion WDs' orbital velocity, i.e., we find separation velocities of\n4200-5400 km/s for two WDs of masses M1=M2=0.94 Mo. The lower separation\nvelocities we find challenge scenarios with two exploding WDs to explain\nbimodal emission line profiles with observed velocity separations of up to\n~7000 km/s. Only the mass in the ejecta of one WD with an explosion velocity\nlower than the separation velocity contributes to one peak of the bimodal\nprofile; this is the inner ejecta. We find the inner ejecta to be only <15% of\nthe ejecta mass in energetic explosions. Less energetic explosions yield higher\ninner mass but lower separation velocities.

However, existing methods either handle conditions inefficiently or\nuse a fixed number of conditions, which does not fully address the complexity\nof multiple conditions and their potential conflicts. This underscores the need\nfor innovative approaches to manage multiple conditions effectively for more\nreliable and detailed image synthesis. To address this issue, we propose a\nnovel framework, DynamicControl, which supports dynamic combinations of diverse\ncontrol signals, allowing adaptive selection of different numbers and types of\nconditions. Our approach begins with a double-cycle controller that generates\nan initial real score sorting for all input conditions by leveraging\npre-trained conditional generation models and discriminative models. This\ncontroller evaluates the similarity between extracted conditions and input\nconditions, as well as the pixel-level similarity with the source image. Then,\nwe integrate a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to build an efficient\ncondition evaluator. This evaluator optimizes the ordering of conditions based\non the double-cycle controller's score ranking. Our method jointly optimizes\nMLLMs and diffusion models, utilizing MLLMs' reasoning capabilities to\nfacilitate multi-condition text-to-image (T2I) tasks. The final sorted\nconditions are fed into a parallel multi-control adapter, which learns feature\nmaps from dynamic visual conditions and integrates them to modulate ControlNet,\nthereby enhancing control over generated images. Through both quantitative and\nqualitative comparisons, DynamicControl demonstrates its superiority over\nexisting methods in terms of controllability, generation quality and\ncomposability under various conditional controls.",

    "abstract": "Multi-modal image fusion aggregates information from multiple sensor sources,\nachieving superior visual quality and perceptual features compared to\nsingle-source images, often improving downstream tasks. However, current fusion\nmethods for downstream tasks still use predefined fusion objectives that\npotentially mismatch the downstream tasks, limiting adaptive guidance and\nreducing model flexibility. To address this, we propose Task-driven Image\nFusion (TDFusion), a fusion framework incorporating a learnable fusion loss\nguided by task loss. Specifically, our fusion loss includes learnable\nparameters modeled by a neural network called the loss generation module. This\nmodule is supervised by the downstream task loss in a meta-learning manner. The\nlearning objective is to minimize the task loss of fused images after\noptimizing the fusion module with the fusion loss. Iterative updates between\nthe fusion module and the loss module ensure that the fusion network evolves\ntoward minimizing task loss, guiding the fusion process toward the task\nobjectives. TDFusion's training relies entirely on the downstream task loss,\nmaking it adaptable to any specific task. It can be applied to any architecture\nof fusion and task networks. Experiments demonstrate TDFusion's performance\nthrough fusion experiments conducted on four different datasets, in addition to\nevaluations on semantic segmentation and object detection tasks.",

Our incremental algorithm improves over\nthe $8$-approximation algorithm by Charikar, Chekuri, Feder, and Motwani [STOC\n'97]. Finally, we remark that since all three of our algorithms are\ndeterministic, they work against an adaptive adversary.",

While the large dimensionality of input token space makes it\ninevitable to find adversarial prompts that can jailbreak these models, we aim\nto evaluate whether safety fine-tuned LLMs are safe against natural prompts\nwhich are semantically related to toxic seed prompts that elicit safe responses\nafter alignment. We surprisingly find that popular aligned LLMs such as GPT-4\ncan be compromised using naive prompts that are NOT even crafted with an\nobjective of jailbreaking the model. Furthermore, we empirically show that\ngiven a seed prompt that elicits a toxic response from an unaligned model, one\ncan systematically generate several semantically related natural prompts that\ncan jailbreak aligned LLMs. Towards this, we propose a method of Response\nGuided Question Augmentation (ReG-QA) to evaluate the generalization of safety\naligned LLMs to natural prompts, that first generates several toxic answers\ngiven a seed question using an unaligned LLM (Q to A), and further leverages an\nLLM to generate questions that are likely to produce these answers (A to Q). We\ninterestingly find that safety fine-tuned LLMs such as GPT-4o are vulnerable to\nproducing natural jailbreak questions from unsafe content (without denial) and\ncan thus be used for the latter (A to Q) step.

First, when the inertial dynamics is slow\ncompared to the discrete-state transitions, we show that the steady-state\nenergy and information flows vanish at the leading order in an adiabatic\napproximation, if the underdamped subsystem is governed purely by conservative\nforces. To capture the non-zero contributions, we consistently derive dynamical\nequations valid to higher order.

To cope with this typical calibration data shortage challenge in\nEEG-based BCIs, this paper proposes a parameter-free channel reflection (CR)\ndata augmentation approach that incorporates prior knowledge on the channel\ndistributions of different BCI paradigms in data augmentation. Experiments on\neight public EEG datasets across four different BCI paradigms (motor imagery,\nsteady-state visual evoked potential, P300, and seizure classifications) using\ndifferent decoding algorithms demonstrated that: 1) CR is effective, i.e., it\ncan noticeably improve the classification accuracy; 2) CR is robust, i.e., it\nconsistently outperforms existing data augmentation approaches in the\nliterature; and, 3) CR is flexible, i.e., it can be combined with other data\naugmentation approaches to further increase the performance.

We design and implement efficient algorithms and systems for\nclustering, selection, indexing and caching. Experiment results show that\nClusterKV attains negligible accuracy loss across various tasks with 32k\ncontext lengths, using only a 1k to 2k KV cache budget, and achieves up to a\n2$\\times$ speedup in latency and a 2.5$\\times$ improvement in decoding\nthroughput. Compared to SoTA recallable KV compression methods, ClusterKV\ndemonstrates higher model accuracy and output quality, while maintaining or\nexceeding inference efficiency.

Previous works in SSDA\nmainly focused on learning transferable representations across domains.\nHowever, it is difficult to find a feature space where the source and target\ndomains share the same conditional probability distribution. Additionally,\nthere is no flexible and effective strategy extending existing unsupervised\ndomain adaptation (UDA) approaches to SSDA settings. In order to solve the\nabove two challenges, we propose a novel fine-tuning framework, semi-supervised\ntransfer boosting (SS-TrBoosting). Given a well-trained deep learning-based UDA\nor SSDA model, we use it as the initial model, generate additional base\nlearners by boosting, and then use all of them as an ensemble. More\nspecifically, half of the base learners are generated by supervised domain\nadaptation, and half by semi-supervised learning. Furthermore, for more\nefficient data transmission and better data privacy protection, we propose a\nsource data generation approach to extend SS-TrBoosting to semi-supervised\nsource-free domain adaptation (SS-SFDA). Extensive experiments showed that\nSS-TrBoosting can be applied to a variety of existing UDA, SSDA and SFDA\napproaches to further improve their performance.",

    "abstract": "Quiet-Sun Ellerman bombs (QSEBs) are small-scale magnetic reconnection events\nin the lower atmosphere of the quiet Sun. Recent work has shown that a small\npercentage of them can occur co-spatially and co-temporally to ultraviolet (UV)\nbrightenings in the transition region. We aim to understand how the magnetic\ntopologies associated with closely occurring QSEBs and UV brightenings can\nfacilitate energy transport and connect these events. We used high-resolution\nH-beta observations from the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST) and detected\nQSEBs using k-means clustering. We obtained the magnetic field topology from\npotential field extrapolations using spectro-polarimetric data in the\nphotospheric Fe I 6173 A line. To detect UV brightenings, we used coordinated\nand co-aligned data from the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) and\nimposed a threshold of 5 sigma above the median background on the (IRIS) 1400 A\nslit-jaw image channel. We identify four distinct magnetic configurations that\nassociate QSEBs with UV brightenings, including a simple dipole configuration\nand more complex fan-spine topologies with a three-dimensional (3D) magnetic\nnull point. In the fan-spine topology, the UV brightenings occur near the 3D\nnull point, while QSEBs can be found close to the footpoints of the outer\nspine, the inner spine, and the fan surface. We find that the height of the 3D\nnull varies between 0.2 Mm to 2.6 Mm, depending on the magnetic field strength\nin the region. We note that some QSEBs and UV brightenings, though occurring\nclose to each other, are not topologically connected with the same reconnection\nprocess. We find that the energy released during QSEBs falls in the range of\n10^23 to 10^24 ergs. This study shows that magnetic connectivity and\ntopological features, like 3D null points, are crucial in linking QSEBs in the\nlower atmosphere with UV brightenings in the transition region.",

For instance,\nclassical approaches to the problem of image quality are based on models that\ninclude knowledge about human vision. However, nowadays, deep learning\napproaches have obtained competitive results by simply approaching this problem\nas regression of human decisions, and training an standard network on\nhuman-rated datasets. These approaches have the advantages of being easily\nadaptable to a particular problem and they fit very efficiently when data is\navailable. However, mainly due to the excess of parameters, they have the\nproblems of lack of interpretability, and over-fitting. Here we propose a\nvision model that combines the best of both worlds by using a parametric neural\nnetwork architecture. We parameterize the layers to have bioplausible\nfunctionality, and provide a set of bioplausible parameters. We analyzed\ndifferent versions of the model and compared it with the non-parametric\nversion. The parametric models achieve a three orders of magnitude reduction in\nthe number of parameters without suffering in regression performance.\nFurthermore, we show that the parametric models behave better during training\nand are easier to interpret as vision models. Interestingly, we find that, even\ninitialized with bioplausible trained for regression using human rated\ndatasets, which we call the feature-spreading problem.

The proof is based on arguments that are typical in dynamical\nsystems. The nature of the non-local operator makes this possible, since the\nresulting travelling wave equation can be seen as a delayed\nintegro-differential equation.

While the Koopman operator has already been\nsuccessfully employed in model predictive control, the challenge of addressing\nmixed boundary constraints within the Koopman framework has remained an open\nquestion.

This separation yields a low-dimensional upper-level problem, which\ncould be exploited in global optimization algorithms.

    "abstract": "To better understand the mechanics of injection-induced seismicity, we\ndeveloped a two-dimensional numerical code to simulate both seismic and\naseismic slip on non-planar faults and fault networks driven by fluid diffusion\nalong permeable faults. Our approach integrates a boundary element method to\nmodel fault slip governed by rate-and-state friction with a finite volume\nmethod for simulating fluid diffusion along fault networks. We demonstrate the\nmethod's capabilities with two illustrative examples: (1) fluid injection\ninducing slow slip on a primary rough, rate-strengthening fault, which\nsubsequently triggers microseismicity on secondary, smaller faults, and (2)\nfluid injection on a single fault in a network of intersecting faults, leading\nto fluid diffusion and reactivation of slip throughout the network. In both\ncases, the simulated slow slip migrates more rapidly than the fluid pressure\ndiffusion front. The observed migration patterns of microseismicity in the\nfirst example and slow slip in the second example resemble diffusion processes\nbut involve diffusivity values that differ significantly from the fault\nhydraulic diffusivity. These results support the conclusion that the\nmicroseismicity front is not a direct proxy for the fluid diffusion front and\ncannot be used to directly infer hydraulic diffusivity, consistently with some\ndecametric scale in-situ experiments of fault activation under controlled\nconditions. This work highlights the importance of distinguishing between\nmechanical and hydrological processes in the analysis of induced seismicity,\nproviding a powerful tool for improving our understanding of fault behavior in\nresponse to fluid injection, in particular when a network of faults is\ninvolved.",

    "abstract": "While question-like queries are gaining popularity and search engines' users\nincreasingly adopt them, keyphrase search has traditionally been the\ncornerstone of web search. This query type is also prevalent in specialised\nsearch tasks such as academic or professional search, where experts rely on\nkeyphrases to articulate their information needs. However, current dense\nretrieval models often fail with keyphrase-like queries, primarily because they\nare mostly trained on question-like ones. This paper introduces a novel model\nthat employs the ColBERT architecture to enhance document ranking for keyphrase\nqueries. For that, given the lack of large keyphrase-based retrieval datasets,\nwe first explore how Large Language Models can convert question-like queries\ninto keyphrase format. Then, using those keyphrases, we train a keyphrase-based\nColBERT ranker (ColBERTKP_QD) to improve the performance when working with\nkeyphrase queries. Furthermore, to reduce the training costs associated with\ntraining the full ColBERT model, we investigate the feasibility of training\nonly a keyphrase query encoder while keeping the document encoder weights\nstatic (ColBERTKP_Q). We assess our proposals' ranking performance using both\nautomatically generated and manually annotated keyphrases. Our results reveal\nthe potential of the late interaction architecture when working under the\nkeyphrase search scenario.",

Traditional centralized\napproaches are increasingly unsuitable to this task, as they struggle to scale\nwith expanding sensor networks, and reliability issues in central components\ncan easily affect the whole deployment. To address these challenges, we explore\nand adapt semi-decentralized training techniques for Spatio-Temporal Graph\nNeural Networks (ST-GNNs) in smart mobility domain. We implement a simulation\nframework where sensors are grouped by proximity into multiple cloudlets, each\nhandling a subgraph of the traffic graph, fetching node features from other\ncloudlets to train its own local ST-GNN model, and exchanging model updates\nwith other cloudlets to ensure consistency, enhancing scalability and removing\nreliance on a centralized aggregator.

Experimental results show that semi-decentralized setups are\ncomparable to centralized approaches in performance metrics, while offering\nadvantages in terms of scalability and fault tolerance. In addition, we\nhighlight often overlooked issues in existing literature for distributed\nST-GNNs, such as the variation in model performance across different\ngeographical areas due to region-specific traffic patterns, and the significant\ncommunication overhead and computational costs that arise from the large\nreceptive field of GNNs, leading to substantial data transfers and increased\ncomputation of partial embeddings.",

    "abstract": "Borrowing historical data for use in clinical trials has increased in recent\nyears. This is accomplished in the Bayesian framework by specification of\ninformative prior distributions. One such approach is the robust mixture prior\narising as a weighted mixture of an informative prior and a robust prior\ninducing dynamic borrowing that allows to borrow most when the current and\nexternal data are observed to be similar. The robust mixture prior requires the\nchoice of three additional quantities: the mixture weight, and the mean and\ndispersion of the robust component. Some general guidance is available, but a\ncase-by-case study of the impact of these quantities on specific operating\ncharacteristics seems lacking. We focus on evaluating the impact of parameter\nchoices for the robust component of the mixture prior in one-arm and\nhybrid-control trials. The results show that all three quantities can strongly\nimpact the operating characteristics. In particular, as already known, variance\nof the robust component is linked to robustness. Less known, however, is that\nits location can have a strong impact on Type I error rate and MSE which can\neven become unbounded. Further, the impact of the weight choice is strongly\nlinked with the robust component's location and variance. Recommendations are\nprovided for the choice of the robust component parameters, prior weight,\nalternative functional form for this component as well as considerations to\nkeep in mind when evaluating operating characteristics.",

In this paper, we\nprovide a quantitative proof of this convergence in terms of the Wasserstein\ndistance of order $1$. First, we establish an upper bound on the distance\nbetween the probability distribution of the function generated by any untrained\nnetwork with finite width and the Gaussian process with the same covariance.\nThis proof utilizes Stein's method to estimate the Wasserstein distance of\norder $1$. Next, we analyze the training dynamics of the network via gradient\nflow, proving an upper bound on the distance between the probability\ndistribution of the function generated by the trained network and the\ncorresponding Gaussian process. This proof is based on a quantitative upper\nbound on the maximum variation of a parameter during training.

MTL\nnot only reduces training and inference time as opposed to having multiple\nsingle-task models, but also enhances task accuracy through the interaction of\nmultiple tasks. However, existing methods face limitations. They often rely on\nsuboptimal cross-task interactions, resulting in task-specific predictions with\npoor geometric and predictive coherence. In addition, many approaches use\ninadequate loss weighting strategies, which do not address the inherent\nvariability in task evolution during training.

Current finetuning-free methods simply adopt a single\ntraining stage with a simple image reconstruction task, and they typically\ngenerate low-quality images inconsistent with the reference images during\ntest-time. To mitigate this problem, inspired by the recent DPO (i.e., direct\npreference optimization) technique, this work proposes an additional training\nstage to improve the pre-trained personalized generation models. However,\ntraditional DPO only determines the overall superiority or inferiority of two\nsamples, which is not suitable for personalized image generation because the\ngenerated images are commonly inconsistent with the reference images only in\nsome local image patches. To tackle this problem, this work proposes PatchDPO\nthat estimates the quality of image patches within each generated image and\naccordingly trains the model. To this end, PatchDPO first leverages the\npre-trained vision model with a proposed self-supervised training method to\nestimate the patch quality. Next, PatchDPO adopts a weighted training approach\nto train the model with the estimated patch quality, which rewards the image\npatches with high quality while penalizing the image patches with low quality.\nExperiment results demonstrate that PatchDPO significantly improves the\nperformance of multiple pre-trained personalized generation models, and\nachieves state-of-the-art performance on both single-object and multi-object\npersonalized image generation.

Such\nattacks are directed toward elements of the environment where these systems\noperate and their effectiveness is assessed in terms of system-level failures\ntriggered by them. There has been however no systematic attempt to analyze and\ncategorize such attacks. In this paper, we present the first taxonomy of\nsystem-level attacks against autonomous vehicles. We constructed our taxonomy\nby selecting 21 highly relevant papers, then we tagged them with 12 top-level\ntaxonomy categories and several sub-categories. The taxonomy allowed us to\ninvestigate the attack features, the most attacked components and systems, the\nunderlying threat models, and the failure chains from input perturbation to\nsystem-level failure.

Two different kinds of sources of\n$e^+/e^-$, dark matter~(DM) annihilation and cosmic rays~(CR) related to\nmassive stars, are taken into account in this paper. We fit the multiple\nlow-frequency radio observations, from 19.7 MHz to 1.4 GHz, with a double\npower-law model $S_{nth} =S_{DM}(\\frac\n{\\nu}{\\nu_{\\star}})^{-\\alpha_{DM}}+S_{CR}( \\frac\n{\\nu}{\\nu_{\\star}})^{-\\alpha_{CR}} $. $\\nu_{\\star}$ is set to be $1.4$ GHz and\n$S_{CR}$ could be determined from the 24 $\\mu m$ luminosity based on the global\nradio-infrared correlation. Our best fit with a fixed $\\alpha_{CR}$ changing\nfrom $0.80$ to $0.55$ yields $\\alpha_{DM}$ ranging from $0.21$ to $0.66$. Given\na fixed value of $\\alpha_{CR}$, we derive the upper limits of synchrotron\nemission induced by dark matter annihilation at different radio frequencies.\nLarger value of $\\alpha_{CR}$ represents for a harder $e^+/e^-$ spectrum from\ncosmic rays, which leads to a smaller value of $\\alpha_{DM}$ and allow less\nsynchrotron emission resulted from dark matter annihilation in lower frequency.\nUnder the same assumption on the magnetic field, we find that the lower the\nfrequency, the stronger the restriction on DM parameter space. Meanwhile, as\nthe peak frequency of synchrotron radiation decrease with the energy of\n$e^+/e^-$, constraints on DM properties obtained from lower frequency are more\nsevere in the case of DM with lower mass. Future low-frequency radio survey\nshould be considered a promising and powerful way to constrain DM.",

We propose to develop a soundness\nbenchmark for NN verification. Our benchmark contains instances with\ndeliberately inserted counterexamples while we also try to hide the\ncounterexamples from regular adversarial attacks which can be used for finding\ncounterexamples. We design a training method to produce neural networks with\nsuch hidden counterexamples. Our benchmark aims to be used for testing the\nsoundness of NN verifiers and identifying falsely claimed verifiability when it\nis known that hidden counterexamples exist. We systematically construct our\nbenchmark and generate instances across diverse model architectures, activation\nfunctions, input sizes, and perturbation radii. We demonstrate that our\nbenchmark successfully identifies bugs in state-of-the-art NN verifiers, as\nwell as synthetic bugs, providing a crucial step toward enhancing the\nreliability of testing NN verifiers.

Conventional\nstructure-guidance models like ControlNet, are limited as they rely solely on\ntext prompts to control appearance and cannot utilize exemplar images as input.\nRecent tuning-free approaches address this by transferring local appearance via\nimplicit cross-image matching in the augmented self-attention mechanism of\npre-trained diffusion models. However, prior works are often restricted to\nsingle-object cases or foreground object appearance transfer, struggling with\ncomplex scenes involving multiple objects. To overcome this, we propose\nAM-Adapter (Appearance Matching Adapter) to address exemplar-based semantic\nimage synthesis in-the-wild, enabling multi-object appearance transfer from a\nsingle scene-level image. AM-Adapter automatically transfers local appearances\nfrom the scene-level input. AM-Adapter alternatively provides controllability\nto map user-defined object details to specific locations in the synthesized\nimages. Our learnable framework enhances cross-image matching within augmented\nself-attention by integrating semantic information from segmentation maps. To\ndisentangle generation and matching, we adopt stage-wise training. We first\ntrain the structure-guidance and generation networks, followed by training the\nmatching adapter while keeping the others frozen. During inference, we\nintroduce an automated exemplar retrieval method for selecting exemplar\nimage-segmentation pairs efficiently. Despite utilizing minimal learnable\nparameters, AM-Adapter achieves state-of-the-art performance, excelling in both\nsemantic alignment and local appearance fidelity.

    "abstract": "Making multi-camera visual SLAM systems easier to set up and more robust to\nthe environment is attractive for vision robots. Existing monocular and\nbinocular vision SLAM systems have narrow sensing Field-of-View (FoV),\nresulting in degenerated accuracy and limited robustness in textureless\nenvironments. Thus multi-camera SLAM systems are gaining attention because they\ncan provide redundancy with much wider FoV. However, the usual arbitrary\nplacement and orientation of multiple cameras make the pose scale estimation\nand system updating challenging. To address these problems, we propose a robust\nvisual odometry system for rigidly-bundled arbitrarily-arranged multi-cameras,\nnamely MCVO, which can achieve metric-scale state estimation with high\nflexibility in the cameras' arrangement. Specifically, we first design a\nlearning-based feature tracking framework to shift the pressure of CPU\nprocessing of multiple video streams to GPU. Then we initialize the odometry\nsystem with the metric-scale poses under the rigid constraints between moving\ncameras. Finally, we fuse the features of the multi-cameras in the back-end to\nachieve robust pose estimation and online scale optimization. Additionally,\nmulti-camera features help improve the loop detection for pose graph\noptimization. Experiments on KITTI-360 and MultiCamData datasets validate its\nrobustness over arbitrarily arranged cameras. Compared with other stereo and\nmulti-camera visual SLAM systems, our method obtains higher pose accuracy with\nbetter generalization ability.

We aim to determine the\nphysical emission and loss processes causing radio SED curvature and steepening\nto see which observed global astrophysical properties are correlated with radio\nSED complexity. We have acquired radio continuum data between 70 MHz and 17 GHz\nfor a sample of 19 southern local (z < 0.04) SFGs. Of this sample 11 are\nselected to contain low-frequency (< 300 MHz) turnovers (LFTOs) in their SEDs\nand eight are control galaxies with similar global properties. We model the\nradio SEDs for our sample using a Bayesian framework whereby radio emission\n(synchrotron and free-free) and absorption or loss processes are included\nmodularly. We find that without the inclusion of higher frequency data, single\nsynchrotron power-law based models are always preferred for our sample;\nhowever, additional processes including free-free absorption (FFA) and\nsynchrotron losses are often required to accurately model radio SED complexity\nin SFGs. The fitted synchrotron spectral indices range from -0.45 to -1.07 and\nare strongly anticorrelated with stellar mass suggesting that synchrotron\nlosses are the dominant mechanism acting to steepen the spectral index in\nlarger nearby SFGs. We find that LFTOs in the radio SED are independent from\nthe inclination. The merging systems in our SFG sample have elevated specific\nstar formation rates and flatter fitted spectral indices with unconstrained\nLFTOs. Lastly, we find no significant separation in global properties between\nSFGs with or without modelled LFTOs. Overall LFTOs are likely caused by a\ncombination of FFA and ionisation losses in individual recent starburst regions\nwith specific orientations and interstellar medium properties that, when\naveraged over the entire galaxy, do not correlate with global astrophysical\nproperties.",

Recent\nefforts attempted to enhance generalization by improving the visual feature\nencoding for diffusion policy. However, their generalization is typically\nlimited to the same category with similar appearances. Our key insight is that\nleveraging affordances--manipulation priors that define \"where\" and \"how\" an\nagent interacts with an object--can substantially enhance generalization to\nentirely unseen object instances and categories. We introduce the Diffusion\nPolicy with transferable Affordance (AffordDP), designed for generalizable\nmanipulation across novel categories. AffordDP models affordances through 3D\ncontact points and post-contact trajectories, capturing the essential static\nand dynamic information for complex tasks. The transferable affordance from\nin-domain data to unseen objects is achieved by estimating a 6D transformation\nmatrix using foundational vision models and point cloud registration\ntechniques. More importantly, we incorporate affordance guidance during\ndiffusion sampling that can refine action sequence generation. This guidance\ndirects the generated action to gradually move towards the desired manipulation\nfor unseen objects while keeping the generated action within the manifold of\naction space. Experimental results from both simulated and real-world\nenvironments demonstrate that AffordDP consistently outperforms previous\ndiffusion-based methods, successfully generalizing to unseen instances and\ncategories where others fail.",

    "abstract": "Impact flashes on the moon are caused by high-speed collisions of celestial\nbodies with the lunar surface. The study of the impacts is critical for\nexploring the evolutionary history and formation of the Moon, and for\nquantifying the risk posed by the impacts to future human activity. Although\nthe impacts have been monitored from the Earth by a few projects in past 20\nyears, the events occurring on the lunar far side have not been explored\nsystematically so far. We here present an end-to-end image simulator dedicated\nto detecting and monitoring the impacts from space, which is useful for future\nmission design. The simulator is designed for modularity and developed in the\nPython environment, which is mainly composed of four components: the flash\ntemporal radiation, the background emission, the telescope and the detector\nused to collect and measure the radiation. Briefly speaking, with a set of\ninput parameters, the simulator calculates the flash radiation in the context\nof the spherical droplet model and the background emission from the lunar\nsurface. The resulting images are then generated by the simulator after\nconsidering a series observational effects, including the stray light,\ntransmission of the instrument, point spread function and multiple kinds of\nnoise caused by a CCD/CMOS detector. The simulator is validated by comparing\nthe calculation with the observations taken on the ground. The modular design\nenables the simulator to be improved and enhanced by including more complex\nphysical models in the future, and to be flexible for other future space\nmissions.",

In metals, intraband collective response\nmanifested by negative permittivity leads to plasmon-polaritons with extreme\nfield confinement, wavelength squeezing, and potentially low propagation\nlosses. In contrast, photons in semiconductors commonly couple to interband\ncollective response in the form of exciton polaritons, which give rise to\ncompletely different polaritonic properties, described by a superposition of\nthe photon and exciton and an anti-crossing of the eigenstates. In this work,\nwe identify the existence of plasmon-like collective excitations originating\nfrom the interband excitonic response of biased bilayer and trilayer graphene,\nin the form of graphene-exciton-polaritons (GEPs). We find that GEPs possess\nelectrically tunable polaritonic properties and discover that such excitations\nfollow a universal dispersion law for all surface polaritons in 2D excitonic\nsystems. Accounting for nonlocal corrections to the excitonic response, we find\nthat the GEPs exhibit confinement factors that can exceed those of graphene\nplasmons, and with moderate losses. These predictions of plasmon-like interband\ncollective excitations in biased graphene systems open up new research avenues\nfor tunable polaritonic phenomena based on excitonic systems, and the ability\nto control and manipulate such phenomena at the atomic scale.",

In this work, we proposed a\nbidirectional neural network model for the analysis and design of OTs with\noptical vortices (OVs) as a typical structured light beam. In analyzing optical\nforces, the network can achieve over 98% accuracy and improve computational\nefficiency by more than 20 times.

Meanwhile, in OTs with\nOV-like beams, our network can still predict particle motion behavior with a\nhigh accuracy of up to 96.2%. Our network can inversely design optical vortex\ntweezers on demand with 95.4% accuracy. In addition, the experimental results\nin OTs with plasmonic vortex can be analyzed by the proposed model, which can\nbe used to achieve arbitrary optical manipulation.

Offset noise has\nbeen proposed as an empirical solution to this issue, yet its theoretical basis\nremains insufficiently explored. In this paper, we propose a generalized\ndiffusion model that naturally incorporates additional noise within a rigorous\nprobabilistic framework. Our approach modifies both the forward and reverse\ndiffusion processes, enabling inputs to be diffused into Gaussian distributions\nwith arbitrary mean structures. We derive a loss function based on the evidence\nlower bound, establishing its theoretical equivalence to offset noise with\ncertain adjustments, while broadening its applicability.

State-of-the-art KV cache compression\ntechniques, such as quantization and pruning, apply uniform treatment to both\nkeys and values, and discard unimportant tokens entirely, overlooking the\nfine-grained distinctions in the significance of individual KV cache\ncomponents. To address such limitations, we introduce \\textit{DiffKV}, a novel\nframework for efficient KV cache compression that exploits three levels of\ndifferentiation in the KV cache: (1) the differing impact of keys and values on\nattention computation, (2) the varying importance of tokens, and (3) the\ndiverse dynamic sparsity patterns across attention heads. These levels of\ndifferentiation introduce irregular memory usage patterns across different\nrequests and attention heads, posing significant scalability challenges for\nmemory management. To address these challenges, DiffKV proposes an on-GPU\nmemory manager that compacts fragmented free memory list into contiguous\nregions in parallel, effectively translating sparsity in the KV cache into\nperformance gains. We evaluate DiffKV on several mainstream LLMs, including the\nemerging thinking models that generate extended chains of thought.

    "abstract": "The gradual guarantee is an important litmus test for gradually typed\nlanguages, that is, languages that enable a mixture of static and dynamic\ntyping. The gradual guarantee states that changing the precision of a type\nannotation does not change the behavior of the program, except perhaps to\ntrigger an error if the type annotation is incorrect. Siek et al. (2015) proved\nthat the Gradually Typed Lambda Calculus (GTLC) satisfies the gradual guarantee\nusing a simulation-based proof and mechanized their proof in Isabelle. In the\nfollowing decade, researchers have proved the gradual guarantee for more\nsophisticated calculi, using step-indexed logical relations. However, given the\ncomplexity of that style of proof, there has not yet been a mechanized proof of\nthe gradual guarantee using step-indexed logical relations. This paper reports\non a mechanized proof of the gradual guarantee for the GTLC carried out in the\nAgda proof assistant.",

We present ObjectFinder, an open-vocabulary wearable assistive system\nfor interactive object search by blind people. ObjectFinder allows users to\nquery target objects using flexible wording. Once the target object is\ndetected, it provides egocentric localization information in real-time,\nincluding distance and direction. Users can then initiate different branches to\ngather detailed information based on their intent towards the target object,\nsuch as navigating to it or perceiving its surroundings. ObjectFinder is\npowered by a seamless combination of open-vocabulary models, namely an\nopen-vocabulary object detector and a multimodal large language model. The\nObjectFinder design concept and its development were carried out in\ncollaboration with a blind co-designer. To evaluate ObjectFinder, we conducted\nan exploratory user study with eight blind participants. We compared\nObjectFinder to BeMyAI and Google Lookout, popular description- and\ndetection-based assistive applications.

This article describes non-linear magnetohydrodynamic\n(MHD) simulations of SPI in the ASDEX Upgrade tokamak to test the mitigation\nefficiency of different injection parameters for neon-doped deuterium pellets\nusing the JOREK code. The simulations are executed as fluid simulations, while\nadditional marker particles are used to evolve the charge state distribution\nand radiation property of impurities based on OpenADAS atomic data, i.e., a\ncollisional-radiative model is used. Neon fraction scans between 0 - 10% are\nperformed. Numerical results show that the thermal quench (TQ) occurs in two\nstages. In the first stage, approximately half of the thermal energy is\nabruptly lost, primarily through convective and conductive transport in the\nstochastic fields. This stage is relatively independent of the neon fraction.\nIn the second stage, where the majority of the remaining thermal energy is\nlost, radiation plays a dominant role. In case of pure deuterium injection,\nthis second stage may not occur at all. A larger fraction ($\\sim $20%) of the\ntotal material in the pellet is assimilated in the plasma for low neon fraction\npellets ($\\leq 0.12\\%$) due to the full thermal collapse of the plasma\noccurring later than in high neon fraction scenarios. Nevertheless, the total\nnumber of assimilated neon atoms increases with increasing neon fraction. The\neffects of fragment size and penetration speed are then numerically studied,\nshowing that slower and smaller fragments promote edge cooling and the\nformation of a cold front. Faster fragments result in shorter TQ duration and\nhigher assimilation as they reach the hotter plasma regions quicker.",

This paper introduces ChatTS, a novel MLLM designed for time\nseries analysis. ChatTS treats time series as a modality, similar to how vision\nMLLMs process images, enabling it to perform both understanding and reasoning\nwith time series. To address the scarcity of training data, we propose an\nattribute-based method for generating synthetic time series with detailed\nattribute descriptions. We further introduce Time Series Evol-Instruct, a novel\napproach that generates diverse time series Q&As, enhancing the model's\nreasoning capabilities.

We evaluate\nits performance using benchmark datasets with real-world data, including six\nalignment tasks and four reasoning tasks.

    "abstract": "Empathetic conversation is a crucial characteristic in daily conversations\nbetween individuals. Nowadays, Large Language models (LLMs) have shown\noutstanding performance in generating empathetic responses. Knowledge bases\nlike COMET can assist LLMs in mitigating illusions and enhancing the\nunderstanding of users' intentions and emotions. However, models remain heavily\nreliant on fixed knowledge bases and unrestricted incorporation of external\nknowledge can introduce noise. Tool learning is a flexible end-to-end approach\nthat assists LLMs in handling complex problems. In this paper, we propose\nEmotional Knowledge Tool Calling (EKTC) framework, which encapsulates the\ncommonsense knowledge bases as empathetic tools, enabling LLMs to integrate\nexternal knowledge flexibly through tool calling. In order to adapt the models\nto the new task, we construct a novel dataset TOOL-ED based on the\nEMPATHETICMPATHETIC DIALOGUE (ED) dataset. We validate EKTC on the ED dataset,\nand the experimental results demonstrate that our framework can enhance the\nability of LLMs to generate empathetic responses effectively.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly\nenhanced the ability of LLM-based systems to perform complex tasks through\nnatural language processing and tool interaction. However, optimizing these\nLLM-based systems for specific tasks remains challenging, often requiring\nmanual interventions like prompt engineering and hyperparameter tuning.\nExisting automatic optimization methods, such as textual feedback-based\ntechniques (e.g., TextGrad), tend to focus on immediate feedback, analogous to\nusing immediate derivatives in traditional numerical gradient descent. However,\nrelying solely on such feedback can be limited when the adjustments made in\nresponse to this feedback are either too small or fluctuate irregularly,\npotentially slowing down or even stalling the optimization process. To overcome\nthese challenges, more adaptive methods are needed, especially in situations\nwhere the system's response is evolving slowly or unpredictably. In this paper,\nwe introduce REVOLVE, an optimization method that tracks how \"R\"esponses\n\"EVOLVE\" across iterations in LLM systems. By focusing on the evolution of\nresponses over time, REVOLVE enables more stable and effective optimization by\nmaking thoughtful, progressive adjustments at each step. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that REVOLVE outperforms competitive baselines, achieving a 7.8%\nimprovement in prompt optimization, a 20.72% gain in solution refinement, and a\n29.17% increase in code optimization. Additionally, REVOLVE converges in fewer\niterations, resulting in significant computational savings. Beyond its\npractical contributions, REVOLVE highlights a promising direction, where the\nrich knowledge from established optimization principles can be leveraged to\nenhance LLM systems, which paves the way for further advancements in this\nhybrid domain.",

In this\nstudy, we propose a new deep learning architecture called TRINet that\nimplements time-decay attention to focus on recent mammographic screenings, as\ncurrent models do not account for the relevance of newer images. We integrate\nradiomic features with an Attention-based Multiple Instance Learning (AMIL)\nframework to weigh and combine multiple views for better risk estimation. In\naddition, we introduce a continual learning approach with a new label\nassignment strategy based on bilateral asymmetry to make the model more\nadaptable to asymmetrical cancer indicators. Finally, we add a time-embedded\nadditive hazard layer to perform dynamic, multi-year risk forecasting based on\nindividualized screening intervals. We used two public datasets, namely 8,528\npatients from the American EMBED dataset and 8,723 patients from the Swedish\nCSAW dataset in our experiments. Evaluation results on the EMBED test set show\nthat our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving\nAUC scores of 0.851, 0.811, 0.796, 0.793, and 0.789 across 1-, 2-, to 5-year\nintervals, respectively.

It is an inherent building\nblock in many applications such as voice assistant, speech translation, etc.\nDespite the advancement of ASR technologies in recent years, it is still\ninevitable for modern ASR systems to have a substantial number of erroneous\nrecognition due to environmental noise, ambiguity, etc. Therefore, the error\ncorrection in ASR is crucial.\n  Motivated by this, this paper studies ASR error correction in the Chinese\nlanguage, which is one of the most popular languages and enjoys a large number\nof users in the world. We first create a benchmark dataset named \\emph{ASR-EC}\nthat contains a wide spectrum of ASR errors generated by industry-grade ASR\nsystems. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first Chinese ASR error\ncorrection benchmark. Then, inspired by the recent advances in \\emph{large\nlanguage models (LLMs)}, we investigate how to harness the power of LLMs to\ncorrect ASR errors. We apply LLMs to ASR error correction in three paradigms.\nThe first paradigm is prompting, which is further categorized as zero-shot,\nfew-shot, and multi-step. The second paradigm is finetuning, which finetunes\nLLMs with ASR error correction data. The third paradigm is multi-modal\naugmentation, which collectively utilizes the audio and ASR transcripts for\nerror correction. Extensive experiments reveal that prompting is not effective\nfor ASR error correction. Finetuning is effective only for a portion of LLMs.\nMulti-modal augmentation is the most effective method for error correction and\nachieves state-of-the-art performance.",

Since each agent's reward is determined by the joint strategy, a\ngreedy learning strategy that aims to maximize its own reward may fall into a\nlocal optimum. Recent studies have proposed the opponent modeling and shaping\nmethods for game environments. These methods enhance the efficiency of strategy\nlearning by modeling the strategies and updating processes of other agents.\nHowever, these methods often rely on simple predictions of opponent strategy\nchanges. Due to the lack of modeling behavioral preferences such as cooperation\nand competition, they are usually applicable only to predefined scenarios and\nlack generalization capabilities. In this paper, we propose a novel\nPreference-based Opponent Shaping (PBOS) method to enhance the strategy\nlearning process by shaping agents' preferences towards cooperation. We\nintroduce the preference parameter, which is incorporated into the agent's loss\nfunction, thus allowing the agent to directly consider the opponent's loss\nfunction when updating the strategy. We update the preference parameters\nconcurrently with strategy learning to ensure that agents can adapt to any\ncooperative or competitive game environment.

It was shown earlier by the authors that,\ngiven any fixed direction $\\xi\\in \\partial G$, and under mild conditions on the\npassage time distribution, there exists almost surely a unique semi-infinite\nFPP geodesic from each $v\\in G$ to $\\xi$. Also, these geodesics coalesce to\nform a tree. Our main topic of study is the set of (random) exceptional\ndirections for which uniqueness or coalescence fails. We study these directions\nin the context of two random geodesics trees: one formed by the union of all\ngeodesics starting at a given base point, and the other formed by the union of\nall semi-infinite geodesics in a given direction $\\xi\\in \\partial G$. We show\nthat, under mild conditions, the set of exceptional directions almost surely\nhas a strictly smaller Hausdorff dimension than the boundary, and hence has\nmeasure zero with respect to the Patterson-Sullivan measure. We also establish\nan upper bound on the maximum number of disjoint geodesics in the same\ndirection. For groups that are not virtually free, we show that almost surely\nexceptional directions exist and are dense in $\\partial G$. When the\ntopological dimension of $\\partial G$ is greater than one, we establish the\nexistence of uncountably many exceptional directions. When the topological\ndimension of $\\partial G$ is $n$, we prove the existence of directions $\\xi$\nwith at least $(n+1)$ disjoint geodesics. Our results hinge on deep facts about\nhyperbolic groups. En route, we also establish facts about the structure of\nrandom bigeodesics that substantially strengthen prior results.",

As its applications expand, the\ntechnology faces mounting security challenges: sensing systems can be attack\ntargets, signals can be weaponized, or signals can function as security\nshields. Despite these security concerns significantly impacting the\ntechnology's development, a systematic review remains lacking. This paper\npresents the first comprehensive survey of wireless sensing security through a\nrole-based perspective. Analyzing over 200 publications from 2020-2024, we\npropose a novel classification framework that systematically categorizes\nexisting research into three main classes: (1) wireless systems as victims of\nattacks, (2) wireless signals as weapons for attacks, and (3) wireless signals\nas shields for security applications.

Through systematic\nliterature review and quantitative analysis, this paper outlines a panoramic\nview of wireless sensing security, revealing key technological trends and\ninnovation opportunities, thereby helping to promote the development of this\nfield.

Among different pre-training\nparadigms, differentiable-rendering-based methods have shown most promise.\nHowever, existing works separately conduct pre-training for each modalities due\nto computational costs of processing large point clouds with images. As such,\nmutual benefit of high-level semantics (from image) and 3D structure (from\npoint cloud) has not been exploited. To address this gap, we propose a joint\nunsupervised differentiable-rendering-based pre-training method for images and\npoint clouds, termed CLAP, short for Curvature sampLing and leArnable\nPrototype. Specifically, our method overcomes the computational hurdle by\nCurvature Sampling to select the more informative points/pixels for\npre-training. To uncover the performance benefits brought by their\ncomplementarity, we propose to use learnable prototypes to represent parts of\nthe 3D scenes in a common feature space and an Expectation-Maximization\ntraining scheme to associate embeddings of each modality to prototypes. We\nfurther propose a swapping prediction loss that explores their interplay\nthrough prototypes along with a Gram Matrix Regularization term to maintain\ntraining stability. Experiments on NuScenes and Waymo datasets show that CLAP\nachieves up to 100% more performance gain as compared to previous SOTA\npre-training methods. Codes and models will be released.",

Unmanned\naerial vehicles (UAVs) can improve inspection efficiency. However, the data\ntransmission delay in the existing cloud-only (CO) artificial intelligence (AI)\nmode fails to meet the low latency requirements for real-time performance.\nTherefore, we propose a computer vision-based AI of Things (AIoT) system to\ndetect antenna interference sources for UAVs.

At the core of our approach is an end-to-end\nantenna localization scheme based on the tracking-by-detection (TBD) paradigm,\nincluding a detector (EdgeAnt) and a tracker (AntSort). EdgeAnt achieves\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with a mean average precision (mAP) of\n42.1% on our custom antenna interference source dataset, requiring only 3\nmillion parameters and 14.7 GFLOPs.

To our best\nknowledge, TREND is the first work on temporal forecasting for unsupervised 3D\nrepresentation learning. We evaluate TREND on downstream 3D object detection\ntasks on popular datasets, including NuScenes, Once and Waymo. Experiment\nresults show that TREND brings up to 90% more improvement as compared to\nprevious SOTA unsupervised 3D pre-training methods and generally improve\ndifferent downstream models across datasets, demonstrating that indeed temporal\nforecasting brings improvement for LiDAR perception. Codes and models will be\nreleased.",

Noninvasive HbA1c measurement reduces both the pain and complications\nassociated with fingertip piercing to collect blood. Photoplethysmography is\nhelpful for measuring HbA1c without blood samples. Herein, only two wavelengths\n(615 and 525 nm) were used to estimate HbA1c noninvasively, where two different\nratio calibrations were applied and performances were compared to a work that\nuses three wavelengths. For the fingertip type, the Pearson r values for HbA1c\nestimates are 0.896 and 0.905 considering ratio calibrations for blood vessel\nand whole finger models, respectively. Using another value (HbA1c) calibration\nin addition to ratio calibrations, we can improve this performance, such that\nthe Pearson r values of HbA1c levels are 0.929 and 0.930 for blood vessel and\nwhole finger models, respectively. In the previous study using three\nwavelengths, the Pearson r values were 0.916 and 0.959 for the blood-vessel and\nwhole-finger models, respectively. Here, the RCF of SpO2 estimation is 0.986\nwhen SpO2 ratio calibration is applied, while in the previous study, the RCF\nvalues of SpO2 estimation were 0.983 and 0.986 for the blood-vessel and whole\nfinger models, respectively. Thus, we show that HbA1c estimation using only two\nwavelengths has comparable performance to previous studies.",

In view of this, we present a novel stealthy\nand efficient adversarial attack method for DRL-based autonomous driving\npolicies. Specifically, we introduce a DRL-based adversary designed to trigger\nsafety violations (e.g., collisions) by injecting adversarial samples at\ncritical moments. We model the attack as a mixed-integer optimization problem\nand formulate it as a Markov decision process. Then, we train the adversary to\nlearn the optimal policy for attacking at critical moments without domain\nknowledge. Furthermore, we introduce attack-related information and a\ntrajectory clipping method to enhance the learning capability of the adversary.\nFinally, we validate our method in an unprotected left-turn scenario across\ndifferent traffic densities. The experimental results show that our method\nachieves more than 90% collision rate within three attacks in most cases.\nFurthermore, our method achieves more than 130% improvement in attack\nefficiency compared to the unlimited attack method.",

For the\nportfolio interpolation method, we theoretically prove that the risk can be\nperfectly controlled if the to-be-set risk level is in a proper interval. In\naddition, we also show that the return rate of the adjusted portfolio after\nportfolio interpolation is no less than that of the min-variance optimization,\nas long as the model in the reward maximization phase is effective.\nFurthermore, the portfolio improvement method can achieve greater return rates\nwhile keeping the same risk level compared to portfolio interpolation.\nExtensive experiments are conducted on three real-world datasets.

Astronomical observations\nare inevitably noisy; however, the density of a noise-free feature is often the\ndesired outcome. The extreme-deconvolution (XD) method can be used to\ndeconvolve the noise and obtain noise-free density estimates by fitting a\nmixture of Gaussians to data where each sample has non-identical\n(heteroscedastic) Gaussian noise. However, XD does not generalize to cases\nwhere some feature dimensions have highly non-Gaussian distribution, and no\nestablished method exists to overcome this limitation.

The result\nis the CondXD algorithm, a generalization of XD that performs noise-free\nconditional density estimation. We apply CondXD to a toy model and find that it\nis more accurate than other approaches.

This\napproach incorporates a latent variable indicator within a base classifier\ninstead of probability sampling to detect noisy samples effectively. To\nvalidate our proposed method, we conducted experiments on both simulated and\nreal time-series ScRNA-seq datasets. Cross-validation experiments with\ndifferent artificial mislabeling rates demonstrate that ScPace outperforms\nprevious approaches. Furthermore, after calibrating the timestamps of the\noriginal time-series ScRNA-seq data using our method, we performed supervised\npseudotime analysis, revealing that ScPace enhances its performance\nsignificantly. These findings suggest that ScPace is an effective tool for\ntimestamp calibration by enabling reclassification and deletion of detected\nnoisy labeled samples while maintaining robustness across diverse ranges of\ntime-series ScRNA-seq datasets.

    "abstract": "Spatial transcriptomics (ST) is an emerging technology that enables medical\ncomputer vision scientists to automatically interpret the molecular profiles\nunderlying morphological features. Currently, however, most deep learning-based\nST analyses are limited to two-dimensional (2D) sections, which can introduce\ndiagnostic errors due to the heterogeneity of pathological tissues across 3D\nsections. Expanding ST to three-dimensional (3D) volumes is challenging due to\nthe prohibitive costs; a 2D ST acquisition already costs over 50 times more\nthan whole slide imaging (WSI), and a full 3D volume with 10 sections can be an\norder of magnitude more expensive. To reduce costs, scientists have attempted\nto predict ST data directly from WSI without performing actual ST acquisition.\nHowever, these methods typically yield unsatisfying results. To address this,\nwe introduce a novel problem setting: 3D ST imputation using 3D WSI histology\nsections combined with a single 2D ST slide. To do so, we present the\nAnatomy-aware Spatial Imputation Graph Network (ASIGN) for more precise, yet\naffordable, 3D ST modeling. The ASIGN architecture extends existing 2D spatial\nrelationships into 3D by leveraging cross-layer overlap and similarity-based\nexpansion. Moreover, a multi-level spatial attention graph network integrates\nfeatures comprehensively across different data sources. We evaluated ASIGN on\nthree public spatial transcriptomics datasets, with experimental results\ndemonstrating that ASIGN achieves state-of-the-art performance on both 2D and\n3D scenarios.

In our study, we adopt a different approach\nby profiling texts spanning four domains based on 250 distinct linguistic\nfeatures.

Our analyses reveal significant\ndifferences between human-written texts and those generated by LLMs,\nparticularly in the variability of these features, which we find to be\nconsiderably higher in human-written texts. This discrepancy is especially\nevident in text genres with less rigid linguistic style constraints.

    "abstract": "The broadcast model is widely used to describe the process of information\ndissemination from a single node to all nodes within an interconnected network.\nIn this model, a graph represents the network, where vertices correspond to\nnodes and edges to communication links. The efficiency of this broadcasting\nprocess is evaluated by the broadcast time, the minimum discrete time units\nrequired to broadcast from a given vertex. Determining the broadcast time is\nreferred to as the problem Broadcast Time. The set of vertices with the minimum\nbroadcast time among the graph is called the broadcast center. Identifying this\ncenter or determining its size are both proven to be NP-hard. For a graph with\nn vertices, the minimum broadcast time is at least ceil(log2 n). The Broadcast\nGraph problem asks in a graph of n vertices, whether the broadcast time from\nany vertex equals ceil(log2 n). Extensive research over the past 50 years has\nfocused on constructing broadcast graphs, which are optimal network topologies\nfor one-to-all communication efficiency. However, the computational complexity\nof the Broadcast Graph problem has rarely been the subject of study. We believe\nthat the difficulty lies in the mapping reduction for an NP-completeness proof.\nConsequently, we must construct broadcast graphs for yes-instances and\nnon-broadcast graphs for no-instances. The most closely related result is the\nNP-completeness of Broadcast Time proved by Slater et al. in 1981. More\nrecently, Fomin et al. has proved that Broadcast Time is fixed-parameter\ntractable. In this paper, we prove that Broadcast Graph is NP-complete by\nproving a reduction from Broadcast Time. We also improve the results on the\ncomplexity of the broadcast center problem. We show Broadcast Center Size is in\ndelta^2_p, and is DP-hard, implying a complexity upper bound of\ndelta^2_p-complete and a lower bound of DP-hard.",

Specifically, we focus on the problem of how to\ncoordinate the floating base and the robotic arm of a wheeled-quadrupedal\nmanipulator robot to achieve direct six-dimensional (6D) end-effector (EE) pose\ntracking in task space. Different from conventional whole-body\nloco-manipulation problems that track both floating-base and end-effector\ncommands, the direct EE pose tracking problem requires inherent balance among\nredundant degrees of freedom in the whole-body motion. We leverage RL to solve\nthis challenging problem. To address the associated difficulties, we develop a\nnovel reward fusion module (RFM) that systematically integrates reward terms\ncorresponding to different tasks in a nonlinear manner. In such a way, the\ninherent multi-stage and hierarchical feature of the loco-manipulation problem\ncan be carefully accommodated. By combining the proposed RFM with the a\nteacher-student RL training paradigm, we present a complete RL scheme to\nachieve 6D EE pose tracking for the wheeled-quadruped manipulator robot.\nExtensive simulation and hardware experiments demonstrate the significance of\nthe RFM. In particular, we enable smooth and precise tracking performance,\nachieving state-of-the-art tracking position error of less than 5 cm, and\nrotation error of less than 0.1 rad.

A significant gap\nremains between theoretical models and the magnetic reconnection occurring in\nreal astrophysical scenarios. In our previous work, we investigated the\ninfluence of orientation angle on energy extraction and figured out the\ndifferences between the plunging and circularly flowing bulk plasma. We\nintroduced the concept of covering factor to quantify the capability of an\naccretion system in extracting energy via magnetic reconnection from a rotating\nblack hole.

We\nemploy two reconnection models, in which the geometric index and the guide\nfield fraction are respectively induced. We separately present the dependences\nof energy extraction on the geometric index and the guide field fraction. More\nimportantly, we propose to define the averaged covering factor weighted by\nreconnection rate to quantify the overall capability of an accretion system in\nextracting energy via magnetic reconnection from a rotating black hole, under\nthe assumption that the magnetic reconnection process occurs stochastically and\nrandomly within the ergosphere.",

Concerns around their\nfairness have resulted in several bias mitigation techniques that emphasize the\nneed for high-quality data to ensure fairer decisions. However, the role of\nearlier stages of machine learning pipelines in mitigating model bias has not\nbeen explored well. In this paper, we focus on the task of acquiring additional\nlabeled data points for training the downstream machine learning model to\nrapidly improve its fairness. Since not all data points in a data pool are\nequally beneficial to the task of fairness, we generate an ordering in which\ndata points should be acquired. We present DataSift, a data acquisition\nframework based on the idea of data valuation that relies on partitioning and\nmulti-armed bandits to determine the most valuable data points to acquire. Over\nseveral iterations, DataSift selects a partition and randomly samples a batch\nof data points from the selected partition, evaluates the benefit of acquiring\nthe batch on model fairness, and updates the utility of partitions depending on\nthe benefit. To further improve the effectiveness and efficiency of evaluating\nbatches, we leverage influence functions that estimate the effect of acquiring\na batch without retraining the model.

This variability complicates the\ninterpretation of the data and understanding of the astrophysical phenomena\ninvolved.

Current approaches lack efficiency or\nconsistency, making it challenging to perform large-scale reanalyses with\nupdated models or improved techniques. It is imperative that investigations\ninto waveform systematics be reproducible. Frameworks like asimov can\nfacilitate large-scale reanalyses with consistent settings and high-quality\nresults, and can reliably show how different waveform models affect the\ninterpretation of gravitational wave events. This, in combination with other\nprovided tools, allow for reanalysis of several events from the GWTC-3 catalog.\nWe include access to full analysis settings that facilitate public use of GWOSC\ndata on the Open Science Grid, particularly those conducted with the\nIMRPhenomPv2, SEOBNRv4PHM, SEOBNRv5PHM, and NRSur7dq4 waveform models.

This paper introduces a novel point cloud registration method,\ni.e., QuadricsReg, which leverages concise quadrics primitives to represent\nscenes and utilizes their geometric characteristics to establish\ncorrespondences for 6-DoF transformation estimation. As a symbolic feature, the\nquadric representation fully captures the primary geometric characteristics of\nscenes, which can efficiently handle the complexity of large-scale point\nclouds. The intrinsic characteristics of quadrics, such as types and scales,\nare employed to initialize correspondences. Then we build a multi-level\ncompatibility graph set to find the correspondences using the maximum clique on\nthe geometric consistency between quadrics. Finally, we estimate the 6-DoF\ntransformation using the quadric correspondences, which is further optimized\nbased on the quadric degeneracy-aware distance in a factor graph, ensuring high\nregistration accuracy and robustness against degenerate structures. We test on\n5 public datasets and the self-collected heterogeneous dataset across different\nLiDAR sensors and robot platforms. The exceptional registration success rates\nand minimal registration errors demonstrate the effectiveness of QuadricsReg in\nlarge-scale point cloud registration scenarios. Furthermore, the real-world\nregistration testing on our self-collected heterogeneous dataset shows the\nrobustness and generalization ability of QuadricsReg on different LiDAR sensors\nand robot platforms.

By restricting states and the corresponding inputs in\ncontainers with free sizes and a fixed shape, feasible MDs, which are the\nproducts of model uncertainty with states and inputs, are restricted into\npolytopes with free sizes. Then, tubes with different centers and shapes are\nconstructed based on the nominal dynamics and the knowledge of AD and MD.

While the Koopman operator has been used for\ndata-driven modeling and control of nonlinear dynamics, it is challenging to\naccurately reconstruct unknown dynamics from data and perform different\ndecision-making tasks, mainly due to its infinite dimensionality and difficulty\nof finding invariant subspaces. We utilize ideas from a Bayesian\ninference-based model averaging technique to devise a data-driven method that\nfirst populates multiple Koopman models starting with a feature extraction\nusing neural networks and then computes point estimates of the posterior of\npredicted variables.

We present a\nbirthmark framework outlining a ubiquitous memory effect for an arbitrary,\nnon-stationary state composed of two factors conspiring together: the universal\nand revival-enhancement. The former sets the minimal amplification carried by\nthe time evolution of a quantum state based on global symmetries; whereas the\nlatter incorporates the further enhancement stemming from the early dynamics,\nparticularly prominent in the presence of recurrences occurring before the\nHeisenberg time. As a concrete example, we identify quantum birthmarks in the\nvenerable stadium billiard where they can be significantly enhanced by quantum\nscars.

The cold neutral medium (CNM) in the\nMilky Way is colder and more abundant at higher optical extinctions due to more\nintense cooling and shielding.

We propose to evaluate algorithms via the makeup of\nsynthetic data generated by each algorithm in terms of data quality, diversity,\nand complexity. We choose these three characteristics for their significance in\nopen-ended processes and the impact each has on the capabilities of downstream\nmodels. We find quality to be essential for in-distribution model\ngeneralization, diversity to be essential for out-of-distribution\ngeneralization, and complexity to be beneficial for both.

This analysis extends into a discussion on the importance\nof balancing QDC in synthetic data for efficient reinforcement learning and\nself-improvement algorithms. Analogous to the QD trade-offs in training data,\noften there exist trade-offs between model output quality and output diversity\nwhich impact the composition of synthetic data.

Throughout systematic spectral analysis using a two-component model\nconsisting of a multi-temperature accretion disk plus a fraction of its flux\nconvolved with an empirical Comptonized powerlaw component, we found that the\ninnermost radius ($r_{\\rm in}$) and temperature (Tin) of the disk are very\nvariable with time in the rising phase of soft X-ray flux where Type-A/B/C\nlow-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) were found. After this phase,\n$r_{\\rm in}$ remains constant at around 60 km assuming a distance of 8 kpc and\nan inclination angle of 67$^{\\circ}$, and Tin smoothly decays with time. The\nconstant $r_{\\rm in}$ suggests a presence of the innermost stable circular\norbit (ISCO), with $r_{\\rm in}$ repeatedly moving closer and farther away from\nthe ISCO in the rising phase. Both disk parameters are remarkably correlated\nwith independently analyzed timing properties such as QPO frequency and rms\nvariability. Type-A/B QPOs are seen only when $r_{\\rm in}$ is close to the\nISCO, while Type-C are seen when $r_{\\rm in}$ is truncated and the frequency\nchanges with a relation of $r^{-1.0}_{\\rm in}$, supporting that Type-C QPOs\noccur at the inner edge of the truncated disk. Accurate determinations of the\nfrequency--$r_{\\rm in}$ relation for various objects should be a powerful tool\nto discriminate plausible Type-C QPO models. Furthermore, we suggest that jet\nejection events may occur when $r_{\\rm in}$ rapidly approaches to the ISCO,\nalong with rapid changes of the disk flux, the rms variability and the hardness\nratio.

We introduce methods for determining whether an (existing or\nplanned) evaluation dataset has enough responses per item to reliably compare\nthe performance of one model to another. We apply our methods to several of\nvery few extant gold standard test sets with multiple disaggregated responses\nper item and show that there are usually not enough responses per item to\nreliably compare the performance of one model against another. Our methods also\nallow us to estimate the number of responses per item for hypothetical datasets\nwith similar response distributions to the existing datasets we study.

Combining this enhanced\nspin transparency with the large spin Hall angle of WTe2 explains the high\nspin-orbit torque efficiency observed experimentally.

The sequential denoising steps required for generating a single sample\ncould take tens or hundreds of iterations and thus have become a significant\nbottleneck. This limitation is more salient for applications that are\ninteractive in nature or require small latency. To address this challenge, we\npropose Partially Conditioned Patch Parallelism (PCPP) to accelerate the\ninference of high-resolution diffusion models. Using the fact that the\ndifference between the images in adjacent diffusion steps is nearly zero, Patch\nParallelism (PP) leverages multiple GPUs communicating asynchronously to\ncompute patches of an image in multiple computing devices based on the entire\nimage (all patches) in the previous diffusion step. PCPP develops PP to reduce\ncomputation in inference by conditioning only on parts of the neighboring\npatches in each diffusion step, which also decreases communication among\ncomputing devices. As a result, PCPP decreases the communication cost by around\n$70\\%$ compared to DistriFusion (the state of the art implementation of PP) and\nachieves $2.36\\sim 8.02\\times$ inference speed-up using $4\\sim 8$ GPUs compared\nto $2.32\\sim 6.71\\times$ achieved by DistriFusion depending on the computing\ndevice configuration and resolution of generation at the cost of a possible\ndecrease in image quality.

This approach enables\nthe model to quickly learn simpler knowledge and progressively acquire more\ncomplex knowledge, thereby improving performance incrementally. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance\nacross all baselines. Additionally, we provide detailed ablation studies to\nvalidate the effectiveness of CDA.",

However, its nonlinear counterpart has\nnot yet been discovered. Here, we report the observation of the nonlinear\nEdelstein effect in few-layer WTe2. Under a current bias, an out-of-plane\nmagnetization is induced in WTe2, which is electrically probed using an\nFe3GeTe2 electrode, a van der Waals ferromagnet with perpendicular magnetic\nanisotropy. Notably, with an applied ac at frequency {\\omega}, an induced\nmagnetization with second-harmonic response at frequency 2{\\omega} is observed,\nand its magnitude demonstrates a quadratic dependence on the applied current,\ncharacteristic of the nonlinear Edelstein effect. This phenomenon is well\nexplained by the current-induced orbital magnetization via the Berry connection\npolarizability tensors in WTe2. The orbital degree of freedom plays the primary\nrole in the observed nonlinear Edelstein effect, that is, the nonlinear orbital\nEdelstein effect. This can, in turn, give rise to a nonlinear spin Edelstein\neffect through spin-orbit coupling.",

This is achieved by applying a direct\ncurrent Idc and an alternating current Iac (Iac<<Idc) in TaIrTe4, where the\nformer induces time-reversal symmetry breaking and the latter probes the\ntriggered AHE. The anomalous Hall resistance VacH/Iac shows a linear dependence\non Idc and changes sign with the polarity of Idc. In temperature-dependent\nmeasurements, VacH/Iac also experiences a sign reversal at 100 K, consistent\nwith the temperature-dependent nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE). Furthermore, in\nmeasurements involving only dc transport, the dc Hall voltage exhibits a\nquadratic relationship with Idc. When the Idc direction is reversed, the Hall\nresistance changes sign, demonstrating a colossal nonreciprocal Hall effect\n(NRHE).

In addition to\nthese, European immigrants introduced sheep into the ecosystem. Together, these\nthree species form a straightforward trophic network, featuring one predator\nand two prey species, all competing within the Patagonian steppe. For ranchers,\nguanacos and pumas are frequently perceived as threats to their economic\ninterests. In recent decades, the field of biology, particularly ecology, has\nwitnessed a substantial increase in the development of equation-based models.\nScientists are interested in the ability to systematize hypotheses and gain\ninsights into the behavior of complex biological systems, such as the one\npresented in this study. However, the nonlinear nature and the large number of\nparameters of models, represent a challenge when one wants to explore the\nparameter space. To overcome this and, at the same time, improve the\nunderstanding of the Patagonia ecosystem, we start by building an\nequation-based model based on previous contributions, and we reduce it to the\nessential minimum set of parameters. Then, we introduce two tools, a\ngeneralization of ternary graphs and a perceptron based ML, to help understand\nthe response of the system equation to the key parameters. The perceptron tool\nallows us to visualize/interpret the influence of each parameter on the\nsurvival or extinction of each species.

The\ndifferentially private federated recommender (DPFR) further enhances FR by\ninjecting differentially private (DP) noises into clients. Yet, current DPFRs,\nsuffering from noise distortion, cannot achieve satisfactory accuracy. Various\nefforts have been dedicated to improving DPFRs by adaptively allocating the\nprivacy budget over the learning process.

In the\npresence of a strong magnetic field, the energy levels of electrons and protons\nare quantized and the Direct Urca process allows neutron stars to cool rapidly,\neven at low density. For the case of magnetic fields $B \\geq 10^{16}\\,\\rm G$,\nwe find features in the emissivity due to energy quantization that are not\ncaptured by the frequently employed quasiclassical approximation where energy\nlevels are treated as nearly continuous. Resonances can result in amplification\nof the neutrino emissivity at specific densities compared to a calculation that\nneglects quantization, particularly at low temperature. These effects are not\nimportant for the thermal evolution of an entire neutron star, but may be\nrelevant for phenomena that depend on behavior at specific densities. We\npresent a fully relativistic calculation of the Direct Urca rate in a strong\nmagnetic field using the standard V-A weak Lagrangian incorporating mean field\nnuclear effects and discuss approaches to the numerical challenge the modified\nwavefunctions present and a new semi-analytic approximation. These tools are\nalso applicable to calculating neutrino opacities in strong magnetic fields in\nthe ejecta of binary neutron star mergers. We calculate the opacities for\nneutrinos capturing on free nucleons at sub-saturation densities and\ntemperatures exceeding an MeV. We find an enhancement to capture processes of\nthe lowest energy neutrinos by an order of magnitude or more due to suppression\nof electron Pauli blocking in the case of capture on neutrons, and from the\neffect of the nucleon magnetic moments in the case of capture on protons.",

    "abstract": "Accurate prediction over long time horizons is crucial for modeling complex\nphysical processes such as wave propagation. Although deep neural networks show\npromise for real-time forecasting, they often struggle with accumulating phase\nand amplitude errors as predictions extend over a long period. To address this\nissue, we propose a novel loss decomposition strategy that breaks down the loss\ninto separate phase and amplitude components. This technique improves the\nlong-term prediction accuracy of neural networks in wave propagation tasks by\nexplicitly accounting for numerical errors, improving stability, and reducing\nerror accumulation over extended forecasts.",

Next, with the aid of the optimal inequality, we classify the\nexistence of ground states to stationary MFGs with Hartree-type coupling in\nterms of the $L^1$-norm of population density defined by $M$. In addition,\nunder certain types of coercive potentials, the asymptotics of ground states to\nergodic MFGs with the nonlocal coupling are captured.

We consider the use of tunable external driving lasers to transfer\nthe system from a coherent spin state to a highly degenerate DFS. We find that\nthe typical state in the DFS is highly entangled.

    "abstract": "The remarkable success of deep learning methods in solving computer vision\nproblems, such as image classification, object detection, scene understanding,\nimage segmentation, etc., has paved the way for their application in biomedical\nimaging. One such application is in the field of CT image denoising, whereby\ndeep learning methods are proposed to recover denoised images from noisy images\nacquired at low radiation. Outputs derived from applying deep learning\ndenoising algorithms may appear clean and visually pleasing; however, the\nunderlying diagnostic image quality may not be on par with their normal-dose CT\ncounterparts. In this work, we assessed the image quality of deep learning\ndenoising algorithms by making use of visual perception- and data\nfidelity-based task-agnostic metrics (like the PSNR and the SSIM) - commonly\nused in the computer vision - and a task-based detectability assessment (the\nLCD) - extensively used in the CT imaging. When compared against normal-dose CT\nimages, the deep learning denoisers outperformed low-dose CT based on metrics\nlike the PSNR (by 2.4 to 3.8 dB) and SSIM (by 0.05 to 0.11). However, based on\nthe LCD performance, the detectability using quarter-dose denoised outputs was\ninferior to that obtained using normal-dose CT scans.",

In this paper, we propose Higher-Order\nTransformers (HOT), a novel architecture designed to efficiently process data\nwith more than two axes, i.e. higher-order tensors. To address the\ncomputational challenges associated with high-order tensor attention, we\nintroduce a novel Kronecker factorized attention mechanism that reduces the\nattention cost to quadratic in each axis' dimension, rather than quadratic in\nthe total size of the input tensor. To further enhance efficiency, HOT\nleverages kernelized attention, reducing the complexity to linear. This\nstrategy maintains the model's expressiveness while enabling scalable attention\ncomputation. We validate the effectiveness of HOT on two high-dimensional\ntasks, including multivariate time series forecasting, and 3D medical image\nclassification. Experimental results demonstrate that HOT achieves competitive\nperformance while significantly improving computational efficiency, showcasing\nits potential for tackling a wide range of complex, multi-dimensional data.",

    "abstract": "The probability distribution for vacuum fluctuations of the energy flux in\ntwo dimensions will be constructed, along with the joint distribution of energy\nflux and energy density. Our approach will be based on previous work on\nprobability distributions for the energy density in two dimensional conformal\nfield theory. In both cases, the relevant stress tensor component must be\naveraged in time, and the results are sensitive to the form of the averaging\nfunction. Here we present results for two classes of such functions, which\ninclude the Gaussian and Lorentzian functions. The distribution for the energy\nflux is symmetric, unlike that for the energy density. In both cases, the\ndistribution may possess an integrable singularity. The functional form of the\nflux distribution function involves a modified Bessel function, and is distinct\nfrom the shifted Gamma form for the energy density. By considering the joint\ndistribution of energy flux and energy density, we show that the distribution\nof energy flux tends to be more centrally concentrated than that of the energy\ndensity. We also determine the distribution of energy fluxes, conditioned on\nthe energy density being negative. Some applications of the results will be\ndiscussed.",
