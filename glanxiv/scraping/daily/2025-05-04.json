We prove that sound waves interact with particles of\nnearby velocities, which results in a damping or an amplification of these\nsound waves, depending on the sign of the derivative of the distribution\nfunction at the sound speed. This mechanism is very similar to the classical\nLandau damping which occurs in the Vlasov-Poisson system. If the sound waves\nare amplified then the thick spray model is linearly ill-posed in Sobolev\nspaces, even locally in time.\n  We also show that such Landau damping type phenomena naturally arise when we\ncouple an hyperbolic system of conservation laws with the Vlasov equation.",

To bridge the gap between text and audio, we leverage code as\nan intermediary, prompting LLMs to generate code that, when executed, produces\nthe desired audio output. To evaluate the quality and accuracy of the generated\naudio, we employ FAD and CLAP scores. Our findings reveal that while LLMs can\ngenerate basic audio features, their performance deteriorates as the complexity\nof the audio increases. This suggests that while LLMs possess a latent\nunderstanding of the auditory world, their ability to translate this\nunderstanding into tangible audio output remains rudimentary.

    "abstract": "Preventing collisions in multi-robot navigation is crucial for deployment.\nThis requirement hinders the use of learning-based approaches, such as\nmulti-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), on their own due to their lack of\nsafety guarantees. Traditional control methods, such as reachability and\ncontrol barrier functions, can provide rigorous safety guarantees when\ninteractions are limited only to a small number of robots. However, conflicts\nbetween the constraints faced by different agents pose a challenge to safe\nmulti-agent coordination.\n  To overcome this challenge, we propose a method that integrates multiple\nlayers of safety by combining MARL with safety filters. First, MARL is used to\nlearn strategies that minimize multiple agent interactions, where multiple\nindicates more than two. Particularly, we focus on interactions likely to\nresult in conflicting constraints within the engagement distance. Next, for\nagents that enter the engagement distance, we prioritize pairs requiring the\nmost urgent corrective actions. Finally, a dedicated safety filter provides\ntactical corrective actions to resolve these conflicts. Crucially, the design\ndecisions for all layers of this framework are grounded in reachability\nanalysis and a control barrier-value function-based filtering mechanism.\n  We validate our Layered Safe MARL framework in 1) hardware experiments using\nCrazyflie drones and 2) high-density advanced aerial mobility (AAM) operation\nscenarios, where agents navigate to designated waypoints while avoiding\ncollisions. The results show that our method significantly reduces conflict\nwhile maintaining safety without sacrificing much efficiency (i.e., shorter\ntravel time and distance) compared to baselines that do not incorporate layered\nsafety.

For the constrained problem, we introduce the new notion of\nproximal-quasar-convexity and prove analogous results to the unconstrained\ncase. Specifically, we show the complexity bounds and the convergence of the\nalgorithm to a neighbourhood of a global minimum whose size can be controlled\nunder a variance reduction scheme. Theoretical findings are illustrated through\ninvestigating the performance of the algorithm applied to a range of problems\nin machine learning and optimisation. Specifically, we observe scenarios where\nthe ZO method outperforms gradient descent. We provide a possible explanation\nfor this phenomenon.",

For the first time, geometries beyond parallel plates in\n(3+1)D SU($N_c)$ are explored, and we show that the Casimir effect for the\nsymmetrical and asymmetrical tube and box is attractive. The result for the\ntube is contrary to the weakly coupled, massless non-interacting scalar field\ntheory result where a repulsive Casimir force, described by a negative slope of\nthe potential, is measured in this geometry. We propose various techniques that\ncan be used to account for the energy contributions from creating the\nboundaries in the geometry of a tube and box where the size of the faces\nforming the walls of the geometries changes with separation distance. We show\nthat increasing the temperature from a confined to a deconfined phase does not\nalter the measured potential and we motivate for this observation by showing\nthat the masses of the particles in the Casimir interactions are lower than the\nlowest glueball mass, $M_{0^{++}}$ in the pure gauge ground state, thus\nsuggesting that the region inside the geometries is a boundary-induced\ndeconfined phase. Through the measured expectation value of the Polyakov loop,\nwe propose that the Casimir effect for the asymmetrical tube in the large\nseparation distance limit $R\\to \\infty$ should be equivalent to that of the\nparallel plate geometry at smallest separation distance, while the asymmetrical\nbox in the same limit should be equivalent to the symmetrical tube at the\nsmallest separation distance.",

MCP provides a\nJSON-RPC client-server interface for secure tool invocation and typed data\nexchange.

Its lightweight and runtime-independent design enables scalable\nagent invocation, while features like session management, message routing, and\nintegration with role-based and decentralized identifiers (DIDs).

ANP\nsupports open network agent discovery and secure collaboration using W3C\ndecentralized identifiers DIDs and JSON-LD graphs. The protocols are compared\nacross multiple dimensions, including interaction modes, discovery mechanisms,\ncommunication patterns, and security models. Based on the comparative analysis,\na phased adoption roadmap is proposed: beginning with MCP for tool access,\nfollowed by ACP for structured, multimodal messaging session-aware interaction\nand both online and offline agent discovery across scalable, HTTP-based\ndeployments A2A for collaborative task execution, and extending to ANP for\ndecentralized agent marketplaces.

Inspired by fictitious domain methods,\nthis method employs a structured mesh to discretize the entire material domain\nwhile utilizing separate, independent meshes for the inclusions. These\ninclusion meshes are coupled to the structured mesh via a substitution matrix,\nenabling them to act as phantom meshes that do not directly contribute to the\nfinal system of equations. This framework offers significant advantages,\nincluding enhanced flexibility in handling complex inclusion geometries and\nimproved computational efficiency. To assess the accuracy and robustness of the\nproposed method, numerical experiments are conducted on structures containing\ninclusions of various geometries. In order to emphasize the efficiency of the\nPDFEM method, a numerical simulation is presented to highlight its advantages\nin the case of long natural fibers, such as flax and linen. These simulations\nare compared against FEM calculations, demonstrating the efficiency of PDFEM.\nIndeed, meshing such fine structures requires an extremely high number of\nelements, and in some cases, meshing becomes particularly challenging due to\nthe complexity of the geometries.",

    "abstract": "We propose a novel parametrization of Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT), as\ndeveloped by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, that yields an explicit gamble\nvaluation formula for Gaussian reward distributions. Specifically, we define\nparametric functions $ v_{\\theta} $, $ w^{-}_{\\theta} $, and $ w^{+}_{\\theta} $\nsatisfying three key properties. The first, \\emph{validity}, ensures that for\nany parameter $\\theta$, the functions conform to the qualitative principles of\nCPT: $ v_{\\theta} $ is concave over gains and convex over losses with a steeper\nslope for losses; $ w^{-}_{\\theta} $ and $ w^{+}_{\\theta} $ are increasing,\nexhibit inverse S-shaped curves, and map 0 to 0 and 1 to 1. The second,\n\\emph{richness}, guarantees that the parametrization is expressive enough to\ncapture a wide range of behaviors: $ v_{\\theta} $ can exhibit arbitrary\nasymptotic behavior and convergence rates, while $ w^{-}_{\\theta} $ and $\nw^{+}_{\\theta} $ can achieve any specified crossover points and slopes. The\nthird, \\emph{explicit valuation}, ensures that for any $\\theta$, the CPT\nvaluation of a Gaussian-distributed gamble (with arbitrary mean and variance)\ncan be computed in closed form -- enabling efficient approximations for\nbell-shaped reward distributions. This framework is designed for scalable and\nrapid computation, making it particularly suited for applications involving\nlarge populations.

    "abstract": "This paper demonstrates that values of work functions W for a variety of\nplanar and buckled two-dimensional (2D) materials scale linearly as a function\nof the quantity 1/r_{WS}, where r_{WS} is the Wigner-Seitz radius for a 2D\nmaterial. Simple procedures are prescribed for estimating r_{WS}. Using them,\nthis linear scaling relation, which is founded in electrostatics, provides a\nquick and easy method for calculating values of W from basic, readily available\nstructural information about the materials. These easily determined values of W\nare seen to be very accurate when compared to values from the literature. Those\nderive from experiment or from challenging, computationally intensive\ndensity-functional-theory calculations. Values from those sources also conform\nto the linear scaling rules. Since values of W predicted by the rules so\nclosely match known values of W, the simple scaling methods described here also\nare applied to predict W for 2D materials (TiN, BSb, SiGe, and GaP) for which\nno values have appeared previously in the literature.",

The principle states that almost any dendritic weights updated via\nheterosynaptic plasticity can implement a generalized and efficient class of\ngradient-based meta-learning. The theory suggests that a broad class of\nbiologically plausible learning algorithms, together with the standard machine\nlearning optimizers, can be grounded in heterosynaptic circuit motifs. This\nprinciple suggests that the phenomenology of (anti-) Hebbian (HBP) and\nheterosynaptic plasticity (HSP) may emerge from the same underlying dynamics,\nthus providing a unifying explanation. It also suggests an alternative\nperspective of neuroplasticity, where HSP is promoted to the primary learning\nand memory mechanism, and HBP is an emergent byproduct. We present simulations\nthat show that (a) HSP can explain the metaplasticity of neurons, (b) HSP can\nexplain the flexibility of the biology circuits, and (c) gradient learning can\narise quickly from simple evolutionary dynamics that do not compute any\nexplicit gradient. While our primary focus is on biology, the principle also\nimplies a new approach to designing AI training algorithms and physically\nlearnable AI hardware. Conceptually, our result demonstrates that contrary to\nthe common belief, gradient computation may be extremely easy and common in\nnature.",

Black holes\nare suspected to compress the surrounding dark matter distribution, forming a\n``spike''.

In the future, acceleration via\nquantum devices may complement GPUs for kernels where algorithms provide\nquantum advantage, i.e., significant speedups over classical algorithms.\nComputing with quantum kernels mapped onto quantum processing units (QPUs)\nrequires seamless integration into HPC and ML. However, quantum offloading onto\nHPC/cloud lacks open-source software infrastructure. For classical algorithms,\nparallelization standards, such as OpenMP, MPI, or CUDA exist. In contrast, a\nlack of quantum abstractions currently limits the adoption of quantum\nacceleration in practical applications creating a gap between quantum algorithm\ndevelopment and practical HPC integration. Such integration needs to extend to\nefficient quantum offloading of kernels, which further requires scheduling of\nquantum resources, control of QPU kernel execution, tracking of QPU results,\nproviding results to classical calling contexts and coordination with HPC\nscheduling. This work proposes CONQURE, a co-execution environment for quantum\nand classical resources.

We present SEval-Ex, a framework that bridges this gap by\ndecomposing summarization evaluation into atomic statements, enabling both high\nperformance and explainability. SEval-Ex employs a two-stage pipeline: first\nextracting atomic statements from text source and summary using LLM, then a\nmatching between generated statements. Unlike existing approaches that provide\nonly summary-level scores, our method generates detailed evidence for its\ndecisions through statement-level alignments. Experiments on the SummEval\nbenchmark demonstrate that SEval-Ex achieves state-of-the-art performance with\n0.580 correlation on consistency with human consistency judgments, surpassing\nGPT-4 based evaluators (0.521) while maintaining interpretability.

In the\npresence of short-range interactions, the non-interacting critical phase\ntransforms to a many-body critical (MBC) phase, separated by lines of\nMBC-ergodic, MBC-many-body localized (MBL) and ergodic-MBL phase transitions\nthat meet at a triple point. We elucidate the unusual characteristics of the\nMBC phase compared to the ergodic and MBL phases through the localization\nproperties of the excitations in real space and Fock space (FS), and eigenstate\ninverse participation ratio (IPR). We show that the MBC phase, like the MBL\nphase, is well described by a multifractal scaling of the IPR and a linear\nfinite-size scaling ansatz near the transition to the ergodic and MBL phases.\nHowever, the MBC phase, at the same time, exhibits delocalization of all\nsingle-particle excitations and a system-size dependent Fock-space localization\nlength, analogous to the ergodic phase. Remarkably, we find evidence of unusual\nWidom lines on the phase diagram in the form of lines of pronounced peaks or\ndips in the FS localization properties inside the MBC and MBL phases. These\nWidom lines either emerge as a continuation of the precursor phase transition\nline, terminating at the triple point, or originate from a phase boundary.",

The behavior of viscoelastic fluids near these\nsingularities is particularly intriguing - not only because of their added\ncomplexity, but also due to the unexpected responses they often exhibit. In\nparticular, experiments have shown that the coalescence of viscoelastic sessile\ndrops can differ significantly from their Newtonian counterparts, sometimes\nresulting in a sharply defined interface. However, the mechanisms driving these\ndifferences in dynamics, as well as the potential influence of the contact\nangle, remain largely qualitative or unknown. Here, we study two different flow\nregimes effectively induced by varying the contact angle and demonstrate how\nthat leads to markedly different coalescence behaviors. We show that the\ncoalescence dynamics is effectively unaltered by viscoelasticity at small\ncontact angles. The Deborah number, which is the ratio of the relaxation time\nof the polymer to the timescale of coalescence, scales as $\\theta^3$ for\n$\\theta \\ll 1$, thus rationalizing the near-Newtonian response. On the other\nhand, it has been shown previously that viscoelasticity alters the shape of the\ninterface during coalescence at large contact angles but does not affect the\ntemporal evolution of the shape. We study this large contact angle limit using\nexperiments and 2D numerical simulations of the equation of motion, using the\nOldroyd-B model for the constitutive representation. We show that the departure\nof the coalescence dynamics from the Newtonian case is a function of the\nDeborah number and the elastocapillary number.",

However, their\napproach was not only inefficient but also prone to side-channel attacks.\nTherefore, in this paper, we propose a new decision tree inference protocol in\nwhich the model is shared and evaluated among multiple entities. We partition\nour decision tree model by each level to be stored in a new entity we refer to\nas a \"level-site.\" Utilizing this approach, we were able to gain improved\naverage run time for classifier evaluation for a non-complete tree, while also\nhaving strong mitigations against side-channel attacks.",

    "abstract": "Grassroots Federation aims to address the egalitarian formation and the fair\ndemocratic governance of large-scale, decentralized, sovereign digital\ncommunities, the size of the EU, the US, existing social networks, and even\nhumanity at large. A grassroots federation evolves via the grassroots formation\nof digital communities and their consensual federation. Such digital\ncommunities may form according to geography, jurisdiction, affiliations,\nrelations, interests, causes, and more. Small communities (say up to $100$\nmembers) govern themselves; larger communities -- no matter how large -- are\ngoverned by a similarly-small assembly elected by sortition among its members.\n  Earlier work on Grassroots Democratic Federation explored the fair sortition\nof the assemblies of a federation in a static setting: Given a federation,\npopulate its assemblies with members satisfying ex ante and ex post fairness\nconditions on the participation of members of a community in its assembly, and\non the representation of child communities in the assembly of their parent\ncommunity.\n  In practice, we expect a grassroots democratic federation to grow and evolve\ndynamically and in all directions -- bottom-up, top-down, and middle-out. To\naddress that, we formally specify this dynamic setting and adapt the static\nfairness conditions to it: The ex post condition on the fair representation of\na child community becomes a condition that must always hold; the ex ante\nconditions in expectation on the fair participation of an individual and on the\nfair representation of a child community become conditions satisfied in\nactuality in the limit, provided the federation structure eventually\nstabilizes. We then present a protocol that satisfies these fairness\nconditions.",

    "abstract": "Genome modeling conventionally treats gene sequence as a language, reflecting\nits structured motifs and long-range dependencies analogous to linguistic units\nand organization principles such as words and syntax. Recent studies utilize\nadvanced neural networks, ranging from convolutional and recurrent models to\nTransformer-based models, to capture contextual information of gene sequence,\nwith the primary goal of obtaining effective gene sequence representations and\nthus enhance the models' understanding of various running gene samples.\nHowever, these approaches often directly apply language modeling techniques to\ngene sequences and do not fully consider the intrinsic information organization\nin them, where they do not consider how units at different granularities\ncontribute to representation. In this paper, we propose DNAZEN, an enhanced\ngenomic representation framework designed to learn from various granularities\nin gene sequences, including small polymers and G-grams that are combinations\nof several contiguous polymers. Specifically, we extract the G-grams from\nlarge-scale genomic corpora through an unsupervised approach to construct the\nG-gram vocabulary, which is used to provide G-grams in the learning process of\nDNA sequences through dynamically matching from running gene samples. A\nTransformer-based G-gram encoder is also proposed and the matched G-grams are\nfed into it to compute their representations and integrated into the encoder\nfor basic unit (E4BU), which is responsible for encoding small units and\nmaintaining the learning and inference process. To further enhance the learning\nprocess, we propose whole G-gram masking to train DNAZEN, where the model\nlargely favors the selection of each entire G-gram to mask rather than an\nordinary masking mechanism performed on basic units. Experiments on benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DNAZEN on various downstream tasks.",

Here we develop a framework\nfor gauge-invariant quantum information processing based on packaged quantum\nstates. We propose the necessary and sufficient conditions for a valid packaged\nsuperposition state of a single particle and multi-particle. We then present\nthe details of constructing gauge-invariant packaged qubits (or qudits),\npackaged gates, and packaged circuits (which commute with the total charge\noperator). These serve as alternative foundation for gauge-invariant quantum\ninformation science. We then adapt conventional quantum error-correction codes,\nquantum algorithms, and quantum communication protocols to the ($d \\times\nD$)-dimensional hybrid-packaged subspace. This high-dimensional hybrid-packaged\nsubspace is flexible for pruning and scaling to match available physics\nsystems. Thus, packaged quantum information processing becomes feasible and\ntestable. Our results show that the gauge-invariant packaged quantum states may\nprovide a possible route toward robust, fault-tolerant, and secure quantum\ntechnologies.",

To better understand students'\nperspectives and experiences with these tools, a survey was conducted at a\nlarge public university in the United States. Through thematic analysis, 262\nundergraduate students' responses regarding their perceived benefits and risks\nof AI chatbots in education were identified and categorized into themes.\n  The results discuss several benefits identified by the students, with\nfeedback and study support, instruction capabilities, and access to information\nbeing the most cited. Their primary concerns included risks to academic\nintegrity, accuracy of information, loss of critical thinking skills, the\npotential development of overreliance, and ethical considerations such as data\nprivacy, system bias, environmental impact, and preservation of human elements\nin education.\n  While student perceptions align with previously discussed benefits and risks\nof AI in education, they show heightened concerns about distinguishing between\nhuman and AI generated work - particularly in cases where authentic work is\nflagged as AI-generated. To address students' concerns, institutions can\nestablish clear policies regarding AI use and develop curriculum around AI\nliteracy.

    "abstract": "Customized text-to-video generation with pre-trained large-scale models has\nrecently garnered significant attention by focusing on identity and motion\nconsistency. Existing works typically follow the isolated customized paradigm,\nwhere the subject identity or motion dynamics are customized exclusively.\nHowever, this paradigm completely ignores the intrinsic mutual constraints and\nsynergistic interdependencies between identity and motion, resulting in\nidentity-motion conflicts throughout the generation process that systematically\ndegrade. To address this, we introduce DualReal, a novel framework that employs\nadaptive joint training to construct interdependencies between dimensions\ncollaboratively. Specifically, DualReal is composed of two units: (1)\nDual-aware Adaptation dynamically switches the training step (i.e., identity or\nmotion), learns the current information guided by the frozen dimension prior,\nand employs a regularization strategy to avoid knowledge leakage; (2)\nStageBlender Controller leverages the denoising stages and Diffusion\nTransformer depths to guide different dimensions with adaptive granularity,\navoiding conflicts at various stages and ultimately achieving lossless fusion\nof identity and motion patterns. We constructed a more comprehensive evaluation\nbenchmark than existing methods. The experimental results show that DualReal\nimproves CLIP-I and DINO-I metrics by 21.7% and 31.8% on average, and achieves\ntop performance on nearly all motion metrics.

    "abstract": "Continuous spectrum operators (CSOs), characterized by spectra comprising\ncontinuous intervals rather than discrete eigenvalues, are pivotal in quantum\nmechanics, wave propagation, and systems governed by partial differential\nequations. Traditional double operator integrals (DOIs), central to analyzing\noperator functions and perturbations, have been limited to operators with\nfinite or countable spectra, relying critically on self-adjointness. This work\nintroduces a comprehensive framework for Generalized Double Operator Integrals\n(GDOIs), extending DOI theory to non-self-adjoint operators through the\nspectral structure of CSOs. By reinterpreting DOIs as instances of the spectral\nmapping theorem for CSOs, we establish GDOIs as a rigorous generalization,\nenabling their application to operators with continuous spectra. Key\ncontributions include the development of GDOIs' algebraic properties,\nperturbation formulas generalizing classical results, norm and Lipschitz-type\ninequalities, and continuity with respect to operator and function parameters.\nApplications to differentiating operator-valued functions demonstrate the\nframework's utility in functional calculus. Furthermore, integrating recent\nspectral mapping theorems allows natural extension to hybrid spectrum\noperators, bridging operator theory with applied fields. This work\nsignificantly expands the analytical toolbox for systems with continuous\nspectral phenomena, offering new methodologies for quantum mechanics, control\ntheory, and stochastic analysis, where non-self-adjoint and continuous spectral\nfeatures are fundamental.

The\ninference mechanism in TM consists of propositional logic-based structures\nwithin each class, followed by a majority voting scheme, which makes the\nclassification decision. In TM, the voters are the outputs of Boolean clauses.\nThe voting mechanism comprises two operations: popcount for each class and\ndetermining the class with the maximum vote by means of an argmax operation.\n  While TMs offer a lightweight ML alternative, their performance is often\nlimited by the high computational cost of popcount and comparison required to\nproduce the argmax result.

We\nalso present an FPGA design flow for practical implementation of the\ntime-domain popcount, addressing delay skew and ensuring that the behavior\nmatches that of the model's intended functionality.

    "abstract": "Multilingual understanding is crucial for the cross-cultural applicability of\nLarge Language Models (LLMs). However, evaluation benchmarks designed for Hong\nKong's unique linguistic landscape, which combines Traditional Chinese script\nwith Cantonese as the spoken form and its cultural context, remain\nunderdeveloped. To address this gap, we introduce HKMMLU, a multi-task language\nunderstanding benchmark that evaluates Hong Kong's linguistic competence and\nsocio-cultural knowledge. The HKMMLU includes 26,698 multi-choice questions\nacross 66 subjects, organized into four categories: Science, Technology,\nEngineering, and Mathematics (STEM), Social Sciences, Humanities, and Other. To\nevaluate the multilingual understanding ability of LLMs, 90,550\nMandarin-Cantonese translation tasks were additionally included. We conduct\ncomprehensive experiments on GPT-4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and 18 open-source LLMs\nof varying sizes on HKMMLU. The results show that the best-performing model,\nDeepSeek-V3, struggles to achieve an accuracy of 75\\%, significantly lower than\nthat of MMLU and CMMLU. This performance gap highlights the need to improve\nLLMs' capabilities in Hong Kong-specific language and knowledge domains.\nFurthermore, we investigate how question language, model size, prompting\nstrategies, and question and reasoning token lengths affect model performance.\nWe anticipate that HKMMLU will significantly advance the development of LLMs in\nmultilingual and cross-cultural contexts, thereby enabling broader and more\nimpactful applications.",

Following this, 2D Gaussian\nSplatting (2DGS) leveraged perspective accurate 2D Gaussian primitive\nrasterization to achieve accurate geometry representation during rendering,\nimproving 3D scene reconstruction while maintaining real-time performance.\nRecent approaches have tackled the problem of sparse real-time NVS using 3DGS\nwithin a generalizable, MVS-based learning framework to regress 3D Gaussian\nparameters. Our work extends this line of research by addressing the challenge\nof generalizable sparse 3D reconstruction and NVS jointly, and manages to\nperform successfully at both tasks.

In recent years, AI-assisted IC design methods have\ndemonstrated great potential, but most methods are task-specific or focus\nsolely on the circuit structure in graph format, overlooking other circuit\nmodalities with rich functional information. In this paper, we introduce\nCircuitFusion, the first multimodal and implementation-aware circuit encoder.\nIt encodes circuits into general representations that support different\ndownstream circuit design tasks. To learn from circuits, we propose to fuse\nthree circuit modalities: hardware code, structural graph, and functionality\nsummary. More importantly, we identify four unique properties of circuits:\nparallel execution, functional equivalent transformation, multiple design\nstages, and circuit reusability. Based on these properties, we propose new\nstrategies for both the development and application of CircuitFusion: 1) During\ncircuit preprocessing, utilizing the parallel nature of circuits, we split each\ncircuit into multiple sub-circuits based on sequential-element boundaries, each\nsub-circuit in three modalities. 2) During CircuitFusion pre-training, we\nintroduce three self-supervised tasks that utilize equivalent transformations\nboth within and across modalities. 3) When applying CircuitFusion to downstream\ntasks, we propose a new retrieval-augmented inference method, which retrieves\nsimilar known circuits as a reference for predictions.

    ],
    "abstract": "Since the rise of Transformers, many semi-dense matching methods have adopted\nattention mechanisms to extract feature descriptors. However, the attention\nweights, which capture dependencies between pixels or keypoints, are often\nlearned from scratch. This approach can introduce redundancy and noisy\ninteractions from irrelevant regions, as it treats all pixels or keypoints\nequally. Drawing inspiration from keypoint selection processes, we propose to\nfirst classify all pixels into two categories: matchable and non-matchable.\nMatchable pixels are expected to receive higher attention weights, while\nnon-matchable ones are down-weighted. In this work, we propose a novel\nattention reweighting mechanism that simultaneously incorporates a learnable\nbias term into the attention logits and applies a matchability-informed\nrescaling to the input value features. The bias term, injected prior to the\nsoftmax operation, selectively adjusts attention scores based on the confidence\nof query-key interactions. Concurrently, the feature rescaling acts\npost-attention by modulating the influence of each value vector in the final\noutput. This dual design allows the attention mechanism to dynamically adjust\nboth its internal weighting scheme and the magnitude of its output\nrepresentations. Extensive experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets\nvalidate the effectiveness of our method, consistently outperforming existing\nstate-of-the-art approaches.",

    "abstract": "In the context of communication-centric integrated sensing and communication\n(ISAC), the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) waveform was\nproven to be optimal in minimizing ranging sidelobes when random signaling is\nused. A typical assumption in OFDM-based ranging is that the max target delay\nis less than the cyclic prefix (CP) length, which is equivalent to performing a\n\\textit{periodic} correlation between the signal reflected from the target and\nthe transmitted signal. In the multi-user case, such as in Orthogonal Frequency\nDivision Multiple Access (OFDMA), users are assigned disjoint subsets of\nsubcarriers which eliminates mutual interference between the communication\nchannels of the different users. However, ranging involves an aperiodic\ncorrelation operation for target ranges with delays greater than the CP length.\nAperiodic correlation between signals from disjoint frequency bands will not be\nzero, resulting in mutual interference between different user bands. We refer\nto this as \\textit{inter-band} (IB) cross-correlation interference. In this\nwork, we analytically characterize IB interference and quantify its impact on\nthe integrated sidelobe levels (ISL). We introduce an orthogonal spreading\nlayer on top of OFDM that can reduce IB interference resulting in ISL levels\nsignificantly lower than for OFDM without spreading in the multi-user setup. We\nvalidate our claims through simulations, and using an upper bound on IB energy\nwhich we show that it can be minimized using our proposed spreading. However,\nfor orthogonal spreading to be effective, a price must be paid in terms of\nspectral utilization, which is yet another manifestation of the trade-off\nbetween sensing accuracy and data communication capacity",

We\nadapted and evaluated several baseline models for 3D segmentation, highlighting\nthe challenges of 3D anomaly detection in driving environments. Our dataset and\nevaluation code will be openly available, facilitating the testing and\nperformance comparison of different approaches.",

An attractive solution to\nrelieve the programming burden is to transcompile the legacy code of one\nplatform to others. However, current transcompilation techniques struggle with\neither tremendous manual efforts or functional incorrectness, rendering \"Write\nOnce, Run Anywhere\" of tensor programs an open question.\n  We propose a novel transcompiler, i.e., QiMeng-Xpiler, for automatically\ntranslating tensor programs across DLS via both large language models (LLMs)\nand symbolic program synthesis, i.e., neural-symbolic synthesis. The key\ninsight is leveraging the powerful code generation ability of LLM to make\ncostly search-based symbolic synthesis computationally tractable. Concretely,\nwe propose multiple LLM-assisted compilation passes via pre-defined\nmeta-prompts for program transformation. During each program transformation,\nefficient symbolic program synthesis is employed to repair incorrect code\nsnippets with a limited scale. To attain high performance, we propose a\nhierarchical auto-tuning approach to systematically explore both the parameters\nand sequences of transformation passes. Experiments on 4 DLS with distinct\nprogramming interfaces, i.e., Intel DL Boost with VNNI, NVIDIA GPU with CUDA,\nAMD MI with HIP, and Cambricon MLU with BANG, demonstrate that QiMeng-Xpiler\ncorrectly translates different tensor programs at the accuracy of 95% on\naverage, and the performance of translated programs achieves up to 2.0x over\nvendor-provided manually-optimized libraries. As a result, the programming\nproductivity of DLS is improved by up to 96.0x via transcompiling legacy tensor\nprograms.",

These include\nsupervised fine-tuning, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), debugging, and\nmany others. In this paper, we combine two widely used approaches namely\nmulti-agent collaboration and runtime execution information-based debugging,\nfor improving code generation functionality, reliability, and practical\napplicability. We perform an empirical study in order to extend the evaluation\nof the individual strategies as well as the proposed composition of the\nactivities of both strategies. Our study use 19 LLMs to examines the\nperformance of individual and the proposed strategies, offering comprehensive\ninsights into how different programming activities compositions and training\nparadigms influence code generation effectiveness. In particular, we implement\na chained system that combines both strategies to assess their combined impact\non functional accuracy, code reliability, and generation latency using two\nbenchmark datasets commonly used for code generation. Our findings provide\nvaluable insights for organizations seeking robust AI-driven coding solutions\nby guiding them in selecting models that can better adapt to complex\npost-training strategies, ultimately fostering the adoption of more effective\nand reliable code generation technologies.",

However, for\ngraph-structured data, which requires emphasis on topological connections, they\nfall short compared to message-passing mechanisms on fixed links, such as those\nemployed by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). This raises a question: ``Does\nattention fail for graphs in natural language settings?'' Motivated by these\nobservations, we embarked on an empirical study from the perspective of\nattention mechanisms to explore how LLMs process graph-structured data. The\ngoal is to gain deeper insights into the attention behavior of LLMs over graph\nstructures. We uncovered unique phenomena regarding how LLMs apply attention to\ngraph-structured data and analyzed these findings to improve the modeling of\nsuch data by LLMs. The primary findings of our research are: 1) While LLMs can\nrecognize graph data and capture text-node interactions, they struggle to model\ninter-node relationships within graph structures due to inherent architectural\nconstraints. 2) The attention distribution of LLMs across graph nodes does not\nalign with ideal structural patterns, indicating a failure to adapt to graph\ntopology nuances. 3) Neither fully connected attention nor fixed connectivity\nis optimal; each has specific limitations in its application scenarios.\nInstead, intermediate-state attention windows improve LLM training performance\nand seamlessly transition to fully connected windows during inference.

    "abstract": "Organizing resources in a multidimensional classification space is an\napproach to efficiently managing and querying large-scale resources. This paper\ndefines an aggregation query on subspace defined by a range on the partial\norder on coordinate tree at each dimension, where each point contains resources\naggregated along the paths of partial order relations on the points so that\naggregated resources at each point within the subspace can be measured, ranked\nand selected. To efficiently locate non-empty points in a large subspace, an\napproach to generating graph index is proposed to build inclusion links with\npartial order relations on coordinates of dimensions to enable a subspace query\nto reach non-empty points by following indexing links and aggregate resources\nalong indexing paths back to their super points. Generating such an index is\ncostly as the number of children of an index node can be very large so that the\ntotal number of indexing nodes is unbounded. The proposed approach adopts the\nfollowing strategies to reduce the cost: (1) adding intersection links between\ntwo indexing nodes, which can better reduce query processing costs while\ncontrolling the number of nodes of the graph index; (2) intersection links are\nadded between two nodes according to the probabilistic distribution calculated\nfor estimating the costs of adding intersection between two nodes; (3)\ncoordinates at one dimension having more resources are split by coordinates at\nanother dimension to balance the number of resources hold by indexing nodes;\nand, (4) short-cut links are added between sibling coordinates of coordinate\ntrees to make an efficient query on linear order coordinates.

The recent\nadoption of high-resolution reference images for super-resolution is driven by\nthe poor spatial detail found in low-resolution HSIs, presenting it as a\nfavorable method. However, these approaches cannot effectively utilize\ninformation from the reference image, due to the inaccuracy of alignment and\nits inadequate interaction between alignment and fusion modules. In this paper,\nwe introduce a Spatial-Spectral Concordance Hyperspectral Super-Resolution\n(SSC-HSR) framework for unaligned reference RGB guided HSI SR to address the\nissues of inaccurate alignment and poor interactivity of the previous\napproaches. Specifically, to ensure spatial concordance, i.e., align images\nmore accurately across resolutions and refine textures, we construct a\nTwo-Stage Image Alignment with a synthetic generation pipeline in the image\nalignment module, where the fine-tuned optical flow model can produce a more\naccurate optical flow in the first stage and warp model can refine damaged\ntextures in the second stage. To enhance the interaction between alignment and\nfusion modules and ensure spectral concordance during reconstruction, we\npropose a Feature Aggregation module and an Attention Fusion module. In the\nfeature aggregation module, we introduce an Iterative Deformable Feature\nAggregation block to achieve significant feature matching and texture\naggregation with the fusion multi-scale results guidance, iteratively\ngenerating learnable offset.

However, for more complex use\ncases, such as sign language, we care less about large body motion and more\nabout subtle and complex motions of the hands and face. The problems of\nbuilding high fidelity models are compounded by the complexity of capturing\nmulti-view data of sign. The solution is to make better use of sequence data,\nensuring that we can overcome the limited information from only a few views by\nexploiting temporal variability. Nevertheless, learning from sequence-level\ndata requires extremely accurate and consistent model fitting to ensure that\nappearance is consistent across complex motions. We focus on how to achieve\nthis, constraining mesh parameters to build an accurate Gaussian splatting\nframework from few views capable of modelling subtle human motion. We leverage\nregularization techniques on the Gaussian parameters to mitigate overfitting\nand rendering artifacts. Additionally, we propose a new adaptive control method\nto densify Gaussians and prune splat points on the mesh surface.

    "abstract": "The nature of confinement is connected with color charge. Unfortunately, the\ncolor charge densities in QCD, the Noether charge densities associated with the\nglobal color invariance, are not invariant under local color rotations. This\nimplies that the expectation values of the net color charge in any region of\nany physical state in QCD, states that satisfy the color Gauss law, are\nautomatically zero for all components of color. In this paper it is shown that\nthe expectation value of the square of the net color charge in a region, a\nmeasure of the color charge fluctuations, is necessarily nonzero when evaluated\nin physical states and the result, while depending on the scheme and scale by\nwhich the theory is regulated, is gauge invariant. This holds despite the\nformal lack of gauge invariance of the operator.

Since obtaining in-vivo measurements for the electric\nfield distribution inside the biological tissue is challenging, physics-based\nsimulators are used. However, these simulators are computationally expensive\nand time-consuming, making repeated calculations of electric fields for\noptimization purposes computationally prohibitive. To overcome this issue, we\ndeveloped EMulator, a U-Net architecture-based regression model, for fast and\nrobust complex electric field estimation. We trained EMulator using electric\nfields generated by 43 antennas placed around 14 segmented human brain models.\nOnce trained, EMulator uses a segmented human brain model with an antenna\nlocation as an input and outputs the corresponding electric field. A\nrepresentative result of our study is that, at 1.5 GHz, on the validation\ndataset consisting of 6 subjects, we can estimate the electric field with the\nmagnitude of complex correlation coefficient of 0.978. Additionally, we could\ncalculate the electric field with a mean time of 4.4 ms. On average, this is at\nleast x1200 faster than the time required by state-of-the-art physics-based\nsimulator COMSOL.

Our key insight is that despite noisy and sparse demonstrations,\nthere exist infinite physically feasible trajectories that naturally bridge\nbetween demonstrated skills or emerge from their neighboring states, forming a\ncontinuous space of possible skill variations and transitions. Building upon\nthis insight, we present two data augmentation techniques: a Stitched\nTrajectory Graph (STG) that discovers potential transitions between\ndemonstration skills, and a State Transition Field (STF) that establishes\nunique connections for arbitrary states within the demonstration neighborhood.\nTo enable effective RLID with augmented data, we develop an Adaptive Trajectory\nSampling (ATS) strategy for dynamic curriculum generation and a historical\nencoding mechanism for memory-dependent skill learning.

We evaluated the framework on two\nreal-world multi-modal datasets (TCGA and IU Chest X-ray), assessing its\nperformance across multiple MLLMs (Qwen, Llava, Gemma), embedding strategies,\nsimilarity metrics, and varying numbers of demonstrations.\n  Results: RAICL consistently improved classification performance. Accuracy\nincreased from 0.7854 to 0.8368 on TCGA and from 0.7924 to 0.8658 on IU Chest\nX-ray. Multi-modal inputs outperformed single-modal ones, with text-only inputs\nbeing stronger than images alone. The richness of information embedded in each\nmodality will determine which embedding model can be used to get better\nresults. Few-shot experiments showed that increasing the number of retrieved\nexamples further enhanced performance. Across different similarity metrics,\nEuclidean distance achieved the highest accuracy while cosine similarity\nyielded better macro-F1 scores. RAICL demonstrated consistent improvements\nacross various MLLMs, confirming its robustness and versatility.\n  Conclusions: RAICL provides an efficient and scalable approach to enhance\nin-context learning in MLLMs for multimodal disease classification.",

As a compensation, a limited amount of scattering data is\nprovided, which is in principle containing sufficient information associated\nwith the missing part of the profile. The existing solvers can hardly realize\nthe compensation if the known part of the profile and the scattering data are\ncombined straightforwardly. On one hand, the well-developed forward solvers\nhave no mechanism to accept the scattering data, which can recover the unknown\npart of the profile if properly used.

We extend this line of inquiry by investigating\nsymmetry phenomena in real-valued loss functions defined on a broader class of\nspaces.

The aberration kernel has been previously studied in\ngreat detail, meaning that this simplification allows us to directly compute\nthe boost operator using the expressions of the aberration kernel. As a\npreparatory step, we generalize the differential equation that determines the\naberration kernel to general Doppler weight. This avoids the intermediate step\nof Doppler-weight raising and lowering operations in computations of the boost\noperator.

    "abstract": "Advances in Automation and Artificial Intelligence continue to enhance the\nautonomy of process plants in handling various operational scenarios. However,\ncertain tasks, such as fault handling, remain challenging, as they rely heavily\non human expertise. This highlights the need for systematic, knowledge-based\nmethods. To address this gap, we propose a methodological framework that\nintegrates Large Language Model (LLM) agents with a Digital Twin environment.\nThe LLM agents continuously interpret system states and initiate control\nactions, including responses to unexpected faults, with the goal of returning\nthe system to normal operation. In this context, the Digital Twin acts both as\na structured repository of plant-specific engineering knowledge for agent\nprompting and as a simulation platform for the systematic validation and\nverification of the generated corrective control actions. The evaluation using\na mixing module of a process plant demonstrates that the proposed framework is\ncapable not only of autonomously controlling the mixing module, but also of\ngenerating effective corrective actions to mitigate a pipe clogging with only a\nfew reprompts.",

As VFMs'\npopularity grows, there is an increasing interest in understanding their\neffectiveness for dense prediction tasks.

To assess the\neffectiveness of this approach, we investigate Interactive Segmentation (IS) as\na novel benchmark for evaluating feature upsampling methods on VFMs. Due to its\ninherent multimodal input, consisting of an image and a set of user-defined\nclicks, as well as its dense mask output, IS creates a challenging environment\nthat demands comprehensive visual scene understanding. Our benchmarking\nexperiments show that selecting appropriate upsampling strategies significantly\nimproves VFM features quality. The code is released at\nhttps://github.com/havrylovv/iSegProbe",

    "abstract": "As time series classification (TSC) gains prominence, ensuring robust TSC\nmodels against adversarial attacks is crucial. While adversarial defense is\nwell-studied in Computer Vision (CV), the TSC field has primarily relied on\nadversarial training (AT), which is computationally expensive. In this paper,\nfive data augmentation-based defense methods tailored for time series are\ndeveloped, with the most computationally intensive method among them increasing\nthe computational resources by only 14.07% compared to the original TSC model.\nMoreover, the deployment process for these methods is straightforward. By\nleveraging these advantages of our methods, we create two combined methods. One\nof these methods is an ensemble of all the proposed techniques, which not only\nprovides better defense performance than PGD-based AT but also enhances the\ngeneralization ability of TSC models. Moreover, the computational resources\nrequired for our ensemble are less than one-third of those required for\nPGD-based AT. These methods advance robust TSC in data mining. Furthermore, as\nfoundation models are increasingly explored for time series feature learning,\nour work provides insights into integrating data augmentation-based adversarial\ndefense with large-scale pre-trained models in future research.",

At its core, COCA utilizes a novel clustering algorithm that\nleverages the physical concept of compactness, to highlight distinct object\ncentroids in a scene, providing a spatial inductive bias. Thanks to this\nstrategy, COCA-Net generates high-quality segmentation masks on both the\ndecoder side and, notably, the encoder side of its pipeline. Additionally,\nCOCA-Net is not bound by a predetermined number of object masks that it\ngenerates and handles the segmentation of background elements better than its\ncompetitors.

    "abstract": "In the context of the new mandatory labor compliance in the European Union\n(EU), which will be implemented in 2027, supply chain enterprises face\nstringent working hour management requirements and compliance risks. In order\nto scientifically predict the enterprises' coping behaviors and performance\noutcomes under the policy impact, this paper constructs a methodological\nframework that integrates the AI synthetic data generation mechanism and\nstructural path regression modeling to simulate the enterprises' strategic\ntransition paths under the new regulations. In terms of research methodology,\nthis paper adopts high-quality simulation data generated based on Monte Carlo\nmechanism and NIST synthetic data standards to construct a structural path\nanalysis model that includes multiple linear regression, logistic regression,\nmediation effect and moderating effect. The variable system covers 14\nindicators such as enterprise working hours, compliance investment, response\nspeed, automation level, policy dependence, etc. The variable set with\nexplanatory power is screened out through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and\nVIF multicollinearity elimination. The findings show that compliance investment\nhas a significant positive impact on firm survival and its effect is\ntransmitted through the mediating path of the level of intelligence; meanwhile,\nfirms' dependence on the EU market significantly moderates the strength of this\nmediating effect. It is concluded that AI synthetic data combined with\nstructural path modeling provides an effective tool for high-intensity\nregulatory simulation, which can provide a quantitative basis for corporate\nstrategic response, policy design and AI-assisted decision-making in the\npre-prediction stage lacking real scenario data.

Addressing this critical research\ngap, this study introduces the Multi-Dimensional Ethical AI Adoption Model\n(MEAAM), a novel theoretical framework that categorizes 13 critical ethical\nvariables across four foundational dimensions of Ethical AI Fair AI,\nResponsible AI, Explainable AI, and Sustainable AI. These dimensions are\nfurther analyzed through three core ethical lenses: epistemic concerns (related\nto knowledge, transparency, and system trustworthiness), normative concerns\n(focused on justice, autonomy, dignity, and moral obligations), and overarching\nconcerns (highlighting global, systemic, and long-term ethical implications).\nThis study adopts a quantitative, cross-sectional research design using survey\ndata collected from healthcare professionals and analyzed via Partial Least\nSquares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). Employing PLS-SEM, this study\nempirically investigates the influence of these ethical constructs on two\noutcomes Operational AI Adoption and Systemic AI Adoption. Results indicate\nthat normative concerns most significantly drive operational adoption\ndecisions, while overarching concerns predominantly shape systemic adoption\nstrategies and governance frameworks. Epistemic concerns play a facilitative\nrole, enhancing the impact of ethical design principles on trust and\ntransparency in AI systems.

VideoFace2.0 is the name of the developed system for spatial and\ntemporal localization of each unique face in the input video, i.e. face\nre-identification (ReID), which also allows their cataloging, characterization\nand creation of structured video outputs for later downstream tasks. Developed\nnear real-time solution is primarily designed to be utilized in application\nscenarios involving TV production, media analysis, and as an efficient tool for\ncreating large video datasets necessary for training machine learning (ML)\nmodels in challenging vision tasks such as lip reading and multimodal speech\nrecognition.

The basis of these methods is a well-balanced\nreconstruction operator. Moreover, they introduced a procedure to modify any\nstandard reconstruction operator, like MUSCL, ENO, CWENO, etc., in order to be\nwell-balanced. This strategy involves a non-linear problem at every cell at\nevery time step that consists in finding the stationary solution whose average\nis the given cell value. In a recent paper, a fully well-balanced method is\npresented where the non-linear problems to be solved in the reconstruction\nprocedure are interpreted as control problems. The goal of this paper is to\nintroduce a new technique to solve these local non-linear problems based on the\napplication of the collocation RK methods. Special care is put to analyze the\neffects of computing the averages and the source terms using quadrature\nformulas. A general technique which allows us to deal with resonant problems is\nalso introduced. To check the efficiency of the methods and their well-balance\nproperty, they have been applied to a number of tests, ranging from easy\nacademic systems of balance laws consisting of Burgers equation with some\nnon-linear source terms to the shallow water equations -- with and without\nManning friction -- or Euler equations of gas dynamics with gravity effects.",

Compared with conventional RGB\nimages, lidar imagery demonstrates greater robustness in adverse environmental\nconditions, such as low light and foggy weather. Moreover, the imaging\ncapability addresses the challenges in environments where the geometric\ninformation in point clouds may be degraded, such as long corridors, and dense\npoint clouds may be misleading, potentially leading to drift errors.\n  Therefore, this paper proposes a novel framework that leverages DL-based\ncolorization and super-resolution techniques on lidar imagery to extract\nreliable samples from lidar point clouds for odometry estimation. The enhanced\nlidar images, enriched with additional information, facilitate improved\nkeypoint detection, which is subsequently employed for more effective point\ncloud downsampling. The proposed method enhances point cloud registration\naccuracy and mitigates mismatches arising from insufficient geometric\ninformation or misleading extra points. Experimental results indicate that our\napproach surpasses previous methods, achieving lower translation and rotation\nerrors while using fewer points.",

    "abstract": "The acquisition of information-rich images within a limited time budget is\ncrucial in medical imaging. Medical image translation (MIT) can help enhance\nand supplement existing datasets by generating synthetic images from acquired\ndata. While Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) and Diffusion Models (DMs) have\nachieved remarkable success in natural image generation, their benefits -\ncreativity and image realism - do not necessarily transfer to medical\napplications where highly accurate anatomical information is required. In fact,\nthe imitation of acquisition noise or content hallucination hinder clinical\nutility. Here, we introduce YODA (You Only Denoise once - or Average), a novel\n2.5D diffusion-based framework for volumetric MIT. YODA unites diffusion and\nregression paradigms to produce realistic or noise-free outputs. Furthermore,\nwe propose Expectation-Approximation (ExpA) DM sampling, which draws\ninspiration from MRI signal averaging. ExpA-sampling suppresses generated noise\nand, thus, eliminates noise from biasing the evaluation of image quality.\nThrough extensive experiments on four diverse multi-modal datasets - comprising\nmulti-contrast brain MRI and pelvic MRI-CT - we show that diffusion and\nregression sampling yield similar results in practice. As such, the\ncomputational overhead of diffusion sampling does not provide systematic\nbenefits in medical information translation. Building on these insights, we\ndemonstrate that YODA outperforms several state-of-the-art GAN and DM methods.\nNotably, YODA-generated images are shown to be interchangeable with, or even\nsuperior to, physical acquisitions for several downstream tasks. Our findings\nchallenge the presumed advantages of DMs in MIT and pave the way for the\npractical application of MIT in medical imaging.",

    "abstract": "In some previous works, two of the authors have introduced a strategy to\ndevelop high-order numerical methods for systems of balance laws that preserve\nall the stationary solutions of the system. The key ingredient of these methods\nis a well-balanced reconstruction operator. A strategy has been also introduced\nto modify any standard reconstruction operator like MUSCL, ENO, CWENO, etc. in\norder to be well-balanced. This strategy involves a non-linear problem at every\ncell at every time step that consists in finding the stationary solution whose\naverage is the given cell value. So far this strategy has been only applied to\nsystems whose stationary solution are known either in explicit or implicit\nform. The goal of this paper is to present a general implementation of this\ntechnique that can be applied to any system of balance laws. To do this, the\nnonlinear problems to be solved in the reconstruction procedure are interpreted\nas control problems: they consist in finding a solution of an ODE system whose\naverage at the computation interval is given. These problems are written in\nfunctional form and the gradient of the functional is computed on the basis of\nthe adjoint problem. Newton's method is applied then to solve the problems.\nSpecial care is put to analyze the effects of computing the averages and the\nsource terms using quadrature formulas. To test their efficiency and\nwell-balancedness, the methods are applied to a number of systems of balance\nlaws, ranging from easy academic systems consisting of Burgers equation with\nsome nonlinear source terms to the shallow water equations or Euler equations\nof gas dynamics with gravity effects.",

The key to graph in-context learning is\nto perform downstream graphs conditioned on chosen prompt examples. Existing\nmethods randomly select subgraphs or edges as prompts, leading to noisy graph\nprompts and inferior model performance. Additionally, due to the gap between\npre-training and testing graphs, when the number of classes in the testing\ngraphs is much greater than that in the training, the in-context learning\nability will also significantly deteriorate. To tackle the aforementioned\nchallenges, we develop a multi-stage adaptive prompt optimization method\nGraphPrompter, which optimizes the entire process of generating, selecting, and\nusing graph prompts for better in-context learning capabilities. Firstly,\nPrompt Generator introduces a reconstruction layer to highlight the most\ninformative edges and reduce irrelevant noise for graph prompt construction.\nFurthermore, in the selection stage, Prompt Selector employs the $k$-nearest\nneighbors algorithm and pre-trained selection layers to dynamically choose\nappropriate samples and minimize the influence of irrelevant prompts. Finally,\nwe leverage a Prompt Augmenter with a cache replacement strategy to enhance the\ngeneralization capability of the pre-trained model on new datasets. Extensive\nexperiments show that GraphPrompter effectively enhances the in-context\nlearning ability of graph models. On average across all the settings, our\napproach surpasses the state-of-the-art baselines by over 8%. Our code is\nreleased at https://github.com/karin0018/GraphPrompter.",

However, deep learning (DL)-based reconstruction\nmethods have often overlooked noise propagation due to inherent analytical and\ncomputational challenges, despite its critical importance. This work proposes a\ntheoretically grounded, memory-efficient technique to calculate voxel-wise\nvariance for quantifying uncertainty due to acquisition noise in accelerated\nMRI reconstructions.

Although achieving reasonable\nscalability, there are several critical problems remaining unexplored, i.e.,\nlearnable decomposition, modeling scene heterogeneity, and modeling efficiency.\nIn this paper, we introduce Switch-NeRF++, a Heterogeneous Mixture of Hash\nExperts (HMoHE) network that addresses these challenges within a unified\nframework. It is a highly scalable NeRF that learns heterogeneous decomposition\nand heterogeneous NeRFs efficiently for large-scale scenes in an end-to-end\nmanner. In our framework, a gating network learns to decompose scenes and\nallocates 3D points to specialized NeRF experts. This gating network is\nco-optimized with the experts by our proposed Sparsely Gated Mixture of Experts\n(MoE) NeRF framework. We incorporate a hash-based gating network and distinct\nheterogeneous hash experts. The hash-based gating efficiently learns the\ndecomposition of the large-scale scene. The distinct heterogeneous hash experts\nconsist of hash grids of different resolution ranges, enabling effective\nlearning of the heterogeneous representation of different scene parts. These\ndesign choices make our framework an end-to-end and highly scalable NeRF\nsolution for real-world large-scale scene modeling to achieve both quality and\nefficiency. We evaluate our accuracy and scalability on existing large-scale\nNeRF datasets and a new dataset with very large-scale scenes ($>6.5km^2$) from\nUrbanBIS. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach can be easily\nscaled to various large-scale scenes and achieve state-of-the-art scene\nrendering accuracy. Furthermore, our method exhibits significant efficiency,\nwith an 8x acceleration in training and a 16x acceleration in rendering\ncompared to Switch-NeRF.

    "abstract": "In a typical authentication process, the local system verifies the user's\nidentity using a stored hash value generated by a cross-system hash algorithm.\nThis article shifts the research focus from traditional password encryption to\nthe establishment of gatekeeping mechanisms for effective interactions between\na system and the outside world. Here, we propose a triple-identity\nauthentication system to achieve this goal. Specifically, this local system\nopens the inner structure of its hash algorithm to all user credentials,\nincluding the login name, login password, and authentication password. When a\nlogin credential is entered, the local system hashes it and then creates a\nunique identifier using intermediate hash elements randomly selected from the\nopen algorithm. Importantly, this locally generated unique identifier (rather\nthan the stored hash produced by the open algorithm) is utilized to verify the\nuser's combined identity, which is generated by combining the entered\ncredential with the International Mobile Equipment Identity and the\nInternational Mobile Subscriber Identity. The verification process is\nimplemented at each interaction point: the login name field, the login password\nfield, and the server's authentication point. Thus, within the context of this\ntriple-identity authentication system, we establish a robust gatekeeping\nmechanism for system interactions, ultimately providing a level of security\nthat is equivalent to multi-factor authentication.",

In this paper, we investigate why preference alignment\naffects calibration and how to address this issue. For the first question, we\nobserve that the preference collapse issue in alignment undesirably generalizes\nto the calibration scenario, causing LLMs to exhibit overconfidence and poor\ncalibration. To address this, we demonstrate the importance of fine-tuning with\ndomain-specific knowledge to alleviate the overconfidence issue. To further\nanalyze whether this affects the model's performance, we categorize models into\ntwo regimes: calibratable and non-calibratable, defined by bounds of Expected\nCalibration Error (ECE). In the calibratable regime, we propose a\ncalibration-aware fine-tuning approach to achieve proper calibration without\ncompromising LLMs' performance. However, as models are further fine-tuned for\nbetter performance, they enter the non-calibratable regime. For this case, we\ndevelop an EM-algorithm-based ECE regularization for the fine-tuning loss to\nmaintain low calibration error.

    "abstract": "In a distinguishing problem, the input is a sample drawn from one of two\ndistributions and the algorithm is tasked with identifying the source\ndistribution. The performance of a distinguishing algorithm is measured by its\nadvantage, i.e., its incremental probability of success over a random guess. A\nclassic example of a distinguishing problem is the Planted Clique problem,\nwhere the input is a graph sampled from either $G(n,1/2)$ -- the standard\nErd\\H{o}s-R\\'{e}nyi model, or $G(n,1/2,k)$ -- the Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'{e}nyi model\nwith a clique planted on a random subset of $k$ vertices. The Planted Clique\nHypothesis asserts that efficient algorithms cannot achieve advantage better\nthan some absolute constant, say $1/4$, whenever $k=n^{1/2-\\Omega(1)}$. In this\nwork, we aim to precisely understand the optimal distinguishing advantage\nachievable by efficient algorithms on Planted Clique. We show the following\nresults under the Planted Clique hypothesis:\n  1. Optimality of low-degree polynomials: No efficient algorithm can beat the\nadvantage the optimal low-degree polynomial. Concretely, this means that the\nadvantage of any efficient algorithm is at most $(1+o(1))\\cdot\nk^2/(\\sqrt{\\pi}n)$, which is optimal in light of a simple edge-counting\nalgorithm achieving this bound.\n  2. Harder planted distributions: There is an efficiently sampleable\ndistribution $\\mathcal{P}^*$ supported on graphs containing $k$-cliques such\nthat no efficient algorithm can distinguish $\\mathcal{P}^*$ from $G(n,1/2)$\nwith advantage $n^{-d}$ for an arbitrarily large constant $d$. In other words,\nthere exist alternate planted distributions that are much harder than\n$G(n,1/2,k)$. Along the way, we prove a constructive hard-core lemma for a\nbroad class of distributions with respect to low-degree polynomials. This\nresult is applicable much more widely beyond Planted Clique and might be of\nindependent interest.",

We show the optimization problems are\nNP-hard and give hypergraph-based integer linear programming exact algorithm\nand approximation algorithms. To enhance computational efficiency, we introduce\na clustering heuristic that utilizes both spatial and temporal aspects of the\ninput data to accelerate rider-to-driver assignments.

Traditional approaches compute\nreachable sets by numerically solving an HJ Partial Differential Equation (PDE)\nover a grid, which is computationally prohibitive due to the curse of\ndimensionality. Recent learning-based methods have sought to address this\nchallenge by approximating reachability solutions using neural networks trained\nwith PDE residual error. However, these approaches often suffer from unstable\ntraining dynamics and suboptimal solutions due to the weak learning signal\nprovided by the residual loss. In this work, we propose a novel approach that\nleverages model predictive control (MPC) techniques to guide and accelerate the\nreachability learning process. Observing that HJ reachability is inherently\nrooted in optimal control, we utilize MPC to generate approximate reachability\nsolutions at key collocation points, which are then used to tactically guide\nthe neural network training by ensuring compliance with these approximations.\nMoreover, we iteratively refine the MPC generated solutions using the learned\nreachability solution, mitigating convergence to local optima.

Participants were randomized to viewing original or\nsimplified texts in a subject area, and answered multiple-choice questions\n(MCQs) that tested their comprehension of the text.

Our results\nindicate that participants who read the simplified text answered more MCQs\ncorrectly than their counterparts who read the original text (3.9% absolute\nincrease, p<0.05). This gain was most striking with PubMed (14.6%), while more\nmoderate gains were observed for finance (5.5%), aerospace/computer science\n(3.8%) domains, and legal (3.5%).

While prior works\nprimarily focus on teleoperation or video-based retargeting, they often suffer\nfrom kinematic mismatches and the absence of real-time tactile feedback,\nhindering the acquisition of high-fidelity tactile data. To mitigate this\nissue, we propose KineDex, a hand-over-hand kinesthetic teaching paradigm in\nwhich the operator's motion is directly transferred to the dexterous hand,\nenabling the collection of physically grounded demonstrations enriched with\naccurate tactile feedback. To resolve occlusions from human hand, we apply\ninpainting technique to preprocess the visual observations. Based on these\ndemonstrations, we then train a visuomotor policy using tactile-augmented\ninputs and implement force control during deployment for precise contact-rich\nmanipulation. We evaluate KineDex on a suite of challenging contact-rich\nmanipulation tasks, including particularly difficult scenarios such as\nsqueezing toothpaste onto a toothbrush, which require precise multi-finger\ncoordination and stable force regulation. Across these tasks, KineDex achieves\nan average success rate of 74.4%, representing a 57.7% improvement over the\nvariant without force control. Comparative experiments with teleoperation and\nuser studies further validate the advantages of KineDex in data collection\nefficiency and operability. Specifically, KineDex collects data over twice as\nfast as teleoperation across two tasks of varying difficulty, while maintaining\na near-100% success rate, compared to under 50% for teleoperation.",

Recent developments in machine learning (ML) and deep learning\n(DL) have primarily focused on visual data to detect distraction, often\nneglecting the complex, multimodal nature of driver behavior. This systematic\nreview assesses 74 peer-reviewed studies from 2019 to 2024 that utilize ML/DL\ntechniques for distracted driving detection across visual, sensor-based,\nmultimodal, and emerging modalities. The review highlights a significant\nprevalence of visual-only models, particularly convolutional neural networks\n(CNNs) and temporal architectures, which achieve high accuracy but show limited\ngeneralizability in real-world scenarios. Sensor-based and physiological models\nprovide complementary strengths by capturing internal states and vehicle\ndynamics, while emerging techniques, such as auditory sensing and radio\nfrequency (RF) methods, offer privacy-aware alternatives. Multimodal\narchitecture consistently surpasses unimodal baselines, demonstrating enhanced\nrobustness, context awareness, and scalability by integrating diverse data\nstreams. These findings emphasize the need to move beyond visual-only\napproaches and adopt multimodal systems that combine visual, physiological, and\nvehicular cues while keeping in checking the need to balance computational\nrequirements.

However, existing methods typically require carefully\ntraining a task-specific model for each category independently, leading to high\ncost, low efficiency, and weak generalization. Therefore, this paper presents a\nnovel unified model for Multi-Category 3D Anomaly Detection (MC3D-AD) that aims\nto utilize both local and global geometry-aware information to reconstruct\nnormal representations of all categories. First, to learn robust and\ngeneralized features of different categories, we propose an adaptive\ngeometry-aware masked attention module that extracts geometry variation\ninformation to guide mask attention. Then, we introduce a local geometry-aware\nencoder reinforced by the improved mask attention to encode group-level feature\ntokens. Finally, we design a global query decoder that utilizes point cloud\nposition embeddings to improve the decoding process and reconstruction ability.\nThis leads to local and global geometry-aware reconstructed feature tokens for\nthe AD task. MC3D-AD is evaluated on two publicly available Real3D-AD and\nAnomaly-ShapeNet datasets, and exhibits significant superiority over current\nstate-of-the-art single-category methods, achieving 3.1\\% and 9.3\\% improvement\nin object-level AUROC over Real3D-AD and Anomaly-ShapeNet, respectively.

    "abstract": "Modular self-reconfigurable satellites refer to satellite clusters composed\nof individual modular units capable of altering their configurations. The\nconfiguration changes enable the execution of diverse tasks and mission\nobjectives. Existing path planning algorithms for reconfiguration often suffer\nfrom high computational complexity, poor generalization capability, and limited\nsupport for diverse target configurations. To address these challenges, this\npaper proposes a goal-oriented reinforcement learning-based path planning\nalgorithm. This algorithm is the first to address the challenge that previous\nreinforcement learning methods failed to overcome, namely handling multiple\ntarget configurations. Moreover, techniques such as Hindsight Experience Replay\nand Invalid Action Masking are incorporated to overcome the significant\nobstacles posed by sparse rewards and invalid actions. Based on these designs,\nour model achieves a 95% and 73% success rate in reaching arbitrary target\nconfigurations in a modular satellite cluster composed of four and six units,\nrespectively.",

The experimental results suggest that the\nquantum tunneling of highly concentrated protons (deuterons) in the\nsuperconducting state is responsible for the observed features: the residual\nresistivity arises from the weakening of the global coherence of\nsuperconductivity owing to the tunneling motion of protons (deuterons), while\nthe zero resistivity is caused by long-range ordering of the protons\n(deuterons).

Existing approaches to LM control either only deal with syntactic\nconstraints which cannot capture the aforementioned attributes, or rely on\nsampling to explore the conditional LM distribution, an ineffective estimator\nfor low-probability events.

Of particular curiosity on uncertainty trinity, this study\nunderlines that global geopolitical risk negatively drives explosive actions in\nthe ratio of exchange rates for non-traded and traded goods. The global\neconomic policy uncertainty negatively affects speculative bubbles in the\nexchange rate and the ratio of exchange rates for non-traded. The country's\ngeopolitical risks negatively strike only speculative bubbles in the exchange\nrate. Further, we find heterogeneity in our results by examining different\nexchange rate systems. The robustness checks further firmly ascertain across\nbaseline empirical findings.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer, which has a low survival rate, is one of the most\nchallenging cancers to diagnose and treat effectively. Early detection through\nabdominal computed tomography (CT) scans is crucial, yet complicated by the\npancreas' obscure anatomical position, small size, and frequent occlusion by\nsurrounding organs. These factors make the pancreas particularly difficult to\nidentify and segment accurately. While deep learning (DL) models have shown\npromise for segmentation tasks, their performance still requires significant\nimprovement to address these challenges. In this research, we propose a novel\nadaptive TverskyCE loss for DL model training, which combines Tversky loss with\ncross-entropy loss through learnable weights. Our method enables automatic\nadjustment of loss contributions during training, dynamically optimizing the\nobjective function for improved performance. All experiments were conducted on\nthe National Institutes of Health (NIH) Pancreas-CT dataset. We evaluated the\nadaptive TverskyCE loss on the UNet-3D and Dilated UNet-3D, and our method\nachieved a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 85.59%, with peak performance\nup to 95.24%, and the score of 85.14%. DSC and the score score were improved by\n9.47% and 8.98% respectively compared with the baseline UNet-3D with Tversky\nloss for pancreas segmentation.

    "abstract": "The recent Segment Anything Model (SAM) demonstrates strong instance\nsegmentation performance across various downstream tasks. However, SAM is\ntrained solely on RGB data, limiting its direct applicability to RGB-thermal\n(RGB-T) semantic segmentation. Given that RGB-T provides a robust solution for\nscene understanding in adverse weather and lighting conditions, such as low\nlight and overexposure, we propose a novel framework, SARTM, which customizes\nthe powerful SAM for RGB-T semantic segmentation. Our key idea is to unleash\nthe potential of SAM while introduce semantic understanding modules for RGB-T\ndata pairs. Specifically, our framework first involves fine tuning the original\nSAM by adding extra LoRA layers, aiming at preserving SAM's strong\ngeneralization and segmentation capabilities for downstream tasks. Secondly, we\nintroduce language information as guidance for training our SARTM. To address\ncross-modal inconsistencies, we introduce a Cross-Modal Knowledge\nDistillation(CMKD) module that effectively achieves modality adaptation while\nmaintaining its generalization capabilities. This semantic module enables the\nminimization of modality gaps and alleviates semantic ambiguity, facilitating\nthe combination of any modality under any visual conditions. Furthermore, we\nenhance the segmentation performance by adjusting the segmentation head of SAM\nand incorporating an auxiliary semantic segmentation head, which integrates\nmulti-scale features for effective fusion. Extensive experiments are conducted\nacross three multi-modal RGBT semantic segmentation benchmarks: MFNET, PST900,\nand FMB. Both quantitative and qualitative results consistently demonstrate\nthat the proposed SARTM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches\nacross a variety of conditions.",

It is demonstrated that the hexagonators appearing at second order\nsatisfy the requisite axioms of a braided monoidal cochain 2-category provided\nthat the strict infinitesimal 2-braiding is totally symmetric and coherent (in\nCirio and Faria Martins' sense). We show that those infinitesimal 2-braidings\ninduced by 2-shifted Poisson structures are indeed totally symmetric and we\nrelate coherency to the third-weight component of the Maurer-Cartan equation\nthat a 2-shifted Poisson structure must satisfy.
