    "abstract": "Searching for signs of life is a primary goal of the Habitable Worlds\nObservatory (HWO). However, merely detecting oxygen, methane, or other widely\ndiscussed biosignatures is insufficient evidence for a biosphere. In parallel\nwith biosignature detection, exoplanet life detection additionally requires\ncharacterization of the broader physicochemical context to evaluate planetary\nhabitability and the plausibility that life could produce a particular\nbiosignature in a given environment. Life detection further requires that we\ncan confidently rule out photochemical or geological phenomena that can mimic\nlife (i.e. \"false positives\"). Evaluating false positive scenarios may require\ndifferent observatory specifications than biosignature detection surveys. Here,\nwe explore the coronagraph requirements for assessing habitability and ruling\nout known false positive (and false negative) scenarios for oxygen and methane,\nthe two most widely discussed biosignatures for Earth-like exoplanets. We find\nthat broad wavelength coverage ranging from the near UV (0.26 $\\mu$m) and\nextending into the near infrared (1.7 $\\mu$m), is necessary for contextualizing\nbiosignatures with HWO. The short wavelength cutoff is driven by the need to\nidentify Proterozoic-like biospheres via O$_3$, whereas the long wavelength\ncutoff is driven by the need to contextualize O$_2$ and CH$_4$ biosignatures\nvia constraints on C-bearing atmospheric species. The ability to obtain spectra\nwith signal-to-noise ratios of 20-40 across this 0.26-1.7 $\\mu$m range\n(assuming R=7 UV, R=140 VIS, and R=70 NIR) is also required. Without\nsufficiently broad wavelength coverage, we risk being unprepared to interpret\nbiosignature detections and may ultimately be ill-equipped to confirm the\ndetection of an Earth-like biosphere, which is a driving motivation of HWO..",

While CGTs offer potential\nproductivity enhancements, their effectiveness across diverse user groups have\nnot been sufficiently investigated. Objectives: We hypothesize that developers'\ninteractions with CGTs vary based on gender, influencing task outcomes and\ncognitive load, as prior research suggests that gender differences can affect\ntechnology use and cognitive processing. Methods: The study will employ a\nmixed-subjects design with 54 participants, evenly divided by gender for a\ncounterbalanced design. Participants will complete two programming tasks\n(medium to hard difficulty) with only CGT assistance and then with only\ninternet access. Task orders and conditions will be counterbalanced to mitigate\norder effects. Data collection will include cognitive load surveys, screen\nrecordings, and task performance metrics such as completion time, code\ncorrectness, and CGT interaction behaviors. Statistical analyses will be\nconducted to identify statistically significant differences in CGT usage.\nExpected Contributions: Our work can uncover gender differences in CGT\ninteraction and performance among developers. Our findings can inform future\nCGT designs and help address usability and potential disparities in interaction\npatterns across diverse user groups. Conclusion: While results are not yet\navailable, our proposal lays the groundwork for advancing fairness,\naccountability, transparency, and ethics (FATE) in CGT design. The outcomes are\nanticipated to contribute to inclusive AI practices and equitable tool\ndevelopment for all users.",

    "abstract": "Motivated by federated learning (FL), secure aggregation (SA) aims to\nsecurely compute, as efficiently as possible, the sum of a set of inputs\ndistributed across many users. To understand the impact of network topology,\nhierarchical secure aggregation (HSA) investigated the communication and secret\nkey generation efficiency in a 3-layer relay network, where clusters of users\nare connected to the aggregation server through an intermediate layer of\nrelays. Due to the pre-aggregation of the messages at the relays, HSA reduces\nthe communication burden on the relay-to-server links and is able to support a\nlarge number of users. However, as the number of users increases, a practical\nchallenge arises from heterogeneous security requirements--for example, users\nin different clusters may require varying levels of input protection. Motivated\nby this, we study weakly-secure HSA (WS-HSA) with collusion resilience, where\ninstead of protecting all the inputs from any set of colluding users, only the\ninputs belonging to a predefined collection of user groups (referred to as\nsecurity input sets) need to be protected against another predefined collection\nof user groups (referred to as collusion sets). Since the security input sets\nand collusion sets can be arbitrarily defined, our formulation offers a\nflexible framework for addressing heterogeneous security requirements in HSA.\nWe characterize the optimal total key rate, i.e., the total number of\nindependent key symbols required to ensure both server and relay security, for\na broad range of parameter configurations. For the remaining cases, we\nestablish lower and upper bounds on the optimal key rate, providing\nconstant-factor gap optimality guarantees.",

Chest X-rays (CXRs) are a\nvital diagnostic tool, providing insights into clinical trajectories, but their\nirregular acquisition limits their utility. Existing tools for CXR\ninterpretation are constrained by cross-sectional analysis, failing to capture\ntemporal dynamics. To address this, we introduce CXR-TFT, a novel multi-modal\nframework that integrates temporally sparse CXR imaging and radiology reports\nwith high-frequency clinical data, such as vital signs, laboratory values, and\nrespiratory flow sheets, to predict the trajectory of CXR findings in\ncritically ill patients. CXR-TFT leverages latent embeddings from a vision\nencoder that are temporally aligned with hourly clinical data through\ninterpolation. A transformer model is then trained to predict CXR embeddings at\neach hour, conditioned on previous embeddings and clinical measurements. In a\nretrospective study of 20,000 ICU patients, CXR-TFT demonstrated high accuracy\nin forecasting abnormal CXR findings up to 12 hours before they became\nradiographically evident. This predictive capability in clinical data holds\nsignificant potential for enhancing the management of time-sensitive conditions\nlike acute respiratory distress syndrome, where early intervention is crucial\nand diagnoses are often delayed. By providing distinctive temporal resolution\nin prognostic CXR analysis, CXR-TFT offers actionable 'whole patient' insights\nthat can directly improve clinical outcomes.",

The\npost-bifurcation solution obtained in Part I for these materials corresponds\nphysically to the formation of twin lamellar domains perpendicular to the\nloading axis, which is consistent with the chevron like deformation patterns\nthat develop in tendons under cyclic loading. As biological materials are\nhighly imperfect, and specifically tendons exhibit a high degree of so called\ncrimp in the collagen fibers, in this study the effect of imperfections to the\nresponse is explored. For all composites with small initial imperfections that\nhave been considered, the results of this work have been found to be in\ncomplete agreement with the corresponding analytical results of Part I, and,\ndomains have been found to emerge at a macroscopically compressive state.\nHowever, as the imperfection amplitude is increased and becomes of the order to\nthe layer width, or greater, domains begin to develop at macroscopically\ntensile stresses, which is in agreement with the fact that the loading of soft\nbiological materials such as tendons and ligaments is tensile in nature.

    "abstract": "Generative models have recently demonstrated strong potential in\nmulti-behavior recommendation systems, leveraging the expressive power of\ntransformers and tokenization to generate personalized item sequences. However,\ntheir adoption is hindered by (1) the lack of explicit information for token\nreasoning, (2) high computational costs due to quadratic attention complexity\nand dense sequence representations after tokenization, and (3) limited\nmulti-scale modeling over user history. In this work, we propose GRACE\n(Generative Recommendation via journey-aware sparse Attention on\nChain-of-thought tokEnization), a novel generative framework for multi-behavior\nsequential recommendation. GRACE introduces a hybrid Chain-of-Thought (CoT)\ntokenization method that encodes user-item interactions with explicit\nattributes from product knowledge graphs (e.g., category, brand, price) over\nsemantic tokenization, enabling interpretable and behavior-aligned generation.\nTo address the inefficiency of standard attention, we design a Journey-Aware\nSparse Attention (JSA) mechanism, which selectively attends to compressed,\nintra-, inter-, and current-context segments in the tokenized sequence.\nExperiments on two real-world datasets show that GRACE significantly\noutperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to +106.9% HR@10 and\n+106.7% NDCG@10 improvement over the state-of-the-art baseline on the Home\ndomain, and +22.1% HR@10 on the Electronics domain.

Results show that electrolyzers enable up to 30 percent reduction in\nlevelized cost of electricity (LCOE) and US\\$460 million in cumulative system\ncost savings by 2050 compared to a business-as-usual scenario. As a flexible\ndemand available to absorb surplus generation, electrolyzers reduce curtailment\nand support large-scale wind integration while still requiring a diverse mix of\nrenewable electricity. The resulting hydrogen reaches a levelized cost of \\$3.2\nper kg by 2050, and its carbon intensity from electricity use falls below one\nkg carbon dioxide per kg of hydrogen, suggesting likely compliance with\ninternational certification thresholds. Benefits persist across all demand\ntrajectories, though their scale depends on the pace of wind expansion. Spatial\nanalyses reveal unequal distribution of infrastructure gains, underscoring the\nneed for equity-oriented planning. These findings suggest that grid-integrated\nhydrogen, if planned in coordination with wind investment, transmission, and\nequitable infrastructure deployment, can reduce costs, support certification,\nand promote a more equitable model of hydrogen development.

    "abstract": "Here, we demonstrate that vacuum fluctuations can induce lateral forces on a\nsmall particle positioned near a translation-invariant uniform non-Hermitian\nsubstrate with chiral gain. This type of non-Hermitian response can be\nengineered by biasing a low-symmetry conductor with a static electric field and\nis rooted in the quantum geometry of the material through the Berry curvature\ndipole. The chiral-gain material acts as an active medium for a particular\ncircular polarisation handedness, while serving as a passive, dissipative\nmedium for the other polarisation handedness. Owing to the nonreciprocity and\ngain characteristics, momentum is continuously exchanged in a preferred\ndirection parallel to the surface between the test particle and the surrounding\nelectromagnetic field, giving rise to lateral forces. Interestingly, the force\ncan be viewed as a fluctuation-induced drag linked to the nonlinear Hall\ncurrent. Indeed, although the gain is driven by an electric current, the\nresulting force acts perpendicular to the bias -- unlike conventional\ncurrent-drag effects. This effect stems from the skewed propagation\ncharacteristics of surface modes and gain-momentum locking. Our theory reveals\na Hall-like asymmetry in the field correlations and establishes a novel link\nbetween quantum geometry and fluctuation-induced phenomena, offering new\npossibilities for nanoscale control via tailored electromagnetic environments.",

We explore key developments in the construction of\nnon-static wormhole spacetimes, including those conformally related to static\nsolutions, as well as dynamically evolving geometries influenced by scalar\nfields. Particular attention is given to the wormholes embedded into\nFriedmann-Lema\\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universes and de Sitter\nbackgrounds, where the interplay between the cosmic expansion and wormhole\ndynamics is analyzed. We also examine the role of modified gravity theories,\nespecially in hybrid metric-Palatini gravity, which enable the realization of\ntraversable wormholes supported by effective stress-energy tensors that do not\nviolate the null or weak energy conditions. By systematically analyzing a wide\nrange of time-dependent wormhole solutions, this review identifies the specific\ngeometric and physical conditions under which wormholes can evolve consistently\nwith the null and weak energy conditions.

    "abstract": "Automated machine learning systems efficiently streamline model selection but\noften focus on a single best-performing model, overlooking explanation\nuncertainty, an essential concern in human centered explainable AI. To address\nthis, we propose a novel framework that incorporates model multiplicity into\nexplanation generation by aggregating partial dependence profiles (PDP) from a\nset of near optimal models, known as the Rashomon set. The resulting Rashomon\nPDP captures interpretive variability and highlights areas of disagreement,\nproviding users with a richer, uncertainty aware view of feature effects. To\nevaluate its usefulness, we introduce two quantitative metrics, the coverage\nrate and the mean width of confidence intervals, to evaluate the consistency\nbetween the standard PDP and the proposed Rashomon PDP. Experiments on 35\nregression datasets from the OpenML CTR23 benchmark suite show that in most\ncases, the Rashomon PDP covers less than 70% of the best model's PDP,\nunderscoring the limitations of single model explanations. Our findings suggest\nthat Rashomon PDP improves the reliability and trustworthiness of model\ninterpretations by adding additional information that would otherwise be\nneglected. This is particularly useful in high stakes domains where\ntransparency and confidence are critical.",

    "abstract": "Traffic monitoring is crucial for urban mobility, road safety, and\nintelligent transportation systems (ITS). Deep learning has advanced\nvideo-based traffic monitoring through video question answering (VideoQA)\nmodels, enabling structured insight extraction from traffic videos. However,\nexisting VideoQA models struggle with the complexity of real-world traffic\nscenes, where multiple concurrent events unfold across spatiotemporal\ndimensions. To address these challenges, this paper introduces \\textbf{InterAct\nVideoQA}, a curated dataset designed to benchmark and enhance VideoQA models\nfor traffic monitoring tasks. The InterAct VideoQA dataset comprises 8 hours of\nreal-world traffic footage collected from diverse intersections, segmented into\n10-second video clips, with over 25,000 question-answer (QA) pairs covering\nspatiotemporal dynamics, vehicle interactions, incident detection, and other\ncritical traffic attributes. State-of-the-art VideoQA models are evaluated on\nInterAct VideoQA, exposing challenges in reasoning over fine-grained\nspatiotemporal dependencies within complex traffic scenarios. Additionally,\nfine-tuning these models on InterAct VideoQA yields notable performance\nimprovements, demonstrating the necessity of domain-specific datasets for\nVideoQA. InterAct VideoQA is publicly available as a benchmark dataset to\nfacilitate future research in real-world deployable VideoQA models for\nintelligent transportation systems.

We introduce a formal pricing rule that\nquantifies and internalizes this intersectional privacy loss using mutual\ninformation, assigning monetary value to the entropy reduction induced by each\ndatum. The result is a Pigouvian-style surcharge that discourages harmful data\ntrades and rewards transparency. Our formulation has the advantage that it\noperates independently of the underlying statistical model of the\nintersectional variables, be it parametric, nonparametric, or learned, and can\nbe approximated in practice by discretizing the intersectional joint\nprobability distributions. We illustrate how regulators can calibrate this\nsurcharge to reflect different societal values, and argue that it provides not\njust a technical fix to market failures, but also a redistributive shield that\nempowers vulnerable groups in the face of asymmetric digital power.",

Specifically, trainable activation functions defined as ratios of\npolynomials (rational functions) have been proposed to enhance plasticity in\nreinforcement learning. However, their impact on training stability remains\nunclear. In this work, we study trainable rational activations in both\nreinforcement and continual learning settings. We find that while their\nflexibility enhances adaptability, it can also introduce instability, leading\nto overestimation in RL and feature collapse in longer continual learning\nscenarios. Our main result is demonstrating a trade-off between expressivity\nand plasticity in rational activations. To address this, we propose a\nconstrained variant that structurally limits excessive output scaling while\npreserving adaptability. Experiments across MetaWorld and DeepMind Control\nSuite (DMC) environments show that our approach improves training stability and\nperformance. In continual learning benchmarks, including MNIST with reshuffled\nlabels and Split CIFAR-100, we reveal how different constraints affect the\nbalance between expressivity and long-term retention. While preliminary\nexperiments in discrete action domains (e.g., Atari) did not show similar\ninstability, this suggests that the trade-off is particularly relevant for\ncontinuous control.

In this study, we present new empirical and modeling\ninsights into the biomechanics of load-pulling quadrupeds, using sprint sled\ndogs as a model system. High-speed video and force recordings reveal that sled\ndogs often switch between rotary and transverse galloping gaits within just a\nfew strides and without any observable changes in speed, stride duration, or\nterrain, providing clear evidence of locomotor multistability during high-speed\nload-pulling.

While the pipeline is\ndesigned to be general and widely applicable, we demonstrate its use on 678\nresearch articles focused on Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) and Extended\nReality (XR) as a case study. Consequently, The validated technology terms by\nRATE were mapped into a co-occurrence network, revealing thematic clusters and\nstructural features of the research landscape. For the purpose of evaluation, a\ngold standard dataset of technologies in 70 selected random articles had been\ncurated by the experts. In addition, a technology extraction model based on\nBidirectional Encoder Representations of Transformers (BERT) was used as a\ncomparative method.

This generalizes the\nclassical dispersion problem by requiring that agents maintain a minimum\ndistance of $k$ hops from each other, with the special case $k=1$ corresponding\nto the standard dispersion.\n  The contribution in this work is threefold. Our first contribution is a novel\nmethod that enables agents to simulate chirality using only local information,\nvision and bounded memory. This technique demonstrates that chirality is not a\nfundamental requirement for coordination in this model.\n  Building on this, our second contribution partially resolves an open question\nposed by Agarwalla et al.

We prove that\nD-$k$-D, and thus dispersion is solvable from any arbitrary configuration under\nthese assumptions (excluding vertex permutation dynamism)for any size of the\nring network which was earlier limited to only odd sized ring or to a ring of\nsize four.\n  Finally, we present an algorithm for D-$k$-D in this setting that works in\n$O(ln)$ rounds, completing the constructive side of our result.\n  Altogether, our findings significantly extend the theoretical understanding\nof mobile agent coordination in dynamic networks and clarify the role of\nchirality in distributed computation.",

Large language models (LLMs) have recently emerged as a\npromising heuristic for ATP, but they lack correctness guarantees and thus\nrequire interaction with a proof verifier. Such interactions typically follow\none of two approaches: black-box interaction, which does not utilize\nintermediate proof states, or white-box approaches, which allow for incremental\nproof construction and examination of intermediate states. While black-box\napproaches have directly benefited from recent LLM advances, white-box methods\nhave comparatively lagged behind. In this paper, we address this gap by\nintroducing LeanTree, which consists of (i) a tool built in the Lean 4 language\nthat factorizes complex proof states into simpler, independent branches, and\n(ii) a dataset of these factorized intermediate states. Our white-box tooling\noffers several advantages over black-box approaches: it simplifies evaluation,\nreduces necessary context, generates richer training data, enables parallel\nsearch across multiple states, supports efficient reuse of states, and provides\nfeedback in case of errors. Our preliminary results hint that white-box\napproaches outperform black-box alternatives in some settings.",

    "abstract": "This study addresses the problem of occluded grasping, where primary grasp\nconfigurations of an object are not available due to occlusion with\nenvironment. Simple parallel grippers often struggle with such tasks due to\nlimited dexterity and actuation constraints. Prior works have explored object\npose reorientation such as pivoting by utilizing extrinsic contacts between an\nobject and an environment feature like a wall, to make the object graspable.\nHowever, such works often assume the presence of a short wall, and this\nassumption may not always hold in real-world scenarios. If the wall available\nfor interaction is too large or too tall, the robot may still fail to grasp the\nobject even after pivoting, and the robot must combine different types of\nactions to grasp. To address this, we propose a hierarchical reinforcement\nlearning (RL) framework. We use Q-learning to train a high-level policy that\nselects the type of action expected to yield the highest reward. The selected\nlow-level skill then samples a specific robot action in continuous space. To\nguide the robot to an appropriate location for executing the selected action,\nwe adopt a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE). We condition the CVAE on\nthe object point cloud and the skill ID, enabling it to infer a suitable\nlocation based on the object geometry and the selected skill. To promote\ngeneralization, we apply domain randomization during the training of low-level\nskills. The RL policy is trained entirely in simulation with a box-like object\nand deployed to six objects in real world. We conduct experiments to evaluate\nour method and demonstrate both its generalizability and robust sim-to-real\ntransfer performance with promising success rates.",

Given the\nsignificant investments by PE firms in the healthcare sector in recent years,\nthese are important research questions. Stakeholders, including policy makers,\ncare providers, and patients, need to understand their likely impact and\nwhether PE ownership is aligned with their interests. Using a staggered\ndifference-in-differences approach and data from US hospitals from 2008-2020,\nwe observe that the overall value of healthcare delivered by hospitals declines\nafter PE investment.

Our research also identifies the underlying mechanisms through which\nhealth information sharing improves care value by reducing hospital-acquired\ninfections and readmission rates, thereby improving care quality, and enhancing\nlabor productivity by reducing operating costs. Our results highlight the\ncritical role of policies and common data standards needed to promote\nIT-enabled information sharing between healthcare providers, which, in turn,\ncan align incentives of PE firms with the goals of value-based care.",

Using this data, we evaluate\nfive scheduling policies and their impact on both real-time metrics (e.g.,\ndeadline violation rate) and LLM performance (e.g., time-to-first-token and\ntokens-per-second). Our results show that scheduling decisions significantly\naffect workload performance (e.g., leading to a 41.7% difference in deadline\nviolation rates on average), and highlight the need for scheduling strategies\nthat are aware of workload dynamics and hardware heterogeneity. Our findings\nunderscore the importance of workload-aware, dynamic heterogeneous scheduling\nin enabling high-performance, on-device RTGen applications.",

While the test was ultimately\nsuccessful, it ignited a firestorm of concern and criticism among astronomers\nand ultimately influenced the framing of the United Nations Outer Space Treaty.\nHere we examine the history of Project West Ford as it prompted astronomers to\nreact, comparing it with the ongoing problem of the potential impact of large\nsatellite constellations on astronomical research.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Hyperthermia (HT), characterized by elevated tissue temperatures\nabove physiological levels, is a well-established radiosensitizer. When\ncombined with radiotherapy (RT), forming thermoradiotherapy (TRT), a\nsynergistic effect is observed across in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies.\nThe greatest radiosensitization occurs when HT and RT are applied\nsimultaneously. This work aims to explore physical mechanisms -- beyond DNA\nrepair inhibition -- that contribute to this synergy.\n  Approach: We developed a biophysical model for the thermal enhancement ratio\n(TER), incorporating temperature-dependent variations in the number of\nvulnerable DNA sites, the DNA-ion/particle interaction cross-section, and other\nphysicochemical parameters. These include ion production rate, diffusion\nprocesses, and medium density. The model includes misrepair effects\nphenomenologically, which make it consistent with other studies.\n  Main results: The model reproduces TER values observed under simultaneous HT\nand RT in isolated plasmids with variable temperature. Our results indicate\nthat, in addition to misrepair, other physical factors contribute to\nradiosensitization under concurrent treatment. Among these, the\ntemperature-dependent amplification of DNA-ion/particle interaction\ncross-section -- driven by enhanced DNA thermal fluctuations structure --\nemerges as the second most influential factor.\n  Significance: These findings suggest that thermal radiosensitization arises\nnot only from impaired repair, but also from increased physical vulnerability\nof the DNA. The model provides mechanistic insight for optimizing TRT\nparameters.",

Using an average dispersion measure (DM) of 529.2\npc cm$^{-3}$, burst-clusters were classified into Downward Drifting, Upward\nDrifting, No Drifting, No Evidence for Drifting, Not-Clear, and Complex\ncategories. Notably, 233 (23.82%) of the 978 drifting burst-clusters showed\nupward drifting. Excluding 142 upward drifting single-component clusters, the\nremaining 91 upward drifting double- or multiple-components clusters account\nfor 10.89% of the drifting sample. Further restricting to those with\nconsecutive time intervals, only 9 upward drifting bursts remain. An inverse\ncorrelation is found between drifting rate and sub-burst effective width.\nUpward drifting single-component clusters tend to have smaller effective\nwidths, bandwidths, and fluxes than downward drifting ones. For these upward\ndrifting clusters, drifting rate increases with peak frequency. A\nKolmogorov-Smirnov test reveals longer consecutive intervals in upward drifting\nclusters compared to downward ones, suggesting differing underlying mechanisms.",

However,\neffective kinematic control remains highly challenging, as it must handle\ndeformations caused by unknown external loads and avoid actuator saturation due\nto improper null-space regulation - particularly in confined environments. In\nthis paper, we propose a Sensor-Space Imitation Learning Kinematic Control\n(SS-ILKC) framework to enable robust kinematic control under actuator\nsaturation and restrictive environmental constraints. We employ a dual-learning\nstrategy: a multi-goal sensor-space control framework based on reinforcement\nlearning principle is trained in simulation to develop robust control policies\nfor open spaces, while a generative adversarial imitation learning approach\nenables effective policy learning from sparse expert demonstrations for\nconfined spaces. To enable zero-shot real-world deployment, a pre-processed\nsim-to-real transfer mechanism is proposed to mitigate the\nsimulation-to-reality gap and accurately characterize actuator saturation\nlimits. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can effectively\ncontrol a pneumatically actuated soft manipulator, achieving precise\npath-following and object manipulation in confined environments under unknown\nloading conditions.",

Assuming typical values of radio efficiency and beaming factor, the\nestimated total isotropic burst energy of this source exceeds 86% of the\ndipolar magnetic energy of a typical magnetar. The total released energy from\nthis source exceeds that of other known repeaters by about one and a half\norders of magnitude, yielding the most stringent lower limit of\n$4.7\\times10^{32}$ G cm$^3$ for the magnetar's magnetic moment.

    "abstract": "Detecting fraudulent credit card transactions remains a significant\nchallenge, due to the extreme class imbalance in real-world data and the often\nsubtle patterns that separate fraud from legitimate activity. Existing research\ncommonly attempts to address this by generating synthetic samples for the\nminority class using approaches such as GANs, VAEs, or hybrid generative\nmodels. However, these techniques, particularly when applied only to\nminority-class data, tend to result in overconfident classifiers and poor\nlatent cluster separation, ultimately limiting real-world detection\nperformance. In this study, we propose the Causal Prototype Attention\nClassifier (CPAC), an interpretable architecture that promotes class-aware\nclustering and improved latent space structure through prototype-based\nattention mechanisms and we will couple it with the encoder in a VAE-GAN\nallowing it to offer a better cluster separation moving beyond post-hoc sample\naugmentation. We compared CPAC-augmented models to traditional oversamplers,\nsuch as SMOTE, as well as to state-of-the-art generative models, both with and\nwithout CPAC-based latent classifiers. Our results show that classifier-guided\nlatent shaping with CPAC delivers superior performance, achieving an F1-score\nof 93.14\\% percent and recall of 90.18\\%, along with improved latent cluster\nseparation. Further ablation studies and visualizations provide deeper insight\ninto the benefits and limitations of classifier-driven representation learning\nfor fraud detection.

    "abstract": "Large-language-model (LLM) agents exhibit complex, context-sensitive\nbehaviour that quickly renders static benchmarks and ad-hoc manual testing\nobsolete.\n  We present Neo, a configurable, multi-agent framework that automates\nrealistic, multi-turn evaluation of LLM-based systems. Neo couples a Question\nGeneration Agent and an Evaluation Agent through a shared context-hub, allowing\ndomain prompts, scenario controls and dynamic feedback to be composed\nmodularly. Test inputs are sampled from a probabilistic state model spanning\ndialogue flow, user intent and emotional tone, enabling diverse, human-like\nconversations that adapt after every turn.\n  Applied to a production-grade Seller Financial Assistant chatbot, Neo (i)\nuncovered edge-case failures across five attack categories with a 3.3% break\nrate close to the 5.8% achieved by expert human red-teamers, and (ii) delivered\n10-12X higher throughput, generating 180 coherent test questions in around 45\nmins versus 16h of human effort. Beyond security probing, Neo's stochastic\npolicies balanced topic coverage and conversational depth, yielding broader\nbehavioural exploration than manually crafted scripts.\n  Neo therefore lays a foundation for scalable, self-evolving LLM QA: its agent\ninterfaces, state controller and feedback loops are model-agnostic and\nextensible to richer factual-grounding and policy-compliance checks. We release\nthe framework to facilitate reproducible, high-fidelity testing of emerging\nagentic systems.",

To this end, we use ANSYS HFSS, a commercial electromagnetic (EM)\nsimulation software suitable for the numerical optimization of antenna systems.\nHFSS is used to obtain an accurate model of the cellphone MIMO antenna array\nand HFSS SBR+ is utilized to obtain channel matrices for a large number of\nusers. Taking advantage of linear and optimal processing at the cellphone, we\nestimate the outage probability curves. The curves are then used to determine\nthe diversity gain in a moderate signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime and the\nmultiplexing gain at a high SNR regime. This approach is then compared with the\nmethod of estimating the diversity gain from the envelope correlation\ncoefficients or the beam-coupling matrix showing substantial differences in the\ntwo methodologies.",

Instead of mapping the model to a free\nmassive scalar field, we construct a net of local observable algebras directly\nfrom the gauge-theoretic content, subject to the local ${U(1)}$ gauge symmetry\nand Gauss's law constraint. We show that local algebras can be consistently\ndefined in terms of gauge-invariant composite operators, while charged fields\nnecessarily fail to be localizable in bounded regions, manifesting confinement\nas the absence of DHR superselection sectors. Furthermore, we rigorously\ncharacterize nonlocal observables such as Wilson line operators within an\nextended net, and demonstrate the violation of Haag duality as a signature of\nthe nontrivial topological and gauge structure of the theory. We additionally\npropose a conjecture linking the violation of Haag duality in confining gauge\ntheories to a breakdown in entanglement wedge reconstruction, suggesting that\nconfinement obstructs the local recovery of quantum information. Our approach\nprovides a complete AQFT-based treatment of confinement, Gauss law, and\nnonlocal gauge-invariant operators in a solvable gauge theory, laying the\ngroundwork for future extensions to non-Abelian models like QCD.",

This paper proposes SST-CL, a\nnovel framework integrating spatial-temporal transformers with curriculum\nlearning. Our method introduces two core components: a spatial encoder that\nmodels inter-channel relationships and a temporal encoder that captures\nmulti-scale dependencies through windowed attention mechanisms, enabling\nsimultaneous extraction of spatial correlations and temporal dynamics from EEG\nsignals. Complementing this architecture, an intensity-aware curriculum\nlearning strategy progressively guides training from high-intensity to\nlow-intensity emotional states through dynamic sample scheduling based on a\ndual difficulty assessment.

However, the impact of\ndwarf-dwarf mergers on star formation (SF) is less understood. In this context,\nwe study SF in 6,155 isolated dwarf galaxies (no massive galaxy, $M_{*} >\n10^{10} M_{\\odot}$, within 1 Mpc$^3$), including 194 post-mergers and 5,961\nnon-interacting galaxies, spanning stellar masses of $10^7$ - $10^{9.6}$\nM$_{\\odot}$ and redshifts of 0.01 - 0.12. Post-mergers sample is from a\nprevious study, which used deep optical images to identify dwarf galaxies with\nmerger signatures. Using GALEX FUV data, we estimate star formation rates\n(SFRs) and find difference in log(SFR) between a post-merger galaxy and the\nmedian of its corresponding control sample, matched in stellar mass and\nredshift. SFR offsets range from -2 to +2 dex, indicating both enhancement and\nsuppression of SF in our sample with 67% of post-mergers showing enhancement.\nThe median SFR is found to be elevated by 0.24 dex ($\\sim$1.73 times) in\npost-mergers, comparable to enhancements seen in massive galaxies. SF is found\nto be similarly enhanced in both the central (6\" diameter region) and outer\nregions of post-mergers with respect to their non-interacting counterparts.\nThis is in contrast to what is observed in massive galaxies, where the\nmerger-triggered SF is more significant in the central regions. In the given\nsmall range of redshift, post-merger dwarfs exhibit a higher median specific\nSFR compared to their non-interacting counterparts. About 33% of post-mergers\nare quenched, possibly reflecting a later stage of the post-merger regime,\nwhere quenching can happen as observed in massive galaxies. This study suggests\nthat dwarf-dwarf mergers can affect SF in the local universe. A more\ncomprehensive study of post-merger dwarfs is required to understand their\nevolution.",

We analyze one sixth order and two eighth order\ncompact spatial discretization schemes, encompassing both node centered and\ncell centered formulations, combined with a third order strong stability\npreserving Runge Kutta (SSPRK3) time integrator.

Critical\ndispersion thresholds and Courant numbers are identified, beyond which\nnumerical instability and nonphysical phenomena such as spurious q waves and\nreversed phase or energy transport arise. Theoretical predictions are validated\nthrough numerical experiments involving linear and nonlinear one and two\ndimensional test problems, including cases with exact solutions and established\nbenchmark results. This comprehensive analysis uncovers subtle numerical errors\nand offers practical guidance for selecting reliable discretization parameters,\nensuring accurate and stable simulations of convection dispersion systems.",

    "abstract": "Universal quantum computing requires the ability to perform every unitary\noperation, i.e., evolution operator controllability. In view of developing\nresource-efficient quantum processing units (QPUs), it is important to\ndetermine how many local controls and qubit-qubit couplings are required for\ncontrollability. Unfortunately, assessing the controllability of large qubit\narrays is a difficult task, due to the exponential scaling of Hilbert space\ndimension. Here we show that it is sufficient to connect two qubit arrays that\nare evolution operator controllable by a single entangling two-qubit gate in\norder to obtain a composite qubit array that is evolution operator\ncontrollable. Our proof provides a template to build up modular QPUs from\nsmaller building blocks with reduced numbers of local controls and couplings.\nWe illustrate the approach with two examples, consisting of 10, respectively\n127 qubits, inspired by IBM quantum processors.",

Variable selection methods developed for full cohort data do\nnot extend naturally to stratified sampling designs, and appropriate\nadjustments for the sampling scheme are necessary. Further challenges arise\nwhen the failure times are clustered and exhibit within-cluster dependence. As\nan alternative of Cox proportional hazards (PH) model when the PH assumption is\nnot valid, the penalized Buckley-James (BJ) estimating method for accelerated\nfailure time (AFT) models can potentially handle within-cluster correlation in\nsuch setting by incorporating generalized estimating equation (GEE) techniques,\nthough its practical implementation remains hindered by computational\ninstability. We propose a regularized estimating method within the GEE\nframework for stratified sampling designs, in the spirit of the penalized BJ\nmethod but with a reliable inference procedure. We establish the consistency\nand asymptotic normality of the proposed estimators and show that they achieve\nthe oracle property. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate that our method\noutperforms existing methods that ignore sampling bias or within-cluster\ndependence. Moreover, the regularization scheme effectively selects relevant\nvariables even with moderate sample sizes. The proposed methodology is\nillustrated through applications to a dental study.",

Meanwhile, conventional GSR\nmodels often lack generalization ability, falling short in recognizing unseen\nand rare situations. In this paper, we exploit transferring knowledge from a\nteacher MLLM to a small GSR model to enhance its generalization and zero-shot\nabilities, thereby introducing the task of Open-vocabulary Grounded Situation\nRecognition (Ov-GSR). To achieve this, we propose Multimodal Interactive Prompt\nDistillation (MIPD), a novel framework that distills enriched multimodal\nknowledge from the foundation model, enabling the student Ov-GSR model to\nrecognize unseen situations and be better aware of rare situations.\nSpecifically, the MIPD framework first leverages the LLM-based Judgmental\nRationales Generator (JRG) to construct positive and negative glimpse and gaze\nrationales enriched with contextual semantic information. The proposed\nscene-aware and instance-perception prompts are then introduced to align\nrationales with visual information from the MLLM teacher via the\nNegative-Guided Multimodal Prompting Alignment (NMPA) module, effectively\ncapturing holistic and perceptual multimodal knowledge. Finally, the aligned\nmultimodal knowledge is distilled into the student Ov-GSR model, providing a\nstronger foundation for generalization that enhances situation understanding,\nbridges the gap between seen and unseen scenarios, and mitigates prediction\nbias in rare cases. We evaluate MIPD on the refined Ov-SWiG dataset, achieving\nsuperior performance on seen, rare, and unseen situations, and further\ndemonstrate improved unseen detection on the HICO-DET dataset.",

This work addresses two principal challenges: adversarial\nstrategies employed by spammers and the scarcity of labeled data. We propose a\nnovel spam-text detection framework GCC-Spam, which integrates three core\ninnovations. First, a character similarity network captures orthographic and\nphonetic features to counter character-obfuscation attacks and furthermore\nproduces sentence embeddings for downstream classification. Second, contrastive\nlearning enhances discriminability by optimizing the latent-space distance\nbetween spam and normal texts. Third, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)\ngenerates realistic pseudo-spam samples to alleviate data scarcity while\nimproving model robustness and classification accuracy. Extensive experiments\non real-world datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms baseline\napproaches, achieving higher detection rates with significantly fewer labeled\nexamples.",

    "abstract": "The superiority of graph contrastive learning (GCL) has prompted its\napplication to anomaly detection tasks for more powerful risk warning systems.\nUnfortunately, existing GCL-based models tend to excessively prioritize overall\ndetection performance while neglecting robustness to structural imbalance,\nwhich can be problematic for many real-world networks following power-law\ndegree distributions. Particularly, GCL-based methods may fail to capture tail\nanomalies (abnormal nodes with low degrees). This raises concerns about the\nsecurity and robustness of current anomaly detection algorithms and therefore\nhinders their applicability in a variety of realistic high-risk scenarios. To\nthe best of our knowledge, research on the robustness of graph anomaly\ndetection to structural imbalance has received little scrutiny. To address the\nabove issues, this paper presents a novel GCL-based framework named AD-GCL. It\ndevises the neighbor pruning strategy to filter noisy edges for head nodes and\nfacilitate the detection of genuine tail nodes by aligning from head nodes to\nforged tail nodes. Moreover, AD-GCL actively explores potential neighbors to\nenlarge the receptive field of tail nodes through anomaly-guided neighbor\ncompletion. We further introduce intra- and inter-view consistency loss of the\noriginal and augmentation graph for enhanced representation. The performance\nevaluation of the whole, head, and tail nodes on multiple datasets validates\nthe comprehensive superiority of the proposed AD-GCL in detecting both head\nanomalies and tail anomalies.",

    "abstract": "Given a discrete spatial structure $X$, we define continuous-time branching\nprocesses that model a population breeding and dying on $X$. These processes\nare usually called branching random walks. They are characterized by breeding\nrates $k_{xy}$ (governing the rate at which individuals at $x$ send offspring\nto $y$), and by a multiplicative speed parameter $\\lambda$. These processes\nalso serve as models for epidemic spreading, where $\\lambda k_{xy}$ represents\nthe infection rate from $x$ to $y$. Two critical parameters of interest are the\nglobal critical parameter $\\lambda_w$, related to global survival, and the\nlocal critical parameter $\\lambda_s$, related to survival within finite sets\n(with $\\lambda_w\\le\\lambda_s$). In disease control, the primary goal is to\nlower $\\lambda$ so that the process dies out, at least locally. Nevertheless, a\nprocess that survives globally can still pose a threat, especially if sudden\nchanges cause global survival to transition into local survival. In fact, local\nmodifications to the rates can affect the values of both critical parameters,\nmaking it important to understand when and how they can be increased. Using\nresults on the comparison of extinction probabilities for a single branching\nrandom walk across different sets, we extend the analysis to extinction\nprobabilities and critical parameters of pairs of branching random walks whose\nrates coincide outside a fixed set $A \\subseteq X$. We say that two branching\nrandom walks are equivalent if their rates coincide everywhere except on a\nfinite subset of $X$. Given an equivalence class of branching random walks, we\nprove that if one process has $\\lambda^*_w \\neq \\lambda^*_s$, then\n$\\lambda^*_w$ is the maximal possible value of this parameter within the class.\nWe describe the possible configurations for the critical parameters within\nthese equivalence classes.",

We\nsimulate both steps of the pump-probe experiment conducted on Na$^+$\n[Albrechtsen et al., Nature 623, 319 (2023)], where the alkali atom residing at\nthe droplet surface is ionized by the pump pulse and its solvation is probed by\nionizing a central xenon atom and detecting the expulsed Na$^+$He$_n$ ions. Our\nresults confirm the Poissonian model for the binding of the first five He atoms\nfor the lighter Na$^+$ and K$^+$ alkalis, with a rate in good agreement with\nthe more recent experimental results on Na$^+$ [Albrechtsen et al., J. Chem.\nPhys. 162, 174309 (2025)]. For the probe step we show that the ion takes\nseveral picoseconds to get out of the droplet. During this rather long time,\nthe solvation structure around it is very hot and far from equilibrium, and it\ncan gain or lose more He atoms. Surprisingly, analysing the Na$^+$ solvation\nstructure energy reveals that it is not stable by itself during the first few\npicoseconds of the solvation process. After that, energy relaxation follows a\nNewton behavior, as found experimentally, but with a longer time delay,\n$5.0\\leq t_0\\leq 6.5$ ps vs. $0.23\\pm0.06$ ps, and characteristic decay time,\n$7.3\\le\\tau\\le 16.5$ ps vs. $2.6\\pm 0.4$ ps. We conclude that the first\ninstants of the solvation process are highly turbulent and that the solvation\nstructure is stabilized only by the surrounding helium ``solvent''.",

In this work, we broaden the scope by\ntheoretically investigating the behavior of the superconducting order parameter\n(OP) across a wide class of aperiodic systems, including both generalized\nFibonacci and non-Fibonacci QCs based on the attractive Hubbard model. We begin\nwith a one-dimensional toy model, and for the generality of our findings, we\nextend our analysis to two-dimensional QCs. Remarkably, despite the increased\ndimensionality, the qualitative features of the OP remain largely preserved. By\nsystematically analyzing models generated through various growth rules, we\nelucidate the influence of quasiperiodicity on the OP amplitudes. We study the\nevolution of the OP with respect to the temperature, strength of the\ninteraction, and nearest-neighbor hopping amplitude. Our numerical analysis\nidentifies the most favorable QC structure and parameter regime that supports\nenhanced onsite pairing amplitudes. Additionally, we provide a comparative\nanalysis of the superconducting transition temperatures across the range of\nquasiperiodic configurations. To gain further insight into these systems, we\ncompute key thermodynamic quantities: the entropy and electronic specific heat,\nand examine their dependence on the underlying structural sequences.

However,\nexisting methods often underutilize the cross-modal representation alignment\nbetween histopathology images and gene expression profiles across multiple\nrepresentational levels, thereby limiting their prediction performance. To\naddress this, we propose Gene-DML, a unified framework that structures latent\nspace through Dual-pathway Multi-Level discrimination to enhance correspondence\nbetween morphological and transcriptional modalities. The multi-scale\ninstance-level discrimination pathway aligns hierarchical histopathology\nrepresentations extracted at local, neighbor, and global levels with gene\nexpression profiles, capturing scale-aware morphological-transcriptional\nrelationships. In parallel, the cross-level instance-group discrimination\npathway enforces structural consistency between individual (image/gene)\ninstances and modality-crossed (gene/image, respectively) groups, strengthening\nthe alignment across modalities. By jointly modelling fine-grained and\nstructural-level discrimination, Gene-DML is able to learn robust cross-modal\nrepresentations, enhancing both predictive accuracy and generalization across\ndiverse biological contexts. Extensive experiments on public spatial\ntranscriptomics datasets demonstrate that Gene-DML achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance in gene expression prediction.

However, most of current\nmethodologies require to use specially designed luminescent labels, which not\nonly may affect the properties of the sample itself, but often are\n(photo)toxic, susceptible to photobleaching, offer limited color combinations\nor specificity of labeling. Moreover, the dedicated fluorescence based\nsuper-resolution optical techniques are often technically complex and\ncumbersome to use.

The\ntransmission avalanche backlight (TAB) microscopy exploits huge optical\nnon-linearities of photon avalanching materials, which are acting as a virtual\nnear-field nano aperture - a diffraction limited backlight of the actual\nsample. Such approach enables to augment imaging contrast of highly transparent\nsamples and thin layers, by translating small attenuation and scattering loses\noccurring on these translucent samples into amplified modulation of\nluminescence intensity of the avalanche backlighted substrate (ABS). At no\nadditional cost, sub-diffraction imaging is achieved with simple, single beam\nlaser scanning microscopy setup, leading to ca. 70 nm optical resolution.

    "abstract": "We present a comprehensive analysis of 32 type II supernovae (SNe II) with\nplateau phase photometry and late phase ($nebular$) spectroscopy available,\naiming to bridge the gap between the surface and core of their red supergiant\n(RSG) progenitors. Using \\texttt{MESA}\\,+\\texttt{STELLA}, we compute an\nextensive grid of SN II light curve models originating from RSG with effective\ntemperatures $T_{\\rm eff}$ around 3650\\,K and hydrogen-rich envelopes\nartificially stripped to varying degrees. These models are then used to derive\nthe hydrogen-rich envelope masses $M_{\\rm Henv}$ for SNe II from their plateau\nphase light curves. Nebular spectroscopy further constrains the progenitor\nRSG's luminosity log\\,$L_{\\rm prog}$, and is employed to remove the\ndegeneracies in light curve modeling. The comparison between log\\,$L_{\\rm\nprog}$-$M_{\\rm Henv}$ reveals that $M_{\\rm Henv}$ spans a broad range at the\nsame log\\,$L_{\\rm prog}$, and almost all SNe II have lower $M_{\\rm Henv}$ than\nthe prediction of the default stellar wind models. We explore alternative wind\nprescriptions, binary evolution models, and the possibility of more compact RSG\nprogenitors. Although binary interaction offers a compelling explanation for\nthe non-monotonicity and large scatter in the log\\,$L_{\\rm prog}$-$M_{\\rm\nHenv}$ relation, the high occurrence rate of partially-stripped RSGs cannot be\naccounted for by stable binary mass transfer alone without fine-tuned orbital\nparameters. This highlights that, despite being the most commonly observed\nclass of core-collapse SNe, SNe II likely originate from a variety of mass-loss\nhistories and evolutionary pathways that are more diverse and complex than\ntypically assumed in standard stellar evolution models.",

    "abstract": "Studies of subradiance in a chain N two-level atoms in the single excitation\nregime focused mainly on the complex spectrum of the effective Hamiltonian,\nidentifying subradiant eigenvalues. This can be achieved by finding the\neigenvalues $N$ of the Hamiltonian or by evaluating the expectation value of\nthe Hamiltonian on a generalized Dicke state, depending on a continuous\nvariable k. This has the advantage that the sum above N can be calculated\nexactly, such that N becomes a simple parameter of the system and no more the\nsize of the Hilbert space. However, the question remains how subradiance\nemerges from atoms initially excited or driven by a laser. Here we study the\ndynamics of the system, solving the coupled-dipole equations for N atoms and\nevaluating the probability to be in a generalized Dicke state at a given time.\nOnce the subradiant regions has been identified, it is simple to see if\nsubradiance is being generated. We discuss different initial excitation\nconditions that lead to subradiance and the case of atoms excited by switching\non and off a weak laser. This may be relevant for future experiments aimed at\ndetecting subradiance in ordered systems.",

This study\npresents a cost-effective computer vision framework that estimates plate-level\nfood waste by utilizing semantic segmentation of RGB images taken before and\nafter meal consumption across five Iranian dishes. Four fully supervised models\n(U-Net, U-Net++, and their lightweight variants) were trained using a capped\ndynamic inverse-frequency loss and AdamW optimizer, then evaluated through a\ncomprehensive set of metrics, including Pixel Accuracy, Dice, IoU, and a\ncustom-defined Distributional Pixel Agreement (DPA) metric tailored to the\ntask. All models achieved satisfying performance, and for each food type, at\nleast one model approached or surpassed 90% DPA, demonstrating strong alignment\nin pixel-wise proportion estimates. Lighter models with reduced parameter\ncounts offered faster inference, achieving real-time throughput on an NVIDIA T4\nGPU. Further analysis showed superior segmentation performance for dry and more\nrigid components (e.g., rice and fries), while more complex, fragmented, or\nviscous dishes, such as stews, showed reduced performance, specifically\npost-consumption. Despite limitations such as reliance on 2D imaging,\nconstrained food variety, and manual data collection, the proposed framework is\npioneering and represents a scalable, contactless solution for continuous\nmonitoring of food consumption.

Despite its significance in numerous\napplications, theory on the effectiveness of SSDA remains largely unexplored,\nparticularly in scenarios involving various types of source-target\ndistributional shifts. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework based\non structural causal models (SCMs) which allows us to analyze and quantify the\nperformance of SSDA methods when labeled target data is limited. Within this\nframework, we introduce three SSDA methods, each having a fine-tuning strategy\ntailored to a distinct assumption about the source and target relationship.\nUnder each assumption, we demonstrate how extending an unsupervised domain\nadaptation (UDA) method to SSDA can achieve minimax-optimal target performance\nwith limited target labels. When the relationship between source and target\ndata is only vaguely known -- a common practical concern -- we propose the\nMulti Adaptive-Start Fine-Tuning (MASFT) algorithm, which fine-tunes UDA models\nfrom multiple starting points and selects the best-performing one based on a\nsmall hold-out target validation dataset.

In fact, this has historically been how tensor networks for\ngapped ground states, such as the matrix product state (MPS) and the projected\nentangled paired state, emerged as an elegant analytical framework from\nnumerical techniques like the density matrix renormalization group. However,\nfor gapless ground states, generically described by the multiscale entanglement\nrenormalization ansatz (MERA), a corresponding exactly solvable model has so\nfar been missing.

However, HMC techniques\nare computationally demanding for Bayesian neural networks due to the high\ndimensionality of the network's parameter space and the non-convexity of their\nposterior distributions. Therefore, various approximation techniques, such as\nvariational inference (VI) or stochastic gradient MCMC, are often employed to\ninfer the posterior distribution of the network parameters. Such approximations\nintroduce inaccuracies in the inferred distributions, resulting in unreliable\nuncertainty estimates. In this work, we propose a hybrid approach that combines\ninexpensive VI and accurate HMC methods to efficiently and accurately quantify\nuncertainties in neural networks and neural operators. The proposed approach\nleverages an initial VI training on the full network. We examine the influence\nof individual parameters on the prediction uncertainty, which shows that a\nlarge proportion of the parameters do not contribute substantially to\nuncertainty in the network predictions. This information is then used to\nsignificantly reduce the dimension of the parameter space, and HMC is performed\nonly for the subset of network parameters that strongly influence prediction\nuncertainties. This yields a framework for accelerating the full batch HMC for\nposterior inference in neural networks. We demonstrate the efficiency and\naccuracy of the proposed framework on deep neural networks and operator\nnetworks, showing that inference can be performed for large networks with tens\nto hundreds of thousands of parameters.

However, several challenges remain for their efficient deployment on\nresource-constrained edge devices. The hybrid models suffer from a widely\ndiverse set of NN layer types and large intermediate data tensors, hampering\nefficient hardware acceleration. To enable their execution at the edge, this\npaper proposes innovations across the hardware-scheduling stack: a.) At the\nlowest level, a configurable PE array supports all hybrid ViT layer types; b.)\ntemporal loop re-ordering within one layer, enabling hardware support for\nnormalization and softmax layers, minimizing on-chip data transfers; c.)\nfurther scheduling optimization employs layer fusion across inverted bottleneck\nlayers to drastically reduce off-chip memory transfers. The resulting\naccelerator is implemented in 28nm CMOS, achieving a peak energy efficiency of\n1.39 TOPS/W at 25.6 GMACs/s.",

In this paper, we\nshow the foldover technique is even more powerful, because it produces degrees\nof freedom for a variance estimator that is independent of model selection.\nThese degrees of freedom are characterized as either pure error or fake factor\ndegrees of freedom. A fast design construction algorithm is presented that\nminimizes the expected confidence interval criterion to maximize the power of\nscreening main effects. An augmented design and analysis method is also\npresented to avoid having too many degrees of freedom for estimating variance\nand to improve model selection performance for second order models.

Although chemical cohesive bonding has been observed in\nasteroid samples, and low-speed impact has been a subject of many studies, our\nunderstanding of the role of cohesion in these dynamics is limited, especially\nat small gravities such as those observed on asteroid surfaces. In this work,\nwe use numerical discrete element method (DEM) and analytical dynamic resistive\nforce theory (DRFT) modeling to examine the effect of cohesion on the outcome\nof the impact into loose granular media and explore scaling laws that predict\nimpact behavior in the presence of cohesion under various gravitational\nconditions and cohesive strengths. We find that the effect of cohesion on the\nimpact behavior becomes more significant in smaller gravitational acceleration,\nraising the need to scale the cohesion coefficient with gravity. We find that\ndue to an insufficient understanding of confounding between cohesion and\nfriction-induced quasi-static and inertial resistance, the outcomes of the DEM\nsimulation models are incongruent with a suggested analytic model using Froude\nand Bond number scaling based on an additive contribution of frictional and\ninertial forces.

Addressing these\nissues, a novel Multispectral State-Space Feature Fusion framework, dubbed\nMS2Fusion, is proposed based on the state space model (SSM), achieving\nefficient and effective fusion through a dual-path parametric interaction\nmechanism. More specifically, the first cross-parameter interaction branch\ninherits the advantage of cross-attention in mining complementary information\nwith cross-modal hidden state decoding in SSM. The second shared-parameter\nbranch explores cross-modal alignment with joint embedding to obtain\ncross-modal similar semantic features and structures through parameter sharing\nin SSM. Finally, these two paths are jointly optimized with SSM for fusing\nmultispectral features in a unified framework, allowing our MS2Fusion to enjoy\nboth functional complementarity and shared semantic space. In our extensive\nexperiments on mainstream benchmarks including FLIR, M3FD and LLVIP, our\nMS2Fusion significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art multispectral object\ndetection methods, evidencing its superiority. Moreover, MS2Fusion is general\nand applicable to other multispectral perception tasks.

    "abstract": "Story point estimation is an essential part of agile software development.\nStory points are unitless, project-specific effort estimates that help\ndevelopers plan their sprints. Traditionally, developers estimate story points\ncollaboratively using planning poker or other manual techniques. While the\ninitial calibrating of the estimates to each project is helpful, once a team\nhas converged on a set of precedents, story point estimation can become tedious\nand labor-intensive. Machine learning can reduce this burden, but only with\nenough context from the historical decisions made by the project team. That is,\nstate-of-the-art models, such as GPT2SP and FastText-SVM, only make accurate\npredictions (within-project) when trained on data from the same project. The\ngoal of this work is to streamline story point estimation by evaluating a\ncomparative learning-based framework for calibrating project-specific story\npoint prediction models. Instead of assigning a specific story point value to\nevery backlog item, developers are presented with pairs of items, and indicate\nwhich item requires more effort. Using these comparative judgments, a machine\nlearning model is trained to predict the story point estimates. We empirically\nevaluated our technique using data with 23,313 manual estimates in 16 projects.\nThe model learned from comparative judgments can achieve on average 0.34\nSpearman's rank correlation coefficient between its predictions and the ground\ntruth story points. This is similar to, if not better than, the performance of\na regression model learned from the ground truth story points. Therefore, the\nproposed comparative learning approach is more efficient than state-of-the-art\nregression-based approaches according to the law of comparative judgments -\nproviding comparative judgments yields a lower cognitive burden on humans than\nproviding ratings or categorical labels.",

To counter the resulting high dimensionality, we apply\ndimensionality reduction using principal--component analysis (PCA) on\nconcatenated protein features, and rebalance the training data via a\nsimilarity-based oversampling strategy. KinForm outperforms baseline methods on\ntwo benchmark datasets. Improvements are most pronounced in low sequence\nsimilarity bins.

Although emissions due to hydromagnetic\ndeformations are more promising from a detection standpoint, exterior fields\nalso contribute a strain. However, numerical evidence suggests that the free\nenergy of stable magnetospheric solutions cannot exceed a few tens of percent\nrelative to the potential state, implying that the gravitational-wave\nluminosity cannot differ significantly between models. This prompts\n`universality', in the sense that the strain provides a direct probe of the\nnear-surface field without being muddied by magnetospheric currents.

To\naddress these challenges, this survey focuses on enabling agentic artificial\nintelligence (AI), that is, artificial agents capable of perceiving, reasoning,\nand acting, through generative AI (GAI) and large language models (LLMs). We\nbegin by introducing the architecture and characteristics of SLAETNs, and\nanalyzing the challenges that arise in integrating satellite, aerial, and\nterrestrial components. Then, we present a model-driven foundation by\nsystematically reviewing five major categories of generative models:\nvariational autoencoders (VAEs), generative adversarial networks (GANs),\ngenerative diffusion models (GDMs), transformer-based models (TBMs), and LLMs.\nMoreover, we provide a comparative analysis to highlight their generative\nmechanisms, capabilities, and deployment trade-offs within SLAETNs. Building on\nthis foundation, we examine how these models empower agentic functions across\nthree domains: communication enhancement, security and privacy protection, and\nintelligent satellite tasks. Finally, we outline key future directions for\nbuilding scalable, adaptive, and trustworthy generative agents in SLAETNs.

Among these\nattacks, the model completion (MC) attack is currently the most powerful one.\nExisting defense methods against it either sacrifice model accuracy or incur\nimpractical computational overhead. In this paper, we propose VMask, a novel\nlabel privacy protection framework designed to defend against MC attack from\nthe perspective of layer masking. Our key insight is to disrupt the strong\ncorrelation between input data and intermediate outputs by applying the secret\nsharing (SS) technique to mask layer parameters in the attacker's model. We\ndevise a strategy for selecting critical layers to mask, reducing the overhead\nthat would arise from naively applying SS to the entire model. Moreover, VMask\nis the first framework to offer a tunable privacy budget to defenders, allowing\nfor flexible control over the levels of label privacy according to actual\nrequirements. We built a VFL system, implemented VMask on it, and extensively\nevaluated it using five model architectures and 13 datasets with different\nmodalities, comparing it to 12 other defense methods. The results demonstrate\nthat VMask achieves the best privacy-utility trade-off, successfully thwarting\nthe MC attack (reducing the label inference accuracy to a random guessing\nlevel) while preserving model performance (e.g., in Transformer-based model,\nthe averaged drop of VFL model accuracy is only 0.09%). VMask's runtime is up\nto 60,846 times faster than cryptography-based methods, and it only marginally\nexceeds that of standard VFL by 1.8 times in a large Transformer-based model,\nwhich is generally acceptable.",

However, the severe wireless signal attenuation in\nchallenging underground environments and the costly acquisition of channel\nstate information (CSI) make large-scale WPUCNs economically infeasible in\npractice. To address this challenge, we introduce flexible unmanned aerial\nvehicles (UAVs) into WPUCNs, leading to UAV-enabled WPUCN systems. In this\nsystem, a UAV is first charged by a terrestrial hybrid access point (HAP), then\nflies to the monitoring area to wirelessly charge UDs. Afterwards, the UAV\ncollects data from the UDs and finally returns to the HAP for data offloading.\nBased on the proposed UAV-enabled WPUCN system, we first propose its energy\nconsumption model and a hybrid wireless energy transfer (WET) approach (i.e.,\nUDs can harvest energy from both the HAP and the UAV) relying on full-CSI and\nCSI-free multi-antenna beamforming. Then, we formulate and address a time\nallocation problem to minimize the energy consumption of UAV, while ensuring\nthat the throughput requirements of all UDs are met and all sensor data is\noffloaded. Through simulations of a realistic farming scenario, we demonstrate\nthat the proposed hybrid WET approach outperforms other WET approaches, with\nperformance gains influenced by the number of antennas, communication distance,\nnumber of UDs, and underground conditions. Additionally, under the optimized\ntime allocation, we found that the proposed hybrid WET approach based on a\nCSI-free multi-antenna scheme achieves the lowest UAV's energy consumption\namong all WET mechanisms, thereby enabling sustainable underground monitoring\nin WPUCNs.",

Neural rendering\nis an emerging technique that enables photo-realistic image synthesis from\npreviously unobserved viewpoints; however, state-of-the-art neural rendering\nmethods have difficulty efficiently rendering a high complex large-scale scene\nbecause these methods typically trade scene size, fidelity, and rendering speed\nfor quality.

The\nSegment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) and its related variants, which introduce a\nstreaming memory mechanism for real-time video segmentation, present new\nopportunities for prompt-based, generalizable solutions. Nevertheless, adapting\nthese models to medical video scenarios typically requires large-scale datasets\nfor retraining or transfer learning, leading to high computational costs and\nthe risk of catastrophic forgetting.

This design enables effective\nfine-tuning of SAM2 on medical videos with limited training data.

    "abstract": "Next point of interest (POI) recommendation primarily predicts future\nactivities based on users' past check-in data and current status, providing\nsignificant value to users and service providers. We observed that the popular\ncheck-in times for different POI categories vary. For example, coffee shops are\ncrowded in the afternoon because people like to have coffee to refresh after\nmeals, while bars are busy late at night. However, existing methods rarely\nexplore the relationship between POI categories and time, which may result in\nthe model being unable to fully learn users' tendencies to visit certain POI\ncategories at different times. Additionally, existing methods for modeling time\ninformation often convert it into time embeddings or calculate the time\ninterval and incorporate it into the model, making it difficult to capture the\ncontinuity of time. Finally, during POI prediction, various weighting\ninformation is often ignored, such as the popularity of each POI, the\ntransition relationships between POIs, and the distances between POIs, leading\nto suboptimal performance. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel\nnext POI recommendation framework called Graph Disentangler with POI Weighted\nModule (GDPW). This framework aims to jointly consider POI category information\nand multiple POI weighting factors. Specifically, the proposed GDPW learns\ncategory and time representations through the Global Category Graph and the\nGlobal Category-Time Graph. Then, we disentangle category and time information\nthrough contrastive learning. After prediction, the final POI recommendation\nfor users is obtained by weighting the prediction results based on the\ntransition weights and distance relationships between POIs. We conducted\nexperiments on two real-world datasets, and the results demonstrate that the\nproposed GDPW outperforms other existing models, improving performance by 3% to\n11%.",

In this paper, we propose\nExp-Graph, a novel framework designed to represent the structural relationships\namong facial attributes using graph-based modeling for facial expression\nrecognition. For facial attributes graph representation, facial landmarks are\nused as the graph's vertices. At the same time, the edges are determined based\non the proximity of the facial landmark and the similarity of the local\nappearance of the facial attributes encoded using the vision transformer.\nAdditionally, graph convolutional networks are utilized to capture and\nintegrate these structural dependencies into the encoding of facial attributes,\nthereby enhancing the accuracy of expression recognition. Thus, Exp-Graph\nlearns from the facial attribute graphs highly expressive semantic\nrepresentations. On the other hand, the vision transformer and graph\nconvolutional blocks help the framework exploit the local and global\ndependencies among the facial attributes that are essential for the recognition\nof facial expressions. We conducted comprehensive evaluations of the proposed\nExp-Graph model on three benchmark datasets: Oulu-CASIA, eNTERFACE05, and AFEW.\nThe model achieved recognition accuracies of 98.09\\%, 79.01\\%, and 56.39\\%,\nrespectively.

Linear Model Predictive Control (LMPC) has emerged\nas a practical approach for real-time control.

However, LMPC relies on linearizing the\nequations of motion (EOM), which may lead to poor solution quality. In this\npaper, we use Koopman operator theory and the Extended Dynamic Mode\nDecomposition (EDMD) to create a linear model of the system in high dimensional\nspace, thus retaining the nonlinearity of the EOM. We model the aerial phase\nand ground contact phases using different linear models. Then, using LMPC, we\ndemonstrate bounding, trotting, and bound-to-trot and trot-to-bound gait\ntransitions in level and rough terrains. The main novelty is the use of Koopman\noperator theory to create hybrid models of a quadrupedal system and demonstrate\nthe online generation of multiple gaits and gaits transitions.",

    "abstract": "Processing data at high speeds is becoming increasingly critical as digital\neconomies generate enormous data. The current paradigms for timely data\nprocessing are edge computing and data stream processing (DSP). Edge computing\nplaces resources closer to where data is generated, while stream processing\nanalyzes the unbounded high-speed data in motion. However, edge stream\nprocessing faces rapid workload fluctuations, complicating resource\nprovisioning. Inadequate resource allocation leads to bottlenecks, whereas\nexcess allocation results in wastage. Existing reactive methods, such as\nthreshold-based policies and queuing theory scale only after performance\ndegrades, potentially violating SLAs. Although reinforcement learning (RL)\noffers a proactive approach through agents that learn optimal runtime\nadaptation policies, it requires extensive simulation. Furthermore, predictive\nmachine learning models face online distribution and concept drift that\nminimize their accuracy. We propose a three-step solution to the proactive edge\nstream processing autoscaling problem. Firstly, a GRU neural network forecasts\nthe upstream load using real-world and synthetic DSP datasets. Secondly, a\ntransfer learning framework integrates the predictive model into an online\nstream processing system using the DTW algorithm and joint distribution\nadaptation to handle the disparities between offline and online domains.\nFinally, a horizontal autoscaling module dynamically adjusts the degree of\noperator parallelism, based on predicted load while considering edge resource\nconstraints. The lightweight GRU model for load predictions recorded up to\n1.3\\% SMAPE value on a real-world data set. It outperformed CNN, ARIMA, and\nProphet on the SMAPE and RMSE evaluation metrics, with lower training time than\nthe computationally intensive RL models.",

The framework is underpinned by following\nsix key components: (1) a comprehensive and accurate dataset, constructed via\nthe scalable GUI Data Pipeline, which aggregates the largest and most diverse\nGUI-centric multimodal data to date from open-source repositories, automated\ncrawling, and targeted manual annotation; (2) enhanced perception and grounding\ncapabilities, facilitating fine-grained multimodal alignment for UI element\nreferencing, grounding, and screen comprehension; (3) a comprehensive and\nunified action space, encompassing both fundamental UI operations and complex\ninteractive intents to support human-agent interactions; (4) planning-oriented\nreasoning mechanisms that enable the model to decompose complex user\ninstructions into sequential actions with explicit intermediate meta-paln\nreasoning; (5) an iterative two-stage training procedure, combining large-scale\ncontinue pre-training on 7.8M samples with reinforcement fine-tuning utilizing\na spatially enhanced composite reward and dual filtering strategy; and (6)\ncompetitive performance on both the proprietary Magic-RICH benchmark and over a\ndozen public benchmarks, achieving superior performance across GUI perception\nand agent tasks, while demonstrating robust generalization and real-world\ndeployment potential in practical mobile GUI scenarios, as detailed in Figure\n1.",

    "abstract": "Secure federated learning enables collaborative model training across\ndecentralized users while preserving data privacy. A key component is secure\naggregation, which keeps individual updates hidden from both the server and\nusers, while also defending against Byzantine users who corrupt the\naggregation. To this end, Jinhyun So et al. recently developed a\nByzantine-resilient secure aggregation scheme using a secret-sharing strategy\nover finite-field arithmetic. However, such an approach can suffer from\nnumerical errors and overflows when applied to real-valued model updates,\nmotivating the need for secure aggregation methods that operate directly over\nthe real domain. We propose FORTA, a Byzantine-resilient secure aggregation\nframework that operates entirely in the real domain. FORTA leverages Discrete\nFourier Transform (DFT) codes for privacy and employs Krum-based outlier\ndetection for robustness. While DFT decoder is error-free under infinite\nprecision, finite precision introduces numerical perturbations that can distort\ndistance estimates and allow malicious updates to evade detection. To address\nthis, FORTA refines Krum using feedback from DFT decoder, improving the\nselection of trustworthy updates. Theoretical analysis and experiments show\nthat our modification of Krum offers improved robustness and more accurate\naggregation than standard Krum.",

    "abstract": "The use of Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)\nmodel and its variants for classifying collaborative problem solving (CPS) has\nbeen extensively explored within the AI in Education community. However,\nlimited attention has been given to understanding how individual tokenised\nwords in the dataset contribute to the model's classification decisions.\nEnhancing the explainability of BERT-based CPS diagnostics is essential to\nbetter inform end users such as teachers, thereby fostering greater trust and\nfacilitating wider adoption in education. This study undertook a preliminary\nstep towards model transparency and explainability by using SHapley Additive\nexPlanations (SHAP) to examine how different tokenised words in transcription\ndata contributed to a BERT model's classification of CPS processes. The\nfindings suggested that well-performing classifications did not necessarily\nequate to a reasonable explanation for the classification decisions. Particular\ntokenised words were used frequently to affect classifications. The analysis\nalso identified a spurious word, which contributed positively to the\nclassification but was not semantically meaningful to the class. While such\nmodel transparency is unlikely to be useful to an end user to improve their\npractice, it can help them not to overrely on LLM diagnostics and ignore their\nhuman expertise. We conclude the workshop paper by noting that the extent to\nwhich the model appropriately uses the tokens for its classification is\nassociated with the number of classes involved. It calls for an investigation\ninto the exploration of ensemble model architectures and the involvement of\nhuman-AI complementarity for CPS diagnosis, since considerable human reasoning\nis still required for fine-grained discrimination of CPS subskills.",

This paper proposes a novel hierarchical framework, called\nBT-TL-DMPs, that integrates Behavior Tree (BT), Temporal Logic (TL), and\nDynamical Movement Primitives (DMPs) to address this problem. Within this\nframework, Signal Temporal Logic (STL) is employed to formally specify complex,\nlong-horizon task requirements and constraints. These STL specifications are\nsystematically transformed to generate reactive and modular BTs for high-level\ndecision-making task structure. An STL-constrained DMP optimization method is\nproposed to optimize the DMP forcing term, allowing the learned motion\nprimitives to adapt flexibly while satisfying intricate spatiotemporal\nrequirements and, crucially, preserving the essential dynamics learned from\ndemonstrations. The framework is validated through simulations demonstrating\ngeneralization capabilities under various STL constraints and real-world\nexperiments on several long-horizon robotic manipulation tasks.

A correlation analysis highlighted\nthat larger training data was significantly associated with higher recall\nperformance for both the AudiBERT and BERT models. Additionally, the precision\nof the BERT model was significantly associated with high inter-rater agreement\namong human coders. When employing the BERT model to diagnose indicators within\nthese subskills that were well-detected by the AudiBERT model, the performance\nacross all indicators was inconsistent. We conclude the paper by outlining a\nstructured approach towards achieving human-AI complementarity for CPS\ndiagnosis, highlighting the crucial inclusion of model explainability to\nsupport human agency and engagement in the reflective coding process.",

However, the effect of the SiC film thickness on the formation and\nstructure of SHI tracks over a wide range of irradiation temperatures remains\nunexplored. To address this disadvantage, we utilize a model sensitive to\nirradiation temperature that describes all stages of ion track formation: from\nmaterial excitation, considering the emission of excited electrons from the\nfilm surface (MC code TREKIS-3), to the reaction of the material's atomic\nsystem to the excitation (classical molecular dynamics). We observed the\nformation of two different types of nanostructures on the surface of SiC films\nwith thicknesses ranging from 10 nm to 100 nm when irradiated with 710 MeV Bi\nions: craters and hills. The type of nanostructure formed depended on the\nirradiation temperature. The transition irradiation temperature ($T_{tr}$) from\nhills to craters grows with the film thickness and follows an empirical\nrelation $T_{tr}=T_{tr}^{cr} \\left(1-\\left(1+\\left(L/L_{cr} \\right)^2\n\\right)^{-\\frac{1}{2}} \\right)$ with $T_{tr}^{cr}=1534$ K and $L_{cr}=2.8$ nm.\nThat means such a transition should occur in bulk SiC at the irradiation\ntemperature of $\\approx 1534$ K.",

Numerous models describe people's eye\nmovements depending on the performed task or the viewed content. However, there\nis no universal, context-invariant model of human gaze behaviour. Here we show\nthat statistical regularities can be utilised to model human gaze behaviour\nregardless of task, observer, and content. Using a context-agnostic eye\nmovement model, we were able to describe human gaze behaviour better than a\nuniform random model in various viewing situations. Using a fixed transition\nkernel, the model can describe gaze patterns during reading, visual search, and\nscene perception, as well as for both adults and children. Thus, contrary to\ncurrent belief, human gaze patterns follow a baseline behaviour, making them\ncomparable across contexts.

While the\nevolutionary pressures driving such extreme sperm (flagellar) lengths have long\nbeen investigated, the physical consequences of their gigantism are unstudied.\nThrough high-resolution three-dimensional reconstructions of in vivo sperm\nmorphologies and rapid live imaging, we discovered that stored sperm are\norganized into a dense and highly aligned state. The packed flagella exhibit\nsystem-wide collective 'material' flows, with persistent and slow-moving\ntopological defects; individual sperm, despite their extraordinary lengths,\npropagate rapidly through the flagellar material, moving in either direction\nalong material director lines. To understand how these collective behaviors\narise from the constituents' nonequilibrium dynamics, we conceptualize the\nmotion of individual sperm as topologically confined to a reptation-like tube\nformed by its neighbors. Therein, sperm propagate through observed\namplitude-constrained and internally driven flagellar bending waves, pushing\noff counter-propagating neighbors. From this conception, we derive a continuum\ntheory that produces an extensile material stress that can sustain an aligned\nflagellar material. Experimental perturbations and simulations of active\nelastic filaments verify our theoretical predictions. Our findings suggest that\nactive stresses in the flagellar material maintain the sperm in an unentangled,\nhence functional state, in both sexes, and establish giant sperm in their\nnative habitat as a novel and physiologically relevant active matter system.",

This outflow originate from a 9.7 $M_{\\odot}$ core, exhibits a fork-shaped\nstream structure in its red-shifted lobe, which is traced by CO (2-1), SiO\n(5-4), and H$_2$CO (3$_{0,3}$-2$_{0,2}$). It has a momentum of 13 $M_{\\odot}$\nkm s$^{-1}$, an energy of 107 $M_{\\odot}$ km$^{2}$ s$^{-2}$, and a dynamical\ntimescale of ~10$^{4}$ yr. Significantly, the enhanced relative abundances of\nSiO, H$_2$CO, and CH$_3$OH with respect to CO, along with the increased\ntemperature at the forked point, indicate a collisional origin. The forked\npoint does not coincide with any dust continuum core > 0.1 $M_{\\odot}$.\nMoreover, CO (2-1) emission also traces three other outflows in this region,\ncharacterized by their masses (0.40, 0.02 and 0.15 $M_{\\odot}$) and momenta\n(5.2, 0.2, 1.8 $M_{\\odot}$ km s$^{-1}$), as part of the ALMA Survey of 70\n$\\mu$m dark High-mass clumps in Early Stages (ASHES) project.

Solid-state spin systems, particularly\nnitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, are attractive for their ability to\noperate at room temperature with high sensitivity. However, electron spin\ncoherence due to noise from the surrounding spin bath and this environment\neffect limits the sensitivity of NV centers. Thus, a critical task in NV\ncenter-based quantum sensing is sensitivity enhancement through coherence\nprotection. Nuclear spin assisted protocols have demonstrated greater\nenhancement of electron spin coherence due to the naturally occurring electron\nand nuclear spin pair. The longer nuclear coherence times allow for long-lived\nmemory bit for quantum information protocols. This review discusses the physics\nof NV centers, the mechanisms and variations of nuclear spin-assisted\nprotocols, and their applications in nuclear spin spectroscopy, atomic imaging,\nand magnetic sensing.

    "abstract": "The self-attention mechanism, now central to deep learning architectures such\nas Transformers, is a modern instance of a more general computational\nprinciple: learning and using pairwise affinity matrices to control how\ninformation flows through a model. This paper traces the conceptual origins of\nself-attention across multiple domains, including computer vision, natural\nlanguage processing, and graph learning, through their shared reliance on an\naffinity matrix, denoted as A. We highlight Infinite Feature Selection (Inf-FS)\nas a foundational approach that generalizes the idea of affinity-based\nweighting. Unlike the fixed dot-product structure used in Transformers, Inf-FS\ndefines A either through domain knowledge or by learning, and computes feature\nrelevance through multi-hop propagation over the affinity graph. From this\nperspective, self-attention can be seen as a special case of Inf-FS: it uses a\nsingle-hop affinity computation where A is dynamically built from token\nsimilarities. We argue that the underlying structure, reasoning over pairwise\nrelationships, is preserved across both approaches, and the key differences lie\nin how the affinity matrix is defined and applied. By situating self-attention\nwithin the broader paradigm of affinity-based computation, we unify several\nstrands of machine learning research and highlight a common mathematical\nfoundation that underpins diverse models and tasks.",

This surge\npresents a significant challenge in efficiently choosing the most suitable\npre-trained models for downstream tasks. The critical aspect of this challenge\nlies in effectively predicting the model transferability by considering the\nunderlying fine-tuning dynamics. Existing methods often model fine-tuning\ndynamics in feature space with linear transformations, which do not precisely\nalign with the fine-tuning objective and fail to grasp the essential\nnonlinearity from optimization. To this end, we present LEAD, a\nfinetuning-aligned approach based on the network output of logits. LEAD\nproposes a theoretical framework to model the optimization process and derives\nan ordinary differential equation (ODE) to depict the nonlinear evolution\ntoward the final logit state. Additionally, we design a class-aware\ndecomposition method to consider the varying evolution dynamics across classes\nand further ensure practical applicability. Integrating the closely aligned\noptimization objective and nonlinear modeling capabilities derived from the\ndifferential equation, our method offers a concise solution to effectively\nbridge the optimization gap in a single step, bypassing the lengthy fine-tuning\nprocess. The comprehensive experiments on 24 supervised and self-supervised\npre-trained models across 10 downstream datasets demonstrate impressive\nperformances and showcase its broad adaptability even in low-data scenarios.",

Here, we show that avian wings exhibit\naerodynamic adaptivity to incoming flow variations, characterized by a gentler\nlift curve slope, a wider operative angle of attack range, and turbulence\ninsensitivity, compared to engineered airfoil wings across varying angles of\nattack and turbulence intensities. This adaptivity stems from the consistent\nflow structures around avian wings under different turbulence intensities and\ntheir ability to suppress flow separation at high angles of attack.\nLongitudinal dynamic stability analysis further reveals that avian aerodynamic\ncharacteristics enable the corresponding modeled rigid flyers to maintain a\nbroader stability envelope. This stability supports stable fixed-wing flight in\nreal turbulent environments while reducing the need for active control, thereby\nminimizing flight cost.",

While ANNs have demonstrated remarkable accuracy in\nfacial expression recognition, their ability to model inter-individual\ndifferences in human perception remains underexplored. This study investigates\nthe phenomenon of high perceptual variability-where individuals exhibit\nsignificant differences in emotion categorization even when viewing the same\nstimulus. Inspired by the similarity between ANNs and human perception, we\nhypothesize that facial expression samples that are ambiguous for ANN\nclassifiers also elicit divergent perceptual judgments among human observers.\nTo examine this hypothesis, we introduce a novel perceptual boundary sampling\nmethod to generate facial expression stimuli that lie along ANN decision\nboundaries. These ambiguous samples form the basis of the varEmotion dataset,\nconstructed through large-scale human behavioral experiments. Our analysis\nreveals that these ANN-confusing stimuli also provoke heightened perceptual\nuncertainty in human participants, highlighting shared computational principles\nin emotion perception. Finally, by fine-tuning ANN representations using\nbehavioral data, we achieve alignment between ANN predictions and both\ngroup-level and individual-level human perceptual patterns.

However, traditional rule-based detectors for HFOs suffer\nfrom unsatisfactory precision, producing false positives that require\ntime-consuming manual review. Supervised machine learning approaches have been\nused to classify the detection results, yet they typically depend on labeled\ndatasets, which are difficult to acquire due to the need for specialized\nexpertise. Moreover, accurate labeling of HFOs is challenging due to low\ninter-rater reliability and inconsistent annotation practices across\ninstitutions. The lack of a clear consensus on what constitutes a pathological\nHFO further challenges supervised refinement approaches. To address this, we\nleverage the insight that legacy detectors reliably capture clinically relevant\nsignals despite their relatively high false positive rates. We thus propose the\nSelf-Supervised to Label Discovery (SS2LD) framework to refine the large set of\ncandidate events generated by legacy detectors into a precise set of\npathological HFOs. SS2LD employs a variational autoencoder (VAE) for\nmorphological pre-training to learn meaningful latent representation of the\ndetected events. These representations are clustered to derive weak supervision\nfor pathological events. A classifier then uses this supervision to refine\ndetection boundaries, trained on real and VAE-augmented data. Evaluated on\nlarge multi-institutional interictal iEEG datasets, SS2LD outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods. SS2LD offers a scalable, label-efficient, and\nclinically effective strategy to identify pathological HFOs using legacy\ndetectors.",

Here, through rigorous first-principles\ncalculations, we unveil that uniaxial tensile strain induces a monotonic\nreduction in the $\\kappa_{\\rm L}$ of BAs -- a striking contrast to the\nisotropic scenario. The results show that applying uniaxial (100) strain leads\nto the lifting of phonon band degeneracy, accompanied by an overall softening\nof the phonon spectrum. These modifications significantly increase\nphonon-phonon scattering channels by facilitating the fulfillment of selection\nrules, resulting in a concurrent increase in both three- and four-phonon\nscattering rates. Consequently, $\\kappa_{\\rm L}$ exhibits a dramatic\nsuppression of nearly 80\\% under large tension at room temperature. Meanwhile,\nwe unexpectedly observe that the uniaxial strain suppresses $\\kappa_{\\rm L}$\nmuch more strongly in the direction perpendicular to the strain than along the\nstretching direction. This work establishes the fundamental understanding of\nthe thermal conductivity behavior of BAs under uniaxial strain and opens a\npromising avenue for manipulating solid-state heat transport by tuning crystal\nsymmetry.",

    "abstract": "In causal inference, whether through randomized controlled trials or\nobservational studies, access to both treated and control units is essential\nfor estimating the effect of a treatment on an outcome of interest. When\ntreatment assignment is random, the average treatment effect (ATE) can be\nestimated directly by comparing outcomes between groups. In non-randomized\nsettings, various techniques are employed to adjust for confounding and\napproximate the counterfactual scenario to recover an unbiased ATE. A common\nchallenge, especially in observational studies, is the absence of units clearly\nlabeled as controls-that is, units known not to have received the treatment. To\naddress this, we propose positive-unlabeled (PU) learning as a framework for\nidentifying, with high confidence, control units from a pool of unlabeled ones,\nusing only the available treated (positive) units. We evaluate this approach\nusing both simulated and real-world data. We construct a causal graph with\ndiverse relationships and use it to generate synthetic data under various\nscenarios, assessing how reliably the method recovers control groups that allow\nestimates of true ATE. We also apply our approach to real-world data on optimal\nsowing and fertilizer treatments in sustainable agriculture. Our findings show\nthat PU learning can successfully identify control (negative) units from\nunlabeled data based only on treated units and, through the resulting control\ngroup, estimate an ATE that closely approximates the true value. This work has\nimportant implications for observational causal inference, especially in fields\nwhere randomized experiments are difficult or costly. In domains such as earth,\nenvironmental, and agricultural sciences, it enables a plethora of\nquasi-experiments by leveraging available earth observation and climate data,\nparticularly when treated units are available but control units are lacking.",

    "abstract": "Virtual Reality (VR) has emerged as a powerful tool for workforce training,\noffering immersive, interactive, and risk-free environments that enhance skill\nacquisition, decision-making, and confidence. Despite its advantages,\ndeveloping VR applications for training remains a significant challenge due to\nthe time, expertise, and resources required to create accurate and engaging\ninstructional content. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a\nnovel approach that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the\ngeneration of virtual instructions from textual input. The system comprises two\ncore components: an LLM module that extracts task-relevant information from the\ntext, and an intelligent module that transforms this information into animated\ndemonstrations and visual cues within a VR environment. The intelligent module\nreceives input from the LLM module and interprets the extracted information.\nBased on this, an instruction generator creates training content using relevant\ndata from a database. The instruction generator generates the instruction by\nchanging the color of virtual objects and creating animations to illustrate\ntasks. This approach enhances training effectiveness and reduces development\noverhead, making VR-based training more scalable and adaptable to evolving\nindustrial needs.",

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved outstanding performance across a\nwide range of graph-related tasks. However, their \"black-box\" nature poses\nsignificant challenges to their explainability, and existing methods often fail\nto effectively capture the intricate interaction patterns among nodes within\nthe network. In this work, we propose a novel explainability framework,\nGraphEXT, which leverages cooperative game theory and the concept of social\nexternalities. GraphEXT partitions graph nodes into coalitions, decomposing the\noriginal graph into independent subgraphs. By integrating graph structure as an\nexternality and incorporating the Shapley value under externalities, GraphEXT\nquantifies node importance through their marginal contributions to GNN\npredictions as the nodes transition between coalitions. Unlike traditional\nShapley value-based methods that primarily focus on node attributes, our\nGraphEXT places greater emphasis on the interactions among nodes and the impact\nof structural changes on GNN predictions. Experimental studies on both\nsynthetic and real-world datasets show that GraphEXT outperforms existing\nbaseline methods in terms of fidelity across diverse GNN architectures ,\nsignificantly enhancing the explainability of GNN models.",

    "abstract": "We propose the Signal Dice Similarity Coefficient (SDSC), a structure-aware\nmetric function for time series self-supervised representation learning. Most\nSelf-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods for signals commonly adopt\ndistance-based objectives such as mean squared error (MSE), which are sensitive\nto amplitude, invariant to waveform polarity, and unbounded in scale. These\nproperties hinder semantic alignment and reduce interpretability. SDSC\naddresses this by quantifying structural agreement between temporal signals\nbased on the intersection of signed amplitudes, derived from the Dice\nSimilarity Coefficient (DSC).Although SDSC is defined as a structure-aware\nmetric, it can be used as a loss by subtracting from 1 and applying a\ndifferentiable approximation of the Heaviside function for gradient-based\noptimization. A hybrid loss formulation is also proposed to combine SDSC with\nMSE, improving stability and preserving amplitude where necessary. Experiments\non forecasting and classification benchmarks demonstrate that SDSC-based\npre-training achieves comparable or improved performance over MSE, particularly\nin in-domain and low-resource scenarios.

The calculations are\nperformed in a large model space that includes all proton orbitals between $Z =\n50$ and 82: $0g_{7/2}$, $1d_{5/2}$, $1d_{3/2}$, $2s_{1/2}$, and $0h_{11/2}$.\nThe effective interaction is derived through the principal component analysis\napproach, starting from 160 two-body matrix elements and 5 single-particle\nenergies and considering up to 30 degrees of freedom. Those are optimized by\nfitting to 204 available experimental energy levels. The resulting\nroot-mean-square deviation is as low as 102 keV. The new interaction\nsuccessfully reproduces the binding energies, low-lying spectra, electric\nquadrupole transition probabilities $B(E2)$, and magnetic dipole moments across\nboth even-even and odd-mass isotones, with consistent agreement with\nexperimental values. The nuclear structure of low-lying states is analyzed in\ndetail.

    "abstract": "Multiview pedestrian detection typically involves two stages: human modeling\nand pedestrian localization. Human modeling represents pedestrians in 3D space\nby fusing multiview information, making its quality crucial for detection\naccuracy. However, existing methods often introduce noise and have low\nprecision. While some approaches reduce noise by fitting on costly multiview 3D\nannotations, they often struggle to generalize across diverse scenes. To\neliminate reliance on human-labeled annotations and accurately model humans, we\npropose Depth-Consistent Human Modeling (DCHM), a framework designed for\nconsistent depth estimation and multiview fusion in global coordinates.\nSpecifically, our proposed pipeline with superpixel-wise Gaussian Splatting\nachieves multiview depth consistency in sparse-view, large-scaled, and crowded\nscenarios, producing precise point clouds for pedestrian localization.\nExtensive validations demonstrate that our method significantly reduces noise\nduring human modeling, outperforming previous state-of-the-art baselines.\nAdditionally, to our knowledge, DCHM is the first to reconstruct pedestrians\nand perform multiview segmentation in such a challenging setting.

In addition, the objective of\nthe program is to obtain a thorough understanding of their physical and\nkinematic properties. Here we study the turbulence in these protoclusters with\nC18O (2-1) emission line using the sonic Mach number analysis (M_s ) and the\nsize-linewidth relation. The probability distribution functions (PDFs) for M_s\nshow a similar pattern, exhibiting no clear trend associated with evolutionary\nstage, peaking in the range between 4 and 7, and then extending to ~ 25. Such\nvalues of M_s indicate that the turbulence in the density regime traced by the\nC18O line inside the protoclusters is supersonic in nature. In addition, we\ncompare the non-thermal velocity dispersions (sigma_nth, C18O) obtained from\nthe C18O(2-1) line with the non-thermal line widths (sigma_nth, DCN ) of the\ncores obtained from the DCN (3-2) line. We observe that, on average, the\nnon-thermal linewidth in cores is half that of the gas surrounding them. This\nsuggests that turbulence diminishes at smaller scales or dissipates at the\nperiphery of the cores. Furthermore, we examine the size-linewidth relation for\nthe structures we extracted from the position-position-velocity C18O(2-1) line\nemission cube with dendrogram algorithm. The power-law index (p) obtained from\nthe size-linewidth relation is between 0.41 and 0.64, steeper than the\nKolmogorov law of turbulence, as expected for compressible media.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces the Neural-Brownian Motion (NBM), a new class of\nstochastic processes for modeling dynamics under learned uncertainty. The NBM\nis defined axiomatically by replacing the classical martingale property with\nrespect to linear expectation with one relative to a non-linear Neural\nExpectation Operator, $\\varepsilon^\\theta$, generated by a Backward Stochastic\nDifferential Equation (BSDE) whose driver $f_\\theta$ is parameterized by a\nneural network. Our main result is a representation theorem for a canonical\nNBM, which we define as a continuous $\\varepsilon^\\theta$-martingale with zero\ndrift under the physical measure. We prove that, under a key structural\nassumption on the driver, such a canonical NBM exists and is the unique strong\nsolution to a stochastic differential equation of the form ${\\rm d} M_t =\n\\nu_\\theta(t, M_t) {\\rm d} W_t$. Crucially, the volatility function\n$\\nu_\\theta$ is not postulated a priori but is implicitly defined by the\nalgebraic constraint $g_\\theta(t, M_t, \\nu_\\theta(t, M_t)) = 0$, where\n$g_\\theta$ is a specialization of the BSDE driver. We develop the stochastic\ncalculus for this process and prove a Girsanov-type theorem for the quadratic\ncase, showing that an NBM acquires a drift under a new, learned measure. The\ncharacter of this measure, whether pessimistic or optimistic, is endogenously\ndetermined by the learned parameters $\\theta$, providing a rigorous foundation\nfor models where the attitude towards uncertainty is a discoverable feature.",

These channels enable the anonymous trade of\nillicit goods including drugs, weapons, and stolen credentials. Detecting and\ncategorizing such content remains challenging due to limited labeled data, the\nevolving nature of illicit language, and the structural heterogeneity of online\nsources. This paper presents a hierarchical classification framework that\ncombines fine-tuned language models with a semi-supervised ensemble learning\nstrategy to detect and classify illicit marketplace content across diverse\nplatforms. We extract semantic representations using ModernBERT, a transformer\nmodel for long documents, finetuned on domain-specific data from deep and dark\nweb pages, Telegram channels, Subreddits, and Pastebin pastes to capture\nspecialized jargon and ambiguous linguistic patterns. In addition, we\nincorporate manually engineered features such as document structure, embedded\npatterns including Bitcoin addresses, emails, and IPs, and metadata, which\ncomplement language model embeddings. The classification pipeline operates in\ntwo stages. The first stage uses a semi-supervised ensemble of XGBoost, Random\nForest, and SVM with entropy-based weighted voting to detect sales-related\ndocuments. The second stage further classifies these into drug, weapon, or\ncredential sales. Experiments on three datasets, including our multi-source\ncorpus, DUTA, and CoDA, show that our model outperforms several baselines,\nincluding BERT, ModernBERT, DarkBERT, ALBERT, Longformer, and BigBird.

In this demo paper, we present the very first approach for\nopening the black box by bringing AI explainability approaches to LCMs. As a\ncore contribution, we developed new explanation techniques that extend existing\nmethods that are available for the general explainability of AI models and\nadapt them significantly to be usable for LCMs. In our demo, we provide an\ninteractive tool to showcase how explainability for LCMs works. We believe this\nis a first step for making LCMs debuggable and thus paving the road for new\napproaches for systematically fixing problems in LCMs.",

In DFQ, the quantization model must be\ncalibrated using synthetic samples, making the quality of these synthetic\nsamples crucial. Existing methods fail to fully capture and balance the global\nand local features within the samples, resulting in limited synthetic data\nquality. Moreover, we have found that during inference, there is a significant\ndifference in the distributions of intermediate layer activations between the\nquantized and full-precision models. These issues lead to a severe performance\ndegradation of the quantized model. To address these problems, we propose a\npipeline for Data-Free Quantization for Vision Transformers (DFQ-ViT).\nSpecifically, we synthesize samples in order of increasing difficulty,\neffectively enhancing the quality of synthetic data. During the calibration and\ninference stage, we introduce the activation correction matrix for the\nquantized model to align the intermediate layer activations with those of the\nfull-precision model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DFQ-ViT achieves\nremarkable superiority over existing DFQ methods and its performance is on par\nwith models quantized through real data. For example, the performance of DeiT-T\nwith 3-bit weights quantization is 4.29% higher than the state-of-the-art.

We consider settings where the smooth component is either a\nfinite-sum function or an expectation of a stochastic function, making it\ncomputationally expensive or impractical to evaluate its gradient. To address\nthis, we utilize gradient estimates within the proximal gradient framework. Our\nmethods dynamically adjust the accuracy of these estimates, increasing it as\nthe iterates approach a solution, thereby enabling high-precision solutions\nwith minimal computational cost. We analyze the methods when the smooth\ncomponent is nonconvex, convex, or strongly convex, using a biased gradient\nestimate. In all cases, the methods achieve the optimal iteration complexity\nfor first-order methods. When the gradient estimate is unbiased, we further\nrefine the analysis to show that the methods simultaneously achieve optimal\niteration complexity and optimal complexity in terms of the number of\nstochastic gradient evaluations.

This work targets on large-scale, multi-material TO challenges for\nthree-dimensional (3D) continuum structures, beyond what have been addressed in\nprior studies. Central to this new method is the modified Dantzig-Wolfe (MDW)\ndecomposition, which effectively mitigates the escalating computational cost\nassociated with using classical Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) solvers\nto solve the master problems involved in TO, by decomposing the MILP into local\nand global sub-problems. Evaluated on 3D bridge designs, our classical\nimplementation achieves comparable solution quality to state-of-the-art TO\nmethods while reducing computation time by orders of magnitude. It also\nmaintains low runtimes even in extreme cases where classical MILP solvers fail\nto converge, such as designs involving over 50 million variables. The\ncomputationally intensive local sub-problems, which are essentially Binary\nInteger Programming (BIP) problems, can potentially be accelerated by quantum\ncomputing via their equivalent Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization\n(QUBO) formulations. Enabled by the MDW decomposition, the resulting QUBO\nformulation requires only sparse qubit connectivity and incurs a QUBO\nconstruction cost that scales linearly with problem size, potentially\naccelerating BIP sub-problem solutions by an additional order of magnitude. All\nobserved and estimated speedups become increasingly significant with larger\nproblem sizes and when moving from single-material to multi-material designs.\nThis suggests that this new method, along with quantum computing, will play an\nincreasingly valuable role in addressing the scale and complexity of real-world\nTO applications.",

Here, we report a\nlight-induced giant enhancement of the NLHE in the two-dimensional electron gas\n(2DEG) at the CaZrO3/KTaO3 (111) interface. Under light illumination, the\nsecond harmonic Hall voltage (V2{\\omega} y) increases substantially and\nundergoes a sign reversal. Correspondingly,the second-order transverse\nconductivity increases by nearly five orders of magnitude, reaching 2.4 um V-1\nomega-1, while also reversing its sign. Scaling analysis indicates that skew\nscattering is the dominant mechanism underlying the NLHE and is highly tunable\nvia optical gating. Photoexcitation pumps electrons from in-gap states into the\nhigher-lying Ta 5d conduction band, generating high-mobility photocarriers that\nsignificantly increase the cubic transport scattering time, thereby driving a\ndramatic enhancement of {\\sigma}(2) yxx. First-principles calculations further\nreveal that the Berry curvature distribution on the Fermi surface strongly\ndepends on band filling. As the Fermi level approaches a band crossing in the\nTa 5d subband near the M point, the Berry curvature triple undergoes a sign\nchange, accounting for the experimentally observed sign reversal of the\nnonlinear Hall response.

They cannot deal with TKGA in the\nwild (TKGA-Wild), where multi-scale temporal element entanglement and\ncross-source temporal structural imbalances are common.

Our model utilizes the autoencoder framework to\nidentify the randomness of the latent system by the encoder network, and\ndetects the stochastic generating function of the system through the decoder\nnetwork based on the random variables extracted from the encoder. Symplectic\npredictions can then be generated by the stochastic generating function.\nNumerical experiments are performed on several stochastic Hamiltonian systems,\nvarying from additive to multiplicative, and from separable to non-separable\nSHSs with single or multiple noises. Compared with the benchmark stochastic\nflow map learning (sFML) neural network, our SGFNN model exhibits higher\naccuracy across various prediction metrics, especially in long-term\npredictions, with the property of maintaining the symplectic structure of the\nunderlying SHSs.",

Recently, a growing number\nof superconducting materials have been identified that suggest additional\nspontaneous symmetry breakings besides the primal breaking of U(1) gauge\nsymmetry, including time-reversal, chiral, and rotational symmetries.\nObservation of collective modes in those exotic superconductors is particularly\nimportant, as they provide the fingerprints of the superconducting OP. Here we\ninvestigate the collective modes in an iron-based superconductor, FeSe, a\nstriking example of superconductivity emergent in an electronic nematic phase\nwhere the rotational symmetry of electronic degree of freedom is spontaneously\nbroken. By using terahertz nonlinear spectroscopy technique, we discovered a\ncollective mode resonance located substantially below the superconducting gap\nenergy, distinct from the amplitude Higgs mode. Comparison with theoretical\ncalculations demonstrates that the observed mode is attributed to a collective\nfluctuation between the s+d-wave-like ground state and the subleading pairing\nchannel, which corresponds to the so-called Bardasis-Schrieffer mode but also\nresembles an intraband Leggett mode. Our result corroborates the multicomponent\npairing channels in FeSe activated in the lower space group symmetry in the\nelectronic nematic phase.",

A Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) can solve both\nproblems. PINNs inject prior analytical information about the data into the\ncost function to improve model performance outside the training set boundaries.\nThis also allows PINNs to efficiently solve problems with sparse data without\noverfitting by extrapolating the model to fit larger trends in the data.

In this way, the solution and parameters are embedded into the loss\nfunction and optimized, allowing both the weights of the neural network and the\nmodel parameters to be found simultaneously, solving both the forward and\ninverse problems in the process. In this paper, we will create PINNs with\nresiduals of varying complexity, beginning with linear and quadratic models and\nthen expanding to fit models for the heat equation and other complex\ndifferential equations.

    "abstract": "Microscopes face a trade-off between spatial resolution, field-of-view, and\nframe rate -- improving one of these properties typically requires sacrificing\nthe others, due to the limited spatiotemporal throughput of the sensor. To\novercome this, we propose a new microscope that achieves snapshot\ngigapixel-scale imaging with a sensor array and a diffractive optical element\n(DOE). We improve the spatiotemporal throughput in two ways. First, we capture\ndata with an array of 48 sensors resulting in 48x more pixels than a single\nsensor. Second, we use point spread function (PSF) engineering and compressive\nsensing algorithms to fill in the missing information from the gaps surrounding\nthe individual sensors in the array, further increasing the spatiotemporal\nthroughput of the system by an additional >5.4x. The array of sensors is\nmodeled as a single large-format \"super-sensor,\" with erasures corresponding to\nthe gaps between the individual sensors. The array is placed at the output of a\n(nearly) 4f imaging system, and we design a DOE for the Fourier plane that\ngenerates a distributed PSF that encodes information from the entire\nsuper-sensor area, including the gaps. We then computationally recover the\nlarge-scale image, assuming the object is sparse in some domain. Our\ncalibration-free microscope can achieve ~3 {\\mu}m resolution over >5.2 cm^2\nFOVs at up to 120 fps, culminating in a total spatiotemporal throughput of 25.2\nbillion pixels per second. We demonstrate the versatility of our microscope in\ntwo different modes: structural imaging via darkfield contrast and functional\nfluorescence imaging of calcium dynamics across dozens of freely moving C.\nelegans simultaneously.",

These state transitions can occur when excessive measurement power\nleads to qubit excitations outside its computational space. Alternatively, the\nqubit state can decay rapidly when the measurement protocol inadvertently\ncouples the qubit to lossy modes such as two-level systems (TLSs). We\nexperimentally verify the impact of these TLSs in qubit readout by measuring\nthe transition errors at different qubit flux bias. Because such state\ntransitions during measurements are often localized in frequency space, we\ndemonstrate the ability to avoid them during a fluxonium readout by exploiting\nthe qubit's flux-tunability. By synchronizing the flux bias with the readout\nphoton dynamics, we obtain an optimal readout fidelity of 99 % (98.4 %) in 1 us\n(0.5 us) integration time.

As quantum circuits scale up, the\noptimization search space becomes increasingly complex, leading to challenges\nsuch as low efficiency and suboptimal solutions. To address these issues, this\npaper proposes a quantum circuit optimization approach based on dynamic\ngrouping and ZX-calculus. First, a random strategy-based dynamic grouping\nmethod partitions the circuit into multiple subcircuits. Second, a ZX-calculus\nguided k-step lookahead search performs equivalent subcircuit filtering to\nminimize two-qubit gate counts. Third, a delay-aware placement method optimizes\nthe recombined circuit to reduce the overall gate count. Finally, simulated\nannealing iteratively updates the grouping strategy to achieve an optimized\ntwo-qubit gate count. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate\nthe effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in reducing two-qubit\ngates. Compared to the original circuits, the approach achieves an average\nreduction of 18% in two-qubit gates.

Our results reveal a\npositive correlation between \\textit{v}sin\\textit{i} and the color of eMSTO\nstars, where fast-rotating stars predominantly occupy the red part of the MS\nwhile slow-rotating ones prefer a bluer side of the MS. The gravity-darkening\neffect might be a reason for this correlation.

We identify four double-lined spectroscopic binaries\n(SB2) featuring slow-rotating companions, further supporting this tidal-locking\nhypothesis. However, the spatial distribution and the cumulative radial\ndistribution indicate a higher concentration of red eMSTO stars in the\ncluster's central region than their bluer counterparts. This suggests that\ntidal locking is less likely to be the cause of the observed spread in rotation\nrates among eMSTO stars.

Even though the PSF\nmodel offers a parsimonious representation of the dynamic MRI signal in several\napplications, its representation capabilities tend to decrease in scenarios\nwhere voxels present different temporal/spectral characteristics at different\nspatial locations. In this work we account for this limitation by proposing a\nnew model, called spatiotemporal maps (STMs), that leverages autoregressive\nproperties of (k, t)-space. The STM model decomposes the spatiotemporal MRI\nsignal into a sum of components, each one consisting of a product between a\nspatial function and a temporal function that depends on the spatial location.\nThe proposed model can be interpreted as an extension of the PSF model whose\ntemporal functions are independent of the spatial location. We show that\nspatiotemporal maps can be efficiently computed from autocalibration data by\nusing advanced signal processing and randomized linear algebra techniques,\nenabling STMs to be used as part of many reconstruction frameworks for\naccelerated dynamic MRI.

It builds on the idea presented by Chen~\\emph{et al}.~[Phys. Rev. Appl.\n{\\bf 19}, 054209 (2023)], who proposed zero-added-loss multiplexing (ZALM) as a\nmeans for high-fidelity, quasi-deterministic entanglement generation.\nUnfortunately, Chen \\emph{et al}.'s ZALM requires a large number (800) of\nspectral channels to achieve its claimed high-fidelity, quasi-deterministic,\nhigh-rate entanglement generation. Our modified version of ZALM affords major\nperformance improvements over the original. It draws on Morrison~\\emph{et\nal}.~[APL Photon. {\\bf 7}, 066102 (2022)], who domain engineered a $\\chi^{(2)}$\ncrystal to realize a biphoton wave function with 8 discrete and\nspectrally-factorable frequency bins. Our ZALM SPDCs each have a modest number\n($N_I\\ll$ 800) of these phase-matched spectral islands each generating two-mode\nsqueezed-vacuum states, permitting our analysis, unlike Chen~\\emph{et al.}'s,\nto account for multipairs of all orders, losses in the partial BSM, and\npropagation losses en route to the receivers. A major innovation in our\nproposal is to employ both same-island heralding and cross-island heralding,\nwhich allows the entanglement-delivery rate to approximately scale as $N_I^2$\nrather than $N_I$ in the weak squeezing regime required for the reception of\nphoton pairs with a high Bell-state fidelity under realistic losses. This\nheralding scheme uses an order of magnitude fewer spectral channels, which may\nenable near-term implementations of satellite-to-ground or fiber-optic based\nZALM architectures.",

    "abstract": "The design and evaluation on the NSLS-II beamline of the 3FI application\nspecific integrated circuit (ASIC) bump-bonded to a simply, planar,\ntwo-dimensionally segmented silicon sensor is presented. The ASIC was developed\nfor Full-Field Fluorescence spectral X-ray Imaging (3FI). It is a small-scale\nprototype that features a square array of 32x32 pixels with a pitch of 100\n{\\mu}m. The ASIC was implemented in a 65 nm CMOS process. Each pixel\nincorporates a charge-sensitive amplifier, shaping filter, discriminator, peak\ndetector, and sample-and-hold circuit, allowing detection of events and storing\nsignal amplitudes. The system operates in an event-driven readout mode,\noutputting analog values for threshold-triggered events, allowing high-speed\nmulti-element X-ray fluorescence imaging. At power consumption of 200 {\\mu}W\nper pixel, consisting almost uniquely of power dissipated in analog blocks, 308\neV full width at half maximum (FWHM) energy resolution at 8.04 keV, that\ncorresponds to 30 e- rms equivalent noise charge (ENC) and 138 eV FWHM energy\nresolution at 3.69 keV (16 e- rms ENC) were obtained, for Cu and Ca K{\\alpha}\nlines, respectively. Each pixel operates independently, and the detector\nenables in situ trace element microanalysis in biological and environmental\nresearch. Its architecture addresses limitations of X-ray Fluorescence\nMicroscopy (XFM), typically requiring mechanical scanning, by offering\nframe-lees data acquisition, translating to high-throughput operation. The 3FI\nASIC is suitable for example for studies of nutrient cycling in the\n(mycor)rhizosphere, microbial redox processes, and genotype-phenotype\ncorrelations in bio-energy crops. Additional performances, such as enhanced\nspatial resolution can be further improved with coded-aperture and Wolt,\nextending the use to environmental, biomedical, and material science studies.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of heterogeneity and domain-specific architectures targeting\ndeep learning inference show great potential for enabling the deployment of\nmodern CNNs on resource-constrained embedded platforms. A significant\ndevelopment is the diversification of custom hardware solely targeting the most\nexpensive parts of CNNs. DLAs (deep learning accelerators) and NPUs (neural\nprocessing units), among others, can overcome the approaching limits of\ntraditional silicon scaling and provide a solution to the power/performance\ntradeoff within embedded SoCs. Efficient DSA utilization requires proper system\nintegration and a compilation/execution model for balanced execution in these\nheterogeneous architectures. There is a critical need for proper system\nintegration and an efficient compilation/execution model for balanced execution\nin these heterogeneous architectures. This work highlights the hardware\nintegration challenges for efficiently placing these units within the memory\nhierarchy and correct proximity to other execution blocks. We experimentally\nverify performance bottlenecks in CNN execution and pre/post-processing at\nruntime, where previous attention has generally been given to accelerator\nspeedup alone. This work takes advantage of the ratification of the RISC-V\nVector 1.0 extension and demonstrates its potential as a flexible target within\na well-suited cache hierarchy scheme to reduce pre-processing bottlenecks and\nCPU fallback processes. Our results show up to a 9x speedup of image\npre-processing and YOLOv3 fallback layer execution by up to 3x compared to CPU.\nWe demonstrate RVV-1.0 in exposing a flexible programming model that can enable\na balanced computation and memory footprint on accelerator-rich embedded SoCs\nsupporting modern deep-learning dataflows while consuming less power than\ntraditional parallel execution platforms.",

It\ninvolves breaking down the input into units that are later passed to the\nlanguage model stack to learn high-dimensional representations used in various\ncontexts, from classification to generation. However, the output of these\ntokenizers is often longer than that traditionally used in compilers and\ninterpreters. This could result in undesirable effects, such as increased\ncomputational overhead. In this work, we investigate the effect of merging the\nhidden representations of subtokens that belong to the same semantic unit, such\nas subtokens that form a single identifier. We propose two strategies: one\nbased on averaging the representations and another that leverages a\nlearning-based approach. Both methods can be seamlessly integrated with\nexisting language models for code. We conduct experiments using six language\nmodels for code: CodeBERT, GraphCodeBERT, UniXCoder, CdoeT5, CodeT5+ (220M),\nand CodeT5+ (770M), across three software engineering tasks: vulnerability\ndetection, code classification, and code translation. Results show that these\nstrategies can reduce the number of floating-point operations by $1\\%$ to\n$19\\%$. Regarding downstream performance, the most significant degradation was\nobserved in the vulnerability detection task, where the F1 score decreased by\n$1.82$ points compared to the baseline.

    ],
    "abstract": "Prior work proposed simple test-time scaling, a method for replicating this\nscaling behavior with models distilled from o1-like models by manually\ncontrolling test-time compute: either scaling down by enforcing a maximum\nlength or scaling up by iteratively appending \"Wait\" when the model is about to\nterminate its generation. This paper presents an analysis of simple test-time\nscaling and finds that the scaling behavior is largely attributed to scaling\ndown by enforcing a maximum length. In contrast, fine-tuning on long CoT data\ndistilled from o1-like models has no significant impact on scaling behavior,\nand scaling up by appending \"Wait\" leads to inconsistencies, as the model may\noscillate between solutions. A key distinction exists between scaling down by\nenforcing a maximum length and scaling up test-time compute in o1-like models,\nsuch as DeepSeek-R1\\@. These models are typically allowed to utilize as much\ncompute as needed, with the only constraint being the model's maximum supported\nlength. By learning to naturally scale up test-time compute during\nreinforcement learning, o1-like models surpass their peak performance when\nscaling up. In contrast, simple test-time scaling progressively imposes a lower\nupper limit on model performance as it scales down. While replicating the\ntest-time scaling behavior of o1 models can be straightforward by scaling down,\nit is crucial to recognize that the goal of scaling test-time compute is to\nunlock higher performance -- beyond what the model could originally achieve --\nrather than merely reproducing the appearance of scaling behavior.",
