    "abstract": "Machine learning-based decision models are increasingly being used to make\ndecisions that significantly impact people's lives, but their opaque nature\nleaves end users without a clear understanding of why a decision was made.\nCounterfactual Explanations (CFEs) have grown in popularity as a means of\noffering actionable guidance by identifying the minimum changes in feature\nvalues required to flip a model's prediction to something more desirable.\nUnfortunately, most prior research in CFEs relies on artificial evaluation\nmetrics, such as proximity, which may overlook end-user preferences and\nconstraints, e.g., the user's perception of effort needed to make certain\nfeature changes may differ from that of the model designer. To address this\nresearch gap, this paper makes three novel contributions. First, we conduct a\npilot study with 20 crowd-workers on Amazon MTurk to experimentally validate\nthe alignment of existing CF evaluation metrics with real-world user\npreferences. Results show that user-preferred CFEs matched those based on\nproximity in only 63.81% of cases, highlighting the limited applicability of\nthese metrics in real-world settings. Second, inspired by the need to design a\nuser-informed evaluation metric for CFEs, we conduct a more detailed two-day\nuser study with 41 participants facing realistic credit application scenarios\nto find experimental support for or against three intuitive hypotheses that may\nexplain how end users evaluate CFEs. Third, based on the findings of this\nsecond study, we propose the AWP model, a novel user-centric, two-stage model\nthat describes one possible mechanism by which users evaluate and select CFEs.\nOur results show that AWP predicts user-preferred CFEs with 84.37% accuracy.\nOur study provides the first human-centered validation for personalized cost\nmodels in CFE generation and highlights the need for adaptive, user-centered\nevaluation metrics.",

    "abstract": "Requirements elicitation is still one of the most challenging activities of\nthe requirements engineering process due to the difficulty requirements\nanalysts face in understanding and translating complex needs into concrete\nrequirements. In addition, specifying high-quality requirements is crucial, as\nit can directly impact the quality of the software to be developed. Although\nautomated tools allow for assessing the syntactic quality of requirements,\nevaluating semantic metrics (e.g., language clarity, internal consistency)\nremains a manual and time-consuming activity. This paper explores how LLMs can\nhelp automate requirements elicitation within agile frameworks, where\nrequirements are defined as user stories (US). We used 10 state-of-the-art LLMs\nto investigate their ability to generate US automatically by emulating customer\ninterviews. We evaluated the quality of US generated by LLMs, comparing it with\nthe quality of US generated by humans (domain experts and students). We also\nexplored whether and how LLMs can be used to automatically evaluate the\nsemantic quality of US. Our results indicate that LLMs can generate US similar\nto humans in terms of coverage and stylistic quality, but exhibit lower\ndiversity and creativity. Although LLM-generated US are generally comparable in\nquality to those created by humans, they tend to meet the acceptance quality\ncriteria less frequently, regardless of the scale of the LLM model. Finally,\nLLMs can reliably assess the semantic quality of US when provided with clear\nevaluation criteria and have the potential to reduce human effort in\nlarge-scale assessments.",

The device is miniaturized (4 mm outer diameter, 2 mm\ninner diameter, 40 mm length), 3D printed using biocompatible SIL 30 material,\nand integrates embedded Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensors for real-time shape\nfeedback. Shape reconstruction is represented using four Bezier control points,\nenabling a compact and smooth model of the device's deformation. A data-driven\nmodel was trained on 5,097 experimental samples covering a range of magnetic\nfield magnitudes (0-14 mT), actuation frequencies (0.2-1.0 Hz), and vertical\ntip distances (90-100 mm), using both Neural Network (NN) and Random Forest\n(RF) architectures. The RF model outperformed the NN across all metrics,\nachieving a mean root mean square error of 0.087 mm in control point prediction\nand a mean shape reconstruction error of 0.064 mm. Feature importance analysis\nfurther revealed that magnetic field components predominantly influence distal\ncontrol points, while frequency and distance affect the base configuration.\nThis learning-based approach effectively models the complex nonlinear behavior\nof hyperelastic soft robots under magnetic actuation without relying on\nsimplified physical assumptions. By enabling sub-millimeter shape prediction\naccuracy and real-time inference, this work represents an advancement toward\nthe intelligent control of magnetically actuated soft robotic tools in\nminimally invasive neurosurgery.",

    "abstract": "Raft is a leader-based consensus algorithm that implements State Machine\nReplication (SMR), which replicates the service state across multiple servers\nto enhance fault tolerance. In Raft, the servers play one of three roles:\nleader, follower, or candidate. The leader receives client requests, determines\nthe processing order, and replicates them to the followers. When the leader\nfails, the service must elect a new leader to continue processing requests,\nduring which the service experiences an out-of-service (OTS) time. The OTS time\nis directly influenced by election parameters, such as heartbeat interval and\nelection timeout. However, traditional approaches, such as Raft, often struggle\nto effectively tune these parameters, particularly under fluctuating network\nconditions, leading to increased OTS time and reduced service responsiveness.\nTo address this, we propose Dynatune, a mechanism that dynamically adjusts\nRaft's election parameters based on network metrics such as round-trip time and\npacket loss rates measured via heartbeats. By adapting to changing network\nenvironments, Dynatune significantly reduces the leader failure detection and\nOTS time without altering Raft's core mechanisms or introducing additional\ncommunication overheads. Experimental results demonstrate that Dynatune reduces\nthe leader failure detection and OTS times by 80% and 45%, respectively,\ncompared with Raft, while maintaining high availability even under dynamic\nnetwork conditions. These findings confirm that Dynatune effectively enhances\nthe performance and reliability of SMR services in various network scenarios.",

To address this, we developed Clinical Semantic Intelligence\n(CSI), a novel artificial intelligence framework that diagnoses 118 different\noral diseases by computationally modeling the cognitive processes of an expert\nclinician. Our core hypothesis is that moving beyond simple pattern matching to\nemulate expert reasoning is critical to building clinically useful diagnostic\naids.\n  CSI's architecture integrates a fine-tuned multimodal CLIP model with a\nspecialized ChatGLM-6B language model. This system executes a Hierarchical\nDiagnostic Reasoning Tree (HDRT), a structured framework that distills the\nsystematic, multi-step logic of differential diagnosis. The framework operates\nin two modes: a Fast Mode for rapid screening and a Standard Mode that\nleverages the full HDRT for an interactive and in-depth diagnostic workup.\n  To train and validate our system, we curated a primary dataset of 4,310\nimages, supplemented by an external hold-out set of 176 images for final\nvalidation. A clinically-informed augmentation strategy expanded our training\ndata to over 30,000 image-text pairs. On a 431-image internal test set, CSI's\nFast Mode achieved an accuracy of 73.4%, which increased to 89.5% with the\nHDRT-driven Standard Mode.

Uncertainty quantification is built\ndirectly into our comprehensive theoretical framework and gives us new\nalgorithms to dynamically tune exploration-exploitation trade-offs according to\nthe uncertainty trend observed in nature. We rigorously empirically test\nvarious strategies, parametrizing our tests by dimensionality, noise, penalty\nterms, and evaluate the performance of any given strategery in a wide variety\nof test settings, and show conclusively that adaptive strategies always\noutperform fixed ones, but in difficult settings, where the dimensions are\nlarge and the noise is severe, the advantage is enormous.

    "abstract": "Visual Planning for Assistance (VPA) aims to predict a sequence of user\nactions required to achieve a specified goal based on a video showing the\nuser's progress. Although recent advances in multimodal large language models\n(MLLMs) have shown promising results in video understanding, long-horizon\nvisual planning remains a challenging problem. We identify two challenges in\ntraining large MLLMs for video-based planning tasks: (1) scarcity of procedural\nannotations, limiting the model's ability to learn procedural task dynamics\neffectively, and (2) inefficiency of next-token prediction objective to\nexplicitly capture the structured action space for visual planning when\ncompared to free-form, natural language. To tackle data scarcity, we introduce\nAuxiliary Task Augmentation. We design and train our model on auxiliary tasks\nrelevant to long-horizon video-based planning (e.g., goal prediction) to\naugment the model's planning ability. To more explicitly model the structured\naction space unique to visual planning tasks, we leverage Multi-token\nPrediction, extending traditional next-token prediction by using multiple heads\nto predict multiple future tokens during training. Our approach, VideoPlan,\nachieves state-of-the-art VPA performance on the COIN and CrossTask datasets,\nsurpassing prior methods by 7.3% and 3.4%, respectively, when predicting 3\nfuture actions. We further extend our method to the challenging Ego4D Long-term\nAction Anticipation task, and show that it is on par with the state-of-the-art\napproaches despite not using specialized egocentric features.

    "abstract": "This paper develops a sequential-linearization feedback optimization\nframework for driving nonlinear dynamical systems to an\n  optimal steady state. A fundamental challenge in feedback optimization is the\nrequirement of accurate first-order information\n  of the steady-state input-output mapping, which is computationally\nprohibitive for high-dimensional nonlinear systems and\n  often leads to poor performance when approximated around a fixed operating\npoint. To address this limitation, we propose a\n  sequential algorithm that adaptively updates the linearization point during\noptimization, maintaining local accuracy throughout\n  the trajectory. We prove convergence to a neighborhood of the optimal steady\nstate with explicit error bounds. To reduce the\n  computational burden of repeated linearization operations, we further develop\na multi-timescale variant where linearization\n  updates occur at a slower timescale than optimization iterations, achieving\nsignificant computational savings while preserving\n  convergence guarantees.

Based on the established\nrelationship between Pontryagin's maximum principle (PMP) and the value\nfunction of the optimal control problem, which is characterized as being the\nunique solution to an associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, we\npropose an approach that begins by using neural networks to provide a first\nrough estimate of the value function, which serves as initialization for\nsolving the two point boundary value problem in the PMP and, as a result,\ngenerates reliable data. To train the neural network we define a loss function\nthat takes into account this dataset and also penalizes deviations from the HJB\nequation.\n  In the second part, we address the computation of equilibria in first-order\nMean Field Game (MFG) problems by integrating our method with the fictitious\nplay algorithm. These equilibria are characterized by a coupled system of a\nfirst-order HJB equation and a continuity equation. To approximate the solution\nto the continuity equation, we introduce a second neural network that learns\nthe flow map transporting the initial distribution of agents. This network is\ntrained on data generated by solving the underlying ODEs for a batch of initial\nconditions sampled from the initial distribution of agents.

While\nunderspecified guidelines and annotator behavior contribute to variation,\ncontent-based ambiguity provides a process-independent signal of divergent\nhuman perspectives. We call for a shift toward ambiguity-aware NLI that first\nidentifies ambiguous input pairs, classifies their types, and only then\nproceeds to inference. To support this shift, we present a framework that\nincorporates ambiguity detection and classification prior to inference. We also\nintroduce a unified taxonomy that synthesizes existing taxonomies, illustrates\nkey subtypes with examples, and motivates targeted detection methods that\nbetter align models with human interpretation. Although current resources lack\ndatasets explicitly annotated for ambiguity and subtypes, this gap presents an\nopportunity: by developing new annotated resources and exploring unsupervised\napproaches to ambiguity detection, we enable more robust, explainable, and\nhuman-aligned NLI systems.",

To\naddress this, we introduce the Causal Action Influence Score (CAIS), a novel\nintrinsic reward rooted in causal inference. CAIS quantifies an action's\ninfluence by measuring the 1-Wasserstein distance between the learned\ndistribution of sensory outcomes conditional on that action, $p(h|a)$, and the\nbaseline outcome distribution, $p(h)$. This divergence provides a robust reward\nthat isolates the agent's causal impact from confounding environmental noise.\nWe test our approach in a simulated infant-mobile environment where\ncorrelation-based perceptual rewards fail completely when the mobile is\nsubjected to external forces. In stark contrast, CAIS enables the agent to\nfilter this noise, identify its influence, and learn the correct policy.\nFurthermore, the high-quality predictive model learned for CAIS allows our\nagent, when augmented with a surprise signal, to successfully reproduce the\n\"extinction burst\" phenomenon.

    "abstract": "Group or cluster structure on explanatory variables in machine learning\nproblems is a very general phenomenon, which has attracted broad interest from\npractitioners and theoreticians alike. In this work we contribute an approach\nto sparse learning under such group structure, that does not require prior\ninformation on the group identities. Our paradigm is motivated by the Laplacian\ngeometry of an underlying network with a related community structure, and\nproceeds by directly incorporating this into a penalty that is effectively\ncomputed via a heat-flow-based local network dynamics. The proposed penalty\ninterpolates between the lasso and the group lasso penalties, the runtime of\nthe heat-flow dynamics being the interpolating parameter. As such it can\nautomatically default to lasso when the group structure reflected in the\nLaplacian is weak. In fact, we demonstrate a data-driven procedure to construct\nsuch a network based on the available data. Notably, we dispense with\ncomputationally intensive pre-processing involving clustering of variables,\nspectral or otherwise. Our technique is underpinned by rigorous theorems that\nguarantee its effective performance and provide bounds on its sample\ncomplexity. In particular, in a wide range of settings, it provably suffices to\nrun the diffusion for time that is only logarithmic in the problem dimensions.\nWe explore in detail the interfaces of our approach with key statistical\nphysics models in network science, such as the Gaussian Free Field and the\nStochastic Block Model. Our work raises the possibility of applying similar\ndiffusion-based techniques to classical learning tasks, exploiting the\ninterplay between geometric, dynamical and stochastic structures underlying the\ndata.",

    "abstract": "Intraoperative bleeding during Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) poses\nsignificant risks, demanding precise, real-time localization and continuous\nmonitoring of the bleeding source for effective hemostatic intervention. In\nparticular, endoscopists have to repeatedly flush to clear blood, allowing only\nmilliseconds to identify bleeding sources, an inefficient process that prolongs\noperations and elevates patient risks. However, current Artificial Intelligence\n(AI) methods primarily focus on bleeding region segmentation, overlooking the\ncritical need for accurate bleeding source detection and temporal tracking in\nthe challenging ESD environment, which is marked by frequent visual\nobstructions and dynamic scene changes. This gap is widened by the lack of\nspecialized datasets, hindering the development of robust AI-assisted guidance\nsystems. To address these challenges, we introduce BleedOrigin-Bench, the first\ncomprehensive ESD bleeding source dataset, featuring 1,771 expert-annotated\nbleeding sources across 106,222 frames from 44 procedures, supplemented with\n39,755 pseudo-labeled frames. This benchmark covers 8 anatomical sites and 6\nchallenging clinical scenarios.

We compare with widely-used object detection\nmodels (YOLOv11/v12), multimodal large language models, and point tracking\nmethods.

    "abstract": "The core of the freeway merging control problem lies in dynamic queue\npropagation and dissipation linked to merging vehicle behavior. Traditionally,\nqueuing is modeled through demand-supply interactions with time varying demand\nand fixed capacity. However, field observations show flow rates decrease during\ncongestion at freeway merges due to the impact of intersecting traffic, a\nfactor overlooked in fundamental diagrams. This manuscript introduces an\nanalytical approach to characterize and control the dynamic multi-stage merging\nof autonomous vehicles, prioritizing traffic efficiency and safety. For the\nfirst time, the effective discharge rate at the merging point, reduced by the\nmulti-stage dynamic merging process, is analytically derived using a closed\nform formulation. Leveraging this expression, performance metrics such as queue\nlength and traffic delay are derived as the first objective. Additionally, a\ncrash risk function is established to quantitatively assess potential\ncollisions during the merging process, serving as the second objective.\nFinally, the problem is formulated as a dynamic programming model to jointly\nminimize delay and crash risk, with the merging location and speed as decision\nvariables. Given the terminal state, the ramp vehicle merging task is\nformulated as a recursive optimization problem, employing backward induction to\nfind the minimum cost solution. Numerical experiments using the NGSIM dataset\nvalidate the derived effective discharge rate. The results indicate that the\nproposed model outperforms two benchmark algorithms, leading to a more\nefficient and safer merging process.",

Although these models may provide good accuracy, selecting the\nmodel structure and dimension is still ad-hoc and it is difficult to quantify\nthe error that is introduced. In contrast to the general trend of data-driven\nlearning, in this paper, we develop a systematic technique for nonlinear\nsystems that produces a finite-dimensional and exact embedding. If the\nnonlinear system is represented as a network of series and parallel linear and\nnonlinear (polynomial) blocks, one can derive an associated Koopman model that\nhas constant state and output matrices and the input influence is polynomial.\nFurthermore, if the linear blocks do not have feedthrough, the Koopman\nrepresentation simplifies to a bilinear model.",

However, the impact of prompt variations on response text\nlength, and, more importantly, the consequential effect on lexical diversity\nmeasurements, remain underexplored. In this work, we propose Penalty-Adjusted\nType-Token Ratio (PATTR), a diversity metric robust to length variations. We\ngenerate a large synthetic corpus of over 20M words using seven models from the\nLLaMA, OLMo, and Phi families, focusing on a creative writing task of video\nscript generation, where diversity is crucial. We evaluate per-response lexical\ndiversity using PATTR and compare it against existing metrics of Moving-Average\nTTR (MATTR) and Compression Ratio (CR). Our analysis highlights how text length\nvariations introduce biases favoring shorter responses. Unlike existing\nmetrics, PATTR explicitly considers the task-specific target response length\n($L_T$) to effectively mitigate length biases. We further demonstrate the\nutility of PATTR in filtering the top-10/100/1,000 most lexically diverse\nresponses, showing that it consistently outperforms MATTR and CR by yielding on\npar or better diversity with high adherence to $L_T$.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a novel extension to robust control theory that explicitly\naddresses uncertainty in the value function's gradient, a form of uncertainty\nendemic to applications like reinforcement learning where value functions are\napproximated. We formulate a zero-sum dynamic game where an adversary perturbs\nboth system dynamics and the value function gradient, leading to a new, highly\nnonlinear partial differential equation: the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman-Isaacs\nEquation with Gradient Uncertainty (GU-HJBI). We establish its well-posedness\nby proving a comparison principle for its viscosity solutions under a uniform\nellipticity condition. Our analysis of the linear-quadratic (LQ) case yields a\nkey insight: we prove that the classical quadratic value function assumption\nfails for any non-zero gradient uncertainty, fundamentally altering the problem\nstructure. A formal perturbation analysis characterizes the non-polynomial\ncorrection to the value function and the resulting nonlinearity of the optimal\ncontrol law, which we validate with numerical studies. Finally, we bridge\ntheory to practice by proposing a novel Gradient-Uncertainty-Robust\nActor-Critic (GURAC) algorithm, accompanied by an empirical study demonstrating\nits effectiveness in stabilizing training. This work provides a new direction\nfor robust control, holding significant implications for fields where function\napproximation is common, including reinforcement learning and computational\nfinance.",

Machine learning methods can\nprovide highly accurate electricity price forecasts, critical for informing the\ndecisions of market participants. However, these models often lack uncertainty\nestimates, which limits the ability of decision makers to avoid unnecessary\nrisks. In this paper, we propose a novel method for generating probabilistic\nforecasts from ensembles of point forecasts, called Isotonic Quantile\nRegression Averaging (iQRA). Building on the established framework of Quantile\nRegression Averaging (QRA), we introduce stochastic order constraints to\nimprove forecast accuracy, reliability, and computational costs. In an\nextensive forecasting study of the German day-ahead electricity market, we show\nthat iQRA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art postprocessing methods in\nterms of both reliability and sharpness. It produces well-calibrated prediction\nintervals across multiple confidence levels, providing superior reliability to\nall benchmark methods, particularly coverage-based conformal prediction. In\naddition, isotonic regularization decreases the complexity of the quantile\nregression problem and offers a hyperparameter-free approach to variable\nselection.",

First, we find\nthat current energy density limitations impede short haul electric flight,\nregardless of aircraft model utilized. Second, we document that electrifying\nsmaller, lighter aircraft models serving short haul routes may be particularly\nchallenging as these aircraft require more, not less, acute increases in energy\ndensity. Third, we identify a subset of larger, heavier aircraft as better\ncandidates for electrification and note that doing so could prevent the annual\nrelease of significant amounts of carbon dioxide equivalent. However, we\nobserve that the regional benefits of electrification are highly heterogeneous.\nThe largest emissions benefit is realized in Europe, followed by South America,\nNorth America, Oceania and Africa. Electrification flights originating in Asia\nproduces a net increase in carbon emissions owing to the disproportionate share\nof miles claimed by Asian countries with a more carbon intensive electrical\ngrid.

Traditional approaches enforce\nhalf-wavelength or greater spacing among RA elements to avoid mutual coupling,\nlimiting the solution space. Additionally, achieving sufficient spatial channel\nsampling requires numerous discrete RA positions (ports), while high-frequency\nscenarios with hybrid processing demand many physical RAs to maintain array\ngains. This leads to exponential growth in the solution space. We propose two\ntechniques to address the former challenge: (1) surrounding a limited number of\nactive RAs with passive ones terminated to tunable analog loads to\n\\textit{exploit} mutual coupling and increase array gain, and (2) employing\ntunable loads on each RA in an all-active design to \\textit{eliminate} mutual\ncoupling in the analog domain. Both methods enable arbitrary RA spacing,\nunlocking the full solution space. Regarding the latter challenge, we develop\ngreedy and meta-heuristic port selection algorithms, alongside low-complexity\nheuristic variants, that efficiently handle over $10^{20}$ array\nconfigurations, and optimize the loading values to maximize the sum-rate in a\nmultiple-input single-output broadcast channel under transmission power\nconstraints, assuming a heuristic linear precoder.

    "abstract": "Detecting bad actors is critical to ensure the safety and integrity of\ninternet platforms. Several deep learning-based models have been developed to\nidentify such users. These models should not only accurately detect bad actors,\nbut also be robust against adversarial attacks that aim to evade detection.\nHowever, past deep learning-based detection models do not meet the robustness\nrequirement because they are sensitive to even minor changes in the input\nsequence. To address this issue, we focus on (1) improving the model\nunderstanding capability and (2) enhancing the model knowledge such that the\nmodel can recognize potential input modifications when making predictions. To\nachieve these goals, we create a novel transformer-based classification model,\ncalled ROBAD (RObust adversary-aware local-global attended Bad Actor Detection\nmodel), which uses the sequence of user posts to generate user embedding to\ndetect bad actors. Particularly, ROBAD first leverages the transformer encoder\nblock to encode each post bidirectionally, thus building a post embedding to\ncapture the local information at the post level. Next, it adopts the\ntransformer decoder block to model the sequential pattern in the post\nembeddings by using the attention mechanism, which generates the sequence\nembedding to obtain the global information at the sequence level. Finally, to\nenrich the knowledge of the model, embeddings of modified sequences by mimicked\nattackers are fed into a contrastive-learning-enhanced classification layer for\nsequence prediction. In essence, by capturing the local and global information\n(i.e., the post and sequence information) and leveraging the mimicked behaviors\nof bad actors in training, ROBAD can be robust to adversarial attacks.\nExtensive experiments on Yelp and Wikipedia datasets show that ROBAD can\neffectively detect bad actors when under state-of-the-art adversarial attacks.",

Building\nupon a video diffusion model, StableAnimator++ contains carefully designed\nmodules for both training and inference, striving for identity consistency.

More expensive preowned\nvehicles are purchased directly from commercial dealers, while less expensive\npreowned vehicles are purchased from private sellers. These procurement\npathways matter because qualification for IRA incentives necessitates\npurchasing solely from commercial dealers. Fourth, we demonstrate that while\nincentives motivating preowned vehicle purchases from commercial dealers may be\neffective if the vehicle is expensive, this effectiveness diminishes at higher\nprice points. The implications of our findings on decarbonization efforts and\nenergy policy are discussed.",

The ground-based and space-based observations of the HADS\nstar EH Lib are used to help making asteroseismological analysis of this\npulsating star. Following the reduction of the light curves, the frequency\nanalysis reveals the fundamental frequency as $f_0=11.3105$ c day$^{-1}$ and\ntwo more significant frequencies $f_1$ and $f_2$, in addition to the harmonics\nof $f_0$ and a linear combination. The period change rate is determined as\n$(1/P_0)(dP_0/dt)=(5.4\\pm0.5)\\times10^{-9}$ yr$^{-1}$ derived from an O-C\ndiagram, which is constructed from 342 times of maximum light spanning over 70\nyears. Using these observational constraints, along with the metallicity\nreported in the literature, we construct theoretical models using the stellar\nevolution code MESA and calculate the theoretical frequencies of the eigen\nmodes using the oscillation code GYRE. The appropriate models are selected by\nmatching both $f_0$ and $(1/P_0)(dP_0/dt)$ within their respective\nuncertainties. The results indicate that the observed period change of EH Lib\ncan be attributed to stellar evolutionary effects. The stellar parameters of EH\nLib are derived as: the mass of $1.715\\pm0.065$ M$_{\\odot}$, the luminosity of\nlog $(L/L_{\\odot})=1.38\\pm0.06$, and the age of $(1.14\\pm0.13)\\times10^{9}$\nyears. EH Lib is classified as a single-mode HADS star, locating currently in\nthe Hertzsprung gap, with a helium core and a hydrogen-burning shell.

As\nthese agents become increasingly capable, market readiness is rapidly\napproaching, which means those agents, for example taking the form of humanoid\nrobots or autonomous cars, are poised to transition from laboratory prototypes\nto autonomous operation in real-world environments. This transition raises\nconcerns leading to specific requirements for these systems - among them, the\nrequirement that they are designed to behave ethically. Crucially, research\ndirected toward building agents that fulfill the requirement to behave\nethically - referred to as artificial moral agents(AMAs) - has to address a\nrange of challenges at the intersection of computer science and philosophy.\nThis study explores the development of reason-based artificial moral agents\n(RBAMAs). RBAMAs are build on an extension of the reinforcement learning\narchitecture to enable moral decision-making based on sound normative\nreasoning, which is achieved by equipping the agent with the capacity to learn\na reason-theory - a theory which enables it to process morally relevant\npropositions to derive moral obligations - through case-based feedback. They\nare designed such that they adapt their behavior to ensure conformance to these\nobligations while they pursue their designated tasks. These features contribute\nto the moral justifiability of the their actions, their moral robustness, and\ntheir moral trustworthiness, which proposes the extended architecture as a\nconcrete and deployable framework for the development of AMAs that fulfills key\nethical desiderata.

A unified,\ntraining-free solution that works across both scenarios remains an open\nchallenge. We propose OmniVTON, the first training-free universal VTON\nframework that decouples garment and pose conditioning to achieve both texture\nfidelity and pose consistency across diverse settings. To preserve garment\ndetails, we introduce a garment prior generation mechanism that aligns clothing\nwith the body, followed by continuous boundary stitching technique to achieve\nfine-grained texture retention. For precise pose alignment, we utilize DDIM\ninversion to capture structural cues while suppressing texture interference,\nensuring accurate body alignment independent of the original image textures. By\ndisentangling garment and pose constraints, OmniVTON eliminates the bias\ninherent in diffusion models when handling multiple conditions simultaneously.\nExperimental results demonstrate that OmniVTON achieves superior performance\nacross diverse datasets, garment types, and application scenarios. Notably, it\nis the first framework capable of multi-human VTON, enabling realistic garment\ntransfer across multiple individuals in a single scene.

    "abstract": "Underwater image enhancement is vital for marine conservation, particularly\ncoral reef monitoring. However, AI-based enhancement models often face dataset\nbias, high computational costs, and lack of transparency, leading to potential\nmisinterpretations. This paper introduces EBA-AI, an ethics-guided bias-aware\nAI framework to address these challenges. EBA-AI leverages CLIP embeddings to\ndetect and mitigate dataset bias, ensuring balanced representation across\nvaried underwater environments. It also integrates adaptive processing to\noptimize energy efficiency, significantly reducing GPU usage while maintaining\ncompetitive enhancement quality. Experiments on LSUI400, Oceanex, and UIEB100\nshow that while PSNR drops by a controlled 1.0 dB, computational savings enable\nreal-time feasibility for large-scale marine monitoring. Additionally,\nuncertainty estimation and explainability techniques enhance trust in AI-driven\nenvironmental decisions. Comparisons with CycleGAN, FunIEGAN, RAUNENet,\nWaterNet, UGAN, PUGAN, and UTUIE validate EBA-AI's effectiveness in balancing\nefficiency, fairness, and interpretability in underwater image processing.

Our capability of discovering pulsations in ULXs is limited, among\nothers, by poor statistics. However, catalogues and archives of high-energy\nmissions contain information which can be used to identify new candidate\npulsating ULXs (PULXs). The goal of this research is to single out candidate\nPULXs among those ULXs which have not shown pulsations due to an unfavourable\ncombination of factors. We applied an AI approach to an updated database of\nULXs detected by XMM-Newton. We first used an unsupervised clustering algorithm\nto sort out sources with similar characteristics into two clusters. Then, the\nsample of known PULX observations has been used to set the separation threshold\nbetween the two clusters and to identify the one containing the new candidate\nPULXs. We found that only a few criteria are needed to assign the membership of\nan observation to one of the two clusters. The cluster of new candidate PULXs\ncounts 85 unique sources for 355 observations, with $\\sim$85% of these new\ncandidates having multiple observations. A preliminary timing analysis found no\nnew pulsations for these candidates. This work presents a sample of new\ncandidate PULXs observed by XMM-Newton, the properties of which are similar (in\na multi-dimensional phase space) to those of the known PULXs, despite the\nabsence of pulsations in their light curves. While this result is a clear\nexample of the predictive power of AI-based methods, it also highlights the\nneed for high-statistics observational data to reveal coherent signals from the\nsources in this sample and thus validate the robustness of the approach.",

In\nour proposed scheme, data loss in each channel is modeled as an independent\nBernoulli-distributed random process.

We then leverage control barrier certificates for\ndt-ASLS to synthesize a controller that ensures the stochastic safety of\ndt-SLS, guaranteeing that all trajectories remain outside unsafe regions with a\nquantified probabilistic bound. Our approach translates safety constraints into\nmatrix inequalities, leading to an optimization problem that eventually\nquantifies the probability of satisfying the safety specification in the\npresence of communication imperfections.

To\nunlock the unprecedented critique capabilities, we propose RefCritic, a\nlong-chain-of-thought critic module based on reinforcement learning with dual\nrule-based rewards: (1) instance-level correctness of solution judgments and\n(2) refinement accuracies of the policy model based on critiques, aiming to\ngenerate high-quality evaluations with actionable feedback that effectively\nguides model refinement. We evaluate RefCritic on Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct and\nDeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B across five benchmarks. On critique and refinement\nsettings, RefCritic demonstrates consistent advantages across all benchmarks,\ne.g., 6.8\\% and 7.2\\% gains on AIME25 for the respective base models.

Unlike\nprevious approaches that implement partial constraints, our framework\nsimultaneously enforces mass conservation and both momentum equations, ensuring\nfull adherence to Newton's laws throughout the prediction process. The model\nintegrates a convolutional encoder-decoder architecture with ConvLSTM temporal\nprocessing, trained using a composite loss function that balances data fidelity\nwith physics-based residuals. Using six historical storm events (four for\ntraining, one for validation, and one held-out for unseen testing), we observe\nsubstantial improvements over baseline neural networks. ALPINE reduces\ndomain-averaged prediction errors and improves model skill metrics for water\nsurface elevation and velocity components. Physics-informed constraints prove\nmost valuable during peak storm intensity, when multiple flood drivers interact\nand reliable predictions matter most.

For\n1-motives with good reduction over $p$-adic local fields, we construct a\n$p$-adic integration pairing that generalizes the Colmez--Fontaine--Messing\ntheory for abelian varieties. This pairing is bilinear, perfect,\nGalois-equivariant, and compatible with the Hodge filtration, taking values in\na quotient of the de Rham period ring.\n  Building on this construction, we introduce a stratified formalism for\n$p$-adic periods, defining period spaces at various depths that capture\nincreasingly refined relations among periods, and formulating conjectures that\nmirror the Grothendieck period conjecture in this new context. The classical\nperiod conjecture for 1-motives over $\\bar{Q}$, previously resolved via the\nHuber--Wustholz analytic subgroup theorem, is recovered at depth 1 in our\nframework.

Therefore, to ensure the correctness of\nfloating-point programs, the effect of floating point error needs to be\ncarefully taken into account. In this work, we consider the invariant\ngeneration for floating point programs, whose aim is to generate tight\ninvariants under the perturbation of floating point errors. Our main\ncontribution is a theoretical framework on how to apply constraint solving\nmethods to address the invariant generation problem. In our framework, we\npropose a novel combination between the first-order differential\ncharacterization by FPTaylor (TOPLAS 2018) and constraint solving methods,\naiming to reduce the computational burden of constraint solving. Moreover, we\ndevise two polynomial invariant generation algorithms to instantiate the\nframework. The first algorithm is applicable to a wide range of floating-point\noperations but requires an initial (coarse) invariant as external input, while\nthe second does not require an initial invariant but is limited to polynomial\nprograms.

    "abstract": "These notes expand upon our lectures on {\\em profinite rigidity} at the\ninternational colloquium on randomness, geometry and dynamics, organised by\nTIFR Mumbai at IISER Pune in January 2024. We are interested in the extent to\nwhich groups that arise in hyperbolic geometry and 3-manifold topology are\ndetermined by their finite quotients. The main theme of these notes is the\nradical extent to which rigidity is lost when one passes from consideration of\ngroups with hyperbolic features to consideration of their direct products. We\ndescribe a general method for producing infinite sequences of {\\em{Grothendieck\npairs,}} i.e.~embeddings $P_i\\hookrightarrow G\\times G$ inducing isomorphisms\nof profinite completions, with $G$ fixed and $P_i$ finitely generated. In order\nto apply this method, one needs $G$ to map onto a subgroup of finite index in\nthe commutator subgroup of a group $\\Gamma$ with $H_2(\\Gamma,\\mathbb{Z})=0$,\nand $\\Gamma$ should be relatively hyperbolic. By exploiting the flexibility of\nthe construction, we explain how, under the same hypotheses on $G$, one can\nconstruct {\\em uncountable families} of pairwise non-isomorphic subgroups\n$P_\\lambda$ such that $P_\\lambda\\hookrightarrow G\\times G$ induces an\nisomorphism of profinite completions. Examples of groups $G$ satisfying these\nconditions include the fundamental group of the Weeks manifold and the\nfundamental group of the 4-fold branch cover of the figure-8 knot complement.\nBoth of these examples are profinitely rigid in the absolute sense and in each\ncase Grothendieck pairs account entirely for the loss of profinite rigidity for\n$G\\times G$: if $H$ is a finitely generated group whose profinite completion is\nisomorphic to that of $G\\times G$, then there is an embedding $H\\hookrightarrow\nG\\times G$ that is a Grothendieck pair.",

    "abstract": "Accurately identifying and representing object edges is a challenging task in\ncomputer vision and image processing. The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has\nsignificantly influenced the field of image segmentation, but suffers from high\nmemory consumption and long inference times, limiting its efficiency in\nreal-time applications. To address these limitations, Fast Segment Anything\n(FastSAM) was proposed, achieving real-time segmentation. However, FastSAM\noften generates jagged edges that deviate from the true object shapes.\nTherefore, this paper introduces a novel refinement approach using B-Spline\ncurve fitting techniques to enhance the edge quality in FastSAM. Leveraging the\nrobust shape control and flexible geometric construction of B-Splines, a\nfour-stage refining process involving two rounds of curve fitting is employed\nto effectively smooth jagged edges. This approach significantly improves the\nvisual quality and analytical accuracy of object edges without compromising\ncritical geometric information. The proposed method improves the practical\nutility of FastSAM by improving segmentation accuracy while maintaining\nreal-time processing capabilities. This advancement unlocks greater potential\nfor FastSAM technology in various real-world scenarios, such as industrial\nautomation, medical imaging, and autonomous systems, where precise and\nefficient edge recognition is crucial.",

    "abstract": "In our previous work, we proposed a novel neuron model based on symmetric\ndifferential equations and demonstrated its potential as an efficient signal\npropagator. Building upon that foundation, the present study delves deeper into\nthe intrinsic dynamics and functional diversity of this model. By\nsystematically exploring the parameter space and employing a range of\nmathematical analysis tools, we theoretically reveal the system 's core\nproperty of functional duality. Specifically, the model exhibits two distinct\ntrajectory behaviors: one is asymptotically stable, corresponding to a reliable\nsignal propagator; the other is Lyapunov stable, characterized by sustained\nself-excited oscillations, functioning as a signal generator. To enable\neffective monitoring and prediction of system states during simulations, we\nintroduce a novel intermediate-state metric termed on-road energy. Simulation\nresults confirm that transitions between the two functional modes can be\ninduced through parameter adjustments or modifications to the connection\nstructure. Moreover, we show that oscillations can be effectively suppressed by\nintroducing external signals. These findings draw a compelling parallel to the\ndual roles of biological neurons in both information transmission and rhythm\ngeneration, thereby establishing a solid theoretical basis and a clear\nfunctional roadmap for the broader application of this model in neuromorphic\nengineering.",

Applying this method to Singapore's electricity demand, analysis of\nmulti-year historical data (2004-2022) reveals that its relative hourly load\nhas remained statistically stable, with an overall percentage deviation of\n4.24% across seasonality indices. Utilizing these stability findings,\nfive-year-ahead total yearly forecasts were generated using GDP as a predictor,\nand hourly loads were forecasted using hourly seasonality index fractions. The\nmaximum Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) across multiple experiments for\nsix-year-ahead forecasts was 6.87%. The methodology was further applied to\nBelgium (an OECD country) and Bulgaria (a non-OECD country), yielding MAPE\nvalues of 6.81% and 5.64%, respectively.

Unlike approaches that address\ndiscretization errors through complex distributional modeling, RvTC eliminates\nmanual vocabulary crafting through straightforward bin increase, achieving\nstate-of-the-art performance on four image assessment datasets using only\nimages. More importantly, we demonstrate that data-specific prompts\ndramatically improve performance. Unlike generic task descriptions, prompts\ncontaining semantic information about specific images enable MLLMs to leverage\ncross-modal understanding. On the AVA dataset, adding challenge titles to\nprompts improves correlations from 0.83 to 0.90, a new state-of-the-art. We\ndemonstrate through empirical evidence from the AVA and AGIQA-3k datasets that\nMLLMs benefit from semantic prompt information surpassing mere statistical\nbiases. This underscores the importance of incorporating meaningful textual\ncontext in multimodal regression tasks.",

They account for about 56% of the sources listed in the\nrecent Fermi-LAT catalog (4FGL-DR4). The optical and UV spectra of BL Lacs are\nnearly featureless, making it difficult to precisely determine their redshifts.\nConsequently, nearly half of the {\\gamma}-ray BL Lacs lack reliable redshift\nmeasurements. This poses a major challenge, since redshift is crucial for\nstudying the cosmic evolution of the blazar population and {\\gamma}-ray\npropagation studies such as indirect evidence of EBL, placing constraints on\nIGMF and searches for LIV and ALPs. This paper is the fourth in a series\ndedicated to determining the redshift of a sample of blazars identified as key\ntargets for future observations with the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory\n(CTAO). We performed Monte Carlo simulations to select {\\gamma}-ray blazars\ndetected by Fermi-LAT with hard spectra, that lack redshift measurements. These\nblazars are expected to be detectable by CTAO within 30 hours or less of\nexposure assuming an average flux state. In this fourth paper, we report the\nresults of detailed spectroscopic observations of 29 blazars using the ESO/VLT,\nKeck II, and SALT telescopes. Our analysis involved a thorough search for\nspectral lines in the spectra of each blazar, and when features of the host\ngalaxy were identified, we modeled its properties. We also compared the\nmagnitudes of the targets during the observations to their long-term light\ncurves. In the sample studied, 9 of 29 sources were observed with a high\nsignal-to-noise ratio (S/N > 100), while the remaining 20 were observed with a\nmoderate or low S/N. We successfully determined firm redshifts for 12 blazars,\nranging from 0.1636 to 1.1427, and identified two lower limit redshifts at z >\n1.0196 and z > 1.4454.

We force the flow to relax back towards vertical\nhyperbolic tangent profiles of streamwise velocity and buoyancy, with\ncharacteristic half-depth $\\dO$, half-velocity jump $\\UO$, and half-buoyancy\njump $\\BO$, with a relaxation time $t_r=100 \\tauadv$ where $\\tauadv:=\\dO/\\UO$.\nWe consider computational domains of vertical extent $\\Gz=48$ with a range of\nhorizontal extents $16\\leq\\Gh\\leq512$.

M-dwarf stars offer a\npromising avenue to detect and study smaller planets, especially\nsub-Neptunes-among the most common exoplanet types. K2-18 b, a temperate\nsub-Neptune in an M-dwarf habitable zone, has been observed with HST and JWST,\nrevealing an H2-rich atmosphere with CH4 and possible CO2. Conflicting\ninterpretations highlight the importance of non-equilibrium chemistry, which is\ncritical for constraining atmospheric parameters like metallicity, C/O ratio,\nand vertical mixing (Kzz). This study explores the parameter space of\nmetallicity, C/O ratio, and Kzz for K2-18 b using the non-equilibrium chemistry\nmodel FRECKLL and JWST data. We generated spectra from a 3D grid of models and\ncompared them to observations to refine atmospheric constraints. A fixed\npressure-temperature profile was used to capture first-order chemical trends,\nacknowledging some uncertainties. Our best-fit model favors high metallicity\n(266^{+291}_{-104} at 2 sigma) and high C/O ratio (C/O > 2.1 at 2 sigma). CH4\nis robustly detected (log10[CH4] = -0.3^{+0.1}_{-1.7} at 1 mbar), while CO2\nremains uncertain due to spectral noise. Kzz has no clear impact on the fit and\nremains unconstrained. Non-equilibrium models outperform flat spectra at > 4\nsigma confidence, confirming atmospheric features. Minor species, such as H2O\nand NH3, may be present but are likely masked by dominant absorbers. Our\nresults highlight the limits of constant-abundance retrievals.

    "abstract": "Consider a downlink integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) system in\nwhich a base station employs linear beamforming to communicate to $K$ users,\nwhile simultaneously uses sensing beams to perform a sensing task of estimating\n$L$ real parameters. How many beamformers are needed to achieve the best\nperformance for both sensing and communications? This paper establishes bounds\non the minimum number of downlink beamformers, in which sensing performance is\nmeasured in terms of the Cram\\'{e}r-Rao bound for parameter estimation and\ncommunications performance is measured in terms of the\nsignal-to-interference-and-noise ratios. We show that an ISAC system requires\nat most $K + \\sqrt{\\frac{L(L+1)}{2}}$ beamformers if the remote users have the\nability to cancel the interference caused by the sensing beams. If cancelling\ninterference due to the sensing beams is not possible, the bound becomes\n$\\sqrt{K^2 + \\frac{L(L+1)}{2}}$. Interestingly, in the latter case, the bound\non the number of beamformers is less than the sum of the bounds for each task\nindividually. These results can be extended to sensing tasks for which the\nperformance is measured as a function of $d$ quadratic terms in the\nbeamformers. In this case, the bound becomes $K + \\sqrt{d}$ and $\\sqrt{K^2 +\nd}$, respectively. Specifically, for estimating complex path losses and\nangles-of-arrival of $N_\\text{tr}$ targets while communicating to $K$ users,\nthe bound on the minimum number of beamformers scales linearly in $K$ and in\n$N_\\text{tr}$, assuming interference from sensing can be cancelled. When\ninterference cancellation is not possible, the following exact characterization\nfor the case of $N_\\text{tr} = 1$ can be obtained: when $K=0$ or $1$, two\nbeamformers should be used; when $K \\ge 2$, exactly $K$ beamformers should be\nused, i.e., communication beamformers alone are already sufficient.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a framework to prove propagation of chaos for interacting\nparticle systems with singular, density-dependent interactions, a classical\nchallenge in mean-field theory. Our approach is to define the dynamics\nimplicitly via a regular driver function. This regular driver is engineered to\ngenerate a singular effective interaction, yet its underlying regularity\nprovides the necessary analytical control. Our main result establishes\npropagation of chaos under a key dissipation condition. The proof hinges on\nderiving a priori bounds, uniform in a regularization parameter, for the\ndensities of the associated non-linear Fokker-Planck equations. Specifically,\nwe establish uniform bounds in $L^\\infty([0,T]; H^1(\\R) \\cap L^\\infty(\\R))$.\nThese are established via an energy method for the excess mass to secure the\n$L^\\infty$ bound, and a novel energy estimate for the $H^1$ norm that\ncritically leverages the stability condition.

Although prompt learning methods have shown promise, they suffer\nfrom two fundamental bottlenecks that limit generalization: (a) modality\nisolation, and (b) hierarchical semantic decay. To address these limitations,\nwe propose HiCroPL, a Hierarchical Cross-modal Prompt Learning framework that\nestablishes bidirectional knowledge flow between text and vision modalities,\nenabling them to refine their semantics mutually. HiCroPL routes knowledge\nflows by leveraging the complementary strengths of text and vision. In early\nlayers, text prompts inject relatively clear semantics into visual prompts\nthrough a hierarchical knowledge mapper, enhancing the representation of\nlow-level visual semantics. In later layers, visual prompts encoding specific\ntask-relevant objects flow back to refine text prompts, enabling deeper\nalignment. Crucially, our hierarchical knowledge mapper allows representations\nat multi-scales to be fused, ensuring that deeper representations retain\ntransferable shallow semantics thereby enhancing generalization. We further\nintroduce a lightweight layer-specific knowledge proxy to enable efficient\ncross-modal interactions. Extensive evaluations across four tasks demonstrate\nHiCroPL's superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art results on 11\nbenchmarks with significant improvements.

According to our previous study (Yang\net al., A\\&A, 659, A120), among them about $2.3\\times10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{kg/s}$\nparticles impact the Earth after long-term orbital evolution. We mainly focus\non these Earth impactors, analyze their orbital element distribution, and\nestimate their influence on Earth-based observations.\n  Methods. In previous work we simulated the long-term orbital evolution of\nparticles ejected from the lunar surface, and obtained their steady-state\nspatial distribution in the Earth-Moon system. In this work, we analyze the\nsimulation results about the Earth impactors, including the fraction of\nimpactors with different initial parameters among all impactors, the orbital\nelement distribution, and the projection of particles onto several Earth-based\nobservatories.\n  Results. Particles ejected from the lunar surface are more likely to impact\nthe Earth within a certain range of initial parameters. Most of these\nlunar-ejected impactors ($\\sim70\\%$) reach the Earth within one year, while\nmost of the small ones ($87.2\\%$ of $0.2\\,\\mathrm{\\mu m}$ particles and\n$64.6\\%$ of $0.5\\,\\mathrm{\\mu m}$ particles) reach the Earth within one week. A\nlarge proportion of lunar-ejected Earth impactors can be distinguished from\ninterplanetary dust particles according to the differences in their orbital\ndistributions. Besides, lunar-ejected particles may exhibit distinct\nconfigurations and orientations from the perspectives of different Earth-based\nobservatories.",

This study introduces a Signal-to-Uniformity Error Polynomial\nCalibration (STEPC) framework to address this issue. STEPC first fits\nmulti-energy projections using a 2D polynomial surface to generate ideal\nreferences, then applies a nonlinear multi-energy polynomial model to predict\nand correct pixel-wise nonuniformity errors. The model is calibrated using\nhomogeneous slab phantoms of different materials, including PMMA, aluminum, and\niodinated contrast agents, enabling correction for both non-contrast and\ncontrast-enhanced imaging. Experiments were performed on a custom Micro-PCCT\nsystem with phantoms and mouse.

STEPC consistently\noutperformed existing correction methods in both non-contrast and\ncontrast-enhanced scenarios. It achieved the lowest MLSD and RAD for both\nphantoms and mouse scans.

    "abstract": "This paper traces an intellectual journey or \\textit{Way} (in the sense of a\nTao) that starts with some unfinished work of Gian-Carlo Rota on making a logic\nof equivalence relations or partitions. Rota understood the category-theoretic\nduality between subsets and partitions which implied there should be a logic of\npartitions dual to the usual Boolean logic of subsets.And just as probability\nstarts quantitatively with the size of a subset, so he saw that information\nshould start with some notion of size of a partition. After developing the\nlogic of partitions and its quantitative version as logical entropy, it became\nclear that there is a fundamental duality, fully developed only in category\ntheory, that runs through the exact sciences. Classical physics lies on the\nsubset side and quantum physics on the partition side of the duality. The rest\nof the paper develops the treatment of quantum mechanics seen through the lens\nof partitions as the logic of definiteness and indefiniteness. The lattices of\npartitions allows the treatment of quantum phenomena in highly simplified but\nessential terms. Since Feynman saw the``only mystery'' of quantum mechanics in\nthe two-slit experiment, this new approach is developed to show how to resolve\nthat mystery. Finally, quantum statistics is treated using Rota-style\nenumerative combinatorics.",

In this\nwork, we propose a novel latent-attention based transformer (LAT) decoder for\npolar codes that addresses the limitations on performance and generalization\nthrough three pivotal innovations. First, we develop a latent-attention\nmechanism that supersedes the conventional self-attention mechanism. This\narchitectural modification enables independent learning of the Query and Key\nmatrices for code-aware attention computation, decoupling them from the Value\nmatrix to emphasize position-wise decoding interactions while reducing context\ncorrelation interference. Second, we devise an advanced training framework\nincorporating three synergistic components: entropy-aware importance sampling\nthat emphasizes low-probability regions in the signal constellation space,\nexperience reflow that introduces empirical labels to improve characterization\nof decoding boundaries, and dynamic label smoothing for likelihood-based\nregularization. Third, we propose a code-aware mask scheme which allows dynamic\nadaptation for varying code configurations. Numerical evaluations demonstrate\nthat the proposed LAT decoder achieves near maximum-likelihood (ML) performance\nin terms of both bit error rate (BER) and block error rate (BLER) for\nshort-length polar codes. Furthermore, the architecture exhibits robust\ngeneralization capabilities across diverse code rates and code lengths.",

The study of these and related thermal and kinetic properties\nhighlights several misconceptions prevalent in the literature.

Therefore, there is\na pressing need to devise cutting-edge retrieval strategies that can reliably\nachieve the desired recall. This study introduces FullRecall, a novel patent\nretrieval approach that effectively manages the complexity of patent data while\nmaintaining the reliability of relevance matching and maximising recall. It\nleverages IPC-guided knowledge to generate informative phrases, which are\nprocessed to extract key information in the form of noun phrases characterising\nthe query patent under observation. From these, the top k keyphrases are\nselected to construct a query for retrieving a focused subset of the dataset.\nThis initial retrieval step achieves complete recall, successfully capturing\nall relevant documents. To further refine the results, a ranking scheme is\napplied to the retrieved subset, reducing its size while maintaining 100%\nrecall. This multi-phase process demonstrates an effective strategy for\nbalancing precision and recall in patent retrieval tasks. Comprehensive\nexperiments were conducted, and the results were compared with baseline\nstudies, namely HRR2 [1] and ReQ-ReC [2]. The proposed approach yielded\nsuperior results, achieving 100% recall in all five test cases. However,\nHRR2[1] recall values across the five test cases were 10%, 25%, 33.3%, 0%, and\n14.29%, while ReQ-ReC [2] showed 50% for the first test case, 25% for the\nsecond test case, and 0% for the third, fourth, and fifth test cases. The 100%\nrecall ensures that no relevant prior art is overlooked, thereby strengthening\nthe patent pre-filing and examination processes, hence reducing potential legal\nrisks.",

Their performance is determined by numerous, intricate fabrication\nparameters, but not least by the number of emissive molecules N, which provide\nsites for electron-hole recombination and photon generation in the diode host\nmatrix. Counterintuitively, larger concentrations of emitters do not always\nlead to brighter or more efficient OLEDs due to concentration quenching of\nluminescence meaning that rates of radiative electron-hole recombination can\nbecome severely reduced, negatively impacting charge-to-photon conversion\nefficiency. In this work we trigger steady-state superradiant light emission\nfrom a series of Fabry-P\\'erot microcavity OLEDs by scaling the operating\nvoltage of each device with emitter concentration. We demonstrate a collective\nenhancement in the luminance of a microcavity OLED that scales\nsuper-extensively when compared to no-cavity controls fabricated in the same\nrun. Triggering quantum correlations between emitters via the confined cavity\nfield allows devices with fewer emitters to match or even exceed the brightness\nof control OLEDs even when driven by lower voltages. Moreover, our devices show\nsignificant narrowing of their emission spectra, offering purer colours at low\napplied voltages. Leveraging collective effects in microcavity OLEDs provides a\nnew approach to enable brighter, more efficient devices paving the way for\nnext-generation displays and lighting that do not compromise performance for\noperational efficiency or device lifetime.",

    "abstract": "Collaboration among multiple large language model (LLM) agents is a promising\napproach to overcome inherent limitations of single-agent systems, such as\nhallucinations and single points of failure. As LLM agents are increasingly\ndeployed on open blockchain platforms, multi-agent systems capable of\ntolerating malicious (Byzantine) agents have become essential.\n  Recent Byzantine-robust multi-agent systems typically rely on leader-driven\ncoordination, which suffers from two major drawbacks. First, they are\ninherently vulnerable to targeted attacks against the leader. If consecutive\nleaders behave maliciously, the system repeatedly fails to achieve consensus,\nforcing new consensus rounds, which is particularly costly given the high\nlatency of LLM invocations. Second, an underperforming proposal from the leader\ncan be accepted as the final answer even when higher-quality alternatives are\navailable, as existing methods finalize the leader's proposal once it receives\na quorum of votes.\n  To address these issues, we propose DecentLLMs, a novel decentralized\nconsensus approach for multi-agent LLM systems, where worker agents generate\nanswers concurrently and evaluator agents independently score and rank these\nanswers to select the best available one. This decentralized architecture\nenables faster consensus despite the presence of Byzantine agents and\nconsistently selects higher-quality answers through Byzantine-robust\naggregation techniques.\n  Experimental results demonstrate that DecentLLMs effectively tolerates\nByzantine agents and significantly improves the quality of selected answers.",

Based on this assumption, existing\napproaches aim to integrate information from various behaviors to enrich user\nrepresentations. However, they often overlook the presence of both\ncommonalities and individualities in users' multi-behavior preferences. These\nindividualities reflect distinct aspects of preferences captured by different\nbehaviors, where certain auxiliary behaviors may introduce noise, hindering the\nprediction of the target behavior. To address this issue, we propose a user\ninvariant preference learning for multi-behavior recommendation (UIPL for\nshort), aiming to capture users' intrinsic interests (referred to as invariant\npreferences) from multi-behavior interactions to mitigate the introduction of\nnoise. Specifically, UIPL leverages the paradigm of invariant risk minimization\nto learn invariant preferences. To implement this, we employ a variational\nautoencoder (VAE) to extract users' invariant preferences, replacing the\nstandard reconstruction loss with an invariant risk minimization constraint.\nAdditionally, we construct distinct environments by combining multi-behavior\ndata to enhance robustness in learning these preferences. Finally, the learned\ninvariant preferences are used to provide recommendations for the target\nbehavior. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that\nUIPL significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "Accurate pose estimation and shift correction are key challenges in cryo-EM\ndue to the very low SNR, which directly impacts the fidelity of 3D\nreconstructions. We present an approach for pose estimation in cryo-EM that\nleverages multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) techniques in a robust manner to\nestimate the 3D rotation matrix of each particle from pairs of dihedral angles.\nWe express the rotation matrix in the form of an axis of rotation and a unit\nvector in the plane perpendicular to the axis. The technique leverages the\nconcept of common lines in 3D reconstruction from projections. However, common\nline estimation is ridden with large errors due to the very low SNR of cryo-EM\nprojection images. To address this challenge, we introduce two complementary\ncomponents: (i) a robust joint optimization framework for pose estimation based\non an $\\ell_1$-norm objective or a similar robust norm, which simultaneously\nestimates rotation axes and in-plane vectors while exactly enforcing unit norm\nand orthogonality constraints via projected coordinate descent; and (ii) an\niterative shift correction algorithm that estimates consistent in-plane\ntranslations through a global least-squares formulation. While prior approaches\nhave leveraged such embeddings and common-line geometry for orientation\nrecovery, existing formulations typically rely on $\\ell_2$-based objectives\nthat are sensitive to noise, and enforce geometric constraints only\napproximately. These choices, combined with a sequential pipeline structure,\ncan lead to compounding errors and suboptimal reconstructions in low-SNR\nregimes. Our pipeline consistently outperforms prior methods in both Euler\nangle accuracy and reconstruction fidelity, as measured by the Fourier Shell\nCorrelation (FSC).",

Existing 3D visual grounding methods typically rely on\nseparate encoders for different modalities (e.g., RGB images, text, and 3D\npoint clouds), resulting in large and complex models that are inefficient to\ntrain. While some approaches use pre-trained 2D multi-modal models like CLIP\nfor 3D tasks, they still struggle with aligning point cloud data to 2D\nencoders. As a result, these methods continue to depend on 3D encoders for\nfeature extraction, further increasing model complexity and training\ninefficiency. In this paper, we propose a unified 2D pre-trained multi-modal\nnetwork to process all three modalities (RGB images, text, and point clouds),\nsignificantly simplifying the architecture. By leveraging a 2D CLIP bi-modal\nmodel with adapter-based fine-tuning, this framework effectively adapts to the\ntri-modal setting, improving both adaptability and performance across\nmodalities. Our Geometric-Aware 2D-3D Feature Recovery and Fusion (GARF) module\nis designed to fuse geometric multi-scale features from point clouds and\nimages. We then integrate textual features for final modality fusion and\nintroduce a multi-modal decoder to facilitate deep cross-modal understanding.\nTogether, our method achieves unified feature extraction and fusion across the\nthree modalities, enabling an end-to-end 3D visual grounding model.

The EGR tool guides\nthe LMM agent through a chain-of-thought-inspired review process, incorporating\ncontext assessment, individual defect analysis, false positive elimination,\nconfidence recalibration and quality assurance to validate and refine the\nSDMSD's initial proposals.

At the same time, reinforcement learning (RL) has been\nexplored to enhance LM's capabilities, such as reasoning and factuality.\nHowever, the combination of the LM agents and reinforcement learning (Agent-RL)\nremains underexplored and lacks systematic study. To this end, we built\nAgentFly, a scalable and extensible Agent-RL framework designed to empower LM\nagents with a variety of RL algorithms. Our framework supports multi-turn\ninteractions by adapting traditional RL methods with token-level masking. It\nfeatures a decorator-based interface for defining tools and reward functions,\nenabling seamless extension and ease of use. To support high-throughput\ntraining, we implement asynchronous execution of tool calls and reward\ncomputations, and design a centralized resource management system for scalable\nenvironment coordination. We also provide a suite of prebuilt tools and\nenvironments, demonstrating the framework's effectiveness through successful\nagent training across multiple tasks.",

    "abstract": "In a work by Granovskii and Zhedanov, a surprising scar state exhibiting zero\nentanglement and long periodicity was discovered in the XYZ spin chains;\nremarkably, nearly three decades before the concept of many-body scars became a\nsubject of active research. In this study, we uncover the origin of the\nGranovskii-Zhedanov (GZ) scar within the framework of the modern understanding\nof quantum many-body scars. We demonstrate that the scar subspace can be\neffectively described using the standard spectrum-generating algebra (SGA)\nframework and through a group-theoretical formulation of the Hamiltonian. This\ndescription, however, is applicable only in the XXZ limit, where a quasi-$U(1)$\nsymmetry exists within the scar subspace. In contrast, the absence of such\nquasi-$U(1)$ symmetry for the GZ scar subspace restricts the applicability of\nthese standard formulations. We propose two alternative techniques:\napproximated SGA and generalized SGA, which construct and describe the scar\nsubspace in the XYZ case. Using these approaches, we can characterize the scar\nsubspaces. We further explore the possibility of constructing\nlattice-independent GZ scars in higher-dimensional uniform spin-exchange\nsystems with centrosymmetry, using graphical rules developed for GZ scar\nconstruction. Our results indicate that lattice-independent GZ scars cannot be\nsupported on uniform lattices with odd coordination numbers or plaquettes with\nan odd number of edges, while uniform lattices featuring even coordination\nnumbers and even-edged plaquettes can host such lattice-independent scars in\nspecific scenarios. Remarkably, if certain bonds retain the full $SU(2)$\nsymmetry of the spin-exchange interaction, thereby breaking the spatial\nuniformity of the lattice, lattice-independent GZ scars can still emerge in\nsystems with odd coordination numbers or plaquettes with an odd number of\nedges.",

In this paper, we first provide an in-depth\nanalysis of unexpected code-switching using sparse autoencoders and find that\nwhen LLMs switch to a language, the features of that language exhibit excessive\npre-activation values.

These structures\nshow pitch angles of $33.5 \\pm 4.0 ^\\circ$, and masses ranging from $10^5$ to\n$10^6$ $M_\\odot$. We refer to these structures as superclouds. Nearly all known\nstar-forming regions in the solar neighborhood lie within the superclouds,\nprimarily along their central axes, supporting the idea that they are\nprecursors to giant molecular clouds. All but one of the seven superclouds show\nan underlying undulation, indicating that this is not a property unique to the\nRadcliffe wave. We find that while the superclouds have line masses that vary\nby about a factor of four, their volume densities vary by about 10$\\%$ only.\nThis suggests that superclouds self-regulate their physical sizes and internal\nstructure to maintain pressure equilibrium with their environment.

Model compression techniques such as\npruning have emerged as promising solutions to these challenges. However, it\nremains critical to ensure that application-specific performance\ncharacteristics are preserved during compression. In structured pruning, where\ngroups of structurally coherent elements are removed, conventional importance\nmetrics frequently fail to maintain these essential performance attributes. In\nthis work, we propose an enhanced importance metric framework that not only\nreduces model size but also explicitly accounts for application-specific\nperformance constraints.

These models generate impressive depth predictions; however, their\noutputs are often in relative scale rather than metric scale. This limitation\nposes challenges for direct deployment in real-world applications. To address\nthis, several scale adaptation methods have been proposed to enable foundation\nmodels to produce metric depth. However, these methods are typically costly, as\nthey require additional training on new domains and datasets. Moreover,\nfine-tuning these models often compromises their original generalization\ncapabilities, limiting their adaptability across diverse scenes. In this paper,\nwe introduce a non-learning-based approach that leverages sparse depth\nmeasurements to adapt the relative-scale predictions of foundation models into\nmetric-scale depth. Our method requires neither retraining nor fine-tuning,\nthereby preserving the strong generalization ability of the original foundation\nmodels while enabling them to produce metric depth.

Starting with\na set of 115 HLXs detected by XMM-Newton, we identified and removed\ncontaminants (AGNs, X-ray diffuse emission detected as point-like, and tidal\ndisruption event candidates) and retrieved 40 sources for which XMM-Newton\nspectra are available.

The resulting HLX population spans a\nluminosity range from $1\\times10^{41}$ erg s$^{-1}$ to nearly $10^{43}$ erg\ns$^{-1}$ and is homogeneously spread in hardness between 0.5 and 5. Half of the\npopulation has hardness ratios higher than a typical AGN, and could be\nconsidered the extension of the ULX population at higher energies.

Working in the parametrized post-Einstein (ppE)\nwaveform framework, we find that the constraints on extra polarizations are\nsignificantly weaker than those for the tensor mode.

However, the modeling of human emotion based on micro-gestures has not\nbeen explored sufficiently. In this work, we propose to recognize the emotion\nstates based on the micro-gestures by reconstructing the behavior patterns with\na hypergraph-enhanced Transformer in a hybrid-supervised framework. In the\nframework, hypergraph Transformer based encoder and decoder are separately\ndesigned by stacking the hypergraph-enhanced self-attention and multiscale\ntemporal convolution modules. Especially, to better capture the subtle motion\nof micro-gestures, we construct a decoder with additional upsampling operations\nfor a reconstruction task in a self-supervised learning manner. We further\npropose a hypergraph-enhanced self-attention module where the hyperedges\nbetween skeleton joints are gradually updated to present the relationships of\nbody joints for modeling the subtle local motion. Lastly, for exploiting the\nrelationship between the emotion states and local motion of micro-gestures, an\nemotion recognition head from the output of encoder is designed with a shallow\narchitecture and learned in a supervised way. The end-to-end framework is\njointly trained in a one-stage way by comprehensively utilizing\nself-reconstruction and supervision information.

For null rays, the torsion parameter $\\beta$ modifies the affine\nstructure, enforcing a finite turning radius $r_{\\min} = \\sqrt{b^2 - \\beta^2}$\nand inducing a torsion-mediated angular deflection that decreases monotonically\nwith increasing $\\beta$. The photon trajectory deviates from the\ncurvature-induced lensing paradigm, exhibiting a purely topological exclusion\nzone around the defect core. In the wave regime, we recast the Helmholtz\nequation into a Schr\\\"odinger-like form and extract a spatially and spectrally\ndependent refractive index $n^2(r,k)$. This index asymptotically approaches\nunity at large distances, but diverges strongly and negatively near the\ndislocation core due to torsion-induced geometric terms. The resulting\nrefractive index profile governs the transition from propagating to evanescent\nwave behavior, with low-frequency modes experiencing pronounced localization\nand suppression. Our findings reveal that torsion alone, absent any curvature,\ncan act as a geometric regulator of both classical and quantum propagation,\ninducing effective anisotropy, frequency filtering, and confinement.

    "abstract": "This study investigates the vulnerability of direct data-driven control\nmethods, specifically for the linear quadratic regulator problem, to\nadversarial perturbations in collected data used for controller synthesis. We\nconsider stealthy attacks that subtly manipulate offline-collected data to\ndestabilize the resulting closed-loop system while evading detection. To\ngenerate such perturbations, we propose the Directed Gradient Sign Method\n(DGSM) and its iterative variant (I-DGSM), adaptations of the fast gradient\nsign method originally developed for neural networks, which align perturbations\nwith the gradient of the spectral radius of the closed-loop matrix to reduce\nstability. A key contribution is an efficient gradient computation technique\nbased on implicit differentiation through the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions of\nthe underlying semidefinite program, enabling scalable and exact gradient\nevaluation without repeated optimization computations. To defend against these\nattacks, we propose two defense strategies: a regularization-based approach\nthat enhances robustness by suppressing controller sensitivity to data\nperturbations and a robust data-driven control approach that guarantees\nclosed-loop stability within bounded perturbation sets. Extensive numerical\nexperiments on benchmark systems show that adversarial perturbations with\nmagnitudes up to ten times smaller than random noise can destabilize\ncontrollers trained on corrupted data and that the proposed defense strategies\neffectively mitigate attack success rates while maintaining control\nperformance.

    "abstract": "The sixth-generation wireless communications (6G) is often labeled as\n\"connected intelligence\". Radio sensing, aligned with machine learning (ML) and\nartificial intelligence (AI), promises, among other benefits, breakthroughs in\nthe system's ability to perceive the environment and effectively utilize this\nawareness. This article offers a tutorial-style survey of AI and ML approaches\nto enhance the sensing capabilities of next-generation wireless networks. To\nthis end, while staying in the framework of integrated sensing and\ncommunication (ISAC), we expand the term \"sensing\" from radar, via spectrum\nsensing, to miscellaneous applications of radio sensing like non-cooperative\ntransmitter localization. We formulate the problems, explain the\nstate-of-the-art approaches, and detail AI-based techniques to tackle various\nobjectives in the context of wireless sensing. We discuss the advantages,\nenablers, and challenges of integrating various sensing capabilities into an\nenvisioned AI-powered multimodal multi-task network. In addition to the\ntutorial-style core of this work based on direct authors' involvement in 6G\nresearch problems, we review the related literature, and provide both a good\nstart for those entering this field of research, and a topical overview for a\ngeneral reader with a background in wireless communications",

Conventional detectors rely on deterministic\nbounding box regression, ignoring uncertainty in predictions and limiting model\nrobustness. In this paper, we propose an uncertainty-aware enhancement\nframework for DETR-based object detectors. We model bounding boxes as\nmultivariate Gaussian distributions and incorporate the Gromov-Wasserstein\ndistance into the loss function to better align the predicted and ground-truth\ndistributions. Building on this, we derive a Bayes Risk formulation to filter\nhigh-risk information and improve detection reliability.

We further\nextend our framework to leukocyte detection tasks, achieving state-of-the-art\nresults on the LISC and WBCDD datasets.

As a\nresult, existing approaches may fall short in scenarios where diverse and\ncomplex contexts need to be integrated.\n  To address this gap, we propose a novel KG integration method consisting of\nlabel matching and triple matching. We use string manipulation, fuzzy matching,\nand vector similarity techniques to align entity and predicate labels. Next, we\nidentify mappings between triples that convey comparable information, using\nthese mappings to improve entity-matching accuracy.

However, it\nremains unclear whether RLVR truly expands a model's reasoning boundary or\nmerely amplifies high-reward outputs that the base model already knows for\nimproved precision. This study presents a theoretical and empirical\ninvestigation that provides fresh insights into the potential limits of RLVR.\nFirst, we offer a new theoretical perspective that RLVR is constrained by the\nbase model's support-unable to sample solutions with zero initial\nprobability-and operates as a conservative reweighting mechanism that may\nrestrict the discovery of entirely original solutions. We also identify an\nentropy-reward tradeoff: while RLVR reliably enhances precision, it may\nprogressively narrow exploration and potentially overlook correct yet\nunderrepresented solutions. Extensive empirical experiments validate that while\nRLVR consistently improves pass@1, the shrinkage of empirical support generally\noutweighs the expansion of empirical support under larger sampling budgets,\nfailing to recover correct answers that were previously accessible to the base\nmodel. Interestingly, we also observe that while RLVR sometimes increases\ntoken-level entropy, resulting in greater uncertainty at each generation step,\nanswer-level entropy declines, indicating that these seemingly more uncertain\npaths ultimately converge onto a smaller set of distinct answers. Taken\ntogether, these findings reveal potential limits of RLVR in extending reasoning\nhorizons.

In this paper, we explore the practicality of using delay\nvariations for hijack detection, addressing two key questions: (1) What\ncoverage can this provide, given its heavy dependence on the geolocations of\nthe sender, receiver, and adversary? and (2) Can an always-on latency-based\ndetection system be deployed without disrupting normal network operations? We\nobserve that for 86% of victim-attacker country pairs in the world, mid-attack\ndelays exceed pre-attack delays by at least 25% in real deployments, making\ndelay-based hijack detection promising. To demonstrate practicality, we design\nHiDe, which reliably detects delay surges from long-distance hijacks at line\nrate. We measure HiDe's accuracy and false-positive rate on real-world data and\nvalidate it with ethically conducted hijacks.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, 3D generation has made great strides in both academia and\nindustry. However, generating 3D scenes from a single RGB image remains a\nsignificant challenge, as current approaches often struggle to ensure both\nobject generation quality and scene coherence in multi-object scenarios. To\novercome these limitations, we propose a novel three-stage framework for 3D\nscene generation with explicit geometric representations and high-quality\ntextural details via single image-guided model generation and spatial layout\noptimization. Our method begins with an image instance segmentation and\ninpainting phase, which recovers missing details of occluded objects in the\ninput images, thereby achieving complete generation of foreground 3D assets.\nSubsequently, our approach captures the spatial geometry of reference image by\nconstructing pseudo-stereo viewpoint for camera parameter estimation and scene\ndepth inference, while employing a model selection strategy to ensure optimal\nalignment between the 3D assets generated in the previous step and the input.\nFinally, through model parameterization and minimization of the Chamfer\ndistance between point clouds in 3D and 2D space, our approach optimizes layout\nparameters to produce an explicit 3D scene representation that maintains\nprecise alignment with input guidance image. Extensive experiments on\nmulti-object scene image sets have demonstrated that our approach not only\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of geometric accuracy and texture\nfidelity of individual generated 3D models, but also has significant advantages\nin scene layout synthesis.",

The spin-3/2 nature of the $\\Omega^-$ baryon\nmanifests in its gravitational form factors as intricate multipole structures,\nwhich encapsulate higher-order deformations and demonstrate the influence of\nintrinsic spin on internal dynamics. We extract the GFFs of the $\\Omega^-$\nbaryon and apply their specific multipole combinations, gravitational multipole\nform factors (GMFFs), to quantify key mechanical observables-including energy\ndensity, angular momentum, pressure and shear force distributions, mass and\nmechanical radii, and D-terms-associated with different multipole orders.\nNotably, this work provides the first determination of several of these\nobservables, such as the mechanical radii and the quadrupole contributions to\nthe pressure and shear force distributions. Our analysis shows that the\nquadrupole contributions to the mechanical properties are generally subdominant\ncompared to those from the monopole component.

With a given number of PAs, two deployment strategies\nare considered, namely the centralized PA deployment, where all PAs are\nswitched between waveguides to serve users in a time-division manner to avail\nof beamforming gain, and the distributed PA deployment, where a single PA is\ndeployed on each waveguide to simultaneously serve multiple users by leveraging\nthe multiplexing gain. The spectral efficiency (SE) achieved by each deployment\nstrategy is analyzed: i) For the centralized deployment, the positioning\nstrategy of PAs on each waveguide is determined first with the aim of\nmaximizing the channel gain of the corresponding nearest served user. Based on\nthis, the corresponding system SE is derived. ii) For the distributed\ndeployment, the system SE under the maximum ratio transmission (MRT) is first\nobtained. To obtain an analytically tractable form, the stationary phase method\nis utilized to approximate the system SE. The approximation result reveals that\nthe average inter-user interference can be negligible with a large waveguide\nspacing and thus the simple MRT is appealing for PA-based multi-user\ncommunications. Furthermore, the system SEs achieved by the two strategies are\ncompared in both the high and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes.

    "abstract": "This study proposes a new method for computing transpiration across an eddy\ncovariance footprint using field observations of plant sap flow,\nphytomorphology sampling, uncrewed aerial system (UAS), deep learning-based\ndigital image processing, and eddy covariance micrometeorological measurements.\nThe method is applied to the Jornada Experimental Range, New Mexico, where we\naddress three key questions: (1) What are the daily summer transpiration rates\nof Mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa) and Creosote (Larrea tridentata) individuals,\nand how do these species contribute to footprint-scale evapotranspiration? (2)\nHow can the plant-level measurements be integrated for terrain-wide\ntranspiration estimates? (3) What is the contribution of transpiration to total\nevapotranspiration within the eddy covariance footprint? Data collected from\nJune to October 2022, during the North American Monsoon season, include hourly\nevapotranspiration and precipitation rates from the Ameriflux eddy covariance\nsystem (US Jo-1 Bajada site) and sap flux rates from heat-balance sensors. We\nused plant biometric measurements and supervised classification of\nmultispectral imagery to upscale from the patch to footprint-scale estimations.\nA proportional relationship between the plant's horizontal projected area and\nthe estimated number of water flow conduits was extended to the eddy covariance\nfootprint via UAS data. Our results show that Mesquite's average daily summer\ntranspiration is 2.84 mm/d, while Creosote's is 1.78 mm/d (a ratio of 1.6:1).\nThe summer footprint integrated transpiration to evapotranspiration ratio\n(T/ET) was 0.50, decreasing to 0.44 during dry spells and increasing to 0.63\nfollowing significant precipitation. Further testing of this method is needed\nin different regions to validate its applicability. With appropriate\nadjustments, it could be relevant for other areas with similar ecological\nconditions.",

Sensitive radio facilities capable of\ndetecting the faint radio afterglow seen in GW170817, and with sufficient\nangular resolution, have small fields of view compared to typical GW\nlocalization areas.

We consider the compression of a memoryless source\nsequence $X^n=(X_1, \\ldots, X_n)$ in the presence of memoryless side\ninformation $Z^n=(Z_1, \\ldots, Z_n),$ originally studied by Wyner and Ziv, but\nelucidate the impact of a strong perfect realism constraint, which requires the\njoint distribution of output symbols $Y^n=(Y_1,...,Y_n)$ to match the\ndistribution of the source sequence. We consider two cases: when $Z^n$ is\navailable only at the decoder, or at both the encoder and decoder, and\ncharacterize the information theoretic limits under various scenarios. Previous\nworks show the superiority of randomized codes under strong perceptual quality\nconstraints. When $Z^n$ is available at both terminals, we characterize its\ndual role, as a source of common randomness, and as a second look on the source\nfor the receiver. We also study different notions of strong perfect realism\nwhich we call marginal realism, joint realism and near-perfect realism. We\nderive explicit solutions when $X$ and $Z$ are jointly Gaussian under the\nsquared error distortion measure. In traditional lossy compression, having $Z$\nonly at the decoder imposes no rate penalty in the Gaussian scenario.

While existing LSLMs often\nconcentrate on augmenting speech generation or tackling a diverse array of\nshort-speech tasks, the efficient processing of long-form speech remains a\ncritical yet underexplored challenge. This gap is primarily attributed to the\nscarcity of long-speech training datasets and the high computational costs\nassociated with long sequences. To address these limitations, we introduce\nFastLongSpeech, a novel framework designed to extend LSLM capabilities for\nefficient long-speech processing without necessitating dedicated long-speech\ntraining data. FastLongSpeech incorporates an iterative fusion strategy that\ncan compress excessively long-speech sequences into manageable lengths. To\nadapt LSLMs for long-speech inputs, it introduces a dynamic compression\ntraining approach, which exposes the model to short-speech sequences at varying\ncompression ratios, thereby transferring the capabilities of LSLMs to\nlong-speech tasks. To assess the long-speech capabilities of LSLMs, we develop\na long-speech understanding benchmark called LongSpeech-Eval. Experiments show\nthat our method exhibits strong performance in both long-speech and\nshort-speech tasks, while greatly improving inference efficiency.",

The simulations started at the protoplanetary disk stage, when\nplanetesimals formed and accreted into protoplanets, and continued past the\nlate stage of giant impacts. We explored the effect of different parameters,\nsuch as the initial radial distribution of planetesimals and Type-I migration\nof protoplanets, on the final results. In each case, a thousand simulations\nwere completed to characterize the stochastic nature of the accretion process.\nIn the model best able to satisfy various constraints, Mercury, Venus, and\nEarth accreted from planetesimals that formed early near the silicate\nsublimation line near 0.5 au and migrated by disk torques. For Venus and Earth\nto end up at 0.7-1 au, Type-I migration had to be directed outward, for example\nas the magnetically driven winds reduced the surface gas density in the inner\npart of the disk. Mercury was left behind near the original ring location. We\nsuggest that Mars and multiple Mars-sized protoplanets grew from a distinct\nouter source of planetesimals at 1.5-2 au. While many migrated inwards to\naccrete onto the proto-Earth, our Mars was the lone survivor. This model\nexplains: (1) the masses and orbits of the terrestrial planets, (2) the\nchemical composition of the Earth, where ~70% and ~30% come from reduced\ninner-ring and more-oxidized outer-ring materials, and (3) the isotopic\ndifferences of the Earth and Mars.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study an investor's optimal entry and exit decisions in a\nliquid staking protocol (LSP) and an automated market maker (AMM), primarily\nfrom the standpoint of the investor. Our analysis focuses on two key investor\nactions: the initial allocation decision at time t=0, and the optimal timing of\nexit. First, we derive an optimal allocation strategy that enables the investor\nto distribute risk across the LSP, AMM, and direct holding. Our results also\noffer insights for LSP and AMM designers, identifying the necessary and\nsufficient conditions under which the investor is incentivized to stake through\nan LSP, and further, to provide liquidity in addition to staking. These\nconditions include a lower bound on the transaction fee, for which we propose a\nfee mechanism that attains the bound. Second, given a fixed protocol design, we\nmodel the optimal exit timing of an individual investor using Laplace\ntransforms and free-boundary techniques. We analyze scenarios with and without\ntransaction fees. In the absence of fees, we decompose the investor's payoff\ninto impermanent loss and opportunity cost, and provide theoretical results\ncharacterizing the investor's payoff and the optimal exit threshold. With\ntransaction fees, we conduct numerical analyses to examine how fee accumulation\ninfluences exit strategies. Our results reveal that in both settings, a\nstop-loss strategy often maximizes the investor's expected payoff, driven by\nopportunity gains and the accumulation of fees where fees are present. Our\nanalyses rely on various tools from stochastic processes and control theory, as\nwell as convex optimization and analysis. We further support our theoretical\ninsights with numerical experiments and explore additional properties of the\ninvestor's value function and optimal behavior.",

Deploying large models closer to\nthe data and users has become a key research area to address these issues.\nHowever, applying these models directly often entails significant difficulties,\nsuch as model mismatching, resource constraints, and energy inefficiency.\nAutomated design of customized models is necessary, but it faces three key\nchallenges, namely, the high cost of centralized model customization,\nimbalanced performance from user heterogeneity, and suboptimal performance from\ndata heterogeneity. In this paper, we propose ACME, an adaptive customization\napproach of Transformer-based large models via distributed systems. To avoid\nthe low cost-efficiency of centralized methods, ACME employs a bidirectional\nsingle-loop distributed system to progressively achieve fine-grained\ncollaborative model customization. In order to better match user heterogeneity,\nit begins by customizing the backbone generation and identifying the Pareto\nFront under model size constraints to ensure optimal resource utilization.\nSubsequently, it performs header generation and refines the model using data\ndistribution-based personalized architecture aggregation to match data\nheterogeneity. Evaluation on different datasets shows that ACME achieves\ncost-efficient models under model size constraints. Compared to centralized\nsystems, data transmission volume is reduced to 6 percent.

TEEs can achieve this through\nremote attestation, where a prover presents evidence of its trustworthiness to\na verifier, which then decides whether or not to trust the prover. However, a\nnaive peer-to-peer attestation approach, where every TEE directly attests every\nother TEE, results in quadratic communication overhead.

Additionally, the language models have a misaligned program synthesis\nprocess compared to humans. While humans iteratively develop code with the help\nof a compiler, most program synthesis models currently produce code in one go.\nTo solve these issues, we introduce a bootstrapping algorithm for program\nsynthesis, that supports teaching models how to repair. We show that\nbootstrapping consistently outperforms regular fine-tuning. Compared to other\nwork, our bootstrapped model performs on par with fine-tuned models that are\n68\\% larger. Notably, bootstrapping with repairing also improves non-repairing\nperformance compared to regular bootstrapping during inference. However, on our\nmodels, repairing during inference is likely inferior to simply sampling the\nsame number of solutions.

We demonstrate that this theoretical\nconstruction not only aligns closely with recent experimental observations of\nhigh-Hopf-index hopfions, but also offers a precise classification of the\npossible configurations of fiber pairs associated to distinct points. Our\nresults thus establish a robust bridge between the geometry of singular maps\nand the experimentally observed topology of complex field configurations of\nhopfions in materials and other physical systems.",

    "abstract": "Concerned with privacy threats, memorization in LLMs is often seen as\nundesirable, specifically for learning. In this paper, we study whether\nmemorization can be avoided when optimally learning a language, and whether the\nprivacy threat posed by memorization is exaggerated or not. To this end, we\nre-examine existing privacy-focused measures of memorization, namely\nrecollection-based and counterfactual memorization, along with a newly proposed\ncontextual memorization.\n  Relating memorization to local over-fitting during learning, contextual\nmemorization aims to disentangle memorization from the contextual learning\nability of LLMs. Informally, a string is contextually memorized if its\nrecollection due to training exceeds the optimal contextual recollection, a\nlearned threshold denoting the best contextual learning without training.\nConceptually, contextual recollection avoids the fallacy of recollection-based\nmemorization, where any form of high recollection is a sign of memorization.\nTheoretically, contextual memorization relates to counterfactual memorization,\nbut imposes stronger conditions. Memorization measures differ in outcomes and\ninformation requirements.\n  Experimenting on 18 LLMs from 6 families and multiple formal languages of\ndifferent entropy, we show that (a) memorization measures disagree on\nmemorization order of varying frequent strings, (b) optimal learning of a\nlanguage cannot avoid partial memorization of training strings, and (c)\nimproved learning decreases contextual and counterfactual memorization but\nincreases recollection-based memorization. Finally, (d) we revisit existing\nreports of memorized strings by recollection that neither pose a privacy threat\nnor are contextually or counterfactually memorized.",

    "abstract": "The rapid adoption of large language models(LLMs) in hardware design has\nprimarily focused on generating functionally correct Verilog code, overlooking\ncritical Power Performance-Area(PPA) metrics essential for industrial-grade\ndesigns. To bridge this gap, we propose VeriOpt, a novel framework that\nleverages role-based prompting and PPA-aware optimization to enable LLMs to\nproduce high-quality, synthesizable Verilog. VeriOpt structures LLM\ninteractions into specialized roles (e.g., Planner, Programmer, Reviewer,\nEvaluator) to emulate human design workflows, while integrating PPA constraints\ndirectly into the prompting pipeline. By combining multi-modal feedback (e.g.,\nsynthesis reports, timing diagrams) with PPA aware prompting, VeriOpt achieves\nPPA-efficient code generation without sacrificing functional correctness.\nExperimental results demonstrate up to 88% reduction in power, 76% reduction in\narea and 73% improvement in timing closure compared to baseline LLM-generated\nRTL, validated using industry standard EDA tools. At the same time achieves 86%\nsuccess rate in functionality evaluation. Our work advances the\nstate-of-the-art AI-driven hardware design by addressing the critical gap\nbetween correctness and quality, paving the way for reliable LLM adoption in\nproduction workflows.",

    "abstract": "The inherent vulnerability of wireless communication necessitates strategies\nto enhance its security, particularly in the face of jamming attacks. This\npaper uses the collaborations of multiple sensing nodes (SNs) in the wireless\nnetwork to present a cooperative anti-jamming approach (CAJ) designed to\nneutralize the impact of jamming attacks. We propose an eigenvector (EV) method\nto estimate the direction of the channel vector from pilot symbols. Through our\nanalysis, we demonstrate that with an adequate number of pilot symbols, the\nperformance of the proposed EV method is comparable to the scenario where the\nperfect channel state information (CSI) is utilized. Both analytical formulas\nand simulations illustrate the excellent performance of the proposed EV-CAJ\nunder strong jamming signals. Considering severe jamming, the proposed EV-CAJ\nmethod exhibits only a 0.7 dB degradation compared to the case without jamming\nespecially when the number of SNs is significantly larger than the number of\njamming nodes (JNs). Moreover, the extension of the proposed method can handle\nmultiple jammers at the expense of degrees of freedom (DoF). We also\ninvestigate the method's ability to remain robust in fast-fading channels with\ndifferent coherence times. Our proposed approach demonstrates good resilience,\nparticularly when the ratio of the channel's coherence time to the time frame\nis small. This is especially important in the case of mobile jammers with large\nDoppler shifts.",

    "abstract": "Reactive, semi-permeable interfaces play important roles in key biological\nprocesses such as targeted drug delivery, lipid metabolism, and signal\ntransduction. These systems involve coupled surface reactions, transmembrane\ntransport, and interfacial deformation, often triggered by local biochemical\nsignals. The strong mechanochemical couplings complicate the modeling of such\ninterfacial dynamics. We propose a thermodynamically consistent continuum\nframework that integrates bulk fluid motion, interfacial dynamics, surface\nchemistry, and selective solute exchange, derived via an energy variation\napproach to ensure mass conservation and energy dissipation. To efficiently\nsolve the resulting coupled system, we develop a finite element scheme within\nan Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) framework, incorporating the\nBarrett-Garcke-Nurnberg (BGN) strategy to maintain mesh regularity and preserve\nconservation laws. Numerical experiments verify the convergence and\nconservation properties of the scheme and demonstrate its ability in capturing\ncomplex interfacial dynamics. Two biologically inspired examples showcase the\nmodel's versatility: cholesterol efflux via the ABCG1 pathway, involving\nmultistage interfacial reactions and HDL uptake; and a self-propelled droplet\nsystem with reaction-activated permeability, mimicking drug release in\npathological environments. This work provides a unified computational platform\nfor studying strongly coupled biochemical and mechanical interactions at\ninterfaces, offering new insights into reactive transport processes in both\nbiological and industrial contexts.",
