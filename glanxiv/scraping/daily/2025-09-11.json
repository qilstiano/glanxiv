    "abstract": "Quantum Hall Fabry-P\\'erot interferometers are sensitive to the properties of\nbulk quasiparticles enclosed by the interferometer loop, with the interference\nphase containing information about both the quasiparticle statistics and the\nCoulomb-mediated bulk-edge coupling. Previous studies have explored the role of\nthe bulk-edge coupling in an equilibrium picture where quasiparticles enter and\nexit the interferometer rapidly compared to the timescale over which the\ninterferometer phase is measured. Here, we present data from a monolayer\ngraphene quantum Hall interferometer in the integer quantum Hall regime at $\\nu\n= -1$ and $\\nu = -2$. Quantum interference shows phase slips associated with\nthe entrance of quasiparticles to the interferometer bulk. Tracing the\ndependence of these phase slips on the magnetic field, we show that the\nequilibration time can become as long as several minutes. We further use our\nmulti-gated geometry to identify two classes of phase slips. The first is\nassociated with the addition of a quasiparticle to a bulk `puddle' of\nquasiparticles uniformly coupled to the entire chiral edge state, while the\nsecond is associated with the addition of a quasiparticle trapped by a defect\nsite that couples predominantly to the closest portion of the edge.",

We focus our attention on the important example of\ndissipative dynamical systems. In that case, the phase space consists of\ncoordinates, momenta and entropies; however, the momenta and entropies cannot,\nin general, be observed directly. To address this difficulty, we develop an\nefficient data-based computing framework based exclusively on observable\nvariables, by constructing a novel approach based on the \\emph{thermodynamic\nLagrangian}, and constructing neural networks that respect the thermodynamics\nand guarantees the non-decreasing entropy evolution.

It is then tested\nby calculating the rates for a simple anisotropic model for the collision\nkernel, which is compared to a thermal system. Remarkably, the obtained rates\ncan be well-approximated by the rates calculated from an angular-averaged\ncollision kernel, while still deviating significantly from equilibrium.

We introduce Pano (PACT\nimaging neural operator), an end-to-end physics-aware model that directly\nlearns the inverse acoustic mapping from sensor measurements to volumetric\nreconstructions. Unlike existing approaches (e.g. universal back-projection\nalgorithm), Pano learns both physics and data priors while also being agnostic\nto the input data resolution.

We demonstrate\nthe robustness and efficiency of Pano in reconstructing high-quality images\nfrom both simulated and real experimental data, achieving consistent\nperformance even with significantly reduced transducer counts and limited-angle\nacquisition configurations. The framework maintains reconstruction fidelity\nacross diverse sparse sampling patterns while enabling real-time volumetric\nimaging capabilities.

Although exploration reduces human effort, it lacks safety\nguarantees and often results in frequent collisions -- particularly in\nclearance-limited tasks (e.g., peg-in-hole) -- thereby, necessitating manual\nenvironmental resets and imposing additional human burden. This study proposes\nSelf-Augmented Robot Trajectory (SART), a framework that enables policy\nlearning from a single human demonstration, while safely expanding the dataset\nthrough autonomous augmentation. SART consists of two stages: (1) human\nteaching only once, where a single demonstration is provided and precision\nboundaries -- represented as spheres around key waypoints -- are annotated,\nfollowed by one environment reset; (2) robot self-augmentation, where the robot\ngenerates diverse, collision-free trajectories within these boundaries and\nreconnects to the original demonstration. This design improves the data\ncollection efficiency by minimizing human effort while ensuring safety.\nExtensive evaluations in simulation and real-world manipulation tasks show that\nSART achieves substantially higher success rates than policies trained solely\non human-collected demonstrations.

For this purpose, we first give an infinitesimal bialgebra\nstructure for averaging commutative associative algebras and characterize it by\ndouble constructions of averaging Frobenius commutative algebras. To find the\nbialgebra counterpart of perm algebras that is induced by such averaging\nbialgebras, we need a new two-part splitting of the multiplication in a perm\nalgebra, which differs from the usual splitting of the perm algebra (into the\npre-perm algebra) by the characterized representation. This gives rise to the\nnotion of an averaging-pre-perm algebra, or simply an apre-perm algebra.\nFurthermore, the notion of special apre-perm algebras which are apre-perm\nalgebras with the second multiplications being commutative is introduced as the\nunderlying algebra structure of perm algebras with nondegenerate symmetric\nleft-invariant bilinear forms. The latter are also the induced structures of\nsymmetric Frobenius commutative algebras with averaging operators.\nConsequently, a double construction of averaging Frobenius commutative algebra\ngives rise to a Manin triple of special apre-perm algebras. In terms of\nbialgebra structures, this means that an averaging commutative and\ncocommutative infinitesimal bialgebra gives rise to a special apre-perm\nbialgebra.",

Here\nwe present a model of very high energy particle acceleration in these extended\njets. In the `minimalist' model (discussed in Churazov, Khabibullin, and Bykov,\n2024), a collimated outflow aligned with the rotation axis is propagating\nthrough a more isotropic wind produced by the accretion disk. The observed\nextended X-ray jets with bright knots in this model are associated with the\nformation of strong recollimation MHD shocks after the collision of the\ncollimated outflow with the isotropic wind termination surface. The spectra of\nelectrons and protons up to PeV energies are simulated with a nonlinear Monte\nCarlo model of diffusive shock acceleration with turbulent magnetic field\namplification. The overall efficiency of the jets power transfer to accelerated\nprotons in this model is above 10\\% and about 0.5\\% for electrons above 50 TeV.\nThe magnetic field amplification by Bell's instability due to the electric\ncurrent of cosmic rays escaping the accelerator produces highly anisotropic\nmagnetic turbulence in the shock downstream. This results in the polarized\nsynchrotron X-ray emission with the photon electric vector predominantly\ntransverse to the jet direction and the degree of polarization above 20\\%. The\nmodel is able to reproduce the observed spectra and intensity profiles of\nnon-thermal X-ray and gamma-ray emission, which are both dominated by the\nleptonic radiation.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the time-evolution of elastoplastic materials reinforced by\nrandomly distributed long-range interactions. Starting from a rate-independent\nsystem on a discrete spring lattice that combines local linearized elasticity,\ngradient-regularized plasticity and stochastic non-local links modeling stiff\nfibers, we establish a discrete-to-continuum limit in the energetic\nformulation. We prove that as the lattice spacing tends to zero, an\nevolutionary solution of the discrete system converges to the unique energetic\nsolution of a continuum limit problem. The limiting continuum model couples\nclassical elastoplasticity with a non-local energy featuring fractional-order\ninteractions that capture the homogenized influence of random long-range\nreinforcements. These results extend previous static homogenization studies by\nrigorously treating path-dependent dissipation and showing existence,\nuniqueness and Lipschitz continuity of the evolving solutions. The work\ntherefore provides a mathematical foundation for simulating time-dependent\nmechanical response of fiber-reinforced composites with random architecture.",

Ordered consensus augments the specification of SMR to\ninclude specific guarantees on such order, with a focus on limiting the\ninfluence of Byzantine nodes. Real-world ordering manipulations, however, can\nand do happen even without Byzantine replicas, typically because of factors,\nsuch as faster networks or closer proximity to the blockchain infrastructure,\nthat give some clients an unfair advantage. To address this challenge, this\npaper proceeds to extend ordered consensus by requiring it to also support\nequal opportunity, a concrete notion of fairness, widely adopted in social\nsciences. Informally, equal opportunity requires that two candidates who,\naccording to a set of criteria deemed to be relevant, are equally qualified for\na position (in our case, a specific slot in the SMR total order), should have\nan equal chance of landing it. We show how randomness can be leveraged to keep\nbias in check, and, to this end, introduce the secret random oracle (SRO), a\nsystem component that generates randomness in a fault-tolerant manner. We\ndescribe two SRO designs based, respectively, on trusted hardware and threshold\nverifiable random functions, and instantiate them in Bercow, a new ordered\nconsensus protocol that, by approximating equal opportunity up to within a\nconfigurable factor, can effectively mitigate well-known ordering attacks in\nSMR-based blockchains.",

However, the planet requires much more time to significantly alter\nits rotation rate under the influence of moon-generated tides. The situation\nbecomes more complex for close-in planets, as star-generated tides come into\nplay and compete with the moon-generated tides. Synchronisation of the planet\nby its moon changes the tidal dynamics of the entire star-planet-moon system\nand can lead to long-term stable configurations. In this paper, we demonstrate\nthat a certain initial condition must be met for this to occur. Based on the\nangular-momentum conservation, the derived condition is universal and bears no\ndependence upon the planet's internal structure or tidal dissipation model. It\nis applicable to dwindling systems as well as tidally expanding orbits, and to\nthe cases of initially retrograde motion.

We establish a unified information-theoretic framework revealing\nthese industry-standard metrics as instances of classical information\ndivergences. Specifically, we prove that IV exactly equals PSI (Jeffreys\ndivergence) computed between good and bad credit outcomes over identical bins.\nThrough the delta method applied to WoE transformations, we derive standard\nerrors for IV and PSI, enabling formal hypothesis testing and probabilistic\nfairness constraints for the first time. We formalize credit modeling's\ninherent performance-fairness trade-off as maximizing IV for predictive power\nwhile minimizing IV for protected attributes. Using automated binning with\ndepth-1 XGBoost stumps, we compare three encoding strategies: logistic\nregression with one-hot encoding, WoE transformation, and constrained XGBoost.\nAll methods achieve comparable predictive performance (AUC 0.82-0.84),\ndemonstrating that principled, information-theoretic binning outweighs encoding\nchoice. Mixed-integer programming traces Pareto-efficient solutions along the\nperformance-fairness frontier with uncertainty quantification.

This is a universal problem that also exists beyond\nsoftware engineering tasks: any AI system should be more than correct - it must\nalso be cost-effective. To address this gap, we introduce SWE-Effi, a set of\nnew metrics to re-evaluate AI systems in terms of holistic effectiveness\nscores. We define effectiveness as the balance between the accuracy of outcome\n(e.g., issue resolve rate) and the resources consumed (e.g., token and time).\nIn this paper, we specifically focus on the software engineering scenario by\nre-ranking popular AI systems for issue resolution on a subset of the SWE-bench\nbenchmark using our new multi-dimensional metrics. We found that AI system's\neffectiveness depends not just on the scaffold itself, but on how well it\nintegrates with the base model, which is key to achieving strong performance in\na resource-efficient manner. We also identified systematic challenges such as\nthe \"token snowball\" effect and, more significantly, a pattern of \"expensive\nfailures\". In these cases, agents consume excessive resources while stuck on\nunsolvable tasks - an issue that not only limits practical deployment but also\ndrives up the cost of failed rollouts during RL training. Lastly, we observed a\nclear trade-off between effectiveness under the token budget and effectiveness\nunder the time budget, which plays a crucial role in managing project budgets\nand enabling scalable reinforcement learning, where fast responses are\nessential.",

Results: The time history agreement (CORA scores) between the\nheadband and the mouthpiece ranged from 'fair' to 'excellent', with the highest\nagreement for angular velocities (0.79 \\pm 0.08) and translational\naccelerations (0.73 \\pm 0.05) and lowest for angular accelerations (0.67 \\pm\n0.06). A Bland-Altman analysis of the peak kinematics from the headband and\nmouthpiece found the mean bias to be 40.9% (of the maximum mouthpiece reading)\nfor the angular velocity, 16.6% for the translational acceleration, and-14.1%\nfor the angular acceleration. Conclusion: The field evaluation of the\ninstrumented headband showed reasonable agreement with the mouthpiece for some\nkinematic measures and impact conditions. Future work should focus on improving\nthe headband performance across all kinematic measures.",

This paper\npresents new patch-based automatic rosacea detection strategies using the\nResNet-18 deep learning framework. The contributions of the proposed strategies\ncome from the following aspects. First, various image pateches are extracted\nfrom the facial images of people in different sizes, shapes, and locations.\nSecond, a number of investigation studies are carried out to evaluate how the\nlocalized visual information influences the deep learing model performance.\nThird, thorough experiments are implemented to reveal that several patch-based\nautomatic rosacea detection strategies achieve competitive or superior accuracy\nand sensitivity than the full-image based methods. And finally, the proposed\npatch-based strategies, which use only localized patches, inherently preserve\npatient privacy by excluding any identifiable facial features from the data.\nThe experimental results indicate that the proposed patch-based strategies\nguide the deep learning model to focus on clinically relevant regions, enhance\nrobustness and interpretability, and protect patient privacy. As a result, the\nproposed strategies offer practical insights for improving automated\ndermatological diagnostics.",

We develop a methodology aimed at\nimproving the efficiency of the algorithm and avoiding fragmentation: First, we\nuse a 12-dimensional feature space including a range of chemodynamical\nproperties and stellar ages; furthermore, we optimise the algorithm using\ninformation from the internal structure of the clusters of accreted stars. We\nshow that our approach yields good results in terms of both purity and\ncompleteness of clusters for galaxies with different types of accretion\nhistories. We also evaluate the decrease in efficiency due to contamination by\nin situ stars. While for accreted-only haloes the algorithm matches well the\nrecovered clusters with the individual progenitors and is able to recover\naccretion events up to a redshift of accretion $z_{\\rm acc}\\sim3$, for accreted\n+ in situ haloes it can only identify the more recent accretion events ($z_{\\rm\nacc} < 1$).

Common\npolicy-based methods are either on-policy and do not effectively learn from\noff-policy data (e.g. PPO), or have poor empirical performance in the\ndiscrete-action setting (e.g. SAC). Consequently, starting from discrete SAC\n(DSAC), we revisit the design of actor-critic methods in this setting. First,\nwe determine that the coupling between the actor and critic entropy is the\nprimary reason behind the poor performance of DSAC. We demonstrate that by\nmerely decoupling these components, DSAC can have comparable performance as\nDQN. Motivated by this insight, we introduce a flexible off-policy actor-critic\nframework that subsumes DSAC as a special case. Our framework allows using an\nm-step Bellman operator for the critic update, and enables combining standard\npolicy optimization methods with entropy regularization to instantiate the\nresulting actor objective. Theoretically, we prove that the proposed methods\ncan guarantee convergence to the optimal regularized value function in the\ntabular setting. Empirically, we demonstrate that these methods can approach\nthe performance of DQN on standard Atari games, and do so even without entropy\nregularization or explicit exploration.",

We derive\noptimal sink-side command policies to minimize the weighted sum of distortion\nand transmission costs. To model the uncertainty introduced by sensing failures\n(of the sensors) and packet loss, we formulate the problem as a partially\nobservable Markov decision process (POMDP), which we then cast into a\nbelief-MDP. Since the belief evolves continuously, the belief space is\ndiscretized into a finite grid and the belief value is quantized to the nearest\ngrid point after each update.

A thermodynamically consistent\nphase-field framework is developed that couples Nernst--Planck--Poisson\nelectrodiffusion with incompressible Navier--Stokes--Cahn--Hilliard flow, and\nincorporates interfacial ionic pumps as prescribed surface fluxes. In the\npump-free baseline, applied fields merely polarise the droplet and deformation\nis negligible. By contrast, surface-localised pumping drives the accumulation\nof positive ions within the droplet, elevates the interior potential, and\ngenerates non-uniform electric fields. The resulting Lorentz stresses stretch\nand displace the droplet, thin interfacial necks, and trigger pinch-off; the\ndaughter droplets subsequently recoalesce, often after wall contact, yielding\nflattened remnants. In multiple-droplet settings, pump-induced charging\nproduces lateral electrostatic repulsion and asymmetric deformation; under\ngeometric confinement, crescent bending and star-like morphologies emerge.\nShear-flow tests further show that a pumped droplet can be immobilised and\nruptured while an unpumped neighbour is advected downstream, suggesting a route\nto sorting.

Initially, the comet intrinsically brightened at $r_{\\rm H} \\gtrsim 16$\nau, with brightening parameters comparable to those of other long-period\ncomets. However, observations after late 2023 showed a gradual decay, despite\nthe inbound trajectory of the comet. To our knowledge, such behaviours have not\nbeen observed for other long-period comets at similar heliocentric distances.\nWe speculate that this might be linked to the onset of CO$_{2}$ sublimation\nand/or crystallisation processes. The surface brightness profile of the coma\nindicates a steady-state mass loss, implying supervolatile sublimation as the\nprimary driver of the observed activity. Despite changes in the orbital plane\nangle, the circularly symmetric coma persisted throughout the observed period,\nindicative of the dominance of large grains in the coma.

Our\ncorresponding auxiliary depth head helps to learn depth-aware features, which\nare encoded into spatially varying local depth tokens that condition our\nattentive cross-modal fusion.

    "abstract": "Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), particularly those detected by wide-field\ninstruments such as the Fermi/GBM, pose a challenge for optical follow-up due\nto their large initial localisation regions, leaving many GRBs without\nidentified afterglows. The Gravitational-wave Optical Transient Observer\n(GOTO), with its wide field of view, dual-site coverage, and robotic\nrapid-response capability, bridges this gap by rapidly identifying and\nlocalising afterglows from alerts issued by space-based facilities including\nFermi, SVOM, Swift, and the EP, providing early optical positions for\ncoordinated multi-wavelength follow-up. In this paper, we present optical\nafterglow localisation and multi-band follow-up of seven Fermi/GBM and MAXI/GSC\ntriggered long GRBs (240122A, 240225B, 240619A, 240910A, 240916A, 241002B, and\n241228B) discovered by GOTO in 2024. Spectroscopy for six GRBs (no\nspectroscopic data for GRB 241002B) with VLT/X-shooter and GTC/OSIRIS yields\nprecise redshifts spanning $z\\approx0.40-$3.16 and absorption-line diagnostics\nof host and intervening systems. Radio detections for four events confirm the\npresence of long-lived synchrotron emission. Prompt-emission analysis with\nFermi and MAXI data reveals a spectrally hard population, with two bursts lying\n$>3\\sigma$ above the Amati relation. Although their optical afterglows resemble\nthose of typical long GRBs, the prompt spectra are consistently harder than the\nlong-GRB average. Consistent modelling of six GOTO-discovered GRB afterglows\nyields jet half-opening angles of a few degrees and beaming-corrected kinetic\nenergies ($E_{jet}\\sim10^{51-52}$) erg, consistent with the canonical long-GRB\npopulation. These findings suggest that optical discovery of poorly localised\nGRBs may be subject to observational biases favouring luminous events with high\nspectral peak energy, while also providing insight into jet microphysics and\ncentral engine diversity.",

In this study, we examine to what extent Twitter's content\nrecommender, in conjunction with a user's social network, impacts the topic,\npolitical skew, and reliability of information served on the platform during a\nhigh-stakes election. We utilize automated accounts to document Twitter's\nalgorithmically curated and reverse chronological timelines throughout the U.S.\n2022 midterm election. We find that the algorithmic timeline measurably\ninfluences exposure to election content, partisan skew, and the prevalence of\nlow-quality information and election rumors. Critically, these impacts are\nmediated by the partisan makeup of one's personal social network, which often\nexerts greater influence than the algorithm alone. We find that the algorithmic\nfeed decreases the proportion of election content shown to left-leaning\naccounts, and that it skews content toward right-leaning sources when compared\nto the reverse chronological feed. We additionally find evidence that the\nalgorithmic system increases the prevalence of election-related rumors for\nright-leaning accounts, and has mixed effects on the prevalence of low-quality\ninformation sources. Our work provides insight into the outcomes of Twitter's\ncomplex recommender system at a crucial time period before controversial\nchanges to the platform and in the midst of nationwide elections and highlights\nthe need for ongoing study of algorithmic systems and their role in democratic\nprocesses.",

    "abstract": "In this article, we propose the realization of conformal manifolds, which are\nsmooth manifolds of scale-conformal invariant interacting Hamiltonians in\ntwo-dimensional quantum many-body systems. Such phenomena can occur in various\ninteracting systems, including topological surfaces or 2D bulks. Building on\nprevious observations, we demonstrate that a conformal manifold can emerge as\nan exact solution when the number of fermion colors, \\(N_c\\), becomes infinite.\nWe identify distinct exact marginal deformation operators uniquely associated\nwith the conformal manifolds. By considering \\(N_c\\) as finite but large, we\nshow that quantum fluctuations induce a fermion field renormalization that\nresults in mildly infrared relevant or irrelevant renormalization-group (RG)\nflow within a conformal manifold, producing standard isolated infrared stable\nWilson-Fisher fixed points. These can be grouped with ultraviolet stable fixed\npoints into a discrete manifold due to the spontaneous symmetry breaking of an\nemergent \\(SO(\\mathcal{N})\\) dynamical symmetry in the RG flow as \\(N_c\n\\rightarrow \\infty\\). Additionally, we find a correlation between the direction\nof the RG flow within the manifold and an increase in EPR-like entanglement\nentropy. The infrared-stable Wilson-Fisher fixed points, induced by quantum\nfluctuations, are linked to theories on the conformal manifold where\ninteraction operators are maximally entangled in flavor space. Our studies\nprovide an effective framework for addressing topological quantum critical\npoints with high-dimensional interaction parameter spaces, potentially housing\nmany fixed points of various stabilities. They also highlight the central role\nof entangled conformal operators and their entropy in shaping universality\nclasses of surface topological quantum phase transitions. We conclude with open\nquestions and possible future directions.",

Granulation is particularly challenging, as it affects even\nthe most inactive stars introducing substantial signals, with amplitudes up to\n1 m/s. Disentangling granulation-induced RV jitter from signal caused by\nplanetary reflex motion requires reliable models of stellar granulation. In\nthis study, we present a new approach for calculating sensitivities of spectral\nlines to granulation. We simulate near-surface convection with 3D radiative MHD\ncode MURaM and calculate high-resolution emergent spectra with the radiative\ntransfer code MPS-ATLAS. We then introduce a novel methodology that uses\nspatial variability of spectral lines across the granulation pattern at a\nsingle moment in time to compute their temporal variability. This approach\nsignificantly reduces computational costs. We apply our approach to analyze the\nresponse of lines from neutral and singly ionized elemental species to solar\ngranulation.We find a clear distinction between the two groups of lines: those\nfrom neutral elements tend to show stronger variations in line strength,\nwhereas those from singly ionized elements exhibit larger variations in central\nwavelength.

We present\nSoilSound, an ubiquitous accessible smartphone-based acoustic sensing system\nthat can measure soil moisture without disturbing the soil. We leverage the\nbuilt-in speaker and microphone to perform a vertical scan mechanism to\naccurately measure moisture without any calibration. Unlike existing work that\nuse transmissive properties, we propose an alternate model for acoustic\nreflections in soil based on the surface roughness effect to enable moisture\nsensing without disturbing the soil. The system works by sending acoustic\nchirps towards the soil and recording the reflections during a vertical scan,\nwhich are then processed and fed to a convolutional neural network for\non-device soil moisture estimation with negligible computational, memory, or\npower overhead. We evaluated the system by training with curated soils in boxes\nin the lab and testing in the outdoor fields and show that SoilSound achieves a\nmean absolute error (MAE) of 2.39% across 10 different locations. Overall, the\nevaluation shows that SoilSound can accurately track soil moisture levels\nranging from 15.9% to 34.0% across multiple soil types, environments, and\nusers; without requiring any calibration or disturbing the soil, enabling\nwidespread moisture monitoring for home gardeners, urban farmers, citizen\nscientists, and agricultural communities in resource-limited settings.",

Although Hamiltonian\nlearning has been extensively investigated, two issues recur in much of the\nexisting literature: the absence of matching lower bounds and the use of\nmathematically convenient but physically opaque error measures.\n  We address both challenges by introducing two physically motivated distances\nbetween Hamiltonians and designing a nearly optimal algorithm with respect to\none of these metrics. The first, time-constrained distance, quantifies\ndistinguishability through dynamical evolution up to a bounded time. The\nsecond, temperature-constrained distance, captures distinguishability through\nthermal states at bounded inverse temperatures.\n  We show that $s$-sparse Hamiltonians with bounded operator norm can be\nlearned in both distances with $O(s \\log(1/\\epsilon))$ experiments and\n$O(s^2/\\epsilon)$ evolution time. For the time-constrained distance, we further\nestablish lower bounds of $\\Omega((s/n)\\log(1/\\epsilon) + s)$ experiments and\n$\\Omega(\\sqrt{s}/\\epsilon)$ evolution time, demonstrating near-optimality in\nthe number of experiments.\n  As an intermediate result, we obtain an algorithm that learns every Pauli\ncoefficient of $s$-sparse Hamiltonians up to error $\\epsilon$ in\n$O(s\\log(1/\\epsilon))$ experiments and $O(s/\\epsilon)$ evolution time,\nimproving upon several recent results.\n  The source of this improvement is a new isolation technique, inspired by the\nValiant-Vazirani theorem (STOC'85), which shows that NP is as easy as detecting\nunique solutions. This isolation technique allows us to query the time\nevolution of a single Pauli coefficient of a sparse Hamiltonian--even when the\nPauli support of the Hamiltonian is unknown--ultimately enabling us to recover\nthe Pauli support itself.",

Here we conduct turbulence simulations spanning a wide range of\nMach numbers, $1\\lesssim M_{\\rm V}\\lesssim 10$, driving mechanisms, and\n$\\tau_{\\rm a}$ values. In the compressive case, we find that $\\sigma_{s,V}^2$\nscales approximately linearly with $M_{\\rm V},$ and its dependence on\n$\\tau_{\\rm a}$ is $\\sigma_{s,V}^2 \\approx M_{\\rm V} [1 +\n\\frac{2}{3}(\\lambda_{\\rm a} + 1)\\Theta(\\lambda_{\\rm a} + 1)]$, where\n$\\lambda_{\\rm a} \\equiv \\ln(\\tau_{\\rm a}/\\tau_{\\rm e})$, $\\tau_{\\rm e}$ is the\neddy turnover time, and $\\Theta$ is the Heaviside step function.

Numerical studies use\npartial-differential-equation models, for cardiac tissue, which admit solutions\nwith spiral- or broken-spiral-wave solutions that are the mathematical\ncounterparts of VT and VF. In silico investigations of such mathematical models\nof cardiac tissue allow us not only to explore the properties of such\nspiral-wave turbulence, but also to develop mathematical analogues of\nlow-amplitude defibrillation by the application of currents that can eliminate\nspiral waves. We develop an efficient deep-neural-network U-Net-based method\nfor the control of spiral-wave turbulence in mathematical models of cardiac\ntissue. Specifically, we use the simple, two-variable Aliev-Panfilov and the\nionically realistic TP06 mathematical models to show that the lower the\ncorrelation length {\\xi} for spiral-turbulence patterns, the easier it is to\neliminate them by the application of control currents on a mesh electrode. We\nthen use spiral-turbulence patterns from the TP06 model to train a U-Net to\npredict the sodium current, which is most prominent along thin lines that track\nthe propagating front of a spiral wave. We apply currents, in the vicinities of\nthe predicted sodium-current lines to eliminate spiral waves efficiently.

This paper\ninvestigates the hypothesis that a synergistic combination of these paradigms\ncan unlock superior performance and efficiency. We introduce HEFT (Hierarchical\nEfficient Fine-Tuning), a novel hierarchical adaptation strategy that composes\ntwo distinct PEFT methods in a coarse-to-fine manner: first, a broad,\nfoundational adaptation in the weight space using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA),\nfollowed by a precise, surgical refinement of internal activations using\nRepresentation Fine-Tuning (ReFT). We evaluate this approach by fine-tuning a\nLlama-2-7B model on the BoolQ benchmark, a challenging dataset for inferential\nreasoning. Our results reveal a profound synergistic effect. A model fine-tuned\nfor only three epochs with our HEFT strategy achieves an accuracy of 85.17\\%,\nexceeding the performance of models trained for 20 epochs with either LoRA-only\n(85.05\\%) or ReFT-only (83.36\\%) methodologies.

    "abstract": "Recent efforts to identify secondary variations in the Halo Occupation\nDistribution (HOD) have primarily focused on simulations examining the role of\nlarge-scale cosmic environments such as superclusters, filaments, and\nunderdense regions or voids. If present, these variations could yield valuable\ninsights into galaxy formation mechanisms, halo assembly processes, and the\ninfluence of external factors on cosmic structure. We aim to test whether\nsecondary trends in the HOD driven by the large-scale structure of the Universe\nare detectable observationally. In particular, we examine whether the HOD\ndepends on distance to key features of the cosmic web by explicitly quantifying\nthese spatial relationships. We also analyze whether HODs vary across different\ncosmic environments, defined by critical point classifications, and assess the\ninfluence of intrinsic galaxy properties such as central galaxy color. We\ncreate volume-limited galaxy samples from SDSS-DR18 and use a group catalog to\ndetermine halo masses and identify central and satellite membership.\nAdditionally, we employ a DisPerSE catalog to locate critical points such as\nmaxima, minima, and filaments in the cosmic web. We evaluate how the HOD varies\nwith proximity to these features and across five distinct cosmic environments.\nWe further examine trends related to the color of central galaxies and test the\nrobustness of our results with alternative DisPerSE catalogs generated using\ndifferent smoothing scales and persistence thresholds. Our analysis shows that\nlarge-scale environments only weakly influence the HOD. However, second-order\ndependencies may be revealed through a multivariate approach that combines\nlocal and large-scale metrics with intrinsic galaxy properties. Future work\nwith next-generation surveys and advanced modeling may achieve the precision\nrequired to detect and characterize these subtle environmental correlations.",

    "abstract": "We propose an accurate and highly interpretable fine-grained cross-view\nlocalization method that estimates the 3 Degrees of Freedom pose of a\nground-level image by matching its local features with a reference aerial\nimage. Previous methods typically transform the ground image into a bird's-eye\nview (BEV) representation and then align it with the aerial image for\nlocalization. However, this transformation often leads to information loss due\nto perspective distortion or compression of height information, thereby\ndegrading alignment quality with the aerial view. In contrast, our method\ndirectly establishes correspondences between ground and aerial images and lifts\nonly the matched keypoints to BEV space using monocular depth prior. Notably,\nmodern depth predictors can provide reliable metric depth when the test samples\nare similar to the training data. When the depth distribution differs, they\nstill produce consistent relative depth, i.e., depth accurate up to an unknown\nscale. Our method supports both metric and relative depth. It employs a\nscale-aware Procrustes alignment to estimate the camera pose from the\ncorrespondences and optionally recover the scale when using relative depth.\nExperimental results demonstrate that, with only weak supervision on camera\npose, our method learns accurate local feature correspondences and achieves\nsuperior localization performance under challenging conditions, such as\ncross-area generalization and unknown orientation. Moreover, our method is\ncompatible with various relative depth models without requiring per-model\nfinetuning.

We identify two new repumping transitions in SrOH and implement them\nin a deeper optical cycle to achieve 32400(4700) trapped molecules, a 4.5-fold\nincrease over the previous, shallower cycle. In addition, we determine the\nenergy spacing between the $X^{2}\\Sigma^{+}(200)$ and $X^{2}\\Sigma^{+}(03^10)$\nvibrational manifolds of SrOH, confirming the existence of numerous\nlow-frequency rovibrational transitions that are sensitive to temporal\nvariations of the proton-to-electron mass ratio, a predicted effect of the\nexistence of UDM.",

    "abstract": "Test-time adaptation (TTA) is crucial for mitigating performance degradation\ncaused by distribution shifts in 3D point cloud classification. In this work,\nwe introduce Token Purging (PG), a novel backpropagation-free approach that\nremoves tokens highly affected by domain shifts before they reach attention\nlayers. Unlike existing TTA methods, PG operates at the token level, ensuring\nrobust adaptation without iterative updates. We propose two variants: PG-SP,\nwhich leverages source statistics, and PG-SF, a fully source-free version\nrelying on CLS-token-driven adaptation. Extensive evaluations on ModelNet40-C,\nShapeNet-C, and ScanObjectNN-C demonstrate that PG-SP achieves an average of\n+10.3\\% higher accuracy than state-of-the-art backpropagation-free methods,\nwhile PG-SF sets new benchmarks for source-free adaptation. Moreover, PG is\n12.4 times faster and 5.5 times more memory efficient than our baseline, making\nit suitable for real-world deployment.

    "abstract": "Learning the governing equations of dynamical systems from data has drawn\nsignificant attention across diverse fields, including physics, engineering,\nrobotics and control, economics, climate science, and healthcare. Sparse\nregression techniques, exemplified by the Automatic Regression for Governing\nEquations (ARGOS) framework, have demonstrated effectiveness in extracting\nparsimonious models from time series data. However, real-world dynamical\nsystems are driven by input control, external forces, or human interventions,\nwhich standard ARGOS does not accommodate. To address this, we introduce ARGOS\nwith control (ARGOSc), an extension of ARGOS that incorporates external control\ninputs into the system identification process. ARGOSc extends the sparse\nregression framework to infer governing equations while accounting for the\neffects of exogenous inputs, enabling robust identification of forcing dynamics\nin low- to medium-noise datasets. We demonstrate ARGOSc efficacy on benchmark\nsystems, including the Van der Pol oscillator, Lotka-Volterra, and the Lorenz\nsystem with forcing and feedback control, showing enhanced accuracy in\ndiscovering governing laws. Under the noisy conditions, ARGOSc outperforms the\nwidely used sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics with control (SINDYc),\nin accurately identifying the underlying forced dynamics. In some cases, SINDYc\nfails to capture the true system dynamics, whereas ARGOSc consistently\nsucceeds.",

Although\nseveral methods have been proposed to allow nonregularity in such inference,\nits optimality is unclear due to challenges in deriving semiparametric\nefficiency bounds under potential nonregularity. In this paper, we address the\nbias issue via adaptive smoothing over the estimated OTR and develop a valid\ninference procedure on the mean outcome under OTR regardless of whether\nregularity is satisfied.

We present a Hybrid Adaptive Conformal Offline Reinforcement\nLearning (HACO) framework that separates risk calibration from preference\noptimization to generate conservative action recommendations at scale. In our\nsetting, each step involves choosing among common coordination actions (e.g.,\nwhich member to contact, by which modality, and whether to route to a\nspecialized service) while controlling the near-term risk of adverse\nutilization events (e.g., unplanned emergency department visits or\nhospitalizations). Using a de-identified operational dataset from Waymark\ncomprising 2.77 million sequential decisions across 168,126 patients, HACO (i)\ntrains a lightweight risk model for adverse events, (ii) derives a conformal\nthreshold to mask unsafe actions at a target risk level, and (iii) learns a\npreference policy on the resulting safe subset. We evaluate policies with a\nversion-agnostic fitted Q evaluation (FQE) on stratified subsets and audit\nsubgroup performance across age, sex, and race.

The infrared\nemission is dominated by a torus-like dust structure composed of the highly\nmagnetized, turbulence-supported outer accretion disk and of accreting gas\ntidally torn from the interstellar medium (ISM). At these early stages, the AGN\nis buried and Compton-thick. The near- to mid-IR escaping luminosity varies by\nalmost an order of magnitude across sightlines, largely due to extinction from\nthe inflowing stream of cold dust. Self-absorption within the torus suppresses\nsilicate emission features, and further reprocessing by the ambient ISM leads\nto prominent silicate absorption and colder IR emission. The sublimation\nstructure is stratified by composition and size, producing sightline-dependent\nextinction curves that intrinsically vary in shape. However, after repeated\nscattering in the optically thick dusty medium, these curves emerge\nsubstantially grayed. We also demonstrate that bipolar outflows from the\ncentral black hole that carve biconical cavities and reveal the central engine\nin later stages can preserve IR anisotropy and silicate features. These results\nsuggest that dusty starburst quasars can undergo a buried, IR-bright phase\nearly in their evolution.",

In-context learning (ICL) is a promising framework\nfor achieving this goal due to its test-time data efficiency and rapid\nadaptability. However, current ICL methods rely on labor-intensive teleoperated\ndata for training, which restricts scalability. We propose using human play\nvideos -- continuous, unlabeled videos of people interacting freely with their\nenvironment -- as a scalable and diverse training data source. We introduce\nMimicDroid, which enables humanoids to perform ICL using human play videos as\nthe only training data. MimicDroid extracts trajectory pairs with similar\nmanipulation behaviors and trains the policy to predict the actions of one\ntrajectory conditioned on the other. Through this process, the model acquired\nICL capabilities for adapting to novel objects and environments at test time.\nTo bridge the embodiment gap, MimicDroid first retargets human wrist poses\nestimated from RGB videos to the humanoid, leveraging kinematic similarity. It\nalso applies random patch masking during training to reduce overfitting to\nhuman-specific cues and improve robustness to visual differences. To evaluate\nfew-shot learning for humanoids, we introduce an open-source simulation\nbenchmark with increasing levels of generalization difficulty.

    "abstract": "The remnants of galaxy mergers may host multiple off-nuclear massive black\nholes (MBHs), some of which may wander indefinitely within the host galaxy\nhalos. Tracing the population of offset MBHs is essential for understanding how\nthe distribution of MBHs in the Universe evolves through galaxy mergers, the\nefficiency of binary MBH formation, and the rates at which MBHs are seeded in\nlow-mass satellite galaxies. Offset MBHs can be observationally traced if they\nare accreting and detectable as spatially offset active galactic nuclei (AGN).\nIn this work, we build the largest uniform sample of spatially offset AGN\ncandidates (328) by matching sources from the Very Large Array Sky Survey\n(VLASS) to galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Based on the radio\nsource surface density, 29+/-3% are unrelated chance projections. The offset\nAGN occupation fraction is positively correlated with host galaxy stellar mass,\nconsistent with predictions that most offset MBHs will reside in massive halos.\nHowever, this trend vanishes, and may reverse, at the lowest stellar masses,\npotentially reflecting the weaker host galaxy gravitational potentials. The\noffset AGN occupation fraction shows no significant evolution with orbital\nradius, and the agreement with predictions suggests a binary MBH formation rate\nof <0.5 per merger. Finally, for offset MBHs down to masses of 10^5 Solar\nmasses, the occupation fraction is ~30-70 times lower than the expected value\nassuming all accreted satellites host a MBH. This result may suggest a\nrelatively low MBH seeding efficiency.",

We particularly\nfocus on the scenario where PBH, with mass ranges between 1g and $10^9$g,\nevaporates before big-bang nucleosynthesis (BBN). Addition to that, we consider\nthe case where PBH abundance is scarce and there is no early PBH domination\ntaking place. On the DM side, we assume a fraction of the population is\nproduced from PBH evaporation, while the remaining part is the regular cold\ndark matters (CDMs) which is produced by some genesis processes that decouples\nlater on. Therefore, in the rest of the cosmological history, DM interacts\nsolely through gravity. Under this condition, there is no thermal equilibrium\never established between DM and SM plasma. An important feature in our analysis\nis that, for the light PBH we consider, its temperature is much larger than the\nmass of DM which is consequently produced ultra-relativistically and require a\nprotracted time to become matter-like. In this context, even though PBH\nevaporates in the very early Universe, PBH-produced DM could still be energetic\nand smooth out the small scale structure at much later time.

    "abstract": "This work investigates amplitude-dependent nonlinear corrections to the\ndissipative conductivity in superconductors, using the Keldysh-Usadel theory of\nnonequilibrium superconductivity, which captures the nonequilibrium dynamics of\nboth quasiparticles and the pair potential. Our rigorous formulation naturally\nincorporates both the direct nonlinear action of the photon field and indirect\ncontributions mediated by nonequilibrium variations in the pair potential,\nnamely the Eliashberg effect and the Higgs mode. The third-harmonic current,\noften regarded as a hallmark of the Higgs mode, arises from both the direct\nphoton action and the Higgs mode. Our numerical results are in excellent\nagreement with previous studies. In contrast, the first-harmonic current, and\nconsequently the dissipative conductivity, receives contributions from all\nthree mechanisms: the direct photon action, the Higgs mode, and the Eliashberg\neffect. It is shown that that the nonlinear correction to dissipative\nconductivity can serve as a fingerprint of the Higgs mode, appearing as a\nresonance peak at a frequency near the superconducting gap \\( \\Delta \\). In\naddition, our results provide microscopic insight into amplitude-dependent\ndissipation at frequencies well below \\( \\Delta \\), which is particularly\nrelevant for applied superconducting devices. In particular, the long-standing\nissue concerning the frequency dependence of the amplitude-dependent quality\nfactor is explained as originating from the direct nonlinear action of the\nphoton field, rather than from contributions by the Higgs mode and the\nEliashberg effect. Our practical and explicit expression for the nonlinear\nconductivity formula makes our results accessible to a broad range of\nresearchers.",

We biased the synthetic planet population according to the\ncompleteness of the observed data and performed quantitative statistical\ncomparisons and systematically identified agreements and differences. Our\nnominal population reproduces many of the main features of the HARPS planets:\ntwo main groups of planets (close-in sub-Neptunes and distant giants), a\nbimodal mass function with a less populated `desert', an observed mean\nmultiplicity of about 1.6, and several key correlations. The remaining\ndiscrepancies point to areas that are not fully captured in the model. For\ninstance, we find that the synthetic population has 1) in absolute terms too\nmany planets by ~70%, 2) a `desert' that is too deep by ~60%, 3) a relative\nexcess of giant planets by ~40%, 4) planet eccentricities that are on average\ntoo low by a factor of about two (median of 0.07 versus 0.15), and 5) a\nmetallicity effect that is too weak. Finally, the synthetic planets are overall\ntoo close to the star compared to the HARPS sample. The differences allowed us\nto find model parameters that better reproduce the observed planet masses, for\nwhich we computed additional synthetic populations. We find that physical\nprocesses appear to be missing and that planets may originate on wider orbits\nthan our model predicts.

    "abstract": "Large language models require massive memory footprints, severely limiting\ndeployment on consumer hardware. Quantization reduces memory through lower\nnumerical precision, but extreme 2-bit quantization suffers from catastrophic\nperformance loss due to outliers in activations. Rotation-based methods such as\nQuIP and QuaRot apply orthogonal transforms to eliminate outliers before\nquantization, using computational invariance: $\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{Wx} =\n(\\mathbf{WQ}^T)(\\mathbf{Qx})$ for orthogonal $\\mathbf{Q}$. However, these\nmethods use fixed transforms--Hadamard matrices achieving optimal worst-case\ncoherence $\\mu = 1/\\sqrt{n}$--that cannot adapt to specific weight\ndistributions. We identify that different transformer layers exhibit distinct\noutlier patterns, motivating layer-adaptive rotations rather than\none-size-fits-all approaches. We propose ButterflyQuant, which replaces\nHadamard rotations with learnable butterfly transforms parameterized by\ncontinuous Givens rotation angles. Unlike Hadamard's discrete $\\{+1, -1\\}$\nentries that are non-differentiable and prohibit gradient-based learning,\nbutterfly transforms' continuous parameterization enables smooth optimization\nwhile guaranteeing orthogonality by construction. This orthogonal constraint\nensures theoretical guarantees in outlier suppression while achieving $O(n \\log\nn)$ computational complexity with only $\\frac{n \\log n}{2}$ learnable\nparameters. We further introduce a uniformity regularization on\npost-transformation activations to promote smoother distributions amenable to\nquantization. Learning requires only 128 calibration samples and converges in\nminutes on a single GPU--a negligible one-time cost. On LLaMA-2-7B with 2-bit\nquantization, ButterflyQuant achieves 15.4 perplexity versus 22.1 for QuaRot.",

As first studied in the context of the\nHubble tension in our previous paper, a larger $\\tau_{\\rm reio}$, which could\nbe achieved by removing the Planck low-$\\ell$ polarization data, could boost\n$H_0$ slightly, resulting in a mild reduction of the tension between the early-\nand late-universe determinations of $H_0$. It has been shown later that a\nlarger $\\tau_{\\rm reio}$ could also relieve other anomalies including: the\ntension between BAO and CMB data, the neutrino mass tension, and the latest\nDESI plus supernovae data's tension with the standard cosmological constant\nscenario. In this paper, we systematically analyze the correlations between\n$\\tau_{\\rm reio}$ and relevant cosmological parameters in the existing cosmic\nobservation anomalies. In addition to Pearson correlation coefficients\nextracted directly from the covariance matrix, we also study partial\ncorrelation coefficients which measure intrinsic relationships between pairs of\nparameters removing the influence of other parameters. We show that $\\tau_{\\rm\nreio}$ has weak intrinsic correlations with the parameters responsible for the\ntensions and anomalies discussed. The large direct Pearson correlations that\nallow larger $\\tau_{\\rm reio}$ inferences to alleviate the cosmological\ntensions each arise from complicated networks through multiple parameters. As a\nresult, the relationships between $\\tau_{\\rm reio}$ and each anomaly are not\nindependent of each other. We also employ our method of computing correlations\nto clarify the impact of large scale polarization data, and comment also on the\neffects of CMB observations from ACT and SPT.",

    "abstract": "Does continued scaling of large language models (LLMs) yield diminishing\nreturns? Real-world value often stems from the length of task an agent can\ncomplete. We start this work by observing the simple but counterintuitive fact\nthat marginal gains in single-step accuracy can compound into exponential\nimprovements in the length of a task a model can successfully complete. Then,\nwe argue that failures of LLMs when simple tasks are made longer arise from\nmistakes in execution, rather than an inability to reason. We propose isolating\nexecution capability, by explicitly providing the knowledge and plan needed to\nsolve a long-horizon task. We find that larger models can correctly execute\nsignificantly more turns even when small models have 100\\% single-turn\naccuracy. We observe that the per-step accuracy of models degrades as the\nnumber of steps increases. This is not just due to long-context limitations --\ncuriously, we observe a self-conditioning effect -- models become more likely\nto make mistakes when the context contains their errors from prior turns.\nSelf-conditioning does not reduce by just scaling the model size. In contrast,\nrecent thinking models do not self-condition, and can also execute much longer\ntasks in a single turn. We conclude by benchmarking frontier thinking models on\nthe length of task they can execute in a single turn. Overall, by focusing on\nthe ability to execute, we hope to reconcile debates on how LLMs can solve\ncomplex reasoning problems yet fail at simple tasks when made longer, and\nhighlight the massive benefits of scaling model size and sequential test-time\ncompute for long-horizon tasks.",

    "abstract": "Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently emerged as a powerful\nparadigm for robotic manipulation. Despite substantial progress enabled by\nlarge-scale pretraining and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), these models face two\nfundamental challenges: (i) the scarcity and high cost of large-scale\nhuman-operated robotic trajectories required for SFT scaling, and (ii) limited\ngeneralization to tasks involving distribution shift. Recent breakthroughs in\nLarge Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) can\ndramatically enhance step-by-step reasoning capabilities, raising a natural\nquestion: Can RL similarly improve the long-horizon step-by-step action\nplanning of VLA? In this work, we introduce SimpleVLA-RL, an efficient RL\nframework tailored for VLA models. Building upon veRL, we introduce\nVLA-specific trajectory sampling, scalable parallelization, multi-environment\nrendering, and optimized loss computation. When applied to OpenVLA-OFT,\nSimpleVLA-RL achieves SoTA performance on LIBERO and even outperforms $\\pi_0$\non RoboTwin 1.0\\&2.0 with the exploration-enhancing strategies we introduce.\nSimpleVLA-RL not only reduces dependence on large-scale data and enables robust\ngeneralization, but also remarkably surpasses SFT in real-world tasks.\nMoreover, we identify a novel phenomenon ``pushcut'' during RL training,\nwherein the policy discovers previously unseen patterns beyond those seen in\nthe previous training process.

Both signals serve as an exploration bonus\nwithin the RLVR framework to guide the model. Our theoretical analysis shows\nthat the actor-wise bonus inherently penalizes overconfident errors and\npromotes diversity among correct responses; moreover, we connect the\ncritic-wise bonus to the well-established count-based exploration bonus in RL.\nEmpirically, our method achieves an approximate +3 point improvement over\nstandard RLVR using GRPO/PPO on AIME benchmarks.

Recent work has attempted to\ncharacterize this gap between the optimal denoiser and deep diffusion models,\nproposing analytical, training-free models that can generate images that\nresemble those generated by a trained UNet. The best-performing method\nhypothesizes that shift equivariance and locality inductive biases of\nconvolutional neural networks are the cause of the performance gap, hence\nincorporating these assumptions into its analytical model. In this work, we\npresent evidence that the locality in deep diffusion models emerges as a\nstatistical property of the image dataset, not due to the inductive bias of\nconvolutional neural networks. Specifically, we demonstrate that an optimal\nparametric linear denoiser exhibits similar locality properties to the deep\nneural denoisers. We further show, both theoretically and experimentally, that\nthis locality arises directly from the pixel correlations present in natural\nimage datasets.

Strong symmetries can be spontaneously broken down to\nweak ones, a mechanism referred to as Strong-to-Weak Spontaneous Symmetry\nBreaking (SW-SSB). In this work, we first show that maximally mixed symmetric\ndensity matrices, which appear, for example, as steady states of symmetric\nrandom quantum circuits have SW-SSB when the symmetry is an on-site\nrepresentation of a compact Lie or finite group. We then show that this can be\nregarded as an isolated point within an entire SW-SSB phase that is stable to\nmore general quantum operations such as measurements followed by weak\npostselection. With sufficiently strong postselection, a second-order\ntransition can be driven to a phase where the steady state is strongly\nsymmetric. We provide analytical and numerical results for such SW-SSB phases\nand their transitions for both abelian $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ and non-abelian $S_3$\nsymmetries in the steady state of Brownian random quantum circuits with\nmeasurements. We also show that such continuous SW-SSB transitions are absent\nin the steady-state of general strongly symmetric, trace-preserving quantum\nchannels (including unital, Brownian, or Lindbladian dynamics) by analyzing the\ndegeneracies of the steady states in the presence of symmetries.

Unlike existing VAE or diffusion-based methods,\nour higher-order motion prior explicitly models the human motion in the zero\nlevel set of a collection of neural distance fields (NDFs) corresponding to\npose, transition (velocity), and acceleration dynamics. Our framework is\nrigorous in the sense that our NDFs are constructed on the product space of\njoint rotations, their angular velocities, and angular accelerations,\nrespecting the geometry of the underlying articulations. We further introduce:\n(i) a novel adaptive-step hybrid algorithm for projecting onto the set of\nplausible motions, and (ii) a novel geometric integrator to \"roll out\"\nrealistic motion trajectories during test-time-optimization and generation. Our\nexperiments show significant and consistent gains: trained on the AMASS\ndataset, NRMF remarkably generalizes across multiple input modalities and to\ndiverse tasks ranging from denoising to motion in-betweening and fitting to\npartial 2D / 3D observations.",

Using\nreconstruction fidelity as the unified training objective, we enforce the\ncoherent bidirectional information flow between the understanding and\ngeneration processes, bringing mutual gains. To implement this, we propose UAE,\na novel framework for unified multimodal learning. We begin by pre-training the\ndecoder with large-scale long-context image captions to capture fine-grained\nsemantic and complex spatial relationships. We then propose Unified-GRPO via\nreinforcement learning (RL), which covers three stages: (1) A cold-start phase\nto gently initialize both encoder and decoder with a semantic reconstruction\nloss; (2) Generation for Understanding, where the encoder is trained to\ngenerate informative captions that maximize the decoder's reconstruction\nquality, enhancing its visual understanding; (3) Understanding for Generation,\nwhere the decoder is refined to reconstruct from these captions, forcing it to\nleverage every detail and improving its long-context instruction following and\ngeneration fidelity. For evaluation, we introduce Unified-Bench, the first\nbenchmark tailored to assess the degree of unification of the UMMs. A\nsurprising \"aha moment\" arises within the multimodal learning domain: as RL\nprogresses, the encoder autonomously produces more descriptive captions, while\nthe decoder simultaneously demonstrates a profound ability to understand these\nintricate descriptions, resulting in reconstructions of striking fidelity.",

Our architecture features a unique leaf switch and an\nadvanced swapping spine switch design, optimized to handle high volumes of\nentanglement requests as well as a queue scheduling mechanism that efficiently\nmanages quantum memory to prevent decoherence. Through queuing-theoretical\nmodels and simulations in NetSquid, we demonstrate the proposed architecture's\nscalability and effectiveness in maintaining high entanglement fidelity,\noffering a practical path forward for modular QDC networks.",

    "abstract": "The finite lifespan of advertising effectiveness, commonly known as \"creative\nfatigue\", presents a significant challenge in computational marketing.\nIdentifying the onset of performance degradation is critical for optimising\nmedia spend and maximising campaign returns, yet traditional methods often lack\nthe sensitivity and scalability required in modern advertising ecosystems. This\npaper introduces a novel methodological framework for detecting creative\nfatigue by applying path signature analysis, a sophisticated technique from\nstochastic analysis, to performance time-series data. We treat an ad's\nperformance trajectory as a path in two-dimensional space and use its signature\nas a rich feature descriptor. By calculating the distance between the\nsignatures of consecutive time windows, our method identifies statistically\nsignificant change points in performance dynamics. We further translate these\nstatistical events into a direct financial metric by quantifying the\nopportunity cost of continued investment in a fatigued creative. Through\nsynthetic experiments and case studies, we demonstrate that this\nsignature-based approach provides a mathematically principled and complementary\nframework for analysing creative fatigue patterns. To the best of our\nknowledge, this represents the first application of path signature methods to\nthe advertising fatigue detection problem, opening new avenues for geometric\napproaches in marketing analytics.",

In this paper, on mental\nmath tasks (i.e., direct math calculation via next-token prediction without\nexplicit reasoning), we investigate this question in three steps: inhibiting\ninput-specific token computations in the initial layers, restricting the routes\nof information transfer across token positions in the next few layers, and\nforcing all computation to happen at the last token in the remaining layers.\nWith two proposed techniques, Context-Aware Mean Ablation (CAMA) and\nAttention-Based Peeking (ABP), we identify an All-for-One subgraph (AF1) with\nhigh accuracy on a wide variety of mental math tasks, where meaningful\ncomputation occurs very late (in terms of layer depth) and only at the last\ntoken, which receives information of other tokens in few specific middle\nlayers.

Adding nuance to\nprevious research, through two studies (N=399) featuring vignette scenarios, we\nfind that AI-assistance labels don't necessarily make people view senders\nnegatively. Rather, they dampen the strength of character signals in\ncommunication. We show that when someone sends a warmth-signalling message\n(like thanking or apologizing) without AI help, people more strongly categorize\nthe sender as warm.

For translation-invariant\nquadratic fermionic chains with interactions extending to $m$ neighbors and\nperiodic boundary conditions, the Loschmidt amplitude admits a unitary\nmatrix-model / Toeplitz representation, which yields a work variable of the\nform $W=\\sum_{r\\le m} a_r\\,\\mathrm{Re}\\,\\mathrm{Tr}\\,U^r$ (and in models with\npairing terms -- superconducting pairing -- additional\n$b_r\\,\\mathrm{Im}\\,\\mathrm{Tr}\\,U^r$ terms appear). By invoking multivariate\ncentral limit theorems for vectors of traces of unitaries, we obtain a Gaussian\ndistribution for $P(W)$ with variance $\\mathrm{Var}(W)=\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_r\nr\\,(a_r^2+b_r^2)$ and asymptotic independence across different powers. We also\ncharacterise the conditions under which non-Gaussian tails arise, for example\nfrom many interaction terms or their slow decay, as well as the appearance of\nFisher--Hartwig singularities. We illustrate these mechanisms in the XY chain.\nVarious numerical diagnostics support the analytical results.",

Rotation is a key driver of internal mixing and angular\nmomentum transport, significantly influencing massive star evolution. However,\nconstraining rotation from spectroscopy is challenging, as spectral lines often\nexhibit excess broadening beyond rotation. The origin of this additional\nbroadening, typically attributed to large-scale velocity fields and commonly\nreferred to as macroturbulence, remains uncertain and unconstrained. Here, we\npresent the combined analysis of TESS photometry and rapid time-series\nspectroscopy using the high-resolution ESPRESSO instrument at the Very Large\nTelescope of the European Southern Observatory for the rapidly rotating and\npulsating massive star Zeta Ophiuchi. Leveraging excellent temporal coverage,\nour analysis demonstrates that pulsation-induced variability leads to\npeak-to-peak scatter as large as 88 km/s in the observed macroturbulent\nvelocity time series. We also demonstrate that time-averaged macroturbulent\nvelocities are spectral line specific and can exceed 100 km/s . Furthermore,\nthe macroturbulent velocities from shorter integration times are systematically\nlower than those derived from stacked spectra mimicking longer exposure times\ntypically needed for fainter stars. These results highlight the role of\npulsations in driving variable macroturbulence in massive stars, while also\npointing to a potential bias in spectroscopic estimates of macroturbulence for\nfainter massive stars.",

A relation in a net is a linear\ndependency over $\\mathbb{F}_2$ in the incidence matrix of the net. A\ncomputational enumeration of all orthogonal pairs of Latin squares of order 10\nwhose corresponding nets have at least two nontrivial relations was achieved by\nDelisle in 2010 and verified by an independent search of Myrvold. In this\npaper, we confirm the correctness of their exhaustive enumerations with a\nsatisfiability (SAT) solver approach instead of using custom-written\nbacktracking code. Performing the enumeration using a SAT solver has at least\nthree advantages. First, it reduces the amount of trust necessary, as SAT\nsolvers produce independently-verifiable certificates that their enumerations\nare complete. These certificates can be checked by formal proof verifiers that\nare relatively simple pieces of software, and therefore easier to trust.\nSecond, it is typically more straightforward and less error-prone to use a SAT\nsolver over writing search code. Third, it can be more efficient to use a\nSAT-based approach, as SAT solvers are highly optimized pieces of software\nincorporating backtracking-with-learning for improving the efficiency of the\nbacktracking search. For example, the SAT solver completely enumerates all\northogonal pairs of Latin squares of order ten with two nontrivial relations in\nunder 2 hours on a desktop machine, while Delisle's 2010 search used 11,700 CPU\nhours.

    "abstract": "Zero-shot Text-to-Speech (TTS) aims to synthesize high-quality speech that\nmimics the voice of an unseen speaker using only a short reference sample,\nrequiring not only speaker adaptation but also accurate modeling of prosodic\nattributes. Recent approaches based on language models, diffusion, and flow\nmatching have shown promising results in zero-shot TTS, but still suffer from\nslow inference and repetition artifacts. Discrete codec representations have\nbeen widely adopted for speech synthesis, and recent works have begun to\nexplore diffusion models in purely discrete settings, suggesting the potential\nof discrete generative modeling for speech synthesis. However, existing\nflow-matching methods typically embed these discrete tokens into a continuous\nspace and apply continuous flow matching, which may not fully leverage the\nadvantages of discrete representations. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce DiFlow-TTS, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first model\nto explore purely Discrete Flow Matching for speech synthesis. DiFlow-TTS\nexplicitly models factorized speech attributes within a compact and unified\narchitecture. It leverages in-context learning by conditioning on textual\ncontent, along with prosodic and acoustic attributes extracted from a reference\nspeech, enabling effective attribute cloning in a zero-shot setting. In\naddition, the model employs a factorized flow prediction mechanism with\ndistinct heads for prosody and acoustic details, allowing it to learn\naspect-specific distributions. Experimental results demonstrate that DiFlow-TTS\nachieves promising performance in several key metrics, including naturalness,\nprosody, preservation of speaker style, and energy control.

In anticipation of VLT-MOONRISE, the first\nwide-field spectroscopic galaxy survey to target cosmic noon, this work\nprovides clear predictions to compare to the future observations. We\ninvestigate the quenching of centrals, high-mass satellites, and low-mass\nsatellites from two cosmological hydrodynamical simulations: IllustrisTNG and\nEAGLE. Satellites are split according to bespoke mass thresholds, designed to\nseparate environmental and intrinsic quenching mechanisms. To determine the\nbest parameter for predicting quiescence, we apply a Random Forest\nclassification analysis for each galaxy class at each epoch. The Random Forest\nclassification determines supermassive black hole mass as the best predictor of\nquiescence in centrals and high-mass satellites. Alternatively, the quenching\nof low-mass satellites is best predicted by group halo mass, at all epochs.\nAdditionally, we investigate the evolution in the dependence of the quenched\nfraction with various parameters, revealing a more complex picture. There is\nstrong evidence for the rejuvenation of star formation from z = 2 to z = 0 in\nEAGLE, but not in IllustrisTNG.

    "abstract": "It is well-known that the standard instanton analysis in 4d Yang-Mills is\nplagued with the instanton size moduli problem, which renders the instanton\ncontribution to vacuum energy density (or one-instanton partition function)\ninfrared divergent. The formalism also ignores the implications of long range\n(magnetic dipole type) $1/r^4$ interaction between the small instantons, since\nit is weaker than Coulomb interaction. We show that in $U(1)$ lattice gauge\ntheory, where finite action configurations are monopole loops, small loops at\nlarge separations also interact with the same type of $1/r^4$ interaction. If\none ignores the classical interactions between monopoles, following the same\nidea as in Yang-Mills theory, the one-monopole partition function is also\ninfrared divergent at strong coupling. However, $1/r^4$ interactions among\nsmall loops should be viewed as a consequence of multipole expansion, and\nemanate from $1/r^2$ interaction between current segments. Taking interactions\ninto account, one can prove that the strongly coupled $U(1)$ lattice gauge\ntheory is dual to a lattice abelian Higgs model, and more importantly, free of\ninfrared divergences. The model exhibits mass gap and confinement by monopole\ncondensation. We suggest that the structure of moduli space of instantons, ADHM\ndata, and the long ranged classical interactions in pure Yang-Mills theory\nshould be examined with this refined perspective. We conjecture that, in\ncontradistinction to the current views on the subject, internal structure of\ninstantons in Yang-Mills theory is responsible for confinement in $4d$ ,\nsimilar to sigma model in $d=2$ dimensions.",

The proposed\nmethod introduces a time-dependent leakage mass flow rate function, which\ndynamically captures the temporal decay of leakage based on real-time inlet\npressure measurements. This functional form allows for a more physically\nconsistent and mathematically tractable representation of gas loss compared to\nconventional constant-rate or stepwise models. The pipeline system is\npartitioned into three regions relative to the leakage point, and closed-form\npressure solutions are derived using Laplace transform techniques.

The analytical model is further validated against representative\nbenchmark scenarios, demonstrating good agreement with literature-based\nresults. A comparative analysis underscores the model's ability to localize\nleakage using minimal sensor data while preserving interpretability - an\nessential feature for deployment in industrial environments.

We propose a hybrid mechanistic\nlearning framework that combines a mathematical tumor growth model with a\nguided denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM) to synthesize anatomically\nfeasible future MRIs from preceding scans. The mechanistic model, formulated as\na system of ordinary differential equations, captures temporal tumor dynamics\nincluding radiotherapy effects and estimates future tumor burden. These\nestimates condition a gradient-guided DDIM, enabling image synthesis that\naligns with both predicted growth and patient anatomy. We train our model on\nthe BraTS adult and pediatric glioma datasets and evaluate on 60 axial slices\nof in-house longitudinal pediatric diffuse midline glioma (DMG) cases. Our\nframework generates realistic follow-up scans based on spatial similarity\nmetrics. It also introduces tumor growth probability maps, which capture both\nclinically relevant extent and directionality of tumor growth as shown by 95th\npercentile Hausdorff Distance. The method enables biologically informed image\ngeneration in data-limited scenarios, offering generative-space-time\npredictions that account for mechanistic priors.",

Furthermore, these\nobservations provide a powerful tool to set strong constraints into very-heavy\ndark matter particles, with masses in the TeV-PeV range. In this paper, we\nexplore the potential of the newest observations of diffuse emissions at the\nGalactic plane from HAWC and LHAASO to probe this kind of dark matter over a\nwide mass range. Here, we model secondary emissions (inverse-Compton) from the\nelectrons and positrons produced in the annihilation/decay of dark matter, on\ntop of their prompt $\\gamma$-ray emission, including the effects of absorption\nof high-energy photons via pair production. Furthermore, we show that including\nthe astrophysical backgrounds (namely diffuse emission from cosmic-ray\ncollisions or emission from unresolved sources) can significantly improve these\nlimits. We find that the new measurements provided, specially by LHAASO with\nthe combination of the WCDA and KM2A detectors, allow us to set strong\nconstraints in decaying dark matter, being competitive and even improving the\nstrongest constraints at the moment.

Building on it, we analyze the layer attention output loss and derive\na new metric to compare cache entries across heads, enabling layer-wise\ncompression with dynamic head budgets. Additionally, by contrasting cross-layer\ninformation, we also achieve dynamic layer budgets.

    "abstract": "Some of the most puzzling discoveries of NASA's JWST in the early Universe\nsurround the surprising abundance of compact red sources, which show peculiar\ncontinuum shapes and broad hydrogen spectral lines. These sources, dubbed\n``Little Red Dots'' or LRDs, have been the subject of intense inquiry in the\nliterature. Any of the proposed explanations, from accreting super-massive\nblack holes ensconced in ultra-dense gas to extremely compact star-systems, has\nsignificant implications for the earliest phases of galaxy evolution. Part of\nthe difficulty in concretely identifying the physical mechanisms that drive\ntheir rest ultra-violet/optical spectral properties is the lack of bona fide\nsignatures -- either star-formation or accreting super-massive black hole, that\nuniquely discriminate between competing interpretations. In this work, we\nreport the discovery of several spectral features that strongly favor the\nexistence of an accreting super-massive black hole in an LRD witnessed in the\nfirst 800 Myr of cosmic time, including several rare iron transitions and a\npossible [FeVII]. Additionally, we report on the properties of significant\nBalmer absorption and find that the small widths and relative depths of the\nabsorption feature suggest the source of the absorber is at or beyond the outer\nedge of the broad-line region and does it fully cover the accreting SMBH in the\ncenter of the system. The detection of these iron features, coupled with the\nproperties of the Balmer absorption, unveils an alternative scenario for LRDs\n-- one where there are direct sight-lines from the accretion disk to gas on\nscales at (or beyond) the broad-line gas region.",

Optical,\nradio, and gamma-ray observations confirmed its nature as a compact spider\nbinary system. Optical photometry from ULTRACAM revealed a \\(\\sim\\)2.7-hour\norbital period, guiding MeerKAT observations that detected \\(\\sim\\)2.4-ms radio\npulsations. Subsequent timing campaigns using the Murriyang Parkes Telescope,\nthe Effelsberg 100-m Radio Telescope, and the Nan\\c{c}ay Radio Telescope\nallowed us to obtain a preliminary timing solution, which enabled us to find\ngamma-ray pulsations. The final timing solution, spanning 16 years of Fermi-LAT\ngamma-ray data, also displays orbital period variations typical of spider\npulsars. X-ray observations from eROSITA indicate non-thermal emission, but the\nrelatively low count rate prohibits the search for X-ray pulsations. Optical\nlight curve modelling using Icarus suggests the asymmetry is best explained by\na spot model, where uneven heating creates localised temperature variations on\nthe companion. While the optical spectra we obtained are compatible with the\nphysical properties we infer for the companion star, they were not of\nsufficient signal-to-noise to allow for radial velocity measurements, thus\nlimiting constraints on the neutron star's mass. The observed bluer colour near\nthe light curve minimum suggests possible non-thermal emission from\nintra-binary shocks, supported by the presence of an X-ray source. This\ndiscovery exemplifies the proven capability of the Fermi-LAT catalogue in\nidentifying millisecond pulsar candidates and highlights the role of optical\nsurveys in detecting variable sources suitable for radio follow-up.",

Spacetime codes have emerged as a\nnatural framework to understand error correction at the circuit level while\nleveraging the traditional QEC toolbox. Here, we introduce a framework based on\nchain complexes and chain maps to model spacetime codes and transformations\nbetween them. We show that stabilizer codes, quantum circuits, and decoding\nproblems can all be described using chain complexes, and that the equivalence\nof two spacetime codes can be characterized by specific maps between chain\ncomplexes, the fault-tolerant maps, that preserve the number of encoded qubits,\nfault distance, and minimum-weight decoding problem. As an application of this\nframework, we extend the foliated cluster state construction from stabilizer\ncodes to any spacetime code, showing that any Clifford circuit can be\ntransformed into a measurement-based protocol with the same fault-tolerant\nproperties. To this protocol, we associate a chain complex which encodes the\nunderlying decoding problem, generalizing previous cluster state complex\nconstructions.

Using over 2.4 million PMC\nopen-access publications (2021-July 2025), we also analysed full texts to\nassess changes in the frequency and co-occurrence of these terms before and\nafter ChatGPT's initial public release. Across databases, delve (+1,500%),\nunderscore (+1,000%), and intricate (+700%) had the largest increases between\n2022 and 2024. Growth in LLM-term usage was much higher in STEM fields than in\nsocial sciences and arts and humanities. In PMC full texts, the proportion of\npapers using underscore six or more times increased by over 10,000% from 2022\nto 2025, followed by intricate (+5,400%) and meticulous (+2,800%). Nearly half\nof all 2024 PMC papers using any LLM term also included underscore, compared\nwith only 3%-14% of papers before ChatGPT in 2022.

For example, in 2024,\nunderscore strongly correlated with pivotal (0.449) and delve (0.311), compared\nwith very weak associations in 2022 (0.032 and 0.018, respectively). These\nfindings provide the first large-scale evidence based on full-text publications\nand multiple databases that some LLM-related terms are now being used much more\nfrequently and together.

However, existing methods treat instruction\nconditioning merely as low-level tracking driven by acoustic or visual cues,\nwithout modeling the communicative purpose conveyed by the instructions. This\nlimitation compromises their narrative coherence and character expressiveness.\nTo bridge this gap, we introduce Kling-Avatar, a novel cascaded framework that\nunifies multimodal instruction understanding with photorealistic portrait\ngeneration. Our approach adopts a two-stage pipeline. In the first stage, we\ndesign a multimodal large language model (MLLM) director that produces a\nblueprint video conditioned on diverse instruction signals, thereby governing\nhigh-level semantics such as character motion and emotions. In the second\nstage, guided by blueprint keyframes, we generate multiple sub-clips in\nparallel using a first-last frame strategy. This global-to-local framework\npreserves fine-grained details while faithfully encoding the high-level intent\nbehind multimodal instructions. Our parallel architecture also enables fast and\nstable generation of long-duration videos, making it suitable for real-world\napplications such as digital human livestreaming and vlogging. To\ncomprehensively evaluate our method, we construct a benchmark of 375 curated\nsamples covering diverse instructions and challenging scenarios.

    "abstract": "Visual navigation using only a single camera and a topological map has\nrecently become an appealing alternative to methods that require additional\nsensors and 3D maps. This is typically achieved through an \"image-relative\"\napproach to estimating control from a given pair of current observation and\nsubgoal image. However, image-level representations of the world have\nlimitations because images are strictly tied to the agent's pose and\nembodiment. In contrast, objects, being a property of the map, offer an\nembodiment- and trajectory-invariant world representation. In this work, we\npresent a new paradigm of learning \"object-relative\" control that exhibits\nseveral desirable characteristics: a) new routes can be traversed without\nstrictly requiring to imitate prior experience, b) the control prediction\nproblem can be decoupled from solving the image matching problem, and c) high\ninvariance can be achieved in cross-embodiment deployment for variations across\nboth training-testing and mapping-execution settings. We propose a topometric\nmap representation in the form of a \"relative\" 3D scene graph, which is used to\nobtain more informative object-level global path planning costs. We train a\nlocal controller, dubbed \"ObjectReact\", conditioned directly on a high-level\n\"WayObject Costmap\" representation that eliminates the need for an explicit RGB\ninput. We demonstrate the advantages of learning object-relative control over\nits image-relative counterpart across sensor height variations and multiple\nnavigation tasks that challenge the underlying spatial understanding\ncapability, e.g., navigating a map trajectory in the reverse direction. We\nfurther show that our sim-only policy is able to generalize well to real-world\nindoor environments.

However, its non-Hermitian counterpart remains\nlargely unexplored. In this Letter, we show how parity-time (PT) symmetry\nenriches non-Hermitian critical points, giving rise to a topologically distinct\nnon-unitary universality class. By analytically investigating non-Hermitian\nfree fermion models with $PT$ symmetry, we uncover a new class of conformally\ninvariant non-unitary critical points that host robust topological edge modes.\nRemarkably, the associated topological degeneracy is surprisingly encoded in\nthe purely imaginary part of the entanglement entropy scaling-a feature absent\nin Hermitian systems. The underlying mechanism for the emergence of edge states\nat non-Hermitian criticality is traced to a generalized mass inversion that is\nabsent in Hermitian systems.",

    "abstract": "Classical portfolio models collapse under structural breaks, while modern\nmachine-learning allocators adapt flexibly but often at the cost of\ntransparency and interpretability. This paper introduces Causal PDE-Control\nModels (CPCMs), a unifying framework that integrates causal inference,\nnonlinear filtering, and forward-backward partial differential equations for\ndynamic portfolio optimization. The framework delivers three theoretical\nadvances: (i) the existence of conditional risk-neutral measures under evolving\ninformation sets; (ii) a projection-divergence duality that quantifies the\nstability cost of departing from the causal driver manifold; and (iii) causal\ncompleteness, establishing that a finite driver span can capture all systematic\npremia. Classical methods such as Markowitz, CAPM, and Black-Litterman appear\nas degenerate cases, while reinforcement learning and deep-hedging policies\nemerge as unconstrained, symmetry-breaking approximations. Empirically, CPCM\nsolvers implemented with physics-informed neural networks achieve higher Sharpe\nratios, lower turnover, and more persistent premia than both econometric and\nmachine-learning benchmarks, using a global equity panel with more than 300\ncandidate drivers. By reframing portfolio optimization around structural\ncausality and PDE control, CPCMs provide a rigorous, interpretable, and\ncomputationally tractable foundation for robust asset allocation under\nnonstationary conditions.",

The framework is\ncomplemented by a deliberately lightweight decoder, ensuring the focus remains\non the powerful feature representations from the backbones. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that PeftCD achieves state-of-the-art performance\nacross multiple public datasets, including SYSU-CD (IoU 73.81%), WHUCD\n(92.05%), MSRSCD (64.07%), MLCD (76.89%), CDD (97.01%), S2Looking (52.25%) and\nLEVIR-CD (85.62%), with notably precise boundary delineation and strong\nsuppression of pseudo-changes. In summary, PeftCD presents an optimal balance\nof accuracy, efficiency, and generalization. It offers a powerful and scalable\nparadigm for adapting large-scale VFMs to real-world remote sensing change\ndetection applications. The code and pretrained models will be released at\nhttps://github.com/dyzy41/PeftCD.",

Unlike diamonds, the mechanical\nproperties of Tubulanes are direction-dependent, with significant variations in\nYoung's Modulus (2.3 times). Additionally, the Poisson's ratio is highly\nanisotropic, with at least one direction exhibiting an approximately zero\nvalue. The inherent anisotropy of these materials enables tunable mechanical\nproperties that depend on the direction of applied stress. Regarding their\nelectronic properties, all Tubulane structures studied possess indirect\nelectronic band gaps, dominated by $2p$ orbitals. The band dispersion is\nrelatively high, with band gaps ranging from 0.46 eV to 2.74 eV, all of which\nare smaller than that of diamond. Notably, the 16-tetra-22 structure exhibits\nthe smallest bandgap (0.46 eV), making it particularly interesting for\nelectronic applications. Additionally, these structures exhibit porosity, which\nprovides an advantage over denser materials, such as diamond. Considering the\nrecent advances in the synthesis of 3D carbon-based materials, the synthesis of\ntubulane-like structures is within our present-day technological capabilities.",

This setting is\nparticularly relevant when some agents exhibit extreme or atypical preferences.\nAs a natural case study, we consider facility location on the line: $n$\nstrategic agents report their preferred locations, and a mechanism places a\nfacility to minimize a social cost function. In our setting, the $z$ agents\nfarthest from the chosen facility are excluded from the social cost. While it\nmay seem intuitive that discarding outliers improves efficiency, our results\nreveal that the opposite can hold.\n  We derive tight bounds for deterministic strategyproof mechanisms under the\ntwo most-studied objectives: utilitarian and egalitarian social cost. Our\nresults offer a comprehensive view of the impact of outliers. We first show\nthat when $z \\ge n/2$, no strategyproof mechanism can achieve a bounded\napproximation for either objective. For egalitarian cost, selecting the $(z +\n1)$-th order statistic is strategyproof and 2-approximate. In fact, we show\nthat this is best possible by providing a matching lower bound. Notably, this\nlower bound of 2 persists even when the mechanism has access to a prediction of\nthe optimal location, in stark contrast to the setting without outliers. For\nutilitarian cost, we show that strategyproof mechanisms cannot effectively\nexploit outliers, leading to the counterintuitive outcome that approximation\nguarantees worsen as the number of outliers increases.

We also consider the\nelectric field self-correlations, i.e. on the same moving point but at\ndifferent frequencies, and comment the results related to special relativity.\nThen, we compute the exact main symmetrized quadratic electromagnetic field\ncorrelations between two points diametrically opposed on the same circular\ntrajectory, with diameter r, covered at constant angular velocity {\\Omega}. We\nderive the expressions for the electromagnetic field correlations with itself\nand with its spatial derivatives, still at the locations of the moving points.\nSince the points we consider are accelerating, both the zero-point fluctuations\nand the blackbody spectrum give non-trivial results, for two-point correlations\nas well as for self-correlations. In both cases, results are shown at any\nvacuum temperature. For practical uses, we provide the first-order\napproximations in the small parameter {\\Omega}r/c with c being the speed of\nlight.",

The pressure field is modeled using an\nadapted Holland-type formulation, with azimuthally varying parameters estimated\nthrough Kriging surrogate models informed by sensitivity analysis of reanalysis\ndata. The wind field is then derived analytically from the momentum equations\nby decomposing the wind flow into gradient and frictional components. Model\nperformance is assessed against ERA-Interim reanalysis data and surface wind\nobservations from a historical event. Results show that the proposed pressure\nmodel accurately reproduces elliptical isobars and key asymmetrical patterns,\nwhile the wind model captures the fundamental structure and intensity of the\nboundary layer flow, including the presence of supergradient winds. Owing to\nits physical basis, computational efficiency, and ability to represent critical\nstorm asymmetries, the model offers a valuable alternative to computationally\nexpensive numerical simulations for hazard assessment and scenario analysis of\nextreme Nor'easters.",

Nonetheless, ECO faces constraints due\nto an imbalance between exploitation and exploration, rendering it susceptible\nto local optima and demonstrating restricted effectiveness in addressing\ncomplex optimization problems. To address these limitations, this study\npresents an enhanced educational competition optimizer (IECO-MCO) utilizing\nmulti-covariance learning operators. In IECO, three distinct covariance\nlearning operators are introduced to improve the performance of ECO. Each\noperator effectively balances exploitation and exploration while preventing\npremature convergence of the population. The effectiveness of IECO is assessed\nthrough benchmark functions derived from the CEC 2017 and CEC 2022 test suites,\nand its performance is compared with various basic and improved algorithms\nacross different categories. The results demonstrate that IECO-MCO surpasses\nthe basic ECO and other competing algorithms in convergence speed, stability,\nand the capability to avoid local optima. Furthermore, statistical analyses,\nincluding the Friedman test, Kruskal-Wallis test, and Wilcoxon rank-sum test,\nare conducted to validate the superiority of IECO-MCO over the compared\nalgorithms. Compared with the basic algorithm (improved algorithm), IECO-MCO\nachieved an average ranking of 2.213 (2.488) on the CE2017 and CEC2022 test\nsuites.

    "abstract": "In the traditional Monte Carlo Glauber modeling of relativistic collisions\ninvolving deformed nuclei, the nuclear shape is interpreted classically; that\nis, each nucleus in an event is described by a configuration with fixed\ndeformation parameters and orientation (collective coordinates). However,\nquantum mechanically, a valid ground state must be a superposition, at the\namplitude level, of these deformed configurations to preserve rotational and\nother symmetries. This leads to significant entanglement in the nucleon wave\nfunction. For collisions with a moderate number of participants, we show that\naccounting for this quantum superposition -- particularly in the orientation of\ndeformed nuclei -- can substantially alter the geometric shape of the\nquark-gluon plasma fireball at the early stage of the collision. By modifying\nthe Monte Carlo Glauber model to approximately incorporate these quantum\nsuperposition effects, we find that the second-order eccentricity in Ne-Ne\ncollisions is reduced by approximately $6\\%$ compared to classical treatments\nof nuclear orientation. Even larger impacts are expected for Ne-Pb collisions\nand for symmetric cumulant observables.

    "abstract": "We present a comprehensive investigation of the influence of Ru concentration\non the lattice parameters, atomic magnetic moments, electronic structure, and\nmagnetic anisotropy energy of the full Heusler L2$_1$-type Mn$_2$Ru$_{1-x_p}$Ga\nalloy, where x$_p$ = 0.0834 p with p=0,...,12. This study combines\nfirst-principles calculations with data-driven techniques from artificial\nintelligence, specifically principal component analysis (PCA), to reveal trends\nand correlations across multiple structural, magnetic, and electronic\ndescriptors. For each composition, a set of inequivalent atomic configurations\nwas fully optimized. Structurally, the relaxed lattices exhibit anisotropic\nexpansion, with a pronounced elongation of the out-of-plane lattice parameter\n($c$) relative to the in-plane lattice vectors, which promotes the development\nof perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. Our results reveal that an out-of-plane\neasy axis emerges at intermediate Ru concentrations (25-28%), while low and\nhigh Ru levels favor an in-plane orientation or even vanishing anisotropy. The\nhalf-metallic character is also modulated by Ru content, appearing selectively\nat both ends of the composition range. Additionally, the ferrimagnetic coupling\nbetween Mn(4a) and Mn(4c) sublattices leads to nearly compensated magnetic\nmoments below 50% Ru content, with a net moment close to zero around 30%. These\nfindings open a pathway toward the design of tunable spintronic materials with\nco-optimized perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and half-metallicity, making\nMn$_2$RuGa a promising candidate for magnetic tunnel junctions,\nmagnetoresistive random-access memory (MRAM) devices, and high-density magnetic\nstorage applications.",

    "abstract": "In general, metal layers cannot be grown epitaxially on Si due to the\ntendency of metals to react and form a silicide. Even in case the metal layer\nhas a matching lattice symmetry and atomic distance, the Si/metal interface is\ndisturbed by the silicide thus preventing epitaxial growth. One exception is\nNiAl which is known to grow epitaxially when deposited on Si(001). During the\ngrowth, NiAl reacts with Si to form NiSi$_2$. In this work, epitaxial NiAl is\ngrown and significant silicidation is observed in accordance with previous\nreports. However, the role that this silicide plays as a template for the\nepitaxial growth of NiAl has not been clear to this date. We hypothesize that\nNiSi$_2$ acts as a necessary seed layer between the Si substrate and the NiAl\nlayer. Additionally, NiSi$_2$ can be used as a seed layer for the epitaxial\ngrowth of other metals besides NiAl. This was tested by growing NiSi$_2$\nseperately and replacing the NiAl layer with Cr. Growing Cr directly on Si(001)\nproduced a polycrystalline layer. When NiSi$_2$ was used as a seed layer, the\nCr layer was found to be a single crystal with Si(001)//Cr(001) and\nSi(100)//Cr(100). NiSi was also tried as seed layer for Cr and was found to\nproduce a polycrystalline Cr layer. Using NiSi$_2$ as a seed layer could enable\nthe growth of various epitaxial materials for industrial semiconductor\napplications.",

The RIME algorithm is a recently proposed physical-based\nmetaheuristic algorithm with certain advantages. However, it suffers from rapid\nloss of population diversity during optimization and is prone to fall into\nlocal optima, leading to unbalanced exploitation and exploration. To address\nthe shortcomings of RIME, this paper proposes a modified RIME with covariance\nlearning and diversity enhancement (MRIME-CD). The algorithm applies three\nstrategies to improve the optimization capability. First, a covariance learning\nstrategy is introduced in the soft-rime search stage to increase the population\ndiversity and balance the over-exploitation ability of RIME through the\nbootstrapping effect of dominant populations. Second, in order to moderate the\ntendency of RIME population to approach the optimal individual in the early\nsearch stage, an average bootstrapping strategy is introduced into the\nhard-rime puncture mechanism, which guides the population search through the\nweighted position of the dominant populations, thus enhancing the global search\nability of RIME in the early stage. Finally, a new stagnation indicator is\nproposed, and a stochastic covariance learning strategy is used to update the\nstagnant individuals in the population when the algorithm gets stagnant, thus\nenhancing the ability to jump out of the local optimal solution. The proposed\nMRIME-CD algorithm is subjected to a series of validations on the CEC2017 test\nset, the CEC2022 test set, and the experimental results are analyzed using the\nFriedman test, the Wilcoxon rank sum test, and the Kruskal Wallis test. The\nresults show that MRIME-CD can effectively improve the performance of basic\nRIME and has obvious superiorities in terms of solution accuracy, convergence\nspeed and stability.",

We introduce a self-supervised hybrid architecture that combines\ndense sentence embeddings with domain-specific Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to\nimprove both semantic alignment and explainability.

We present a machine learning pipeline\nfor WEPL from high dimensional radiographs. Data were generated with the TOPAS\nMonte Carlo toolkit, modeling a clinical nozzle and a patient CT. Proton\nenergies spanned 70-230 MeV across 72 projection angles. Principal component\nanalysis reduced input dimensionality while preserving signal. A conditional\nGAN with gradient penalty was trained for WEPL prediction using a composite\nloss (adversarial, MSE, SSIM, perceptual) to balance sharpness, accuracy, and\nstability. Main results.

While several influential datasets have\ndriven progress in these domains, they often suffer from limitations in sensing\nmodalities, environmental diversity, and the reproducibility of the underlying\nhardware setups. To address these challenges, this paper introduces SMapper, a\nnovel open-hardware, multi-sensor platform designed explicitly for, though not\nlimited to, SLAM research. The device integrates synchronized LiDAR,\nmulti-camera, and inertial sensing, supported by a robust calibration and\nsynchronization pipeline that ensures precise spatio-temporal alignment across\nmodalities. Its open and replicable design allows researchers to extend its\ncapabilities and reproduce experiments across both handheld and robot-mounted\nscenarios. To demonstrate its practicality, we additionally release\nSMapper-light, a publicly available SLAM dataset containing representative\nindoor and outdoor sequences. The dataset includes tightly synchronized\nmultimodal data and ground-truth trajectories derived from offline LiDAR-based\nSLAM with sub-centimeter accuracy, alongside dense 3D reconstructions.\nFurthermore, the paper contains benchmarking results on state-of-the-art LiDAR\nand visual SLAM frameworks using the SMapper-light dataset.

    "abstract": "The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into telecommunications\ninfrastructure introduces novel risks, such as algorithmic bias and\nunpredictable system behavior, that fall outside the scope of traditional\ncybersecurity and data protection frameworks. This paper introduces a precise\ndefinition and a detailed typology of telecommunications AI incidents,\nestablishing them as a distinct category of risk that extends beyond\nconventional cybersecurity and data protection breaches. It argues for their\nrecognition as a distinct regulatory concern. Using India as a case study for\njurisdictions that lack a horizontal AI law, the paper analyzes the country's\nkey digital regulations. The analysis reveals that India's existing legal\ninstruments, including the Telecommunications Act, 2023, the CERT-In Rules, and\nthe Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, focus on cybersecurity and data\nbreaches, creating a significant regulatory gap for AI-specific operational\nincidents, such as performance degradation and algorithmic bias. The paper also\nexamines structural barriers to disclosure and the limitations of existing AI\nincident repositories. Based on these findings, the paper proposes targeted\npolicy recommendations centered on integrating AI incident reporting into\nIndia's existing telecom governance. Key proposals include mandating reporting\nfor high-risk AI failures, designating an existing government body as a nodal\nagency to manage incident data, and developing standardized reporting\nframeworks. These recommendations aim to enhance regulatory clarity and\nstrengthen long-term resilience, offering a pragmatic and replicable blueprint\nfor other nations seeking to govern AI risks within their existing sectoral\nframeworks.",

Yet,\nintriguing special cases exist in which the output wavefront is \"frozen\"\n(agnostic to the input wavefront). This happens when special structure in the\ncomplex medium collapses the rank of its transmission matrix to unity. Here, we\nunveil that an analogous phenomenon exists more universally for differential\nscattering (including reflection) in reconfigurable complex media.\nSpecifically, for a localized perturbation, the differential scattering matrix\nof any complex medium has rank one. One consequence is that the differential\noutput signal is perfectly coherent irrespective of the input wavefront's\ncoherence. Moreover, the thermal noise emitted into the frozen differential\noutput mode has a particular structure that can be exploited for thermal noise\nmanagement. We experimentally evidence frozen differential scattering in a\nrich-scattering wireless link parametrized by a programmable meta-atom. Then,\nwe demonstrate \"customized freezing\" by optimizing the configuration of\nadditional programmable meta-atoms that parametrize the wireless link, as\nenvisioned for 6G networks. We impose particular shapes of the frozen\ndifferential output mode, and maximize its signal-to-thermal-noise ratio.\nPotential applications include filtering and stabilization of differential\nwavefronts, as well as imaging, sensing, and communication in complex media.",

These\nagentic LLM inference tasks are fundamentally different from chatbot-focused\ninference -- they often have much larger context lengths to capture complex,\nprolonged inputs, such as entire webpage DOMs or complicated tool call\ntrajectories. This, in turn, generates significant off-chip memory traffic for\nthe underlying hardware at the inference stage and causes the workload to be\nconstrained by two memory walls, namely the bandwidth and capacity memory\nwalls, preventing the on-chip compute units from achieving high utilization.\n  In this paper, we introduce PLENA, a hardware-software co-designed system\nthat applies three core optimization pathways to tackle these challenges. PLENA\nincludes an efficient hardware implementation of compute and memory units\nsupporting an asymmetric quantization scheme. PLENA also features a novel\nflattened systolic array architecture that has native support for\nFlashAttention to tackle these memory walls in the scenario of inference\nserving for long-context LLMs. Additionally, PLENA is developed with a complete\nstack, including a custom ISA, a compiler, a cycle-emulated simulator, and an\nautomated design space exploration flow. The simulated results show that PLENA\nachieves up to 8.5x higher utilization than existing accelerators, and delivers\n2.24x higher throughput than the A100 GPU and 3.85x higher throughput than the\nTPU v6e, under the same multiplier count and memory settings.

    "abstract": "Many studies decompose human motion into local motion in a frame attached to\nthe root joint and global motion of the root joint in the world frame, treating\nthem separately. However, these two components are not independent. Global\nmovement arises from interactions with the environment, which are, in turn,\ndriven by changes in the body configuration. Motion models often fail to\nprecisely capture this physical coupling between local and global dynamics,\nwhile deriving global trajectories from joint torques and external forces is\ncomputationally expensive and complex. To address these challenges, we propose\nusing whole-body linear and angular momentum as a constraint to link local\nmotion with global movement. Since momentum reflects the aggregate effect of\njoint-level dynamics on the body's movement through space, it provides a\nphysically grounded way to relate local joint behavior to global displacement.\nBuilding on this insight, we introduce a new loss term that enforces\nconsistency between the generated momentum profiles and those observed in\nground-truth data. Incorporating our loss reduces foot sliding and jitter,\nimproves balance, and preserves the accuracy of the recovered motion.

    "abstract": "In-loop filtering (ILF) is a key technology in video coding standards to\nreduce artifacts and enhance visual quality. Recently, neural network-based ILF\nschemes have achieved remarkable coding gains, emerging as a powerful candidate\nfor next-generation video coding standards. However, the use of deep neural\nnetworks (DNN) brings significant computational and time complexity or high\ndemands for dedicated hardware, making it challenging for general use. To\naddress this limitation, we study a practical ILF solution by adopting look-up\ntables (LUTs). After training a DNN with a restricted reference range for ILF,\nall possible inputs are traversed, and the output values of the DNN are cached\ninto LUTs. During the coding process, the filtering process is performed by\nsimply retrieving the filtered pixel through locating the input pixels and\ninterpolating between the cached values, instead of relying on heavy inference\ncomputations. In this paper, we propose a universal LUT-based ILF framework,\ntermed LUT-ILF++. First, we introduce the cooperation of multiple kinds of\nfiltering LUTs and propose a series of customized indexing mechanisms to enable\nbetter filtering reference perception with limited storage consumption. Second,\nwe propose the cross-component indexing mechanism to enable the filtering of\ndifferent color components jointly. Third, in order to make our solution\npractical for coding uses, we propose the LUT compaction scheme to enable the\nLUT pruning, achieving a lower storage cost of the entire solution. The\nproposed framework is implemented in the VVC reference software. Experimental\nresults show that the proposed framework achieves on average 0.82%/2.97%/1.63%\nand 0.85%/4.11%/2.06% bitrate reduction for common test sequences, under the AI\nand RA configurations, respectively. Compared to DNN-based solutions, our\nproposed solution has much lower time complexity and storage cost.",

Observations of such transients are valuable for\nunderstanding and testing models of mass transfer. For donor stars in the\nHertzsprung gap, there can be a long phase of mass-transfer evolution before\ninstability sets in. Only few case studies of such delayed dynamical\ninstability (DDI) mass transfer exist. None consider the full pre-instability\nevolution and the effects thereof on the observable properties of a binary. We\nsystematically analyse detailed models of stable and unstable mass transfer for\nHertzsprung-gap donors. We focus on identifying observable evolutionary\nfeatures characteristic of ultimately unstable mass transfer and not found in\nstable mass-transfer binaries. Our binary evolution models, calculated with the\nMESA code, cover initial donor masses between $2.5 M_{\\odot}$ and $10\nM_{\\odot}$ and initial accretor-to-donor mass ratios between $0.1$ and $1$. We\nfind that the pre-instability evolution is qualitatively the same for all DDI\ndonor stars, consisting of a long slow dimming phase followed by a shorter\nphase of rapid brightening. The latter phase is powered by recombination of\nhydrogen and accompanied by a strong increase in effective temperature, unique\nto unstable mass-transfer binaries. We estimate that a significant fraction of\nthe rapid brighteners should be detectable by Gaia throughout the Galaxy. We\nmodel the progenitors of LRNe M31-2015 and V838 Mon, find a higher initial\ndonor mass for M31 2015 than past estimates, and propose a new scenario for\nV838 Mon in which the known tertiary star dominates the pre-outburst photometry\nand the outburst results from the DDI of a more massive primary star.

The initial\nvorticity packing fraction and circulation direction lead to qualitatively\ndistinct turbulence dynamics and transport behaviors.

    "abstract": "We investigate the relationship between quasars and close companion galaxies\nusing photometry and spectroscopy from the large data set of the SDSS DR16\nsurvey. From the SDSS-QSO catalog of quasars, we selected objects with 0.1 < z\n< 0.35 and absolute magnitude M(r) <-21.3. For all these targets, we searched\nfor candidate companion galaxies that have a projected distance from the target\n< 700 kpc and a radial velocity difference from the QSO DeltaV < 1000 km/sec.\nWe find that in 447 QSO at least one companion galaxy is associated. A total of\n691 associated galaxies are found in these QSO fields. In the majority of them\nthere is just one associated galaxy but in few cases, many companions are also\ndiscovered and in two cases the QSO is found in rich galaxy environments. The\npossible contamination due to a chance projection of the companion galaxies is\nfound less than 5%. Based on the available data we expect on average to find\n\\sim2 associated companion galaxies for each QSO. A small fraction (13%) of the\ncompanion galaxies exhibits [OII] emission lines as signature of recent star\nformation. However a similar fraction (16%) of unassociated galaxies in the\nsame QSO fields show [OII] emission. This study suggests that there is no\nsignificant link between the presence of these close companion galaxies or the\nsignature of recent star formation and the QSO nuclear activity.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, there has been significant progress in the development of\ndeep learning models over relational databases, including architectures based\non heterogeneous graph neural networks (hetero-GNNs) and heterogeneous graph\ntransformers. In effect, such architectures state how the database records and\nlinks (e.g., foreign-key references) translate into a large, complex numerical\nexpression, involving numerous learnable parameters. This complexity makes it\nhard to explain, in human-understandable terms, how a model uses the available\ndata to arrive at a given prediction. We present a novel framework for\nexplaining machine-learning models over relational databases, where\nexplanations are view definitions that highlight focused parts of the database\nthat mostly contribute to the model's prediction. We establish such global\nabductive explanations by adapting the classic notion of determinacy by Nash,\nSegoufin, and Vianu (2010). In addition to tuning the tradeoff between\ndeterminacy and conciseness, the framework allows controlling the level of\ngranularity by adopting different fragments of view definitions, such as ones\nhighlighting whole columns, foreign keys between tables, relevant groups of\ntuples, and so on. We investigate the realization of the framework in the case\nof hetero-GNNs. We develop heuristic algorithms that avoid the exhaustive\nsearch over the space of all databases. We propose techniques that are\nmodel-agnostic, and others that are tailored to hetero-GNNs via the notion of\nlearnable masking. Our approach is evaluated through an extensive empirical\nstudy on the RelBench collection, covering a variety of domains and different\nrecord-level tasks. The results demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed\nexplanations, as well as the efficiency of their generation.",

While a promising diagrammatic\napproach has recently been introduced for isolated systems, the resulting\nnonlinear response functions remain unstable at long times, a characteristic\nfeature of integrable classical systems. Here, we extend this framework to\nincorporate system-bath interactions under the weak-anharmonicity approximation\nand explore the resulting conditions for bath-induced stabilization. The\nresulting expression for the weakly anharmonic response function is remarkably\nsimple and exhibits a one-to-one correspondence with the quantum counterpart in\nthe $\\hbar\\to 0$ limit, offering potential computational advantages in\nextending the approach to large, multi-oscillator systems. We find that (to\nlowest order in anharmonicity) the bath-induced stabilization of both linear\nand nonlinear classical response functions depends sensitively on the nature of\nspectral density, particularly on the balance between low-frequency and\nhigh-frequency components. Application of this classical diagrammatic approach\nto 2D IR spectroscopy of the amide I band captures the characteristic\npopulation-time-dependent dynamics associated with spectral diffusion,\nsuggesting that the approach may prove useful in describing real experimental\nsystems at ambient temperatures.",

In this paper, a gap-resolved\napproach is developed by directly modeling the transverse gap flow and the\ncontact angle dynamics, which overcomes the aforementioned limitations,\nultimately yielding a modified damping with respect to the static contact angle\nand hysteresis range. A novel amplitude equation for Faraday waves is derived\nthat combines this damping and the gap-averaged counterpart based on the\noscillatory Stokes boundary layer, with the viscous dissipation preserved. By\nmeans of Lyapunov's first method, an explicit analytical expression for the\ncritical stability boundary is established. Two series of laboratory\nexperiments are performed that focus, respectively, on evolutions of the\nlateral meniscus and the longitudinal free surface near the Faraday onset, from\nwhich key parameters relevant to the theory are precisely measured. Based on\nthe experimental data, the validity of the proposed mathematical model for\naddressing the Faraday instability problem in Hele-Shaw cells is confirmed, and\nthe generation and development mechanisms of the onset are clarified.

    "abstract": "Thermal conditions in the urban canopy exhibit stochastic variability driven\nby varied radiative fluxes and turbulent wind fields, requiring probabilistic\nrather than deterministic prediction methods. This study presents a\nprobabilistic framework for predicting the spatial and temporal intensity and\nvariability of outdoor thermal comfort in tropical urban environments. The\nframework integrates ground-measured meteorological data and remote sensing\nurban morphological data to calculate Physiological Equivalent Temperature\n(PET), and applies K-means, XGBoost, and Monte Carlo simulations on PET\ntraining and inference. The prediction model achieved strong performance, with\nR2, RMSE, and SMAPE values of 0.93, 0.81 degC, and 1.34% for PET_mean, and\n0.85, 0.38 degC, and 10.44% for PET_std, respectively. A case study showed\nclear spatial heterogeneity of outdoor thermal comfort. Locations with dense\ntree canopies and vegetated surfaces displayed a normalized percentage of\nacceptable thermal comfort (NATC) up to 65%, whereas built-up zones dominated\nby impervious surfaces, such as industrial estates and high-density residential\nareas, recorded NATC below 30%. Greenery was found to mitigate both the\nintensity of heat stress and its variability, producing a stable and\ncomfortable microclimate. Daytime PET_std ranged from 4.0-4.5 degC in built-up\nareas to 1.5-2.0 degC in greenery-covered zones, while nighttime PET_std\ndecreased to 2.2-2.4 degC and 1.2-1.4 degC, respectively. These findings\nemphasize the critical role of greenery in mitigating thermal variability and\nenhancing outdoor thermal comfort, while revealing the stochastic nature of\nthermal comfort across different urban morphologies.",

    "abstract": "We consider a discrete-time dynamical system in a car-following context. The\nsystem was recently introduced to parsimoniously model human driving behavior\nbased on utility maximization. The parameters of the model were calibrated\nusing vehicle trajectory data from the Sugiyama experiment. It was shown that\nsuch a system can accurately reproduce the observed collective phenomena of a\nmore elaborate experiment by Tadaki et al. Once the heterogeneity and noise are\nswitched off, the model defines a map of the corresponding discrete-time\ndynamical system. We first perform a bifurcation analysis of the map by\nstudying the stability of its limit solutions: a free-flow fixed point and a\nstop-and-go quasi-periodic orbit. When the vehicle density is varied, our model\ndisplays a bifurcation diagram qualitatively similar to those found in a class\nof optimal velocity models based on an ordinary differential equation approach,\nincluding regimes where one or both of the limit solutions are stable. In a 2D\nbifurcation diagram we further demonstrate that imposing a vehicle\ndensity-dependent speed advisory can dissipate the stop-and-go quasi-periodic\norbit. This in turn lays the mathematical foundation for a simple, yet\neffective proposal [1] to tame stop-and-go waves, improving traffic flow and\nsmoothness simultaneously via variable speed advisory.",

Multi-modal medical image fusion\nintegrates useful information from different complementary medical images with\ndifferent modalities, producing a fused image that comprehensively and\nobjectively reflects lesion characteristics to assist doctors in clinical\ndiagnosis. However, existing fusion methods can only handle a fixed number of\nmodality inputs, such as accepting only two-modal or tri-modal inputs, and\ncannot directly process varying input quantities, which hinders their\napplication in clinical settings. To tackle this issue, we introduce\nFlexiD-Fuse, a diffusion-based image fusion network designed to accommodate\nflexible quantities of input modalities. It can end-to-end process two-modal\nand tri-modal medical image fusion under the same weight. FlexiD-Fuse\ntransforms the diffusion fusion problem, which supports only fixed-condition\ninputs, into a maximum likelihood estimation problem based on the diffusion\nprocess and hierarchical Bayesian modeling. By incorporating the\nExpectation-Maximization algorithm into the diffusion sampling iteration\nprocess, FlexiD-Fuse can generate high-quality fused images with cross-modal\ninformation from source images, independently of the number of input images. We\ncompared the latest two and tri-modal medical image fusion methods, tested them\non Harvard datasets, and evaluated them using nine popular metrics.

    "abstract": "With the advent of quantum computing, the increasing threats to security\nposes a great challenge to communication networks. Recent innovations in this\nfield resulted in promising technologies such as Quantum Key Distribution\n(QKD), which enables the generation of unconditionally secure keys,\nestablishing secure communications between remote nodes. Additionally, QKD\nnetworks enable the interconnection of multinode architectures, extending the\npoint-to-point nature of QKD. However, due to the limitations of the current\nstate of technology, the scalability of QKD networks remains a challenge toward\nfeasible implementations. When it comes to long-distance implementations,\ntrusted relay nodes partially solve the distance issue through the forwarding\nof the distributed keys, allowing applications that do not have a direct QKD\nlink to securely share key material. Even though the relay procedure itself has\nbeen extensively studied, the establishment of the relaying node path still\nlacks a solution. This paper proposes an innovative network architecture that\nsolves the challenges of Key Management System (KMS) identification, relay path\ndiscovery, and scalability of QKD networks by integrating Software-Defined\nNetworking (SDN) principles, and establishing high-level virtual KMSs (vKMS) in\neach node and creating a new entity called the Quantum Security Controller\n(QuSeC). The vKMS serves the end-user key requests, managing the multiple KMSs\nwithin the node and abstracting the user from discovering the correct KMS.\nAdditionally, based on the high-level view of the network topology and status,\nthe QuSeC serves the path discovery requests from vKMSs, computing the\nend-to-end (E2E) relay path and applying security policies. The paper also\nprovides a security analysis of the proposal, identifying the security levels\nof the architecture and analyzing the core networking security properties.",

To\nsolve this problem efficiently, we construct multiply-connected conformal maps\nunder which both the domain and governing equation are greatly simplified. In\nparticular, each obstacle is mapped to a horizontal slit and the governing\nequation becomes a constant-coefficient elliptic PDE. We then develop a\nboundary integral approach in the mapped domain to solve for the temperature\nfield when arbitrary Dirichlet temperature data is specified on the obstacles.\nThe inverse conformal map is then used to compute the temperature field in the\nphysical domain. We construct our multiply-connected conformal maps by\nexploiting the flexible and highly accurate AAA-LS algorithm.

Indeed, the semantics of the primitive used to\ncreate POSIX processes, fork, are inextricably tied to the existence of\nmultiple address spaces.\n  Prior approaches addressing this issue trade off lightweightness,\ncompatibility and/or isolation. We propose {\\mu}Fork, a single-address-space\noperating system design supporting POSIX fork on modern hardware without\ncompromising on any of these key objectives. {\\mu}Fork emulates POSIX processes\n({\\mu}processes) and achieves fork by creating for the child a copy of the\nparent {\\mu}process' memory at a different location within a single address\nspace. This approach presents two challenges: relocating the child's absolute\nmemory references (pointers), as well as providing user/kernel and\n{\\mu}processes isolation without impacting lightweightness. We address them\nusing CHERI. We implement {\\mu}Fork and evaluate it upon three real-world\nuse-cases: Redis snapshots, Nginx multi-worker deployments, and Zygote FaaS\nworker warm-up. {\\mu}Fork outperforms previous work and traditional monolithic\nOSes on key lightweightness metrics by an order of magnitude, e.g. it can offer\na fork-bound FaaS function throughput 24% higher than that of a monolithic OS,\nand can fork a {\\mu}process in 54{\\mu}s, 3.7x faster than a traditional fork.",

Existing methods either require expensive\ncomputational overhead or suffer from poor calibration, making them impractical\nand unreliable for real-world deployment. In this work, we propose GrACE, a\nGenerative Approach to Confidence Elicitation that enables scalable and\nreliable confidence elicitation for LLMs. GrACE adopts a novel mechanism in\nwhich the model expresses confidence by the similarity between the last hidden\nstate and the embedding of a special token appended to the vocabulary, in\nreal-time. We fine-tune the model for calibrating the confidence with\ncalibration targets associated with accuracy. Experiments with three LLMs and\ntwo benchmark datasets show that the confidence produced by GrACE achieves the\nbest discriminative capacity and calibration on open-ended generation tasks,\noutperforming six competing methods without resorting to additional sampling or\nan auxiliary model. Moreover, we propose two strategies for improving test-time\nscaling based on confidence induced by GrACE. Experimental results show that\nusing GrACE not only improves the accuracy of the final decision but also\nsignificantly reduces the number of required samples in the test-time scaling\nscheme, indicating the potential of GrACE as a practical solution for deploying\nLLMs with scalable, reliable, and real-time confidence estimation.",

    "abstract": "Collaborative mobile edge computing (MEC) has emerged as a promising paradigm\nto enable low-capability edge nodes to cooperatively execute\ncomputation-intensive tasks. However, straggling edge nodes (stragglers)\nsignificantly degrade the performance of MEC systems by prolonging computation\nlatency. While coded distributed computing (CDC) as an effective technique is\nwidely adopted to mitigate straggler effects, existing CDC schemes exhibit two\ncritical limitations: (i) They cannot successfully decode the final result\nunless the number of received results reaches a fixed recovery threshold, which\nseriously restricts their flexibility; (ii) They suffer from inherent poles in\ntheir encoding/decoding functions, leading to decoding inaccuracies and\nnumerical instability in the computational results. To address these\nlimitations, this paper proposes an approximated CDC scheme based on\nbarycentric rational interpolation. The proposed CDC scheme offers several\noutstanding advantages. Firstly, it can decode the final result leveraging any\nreturned results from workers. Secondly, it supports computations over both\nfinite and real fields while ensuring numerical stability. Thirdly, its\nencoding/decoding functions are free of poles, which not only enhances\napproximation accuracy but also achieves flexible accuracy tuning. Fourthly, it\nintegrates a novel BRI-based gradient coding algorithm accelerating the\ntraining process while providing robustness against stragglers. Finally,\nexperimental results reveal that the proposed scheme is superior to existing\nCDC schemes in both waiting time and approximate accuracy.",

Mainstream methods encounter an over-dispersion phenomenon that\npatches from the same instance/category scatter, harming downstream performance\non dense tasks. This work reveals that image-level SSL avoids over-dispersion\nby involving implicit semantic concentration. Specifically, the non-strict\nspatial alignment ensures intra-instance consistency, while shared patterns,\ni.e., similar parts of within-class instances in the input space, ensure\ninter-image consistency. Unfortunately, these approaches are infeasible for\ndense SSL due to their spatial sensitivity and complicated scene-centric data.\nThese observations motivate us to explore explicit semantic concentration for\ndense SSL. First, to break the strict spatial alignment, we propose to distill\nthe patch correspondences. Facing noisy and imbalanced pseudo labels, we\npropose a noise-tolerant ranking loss. The core idea is extending the Average\nPrecision (AP) loss to continuous targets, such that its decision-agnostic and\nadaptive focusing properties prevent the student model from being misled.\nSecond, to discriminate the shared patterns from complicated scenes, we propose\nthe object-aware filter to map the output space to an object-based space.\nSpecifically, patches are represented by learnable prototypes of objects via\ncross-attention.

    "abstract": "Secure inference enables privacy-preserving machine learning by leveraging\ncryptographic protocols that support computations on sensitive user data\nwithout exposing it. However, integrating cryptographic protocols with large\nlanguage models (LLMs) presents significant challenges, as the inherent\ncomplexity of these protocols, together with LLMs' massive parameter scale and\nsophisticated architectures, severely limits practical usability. In this work,\nwe propose ENSI, a novel non-interactive secure inference framework for LLMs,\nbased on the principle of co-designing the cryptographic protocols and LLM\narchitecture. ENSI employs an optimized encoding strategy that seamlessly\nintegrates CKKS scheme with a lightweight LLM variant, BitNet, significantly\nreducing the computational complexity of encrypted matrix multiplications. In\nresponse to the prohibitive computational demands of softmax under homomorphic\nencryption (HE), we pioneer the integration of the sigmoid attention mechanism\nwith HE as a seamless, retraining-free alternative. Furthermore, by embedding\nthe Bootstrapping operation within the RMSNorm process, we efficiently refresh\nciphertexts while markedly decreasing the frequency of costly bootstrapping\ninvocations. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that ENSI achieves\napproximately an 8x acceleration in matrix multiplications and a 2.6x speedup\nin softmax inference on CPU compared to state-of-the-art method, with the\nproportion of bootstrapping is reduced to just 1%.",

A conventional approach to addressing such problems is robust\noptimization, which seeks to enhance design performance by reducing sensitivity\nto uncertainty. Alternatively, reliability-based design focuses on optimizing\nperformance while ensuring that failure constraints are satisfied with a\nspecified probability. While both methods are well established, their\nintegration into multi-objective and multi-stakeholder decision-making\nframeworks remains a challenging problem. In this study, we extend the\nCompromise Decision Support Problem (cDSP) framework to incorporate\nreliability-based design considerations and evaluate its performance in\ncomparison to the conventional robust-based cDSP formulation. The developed\nframework has been validated on a multidisciplinary hot rod rolling process\nincluding parametric and model uncertainties.

First, leveraging\nneutral-atom quantum processing units (QPUs), we introduce a scheme that\nincorporates attributed graphs by embedding edge features into atomic positions\nand node features into local detuning fields of a Rydberg Hamiltonian. We\ndemonstrate both theoretically and empirically that local detuning enhances\nkernel expressiveness. Second, in addition to the existing quantum evolution\nkernel (QEK), which uses global observables, we propose the\ngeneralized-distance quantum-correlation (GDQC) kernel, based on local\nobservables. While the two kernels show comparable performance, we show that\nGDQC can achieve higher expressiveness. Third, instead of restricting to\nobservables at single time steps, we combine information from multiple stages\nof the quantum evolution via pooling operations. Using extensive simulations on\ntwo molecular benchmark datasets, MUTAG and PTC\\_FM, we find: (a) QEK and GDQC\nperform competitively with leading classical algorithms; and (b) pooling\nfurther improves performance, enabling quantum-feature kernels to surpass\nclassical baselines.

Near-Memory Processing\n(NMP) accelerators that stack memory directly on the compute through hybrid\nbonding have demonstrated high bandwidth with high energy efficiency, becoming\na promising architecture for MoE models. However, as NMP accelerators comprise\ndistributed memory and computation, how to map the MoE computation directly\ndetermines the LLM inference efficiency. Existing parallel mapping strategies,\nincluding Tensor Parallelism (TP) and Expert Parallelism (EP), suffer from\neither high communication costs or unbalanced computation utilization, leading\nto inferior efficiency. The dynamic routing mechanism of MoE LLMs further\naggravates the efficiency challenges. Therefore, in this paper, we propose\nHD-MoE to automatically optimize the MoE parallel computation across an NMP\naccelerator. HD-MoE features an offline automatic hybrid parallel mapping\nalgorithm and an online dynamic scheduling strategy to reduce the communication\ncosts while maximizing the computation utilization. With extensive experimental\nresults, we demonstrate that HD-MoE achieves a speedup ranging from 1.1x to\n1.8x over TP, 1.1x to 1.5x over EP, and 1.0x to 1.4x over the baseline Hybrid\nTP-EP with Compute-Balanced parallelism strategies.",

The LMC\noffers a view of the ISM and star formation conditions in a low metallicity\nenvironment similar to, in that regard, the epoch of the peak of star formation\nin the earlier universe.

While prior studies\napproximate this matrix using the channel coefficient correlation matrix from\nJake's model, this work instead employs the channel envelope correlation\nmatrix, motivated by the fact that the multivariate normal RVs are generated by\ntransforming correlated channel envelopes. This raises an open question of\nwhether using the coefficient- or envelope-level correlation matrix yields\nbetter accuracy in accessing FAS performance. Toward this end, this paper\nexplores the benefits of using the envelope-level correlation matrix under\nfully correlated Nakagami-m fading, and develops a method for generating such\nfading channels for Monte Carlo simulations, which serve as a benchmark for\nvalidating the theoretical results. Simulation results confirm the\neffectiveness of the proposed channel modeling approach and demonstrate the\nsuperior accuracy of using the envelope-level correlation matrix, particularly\nin sparse port deployment and low-outage regime.",

Geostatistics leverages\nthe spatial structure of soil properties, while machine learning captures the\nrelationship between available environmental features and soil properties. We\npropose a hybrid framework that enriches ML with spatial context through\nengineering of 'spatial lag' features from ordinary kriging. We call this\napproach 'kriging prior regression' (KpR), as it follows the inverse logic of\nregression kriging. To evaluate this approach, we assessed both the point and\nprobabilistic prediction performance of KpR, using the TabPFN model across six\nfieldscale datasets from LimeSoDa. These datasets included soil organic carbon,\nclay content, and pH, along with features derived from remote sensing and\nin-situ proximal soil sensing. KpR with TabPFN demonstrated reliable\nuncertainty estimates and more accurate predictions in comparison to several\nother spatial techniques (e.g., regression/residual kriging with TabPFN), as\nwell as to established non-spatial machine learning algorithms (e.g., random\nforest). Most notably, it significantly improved the average R2 by around 30%\ncompared to machine learning algorithms without spatial context. This\nimprovement was due to the strong prediction performance of the TabPFN\nalgorithm itself and the complementary spatial information provided by KpR\nfeatures. TabPFN is particularly effective for prediction tasks with small\nsample sizes, common in precision agriculture, whereas KpR can compensate for\nweak relationships between sensing features and soil properties when proximal\nsoil sensing data are limited. Hence, we conclude that KpR with TabPFN is a\nvery robust and versatile modelling framework for digital soil mapping in\nprecision agriculture.",

To address this, we\npropose a fatigue-aware continuum robot with three key innovations: (1) a\nHybrid Hinge-Beam structure where TwistBeam and BendBeam decouple torsion and\nbending: passive revolute joints in the BendBeam mitigate stress concentration,\nwhile TwistBeam's limited torsional deformation reduces BendBeam stress\nmagnitude, enhancing durability; (2) a Passive Stopper that safely constrains\nmotion via mechanical constraints and employs motor torque sensing to detect\ncorresponding limit torque, ensuring safety and enabling data collection; and\n(3) a real-time fatigue-awareness method that estimates stiffness from motor\ntorque at the limit pose, enabling online fatigue estimation without additional\nsensors. Experiments show that the proposed design reduces fatigue accumulation\nby about 49% compared with a conventional design, while passive mechanical\nlimiting combined with motor-side sensing allows accurate estimation of\nstructural fatigue and damage.

For measurements\nalong z-z directions, we find two possible occupation distributions that yield\nan active state and the ergotropic stroke improves the performance of the\nengine over the four-stroke cycle. Further, the three-stroke engine (without\nthe adiabatic strokes) yields the same performance as the five-stroke engine.\nFor arbitrary working medium and non-selective measurements, we prove that the\ntotal work output of a five-stroke engine is equal to the sum of the work\noutputs of the corresponding four-stroke and three-stroke engines. For\nmeasurement directions other than z-z, there may be many possible orderings of\nthe post-measurement probabilities that yield an active state.

We exhibit that the twist angle can be used to\nband engineer a high-order van Hove singularity with power-law exponent~$-1/4$\nin the density of states, which can be accessed by gate tuning of the hole\nfilling. We then study the magnetic phase diagram of an effective Hubbard model\nfor twisted double bilayer tungsten diselenide on the effective moir\\'e\nhoneycomb superlattice with tight-binding parameters fitted to the two topmost\nbands of the continuum model.

We evaluate whether LLMs can produce SCEs that\nare valid, achieving the intended outcome, and minimal, modifying the input no\nmore than necessary.

    "abstract": "We present an implementation of Quantum Computing for a Markov Chain Monte\nCarlo method with an application to cosmological functions, to derive posterior\ndistributions from cosmological probes. The algorithm proposes new steps in the\nparameter space via a quantum circuit whose resulting statevector provides the\ncomponents of the shift vector. The proposed point is accepted or rejected via\nthe classical Metropolis-Hastings acceptance method. The advantage of this\nhybrid quantum approach is that the step size and direction change in a way\nindependent of the evolution of the chain, thus ideally avoiding the presence\nof local minima. The results are consistent with analyses performed with\nclassical methods, both for a test function and real cosmological data. The\nfinal goal is to generalize this algorithm to test its application to complex\ncosmological computations.",

For subject-specific analyses, the anatomy\nand blood flow of the subject can be captured non-invasively using structural\nand 4D Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), on\nthe other hand, can be used to generate blood flow simulations by solving the\nNavier-Stokes equations. To generate and analyze subject-specific blood flow\nsimulations, MRI and CFD have to be brought together.\n  Methods: We present an interactive, customizable, and user-oriented visual\nanalysis tool that assists researchers in both medicine and numerical analysis.\nOur open-source tool is applicable to domains such as CFD and MRI, and it\nfacilitates the analysis of simulation results and medical data, especially in\nhemodynamic studies. It enables the creation of simulation ensembles with a\nhigh variety of parameters. Furthermore, it allows for the visual and\nanalytical examination of simulations and measurements through 2D embeddings of\nthe similarity space.\n  Results: To demonstrate the effectiveness of our tool, we applied it to three\nreal-world use cases, showcasing its ability to configure simulation ensembles\nand analyse blood flow dynamics.

This so-called photoresponse typically\nhas a non-uniform spatial distribution through the active device area, and the\nability to spatially resolve the photoresponse enables an in-depth\nunderstanding of the underlying physical mechanisms. Scanning photocurrent\nmicroscopy (SPCM) is a method that allows the spatial mapping of the\nphotoresponse by raster scanning a focused laser beam over the sample. SPCM is\nbecoming more popular due to its simplicity and power in unraveling fundamental\noptoelectronic processes. In this review, first, we provide the fundamentals of\nSPCM to lay the basics for the subsequent discussions. Then, we focus on the\nliterature that employs SPCM to identify the photoresponse of one- and\ntwo-dimensional materials. We discuss SPCM measurement results of common\nmaterials in detail and introduce a systematic approach to interpreting the\nSPCM measurements. We have given particular emphasis on the photothermal\nmechanisms that are excited by the focused laser beam and critically reviewed\nstudies in the literature from the perspective of laser-induced heating of the\nelectronic and the lattice degrees of freedom. Finally, we discuss the\nshortcomings of SPCM in determining the mechanisms leading to the\nphotoresponse.",

This paper establishes the first simultaneous\napproximation theory for deep neural networks on manifolds. We prove that a\nconstant-depth $\\mathrm{ReLU}^{k-1}$ network with bounded weights--a property\nthat plays a crucial role in controlling generalization error--can approximate\nany function in the Sobolev space $\\mathcal{W}_p^{k}(\\mathcal{M}^d)$ to an\nerror of $\\varepsilon$ in the $\\mathcal{W}_p^{s}(\\mathcal{M}^d)$ norm, for\n$k\\geq 3$ and $s<k$, using $\\mathcal{O}(\\varepsilon^{-d/(k-s)})$ nonzero\nparameters, a rate that overcomes the curse of dimensionality by depending only\non the intrinsic dimension $d$.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in enterprise\napplications, yet their reliability remains limited by hallucinations, i.e.,\nconfident but factually incorrect information. Existing detection approaches,\nsuch as SelfCheckGPT and MetaQA, primarily target standalone LLMs and do not\naddress the unique challenges of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems,\nwhere responses must be consistent with retrieved evidence. We therefore\npresent MetaRAG, a metamorphic testing framework for hallucination detection in\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. MetaRAG operates in a real-time,\nunsupervised, black-box setting, requiring neither ground-truth references nor\naccess to model internals, making it suitable for proprietary and high-stakes\ndomains. The framework proceeds in four stages: (1) decompose answers into\natomic factoids, (2) generate controlled mutations of each factoid using\nsynonym and antonym substitutions, (3) verify each variant against the\nretrieved context (synonyms are expected to be entailed and antonyms\ncontradicted), and (4) aggregate penalties for inconsistencies into a\nresponse-level hallucination score. Crucially for identity-aware AI, MetaRAG\nlocalizes unsupported claims at the factoid span where they occur (e.g.,\npregnancy-specific precautions, LGBTQ+ refugee rights, or labor eligibility),\nallowing users to see flagged spans and enabling system designers to configure\nthresholds and guardrails for identity-sensitive queries. Experiments on a\nproprietary enterprise dataset illustrate the effectiveness of MetaRAG for\ndetecting hallucinations and enabling trustworthy deployment of RAG-based\nconversational agents. We also outline a topic-based deployment design that\ntranslates MetaRAG's span-level scores into identity-aware safeguards; this\ndesign is discussed but not evaluated in our experiments.",

However, traditional RL\napproaches struggle to balance efficient exploration and semantic understanding\ndue to limited cognitive capabilities embedded in the small policies for the\nagents, leading often to human drivers when dealing with semantic exploration.\nIn this paper, we address this challenge by presenting a novel Deep\nReinforcement Learning (DRL) architecture that is specifically designed for\nresource efficient semantic exploration. A key methodological contribution is\nthe integration of a Vision-Language Model (VLM) common-sense through a layered\nreward function. The VLM query is modeled as a dedicated action, allowing the\nagent to strategically query the VLM only when deemed necessary for gaining\nexternal guidance, thereby conserving resources. This mechanism is combined\nwith a curriculum learning strategy designed to guide learning at different\nlevels of complexity to ensure robust and stable learning. Our experimental\nevaluation results convincingly demonstrate that our agent achieves\nsignificantly enhanced object discovery rates and develops a learned capability\nto effectively navigate towards semantically rich regions. Furthermore, it also\nshows a strategic mastery of when to prompt for external environmental\ninformation.

For detection problems -- where the goal is to\ntest a planted distribution $\\mathbb{P}'$ against a null distribution\n$\\mathbb{P}$ with independent components -- the standard approach is to bound\nthe advantage using an $\\mathbb{L}^2(\\mathbb{P})$-orthonormal family of\npolynomials. However, this method breaks down for estimation tasks or more\ncomplex testing problems where $\\mathbb{P}$ has some planted structures, so\nthat no simple $\\mathbb{L}^2(\\mathbb{P})$-orthogonal polynomial family is\navailable. To address this challenge, several technical workarounds have been\nproposed [SW22,SW25], though their implementation can be delicate. In this\nwork, we propose a more direct proof strategy. Focusing on random graph models,\nwe construct a basis of polynomials that is almost orthonormal under\n$\\mathbb{P}$, in precisely those regimes where statistical-computational gaps\narise. This almost orthonormal basis not only yields a direct route to\nestablishing low-degree lower bounds, but also allows us to explicitly identify\nthe polynomials that optimize the low-degree criterion. This, in turn, provides\ninsights into the design of optimal polynomial-time algorithms. We illustrate\nthe effectiveness of our approach by recovering known low-degree lower bounds,\nand establishing new ones for problems such as hidden subcliques, stochastic\nblock models, and seriation models.",

We calculate the\ncorresponding beta functions, identifying a special class of QFTs with UV fixed\npoints at which $\\langle T_{\\mu\\nu}\\rangle$ and all its correlators $\\langle\nT\\ldots T\\rangle$ are UV finite. An intriguing example is a theory like the\nStandard Model (including right-handed neutrinos) with $12$ gauge fields, $3$\ngenerations of $16$ Weyl fermions and $36$ four-derivative (Fradkin-Tseytlin)\nscalars. In the infrared, this theory has a positive Newton's constant $G$ and\nan arbitrarily small cosmological constant $\\Lambda$.",

A key open\nquestion in the emerging field of attochemistry is whether these electron\ndynamics, which due to decoherence often last only for a few femtoseconds, can\ninfluence longer-time scale nuclear rearrangements. Herein, we address this\nquestion through full-dimensional quantum dynamics simulations of the coupled\nelectron-nuclear dynamics initiated by ionization and coherent excitation of\nethylene. The simulations of this prototype organic chromophore predict\nelectronic coherences with half-lives of less than 1 fs. Despite their brevity,\nthese electronic coherences induce vibrational coherences along the derivative\ncoupling vectors that persist for at least 50 fs. These results suggest that\nshort-lived electronic coherences can impart long-lasting legacies on nuclear\nmotion, a finding of potential importance to the interpretation of attosecond\nexperiments and the development of strategies for attochemical control.",

In this context, magnetic skyrmions\nhave been widely considered for in-situ processing devices due to their\nmobility and enhanced lifetime in materials with broken inversion symmetry.\nHowever, modern applications in non-volatile reservoir or neuromorphic\ncomputing raise the additional demand for non-linear inter-soliton\ninteractions. Here we report that solitons in easy-plane magnets, such as\nbimerons and antibimerons, show greater versatility and potential for\nnon-linear interactions than skyrmions and antiskyrmions, making them superior\ncandidates for this class of applications. Using first-principles and\ntransition state theory, we predict the coexistence of degenerate bimerons and\nantibimerons at zero field in a van der Waals heterostructure\nFe$_3$GeTe$_2$/Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ -- an experimentally feasible system. We\ndemonstrate that, owing to their distinct structural symmetry, bimerons exhibit\nfundamentally different behavior from skyrmions and cannot be regarded as their\nin-plane counterparts, as is often assumed. This distinction leads to unique\nproperties of bimerons and antibimerons, which arise from the unbroken\nrotational symmetry in easy-plane magnets. These range from anisotropic\nsoliton-soliton interactions to strong entropic effects on their lifetime,\ndriven by the non-local nature of thermal excitations.

To address this, we\npropose Decoupled Cross-Attention Transfer (D-CAT), a framework that aligns\nmodality-specific representations without requiring joint sensor modality\nduring inference. Our approach combines a self-attention module for feature\nextraction with a novel cross-attention alignment loss, which enforces the\nalignment of sensors' feature spaces without requiring the coupling of the\nclassification pipelines of both modalities. We evaluate D-CAT on three\nmulti-modal human activity datasets (IMU, video, and audio) under both\nin-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios, comparing against uni-modal\nmodels. Results show that in in-distribution scenarios, transferring from\nhigh-performing modalities (e.g., video to IMU) yields up to 10% F1-score gains\nover uni-modal training. In out-of-distribution scenarios, even weaker source\nmodalities (e.g., IMU to video) improve target performance, as long as the\ntarget model isn't overfitted on the training data. By enabling single-sensor\ninference with cross-modal knowledge, D-CAT reduces hardware redundancy for\nperception systems while maintaining accuracy, which is critical for\ncost-sensitive or adaptive deployments (e.g., assistive robots in homes with\nvariable sensor availability).

Therefore, for the\n``composite'' Dirac monopole of the $U(1)_{\\mathrm{diag}}$ gauge group to be\nstable, there must be attractive forces that counter the repulsive magnetic\nCoulomb forces. I argue that such attractive forces are provided by the\nNielsen-Olesen type magnetic flux tubes of unbroken gauge groups. This internal\nstructure of the composite Dirac monopole of $U(1)_{\\mathrm{diag}}$ gauge group\nresembles the composite magnetic monopole found in the model constructed by\nSaraswat arXiv:1608.06951. I estimate the size of the Dirac monopole in\n$U(1)_{\\mathrm{diag}}$ gauge group from the balance between the magnetic\nCoulomb forces and the forces from the tension of the magnetic flux tubes.\nImplications of the results for the Weak Gravity Conjecture are briefly\ndiscussed.",

Traditional\nanalytical approaches suffer from time-consuming geodesic distance queries and\ncomplex self intersection handling, while discrete methods often struggle with\nprecision. In this paper, we propose a totally different algorithm paradigm.\nOur key insight is that by representing the source curve as a sequence of line\nsegment primitives, the Voronoi decomposition constrained to the parametric\nsurface enables localized offset computation. Specifically, the offsetting\nprocess can be efficiently traced by independently visiting the corresponding\nVoronoi cells. To address the challenge of computing the Voronoi decomposition\non parametric surfaces, we introduce two key techniques. First, we employ\nintrinsic triangulation in the parameter space to accurately capture geodesic\ndistances. Second, instead of directly computing the surface-constrained\nVoronoi decomposition, we decompose the triangulated parameter plane using a\nseries of plane cutting operations. Experimental results demonstrate that our\nalgorithm achieves superior accuracy and runtime performance compared to\nexisting methods. We also present several practical applications enabled by our\napproach.",

First, Geometric Adaptability Gap: models trained solely on 2D\ninputs or with hard-coded 3D geometry injection suffer from either insufficient\nspatial information or restricted 2D generalization, leading to poor\nadaptability across tasks with diverse spatial demands. Second, Embodiment\nConstraint Gap: prior work often neglects the physical constraints and\ncapacities of real robots, resulting in task plans that are theoretically valid\nbut practically infeasible. To address these gaps, we introduce OmniEVA -- an\nembodied versatile planner that enables advanced embodied reasoning and task\nplanning through two pivotal innovations: (1) a Task-Adaptive 3D Grounding\nmechanism, which introduces a gated router to perform explicit selective\nregulation of 3D fusion based on contextual requirements, enabling\ncontext-aware 3D grounding for diverse embodied tasks. (2) an Embodiment-Aware\nReasoning framework that jointly incorporates task goals and embodiment\nconstraints into the reasoning loop, resulting in planning decisions that are\nboth goal-directed and executable. Extensive experimental results demonstrate\nthat OmniEVA not only achieves state-of-the-art general embodied reasoning\nperformance, but also exhibits a strong ability across a wide range of\ndownstream scenarios. Evaluations of a suite of proposed embodied benchmarks,\nincluding both primitive and composite tasks, confirm its robust and versatile\nplanning capabilities.

Second, in a series of black-box lab experiments, we\nanalyze the implementations of algorithms for SSH client signatures in 24\npopular SSH clients for Linux, Windows, and macOS.\n  We extracted 31,622,338 keys from three public sources in two scans.

It is well-known that a bias in random nonces in\nECDSA can reveal the secret key through public signatures. For the first time,\nwe show that the use of deterministic nonces in ECDSA can also be dangerous:\nThe private signing key of a PuTTY client can be recovered from just 58 valid\nsignatures if ECDSA with NIST curve P-521 is used.

In order to identify their sources, we need\nprecise knowledge of the mass composition of UHECRs. The direct detection of\nUHECRs is not feasible at energies above 0.1 PeV, necessitating the use of\nmass-sensitive observables of extended air showers induced by UHECRs\ninteracting with the atmosphere. One way to achieve high statistics for these\nmass-sensitive observables is to use ground-based detector arrays, such as the\nSurface Detector (SD) of the Pierre Auger Observatory. The SD consists of three\nsub-arrays of independent detector stations arranged in triangular grids with\ndifferent spacings. Recently, it has been shown that neural networks (NNs) can\nextract mass-sensitive observables from data taken by the SD-1500, the largest\nsub-detector of the SD. In this contribution, we demonstrate the feasibility of\nusing NNs to reconstruct a high-level shower observable, the depth of the\nshower maximum, from data simulated for and observed by the SD-750, the\nsecond-largest detector array nested within the SD-1500. A simulation study\nshows that the SD-750 NN exhibits behavior similar to that of an SD-1500 NN and\noutperforms the latter in the energy range [1, 10) EeV. Moreover, we show that,\nafter performing a correction and calibration procedure, the predictions of the\nSD-750 NN are consistent with the measurement of the depth of the shower\nmaximum obtained by the Fluorescence Detector of the Pierre Auger Observatory.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates automatic piano transcription based on\ncomputationally-efficient yet high-performant variants of the Transformer that\ncan capture longer-term dependency over the whole musical piece. Recently,\ntransformer-based sequence-to-sequence models have demonstrated excellent\nperformance in piano transcription. These models, however, fail to deal with\nthe whole piece at once due to the quadratic complexity of the self-attention\nmechanism, and music signals are thus typically processed in a sliding-window\nmanner in practice. To overcome this limitation, we propose an efficient\narchitecture with sparse attention mechanisms. Specifically, we introduce\nsliding-window self-attention mechanisms for both the encoder and decoder, and\na hybrid global-local cross-attention mechanism that attends to various spans\naccording to the MIDI token types. We also use a hierarchical pooling strategy\nbetween the encoder and decoder to further reduce computational load. Our\nexperiments on the MAESTRO dataset showed that the proposed model achieved a\nsignificant reduction in computational cost and memory usage, accelerating\ninference speed, while maintaining transcription performance comparable to the\nfull-attention baseline. This allows for training with longer audio contexts on\nthe same hardware, demonstrating the viability of sparse attention for building\nefficient and high-performance piano transcription systems.

Theoretical modelling has produced\nconflicting results regarding the mechanism responsible for breaking the disc.\nAnalytical predictions for the measured parameters of GW Ori suggest the disc\nis only marginally stable to tearing. We present new high-resolution\nsimulations of GW Ori that replicate the wavelike regime expected in thick,\nlow-turbulence protoplanetary discs for the first time to settle this question.\nUsing the most optimistic values of misalignment and stellar mass ratio allowed\nby observational constraints, we find that the GW Ori disc can be torn by\nstellar torques alone, without need for an embedded planet. Even if the disc\nretains a smooth warp in simulations with similar parameters, it is likely that\nany small perturbation in the density or temperature structure could cause the\ndisc to break. The new simulations rule out retrograde disc rotation relative\nto the stellar orbits and tentatively suggest the thicker ($h/r = 0.04$) disc\nbetter matches observations. Going forward, we should take care to ensure\nmodels of GW Ori and similar systems appropriately represent the propagation of\nwarps. Additionally, analytical predictions are derived from idealized (and\noften massless) discs and it is useful to assess how each observed disc might\ndeviate from those assumptions, especially in the context of a young and active\nstar-forming neighbourhood.",

This assumption\nbreaks down in complex fluids, such as protein or polymeric solutions, where\nthe solute can influence evaporation through changes in water activity. Here,\nwe investigate model respiratory droplets primarily composed of water, salt,\nand a type of the glycoprotein mucin. Using fluorescence microscopy, we observe\nthe formation of a well-defined protein ring at the droplet edge as water\nevaporates. The growth and morphology of this ring exhibit a strong dependence\non ambient relative humidity ($H_r$), revealing dynamics that existing models\ncannot capture. Specifically, we find that protein accumulation at the edge is\ngoverned by the feedback between local solute concentration and evaporation\nrate. To account for this, we develop a minimal theoretical model based on the\nlubrication approximation, incorporating the coupling between hydrodynamics and\nsolute transport through the evaporation rate.

Although implicit coordination has been extensively considered\nin the existing literature, the majority of work has focused on co-located,\nsynchronous teamwork (such as sports teams) or, in distributed teams, primarily\non coordination of knowledge work. However, many teams (firefighters, military,\nlaw enforcement, emergency response) must coordinate their movements in\nphysical space without the benefit of visual cues or extensive explicit\ncommunication. This paper investigates how three dimensions of spatial\ncoordination, namely exploration diversity, movement specialization, and\nadaptive spatial proximity, influence team performance in a collaborative\nonline search and rescue task where explicit communication is restricted and\nteam members rely on movement patterns to infer others' intentions and\ncoordinate actions. Our metrics capture the relational aspects of teamwork by\nmeasuring spatial proximity, distribution patterns, and alignment of movements\nwithin shared environments. We analyze data from 34 four-person teams (136\nparticipants) assigned to specialized roles in a search and rescue task.\nResults show that spatial specialization positively predicts performance, while\nadaptive spatial proximity exhibits a marginal inverted U-shaped relationship,\nsuggesting moderate levels of adaptation are optimal. Furthermore, the temporal\ndynamics of these metrics differentiate high- from low-performing teams over\ntime.

We employ dust opacity that depends on both temperature and\nmaximum grain size to evaluate analytically the properties of a critically\nfragmenting protoplanetary disc. We find that dust growth may promote disc\nfragmentation at disc radii as small as $\\sim 30$ au. As a result, the critical\ndisc masses and accretion rates are smaller, and the initial fragment masses\nare in the gas giant planet mass regime. While this suggests that formation of\ngas giant planets by disc fragmentation may be more likely than usually\nbelieved, we caution that numerical models of the process are needed to\nevaluate the effects not taken into account here, e.g., dust grain mobility and\nfragment evolution after disc fragmentation.",

A current central task for\nfrequency-domain photons is the creation and manipulation of nontrivial\nnon-Abelian field strength tensors and observing their governing dynamics.\nHere, we experimentally demonstrate a miniaturized scheme for creating\nnon-Abelian electric fields in a photonic frequency chain using a\npolarization-multiplexed, time-modulated ring resonator. By engineering\nspin-orbit coupling via modulation dephasing, polarization rotation, and\npolarization retardation, we achieve programmable control over synthetic\nFloquet bands and their quasimomentum spin-resolved textures. Leveraging\nself-heterodyne coherent detection, we demonstrate Zitterbewegung -- a\ntrembling motion of photons -- induced by non-Abelian electric fields on the\nfrequency chain. We further observe the interference between Zitterbewegung and\nBloch oscillations arising from the coexistence of non-Abelian and Abelian\nelectric fields. Our work bridges synthetic dimensions with non-Abelian gauge\ntheory for versatile photonic emulation of relativistic quantum mechanics and\nspinor dynamics, and can be instrumental in applications like frequency-domain\noptical computation and multimodal frequency comb control.",

However, the absence of a large, labeled dataset limits the use of\nsupervised learning. Existing methods, such as keyword searches, transfer\nlearning, and citation-based heuristics, lack scalability and generalizability.\nThis paper frames patent-to-SDG classification as a weak supervision problem,\nusing citations from patents to SDG-tagged scientific publications (NPL\ncitations) as a noisy initial signal. To address its sparsity and noise, we\ndevelop a composite labeling function (LF) that uses large language models\n(LLMs) to extract structured concepts, namely functions, solutions, and\napplications, from patents and SDG papers based on a patent ontology.\nCross-domain similarity scores are computed and combined using a rank-based\nretrieval approach. The LF is calibrated via a custom positive-only loss that\naligns with known NPL-SDG links without penalizing discovery of new SDG\nassociations. The result is a silver-standard, soft multi-label dataset mapping\npatents to SDGs, enabling the training of effective multi-label regression\nmodels. We validate our approach through two complementary strategies: (1)\ninternal validation against held-out NPL-based labels, where our method\noutperforms several baselines including transformer-based models, and zero-shot\nLLM; and (2) external validation using network modularity in patent citation,\nco-inventor, and co-applicant graphs, where our labels reveal greater thematic,\ncognitive, and organizational coherence than traditional technological\nclassifications. These results show that weak supervision and semantic\nalignment can enhance SDG classification at scale.",

This paper\naddresses this issue by proposing an intuitive theoretical framework that\nrecasts the original problem as determining the contributions of different\nincidence functions to the dynamics based on given observations. Specifically,\nthe choice of an incidence function is linked to a weight assigned to it.\nMathematically, this leads to a PDE-constrained optimization problem, where the\nobjective is to identify the weights of a convex combination of multiple\nincidence functions that best approximate the experimental observations\ngenerated by the model.

    "abstract": "Segmentation models are important tools for the detection and analysis of\nlesions in brain MRI. Depending on the type of brain pathology that is imaged,\nMRI scanners can acquire multiple, different image modalities (contrasts). Most\nsegmentation models for multimodal brain MRI are restricted to fixed modalities\nand cannot effectively process new ones at inference. Some models generalize to\nunseen modalities but may lose discriminative modality-specific information.\nThis work aims to develop a model that can perform inference on data that\ncontain image modalities unseen during training, previously seen modalities,\nand heterogeneous combinations of both, thus allowing a user to utilize any\navailable imaging modalities. We demonstrate this is possible with a simple,\nthus practical alteration to the U-net architecture, by integrating a\nmodality-agnostic input channel or pathway, alongside modality-specific input\nchannels. To train this modality-agnostic component, we develop an image\naugmentation scheme that synthesizes artificial MRI modalities. Augmentations\ndifferentially alter the appearance of pathological and healthy brain tissue to\ncreate artificial contrasts between them while maintaining realistic anatomical\nintegrity. We evaluate the method using 8 MRI databases that include 5 types of\npathologies (stroke, tumours, traumatic brain injury, multiple sclerosis and\nwhite matter hyperintensities) and 8 modalities (T1, T1+contrast, T2, PD, SWI,\nDWI, ADC and FLAIR). The results demonstrate that the approach preserves the\nability to effectively process MRI modalities encountered during training,\nwhile being able to process new, unseen modalities to improve its segmentation.\nProject code: https://github.com/Anthony-P-Addison/AGN-MOD-SEG",

    "abstract": "Chart understanding presents a critical test to the reasoning capabilities of\nVision-Language Models (VLMs). Prior approaches face critical limitations: some\nrely on external tools, making them brittle and constrained by a predefined\ntoolkit, while others fine-tune specialist models that often adopt a single\nreasoning strategy, such as text-based chain-of-thought (CoT). The intermediate\nsteps of text-based reasoning are difficult to verify, which complicates the\nuse of reinforcement-learning signals that reward factual accuracy. To address\nthis, we propose a Code-as-Thought (CaT) approach to represent the visual\ninformation of a chart in a verifiable, symbolic format. Our key insight is\nthat this strategy must be adaptive: a fixed, code-only implementation\nconsistently fails on complex charts where symbolic representation is\nunsuitable. This finding leads us to introduce Visual Programmability: a\nlearnable property that determines if a chart-question pair is better solved\nwith code or direct visual analysis. We implement this concept in an adaptive\nframework where a VLM learns to choose between the CaT pathway and a direct\nvisual reasoning pathway. The selection policy of the model is trained with\nreinforcement learning using a novel dual-reward system. This system combines a\ndata-accuracy reward to ground the model in facts and prevent numerical\nhallucination, with a decision reward that teaches the model when to use each\nstrategy, preventing it from defaulting to a single reasoning mode. Experiments\ndemonstrate strong and robust performance across diverse chart-understanding\nbenchmarks. Our work shows that VLMs can be taught not only to reason but also\nhow to reason, dynamically selecting the optimal reasoning pathway for each\ntask.",

We formulate the switching interaction as a dynamic game in which\nauthority is embedded directly into the system dynamics, resulting in Nash\nequilibrium(NE)-based strategies rather than ad hoc switching rules. We\nestablish the existence and characterization of NE in the space of pure\ntakeover strategies under stochastic human intent.

We further introduce a\nbimatrix potential game reformulation to address scenarios where human and\nautonomy utilities are not perfectly aligned, yielding a unifying potential\nfunction that preserves tractability while capturing intent deviations. The\nframework is applied to a vehicle trajectory tracking problem, demonstrating\nhow equilibrium takeover strategies adapt across straight and curved path\nsegments.

The whole\nsystem is a high-order, nonlinear differential system, making analysis\nintractable without principled simplifications. Hence, contraction stability\nanalysis in GFMI is proposed to guarantee the large-signal stability.\nFurthermore, a contraction-based controller is proposed to synchronize GFMI.\nAdditionally, this paper proposes integrating an auxiliary virtual-impedance\nlayer into the contraction-based controller to achieve proportional current\nsharing, while the GFMI retains global stability and voltage synchronization. A\ndispatchable virtual oscillator control (dVOC), also known as the\nAndronov--Hopf oscillator (AHO) is used to validate the proposed contraction\nstability analysis and contraction-based controller with virtual-impedance.

Under some specified non-globally\nLipschitz conditions, we derive the propagation of chaos, and the mean-square\nconvergence rate over infinite time horizon for general one-step time\ndiscretization schemes for the underlying Mckean-Vlasov SDEs. As an application\nof the general result it is obtained the mean-square convergence rate over\ninfinite time horizon for two numerical schemes: the projected Euler scheme and\nthe backward Euler scheme for Mckean-Vlasov SDEs in non-globally Lipschitz\nsettings.

    "abstract": "The formation of patterns and exotic nonequilibrium steady states in\nactive-fluid systems continues to pose challenging problems -- theoretical,\nnumerical, and experimental -- for statistical physicists and fluid\ndynamicists. We combine theoretical ideas from statistical mechanics and fluid\nmechanics to uncover a new type of self-assembled crystal of vortex triplets in\nan active-spinner fluid. We begin with the two-dimensional\nCahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes (CHNS) model for a binary-fluid system of active\nrotors that has two important ingredients: a scalar order parameter field phi\nthat distinguishes regions with clockwise (CW) and counter-clockwise (CCW)\nspinners; and an incompressible velocity field u. In addition to the\nconventional CHNS coupling between phi and u, this model has a torque-induced\nactivity term, with coefficient tau, whose consequences we explore. We\ndemonstrate that, if we increase the activity tau, it overcomes dissipation and\nthis system displays a hitherto unanticipated emergent triangular crystal, with\nspinning vortex triplets at its vertices. We show that this is a nonequilibrium\ncounterpart of an equilibrium plastic crystal. We characterise the statistical\nproperties of this novel crystal and suggest possible experimental realisations\nof this new state of active matter.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge graphs, a powerful tool for structuring information through\nrelational triplets, have recently become the new front-runner in enhancing\nquestion-answering systems. While traditional Retrieval Augmented Generation\n(RAG) approaches are proficient in fact-based and local context-based\nextraction from concise texts, they encounter limitations when addressing the\nthematic and holistic understanding of complex, extensive texts, requiring a\ndeeper analysis of both text and context. This paper presents a comprehensive\ntechnical comparative study of three different methodologies for constructing\nknowledge graph triplets and integrating them with Large Language Models (LLMs)\nfor question answering: spaCy, Stanford CoreNLP-OpenIE, and GraphRAG, all\nleveraging open source technologies. We evaluate the effectiveness,\nfeasibility, and adaptability of these methods by analyzing their capabilities,\nstate of development, and their impact on the performance of LLM-based question\nanswering. Experimental results indicate that while OpenIE provides the most\ncomprehensive coverage of triplets, GraphRAG demonstrates superior reasoning\nabilities among the three. We conclude with a discussion on the strengths and\nlimitations of each method and provide insights into future directions for\nimproving knowledge graph-based question answering.",

We\nidentify two classes of models that lead to decoupled equations for the scale\nfactor on the brane: one characterized by a particular choice of boundary\nconditions for the St\\\"uckelberg fields and one characterized by a special\ntuning between the coefficients of the 5D and 4D potentials.

We analyze how delays affect the spatial\nlocality of the optimal feedback gain leveraging the problem decoupling in the\nspatial frequency domain. For the cases of expensive control and small delay,\nwe provide exact expressions of the optimal controllers in the limit for\ninfinite control weight and vanishing delay, respectively. In the expensive\ncontrol regime, the optimal feedback control law decomposes into a delay-aware\nfiltering of the delayed state and the optimal controller in the delay-free\nsetting. Under small delays, the optimal controller is a perturbation of the\ndelay-free one which depends linearly on the delay. We illustrate our\nanalytical findings with a reaction-diffusion process over the real line and a\nmulti-agent system coupled through circulant matrices, showing that delays\nreduce the effectiveness of optimal feedback control and may require each\nsubsystem within a distributed implementation to communicate with farther-away\nlocations.",

Here, we show how isotope-induced inversion symmetry\nbreaking influences ultrafast photoisomerization processes in ethylene. Using\nextreme ultraviolet pump-near infrared probe time-of-flight mass spectrometry,\nwe find that replacing one of the carbon atoms in ethylene with a 13C isotope\nleads to twice-faster structural relaxation via ethylene-ethylidene\nisomerization in the photo-excited molecular cation. Advanced trajectory\nsurface hopping calculations incorporating the nuclear symmetry of the\nmolecular systems, reveal that it arises from the mixing of different normal\nmodes in the isotope-substituted species, interactions otherwise forbidden by\nsymmetry. Although the mixing does not alter the symmetry of the electronic\nHamiltonian, it modifies that of the nuclear Hamiltonian, causing explicit\nsymmetry breaking. This facilitates efficient intra-molecular vibrational\nenergy redistribution, lowering the isomerization yield. Our findings offer\nopportunities to use isotope-induced nuclear symmetry breaking to control the\noutcome of light-molecule interactions across ultrafast timescales.",

Existing efficient segmentation models are typically static and\nmanually designed prior to training, which restricts their adaptability across\ndiverse tasks and makes it difficult to balance performance with resource\nefficiency. In this paper, we propose PSP-Seg, a progressive pruning framework\nthat enables dynamic and efficient 3D segmentation. PSP-Seg begins with a\nredundant model and iteratively prunes redundant modules through a combination\nof block-wise pruning and a functional decoupling loss. We evaluate PSP-Seg on\nfive public datasets, benchmarking it against seven state-of-the-art models and\nsix efficient segmentation models. Results demonstrate that the lightweight\nvariant, PSP-Seg-S, achieves performance on par with nnU-Net while reducing GPU\nmemory usage by 42-45%, training time by 29-48%, and parameter number by 83-87%\nacross all datasets. These findings underscore PSP-Seg's potential as a\ncost-effective yet high-performing alternative for widespread clinical\napplication.",

    "abstract": "The electromagnetic structure of the nucleon can be determined from the\nscattering of electrons off a nucleon target. However, to study its axial\nstructure, neutrino beams are required. The results from these experiments\nshould be extrapolated to zero energy-momentum transfers to access the static\nproperties of the nucleon. For baryons with strange quarks, hyperons, the\nstatic limit can instead be approached in semi-leptonic decays, which give\ndirect access to the weak magnetism and axial-vector coupling strengths that\nare inaccessible in electromagnetic interactions. The axial-vector coupling as\nwhile weak magnetism coupling and the overall normalization, given by form\nfactor $f_1$, are being determined with increased precision from the theory of\nstrong interactions using a first principles formulation on the space--time\nlattice. Furthermore, the probability of the semi-leptonic hyperon decay is\napproximately proportional to $|V_{us}|^2\\cdot (f_1^2+3g_1^2)$, where $V_{us}$\nis the CKM matrix element responsible for the transition between an $s$ and a\n$u$ quark. Current determinations of $|V_{us}|$ come from kaon decays, but the\nresults are not consistent and could indicate a deviation from CKM matrix\nunitarity, a tell-tale sign of physics beyond the Standard Model (SM) of\nelementary particles. Here we determine the absolute branching fraction and\nweak coupling strengths for $\\Lambda\\to p e^-\\bar\\nu_e$, and $\\bar \\Lambda\\to\n\\bar p e^+\\nu_e$. These observables combined with form factors determined from\nfirst-principle lattice QCD calculations allow for the extraction of the\n$|V_{us}|$ value. We demonstrate how $|V_{us}|$ can be extracted with\nincreasing sensitivity using polarized hyperons from entangled,\nbaryon-antibaryon pairs, thus enabling a complementary road to that of meson\ndecays. In addition, the presented experimental method can be used for other\nsemileptonic decays of baryons.",

    "abstract": "In long-horizon tasks, recent agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs)\nface a significant challenge that sparse, outcome-based rewards make it\ndifficult to assign credit to intermediate steps. Previous methods mainly focus\non creating dense reward signals to guide learning, either through traditional\nreinforcement learning techniques like inverse reinforcement learning or by\nusing Process Reward Models for step-by-step feedback. In this paper, we\nidentify a fundamental problem in the learning dynamics of LLMs: the magnitude\nof policy gradients is inherently coupled with the entropy, which leads to\ninefficient small updates for confident correct actions and potentially\ndestabilizes large updates for uncertain ones. To resolve this, we propose\nEntropy-Modulated Policy Gradients (EMPG), a framework that re-calibrates the\nlearning signal based on step-wise uncertainty and the final task outcome. EMPG\namplifies updates for confident correct actions, penalizes confident errors,\nand attenuates updates from uncertain steps to stabilize exploration. We\nfurther introduce a bonus term for future clarity that encourages agents to\nfind more predictable solution paths. Through comprehensive experiments on\nthree challenging agent tasks, WebShop, ALFWorld, and Deep Search, we\ndemonstrate that EMPG achieves substantial performance gains and significantly\noutperforms strong policy gradient baselines.

    "abstract": "Electroencephalography (EEG) signal cleaning has long been a critical\nchallenge in the research community. The presence of artifacts can\nsignificantly degrade EEG data quality, complicating analysis and potentially\nleading to erroneous interpretations. While various artifact rejection methods\nhave been proposed, the gold standard remains manual visual inspection by human\nexperts-a process that is time-consuming, subjective, and impractical for\nlarge-scale EEG studies. Existing techniques are often hindered by a strong\nreliance on manual hyperparameter tuning, sensitivity to outliers, and high\ncomputational costs. In this paper, we introduce the improved Riemannian Potato\nField (iRPF), a fast and fully automated method for EEG artifact rejection that\naddresses key limitations of current approaches. We evaluate iRPF against\nseveral state-of-the-art artifact rejection methods, using two publicly\navailable EEG databases, labeled for various artifact types, comprising 226 EEG\nrecordings. Our results demonstrate that iRPF outperforms all competitors\nacross multiple metrics, with gains of up to 22% in recall, 102% in\nspecificity, 54% in precision, and 24% in F1-score, compared to Isolation\nForest, Autoreject, Riemannian Potato, and Riemannian Potato Field,\nrespectively. Statistical analysis confirmed the significance of these\nimprovements (p < 0.001) with large effect sizes (Cohen's d > 0.8) in most\ncomparisons. Additionally, on a typical EEG recording iRPF performs artifact\ncleaning in under 8 milliseconds per epoch using a standard laptop,\nhighlighting its efficiency for large-scale EEG data processing and real-time\napplications. iRPF offers a robust and data-driven artifact rejection solution\nfor high-quality EEG pre-processing in brain-computer interfaces and clinical\nneuroimaging applications.",

    "abstract": "Long video understanding remains a fundamental challenge for multimodal large\nlanguage models (MLLMs), particularly in tasks requiring precise temporal\nreasoning and event localization. Existing approaches typically adopt uniform\nframe sampling and rely on implicit position encodings to model temporal order.\nHowever, these methods struggle with long-range dependencies, leading to\ncritical information loss and degraded temporal comprehension. In this paper,\nwe propose Dynamic Absolute Time Enhancement (DATE) that enhances temporal\nawareness in MLLMs through the Timestamp Injection Mechanism (TIM) and a\nsemantically guided Temporal-Aware Similarity Sampling (TASS) strategy.\nSpecifically, we interleave video frame embeddings with textual timestamp\ntokens to construct a continuous temporal reference system. We further\nreformulate the video sampling problem as a vision-language retrieval task and\nintroduce a two-stage algorithm to ensure both semantic relevance and temporal\ncoverage: enriching each query into a descriptive caption to better align with\nthe vision feature, and sampling key event with a similarity-driven temporally\nregularized greedy strategy. Our method achieves remarkable improvements w.r.t.\nabsolute time understanding and key event localization, resulting in\nstate-of-the-art performance among 7B and 72B models on hour-long video\nbenchmarks. Particularly, our 7B model even exceeds many 72B models on some\nbenchmarks.",

Our work tackles the dual challenges of strict complexity\nconstraints and robust generalization to both seen and unseen devices, while\nalso leveraging the new rule allowing the use of device labels at test time.\nOur proposed system is based on a knowledge distillation framework where an\nefficient CP-MobileNet student learns from a compact, specialized two-teacher\nensemble. This ensemble combines a baseline PaSST teacher, trained with\nstandard cross-entropy, and a 'generalization expert' teacher. This expert is\ntrained using our novel Device-Aware Feature Alignment (DAFA) loss, adapted\nfrom prior work, which explicitly structures the feature space for device\nrobustness. To capitalize on the availability of test-time device labels, the\ndistilled student model then undergoes a final device-specific fine-tuning\nstage. Our proposed system achieves a final accuracy of 57.93\\% on the\ndevelopment set, demonstrating a significant improvement over the official\nbaseline, particularly on unseen devices.",

Specifically, the system evolves from\nstable periodic oscillation through an intermittent-chaos regime before fully\ndeveloping into chaotic motion. As system parameters vary, the proportion of\nchaotic motion in the time-domain increases asymptotically until chaotic\ndynamics dominates entirely. Moreover, it is counterintuitive that,\nintermittent chaos can act as noise of a favorable intensity compared with\npurely periodic or fully chaotic states, and enhance rather than reduce\nsystem's responses in nonlinear ultrasonic detection.

However, their\neffectiveness in specialized domains such as dentistry remains underexplored.\nIn particular, panoramic X-rays, a widely used imaging modality in oral\nradiology, pose interpretative challenges due to dense anatomical structures\nand subtle pathological cues, which are not captured by existing medical\nbenchmarks or instruction datasets. To this end, we introduce MMOral, the first\nlarge-scale multimodal instruction dataset and benchmark tailored for panoramic\nX-ray interpretation. MMOral consists of 20,563 annotated images paired with\n1.3 million instruction-following instances across diverse task types,\nincluding attribute extraction, report generation, visual question answering,\nand image-grounded dialogue. In addition, we present MMOral-Bench, a\ncomprehensive evaluation suite covering five key diagnostic dimensions in\ndentistry. We evaluate 64 LVLMs on MMOral-Bench and find that even the\nbest-performing model, i.e., GPT-4o, only achieves 41.45% accuracy, revealing\nsignificant limitations of current models in this domain. To promote the\nprogress of this specific domain, we also propose OralGPT, which conducts\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) upon Qwen2.5-VL-7B with our meticulously curated\nMMOral instruction dataset. Remarkably, a single epoch of SFT yields\nsubstantial performance enhancements for LVLMs, e.g., OralGPT demonstrates a\n24.73% improvement.

In this work, we numerically explore the effect\nof optical feedback on the emission properties of a dual-wavelength laser using\na rate equation model. We focus on switching capability and investigate the\nimpact of key laser and feedback parameters. We connect the emergence of\nsimultaneous emission to a lower cross-saturation between modes, and\ndemonstrate that robust switching can be achieved using a short feedback cavity\nand a sufficiently strong feedback. In particular and in contrast to previous\npublications, we highlight that the feedback phase difference between the two\nmodes is not a critical parameter.

    "abstract": "Background and objective Early diagnosis of gastric diseases is crucial to\nprevent fatal outcomes. Although histopathologic examination remains the\ndiagnostic gold standard, it is performed entirely manually, making evaluations\nlabor-intensive and prone to variability among pathologists. Critical findings\nmay be missed, and lack of standard procedures reduces consistency. These\nlimitations highlight the need for automated, reliable, and efficient methods\nfor gastric tissue analysis. Methods In this study, a novel hybrid model named\nCoAtNeXt was proposed for the classification of gastric tissue images. The\nmodel is built upon the CoAtNet architecture by replacing its MBConv layers\nwith enhanced ConvNeXtV2 blocks. Additionally, the Convolutional Block\nAttention Module (CBAM) is integrated to improve local feature extraction\nthrough channel and spatial attention mechanisms. The architecture was scaled\nto achieve a balance between computational efficiency and classification\nperformance. CoAtNeXt was evaluated on two publicly available datasets,\nHMU-GC-HE-30K for eight-class classification and GasHisSDB for binary\nclassification, and was compared against 10 Convolutional Neural Networks\n(CNNs) and ten Vision Transformer (ViT) models. Results CoAtNeXt achieved\n96.47% accuracy, 96.60% precision, 96.47% recall, 96.45% F1 score, and 99.89%\nAUC on HMU-GC-HE-30K. On GasHisSDB, it reached 98.29% accuracy, 98.07%\nprecision, 98.41% recall, 98.23% F1 score, and 99.90% AUC. It outperformed all\nCNN and ViT models tested and surpassed previous studies in the literature.\nConclusion Experimental results show that CoAtNeXt is a robust architecture for\nhistopathological classification of gastric tissue images, providing\nperformance on binary and multiclass. Its highlights its potential to assist\npathologists by enhancing diagnostic accuracy and reducing workload.",

    "abstract": "Modern smartphones are equipped with Lidar sensors providing depth-sensing\ncapabilities. Recent works have shown that this complementary sensor allows to\nimprove various tasks in image processing, including deblurring.

At the same time, there is also a\nlack of blind zero-shot methods that can deblur a real image using the depth\nguidance without requiring extensive training sets of paired data. In this\npaper, we propose an image deblurring method based on denoising diffusion\nmodels that can leverage the Lidar depth guidance and does not require training\ndata with paired Lidar depth maps. We also present the first dataset with real\nblurred images with corresponding Lidar depth maps and sharp ground truth\nimages, acquired with an Apple iPhone 15 Pro, for the purpose of studying\nLidar-guided deblurring. Experimental results on this novel dataset show that\nLidar guidance is effective and the proposed method outperforms\nstate-of-the-art deblurring methods in terms of perceptual quality.",

Furthermore, these functions are often\nstochastic as repeated experiments are subject to unmeasurable disturbances.\nBayesian optimization can be used to optimize such methods in an efficient\nmanner by deploying a probabilistic function estimator to estimate with a given\nconfidence so that regions of the search space can be pruned away.\nConsequently, the success of the Bayesian optimization depends on the function\nestimator's ability to provide informative confidence bounds.

Methods: We utilized a publicly available longitudinal OCT dataset at\nfive stages (preoperative, 2 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months). A stage\nspecific segmentation model delineated related structures, and an automated\npipeline extracted quantitative, composite, qualitative, and dynamic features.\nBinary logistic regression models, constructed with and without dynamic\nparameters, assessed their incremental predictive value for best-corrected\nvisual acuity (BCVA). A multimodal DL model combining clinical variables,\nOCT-derived features, and raw OCT images was developed and benchmarked against\nregression models. Results: The segmentation model achieved high accuracy\nacross all timepoints (mean Dice > 0.89). Univariate and multivariate analyses\nidentified base diameter, ellipsoid zone integrity, and macular hole area as\nsignificant BCVA predictors (P < 0.05). Incorporating dynamic recovery rates\nconsistently improved logistic regression AUC, especially at the 3-month\nfollow-up. The multimodal DL model outperformed logistic regression, yielding\nhigher AUCs and overall accuracy at each stage. The difference is as high as\n0.12, demonstrating the complementary value of raw image volume and dynamic\nparameters.

Given the QA history, there are two\ncategories of solutions to predict the correctness, conducting the simulation:\n(1) LLM-free methods, which apply a traditional sequential model to transfer\nthe QA history into a vector representation first, and make predictions based\non the representation; (2) LLM-based methods, which leverage the domain\nknowledge and reasoning capability of LLM to enhence the prediction.

    "abstract": "Long-period radio transients (LPTs) are a new class of coherent radio sources\nwith periods ranging from minutes to hours. Recently, two LPT sources, ILT\nJ1101+5521 and GLEAM-X J0704-37, with periods of 2-3 hours has been confirmed\nto originate from white dwarf (WD) -- M dwarf (MD) binaries. In this work, we\npropose that at least some LPTs originate from the magnetic WD -- MD binaries\nin the pre-polar phase. The asynchronism between the WD's rotation and the\nbinary's orbital motion allows for the unipolar-inductor mechanism or\nmagnetosphere interaction to operate and accelerate radiating particles, with\nthe dominant process depending on the magnetic moment ratio of the two stars.\nUnder asynchronism condition, both the peak flux and the polarization of radio\npulses will be modulated by the beat period. The pre-polar phase characterized\nby an extremely low accretion rate provides the relatively clean magnetospheric\nenvironment necessary for a loss-cone-driven maser (LCDM) mechanism to operate,\nproducing the LPT emission. The observed pulse duty cycle of $10^{-3}-10^{-1}$\nis attributed to a beaming effect modulated by the binary's magnetic geometry.\nFurthermore, the magnetized environment of a WD--MD binary is conducive to\nFaraday conversion with weak coupling, which implies that the polarization\nstate of LPTs should vary significantly at different periods. Finally, we\npredict that LPTs from WD--MD binaries should exhibit a period distribution\nfollowing $f_P(P)dP \\propto P^{-(1.67-2.33)}dP$ and a luminosity function\ndescribed by $f_L(L)dL \\propto L^{-(1.80-2.67)}dL$, which can be tested by the\nfuture large sample.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs)-empowered autonomous agents are transforming\nboth digital and physical environments by enabling adaptive, multi-agent\ncollaboration. While these agents offer significant opportunities across\ndomains such as finance, healthcare, and smart manufacturing, their\nunpredictable behaviors and heterogeneous capabilities pose substantial\ngovernance and accountability challenges. In this paper, we propose a\nblockchain-enabled layered architecture for regulatory agent collaboration,\ncomprising an agent layer, a blockchain data layer, and a regulatory\napplication layer. Within this framework, we design three key modules: (i) an\nagent behavior tracing and arbitration module for automated accountability,\n(ii) a dynamic reputation evaluation module for trust assessment in\ncollaborative scenarios, and (iii) a malicious behavior forecasting module for\nearly detection of adversarial activities. Our approach establishes a\nsystematic foundation for trustworthy, resilient, and scalable regulatory\nmechanisms in large-scale agent ecosystems. Finally, we discuss the future\nresearch directions for blockchain-enabled regulatory frameworks in multi-agent\nsystems.",

The\nindicators are also called features synonymously, the machine learning models\nfor feature selection were applied and it was observed that the Least Absolute\nShrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) method combined with, the machine\nLearning Classifiers such as Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Trees (DT),\nRandom Forest (RF) Tree, and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBOOST) models were\nused to suggest the growth of the agro-tourism.

    "abstract": "Objective assessment of source-separation systems still mismatches subjective\nhuman perception, especially when leakage and self-distortion interact. We\nintroduce the Perceptual Separation (PS) and Perceptual Match (PM), the first\npair of measures that functionally isolate these two factors. Our intrusive\nmethod begins with generating a bank of fundamental distortions for each\nreference waveform signal in the mixture. Distortions, references, and their\nrespective system outputs from all sources are then independently encoded by a\npre-trained self-supervised learning model. These representations are\naggregated and projected onto a manifold via diffusion maps, which aligns\nEuclidean distances on the manifold with dissimilarities of the encoded\nwaveforms. On this manifold, the PM measures the Mahalanobis distance from each\noutput to its attributed cluster that consists of its reference and distortions\nembeddings, capturing self-distortion. The PS accounts for the Mahalanobis\ndistance of the output to the attributed and to the closest non-attributed\nclusters, quantifying leakage. Both measures are differentiable and granular,\noperating at a resolution as low as 50 frames per second. We further derive,\nfor both measures, deterministic error radius and non-asymptotic,\nhigh-probability confidence intervals (CIs). Experiments on English, Spanish,\nand music mixtures show that the PS and PM nearly always achieve the highest\nlinear correlation coefficients with human mean-opinion scores than 14\ncompetitors, reaching as high as 86.36% for speech and 87.21% for music. We\nobserve, at worst, an error radius of 1.39% and a probabilistic 95% CI of\n12.21% for these coefficients, which improves reliable and informed evaluation.\nUsing mutual information, the measures complement each other most as their\nvalues decrease, suggesting they are jointly more informative as system\nperformance degrades.",

In particular, to explicitly and\ncomprehensively capture the evolving social interactions in future scenarios,\ngiven their inherent uncertainty, we design a progressive modeling of scenarios\nwith dynamic heterogeneous graphs. With the unfolding of such dynamic\nheterogeneous graphs, a factorized architecture is designed to process the\nspatio-temporal dependencies within future scenarios and progressively\neliminate uncertainty in future motions of multiple agents. Furthermore, a\nmulti-scale decoding procedure is incorporated to improve on the future\nscenario modeling and consistent prediction of agents' future motion.

We\nclose this gap by introducing the first real-world, agent-oriented pentesting\nbenchmark, TermiBench, which shifts the goal from 'flag finding' to achieving\nfull system control. The benchmark spans 510 hosts across 25 services and 30\nCVEs, with realistic environments that require autonomous reconnaissance,\ndiscrimination between benign and exploitable services, and robust exploit\nexecution. Using this benchmark, we find that existing systems can hardly\nobtain system shells under realistic conditions.\n  To address these challenges, we propose TermiAgent, a multi-agent penetration\ntesting framework. TermiAgent mitigates long-context forgetting with a Located\nMemory Activation mechanism and builds a reliable exploit arsenal via\nstructured code understanding rather than naive retrieval. In evaluations, our\nwork outperforms state-of-the-art agents, exhibiting stronger penetration\ntesting capability, reducing execution time and financial cost, and\ndemonstrating practicality even on laptop-scale deployments.

In the SP\nmodel, by assuming that some atoms composing amorphous dust are trapped in a\ndouble-well potential (DWP) described by a quartic function, the electric\ninteraction can be solved directly, allowing the absorption cross-section of\nthe amorphous dust to be calculated. We present numerical and analytical\nsolutions for the absorption cross-section of amorphous dust and compare these\nresults, finding good agreement for the DWP with a sufficiently high potential\nbarrier. Our findings show that the SP model can reproduce the observed\nspectrum of the Perseus molecular cloud with slightly better accuracy than the\nconventional TLS model. Additionally, the SP model can more effectively explain\nvarious long-wavelength dust emission features, such as the spectrum flattening\nin the submillimeter range and anomalous microwave emission (AME), compared to\nthe TLS model.

    "abstract": "Universal audio codecs learn entangled representations across audio types,\nwhereas some specific codecs offer decoupled representations but are limited to\nspeech. Real-world audio, however, often contains mixed speech and background\nsounds, and downstream tasks require selective access to these components.\nTherefore, we rethink the audio codec as a universal disentangled\nrepresentation learner to enable controllable feature selection across\ndifferent audio tasks. To this end, we introduce DeCodec, a novel neural codec\nthat learns to decouple audio representations into orthogonal subspaces\ndedicated to speech and background sound, and within speech, representations\nare further decomposed into semantic and paralinguistic components. This\nhierarchical disentanglement allows flexible feature selection, making DeCodec\na universal front-end for multiple audio applications. Technically, built upon\na codec framework, DeCodec incorporates two key innovations: a subspace\northogonal projection module that factorizes the input into two decoupled\northogonal subspaces, and a representation swap training procedure that ensures\nthese two subspaces are correlate to the speech and background sound,\nrespectively. These allows parallel RVQs to quantize speech and background\nsound components independently. Furthermore, we employ semantic guidance to the\nspeech RVQ to achieve semantic and paralinguistic decomposition. Experimental\nresults show that DeCodec maintains advanced signal reconstruction while\nenabling new capabilities: superior speech enhancement and effective one-shot\nvoice conversion on noisy speech via representation recombination, improved ASR\nrobustness through clean semantic features, and controllable background sound\npreservation/suppression in TTS.

    "abstract": "Accurate human trajectory prediction is crucial for robotics navigation and\nautonomous driving. Recent research has demonstrated that incorporating goal\nguidance significantly enhances prediction accuracy by reducing uncertainty and\nleveraging prior knowledge. Most goal-guided approaches decouple the prediction\ntask into two stages: goal prediction and subsequent trajectory completion\nbased on the predicted goal, which operate at extreme granularities:\ncoarse-grained goal prediction forecasts the overall intention, while\nfine-grained trajectory completion needs to generate the positions for all\nfuture timesteps. The potential utility of intermediate temporal granularity\nremains largely unexplored, which motivates multi-granularity trajectory\nmodeling. While prior work has shown that multi-granularity representations\ncapture diverse scales of human dynamics and motion patterns, effectively\nintegrating this concept into goal-guided frameworks remains challenging. In\nthis paper, we propose MGTraj, a novel Multi-Granularity goal-guided model for\nhuman Trajectory prediction. MGTraj recursively encodes trajectory proposals\nfrom coarse to fine granularity levels. At each level, a transformer-based\nrecursive refinement network (RRN) captures features and predicts progressive\nrefinements. Features across different granularities are integrated using a\nweight-sharing strategy, and velocity prediction is employed as an auxiliary\ntask to further enhance performance. Comprehensive experimental results in\nEHT/UCY and Stanford Drone Dataset indicate that MGTraj outperforms baseline\nmethods and achieves state-of-the-art performance among goal-guided methods.",

A common approach is\nTrie-based biasing, which gives \"bonus scores\" to partial hypothesis (e.g.\n\"Bon\") that may lead to the generation of the rare word (e.g. \"Bonham\"). If the\nfull word (\"Bonham\") isn't ultimately recognized, the system revokes those\nearlier bonuses. This revocation is limited to beam search and is\ncomputationally expensive, particularly for models with large decoders. To\novercome these limitations, we propose adapting ASR models to look ahead and\npredict multiple steps at once. This avoids the revocation step entirely by\nbetter estimating whether a partial hypothesis will lead to the generation of\nthe full rare word.

We introduce DART (Dual Architecture for Regression\nTasks), a framework addressing the challenge of transforming coarse atmospheric\nforecasts into high-resolution satellite brightness temperature fields\noptimized for extreme convection detection (below 220 K). DART employs\ndual-decoder architecture with explicit background/extreme decomposition,\nphysically motivated oversampling, and task-specific loss functions. We present\nfour key findings: (1) empirical validation of the Statistical Similarity Trap\nacross multiple sophisticated baselines; (2) the \"IVT Paradox\", removing\nIntegrated Water Vapor Transport, widely regarded as essential for atmospheric\nriver analysis, improves extreme convection detection by 270%; (3)\narchitectural necessity demonstrated through operational flexibility (DART\nachieves CSI = 0.273 with bias = 2.52 vs. 6.72 for baselines at equivalent\nCSI), and (4) real-world validation with the August 2023 Chittagong flooding\ndisaster as a case study.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are fast becoming indispensable tools for\nsoftware developers, assisting or even partnering with them in crafting complex\nprograms. The advantages are evident -- LLMs can significantly reduce\ndevelopment time, generate well-organized and comprehensible code, and\noccasionally suggest innovative ideas that developers might not conceive on\ntheir own. However, despite their strengths, LLMs will often introduce\nsignificant errors and present incorrect code with persuasive confidence,\npotentially misleading developers into accepting flawed solutions.\n  In order to bring LLMs into the software development cycle in a more reliable\nmanner, we propose a methodology for combining them with ``traditional''\nsoftware engineering techniques in a structured way, with the goal of\nstreamlining the development process, reducing errors, and enabling users to\nverify crucial program properties with increased confidence. Specifically, we\nfocus on the Scenario-Based Programming (SBP) paradigm -- an event-driven,\nscenario-based approach for software engineering -- to allow human developers\nto pour their expert knowledge into the LLM, as well as to inspect and verify\nits outputs.\n  To evaluate our methodology, we conducted a significant case study, and used\nit to design and implement the Connect4 game. By combining LLMs and SBP we were\nable to create a highly-capable agent, which could defeat various strong\nexisting agents. Further, in some cases, we were able to formally verify the\ncorrectness of our agent. Finally, our experience reveals interesting insights\nregarding the ease-of-use of our proposed approach.

Another way is to use a stochastic approach where a random force is\nadded to the system. The benefit of the stochastic approach is to solve the\ndynamics of the system with less time and memory than the density matrix\napproaches. In this project we want to develop a stochastic approach that can\ndeal with the stochastic wave functions approach.

The natural extension from\ngroups to group-valued time series is also discussed, as well as how such\nmetric tools can be applied in time series analysis.

To address these, we propose a lightweight and self-adaptive Image\nSignal Processing (ISP) plugin, Dark-ISP, which directly processes Bayer RAW\nimages in dark environments, enabling seamless end-to-end training for object\ndetection. Our key innovations are: (1) We deconstruct conventional ISP\npipelines into sequential linear (sensor calibration) and nonlinear (tone\nmapping) sub-modules, recasting them as differentiable components optimized\nthrough task-driven losses. Each module is equipped with content-aware\nadaptability and physics-informed priors, enabling automatic RAW-to-RGB\nconversion aligned with detection objectives. (2) By exploiting the ISP\npipeline's intrinsic cascade structure, we devise a Self-Boost mechanism that\nfacilitates cooperation between sub-modules. Through extensive experiments on\nthree RAW image datasets, we demonstrate that our method outperforms\nstate-of-the-art RGB- and RAW-based detection approaches, achieving superior\nresults with minimal parameters in challenging low-light environments.",

We examine two forms of incomplete information: incomplete\nobservation, in which donor actions are observed only probabilistically, and\nreputation fading, in which recipient reputations are sometimes classified as\n\"Unknown\". Using analytical frameworks for public assessment, we show that\nthese seemingly similar models yield qualitatively different outcomes. Under\nincomplete observation, the conditions for cooperation are unchanged, because\nless frequent updates are exactly offset by higher reputational stakes. In\ncontrast, reputation fading hinders cooperation, requiring higher\nbenefit-to-cost ratios as the identification probability decreases. We then\nevaluate costly punishment as a third action alongside cooperation and\ndefection. Norms incorporating punishment can sustain cooperation across\nbroader parameter ranges without reducing efficiency in the reputation fading\nmodel. This contrasts with previous work, which found punishment ineffective\nunder a different type of information limitation, and highlights the importance\nof distinguishing between types of information constraints.

However,\nconventional SFG based on far-field schemes suffers from the diffraction limit\nof light, which inherently averages spectroscopic information over\nmicrometer-scale regions and obscures nanoscale structural inhomogeneity. Here,\nwe overcome this fundamental limitation by leveraging a highly confined optical\nnear field within a tip-substrate nanogap of a scanning tunneling microscope\n(STM), pushing the spatial resolution of SFG down to ~10 nm, a nearly\ntwo-orders-of-magnitude improvement over conventional far-field SFG. By\ncapturing tip-enhanced SFG (TE-SFG) spectra concurrently with STM scanning, we\ndemonstrate the capability to resolve nanoscale variation in molecular\nadsorption structures across distinct interfacial domains. To rigorously\ninterpret the observed TE-SFG spectra, we newly developed a comprehensive\ntheoretical framework for the TE-SFG process and confirm via numerical\nsimulations that the TE-SFG response under our current experimental conditions\nis dominantly governed by the dipole-field interactions, with negligible\ncontributions from higher-order multipole effects. The dominance of the dipole\nmechanism ensures that the observed TE-SFG spectra faithfully reflect not only\nnanoscale interfacial structural features but also absolute up/down molecular\norientations. This study presents the first experimental realization of\ndiffraction-unlimited second-order nonlinear vibrational SFG nanoscopy, opening\na new avenue for nanoscale domain-specific investigation of molecular\nstructures and dynamics within inhomogeneous interfacial molecular systems\nbeyond the conventional far-field SFG and STM imaging.",

First-principles calculations\nreveal that hydrogenation induces a topological phase transition in\nCr$_{\\text{2}}$Ge$_{\\text{2}}$Te$_{\\text{6}}$ by shifting its Dirac\npoints-originally embedded in the conduction bands-to the vicinity of the Fermi\nlevel in Cr$_{\\text{2}}$Ge$_{\\text{2}}$Te$_{\\text{6}}$H$_{\\text{6}}$. This\nelectronic restructuring, coupled with spin-orbit coupling, opens a global\ntopological gap of 118.1 meV, establishing a robust QAH state with Chern number\n$C=$ 3. Concurrently, hydrogenation enhances ferromagnetic superexchange via\nthe $d_{z^{2}}$-$p_{z}$-$d_{xz}$ channel, significantly strengthening the\nnearest-neighbor coupling $J_{\\text{1}}$ by 3.06 times and switching\n$J_{\\text{2}}$ from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic.

To extend the applicability, we have\ninvestigated the traffic of six additional IoT devices and our analysis shows\nthat these devices can have similar vulnerabilities, due to the presence of a\nsimilar set of application protocols. We believe that IoTFuzzSentry has the\npotential to discover unconventional security threats and allow IoT vendors to\nstrengthen the security of their commercialized IoT devices automatically with\nnegligible overhead.",

    "abstract": "Object detection in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery presents\nsignificant challenges. Issues such as densely packed small objects, scale\nvariations, and occlusion are commonplace. This paper introduces RT-DETR++,\nwhich enhances the encoder component of the RT-DETR model. Our improvements\nfocus on two key aspects. First, we introduce a channel-gated attention-based\nupsampling/downsampling (AU/AD) mechanism. This dual-path system minimizes\nerrors and preserves details during feature layer propagation. Second, we\nincorporate CSP-PAC during feature fusion. This technique employs parallel\nhollow convolutions to process local and contextual information within the same\nlayer, facilitating the integration of multi-scale features. Evaluation\ndemonstrates that our novel neck design achieves superior performance in\ndetecting small and densely packed objects. The model maintains sufficient\nspeed for real-time detection without increasing computational complexity. This\nstudy provides an effective approach for feature encoding design in real-time\ndetection systems.",

In contrast, human spatial intelligence, rooted in\nintegrated multisensory perception, spatial memory, and cognitive maps, enables\nflexible, context-aware decision-making in unstructured environments.\nTherefore, bridging this gap is critical for advancing Agentic Spatial\nIntelligence toward better interaction with the physical 3D world. To this end,\nwe first start from scrutinizing the spatial neural models as studied in\ncomputational neuroscience, and accordingly introduce a novel computational\nframework grounded in neuroscience principles. This framework maps core\nbiological functions to six essential computation modules: bio-inspired\nmultimodal sensing, multi-sensory integration, egocentric-allocentric\nconversion, an artificial cognitive map, spatial memory, and spatial reasoning.\nTogether, these modules form a perspective landscape for agentic spatial\nreasoning capability across both virtual and physical environments. On top, we\nconduct a framework-guided analysis of recent methods, evaluating their\nrelevance to each module and identifying critical gaps that hinder the\ndevelopment of more neuroscience-grounded spatial reasoning modules. We further\nexamine emerging benchmarks and datasets and explore potential application\ndomains ranging from virtual to embodied systems, such as robotics. Finally, we\noutline potential research directions, emphasizing the promising roadmap that\ncan generalize spatial reasoning across dynamic or unstructured environments.\nWe hope this work will benefit the research community with a\nneuroscience-grounded perspective and a structured pathway.

Designed as a flexible backend, LITcoder provides\nstandardized tools for aligning continuous stimuli (e.g., text and speech) with\nbrain data, transforming stimuli into representational features, mapping those\nfeatures onto brain data, and evaluating the predictive performance of the\nresulting model on held-out data. The library implements a modular pipeline\ncovering a wide array of methodological design choices, so researchers can\neasily compose, compare, and extend encoding models without reinventing core\ninfrastructure. Such choices include brain datasets, brain regions, stimulus\nfeature (both neural-net-based and control, such as word rate), downsampling\napproaches, and many others. In addition, the library provides built-in\nlogging, plotting, and seamless integration with experiment tracking platforms\nsuch as Weights & Biases (W&B). We demonstrate the scalability and versatility\nof our framework by fitting a range of encoding models to three story listening\ndatasets: LeBel et al. (2023), Narratives, and Little Prince. We also explore\nthe methodological choices critical for building encoding models for continuous\nfMRI data, illustrating the importance of accounting for all tokens in a TR\nscan (as opposed to just taking the last one, even when contextualized),\nincorporating hemodynamic lag effects, using train-test splits that minimize\ninformation leakage, and accounting for head motion effects on encoding model\npredictivity. Overall, LITcoder lowers technical barriers to encoding model\nimplementation, facilitates systematic comparisons across models and datasets,\nfosters methodological rigor, and accelerates the development of high-quality\nhigh-performance predictive models of brain activity.\n  Project page: https://litcoder-brain.github.io",

To overcome this limitation, we propose\nSpatial Power Map Net (SPMnet), a learning-based sound field reproduction\nmethod that improves both sound quality and spatial localization in complex\nenvironments. We introduce a spatial power map (SPM) constraint, which\ncharacterizes the angular energy distribution of the reproduced field using\nbeamforming. This constraint guides energy toward the intended direction to\nenhance spatial localization, and is integrated into a multi-channel\nequalization framework to also improve sound quality under reverberant\nconditions. To address the resulting non-convexity, deep optimization that use\nneural networks to solve optimization problems is employed for filter design.\nBoth in situ objective and subjective evaluations confirm that our method\nenhances sound quality and improves spatial localization within the automotive\ncabin.

    "abstract": "Internet service providers (ISPs) need to connect with other ISPs to provide\nglobal connectivity services to their users. To ensure global connectivity,\nISPs can either use transit service(s) or establish direct peering\nrelationships between themselves via Internet exchange points (IXPs). Peering\noffers more room for ISP-specific optimizations and is preferred, but it often\ninvolves a lengthy and complex process. Automating peering partner selection\ncan enhance efficiency in the global Internet ecosystem. We explore the use of\npublicly available data on ISPs to develop a machine learning (ML) model that\ncan predict whether an ISP pair should peer or not. At first, we explore public\ndatabases, e.g., PeeringDB, CAIDA, etc., to gather data on ISPs. Then, we\nevaluate the performance of three broad types of ML models for predicting\npeering relationships: tree-based, neural network-based, and transformer-based.\nAmong these, we observe that tree-based models achieve the highest accuracy and\nefficiency in our experiments. The XGBoost model trained with publicly\navailable data showed promising performance, with a 98% accuracy rate in\npredicting peering partners. In addition, the model demonstrated great\nresilience to variations in time, space, and missing data. We envision that\nISPs can adopt our method to fully automate the peering partner selection\nprocess, thus transitioning to a more efficient and optimized Internet\necosystem.",

Its core, privacy-preserving principle is that participants\nonly exchange model updates, such as gradients, and never their raw, sensitive\ndata. This approach is fundamental for applications in domains where privacy\nand confidentiality are important. However, the security of this very mechanism\nis threatened by gradient inversion attacks, which can reverse-engineer private\ntraining data directly from the shared gradients, defeating the purpose of FL.\nWhile the impact of these attacks is known for image, text, and tabular data,\ntheir effect on video data remains an unexamined area of research. This paper\npresents the first analysis of video data leakage in FL using gradient\ninversion attacks. We evaluate two common video classification approaches: one\nemploying pre-trained feature extractors and another that processes raw video\nframes with simple transformations. Our initial results indicate that the use\nof feature extractors offers greater resilience against gradient inversion\nattacks. We also demonstrate that image super-resolution techniques can enhance\nthe frames extracted through gradient inversion attacks, enabling attackers to\nreconstruct higher-quality videos. Our experiments validate this across\nscenarios where the attacker has access to zero, one, or more reference frames\nfrom the target environment. We find that although feature extractors make\nattacks more challenging, leakage is still possible if the classifier lacks\nsufficient complexity.

Starting from a graph\ncontaining a macroscopic connected component, random pairs of nodes are\nsequentially selected, and, if the length of the shortest path connecting the\nnode pairs is smaller than a tunable budget parameter, then all edges along\nsuch a path are removed from the network. As edges are progressively removed,\nthe network eventually breaks into multiple microscopic components, undergoing\na percolation-like transition. It is known that SPP transition on\nErd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi (ER) graphs belongs to same universality class as of the\nordinary bond percolation if the budget parameter is finite; for unbounded\nbudget instead, the SPP transition becomes more abrupt than the ordinary\npercolation transition. By means of large-scale numerical simulations and\nfinite-size scaling analysis, here we study the SPP transition on random\nscale-free networks (SFNs) characterized by power-law degree distributions. We\nfind, in contrast with standard percolation, that the transition is identical\nto the one observed on ER graphs, denoting independence from the degree\nexponent.

    "abstract": "Nonlinear elliptic problems arise in many fields, including plasma physics,\nastrophysics, and optimal transport. In this article, we propose a novel\noperator-splitting/finite element method for solving such problems. We begin by\nintroducing an auxiliary function in a new way for a semilinear elliptic\npartial differential equation, leading to the development of a convergent\noperator-splitting/finite element scheme for this equation. The algorithm is\nthen extended to fully nonlinear elliptic equations of the Monge-Amp\\`ere type,\nincluding the Dirichlet Monge-Amp\\`ere equation and Pucci's equation. This is\nachieved by reformulating the fully nonlinear equations into forms analogous to\nthe semilinear case, enabling the application of the proposed splitting\nalgorithm. In our implementation, a mixed finite element method is used to\napproximate both the solution and its Hessian matrix. Numerical experiments\nshow that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches in efficiency and\naccuracy, and can be readily applied to problems defined on domains with curved\nboundaries.",

To overcome\ndata scarcity and efficiency limitations, we propose ALL-PET, a low-resource,\nlow-shot PET foundation model operating directly in the projection domain.\nALL-PET leverages a latent diffusion model (LDM) with three key innovations.\nFirst, we design a Radon mask augmentation strategy (RMAS) that generates over\n200,000 structurally diverse training samples by projecting randomized\nimage-domain masks into sinogram space, significantly improving generalization\nwith minimal data. This is extended by a dynamic multi-mask (DMM) mechanism\nthat varies mask quantity and distribution, enhancing data diversity without\nadded model complexity. Second, we implement positive/negative mask constraints\nto embed strict geometric consistency, reducing parameter burden while\npreserving generation quality. Third, we introduce transparent medical\nattention (TMA), a parameter-free, geometry-driven mechanism that enhances\nlesion-related regions in raw projection data. Lesion-focused attention maps\nare derived from coarse segmentation, covering both hypermetabolic and\nhypometabolic areas, and projected into sinogram space for physically\nconsistent guidance. The system supports clinician-defined ROI adjustments,\nensuring flexible, interpretable, and task-adaptive emphasis aligned with PET\nacquisition physics. Experimental results show ALL-PET achieves high-quality\nsinogram generation using only 500 samples, with performance comparable to\nmodels trained on larger datasets.

This yields\nWebPerson, a large-scale dataset of 5M high-quality person-centric image-text\npairs. Second, we introduce the GA-DMS (Gradient-Attention Guided Dual-Masking\nSynergetic) framework, which improves cross-modal alignment by adaptively\nmasking noisy textual tokens based on the gradient-attention similarity score.\nAdditionally, we incorporate masked token prediction objectives that compel the\nmodel to predict informative text tokens, enhancing fine-grained semantic\nrepresentation learning. Extensive experiments show that GA-DMS achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.",

    "abstract": "We theoretically study the dynamics of gain-driven magnon-polaritons (MPs),\nwhich characterizes auto-oscillation of MPs, across the strong coupling (SC)\nand ultrastrong coupling (USC) regimes. Taking into account the magnon dynamics\nvia the magnetic flux, we present an effective circuit model of gain-driven\nMPs, which allows to manipulate the coupling strength of MPs by tuning the size\nof a ferromagnet and incorporates the self-Kerr nonlinearity of magnons due to\nthe shape magnetic anisotropy. In the SC regime, we find that the self-Kerr\nnonlinearity generates a frequency shift and reduces the coherent magnon-photon\ncoupling. In contrast, in the USC regime, we find that the coherent\nmagnon-photon coupling not only overcomes the self-Kerr nonlinearity but also\neffectively couples to gain via the imaginary part of complex eigenfrequencies,\nresulting in magnon-like auto-oscillations. Subsequently, the USC enables one\nto widely tune the auto-oscillation frequency by means of an external magnetic\nfield. These findings indicate that there is a trade-off relation between the\ncoupling strength of MPs and the self-Kerr nonlinearity of magnons. This work\nis attributed to understanding of the interplay between gain-loss and USC in\nnonlinear polariton dynamics, offering a novel principle for frequency tunable\nmaser-like devices based on gain-driven MPs.",

However, most existing methods\nrely on either static fusion strategies or graph-based local interaction\nmodeling, facing two critical limitations: (1) insufficient ability to model\nfine-grained cross-modal associations, leading to suboptimal fusion quality;\nand (2) a lack of global distribution-level consistency, causing\nrepresentational bias. To address these, we propose MambaRec, a novel framework\nthat integrates local feature alignment and global distribution regularization\nvia attention-guided learning. At its core, we introduce the Dilated Refinement\nAttention Module (DREAM), which uses multi-scale dilated convolutions with\nchannel-wise and spatial attention to align fine-grained semantic patterns\nbetween visual and textual modalities. This module captures hierarchical\nrelationships and context-aware associations, improving cross-modal semantic\nmodeling. Additionally, we apply Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) and contrastive\nloss functions to constrain global modality alignment, enhancing semantic\nconsistency. This dual regularization reduces mode-specific deviations and\nboosts robustness. To improve scalability, MambaRec employs a dimensionality\nreduction strategy to lower the computational cost of high-dimensional\nmultimodal features.

While prior studies evaluate robustness using watermark removal\nattacks, these methods are often suboptimal, creating the misconception that\neffective removal requires large perturbations or powerful adversaries.\n  To bridge the gap, we first formalize the system model for LLM watermark, and\ncharacterize two realistic threat models constrained on limited access to the\nwatermark detector. We then analyze how different types of perturbation vary in\ntheir attack range, i.e., the number of tokens they can affect with a single\nedit. We observe that character-level perturbations (e.g., typos, swaps,\ndeletions, homoglyphs) can influence multiple tokens simultaneously by\ndisrupting the tokenization process. We demonstrate that character-level\nperturbations are significantly more effective for watermark removal under the\nmost restrictive threat model. We further propose guided removal attacks based\non the Genetic Algorithm (GA) that uses a reference detector for optimization.\nUnder a practical threat model with limited black-box queries to the watermark\ndetector, our method demonstrates strong removal performance. Experiments\nconfirm the superiority of character-level perturbations and the effectiveness\nof the GA in removing watermarks under realistic constraints. Additionally, we\nargue there is an adversarial dilemma when considering potential defenses: any\nfixed defense can be bypassed by a suitable perturbation strategy. Motivated by\nthis principle, we propose an adaptive compound character-level attack.\nExperimental results show that this approach can effectively defeat the\ndefenses.

    "abstract": "We numerically investigate the propulsive dynamics of a heaving flexible foil\nimmersed in the wake of a stationary circular cylinder, focusing on the coupled\neffects of unsteady wake forcing, passive structural flexibility, and\nprescribed heaving kinematics. The analysis employs a high-fidelity\nfluid-structure interaction solver based on a partitioned variational\nformulation with a nonlinear iterative force correction scheme. Systematic\nsimulations are conducted over a broad parameter space of dimensionless heaving\namplitude and frequency at a Reynolds number of 3000. Five distinct response\nmodes are identified, namely full-wake, semi-wake, full-wake-flexible,\nsemi-wake-flexible, and vortex-flexible, based on propulsive transitions and\nassociated flow features. An empirical boundary plane is discovered, separating\nregimes where the wake hinders lift performance (wake-dominated) from those\nwhere it enhances performance (flapping-dominated). Scaling relations for the\nforce and power coefficients are formulated by decomposing the contributions of\nquasi-steady motion, added-mass effects, structural curvature, wake momentum\ndeficit, and transverse flow gradients. At sufficiently large amplitude and\nfrequency, a two-way lock-in emerges: the foil not only synchronizes with the\ncylinder shedding but also modulates it, accelerating the wake and enhancing\nlift.Flexibility is found to be detrimental in fully immersed wakes but\nbeneficial in partial wakes, where it creates extra suction without much extra\ndrag in the semi-wake-flexible mode. These findings elucidate the energy-saving\nand maneuverability strategies employed by biological propulsors and provide\npredictive guidelines for the design of bio-inspired energy harvesters and\nunmanned vehicles in disturbed flows.",

We examine how the sender's expected utility varies with\nincreased communication among receivers. We show that for general families of\nnetworks, extending the network can strictly benefit the sender. Thus, the\nsender's gain from persuasion is not monotonic in network density. Moreover,\nmany network extensions can achieve the upper bound on the sender's expected\nutility among all networks, which corresponds to the payoff in an empty\nnetwork. This is the case in networks reflecting a clear informational\nhierarchy (e.g., in global corporations), as well as in decentralized networks\nin which information originates from multiple sources (e.g., influencers in\nsocial media).

Using data\nfrom A-share listed companies from 2010 to 2022, we construct a firm-level\ndigitalization index based on text analysis of annual reports and differentiate\nfinancial asset allocation into long-term and short-term dimensions. Employing\nfixed-effects models and a staggered difference-in-differences (DID) design, we\nfind that digital transformation significantly promotes corporate financial\nasset allocation, with a more pronounced effect on short-term than long-term\nallocations. Mechanism analyses reveal that digitalization operates through\ndual channels: broadening investment avenues and enhancing information\nprocessing capabilities. Specifically, it enables firms to allocate long-term\nhigh-yield financial instruments, thereby optimizing the maturity structure of\nassets, while also improving information efficiency, curbing inefficient\ninvestments, and reallocating capital toward more productive financial assets.\nHeterogeneity analysis indicates that firms in non-eastern regions, state-owned\nenterprises, and larger firms are more responsive in short-term allocation,\nwhereas eastern regions, non-state-owned enterprises, and small and\nmedium-sized enterprises benefit more in long-term allocation.

    "abstract": "As multicore systems continue to scale, cache coherence has emerged as a\ncritical determinant of system performance, with coherence behavior and task\nexecution closely intertwined, reshaping inter-task dependencies. Task graph\nmodeling provides a structured way to capture such dependencies and serves as\nthe foundation for many system-level design strategies. However, these\nstrategies typically rely on predefined task graphs, while many real-world\napplications lack explicit graphs and exhibit dynamic, data-dependent behavior,\nlimiting the effectiveness of static approaches. To address this, several task\ngraph modeling methods for realistic workloads have been developed. Yet, they\neither rely on implicit techniques that use application-specific features\nwithout producing explicit graphs, or they generate graphs tailored to fixed\nscheduling models, which limits generality. More importantly, they often\noverlook coherence interactions, creating a gap between design assumptions and\nactual runtime behavior. To overcome these limitations, we propose CoTAM, a\nCoherence-Aware Task Graph Modeling framework for realistic workloads that\nconstructs a unified task graph reflecting runtime behavior. CoTAM analyzes the\nimpact of coherence by decoupling its effects from overall execution,\nquantifies its influence through a learned weighting scheme, and infers\ninter-task dependencies for coherence-aware graph generation. Extensive\nexperiments show that CoTAM outperforms implicit methods, bridging the gap\nbetween dynamic workload behavior and existing designs while demonstrating the\nimportance of incorporating cache coherence into task graph modeling for\naccurate and generalizable system-level analysis.",

In this paper, we present\nClusterTag, a novel cluster-based memory allocator aimed at simultaneously\nmitigating tag collisions in both temporal and spatial dimensions. The core\ndesign of ClusterTag effectively balances the significant mismatch between tag\nencoding space and memory objects: it divides memory objects into multiple\nindependent clusters, thereby limiting tag collisions to finite chunks within\neach cluster. To mitigate tag collisions across clusters, we design a\ncluster-grained heap randomization scheme. This approach introduces random\naddress intervals between clusters and further breaks the entropy limitation of\nthe tag space. ClusterTag has been implemented as an independent memory\nallocator that seamlessly integrates with tag-based sanitizers such as HWASan,\nand maintains comparable performance overhead (within 1%) at various\nrandomization densities. Security evaluations on the Juliet dataset indicate\nthat ClusterTag exhibits deterministic results across 500 repeated tests (5,652\nreported and 1,530 missed), while the existing three types of tag assignment\nstrategies all exhibit probabilistic false negatives due to tag collisions.\nQuantitative analysis across three tag collision distance metrics-minimum,\naverage, and unpredictability-demonstrates that ClusterTag achieves balanced\nimprovements across all three, whereas prior tag assignment schemes (random,\nstaggered, fixed) show significant trade-offs in at least one metric.",

The proposed method adaptively enhances salient\nstructures by fusing object-aware complementary cross-modal features while\nsuppressing shared background interference.Our solution centers on two novel,\nspecially designed modules: the Mutual Feature Refinement Module (MFRM) and the\nDifferential Feature Feedback Module (DFFM). The MFRM enhances intra- and\ninter-modal feature representations by modeling their relationships, thereby\nimproving cross-modal alignment and discriminative power.Inspired by feedback\ndifferential amplifiers, the DFFM dynamically computes inter-modal differential\nfeatures as guidance signals and feeds them back to the MFRM, enabling adaptive\nfusion of complementary information while suppressing common-mode noise across\nmodalities. To enable robust feature learning, the MFRM and DFFM are integrated\ninto a unified framework, which is formally formulated as an Iterative\nRelation-Map Differential Guided Feature Fusion mechanism, termed IRDFusion.\nIRDFusion enables high-quality cross-modal fusion by progressively amplifying\nsalient relational signals through iterative feedback, while suppressing\nfeature noise, leading to significant performance gains.In extensive\nexperiments on FLIR, LLVIP and M$^3$FD datasets, IRDFusion achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance and consistently outperforms existing methods\nacross diverse challenging scenarios, demonstrating its robustness and\neffectiveness.

Once reserved\nfor a few well-resourced nation-state actors, the ability to interfere with\ntraffic at scale is now within reach of nearly any network operator. Despite\nthis proliferation, our understanding of DPIs and their deployments on the\nInternet remains limited -- being network intermediary leaves DPI unresponsive\nto conventional host-based scanning tools, and DPI vendors actively obscuring\ntheir products further complicates measurement efforts.\n  In this work, we present a remote measurement framework, dMAP (DPI Mapper),\nthat derives behavioral fingerprints for DPIs to differentiate and cluster\nthese otherwise indistinguishable middleboxes at scale, as a first step toward\nactive reconnaissance of DPIs on the Internet. Our key insight is that parsing\nand interpreting traffic as network intermediaries inherently involves\nambiguities -- from under-specified protocol behaviors to differing RFC\ninterpretations -- forcing DPI vendors into independent implementation choices\nthat create measurable variance among DPIs. Based on differential fuzzing, dMAP\nsystematically discovers, selects, and deploys specialized probes that\ntranslate DPI internal parsing behaviors into externally observable\nfingerprints. Applying dMAP to DPI deployments globally, we demonstrate its\npractical feasibility, showing that even a modest set of 20-40 discriminative\nprobes reliably differentiates a wide range of DPI implementations, including\nmajor nation-state censorship infrastructures and commercial DPI products.

We present\nKoopMotion which represents motion flow fields as dynamical systems,\nparameterized by Koopman Operators to mimic desired trajectories, and leverages\nthe divergence properties of the learnt flow fields to obtain smooth motion\nfields that converge to a desired reference trajectory when a robot is placed\naway from the desired trajectory, and tracks the trajectory until the end\npoint. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we show evaluations of\nKoopMotion on the LASA human handwriting dataset and a 3D manipulator\nend-effector trajectory dataset, including spectral analysis. We also perform\nexperiments on a physical robot, verifying KoopMotion on a miniature autonomous\nsurface vehicle operating in a non-static fluid flow environment. Our approach\nis highly sample efficient in both space and time, requiring only 3\\% of the\nLASA dataset to generate dense motion plans. Additionally, KoopMotion provides\na significant improvement over baselines when comparing metrics that measure\nspatial and temporal dynamics modeling efficacy.",

As this pattern progresses, it becomes critical\nto evaluate not only these agents' performance but also the processes through\nwhich they negotiate in dynamic, multi-agent environments. Furthermore,\ndifferent agents exhibit distinct advantages: traditional statistical agents,\nsuch as Bayesian models, may excel under well-specified conditions, whereas\nlarge language models (LLMs) can generalize across contexts. In this work, we\ncompare humans (N = 216), LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro), and Bayesian agents in\na dynamic negotiation setting that enables direct, identical-condition\ncomparisons across populations, capturing both outcomes and behavioral\ndynamics.

We present\nSTRIDE, a scalable framework that aims to mitigate both issues by framing\nexplanation as a subset-enumeration-free, orthogonal functional decomposition\nin a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). Rather than focusing only on\nscalar attributions, STRIDE computes functional components f_S(x_S) via an\nanalytical projection scheme based on a recursive kernel-centering procedure,\navoiding explicit subset enumeration. In the tabular setups we study, the\napproach is model-agnostic, provides both local and global views, and is\nsupported by theoretical results on orthogonality and L^2 convergence under\nstated assumptions. On public tabular benchmarks in our environment, we\nobserved speedups ranging from 0.6 times (slower than TreeSHAP on a small\ndataset) to 9.7 times (California), with a median approximate 3.0 times across\n10 datasets, while maintaining high fidelity (R^2 between 0.81 and 0.999) and\nsubstantial rank agreement on most datasets.

Previous observational studies used the currently-observed global\ngas-phase metallicity of host galaxies, instead of $Z_{progenitor}$ used in the\nmodel, and showed a higher scatter in the $^{56}$Ni mass measurements compared\nto the model prediction. Here, we use $Z_{progenitor}$ of 34 normal SNe Ia and\nemploy recent SN Ia explosion models with various configurations to cover the\nobserved $^{56}$Ni mass range. Unlike previous studies, our sample covers the\n$Z_{progenitor}$ range, where most of the $Z_{progenitor}$ effect occurs.\nLinear regression returns a slope of 0.02+-0.03, which is the opposite trend to\nthe analytical model, but at at low statistical significance level. We find\nthat comparing our sample with SN Ia explosion models on the\n$Z_{progenitor}$--$^{56}$Ni mass diagram allows us to constrain the progenitor\nscenarios. We also explore other chemical composition indicators. For\n$(Fe/H)_{progenitor}$, our sample follows the trend predicted by the analytical\nmodels, but at a low significance level. Noticeably, $(\\alpha/Fe)_{progenitor}$\nshows the opposite trend and a clear gap. When we split the sample at\n$(\\alpha/Fe)_{progenitor}$ = 0.35 $(\\alpha/Fe)_{\\odot}$, we find a 3$\\sigma$\ndifference in the weighted-means of the $^{56}$Ni mass. Lastly, SNe Ia in\ndifferent $Z_{progenitor}$ groups show a difference of 0.14+-0.09 mag in the\nstandardized luminosity.
