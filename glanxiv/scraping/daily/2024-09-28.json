    "abstract": "Effective patient care in digital healthcare requires large language models\n(LLMs) that not only answer questions but also actively gather critical\ninformation through well-crafted inquiries. This paper introduces HealthQ, a\nnovel framework for evaluating the questioning capabilities of LLM healthcare\nchains. By implementing advanced LLM chains, including Retrieval-Augmented\nGeneration (RAG), Chain of Thought (CoT), and reflective chains, HealthQ\nassesses how effectively these chains elicit comprehensive and relevant patient\ninformation. To achieve this, we integrate an LLM judge to evaluate generated\nquestions across metrics such as specificity, relevance, and usefulness, while\naligning these evaluations with traditional Natural Language Processing (NLP)\nmetrics like ROUGE and Named Entity Recognition (NER)-based set comparisons. We\nvalidate HealthQ using two custom datasets constructed from public medical\ndatasets, ChatDoctor and MTS-Dialog, and demonstrate its robustness across\nmultiple LLM judge models, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Claude. Our\ncontributions are threefold: we present the first systematic framework for\nassessing questioning capabilities in healthcare conversations, establish a\nmodel-agnostic evaluation methodology, and provide empirical evidence linking\nhigh-quality questions to improved patient information elicitation.",

    "abstract": "The safety of train operations is largely dependent on the health of rail\ntracks, necessitating regular and meticulous inspection and maintenance. A\nsignificant part of such inspections involves geometric measurements of the\ntracks to detect any potential problems. Traditional methods for track geometry\nmeasurements, while proven to be accurate, require track closures during\ninspections, and consume a considerable amount of time as the inspection area\ngrows, causing significant disruptions to regular operations. To address this\nchallenge, this paper proposes a track geometry measurement system (TGMS) that\nutilizes an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platform equipped with a light\ndetection and ranging (LiDAR) sensor. Integrated with a state-of-the-art\nmachine-learning-based computer vision algorithm, and a simultaneous\nlocalization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm, this platform can conduct rail\ngeometry inspections seamlessly over a larger area without interrupting rail\noperations. In particular, this semi- or fully automated measurement is found\ncapable of measuring critical rail geometry irregularities in gauge, curvature,\nand profile with sub-inch accuracy. Cross-level and warp are not measured due\nto the absence of gravity data. By eliminating operational interruptions, our\nsystem offers a more streamlined, cost-effective, and safer solution for\ninspecting and maintaining rail infrastructure.",

Analogously to the previously known $d=3$ case, we prove that\nfor CFTs in $d=5$ which are holographically dual to Einstein gravity, $F(A)$ is\nequal to a four-dimensional version of the ``Willmore energy'' associated to a\ndoubled and closed version of the Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) surface of $A$ embedded\nin $\\mathbb{R}^5$. This generalized Willmore energy is shown to arise from a\nconformal-invariant codimension-two functional obtained by evaluating\nsix-dimensional Conformal Gravity on the conically-singular orbifold of the\nreplica trick. The new functional involves an integral over the doubled RT\nsurface of a linear combination of three quartic terms in extrinsic curvatures\nand is free from ultraviolet divergences by construction. We verify explicitly\nthe validity of our new formula for various entangling regions and argue that,\nas opposed to the $d=3$ case, $F(A)$ is not globally minimized by a round ball\n$A=\\mathbb{B}^4$. Rather, $F(A)$ can take arbitrarily positive and negative\nvalues as a function of $A$. Hence, we conclude that the round ball is not a\nglobal minimizer of $F(A)$ for general five-dimensional CFTs.",

While significant advancements have been made in deep\nlearning-based segmentation techniques, many of these methods still suffer from\nlimitations in data efficiency, generalizability, and interactivity. As a\nresult, developing precise segmentation methods that require fewer labeled\ndatasets remains a critical challenge in medical image analysis. Recently, the\nintroduction of foundation models like CLIP and Segment-Anything-Model (SAM),\nwith robust cross-domain representations, has paved the way for interactive and\nuniversal image segmentation. However, further exploration of these models for\ndata-efficient segmentation in medical imaging is still needed and highly\nrelevant. In this paper, we introduce MedCLIP-SAMv2, a novel framework that\nintegrates the CLIP and SAM models to perform segmentation on clinical scans\nusing text prompts, in both zero-shot and weakly supervised settings. Our\napproach includes fine-tuning the BiomedCLIP model with a new Decoupled Hard\nNegative Noise Contrastive Estimation (DHN-NCE) loss, and leveraging the\nMulti-modal Information Bottleneck (M2IB) to create visual prompts for\ngenerating segmentation masks from SAM in the zero-shot setting. We also\ninvestigate using zero-shot segmentation labels within a weakly supervised\nparadigm to enhance segmentation quality further. Extensive testing across four\ndiverse segmentation tasks and medical imaging modalities (breast tumor\nultrasound, brain tumor MRI, lung X-ray, and lung CT) demonstrates the high\naccuracy of our proposed framework.

This thesis explores the development of data-driven\ntechniques for spatial reasoning and planning tasks, focusing on enhancing\nlearning efficiency, interpretability, and transferability across novel\nscenarios. Four key contributions are made. 1) CALVIN, a differential planner\nthat learns interpretable models of the world for long-term planning.

Options segment a task into subtasks and enable\nconsistent execution of the subtask. SOAP showed robust performances on\nhistory-conditional corridor tasks as well as classical benchmarks such as\nAtari. 3) LangProp, a code optimisation framework using LLMs to solve embodied\nagent problems that require reasoning by treating code as learnable policies.\nThe framework successfully generated interpretable code with comparable or\nsuperior performance to human-written experts in the CARLA autonomous driving\nbenchmark. 4) Voggite, an embodied agent with a vision-to-action transformer\nbackend that solves complex tasks in Minecraft.

For using these models, usually fine-tuning is done for\nmodel alignment on the desired tasks, which can make model more aligned but\nalso make it more susceptible to produce unsafe responses, if fine-tuned with\nharmful data.In this paper, we study how much of impact introduction of harmful\ndata in fine-tuning can make, and if it can override the safety protection of\nthose models. Conversely,it was also explored that if model is fine-tuned on\nsafety data can make the model produce more safer responses. Further we explore\nif fine-tuning the model on harmful data makes it less helpful or less\ntrustworthy because of increase in model uncertainty leading to knowledge\ndrift. Our extensive experimental results shown that Safety protection in an\nopen-source can be overridden, when fine-tuned with harmful data as observed by\nASR increasing by 35% when compared to basemodel's ASR. Also, as observed,\nfine-tuning a model with harmful data made the harmful fine-tuned model highly\nuncertain with huge knowledge drift and less truthfulness in its responses.\nFurthermore, for the safe fine-tuned model, ASR decreases by 51.68% as compared\nto the basemodel, and Safe model also shown in minor drop in uncertainty and\ntruthfulness as compared to basemodel.

    "abstract": "Accurate and robust stock trend forecasting has been a crucial and\nchallenging task, as stock price changes are influenced by multiple factors.\nGraph neural network-based methods have recently achieved remarkable success in\nthis domain by constructing stock relationship graphs that reflect internal\nfactors and relationships between stocks. However, most of these methods rely\non predefined factors to construct static stock relationship graphs due to the\nlack of suitable datasets, failing to capture the dynamic changes in stock\nrelationships. Moreover, the evaluation of relationship graphs in these methods\nis often tied to the performance of neural network models on downstream tasks,\nleading to confusion and imprecision. To address these issues, we introduce the\nSPNews dataset, collected based on S\\&P 500 Index stocks, to facilitate the\nconstruction of dynamic relationship graphs. Furthermore, we propose a novel\nset of financial relationship graph evaluation methods that are independent of\ndownstream tasks. By using the relationship graph to explain historical\nfinancial phenomena, we assess its validity before constructing a graph neural\nnetwork, ensuring the graph's effectiveness in capturing relevant financial\nrelationships. Experimental results demonstrate that our evaluation methods can\neffectively differentiate between various financial relationship graphs,\nyielding more interpretable results compared to traditional approaches. We make\nour source code publicly available on GitHub to promote reproducibility and\nfurther research in this area.",

    "abstract": "Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have peaked interest in recent years\ndue to their ability to encode natural signals using neural networks. While\nINRs allow for useful applications such as interpolating new coordinates and\nsignal compression, their black-box nature makes it difficult to modify them\npost-training. In this paper we explore the idea of editable INRs, and\nspecifically focus on the widely used cropping operation. To this end, we\npresent Local-Global SIRENs -- a novel INR architecture that supports cropping\nby design. Local-Global SIRENs are based on combining local and global feature\nextraction for signal encoding. What makes their design unique is the ability\nto effortlessly remove specific portions of an encoded signal, with a\nproportional weight decrease. This is achieved by eliminating the corresponding\nweights from the network, without the need for retraining. We further show how\nthis architecture can be used to support the straightforward extension of\npreviously encoded signals. Beyond signal editing, we examine how the\nLocal-Global approach can accelerate training, enhance encoding of various\nsignals, improve downstream performance, and be applied to modern INRs such as\nINCODE, highlighting its potential and flexibility.

To address this\nchallenge, we present three key insights, equivalence voting, constrained\ndecoding, and domain-specific fine-tuning, which significantly enhance LLM\nplanners' capability in handling complex tasks. Equivalence voting ensures\nconsistency by generating and sampling multiple Linear Temporal Logic (LTL)\nformulas from NL commands, grouping equivalent LTL formulas, and selecting the\nmajority group of formulas as the final LTL formula. Constrained decoding then\nuses the generated LTL formula to enforce the autoregressive inference of\nplans, ensuring the generated plans conform to the LTL. Domain-specific\nfine-tuning customizes LLMs to produce safe and efficient plans within specific\ntask domains. Our approach, Safe Efficient LLM Planner (SELP), combines these\ninsights to create LLM planners to generate plans adhering to user commands\nwith high confidence. We demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of\nSELP across different robot agents and tasks, including drone navigation and\nrobot manipulation. For drone navigation tasks, SELP outperforms\nstate-of-the-art planners by 10.8% in safety rate (i.e., finishing tasks\nconforming to NL commands) and by 19.8% in plan efficiency. For robot\nmanipulation tasks, SELP achieves 20.4% improvement in safety rate. Our\ndatasets for evaluating NL-to-LTL and robot task planning will be released in\ngithub.com/lt-asset/selp.",

We show that, for a range of layers\nof VGG-type networks, the learned eigenvectors appear to be universal across\ndifferent natural image datasets. Our results suggest the existence of a\nuniversal neural encoding for natural images. They explain, at a more\nfundamental level, the success of transfer learning. Our work shows that,\ninstead of aiming at maximizing the performance of neural networks, one can\nalternatively attempt to maximize the universality of the learned encoding, in\norder to build a principled foundation model.",

    "abstract": "We study the problem of fine-tuning a language model (LM) for a target task\nby optimally using the information from $n$ auxiliary tasks. This problem has\nbroad applications in NLP, such as targeted instruction tuning and data\nselection in chain-of-thought fine-tuning. The key challenge of this problem is\nthat not all auxiliary tasks are beneficial in improving the performance of the\ntarget task. Thus, selecting the right subset of auxiliary tasks is crucial.\nConventional subset selection methods, such as forward and backward stepwise\nselection, are unsuitable for LM fine-tuning because they require repeated\ntraining on subsets of auxiliary tasks. This paper introduces a new algorithm\nfor estimating model fine-tuning performance without requiring repeated\ntraining. Our algorithm first performs multitask training using data from all\ntasks to obtain a meta initialization. Then, we approximate the model\nfine-tuning loss of a subset using functional values and gradients from the\nmeta initialization. Empirically, we find that this gradient-based\napproximation holds with remarkable accuracy for twelve transformer-based LMs.\nThus, we can now estimate fine-tuning performances on CPUs within a few\nseconds. Finally, we fine-tune the pretrained base model once on the selected\nsubset of tasks. We conduct extensive experiments to validate this approach,\ndelivering a speedup of $30\\times$ over conventional subset selection while\nincurring only $1\\%$ error of the true fine-tuning performances. In downstream\nevaluations involving both instruction tuning and chain-of-thought fine-tuning,\nthis loss-based selection approach improves over prior gradient or\nrepresentation similarity-based methods for subset selection by up to $3.8\\%$.",

While recent approaches utilizing\nMultimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown promising results, their\nextensive computation and data demands limit the feasibility of local\ndeployment and customization. To address this, we propose a novel CLIP-based\nmultimodal parameter-efficient tuning (PET) framework designed for three\nlanguage-guided object grounding and grasping tasks: (1) Referring Expression\nSegmentation (RES), (2) Referring Grasp Synthesis (RGS), and (3) Referring\nGrasp Affordance (RGA).

Experiment results\ndemonstrate superior performance in the RES object grounding task compared with\nexisting CLIP-based full-model tuning or PET approaches. In the RGS and RGA\ntasks, our model not only effectively interprets object attributes based on\nsimple language descriptions but also shows strong potential for comprehending\ncomplex spatial reasoning scenarios, such as multiple identical objects present\nin the workspace.

With this paper, we provide\nextensive simulated human mobility datasets featuring various anomaly types\ncreated using an existing Urban Patterns of Life Simulation. To create these\ndatasets, we inject changes in the logic of individual agents to change their\nbehavior. Specifically, we create four of anomalous agent behavior by (1)\nchanging the agents' appetite (causing agents to have meals more frequently),\n(2) changing their group of interest (causing agents to interact with different\nagents from another group). (3) changing their social place selection (causing\nagents to visit different recreational places) and (4) changing their work\nschedule (causing agents to skip work), For each type of anomaly, we use three\ndegrees of behavioral change to tune the difficulty of detecting the anomalous\nagents. To select agents to inject anomalous behavior into, we employ three\nmethods: (1) Random selection using a centralized manipulation mechanism, (2)\nSpread based selection using an infectious disease model, and (3) through\nexposure of agents to a specific location. All datasets are split into normal\nand anomalous phases. The normal phase, which can be used for training models\nof normalcy, exhibits no anomalous behavior.

The vector coupling parameters within the\nkaonic sector are determined through the iso-spin counting rule and quark\nmodel. Our study integrates various constraints, including $\\chi$EFT\ncalculations, nuclear saturation properties, and astrophysical observations\nfrom pulsars PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0740+66 and from the GW170817 event. We\npresent posterior distributions of model parameters derived from these\nconstraints, enabling us to explore the distributions of nuclear matter\nproperties and neutron star (NS) characteristics such as radii, tidal\ndeformabilities, central energy densities, and speed of sound. The antikaon\npotential at the 68(90)\\% confidence intervals is determined to be\n$-129.36^{+12.53(+32.617)}_{-3.837(-5.696)}$ MeV. This aligns with several\nstudies providing estimates within the range of $-120$ to $-150$ MeV. We find\nthat the maximum neutron star mass is constrained to around 2M$_\\odot$ due to\nthe significant softening of the EOS caused by antikaon condensation. This\nsoftening results in a considerable decrease in the speed of sound. Although\nantikaon condensation for $K^-$ is not feasible inside the canonical neutron\nstars, it becomes feasible for higher NS masses. The condensation of both $K^-$\nand $\\bar{K}^0$ is probably present in the interior of neutron star with mass\ngreater than 2M$_\\odot$.

    "abstract": "The LK-99 hype came and went but the great potential of the apatite class of\nmaterials as platform for flat bands research must not be swept away in the\nprocess. A heuristic reinterpretation of the atomic structure of LK-99 is\noffered, including electronic signatures from the fully oxidized to the fully\nreduced. Here, copper is proposed to reside in the apatite channel rather than\ndoping the Lead sublattice. Contact is made with the experimental x-ray powder\ndiffractogram. The electronic signatures are found to reflect those of local\n[O-Cu-O] and [O-Cu-Vo**] molecular ions, where Vo** is a 2+ charged vacant\noxygen site in the apatite channel. The local nature warrants flat bands.\nCharge carrier concentration is controlled by the oxygen content. Fully reduced\nLK-99 is a wide band gap insulator with a well-developed intermediate band.\nFully oxidized LK-99 is a magnetic insulator, while the partially reduced LK-99\nallows for hopping of holes between anti bonding pi orbitals of non-magnetic\nand magnetic [O-Cu-O] moieties. The findings are extended to include the case\nwhere half of the Cu atoms are replaced by Ni and half by Zn. For [O-Ni-O]\n+[O-Zn-Vo**] inter-site accidental near degeneracy among states at EF is\nreported, while for [O-Zn-O] + [O-Ni-Vo**] the near-degeneracy at EF on hole\ndoping is among intra-site valence states exclusively on [O-Ni-Vo**]. The\napatite platform is ideal for the study of flat bands associated phenomena. The\nreinterpreted fully reduced LK-99 system invites intrinsic intermediate band\nsolar cells applications. Sites with variable oxygen occupation allow for holes\ndoping, the consequences of which include strong correlations between electrons\nand lattice that suggest the emergence of (rebuilt) phonons mediated intra- as\nwell as inter- bands (virtual) electron transfer-based phenomena, feeding the\nquest for ambient conditions superconductivity.",

A small number of pulsar glitches have been identified as\nanti-glitches or spin-down glitches, where the overall contribution to the\npulsar's rotation frequency is negative.

This work aims to search for PSR 1522-5735's glitches using Fermi-LAT\ndata from over 15 years of observations. Methods. The weighted H-test statistic\nwas applied to identify glitches and evaluate the related changes in pulsar's\nspin parameters. The timing solution based on these results was further refined\nby maximization of the unbinned likelihood. The Bayesian information criterion\nwas used to set an appropriate number of parameters in the timing solution to\navoid overfitting. Results. The analysis revealed eight glitch events: regular\nspin-up glitch, spin-up glitch over-recovered to a spin-down and six\nanti-glitches. These events were radiatively quiet, exhibiting no significant\nvariations in the shape of the pulse profile or energy flux. Conclusions. The\nresults may suggest that an internal mechanism is responsible for spin-down\nglitch phenomena.",

Unlike the Vertex and Voronoi models, our\nmodel shows that reducing intercellular adhesion in near-confluent tissues\nleads to spontaneous neighbor exchanges and fluidization. Near the liquid-solid\nphase boundary, we also found glassy behavior characterized by subdiffusive\ndynamics, swirling cell motion, and non-Gaussian exponential tails in\ndisplacement distributions. These exponential tails collapse onto a single\nmaster curve, suggesting a universal 'diffusion length' in the glassy regime.\nNotably, we demonstrate that structural parameters based on cell shape cannot\nalways distinguish tissue phases due to huge cell shape fluctuations that are\nnot observed in Vertex and Voronoi models.

    "abstract": "Finding an optimal energy-efficient policy that is adaptable to underlying\nedge devices while meeting deadlines for tasks has always been challenging.\nThis research studies generalized systems with multi-task, multi-deadline\nscenarios with reinforcement learning-based DVFS for energy saving for periodic\nsoft real-time applications on edge devices. This work addresses the limitation\nof previous work that models a periodic system as a single task and\nsingle-deadline scenario, which is too simplified to cope with complex\nsituations. The method encodes time series data in the Linux kernel into\ninformation that is easy to interpret for reinforcement learning, allowing the\nsystem to generate DVFS policies to adapt system patterns based on the general\nworkload. For encoding, we present two different methods for comparison. Both\nmethods use only one performance counter: system utilization, and the kernel\nonly needs minimal information from the userspace. Our method is implemented on\nJetson Nano Board (2GB) and is tested with three fixed multitask workloads,\nwhich are three, five, and eight tasks in the workload, respectively. For\nrandomness and generalization, we also designed a random workload generator to\nbuild different multitask workloads to test. Based on the test results, our\nmethod could save 3%-10% power compared to Linux built-in governors.",

To\nbetter classify the manifold-valued features, researchers have started\nextending Euclidean multinomial logistic regression (MLR) into Riemannian\nmanifolds. However, existing approaches suffer from limited applicability due\nto their strong reliance on specific geometric properties. This paper proposes\na framework for designing Riemannian MLR over general geometries, referred to\nas RMLR. Our framework only requires minimal geometric properties, thus\nexhibiting broad applicability and enabling its use with a wide range of\ngeometries. Specifically, we showcase our framework on the Symmetric Positive\nDefinite (SPD) manifold and special orthogonal group, i.e., the set of rotation\nmatrices. On the SPD manifold, we develop five families of SPD MLRs under five\ntypes of power-deformed metrics. On rotation matrices we propose Lie MLR based\non the popular bi-invariant metric. Extensive experiments on different\nRiemannian backbone networks validate the effectiveness of our framework.",

Furthermore,\nMicroFlow is able to use less Flash and RAM memory than other state-of-the-art\nsolutions for deploying NN reference models (i.e. wake-word and person\ndetection), achieving equally accurate but faster inference compared to\nexisting engines on medium-size NNs, and similar performance on bigger ones.\nThe experimental results prove the efficiency and suitability of MicroFlow for\nthe deployment of TinyML models in critical environments where resources are\nparticularly limited.",

Both\n$f$ and $h$ may be nonconvex. At each iteration, our method computes a step by\nminimizing the sum of a quadratic model of $f$, a model of $h$, and an adaptive\nquadratic regularization term. A step may be computed by a variant of the\nproximal-gradient method. An advantage of R2N over trust-region (TR) methods is\nthat proximal operators do not involve an extra TR indicator. We also develop\nthe variant R2DH, in which the model Hessian is diagonal, which allows us to\ncompute a step without relying on a subproblem solver when $h$ is separable.\nR2DH can be used as standalone solver, but also as subproblem solver inside\nR2N. We describe non-monotone variants of both R2N and R2DH. Global convergence\nof a first-order stationarity measure to zero holds without relying on local\nLipschitz continuity of $\\nabla f$, while allowing model Hessians to grow\nunbounded, an assumption particularly relevant to quasi-Newton models. Under\nLipschitz-continuity of $\\nabla f$, we establish a tight worst-case complexity\nbound of $O(1 / \\epsilon^{2/(1 - p)})$ to bring said measure below $\\epsilon >\n0$, where $0 \\leq p < 1$ controls the growth of model Hessians.

When $p = 1$, we establish the\ntight exponential complexity bound $O(\\exp(c \\epsilon^{-2}))$ where $c > 0$ is\na constant. We describe our Julia implementation and report numerical\nexperience on a basis-pursuit problem, image denoising, minimum-rank matrix\ncompletion, and a nonlinear support vector machine.

Here, we investigate a data-driven multi-modality\nimaging (DMI) strategy for synergetic imaging of CT and MRI. We reveal two\ndistinct types of features in multi-modality imaging, namely intra- and\ninter-modality features, and present a multi-sensor learning (MSL) framework to\nutilize the crossover inter-modality features for augmented multi-modality\nimaging. The MSL imaging approach breaks down the boundaries of traditional\nimaging modalities and allows for optimal hybridization of CT and MRI, which\nmaximizes the use of sensory data. We showcase the effectiveness of our DMI\nstrategy through synergetic CT-MRI brain imaging. The principle of DMI is quite\ngeneral and holds enormous potential for various DMI applications across\ndisciplines.",

    "abstract": "The nonlocality arising in a multi-party network involving multiple\nindependent sources radically differs from the standard multipartite Bell\nnonlocality involving a single source. The notion of the full network\nnonlocality (FNN) (Phys. Rev. Lett.128, 010403 (2022)) characterizes the\nquantum correlations that cannot be reproduced by a local-nonlocal model\nfeaturing one local source and the rest of nonlocal no-signaling sources.\nHowever, the demonstration of FNN was limited to bilocal and trilocal\nstar-shaped network scenarios involving three or two dichotomic measurements\nfor edge parties. In this paper, we first demonstrate that a large class of\nprevailing network inequalities does not exhibit FNN. We then introduce an\nelegant set of arbitrary-party and unbounded-input network inequalities in\nstar-shaped and linear-chain networks whose optimal quantum violation exhibits\nFNN, certifying that the nonlocality is genuinely distributed to the entire\nnetwork. Contrasting to existing demonstrations of FNN that inevitably require\nfixed-input and four-output elegant joint measurements for the central party,\nour generalized inequalities are more experimentally friendly, requiring only\ntwo-output measurements. Moreover, our derivation of optimal quantum violation\nis fully analytic and devoid of assuming the dimension of the quantum system,\nthereby showcasing its potential for device-independent self-testing.",

    "abstract": "Source Inference Attack (SIA) in Federated Learning (FL) aims to identify\nwhich client used a target data point for local model training. It allows the\ncentral server to audit clients' data usage. In cross-silo FL, a client (silo)\ncollects data from multiple subjects (e.g., individuals, writers, or devices),\nposing a risk of subject information leakage. Subject Membership Inference\nAttack (SMIA) targets this scenario and attempts to infer whether any client\nutilizes data points from a target subject in cross-silo FL. However, existing\nresults on SMIA are limited and based on strong assumptions on the attack\nscenario. Therefore, we propose a Subject-Level Source Inference Attack (SLSIA)\nby removing critical constraints that only one client can use a target data\npoint in SIA and imprecise detection of clients utilizing target subject data\nin SMIA. The attacker, positioned on the server side, controls a target data\nsource and aims to detect all clients using data points from the target\nsubject. Our strategy leverages a binary attack classifier to predict whether\nthe embeddings returned by a local model on test data from the target subject\ninclude unique patterns that indicate a client trains the model with data from\nthat subject. To achieve this, the attacker locally pre-trains models using\ndata derived from the target subject and then leverages them to build a\ntraining set for the binary attack classifier. Our SLSIA significantly\noutperforms previous methods on three datasets. Specifically, SLSIA achieves a\nmaximum average accuracy of 0.88 over 50 target subjects. Analyzing embedding\ndistribution and input feature distance shows that datasets with sparse\nsubjects are more susceptible to our attack. Finally, we propose to defend our\nSLSIA using item-level and subject-level differential privacy mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), commonly mimicking neurons with non-linear\nfunctions to output floating-point numbers, consistently receive the same\nsignals of a data point during its forward time. Unlike ANNs, Spiking Neural\nNetworks (SNNs) get various input signals in the forward time of a data point\nand simulate neurons in a biologically plausible way, i.e., producing a spike\n(a binary value) if the accumulated membrane potential of a neuron is larger\nthan a threshold. Even though ANNs have achieved remarkable success in multiple\ntasks, e.g., face recognition and object detection, SNNs have recently obtained\nattention due to their low power consumption, fast inference, and event-driven\nproperties. While privacy threats against ANNs are widely explored, much less\nwork has been done on SNNs. For instance, it is well-known that ANNs are\nvulnerable to the Membership Inference Attack (MIA), but whether the same\napplies to SNNs is not explored.\n  In this paper, we evaluate the membership privacy of SNNs by considering\neight MIAs, seven of which are inspired by MIAs against ANNs. Our evaluation\nresults show that SNNs are more vulnerable (maximum 10% higher in terms of\nbalanced attack accuracy) than ANNs when both are trained with neuromorphic\ndatasets (with time dimension). On the other hand, when training ANNs or SNNs\nwith static datasets (without time dimension), the vulnerability depends on the\ndataset used. If we convert ANNs trained with static datasets to SNNs, the\naccuracy of MIAs drops (maximum 11.5% with a reduction of 7.6% on the test\naccuracy of the target model). Next, we explore the impact factors of MIAs on\nSNNs by conducting a hyperparameter study. Finally, we show that the basic data\naugmentation method for static data and two recent data augmentation methods\nfor neuromorphic data can considerably (maximum reduction of 25.7%) decrease\nMIAs' performance on SNNs.",

In what at\nfirst appears as a puzzling result, $F_\\mathrm{L}$ in granular shear flow acts\nin the opposite direction to the Saffman lift force on a sphere in a sheared\nfluid at low $u_\\mathrm{s}$, reaches a maximum value, and then decreases,\neventually reversing direction and becoming comparable to $F_\\mathrm{L}$ for a\nfluid. This non-monotonic response holds over a range of flow conditions, and\nthe $F_\\mathrm{L}$ versus $u_\\mathrm{s}$ data can be collapsed by scaling both\nquantities using the particle sizes, shear rate, and overburden pressure.\nAnalogous fluid simulations demonstrate that the flow field around the intruder\nparticle is similar in the granular and fluid cases. However, the shear stress\nacting on the intruder in a granular shear flow is much less than that in a\nfluid shear flow.

    "abstract": "Large scale 3D scene reconstruction is important for applications such as\nvirtual reality and simulation. Existing neural rendering approaches (e.g.,\nNeRF, 3DGS) have achieved realistic reconstructions on large scenes, but\noptimize per scene, which is expensive and slow, and exhibit noticeable\nartifacts under large view changes due to overfitting. Generalizable approaches\nor large reconstruction models are fast, but primarily work for small\nscenes/objects and often produce lower quality rendering results. In this work,\nwe introduce G3R, a generalizable reconstruction approach that can efficiently\npredict high-quality 3D scene representations for large scenes. We propose to\nlearn a reconstruction network that takes the gradient feedback signals from\ndifferentiable rendering to iteratively update a 3D scene representation,\ncombining the benefits of high photorealism from per-scene optimization with\ndata-driven priors from fast feed-forward prediction methods. Experiments on\nurban-driving and drone datasets show that G3R generalizes across diverse large\nscenes and accelerates the reconstruction process by at least 10x while\nachieving comparable or better realism compared to 3DGS, and also being more\nrobust to large view changes.",

To bridge the gap of\ninput integrity while preserving learned image priors as much as possible, we\nselectively fine-tuned a small portion of the layers.

I then turn to the topic of engineering vacua in the\nnon-supersymmetric string models by constructing solutions that are supported\nby electric and magnetic fluxes and by providing evidence for their\ninstability.

Consequently, there is an urgent need to expedite\ntraining and enable model compression in MARL. This paper proposes the\nutilization of dynamic sparse training (DST), a technique proven effective in\ndeep supervised learning tasks, to alleviate the computational burdens in MARL\ntraining. However, a direct adoption of DST fails to yield satisfactory MARL\nagents, leading to breakdowns in value learning within deep sparse value-based\nMARL models. Motivated by this challenge, we introduce an innovative\nMulti-Agent Sparse Training (MAST) framework aimed at simultaneously enhancing\nthe reliability of learning targets and the rationality of sample distribution\nto improve value learning in sparse models. Specifically, MAST incorporates the\nSoft Mellowmax Operator with a hybrid TD-($\\lambda$) schema to establish\ndependable learning targets. Additionally, it employs a dual replay buffer\nmechanism to enhance the distribution of training samples. Building upon these\naspects, MAST utilizes gradient-based topology evolution to exclusively train\nmultiple MARL agents using sparse networks. Our comprehensive experimental\ninvestigation across various value-based MARL algorithms on multiple benchmarks\ndemonstrates, for the first time, significant reductions in redundancy of up to\n$20\\times$ in Floating Point Operations (FLOPs) for both training and\ninference, with less than $3\\%$ performance degradation.",

However, deploying these models may\nbe unreliable when significant distribution gaps exist between the training and\ntest data. The training-free test-time dynamic adapter (TDA) is a promising\napproach to address this issue by storing representative test samples to guide\nthe classification of subsequent ones. However, TDA only naively maintains a\nlimited number of reference samples in the cache, leading to severe test-time\ncatastrophic forgetting when the cache is updated by dropping samples. In this\npaper, we propose a simple yet effective method for DistributiOnal Test-time\nAdaptation (Dota). Instead of naively memorizing representative test samples,\nDota continually estimates the distributions of test samples, allowing the\nmodel to continually adapt to the deployment environment. The test-time\nposterior probabilities are then computed using the estimated distributions\nbased on Bayes' theorem for adaptation purposes. To further enhance the\nadaptability on the uncertain samples, we introduce a new human-in-the-loop\nparadigm which identifies uncertain samples, collects human-feedback, and\nincorporates it into the Dota framework.

However, the exact conservation of total\nsurfactant mass is compromised due to deviation from the equilibrium phase\nfield profile, numerical diffusion, and mass non-conservation in each phase. To\novercome these limitations, we have developed a new model for simulating\ntwo-phase flow with surfactant transport along the interface. This model\nemploys a profile-preserving strategy to maintain the equilibrium interface\nprofile, ensuring accurate calculation of the regularized delta function and\nbetter surfactant mass conservation. Within the framework of the advective\nChan-Hilliard phase-field model, we utilize a regularized delta function with a\nreduced gradient to minimize numerical diffusion. Furthermore, we introduce a\nhybrid surface tension model that integrates the free-energy and the\ncontinuum-surface force models to mitigate spatial discretization errors,\nparticularly in scenarios with high density and viscosity ratio. Verification\ntests demonstrates the model's effectiveness in simulating surface diffusion on\nstationary and expanding drop, suppressing spurious currents, and capturing the\ndeformation of two-dimensional drops in shear flow.

Weakly supervised learning (WSL) based on\nsparse annotation has achieved encouraging performance and demonstrated the\npotential to reduce annotation costs. This study attempts to introduce\nscribble-based WSL into ultrasound image segmentation tasks. However,\nultrasound images often suffer from poor contrast and unclear edges, coupled\nwith insufficient supervison signals for edges, posing challenges to edge\nprediction. Uncertainty modeling has been proven to facilitate models in\ndealing with these issues. Nevertheless, existing uncertainty estimation\nparadigms are not robust enough and often filter out predictions near decision\nboundaries, resulting in unstable edge predictions. Therefore, we propose\nleveraging predictions near decision boundaries effectively. Specifically, we\nintroduce Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) of evidence to design an Evidence-Guided\nConsistency strategy. This strategy utilizes high-evidence predictions, which\nare more likely to occur near high-density regions, to guide the optimization\nof low-evidence predictions that may appear near decision boundaries.\nFurthermore, the diverse sizes and locations of lesions in ultrasound images\npose a challenge for CNNs with local receptive fields, as they struggle to\nmodel global information. Therefore, we introduce Visual Mamba based on\nstructured state space sequence models, which achieves long-range dependency\nwith linear computational complexity, and we construct a novel hybrid CNN-Mamba\nframework. During training, the collaboration between the CNN branch and the\nMamba branch in the proposed framework draws inspiration from each other based\non the EGC strategy.

Such a\nprocess can be defined for any finite subset $S$ of a group, and we refer to\nsuch a process as simply ``solitaire''. We develop a general theory of\nsolitaire, and then concentrate on the simplest possible example, solitaire for\nthe plane $\\mathbb{Z}^2$, and $S$ the triangle shape (equivalently, any\nthree-element set in general position). In this case, we give a polynomial time\nalgorithm that puts any finite subset of the plane in normal form using\nsolitaire moves, and show that the solitaire orbit of a line of consecutive\nones -- the line orbit -- is completely characterised by the notion of a\nso-called fill matrix. We show that the diameter of the line orbit, as a graph\nwith edges the solitaire moves, is cubic. We show that analogous results hold\nfor the square shape, but indicate some shapes (still on the group\n$\\mathbb{Z}^2$) where this is less immediate. We then explain in detail the\nconnection of the solitaire to TEP and more generally permutive subshifts.\nNamely, the solitaire is a closure property of various sets of subsets of the\ngroup that can be associated to such a subshift, such as the independence,\nspanning and filling sets.",

The efficiency of S. pasteurii's chemical conversion\nranged from 40% to 80%, compared to only about 20% for S. aquimarina.

The feasibility of MICP in challenging conditions, such as the soil\naround piles in shallow seabeds during winter,characterized by high salinity,\nlow oxygen, and cold temperatures,remains uncertain due to limited research. To\naddress this gap, we employed microfluidic techniques and advanced measurement\ntools, including Raman spectroscopy and SEM, to assess how these conditions\ninfluence bacterial growth, calcium carbonate crystallization, and porous\nmedium permeability through MICP.Our findings indicate that cold temperatures\nnotably hinder bacterial growth, while high salinity and low oxygen also play\ncritical roles, particularly reducing bacterial attachment. In seawater\nenvironments, high salinity and cold temperatures significantly affect calcium\ncarbonate crystal shape and type; low oxygen has a lesser impact. Specifically,\nhigh salinity reduces crystal quantity by 20.2% with minimal effect on\ndiameter, while low oxygen increases diameter by 20.3% but decreases quantity\nby 50.9%. Cold temperatures decrease diameter by 36.9% without much effect on\nquantity.After six injections of the cementation solution, MICP treated samples\nshowed a chemical transformation efficiency of 20.6% compared to DI water,\nprimarily due to cold temperatures (contributing 40.1%).

To unleash the potential of MAs in wideband communication systems,\nacquiring accurate channel state information (CSI), i.e., the channel frequency\nresponses (CFRs) between any position pair within the transmit (Tx) region and\nthe receive (Rx) region across all subcarriers, is a crucial issue. In this\npaper, we study the channel estimation problem for wideband MA systems. To\nstart with, we express the CFRs as a combination of the field-response vectors\n(FRVs), delay-response vector (DRV), and path-response tensor (PRT), which\nexhibit sparse characteristics and can be recovered by using a limited number\nof channel measurements at selected position pairs of Tx and Rx MAs over a few\nsubcarriers. Specifically, we first formulate the recovery of the FRVs and DRV\nas a problem with multiple measurement vectors in compressed sensing (MMV-CS),\nwhich can be solved via a simultaneous orthogonal matching pursuit (SOMP)\nalgorithm. Next, we estimate the PRT using the least-square (LS) method.\nMoreover, we also devise an alternating refinement approach to further improve\nthe accuracy of the estimated FRVs, DRV, and PRT. This is achieved by\nminimizing the discrepancy between the received pilots and those constructed by\nthe estimated CSI, which can be efficiently carried out by using the gradient\ndescent algorithm. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that both the\nSOMP-based channel estimation method and alternating refinement method can\nreconstruct the complete wideband CSI with high accuracy, where the alternating\nrefinement method performs better despite a higher complexity.",

In particular, the Vision Transformer (ViT) has brought\nrevolutionary changes to the field of vision, achieving significant\naccomplishments on the experimental side. However, their theoretical\ncapabilities, particularly in terms of generalization when trained to overfit\ntraining data, are still not fully understood. To address this gap, this work\ndelves deeply into the benign overfitting perspective of transformers in\nvision. To this end, we study the optimization of a Transformer composed of a\nself-attention layer with softmax followed by a fully connected layer under\ngradient descent on a certain data distribution model. By developing techniques\nthat address the challenges posed by softmax and the interdependent nature of\nmultiple weights in transformer optimization, we successfully characterized the\ntraining dynamics and achieved generalization in post-training. Our results\nestablish a sharp condition that can distinguish between the small test error\nphase and the large test error regime, based on the signal-to-noise ratio in\nthe data model. The theoretical results are further verified by experimental\nsimulation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to\ncharacterize benign overfitting for Transformers.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the topological properties of magnons on a dice\nlattice, also known as the dual of a more widely studied kagome lattice. This\nstructure has a central atom at the center of the honeycomb lattice, which\nleads to the formation of a flat band. Magnetic Hamiltonians associated with\nthe magnon bands are scarcely studied in this flat band system, which motivates\nus on examining an interplay of different magnetic spin interactions, such as\nthe Heisenberg exchange, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), pseudodipolar\ninteraction (PDI) and magnetocrystalline anisotropies in a dice lattice. In\nparticular, the objective is to ascertain their roles in inducing various\ntopological phases and the phase transitions therein. The competing effects of\nthe DMI and the PDI in inducing transitions from either topological to\ntopological or topological to trivial phases are noted and the corresponding\nresults are supported via the magnon band structures, presence (or absence) of\nedge modes in a nanoribbon geometry, and the transport characteristic, namely\nthe discontinuities in the thermal Hall conductivities. Meanwhile, the\nmagnetocrystalline anisotropy also plays an intriguing role, where distinct\n(nonuniform) values at the different sublattice sites result in a richer\ntopological landscape with Chern numbers $C = \\pm 2$, $\\pm 1$, and $0$, while a\nuniform anisotropy yields only $C = \\pm 2$ and $0$. This discrepancy arises\nfrom the broken valley symmetry in the nonuniform case. Finally, we have\nenriched our understanding on the role of the flat band in impacting the\ntopological features by comparing some of the key results with that of a\nhoneycomb structure.",

    "abstract": "Train delays can propagate rapidly throughout the Urban Rail Transit (URT)\nnetwork under networked operation conditions, posing significant challenges to\noperational departments. Accurately predicting passenger travel choices under\ntrain delays can provide interpretable insights into the redistribution of\npassenger flow, offering crucial decision support for emergency response and\nservice recovery. However, the diversity of travel choices due to passenger\nheterogeneity and the sparsity of delay events leads to issues of data sparsity\nand sample imbalance in the travel choices dataset under metro delays. It is\nchallenging to model this problem using traditional machine learning\napproaches, which typically rely on large, balanced datasets. Given the\nstrengths of large language models (LLMs) in text processing, understanding,\nand their capabilities in small-sample and even zero-shot learning, this paper\nproposes a novel Passenger Travel Choice prediction framework under metro\ndelays with the Large Language Model (DelayPTC-LLM). The well-designed\nprompting engineering is developed to guide the LLM in making and rationalizing\npredictions about travel choices, taking into account passenger heterogeneity\nand features of the delay events. Utilizing real-world data from Shenzhen\nMetro, including Automated Fare Collection (AFC) data and detailed delay logs,\na comparative analysis of DelayPTC-LLM with traditional prediction models\ndemonstrates the superior capability of LLMs in handling complex, sparse\ndatasets commonly encountered under disruption of transportation systems.

Existing\napproaches often involve designing specific additional branches and performing\nfull-parameter fine-tuning for fusion in each task. However, this paradigm not\nonly duplicates research efforts and hardware costs but also risks model\ncollapse with the limited multi-modal annotated data. In this paper, we propose\na universal framework named X-Prompt for all multi-modal video object\nsegmentation tasks, designated as RGB+X. The X-Prompt framework first\npre-trains a video object segmentation foundation model using RGB data, and\nthen utilize the additional modality of the prompt to adapt it to downstream\nmulti-modal tasks with limited data. Within the X-Prompt framework, we\nintroduce the Multi-modal Visual Prompter (MVP), which allows prompting\nfoundation model with the various modalities to segment objects precisely. We\nfurther propose the Multi-modal Adaptation Experts (MAEs) to adapt the\nfoundation model with pluggable modality-specific knowledge without\ncompromising the generalization capacity. To evaluate the effectiveness of the\nX-Prompt framework, we conduct extensive experiments on 3 tasks across 4\nbenchmarks.

Interfaces\nbetween these topological phases exhibit gapless helical states, which provide\ncounter-propagating transport channels and robust quantized transport.\nAdditionally, we identify topological transitions that do not involve changes\nin the Chern number but can be characterized by transitions of skyrmions\nbetween high-symmetry points. These transitions arise due to the toroidal\nstructure of the two-dimensional Brillouin zone, which is generally applicable\nto two-dimensional periodic lattice system. Our research introduces new degrees\nof freedom for controlling topological optical transport and deepens the\nunderstanding of Chern insulators with inversion symmetry.",

To address the challenges brought by the radio\nchannel variations to air interface design, this article proposes a framework\nof wireless environment information-aided 6G AI-enabled air interface (WEI-6G\nAI$^{2}$), which actively acquires real-time environment details to facilitate\nchannel fading prediction and communication technology optimization.\nSpecifically, we first outline the role of WEI in supporting the 6G AI$^{2}$ in\nscenario adaptability, real-time inference, and proactive action. Then, WEI is\ndelineated into four progressive steps: raw sensing data, features obtained by\ndata dimensionality reduction, semantics tailored to tasks, and knowledge that\nquantifies the environmental impact on the channel. To validate the\navailability and compare the effect of different types of WEI, a path loss\nprediction use case is designed. The results demonstrate that leveraging\nenvironment knowledge requires only 2.2 ms of model inference time, which can\neffectively support real-time design for future 6G AI$^{2}$.

The blast wave is generated using a miniature shock\ngenerator which facilitates wide Mach number range ($1.01<M_s<1.6$). The\ninteraction of the shock flow occurs in two stages: 1) interaction of the\ntemporally decaying velocity ($\\rm v_s$) imposed by blast wave and 2)\ninteraction with the induced flow ($\\rm v_{ind}$). The flame base lifts off due\nto the imposed flow, and the advection of flame base towards flame tip results\nin flame extinction for $M_s > 1.06$. The timescale of the flame extinction is\nfaster (interaction with $\\rm v_s$) for $M_s>1.1$. The study investigates the\neffect on droplet regression, flame heat release rate and flame topological\nevolution during the interaction. The droplet regression rate gets enhanced\nafter the interaction with blast wave for $M_s < 1.06$, while it slowed down\ndue to complete extinction for $M_s > 1.06$. A momentary flame heat release\nrate (HRR) enhancement occurs during the interaction with shock flow, and this\nHRR enhancement is found to be more than 8 times the nominal unforced flame HRR\nfor $M_s > 1.1$, where rapid flame extinction occurs due to faster interaction\nwith $\\rm v_s$ ($\\sim O(10^{-1})ms$). HRR enhancement has been attributed to\nthe fuel vapor accumulation during the interaction. Furthermore, for $M_s >\n1.1$), compressible vortex interaction occurs with the droplet resulting in\ndroplet atomization. The droplet shows a wide range of atomization response\nmodes ranging for different shock strengths. No significant effect of\nnanoparticle (NP) addition has been found on the flame dynamics due to the\nfaster timescales. However, minimial effects of NP addition are observed during\ndroplet breakup due to fluid property variation.",

Resting-state\nfunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) serves as a primary tool for\nmapping these networks by correlating blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD)\nsignals across different brain regions, defined as regions of interest (ROIs).\nConstructing these brain networks involves using atlases to parcellate the\nbrain into ROIs based on various hypotheses of brain division. However, there\nis no standard atlas for brain network classification, leading to limitations\nin detecting abnormalities in disorders. Some recent methods have proposed\nutilizing multiple atlases, but they neglect consistency across atlases and\nlack ROI-level information exchange. To tackle these limitations, we propose an\nAtlas-Integrated Distillation and Fusion network (AIDFusion) to improve brain\nnetwork classification using fMRI data. AIDFusion addresses the challenge of\nutilizing multiple atlases by employing a disentangle Transformer to filter out\ninconsistent atlas-specific information and distill distinguishable connections\nacross atlases. It also incorporates subject- and population-level consistency\nconstraints to enhance cross-atlas consistency. Additionally, AIDFusion employs\nan inter-atlas message-passing mechanism to fuse complementary information\nacross brain regions.

    "abstract": "At it stands, the $\\Lambda CDM$ model does not anticipate the early emergence\nof massive galaxies. Canonical Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) seems to fail\nat late time solar system scale and Wide-Binary scales. To match data, a MOND\nvariant needs a variable MOND acceleration $a_0$ which is strong at high\nredshift galactic scale and diminishes over redshift to far below Newtonian\ngravity at solar system scale at late time. We found such a candidate in a\nrelativistic frame-work. In a previous work, a new single-metric solution of\nEinstein Gravity is found for a point mass residing in an expanding universe,\nwhich apart from the Newtonian acceleration, gives rise to an additional\nMOND-like acceleration in which the MOND acceleration $a_0$ is replaced by the\ncosmological acceleration $\\frac{1}{2}H^2(z)r$. This cosmological acceleration\nis shown to be far below Newtonian acceleration in the solar system and\ntherefore avoids the problem of MOND program. In this work, we study the\nmonolithic evolution of a Milky Way mass protogalactic cloud at recombination\nin this model where the non-Newtonian acceleration is stronger than Newtonian\ngravity. To obtain a spherical galaxy we assume that a point on a mass shell at\nturnaround will pick up sufficient non-systematic angular momentum. Assuming a\nviolent relaxation process similar to the simulation studies for MOND and\nNewtonian gravity, we find that the central core can form a time independent\nQuasi-Stationary-State (QSS) by z>7, which could explain the galaxy morphology\nstability observations for $z<6.5$. The virialised potential has a Newtonian\nacceleration dominant central region and a MOND-like acceleration dominant\nouter region. We evaluate the corresponding MOND acceleration $a_0^{VM}$ in a\nvirialised potential for a Milky-Way mass elliptical galaxy and find that\n$a_0^{VM}\\sim a_0$.",

It has a fairly unanimously accepted definition for the case of\nsymmetric games which are played in a homogeneous population where all\nindividuals are in same role. However, in asymmetric games, which are played in\na population with multiple subpopulations (each of which has individuals in one\nparticular role), situation is not as clear. Various generalizations of ESS\ndefined for such cases differ in how they correspond to fixed points of\nreplicator equation which models evolutionary dynamics of frequencies of\nstrategies in the population. Moreover, some of the definitions may even be\nequivalent, and hence, redundant in the scheme of things. Along with reporting\nsome new results, this paper is partly indented as a contextual mini-review of\nsome of the most important definitions of ESS in asymmetric games. We present\nthe definitions coherently and scrutinize them closely while establishing\nequivalences -- some of them hitherto unreported -- between them wherever\npossible. Since it is desirable that a definition of ESS should correspond to\nasymptotically stable fixed points of replicator dynamics, we bring forward the\nconnections between various definitions and their dynamical stabilities.\nFurthermore, we find the use of principle of relative entropy to gain\ninformation-theoretic insights into the concept of ESS in asymmetric games,\nthereby establishing a three-fold connection between game theory, dynamical\nsystem theory, and information theory in this context.

Tight-binding models capturing the\nessence of chiral crystals are introduced to investigate the multipole degrees\nof freedom possessed by the Hamiltonian.

The results show that in\naddition to the chiral SOC, hopping along the $z$-axis, which is irrelevant\nfrom a multipole perspective, is crucial for CISM.

    "abstract": "Movable antenna (MA) technology offers promising potential to enhance\nwireless communication by allowing flexible antenna movement. To maximize\nspatial degrees of freedom (DoFs), larger movable regions are required, which\nmay render the conventional far-field assumption for channels between\ntransceivers invalid. In light of it, we investigate in this paper MA-enabled\nnear-field communications, where a base station (BS) with multiple movable\nsubarrays serves multiple users, each equipped with a fixed-position antenna\n(FPA). First, we extend the field response channel model for MA systems to the\nnear-field propagation scenario. Next, we examine MA-aided multiuser\ncommunication systems under both digital and analog beamforming architectures.\nFor digital beamforming, spatial division multiple access (SDMA) is utilized,\nwhere an upper bound on the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio\n(SINR) across users is derived in closed form. A low-complexity algorithm based\non zero-forcing (ZF) is then proposed to jointly optimize the antenna position\nvector (APV) and digital beamforming matrix (DBFM) to approach this bound. For\nanalog beamforming, orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) is\nemployed, and an upper bound on the minimum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) among\nusers is derived. An alternating optimization (AO) algorithm is proposed to\niteratively optimize the APV, analog beamforming vector (ABFV), and power\nallocation until convergence. For both architectures, we further explore MA\ndesign strategies based on statistical channel state information (CSI), with\nthe APV updated less frequently to reduce the antenna movement overhead.\nSimulation results demonstrate that our proposed algorithms achieve performance\nclose to the derived bounds and also outperform the benchmark schemes using\ndense or sparse arrays with FPAs.",

    "abstract": "According to the WHO, in 2021, about 32% of pregnant women in sub-Saharan\nAfrica were infected with malaria during pregnancy. Malaria infection during\npregnancy can cause various adverse birth outcomes such as low birthweight.\nOver the past two decades, while some sub-Saharan African areas have\nexperienced a large reduction in malaria prevalence due to improved malaria\ncontrol and treatments, others have observed little change. Individual-level\ninterventional studies have shown that preventing malaria infection during\npregnancy can improve birth outcomes such as birthweight; however, it is still\nunclear whether natural reductions in malaria prevalence may help improve\ncommunity-level birth outcomes. We conduct an observational study using 203,141\nchildren's records in 18 sub-Saharan African countries from 2000 to 2018. Using\nheterogeneity of changes in malaria prevalence, we propose and apply a novel\npair-of-pairs design via two-stage bipartite and non-bipartite matching to\nconduct a difference-in-differences study with a continuous measure of malaria\nprevalence, namely the Plasmodium falciparum parasite rate among children aged\n2 to 10 ($\\text{PfPR}_{2-10}$).

For the\nstudy of two types of quartz DLA, the Ti:Sa laser system with a generation band\nwidth 790-810 nm (FWHM), the laser electric field 6 GeV/m are used. The study\nshowed that a flat dielectric structure provides more effective acceleration in\na wide range of energies, especially with a symmetrical geometry (double\nstructures), compared with the periodic structure. If we consider only a\nperiodic structure, then with the selected symmetrical geometry, for the ultra\nrelativistic electrons, it demonstrates the acceleration rate two times of\nmagnitude more than for single configuration. However, the use of a one-sided\nperiodic structure turns out to be preferable for accelerating electrons with\nmoderate energies, ~0.5-0.9 MeV, where the acceleration rate in a one-sided\nconfiguration is higher than in a symmetric (double) periodic structure. The\nspace-time distributions of laser-excited electromagnetic fields in the\naccelerating channel and their influence on the electron beam is analyzed also.\nThe advantage of a flat structure over a periodic one, which arises due to the\ndesign features of the corresponding dielectric accelerators, is discussed.",

We have found two series of lines with the\nQUIJOTE line survey that we assign to 1-C$_{12}$H$_7$CN and 5-C$_{12}$H$_7$CN.\nFor the 1-isomer, we have detected and assigned 173 rotational transitions with\n$J$ up to 46 and $K_a$ up to 9, corresponding to 107 independent frequencies.\nFor the 5-isomer, the identification is based on 56 individual lines,\ncorresponding to 117 rotational transitions with $J$ up to 40 and $K_a$ up to\n8. Identification of the carriers was achieved through a careful analysis of\nthe derived rotational constants, which permit us to focus on molecules larger\nthan naphthalene but smaller than anthracene and phenanthrene. Moreover, the\nderived rotational constants indicate that the species are planar; this allows\nus to discard derivatives of fluorene and acenaphthene, which are non-planar\nspecies. Quantum chemical calculations and subsequent chemical synthesis of\nthese molecules, as well as the observation of their rotational transitions in\nthe laboratory, unequivocally support our identifications. We also confirm, via\na robust line-by-line detection, the previous claimed detection of 1- and 2-\ncyanonaphthalene, which were obtained through statistical stacking techniques.\nThe column densities of 1- and 5-cyanoacenaphthylene are\n(9.5\\,$\\pm$\\,0.9)$\\,\\times$\\,10$^{11}$ cm$^{-2}$, while those of 1- and\n2-cyanonapthalene are (5.5\\,$\\pm$\\,0.5)$\\,\\times$\\,10$^{11}$ cm$^{-2}$. Hence,\nit seems that acenaphthylene could be a factor of 1.7 more abundant than\nnaphthalene.

Our method addresses critical limitations in\nstate-of-the-art detection techniques that hinder their practicality.

    "abstract": "Traceability plays a vital role in facilitating various software development\nactivities by establishing the traces between different types of artifacts\n(e.g., issues and commits in software repositories). Among the explorations for\nautomated traceability recovery, the IR (Information Retrieval)-based\napproaches leverage textual similarity to measure the likelihood of traces\nbetween artifacts and show advantages in many scenarios. However, the\nglobalization of software development has introduced new challenges, such as\nthe possible multilingualism on the same concept (e.g., \"ShuXing\" vs.\n\"attribute\") in the artifact texts, thus significantly hampering the\nperformance of IR-based approaches. Existing research has shown that machine\ntranslation can help address the term inconsistency in bilingual projects.\nHowever, the translation can also bring in synonymous terms that are not\nconsistent with those in the bilingual projects (e.g., another translation of\n\"ShuXing\" as \"property\"). Therefore, we propose an enhancement strategy called\nAVIATE that exploits translation variants from different translators by\nutilizing the word pairs that appear simultaneously across the translation\nvariants from different kinds artifacts (a.k.a. consensual biterms). We use\nthese biterms to first enrich the artifact texts, and then to enhance the\ncalculated IR values for improving IR-based traceability recovery for bilingual\nsoftware projects. The experiments on 17 bilingual projects (involving English\nand 4 other languages) demonstrate that AVIATE significantly outperformed the\nIR-based approach with machine translation (the state-of-the-art in this field)\nwith an average increase of 16.67 in Average Precision (31.43%) and 8.38\n(11.22%) in Mean Average Precision, indicating its effectiveness in addressing\nthe challenges of multilingual traceability recovery.",

Current\nTSE techniques often focus on minimizing discrepancies between generated speech\nand reference within edited regions during training to achieve fluent TSE\nperformance. However, the generated speech in the edited region should maintain\nacoustic and prosodic consistency with the unedited region and the original\nspeech at both the local and global levels. To maintain speech fluency, we\npropose a new fluency speech editing scheme based on our previous\n\\textit{FluentEditor} model, termed \\textit{\\textbf{FluentEditor2}}, by\nmodeling the multi-scale acoustic and prosody consistency training criterion in\nTSE training. Specifically, for local acoustic consistency, we propose\n\\textit{hierarchical local acoustic smoothness constraint} to align the\nacoustic properties of speech frames, phonemes, and words at the boundary\nbetween the generated speech in the edited region and the speech in the\nunedited region. For global prosody consistency, we propose \\textit{contrastive\nglobal prosody consistency constraint} to keep the speech in the edited region\nconsistent with the prosody of the original utterance.

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is an emerging distributed machine learning paradigm\nproposed for privacy preservation.

Machine learning models, especially convolutional neural networks\n(CNNs), have shown promise. However, the dynamic nature of real-world data can\nlead to model drift, where performance degrades over time as the underlying\ndata distribution changes. Addressing this challenge is crucial to maintaining\naccuracy and reliability in diagnostic applications.\n  Objective: This study aims to develop a framework that monitors model drift\nand employs adaptation mechanisms to mitigate performance fluctuations in\nCOVID-19 detection models trained on dynamic audio data.\n  Methods: Two crowd-sourced COVID-19 audio datasets, COVID-19 Sounds and\nCOSWARA, were used. Each was divided into development and post-development\nperiods. A baseline CNN model was trained and evaluated using cough recordings\nfrom the development period. Maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) was used to detect\nchanges in data distributions and model performance between periods. Upon\ndetecting drift, retraining was triggered to update the baseline model. Two\nadaptation approaches were compared: unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) and\nactive learning (AL).\n  Results: UDA improved balanced accuracy by up to 22% and 24% for the COVID-19\nSounds and COSWARA datasets, respectively. AL yielded even greater\nimprovements, with increases of up to 30% and 60%, respectively.\n  Conclusions: The proposed framework addresses model drift in COVID-19\ndetection, enabling continuous adaptation to evolving data.

Lowering the signal-to-noise ratio\n(S/N) threshold is a simple and cost-effective way to enhance the detection\nprobability of GWs from BNS mergers. In this study, we introduce a metric of\nthe purity of joint GW and EM detections $P_{\\rm joint}$, which is in analogue\nto $P_{\\rm astro}$ in GW only observations. By simulating BNS merger GWs\njointly detected by the HLV network and EM counterparts (kilonovae and short\nGamma-ray bursts, sGRBs) with an assumed merger rate density of BNS, we\ngenerate catalogs of GW events and EM counterparts. Through this simulation, we\nanalyze joint detection pairs, both correct and misidentified. We find the\nfollowing: 1. For kilonovae, requiring $P_{\\rm joint}>$ 95\\% instead of $P_{\\rm\nastro}>95\\%$ reduces the S/N from 9.2 to 8.5-8.8, allowing 5-13 additional\njoint detections per year and increasing the GW detection volume by 9-17\\%; 2.\nFor sGRBs, requiring $P_{\\rm joint}>$ 95\\% instead of $P_{\\rm astro}$ reduces\nthe S/N from 9.2 to 8.1-8.5; 3. Increasing kilonova or sGRB detection\ncapability does not improve $P_{\\rm joint}$ due to a higher rate of\nmisidentifications. We also show that sub-threshold GW and kilonova detections\ncan reduce the uncertainty in measuring the Hubble constant to 89-92\\% of its\noriginal value, and sub-threshold GW and sGRB observations can enhance the\nprecision of constraining the speed of GWs to 88\\% of previously established\nvalues.",

VPR is often formulated as an image\nretrieval task aimed at jointly learning local features and an aggregation\nmethod. The current state-of-the-art VPR methods rely on VLAD aggregation,\nwhich can be trained to learn a weighted contribution of features through their\nsoft assignment to cluster centers. However, this process has two key\nlimitations. Firstly, the feature-to-cluster weighting does not account for\nover-represented repetitive structures within a cluster, e.g., shadows or\nwindow panes; this phenomenon is also referred to as the `burstiness' problem,\nclassically solved by discounting repetitive features before aggregation.\nSecondly, feature to cluster comparisons are compute-intensive for\nstate-of-the-art image encoders with high-dimensional local features. This\npaper addresses these limitations by introducing VLAD-BuFF with two novel\ncontributions: i) a self-similarity based feature discounting mechanism to\nlearn Burst-aware features within end-to-end VPR training, and ii) Fast Feature\naggregation by reducing local feature dimensions specifically through\nPCA-initialized learnable pre-projection. We benchmark our method on 9 public\ndatasets, where VLAD-BuFF sets a new state of the art. Our method is able to\nmaintain its high recall even for 12x reduced local feature dimensions, thus\nenabling fast feature aggregation without compromising on recall. Through\nadditional qualitative studies, we show how our proposed weighting method\neffectively downweights the non-distinctive features. Source code:\nhttps://github.com/Ahmedest61/VLAD-BuFF/.",

As a time-efficient diffusion model,\nalthough consistency models have been validated in online state-based RL, it is\nstill an open question whether it can be extended to visual RL. In this paper,\nwe investigate the impact of non-stationary distribution and the actor-critic\nframework on consistency policy in online RL, and find that consistency policy\nwas unstable during the training, especially in visual RL with the\nhigh-dimensional state space. To this end, we suggest sample-based entropy\nregularization to stabilize the policy training, and propose a consistency\npolicy with prioritized proximal experience regularization (CP3ER) to improve\nsample efficiency. CP3ER achieves new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in 21\ntasks across DeepMind control suite and Meta-world. To our knowledge, CP3ER is\nthe first method to apply diffusion/consistency models to visual RL and\ndemonstrates the potential of consistency models in visual RL.

However, these methods are limited\nin adapting models to variable sizes for real-world deployment, where no\ncorresponding pre-trained models exist. To address this, we introduce FINE, a\nmethod based on the Learngene framework, to initializing downstream networks\nleveraging pre-trained models, while considering both model sizes and\ntask-specific requirements. FINE decomposes pre-trained knowledge into the\nproduct of matrices (i.e., $U$, $\\Sigma$, and $V$), where $U$ and $V$ are\nshared across network blocks as ``learngenes'', and $\\Sigma$ remains\nlayer-specific. During initialization, FINE trains only $\\Sigma$ using a small\nsubset of data, while keeping the learngene parameters fixed, marking it the\nfirst approach to integrate both size and task considerations in\ninitialization. We provide a comprehensive benchmark for learngene-based\nmethods in image generation tasks, and extensive experiments demonstrate that\nFINE consistently outperforms direct pre-training, particularly for smaller\nmodels, achieving state-of-the-art results across variable model sizes.

Without damping, the system is Hamiltonian, with the origin\nas an elliptic equilibrium characterized by two distinct linear frequencies. To\nunderstand the dynamics, it is crucial to derive explicit analytic formulae for\nthe nonlinear frequencies as functions of the physical parameters involved. In\nthe small amplitude regime (perturbative case), we provide the first-order\nnonlinear correction to the linear frequencies. While this analytic expression\nwas already derived for non-resonant cases, it is novel in the context of\nresonant or nearly resonant scenarios. Specifically, we focus on the 3:1\nresonance, the only resonance involved in the first-order correction. Utilizing\nthe Hamiltonian structure, we employ Perturbation Theory methods to transform\nthe system into Birkhoff Normal Form up to order four. This involves converting\nthe system into action-angle variables (symplectically rescaled polar\ncoordinates), where the truncated Hamiltonian at order four depends on the\nactions and, due to the resonance, on one \"slow\" angle. By constructing\nsuitable nonlinear and not close-to-the-identity coordinate transformations, we\nidentify new sets of symplectic action-angle variables. In these variables, the\nresulting system is integrable up to higher-order terms, meaning it does not\ndepend on the angles, and the frequencies are obtained from the derivatives of\nthe energy with respect to the actions. This construction is highly dependent\non the physical parameters, necessitating a detailed case analysis of the phase\nportrait, revealing up to six topologically distinct behaviors.

Despite substantial interest, a unified\nmethod for analyzing the convergence rates of distributed optimization\nalgorithms is lacking. This paper introduces an energy conservation approach\nfor analyzing continuous-time dynamical systems in dilated coordinates. Instead\nof directly analyzing dynamics in the original coordinate system, we establish\na conserved quantity, akin to physical energy, in the dilated coordinate\nsystem. Consequently, convergence rates can be explicitly expressed in terms of\nthe inverse time-dilation factor. Leveraging this generalized approach, we\nformulate a novel second-order distributed accelerated gradient flow with a\nconvergence rate of $O\\left(1/t^{2-\\epsilon}\\right)$ in time $t$ for\n$\\epsilon>0$. We then employ a semi second-order symplectic Euler\ndiscretization to derive a rate-matching algorithm with a convergence rate of\n$O\\left(1/k^{2-\\epsilon}\\right)$ in $k$ iterations. To the best of our\nknowledge, this represents the most favorable convergence rate for any\ndistributed optimization algorithm designed for smooth convex optimization. Its\naccelerated convergence behavior is benchmarked against various\nstate-of-the-art distributed optimization algorithms on practical, large-scale\nproblems.",

The robots' simplicity imply a\nstrong limitation: When the initial configuration is rotationally symmetric,\nonly patterns with a similar symmetry can be formed [Yamashita, Suzyuki; TCS\n2010]. The only known algorithm to form large patterns with limited visibility\nand without memory requires the robots to start in a near-gathering (a swarm of\nconstant diameter) [Hahn et al.; SAND 2024]. However, not only do we not know\nany near-gathering algorithm guaranteed to preserve symmetry but most natural\ngathering strategies trivially increase symmetries [Castenow et al.; OPODIS\n2022].\n  Thus, we study near-gathering without changing the swarm's rotational\nsymmetry for disoriented, oblivious robots with limited visibility (the\nOBLOT-model, see [Flocchini et al.; 2019]). We introduce a technique based on\nthe theory of dynamical systems to analyze how a given algorithm affects\nsymmetry and provide sufficient conditions for symmetry preservation. Until\nnow, it was unknown whether the considered OBLOT-model allows for any\nnon-trivial algorithm that always preserves symmetry. Our first result shows\nthat a variant of Go-to-the-Average always preserves symmetry but may sometimes\nlead to multiple, unconnected near-gathering clusters. Our second result is a\nsymmetry-preserving near-gathering algorithm that works on swarms with a convex\nboundary (the outer boundary of the unit disc graph) and without holes (circles\nof diameter 1 inside the boundary without any robots).",

Methods: 281\nchildren, aged 1 to 18 years, who underwent sleep monitoring between September\nand November 2023 at the Sleep Center of Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital\nMedical University, were recruited in the study. All enrolled children\nunderwent sleep monitoring by PSG and the millimeter-wave radar-based device,\nQSA600, simultaneously. QSA600 recordings were automatically analyzed using a\ndeep learning model meanwhile the PSG data was manually scored. Results: The\nObstructive Apnea-Hypopnea Index (OAHI) obtained from QSA600 and PSG\ndemonstrates a high level of agreement with an intraclass correlation\ncoefficient of 0.945 (95% CI: 0.93 to 0.96). Bland-Altman analysis indicates\nthat the mean difference of OAHI between QSA600 and PSG is -0.10 events/h (95%\nCI: -11.15 to 10.96). The deep learning model evaluated through\ncross-validation showed good sensitivity (81.8%, 84.3% and 89.7%) and\nspecificity (90.5%, 95.3% and 97.1%) values for diagnosing children with\nOAHI>1, OAHI>5 and OAHI>10. The area under the receiver operating\ncharacteristic curve is 0.923, 0.955 and 0.988, respectively. For sleep stage\nclassification, the model achieved Kappa coefficients of 0.854, 0.781, and\n0.734, with corresponding overall accuracies of 95.0%, 84.8%, and 79.7% for\nWake-sleep classification, Wake-REM-Light-Deep classification, and\nWake-REM-N1-N2 N3 classification, respectively. Conclusions: QSA600 has\ndemonstrated high agreement with PSG in diagnosing OSA and performing sleep\nstaging in children.

This paper introduces a novel admittance controller that ensures\nstable force control after impacting unknown stiffness environments by\nleveraging the differentiability of impact-contact forces. The controller is\nmathematically represented by a differential algebraic inclusion (DAI)\ncomprising two interdependent set-valued loops. The first loop employs\nset-valued first-order sliding mode control (SMC) to limit input torque\npost-impact. The second loop utilizes the multivariable super-twisting\nalgorithm (MSTA) to mitigate unstable motion caused by impact forces when\ninteracting with unknown stiffness environments. Implementing this proposed\nadmittance control in digital settings presents challenges due to the\ninterconnected structure of the two set-valued loops, unlike implicit Euler\ndiscretization methods for set-valued SMCs. To facilitate implementation, this\npaper offers a new algorithm for implicit Euler discretization of the DAI.\nSimulation and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed admittance\ncontroller outperforms state-of-the-art methods.",

Identifying a general strategy to realize\ncoexistence of FE and SC in a single material is extremely important for this\nactive field, but quite challenging thus far. We show in this work that\ncoexistence of robust FE and metallicity/SC can be realized by hole-doping a\nferroelectric insulator which hosts antibonding highest valence bands (HVB).\nUsing typical 2D ferroelecrtic SnS monolayer as a concrete example, we\ndemonstrate that 0.30 hole/cell doping leads to enhancement of total\npolarization mainly ascribed to the increasing of polar displacement and ionic\npolarization. In addition, due to the strong Fermi surface nesting and\nprominent softening of out-of-plane acoustic phonon upon hole-doping, SnS can\nbe turned into a single gap superconductor with an unexpectedly high transition\ntemperature (Tc) of ~7 K, whereas the polar phonon mode gives negligible\ncontribution to electron-phonon couplings. Our work provides general principle\nand realistic material for realizing metallic FE and superconducting FE, which\npaves the way for reversible and nonvolatile superconducting devices.",

By analyzing user data such as\npast activities, ratings, and preferences, these systems generate personalized\nrecommendations for products, services, or content, with common applications\nincluding online retail, media streaming platforms, and social media.\nRecommender systems are typically categorized into three types: content-based\nfiltering, which recommends items similar to those the user has shown interest\nin; collaborative filtering, which analyzes the preferences of similar users;\nand hybrid methods, which combine both approaches to improve accuracy. These\nsystems enhance user experience by reducing information overload and providing\npersonalized suggestions, thus increasing engagement and satisfaction. However,\nbuilding a scalable recommendation system capable of handling numerous users\nefficiently is a significant challenge, particularly when considering both\nperformance consistency and user data security, which are emerging research\ntopics.

RLHF complicates the dataflow by\nexpanding each node into a distributed LLM training or generation program, and\neach edge into a many-to-many multicast. Traditional RL frameworks execute the\ndataflow using a single controller to instruct both intra-node computation and\ninter-node communication, which can be inefficient in RLHF due to large control\ndispatch overhead for distributed intra-node computation.

On the other hand, similarly to the\nclassical quasi-stationary distribution, we show that it can be written in\nterms of the eigenvectors of the underlying Markov kernel, and it is therefore\namenable of a geometric interpretation. Moreover, we recover the usual\nexponential behavior that characterizes quasi-stationary distributions and\nmetastable systems.

While significant efforts have been made in this field, most\nwere focused on mitigating the catastrophic forgetting issue to achieve better\nclassification ability, at the cost of a much heavier training workload. They\noverlooked that in real-world scenarios, e.g., in high-speed data stream\nenvironments, data do not pause to accommodate slow models. In this paper, we\nemphasize that model throughput -- defined as the maximum number of training\nsamples that a model can process within a unit of time -- is equally important.\nIt directly limits how much data a model can utilize and presents a challenging\ndilemma for current methods. With this understanding, we revisit key challenges\nin OCL from both empirical and theoretical perspectives, highlighting two\ncritical issues beyond the well-documented catastrophic forgetting: Model's\nignorance: the single-pass nature of OCL challenges models to learn effective\nfeatures within constrained training time and storage capacity, leading to a\ntrade-off between effective learning and model throughput; Model's myopia: the\nlocal learning nature of OCL on the current task leads the model to adopt\noverly simplified, task-specific features and excessively sparse classifier,\nresulting in the gap between the optimal solution for the current task and the\nglobal objective. To tackle these issues, we propose the Non-sparse Classifier\nEvolution framework (NsCE) to facilitate effective global discriminative\nfeature learning with minimal time cost.

However, existing deep-learning methods often\noverlook the dynamic nature of epidemics and fail to account for the specific\nmechanisms of disease transmission. In response to these challenges, we\nintroduce an innovative end-to-end framework called Epidemiology-Aware Neural\nODE with Continuous Disease Transmission Graph (EARTH) in this paper. To learn\ncontinuous and regional disease transmission patterns, we first propose EANO,\nwhich seamlessly integrates the neural ODE approach with the epidemic\nmechanism, considering the complex spatial spread process during epidemic\nevolution. Additionally, we introduce GLTG to model global infection trends and\nleverage these signals to guide local transmission dynamically. To accommodate\nboth the global coherence of epidemic trends and the local nuances of epidemic\ntransmission patterns, we build a cross-attention approach to fuse the most\nmeaningful information for forecasting. Through the smooth synergy of both\ncomponents, EARTH offers a more robust and flexible approach to understanding\nand predicting the spread of infectious diseases. Extensive experiments show\nEARTH superior performance in forecasting real-world epidemics compared to\nstate-of-the-art methods.

First, we analyze the quantum superposition\nof photon pairs generated randomly from cross-sandwiched nonlinear media,\nfocusing on local randomness, which depends on the incoherence among measured\nevents. Second, we investigate coincidence detection between paired photons to\nunderstand the nonlocal correlation arising from independently controlled\nremote parameters, resulting in an inseparable product-basis relationship.

Therefore, to solve long-horizon\ndecision-making problems with autonomous robots, we must construct agents that\nare capable of adapting to changes in the environment during deployment.\nModel-based planning approaches can enable robots to solve complex,\nlong-horizon tasks in a variety of environments. However, such approaches tend\nto be brittle when deployed into an environment featuring a novel situation\nthat their underlying model does not account for. In this work, we propose to\nlearn a ``bridge policy'' via Reinforcement Learning (RL) to adapt to such\nnovelties. We introduce a simple formulation for such learning, where the RL\nproblem is constructed with a special ``CallPlanner'' action that terminates\nthe bridge policy and hands control of the agent back to the planner. This\nallows the RL policy to learn the set of states in which querying the planner\nand following the returned plan will achieve the goal. We show that this\nformulation enables the agent to rapidly learn by leveraging the planner's\nknowledge to avoid challenging long-horizon exploration caused by sparse\nreward. In experiments across three different simulated domains of varying\ncomplexity, we demonstrate that our approach is able to learn policies that\nadapt to novelty more efficiently than several baselines, including a pure RL\nbaseline. We also demonstrate that the learned bridge policy is generalizable\nin that it can be combined with the planner to enable the agent to solve more\ncomplex tasks with multiple instances of the encountered novelty.",

To explore this, we study the exciton transport\nof the two-dimensional multi-chain systems with different coupling\nconfigurations in an optical cavity. Two types of the chains--the homogeneous\nand heterogeneous coupling chain, as well as two inter-chain coupling\nconformations--the square and triangular arrangements, are considered. The\neffects of the inter-chain coupling, the dimerization parameter, the cavity,\nthe length and number of the chains on exciton transport are systematically\ninvestigated for different coupling configurations through the spectra, the\nHopfield coeffcients, and the steady-state dynamics of the system. The results\nshow that in the absence of a cavity the exciton transport currents and\neffciency are determined by the exciton distribution across the multi-chain\nsystem. However, when a cavity is introduced the exciton transport can be\nsignificantly enhanced or suppressed by the polariton formation at the\ncavity-dressed energy level crossings and anticrossings near zero-energy modes,\nwhere the coherent excitation and LandauZener transitions occur. Meanwhile, we\ndiscover that the discontinuous and extremal points in the second-order partial\nderivatives of the photon Hopfield coeffcients with respect to the inter-chain\ncoupling and the dimerization parameter correspond respectively to the\ncrossings and anticrossings at the extreme points of the photon occupation\nnumber. Additionally, exciton transport effciency is closely related to the\nodevity of both chain length and chain number, and exhibits oscillatory\nbehaviour.

In\nthis regards, closed form expressions are derived to evaluate the success\nprobability of channel access for each protocol. In order to show the merit of\nthe proposed procedure, a comprehensive system level analysis is also provided,\nwhich highlights that the proposed procedure outperforms the two state-of-art\nprotocols in terms of mitigating the End-to-End (E2E) delay and allowing a\nbetter spectrum utilization by reducing the overall congestion in the system.",

Recently,\nradar has shown potential in detecting sleep apnea-hypopnea events (SAE) with\nthe advantages of low cost and non-contact monitoring. However, existing\nstudies, especially those using deep learning, employ segment-based\nclassification approach for SAE detection, making the task of event quantity\nestimation difficult. Additionally, radar-based SAE detection is susceptible to\ninterference from body movements and the environment. Oxygen saturation (SpO2)\ncan offer valuable information about OSAHS, but it also has certain limitations\nand cannot be used alone for diagnosis. In this study, we propose a method\nusing millimeterwave radar and pulse oximeter to detect SAE, called ROSA.

These problems have\nsignificant applications in sequential data learning, such as text\nclassification using recurrent neural networks. The unbounded smoothness is\ncharacterized by the smoothness constant of the upper-level function scaling\nlinearly with the gradient norm, lacking a uniform upper bound. Existing\nstate-of-the-art algorithms require $\\widetilde{O}(1/\\epsilon^4)$ oracle calls\nof stochastic gradient or Hessian/Jacobian-vector product to find an\n$\\epsilon$-stationary point. However, it remains unclear if we can further\nimprove the convergence rate when the assumptions for the function in the\npopulation level also hold for each random realization almost surely. To\naddress this issue, we propose a new Accelerated Bilevel Optimization algorithm\nnamed AccBO. The algorithm updates the upper-level variable by normalized\nstochastic gradient descent with recursive momentum and the lower-level\nvariable by the stochastic Nesterov accelerated gradient descent algorithm with\naveraging. We prove that our algorithm achieves an oracle complexity of\n$\\widetilde{O}(1/\\epsilon^3)$ to find an $\\epsilon$-stationary point, when the\nlower-level stochastic gradient's variance is $O(\\epsilon)$. Our proof relies\non a novel lemma characterizing the dynamics of stochastic Nesterov accelerated\ngradient descent algorithm under distribution drift with high probability for\nthe lower-level variable, which is of independent interest and also plays a\ncrucial role in analyzing the hypergradient estimation error over time.\nExperimental results on various tasks confirm that our proposed algorithm\nachieves the predicted theoretical acceleration and significantly outperforms\nbaselines in bilevel optimization.",

Symbolic\nregression is a key to extracting material descriptors from large datasets, in\nparticular the Sure Independence Screening and Sparsifying Operator (SISSO)\nmethod. While SISSO needs to store the entire expression space to impose heavy\nmemory demands, it limits the performance in complex problems. To address this\nissue, we propose a RF-SISSO algorithm by combining Random Forests (RF) with\nSISSO. In this algorithm, the Random Forest algorithm is used for prescreening,\ncapturing non-linear relationships and improving feature selection, which may\nenhance the quality of the input data and boost the accuracy and efficiency on\nregression and classification tasks. For a testing on the SISSO's verification\nproblem for 299 materials, RF-SISSO demonstrates its robust performance and\nhigh accuracy. RF-SISSO can maintain the testing accuracy above 0.9 across all\nfour training sample sizes and significantly enhancing regression efficiency,\nespecially in training subsets with smaller sample sizes. For the training\nsubset with 45 samples, the efficiency of RF-SISSO was 265 times higher than\nthat of original SISSO.

Key\nfindings indicate a diverse range of institutional strategies, with most\norganizations in the experimental phase of GenAI deployment. The study\nhighlights significant variations in governance models, with a strong\npreference for centralized decision-making but notable gaps in workforce\ntraining and ethical oversight. Moreover, the results underscore the need for a\nmore coordinated approach to GenAI governance, emphasizing collaboration among\nsenior leaders, clinicians, information technology staff, and researchers. Our\nanalysis also reveals concerns regarding GenAI bias, data security, and\nstakeholder trust, which must be addressed to ensure the ethical and effective\nimplementation of GenAI technologies. This study offers valuable insights into\nthe challenges and opportunities of GenAI integration in healthcare, providing\na roadmap for institutions aiming to leverage GenAI for improved quality of\ncare and operational efficiency.",

The\nredshift range of the galaxies is limited to $5.03\\leq z\\leq 5.26$ by requiring\nphotometric excesses in NIRCam's F277W and F410M images.

Kinematic analysis of the surroundings of hub-filaments is essential\nto better understand high-mass star formation within such systems. In this\nwork, we present a detailed study of the massive Galactic protocluster IRAS\n15394$-$5358, using continuum and molecular line data from the ALMA\nThree-millimeter Observations of Massive Star-forming Regions (ATOMS) survey.\nThe 3~mm dust continuum map reveals the fragmentation of the massive ($\\rm\nM=843~M_{\\odot}$) clump into six cores. The core C-1A is the largest (radius =\n0.04~pc), the most massive ($\\rm M=157~M_{\\odot}$), and lies within the dense\ncentral region, along with two smaller cores ($\\rm M=7~and~3~M_{\\odot}$). The\nfragmentation process is consistent with the thermal Jeans fragmentation\nmechanism and virial analysis shows that all the cores have small virial\nparameter values ($\\rm \\alpha_{vir}<<2$), suggesting that the cores are\ngravitationally bound. The mass vs. radius relation indicates that three cores\ncan potentially form at least a single massive star. The integrated intensity\nmap of $\\rm H^{13}CO^{+}$ shows that the massive clump is associated with a\nhub-filament system, where the central hub is linked with four filaments. A\nsharp velocity gradient is observed towards the hub, suggesting a global\ncollapse where the filaments are actively feeding the hub. We discuss the role\nof global collapse and the possible driving mechanisms for the massive star\nformation activity in the protocluster.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a safe delay-adaptive control for a strict-feedback\nnonlinear ODE with a delayed actuator, whose dynamic is also a strict-feedback\nnonlinear ODE and the delay length is unknown. By formulating the delay as a\ntransport PDE, the plant becomes a sandwich configuration consisting of\nnonlinear ODE-transport PDE-nonlinear ODE, where the transport speed in the PDE\nis unknown. We propose a predictor-based nonovershooting backstepping\ntransformation to build the nominal safe delay-compensated control,\nguaranteeing that the output of the distal ODE safely tracks the target\ntrajectory from one side without undershooting. To address the uncertainty in\nthe delay, we incorporate recent delay-adaptive and safe adaptive technologies\nto build a safe adaptive-delay controller. The adaptive closed-loop system\nensures 1) the exact identification of the unknown delay in finite time; 2) the\noutput state stays in the safe region all the time, especially in the original\nsafe region, instead of a subset, after a finite time; 3) all states are\nbounded, and moreover, they will converge to zero if the target trajectory is\nidentically zero. In the simulation, the proposed control design is verified in\nthe application of safe vehicle platooning. It regulates the spacing between\nadjacent vehicles to converge to a small distance and avoids collisions by\nensuring they do not breach the safe distance at any time, even in the presence\nof large unknown delays and at a relatively high speed.",

    "abstract": "This paper is devoted to establishing the kernel theorems for\n$\\alpha$-modulation spaces in terms of boundedness and compactness. We\ncharacterize the boundedness of a linear operator $A$ from an\n$\\alpha$-modulation space $M^p_{\\alpha}(\\mathbb{R}^d)$ into another\n$\\alpha$-modulation space $M^q_{\\alpha}(\\mathbb{R}^d)$, by the membership of\nits distributional kernel in mixed $\\alpha$-modulation spaces. We also\ncharacterize the compactness of $A$ by means of the kernel in a certain closed\nsubspace of mixed $\\alpha$-modulation spaces. The proofs are based on the\nviewpoint that the action of the linear operator on certain function space can\nbe reduced to the action on the suitable atoms of this function space.",

    "abstract": "A extension of the Euler-Maclaurin (E-M) formula to near-singular functions\nis presented. This extension is derived based on earlier generalized E-M\nformulas for singular functions. The new E-M formulas consists of two\ncomponents: a ``singular'' component that is a continuous extension of the\nearlier singular E-M formulas, and a ``jump'' component associated with the\ndiscontinuity of the integral with respect to a parameter that controls near\nsingularity. The singular component of the new E-M formulas is an asymptotic\nseries whose coefficients depend on the Hurwitz zeta function or the digamma\nfunction. Numerical examples of near-singular quadrature based on the extended\nE-M formula are presented, where accuracies of machine precision are achieved\ninsensitive to the strength of the near singularity and with a very small\nnumber of quadrature nodes.",

    "abstract": "We present a comprehensive analysis of 20 T and Y dwarfs using spectroscopy\nfrom the NIRSpec CLEAR/PRISM and MIRI LRS instruments on the James Webb Space\nTelescope. To characterize the atmospheric parameters, we utilize two\natmospheric model grids: the Sonora Elf Owl and ATMO2020++. The effective\ntemperatures derived from the two models are relatively consistent, and\nmetallicities are both close to solar values. However, significant\ndiscrepancies are found in other parameters, particularly in surface gravity,\nwith the values obtained from the Sonora Elf Owl models typically being about 1\ndex lower than those from the ATMO2020++ models. Further comparisons using the\nATMO2020 models highlight that the adiabatic convective process introduced in\nthe ATMO2020++ models has a significant impact on the determination of surface\ngravity. Using the fitted effective temperatures and absolute parallaxes from\nthe literature, we derive radii for the brown dwarfs, which range from\napproximately 0.8 to 1.2 $R_{\\mathrm{Jup}}$. The estimated masses and ages,\nderived using evolutionary tracks, indicate that most brown dwarfs in our\nsample have masses below 30 $M_{\\mathrm{Jup}}$ and are younger than 6 Gyr.\nSpecifically, Y dwarfs have masses ranging from 2 to 20 $M_{\\mathrm{Jup}}$ and\nages between 0.1 and 6.7 Gyr. In addition, We discuss the determination of\natmospheric parameters using only NIRSpec or MIRI spectra. Comparisons with\nresults from the combined spectra show that the effective temperatures and\nsurface gravities derived solely from NIRSpec spectra are largely consistent\nwith those obtained from the combined spectra.",

    "abstract": "Imitation learning (IL) has shown great success in learning complex robot\nmanipulation tasks. However, there remains a need for practical safety methods\nto justify widespread deployment. In particular, it is important to certify\nthat a system obeys hard constraints on unsafe behavior in settings when it is\nunacceptable to design a tradeoff between performance and safety via tuning the\npolicy (i.e. soft constraints). This leads to the question, how does enforcing\nhard constraints impact the performance (meaning safely completing tasks) of an\nIL policy? To answer this question, this paper builds a reachability-based\nsafety filter to enforce hard constraints on IL, which we call\nReachability-Aided Imitation Learning (RAIL). Through evaluations with\nstate-of-the-art IL policies in mobile robots and manipulation tasks, we make\ntwo key findings. First, the highest-performing policies are sometimes only so\nbecause they frequently violate constraints, and significantly lose performance\nunder hard constraints. Second, surprisingly, hard constraints on the\nlower-performing policies can occasionally increase their ability to perform\ntasks safely. Finally, hardware evaluation confirms the method can operate in\nreal time.",

    "abstract": "This paper examines the problem of estimating the states, including state of\ncharge, of battery cells connected in parallel. Previous research highlights\nthe importance of this problem, and presents multiple approaches for solving\nit. Algorithm scalability and observability analysis can both be challenging,\nparticularly because the underlying pack dynamics are governed by differential\nalgebraic equations. Our work addresses these challenges from a novel\nperspective that begins by inverting the causality of parallel pack dynamics,\nwhich breaks the pack model's underlying algebraic loop. This simplifies\nobservability analysis and observer design significantly, leading to three\nnovel contributions. First, the paper derives mathematical conditions for state\nobservability that apply regardless of the number of battery cells and the\norder of their individual dynamics. Second, the paper presents an approach for\ngrouping battery cells such that their lumped dynamics are observable. Finally,\nthe paper presents a novel pack state estimator that achieves computational\ntractability by employing inverse dynamic modeling. We conclude by presenting a\nMonte Carlo simulation study of this estimator using\nexperimentally-parameterized models of two battery chemistries. The simulation\nresults highlight the computational benefits of both the clustering strategy\nand inverse dynamics approach for state estimation.",

    "abstract": "Two machine learning-aided thermodynamic integration schemes to compute the\nchemical potentials of atoms and molecules have been developed and compared.\nOne is the particle insertion method, and the other combines particle insertion\nwith element substitution. In the former method, the species is gradually\ninserted into the liquid, and its chemical potential is computed. In the latter\nmethod, after the particle insertion, the inserted species is substituted with\nanother species, and the chemical potential of this new species is computed. In\nboth methods, the thermodynamic integrations are conducted using\nmachine-learned potentials trained on first-principles datasets. The errors of\nthe machine-learned surrogate models are further corrected by performing\nthermodynamic integrations from the machine-learned potentials to the\nfirst-principles potentials, accurately providing the first-principles chemical\npotentials. These two methods are applied to compute the real potentials of\nproton, alkali metal cations, and halide anions in water. The applications\nindicate that these two entirely different thermodynamic pathways yield\nidentical real potentials within statistical error bars, demonstrating that\nboth methods provide reproducible real potentials. The computed real potentials\nand solvation structures are also in good agreement with past experiments and\nsimulations. These results indicate that machine learning surrogate models\nenabling the atomic insertion and element substitution provide a precise method\nfor determining the chemical potentials of atoms and molecules.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel framework for jointly estimating unknown radar\nchannels and transmit signals in millimeter-wave (mmWave) Joint\nRadar-Communication (JRC) systems, a problem often referred to as dual-blind\ndeconvolution. The proposed method employs the Alternating Direction Method of\nMultipliers (ADMM) to iteratively refine the radar channel G (or H) and the\ntransmitted signal X under convex constraints, incorporating both smooth and\nnon-smooth penalty terms via proximal operators. By enforcing a bounded\nperturbation model for the radar channel and a strict transmit power budget,\nthe algorithm aligns well with practical hardware limits. Extensive simulations\ndemonstrate that the proposed approach reliably addresses the dual-blind\ndeconvolution challenge, resulting in effective radar channel estimation and\nrobust communication performance. Notably, the framework's iterative structure\nreadily accommodates hardware considerations and different system\nconfigurations, making it well-suited for emerging mmWave JRC scenarios. Its\nadaptability and computational efficiency highlight the potential for wider\nadoption in next-generation wireless networks, where radar detection and\ncommunications increasingly share bandwidth and hardware resources.",
