Initially developed for ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and\nlater extended to partial differential equations (PDEs), it has found\napplications in control theory, biological systems, fluid dynamics, quantum\nmechanics, finance, and machine learning. This paper extends Carleman\nlinearization to differential-algebraic equation (DAE) systems by introducing\nauxiliary functions and projecting the resulting system onto a higher-order ODE\nrepresentation.

It\nseparately captures coarse and fine features and integrates them to achieve\nhighly generalizable performance across diverse unseen real-world scenes.\nConcretely, the dual-branch model consists of a pretrained branch to capture\nsemantically invariant representations and a learnable branch to extract\nfine-grained discriminative features, which are then merged into a whole by a\ncontrollable factor at the correlation level. Besides, considering that content\nalignment and structural preservation are often contradictory to each other, we\npropose a concept of virtual optimal planes to relieve this conflict. To this\nend, we model this problem as a process of estimating homography decomposition\ncoefficients, and design an iterative coefficient predictor and minimal\nsemantic distortion constraint to identify the optimal plane.

We use a planar crystal of six 138Ba+ ions, which\nexhibits two stable configurations depending on the aspect ratio of the\nharmonic trapping potential.

Most existing ETC studies neglect\nthis heating contribution, assuming ideal downstream collection. This work\nintegrates a one-dimensional collisionless plasma sheath model into a\ndiscretized leading-edge framework to predict surface potentials and\ncharged-particle fluxes. A parametric study examines how plasma and vehicle\nproperties affect ETC performance. Results reveal that passive ETC is\nsusceptible to thermionic space-charge overcompensation, which can reverse the\nintended cooling effect and cause surface heating at high plasma densities.\nFlowfield electron heating can be mitigated but not eliminated by using\ndielectric coatings or blunt geometries.

However, current 3D scene design still\nrelies heavily on extensive manual effort from creators, and existing automated\nmethods struggle to generate open-domain scenes or support flexible editing. As\na result, generating 3D worlds directly from text has garnered increasing\nattention. In this paper, we introduce HOLODECK 2.0, an advanced\nvision-language-guided framework for 3D world generation with support for\ninteractive scene editing based on human feedback. HOLODECK 2.0 can generate\ndiverse and stylistically rich 3D scenes (e.g., realistic, cartoon, anime, and\ncyberpunk styles) that exhibit high semantic fidelity to fine-grained input\ndescriptions, suitable for both indoor and open-domain environments. HOLODECK\n2.0 leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to identify and parse the objects\nrequired in a scene and generates corresponding high-quality assets via\nstate-of-the-art 3D generative models. It then iteratively applies spatial\nconstraints derived from the VLMs to achieve semantically coherent and\nphysically plausible layouts. Human evaluations and CLIP-based assessments\ndemonstrate that HOLODECK 2.0 effectively generates high-quality scenes closely\naligned with detailed textual descriptions, consistently outperforming\nbaselines across indoor and open-domain scenarios. Additionally, we provide\nediting capabilities that flexibly adapt to human feedback, supporting layout\nrefinement and style-consistent object edits.

However,\ncurrent cache-based TTA models store only a limited set of high-confidence\nsamples, restricting the decision boundary to these samples and ignoring the\ninfluence of other incoming test data. To address this, we propose Efficient\nTest-Time Adaptation (ETTA), introducing a Recursive Updating module that\nintegrates all incoming test samples, progressively refining the decision\nboundary. This strategy mimics an unbounded cache, dynamically updating\ncontextual embeddings for improved accuracy with minimal memory and\ncomputational overhead. ETTA also includes an Adaptive Ensemble module to\nreduce prompt dependency in image-to-text scores by dynamically selecting\noptimal prompts for each class. Furthermore, ETTA adaptively combines scores\nfrom both modules based on confidence levels, leveraging their complementary\nstrengths. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks confirm that ETTA surpasses\nthe state-of-the-art TTA models in computational complexity and accuracy,\nsetting a new standard for effective, efficient test-time adaptation.

    "abstract": "It is expected that a quantum theory of gravity will radically alter our\ncurrent notion of spacetime geometry. However, contrary to what was commonly\nassumed for many decades, quantum gravity effects could manifest in scales much\nlarger than the Planck Scale, provided that there is enough coherence in the\nsuperposition of geometries. Quantum Clocks, i.e. quantum mechanical systems\nwhose internal dynamics can keep track of proper-time lapses, are a very\npromising tool for probing such low-energy quantum gravity effects. In this\nwork, we contribute to this subject by proposing a spacetime-covariant\nformalism to describe clocks in first quantization. In particular, we account\nfor the possibility of dynamically accelerated clocks via suitable couplings\nwith external fields. We find that a particular decomposition of the\n(quadratic) clock Hamiltonian into positive- and negative-mass sectors, when\nattainable, enables one to compute the evolution of the system directly in\nterms of the clock's proper-time while maintaining explicit covariance. When\nthis decomposition is possible, the evolution obtained is always unitary, even\nwith couplings with external fields used to, e.g., accelerate the clocks. We\nthen apply this formulation to compute the joint time evolution of a pair of\nquantum clocks in two cases: (i) inertial clocks with relative motion and (ii)\ncharged clocks accelerated by a uniform magnetic field. In both cases, when our\nclocks are prepared in coherent states, we find that the density matrix\n$\\rho_{\\tau_2|\\tau_1}$ describing time-measurements of the two clocks yields\nnot only conditional probabilities whose peaks match exactly the classical\nexpected values for time dilation, but also yields coherent quantum\nfluctuations around that peak with a Gaussian profile.",

    "abstract": "Trap cropping is a pest management strategy where a grower plants an\nattractive \"trap crop\" alongside the primary crop to divert pests away from it.\nWe propose a simple framework for optimizing the proportion of a grower's field\nor greenhouse allocated to a main crop and a trap crop to maximize agricultural\nyield. We implement this framework using a model of pest movement governed by\ntrap crop attractiveness, the potential yield threatened by pests, and\nfunctional relationships between yield loss and pest density drawn from the\nliterature. Focusing on a simple case in which pests move freely across the\nfield and are attracted to traps solely by their relative attractiveness, we\nfind that allocating 5-20 percent of the landscape to trap plants is typically\nrequired to maximize yield and achieve effective pest control in the absence of\npesticides. For highly attractive trap plants, growers can devote less space\nbecause they are more effective; less attractive plants are ineffective even in\nlarge numbers. Intermediate attractiveness warrants the greatest investment in\ntrap cropping. Our framework offers a transparent and tractable approach for\nexploring trade-offs in pest management and can be extended to incorporate more\ncomplex pest behaviors, crop spatial configurations, and economic\nconsiderations.",

The main parameters are as follows: $M_{Aa} = 3.58 \\pm\n0.11$, $M_{Ab} = 1.68 \\pm 0.09$ (M$_\\odot$); $R_{Aa} = 2.17 \\pm 0.03$, $R_{Ab}\n= 1.51 \\pm 0.06$ (R$_\\odot$), and $T_{\\rm e Aa} = 13300 \\pm 500$, $T_{\\rm e Ab}\n= 7400 \\pm 500$ (K). We estimate approximate masses of the wide companions, Ba\nand Bb, as $M_{Ba} = 2.0$ and $M_{Bb} = 1.8$ (M$_\\odot$). The close binary's\norbital separation is $a= 8.51 \\pm 0.05$ (R$_\\odot$); its age is approximately\n$20$ Myr and distance $172 \\pm 1$ pc. The close binary's secondary (Ab) appears\nto be the source of low amplitude $ {\\delta}$ Scuti-type oscillations, although\nthe form of these oscillations is irregular and unrepetitive. Analysis of the $\n\\lambda$ 6678 He I profile of the primary show synchronism of the mean bodily\nand orbital rotations. The retention of significant orbital eccentricity, in\nview of the closeness of the A-system components, is unexpected and poses\nchallenges for the explanation that we discuss.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the stability of the flow past two side-by-side square\ncylinders (at Reynolds number 200 and gap ratio 1) using tools from dynamical\nsystems theory. The flow is highly irregular due to the complex interaction\nbetween the flapping jet emanating from the gap and the vortices shed in the\nwake. We first perform Spectral Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (SPOD) to\nunderstand the flow characteristics. We then conduct Lyapunov stability\nanalysis by linearizing the Navier-Stokes equations around the irregular base\nflow and find that it has two positive Lyapunov exponents. The Covariant\nLyapunov Vectors (CLVs) are also computed. Contours of the time-averaged CLVs\nreveal that the footprint of the leading CLV is in the near-wake, whereas the\nother CLVs peak further downstream, indicating distinct regions of instability.\nSPOD of the two unstable CLVs is then employed to extract the dominant coherent\nstructures and oscillation frequencies in the tangent space. For the leading\nCLV, the two dominant frequencies match closely with the prevalent frequencies\nin the drag coefficient spectrum, and correspond to instabilities due to vortex\nshedding and jet-flapping. The second unstable CLV captures the subharmonic\ninstability of the shedding frequency. Global linear stability analysis (GLSA)\nof the time-averaged flow identifies a neutral eigenmode that resembles the\nleading SPOD mode of the first CLV, with a very similar structure and\nfrequency. However, while GLSA predicts neutrality, Lyapunov analysis reveals\nthat this direction is unstable, exposing the inherent limitations of the GLSA\nwhen applied to chaotic flows.",

Due to this, several studies have proposed different\ntypes of statistical models to predict the outcome of a football match.\nHowever, most existing approaches usually assume that the offensive and\ndefensive abilities of teams remain static over time. We introduce a Bayesian\ndynamic approach for football goal based models that uses period-specific\ncommensurate priors to flexibly weight the evolution of attacking and defensive\nabilities. Our approach assigns separate, time varying precisions for each\nability and period, controlled via spike and slab hyperpriors. This adaptive\nshrinkage borrows information about teams' strength when past and current\nperformance aligns and allows rapid adjustments when teams experience\nsubstantial changes (e.g., transfer windows or coaching changes). We integrate\nthis framework into six standard goal based models evaluating predictive\nperformance using data from the last five seasons of the German Bundesliga,\nEnglish Premier League, and Spanish La Liga. Compared with the other discrete\ntime dynamic models, our adaptive approach yields better predictive\nperformance.

While much of\nthe existing literature has focused on idealized configurations with regularly\nspaced roughness elements, real-world surfaces often feature irregularities,\nclustering, and topographic complexity for which the secondary flow response\nremains poorly understood. To address this gap, we investigate multi-column\nroughness configurations that serve as a regularized analog of roughness\nclustering. Using large-eddy simulations, we systematically examine the effects\nof cluster density and local arrangement on secondary flows, and observe that\nvarying the cluster density gives rise to distinct secondary flow polarities.\nThrough a systematic parameter study, we identify the spanwise gap between the\nedge-most roughness elements of adjacent columns, normalized by the channel\nhalf-height, as a key geometric factor governing this polarity. In addition to\nanalyzing the time-averaged structure, we investigate how variations in\npolarity affect the instantaneous dynamics of secondary flows. Here, we find\nthat the regions of high- and low-momentum fluid created by the secondary flows\nalternate in a chaotic, non-periodic manner over time. Further analysis of the\nvertical velocity signal shows that variability in vertical momentum transport\nis a persistent and intrinsic feature of secondary flow dynamics. Taken\ntogether, these findings provide a comprehensive picture of how the geometric\narrangement of roughness elements governs both the mean structure and temporal\nbehavior of secondary flows.",

    "abstract": "One of the challenging problems in Music Information Retrieval is the\nacquisition of enough non-copyrighted audio recordings for model training and\nevaluation. This study compares two Transformer-based neural network models for\nchord sequence recognition in audio recordings and examines the effectiveness\nof using an artificially generated dataset for this purpose. The models are\ntrained on various combinations of Artificial Audio Multitracks (AAM),\nSchubert's Winterreise Dataset, and the McGill Billboard Dataset and evaluated\nwith three metrics: Root, MajMin and Chord Content Metric (CCM). The\nexperiments prove that even though there are certainly differences in\ncomplexity and structure between artificially generated and human-composed\nmusic, the former can be useful in certain scenarios. Specifically, AAM can\nenrich a smaller training dataset of music composed by a human or can even be\nused as a standalone training set for a model that predicts chord sequences in\npop music, if no other data is available.",

    "abstract": "Over the past thirty years, the vehicle routing problem with stochastic\ndemands has emerged as a canonical application of the integer L-shaped method,\nleading to an extensive body of literature and several methodological\nrefinements. Recently, the disaggregated integer L-shaped (DL-shaped) method,\nwhich decomposes the recourse function by customer rather than treating it as\nan aggregate cost, has been proposed and successfully applied under the\ndetour-to-depot recourse policy. However, the validity of this new approach and\nits generalizability to other policies have not been thoroughly investigated.\nIn this work, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the validity\nof the DL-shaped method, namely, the superadditivity of the recourse function\nunder concatenation. We demonstrate that the optimal restocking policy\nsatisfies this superadditivity property. Moreover, we rectify an incorrect\nargument from the original paper on the DL-shaped method to rigorously\nestablish its validity under the detour-to-depot policy. We then develop a\nDL-shaped algorithm tailored to the optimal restocking policy. Our algorithm\nexploits new dynamic programming-based lower bounds on the optimal restocking\nrecourse function. We also introduce new valid inequalities that generalize the\noriginal DL-shaped cuts and speed up computations by an order of magnitude.\nComputational experiments show that our DL-shaped algorithm significantly\noutperforms the state-of-the-art integer L-shaped algorithm from the\nliterature. We solve several open instances to optimality, including 14\nsingle-vehicle instances, which constitute the most challenging variant of the\nproblem.",

In addition to maintaining acceptable collision\nrisks, this approach seeks to minimize the average fuel consumption of CAMs by\nmaking early maneuver decisions. We model CAM as a continuous state, discrete\naction and finite horizon MDP, where the critical decision is determining when\nto initiate the maneuver. The MDP model also incorporates analytical models for\nconjunction risk, propellant consumption, and transit orbit geometry. The\nMarkov policy effectively trades-off maneuver delay-which improves the\nreliability of conjunction risk indicators-with propellant consumption-which\nincreases with decreasing maneuver time. Using historical data of tracked\nconjunction events, we verify this framework and conduct an extensive ablation\nstudy on the hyper-parameters used within the MDP. On synthetic conjunction\nevents, the trained policy significantly minimizes both the overall and average\npropellant consumption per CAM when compared to a conventional cut-off policy\nthat initiates maneuvers 24 hours before the time of closest approach (TCA). On\nhistorical conjunction events, the trained policy consumes more propellant\noverall but reduces the average propellant consumption per CAM. For both\nhistorical and synthetic conjunction events, the trained policy achieves equal\nif not higher overall collision risk guarantees.",

High-speed schlieren visualizations and\nnon-time-resolved PIV measurements are performed to obtain experimental\ndatasets for validating the modelling strategy. The RANS solutions are found to\nbe in good quantitative agreement with the PIV mean-flow measurements,\nconfirming the ability of the approach to capture the interaction between jets\nat the mean-flow level. The obtained wavepackets consist of toroidal and\nflapping fluctuations of the twin-jet system, and show similarities with those\nof single axisymmetric jets. However, for the case of closely-spaced jets, they\nexhibit deviations in the phase speed of structures travelling in the outer\nmixing layer and those travelling in the inner one, leading to different\nnon-axisymmetric behaviours. In particular, toroidal twin-jet wavepackets\nfeature tilted ring-like structures with respect to the jet axis, while\nflapping twin-jet wavepackets are distorted and lose the clean checkerboard\npattern typically observed in $m = 1$ modes in axisymmetric jets. A\nquantitative comparison of the modelled wavepackets with experimentally-educed\ncoherent structures is performed in terms of their structural agreement\nmeasured through an alignment coefficient, providing a first validation of the\nmodelling strategy.

    "abstract": "Market making is a popular trading strategy, which aims to generate profit\nfrom the spread between the quotes posted at either side of the market. It has\nbeen shown that training market makers (MMs) with adversarial reinforcement\nlearning allows to overcome the risks due to changing market conditions and to\nlead to robust performances. Prior work assumes, however, that MMs keep quoting\nthroughout the trading process, but in practice this is not required, even for\n``registered'' MMs (that only need to satisfy quoting ratios defined by the\nmarket rules). In this paper, we build on this line of work and enrich the\nstrategy space of the MM by allowing to occasionally not quote or provide\nsingle-sided quotes. Towards this end, in addition to the MM agents that\nprovide continuous bid-ask quotes, we have designed two new agents with\nincreasingly richer action spaces. The first has the option to provide bid-ask\nquotes or refuse to quote. The second has the option to provide bid-ask quotes,\nrefuse to quote, or only provide single-sided ask or bid quotes. We employ a\nmodel-driven approach to empirically compare the performance of the\ncontinuously quoting MM with the two agents above in various types of\nadversarial environments. We demonstrate how occasional refusal to provide\nbid-ask quotes improves returns and/or Sharpe ratios. The quoting ratios of\nwell-trained MMs can basically meet any market requirements, reaching up to\n99.9$\\%$ in some cases.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain technology offers a promising foundation for modernizing E-Voting\nsystems by enhancing transparency, decentralization, and security. Yet,\nreal-world adoption remains limited due to persistent challenges such as\nscalability constraints, high computational demands, and complex privacy\nrequirements. This paper presents a comparative framework for analyzing\nblockchain-based E-Voting architectures, consensus mechanisms, and\ncryptographic protocols. We examine the limitations of prevalent models like\nProof of Work, Proof of Stake, and Delegated Proof of Stake, and propose\noptimization strategies that include hybrid consensus, lightweight\ncryptography, and decentralized identity management. Additionally, we explore\nthe novel role of Large Language Models (LLMs) in smart contract generation,\nanomaly detection, and user interaction. Our findings offer a foundation for\ndesigning secure, scalable, and intelligent blockchain-based E-Voting systems\nsuitable for national-scale deployment. This work lays the groundwork for\nbuilding an end-to-end blockchain E-Voting prototype enhanced by LLM-guided\nsmart contract generation and validation, supported by a systematic framework\nand simulation-based analysis.",

We focus\non conditions in which the large-scale axisymmetric filaments typically\nassociated with the streaming instability (SI) either cannot form or have not\nyet developed. Under these circumstances, we observe small-scale particle\nclumping consistent with turbulent concentration (TC), in which short particle\nfilaments collect along regions of high gas strain rate and enclose gas-only\nvoids exhibiting coherent vorticity. Despite varying particle Stokes numbers\n$\\St_K$ which are defined relative to the Keplerian frequency, the {\\it\neffective} Stokes numbers within voids, $\\St_\\omega$ -- defined instead\nrelative to the local gas vorticity -- consistently center around 0.3. The\nlatter coincides with the special value identified in prior statistical studies\nof TC as the scale where particle clustering is most intermittent. This\nconvergence likely reflects how particle feedback structures and sustains voids\n-- an effect possibly distinctive to axisymmetric configurations. A timescale\ncomparison reveals that in simulations with midplane particle-to-gas density\nratios below unity and $\\St_K \\ll 1$, SI growth rates are 1 -- 2 orders of\nmagnitude slower than the turbulent overturn frequencies at the driving scale.\nThis disparity appears to effectively rule out SI as the primary driver of\nturbulence in these cases.

If\nthis is the case, changes in the orbital light curve would be expected\nthroughout the long cycle. We conducted a detailed photometric analysis of the\nlight curves of 134 Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) DPVs to investigate variations\nin the morphology of the orbital light curves as a function of the long-cycle\nphase. We separated the two photometric cycles from the Optical Gravitational\nLensing Experiment (OGLE) I band light curves for the systems. We thus compared\nthe orbital light curves at opposite long-cycle phases, investigated the\nstability of the long period, and analysed the residuals of the separation\nprocess to search for significant frequencies above a 1% false-alarm\nprobability threshold. We confirm that the DPVs OGLE-LMC-DPV-097 and\nOGLE-BLG-ECL-157529 change most strongly in their orbital light curves\nthroughout the long cycle. By comparison, about 50% of the sample exhibits\nmoderate morphological variations, in particular, around orbital phase 0.5.\nThis is likely associated with structural changes in the accretion discs. In\naddition, we identified 18 DPVs with variable long periods, including 10 new\ncases. In some of them, the long period either increases or decreases\ncontinuously over time. For the first time, we found DPV systems that alternate\nbetween the two behaviours at different epochs. Moreover, we detected\nfrequencies in the residuals that might be directly related to changes in the\nmorphology of the orbital curves.

Semidefinite programming (SDP)\nhierarchies, such as the Doherty-Parrilo-Spedalieri (DPS) and Extension (EXT)\nhierarchies, offer complete methods for entanglement detection, but their\npractical use is limited by exponential growth in problem size. In this paper,\nwe introduce a new SDP hierarchy, PST, that is sandwiched between EXT and\nDPS--offering a tighter approximation to the set of separable states than EXT,\nwhile incurring lower computational overhead than DPS.\n  We develop compact, polynomially-scalable descriptions of EXT and PST using\npartition mappings and operators. These descriptions in turn yield formulations\nthat satisfy desirable properties such as the Slater condition and are\nwell-suited to both first-order methods (FOMs) and interior-point methods\n(IPMs). We design a suite of entanglement detection algorithms: three FOMs\n(Frank-Wolfe, projected gradient, and fast projected gradient) based on a\nleast-squares formulation, and a custom primal-dual IPM based on a conic\nprogramming formulation. These methods are numerically stable and capable of\nproducing entanglement witnesses or proximity measures, even in cases where\nstates lie near the boundary of separability.\n  Numerical experiments on benchmark quantum states demonstrate that our\nalgorithms improve the ability to solve deeper levels of the SDP hierarchy. In\nparticular, the PST hierarchy combined with FOMs enables scalable and effective\nentanglement detection in relatively easy instances, while our IPM approach\noffers robustness and early witness recovery for the more difficult ones.

    "abstract": "Vision Transformers have substantially advanced the capabilities of\nsegmentation models across both image and video domains. Among them, the Swin\nTransformer stands out for its ability to capture hierarchical, multi-scale\nrepresentations, making it a popular backbone for segmentation in videos.\nHowever, despite its window-attention scheme, it still incurs a high\ncomputational cost, especially in larger variants commonly used for dense\nprediction in videos. This remains a major bottleneck for real-time,\nresource-constrained applications. Whilst token reduction methods have been\nproposed to alleviate this, the window-based attention mechanism of Swin\nrequires a fixed number of tokens per window, limiting the applicability of\nconventional pruning techniques. Meanwhile, training-free token clustering\napproaches have shown promise in image segmentation while maintaining window\nconsistency. Nevertheless, they fail to exploit temporal redundancy, missing a\nkey opportunity to further optimize video segmentation performance. We\nintroduce Temporal Cluster Assignment (TCA), a lightweight and effective,\nfine-tuning-free strategy that enhances token clustering by leveraging temporal\ncoherence across frames. Instead of indiscriminately dropping redundant tokens,\nTCA refines token clusters using temporal correlations, thereby retaining\nfine-grained details while significantly reducing computation. Extensive\nevaluations on YouTube-VIS 2019, YouTube-VIS 2021, OVIS, and a private surgical\nvideo dataset show that TCA consistently boosts the accuracy-speed trade-off of\nexisting clustering-based methods.

Commonly, these relations are derived from\nutilizing various realistic nuclear cold hadronic, hyperonic, and hybrid EoS\nmodels, each of which should obey the current constraints and cover a wide\nrange of stiffnesses. Concurrently, the field of multimessenger astronomy has\nbeen significantly enhanced by the advent of gravitational wave astronomy,\nwhich increasingly incorporates deep learning techniques and algorithms. At the\nsame time, X-ray spectral data from NICER based on known pulsars are available,\nand additional observations are expected from upcoming missions. In this study,\nwe revisit established universal relations, introduce new ones, and reassess\nthem using a feed-forward neural network as a regression model. More\nspecifically, we mainly propose ``deep'' EoS-insensitive hypersurface relations\nfor rapidly rotating compact objects between several of the star's global\nparameters, which achieve an accuracy of within $1\\%$ in most cases, with only\na small fraction of investigated models exceeding this threshold. While\nanalytical expressions can be used to represent some of these relations, the\nneural network approach demonstrates superior performance, particularly in\ncomplex regions of the parameter space. Furthermore, we use the SHapley\nAdditive exPlanations (SHAP) method to interpret the suggested network's\npredictions, since is based on a strong theoretical framework inspired by the\nfield of cooperative Game Theory.

The analysis method is first\nverified with synthetic data and then applied to laser-driven experiments of\nsingle and double plume expansion collected at the OMEGA EP Laser Facility. The\ncalculated densities agree with 1D results and are shown to be consistent with\nthe original AFR measurements via forward modeling. We also discuss how\nadditional measurements could improve the precision of this technique.",

    "abstract": "Textual Attribute Graphs (TAGs) are critical for modeling complex networks\nlike citation networks, but effective node classification remains challenging\ndue to difficulties in integrating rich semantics from text with structural\ngraph information. Existing methods often struggle with capturing nuanced\ndomain-specific terminology, modeling long-range dependencies, adapting to\ntemporal evolution, and scaling to massive datasets. To address these issues,\nwe propose a novel framework that integrates TAPE (Text-Attributed Graph\nRepresentation Enhancement) with Graphormer. Our approach leverages a large\nlanguage model (LLM), specifically ChatGPT, within the TAPE framework to\ngenerate semantically rich explanations from paper content, which are then\nfused into enhanced node representations. These embeddings are combined with\nstructural features using a novel integration layer with learned attention\nweights. Graphormer's path-aware position encoding and multi-head attention\nmechanisms are employed to effectively capture long-range dependencies across\nthe citation network. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework on the\nchallenging ogbn-arxiv dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance with a\nclassification accuracy of 0.772, significantly surpassing the best GCN\nbaseline of 0.713. Our method also yields strong results in precision (0.671),\nrecall (0.577), and F1-score (0.610). We validate our approach through\ncomprehensive ablation studies that quantify the contribution of each\ncomponent, demonstrating the synergy between semantic and structural\ninformation. Our framework provides a scalable and robust solution for node\nclassification in dynamic TAGs, offering a promising direction for future\nresearch in knowledge systems and scientific discovery.",

    "abstract": "Recently Amdeberhan, Sellers, and Singh introduced a new infinite family of\npartition functions called generalized cubic partitions. Given a positive\ninteger $d$, they let $a_d(n)$ be the counting function for partitions of $n$\nin which the odd parts are unrestricted and the even parts are $d$-colored.\nThese partitions are natural generalizations of Chan's notion of cubic\npartitions, as they coincide when $d=2.$ Many Ramanujan-like congruences exist\nin the literature for cubic partitions, and in their work Amdeberhan, Sellers,\nand Singh proved a collection of congruences satisfied by $a_d(n)$ for various\n$d \\geq 1$, including an infinite family with prime moduli. Our goal in this\npaper is to prove a family of congruences modulo powers of 5 for $a_3(n)$. More\nspecifically, our main theorem asserts \\[a_3\\left(5^{2\\alpha}n +\\gamma_{\\alpha}\n\\right) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5^\\alpha},\\] where \\[\\gamma_{\\alpha} = 20 + \\frac{19\n\\cdot 25 (25^{\\alpha-1}-1)}{24}.\\] In order to prove these congruences, we use\nan approach centered around modular functions, as in the seminal work of Watson\nand Atkin on proving Ramanujan's congruences for the partition function $p(n)$.\nHowever, due to the complexity of the modular curve $X_0(10)$ associated to our\nmodular functions, the classical method cannot be directly applied. Rather, we\nutilize the very recently developed localization method of Banerjee and Smoot,\nwhich is designed to treat congruence families over more complicated modular\ncurves, such as $X_0(10).$",

N = 110 research participants completed two\ndifferent interviews: structured diagnostic and life history interviews.

When Mirror\nand Non-Mirror model-predicted structured interview depression scores were\ncorrelated with self-reported depression symptoms, Mirror and NonMirror\nperformed the same (e.g., r = ~.54), indicating that Mirror models contain bias\nperhaps due to criterion contamination.

This growth makes load\nbalancing a key part of cloud systems, as it helps distribute user requests\nacross servers to maintain performance, prevent overload, and ensure a smooth\nuser experience. Despite its importance, managing server resources and keeping\nworkloads balanced over time remains a major challenge in cloud environments.\nThis paper introduces a novel Score-Based Dynamic Load Balancer (SBDLB) that\nallocates workloads to virtual machines based on real-time performance metrics.\nThe objective is to enhance resource utilization and overall system efficiency.\nThe method was thoroughly tested using the CloudSim 7G platform, comparing its\nperformance against the throttled load balancing strategy. Evaluations were\nconducted across a variety of workloads and scenarios, demonstrating the\nSBDLB's ability to adapt dynamically to workload fluctuations while optimizing\nresource usage. The proposed method outperformed the throttled strategy,\nimproving average response times by 34% and 37% in different scenarios. It also\nreduced data center processing times by an average of 13%. Over a 24-hour\nsimulation, the method decreased operational costs by 15%, promoting a more\nenergy-efficient and sustainable cloud infrastructure through reduced energy\nconsumption.",

    "abstract": "Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE) is a key primitive in quantum computing,\nbut its standard implementation using Quantum Phase Estimation is\nresource-intensive, requiring a large number of coherent qubits in a single\ncircuit block to achieve high precision. This presents a significant challenge\nfor near-term Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. To address this,\nwe introduce the Adaptive Windowed Quantum Amplitude Estimation (AWQAE)\nframework, a modular, scalable and adaptive approach that decouples estimation\nprecision from the number of physical qubits required in a single circuit.\nAWQAE operates by iteratively estimating the phase bits in small, fixed-size\nchunks, using a number of smaller, independent quantum circuits, which are\namenable to parallel processing. A key technical contribution of this work is\nintroduction of a phase resolution circuit and an ancilla-guided mechanism that\nenables accurate chunk assignment and eigenphase reconstruction in the presence\nof multiple eigenstates. This design is inherently NISQ-friendly, by lowering\ncircuit depth and qubit count per block to reduce decoherence and noise\neffects. A key component of our approach is a robust classical post-processing\nalgorithm that resolves measurement ambiguities that arise during the iterative\nprocess. This post-processing routine uses a least-significant-bit\n(LSB)-to-most-significant-bit (MSB) correction to reconstruct the full,\nhigh-precision phase estimate, ensuring accuracy. By combining a modular\nquantum-classical loop with an ambiguity-aware reconstruction method, AWQAE\noffers a powerful and flexible solution for performing high-precision QAE on\nresource-constrained quantum hardware. Our approach demonstrates enhanced\nscalability, and adaptability, making it a promising candidate for practical\napplications of QAE in the NISQ era.",

A review of 89 carefully\nselected studies showed 365 distinct urban morphology measures, with\nsignificant variation in names, interpretations, and data formats.

Here, we investigate the hypothesized benefit of fleeting\nmemory for language learning in tightly controlled experiments on transformer\nlanguage models. Training transformers with and without fleeting memory on a\ndevelopmentally realistic training set, we find that fleeting memory\nconsistently improves language learning (as quantified by both overall language\nmodelling performance and targeted syntactic evaluation) but, unexpectedly,\nimpairs surprisal-based prediction of human reading times. Interestingly,\nfollow up analyses revealed that this discrepancy - better language modeling,\nyet worse reading time prediction - could not be accounted for by prior\nexplanations of why better language models sometimes fit human reading time\nworse.

However, real-world utility data originates from multiple sources\nwith varying characteristics and levels of quality. In this work, developed in\ncollaboration with Oncor Electric Delivery, we propose a scalable framework\nthat reconstructs a trustworthy grid topology by systematically integrating\nheterogeneous data. We observe that distribution topology is fundamentally\ngoverned by two complementary dimensions: the spatial layout of physical\ninfrastructure (e.g., GIS and asset metadata) and the dynamic behavior of the\nsystem in the signal domain (e.g., voltage time series). When jointly\nleveraged, these dimensions support a complete and physically coherent\nreconstruction of network connectivity. To address the challenge of uneven data\nquality without compromising observability, we introduce a confidence-aware\ninference mechanism that preserves structurally informative yet imperfect\ninputs, while quantifying the reliability of each inferred connection for\noperator interpretation.

Together, these components\nensure that inference is both uncertainty-aware and structurally valid,\nenabling rapid convergence to actionable, trustworthy topologies under\nreal-world deployment conditions.

    "abstract": "In statistical process control Weibull distribution can be used to model the\ntime between events or failures (TBE) in a process with increasing decreasing\nor constant failure rates. Specifically it helps in monitoring processes where\nthe time between defect occurrences is of interest providing insight into the\nprocess reliability and performance. In this paper we consider the two sided\nproblem of monitoring either an increase or a decrease in the scale parameter\nof the Weibull distribution with control charts assuming the shape parameter to\nbe fixed. A larger scale parameter indicates that events are more spread out\nover time suggesting fewer defects while a smaller value may suggest\ndeterioration in the process resulting in a higher number of defects. When the\nscale parameter is unknown it is estimated from Phase I observations and the\nplug in control limits are obtained by replacing the parameter by its estimated\nvalue from the Phase I observations. Given the well accepted fact that\nestimated control limits often do not perform as expected, the control limits\nof the Weibull chart are adjusted to achieve the desired in control (IC)\nperformance using two criteria that are conditional average run length and\nstandard deviation of conditional ARL. A performance study is carried out in\norder to assess in control and out of control performances of the proposed\ncharts.",

These conditions involve a particular property of the so-called\nfrustration graph of the Hamiltonian, namely that it must be claw-free.\nAdditionally, one set of sufficient conditions also requires the absence of\nso-called even holes. In this paper, we present a model with disguised free\nfermions where the frustration graph contains both claws and even holes.\nSpecial relations between coupling constants ensure that the free fermionic\nproperty still holds. The transfer matrix of this model can be factorized in a\nspecial case, thereby proving the conjectured free fermionic nature of a\nspecial quantum circuit published recently by two of the present authors.

We outline specific mechanisms for ensuring\nsafety, including: (1) explicit separation of beliefs and preferences in\nnatural language, (2) bounded rationality through resource-aware free energy\nminimization, and (3) compositional safety through modular agent structures.\nThe paper concludes with a research agenda centered on the Abstraction and\nReasoning Corpus (ARC) benchmark, proposing experiments to validate our\nframework's safety properties.

We took care to include stars at\nlatitudes below and above -25 degrees to allow observations for all wind\ndirections at the location of the ELT. The spectra were analysed using model\nfluxes from 3D pure-hydrogen local thermodynamic equilibrium model atmospheres\nand multi-band photometry.

Due to this torrent of information\nand the need to analyze it exhaustively, the main aim of this paper is to\nintroduce the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) as a complement to traditional\ncosmological data analysis. The PSO is one of the most representative\nBio-inspired algorithms as provides excellent robustness in high-dimensional or\ncomplex problems with relative simplicity and small number of parameters during\nthe implementation. In this work we implemented two versions of the canonical\nPSO algorithm: global best and local best, to explore dark energy models in the\nlight of Type Ia Supernovae and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations observations, in\nparticular, DESI and DESI+Union3 datasets. The results achieved validate the\nperformance of the PSO algorithm in finding the best-fit parameters from\nobservational data and confirm that PSO, under certain conditions, can deliver\ncompetitive results, at a fraction of time, compared to standard MCMC methods.\nFinally, the PSO output can also serve as a valuable input to the MCMC methods\nto speed up its analysis.",

This underscores the urgent need for effective machine\nunlearning, i.e., removing specific knowledge or concepts from pretrained\nmodels without compromising overall performance. One possible approach is\nLow-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), which offers an efficient means to fine-tune models\nfor targeted unlearning. However, LoRA often inadvertently alters unrelated\ncontent, leading to diminished image fidelity and realism. To address this\nlimitation, we introduce UnGuide -- a novel approach which incorporates\nUnGuidance, a dynamic inference mechanism that leverages Classifier-Free\nGuidance (CFG) to exert precise control over the unlearning process. UnGuide\nmodulates the guidance scale based on the stability of a few first steps of\ndenoising processes, enabling selective unlearning by LoRA adapter. For prompts\ncontaining the erased concept, the LoRA module predominates and is\ncounterbalanced by the base model; for unrelated prompts, the base model\ngoverns generation, preserving content fidelity. Empirical results demonstrate\nthat UnGuide achieves controlled concept removal and retains the expressive\npower of diffusion models, outperforming existing LoRA-based methods in both\nobject erasure and explicit content removal tasks.",

    "abstract": "Current and upcoming cosmological surveys will produce unprecedented amounts\nof high-dimensional data, which require complex high-fidelity forward\nsimulations to accurately model both physical processes and systematic effects\nwhich describe the data generation process. However, validating whether our\ntheoretical models accurately describe the observed datasets remains a\nfundamental challenge. An additional complexity to this task comes from\nchoosing appropriate representations of the data which retain all the relevant\ncosmological information, while reducing the dimensionality of the original\ndataset. In this work we present a novel framework combining scale-dependent\nneural summary statistics with normalizing flows to detect model\nmisspecification in cosmological simulations through Bayesian evidence\nestimation. By conditioning our neural network models for data compression and\nevidence estimation on the smoothing scale, we systematically identify where\ntheoretical models break down in a data-driven manner. We demonstrate a first\napplication to our approach using matter and gas density fields from three\nCAMELS simulation suites with different subgrid physics implementations.",

    "abstract": "Binary supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are consequences of galaxy mergers\nand dominate the low-frequency gravitational wave background. Finding binary\nSMBHs in existing time-domain observations has proven difficult, as their\nperiodic, electromagnetic signals can be confused with the natural variability\nof single quasars. In this work, we investigate the effects of host-galaxy\ncontamination and survey design (cadence and duration) on the detectability of\nbinary SMBHs with the upcoming Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and\nTime (LSST). We simulate millions of LSST light curves of single and binary\nquasars, with a distribution of quasar and host-galaxy properties motivated by\nempirical observations and the anticipated LSST detection space. We then apply\nsimple sinusoidal curve fits as a potential, computationally inexpensive\ndetection method. We find that host-galaxy contamination will increase\nfalse-positive rates and decrease binary parameter recovery rates. Lower mass,\nlower luminosity binary systems are most likely to be negatively affected by\nhost galaxy contamination. We also find that monitoring duration affects binary\ndetection more than survey effective cadence for this detection method. As the\nlight curve duration increases, false-positive rates are suppressed and binary\nparameter recovery rates, especially for binary period, are improved.\nIncreasing the light curve duration from 5 to 10 yrs shows the most dramatic\nimprovement for successful binary detection and false-positive rejection, with\nadditional improvement from extending the light curve duration to 20 yrs. The\nobservation duration increase is especially critical for recovering binary\nperiods that are longer than a decade.",

    "abstract": "A comprehensive account of the cosmic star-formation history demands an\naccurate census of dust-enshrouded star formation over cosmic time. We provide\nstrong new constraints from a large sample of 777 red galaxies, selected based\non their dust-reddened, rest-frame UV-optical emission. This sample of 777\ngalaxies spans $1 < z < 8$ and is selected from PRIMER JWST NIRCam and HST\nCOSMOS optical data, ensuring robust colour criteria. The SEDs indicate that\nthese dust-reddened galaxies are star-forming, with median $\\mathrm{SFR \\sim\n40M_{\\odot}yr^{-1}}$ and stellar mass $\\log(M_{*}/M_{\\odot}) =\n10.3^{+0.6}_{-0.8}$; each exceeds the corresponding medians of the full\nJWST-detected population by over two dex. Our sample thus clearly shows that\nred galaxies dominate the high-mass end: they comprise 72 \\% of galaxies with\n$\\log(M/M_{\\odot}) > 10$ at $z = 3.3$, rising to 91\\% by $z \\sim 7$ (albeit\nwith large uncertainties at the highest redshifts). Crucially, we find that the\nnumber density of massive red star-forming galaxies at $z \\sim 6$ is sufficient\nto explain the abundance of quiescent galaxies at $z > 3$, consistent with\ntypical quenching timescales allowed in the $\\mathrm{\\sim 1Gyr}$ interval from\n$z \\sim 6$ to $z \\sim 3$. This large abundance yields a substantial\ncontribution to the cosmic star-formation rate density: at $z \\sim 4$, red\ngalaxies provide $\\mathrm {\\rho_{SFR} = 3.9^{+0.6}_{-0.5} \\times 10^{-2}\nM_{\\odot} yr^{-1}Mpc^{-3}}$, and at $z \\sim 5$ they supply nearly 40 \\% of the\ntotal $\\rho_{SFR}$. This exceeds the contribution of bright sub(mm)-selected\ndusty star-forming galaxies by more than an order of magnitude. Future deeper\nand wider ALMA surveys will provide further opportunities to strengthen and\nextend our results in our quest to fully quantify the contribution of\ndust-obscured activity to $\\rho_{\\mathrm{SFR}}$ at high redshifts.",

This work proposes a framework for DMFT calculations on\nquantum computers, focusing on near-term applications.

We demonstrate the convergence of the\nDMFT algorithm using the Gaussian subspace in a noise-free setting, and show\nthe hardware viability of the circuit compression by extracting the impurity\nGreen's function on IBM quantum processors for a single impurity coupled to\nthree bath orbitals (8 physical qubits and 1 ancilla).

We use radiative transfer simulations of\nreionization that capture the distribution of ionized gas in the $z = 13$ IGM\nto investigate the implications of JADES-GS-z13-1-LA for reionization. We find\nthat if JADES-GS-z13-1-LA is a typical star forming galaxy (SFG) with\nproperties characteristic of LAEs at $z \\sim 6$, its detection suggests that\nthe universe is $\\gtrsim 5\\%$ ionized by $z = 13$.

Using a simple analysis based on the fact that AGN are expected to produce\nmore ionizing photons than SFGs, we estimate that the likelihood that\nJADES-GS-z13-1-LA hosts an AGN is $88\\%$, $66\\%$, and $33\\%$ if the IGM is $<\n1\\%$, $\\approx 5\\%$ and $\\approx 25\\%$ ionized, respectively.

    "abstract": "Stellar streams around the Milky Way (MW) can provide valuable insights into\nits history and substructure formation. Previous studies have suggested that\nseveral MW streams could have an origin related to that of the disc of\nsatellite galaxies (DoS) and the young halo globular clusters of the MW, given\nthat many of these structures present a similar orbital pole orientation. In\nthis work we test the validity of this hypothesis by revising the orbital pole\ndistribution of the MW streams with the latest stream dataset (galstreams). For\na sample of 91 streams at Galactocentric distances of $d<100$ kpc we find that\nthe pole distribution has no preferred orbital direction. However, as we\nsubtract the streams closer to the Galactic centre, by imposing several lower\ndistance cuts, we find that the larger the Galactocentric distance of the\nstreams, the higher the fraction of stream poles pointing in a direction\nsimilar to the DoS. This trend could be explained if the stream pole\ndistribution were originally anisotropic, but precession effects displaced the\norbital poles of the streams closer to the Galactic centre. From the pole\ndistribution and the estimated precession rates of the streams in the sample,\nwe infer that the streams nearer the Galactic centre are indeed quite likely to\nbe affected by precession. Finally, we corroborate with hydrodynamical\nsimulations that, even in a scenario in which the MW substructures had a common\norigin, an overdensity in their orbital pole direction cannot be appreciated\nuntil the selected sample also includes material at $d \\gtrsim 150$ kpc.",

    "abstract": "Augmented Reality (AR) enriches perception by overlaying virtual elements on\nthe physical world. Due to its growing popularity, cognitive attacks that alter\nAR content to manipulate users' semantic perception have received increasing\nattention. Existing detection methods often focus on visual changes, which are\nrestricted to pixel- or image-level processing and lack semantic reasoning\ncapabilities, or they rely on pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), which\nfunction as black-box approaches with limited interpretability. In this paper,\nwe present CADAR, a novel neurosymbolic approach for cognitive attack detection\nin AR. It fuses multimodal vision-language inputs using neural VLMs to obtain a\nsymbolic perception-graph representation, incorporating prior knowledge,\nsalience weighting, and temporal correlations. The model then enables\nparticle-filter based statistical reasoning -- a sequential Monte Carlo method\n-- to detect cognitive attacks. Thus, CADAR inherits the adaptability of\npre-trained VLM and the interpretability and reasoning rigor of particle\nfiltering. Experiments on an extended AR cognitive attack dataset show accuracy\nimprovements of up to 10.7% over strong baselines on challenging AR attack\nscenarios, underscoring the promise of neurosymbolic methods for effective and\ninterpretable cognitive attack detection.",

However, research progress in academia has been hindered by the\nlack of publicly available datasets that accurately reflect the dynamic nature\nof live streaming environments. To address this gap, we introduce KuaiLive, the\nfirst real-time, interactive dataset collected from Kuaishou, a leading live\nstreaming platform in China with over 400 million daily active users. The\ndataset records the interaction logs of 23,772 users and 452,621 streamers over\na 21-day period. Compared to existing datasets, KuaiLive offers several\nadvantages: it includes precise live room start and end timestamps, multiple\ntypes of real-time user interactions (click, comment, like, gift), and rich\nside information features for both users and streamers. These features enable\nmore realistic simulation of dynamic candidate items and better modeling of\nuser and streamer behaviors. We conduct a thorough analysis of KuaiLive from\nmultiple perspectives and evaluate several representative recommendation\nmethods on it, establishing a strong benchmark for future research. KuaiLive\ncan support a wide range of tasks in the live streaming domain, such as top-K\nrecommendation, click-through rate prediction, watch time prediction, and gift\nprice prediction. Moreover, its fine-grained behavioral data also enables\nresearch on multi-behavior modeling, multi-task learning, and fairness-aware\nrecommendation.

In this work, we introduce the partial projected ensemble (PPE) as a\nframework to study how the spatiotemporal structure of scrambling is imprinted\non projected ensembles. The PPE consists of an ensemble of mixed states induced\non a subsystem by measurements on a spatially separated part of its complement,\ntracing out the remainder, naturally capturing scenarios involving discarded\noutcomes or noise-induced losses. We show that statistical fluctuations of the\nPPE faithfully track the causal lightcone of information spreading, revealing\nhow scrambling dynamics are encoded in ensemble structure. In addition, we\ndemonstrate that the probabilities of bit-string probabilities (PoPs)\nassociated with the PPE exhibit distinct dynamical regimes and provide an\nexperimentally accessible probe of scrambling. Both PPE fluctuations and PoPs\ndisplay exponential sensitivity to the size of the discarded region, reflecting\nexponential degradation of quantum correlations under erasure. We substantiate\nthese findings using the non-integrable kicked Ising chain, combining numerics\nin the ergodic regime with exact results at its self-dual point. We extend our\nanalysis to a many-body localised (MBL) regime numerically, along with analytic\nresults for the $\\ell$-bit model.

To advance VOS\ntoward more realistic environments, coMplex video Object SEgmentation (MOSEv1)\nwas introduced to facilitate VOS research in complex scenes. Building on the\nstrengths and limitations of MOSEv1, we present MOSEv2, a significantly more\nchallenging dataset designed to further advance VOS methods under real-world\nconditions. MOSEv2 consists of 5,024 videos and over 701,976 high-quality masks\nfor 10,074 objects across 200 categories. Compared to its predecessor, MOSEv2\nintroduces significantly greater scene complexity, including more frequent\nobject disappearance and reappearance, severe occlusions and crowding, smaller\nobjects, as well as a range of new challenges such as adverse weather (e.g.,\nrain, snow, fog), low-light scenes (e.g., nighttime, underwater), multi-shot\nsequences, camouflaged objects, non-physical targets (e.g., shadows,\nreflections), scenarios requiring external knowledge, etc. We benchmark 20\nrepresentative VOS methods under 5 different settings and observe consistent\nperformance drops.

This\ndiscovery confirms that this distant resonance is populated, as a single\ndetection is likely to be indicative of a large population that is difficult to\ndetect due to observational biases. This object has an inclination of 33.4\ndegrees, and n-body integrations of orbital clones of 2020 VN40 have revealed\nsome unexpected evolutions. While clones of 2020 VN40 show resonant libration\naround the expected resonance centers of approximately 90, 180, and 270\ndegrees, for a restricted range of inclination and eccentricity values some\nclones librate around a resonant argument of 0 degrees. As this occurs for the\nslightly lower-eccentricity portions of the evolution, this behavior can also\nbe quite stable. Our initial exploration suggests that this libration around a\ncenter of 0 degrees is a generic effect for highly inclined objects in n:1\nresonances because the nature of their resonant interaction with Neptune\nbecomes a strong function of their argument of pericenter, omega. At large\ninclination, the resonant islands shift as omega precesses, switching the\ncenter of symmetric libration to 0 degrees for omega=90 degrees and omega=270\ndegrees. 2020 VN40 provides interesting insight into the evolution of the\nlarge-inclination resonators, which become more common at increasing semi-major\naxis.",

    "abstract": "Capturing human learning behavior based on deep learning methods has become a\nmajor research focus in both psychology and intelligent systems. Recent\napproaches rely on controlled experiments or rule-based models to explore\ncognitive processes. However, they struggle to capture learning dynamics, track\nprogress over time, or provide explainability. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce LearnerAgent, a novel multi-agent framework based on Large Language\nModels (LLMs) to simulate a realistic teaching environment. To explore\nhuman-like learning dynamics, we construct learners with psychologically\ngrounded profiles-such as Deep, Surface, and Lazy-as well as a persona-free\nGeneral Learner to inspect the base LLM's default behavior. Through weekly\nknowledge acquisition, monthly strategic choices, periodic tests, and peer\ninteraction, we can track the dynamic learning progress of individual learners\nover a full-year journey. Our findings are fourfold: 1) Longitudinal analysis\nreveals that only Deep Learner achieves sustained cognitive growth. Our\nspecially designed \"trap questions\" effectively diagnose Surface Learner's\nshallow knowledge. 2) The behavioral and cognitive patterns of distinct\nlearners align closely with their psychological profiles. 3) Learners'\nself-concept scores evolve realistically, with the General Learner developing\nsurprisingly high self-efficacy despite its cognitive limitations. 4)\nCritically, the default profile of base LLM is a \"diligent but brittle Surface\nLearner\"-an agent that mimics the behaviors of a good student but lacks true,\ngeneralizable understanding. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that\nLearnerAgent aligns well with real scenarios, yielding more insightful findings\nabout LLMs' behavior.",

    "abstract": "This paper argues that Active Inference (AIF) provides a crucial foundation\nfor developing autonomous AI agents capable of learning from experience without\ncontinuous human reward engineering. As AI systems begin to exhaust\nhigh-quality training data and rely on increasingly large human workforces for\nreward design, the current paradigm faces significant scalability challenges\nthat could impede progress toward genuinely autonomous intelligence. The\nproposal for an ``Era of Experience,'' where agents learn from self-generated\ndata, is a promising step forward. However, this vision still depends on\nextensive human engineering of reward functions, effectively shifting the\nbottleneck from data curation to reward curation. This highlights what we\nidentify as the \\textbf{grounded-agency gap}: the inability of contemporary AI\nsystems to autonomously formulate, adapt, and pursue objectives in response to\nchanging circumstances. We propose that AIF can bridge this gap by replacing\nexternal reward signals with an intrinsic drive to minimize free energy,\nallowing agents to naturally balance exploration and exploitation through a\nunified Bayesian objective. By integrating Large Language Models as generative\nworld models with AIF's principled decision-making framework, we can create\nagents that learn efficiently from experience while remaining aligned with\nhuman values. This synthesis offers a compelling path toward AI systems that\ncan develop autonomously while adhering to both computational and physical\nconstraints.",

To address these issues,\nwe propose Cooper(Co-optimizing Policy Model and Reward Model), a RL framework\nthat jointly optimizes both the policy model and the reward model. Cooper\nleverages the high precision of rule-based rewards when identifying correct\nresponses, and dynamically constructs and selects positive-negative sample\npairs for continued training the reward model. This design enhances robustness\nand mitigates the risk of reward hacking.

    "abstract": "Despite rapid advances in 3D content generation, quality assessment for the\ngenerated 3D assets remains challenging. Existing methods mainly rely on\nimage-based metrics and operate solely at the object level, limiting their\nability to capture spatial coherence, material authenticity, and high-fidelity\nlocal details. 1) To address these challenges, we introduce Hi3DEval, a\nhierarchical evaluation framework tailored for 3D generative content. It\ncombines both object-level and part-level evaluation, enabling holistic\nassessments across multiple dimensions as well as fine-grained quality\nanalysis. Additionally, we extend texture evaluation beyond aesthetic\nappearance by explicitly assessing material realism, focusing on attributes\nsuch as albedo, saturation, and metallicness. 2) To support this framework, we\nconstruct Hi3DBench, a large-scale dataset comprising diverse 3D assets and\nhigh-quality annotations, accompanied by a reliable multi-agent annotation\npipeline. We further propose a 3D-aware automated scoring system based on\nhybrid 3D representations. Specifically, we leverage video-based\nrepresentations for object-level and material-subject evaluations to enhance\nmodeling of spatio-temporal consistency and employ pretrained 3D features for\npart-level perception. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach\noutperforms existing image-based metrics in modeling 3D characteristics and\nachieves superior alignment with human preference, providing a scalable\nalternative to manual evaluations.

A fundamental challenge is robustly grounding\nnatural language instructions. This requires a precise spatial alignment, which\naccurately locates the coordinates of each element, and, more critically, a\ncorrect semantic alignment, which matches the instructions to the functionally\nappropriate UI element. Although Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards\n(RLVR) has proven to be effective at improving spatial alignment for these\nMLLMs, we find that inefficient exploration bottlenecks semantic alignment,\nwhich prevent models from learning difficult semantic associations.

AEPO employs a multi-answer\ngeneration strategy to enforce broader exploration, which is then guided by a\ntheoretically grounded Adaptive Exploration Reward (AER) function derived from\nfirst principles of efficiency eta=U/C. Our AEPO-trained models, InfiGUI-G1-3B\nand InfiGUI-G1-7B, establish new state-of-the-art results across multiple\nchallenging GUI grounding benchmarks, achieving significant relative\nimprovements of up to 9.0% against the naive RLVR baseline on benchmarks\ndesigned to test generalization and semantic understanding.

This counterintuitive statement seems to breach fundamental\nthermodynamic and kinetic laws; however, numerous experiments3-10 with\nclassical and quantum systems demonstrate this paradoxical Mpemba effect,\nleading to extensive discssions in prominent scientific jornals2,5,9,12-14.\nHowever, the fundamental physical mechanisms behind this effect have remained\nelusive14. Here we performed the water freezing experiments under carefully\ncontrolled conditions, and found that the Mpemba effect only occurred when the\nfreezer temperature was very close to the temperature of ice nucleation. In\nthis case, the range of freezing times for both hot and cold water was so great\nthat it exceeded the delayed cooling of the initially hotter liquid, and\ntherefore sometimes the hot water froze before the cold water. Our theoretical\nanalysis of this fact shows that the Mpemba paradox associated with water\nfreezing is rooted in the stochastic nature of ice nucleation, typical of\nfirst-order phase transitions.

    "abstract": "Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has been widely adopted to enhance Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) by decomposing complex tasks into simpler, sequential\nsubtasks. However, extending CoT to vision-language reasoning tasks remains\nchallenging, as it often requires interpreting transitions of visual states to\nsupport reasoning. Existing methods often struggle with this due to limited\ncapacity of modeling visual state transitions or incoherent visual trajectories\ncaused by fragmented architectures.\n  To overcome these limitations, we propose Uni-CoT, a Unified Chain-of-Thought\nframework that enables coherent and grounded multimodal reasoning within a\nsingle unified model. The key idea is to leverage a model capable of both image\nunderstanding and generation to reason over visual content and model evolving\nvisual states. However, empowering a unified model to achieve that is\nnon-trivial, given the high computational cost and the burden of training. To\naddress this, Uni-CoT introduces a novel two-level reasoning paradigm: A\nMacro-Level CoT for high-level task planning and A Micro-Level CoT for subtask\nexecution. This design significantly reduces the computational overhead.\nFurthermore, we introduce a structured training paradigm that combines\ninterleaved image-text supervision for macro-level CoT with multi-task\nobjectives for micro-level CoT. Together, these innovations allow Uni-CoT to\nperform scalable and coherent multi-modal reasoning. Furthermore, thanks to our\ndesign, all experiments can be efficiently completed using only 8 A100 GPUs\nwith 80GB VRAM each. Experimental results on reasoning-driven image generation\nbenchmark (WISE) and editing benchmarks (RISE and KRIS) indicates that Uni-CoT\ndemonstrates SOTA performance and strong generalization, establishing Uni-CoT\nas a promising solution for multi-modal reasoning.

Our reduction builds and expands on a suite\nof structural \"interlacing\" lemmas introduced by Mackenzie and Saffidine\n(arXiv:2411.19003); these lemmas can be reused as black boxes in future\nlower-bound constructions.\n  The instances produced by our reduction admit optimal protocols for\nself-similar constructions with strong structural properties, giving a flexible\nframework for the design of reductions showing NP-hardness of deciding the\ncommunication complexity of a Boolean matrix. This complements the work by\nHirahara, Ilango, and Loff, which establishes NP-hardness in the same model via\na different route; our analysis additionally yields reusable structural\nguarantees and underpins further consequences concerning inapproximability.\n  Because the gadgets in our construction are self-similar, they can be\nrecursively embedded. We sketch how this yields, under the Exponential-Time\nHypothesis, an additive inapproximability gap that grows without bound.\nFurthermore we outline a route toward NP-hardness of approximating D(f) within\na fixed constant additive error. Full details of the ETH-based\ninapproximability results will appear in a future version.\n  Beyond settling the complexity of deterministic communication complexity\nitself, the modular framework we develop opens the door to a wider class of\nreductions and, we believe, will prove useful in tackling other long-standing\nquestions in communication complexity.",

    "abstract": "Open-Vocabulary Multi-Label Recognition (OV-MLR) aims to identify multiple\nseen and unseen object categories within an image, requiring both precise\nintra-class localization to pinpoint objects and effective inter-class\nreasoning to model complex category dependencies. While Vision-Language\nPre-training (VLP) models offer a strong open-vocabulary foundation, they often\nstruggle with fine-grained localization under weak supervision and typically\nfail to explicitly leverage structured relational knowledge beyond basic\nsemantics, limiting performance especially for unseen classes. To overcome\nthese limitations, we propose the Dual Adaptive Refinement Transfer (DART)\nframework. DART enhances a frozen VLP backbone via two synergistic adaptive\nmodules. For intra-class refinement, an Adaptive Refinement Module (ARM)\nrefines patch features adaptively, coupled with a novel Weakly Supervised Patch\nSelecting (WPS) loss that enables discriminative localization using only\nimage-level labels. Concurrently, for inter-class transfer, an Adaptive\nTransfer Module (ATM) leverages a Class Relationship Graph (CRG), constructed\nusing structured knowledge mined from a Large Language Model (LLM), and employs\ngraph attention network to adaptively transfer relational information between\nclass representations. DART is the first framework, to our knowledge, to\nexplicitly integrate external LLM-derived relational knowledge for adaptive\ninter-class transfer while simultaneously performing adaptive intra-class\nrefinement under weak supervision for OV-MLR. Extensive experiments on\nchallenging benchmarks demonstrate that our DART achieves new state-of-the-art\nperformance, validating its effectiveness.",

    "abstract": "In this review, we examine particle transport in strongly turbulent\nthree-dimensional (3D) magnetized plasmas, characterized by intense\n(large-amplitude) magnetic field fluctuations. Such environments naturally give\nrise to a network of coherent structures (CoSs), including current sheets,\nfilaments, shocks, switchbacks, and significant magnetic perturbations, which\ncritically influence particle dynamics at the kinetic level. Within this\nturbulent regime, two fundamental particle energization mechanisms emerge,\nstochastic acceleration and systematic acceleration. Systematic acceleration\nwithin open turbulent volumes promotes the development of power-law tails in\nenergy distributions. Our analysis distinguishes the roles of two electric\nfields: the perpendicular (or convective) fields, which drive stochastic\nheating via interactions with randomly moving scatterers, and the parallel\nelectric fields, which enable systematic particle acceleration in regions of\nstrong currents. Combined with accurate estimates of particle escape times in\nfinite volumes, the interplay of these mechanisms leads to the formation of\nKappa distributions. The transport properties differ significantly between the\ntwo energization modes. Stochastic energization follows Gaussian statistics and\ncan be effectively described by the Fokker-Planck equation. In contrast,\nsystematic acceleration exhibits Levy flight statistics, necessitating a\nfractional transport equation for an accurate description. Furthermore, the\nfractal spatial distribution of CoSs introduces deviations from traditional\ntransport models, influencing e.g. particle escape times. Systematic\nacceleration is most efficient during the early, high-energy phases of\nturbulence, while stochastic heating becomes dominant during the later stages,\ncontributing to gradual particle energization.",

    "abstract": "In medical time series disease diagnosis, two key challenges are identified.\nFirst, the high annotation cost of medical data leads to overfitting in models\ntrained on label-limited, single-center datasets. To address this, we propose\nincorporating external data from related tasks and leveraging AE-GAN to extract\nprior knowledge, providing valuable references for downstream tasks. Second,\nmany existing studies employ contrastive learning to derive more generalized\nmedical sequence representations for diagnostic tasks, usually relying on\nmanually designed diverse positive and negative sample pairs. However, these\napproaches are complex, lack generalizability, and fail to adaptively capture\ndisease-specific features across different conditions. To overcome this, we\nintroduce LMCF (Learnable Multi-views Contrastive Framework), a framework that\nintegrates a multi-head attention mechanism and adaptively learns\nrepresentations from different views through inter-view and intra-view\ncontrastive learning strategies. Additionally, the pre-trained AE-GAN is used\nto reconstruct discrepancies in the target data as disease probabilities, which\nare then integrated into the contrastive learning process. Experiments on three\ntarget datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms other\nseven baselines, highlighting its significant impact on healthcare applications\nsuch as the diagnosis of myocardial infarction, Alzheimer's disease, and\nParkinson's disease.

We map weights to the fourth roots of unity\n$\\{\\pm1, \\pm i\\}$, forming a perfectly symmetric and information-theoretically\noptimal 2-bit representation. Importantly, each quantized weight has either a\nzero real or imaginary part, enabling multiplication-free inference using only\nadditions and element swaps. Experimental results show that Fairy$\\pm i$\noutperforms the ceiling of existing 2-bit quantization approaches in terms of\nboth PPL and downstream tasks, while maintaining strict storage and compute\nefficiency.

    "abstract": "Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) enables collaborative learning by\nintegrating disjoint feature subsets from multiple clients/parties. However,\nVFL typically faces two key challenges: i) the requirement for perfectly\naligned data samples across all clients (missing features are not allowed); ii)\nthe requirement for joint collaborative inference/prediction involving all\nclients (it does not support locally independent inference on a single client).\nTo address these challenges, we propose X-VFL, a new VFL framework designed to\ndeal with the non-aligned data samples with (partially) missing features and to\nsupport locally independent inference of new data samples for each client. In\nparticular, we design two novel modules in X-VFL: Cross Completion (XCom) and\nDecision Subspace Alignment (DS-Align). XCom can complete/reconstruct missing\nfeatures for non-aligned data samples by leveraging information from other\nclients. DS-Align aligns local features with completed and global features\nacross all clients within the decision subspace, thus enabling locally\nindependent inference at each client. Moreover, we provide convergence theorems\nfor different algorithms used in training X-VFL, showing an $O(1/\\sqrt{T})$\nconvergence rate for SGD-type algorithms and an $O(1/T)$ rate for PAGE-type\nalgorithms, where $T$ denotes the number of training update steps. Extensive\nexperiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that X-VFL significantly\noutperforms existing methods, e.g., achieving a 15% improvement in accuracy on\nthe image CIFAR-10 dataset and a 43% improvement on the medical MIMIC-III\ndataset.

While these tools may\nsuccessfully be applied to reliably simulate even more complex fluid flow PDE\nmodels, their understanding requires a fundamental revision in the case of\nstochastic fluid models, which are gaining increased importance nowadays.\n  This work motivates and surveys optimally convergent numerical methods for\nthe stochastic Stokes and Navier--Stokes equations that were obtained in the\nlast decades. Furtheremore, we computationally illustrate the failure of some\nof those methods from the deterministic setting, if they are straight-forwardly\napplied to the stochastic case. In fact, we explain why some of these\ndeterministic methods perform sub-optimally by highlighting crucial analytical\ndifferences between the deterministic and stochastic equations -- and how\nmodifications of the deterministic methods restore their optimal performance if\nthey properly address the probabilistic nature of the stochastic problem.\n  Next to the numerical analysis of schemes, we propose a general benchmark of\nprototypic fluid flow problems driven by different types of noise to also\ncompare new algorithms by simulations in terms of complexities, efficiencies,\nand possible limitations.

This study investigated whether MV-CBCT imaging dose\nwarrants protocol personalization according to patient age, anatomical\ntreatment site, and organ-specific radiosensitivity.\n  Methods: This retrospective study included cohorts of breast (n=30), pelvic\n(n=17), and head and neck (n=20) cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy with\ndaily MV-CBCT. Imaging plans using two common protocols (5 MU and 10 MU per\nfraction) were analyzed. NTCP values were estimated using logistic and\nLyman-Kutcher-Burman (LKB) models, while EAR was calculated using Schneider's\nOrgan Equivalent Dose (OED)-based model. Statistical analysis used paired\nt-tests, and results were further stratified by age (under 40, 40 to 60, over\n60 years).\n  Results: In breast cancer patients, NTCP for lung increased significantly\nunder the 10 MU protocol (p<0.001). EAR was elevated in younger breast patients\n(under 40 years), with some exceeding 15 cases per 10,000 person-years. In\npelvic and head and neck groups, NTCP and EAR remained low (under 1 percent),\nwith no clinically meaningful differences between protocols. Across all sites,\nyounger age correlated with higher secondary cancer risk.\n  Conclusion: Daily 10 MU MV-CBCT presents minimal additional risk in pelvic\nand head and neck radiotherapy. For breast cancer patients under 40, however,\nit significantly increases secondary cancer risk and lung NTCP. Personalized\nimaging protocols are recommended based on age, treatment site, and\nradiosensitivity.",

We propose a taxonomy based\non the availability and nature of unlabeled visual data, categorizing existing\napproaches into four key paradigms: Data-Free Transfer (no data), Unsupervised\nDomain Transfer (abundant data), Episodic Test-Time Adaptation (batch data),\nand Online Test-Time Adaptation (streaming data). Within this framework, we\nanalyze core methodologies and adaptation strategies associated with each\nparadigm, aiming to establish a systematic understanding of the field.\nAdditionally, we review representative benchmarks across diverse applications\nand highlight open challenges and promising directions for future research.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in\nmultiple-choice question answering (MCQA), but their inherent unreliability,\nsuch as hallucination and overconfidence, limits their application in high-risk\ndomains. To address this, we propose a frequency-based uncertainty\nquantification method under black-box settings, leveraging conformal prediction\n(CP) to ensure provable coverage guarantees. Our approach involves multiple\nindependent samplings of the model's output distribution for each input, with\nthe most frequent sample serving as a reference to calculate predictive entropy\n(PE). Experimental evaluations across six LLMs and four datasets (MedMCQA,\nMedQA, MMLU, MMLU-Pro) demonstrate that frequency-based PE outperforms\nlogit-based PE in distinguishing between correct and incorrect predictions, as\nmeasured by AUROC. Furthermore, the method effectively controls the empirical\nmiscoverage rate under user-specified risk levels, validating that sampling\nfrequency can serve as a viable substitute for logit-based probabilities in\nblack-box scenarios.

This corpus was\nrepresented as a weighted knowledge graph where a Graph Attention Network\nachieved 97.4% AUC in link prediction, significantly outperforming classical\nbaselines. The framework's primary value emerges from its dual capability:\ngenerating hypotheses and auditing knowledge.

Second, through symbolic analysis\nof 30 equation clusters, it serves as a computational auditor that verified\nestablished theory consistencies, synthesized the Magnetic Reynolds Number from\nelectromagnetic-fluid coupling, and revealed how even parsing errors could\npotentially point toward legitimate research like analog gravity.

It involves assigning\nflights to aircraft while ensuring regular visits to maintenance bases. This\npaper examines two aspects of the problem.\n  First, we explore the relationship between periodic instances, where flights\nare the same every day, and periodic solutions. The literature has implicitly\nassumed-without discussion-that periodic instances necessitate periodic\nsolutions, and even periodic solutions in a stronger form, where every two\nairplanes perform either the exact same cyclic sequence of flights, or\ncompletely disjoint cyclic sequences. However, enforcing such periodicity may\neliminate feasible solutions. We prove that, when regular maintenance is\nrequired at most every four days, there always exist periodic solutions of this\nform.\n  Second, we consider the computational hardness of the problem. Even if many\npapers in this area refer to the NP-hardness of the aircraft routing problem,\nsuch a result is only available in the literature for periodic instances. We\nestablish its NP-hardness for a non-periodic version. Polynomiality of a\nspecial but natural case is also proven.",

Achieving high-quality\nresults is challenging due to the large variability of clothed body especially\nin the generation of realistic wrinkles. 3D scan acquisitions provide more\naccuracy in the representation of real-world objects but lack semantic\ninformation that can be inferred with a reliable semantic reconstruction\npipeline. To this aim, shape segmentation plays a crucial role in identifying\nthe semantic shape parts. However, current 3D shape segmentation methods are\ndesigned for scene understanding and interpretation and only few work is\ndevoted to modeling.

These parts represent several layers\nwith strong overlap in contrast with standard segmentation methods that provide\ndisjoint sets.

In this fashion we can estimate the underlying body parts and the\nunseen clothed regions, i.e., the part of a cloth occluded by the clothed-layer\nabove.

In this work, we review\nthe axiomatic system and desired properties of the PID framework and make three\nmain contributions. First, we resolve the two-source PID case by providing\nexplicit closed-form formulas for all information atoms that satisfy the full\nset of axioms and desirable properties. Second, we prove that for three or more\nsources, PID suffers from fundamental inconsistencies: we present a\nthree-variable counterexample where the sum of atoms exceeds the total\ninformation, and prove an impossibility theorem showing that no lattice-based\ndecomposition can be consistent for all subsets when the number of sources\nexceeds three. Finally, we deviate from the PID lattice approach to avoid its\ninconsistencies, and present explicit measures of multivariate unique and\nsynergistic information. Our proposed measures, which rely on new systems of\nrandom variables that eliminate higher-order dependencies, satisfy key axioms\nsuch as additivity and continuity, provide a robust theoretical explanation of\nhigh-order relations, and show strong numerical performance in comprehensive\nexperiments on the Ising model.

Drawing on the structure based on the three fundamental aims, our work\nmaps out the landscape of more than 70 methodologies that were applied to\naddress those three aims across time, disciplines, and epistemic paradigms. The\npart on generating ideas synthesises classical creativity techniques,\nparticipatory approaches and computational innovations. The part on evaluating\nideas explores the wide ranging methods developed to this end. The part on\nprioritising ideas assesses different prioritisation techniques. A central\nargument of this paper is that although these methods arose separately and\nindependently, most often isolated by disciplinary boundaries, they share\nremarkable conceptual and structural similarities. Recurring features include\ncreative ideation, aggregation of input, balancing of subjective and objective\ncriteria, embedded value assumptions and iterative refinement. There is also a\nmore recent trend of application of statistical inference and introduction of\nartificial intelligence, making Ideometrics increasingly quantitative,\ntestable, replicable and digital.

Decoupling parameter a increases and then saturates for N\n= 99 and 103, indicating purer K = 1/2 structure at high Z; the N = 101 chain\nshows the opposite trend, pointing to stronger configuration mixing. The first\norder Coriolis term B becomes increasingly negative with Z, whereas the higher\norder term C shows chain specific sign changes.

    "abstract": "Structural pruning has been widely studied for its effectiveness in\ncompressing neural networks. However, existing methods often neglect the\ninterconnections among parameters. To address this limitation, this paper\nproposes a structural pruning framework termed Optimal Brain Connection. First,\nwe introduce the Jacobian Criterion, a first-order metric for evaluating the\nsaliency of structural parameters. Unlike existing first-order methods that\nassess parameters in isolation, our criterion explicitly captures both\nintra-component interactions and inter-layer dependencies. Second, we propose\nthe Equivalent Pruning mechanism, which utilizes autoencoders to retain the\ncontributions of all original connection--including pruned ones--during\nfine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that the Jacobian Criterion\noutperforms several popular metrics in preserving model performance, while the\nEquivalent Pruning mechanism effectively mitigates performance degradation\nafter fine-tuning.

However, real-world applications face significant\nocclusion challenges. When multiple pedestrians interact or overlap, the loss\nof target features severely compromises the tracker's ability to maintain\nstable trajectories. Traditional tracking methods, which typically rely on\nfull-body bounding box features extracted from {Re-ID} models and linear\nconstant-velocity motion assumptions, often struggle in severe occlusion\nscenarios. To address these limitations, this work proposes an enhanced\ntracking framework that leverages richer feature representations and a more\nrobust motion model. Specifically, the proposed method incorporates detection\nfeatures from both the regression and classification branches of an object\ndetector, embedding spatial and positional information directly into the\nfeature representations. To further mitigate occlusion challenges, a head\nkeypoint detection model is introduced, as the head is less prone to occlusion\ncompared to the full body. In terms of motion modeling, we propose an iterative\nKalman filtering approach designed to align with modern detector assumptions,\nintegrating 3D priors to better complete motion trajectories in complex scenes.\nBy combining these advancements in appearance and motion modeling, the proposed\nmethod offers a more robust solution for multi-object tracking in crowded\nenvironments where occlusions are prevalent.",

To prevent error propagation, LAG incorporates a\nlogical termination mechanism that halts inference upon encountering\nunanswerable sub-questions and reduces wasted computation on excessive\nreasoning. Finally, it synthesizes all sub-resolutions to generate verified\nresponses.

    "abstract": "Most RGB-based hand-object reconstruction methods rely on object templates,\nwhile template-free methods typically assume full object visibility. This\nassumption often breaks in real-world settings, where fixed camera viewpoints\nand static grips leave parts of the object unobserved, resulting in implausible\nreconstructions. To overcome this, we present MagicHOI, a method for\nreconstructing hands and objects from short monocular interaction videos, even\nunder limited viewpoint variation. Our key insight is that, despite the\nscarcity of paired 3D hand-object data, large-scale novel view synthesis\ndiffusion models offer rich object supervision. This supervision serves as a\nprior to regularize unseen object regions during hand interactions. Leveraging\nthis insight, we integrate a novel view synthesis model into our hand-object\nreconstruction framework. We further align hand to object by incorporating\nvisible contact constraints. Our results demonstrate that MagicHOI\nsignificantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art hand-object reconstruction\nmethods. We also show that novel view synthesis diffusion priors effectively\nregularize unseen object regions, enhancing 3D hand-object reconstruction.",

    "abstract": "Chirality information (i.e. information that allows distinguishing left from\nright) is ubiquitous for various data modes in computer vision, including\nimages, videos, point clouds, and meshes. While chirality has been extensively\nstudied in the image domain, its exploration in shape analysis (such as point\nclouds and meshes) remains underdeveloped. Although many shape vertex\ndescriptors have shown appealing properties (e.g. robustness to rigid-body\ntransformations), they are often not able to disambiguate between left and\nright symmetric parts. Considering the ubiquity of chirality information in\ndifferent shape analysis problems and the lack of chirality-aware features\nwithin current shape descriptors, developing a chirality feature extractor\nbecomes necessary and urgent. Based on the recent Diff3F framework, we propose\nan unsupervised chirality feature extraction pipeline to decorate shape\nvertices with chirality-aware information, extracted from 2D foundation models.\nWe evaluated the extracted chirality features through quantitative and\nqualitative experiments across diverse datasets.

In most research focused on developing new AV control\nalgorithms (controllers), the performance of these algorithms is assessed\nsolely based on performance metrics such as collision avoidance or lane-keeping\nefficiency, while largely overlooking the human-centred dimensions of\ninteraction with HDVs. This paper proposes a structured evaluation framework\nthat addresses this gap by incorporating metrics grounded in the human-robot\ninteraction literature. The framework spans four key domains: a) interaction\neffect, b) interaction perception, c) interaction effort, and d) interaction\nability. These domains capture both the performance of the AV and its impact on\nhuman drivers around it. To demonstrate the utility of the framework, we apply\nit to a case study evaluating how a state-of-the-art AV controller interacts\nwith human drivers in a merging scenario in a driving simulator. Measuring\nHDV-HDV interactions as a baseline, this study included one representative\nmetric per domain: a) perceived safety, b) subjective ratings, specifically how\nparticipants perceived the other vehicle's driving behaviour (e.g.,\naggressiveness or predictability) , c) driver workload, and d) merging success.\nThe results showed that incorporating metrics covering all four domains in the\nevaluation of AV controllers can illuminate critical differences in driver\nexperience when interacting with AVs. This highlights the need for a more\ncomprehensive evaluation approach. Our framework offers researchers,\ndevelopers, and policymakers a systematic method for assessing AV behaviour\nbeyond technical performance, fostering the development of AVs that are not\nonly functionally capable but also understandable, acceptable, and safe from a\nhuman perspective.",

    "abstract": "The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into startup evaluation\nrepresents a significant technological shift, yet the academic research\nunderpinning this transition remains methodologically fragmented. Existing\nstudies often employ ad-hoc approaches, leading to a body of work with\ninconsistent definitions of success, atheoretical features, and a lack of\nrigorous validation. This fragmentation severely limits the comparability,\nreliability, and practical utility of current predictive models.\n  To address this critical gap, this paper presents a comprehensive systematic\nliterature review of 57 empirical studies. We deconstruct the current\nstate-of-the-art by systematically mapping the features, algorithms, data\nsources, and evaluation practices that define the AI-driven startup prediction\nlandscape. Our synthesis reveals a field defined by a central paradox: a strong\nconvergence on a common toolkit -- venture databases and tree-based ensembles\n-- but a stark divergence in methodological rigor. We identify four\nfoundational weaknesses: a fragmented definition of \"success,\" a divide between\ntheory-informed and data-driven feature engineering, a chasm between common and\nbest-practice model validation, and a nascent approach to data ethics and\nexplainability.\n  In response to these findings, our primary contribution is the proposal of\nthe Systematic AI-driven Startup Evaluation (SAISE) Framework. This novel,\nfive-stage prescriptive roadmap is designed to guide researchers from ad-hoc\nprediction toward principled evaluation. By mandating a coherent, end-to-end\nmethodology that emphasizes stage-aware problem definition, theory-informed\ndata synthesis, principled feature engineering, rigorous validation, and\nrisk-aware interpretation, the SAISE framework provides a new standard for\nconducting more comparable, robust, and practically relevant research in this\nrapidly maturing domain",

    "abstract": "A multiplex social network captures multiple types of social relations among\nthe same set of people, with each layer representing a distinct type of\nrelationship. Understanding the structure of such systems allows us to identify\nhow social exchanges may be driven by a person's own attributes and actions\n(independence), the status or resources of others (dependence), and mutual\ninfluence between entities (interdependence). Characterizing structure in\nmultiplex networks is challenging, as the distinct layers can reflect different\nyet complementary roles, with interdependence emerging across multiple scales.\nHere, we introduce the Multiplex Latent Trade-off Model (MLT), a framework for\nextracting roles in multiplex social networks that accounts for independence,\ndependence, and interdependence. MLT defines roles as trade-offs, requiring\neach node to distribute its source and target roles across layers while\nsimultaneously distributing community memberships within hierarchical,\nmulti-scale structures. Applying the MLT approach to 176 real-world multiplex\nnetworks, composed of social, health, and economic layers, from villages in\nwestern Honduras, we see core social exchange principles emerging, while also\nrevealing local, layer-specific, and multi-scale communities. Link prediction\nanalyses reveal that modeling interdependence yields the greatest performance\ngains in the social layer, with subtler effects in health and economic layers.\nThis suggests that social ties are structurally embedded, whereas health and\neconomic ties are primarily shaped by individual status and behavioral\nengagement.

In\nthis paper, we show that for a similar number of fixed-point log-likelihood\nratio (LLR) operations, long polar codes under successive cancellation (SC)\ndecoding outperform their LDPC counterparts.

To address this\nlimitation, we introduce Multi-modal MR to CT (MM2CT) translation method by\nleveraging multimodal T1- and T2-weighted MRI data, an innovative Mamba-based\nframework for multi-modal medical image synthesis. Mamba effectively overcomes\nthe limited local receptive field in CNNs and the high computational complexity\nissues in Transformers. MM2CT leverages this advantage to maintain long-range\ndependencies modeling capabilities while achieving multi-modal MR feature\nintegration. Additionally, we incorporate a dynamic local convolution module\nand a dynamic enhancement module to improve MRI-to-CT synthesis. The\nexperiments on a public pelvis dataset demonstrate that MM2CT achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in terms of Structural Similarity Index Measure\n(SSIM) and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR).

    "abstract": "We propose a new paradigm for unsupervised anomaly detection and localization\nusing Flow Matching (FM), which fundamentally addresses the model expressivity\nlimitations of conventional flow-based methods. To this end, we formalize the\nconcept of time-reversed Flow Matching (rFM) as a vector field regression along\na predefined probability path to transform unknown data distributions into\nstandard Gaussian. We bring two core observations that reshape our\nunderstanding of FM. First, we rigorously prove that FM with linear\ninterpolation probability paths is inherently non-invertible. Second, our\nanalysis reveals that employing reversed Gaussian probability paths in\nhigh-dimensional spaces can lead to trivial vector fields. This issue arises\ndue to the manifold-related constraints. Building on the second observation, we\npropose Worst Transport (WT) displacement interpolation to reconstruct a\nnon-probabilistic evolution path. The proposed WT-Flow enhances dynamical\ncontrol over sample trajectories, constructing ''degenerate potential wells''\nfor anomaly-free samples while allowing anomalous samples to escape. This novel\nunsupervised paradigm offers a theoretically grounded separation mechanism for\nanomalous samples. Notably, FM provides a computationally tractable framework\nthat scales to complex data. We present the first successful application of FM\nfor the unsupervised anomaly detection task, achieving state-of-the-art\nperformance at a single scale on the MVTec dataset. The reproducible code for\ntraining will be released upon camera-ready submission.",

In this work, we demonstrated that applying a single laser\npulse and an in-plane magnetic field can facilitate magnetic switching in a\nPt/Co/Pt ferromagnetic trilayers stack within a specific laser power window. To\nfurther understand this phenomenon, we introduce a Cu layer to accelerates the\nre-establishment time of the anisotropy field of Pt/Co/Pt trilayers, which\nleads to bullseye-patterned magnetic switching. We have mapped state diagrams\nfor these phenomena, and through micromagnetic simulations, we have determined\nthat these switchings are influenced by thermal anisotropy torque, which can be\nmodulated through PMA. These findings indicate that single-shot optical\nprecessional magnetization reversal is feasible in a broader range of\nmaterials, opening avenues for the development of optical-magnetic memory\ndevices.",

When people choose the mediator based on costs and benefits (whether\nto visit a doctor, to attend university, etc.), this assumption fails and\nconventional CM analyses are at risk of bias. I propose a control function\nstrategy that uses instrumental variation in mediator take-up costs, delivering\nunbiased direct and indirect effects when selection is driven by unobserved\ngains. The method identifies CM effects via the marginal effect of the\nmediator, with parametric or semi-parametric estimation that is simple to\nimplement in two stages. Applying these methods to the Oregon Health Insurance\nExperiment reveals a substantial portion of the Medicaid lottery's effect on\nself-reported health and happiness flows through increased healthcare usage --\nan effect that a conventional CM analysis would mistake.

Courcelle's theorem shows\nthat graph problems that are expressible as MSO formulas of constant size admit\nFPT algorithms parameterized by the treewidth of the input graph. This\nencompasses many natural graph problems. However, many metric-based graph\nproblems, where the solution is defined using some metric-based property of the\ngraph (often the distance) are not expressible as MSO formulas of constant\nsize. These types of problems, Isometric Path Partition being one of them,\nrequire individual attention and often draw the boundary for the success story\nof parameterization by treewidth.\n  In this paper, we prove that Isometric Path Partition is $W[1]$-hard when\nparameterized by treewidth (in fact, even pathwidth), answering the question by\nDumas et al. [SIDMA, 2024], Fernau et al. [CIAC, 2023], and confirming the\naforementioned tendency. We complement this hardness result by designing a\ntailored dynamic programming algorithm running in $n^{O(\\mathrm{tw})}$ time.\nThis dynamic programming approach also results in an algorithm running in time\n$\\textrm{diam}^{O(\\mathrm{tw}^2)} \\cdot n^{O(1)}$, where $\\textrm{diam}$ is the\ndiameter of the graph.

    "abstract": "Accurate numerical integration over non-uniform point clouds is a challenge\nfor modern mesh-free machine learning solvers for partial differential\nequations (PDEs) using variational principles. While standard Monte Carlo (MC)\nmethods are not capable of handling a non-uniform point cloud, modern neural\nnetwork architectures can deal with permutation-invariant inputs, creating\nquadrature rules for any point cloud. In this work, we introduce QuadrANN, a\nGraph Neural Network (GNN) architecture designed to learn optimal quadrature\nweights directly from the underlying geometry of point clouds. The design of\nthe model exploits a deep message-passing scheme where the initial layer\nencodes rich local geometric features from absolute and relative positions as\nwell as an explicit local density measure. In contrast, the following layers\nincorporate a global context vector. These architectural choices allow the\nQuadrANN to generate a data-driven quadrature rule that is\npermutation-invariant and adaptive to both local point density and the overall\ndomain shape. We test our methodology on a series of challenging test cases,\nincluding integration on convex and non-convex domains and estimating the\nsolution of the Heat and Fokker-Planck equations. Across all the tests,\nQuadrANN reduces the variance of the integral estimation compared to standard\nQuasi-Monte Carlo methods by warping the point clouds to be more dense in\ncritical areas where the integrands present certain singularities. This\nenhanced stability in critical areas of the domain at hand is critical for the\noptimization of energy functionals, leading to improved deep learning-based\nvariational solvers.",

In the EFT, a shift symmetry of the\nhydrodynamic modes enforces the maximal Lyapunov exponent in OTOCs, $\\lambda_L\n= 2\\pi T$, while simultaneously constraining thermal two-point autocorrelators.\nWe solve these constraints on the autocorrelator, and calculate the Lanczos\ncoefficients and Krylov exponents for several examples, finding both $\\lambda_K\n= \\lambda_L$ and $\\lambda_K = \\lambda_L/2$. This demonstrates that, within the\nEFT, the shift symmetry alone is insufficient to enforce maximal Krylov\nexponents even when the Lyapunov exponent is maximal.

These approaches fail to provide rigorous\ntail-safety guarantees with respect to extreme or high-risk outcomes (denoted\nas tail-risk), potentially resulting in serious consequence in high-stake\nscenarios.

    "abstract": "Accurate time-to-event prediction is integral to decision-making, informing\nmedical guidelines, hiring decisions, and resource allocation. Survival\nanalysis, the quantitative framework used to model time-to-event data, accounts\nfor patients who do not experience the event of interest during the study\nperiod, known as censored patients. However, many patients experience events\nthat prevent the observation of the outcome of interest. These competing risks\nare often treated as censoring, a practice frequently overlooked due to a\nlimited understanding of its consequences. Our work theoretically demonstrates\nwhy treating competing risks as censoring introduces substantial bias in\nsurvival estimates, leading to systematic overestimation of risk and,\ncritically, amplifying disparities. First, we formalize the problem of\nmisclassifying competing risks as censoring and quantify the resulting error in\nsurvival estimates. Specifically, we develop a framework to estimate this error\nand demonstrate the associated implications for predictive performance and\nalgorithmic fairness. Furthermore, we examine how differing risk profiles\nacross demographic groups lead to group-specific errors, potentially\nexacerbating existing disparities. Our findings, supported by an empirical\nanalysis of cardiovascular management, demonstrate that ignoring competing\nrisks disproportionately impacts the individuals most at risk of these events,\npotentially accentuating inequity. By quantifying the error and highlighting\nthe fairness implications of the common practice of considering competing risks\nas censoring, our work provides a critical insight into the development of\nsurvival models: practitioners must account for competing risks to improve\naccuracy, reduce disparities in risk assessment, and better inform downstream\ndecisions.",

By using a weighted mean of these, forming a single look-up\ntable, and using the attenuation images, the artificial dark-field signal and\nthus the bone structures present are reduced for study participants. Results:\nIt was found that applying a correction using a weighted look-up table leads to\na significant reduction of bone structures in the dark-field image. The\nweighting of the aluminum component has a substantial impact on the degree to\nwhich bone structures remain visible in the dark-field image. Furthermore, a\nlarge negative bias in the dark-field image, dependent on the aluminum\nweighting, was successfully corrected. Conclusions: The beam-hardening-induced\nsignal in the dark-field images was successfully reduced using the method\ndescribed. The choice of aluminum weighting to suppress rib structures, as well\nas the selection of bias correction, should be evaluated based on the specific\nclinical question.",

For conventional signals, LISA reconstructs the tension $G\\mu$\nwith an error $\\lesssim 10\\%$ for $G\\mu \\gtrsim 5\\cdot 10^{-15}$, which\ndecreases down to $2-3\\%$ for $G\\mu \\gtrsim 10^{-12}$. BOS and VOS modelings\nbecome distinguishable confidently for $G\\mu \\gtrsim 5\\cdot 10^{-13}$. For\nbeyond-conventional signals, we identify SNR and error-threshold intervals for\neach parameter, and determine (for few examples) the regions where they can be\ndistinguished from conventional signals. Analogous quality reconstruction\nstudies of cosmic-string GWBs, superimposed over leading astrophysical\nforegrounds in the LISA window, will be presented in a series of upcoming\npapers.",

    "abstract": "Visual cryptography schemes (VCSs) belong to a category of secret image\nsharing schemes that do not require cryptographic knowledge for decryption,\ninstead relying directly on the human visual system. Among VCSs, random\ngrid-based VCS (RGVCS) has garnered widespread attention as it avoids pixel\nexpansion while requiring no basic matrices design. Contrast, a core metric for\nRGVCS, directly determines the visual quality of recovered images, rendering\nits optimization a critical research objective. However, existing $(k,n)$\nRGVCSs still fail to attain theoretical upper bounds on contrast, highlighting\nthe urgent need for higher-contrast constructions. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel sharing paradigm for RGVCS that constructs $(k,n)$-threshold schemes from\narbitrary $(k,n')$-threshold schemes $(k \\leq n'\\leq n)$, termed\n\\emph{$n'$-grouped $(k,n)$ RGVCS}. This paradigm establishes hierarchical\ncontrast characteristics: participants within the same group achieve optimal\nrecovery quality, while inter-group recovery shows a hierarchical contrast. We\nfurther introduce a new contrast calculation formula tailored to the new\nparadigm. Then, we propose a contrast-enhanced $(k,n)$ RGVCS by setting $n'=\nk$, achieving the highest contrast value documented in the existing literature.\nTheoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate the superiority of\nour proposed scheme in terms of contrast.",

Utilizing multiple light scattering in disordered media allows for\ncost-effective and flexible designs, as well as the seamless integration of\nmultiple multicolor gain materials. However, generating light that closely\nmeets the D65 illumination standard remains challenging due to energy transfer\nbetween chromophores.

Here, we present a solution to the problem using\nhierarchically designed polymer fiber mats with spatially distributed red,\ngreen, and blue (RGB) laser dyes to achieve controlled and tunable multicolor\nand white lasing. While electrospun fibers are well-studied, their use for\nmulticolor random lasing is demonstrated here for the first time. Our results\ndemonstrate outstanding spectral tunability, aligning well with industrial\ncolor standards such as sRGB, Adobe RGB, and DCI-P3. The white lasing closely\nmatches D-series white illuminants, including D65, D55, and D75 standards, with\ncoordinate deviations as low as approximately 0.2 to 3%, surpassing previously\nreported values for organic, hybrid, and inorganic systems. By limiting energy\ntransfer, our approach enables precise lasing control, demonstrating that fiber\nmats are versatile for next-generation random lasing applications.

Moreover, a simulation experiment was conducted to investigate\nthe impact of implementing AI-based recommendations for ancillary diagnostic\ntesting on the workflow of the pathology department. The best AI model based on\nUNI features reached an AUROC of 0.95 and an accuracy of 0.86 in\ndifferentiating Spitz tumors from conventional melanomas.

It has previously been shown that controlled\nGivens rotations are universal for quantum chemistry. To prepare a selected\nlinear combination of Slater determinants (represented as occupation number\nconfigurations) using Givens rotations, the gates that rotate between the\nreference and excited determinants need to be controlled on qubits outside the\nexcitation (external controls), in general.

We\ncompare this approach to an alternative technique that exploits the sparsity of\nthe chemical state vector and find that the latter can outperform the method of\nexternally controlled Givens rotations; highly reduced circuits can be obtained\nby taking advantage of the sparse nature (where the number of basis states is\nsignificantly less than 2$^{n_q}$ for $n_q$ qubits) of chemical wavefunctions.\nWe demonstrate the benefits of these techniques in a range of applications,\nincluding the ground states of a strongly correlated molecule, matrix elements\nof the Q-SCEOM algorithm for excited states, as well as correlated initial\nstates for a quantum subspace method based on quantum computed moments and\nquantum phase estimation.",

The experiments were performed with the MetroPT data set from\nthe metro operator of Porto, Portugal. The results are above 98 % for F-measure\nand 99 % for accuracy. In the context of railway predictive maintenance,\nachieving these high values is crucial due to the practical and operational\nimplications of accurate failure prediction.

Specifically, we incorporate learnable\nspatial offsets informed by the real coordinates of each patch, enabling the\nmodel to adaptively attend to morphologically relevant regions across the\nslide. This design significantly enhances the contextual field while preserving\nspatial specificity. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on\nfour benchmark datasets (TCGA-COAD, BRACS, gastric intestinal metaplasia\ngrading, and intestinal ROI classification), demonstrating the power of\ndeformable attention in capturing complex spatial structures in WSIs and ROIs.",

Yet experimental realizations inevitably\nsuffer from disorder due to random displacements of atoms, leading to\ndepartures from the expected behavior. Here, we study how such positional\ndisorder influences the Ising criticality. Since disorder breaks the\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, one might expect the system to flow to an\ninfinite-strength disordered fixed point, erasing all nontrivial critical\nfeatures in low spatial dimensions. Remarkably, we find instead that disorder\nin Rydberg systems is subjected to nontrivial local constraints, making the\nphysics markedly different from systems with more conventional spatially\nshort-range correlated or long-range correlated disorder. This leads to new\nclasses of criticalities even at dimensions where conventional disorder would\ndestroy criticality altogether. We then demonstrate as a consequence how a\nnovel pseudo-criticality emerges in mesoscopic Rydberg chains, and show that\nthe renormalization group flow is governed by a locally constrained\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2$-breaking perturbation.

It focuses on the effectiveness of using five different affective\nexpression modalities as main drivers for defusing the conflict. The aim is to\ndiscover any strengths or weaknesses in using each modality to mitigate the\nhostility that people feel towards a poorly performing robot. The defusing of\nthe situation is accomplished by making the robot better at acknowledging the\nconflict and by letting it express remorse. To facilitate the tests, we used a\ncustom affective robot in a simulated conflict situation with 105 test\nparticipants. The results show that all tested expression modalities can\nsuccessfully be used to defuse the situation and convey an acknowledgment of\nthe confrontation. The ratings were remarkably similar, but the movement\nmodality was different (ANON p$<$.05) than the other modalities. The test\nparticipants also had similar affective interpretations on how impacted the\nrobot was of the confrontation across all expression modalities. This indicates\nthat defusing a high-intensity interaction may not demand special attention to\nthe expression abilities of the robot, but rather require attention to the\nabilities of being socially aware of the situation and reacting in accordance\nwith it.",

Instead of using the query image as\na single input, Slice-Loc divides it into sub-images and estimates the 3-DoF\npose for each slice, creating redundant and independent observations. Then, a\ngeometric rigidity formula is proposed to filter out the erroneous 3-DoF poses,\nand the inliers are merged to generate the final camera pose. Furthermore, we\npropose a model that quantifies the meaningfulness of localization by\nestimating the number of false alarms (NFA), according to the distribution of\nthe locations of the sliced images. By eliminating gross errors, Slice-Loc\nboosts localization accuracy and effectively detects failures.

    "abstract": "Agentic Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and 'deep research' systems aim\nto enable autonomous search processes where Large Language Models (LLMs)\niteratively refine outputs. However, applying these systems to domain-specific\nprofessional search, such as biomedical research, presents challenges, as\nautomated systems may reduce user involvement and misalign with expert\ninformation needs. Professional search tasks often demand high levels of user\nexpertise and transparency. The BioASQ CLEF 2025 challenge, using\nexpert-formulated questions, can serve as a platform to study these issues. We\nexplored the performance of current reasoning and nonreasoning LLMs like\nGemini-Flash 2.0, o3-mini, o4-mini and DeepSeek-R1. A key aspect of our\nmethodology was a self-feedback mechanism where LLMs generated, evaluated, and\nthen refined their outputs for query expansion and for multiple answer types\n(yes/no, factoid, list, ideal). We investigated whether this iterative\nself-correction improves performance and if reasoning models are more capable\nof generating useful feedback. Preliminary results indicate varied performance\nfor the self-feedback strategy across models and tasks. This work offers\ninsights into LLM self-correction and informs future work on comparing the\neffectiveness of LLM-generated feedback with direct human expert input in these\nsearch systems.",

    "abstract": "Generally, stacking two monolayer type-I quantum spin Hall insulators gives\nrise to a trivial insulator. However, whether or not stacking two type-II\nquantum spin Hall insulators results in a trivial insulator has not yet been\nexplored. In this letter, based on the calculations of lattice model, we\ndemonstrate that stacking two type-II quantum spin Hall insulators does not\nyield a trivial insulator, but instead forms a quantum spin Hall insulator with\nhigh spin Chern number. In this phase, there are two pairs of topological edge\nstates with opposite chirality and polarization coexisting in the boundary. Our\ncalculations further reveal that the quantized spin Hall conductance of the\nbilayer is twice that of the monolayer. When U(1) symmetry is present, the high\nspin Chern number phase remains stable; when U(1) symmetry is broken, it\npersists over a broad parameter range. Furthermore, based on the\nfirst-principles electronic structure calculations, we propose that bilayer\nNb$_2$SeTeO is a type-II quantum spin Hall insulator with high spin Chern\nnumber. Finally, extending this strategy to multilayer stacks naturally leads\nto quantum spin Hall insulator with larger spin Chern number. Our work not only\ndeepens the distinction between type-I and type-II quantum spin Hall\ninsulators, but also offers a route toward realizing highly quantized spin Hall\nconductance.",

However, they are still not used as widely as their electronic\ncounterparts due to a relatively large footprint of photonic chips. One\nlimiting factor to their size is the need to separate optical components by\ndistances on the order of the working wavelength or larger to minimize optical\ncrosstalk between them. In this work, we consider the fundamental and\nhigher-order modes in closely spaced straight and bent waveguides with\nrelatively small cross sections and find that higher-order modes allow one to\nsubstantially reduce the crosstalk in both cases. This can be used to\nconsiderably reduce the dimensions of photonic chips. We also propose on-chip\ncomponents that allow selective excitation of higher-order modes. In addition,\nwe design a directional coupler, a 3-dB splitter, and a Mach-Zehnder\ninterferometer capable of operating on higher-order modes. Other ultracompact\nphotonic-chip components, such as optical interconnects, switches,\ntransceivers, and phased waveguide arrays for on-chip LiDAR scanners, can be\ndesigned as well based on similar principles.",

We elevate this observation to\na symmetry packaging principle, which asserts that packets of IQNs remain\nintact throughout all physical processes. We analyze a quantum-field excitation\nin six successive stages: (1) particle creation/annihilation, (2) hybridization\nwith gauge-blind external degrees of freedom (DOFs), (3) tensor-product\nassembly, (4) isotypic decomposition, (5) packaged superposition/entanglement,\nand (6) local Gauge-Invariance constraint.

These\nstages unfold within a three packaging layer hierarchy (raw-Fock $\\to$ isotypic\n$\\to$ physical) with distinct packaging characters. Packaging alone reproduces\nfamiliar charge-superselection rules and, within any fixed-charge sector,\nadmits a new class of packaged entangled states where internal and external\nDOFs are inseparably locked.

A critical yet\nunderexplored aspect of this task is the effective use of patient-specific\nprior knowledge -- including clinical context (e.g., symptoms, medical history)\nand the most recent prior image -- which radiologists routinely rely on for\ndiagnostic reasoning. Most existing methods generate reports from single\nimages, neglecting this essential prior information and thus failing to capture\ndiagnostic intent or disease progression. To bridge this gap, we propose\nPriorRG, a novel chest X-ray report generation framework that emulates\nreal-world clinical workflows via a two-stage training pipeline. In Stage 1, we\nintroduce a prior-guided contrastive pre-training scheme that leverages\nclinical context to guide spatiotemporal feature extraction, allowing the model\nto align more closely with the intrinsic spatiotemporal semantics in radiology\nreports. In Stage 2, we present a prior-aware coarse-to-fine decoding for\nreport generation that progressively integrates patient-specific prior\nknowledge with the vision encoder's hidden states. This decoding allows the\nmodel to align with diagnostic focus and track disease progression, thereby\nenhancing the clinical accuracy and fluency of the generated reports. Extensive\nexperiments on MIMIC-CXR and MIMIC-ABN datasets demonstrate that PriorRG\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 3.6% BLEU-4 and 3.8% F1 score\nimprovement on MIMIC-CXR, and a 5.9% BLEU-1 gain on MIMIC-ABN.

The case of\n`pure' minimal models, where the extension of all predicates must be minimal,\nhas remained largely uncharted. We address this problem in popular DLs and\nobtain surprisingly negative results: concept satisfiability in minimal models\nis undecidable already for $\\mathcal{EL}$. This undecidability also extends to\na very restricted fragment of tuple-generating dependencies. To regain\ndecidability, we impose acyclicity conditions on the TBox that bring the\nworst-case complexity below double exponential time and allow us to establish a\nconnection with the recently studied pointwise circumscription; we also derive\nresults in data complexity.

However, the high coercive\nfield required for polarization switching in hafnia remains a critical\nchallenge for efficient device operations. Using first-principles calculations\nand phenomenological modeling, we predict that hole doping can reduce the\ncoercive field from 8 MV/cm in undoped hafnia to 6 MV/cm in hafnia doped with\n0.2 holes per formula unit (f.u.). In the absence of doping, the reversal of\npolarization of the Pca21 phase is preferred through the non-polar, tetragonal\nP42/nmc phase. This switching pathway involves the coupling of three hard\ndistortion modes that render undoped hafnia as an improper ferroelectric. The\noverall energy barrier through this pathway remains unchanged (80 meV/f.u.)\nupon hole doping. However, the introduction of holes hardens the polar\ndistortion mode that connects the polar Pca21 phase to the non-polar,\northorhombic Pbcm phase, and reduces the energy barrier from 180 meV/f.u. in\nundoped hafnia to 80 meV/f.u. at 0.2 holes/f.u.. Overall, hole doping makes the\nlatter switching pathway through the Pbcm phase competitive, and renders hafnia\nas a proper ferroelectric with a lower coercive field.",

However, 3DGS\nresorts to the Gaussian function that is low-pass by nature and is restricted\nin representing high-frequency details in 3D scenes. Moreover, it causes\nredundant primitives with degraded training and rendering efficiency and\nexcessive memory overhead. To overcome these limitations, we propose 3D Gabor\nSplatting (3DGabSplat) that leverages a novel 3D Gabor-based primitive with\nmultiple directional 3D frequency responses for radiance field representation\nsupervised by multi-view images. The proposed 3D Gabor-based primitive forms a\nfilter bank incorporating multiple 3D Gabor kernels at different frequencies to\nenhance flexibility and efficiency in capturing fine 3D details. Furthermore,\nto achieve novel view rendering, an efficient CUDA-based rasterizer is\ndeveloped to project the multiple directional 3D frequency components\ncharacterized by 3D Gabor-based primitives onto the 2D image plane, and a\nfrequency-adaptive mechanism is presented for adaptive joint optimization of\nprimitives. 3DGabSplat is scalable to be a plug-and-play kernel for seamless\nintegration into existing 3DGS paradigms to enhance both efficiency and quality\nof novel view synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 3DGabSplat\noutperforms 3DGS and its variants using alternative primitives, and achieves\nstate-of-the-art rendering quality across both real-world and synthetic scenes.\nRemarkably, we achieve up to 1.35 dB PSNR gain over 3DGS with simultaneously\nreduced number of primitives and memory consumption.",

    "abstract": "Quantum machine learning is known as one of the promising applications of\nquantum computers. Many types of quantum machine learning methods have been\nreleased, such as Quantum Annealer, Quantum Neural Network, Variational Quantum\nAlgorithms, and Quantum Reservoir Computers. They can work, consuming far less\nenergy for networks of equivalent size. Quantum Reservoir Computers, in\nparticular, have no limit on the size of input data. However, their accuracy is\nnot enough for practical use, and the effort to improve accuracy is mainly\nfocused on hardware improvements. Therefore, we propose the approach from\nsoftware called Quantum Reservoir Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), which\nuses Quantum Reservoir Computers as a generator of GAN. We performed the\ngeneration of handwritten single digits and monochrome pictures on the CIFAR-10\nand Fashion-MNIST datasets. As a result, Quantum Reservoir GAN is confirmed to\nbe more accurate than Quantum GAN, Classical Neural Network, and ordinary\nQuantum Reservoir Computers.",

    "abstract": "Recent Large Reasoning Language Models (LRLMs) employ long chain-of-thought\nreasoning with complex reflection behaviors, typically signaled by specific\ntrigger words (e.g., \"Wait\" and \"Alternatively\") to enhance performance.\nHowever, these reflection behaviors can lead to the overthinking problem where\nthe generation of redundant reasoning steps that unnecessarily increase token\nusage, raise inference costs, and reduce practical utility. In this paper, we\npropose Certainty-Guided Reflection Suppression (CGRS), a novel method that\nmitigates overthinking in LRLMs while maintaining reasoning accuracy. CGRS\noperates by dynamically suppressing the model's generation of reflection\ntriggers when it exhibits high confidence in its current response, thereby\npreventing redundant reflection cycles without compromising output quality. Our\napproach is model-agnostic, requires no retraining or architectural\nmodifications, and can be integrated seamlessly with existing autoregressive\ngeneration pipelines. Extensive experiments across four reasoning benchmarks\n(i.e., AIME24, AMC23, MATH500, and GPQA-D) demonstrate CGRS's effectiveness: it\nreduces token usage by an average of 18.5% to 41.9% while preserving accuracy.\nIt also achieves the optimal balance between length reduction and performance\ncompared to state-of-the-art baselines. These results hold consistently across\nmodel architectures (e.g., DeepSeek-R1-Distill series, QwQ-32B, and Qwen3\nfamily) and scales (4B to 32B parameters), highlighting CGRS's practical value\nfor efficient reasoning.",

This\nmethod leverages non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) training\ndata from different vehicles, influenced by various driving patterns and\nenvironmental conditions, which can significantly impact model convergence and\naccuracy. Although client selection can be a feasible solution for non-IID\nissues, it faces challenges related to selection metrics.

Critical thinking is particularly crucial for visualisation\ndesigners and tool developers, especially those new to the field, such as\nstudying visualisation in higher education.

Stage 2 involves an in-depth critique using\n30 heuristic questions spanning six key perspectives - user, environment,\ninterface, components, design, and visual marks.

While the initial VLM\nweights allow for great few-shot transfer learning, this usually involves the\nloss of the original natural language querying and zero-shot capabilities.\nInspired by the success of Textual Inversion (TI) in personalizing\ntext-to-image diffusion models, we propose a similar formulation for\nopen-vocabulary object detection. TI allows extending the VLM vocabulary by\nlearning new or improving existing tokens to accurately detect novel or\nfine-grained objects from as little as three examples. The learned tokens are\ncompletely compatible with the original VLM weights while keeping them frozen,\nretaining the original model's benchmark performance, and leveraging its\nexisting capabilities such as zero-shot domain transfer (e.g., detecting a\nsketch of an object after training only on real photos). The storage and\ngradient calculations are limited to the token embedding dimension, requiring\nsignificantly less compute than full-model fine-tuning.

To overcome these challenges, a promising solution is to integrate\nmultimodal knowledge graphs (KGs) into RAG-based VQA frameworks to enhance the\ngeneration by introducing structured multimodal knowledge.

In addition, a\ndual-stage retrieval strategy equipped with a question-aware multimodal\nretriever is introduced to improve retrieval efficiency while refining\nprecision.

To reduce the number of\nrequired queries, existing methods employ active learning to query the human\nteacher only in uncertain, risky, or novel situations. However, during these\nqueries, the novice's planned actions are not utilized despite containing\nvaluable information, such as the novice's capabilities, as well as\ncorresponding uncertainty levels. To this end, we allow the novice to say: \"I\nplan to do this, but I am uncertain.\" We introduce the Active Skill-level Data\nAggregation (ASkDAgger) framework, which leverages teacher feedback on the\nnovice plan in three key ways: (1) S-Aware Gating (SAG): Adjusts the gating\nthreshold to track sensitivity, specificity, or a minimum success rate; (2)\nForesight Interactive Experience Replay (FIER), which recasts valid and\nrelabeled novice action plans into demonstrations; and (3) Prioritized\nInteractive Experience Replay (PIER), which prioritizes replay based on\nuncertainty, novice success, and demonstration age. Together, these components\nbalance query frequency with failure incidence, reduce the number of required\ndemonstration annotations, improve generalization, and speed up adaptation to\nchanging domains. We validate the effectiveness of ASkDAgger through\nlanguage-conditioned manipulation tasks in both simulation and real-world\nenvironments.

    "abstract": "Pinching antenna system (PASS) has recently shown its promising ability to\nflexibly reconfigure wireless channels via dynamically adjusting the positions\nof pinching antennas over a dielectric waveguide, termed as pinching\nbeamforming. This paper studies the fundamental limit of the sum rate for a\nPASS-assisted multiple access channel, where multiple users transmit individual\nmessages to a base station under the average power constraint. To this end, a\ndynamic pinching beamforming setup is conceived, where multiple pinching\nbeamforming vectors are employed in a transmission period and the\ncapacity-achieving non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) based scheme is\nconsidered. For the ideal case with an asymptotically large number of pinching\nbeamforming vectors, the optimal transmission scheme is unveiled to carry out\nalternating transmission among each user whose channel power gain is maximized\nwith the tailored pinching beamforming. This implies that NOMA is not needed\nfor achieving the sum capacity and the required optimal number of pinching\nbeamforming vectors is equal to the number of users. With this insight, the\ncorresponding sum rate is derived in closed-form expression, which serves as\nthe upper bound of the sum rate. Inspired by this result, a lower bound of the\nsum rate under an arbitrarily finite number of pinching beamforming vectors is\nobtained. Numerical results validate our theoretical findings and also\nillustrate the practical significance of using dynamic pinching beamforming to\nimprove the sum rate.",

Aims.\nThis paper is the first of a suite aimed at investigating the complex early\nstellar dynamics in star-forming regions. We present a new simulation framework\nwhich is the key to generating a larger set of simulations, enabling\nstatistical analysis. Methods. Methods originating from the stellar dynamics\ncommunity, including regularisation and slowdown methods (SDAR), have been\nadded to the hydrodynamical code Phantom to produce simulations of embedded\ncluster early dynamics. This is completed by a novel prescription of star\nformation to initialise stars with a low numerical cost, but in a way that is\nconsistent with the gas distribution. Finally, a prescription for H ii region\nexpansion has been added to model the gas removal. Results. We have run\ntestcase simulations following the dynamical evolution of stellar clusters from\nthe cloud collapse to a few Myr. Our new numerical methods fulfil their\nfunction by speeding up the calculation. The N-body dynamics with our novel\nimplementation never appear as a bottleneck. Our first simulations show that\nmassive stars largely impact the star formation process and shape the dynamics\nof the resulting cluster. Depending on the position of these massive stars and\nthe strength of their feedback, they can prematurely dismantle part of the\ncloud or trigger a second event of cloud collapse, preferentially forming\nlow-mass stars. This stochastic behaviour confirms the need for statistical\nstudies. Conclusions. Our new Phantom N-Body framework enables efficient\nsimulation of the formation and evolution of star clusters. It enables the\nstatistical analysis needed to build models of the dynamical evolution of\nembedded star clusters.",

Using Pontryagin's\nMaximum Principle, indirect methods provide necessary optimality conditions by\ntransforming the control problem into a two-point boundary value problem.\nHowever, these approaches are often sensitive to initial guesses and can be\ncomputationally challenging, especially when dealing with complex constraints.\nIn contrast, direct methods, which discretise the optimal control problem into\na nonlinear programming (NLP) formulation, could offer robust, adaptable\nsolutions for real-time decision-making.

    "abstract": "Advances in simultaneous recordings of large numbers of neurons have driven\nsignificant interest in the structure of neural population activity such as\ndimension. A key question is how these dynamic features arise mechanistically\nand their relationship to circuit connectivity. It was previously proposed to\nuse the covariance eigenvalue distribution, or spectrum, which can be\nanalytically derived in random recurrent networks, as a robust measure to\ndescribe the shape of neural population activity beyond the dimension (Hu and\nSompolinsky 2022). Applications of the theoretical spectrum have broadly found\naccurate matches to experimental data across brain areas providing mechanistic\ninsights into the observed low dimensional population dynamics (Morales et al.\n2023). However, the empirical success highlights a gap in theory, as the neural\nnetwork model used to derive the spectrum was minimal with linear neurons. In\nthis work, we aim to close this gap by studying the covariance spectrum in\nnetworks with nonlinear neurons and under broader dynamical regimes including\nchaos. Surprisingly, we found that the spectrum can be precisely understood by\nequations analogous to the linear theory substituted with an effective\nrecurrent connection strength parameter, that reflects both the connection\nweights and the nonlinearity of neurons. Across dynamical regimes, this\neffective connection strength provides a unified interpretation for the\nspectrum and dimension changes, and stays near the critical value in the\nchaotic regime without fine-tuning. These results further our understanding of\nnonlinear neural population dynamics and provide additional theoretical support\nfor applying the covariance spectrum analysis in biological circuits.",

    "abstract": "Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has significantly advanced the reasoning\ncapabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the reliability of these\nreasoning chains remains a critical challenge. A widely held \"cascading\nfailure\" hypothesis suggests that errors are most detrimental when they occur\nearly in the reasoning process. This paper challenges that assumption through\nsystematic error-injection experiments, revealing a counter-intuitive\nphenomenon we term \"Late-Stage Fragility\": errors introduced in the later\nstages of a CoT chain are significantly more likely to corrupt the final answer\nthan identical errors made at the beginning. To address this specific\nvulnerability, we introduce the Adaptive Self-Correction Chain-of-Thought\n(ASCoT) method. ASCoT employs a modular pipeline in which an Adaptive\nVerification Manager (AVM) operates first, followed by the Multi-Perspective\nSelf-Correction Engine (MSCE). The AVM leverages a Positional Impact Score\nfunction I(k) that assigns different weights based on the position within the\nreasoning chains, addressing the Late-Stage Fragility issue by identifying and\nprioritizing high-risk, late-stage steps. Once these critical steps are\nidentified, the MSCE applies robust, dual-path correction specifically to the\nfailure parts. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as GSM8K and MATH\ndemonstrate that ASCoT achieves outstanding accuracy, outperforming strong\nbaselines, including standard CoT. Our work underscores the importance of\ndiagnosing specific failure modes in LLM reasoning and advocates for a shift\nfrom uniform verification strategies to adaptive, vulnerability-aware\ncorrection mechanisms.",

However, the parameter estimation of LMMs imposes substantial\ncomputational burdens due to large-scale operations on genetic similarity\nmatrices (GSM). We introduced the near-exact linear mixed model (NExt-LMM), a\nnovel LMM framework that overcomes critical computational bottlenecks in GWAS\nthrough the following key innovations. Firstly, we exploit the inherent\nlow-rank structure of the GSM iteratively with the Hierarchical Off-Diagonal\nLow-Rank (HODLR) format, which is much faster than traditional decomposition\nmethods. Secondly, we leverage the HODLR-approximated GSM to dramatically\naccelerate the further maximum likelihood estimation with the shared\nheritability ratios. Moreover, we establish rigorous error bounds for the\nNExt-LMM estimator, proving that Kullback-Leibler divergence between the\napproximated and exact estimators can be arbitrarily small. Consequently, our\nproposed dual approach accelerates inference of LMMs while guaranteeing low\napproximation errors. We use numerical experiments to demonstrate that the\nNExt-LMM significantly improves inference efficiency compared to existing\nmethods.

    "abstract": "There is lattice evidence that the QCD matter above the chiral restoration\ntemperature Tch and below the deconfinement temperature Td, called stringy\nfluid, is characterized by an approximate chiral spin symmetry, which is a\nsymmetry of confinement in QCD with light quarks. The energy density, pressure\nand entropy density in the stringy fluid scale as Nc^1, which is in contrast to\nthe Nc^0 scaling in the hadron gas and to the Nc^2 scaling in the quark-gluon\nplasma. Here we clarify the origin of the Nc^1 scaling. We employ a solvable\nfield-theoretical large $N_c$ chirally symmetric and confining model. In vacuum\nthe confining potential induces a spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry. The\nmesons are spatially localized states of quarks and antiquarks. Still in the\nconfining regime the system undergoes the chiral restoration phase transition\nat $T_{ch}$ because of Paili blocking of the quark levels required for the\nexistence of the quark condensate, by the thermal excitation of quarks and\nantiquarks. The same Paili blocking leads to a delocalization of the color\nsinglet low-spin meson-like states that become infinitely large in the chiral\nlimit. Consequently the stringy fluid represents a very dense medium of the\noverlapping huge color-singlet low-spin quark-antiquark systems. The\nBethe-Salpeter equation that determines the rest-frame excitation energies of\nthe color-singlet quark-antiquark system is Nc-independent both in vacuum and\nin the medium in the confining regime. The excitation energy of the\nquark-antiquark color-singlet systems scales as Nc^0, i.e. as meson mass in\nvacuum. The Nc^1 scaling of the energy density in the stringy fluid is provided\nby the fluctuations of the color-singlet quark-antiquark systems.",

However, practitioners have refrained from using it in applications\nfor two reasons: Firstly, it comes at very high computational costs, exceeding\neven that of cross-validation. Secondly, an applicant is typically not\ninterested in a marginal coverage guarantee which averages over all possible\n(but not available) training data sets, but rather in a guarantee conditional\non the specific training data. This work tackles these problems by, firstly,\nshowing that full conformal prediction sets are conditionally conservative\ngiven the training data if the conformity score is stochastically bounded and\nsatisfies a stability condition. Secondly, we propose an approximation for the\nfull conformal prediction set that has asymptotically the same training\nconditional coverage as full conformal prediction under the stability\nassumption derived before, and can be computed more easily. Furthermore, we\nshow that under the stability assumption, $n$-fold cross-conformal prediction\nalso has the same asymptotic training conditional coverage guarantees as full\nconformal prediction. If the conformity score is defined as the out-of-sample\nprediction error, our approximation of the full conformal set coincides with\nthe symmetrized Jackknife. We conclude that for this conformity score, if based\non a stable prediction algorithm, full-conformal, $n$-fold cross-conformal, the\nJackknife+, our approximation formula, and hence also the Jackknife, all yield\nthe same asymptotic training conditional coverage guarantees.",

We observe that\nfrequency-domain feature modeling particularly in the wavelet domain an amplify\nfine-grained differences in frequency components, enhancing the perception of\nedge changes that are challenging to capture in the spatial domain. Thus, we\npropose a method called Wavelet-Guided Dual-Frequency Encoding (WGDF).\nSpecifically, we first apply Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to decompose the\ninput images into high-frequency and low-frequency components, which are used\nto model local details and global structures, respectively. In the\nhigh-frequency branch, we design a Dual-Frequency Feature Enhancement (DFFE)\nmodule to strengthen edge detail representation and introduce a\nFrequency-Domain Interactive Difference (FDID) module to enhance the modeling\nof fine-grained changes. In the low-frequency branch, we exploit Transformers\nto capture global semantic relationships and employ a Progressive Contextual\nDifference Module (PCDM) to progressively refine change regions, enabling\nprecise structural semantic characterization. Finally, the high- and\nlow-frequency features are synergistically fused to unify local sensitivity\nwith global discriminability. Extensive experiments on multiple remote sensing\ndatasets demonstrate that WGDF significantly alleviates edge ambiguity and\nachieves superior detection accuracy and robustness compared to\nstate-of-the-art methods.

However, despite their potential, 4D LiDAR\nremains underexplored in the context of Multimodal Large Language Models\n(MLLMs) due to the absence of high-quality, modality-specific annotations and\nthe lack of MLLM architectures capable of processing its high-dimensional\ncomposition. To address these challenges, we introduce B4DL, a new benchmark\nspecifically designed for training and evaluating MLLMs on 4D LiDAR\nunderstanding. In addition, we propose a scalable data generation pipeline and\nan MLLM model that, for the first time, directly processes raw 4D LiDAR by\nbridging it with language understanding. Combined with our dataset and\nbenchmark, our model offers a unified solution for spatio-temporal reasoning in\ndynamic outdoor environments.

Errors arise from various factors, with limited understanding\nof specific failure causes hindering improvement. To address this, we conduct a\ncomprehensive error analysis and manual categorization. Our findings reveal\nthat most errors stem not from LLM reasoning limitations, but from insufficient\nRTL programming knowledge, poor understanding of circuit concepts, ambiguous\ndesign descriptions, or misinterpretation of complex multimodal inputs.\nLeveraging in-context learning, we propose targeted error correction\ntechniques. Specifically, we construct a domain-specific knowledge base and\nemploy retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to supply necessary RTL knowledge.\nTo mitigate ambiguity errors, we introduce design description rules and\nimplement a rule-checking mechanism. For multimodal misinterpretation, we\nintegrate external tools to convert inputs into LLM-compatible meta-formats.\nFor remaining errors, we adopt an iterative debugging loop (simulation-error\nlocalization-correction). Integrating these techniques into an LLM-based\nframework significantly improves performance. We incorporate these error\ncorrection techniques into a foundational LLM-based RTL code generation\nframework, resulting in significantly improved performance.

To address these issues, this paper proposes\nSGDFuse, a conditional diffusion model guided by the Segment Anything Model\n(SAM), to achieve high-fidelity and semantically-aware image fusion. The core\nof our method is to utilize high-quality semantic masks generated by SAM as\nexplicit priors to guide the optimization of the fusion process via a\nconditional diffusion model. Specifically, the framework operates in a\ntwo-stage process: it first performs a preliminary fusion of multi-modal\nfeatures, and then utilizes the semantic masks from SAM jointly with the\npreliminary fused image as a condition to drive the diffusion model's\ncoarse-to-fine denoising generation. This ensures the fusion process not only\nhas explicit semantic directionality but also guarantees the high fidelity of\nthe final result. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SGDFuse achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in both subjective and objective evaluations, as\nwell as in its adaptability to downstream tasks, providing a powerful solution\nto the core challenges in image fusion.

While some advanced methods use graph\nneural networks to model cell-cell relationships, they often depend on static\ngraph structures that are sensitive to noise and fail to capture the\nlong-tailed distribution inherent in single-cell populations.To address these\nlimitations, we propose scAGC, a single-cell clustering method that learns\nadaptive cell graphs with contrastive guidance.

While recent works have explored MoE compression to\naddress this issue, existing methods often suffer from considerable accuracy\ndrops (e.g., 7-14% relatively) even at modest compression rates. This paper\nintroduces a novel Mixture-of-Basis-Experts (MoBE) method that achieves model\ncompression while incurring minimal accuracy drops.

The factorization is learned by\nminimizing the reconstruction error relative to the original weight matrices.\nExperiments demonstrate that MoBE achieves notably lower accuracy drops\ncompared to prior works.

This\npaper introduces a novel path-planning problem, congestion mitigation path\nplanning (CMPP), which embeds congestion directly into the cost function,\ndefined by the usage of incoming edges along agents' paths. CMPP assigns a\nflow-based multiplicative penalty to each vertex of a sparse graph, which grows\nsteeply where frequently-traversed paths intersect, capturing the intuition\nthat congestion intensifies where many agents enter the same area from\ndifferent directions. Minimizing the total cost yields a set of coarse-level,\ntime-independent routes that autonomous agents can follow while applying their\nown local collision avoidance. We formulate the problem and develop two\nsolvers: (i) an exact mixed-integer nonlinear programming solver for small\ninstances, and (ii) a scalable two-layer search algorithm, A-CMTS, which\nquickly finds suboptimal solutions for large-scale instances and iteratively\nrefines them toward the optimum. Empirical studies show that augmenting\nstate-of-the-art collision-avoidance planners with CMPP significantly reduces\nlocal congestion and enhances system throughput in both discrete- and\ncontinuous-space scenarios.

CodeBoost introduces\nthe following key components: (1) maximum-clique curation, which selects a\nrepresentative and diverse training corpus from code; (2) bi-directional\nprediction, which enables the model to learn from both forward and backward\nprediction objectives; (3) error-aware prediction, which incorporates learning\nsignals from both correct and incorrect outputs; (4) heterogeneous\naugmentation, which diversifies the training distribution to enrich code\nsemantics; and (5) heterogeneous rewarding, which guides model learning through\nmultiple reward types including format correctness and execution feedback from\nboth successes and failures. Extensive experiments across several code LLMs and\nbenchmarks verify that CodeBoost consistently improves performance,\ndemonstrating its effectiveness as a scalable and effective training pipeline.",

The performance of the pension fund is\nevaluated not only at retirement, but also within the interim periods. In\ncontrast to the traditional literature, we set the dynamic risk measure as the\ncriterion and manage the tail risk of the pension fund dynamically. To\neffectively interact with the stochastic environment, a model-free\nreinforcement learning algorithm is proposed to search for optimal investment\nand insurance strategies. Using U.S. data, we calibrate pension members'\nmortality rates and enhance mortality projections through a Lee-Carter model.\nOur numerical results indicate that periodic evaluations lead to more\nrisk-averse strategies, while mortality improvements encourage more\nrisk-seeking behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) technology plays a critical role\nin future intelligent transportation systems, by enabling vehicles to perceive\nand reconstruct the surrounding environment through reuse of wireless signals,\nthereby reducing or even eliminating the need for additional sensors such as\nLiDAR or radar. However, existing ISAC based reconstruction methods often lack\nthe ability to track dynamic scenes with sufficient accuracy and temporal\nconsistency, limiting the real world applicability. To address this limitation,\nwe propose a deep learning based framework for vehicular environment\nreconstruction by using ISAC channels. We first establish a joint channel\nenvironment dataset based on multi modal measurements from real world urban\nstreet scenarios. Then, a multistage deep learning network is developed to\nreconstruct the environment. Specifically, a scene decoder identifies the\nenvironmental context such as buildings, trees and so on; a cluster center\ndecoder predicts coarse spatial layouts by localizing dominant scattering\ncenters; a point cloud decoder recovers fine grained geometry and structure of\nsurrounding environments. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed\nmethod achieves high-quality dynamic environment reconstruction with a Chamfer\nDistance of 0.29 and F Score@1% of 0.87. In addition, complexity analysis\ndemonstrates the efficiency and practical applicability of the method in real\ntime scenarios. This work provides a pathway toward low cost environment\nreconstruction based on ISAC for future intelligent transportation.",

    "abstract": "Natural language explanations in recommender systems are often framed as a\nreview generation task, leveraging user reviews as ground-truth supervision.\nWhile convenient, this approach conflates a user's opinion with the system's\nreasoning, leading to explanations that may be fluent but fail to reflect the\ntrue logic behind recommendations. In this work, we revisit the core objective\nof explainable recommendation: to transparently communicate why an item is\nrecommended by linking user needs to relevant item features. Through a\ncomprehensive analysis of existing methods across multiple benchmark datasets,\nwe identify common limitations-explanations that are weakly aligned with model\npredictions, vague or inaccurate in identifying user intents, and overly\nrepetitive or generic. To overcome these challenges, we propose FIRE, a\nlightweight and interpretable framework that combines SHAP-based feature\nattribution with structured, prompt-driven language generation. FIRE produces\nfaithful, diverse, and user-aligned explanations, grounded in the actual\ndecision-making process of the model. Our results demonstrate that FIRE not\nonly achieves competitive recommendation accuracy but also significantly\nimproves explanation quality along critical dimensions such as alignment,\nstructure, and faithfulness.

Here, we\nrevisit the role of voluntary participation by allowing non-participants to\nexert either positive or negative impacts on the public good. Using\nevolutionary analysis in a well-mixed finite population, we find that positive\nexternalities from non-participants lower the synergy threshold required for\naltruistic punishment to dominate. In contrast, negative externalities raise\nthis threshold, making altruistic punishment harder to sustain. Notably, when\nnon-participants have positive impacts, altruistic punishment thrives only if\nnon-participation is incentivized, whereas under negative impacts, it can\npersist even when non-participation is discouraged. Our findings reveal that\nefforts to promote altruistic punishment must account for the active role of\nnon-participants, whose influence can make or break collective outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across\ndistributed clients while preserving data privacy by keeping data local.\nTraditional FL approaches rely on a centralized, star-shaped topology, where a\ncentral server aggregates model updates from clients. However, this\narchitecture introduces several limitations, including a single point of\nfailure, limited personalization, and poor robustness to distribution shifts or\nvulnerability to malfunctioning clients. Moreover, update selection in\ncentralized FL often relies on low-level parameter differences, which can be\nunreliable when client data is not independent and identically distributed, and\noffer clients little control. In this work, we propose a decentralized,\npeer-to-peer (P2P) FL framework. It leverages the flexibility of the P2P\ntopology to enable each client to identify and aggregate a personalized set of\ntrustworthy and beneficial updates.This framework is the Local Inference Guided\nAggregation for Heterogeneous Training Environments to Yield Enhancement\nThrough Agreement and Regularization (LIGHTYEAR). Central to our method is an\nagreement score, computed on a local validation set, which quantifies the\nsemantic alignment of incoming updates in the function space with respect to\nthe clients reference model. Each client uses this score to select a tailored\nsubset of updates and performs aggregation with a regularization term that\nfurther stabilizes the training. Our empirical evaluation across two datasets\nshows that the proposed approach consistently outperforms both centralized\nbaselines and existing P2P methods in terms of client-level performance,\nparticularly under adversarial and heterogeneous conditions.",

To address these limitations, we\nintroduce High-Fidelity Mamba (HiFi-Mamba), a novel dual-stream Mamba-based\narchitecture comprising stacked W-Laplacian (WL) and HiFi-Mamba blocks.\nSpecifically, the WL block performs fidelity-preserving spectral decoupling,\nproducing complementary low- and high-frequency streams. This separation\nenables the HiFi-Mamba block to focus on low-frequency structures, enhancing\nglobal feature modeling. Concurrently, the HiFi-Mamba block selectively\nintegrates high-frequency features through adaptive state-space modulation,\npreserving comprehensive spectral details. To eliminate the scanning\nredundancy, the HiFi-Mamba block adopts a streamlined unidirectional traversal\nstrategy that preserves long-range modeling capability with improved\ncomputational efficiency. Extensive experiments on standard MRI reconstruction\nbenchmarks demonstrate that HiFi-Mamba consistently outperforms\nstate-of-the-art CNN-based, Transformer-based, and other Mamba-based models in\nreconstruction accuracy while maintaining a compact and efficient model design.",

Existing works\neither directly fuse the fixed language with vision features or simply modify\nusing attention, however, their performance is still limited. Recently, some\nresearchers have explored using text generation to adapt to the variations in\nthe target during tracking, however, these works fail to provide insights into\nthe model's reasoning process and do not fully leverage the advantages of large\nmodels, which further limits their overall performance. To address the\naforementioned issues, this paper proposes a novel reasoning-based\nvision-language tracking framework, named ReasoningTrack, based on a\npre-trained vision-language model Qwen2.5-VL. Both SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning)\nand reinforcement learning GRPO are used for the optimization of reasoning and\nlanguage generation. We embed the updated language descriptions and feed them\ninto a unified tracking backbone network together with vision features. Then,\nwe adopt a tracking head to predict the specific location of the target object.\nIn addition, we propose a large-scale long-term vision-language tracking\nbenchmark dataset, termed TNLLT, which contains 200 video sequences. 20\nbaseline visual trackers are re-trained and evaluated on this dataset, which\nbuilds a solid foundation for the vision-language visual tracking task.\nExtensive experiments on multiple vision-language tracking benchmark datasets\nfully validated the effectiveness of our proposed reasoning-based natural\nlanguage generation strategy.

This regime includes moderately\nconductive materials--such as carbon-based composites, conductive polymers, and\ndoped dielectrics--that are increasingly used in real-world radio-frequency\napplications, including wearable electronics, electromagnetic interference\nshielding, and biomedical sensors. Under the above validity conditions, the\ninteraction between the incident wave and the scatterer is dominated by surface\neffects, allowing for an efficient and accurate modeling strategy without the\nneed to compute internal fields. The theoretical formulation of the time-domain\nMAS-SIBC method is developed, followed by extensive numerical testing on\nvarious geometries whose cross section is a closed curve.

Propensity score-based weighting methods are widely used to\naddress this issue by reweighting samples to simulate a randomized controlled\ntrial (RCT). However, the effectiveness of these methods heavily depends on the\nobserved data and the accuracy of the propensity score estimator. For example,\ninverse propensity weighting (IPW) assigns weights based on the inverse of the\npropensity score, which can lead to instable weights when propensity scores\nhave high variance-either due to data or model misspecification-ultimately\ndegrading the ability of handling selection bias and treatment effect\nestimation. To overcome these limitations, we propose Deconfounding Factor\nWeighting (DFW), a novel propensity score-based approach that leverages the\ndeconfounding factor-to construct stable and effective sample weights. DFW\nprioritizes less confounded samples while mitigating the influence of highly\nconfounded ones, producing a pseudopopulation that better approximates a RCT.\nOur approach ensures bounded weights, lower variance, and improved covariate\nbalance.While DFW is formulated for binary treatments, it naturally extends to\nmulti-treatment settings, as the deconfounding factor is computed based on the\nestimated probability of the treatment actually received by each sample.\nThrough extensive experiments on real-world benchmark and synthetic datasets,\nwe demonstrate that DFW outperforms existing methods, including IPW and CBPS,\nin both covariate balancing and treatment effect estimation.",

Addressing this for linear\ntime-invariant (LTI) systems is an essential fist step towards solving similar\nproblems for more complex systems. In this paper, we develop a model-free\nreinforcement learning algorithm to compute stabilizing feedback gains for\nstochastic LTI systems with unknown system matrices. This algorithm proceeds by\nsolving a series of discounted stochastic linear quadratic (SLQ) optimal\ncontrol problems via policy iteration (PI).

    "abstract": "Few-Shot Segmentation(FSS) aims to efficient segmentation of new objects with\nfew labeled samples. However, its performance significantly degrades when\ndomain discrepancies exist between training and deployment. Cross-Domain\nFew-Shot Segmentation(CD-FSS) is proposed to mitigate such performance\ndegradation. Current CD-FSS methods primarily sought to develop segmentation\nmodels on a source domain capable of cross-domain generalization. However,\ndriven by escalating concerns over data privacy and the imperative to minimize\ndata transfer and training expenses, the development of source-free CD-FSS\napproaches has become essential. In this work, we propose a source-free CD-FSS\nmethod that leverages both textual and visual information to facilitate target\ndomain task adaptation without requiring source domain data. Specifically, we\nfirst append Task-Specific Attention Adapters (TSAA) to the feature pyramid of\na pretrained backbone, which adapt multi-level features extracted from the\nshared pre-trained backbone to the target task. Then, the parameters of the\nTSAA are trained through a Visual-Visual Embedding Alignment (VVEA) module and\na Text-Visual Embedding Alignment (TVEA) module. The VVEA module utilizes\nglobal-local visual features to align image features across different views,\nwhile the TVEA module leverages textual priors from pre-aligned multi-modal\nfeatures (e.g., from CLIP) to guide cross-modal adaptation. By combining the\noutputs of these modules through dense comparison operations and subsequent\nfusion via skip connections, our method produces refined prediction masks.\nUnder both 1-shot and 5-shot settings, the proposed approach achieves average\nsegmentation accuracy improvements of 2.18\\% and 4.11\\%, respectively, across\nfour cross-domain datasets, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art CD-FSS\nmethods.

Previous research aimed\nat reducing visual tokens during inference typically leverages importance maps\nderived from attention scores among vision-only tokens or vision-language\ntokens to prune tokens across one or multiple pruning stages. Despite this\nprogress, pruning frameworks and strategies remain simplistic and\ninsufficiently explored, often resulting in substantial performance\ndegradation. In this paper, we propose VFlowOpt, a token pruning framework that\nintroduces an importance map derivation process and a progressive pruning\nmodule with a recycling mechanism. The hyperparameters of its pruning strategy\nare further optimized by a visual information flow-guided method. Specifically,\nwe compute an importance map for image tokens based on their attention-derived\ncontext relevance and patch-level information entropy. We then decide which\ntokens to retain or prune and aggregate the pruned ones as recycled tokens to\navoid potential information loss. Finally, we apply a visual information\nflow-guided method that regards the last token in the LMM as the most\nrepresentative signal of text-visual interactions. This method minimizes the\ndiscrepancy between token representations in LMMs with and without pruning,\nthereby enabling superior pruning strategies tailored to different LMMs.\nExperiments demonstrate that VFlowOpt can prune 90% of visual tokens while\nmaintaining comparable performance, leading to an 89% reduction in KV-Cache\nmemory and 3.8 times faster inference.",

A well-established measure to quantify the system's distance from\nequilibrium is the informatic entropy production rate. Here, we ask the\nquestion whether and how the informatic entropy production rate reflects\ncollective behaviors and transitions in an active mixture with non-reciprocal\npolar couplings. In such systems, non-reciprocal orientational couplings can\ninduce chiral motion of particles. At the field-theoretical level, transitions\nto these time-dependent chiral states are marked by so-called exceptional\npoints. Here, we show that at a particle level, the entropy production rate\nwithin the chiral states increases with the degree of non-reciprocity, provided\nit is sufficiently strong. Moreover, even at small degrees of non-reciprocity,\nthe transitions via exceptional points leave clear signatures in the entropy\nproduction rate, which exhibits pronounced peaks at coupling strengths\ncorresponding to the field-theoretical exceptional points. Overall, the\nincrease and peaks of the entropy production rate mirror the susceptibility of\nthe polarization order parameter at the particle level. This correspondence is\nsupported by a field-theoretical analysis, which reveals that, in the\nlong-wavelength limit, the entropy production rate scales with the\nsusceptibilities of the polarization fields.",

To address these challenges, we propose EndoMatcher, a\ngeneralizable endoscopic image matcher via large-scale, multi-domain data\npre-training. To address difficult visual conditions, EndoMatcher employs a\ntwo-branch Vision Transformer to extract multi-scale features, enhanced by dual\ninteraction blocks for robust correspondence learning.

    "abstract": "Spectral information has long been recognized as a critical cue in remote\nsensing observations. Although numerous vision-language models have been\ndeveloped for pixel-level interpretation, spectral information remains\nunderutilized, resulting in suboptimal performance, particularly in\nmultispectral scenarios. To address this limitation, we construct a\nvision-language instruction-following dataset named SPIE, which encodes\nspectral priors of land-cover objects into textual attributes recognizable by\nlarge language models (LLMs), based on classical spectral index computations.\nLeveraging this dataset, we propose SPEX, a multimodal LLM designed for\ninstruction-driven land cover extraction. To this end, we introduce several\ncarefully designed components and training strategies, including multiscale\nfeature aggregation, token context condensation, and multispectral visual\npre-training, to achieve precise and flexible pixel-level interpretation. To\nthe best of our knowledge, SPEX is the first multimodal vision-language model\ndedicated to land cover extraction in spectral remote sensing imagery.\nExtensive experiments on five public multispectral datasets demonstrate that\nSPEX consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in extracting\ntypical land cover categories such as vegetation, buildings, and water bodies.\nMoreover, SPEX is capable of generating textual explanations for its\npredictions, thereby enhancing interpretability and user-friendliness.

Current THz\nnonreciprocal devices mostly rely on magnetic materials, which, however, suffer\nfrom large volume, operation under an external magnetic field, and\nlow-temperature environment, rendering them poorly compatible with miniaturized\ndevelopments. Here,we propose an unconventional method for achieving THz\nnonreciprocity free from magnetic materials. The scheme relies on a temporal\ndissipative barrier, a transient loss variation generated by photoexcited\ncarriers, and the nonreciprocity arises from the distinct coupling behavior for\ndifferent polarizations with the barrier. The isolation efficiency correlates\nwith the temporal barrier width, resonant mode detuning, and the working\nfrequency, and has been significantly enhanced by introducing a dark mode. We\nexperimentally confirm our method in a THz optically active metasurface with\nwave-flow isolation exceeding 20 dB across a bandwidth greater than 0.4 THz.\nTheoretical predictions indicate peak isolation surpassing 60 dB, with\nexperimental results achieving over 30 dB at 0.7 THz.

Although Vision-Language Models (VLMs)\ndemonstrate significant advantages in generalization capabilities, their\nperformance in industrial anomaly detection remains limited. To address this\nchallenge, we propose IAD-R1, a universal post-training framework applicable to\nVLMs of different architectures and parameter scales, which substantially\nenhances their anomaly detection capabilities. IAD-R1 employs a two-stage\ntraining strategy: the Perception Activation Supervised Fine-Tuning (PA-SFT)\nstage utilizes a meticulously constructed high-quality Chain-of-Thought dataset\n(Expert-AD) for training, enhancing anomaly perception capabilities and\nestablishing reasoning-to-answer correlations; the Structured Control Group\nRelative Policy Optimization (SC-GRPO) stage employs carefully designed reward\nfunctions to achieve a capability leap from \"Anomaly Perception\" to \"Anomaly\nInterpretation\". Experimental results demonstrate that IAD-R1 achieves\nsignificant improvements across 7 VLMs, the largest improvement was on the DAGM\ndataset, with average accuracy 43.3% higher than the 0.5B baseline.

While PPS enhances\nrelevance in recommendation, it often reinforces already-known content,\nlimiting the system's ability to surface novel or serendipitous items - key\nelements for fostering long-term user engagement and satisfaction.

To address these issues,\nwe introduce the Physics-Informed Time-Integrated Deep Operator Network\n(PITI-DeepONet), a dual-output architecture trained via fully physics-informed\nor hybrid physics- and data-driven objectives to ensure stable, accurate\nlong-term evolution well beyond the training horizon. Instead of forecasting\nfuture states, the network learns the time-derivative operator from the current\nstate, integrating it using classical time-stepping schemes to advance the\nsolution in time. Additionally, the framework can leverage residual monitoring\nduring inference to estimate prediction quality and detect when the system\ntransitions outside the training domain. Applied to benchmark problems,\nPITI-DeepONet shows improved accuracy over extended inference time horizons\nwhen compared to traditional methods. Mean relative $\\mathcal{L}_2$ errors\nreduced by 84% (vs. FR) and 79% (vs. AR) for the one-dimensional heat equation;\nby 87% (vs. FR) and 98% (vs. AR) for the one-dimensional Burgers equation; and\nby 42% (vs. FR) and 89% (vs. AR) for the two-dimensional Allen-Cahn equation.\nBy moving beyond classic FR and AR schemes, PITI-DeepONet paves the way for\nmore reliable, long-term integration of complex, time-dependent PDEs.",

    "abstract": "Timely and effective incident response is key to managing the growing\nfrequency of cyberattacks. However, identifying the right response actions for\ncomplex systems is a major technical challenge. A promising approach to\nmitigate this challenge is to use the security knowledge embedded in large\nlanguage models (LLMs) to assist security operators during incident handling.\nRecent research has demonstrated the potential of this approach, but current\nmethods are mainly based on prompt engineering of frontier LLMs, which is\ncostly and prone to hallucinations. We address these limitations by presenting\na novel way to use an LLM for incident response planning with reduced\nhallucination. Our method includes three steps: fine-tuning, information\nretrieval, and lookahead planning. We prove that our method generates response\nplans with a bounded probability of hallucination and that this probability can\nbe made arbitrarily small at the expense of increased planning time under\ncertain assumptions. Moreover, we show that our method is lightweight and can\nrun on commodity hardware. We evaluate our method on logs from incidents\nreported in the literature. The experimental results show that our method a)\nachieves up to 22% shorter recovery times than frontier LLMs and b) generalizes\nto a broad range of incident types and response actions.",

Furthermore, we also provide\ntheoretical analysis to support our method, including the generalization bound\nof graph-based DA and the role of spectral alignment and smoothing consistency.\nExtensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SPA++ consistently\noutperforms existing cutting-edge methods, achieving superior robustness and\nadaptability across various challenging adaptation scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Consider a collection of competing machine learning algorithms. Given their\nperformance on a benchmark of datasets, we would like to identify the best\nperforming algorithm. Specifically, which algorithm is most likely to rank\nhighest on a future, unseen dataset. A natural approach is to select the\nalgorithm that demonstrates the best performance on the benchmark. However, in\nmany cases the performance differences are marginal and additional candidates\nmay also be considered. This problem is formulated as subset selection for\nmultinomial distributions. Formally, given a sample from a countable alphabet,\nour goal is to identify a minimal subset of symbols that includes the most\nfrequent symbol in the population with high confidence. In this work, we\nintroduce a novel framework for the subset selection problem. We provide both\nasymptotic and finite-sample schemes that significantly improve upon currently\nknown methods. In addition, we provide matching lower bounds, demonstrating the\nfavorable performance of our proposed schemes.",

However, current paradigms rely on outcome-based\nrewards from test cases, neglecting the quality of the intermediate reasoning\nprocess. While supervising the reasoning process directly is a promising\ndirection, it is highly susceptible to reward hacking, where the policy model\nlearns to exploit the reasoning reward signal without improving final outcomes.\nTo address this, we introduce a unified framework that can effectively\nincorporate the quality of the reasoning process during RL. First, to enable\nreasoning evaluation, we develop LCB-RB, a benchmark comprising preference\npairs of superior and inferior reasoning processes. Second, to accurately score\nreasoning quality, we introduce an Optimized-Degraded based (OD-based) method\nfor reward model training. This method generates high-quality preference pairs\nby systematically optimizing and degrading initial reasoning paths along\ncurated dimensions of reasoning quality, such as factual accuracy, logical\nrigor, and coherence. A 7B parameter reward model with this method achieves\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on LCB-RB and generalizes well to other\nbenchmarks. Finally, we introduce Posterior-GRPO (P-GRPO), a novel RL method\nthat conditions process-based rewards on task success. By selectively applying\nrewards to the reasoning processes of only successful outcomes, P-GRPO\neffectively mitigates reward hacking and aligns the model's internal reasoning\nwith final code correctness. A 7B parameter model with P-GRPO achieves superior\nperformance across diverse code generation tasks, outperforming outcome-only\nbaselines by 4.5%, achieving comparable performance to GPT-4-Turbo. We further\ndemonstrate the generalizability of our approach by extending it to\nmathematical tasks. Our models, dataset, and code are publicly available.",

While existing\nmethods typically model human and animal motion separately, a joint\ncross-species approach offers key advantages, such as a unified representation\nand improved generalization. However, morphological differences across species\nremain a key challenge, often compromising motion plausibility. To address\nthis, we propose \\textbf{X-MoGen}, the first unified framework for\ncross-species text-driven motion generation covering both humans and animals.\nX-MoGen adopts a two-stage architecture. First, a conditional graph variational\nautoencoder learns canonical T-pose priors, while an autoencoder encodes motion\ninto a shared latent space regularized by morphological loss. In the second\nstage, we perform masked motion modeling to generate motion embeddings\nconditioned on textual descriptions. During training, a morphological\nconsistency module is employed to promote skeletal plausibility across species.\nTo support unified modeling, we construct \\textbf{UniMo4D}, a large-scale\ndataset of 115 species and 119k motion sequences, which integrates human and\nanimal motions under a shared skeletal topology for joint training. Extensive\nexperiments on UniMo4D demonstrate that X-MoGen outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods on both seen and unseen species.",

    "abstract": "The arbitrary-scale image super-resolution (ASISR), a recent popular topic in\ncomputer vision, aims to achieve arbitrary-scale high-resolution recoveries\nfrom a low-resolution input image. This task is realized by representing the\nimage as a continuous implicit function through two fundamental modules, a\ndeep-network-based encoder and an implicit neural representation (INR) module.\nDespite achieving notable progress, a crucial challenge of such a highly\nill-posed setting is that many common geometric patterns, such as repetitive\ntextures, edges, or shapes, are seriously warped and deformed in the\nlow-resolution images, naturally leading to unexpected artifacts appearing in\ntheir high-resolution recoveries. Embedding rotation equivariance into the\nASISR network is thus necessary, as it has been widely demonstrated that this\nenhancement enables the recovery to faithfully maintain the original\norientations and structural integrity of geometric patterns underlying the\ninput image. Motivated by this, we make efforts to construct a rotation\nequivariant ASISR method in this study. Specifically, we elaborately redesign\nthe basic architectures of INR and encoder modules, incorporating intrinsic\nrotation equivariance capabilities beyond those of conventional ASISR networks.\nThrough such amelioration, the ASISR network can, for the first time, be\nimplemented with end-to-end rotational equivariance maintained from input to\noutput. We also provide a solid theoretical analysis to evaluate its intrinsic\nequivariance error, demonstrating its inherent nature of embedding such an\nequivariance structure. The superiority of the proposed method is substantiated\nby experiments conducted on both simulated and real datasets. We also validate\nthat the proposed framework can be readily integrated into current ASISR\nmethods in a plug \\& play manner to further enhance their performance.",

Recent developments have\nestablished that a transition operator $T_{AB}$ can be well-defined for such\nsubregions, which is generally non-Hermitian. By employing the\nSchwinger-Keldysh formalism and the real-time replica method, we show how to\nconstruct $T_{AB}$ and compute associated entanglement measures. In certain\nconfigurations, this leads to a notion of timelike entanglement entropy, for\nwhich we provide explicit quantum field theory computations and propose a\nholographic dual via analytic continuation from the Euclidean setup. Both\nanalytical and numerical results are compared and found consistent.\n  If entanglement between causally connected subregions is to be meaningful, it\nshould also be able to define other entanglement measures. Motivated by the\nspacelike case, we propose a timelike extension of the entanglement wedge cross\nsection, though we do not expect it to carry the same physical interpretation.\nIn AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$, we compute explicit examples and find that the timelike\nentanglement wedge cross section is generally positive. Furthermore, we show\nthat the reflected entropy for timelike intervals -- obtained via analytic\ncontinuation of twist correlators -- coincides with twice the timelike\nentanglement wedge cross section at leading order in $G$, supporting a\nholographic duality in the timelike case. We also discuss the extension of\nother entanglement measures, such as logarithmic negativity, to timelike\nseparated regions using replica methods.

Furthermore, we introduce a data-free\nreplay strategy motivated by DeepInversion to facilitate backward transfer,\nenhancing existing clients' performance without compromising privacy.

    "abstract": "The integration of robotics and automation into self-driving laboratories\n(SDLs) can introduce additional safety complexities, in addition to those that\nalready apply to conventional research laboratories. Personal protective\nequipment (PPE) is an essential requirement for ensuring the safety and\nwell-being of workers in laboratories, self-driving or otherwise. Fires are\nanother important risk factor in chemical laboratories. In SDLs, fires that\noccur close to mobile robots, which use flammable lithium batteries, could have\nincreased severity. Here, we present Chemist Eye, a distributed safety\nmonitoring system designed to enhance situational awareness in SDLs. The system\nintegrates multiple stations equipped with RGB, depth, and infrared cameras,\ndesigned to monitor incidents in SDLs. Chemist Eye is also designed to spot\nworkers who have suffered a potential accident or medical emergency, PPE\ncompliance and fire hazards. To do this, Chemist Eye uses decision-making\ndriven by a vision-language model (VLM). Chemist Eye is designed for seamless\nintegration, enabling real-time communication with robots. Based on the VLM\nrecommendations, the system attempts to drive mobile robots away from potential\nfire locations, exits, or individuals not wearing PPE, and issues audible\nwarnings where necessary. It also integrates with third-party messaging\nplatforms to provide instant notifications to lab personnel. We tested Chemist\nEye with real-world data from an SDL equipped with three mobile robots and\nfound that the spotting of possible safety hazards and decision-making\nperformances reached 97 % and 95 %, respectively.",

Specifically, we\nintroduce a wireless environment knowledge (WEK) construction method that\nextracts ECB from the digital twin environment via subspace estimation.

Hence, an ECB-based partial-to-whole CSI prediction network\n(ECB-P2WNet) is designed to achieve a robust channel prediction scheme in\nvarious complex scenarios. Simulation results indicate that incorporating ECB\nprovides significant benefits under low signal-to-noise ratio and pilot ratio\nconditions, achieving a reduction of up to 50\\% in pilot overhead.\nAdditionally, the proposed method maintains robustness against multi-user\ninterference, tolerating 3-meter localization errors with only a 0.5 dB\nnormalized mean square error increase, and predicts CSI for the next channel\ncoherent time within 1.3 milliseconds.",

Hierarchical Federated\nLearning (HFL) addresses these issues by distributing model aggregation tasks\nacross intermediate nodes (stations), thereby enhancing system scalability and\nrobustness against single points of failure. However, HFL still suffers from a\ncritical yet often overlooked limitation: domain shift, where data\ndistributions vary significantly across different clients and stations,\nreducing model performance on unseen target domains.

While\ntraditionally treated as distinct procedures, they appear on an equal footing\nin the homotopy-algebraic approach to quantum field theory. In this work, we\nformalise this connection by interpreting both twisting and the introduction of\nclassical backgrounds as instances of twisting curved quantum\n$L_\\infty$-superalgebras. Using the language of homotopy algebras and the\nBatalin-Vilkovisky formalism, we provide a unified algebraic framework that\nencompasses topological/holomorphic twists, spontaneous symmetry breaking,\ncomputation of anomalies, and supersymmetric localisation \\`a la\nFestuccia--Seiberg. As a byproduct, we introduce a notion of twisting for\nquantum $L_\\infty$-algebras and a homotopy-algebraic reformulation of the\none-particle-irreducible effective action.",

The model\nincludes two distinct couplings: $J_d$ on the dimer bonds and $J_t$ on the\ntrimer bonds. While it is established that the system hosts a valence bond\nsolid (VBS) phase for $J_d \\ge J_t$, the ground state phase diagram for $J_d <\nJ_t$ has remained unsettled. Our iPEPS simulations uncover a first-order phase\ntransition at $J_d/J_t \\approx 0.18$, significantly lower than previously\nreported estimates. Beyond this transition, we identify a close competition\nbetween two valence bond crystal (VBC) states: a columnar VBC and a $\\sqrt{3}\n\\times \\sqrt{3}$ VBC, with the latter consistently exhibiting lower energy\nacross all finite bond dimensions. The high-order series expansion supports\nthis by finding that the $\\sqrt{3} \\times \\sqrt{3}$ VBC state indeed becomes\nenergetically favorable, but only at sixth order in perturbation theory,\nrevealing the subtle nature of the competition between candidate states.",

    "abstract": "The international standard ISO 2859-2 provides plans for acceptance sampling\nby attributes, that ensure a defined quality level in isolated lots using the\nhypergeometric distribution. In destructive testing, the sample itself is\ndamaged or changed such that the quality of an entire lot is less relevant than\nthe quality of the lot that remains after removing the sample. Examples include\nassessing the germination of seeds and the conformity of in-service utility\nmeters.\n  This research highlights that the hypergeometric distribution cannot describe\nthe frequentist consumer's risk of accepting a remaining lot with\nunsatisfactory quality. Consequently, sampling plans as those provided in ISO\n2859-2 are ill-suited to assess the remaining lot when sampling destructively.\nIn contrast, Bayesian statistics inherently infers the lot's quality after\nsampling. Using a reference prior, we show that sampling plans provided by ISO\n2859-2 result in high specific consumer's risk for small remaining lots.\n  The ISO 2859-2 being ill-suited, we design plans for destructive sampling\nthat limit the (Bayesian) specific consumer's risk. To tabulate these plans in\na similar way to ISO 2859-2, we propose a new representation that fixes the\nremaining lot size $N-n$ rather than the sample size $n$.

In this work, we present\nPaperEval, a novel LLM-based framework for automated paper evaluation that\naddresses these limitations through two key components: 1) a domain-aware paper\nretrieval module that retrieves relevant concurrent work to support\ncontextualized assessments of novelty and contributions, and 2) a latent\nreasoning mechanism that enables deep understanding of complex motivations and\nmethodologies, along with comprehensive comparison against concurrently related\nwork, to support more accurate and reliable evaluation. To guide the reasoning\nprocess, we introduce a progressive ranking optimization strategy that\nencourages the LLM to iteratively refine its predictions with an emphasis on\nrelative comparison. Experiments on two datasets demonstrate that PaperEval\nconsistently outperforms existing methods in both academic impact and paper\nquality evaluation. In addition, we deploy PaperEval in a real-world paper\nrecommendation system for filtering high-quality papers, which has gained\nstrong engagement on social media -- amassing over 8,000 subscribers and\nattracting over 10,000 views for many filtered high-quality papers --\ndemonstrating the practical effectiveness of PaperEval.",

To investigate the\nmechanism behind this positional bias, our extensive experiments reveal a\nconsistent phenomenon we term the attention basin: when presented with a\nsequence of structured items (e.g., retrieved documents or few-shot examples),\nmodels systematically assign higher attention to the items at the beginning and\nend of the sequence, while neglecting those in the middle. Crucially, our\nanalysis further reveals that allocating higher attention to critical\ninformation is key to enhancing model performance. Based on these insights, we\nintroduce Attention-Driven Reranking (AttnRank), a two-stage framework that (i)\nestimates a model's intrinsic positional attention preferences using a small\ncalibration set, and (ii) reorders retrieved documents or few-shot examples to\nalign the most salient content with these high-attention positions. AttnRank is\na model-agnostic, training-free, and plug-and-play method with minimal\ncomputational overhead.

We utilize the currently available photon datasets from the\nXMM-Newton, INTEGRAL, and Fermi-LAT telescopes, along with the positron\ndatasets from the AMS-02 satellite, to establish stringent bounds on the\nrelevant annihilation cross sections or decay widths. In particular, we include\ncontributions to the photon spectrum from final state radiation, radiative\ndecays, and inverse Compton scattering. We find that the INTEGRAL (AMS-02)\nprovides the most stringent bound on the annihilation cross sections and decay\nwidths for DM mass below (above) approximately 20 GeV, which are comparable to\nthose of their lepton flavor conserving counterparts.",

Conducted with 65\npre-service teacher students in Germany, the study compares interaction with\nthe Socratic Tutor to engagement with an uninstructed AI chatbot.

    "abstract": "Although multi-instance learning (MIL) has succeeded in pathological image\nclassification, it faces the challenge of high inference costs due to the need\nto process thousands of patches from each gigapixel whole slide image (WSI). To\naddress this, we propose AHDMIL, an Asymmetric Hierarchical Distillation\nMulti-Instance Learning framework that enables fast and accurate classification\nby eliminating irrelevant patches through a two-step training process. AHDMIL\ncomprises two key components: the Dynamic Multi-Instance Network (DMIN), which\noperates on high-resolution WSIs, and the Dual-Branch Lightweight Instance\nPre-screening Network (DB-LIPN), which analyzes corresponding low-resolution\ncounterparts. In the first step, self-distillation (SD), DMIN is trained for\nWSI classification while generating per-instance attention scores to identify\nirrelevant patches. These scores guide the second step, asymmetric distillation\n(AD), where DB-LIPN learns to predict the relevance of each low-resolution\npatch. The relevant patches predicted by DB-LIPN have spatial correspondence\nwith patches in high-resolution WSIs, which are used for fine-tuning and\nefficient inference of DMIN. In addition, we design the first\nChebyshev-polynomial-based Kolmogorov-Arnold (CKA) classifier in computational\npathology, which improves classification performance through learnable\nactivation layers. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate\nthat AHDMIL consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in both\nclassification performance and inference speed. For example, on the Camelyon16\ndataset, it achieves a relative improvement of 5.3% in accuracy and accelerates\ninference by 1.2.times. Across all datasets, area under the curve (AUC),\naccuracy, f1 score, and brier score show consistent gains, with average\ninference speedups ranging from 1.2 to 2.1 times. The code is available.",

In such cases, Weakly Supervised Learning (WSL), which enables\ntraining with incomplete or imprecise supervision, provides a practical and\neffective solution. However, most existing WSL methods focus on leveraging a\nsingle type of weak supervision. In this paper, we propose a novel WSL\nframework that leverages complementary weak supervision signals from multiple\nrelational perspectives, which can be especially valuable when labeled data is\nlimited. Specifically, we introduce SconfConfDiff Classification, a method that\nintegrates two distinct forms of weaklabels: similarity-confidence and\nconfidence-difference, which are assigned to unlabeled data pairs. To implement\nthis method, we derive two types of unbiased risk estimators for\nclassification: one based on a convex combination of existing estimators, and\nanother newly designed by modeling the interaction between two weak labels. We\nprove that both estimators achieve optimal convergence rates with respect to\nestimation error bounds. Furthermore, we introduce a risk correction approach\nto mitigate overfitting caused by negative empirical risk, and provide\ntheoretical analysis on the robustness of the proposed method against\ninaccurate class prior probability and label noise. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing\nbaselines across a variety of settings.",

    "abstract": "Social recommendation, which seeks to leverage social ties among users to\nalleviate the sparsity issue of user-item interactions, has emerged as a\npopular technique for elevating personalized services in recommender systems.\nDespite being effective, existing social recommendation models are mainly\ndevised for recommending regular items such as blogs, images, and products, and\nlargely fail for community recommendations due to overlooking the unique\ncharacteristics of communities. Distinctly, communities are constituted by\nindividuals, who present high dynamicity and relate to rich structural patterns\nin social networks. To our knowledge, limited research has been devoted to\ncomprehensively exploiting this information for recommending communities.\n  To bridge this gap, this paper presents CASO, a novel and effective model\nspecially designed for social community recommendation. Under the hood, CASO\nharnesses three carefully-crafted encoders for user embedding, wherein two of\nthem extract community-related global and local structures from the social\nnetwork via social modularity maximization and social closeness aggregation,\nwhile the third one captures user preferences using collaborative filtering\nwith observed user-community affiliations. To further eliminate feature\nredundancy therein, we introduce a mutual exclusion between social and\ncollaborative signals. Finally, CASO includes a community detection loss in the\nmodel optimization, thereby producing community-aware embeddings for\ncommunities. Our extensive experiments evaluating CASO against nine strong\nbaselines on six real-world social networks demonstrate its consistent and\nremarkable superiority over the state of the art in terms of community\nrecommendation performance.",

    "abstract": "The dispersal of seeds by wind is one of the most evolved mechanisms plants\nuse to invade new territories. Linden trees grow diaspores with a curved bract\nacting as a wing, where the seed pods are connected underneath by a stalk.\nBesides the seed-carrying capacity, the other functions of the stalk remain\nunknown. We demonstrate that the stalk of linden (genus Tilia L.) diaspores\nplays an essential role in their flight. The stalk length to wing span ratio is\nfound to be the key parameter for facilitating steady autorotating flight in\nTilia x europaea diaspores, effectively doubling their flight time compared to\nan unsteady tumbling motion. Flight experiments with biological and synthetic\ndiaspores reveal a critical stalk length needed to induce autorotation, which\ncorrelates with analysis of collected biological samples and points to a\npossible evolutionarily selected trait. Flow measurements show that the\nvortical structures around the curved wing cause the elevated lift force during\nthe autorotating flight.",

While static, uniform quantization applies a fixed bit-width\nto all inputs, it fails to adapt to their varying complexity. Dynamic,\ninstance-based mixed-precision quantization promises a superior\naccuracy-efficiency trade-off by allocating higher precision only when needed.\nHowever, a critical bottleneck remains: existing methods require a costly\ndequantize-to-float and requantize-to-integer cycle to change precision,\nbreaking the integer-only hardware paradigm and compromising performance gains.\nThis paper introduces Dynamic Quantization Training (DQT), a novel framework\nthat removes this bottleneck. At the core of DQT is a nested integer\nrepresentation where lower-precision values are bit-wise embedded within\nhigher-precision ones. This design, coupled with custom integer-only\narithmetic, allows for on-the-fly bit-width switching through a near-zero-cost\nbit-shift operation. This makes DQT the first quantization framework to enable\nboth dequantization-free static mixed-precision of the backbone network, and\ntruly efficient dynamic, instance-based quantization through a lightweight\ncontroller that decides at runtime how to quantize each layer.

Forward-compatible learning, which\nprospectively prepares for future tasks during base task training, has emerged\nas a promising solution for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL).\nHowever, existing methods still struggle to balance base-class discriminability\nand new-class generalization. Moreover, limited access to original data during\nincremental tasks often results in ambiguous inter-class decision boundaries.\nTo address these challenges, we propose SMP (Sculpting Margin Penalty), a novel\nFSCIL method that strategically integrates margin penalties at different stages\nwithin the parameter-efficient fine-tuning paradigm. Specifically, we introduce\nthe Margin-aware Intra-task Adapter Merging (MIAM) mechanism for base task\nlearning. MIAM trains two sets of low-rank adapters with distinct\nclassification losses: one with a margin penalty to enhance base-class\ndiscriminability, and the other without margin constraints to promote\ngeneralization to future new classes. These adapters are then adaptively merged\nto improve forward compatibility. For incremental tasks, we propose a Margin\nPenalty-based Classifier Calibration (MPCC) strategy to refine decision\nboundaries by fine-tuning classifiers on all seen classes' embeddings with a\nmargin penalty. Extensive experiments on CIFAR100, ImageNet-R, and CUB200\ndemonstrate that SMP achieves state-of-the-art performance in FSCIL while\nmaintaining a better balance between base and new classes.",

    "abstract": "User feedback is critical for refining recommendation systems, yet explicit\nfeedback (e.g., likes or dislikes) remains scarce in practice. As a more\nfeasible alternative, inferring user preferences from massive implicit feedback\nhas shown great potential (e.g., a user quickly skipping a recommended video\nusually indicates disinterest). Unfortunately, implicit feedback is often\nnoisy: a user might skip a video due to accidental clicks or other reasons,\nrather than disliking it. Such noise can easily misjudge user interests,\nthereby undermining recommendation performance. To address this issue, we\npropose a novel Group-aware User Behavior Simulation (G-UBS) paradigm, which\nleverages contextual guidance from relevant user groups, enabling robust and\nin-depth interpretation of implicit feedback for individual users.\nSpecifically, G-UBS operates via two key agents. First, the User Group Manager\n(UGM) effectively clusters users to generate group profiles utilizing a\n``summarize-cluster-reflect\" workflow based on LLMs. Second, the User Feedback\nModeler (UFM) employs an innovative group-aware reinforcement learning\napproach, where each user is guided by the associated group profiles during the\nreinforcement learning process, allowing UFM to robustly and deeply examine the\nreasons behind implicit feedback. To assess our G-UBS paradigm, we have\nconstructed a Video Recommendation benchmark with Implicit Feedback (IF-VR). To\nthe best of our knowledge, this is the first multi-modal benchmark for implicit\nfeedback evaluation in video recommendation, encompassing 15k users, 25k\nvideos, and 933k interaction records with implicit feedback. Extensive\nexperiments on IF-VR demonstrate that G-UBS significantly outperforms\nmainstream LLMs and MLLMs, with a 4.0% higher proportion of videos achieving a\nplay rate > 30% and 14.9% higher reasoning accuracy on IF-VR.",

This challenge is\nparticularly acute in computational social systems and economic analysis, where\nlabeled data is often scarce, expensive, and subject to expert noise. To\naddress this gap, we propose a novel framework for cold-start active preference\nlearning. Our method initiates the learning process through a self-supervised\npre-training phase, utilizing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to derive\ninitial pseudo-labels from the data's inherent structure, thereby creating a\ncold-start model without any initial oracle interaction. Subsequently, the\nmodel is refined through an active learning loop that strategically queries a\nsimulated noisy oracle for labels. We conduct extensive experiments on diverse\ndatasets from different domains, including financial credibility, career\nsuccess rate, and socio-economic status. The results demonstrate that our\ncold-start approach outperforms standard active learning strategies that begin\nfrom a blank slate, achieving higher accuracy with substantially fewer labeled\npairs. Our framework offers a practical and effective solution to mitigate the\ncold-start problem, enhancing the sample efficiency and applicability of\npreference learning in data-constrained environments.

While the delayed Vicsek model\nretains the same three phases as the standard version -- an ordered state, a\nliquid-gas coexistence state, and a disordered state -- the presence of delay\nqualitatively alters the system's dynamics. At the relatively high velocity\nconsidered in this study, the critical noise for the transition between the\nordered and coexistence states exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on delay,\nwhereas the critical noise required for the transition to the disordered state\nincreases with delay. Consequently, the width of the noise interval in which\nphase separation occurs broadens with increasing delay. Short delays stabilize\nthe ordered phase, while long delays destabilize it in favor of the coexistence\nphase, which is consistently stabilized compared to the disordered state.\nFurthermore, the number of bands observed in the coexistence state at a given\nnoise increases, and the time required for their formation decreases with\ndelay. This acceleration is attributed to the emergence of swirling structures\nwhose typical radius grows with increasing delay.

Current approaches to building autonomous web agents either focus on\noffline imitation learning or online exploration, but rarely integrate both\nparadigms effectively. Inspired by the dual-process theory of human cognition,\nwe derive a principled decomposition into fast System 1 and slow System 2\ncognitive processes. This decomposition provides a unifying perspective on\nexisting web agent methodologies, bridging the gap between offline learning of\nintuitive reactive behaviors and online acquisition of deliberative planning\ncapabilities. We implement this framework in CogniWeb, a modular agent\narchitecture that adaptively toggles between fast intuitive processing and\ndeliberate reasoning based on task complexity.

This challenge is especially acute in healthcare, where\ndecisions-spanning clinical, operational, and patient-facing contexts-demand\nnot only accurate outputs but also interpretable, traceable rationales to\nensure safety, accountability, and regulatory compliance. Conventional\nfederated tuning approaches on LLM fail to address this need: they optimize\nprimarily for answer correctness while neglecting rationale quality, leaving\nCoT capabilities dependent on models' innate pre-training abilities. Moreover,\nexisting methods for improving rationales typically rely on privacy-violating\nknowledge distillation from centralized models. Additionally, the communication\noverhead in traditional federated fine-tuning on LLMs remains substantial. We\naddresses this gap by proposing FedCoT, a novel framework specifically designed\nto enhance reasoning in federated settings.

The MANM employs adaptive\ngating-based multimodal context-aware attention, enabling the model to focus on\nrelevant visual and textual information and generating contextually relevant\nfeatures. The GFRM module utilizes graphs to refine features within individual\nmodalities, while the CFLM focuses on learning text and image-specific features\nsuch as toxicity features and caption features. Additionally, we curate a set\nof misogynous lexicons to compute the misogyny-specific lexicon score from the\ntext. We apply test-time augmentation in feature space to better generalize the\npredictions on diverse inputs. The performance of the proposed approach has\nbeen evaluated on two multimodal datasets, MAMI and MMHS150K, with 11,000 and\n13,494 samples, respectively. The proposed method demonstrates an average\nimprovement of 10.17% and 8.88% in macro-F1 over existing methods on the MAMI\nand MMHS150K datasets, respectively.",

    "abstract": "We present results from XRISM/Resolve observations of the core of the galaxy\ncluster Abell 2319, focusing on its kinematic properties. The intracluster\nmedium (ICM) exhibits temperatures of approximately 8 keV across the core, with\na prominent cold front and a high-temperature region ($\\sim$11 keV) in the\nnorthwest. The average gas velocity in the 3 arcmin $\\times$ 4 arcmin region\naround the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) covered by two Resolve pointings is\nconsistent with that of the BCG to within 40 km s$^{-1}$ and we found modest\naverage velocity dispersion of 230-250 km s$^{-1}$. On the other hand,\nspatially-resolved spectroscopy reveals interesting variations. A blueshift of\nup to $\\sim$230 km s$^{-1}$ is observed around the east edge of the cold front,\nwhere the gas with the lowest specific entropy is found. The region further\nsouth inside the cold front shows only a small velocity difference from the\nBCG; however, its velocity dispersion is enhanced to 400 km s$^{-1}$, implying\nthe development of turbulence. These characteristics indicate that we are\nobserving sloshing motion with some inclination angle following BCG and that\ngas phases with different specific entropy participate in sloshing with their\nown velocities, as expected from simulations. No significant evidence for a\nhigh-redshift ICM component associated with the subcluster Abell 2319B was\nfound in the region covered by the current Resolve pointings. These results\nhighlight the importance of sloshing and turbulence in shaping the internal\nstructure of Abell 2319. Further deep observations are necessary to better\nunderstand the mixing and turbulent processes within the cluster.",

In this work, we introduce an alternative definition of\nthe geometric Jensen--Shannon divergence tailored to positive densities which\ndoes not normalize geometric mixtures. This novel divergence is termed the\nextended G-JSD as it applies to the more general case of positive measures. We\nreport explicitly the gap between the extended G-JSD and the G-JSD when\nconsidering probability densities, and show how to express the G-JSD and\nextended G-JSD using the Jeffreys divergence and the Bhattacharyya distance or\nBhattacharyya coefficient. The extended G-JSD is proven to be a $f$-divergence\nwhich is a separable divergence satisfying information monotonicity and\ninvariance in information geometry. We derive corresponding closed-form formula\nfor the two types of G-JSDs when considering the case of multivariate Gaussian\ndistributions often met in applications. We consider Monte Carlo stochastic\nestimations and approximations of the two types of G-JSD using the projective\n$\\gamma$-divergences. Although the square root of the JSD yields a metric\ndistance, we show that this is not anymore the case for the two types of G-JSD.\nFinally, we explain how these two types of geometric JSDs can be interpreted as\nregularizations of the ordinary JSD.",

However, existing CSS\nmethods typically employ single-stage encoder-decoder architectures where\nsegmentation masks and class labels are tightly coupled, leading to\ninterference between old and new class learning and suboptimal\nretention-plasticity balance. We introduce DecoupleCSS, a novel two-stage\nframework for CSS.

The first stage leverages\npre-trained text and image encoders, adapted using LoRA, to encode\nclass-specific information and generate location-aware prompts. In the second\nstage, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) is employed to produce precise\nsegmentation masks, ensuring that segmentation knowledge is shared across both\nnew and previous classes. This approach improves the balance between retention\nand adaptability in CSS, achieving state-of-the-art performance across a\nvariety of challenging tasks.

    "abstract": "Computer science education has evolved extensively; however, systemic\nbarriers still prevent students with visual impairments from fully\nparticipating. While existing research has developed specialized programming\ntools and assistive technologies, these solutions remain fragmented and often\nrequire complex technical infrastructure, which limits their classroom\nimplementation. Current approaches treat accessibility as individual\naccommodations rather than integral curriculum design, creating gaps in\nholistic educational support. This paper presents a comprehensive framework for\nredesigning introductory computer science curricula to provide equitable\nlearning experiences for students with visual impairments without requiring\nspecialized technical infrastructure. The framework outlines five key\ncomponents that together contribute a systematic approach to curriculum\naccessibility: accessible learning resources with pre-distributed materials and\ntactile diagrams, in-class learning kits with hands-on demonstrations,\nstructured support systems with dedicated teaching assistance, an online tool\nrepository, and psychosocial support for classroom participation. Unlike\nexisting tool-focused solutions, this framework addresses both technical and\npedagogical dimensions of inclusive education while emphasizing practical\nimplementation in standard university settings. The design is grounded in\nuniversal design principles and validated through expert consultation with\naccessibility specialists and disability services professionals, establishing\nfoundations for future empirical evaluation of learning outcomes and student\nengagement while serving as a template for broader institutional adoption.",

    "abstract": "The semidirect discrete logarithm problem (SDLP) in finite groups was\nproposed as a foundation for post-quantum cryptographic protocols, based on the\nbelief that its non-abelian structure would resist quantum attacks. However,\nrecent results have shown that SDLP in finite groups admits efficient quantum\nalgorithms, undermining its quantum resistance. This raises a fundamental\nquestion: does the SDLP offer any computational advantages over the standard\ndiscrete logarithm problem (DLP) against classical adversaries? In this work,\nwe investigate the classical hardness of SDLP across different finite group\nplatforms. We establish that the group-case SDLP can be reformulated as a\ngeneralized discrete logarithm problem, enabling adaptation of classical\nalgorithms to study its complexity. We present a concrete adaptation of the\nBaby-Step Giant-Step algorithm for SDLP, achieving time and space complexity\n$O(\\sqrt{r})$ where $r$ is the period of the underlying cycle structure.\nThrough theoretical analysis and experimental validation in SageMath, we\ndemonstrate that the classical hardness of SDLP is highly platform-dependent\nand does not uniformly exceed that of standard DLP. In finite fields\n$\\mathbb{F}_p^*$, both problems exhibit comparable complexity. Surprisingly, in\nelliptic curves $E(\\mathbb{F}_p)$, the SDLP becomes trivial due to the bounded\nautomorphism group, while in elementary abelian groups $\\mathbb{F}_p^n$, the\nSDLP can be harder than DLP, with complexity varying based on the eigenvalue\nstructure of the automorphism. Our findings reveal that the non-abelian\nstructure of semidirect products does not inherently guarantee increased\nclassical hardness, suggesting that the search for classically hard problems\nfor cryptographic applications requires more careful consideration of the\nunderlying algebraic structures.",

For one of these types\nthe proof is pretty straightforward and hence the result extends to all point\nall loop on-shell amplitudes. These are called the \"trivial\" cases while for\nthe other type we find certain cases called the \"non trivial\" cases for which\nthe proof is much more subtle. We present an explicit example of such a \"non\ntrivial\" case at 3-loop order and argue how the proof of crossing symmetry\nholds true when all subtleties are taken into consideration. Although a general\nproof for these \"nontrivial cases\" at higher loop is beyond the scope of this\npaper, we do conjecture that the proof of crossing shall hold in a similar\nfashion, for higher loops as well since the subtlety of the resolution in\n3-loop case lies with the type of Landau singularity we need to consider and\nnot the number of internal propagators or loop momenta.",

    "abstract": "The theory of evolving natural configurations is an effective technique to\nmodel dissipative processes. In this paper, we use this theory to revisit\nnonlinear constitutive models of viscoelastic solids. Particularly, a Maxwell\nand a Kelvin-Voigt model and their associated standard solids, viz., a Zener\nand a Poynting-Thompson solids respectively, have been modeled within a\nLagrangian framework. We show that while a strain-space formulation of the\nevolving natural configurations is useful in modeling Maxwell-type materials, a\nstress-space formulation that incorporates a rate of dissipation function in\nterms of the relevant configurational forces is required for modeling the\nKelvin-Voigt type materials. Furthermore, we also show that the basic Maxwell\nand Kelvin-Voigt models can be obtained as limiting cases from the derived\nstandard solid models. Integration algorithms for the proposed models have been\ndeveloped and numerical solutions for a relevant boundary value problem are\nobtained. The response of the developed models have been compared and\nbenchmarked with experimental data. Specifically, the response of the novel\nPoynting-Thompson model is studied in details. This model shows a very good\nmatch with the existing experimental data obtained from a uniaxial stretching\nof polymers over a large extent of strain. The relaxation behavior and rate\neffects for the developed models have been studied.",

To ensure robust matching, we introduce a new dual-input decision\ngating network that dynamically adjusts the contributions of each expert based\non their relevance to the input scenarios.

In modern software systems, dependencies often span multiple\ncomponents across teams, creating challenges for development and deployment.\nThey serve various purposes, from enabling new features to managing\nconfigurations, and can even involve traditionally independent changes like\ndocumentation updates. To address these challenges, we conducted a preliminary\nstudy on dependency management in OpenStack, a large-scale software system. Our\nstudy revealed that a substantial portion of software changes in OpenStack over\nthe past 10 years are interdependent. Surprisingly, 51.08% of these\ndependencies are identified during the code review phase-after a median delay\nof 5.06 hours-rather than at the time of change creation. Developers often\nspend a median of 57.12 hours identifying dependencies, searching among a\nmedian of 463 other changes. To help developers proactively identify\ndependencies, we propose a semi-automated approach that leverages two ML\nmodels.

However, its microscopic nature, energetic\nlandscape, and electronic properties remain largely unexplored from a\nfirst-principles perspective. Here, using density function theory on PbTiO$_3$\nunder biaxial tensile strain, we identify a novel form of polar order: a\nchiral, non-collinear ferroelectric double helix. We find that the Pb- and\nTi-cation sublattices form two distinct, intertwined helices, reminiscent of\nDNA. This topology is stabilized by a collective helical twisting of the oxygen\noctahedral framework, which gives rise to an electric\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya-like interaction. The resulting structure, which can be\ncanceptualized as a \"self-Moir\\'e\" crystal, exhibits two coupled\nfunctionalities. First, it possesses a rotational pseudo-zero-energy mode that\nunderpins a giant piezoelectric response ($e_{33}\\approx$16 C/m$^2$). Second,\nthe long-period potential reconstructs the electronic band structure, leading\nto a multi-valley electronic topology at the valence band edge. Our work\nestablishes a physical route to designing complex chiral order that supports\nboth giant electromechanical coupling and multi-valley electronics.",

PPO and\nGRPO employ an on-policy approach, training a PER-based reward model to\niteratively optimize sequences via reward maximization and KL-regularization,\nyielding PER reductions of 4.9% and 4.7%, respectively.

This\ndisparity arises largely due to the distinct structural complexities of ligands\nand proteins. To address this issue, we propose a novel game-theoretic\nframework that models the protein-ligand interaction as a two-player game\ncalled the Docking Game, with the ligand docking module acting as the ligand\nplayer and the protein pocket docking module as the protein player. To solve\nthis game, we develop a novel Loop Self-Play (LoopPlay) algorithm, which\nalternately trains these players through a two-level loop. In the outer loop,\nthe players exchange predicted poses, allowing each to incorporate the other's\nstructural predictions, which fosters mutual adaptation over multiple\niterations. In the inner loop, each player dynamically refines its predictions\nby incorporating its own predicted ligand or pocket poses back into its model.\nWe theoretically show the convergence of LoopPlay, ensuring stable\noptimization. Extensive experiments conducted on public benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate that LoopPlay achieves approximately a 10\\% improvement in\npredicting accurate binding modes compared to previous state-of-the-art\nmethods.

Methods: We present a\nmulti-stage large language model framework to enhance SDoH factor extraction\nfrom unstructured text.

This\nwould allow for much smaller storage requirements and self-sufficiency of\ndeployed systems that cope with natural distribution shifts, similarly to\nbiological learning. We focus on video CL employing a rehearsal-based approach,\nwhich reinforces past samples from a memory buffer. We posit that part of the\nreason why practical video CL is challenging is the high memory requirements of\nvideo, further exacerbated by long-videos and continual streams, which are at\nodds with the common rehearsal-buffer size constraints. To address this, we\npropose to use compressed vision, i.e. store video codes (embeddings) instead\nof raw inputs, and train a video classifier by IID sampling from this rolling\nbuffer. Training a video compressor online (so not depending on any pre-trained\nnetworks) means that it is also subject to catastrophic forgetting. We propose\na scheme to deal with this forgetting by refreshing video codes, which requires\ncareful decompression with a previous version of the network and recompression\nwith a new one.

To mitigate this issue, we propose a Multi-relational\nMultimodal Causal Intervention (MMCI) model, which leverages the backdoor\nadjustment from causal theory to address the confounding effects of such\nshortcuts. Specifically, we first model the multimodal inputs as a\nmulti-relational graph to explicitly capture intra- and inter-modal\ndependencies. Then, we apply an attention mechanism to separately estimate and\ndisentangle the causal features and shortcut features corresponding to these\nintra- and inter-modal relations. Finally, by applying the backdoor adjustment,\nwe stratify the shortcut features and dynamically combine them with the causal\nfeatures to encourage MMCI to produce stable predictions under distribution\nshifts.

    "abstract": "Maze navigation is a fundamental challenge in robotics, requiring agents to\ntraverse complex environments efficiently. While the Deep Deterministic Policy\nGradient (DDPG) algorithm excels in control tasks, its performance in maze\nnavigation suffers from sparse rewards, inefficient exploration, and\nlong-horizon planning difficulties, often leading to low success rates and\naverage rewards, sometimes even failing to achieve effective navigation. To\naddress these limitations, this paper proposes an efficient Hierarchical DDPG\n(HDDPG) algorithm, which includes high-level and low-level policies. The\nhigh-level policy employs an advanced DDPG framework to generate intermediate\nsubgoals from a long-term perspective and on a higher temporal scale. The\nlow-level policy, also powered by the improved DDPG algorithm, generates\nprimitive actions by observing current states and following the subgoal\nassigned by the high-level policy. The proposed method enhances stability with\noff-policy correction, refining subgoal assignments by relabeling historical\nexperiences. Additionally, adaptive parameter space noise is utilized to\nimprove exploration, and a reshaped intrinsic-extrinsic reward function is\nemployed to boost learning efficiency. Further optimizations, including\ngradient clipping and Xavier initialization, are employed to improve\nrobustness. The proposed algorithm is rigorously evaluated through numerical\nsimulation experiments executed using the Robot Operating System (ROS) and\nGazebo. Regarding the three distinct final targets in autonomous maze\nnavigation tasks, HDDPG significantly overcomes the limitations of standard\nDDPG and its variants, improving the success rate by at least 56.59% and\nboosting the average reward by a minimum of 519.03 compared to baseline\nalgorithms.",

    "abstract": "Recent neurophysiological studies have revealed that the early visual cortex\ncan rapidly learn global image context, as evidenced by a sparsification of\npopulation responses and a reduction in mean activity when exposed to familiar\nversus novel image contexts. This phenomenon has been attributed primarily to\nlocal recurrent interactions, rather than changes in feedforward or feedback\npathways, supported by both empirical findings and circuit-level modeling.\nRecurrent neural circuits capable of simulating these effects have been shown\nto reshape the geometry of neural manifolds, enhancing robustness and\ninvariance to irrelevant variations. In this study, we employ a Vision\nTransformer (ViT)-based autoencoder to investigate, from a functional\nperspective, how familiarity training can induce sensitivity to global context\nin the early layers of a deep neural network. We hypothesize that rapid\nlearning operates via fast weights, which encode transient or short-term memory\ntraces, and we explore the use of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to implement such\nfast weights within each Transformer layer. Our results show that (1) The\nproposed ViT-based autoencoder's self-attention circuit performs a manifold\ntransform similar to a neural circuit model of the familiarity effect. (2)\nFamiliarity training aligns latent representations in early layers with those\nin the top layer that contains global context information. (3) Familiarity\ntraining broadens the self-attention scope within the remembered image context.\n(4) These effects are significantly amplified by LoRA-based fast weights.\nTogether, these findings suggest that familiarity training introduces global\nsensitivity to earlier layers in a hierarchical network, and that a hybrid\nfast-and-slow weight architecture may provide a viable computational model for\nstudying rapid global context learning in the brain.",

Recently, pre-trained\nvision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated promising zero-shot performance\nby leveraging semantic information to facilitate target tasks. By aligning\nvision and text embeddings, VLMs have shown notable success in bridging domain\ngaps. However, inherent differences naturally exist between modalities, which\nis known as modality gap. Our findings reveal that direct UDA with the presence\nof modality gap only transfers modality-invariant knowledge, leading to\nsuboptimal target performance. To address this limitation, we propose a unified\nmodality separation framework that accommodates both modality-specific and\nmodality-invariant components. During training, different modality components\nare disentangled from VLM features then handled separately in a unified manner.\nAt test time, modality-adaptive ensemble weights are automatically determined\nto maximize the synergy of different components. To evaluate instance-level\nmodality characteristics, we design a modality discrepancy metric to categorize\nsamples into modality-invariant, modality-specific, and uncertain ones. The\nmodality-invariant samples are exploited to facilitate cross-modal alignment,\nwhile uncertain ones are annotated to enhance model capabilities.

Using previous estimates of the four-quark operators\nfor the chiral symmetric and breaking parts, we obtain a mass decrease that is\nsmaller in magnitude but qualitatively consistent with the attraction obtained\nin the lattice QCD calculation. By expressing the interaction in terms of\nfour-quark operators, we can analyze the effects of chiral symmetry restoration\nin dense matter on the masses of the $J/\\psi$ and other mesons composed of\nheavy quarks.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion-based image compression has demonstrated impressive perceptual\nperformance. However, it suffers from two critical drawbacks: (1) excessive\ndecoding latency due to multi-step sampling, and (2) poor fidelity resulting\nfrom over-reliance on generative priors. To address these issues, we propose\nSODEC, a novel single-step diffusion image compression model. We argue that in\nimage compression, a sufficiently informative latent renders multi-step\nrefinement unnecessary. Based on this insight, we leverage a pre-trained\nVAE-based model to produce latents with rich information, and replace the\niterative denoising process with a single-step decoding. Meanwhile, to improve\nfidelity, we introduce the fidelity guidance module, encouraging output that is\nfaithful to the original image. Furthermore, we design the rate annealing\ntraining strategy to enable effective training under extremely low bitrates.\nExtensive experiments show that SODEC significantly outperforms existing\nmethods, achieving superior rate-distortion-perception performance. Moreover,\ncompared to previous diffusion-based compression models, SODEC improves\ndecoding speed by more than 20$\\times$. Code is released at:\nhttps://github.com/zhengchen1999/SODEC.",

    "abstract": "This dissertation presents two signal processing methods using specially\ndesigned localized kernels for parameter recovery under noisy condition. The\nfirst method addresses the estimation of frequencies and amplitudes in\nmultidimensional exponential models. It utilizes localized trigonometric\npolynomial kernels to detect the multivariate frequencies, followed by a more\ndetailed parameter estimation. We compare our method with MUSIC and ESPRIT,\nwhich are classical subspace-based algorithms widely used for estimating the\nparameters of exponential signals. In the univariate case, the method\noutperforms MUSIC and ESPRIT under low signal-to-noise ratios. For the\nmultivariate case, we develop a coordinate-wise projection and registration\napproach that achieves high recovery accuracy using significantly fewer samples\nthan other methods.\n  The second method focuses on separating linear chirp components from\ntime-localized signal segments. A variant of the Signal Separation Operator\n(SSO) is constructed using a localized kernel. Instantaneous frequency\nestimates are obtained via FFT-based filtering, then clustered and fitted with\npiecewise linear regression. The method operates without prior knowledge of the\nnumber of components and is shown to recover intersecting and discontinuous\nchirps at SNR levels as low as -30 dB.\n  Both methods share an idea based on localized kernels and efficient FFT-based\nimplementation, and neither requires subspace decomposition or sparsity\nregularization. Experimental results confirm the robustness and tractability of\nthe proposed approaches across a range of simulated data conditions. Potential\nextensions include application to nonlinear chirps, adaptive kernel design, and\nsignal classification using extracted features.",

To address this, we introduce statistically validated correlation\nnetworks that retain only statistically significant correlations via a rigorous\nt-test of Pearson coefficients.

A key obstacle lies in the complexity\nand variability of natural language: essentially equivalent problems often\nappear in diverse surface forms, often obscured by redundant or distracting\ndetails. This imposes a dual burden on SLMs: they must first extract the core\nproblem from complex linguistic input, and then perform reasoning based on that\nunderstanding. The resulting vast and noisy problem space hinders optimization,\nparticularly for models with limited capacity. To address this, we propose a\nnew framework that decouples understanding from reasoning by mapping natural\nlanguage problems into a canonical problem space-a semantically simplified yet\nexpressive domain. This enables SLMs to focus on reasoning over standardized\ninputs, free from linguistic variability. Within this framework, we introduce\nDURIT (Decoupled Understanding from Reasoning via Iterative Training), a\nthree-step algorithm that iteratively: (1) mapping natural language problems\nvia reinforcement learning, (2) aligns reasoning trajectories through\nself-distillation, and (3) trains reasoning policies in the problem space. The\nmapper and reasoner are co-trained in an alternating loop throughout this\nprocess. Experiments show that DURIT substantially improves SLMs' performance\non both in-domain and out-of-domain mathematical and logical reasoning tasks.\nBeyond improving reasoning capabilities, DURIT also improves the robustness of\nreasoning, validating decoupling understanding from reasoning as an effective\nstrategy for strengthening SLMs.",

In this work, we propose Surformer v1, a transformer-based\narchitecture designed for surface classification using structured tactile\nfeatures and PCA-reduced visual embeddings extracted via ResNet-50. The model\nintegrates modality-specific encoders with cross-modal attention layers,\nenabling rich interactions between vision and touch. Currently,\nstate-of-the-art deep learning models for vision tasks have achieved remarkable\nperformance. With this in mind, our first set of experiments focused\nexclusively on tactile-only surface classification. Using feature engineering,\nwe trained and evaluated multiple machine learning models, assessing their\naccuracy and inference time. We then implemented an encoder-only Transformer\nmodel tailored for tactile features. This model not only achieved the highest\naccuracy but also demonstrated significantly faster inference time compared to\nother evaluated models, highlighting its potential for real-time applications.\nTo extend this investigation, we introduced a multimodal fusion setup by\ncombining vision and tactile inputs. We trained both Surformer v1 (using\nstructured features) and Multimodal CNN (using raw images) to examine the\nimpact of feature-based versus image-based multimodal learning on\nclassification accuracy and computational efficiency. The results showed that\nSurformer v1 achieved 99.4% accuracy with an inference time of 0.77 ms, while\nthe Multimodal CNN achieved slightly higher accuracy but required significantly\nmore inference time. These findings suggest Surformer v1 offers a compelling\nbalance between accuracy, efficiency, and computational cost for surface\nmaterial recognition.",

Through a detailed analysis, we demonstrate that no\nDoplicher-Haag-Roberts (DHR) superselection sectors carry nonzero color charge,\nthereby providing a precise and mathematically robust characterization of\nconfinement in these theories. To fully capture the global gauge structure, we\nextend the observable net by incorporating nonlocal Wilson line operators,\nwhich encode string-like color flux configurations essential to the theory's\ntopological properties. We further establish a structural violation of Haag\nduality, showing that certain operators, such as Wilson lines, reside in the\ncommutant of a local algebra but cannot be localized within the algebra of the\ncausal complement, a phenomenon driven by nontrivial topological degrees of\nfreedom. By introducing regularization techniques for operator products and\nproviding detailed derivations, we ensure mathematical precision.

    "abstract": "Ensemble learning boosts performance by aggregating predictions from multiple\nbase learners. A core challenge is balancing individual learner accuracy with\ndiversity. Traditional methods like Bagging and Boosting promote diversity\nthrough randomness but lack precise control over the accuracy-diversity\ntrade-off. Negative Correlation Learning (NCL) introduces a penalty to manage\nthis trade-off but suffers from loose theoretical bounds and limited adjustment\nrange. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework called\nSelf-Error Adjustment (SEA), which decomposes ensemble errors into two distinct\ncomponents: individual performance terms, representing the self-error of each\nbase learner, and diversity terms, reflecting interactions among learners. This\ndecomposition allows us to introduce an adjustable parameter into the loss\nfunction, offering precise control over the contribution of each component,\nthus enabling finer regulation of ensemble performance. Compared to NCL and its\nvariants, SEA provides a broader range of effective adjustments and more\nconsistent changes in diversity. Furthermore, we establish tighter theoretical\nbounds for adjustable ensemble methods and validate them through empirical\nexperiments. Experimental results on several public regression and\nclassification datasets demonstrate that SEA consistently outperforms baseline\nmethods across all tasks. Ablation studies confirm that SEA offers more\nflexible adjustment capabilities and superior performance in fine-tuning\nstrategies.",

    "abstract": "Compared to the more widely studied Pauli errors, coherent errors present\nseveral new challenges in quantum computing and quantum error correction (QEC).\nFor example, coherent errors may interfere constructively over a long circuit\nand significantly increase the overall failure rate compared to Pauli noise.\nAdditionally, there is so far no analytical proof for a topological code\nthreshold under coherent errors. Moreover, it is hard to even numerically\nestimate the performance of QEC under coherent errors as their effect in a\nClifford circuit cannot be efficiently classically simulated. In this work, we\ndemonstrate that teleportation effectively tailors coherent errors into Pauli\nerrors, for which analytical and numerical results are abundant. We first show\nthat repeated teleportation of a single qubit decoheres errors, and the average\ninfidelity grows at worst linearly with the number of teleportations, similar\nto Pauli errors. We then analyze a physically motivated pure $Z$-coherent error\nmodel for teleported CSS codes in which over-rotation errors accompany every\ngate, and find that such an error model is equivalent to a Pauli error model.\nOur result implies that the performance of a CSS code implemented via\nteleportation-based error correction or measurement-based error correction with\nsuch coherent noise can be efficiently simulated on a classical computer and\nhas an analytically provable threshold. The intrinsic noise-tailoring property\nof teleportation may ultimately remove the need for randomized compiling in\nteleportation-based quantum computing schemes.",

Based on this strategy, we present Regularized\nEntropy INformation Adaptation (REINA), a novel loss to train an adaptive\npolicy using an existing non-streaming translation model. We derive REINA from\ninformation theory principles and show that REINA helps push the reported\nPareto frontier of the latency/quality tradeoff over prior works.

    "abstract": "Evaluating visual activity recognition systems is challenging due to inherent\nambiguities in verb semantics and image interpretation. When describing actions\nin images, synonymous verbs can refer to the same event (e.g., brushing vs.\ngrooming), while different perspectives can lead to equally valid but distinct\nverb choices (e.g., piloting vs. operating). Standard exact-match evaluation,\nwhich relies on a single gold answer, fails to capture these ambiguities,\nresulting in an incomplete assessment of model performance. To address this, we\npropose a vision-language clustering framework that constructs verb sense\nclusters, providing a more robust evaluation. Our analysis of the imSitu\ndataset shows that each image maps to an average of 2.8 sense clusters, with\neach cluster representing a distinct perspective of the image. We evaluate\nmultiple activity recognition models and compare our cluster-based evaluation\nwith standard evaluation methods. Additionally, our human alignment analysis\nsuggests that the cluster-based evaluation better aligns with human judgements,\noffering a more nuanced assessment of model performance.",

In this work, we propose a novel framework\nthat aligns brain connectomes with clinical reports in a shared cross-modal\nlatent space at both the subject and connectome levels, thereby enhancing\nrepresentation learning.

We\napplied our method to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) using the ADNI dataset.\nOur approach not only achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance but also\nidentifies clinically meaningful connectome-text pairs, offering new insights\ninto the early mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease and supporting the development\nof clinically useful multimodal biomarkers.",

Weakly\nSupervised DSGG (WS-DSGG) reduces annotation workload by using an unlocalized\nscene graph from a single frame per video for training. Existing WS-DSGG\nmethods depend on an off-the-shelf external object detector to generate pseudo\nlabels for subsequent DSGG training. However, detectors trained on static,\nobject-centric images struggle in dynamic, relation-aware scenarios required\nfor DSGG, leading to inaccurate localization and low-confidence proposals. To\naddress the challenges posed by external object detectors in WS-DSGG, we\npropose a Temporal-enhanced Relation-aware Knowledge Transferring (TRKT)\nmethod, which leverages knowledge to enhance detection in relation-aware\ndynamic scenarios. TRKT is built on two key components:(1)Relation-aware\nknowledge mining: we first employ object and relation class decoders that\ngenerate category-specific attention maps to highlight both object regions and\ninteractive areas. Then we propose an Inter-frame Attention Augmentation\nstrategy that exploits optical flow for neighboring frames to enhance the\nattention maps, making them motion-aware and robust to motion blur. This step\nyields relation- and motion-aware knowledge mining for WS-DSGG.
