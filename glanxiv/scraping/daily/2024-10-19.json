    "abstract": "Image memorability refers to the phenomenon where certain images are more\nlikely to be remembered than others. It is a quantifiable and intrinsic image\nattribute, defined as the likelihood of an image being remembered upon a single\nexposure. Despite advances in understanding human visual perception and memory,\nit is unclear what features contribute to an image's memorability. To address\nthis question, we propose a deep learning-based computational modeling\napproach. We employ an autoencoder-based approach built on VGG16 convolutional\nneural networks (CNNs) to learn latent representations of images. The model is\ntrained in a single-epoch setting, mirroring human memory experiments that\nassess recall after a single exposure. We examine the relationship between\nautoencoder reconstruction error and memorability, analyze the distinctiveness\nof latent space representations, and develop a multi-layer perceptron (MLP)\nmodel for memorability prediction. Additionally, we perform interpretability\nanalysis using Integrated Gradients (IG) to identify the key visual\ncharacteristics that contribute to memorability. Our results demonstrate a\nsignificant correlation between the images' memorability score and the\nautoencoder's reconstruction error, as well as the robust predictive\nperformance of its latent representations. Distinctiveness in these\nrepresentations correlated significantly with memorability. Additionally,\ncertain visual characteristics were identified as features contributing to\nimage memorability in our model. These findings suggest that autoencoder-based\nrepresentations capture fundamental aspects of image memorability, providing\nnew insights into the computational modeling of human visual memory.",

    "abstract": "Model collapse, a phenomenon characterized by performance degradation due to\niterative training on synthetic data, has been widely studied. However, its\nimplications for bias amplification, the progressive intensification of\npre-existing societal biases in Large Language Models (LLMs), remain\nsignificantly underexplored, despite the growing influence of LLMs in shaping\nonline discourse. In this paper, we introduce a open, generational, and\nlong-context benchmark specifically designed to measure political bias\namplification in LLMs, leveraging sentence continuation tasks derived from a\ncomprehensive dataset of U.S. political news. Our empirical study using GPT-2\nreveals consistent and substantial political bias intensification (e.g.,\nright-leaning amplification) over iterative synthetic training cycles. We\nevaluate three mitigation strategies, Overfitting, Preservation, and\nAccumulation, and demonstrate that bias amplification persists independently of\nmodel collapse, even when the latter is effectively controlled. Furthermore, we\npropose a mechanistic analysis approach that identifies neurons correlated with\nspecific phenomena during inference through regression and statistical tests.\nThis analysis uncovers largely distinct neuron populations driving bias\namplification and model collapse, underscoring fundamentally different\nunderlying mechanisms. Finally, we supplement our empirical findings with\ntheoretical intuition that explains the separate origins of these phenomena,\nguiding targeted strategies for bias mitigation.",

Given the NP-hard nature of this problem, we employ a semidefinite\nrelaxation approach to approximate the underlying optimization problem.

    "abstract": "Receptor occupancy (RO) studies using PET neuroimaging play a critical role\nin the development of drugs targeting the central nervous system (CNS). The\nconventional approach to estimate drug receptor occupancy consists in\nestimation of binding potential changes between two PET scans (baseline and\npost-drug injection). This estimation is typically performed separately for\neach scan by first reconstructing dynamic PET scan data before fitting a\nkinetic model to time activity curves. This approach fails to properly model\nthe noise in PET measurements, resulting in poor RO estimates, especially in\nlow receptor density regions. Objective: In this work, we evaluate a novel\njoint direct parametric reconstruction framework to directly estimate\ndistributions of RO and other kinetic parameters in the brain from a pair of\nbaseline and post-drug injection dynamic PET scans. Methods: The proposed\nmethod combines the use of regularization on RO maps with alternating\noptimization to enable estimation of occupancy even in low binding regions.\nResults: Simulation results demonstrate the quantitative improvement of this\nmethod over conventional approaches in terms of accuracy and precision of\noccupancy. The proposed method is also evaluated in preclinical in-vivo\nexperiments using 11C-MK-6884 and a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor 4\npositive allosteric modulator drug, showing improved estimation of receptor\noccupancy as compared to traditional estimators. Conclusion: The proposed joint\ndirect estimation framework improves RO estimation compared to conventional\nmethods, especially in intermediate to low-binding regions.

This particle-mesh\nscheme employs the Exact mapping method for transferring fluid properties\nbetween SPH particles and Voronoi grids on which the MCRT simulation is carried\nout.

    "abstract": "Despite the popularity of multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) in\nsimulated and two-player applications, its success in messy real-world\napplications has been limited. A key challenge lies in its generalizability\nacross problem variations, a common necessity for many real-world problems.\nContextual reinforcement learning (CRL) formalizes learning policies that\ngeneralize across problem variations. However, the lack of standardized\nbenchmarks for multi-agent CRL has hindered progress in the field. Such\nbenchmarks are desired to be based on real-world applications to naturally\ncapture the many open challenges of real-world problems that affect\ngeneralization. To bridge this gap, we propose IntersectionZoo, a comprehensive\nbenchmark suite for multi-agent CRL through the real-world application of\ncooperative eco-driving in urban road networks. The task of cooperative\neco-driving is to control a fleet of vehicles to reduce fleet-level vehicular\nemissions. By grounding IntersectionZoo in a real-world application, we\nnaturally capture real-world problem characteristics, such as partial\nobservability and multiple competing objectives. IntersectionZoo is built on\ndata-informed simulations of 16,334 signalized intersections derived from 10\nmajor US cities, modeled in an open-source industry-grade microscopic traffic\nsimulator. By modeling factors affecting vehicular exhaust emissions (e.g.,\ntemperature, road conditions, travel demand), IntersectionZoo provides one\nmillion data-driven traffic scenarios. Using these traffic scenarios, we\nbenchmark popular multi-agent RL and human-like driving algorithms and\ndemonstrate that the popular multi-agent RL algorithms struggle to generalize\nin CRL settings.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the elastic scattering of an electron by a\nYukawa potential within the framework of non-commutative (NC) geometry. We\nfirst derive the NC correction to the Yukawa potential at leading order in the\nNC parameter, resulting in a modified potential resembling a screened Kratzer\npotential. This potential reduces to the standard Kratzer form when considering\nthe NC correction to the Coulomb potential. Subsequently, we calculate the NC\ncorrection to the electron scattering amplitude using the first-order Born\napproximation. We then analyze the effects of NC geometry on both the\ndifferential and total cross sections for elastic scattering. Our results\nindicate that non-commutativity enhances the differential cross section at\nsmall scattering angles and naturally gives rise to a Kratzer-like potential,\nreflecting the quantum nature of spacetime. Additionally, we establish a direct\nrelationship between the system's energy level and the bound on the NC\nparameter. Specifically, for an ultra-relativistic incident electron scattering\nby a heavy molecule, we derive a new lower bound on $\\Theta$ of the order of\n$10^{-28}\\,\\text{m}$.",

    "abstract": "There has been active investigation into deep learning approaches for time\nseries analysis, including foundation models. However, most studies do not\naddress significant scientific applications. This paper aims to identify key\nfeatures in time series by examining hydrology data. Our work advances computer\nscience by emphasizing critical application features and contributes to\nhydrology and other scientific fields by identifying modeling approaches that\neffectively capture these features. Scientific time series data are inherently\ncomplex, involving observations from multiple locations, each with various\ntime-dependent data streams and exogenous factors that may be static or\ntime-varying and either application-dependent or purely mathematical. This\nresearch analyzes hydrology time series from the CAMELS and Caravan global\ndatasets, which encompass rainfall and runoff data across catchments, featuring\nup to six observed streams and 209 static parameters across approximately 8,000\nlocations. Our investigation assesses the impact of exogenous data through\neight different model configurations for key hydrology tasks. Results\ndemonstrate that integrating exogenous information enhances data\nrepresentation, reducing mean squared error by up to 40% in the largest\ndataset. Additionally, we present a detailed performance comparison of over 20\nstate-of-the-art pattern and foundation models. The analysis is fully\nopen-source, facilitated by Jupyter Notebook on Google Colab for LSTM-based\nmodeling, data preprocessing, and model comparisons. Preliminary findings using\nalternative deep learning architectures reveal that models incorporating\ncomprehensive observed and exogenous data outperform more limited approaches,\nincluding foundation models.

We\nintroduce Future-Guided Learning, an approach that enhances time-series event\nforecasting through a dynamic feedback mechanism inspired by predictive coding.\nOur method involves two models: a detection model that analyzes future data to\nidentify critical events and a forecasting model that predicts these events\nbased on current data. When discrepancies occur between the forecasting and\ndetection models, a more significant update is applied to the forecasting\nmodel, effectively minimizing surprise and adapting to shifts in the data\ndistribution by aligning its predictions with actual future outcomes. This\nfeedback loop allows the forecasting model to dynamically adjust its\nparameters, focusing on persistent features despite changes in the data. We\nvalidate our approach on a variety of tasks, demonstrating a 44.8% increase in\nAUC-ROC for seizure prediction using EEG data, and a 48.7% reduction in MSE for\nforecasting in nonlinear dynamical systems.

    "abstract": "The rheology of dense suspensions lacks a universal description due to the\ninvolvement of a wide variety of parameters, ranging from the physical\nproperties of solid particles to the nature of the external deformation or\napplied stress. While the former controls microscopic interactions, spatial\nvariations in the latter induce heterogeneity in the flow, making it difficult\nto find suitable constitutive laws to describe the rheology in a unified way.\nFor homogeneous driving with a spatially uniform strain rate, the rheology of\nnon-Brownian dense suspensions is well described by the conventional $\\mu(J)$\nrheology. However, this rheology fails in the inhomogeneous case due to\nnon-local effects, where the flow in one region is influenced by the flow in\nanother. Here, motivated by observations from simulation data, we introduce a\nnew dimensionless number, the suspension temperature $\\Theta_s$, which contains\ninformation on local particle velocity fluctuations. We find that\n$\\mu(J,\\Theta_s)$ provides a unified description for both homogeneous and\ninhomogeneous flows. By employing scaling theory, we identify a set of\nconstitutive laws for dense suspensions of frictional spherical particles and\nfrictionless rod-shaped particles. Combining these scaling relations with the\nmomentum balance equation for our model system, we predict the spatial\nvariation of the relevant dimensionless numbers, the volume fraction $\\phi$,\nthe viscous number $J$, the macroscopic friction coefficient $\\mu$, and\n$\\Theta_s$ solely from the nature of the imposed external driving.",

    "abstract": "This paper studies the use of a multi-attribute auction in a communication\nsystem to bring about efficient relaying in a non-cooperative setting. We\nconsider a system where a source seeks to offload data to an access point (AP)\nwhile balancing both the timeliness and energy-efficiency of the transmission.\nA deep fade in the communication channel (due to, e.g., a line-of-sight\nblockage) makes direct communication costly, and the source may alternatively\nrely on non-cooperative UEs to act as relays. We propose a multi-attribute\nauction to select a UE and to determine the duration and power of the\ntransmission, with payments to the UE taking the form of energy sent via\nwireless power transfer (WPT). The quality of the channel from a UE to the AP\nconstitutes private information, and bids consist of a transmission time and\ntransmission power. We show that under a second-preferred-offer auction,\ntruthful bidding by all candidate UEs forms a Nash Equilibrium. However, this\nauction is not incentive compatible, and we present a modified auction in which\ntruthful bidding is in fact a dominant strategy. Extensive numerical\nexperimentation illustrates the efficacy of our approach, which we compare to a\ncooperative baseline. We demonstrate that with as few as two candidates, our\nimproved mechanism leads to as much as a 76% reduction in energy consumption,\nand that with as few as three candidates, the transmission time decreases by as\nmuch as 55%. Further, we see that as the number of candidates increases, the\nperformance of our mechanism approaches that of the cooperative baseline.\nOverall, our findings highlight the potential of multi-attribute auctions to\nenhance the efficiency of data transfer in non-cooperative settings.",

The three approaches considered are the following: A VGG16 model\npre-trained on ImageNet, defined here as the Base-Source model, fine-tuned to\npredict source domain squares and then used to predict target domain squares\nwithout any domain adaptation; an improved version of the Base-Source model\nwhich applied CORAL loss to some of the final fully connected layers of the\nVGG16 to implement DA; and a Domain Adversarial Neural Network (DANN) which\nused the adversarial training of a domain discriminator to perform the DA.\nAlso, although we opted not to use the labels of the target domain for this\nstudy, we trained a baseline with the same architecture as the Base-Source\nmodel (Named Base-Target) directly on the target domain in order to get an\nupper bound on the performance achievable through domain adaptation. The\nresults show that the DANN model only results in a 3% loss in accuracy when\ncompared to the Base-Target model while saving all the effort required to label\nthe data.",

There are emerging signs that\nsome of the mergers detected by the LIGO and Virgo gravitational wave detectors\ncould indeed be eccentric. Nevertheless, the identification of eccentricity via\ngravitational waves remains challenging, to a large extent because of the\nlimited availability of eccentric gravitational waveforms. While multiple\nsuites of eccentric waveforms have recently been developed, they each cover\nonly a part of the binary parameter space. Here we evaluate the sensitivity of\nLIGO to eccentric waveforms from the SXS and RIT numerical relativity catalogs\nand the TEOBResumS-Dali waveform model using data from LIGO-Virgo-Kagra's third\nobserving run. The obtained sensitivities, as functions of eccentricity, mass\nand mass ratio, are important inputs to understanding detection prospects and\nobservational population constrains. In addition, our results enable the\ncomparison of the waveforms to establish their compatibility and applicability\nfor searches and parameter estimation.",

On the basis of the method, accounting for all contributions to the\nVan Vleck paramagnetism and Langevin (Larmore) diamagnetism, a full-scale ab\ninitio calculation of $\\chi$ in diamond is performed. Unfamiliar contributions\nto $\\chi$ includes a Van Vleck contribution from the interstitial region and an\noffset contribution from the muffin-tin (MT) sphere, appearing due to the\nchange of the MT-sphere magnetic moment when the sphere is displaced from the\norigin. Although the Langevin diamagnetism explicitly depends on the choice of\nthe origin, its sum with the Van Vleck term remains invariant, which is\ndemonstrated on the basis of the gauge invariance of the magnetic vector\npotential. The derived expressions have been applied to ab initio calculations\nof magnetic susceptibility of the crystalline diamond within the linear\naugmented plane wave method (LAPW). With the diamond unit cell having the\ninversion symmetry, the magnetic (Van Vleck) calculations require the\nirreducible part of the Brillouin zone accounting for half of the whole zone,\ni.e. 24 times larger than that in the absence of magnetic field. Investigating\npossible anisotropy of $\\chi$, we calculate it for 74 different directions of H\n(belonging to Lebedev surface grid points), and demonstrate that the actual\nvalue of $\\chi$ remain isotropic.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a data-driven solution for Volt-VAR control problem in\nactive distribution system. As distribution system models are always inaccurate\nand incomplete, it is quite difficult to solve the problem. To handle with this\ndilemma, this paper formulates the Volt-VAR control problem as a constrained\nMarkov decision process (CMDP). By synergistically combining the augmented\nLagrangian method and soft actor critic algorithm, a novel safe off-policy\nreinforcement learning (RL) approach is proposed in this paper to solve the\nCMDP. The actor network is updated in a policy gradient manner with the\nLagrangian value function. A double-critics network is adopted to synchronously\nestimate the action-value function to avoid overestimation bias. The proposed\nalgorithm does not require strong convexity guarantee of examined problems and\nis sample efficient. A two-stage strategy is adopted for offline training and\nonline execution, so the accurate distribution system model is no longer\nneeded. To achieve scalability, a centralized training distributed execution\nstrategy is adopted for a multi-agent framework, which enables a decentralized\nVolt-VAR control for large-scale distribution system. Comprehensive numerical\nexperiments with real-world electricity data demonstrate that our proposed\nalgorithm can achieve high solution optimality and constraints compliance.",

TSUMs align task\nrequirements and environmental features using a shared representation space,\ngenerated via a domain-adapted encoder. Using TSUMs, we propose Generalized\nUncertainty Integration for Decision-Making and Execution (GUIDE), a policy\nconditioning framework that incorporates these uncertainty requirements into\nrobot decision-making. We find that TSUMs provide an effective way to abstract\ntask-specific uncertainty requirements, and conditioning policies on TSUMs\nenables the robot to reason about the context-dependent value of certainty and\nadapt its behavior accordingly. We show how integrating GUIDE into\nreinforcement learning frameworks allows the agent to learn navigation policies\nthat effectively balance task completion and uncertainty management without\nexplicit reward engineering. We evaluate GUIDE on various real-world robotic\nnavigation tasks and find that it demonstrates significant improvement in task\ncompletion rates compared to baseline methods that do not explicitly consider\ntask-specific uncertainty.",

    "abstract": "Linguistic fuzzy information evolution is crucial in understanding\ninformation exchange among agents. However, different agent weights may lead to\ndifferent convergence results in the classic DeGroot model. Similarly, in the\nHegselmann-Krause bounded confidence model (HK model), changing the confidence\nthreshold values of agents can lead to differences in the final results. To\naddress these limitations, this paper proposes three new models of linguistic\nfuzzy information dynamics: the per-round random leader election\nmechanism-based DeGroot model (PRRLEM-DeGroot), the PRRLEM-based homogeneous HK\nmodel (PRRLEM-HOHK), and the PRRLEM-based heterogeneous HK model (PRRLEM-HEHK).\nIn these models, after each round of fuzzy information updates, an agent is\nrandomly selected to act as a temporary leader with more significant influence,\nwith the leadership structure being reset after each update. This strategy\nincreases the information sharing and enhances decision-making by integrating\nmultiple agents' evaluation information, which is also in line with real life\n(\\emph{Leader is not unchanged}). The Monte Carlo method is then employed to\nsimulate the behavior of complex systems through repeated random tests,\nobtaining confidence intervals for different fuzzy information. Subsequently,\nan improved golden rule representative value (GRRV) in fuzzy theory is proposed\nto rank these confidence intervals. Simulation examples and a real-world\nscenario about space situational awareness validate the effectiveness of the\nproposed models. Comparative analysis with the other models demonstrate our\nability to address the echo chamber and improve the robustness.",

Understanding the (in)dependence structure allows us to\nsubstantially improve the estimation as it allows for an effective\nfactorization of the probability distribution. In order to estimate the\nprobability distribution of a M dimensional binary vector, we leverage a\nBahadur representation that connects the sparsity of its coefficients with\nindependence across the components. We propose to use regularized and\nadversarial regularized estimators to obtain an adaptive estimator with respect\nto the dependence structure which allows for rates of convergence to depend on\nthis intrinsic (lower) dimension. These estimators are needed to handle several\nchallenges within this setting, including estimating nuisance parameters,\nestimating covariates, and nonseparable moment conditions. Our main results\nconsider the presence of (low dimensional) covariates for which we propose a\nlocally penalized estimator. We provide pointwise rates of convergence\naddressing several issues in the theoretical analyses as we strive for making a\ncomputationally tractable formulation. We apply our results in the estimation\nof causal effects with multiple binary treatments and show how our estimators\ncan improve the finite sample performance when compared with non-adaptive\nestimators that try to estimate all the probabilities directly.

We propose future research directions to ease these\ndifficulties, moving closer to real-world smartphone agent applications.\nSPA-Bench is available at https://ai-agents-2030.github.io/SPA-Bench/.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive\ncapabilities across various real-world applications. However, due to the\ncurrent text-in-text-out paradigm, it remains challenging for LLMs to handle\ndynamic and complex application constraints, let alone devise general solutions\nthat meet predefined system goals. Current common practices like model\nfinetuning and reflection-based reasoning often address these issues\ncase-by-case, limiting their generalizability. To address this issue, we\npropose a flexible framework that enables LLMs to interact with system\ninterfaces, summarize constraint concepts, and continually optimize performance\nmetrics by collaborating with human experts. As a case in point, we initialized\na travel planner agent by establishing constraints from evaluation interfaces.\nThen, we employed both LLM-based and human discriminators to identify critical\ncases and continuously improve agent performance until the desired outcomes\nwere achieved. After just one iteration, our framework achieved a $7.78\\%$ pass\nrate with the human discriminator (a $40.2\\%$ improvement over baseline) and a\n$6.11\\%$ pass rate with the LLM-based discriminator. Given the adaptability of\nour proposal, we believe this framework can be applied to a wide range of\nconstraint-based applications and lay a solid foundation for model finetuning\nwith performance-sensitive data samples.",

The P300\nspeller brain computer interface (BCI) offers an alternative communication\nmedium by leveraging a subject's EEG response to characters traditionally\nhighlighted on a character grid on a graphical user interface (GUI). A\nrecurring theme in P300-based research is enhancing performance to enable\nfaster subject interaction. This study builds on that theme by addressing key\nlimitations, particularly in the training of multi-subject classifiers, and by\nintegrating advanced language models to optimize stimuli presentation and word\nprediction, thereby improving communication efficiency. Furthermore, various\nadvanced large language models such as Generative Pre-Trained Transformer\n(GPT2), BERT, and BART, alongside Dijkstra's algorithm, are utilized to\noptimize stimuli and provide word completion choices based on the spelling\nhistory. In addition, a multi-layered smoothing approach is applied to allow\nfor out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. By conducting extensive simulations based on\nrandomly sampled EEG data from subjects, we show substantial speed improvements\nin typing passages that include rare and out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words, with\nthe extent of improvement varying depending on the language model utilized. The\ngains through such character-level interface optimizations are approximately\n10%, and GPT2 for multi-word prediction provides gains of around 40%. In\nparticular, some large language models achieve performance levels within 10% of\nthe theoretical performance limits established in this study.

One potential strategy involves increasing the frequency,\nfor instance, moving from Q-band (approximately 35 GHz) to W-band\n(approximately 94 GHz). However, this shift typically results in higher\ntransmission and switching losses, as well as increased noise in signal\namplifiers. In this work, we address these shortcomings by employing a W-band\nprobehead integrated with a cryogenic low-noise amplifier (LNA) and a\nmicroresonator. This configuration allows us to position the LNA close to the\nresonator, thereby amplifying the acquired ESR signal with minimal losses.\nFurthermore, when operated at cryogenic temperatures, the LNA exhibits\nunparalleled noise levels that are significantly lower than those of\nconventional room temperature LNAs. We detail the novel probehead design and\nprovide some experimental results at room temperature as well as cryogenic\ntemperatures for representative paramagnetic samples.

A Central Composite Design (CCD) was used to\ngenerate a design matrix for data collection, with EnergyPLAN software used to\ncreate energy system simulations on the CCD data for four outputs: total annual\ncost, CO2 emissions, critical excess electricity production (CEEP), and\nelectricity import. Three machine learning algorithms, support vector\nregression (SVR), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and multi-layer\nperceptron (MLP), were tuned using Bayesian optimization to develop models\nmapping the inputs to outputs. A genetic algorithm was employed for\nmulti-objective optimization to determine the optimal input capacities that\nminimize the outputs. Results indicated that incorporating electricity storage\ntechnologies (EST) leads to a 37% increase in renewable electricity sources\n(RES) share, resulting in a 19.14% reduction in CO2 emissions.

    "abstract": "Motivated by engineering and photonics research on resonators in random or\nuncertain environments, we study rigorous randomizations of boundary conditions\nfor wave equations of the acoustic-type in Lipschitz domains $\\mathcal{O}$.\nFirst, a parametrization of essentially all m-dissipative boundary condition by\ncontraction operators in the boundary $L^2$-space is constructed with the use\nof m-boundary tuples (boundary value spaces). We consider randomizations of\nthese contraction operators that lead to acoustic operators random in the\nresolvent sense. To this end, the use of Neumann-to-Dirichlet maps and\nKrein-type resolvent formulae is crucial. We give a description of random\nm-dissipative boundary conditions that produce acoustic operators with almost\nsurely (a.s.) compact resolvents, and so, also with a.s. discrete spectra. For\neach particular applied model, one can choose a specific boundary condition\nfrom the constructed class either by means of optimization, or on the base of\nempirical observations. A mathematically convenient randomization is\nconstructed in terms of eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator\n$\\Delta^{\\partial \\mathcal{O}}$ on the boundary $\\mathcal{O}$ of the domain. We\nshow that for this randomization the compactness of the resolvent is connected\nwith the Weyl-type asymptotics for the eigenvalues of $\\Delta^{\\partial\n\\mathcal{O}}$.",

Existing neural\ntopic modelling methods often encode contextual information of documents, while\nignoring contextual details of candidate centroid words, leading to the\ninaccurate selection of topic words due to the contextualization gap. In\nparallel, it is found that functional words are frequently selected over\ntopical words. To address these limitations, we introduce CAST: Corpus-Aware\nSelf-similarity Enhanced Topic modelling, a novel topic modelling method that\nbuilds upon candidate centroid word embeddings contextualized on the dataset,\nand a novel self-similarity-based method to filter out less meaningful tokens.\nInspired by findings in contrastive learning that self-similarities of\nfunctional token embeddings in different contexts are much lower than topical\ntokens, we find self-similarity to be an effective metric to prevent functional\nwords from acting as candidate topic words. Our approach significantly enhances\nthe coherence and diversity of generated topics, as well as the topic model's\nability to handle noisy data. Experiments on news benchmark datasets and one\nTwitter dataset demonstrate the method's superiority in generating coherent,\ndiverse topics, and handling noisy data, outperforming strong baselines.",

The high molecular weight of the\nxanthan gum and the numerous charged groups on the side branches attached to\nthe backbone allow the shear and extensional rheology of the xanthan gum\nsolutions to be tuned over a wide range by changing the ionic strength of the\nsolvent. In steady shear flow, increasing the xanthan gum concentration\nincreases both the zero shear viscosity and the extent of shear-thinning of the\nsolution. Conversely, increasing the ionic strength of the solvent by addition\nof sodium chloride (NaCl) decreases both the zero shear viscosity and the level\nof shear-thinning. In transient extensional flow, increasing the xanthan gum\nconcentration changes the dynamics of the capillary thinning from an inelastic\npower-law (IP) response to an elastocapillary (EC) balance, from which an\nextensional relaxation time can be measured based on the rate of filament\nthinning. Increasing the NaCl concentration decreases the extensional\nrelaxation time and the transient extensional viscosity of the viscoelastic\nsolution. Based on the dynamics of capillary thinning observed in the DoS\nexperiments, we provide a relationship for the smallest extensional relaxation\ntime that can be measured using DoS. We suggest that the change in the dynamics\nof capillary thinning from an IP response to an EC response can be used as an\neasy and robust experimental method for identifying the rheologically effective\noverlap concentration of a semi-flexible polyelectrolyte solution, i.e., the\ncritical concentration at which polymer molecules start to interact with each\nother to produce a viscoelastic strain-stiffening response (often perceived as\n\"stringiness\") in transient extensional flows such as those involved in\ndripping, dispensing and filling operations.",

However, the potential of reward models during RL training time still\nremains largely under-explored. It is currently unclear whether these reward\nmodels can provide additional training signals to enhance the reasoning\ncapabilities of LLMs in RL training that uses sparse success rewards, which\nverify the correctness of solutions. In this work, we evaluate popular reward\nmodels for RL training, including the Outcome-supervised Reward Model (ORM) and\nthe Process-supervised Reward Model (PRM), and train a collection of LLMs for\nmath problems using RL by combining these learned rewards with success rewards.\nSurprisingly, even though these learned reward models have strong\ninference-time performances, they may NOT help or even hurt RL training,\nproducing worse performances than LLMs trained with the success reward only.\nOur analysis reveals that an LLM can receive high rewards from some of these\nreward models by repeating correct but unnecessary reasoning steps, leading to\na severe reward hacking issue. Therefore, we introduce two novel reward\nrefinement techniques, including Clipping and Delta. The key idea is to ensure\nthe accumulative reward of any reasoning trajectory is upper-bounded to keep a\nlearned reward model effective without being exploited. We evaluate our\ntechniques with multiple reward models over a set of 1.5B and 7B LLMs on MATH\nand GSM8K benchmarks and demonstrate that with a carefully designed reward\nfunction, RL training without any additional supervised tuning can improve all\nthe evaluated LLMs, including the state-of-the-art 7B LLM\nQwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct on MATH and GSM8K benchmarks.",

Employing variational methods, particularly the mountain pass\ntheorem and a refined blow-up analysis, we establish the existence of\nnontrivial solutions under broader boundary conditions than those considered in\nprevious studies. In contrast to the unweighted approach developed by Ricciardi\n(2006), the incorporation of variable weights \\(\\rho(x)\\) enables a more\naccurate representation of complex geometric domains. This generalization\naddresses cases where the geometry of the manifold or external factors induce\nlocal fluctuations, thereby enhancing the applicability of mean field models to\nreal-world turbulence phenomena. The weighted Sobolev framework also\nstrengthens control over the nonlinearity in the problem, reducing the risk of\nblow-up and ensuring the convergence of solutions in the \\(H^1(M)\\) space. The\nanalysis reveals new conditions for the existence of solutions, including\nsituations where classical methods may fail due to a lack of compactness. The\nsignificant advancement lies in the flexibility of the model; the inclusion of\nweights allows for a more precise description of physical systems in varied\nsettings, representing a key advantage over the original unweighted problem.\nThese results contribute to a deeper understanding of the role of geometric and\nphysical constraints in turbulent behavior and pave new pathways for future\nresearch on nonlinear partial differential equations in complex domains.",

The propmpt engineering in the framework\nconsists of two main stages: systematic prompt generation and prompt\nrefinement. In the prompt generation stage, multi-source data is transformed\ninto descriptive texts understandable by the LLM and stored.

    "abstract": "The shape of the brain's white matter connections is relatively unexplored in\ndiffusion MRI tractography analysis. While it is known that tract shape varies\nin populations and across the human lifespan, it is unknown if the variability\nin dMRI tractography-derived shape may relate to the brain's functional\nvariability across individuals. This work explores the potential of leveraging\ntractography fiber cluster shape measures to predict subject-specific cognitive\nperformance. We implement machine learning models to predict individual\ncognitive performance scores. We study a large-scale database from the HCP-YA\nstudy. We apply an atlas-based fiber cluster parcellation to the dMRI\ntractography of each individual. We compute 15 shape, microstructure, and\nconnectivity features for each fiber cluster. Using these features as input, we\ntrain a total of 210 models to predict 7 different NIH Toolbox cognitive\nperformance assessments. We apply an explainable AI technique, SHAP, to assess\nthe importance of each fiber cluster for prediction. Our results demonstrate\nthat shape measures are predictive of individual cognitive performance. The\nstudied shape measures, such as irregularity, diameter, total surface area,\nvolume, and branch volume, are as effective for prediction as microstructure\nand connectivity measures. The overall best-performing feature is a shape\nfeature, irregularity, which describes how different a cluster's shape is from\nan idealized cylinder. Further interpretation using SHAP values suggest that\nfiber clusters with features highly predictive of cognitive ability are\nwidespread throughout the brain, including fiber clusters from the superficial\nassociation, deep association, cerebellar, striatal, and projection pathways.\nThis study demonstrates the strong potential of shape descriptors to enhance\nthe study of the brain's white matter and its relationship to cognitive\nfunction.",

    "abstract": "Retrieval Augmented Language Models (RALMs) have gained significant attention\nfor their ability to generate accurate answer and improve efficiency. However,\nRALMs are inherently vulnerable to imperfect information due to their reliance\non the imperfect retriever or knowledge source. We identify three common\nscenarios-unanswerable, adversarial, conflicting-where retrieved document sets\ncan confuse RALM with plausible real-world examples. We present the first\ncomprehensive investigation to assess how well RALMs detect and handle such\nproblematic scenarios. Among these scenarios, to systematically examine\nadversarial robustness we propose a new adversarial attack method, Generative\nmodel-based ADVersarial attack (GenADV) and a novel metric Robustness under\nAdditional Document (RAD). Our findings reveal that RALMs often fail to\nidentify the unanswerability or contradiction of a document set, which\nfrequently leads to hallucinations. Moreover, we show the addition of an\nadversary significantly degrades RALM's performance, with the model becoming\neven more vulnerable when the two scenarios overlap (adversarial+unanswerable).\nOur research identifies critical areas for assessing and enhancing the\nrobustness of RALMs, laying the foundation for the development of more robust\nmodels.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the properties of black holes within the\nframework of multi-fractional theories of gravity, focusing on the effects of\nq-derivatives and weighted derivatives. These modifications, which introduce\nscale-dependent spacetime geometries, alter black hole solutions in intriguing\nways. Within these frameworks, we analyze two key observable phenomena - black\nhole shadows and particle deflection angle in the weak field limit - using both\nanalytical techniques and observational data from the Event Horizon Telescope\n(EHT) for M87* and Sgr A*. The study from $q$-derivative formalism reveals that\nthe multi-scale length $\\ell_*$ influences the size of the black hole shadow in\ntwo ways, and modifies the weak deflection angle. Constraints on $\\ell_*$ are\nderived from the EHT observations, showing significant deviations from standard\nSchwarzschild black hole predictions, which range from $10^{9}$ to $10^{10}$\norders of magnitude. Additionally, the weak deflection angle is computed using\nthe non-asymptotic generalization of the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, revealing the\neffects of finite-distance and multi-scale parameters. Using the Sun for Solar\nSystem test, the constraints for $\\ell_*$ range from $10^{8}$ to $10^{9}$\norders of magnitude. Results from the weighted derivative formalism generates a\ndS/AdS-like behavior, where smaller deviations are found in the strong field\nregime than in the weak field regime. The results suggest that while these\neffects are subtle, they provide a potential observational signature of quantum\ngravity effects. The findings presented here contribute to the broader effort\nof testing alternative theories of gravity through black hole observations,\noffering a new perspective on the quantum structure of spacetime at\ncosmological and astrophysical scales.",

At the time of writing, the proposed\nGFVC approach using SEI messages has been adopted into the official working\ndraft of Versatile Supplemental Enhancement Information (VSEI) standard by the\nJoint Video Experts Team (JVET) of ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 29 and ITU-T SG16, which\nwill be standardized as a new version for \"ITU-T H.274 | ISO/IEC 23002-7\". To\nthe best of the authors' knowledge, the JVET work on the proposed SEI-based\nGFVC approach is the first standardization activity for generative video\ncompression. The proposed SEI approach has not only advanced the reconstruction\nquality of early-day Model-Based Coding (MBC) via the state-of-the-art\ngenerative technique, but also established a new SEI definition for future GFVC\napplications and deployment. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed\nSEI-based GFVC approach can achieve remarkable rate-distortion performance\ncompared with the latest Versatile Video Coding (VVC) standard, whilst also\npotentially enabling a wide variety of functionalities including user-specified\nanimation/filtering and metaverse-related applications.",

This method is more stable\ncompared to other weighting methods, such as inverse probability weighting\nestimators, in terms of the variance of the estimators. In subclassification\nestimators, the number of strata is traditionally set at five, and this number\nis not typically chosen based on data information. Even when the number of\nstrata is selected, the uncertainty from the selection process is often not\nproperly accounted for. In this study, we propose a novel Bayesian-based\nsubclassification estimator that can assess the uncertainty in the number of\nstrata, rather than selecting a single optimal number, using a Bayesian\nparadigm. To achieve this, we apply a general Bayesian procedure that does not\nrely on a likelihood function. This procedure allows us to avoid making strong\nassumptions about the outcome model, maintaining the same flexibility as\ntraditional causal inference methods. With the proposed Bayesian procedure, it\nis expected that uncertainties from the design phase can be appropriately\nreflected in the analysis phase, which is sometimes overlooked in non-Bayesian\ncontexts.",

Simultaneous modulation of the real and the\nimaginary part of the interaction potentials (of the refractive index and the\ngain/loss in the case of optical systems) can result in unequal coupling\ncoefficients between the fields of different parts of the system. The\nunidirectional coupling can also be arranged not only between the internal\nfields of the system but also between internal fields and external radiation.\nAt a particular (exceptional) point the situation can be achieved, that the\nexternal radiation is efficiently coupled into the system, but the internal\nradiation cannot escape backwards. In this way, the incident radiation can be\ntrapped inside the non-Hermitian system and, eventually, can be efficiently\nabsorbed there. We realize this idea in non-Hermitically modulated thin films.\nThe modulation consists of a Hermitian part - the periodic corrugation of the\nsurfaces of a thin film, and a non-Hermitian part - the modulation of losses\nalong the film. We prove numerically and demonstrate experimentally that the\nincident radiation, coupled with such a non-Hermitian thin film, is\nunidirectionally trapped into a planar mode of the film, does not escape from\nthe film (or escape weakly due to experimental imperfections), and is\nefficiently absorbed there.",

To balance the\nefficiency and robustness of traditional mesh smoothing process, previous\napproaches have employed supervised learning and reinforcement learning to\ntrain intelligent smoothing models. However, these methods heavily rely on\nlabeled dataset or prior knowledge to guide the models' learning. Furthermore,\ntheir limited capacity to enhance mesh connectivity often restricts the\neffectiveness of smoothing. In this paper, we first systematically analyze the\nlearning mechanisms of recent intelligent smoothing methods and propose a\nprior-free reinforcement learning model for intelligent mesh smoothing. Our\nproposed model integrates graph neural networks with reinforcement learning to\nimplement an intelligent node smoothing agent and introduces, for the first\ntime, a mesh connectivity improvement agent.

Empirical results show\nGDPO can generate far more diverse responses than the baseline methods that are\nstill relatively aligned with human values in dialog generation and\nsummarization tasks.",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks trained on biased data often inadvertently learn\nunintended inference rules, particularly when labels are strongly correlated\nwith biased features. Existing bias mitigation methods typically involve either\na) predefining bias types and enforcing them as prior knowledge or b)\nreweighting training samples to emphasize bias-conflicting samples over\nbias-aligned samples. However, both strategies address bias indirectly in the\nfeature or sample space, with no control over learned weights, making it\ndifficult to control the bias propagation across different layers. Based on\nthis observation, we introduce a novel approach to address bias directly in the\nmodel's parameter space, preventing its propagation across layers. Our method\ninvolves training two models: a bias model for biased features and a debias\nmodel for unbiased details, guided by the bias model. We enforce dissimilarity\nin the debias model's later layers and similarity in its initial layers with\nthe bias model, ensuring it learns unbiased low-level features without adopting\nbiased high-level abstractions. By incorporating this explicit constraint\nduring training, our approach shows enhanced classification accuracy and\ndebiasing effectiveness across various synthetic and real-world datasets of\ndifferent sizes. Moreover, the proposed method demonstrates robustness across\ndifferent bias types and percentages of biased samples in the training data.\nThe code is available at: https://visdomlab.github.io/CosFairNet/",

Current visual SSMs often convert images\ninto 1D sequences and employ various scanning patterns to incorporate local\nspatial dependencies. However, these methods are limited in effectively\ncapturing the complex image spatial structures and the increased computational\ncost caused by the lengthened scanning paths. To address these limitations, we\npropose Spatial-Mamba, a novel approach that establishes neighborhood\nconnectivity directly in the state space. Instead of relying solely on\nsequential state transitions, we introduce a structure-aware state fusion\nequation, which leverages dilated convolutions to capture image spatial\nstructural dependencies, significantly enhancing the flow of visual contextual\ninformation. Spatial-Mamba proceeds in three stages: initial state computation\nin a unidirectional scan, spatial context acquisition through structure-aware\nstate fusion, and final state computation using the observation equation. Our\ntheoretical analysis shows that Spatial-Mamba unifies the original Mamba and\nlinear attention under the same matrix multiplication framework, providing a\ndeeper understanding of our method.

    "abstract": "Dozens of white dwarfs with anomalous metal polluted atmospheres (DZ WDs) are\nknown to host dust and gas discs. The line profiles of the Ca II triplet\nemitted by the gas discs show significant asymmetry. Several minor planets have\nbeen discovered orbiting such WDs. The most challenging burden of modelling gas\ndiscs around DZ WDs is to simultaneously explain the asymmetry and metal\npollution of the WD's atmosphere, while staying consistent with other aspects\nof the observations, like the morphology of the Ca II lines. This paper aims to\nconstruct a self-consistent model to explain the simultaneous WD pollution and\nCa II line asymmetry over at least three years. In our model an asteroid\ndisintegrates in an eccentric orbit, periodically entering below the WD's Roche\nlimit. The resulting debris sublimates at a temperature of 1500 K, producing\ngas that viscously spreads to form a disc. The evolution of the discs is\nstudied over a period of 1.2 years using two-dimensional hydrodynamic\nsimulations. Synthetic Ca II line profiles are calculated using the surface\nmass density and velocity distributions provided by the simulations, for the\nfirst time taking into account the asymmetric velocity distribution in the\ndiscs. An asteroid disintegrating in an eccentric orbit gives rise to the\nformation of an asymmetric disc and asymmetric Ca II triplet emission. Our\nmodel can explain the periodic reversal of the red- and blueshifted peak of the\nCa II lines caused by the precession of the disc on timescales of 10.6 to 177.4\ndays. Our work suggests that the persistence of Ca II asymmetry over decades\nand its periodic change in the peaks can be explained in two scenarios: a) the\nasteroid disrupts on a short timescale (couple of orbits), and the gas has a\nlow viscosity range (0.001<alpha<0.05), b) the asteroid disrupts on a timescale\nof a year, and the viscosity of the gas is required to be high, alpha=0.1.",

We also show how to compute a set of \"explanations\" for a given\nreduction, which can be used to compute its probability in a more efficient\nway. Finally, we illustrate our approach with several examples and outline a\ncouple of extensions that may prove useful to improve the expressive power of\nprobabilistic rewrite systems.",

However, current techniques face\nexcessive overhead due to a naive postprocessing method that neglects potential\noptimizations in the circuit structure. To overcome this, we introduce qTPU, a\nframework for scalable hybrid quantum-classical processing using tensor\nnetworks. By leveraging our hybrid quantum circuit contraction method, we\nrepresent circuit execution as the contraction of a hybrid tensor network\n(h-TN). The qTPU compiler automates efficient h-TN generation, optimizing the\nbalance between estimated error and postprocessing overhead, while the qTPU\nruntime supports large-scale h-TN contraction using quantum and classical\naccelerators. Our evaluation shows orders-of-magnitude reductions in\npostprocessing overhead, a $10^4\\times$ speedup in postprocessing, and a\n20.7$\\times$ reduction in overall runtime compared to the state-of-the-art\nQiskit-Addon-Cutting (QAC).",

    "abstract": "We present a method to rapidly approximate convolution quadrature (CQ)\napproximations, based on a piecewise polynomial interpolation of the Laplace\ndomain operator, which we call the \\emph{parsimonious} convolution quadrature\nmethod. For implicit Euler and second order backward difference formula based\ndiscretizations, we require $O(\\sqrt{N}\\log N)$ evaluations in the Laplace\ndomain to approximate $N$ time steps of the convolution quadrature method to\nsatisfactory accuracy. The methodology proposed here differentiates from the\nwell-understood fast and oblivious convolution quadrature \\cite{SLL06}, since\nit is applicable to Laplace domain operator families that are only defined and\npolynomially bounded on a positive half space, which includes acoustic and\nelectromagnetic wave scattering problems. The methods is applicable to linear\nand nonlinear integral equations. To elucidate the core idea, we give a\ncomplete and extensive analysis of the simplest case and derive worst-case\nestimates for the performance of parsimonious CQ based on the implicit Euler\nmethod. For sectorial Laplace transforms, we obtain methods that require\n$O(\\log^2 N)$ Laplace domain evaluations on the complex right-half space.

In this paper, we propose an independent\nfeature enhanced crossmodal fusion model (IFE-CF) for match-mismatch\nclassification, which leverages the fusion feature of the speech stimulus and\nthe EEG response to achieve auditory EEG decoding. Specifically, our IFE-CF\ncontains a crossmodal encoder to encode the speech stimulus and the EEG\nresponse with a two-branch structure connected via crossmodal attention\nmechanism in the encoding process, a multi-channel fusion module to fuse\nfeatures of two modalities by aggregating the interaction feature obtained from\nthe crossmodal encoder and the independent feature obtained from the speech\nstimulus and EEG response, and a predictor to give the matching result. In\naddition, the causal mask is introduced to consider the time delay of the\nspeech-EEG pair in the crossmodal encoder, which further enhances the feature\nrepresentation for match-mismatch classification.

In this paper, we introduce PAT (Parameter-free\nAudio-Text aligner), a simple and training-free method aimed at boosting the\nzero-shot audio classification performance of CLAP-like ALMs. To achieve this,\nwe propose to improve the cross-modal interaction between audio and language\nmodalities by enhancing the representations for both modalities using mutual\nfeedback. Precisely, to enhance textual representations, we propose a prompt\nensemble algorithm that automatically selects and combines the most relevant\nprompts from a datastore with a large pool of handcrafted prompts and weighs\nthem according to their relevance to the audio. On the other hand, to enhance\naudio representations, we reweigh the frame-level audio features based on the\nenhanced textual information. Our proposed method does not require any\nadditional modules or parameters and can be used with any existing CLAP-like\nALM to improve zero-shot audio classification performance. We experiment across\n18 diverse benchmark datasets and 6 ALMs and show that the PAT outperforms\nvanilla zero-shot evaluation with significant margins of 0.42%-27.0%.\nAdditionally, we demonstrate that PAT maintains robust performance even when\ninput audio is degraded by varying levels of noise.

    "abstract": "Cognitive diagnosis model (CDM) is a fundamental and upstream component in\nintelligent education. It aims to infer students' mastery levels based on\nhistorical response logs. However, existing CDMs usually follow the ID-based\nembedding paradigm, which could often diminish the effectiveness of CDMs in\nopen student learning environments. This is mainly because they can hardly\ndirectly infer new students' mastery levels or utilize new exercises or\nknowledge without retraining. Textual semantic information, due to its unified\nfeature space and easy accessibility, can help alleviate this issue.\nUnfortunately, directly incorporating semantic information may not benefit\nCDMs, since it does not capture response-relevant features and thus discards\nthe individual characteristics of each student. To this end, this paper\nproposes a dual-fusion cognitive diagnosis framework (DFCD) to address the\nchallenge of aligning two different modalities, i.e., textual semantic features\nand response-relevant features. Specifically, in DFCD, we first propose the\nexercise-refiner and concept-refiner to make the exercises and knowledge\nconcepts more coherent and reasonable via large language models. Then, DFCD\nencodes the refined features using text embedding models to obtain the semantic\ninformation. For response-related features, we propose a novel response matrix\nto fully incorporate the information within the response logs. Finally, DFCD\ndesigns a dual-fusion module to merge the two modal features. The ultimate\nrepresentations possess the capability of inference in open student learning\nenvironments and can be also plugged in existing CDMs. Extensive experiments\nacross real-world datasets show that DFCD achieves superior performance by\nintegrating different modalities and strong adaptability in open student\nlearning environments.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Recognizing diseases from discharge letters is crucial for cohort\nselection and epidemiological analyses, as this is the only type of data\nconsistently produced across hospitals. This is a classic document\nclassification problem, typically requiring supervised learning. However,\nmanual annotation of large datasets of discharge letters is uncommon since it\nis extremely time-consuming. We propose a novel weakly-supervised pipeline to\nrecognize diseases from Italian discharge letters. Methods: Our Natural\nLanguage Processing pipeline is based on a fine-tuned version of the Italian\nUmberto model. The pipeline extracts diagnosis-related sentences from a subset\nof letters and applies a two-level clustering using the embeddings generated by\nthe fine-tuned Umberto model. These clusters are summarized and those mapped to\nthe diseases of interest are selected as weak labels. Finally, the same\nBERT-based model is trained using these weak labels to detect the targeted\ndiseases. Results: A case study related to the identification of bronchiolitis\nwith 33'176 Italian discharge letters from 44 hospitals in the Veneto Region\nshows the potential of our method, with an AUC of 77.7 % and an F1-Score of\n75.1 % on manually annotated labels, improving compared to other non-supervised\nmethods and with a limited loss compared to fully supervised methods. Results\nare robust to the cluster selection and the identified clusters highlight the\npotential to recognize a variety of diseases. Conclusions: This study\ndemonstrates the feasibility of diagnosis identification from Italian discharge\nletters in the absence of labelled data. Our pipeline showed strong performance\nand robustness, and its flexibility allows for easy adaptation to various\ndiseases.

    "abstract": "Fallacies are defective arguments with faulty reasoning. Detecting and\nclassifying them is a crucial NLP task to prevent misinformation, manipulative\nclaims, and biased decisions. However, existing fallacy classifiers are limited\nby the requirement for sufficient labeled data for training, which hinders\ntheir out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization abilities. In this paper, we\nfocus on leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for zero-shot fallacy\nclassification. To elicit fallacy-related knowledge and reasoning abilities of\nLLMs, we propose diverse single-round and multi-round prompting schemes,\napplying different task-specific instructions such as extraction,\nsummarization, and Chain-of-Thought reasoning. With comprehensive experiments\non benchmark datasets, we suggest that LLMs could be potential zero-shot\nfallacy classifiers. In general, LLMs under single-round prompting schemes have\nachieved acceptable zero-shot performances compared to the best full-shot\nbaselines and can outperform them in all OOD inference scenarios and some\nopen-domain tasks. Our novel multi-round prompting schemes can effectively\nbring about more improvements, especially for small LLMs. Our analysis further\nunderlines the future research on zero-shot fallacy classification.

To overcome this dilemma, we\npropose a novel temporal community model named maximal-truss (MDT). This model\nemphasizes maximal temporal support, ensuring all edges are connected by a\nsequence of triangles with elegant temporal properties. To search the MDT\ncontaining the user-initiated query node q (q-MDT), we first design a powerful\nlocal search framework with some effective pruning strategies.

To further improve the performance on large graphs, we build\nthe temporal trussness index (TT-index) for all edges.

However, the\npulse distortion poses a significant challenge to the control precision.\nCurrent calibration methods, which often rely on microwave crosstalk or\nadditional readout resonators for coupler excitation and readout, tend to be\ncumbersome and inefficient, especially when couplers only have flux control.\nHere, we introduce and experimentally validate a novel pulse calibration scheme\nthat exploits the strong coupling between qubits and couplers, eliminating the\nneed for extra coupler readout and excitation. Our method directly measures the\nshort-time and long-time step responses of the coupler flux pulse transient,\nenabling us to apply predistortion to subsequent signals using fast Fourier\ntransformation and deconvolution. This approach not only simplifies the\ncalibration process but also significantly improves the precision and stability\nof the flux control.

By\ncomparing the $S$ indices between single and binary stars within each color\nbin, we found for K type stars, binaries exhibit enhanced activity compared to\nsingle stars, which could be attributed to the increase in spin rate caused by\ntidal synchronization or to the interactions of magnetic fields.

The\nparameter solution of the R(G) function provides a general method to improve\nthe information efficiency, G/R. This paper briefly introduces the semantic\ninformation G measure and the parametric solution of the R(G) function. Two\nexamples reveal that the parametric solution can help us optimize range control\nwith the tradeoff between purposiveness (i.e., semantic mutual information) and\ninformation efficiency. It seems that the R(G) function can serve as the\ntheoretical basis of IMM methods, but we still need further research in\ncombination with deep learning, reinforcement learning, and constraint control.",

However, their limitations in capturing global features hinder their\nperformance in complex segmentation tasks. The rise of Vision Transformer (ViT)\nhas effectively compensated for this deficiency of CNNs and promoted the\napplication of ViT-based U-networks in medical image segmentation. However, the\nhigh computational demands of ViT make it unsuitable for many medical devices\nand mobile platforms with limited resources, restricting its deployment on\nresource-constrained and edge devices. To address this, we propose EViT-UNet,\nan efficient ViT-based segmentation network that reduces computational\ncomplexity while maintaining accuracy, making it ideal for resource-constrained\nmedical devices. EViT-UNet is built on a U-shaped architecture, comprising an\nencoder, decoder, bottleneck layer, and skip connections, combining\nconvolutional operations with self-attention mechanisms to optimize efficiency.\nExperimental results demonstrate that EViT-UNet achieves high accuracy in\nmedical image segmentation while significantly reducing computational\ncomplexity.",

Advanced embedding models are typically developed using large-scale\nmulti-task data and joint training across multiple tasks.

We introduce a novel method, Self Positioning, which\nefficiently searches for optimal model combinations within the interpolation\nspace of task vectors using stochastic gradient descent. Our experiments\ndemonstrate that Self Positioning significantly enhances multi-task performance\non the MTEB dataset, achieving an absolute improvement of 0.7 points.

However,\nexisting studies show attackers can easily reverse-engineer mobile DL models in\nApps to steal intellectual property or generate effective attacks. A recent\napproach, Model Obfuscation, has been proposed to defend against such reverse\nengineering by obfuscating DL model representations, such as weights and\ncomputational graphs, without affecting model performance. These existing model\nobfuscation methods use static methods to obfuscate the model representation,\nor they use half-dynamic methods but require users to restore the model\ninformation through additional input arguments. However, these static methods\nor half-dynamic methods cannot provide enough protection for on-device DL\nmodels. Attackers can use dynamic analysis to mine the sensitive information in\nthe inference codes as the correct model information and intermediate results\nmust be recovered at runtime for static and half-dynamic obfuscation methods.\nWe assess the vulnerability of the existing obfuscation strategies using an\ninstrumentation method and tool, DLModelExplorer, that dynamically extracts\ncorrect sensitive model information at runtime. Experiments show it achieves\nvery high attack performance. To defend against such attacks based on dynamic\ninstrumentation, we propose DynaMO, a Dynamic Model Obfuscation strategy\nsimilar to Homomorphic Encryption. The obfuscation and recovery process can be\ndone through simple linear transformation for the weights of randomly coupled\neligible operators, which is a fully dynamic obfuscation strategy.

In this paper, we introduce a novel statistical method to statistically\ntest FS reliability under DA, named SFS-DA (statistical FS-DA). The key\nstrength of SFS-DA lies in its ability to control the false positive rate (FPR)\nbelow a pre-specified level $\\alpha$ (e.g., 0.05) while maximizing the true\npositive rate. Compared to the literature on statistical FS, SFS-DA presents a\nunique challenge in addressing the effect of DA to ensure the validity of the\ninference on FS results. We overcome this challenge by leveraging the Selective\nInference (SI) framework. Specifically, by carefully examining the FS process\nunder DA whose operations can be characterized by linear and quadratic\ninequalities, we prove that achieving FPR control in SFS-DA is indeed possible.\nFurthermore, we enhance the true detection rate by introducing a more strategic\napproach. Experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets\nrobustly support our theoretical results, showcasing the superior performance\nof the proposed SFS-DA method.",

Currently, LLMs use inference methods utilizing\ngenerated multiple samples, which can be derived from Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR)\nDecoding. Previous studies have conducted empirical analyses to clarify the\nimprovements in generation performance achieved by MBR decoding and have\nreported various observations. However, the theoretical underpinnings of these\nfindings remain uncertain. To address this, we offer a new theoretical\ninterpretation of MBR decoding from the perspective of bias-diversity\ndecomposition. In this interpretation, the error in the quality estimation of\nhypotheses by MBR decoding is decomposed into two main factors: bias, which\nconsiders the closeness between the utility function and human evaluation, and\ndiversity, which represents the variability in the quality estimation of the\nutility function. The theoretical analysis reveals the difficulty of\nsimultaneously improving bias and diversity, confirming the validity of\nenhancing MBR decoding performance by increasing diversity. Furthermore, we\nreveal that diversity can explain one aspect of inference scaling laws that\ndescribe performance improvement by increasing sample size. Moreover,\nexperiments across multiple NLP tasks yielded results consistent with these\ntheoretical characteristics. Our code is available at\nhttps://github.com/naist-nlp/mbr-bias-diversity.",

The first one based on direct shifts is fast but uses only partial\nlatency information, while the other one makes use of the full information but\nrelies on the computationally costly simulated annealing. Both methods reach\ntheir limits and can become unreliable when successive global events are not\nsufficiently separated or even overlap.\n  New Method: Here we propose an iterative scheme that combines the advantages\nof the two original methods by using in each step as much of the latency\ninformation as possible and by employing a very fast extrapolation direct shift\nmethod instead of the much slower simulated annealing.\n  Results: We illustrate the effectiveness and the improved performance,\nmeasured in terms of the relative shift error, of the new iterative scheme not\nonly on simulated data with known ground truths but also on single-unit\nrecordings from two medial superior olive neurons of a gerbil.\n  Comparison with Existing Method(s): The iterative scheme outperforms the\nexisting approaches on both the simulated and the experimental data. Due to its\nlow computational demands, and in contrast to simulated annealing, it can also\nbe applied to very large datasets.\n  Conclusions: The new method generalizes and improves on the original method\nboth in terms of accuracy and speed.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in speech-language models have yielded significant\nimprovements in speech tokenization and synthesis. However, effectively mapping\nthe complex, multidimensional attributes of speech into discrete tokens remains\nchallenging. This process demands acoustic, semantic, and contextual\ninformation for precise speech representations. Existing speech representations\ngenerally fall into two categories: acoustic tokens from audio codecs and\nsemantic tokens from speech self-supervised learning models. Although recent\nefforts have unified acoustic and semantic tokens for improved performance,\nthey overlook the crucial role of contextual representation in comprehensive\nspeech modeling. Our empirical investigations reveal that the absence of\ncontextual representations results in elevated Word Error Rate (WER) and Word\nInformation Lost (WIL) scores in speech transcriptions. To address these\nlimitations, we propose two novel distillation approaches: (1) a language model\n(LM)-guided distillation method that incorporates contextual information, and\n(2) a combined LM and self-supervised speech model (SM)-guided distillation\ntechnique that effectively distills multimodal representations (acoustic,\nsemantic, and contextual) into a comprehensive speech tokenizer, termed\nDM-Codec. The DM-Codec architecture adopts a streamlined encoder-decoder\nframework with a Residual Vector Quantizer (RVQ) and incorporates the LM and SM\nduring the training process. Experiments show DM-Codec significantly\noutperforms state-of-the-art speech tokenization models, reducing WER by up to\n13.46%, WIL by 9.82%, and improving speech quality by 5.84% and intelligibility\nby 1.85% on the LibriSpeech benchmark dataset.

We propose a set of algorithms that by taking into\naccount the temporal variation of the cost aim to reduce the tracking error of\nthe time-varying minimizer of the problem. The main contribution of our work is\nthat our proposed algorithms only require the first-order derivatives of the\ncost function with respect to the decision variable. This approach\nsignificantly reduces computational cost compared to the existing algorithms,\nwhich use the inverse of the Hessian of the cost. Specifically, the proposed\nalgorithms reduce the computational cost from $O(n^3)$ to $O(n)$ per timestep,\nwhere $n$ is the size of the decision variable. Avoiding the inverse of the\nHessian also makes our algorithms applicable to non-convex optimization\nproblems. We refer to these algorithms as $O(n)$-algorithms.

To address the unique\nchallenges of accelerating end-to-end inference, we propose IANUS -- Integrated\nAccelerator based on NPU-PIM Unified Memory System.

In particular, IANUS\nemploys a unified main memory system where the PIM memory is used both for PIM\noperations and for NPU's main memory. The unified main memory system ensures\nthat memory capacity is efficiently utilized and the movement of shared data\nbetween NPU and PIM is minimized. However, it introduces new challenges since\nnormal memory accesses and PIM computations cannot be performed simultaneously.\nThus, we propose novel PIM Access Scheduling that manages normal memory\naccesses and PIM computations through workload mapping and scheduling across\nthe PIM and the NPU.

The CWDE is\nfundamental for understanding the life cycle of a star, and describes the\nrelationship between the density of the white dwarf and its distance from the\ncenter. Despite the rise in Scientific Machine Learning frameworks, very less\nattention has been paid to the systematic applications of the above SciML\npillars on astronomy based ODEs. Through robust modeling in the Julia\nprogramming language, we show that both Neural ODEs and UDEs can be used\neffectively for both prediction as well as forecasting of the CWDE. More\nimportantly, we introduce the forecasting breakdown point - the time at which\nforecasting fails for both Neural ODEs and UDEs. Through a robust\nhyperparameter optimization testing, we provide insights on the neural network\narchitecture, activation functions and optimizers which provide the best\nresults.

    "abstract": "Software Defined Networking (SDN) has evolved to revolutionize\nnext-generation networks, offering programmability for on-the-fly service\nprovisioning, primarily supported by the OpenFlow (OF) protocol. The limited\nstorage capacity of Ternary Content Addressable Memory (TCAM) for storing flow\ntables in OF switches introduces vulnerabilities, notably the Low-Rate Flow\nTable Overflow (LOFT) attacks. LOFT exploits the flow table's storage capacity\nby occupying a substantial amount of space with malicious flow, leading to a\ngradual degradation in the flow-forwarding performance of OF switches. To\nmitigate this threat, we propose FloRa, a machine learning-based solution\ndesigned for monitoring and detecting LOFT attacks in SDN. FloRa continuously\nexamines and determines the status of the flow table by closely examining the\nfeatures of the flow table entries. Upon detecting an attack FloRa promptly\nactivates the detection module. The module monitors flow properties, identifies\nmalicious flows, and blacklists them, facilitating their eviction from the flow\ntable. Incorporating novel features such as Packet Arrival Frequency, Content\nRelevance Score, and Possible Spoofed IP along with Cat Boost employed as the\nattack detection method. The proposed method reduces CPU overhead, memory\noverhead, and classification latency significantly and achieves a detection\naccuracy of 99.49%, which is more than the state-of-the-art methods to the best\nof our knowledge. This approach not only protects the integrity of the flow\ntables but also guarantees the uninterrupted flow of legitimate traffic.\nExperimental results indicate the effectiveness of FloRa in LOFT attack\ndetection, ensuring uninterrupted data forwarding and continuous availability\nof flow table resources in SDN.",

Consequently, prior methods either offer limited generative\ncapability or depend on a vast array of anomaly-specific models. We demonstrate\nthat U-Net's differentiated learning ability captures the distinct visual\ntraits of slightly-varied normal products and diverse anomalies, enabling us to\nconstruct a unified model for all tasks. Specifically, we first introduce an\nUnbalanced Abnormal (UA) Text Prompt, comprising one normal token and multiple\nanomaly tokens.

Numerical simulation is a\ncornerstone of micromagnetics research, relying on first-principle rules to\ncompute the dynamic evolution of micromagnetic systems based on the renowned\nLLG equation, named after Landau, Lifshitz, and Gilbert. However, simulations\nare often hindered by their slow speed.

In this paper, we introduce NeuralMAG,\na deep learning approach to micromagnetic simulation. Our approach follows the\nLLG iterative framework but accelerates demagnetizing field computation through\nthe employment of a U-shaped neural network (Unet). The Unet architecture\ncomprises an encoder that extracts aggregated spins at various scales and\nlearns the local interaction at each scale, followed by a decoder that\naccumulates the local interactions at different scales to approximate the\nglobal convolution. This divide-and-accumulate scheme achieves a time\ncomplexity of O(N), significantly enhancing the speed and feasibility of\nlarge-scale simulations. Unlike existing neural methods, NeuralMAG concentrates\non the core computation rather than an end-to-end approximation for a specific\ntask, making it inherently generalizable.

Additionally, to properly price policies and\ncalculate bonuses the relative riskiness of individual business units must be\nwell understood. Certainly, Insurers and Financiers are interested in the\nproperties of the sums of the risks they are exposed to and the dependence of\nrisks therein. Realistic risk models however must account for a variety of\nphenomena: ill-defined moments, lack of elliptical dependence structures,\nexcess kurtosis and highly heterogeneous marginals. Equally important is the\nconcern over industry-wide systematic risks that can affect multiple business\nlines at once. Many techniques of varying sophistication have been developed\nwith all or some of these problems in mind. We propose a modification to the\nclassical individual risk model that allows us to model company-wide losses via\nthe class of Multivariate Stable Distributions. Stable Distributions\nincorporate many of the unpleasant features required for a realistic risk model\nwhile maintaining tractable aggregation and dependence results.

To address this, we propose D-SarcNet, a dual-stream\ndeep learning framework that takes fluorescent hiPSC-CM single-cell images as\ninput and outputs the stage of the sarcomere structural organization on a scale\nfrom 1.0 to 5.0.

(2) Frozen alignment, where\nbrain signal embeddings are mapped to corresponding Mel spectrogram embeddings\nin a frozen latent space, effectively filtering session-specific noise through\nvector-quantized reconstruction, yielding a 3.65% improvement in BLEU-4 score.\n(3) Constrained decoding fine-tuning, which leverages the pre-trained Whisper\nmodel for audio-to-text translation, balancing signal adaptation with knowledge\npreservation, and achieving 74%-89% decoding BLEU scores without excessive\nreliance on teacher forcing. BrainECHO demonstrates robustness across sentence,\nsession, and subject-independent conditions, passing Gaussian noise tests and\nshowcasing its potential for enhancing language-based brain-computer\ninterfaces.",

The elimination of\nfossil fuel fired systems, and their replacement with intermittent renewable\nsources and other electric equipment will require better load management\ntechniques to ensure a reliable grid. One strategy for maintaining electric\ngrid reliability utilizes peak shaving. Buildings, accounting for 40% of energy\nuse in the United States, can account for an even higher percentage of energy\nduring peak periods driven by high air conditioning loads during the summer,\nespecially in hotter climes such as Austin, Texas. Many previous studies have\nmodeled the effectiveness of building HVAC demand response methods such as\ntemperature setpoint manipulation, pre-cooling, ventilation scheduling, and\nthermal energy storage. Thermal storage systems, due to their larger energy\ncapacities, have been shown to be most promising for peak shaving. However,\nthere is a lack of work integrating chilled water energy storage models with\nvalidated microgrid-district energy system models to fully capture the dynamics\nof the proposed strategies.

The backdoor\nattack is a method that implants vulnerabilities in a target model, which can\nbe activated through a trigger. In this work, we innovatively prevent the abuse\nof image content modification by implanting the backdoor into image-editing\nmodels. Once the protected sensitive content on an image is modified by an\nediting model, the backdoor will be triggered, making the editing fail. Unlike\ntraditional backdoor attacks that use data poisoning, to enable protection on\nindividual images and eliminate the need for model training, we developed the\nfirst framework for run-time backdoor implantation, which is both time- and\nresource- efficient. We generate imperceptible perturbations on the images to\ninject the backdoor and define the protected area as the only backdoor trigger.\nEditing other unprotected insensitive areas will not trigger the backdoor,\nwhich minimizes the negative impact on legal image modifications. Evaluations\nwith state-of-the-art image editing models show that our protective method can\nincrease the CLIP-FID of generated images from 12.72 to 39.91, or reduce the\nSSIM from 0.503 to 0.167 when subjected to malicious editing. At the same time,\nour method exhibits minimal impact on benign editing, which demonstrates the\nefficacy of our proposed framework.

For example, Fundus\nFluorescein Angiography (FFA) uniquely provides detailed insights into retinal\nvascular dynamics and pathology, surpassing Color Fundus Photographs (CFP) in\ndetecting microvascular abnormalities and perfusion status. However, the\nconventional invasive FFA involves discomfort and risks due to fluorescein dye\ninjection, and it is meaningful but challenging to synthesize FFA images from\nnon-invasive CFP. Previous studies primarily focused on FFA synthesis in a\nsingle disease category. In this work, we explore FFA synthesis in multiple\ndiseases by devising a Diffusion-guided generative adversarial network, which\nintroduces an adaptive and dynamic diffusion forward process into the\ndiscriminator and adds a category-aware representation enhancer. Moreover, to\nfacilitate this research, we collect the first multi-disease CFP and FFA paired\ndataset, named the Multi-disease Paired Ocular Synthesis (MPOS) dataset, with\nfour different fundus diseases. Experimental results show that our FFA\nsynthesis network can generate better FFA images compared to state-of-the-art\nmethods. Furthermore, we introduce a paired-modal diagnostic network to\nvalidate the effectiveness of synthetic FFA images in the diagnosis of multiple\nfundus diseases, and the results show that our synthesized FFA images with the\nreal CFP images have higher diagnosis accuracy than that of the compared FFA\nsynthesizing methods. Our research bridges the gap between non-invasive imaging\nand FFA, thereby offering promising prospects to enhance ophthalmic diagnosis\nand patient care, with a focus on reducing harm to patients through\nnon-invasive procedures.

    "abstract": "Superhydrophobic surfaces (SHS) are textured hydrophobic surfaces which have\nthe ability to trap air pockets when immersed in water. This can result in\nsignificant drag reduction, due to substantially lower viscosity of air\nresulting in substantial effective slip velocity at the interface. Past studies\nof both laminar and turbulent flows model this slip velocity in terms of a\nhomogenized Navier slip boundary condition with a slip length relating the wall\nslip velocity to the wall-normal velocity gradient. In this work, we seek to\nunderstand the effects of superhydrophobic surfaces in the context of mean\nscalar and momentum mixing. We use the macroscopic forcing method (Mani and\nPark, 2021) to compute the generalized eddy viscosity and slip length operators\nof a turbulent channel over SHS, implemented as both a pattern-resolved\nboundary condition and homogenized slip length boundary condition, for several\npattern sizes and geometries. We present key differences in the mixing behavior\nof both boundary conditions through quantification of their near-wall eddy\nviscosity. Analysis of transport in turbulent flow over pattern-resolved\nsurfaces reveals substantial nonlocality in the measured homogenized slip\nlength for both scalar and momentum mixing when the Reynolds and Peclet numbers\nbased on pattern size are finite. We present several metrics to quantify this\nnonlocality and observe possible trends relating to Reynolds number, texture\nsize, and pattern geometry. The importance of nonlocality in the slip length\noperator and in the eddy diffusivity operator is demonstrated by examining the\nimpact on Reynolds-averaged solutions for the mean scalar and velocity fields.",

Oceanographers simulate ocean current circulation along the\ncoasts to develop early warning systems that save lives and prevent loss and\ndamage to property from coastal hazards. Traditionally, such simulations are\nconducted using coastal ocean circulation models such as the Regional Ocean\nModeling System (ROMS), which usually runs on an HPC cluster with multiple CPU\ncores. However, the process is time-consuming and energy expensive. While\ncoarse-grained ROMS simulations offer faster alternatives, they sacrifice\ndetail and accuracy, particularly in complex coastal environments. Recent\nadvances in deep learning and GPU architecture have enabled the development of\nfaster AI (neural network) surrogates. This paper introduces an AI surrogate\nbased on a 4D Swin Transformer to simulate coastal tidal wave propagation in an\nestuary for both hindcast and forecast (up to 12 days). Our approach not only\naccelerates simulations but also incorporates a physics-based constraint to\ndetect and correct inaccurate results, ensuring reliability while minimizing\nmanual intervention. We develop a fully GPU-accelerated workflow, optimizing\nthe model training and inference pipeline on NVIDIA DGX-2 A100 GPUs. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that our AI surrogate reduces the time cost of 12-day\nforecasting of traditional ROMS simulations from 9,908 seconds (on 512 CPU\ncores) to 22 seconds (on one A100 GPU), achieving over 450$\\times$ speedup\nwhile maintaining high-quality simulation results.

Typically, generative models learn a trajectory between the starting\nnoise distribution and the target data distribution. Recently Liu et al.\n(2023b) proposed Rectified Flow (RF), a generative model that aims to learn\nstraight flow trajectories from noise to data using a sequence of convex\noptimization problems with close ties to optimal transport. If the trajectory\nis curved, one must use many Euler discretization steps or novel strategies,\nsuch as exponential integrators, to achieve a satisfactory generation quality.\nIn contrast, RF has been shown to theoretically straighten the trajectory\nthrough successive rectifications, reducing the number of function evaluations\n(NFEs) while sampling. It has also been shown empirically that RF may improve\nthe straightness in two rectifications if one can solve the underlying\noptimization problem within a sufficiently small error. In this paper, we make\ntwo contributions. First, we provide a theoretical analysis of the Wasserstein\ndistance between the sampling distribution of RF and the target distribution.\nOur error rate is characterized by the number of discretization steps and a\nnovel formulation of straightness stronger than that in the original work.\nSecondly, we present general conditions guaranteeing uniqueness and\nstraightness of 1-RF, which is in line with previous empirical findings. As a\nbyproduct of our analysis, we show that, in one dimension, RF started at the\nstandard Gaussian distribution yields the Monge map. Additionally, we also\npresent empirical results on both simulated and real datasets to validate our\ntheoretical findings. The code is available at\nhttps://github.com/bansal-vansh/rectified-flow.",

We propose metrics to evaluate the quality and spatial adherence of the\ngenerated spatial audio. Finally, we assess the model performance in terms of\ngeneration quality and spatial conformance, comparing the two proposed modes:\n``descriptive\", which uses spatial text prompts) and ``parametric\", which uses\nnon-spatial text prompts and spatial parameters. Our evaluations demonstrate\npromising results that are consistent with the user conditions and reflect\nreliable spatial fidelity.",

    "abstract": "Multi-modal fusion has played a vital role in multi-modal scene\nunderstanding. Most existing methods focus on cross-modal fusion involving two\nmodalities, often overlooking more complex multi-modal fusion, which is\nessential for real-world applications like autonomous driving, where visible,\ndepth, event, LiDAR, etc., are used. Besides, few attempts for multi-modal\nfusion, \\emph{e.g.}, simple concatenation, cross-modal attention, and token\nselection, cannot well dig into the intrinsic shared and specific details of\nmultiple modalities. To tackle the challenge, in this paper, we propose a\nPart-Whole Relational Fusion (PWRF) framework. For the first time, this\nframework treats multi-modal fusion as part-whole relational fusion. It routes\nmultiple individual part-level modalities to a fused whole-level modality using\nthe part-whole relational routing ability of Capsule Networks (CapsNets).\nThrough this part-whole routing, our PWRF generates modal-shared and\nmodal-specific semantics from the whole-level modal capsules and the routing\ncoefficients, respectively. On top of that, modal-shared and modal-specific\ndetails can be employed to solve the issue of multi-modal scene understanding,\nincluding synthetic multi-modal segmentation and visible-depth-thermal salient\nobject detection in this paper. Experiments on several datasets demonstrate the\nsuperiority of the proposed PWRF framework for multi-modal scene understanding.\nThe source code has been released on https://github.com/liuyi1989/PWRF.",

Multi-facility workflows\npresent challenges in data movement, curation, and overcoming institutional\nsilos, while diverse hardware architectures require integrating workflow\nconsiderations into early system design and developing standardized resource\nmanagement tools. The summit emphasized improving user experience in workflow\nsystems and ensuring FAIR workflows to enhance collaboration and accelerate\nscientific discovery. Key recommendations include developing standardized\nmetrics for time-sensitive workflows, creating frameworks for cloud-HPC\nintegration, implementing distributed-by-design workflow modeling, establishing\nmulti-facility authentication protocols, and accelerating AI integration in HPC\nworkflow management.

Inverse problems are often\nill-posed, meaning small data changes can lead to large solution variations. To\nmitigate this, regularization techniques like Tikhonov's are used to stabilize\nsolutions. This study compares regularization methods applied to gravimetric\ninversion, including Smoothness Constraints, Total Variation, Discrete Cosine\nTransform (DCT), and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) using Daubechies D4\nwavelets. Optimization, particularly with Genetic Algorithms (GA), is used to\nfind prism depths that best match observed anomalies. GA, inspired by natural\nselection, selects the best solutions to minimize the objective function. The\nresults, evaluated through fit metrics and error analysis, show the\neffectiveness of all regularization methods and GA, with the Smoothness\nconstraint performing best in synthetic models.

By means of a ``thought experiment'' via\nseveral clean numerical experiments based on the Navier-Stokes equations for\ntwo-dimensional turbulent Kolmogorov flow, we reveal a new phenomenon, which we\ncall the ``noise-expansion cascade'' whereby all micro-level\nnoises/disturbances at different orders of magnitudes in the initial condition\nof Navier-Stokes equations enlarge consistently, say, one by one like an\ninverse cascade, to macro-level.

Besides, the noise-expansion cascade closely connects randomness of\nmicro-level noise/disturbance and macro-level disorder of turbulence, thus\nrevealing an origin of randomness of turbulence. This also highly suggests that\nunavoidable thermal fluctuations must be considered when simulating turbulence,\neven if such fluctuations are several orders of magnitudes smaller than other\nexternal environmental disturbances.

Current implementations of mass loss for hot, massive stars in\nstellar evolution models include a sharp increase in mass loss when blue\nsupergiants become cooler than Teff 20-22kK. This drastic mass-loss jump has\nbeen motivated by the potential presence of a so-called bistability ionisation\neffect, which may occur for line-driven winds in this temperature region due to\nrecombination of important line-driving ions. Aims. We perform quantitative\nspectroscopy using UV (ULLYSES program) and optical (XShootU collaboration)\ndata for 17 OB-supergiant stars in the LMC (covering the range Teff 14-32kK),\nderiving absolute constraints on global stellar, wind, and clumping parameters.\nWe examine whether there are any empirical signs of a mass-loss jump in the\ninvestigated region, and we study the clumped nature of the wind. Methods. We\nuse a combination of the model atmosphere code fastwind and the genetic\nalgorithm code Kiwi-GA to fit synthetic spectra of a multitude of diagnostic\nspectral lines in the optical and UV. Results. We find no signs of any upward\nmass loss jump anywhere in the examined region. Standard theoretical comparison\nmodels, which include a strong bistability jump thus severely over predict the\nempirical mass-loss rates on the cool side of the predicted jump. Additionally,\nwe find that on average about 40% of the total wind mass seems to reside in the\ndiluted medium in between dense clumps. Conclusions. Our derived mass-loss\nrates suggest that for applications like stellar evolution one should not\ninclude a drastic bistability jump in mass loss for stars in the temperature\nand luminosity region investigated here. The derived high values of interclump\ndensity further suggest that the common assumption of an effectively void\ninterclump medium (applied in the vast majority of spectroscopic studies of hot\nstar winds) is not generally valid in this parameter regime.",

    "abstract": "As electrical generation becomes more distributed and volatile, and loads\nbecome more uncertain, controllability of distributed energy resources (DERs),\nregardless of their ownership status, will be necessary for grid reliability.\nGrid operators lack direct control over end-users' grid interactions, such as\nenergy usage, but incentives can influence behavior -- for example, an end-user\nthat receives a grid-driven incentive may adjust their consumption or expose\nrelevant control variables in response. A key challenge in studying such\nincentives is the lack of data about human behavior, which usually motivates\nstrong assumptions, such as distributional assumptions on compliance or\nrational utility-maximization. In this paper, we propose a general incentive\nmechanism in the form of a constrained optimization problem -- our approach is\ndistinguished from prior work by modeling human behavior (e.g., reactions to an\nincentive) as an arbitrary unknown function. We propose feedback-based\noptimization algorithms to solve this problem that each leverage different\namounts of information and/or measurements. We show that each converges to an\nasymptotically stable incentive with (near)-optimality guarantees given mild\nassumptions on the problem. Finally, we evaluate our proposed techniques in\nvoltage regulation simulations on standard test beds. We test a variety of\nsettings, including those that break assumptions required for theoretical\nconvergence (e.g., convexity, smoothness) to capture realistic settings. In\nthis evaluation, our proposed algorithms are able to find near-optimal\nincentives even when the reaction to an incentive is modeled by a theoretically\ndifficult (yet realistic) function.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we deal with Delone sets and their rectifiability under\ndifferent classes of regularity. By pursuing techniques developed by Rivi\\`ere\nand Ye, and Aliste-Prieto, Coronel and Gambaudo, we give sufficient conditions\nfor a specific Delone set to be equivalent to the standard lattice by\nbijections having regularity in between bi-Lipschitz and\nbi-H\\\"older-homogeneous. From this criterion, we extend a result of McMullen by\nshowing that, for any dimension $d\\geq 1$, there exists a threshold of moduli\nof continuity $\\mathcal{M}_d$, including the class of the H\\\"{o}lder ones, such\nthat for every $\\omega\\in\\mathcal{M}_d$, any two Delone sets within a certain\nclass in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ cannot be distinguished under bi-$\\omega$-equivalence.\nAlso, we extend a result due to Aliste, Coronel, and Gambaudo, which\nestablishes that every linearly repetitive Delone set in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ is\nrectifiable by extending it to a broader class of repetitive behaviors.\nMoreover, we show that for the modulus of continuity\n$\\omega(t)=t(\\log(1/t))^{1/d}$, every $\\omega$-repetitive Delone set in\n$\\mathbb{R}^d$ is equivalent to the standard lattice by a\nbi-$\\omega$-homogeneous map.

    "abstract": "Predicting gray swan weather extremes, which are possible but so rare that\nthey are absent from the training dataset, is a major concern for AI weather\nmodels and long-term climate emulators. An important open question is whether\nAI models can extrapolate from weaker weather events present in the training\nset to stronger, unseen weather extremes. To test this, we train independent\nversions of the AI model FourCastNet on the 1979-2015 ERA5 dataset with all\ndata, or with Category 3-5 tropical cyclones (TCs) removed, either globally or\nonly over the North Atlantic or Western Pacific basin. We then test these\nversions of FourCastNet on 2018-2023 Category 5 TCs (gray swans). All versions\nyield similar accuracy for global weather, but the one trained without Category\n3-5 TCs cannot accurately forecast Category 5 TCs, indicating that these models\ncannot extrapolate from weaker storms. The versions trained without Category\n3-5 TCs in one basin show some skill forecasting Category 5 TCs in that basin,\nsuggesting that FourCastNet can generalize across tropical basins. This is\nencouraging and surprising because regional information is implicitly encoded\nin inputs. Given that current state-of-the-art AI weather and climate models\nhave similar learning strategies, we expect our findings to apply to other\nmodels. Other types of weather extremes need to be similarly investigated. Our\nwork demonstrates that novel learning strategies are needed for AI models to\nreliably provide early warning or estimated statistics for the rarest, most\nimpactful TCs, and, possibly, other weather extremes.",

The WGM resonator provides strong optical feedback for enhancing the\nlight-mattering interaction and also provides a biomimetic curvature interface\nto investigate the membrane dynamics.

    "abstract": "Thermodynamic cost of communication is a major factor in the thermodynamic\ncost of real-world computers, both biological and digital. Despite its\nimportance, the fundamental principles underlying this cost remain poorly\nunderstood. This paper makes two major contributions to addressing this gap.\nFirst, we derive a universal relationship between information transmission rate\nand minimal entropy production (EP) by focusing on the mismatch cost (MMC)\ncomponent of thermodynamic cost. The resulting relationship holds independently\nof the underlying physical dynamics, making it broadly applicable. We discuss\nthe implications of the derived minimal communication cost for work extraction\nin measurement-and-feedback protocols, and through examples involving binary\nchannels, we show that the relationship between transmission rate and minimal\nthermodynamic cost can exhibit diminishing returns in certain scenarios.\nSecond, we extend this thermodynamic analysis to the computational front and\nback ends critical to communication-namely, encoding and decoding to reduce\nerrors in noisy transmission. Using the framework of periodic machines, we\nestablish strictly positive minimal costs for implementing linear\nerror-correcting codes. We compare these costs with end-to-end error rates,\nhighlighting trade-offs between thermodynamic cost and decoding accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Score identity Distillation (SiD) is a data-free method that has achieved\nSOTA performance in image generation by leveraging only a pretrained diffusion\nmodel, without requiring any training data. However, its ultimate performance\nis constrained by how accurate the pretrained model captures the true data\nscores at different stages of the diffusion process. In this paper, we\nintroduce SiDA (SiD with Adversarial Loss), which not only enhances generation\nquality but also improves distillation efficiency by incorporating real images\nand adversarial loss. SiDA utilizes the encoder from the generator's score\nnetwork as a discriminator, allowing it to distinguish between real images and\nthose generated by SiD. The adversarial loss is batch-normalized within each\nGPU and then combined with the original SiD loss. This integration effectively\nincorporates the average \"fakeness\" per GPU batch into the pixel-based SiD\nloss, enabling SiDA to distill a single-step generator. SiDA converges\nsignificantly faster than its predecessor when distilled from scratch, and\nswiftly improves upon the original model's performance during fine-tuning from\na pre-distilled SiD generator. This one-step adversarial distillation method\nestablishes new benchmarks in generation performance when distilling EDM\ndiffusion models, achieving FID scores of 1.110 on ImageNet 64x64. When\ndistilling EDM2 models trained on ImageNet 512x512, our SiDA method surpasses\neven the largest teacher model, EDM2-XXL, which achieved an FID of 1.81 using\nclassifier-free guidance (CFG) and 63 generation steps. In contrast, SiDA\nachieves FID scores of 2.156 for size XS, 1.669 for S, 1.488 for M, 1.413 for\nL, 1.379 for XL, and 1.366 for XXL, all without CFG and in a single generation\nstep. These results highlight substantial improvements across all model sizes.\nOur code is available at https://github.com/mingyuanzhou/SiD/tree/sida.",

    "abstract": "High order exponential integrators require computing linear combination of\nexponential like $\\varphi$-functions of large matrices $A$ times a vector $v$.\nKrylov projection methods are the most general and remain an efficient choice\nfor computing the matrix-function-vector-product evaluation when the matrix is\n$A$ is large and unable to be explicitly stored, or when obtaining information\nabout the spectrum is expensive. The Krylov approximation relies on the\nGram-Schmidt (GS) orthogonalization procedure to produce the orthonormal basis\n$V_m$. In parallel, GS orthogonalization requires \\textit{global\nsynchronizations} for inner products and vector normalization in the\northogonalization process. Reducing the amount of global synchronizations is of\nparamount importance for the efficiency of a numerical algorithm in a massively\nparallel setting. We improve the parallel strong scaling properties of\nexponential integrators by addressing the underlying bottleneck in the linear\nalgebra using low-synchronization GS methods. The resulting orthogonalization\nalgorithms have an accuracy comparable to modified Gram-Schmidt yet are better\nsuited for distributed architecture, as only one global communication is\nrequired per orthogonalization-step. We present geophysics-based numerical\nexperiments and standard examples routinely used to test stiff time\nintegrators, which validate that reducing global communication leads to better\nparallel scalability and reduced time-to-solution for exponential integrators.",

    "abstract": "We present a scalable approach to solve a class of elliptic partial\ndifferential equation (PDE)-constrained optimization problems with bound\nconstraints. This approach utilizes a robust full-space interior-point\n(IP)-Gauss-Newton optimization method. To cope with the poorly-conditioned\nIP-Gauss-Newton saddle-point linear systems that need to be solved, once per\noptimization step, we propose two spectrally related preconditioners. These\npreconditioners leverage the limited informativeness of data in regularized\nPDE-constrained optimization problems. A block Gauss-Seidel preconditioner is\nproposed for the GMRES-based solution of the IP-Gauss-Newton linear systems. It\nis shown, for a large-class of PDE- and bound-constrained optimization\nproblems, that the spectrum of the block Gauss-Seidel preconditioned\nIP-Gauss-Newton matrix is asymptotically independent of discretization and is\nnot impacted by the ill-conditioning that notoriously plagues interior-point\nmethods. We propose a regularization and log-barrier Hessian preconditioner for\nthe preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG)-based solution of the related\nIP-Gauss-Newton-Schur complement linear systems. The scalability of the\napproach is demonstrated on an example problem with bound and nonlinear\nelliptic PDE constraints. The numerical solution of the optimization problem is\nshown to require a discretization independent number of IP-Gauss-Newton linear\nsolves. Furthermore, the linear systems are solved in a discretization and IP\nill-conditioning independent number of preconditioned Krylov subspace\niterations. The parallel scalability of preconditioner and linear system matrix\napplies, achieved with algebraic multigrid based solvers, and the\naforementioned algorithmic scalability permits a parallel scalable means to\ncompute solutions of a large class of PDE- and bound-constrained problems.",

    "abstract": "Multi-agent systems are trained to maximize shared cost objectives, which\ntypically reflect system-level efficiency. However, in the resource-constrained\nenvironments of mobility and transportation systems, efficiency may be achieved\nat the expense of fairness -- certain agents may incur significantly greater\ncosts or lower rewards compared to others. Tasks could be distributed\ninequitably, leading to some agents receiving an unfair advantage while others\nincur disproportionately high costs. It is important to consider the tradeoffs\nbetween efficiency and fairness. We consider the problem of fair multi-agent\nnavigation for a group of decentralized agents using multi-agent reinforcement\nlearning (MARL). We consider the reciprocal of the coefficient of variation of\nthe distances traveled by different agents as a measure of fairness and\ninvestigate whether agents can learn to be fair without significantly\nsacrificing efficiency (i.e., increasing the total distance traveled). We find\nthat by training agents using min-max fair distance goal assignments along with\na reward term that incentivizes fairness as they move towards their goals, the\nagents (1) learn a fair assignment of goals and (2) achieve almost perfect goal\ncoverage in navigation scenarios using only local observations. For goal\ncoverage scenarios, we find that, on average, our model yields a 14%\nimprovement in efficiency and a 5% improvement in fairness over a baseline\ntrained using random assignments. Furthermore, an average of 21% improvement in\nfairness can be achieved compared to a model trained on optimally efficient\nassignments; this increase in fairness comes at the expense of only a 7%\ndecrease in efficiency. Finally, we extend our method to environments in which\nagents must complete coverage tasks in prescribed formations and show that it\nis possible to do so without tailoring the models to specific formation shapes.",

    "abstract": "Dark states, which are incapable of absorbing and emitting light, have been\nwidely applied in multiple disciplines of physics. However, the existence of\ndark states relies on certain strict constraints on the system. For instance,\nin the fundamental {\\Lambda} system, a perturbation breaking the degeneracy\nbetween two energy levels may destroy the destructive interference and demolish\nthe dark state. Here, we show that non-Hermiticity can be exploited as a\nconstructive means to restore a dark state. By compensating for the undesired\nperturbations, non-Hermiticity produces unidirectional couplings such that the\ndark state remains decoupled from the rest of the system. Implementing this\nscheme in many-body systems, flat bands and edge states can be recovered by\nlosses and gains. Further taking into account interactions, a range of novel\nquantum phases could arise in such non-Hermitian systems.",
