    "abstract": "LLMs have been celebrated for their potential to help multilingual scientists\npublish their research. Rather than interpret LLMs as a solution, we\nhypothesize their adoption can be an indicator of existing linguistic exclusion\nin scientific writing. Using the case study of ICLR, an influential,\ninternational computer science conference, we examine how peer reviewers\ncritique writing clarity. Analyzing almost 80,000 peer reviews, we find\nsignificant bias against authors associated with institutions in countries\nwhere English is less widely spoken. We see only a muted shift in the\nexpression of this bias after the introduction of ChatGPT in late 2022. To\ninvestigate this unexpectedly minor change, we conduct interviews with 14\nconference participants from across five continents. Peer reviewers describe\nassociating certain features of writing with people of certain language\nbackgrounds, and such groups in turn with the quality of scientific work. While\nChatGPT masks some signs of language background, reviewers explain that they\nnow use ChatGPT \"style\" and non-linguistic features as indicators of author\ndemographics. Authors, aware of this development, described the ongoing need to\nremove features which could expose their \"non-native\" status to reviewers. Our\nfindings offer insight into the role of ChatGPT in the reproduction of\nscholarly language ideologies which conflate producers of \"good English\" with\nproducers of \"good science.\"",

It provides a\nflexible and efficient approach to modeling front propagation problems, optimal\ncontrol problems, and stochastic Hamilton-Jacobi Bellman equations. The\nframework integrates numerical methods for hyperbolic PDEs with operator\nsplitting techniques and implements implicit methods for second-order\nderivative terms, ensuring convergence to viscosity solutions while achieving\nglobal rather than local optimization. Built with a high-performance C++ core,\nCASL-HJX efficiently handles mixed-order derivative systems with time-varying\ndynamics, making it suitable for real-world applications across multiple\ndomains. We demonstrate the solver's versatility through tutorial examples\ncovering various PDEs and through applications in neuroscience, where it\nenables the design of energy-efficient controllers for regulating neural\npopulations to mitigate pathological synchrony. While our examples focus on\nthese applications, the mathematical foundation of the solver makes it\napplicable to problems in finance, engineering, and machine learning. The\nmodular architecture allows researchers to define computational domains,\nconfigure problems, and execute simulations with high numerical accuracy.\nCASL-HJX bridges the gap between deterministic control methods and stochastic\nmodels, providing a robust tool for managing uncertainty in complex dynamical\nsystems.",

    "abstract": "Multi-material decomposition (MMD) enables quantitative reconstruction of\ntissue compositions in the human body, supporting a wide range of clinical\napplications. However, traditional MMD typically requires spectral CT scanners\nand pre-measured X-ray energy spectra, significantly limiting clinical\napplicability. To this end, various methods have been developed to perform MMD\nusing conventional (i.e., single-energy, SE) CT systems, commonly referred to\nas SEMMD. Despite promising progress, most SEMMD methods follow a two-step\nimage decomposition pipeline, which first reconstructs monochromatic CT images\nusing algorithms such as FBP, and then performs decomposition on these images.\nThe initial reconstruction step, however, neglects the energy-dependent\nattenuation of human tissues, introducing severe nonlinear beam hardening\nartifacts and noise into the subsequent decomposition. This paper proposes\nJSover, a fundamentally reformulated one-step SEMMD framework that jointly\nreconstructs multi-material compositions and estimates the energy spectrum\ndirectly from SECT projections. By explicitly incorporating physics-informed\nspectral priors into the SEMMD process, JSover accurately simulates a virtual\nspectral CT system from SE acquisitions, thereby improving the reliability and\naccuracy of decomposition. Furthermore, we introduce implicit neural\nrepresentation (INR) as an unsupervised deep learning solver for representing\nthe underlying material maps. The inductive bias of INR toward continuous image\npatterns constrains the solution space and further enhances estimation quality.\nExtensive experiments on both simulated and real CT datasets show that JSover\noutperforms state-of-the-art SEMMD methods in accuracy and computational\nefficiency.",

Currently, there is\nno known study of label agreement between drone and satellite imagery for\nbuilding damage assessment. The only prior work that could be used to infer if\nsuch imagery-derived labels agree is limited by differing damage label schemas,\nmisaligned building locations, and low data quantities.

The analysis finds satellite-derived labels significantly under-report\ndamage by at least 20.43% compared to drone-derived labels (p<1.2x10^-117), and\nsatellite- and drone-derived labels represent significantly different\ndistributions (p<5.1x10^-175).

    "abstract": "Perfusion imaging is extensively utilized to assess hemodynamic status and\ntissue perfusion in various organs. Computed tomography perfusion (CTP) imaging\nplays a key role in the early assessment and planning of stroke treatment.\nWhile CTP provides essential perfusion parameters to identify abnormal blood\nflow in the brain, the use of contrast agents in CTP can lead to allergic\nreactions and adverse side effects, along with costing USD 4.9 billion\nworldwide in 2022. To address these challenges, we propose a novel deep\nlearning framework called Multitask Automated Generation of Intermodal CT\nperfusion maps (MAGIC). This framework combines generative artificial\nintelligence and physiological information to map non-contrast computed\ntomography (CT) imaging to multiple contrast-free CTP imaging maps. We\ndemonstrate enhanced image fidelity by incorporating physiological\ncharacteristics into the loss terms. Our network was trained and validated\nusing CT image data from patients referred for stroke at UF Health and\ndemonstrated robustness to abnormalities in brain perfusion activity. A\ndouble-blinded study was conducted involving seven experienced\nneuroradiologists and vascular neurologists. This study validated MAGIC's\nvisual quality and diagnostic accuracy showing favorable performance compared\nto clinical perfusion imaging with intravenous contrast injection. Overall,\nMAGIC holds great promise in revolutionizing healthcare by offering\ncontrast-free, cost-effective, and rapid perfusion imaging.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose an analytical method to compute the collateral\nliquidation probability in decentralized finance (DeFi) stablecoin\nsingle-collateral lending. Our approach models the collateral exchange rate as\na zero-drift geometric Brownian motion, converts it into a regular zero-drift\nBrownian motion, and employs the reflection principle to derive the liquidation\nprobability. Unlike most existing methods that rely on computationally\nintensive simulations such as Monte Carlo, our formula provides a lightweight,\nexact solution.

    "abstract": "Sparse attention is a core building block in many leading neural network\nmodels, from graph-structured learning to sparse sequence modeling. It can be\ndecomposed into a sequence of three sparse matrix operations (3S): sampled\ndense-dense matrix multiplication (SDDMM), softmax normalization, and sparse\nmatrix multiplication (SpMM). Efficiently executing the 3S computational\npattern on modern GPUs remains challenging due to (a) the mismatch between\nunstructured sparsity and tensor cores optimized for dense operations, and (b)\nthe high cost of data movement. Previous works have optimized these sparse\noperations individually or addressed one of these challenges. This paper\nintroduces Fused3S, the first fused 3S algorithm that jointly maximizes tensor\ncore utilization and minimizes data movement. Across real-world graph datasets,\nFused3S achieves $1.6- 16.3\\times$ and $1.5-14\\times$ speedup over\nstate-of-the-art on H100 and A30 GPUs. Furthermore, integrating Fused3S into\nGraph Transformer inference accelerates end-to-end performance by\n$1.05-5.36\\times$, consistently outperforming all 3S baselines across diverse\ndatasets (single and batched graphs) and GPU architectures.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel gradient-informed slicing method for functionally\ngraded additive manufacturing (FGM) that overcomes the limitations of\nconventional toolpath planning approaches, which struggle to produce truly\ncontinuous gradients. By integrating multi-material gradients into the toolpath\ngeneration process, our method enables the fabrication of FGMs with complex\ngradients that vary seamlessly in any direction. We leverage OpenVCAD's\nimplicit representation of geometry and material fields to directly extract\niso-contours, enabling accurate, controlled gradient toolpaths. Two novel\nstrategies are introduced to integrate these gradients into the toolpath\nplanning process. The first strategy maintains traditional perimeter, skin, and\ninfill structures subdivided by mixture ratios, with automated 'zippering' to\nmitigate stress concentrations. The second strategy fills iso-contoured regions\ndensely, printing directly against gradients to eliminate purging and reduce\nwaste. Both strategies accommodate gradually changing printing parameters, such\nas mixed filament ratios, toolhead switching, and variable nozzle temperatures\nfor foaming materials. This capability allows for controlled variation of\ncomposition, density, and other properties within a single build, expanding the\ndesign space for functionally graded parts. Experimental results demonstrate\nthe fabrication of high-quality FGMs with complex, multi-axis gradients,\nhighlighting the versatility of our method. We showcase the successful\nimplementation of both strategies on a range of geometries and material\ncombinations, demonstrating the potential of our approach to produce intricate\nand functional FGMs. This work provides a robust, open-source, and automated\nframework for designing and fabricating advanced FGMs, accelerating research in\nmulti-material additive manufacturing.",

In\nthis article, we propose a multi-modal AI model based on transfer learning\n(TL), which combines two state-of-the-art architectures, Xception and GMRNN,\nfor wound classification. The multi-modal network is developed by concatenating\nthe features extracted by a transfer learning algorithm and location features\nto classify the wound types of diabetic, pressure, surgical, and venous ulcers.\nThe proposed method is comprehensively compared with deep neural networks (DNN)\nfor medical image analysis. The experimental results demonstrate a notable\nwound-class classifications (containing only diabetic, pressure, surgical, and\nvenous) vary from 78.77 to 100\\% in various experiments. The results presented\nin this study showcase the exceptional accuracy of the proposed methodology in\naccurately classifying the most commonly occurring wound types using wound\nimages and their corresponding locations.",

    "abstract": "Privacy and regulatory barriers often hinder centralized machine learning\nsolutions, particularly in sectors like healthcare where data cannot be freely\nshared. Federated learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm to address these\nconcerns; however, existing frameworks primarily support gradient-based models,\nleaving a gap for more interpretable, tree-based approaches. This paper\nintroduces a federated learning framework for Random Forest classifiers that\npreserves data privacy and provides robust performance in distributed settings.\nBy leveraging PySyft for secure, privacy-aware computation, our method enables\nmultiple institutions to collaboratively train Random Forest models on locally\nstored data without exposing sensitive information. The framework supports\nweighted model averaging to account for varying data distributions, incremental\nlearning to progressively refine models, and local evaluation to assess\nperformance across heterogeneous datasets. Experiments on two real-world\nhealthcare benchmarks demonstrate that the federated approach maintains\ncompetitive predictive accuracy - within a maximum 9\\% margin of centralized\nmethods - while satisfying stringent privacy requirements. These findings\nunderscore the viability of tree-based federated learning for scenarios where\ndata cannot be centralized due to regulatory, competitive, or technical\nconstraints. The proposed solution addresses a notable gap in existing\nfederated learning libraries, offering an adaptable tool for secure distributed\nmachine learning tasks that demand both transparency and reliable performance.\nThe tool is available at https://github.com/ieeta-pt/fed_rf.",

As a consequence, the\nchannel can be efficiently acquired and equalized. The Zak-OTFS carrier is a\npulse in the DD domain, and the Zak transform converts it to a pulse train\nmodulated by a tone (pulsone) in the time domain. The pulsone waveform is\nlocalized rather than spread, and it suffers from high peak-to-average power\nratio (PAPR). We describe how to transform the orthonormal basis of Zak-OTFS\npulsones into an orthonormal basis of spread carrier waveforms with low PAPR\n(only $6.58$ dB) that support communication in the presence of mobility and\ndelay spread. This transformation is realized by a unitary transform based on\nthe discrete affine Fourier transform. Unlike other spread modulations that\nachieve low PAPR by spreading information across a wider bandwidth (thus\nreducing the spectral efficiency), the proposed spread carrier-based Zak-OTFS\nachieves full spectral efficiency like pulsone-based Zak-OTFS, with $5.6$ dB\nlower PAPR per basis element.

Yet, despite the promise of this\nparadigm, it remains challenging to achieve due to algorithms not being able to\nlearn effectively from the autonomous data. For example, prior works have\napplied imitation learning and filtered imitation learning methods to the batch\nonline RL problem, but these algorithms often fail to efficiently improve from\nthe autonomously collected data or converge quickly to a suboptimal point. This\nraises the question of what matters for effective batch online RL in robotics.\nMotivated by this question, we perform a systematic empirical study of three\naxes -- (i) algorithm class, (ii) policy extraction methods, and (iii) policy\nexpressivity -- and analyze how these axes affect performance and scaling with\nthe amount of autonomous data. Through our analysis, we make several\nobservations. First, we observe that the use of Q-functions to guide batch\nonline RL significantly improves performance over imitation-based methods.\nBuilding on this, we show that an implicit method of policy extraction -- via\nchoosing the best action in the distribution of the policy -- is necessary over\ntraditional policy extraction methods from offline RL. Next, we show that an\nexpressive policy class is preferred over less expressive policy classes. Based\non this analysis, we propose a general recipe for effective batch online RL. We\nthen show a simple addition to the recipe of using temporally-correlated noise\nto obtain more diversity results in further performance gains. Our recipe\nobtains significantly better performance and scaling compared to prior methods.",

World Models predict\nhow the world will change when actions are performed, allowing for the\ngeneration of counterfactual trajectories. However, identifying what a user\nwanted the agent to do is not enough to understand why the agent did something\nelse. We augment Model-Based RL agents with a Reverse World Model, which\npredicts what the state of the world should have been for the agent to prefer a\ngiven counterfactual action. We show that explanations that show users what the\nworld should have been like significantly increase their understanding of the\nagent policy. We hypothesize that our explanations can help users learn how to\ncontrol the agents execution through by manipulating the environment.",

Specifically, the PA can\nenable polarforming to adaptively control the antenna's polarization\nelectrically as well as tune its position/rotation mechanically, so as to\neffectively exploit polarization and spatial diversity to reconfigure wireless\nchannels for improving sensing and communication performance. We study an\nPA-enhanced integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system that utilizes\nuser location sensing to facilitate communication between an PA-equipped base\nstation (BS) and PA-equipped users. First, we model the PA channel in terms of\ntransceiver antenna polarforming vectors and antenna positions/rotations. We\nthen propose a two-timescale ISAC protocol, where in the slow timescale, user\nlocalization is first performed, followed by the optimization of the BS\nantennas' positions and rotations based on the sensed user locations;\nsubsequently, in the fast timescale, transceiver polarforming is adapted to\ncater to the instantaneous channel state information (CSI), with the optimized\nBS antennas' positions and rotations. We propose a new polarforming-based user\nlocalization method that uses a structured time-domain pattern of\npilot-polarforming vectors to extract the common stable components in the PA\nchannel across different polarizations based on the parallel factor (PARAFAC)\ntensor model. Moreover, we maximize the achievable average sum-rate of users by\njointly optimizing the fast-timescale transceiver polarforming, including phase\nshifts and amplitude variations, along with the slow-timescale antenna\nrotations and positions at the BS. Simulation results validate the\neffectiveness of polarforming-based localization algorithm and demonstrate the\nperformance advantages of polarforming, antenna placement, and their joint\ndesign.",

Preventing infections at a small\nnumber of high-transmission settings is therefore an attractive public health\ngoal. Here, we use deterministic and stochastic mathematical modelling to\nquantify the impact of intranasal sprays in containing outbreaks at a known\nsuperspreading event (the 2020 SARS-CoV-2 outbreak at the Diamond Princess\ncruise ship) and a conference event that led to extensive transmission.\n  We find that in the Diamond Princess cruise ship case study, there exists a\n7-14-day window of opportunity for widespread prophylactic spray usage to\nsignificantly impact the number of infections averted. Given an immediate\nresponse to a known SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, alongside testing and social\ndistancing measures, prophylactic efficacy and coverage greater than 65% could\nreduce the average number of infections by over 90%. In the conference case\nstudy, in the absence of additional public health interventions, analyses\nsuggest much higher prophylactic efficacies and coverages are required to\nachieve a similar outcome. However, prophylactic use can half an individual's\nprobability of being infected, and significantly reduce the probability of\ndeveloping a severe infection. These results suggest that at a known potential\nsuperspreading event, early use of intranasal sprays can complement\nquarantining measures and significantly suppress a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, even at\nsuboptimal coverage. At a potential superspreading event of short duration,\nintranasal sprays can reduce individuals' risk of infection, but cannot prevent\nall infections or onwards community transmission.",

We investigate two models for the locomotion and\nthe flow field generated by a swimmer in such a medium. First, we analyze a\ndumbbell swimmer composed of two spring-connected spheres and driven by a\nflagellar force and derive its exact swimming velocity as a function of the\nBrinkman medium resistance, showing that the swimmer monotonically slows down\nas the medium drag monotonically increases. In the limit of no resistance the\nmodel reduces to the classical Stokes dipole swimmer, while finite resistance\nintroduces hydrodynamic screening that attenuates long-range interactions.\nAdditionally, we derive an analytical expression for the far-field flow\ngenerated by a Brinkmanlet force-dipole, which can be used for propulsive\npoint-dipole swimmer models. Remarkably, this approximation reproduces the\ndumbbell swimmer's flow field in the far-field regime with high accuracy.

    "abstract": "Accurate blood glucose prediction can enable novel interventions for type 1\ndiabetes treatment, including personalized insulin and dietary adjustments.\nAlthough recent advances in transformer-based architectures have demonstrated\nthe power of attention mechanisms in complex multivariate time series\nprediction, their potential for blood glucose (BG) prediction remains\nunderexplored. We present a comparative analysis of transformer models for\nmulti-horizon BG prediction, examining forecasts up to 4 hours and input\nhistory up to 1 week. The publicly available DCLP3 dataset (n=112) was split\n(80%-10%-10%) for training, validation, and testing, and the OhioT1DM dataset\n(n=12) served as an external test set. We trained networks with point-wise,\npatch-wise, series-wise, and hybrid embeddings, using CGM, insulin, and meal\ndata. For short-term blood glucose prediction, Crossformer, a patch-wise\ntransformer architecture, achieved a superior 30-minute prediction of RMSE\n(15.6 mg / dL on OhioT1DM). For longer-term predictions (1h, 2h, and 4h),\nPatchTST, another path-wise transformer, prevailed with the lowest RMSE (24.6\nmg/dL, 36.1 mg/dL, and 46.5 mg/dL on OhioT1DM). In general, models that used\ntokenization through patches demonstrated improved accuracy with larger input\nsizes, with the best results obtained with a one-week history. These findings\nhighlight the promise of transformer-based architectures for BG prediction by\ncapturing and leveraging seasonal patterns in multivariate time-series data to\nimprove accuracy.",

It looks like $\\delta$-Novikov algebras have a richer\nstructure than Novikov algebras. So, unlike Novikov algebras, they have\nnon-commutative simple finite-dimensional algebras for $\\delta=-1.$\nAdditionally, we introduce $\\delta$-Novikov--Poisson algebras, extending\nseveral theorems from the classical Novikov--Poisson algebras. Specifically, we\nconsider the commutator structure $[a, b] = a \\circ b - b \\circ a$ of\n$\\delta$-Novikov algebras, proving that when $\\delta \\neq 1$, these algebras\nare metabelian Lie-admissible. Moreover, we prove that every metabelian Lie\nalgebra can be embedded into a suitable $\\delta$-Novikov algebra with respect\nto the commutator product. We further consider the construction of\n$\\delta$-Poisson and transposed $\\delta$-Poisson algebras through\n$\\delta$-derivations on the commutative associative algebras. Finally, we\nanalyze the operad associated with the variety of $\\delta$-Novikov algebras,\nproving that it is not Koszul for any value of $\\delta$.

Currently, there are a handful of stars with\nprecise ($\\pm$3 %), model-independent mass measurements that are \"effectively\nsingle\" and for which we can obtain clean spectra (i.e. spectra that are not\nblended with a close companion). In this paper, we introduce GJ 105 AC as the\nnewest members of this exclusive population. We present an updated orbital\nanalysis for the long-period K3+M7 binary GJ 105 AC. We jointly analyze radial\nvelocity (RV) and relative astrometry data, including new RVs from the\nMiniature Exoplanet Radial Velocity Array (MINERVA) that capture the full\nperiapsis passage and the RV minimum of the $76.0 \\pm 1.3$ yr orbit for the\nfirst time.

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the design of distributed precoding for\nmulti-satellite massive MIMO transmissions. We first conduct a detailed\nanalysis of the transceiver model, in which delay and Doppler precompensation\nis introduced to ensure coherent transmission. In this analysis, we examine the\nimpact of precompensation errors on the transmission model, emphasize the\nnear-independence of inter-satellite interference, and ultimately derive the\nreceived signal model. Based on such signal model, we formulate an approximate\nexpected rate maximization problem that considers both statistical channel\nstate information (sCSI) and compensation errors. Unlike conventional\napproaches that recast such problems as weighted minimum mean square error\n(WMMSE) minimization, we demonstrate that this transformation fails to maintain\nequivalence in the considered scenario. To address this, we introduce an\nequivalent covariance decomposition-based WMMSE (CDWMMSE) formulation derived\nbased on channel covariance matrix decomposition. Taking advantage of the\nchannel characteristics, we develop a low-complexity decomposition method and\npropose an optimization algorithm. To further reduce computational complexity,\nwe introduce a model-driven scalable deep learning (DL) approach that leverages\nthe equivariance of the mapping from sCSI to the unknown variables in the\noptimal closed-form solution, enhancing performance through novel dense\nTransformer network and scaling-invariant loss function design. Simulation\nresults validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method in\nsome practical scenarios.

Both algorithms are derived using latent\nvariables and an appropriate message-passing schedule. A quantized,\nprotograph-based density evolution procedure is used to optimize GLDPC codes\nfor Min-Sum decoding.

It employs a rapid communication strategy that uses information\npackets to exchange motion constraint information, enhancing cooperative\npathfinding and situational awareness, even in scenarios without direct\ncommunication. We prove that PRISM resolves and avoids all deadlock scenarios\nwhen possible, a critical challenge in decentralized pathfinding.

PRISM\ndemonstrates scalability and solution quality, supporting 3.4 times more agents\nthan CBS and handling up to 2.5 times more tasks in narrow passage environments\nthan TPTS. Additionally, PRISM matches CBS in solution quality while achieving\nfaster computation times, even under low-connectivity conditions.

Due to its importance, there is extensive work on the effectiveness\nof refactoring in achieving code quality. However, developer's intentions are\nusually overlooked. A more recent area of study involves the concept of\nself-affirmed refactoring (SAR), where developers explicitly state their intent\nto refactor. While studies on SAR have made valuable contributions, they\nprovide little insights into refactoring complexity and effectiveness, as well\nas the refactorings' relations to specific non-functional requirements. A study\nby Soares et al. addressed such aspects, but it relied on a quite small sample\nof studied subject systems and refactoring instances. Following the empirical\nmethod of replication, we expanded the scope of Soares et al.'s study by\ndoubling the number of projects analyzed and a significantly larger set of\nvalidated refactorings (8,408). Our findings only partially align with the\noriginal study. We observed that when developers explicitly state their\nrefactoring intent, the resulting changes typically involve a combination of\ndifferent refactoring types, making them more complex. Additionally, we\nconfirmed that such complex refactorings positively impact code's internal\nquality attributes. While refactorings aimed at non-functional requirements\ntend to improve code quality, our findings only partially align with the\noriginal study and contradict it in several ways. Notably, SARs often result in\nfewer negative impacts on internal quality attributes despite their frequent\ncomplexity. These insights suggest the importance of simplifying refactorings\nwhere possible and explicitly stating their goals, as clear intent helps shape\nmore effective and targeted refactoring strategies.",

We present Robust Deformable Detector (RDD), a novel\nand robust keypoint detector/descriptor leveraging the deformable transformer,\nwhich captures global context and geometric invariance through deformable\nself-attention mechanisms. Specifically, we observed that deformable attention\nfocuses on key locations, effectively reducing the search space complexity and\nmodeling the geometric invariance. Furthermore, we collected an Air-to-Ground\ndataset for training in addition to the standard MegaDepth dataset. Our\nproposed method outperforms all state-of-the-art keypoint detection/description\nmethods in sparse matching tasks and is also capable of semi-dense matching. To\nensure comprehensive evaluation, we introduce two challenging benchmarks: one\nemphasizing large viewpoint and scale variations, and the other being an\nAir-to-Ground benchmark -- an evaluation setting that has recently gaining\npopularity for 3D reconstruction across different altitudes.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we develop a method to extract the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy\nof $D$-dimensional black holes using the entanglement entropy of a\nlower-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT). This approach relies on two key\nobservations. On the gravitational side, the near-horizon geometry of extremal\nblack holes is AdS$_{2}$, and the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is entirely\ndetermined by this two-dimensional geometry. Moreover, the higher-dimensional\nspherical part of the black hole metric is absorbed into the $D$-dimensional\nNewton's constant $G_{N}^{\\left(D\\right)}$, which can be effectively reduced to\na two-dimensional Newton's constant $G_{N}^{\\left(2\\right)}$. On the field\ntheory side, the entanglement entropy of two disconnected one-dimensional\nconformal quantum mechanics (CQM$_{1}$) can be calculated. According to the\nRyu-Takayanagi (RT) prescription, this entanglement entropy computes the area\nof the minimal surface in the AdS$_{2}$ geometry. Since the near-horizon region\nof the black hole and the emergent spacetime derived from the entanglement\nentropy share the same Penrose diagram -- with both the black hole event\nhorizon and the RT surface corresponding to specific points on this diagram --\nthe Bekenstein-Hawking entropy can be probed via entanglement entropy when\nthese points coincide. This result explicitly demonstrates that the\nentanglement across the event horizon is the fundamental origin of the\nBekenstein-Hawking entropy.",

We present a high-resolution spectropolarimetric\ntime series obtained with ESPaDOnS, which we use to perform a magnetic analysis\nusing least-squares deconvolution (LSD). We find that $\\rho$ Oph A is a\nspectroscopic binary consisting of two B-type stars with masses of about 8 and\n10 $M_\\odot$ on a slightly eccentric 88-day orbit, with the magnetic field\nbeing associated with the smaller Ab component.

The oblique rotator model derived from the\nlongitudinal magnetic field curve agrees well with the LSD Stokes $V$ profiles,\nindicating that the magnetic field is likely to be very nearly dipolar. The\norbital and rotational axes appear to be aligned. We report for the first time\n$\\rho$ Oph Ab's magnetospheric H$\\alpha$ emission, which is consistent with an\norigin in a centrifugal magnetosphere. We also demonstrate that $\\rho$ Oph Ab's\nlight curve can be recovered from the previously reported {\\em Kepler-2} light\ncurve of $\\rho$ Oph C, and that it demonstrates prominent magnetospheric\neclipses similar to those of $\\sigma$ Ori E, and which can be reproduced using\na dipolar Rigidly Rotating Magnetosphere model. Both H$\\alpha$ and the light\ncurve are indicative of a strongly asymmetric magnetosphere. All indications\nare that $\\rho$ Oph Ab's magnetic field is essentially dipolar, meaning that\ncontributions from higher-order multipoles probably cannot explain the strong\nasymmetry in the magnetosphere. Only two other stars show comparable degrees of\nasymmetry, both of which are also close binaries, suggesting that binarity can\naffect the magnetospheric plasma distributions.",

    "abstract": "Refactoring is a common practice in software development, aimed at improving\nthe internal code structure in order to make it easier to understand and\nmodify. Consequently, it is often assumed that refactoring makes the code less\nprone to bugs. However, in practice, refactoring is a complex task and applied\nin different ways (e.g., various refactoring types, single vs. composite\nrefactorings) and with a variety of purposes (e.g., root-canal vs. floss\nrefactoring). Therefore, certain refactorings can inadvertently make the code\nmore prone to bugs. Unfortunately, there is limited research in the literature\non the long-term relationship between the different characteristics of\nrefactorings and bugs. This paper presents a longitudinal study of 12 open\nsource software projects, where 27,450 refactorings, 6,051 reported bugs, and\n49,250 bugs detected with static analysis tools were analyzed. While our study\nconfirms the common intuition that refactored code is less bug-prone than\nnon-refactored code, we also extend or contradict existing body of knowledge in\nother ways. First, a code element that undergoes multiple refactorings is not\nless bug-prone than an element that undergoes a single refactoring. A single\nrefactoring is the one not performed in conjunction with other refactorings in\nthe same commit. Second, single refactorings often induce the occurrence of\nbugs across all analyzed projects. Third, code elements affected by\nrefactorings made in conjunction with other non-refactoring changes in the same\ncommit (i.e., floss refactorings) are often bug-prone. Finally, many of such\nbugs induced by refactoring cannot be revealed with state-of-the-art techniques\nfor detecting behavior-preserving refactorings.",

We introduce the program and show representative results.\nMIRI-MRS data of 17 low-mass and 6 high-mass protostars show a wide variety of\nfeatures. Atomic line maps differ among refractory (e.g., Fe), semi-refractory\n(e.g., S) and volatile elements (e.g., Ne), linked to their different levels of\ndepletion and local (shock) conditions. Nested, stratified jet structures\nconsisting of an inner ionized core seen in [Fe II] with an outer H2 layer are\ncommonly seen. Wide-angle winds are found in low-J H2 lines. [S I] follows the\njet in the youngest protostars, but is concentrated on source when more\nevolved. [Ne II] reveals a mix of jet shock and photoionized emission. H I\nlines measure accretion, but are also associated with jets. Molecular emission\n(CO2, C2H2, HCN, H2O, ..) is cool compared with disks, and likely associated\nwith hot cores. Deep ice absorption features reveal not just the major ice\ncomponents but also ions (as part of salts) and complex organic molecules, with\ncomparable abundances from low- to high-mass sources. A second detection of HDO\nice in a solar-mass source is presented with HDO/H2O ~ 0.4%, providing a link\nwith disks and comets.

This work explores semantic\nanomaly detection by leveraging the semantic priors of state-of-the-art vision\nfoundation models, operating directly on the image. We propose a framework that\ncompares local vision embeddings from runtime images to a database of nominal\nscenarios in which the autonomous system is deemed safe and performant. In this\nwork, we consider two variants of the proposed framework: one using raw\ngrid-based embeddings, and another leveraging instance segmentation for\nobject-centric representations. To further improve robustness, we introduce a\nsimple filtering mechanism to suppress false positives. Our evaluations on\nCARLA-simulated anomalies show that the instance-based method with filtering\nachieves performance comparable to GPT-4o, while providing precise anomaly\nlocalization.

    "abstract": "With the rise of machine learning techniques, ensuring the fairness of\ndecisions made by machine learning algorithms has become of great importance in\ncritical applications. However, measuring fairness often requires full access\nto the model parameters, which compromises the confidentiality of the models.\nIn this paper, we propose a solution using zero-knowledge proofs, which allows\nthe model owner to convince the public that a machine learning model is fair\nwhile preserving the secrecy of the model. To circumvent the efficiency barrier\nof naively proving machine learning inferences in zero-knowledge, our key\ninnovation is a new approach to measure fairness only with model parameters and\nsome aggregated information of the input, but not on any specific dataset. To\nachieve this goal, we derive new bounds for the fairness of logistic regression\nand deep neural network models that are tighter and better reflecting the\nfairness compared to prior work. Moreover, we develop efficient zero-knowledge\nproof protocols for common computations involved in measuring fairness,\nincluding the spectral norm of matrices, maximum, absolute value, and\nfixed-point arithmetic.\n  We have fully implemented our system, FairZK, that proves machine learning\nfairness in zero-knowledge. Experimental results show that FairZK is\nsignificantly faster than the naive approach and an existing scheme that use\nzero-knowledge inferences as a subroutine. The prover time is improved by\n3.1x--1789x depending on the size of the model and the dataset. FairZK can\nscale to a large model with 47 million parameters for the first time, and\ngenerates a proof for its fairness in 343 seconds. This is estimated to be 4\norders of magnitude faster than existing schemes, which only scale to small\nmodels with hundreds to thousands of parameters.",

    "abstract": "Polarization switches are of great technological interest because of their\nmany applications in long distance electromagnetic communication (e.g.,\npolarization division multiplexing). Binary bits can be encoded in the two\northogonal polarizations and transmitted from point to point. Polarization\nswitches, however, are usually much larger than the wavelength of the\nelectromagnetic wave that they transmit. Consequently, most research in this\narea has focused on the optical regime where the wavelength is relatively short\n(~1 micron), so that the switch being much larger than the wavelength is not\ntoo inconvenient. However, this changes in the microwave regime where the\nwavelength is much larger (typically > 1 cm). That makes a microwave\nultra-sub-wavelength polarization switch very attractive. Here, for the first\ntime to the authors' knowledge, such a switch made of an array of\nmagnetostrictive nanomagnets (~100 nm lateral dimension, ~5 nm thickness)\ndeposited on a piezoelectric substrate to make an \"artificial multiferroic\nmagnonic crystal (AMMC)\" is reported. A surface acoustic wave (SAW) launched in\nthe substrate with suitable electrodes excites confined spin waves in the\nnanomagnets via phonon-magnon coupling, which then radiate electromagnetic\nwaves in space via magnon-photon coupling. In some particular direction(s),\ndetermined by the AMMC parameters, the polarization of the beam at a given\nfrequency can be rotated through ~90 degrees by switching the direction of SAW\npropagation in the piezoelectric substrate between two mutually orthogonal\ndirections via activation of two different pairs of SAW launching electrodes.\nBy aligning the transmitter and the receiver along such a direction (known only\nto authorized users), one can communicate covertly from point to point, without\nthe need for encryption or cryptography.",

    "abstract": "The intricate and multifaceted nature of vision language model (VLM)\ndevelopment, adaptation, and application necessitates the establishment of\nclear and standardized reporting protocols, particularly within the high-stakes\ncontext of healthcare. Defining these reporting standards is inherently\nchallenging due to the diverse nature of studies involving VLMs, which vary\nsignificantly from the development of all new VLMs or finetuning for domain\nalignment to off-the-shelf use of VLM for targeted diagnosis and prediction\ntasks. In this position paper, we argue that traditional machine learning\nreporting standards and evaluation guidelines must be restructured to\naccommodate multiphase VLM studies; it also has to be organized for intuitive\nunderstanding of developers while maintaining rigorous standards for\nreproducibility. To facilitate community adoption, we propose a categorization\nframework for VLM studies and outline corresponding reporting standards that\ncomprehensively address performance evaluation, data reporting protocols, and\nrecommendations for manuscript composition. These guidelines are organized\naccording to the proposed categorization scheme. Lastly, we present a checklist\nthat consolidates reporting standards, offering a standardized tool to ensure\nconsistency and quality in the publication of VLM-related research.",

Our simulation demonstrates that a specific conditional DIC\nvariant provides more reliable results and accurately identifies true model\nconfigurations. We improve the accuracy of rank selection by applying knee\npoint detection to the DICs, rather than defaulting to the minimum DIC value.\nUpon analyzing functional magnetic resonance imaging data from story reading\ntasks, our selected model configurations suggest time-varying dynamics while\nreducing the number of parameters by over 90% relative to standard VARs.\nGranger causality analysis reveals directional brain connectivity patterns that\nalign with narrative progression, with various regions functioning as signal\nemitters or receivers at different time points.",

However, due to the heuristic arguments in\nmost GUP literature, it is not clear how to obtain the Schwarzschild metric\nthat incorporates GUP correction. In this work, we try a different approach. We\nwill start with the entropy expression with the standard logarithmic correction\nterm, and use the recently proposed \"generalized entropy and varying-G\ncorrespondence\" (GEVAG) to obtain the associated metric. We show that the\nHawking temperature obtained from this metric matches the GUP version.

The X-ray\naccretion and radio jet properties change dramatically throughout an outburst\nin a broadly consistent way between sources. Changes to the accretion flow and\nthe corona are evident through X-ray spectral variations, while the jet's\nevolution produces changes in the radio. Typically, high energy emission from\nthe corona initially dominate the X-ray spectrum, and quasi-steady compact jets\nare observed in the radio. As the outburst progresses, emission from the corona\nfades and is superseded by lower energy X-ray accretion disk emission. During\nthis transition, the compact jets are quenched and discrete ejecta, called\ntransient jets, are launched. The concurrence of the corona's weakening and the\njet's transition from compact to transient implies a connection, but the\nprecise relationship has not been established. Motivated by this, we aim to\ninvestigate the corona-jet connection. We perform spectral modeling in the hard\nand soft X-ray, utilizing $NuSTAR$, $NICER$, and $Swift$/XRT observations to\ntrack the evolving X-ray corona for three LMXBs: MAXI J1348-630, MAXI J1535-571\nand MAXI J1820+070. We use prior work to mark the presence of compact jets and\nthe dates of discrete jet ejections. We find a clear connection between the\nevolution of the corona and the jet: across all three sources an increase in\nthe distance of the corona from the black hole occurs near the time that the\ncompact jet is quenched and the transient jet is launched.",

    "abstract": "Recent research enhances language model reasoning by scaling test-time\ncompute via longer chain-of-thought traces. This often improves accuracy but\nalso introduces redundancy and high computational cost, especially for small\nlanguage models distilled with supervised fine-tuning (SFT). In this work, we\npropose new algorithms to improve token-efficient reasoning with small-scale\nmodels by effectively trading off accuracy and computation. We first show that\nthe post-SFT model fails to determine the optimal stopping point of the\nreasoning process, resulting in verbose and repetitive outputs. Verbosity also\nsignificantly varies across wrong vs correct responses. To address these\nissues, we propose two solutions: (1) Temperature scaling (TS) to control the\nstopping point for the thinking phase and thereby trace length, and (2) TLDR: a\nlength-regularized reinforcement learning method based on GRPO that facilitates\nmulti-level trace length control (e.g. short, medium, long reasoning).\nExperiments on four reasoning benchmarks, MATH500, AMC, AIME24 and\nOlympiadBench, demonstrate that TS is highly effective compared to s1's budget\nforcing approach and TLDR significantly improves token efficiency by about 50%\nwith minimal to no accuracy loss over the SFT baseline. Moreover, TLDR also\nfacilitates flexible control over the response length, offering a practical and\neffective solution for token-efficient reasoning in small models. Ultimately,\nour work reveals the importance of stopping time control, highlights\nshortcomings of pure SFT, and provides effective algorithmic recipes.",

At low metallicity, they might\ncollapse directly into black holes, or end their lives as pair-instability\nsupernovae. Recent observational results set an upper limit of $0.7\\,{}\\mathrm{\nyr}^{-1} \\,{}\\mathrm{ Gpc}^{-3}$ on the rate density of pair-instability\nsupernovae in the nearby Universe. However, most theoretical models predict\nrates exceeding this limit. Here, we compute new VMS tracks with the MESA code,\nand use them to analyze the evolution of the (pulsational) pair-instability\nsupernova rate density across cosmic time. We show that stellar wind models\naccounting for the transition between optically thin and thick winds yield a\npair-instability supernova rate $\\mathcal{R}_{\\mathrm{PISN}}\\sim{}0.1$\nGpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ at redshift $z\\sim{}0$, about two orders of magnitude\nlower than our previous models. We find that the main contribution to the\npair-instability supernova rate comes from stars with metallicity\n$Z\\sim{}0.001-0.002$. Stars with higher metallicities cannot enter the\npair-instability supernova regime, even if their zero-age main sequence mass is\nup to 500 M$_\\odot$. The main reason is that VMSs enter the regime for\noptically thick winds during the main sequence at metallicity as low as\n$Z\\sim{4}\\times{}10^{-4}$. This enhances the mass loss rate, quenching the\ngrowth of the He core and thus preventing the onset of pair-instability in\nlater evolutionary stages. This result highlights the critical role of mass\nloss in shaping the final fate of very massive stars and the rate of\npair-instability supernovae.",

More specifically, restricting\nourselves to a specific coherent state in a simple (free) GFT, we study two\ntypes of perturbative GFT modes, squeezed and oscillating modes. For squeezed\nmodes we find perturbation equations with Euclidean signature and a late-time\nlimit that differs from general relativistic perturbation equations.\nOscillating modes satisfy different dynamical equations that also differ from\nthose of general relativity, but show a Lorentzian signature.

In the second procedure, which was proposed without proof in e-print\n2308.05044, the dependence on $z_i$ is expressed in terms the single-valued,\nmodular invariant, but non-meromorphic DHS kernels introduced in e-print\n2306.08644 while the dependence on $\\delta$ resides in modular tensors that are\nindependent of $z_i$ and are generally non-holomorphic in the moduli of\n$\\Sigma$. Although the individual building blocks of these decompositions have\nmarkedly different properties, we show that the combinatorial structure of the\ntwo decompositions is virtually identical, thereby extending the striking\ncorrespondence observed earlier between the roles played by Enriquez and DHS\nkernels. Both decompositions are further generalized to the case of linear\nchain products of Szeg\\\"o kernels.",

These clusters were observed as part of the CLASH, HFF, BUFFALO, and\nCLASH-VLT programs, that provided high-quality photometric and spectroscopic\ndata. Additional high-resolution spectroscopic data were obtained with MUSE at\nthe VLT. Our research is based on strong lensing analyses that rely on these\nmeasurements. From these data, we measure the projected total mass profiles of\neach galaxy cluster in our sample. We fit these mass profiles with\none-component, spherically symmetric mass models including the\nNavarro-Frenk-White (NFW), non-singular isothermal sphere, beta model, and\nHernquist profiles. We perform a Bayesian analysis to sample the posterior\nprobability distributions of the free parameters of the models. We find that\nthe NFW, Hernquist, and beta models are the most suitable profiles to fit the\nmeasured projected cluster total mass profiles. Moreover, we test the\nrobustness of our results in a twofold way: we slightly modify the center of\nthe projected mass profiles and the radial range of the considered region. We\nemploy the results obtained with the Hernquist profile to compare our total\nmass estimates ($M_\\mathrm{H}^\\mathrm{tot} = M_\\mathrm{H} (r\\rightarrow +\n\\infty)$), with the $M_\\mathrm{200c}$ values from weak lensing studies. Through\nthis analysis, we find scaling relations between $M_\\mathrm{H}^\\mathrm{tot}$\nand $M_\\mathrm{200c}$ and the value of the scale radius, $r_\\mathrm{S}$, and\n$R_\\mathrm{200c}$. Interestingly, we also find that the $M_\\mathrm{200c}$\nvalues, obtained by extrapolating the fitted total mass profiles, are very\nclose to the weak lensing results.

Thermal friction and fluctuations can dominate the standard de\nSitter analogues, resulting in a modified slow-roll scenario with a new source\nof density fluctuations. Due to issues with back-reaction, it is advantageous\nto consider inflaton couplings with the thermal bath that are pseudo-scalar in\nnature, e.g., derivative interactions or topological $F \\tilde F$ couplings. We\ndemonstrate that $\\textit{ every single}$ existing model of warm inflation\nutilizing pseudo-scalar couplings needs to be corrected to account for the\nchemical potentials that the thermal bath acquires in response to the inflaton\ncoupling. These chemical potentials are for non-conserved charges, and are\nnon-zero only because of the applied inflaton couplings. The model-dependent\nchemical potentials modify the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, making the\nrelationship between the thermal friction and thermal fluctuations\nmodel-dependent. In extreme cases, these chemical potentials can cause the\nfriction term to vanish while thermal fluctuations remain non-zero. In the\ncontext of a simple example, we demonstrate how to calculate the chemical\npotentials, thermal friction, and thermal fluctuations using both the Boltzmann\nequations and by calculating thermal expectation values, showing explicitly\nthat the two approaches give the same result.",

We\nperformed 2D hydrodynamic simulations of a single, non-migrating planet\nembedded in a gaseous disk to investigate this effect.

A symmetric distribution is recovered on globally isothermal\ndisks.

In Black-Hole Low-Mass X-ray Binaries (BH\nLMXBs), the compact object accretes matter from a low-mass companion star via\nRoche Lobe overflow, forming an accretion disk, and occasionally exhibiting\nbright eruptions. The BH LMXB Swift J1727.8-1613 (hereafter J1727), recently\nunderwent one of the brightest outbursts ever recorded in X-rays, in August\n2023. This analysis aims to study the timing properties of J1727, in the\ndecaying phase of its outburst, using high-time resolution XMM-Newton data. We\nanalyzed J1727's power spectrum (PS) and cross spectrum (CS), which we modeled\nwith Lorentzians. The PS reveals how the source's power is distributed across\nfrequencies, and the Real and Imaginary parts of the CS compare the\ndisplacement of the light curves in different energy bands across the\nobservations. Finally, we simultaneously derived the phase lags and the\ncoherence, using a constant phase lag model. While the first (soft-state)\nobservation does not show any strong variability, the two harder observations\nexhibit quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs). Because the QPO is more\nsignificantly detected in the Imaginary part of the CS than in the PS, we refer\nto it as the 'Imaginary QPO'. The QPO is more prominent in the soft 0.3-2 keV\nband than in the hard 2-12 keV band. As the source evolves towards the hard\nstate, the Imaginary QPO shifts to lower frequencies, the broadband fractional\nrms amplitude in the 0.3-2 keV energy band increases, while the rms covariance\nof the Imaginary QPO decreases. Simultaneously, the phase lags increase and the\ncoherence function drops at the Imaginary QPO frequency. In the elusive\nsoft-to-hard transition of J1727, the first XMM-Newton observations of the\nsource reveal an Imaginary QPO also detected in the PS, exhibiting the\nproperties of a type-C QPO.",

In this letter, we show experimentally that the precise\nKibble-Zurek scaling can be retained in the near-critical crossover regime, not\nnecessarily crossing the critical point strictly. The key ingredient to\nachieving this near-critical Kibble-Zurek scaling is that the system size and\nthe symmetry-breaking field must be appropriately scaled following the\nvariation of ramping speeds. The experiment is performed in a reconfigurable\nRydberg atom array platform, where the Rydberg blockade effect induces a Z2\nsymmetry-breaking transition. The atom array platform enables precise control\nof the system size and the zigzag geometry as a symmetry-breaking field.\nTherefore, we can demonstrate notable differences in the precision of the\nKibble-Zurek scaling with or without properly scaling the system size and the\nzigzag geometry.

In particular, we study the implications for spacetimes\nwith dynamical boundaries. We argue that requiring inertial observers localized\non an end-of-the-world (ETW) brane to be in causal contact with every other\nobserver is too restrictive as there exist string-theoretic solutions without\nthis property. Hence, if one does not want to abandon the idea of cosmological\nhorizons being the fundamental issue with de Sitter, a refined condition is\nneeded. The requirement that inertial, boundary-localized observers should be\nin causal contact with all other observers on the same ETW brane is such an\nappropriate refinement. We explore the consequences of this criterion for ETW\nbranes whose energy density is governed by a scalar field, considering two\ncases: First, with a scalar field confined to the ETW brane, and second, with a\nbulk modulus subject to a brane-localized potential.",

We evaluate\nthe iron share between ICM and stars within simulated galaxy clusters with the\ntwofold aim of investigating the origin of possible differences with respect to\nobservational findings and of shedding light on the observed excess of iron on\nthe ICM with respect to expectations based on the observed stellar population.\nWe evaluated the iron mass in gas and stars in a sample of 448 simulated\nsystems with masses M500 > 1e14 Msun at z=0.07. These were extracted from the\nhigh-resolution (352 cMpc/h)^3 volume of the Magneticum cosmological\nhydrodynamical simulations. We compared our results with observational data of\nlow-redshift galaxy clusters. The iron share in simulated clusters features a\nshallow dependence on the total mass, and its value is close to unity on\naverage. In the most massive simulated systems, the iron share is thus smaller\nthan observational values by almost an order of magnitude. The dominant\ncontribution to this difference is related to the stellar component, whereas\nthe chemical properties of the ICM agree well overall with the observations. We\nfind larger stellar mass fractions in simulated massive clusters, which in turn\nyield higher stellar iron masses, than in observational data.

We investigate several dynamical routes\nby which this nearby companion star could have played a role in converting a\ncold Jupiter into the retrograde hot Jupiter that is observed today. Of\nparticular interest is a novel \"eccentricity cascade\" mechanism involving both\nof the companion stars: the outer companion periodically excites the\neccentricity of the inner companion through von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (ZLK)\ncycles, and this eccentricity excitation is slowly transferred to the cold\nJupiter via successive close encounters, eventually triggering its\nhigh-eccentricity migration. The plausibility of this mechanism in explaining\nHAT-P-7b shows that stellar companions traditionally considered too distant to\ncause hot Jupiter formation might nevertheless be responsible, with the aid of\ncloser-orbiting massive companions.

DanceGRPO establishes several significant advances: First,\nit demonstrates consistent and stable policy optimization across multiple\nmodern generative paradigms, including both diffusion models and rectified\nflows. Second, it maintains robust performance when scaling to complex,\nreal-world scenarios encompassing three key tasks and four foundation models.\nThird, it shows remarkable versatility in optimizing for diverse human\npreferences as captured by five distinct reward models assessing image/video\naesthetics, text-image alignment, video motion quality, and binary feedback.\nOur comprehensive experiments reveal that DanceGRPO outperforms baseline\nmethods by up to 181\\% across multiple established benchmarks, including\nHPS-v2.1, CLIP Score, VideoAlign, and GenEval. Our results establish DanceGRPO\nas a robust and versatile solution for scaling Reinforcement Learning from\nHuman Feedback (RLHF) tasks in visual generation, offering new insights into\nharmonizing reinforcement learning and visual synthesis.",

Our high-level System 2, an image diffusion model, generates\ntext-conditioned pixel motion sequences from a single frame to guide robot\ncontrol. Pixel motion-a universal, interpretable, and motion-centric\nrepresentation-can be extracted from videos in a weakly-supervised manner,\nenabling diffusion model training on any video-caption data. Treating generated\npixel motion as learned universal representations, our low level System 1\nmodule translates these into robot actions via motion-to-action mapping\nfunctions, which can be either hand-crafted or learned with minimal\nsupervision. System 2 operates as a high-level policy applied at sparse\ntemporal intervals, while System 1 acts as a low-level policy at dense temporal\nintervals. This hierarchical decoupling enables flexible, scalable, and\ngeneralizable robot control under both unsupervised and supervised settings,\nbridging the gap between language, motion, and action.

To bridge the gap\nbetween imagination and execution, we present IVE (Imagine, Verify, Execute),\nan agentic exploration framework inspired by human curiosity.

Similarly, IVE leverages VLMs to\nabstract RGB-D observations into semantic scene graphs, imagine novel scenes,\npredict their physical plausibility, and generate executable skill sequences\nthrough action tools. We evaluate IVE in both simulated and real-world tabletop\nenvironments. The results show that IVE enables more diverse and meaningful\nexploration than RL baselines, as evidenced by a 4.1 to 7.8x increase in the\nentropy of visited states.

In addition,\nwe propose a real-space depth regularization, which avoids wrap-around\nartifacts and can be useful for twisted two-dimensional (2D) material datasets\nand vertical heterostructures.

When applied to continuous modalities such as visual data,\nVisual AutoRegressive modeling (VAR) typically resorts to quantization-based\napproaches to cast the data into a discrete space, which can introduce\nsignificant information loss. To tackle this issue, we introduce a Continuous\nVAR framework that enables direct visual autoregressive generation without\nvector quantization. The underlying theoretical foundation is strictly proper\nscoring rules, which provide powerful statistical tools capable of evaluating\nhow well a generative model approximates the true distribution. Within this\nframework, all we need is to select a strictly proper score and set it as the\ntraining objective to optimize. We primarily explore a class of training\nobjectives based on the energy score, which is likelihood-free and thus\novercomes the difficulty of making probabilistic predictions in the continuous\nspace. Previous efforts on continuous autoregressive generation, such as GIVT\nand diffusion loss, can also be derived from our framework using other strictly\nproper scores.

At the same\ntime, both ATLAS and CMS as well as all experiments at the Large\nElectron-Position (LEP) collider have reported excesses consistent with a light\nHiggs boson channel around 95 GeV, suggesting a potential connection between\nthese two signals. In this study, we investigate these anomalies within the\ncontext of the CP-conserving 2-Higgs-Doublet Model (2HDM) Type~III. In our\nproposed scenario, a heavy CP-odd Higgs boson $A$ with a mass near 650 GeV\ndecays into a SM-like Higgs boson $H$ and a $Z$ boson, with the $H$ boson\nsubsequently decaying into diphotons and the $Z$ boson decaying into $b\\bar{b}$\npairs. To explain the excess around 95 GeV, we independently select the mass of\nthe light CP-even Higgs boson of the model $h$ to be around this value. This\nconfiguration allows for a consistent explanation of both the high- and\nlow-mass excesses observed in the experiments. Through a detailed analysis, we\ndemonstrate that these two signals can be fitted simultaneously at the\n2.5$\\sigma$ significance level, offering a promising solution to the observed\nanomalies and potentially hinting at new physics Beyond the Standard Model\n(BSM).",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of various static word\nembeddings for Hungarian, including traditional models such as Word2Vec,\nFastText, as well as static embeddings derived from BERT-based models using\ndifferent extraction methods. We evaluate these embeddings on both intrinsic\nand extrinsic tasks to provide a holistic view of their performance. For\nintrinsic evaluation, we employ a word analogy task, which assesses the\nembeddings ability to capture semantic and syntactic relationships. Our results\nindicate that traditional static embeddings, particularly FastText, excel in\nthis task, achieving high accuracy and mean reciprocal rank (MRR) scores. Among\nthe BERT-based models, the X2Static method for extracting static embeddings\ndemonstrates superior performance compared to decontextualized and aggregate\nmethods, approaching the effectiveness of traditional static embeddings. For\nextrinsic evaluation, we utilize a bidirectional LSTM model to perform Named\nEntity Recognition (NER) and Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging tasks. The results\nreveal that embeddings derived from dynamic models, especially those extracted\nusing the X2Static method, outperform purely static embeddings. Notably, ELMo\nembeddings achieve the highest accuracy in both NER and POS tagging tasks,\nunderscoring the benefits of contextualized representations even when used in a\nstatic form. Our findings highlight the continued relevance of static word\nembeddings in NLP applications and the potential of advanced extraction methods\nto enhance the utility of BERT-based models. This piece of research contributes\nto the understanding of embedding performance in the Hungarian language and\nprovides valuable insights for future developments in the field.

This is applied in the context of complex spatiotemporal data\nmodelling, through an adaptation of the integrated nested Laplace approximation\n(INLA) method within a Bayesian estimation framework. Particular emphasis is\nplaced on the interpretation of model coefficients and results, both on the\noriginal scale of the response variable and in terms of elasticities.\n  The methodology is demonstrated through a detailed case study investigating\nthe relationship between all-cause mortality and the interaction between\nextreme temperatures, air pollution composition, and total air pollution in\nCatalonia, Spain, during the summer of 2022. The results indicate that extreme\ntemperatures are associated with an increased risk of mortality four days after\nexposure.

    "abstract": "While a Hamiltonian with a real potential acts as a Hermitian operator when\nit operates on bound states, it produces resonances with complex energies in a\nscattering experiment. The scattering states are not square integrable, being\ninstead delta function normalized. This lack of square integrability breaks the\nconnection between Hermiticity and real eigenvalues, to thus allow for real\nbound state sector eigenvalues and complex scattering sector eigenvalues. When\nwritten as contour integrals delta functions take support in the complex plane,\nwith the scattering amplitude being able to take support in the complex energy\nplane too. However, the scattering amplitude is $CPT$ symmetric (or $PT$\nsymmetric if $C$ is conserved), regardless of whether states are square\nintegrable or not. For resonance scattering this antilinear symmetry requires\nthe presence of a complex conjugate pair of energies, one to describe the\nexcitation of the resonance and the other to describe its decay, with it being\ntheir interplay that enforces probability conservation. Each complex pair of\nenergy eigenvalues corresponds to only one observable resonance not two. Our\nanalysis shows that the nonrelativistic square well problem with a real\npotential possesses $PT$ symmetry in both the bound and scattering sectors,\nwith there being complex conjugate pairs of energy eigenvalues in the\nscattering sector.",

However, our study reveals that when\nthe reasoning process starts with a short but poor beginning, it becomes\ndifficult for the model to recover. We refer to this phenomenon as the \"Prefix\nDominance Trap\". Inspired by psychological findings that peer interaction can\npromote self-correction without negatively impacting already accurate\nindividuals, we propose **Learning from Peers** (LeaP) to address this\nphenomenon. Specifically, every tokens, each reasoning path summarizes its\nintermediate reasoning and shares it with others through a routing mechanism,\nenabling paths to incorporate peer insights during inference. However, we\nobserve that smaller models sometimes fail to follow summarization and\nreflection instructions effectively. To address this, we fine-tune them into\nour **LeaP-T** model series. Experiments on AIME 2024, AIME 2025, AIMO 2025,\nand GPQA Diamond show that LeaP provides substantial improvements. For\ninstance, QwQ-32B with LeaP achieves nearly 5 absolute points higher than the\nbaseline on average, and surpasses DeepSeek-R1-671B on three math benchmarks\nwith an average gain of 3.3 points. Notably, our fine-tuned LeaP-T-7B matches\nthe performance of DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B on AIME 2024. In-depth analysis\nreveals LeaP's robust error correction by timely peer insights, showing strong\nerror tolerance and handling varied task difficulty. LeaP marks a milestone by\nenabling LRMs to collaborate during reasoning. Our code, datasets, and models\nare available at https://learning-from-peers.github.io/ .",

This possibly\nundifferentiated state contrasts sharply with the globally molten state\ninferred in its counterpart, Ganymede, and poses unique challenges to theories\nof the formation and evolution of the Galilean moons. During their formation,\nboth moons experienced multiple heating mechanisms, including tidal heating,\nradiogenic heating from short-lived radionuclides, accretional heating from\nimpacts, and heat from the surrounding circumplanetary disk. Our study\ninvestigates the optimal conditions required to account for Callisto's\npartially differentiated state in contrast to Ganymede's complete\ndifferentiation. We investigate crucial accretion parameters, such as the\ntiming of accretion onset, the duration of accretion, and the impactor size\ndistribution. We find that the observed dichotomy between Ganymede and Callisto\ncan be attributed to similar formation conditions, assuming an identical\nimpactor size distribution and composition in the Jovian circumplanetary disk.\nThe key differences in the formation of Ganymede and Callisto are the disk\ntemperature at their respective formation locations and their final radii. Our\nresults indicate that both moons accreted gradually over more than 2 Myr,\nconcluding at least 5.5 Myr after the formation of calcium-aluminum-rich\ninclusions in the protosolar nebula. Our model demonstrates that Callisto can\nremain undifferentiated despite accreting a substantial influx of\nkilometer-sized impactors, potentially contributing up to 30% of the total mass\ninflow, while still allowing for the complete differentiation of Ganymede.",

Model assembly is widely considered a promising solution to break\nthrough these performance bottlenecks. However, current ensembling methods are\nprimarily guided by the statistical expectation that combining multiple models\nover large samples will lead to performance gains. We propose an ensemble\nframework that transitions from such stochastic, sample-dependent methods to a\nregular, controllable approach based on fine-grained model segmentation. This\nregularity governs how models are segmented to ensure performance improvement,\nhow the magnitude of this improvement varies with model selection, and what\nfactors determine its theoretical maximum. To formalize this pattern, we\nintroduce the concept of'relative overfitting,' which is derived from the\nperformance discrepancies between constituent models and builds a bridge\nbetween ensemble outcomes and the inherent attributes of these models. We\ndetail the patterns of this framework within the domain of NLP and briefly\ndescribe its extensibility to other fields, such as computer vision (CV) and AI\nfor science. Our approach was validated using both custom-built and pre-trained\nmainstream models across diverse benchmarks, including language modeling,\nlong-context tasks, and question-answering (QA). The results indicate that the\nensemble rules we proposed are generally effective and that we provide a\nrigorous proof of these rules in certain experimental scenarios.

Moreover, AI systems are not only persuaders, but also\nsusceptible to persuasion, making them vulnerable to adversarial attacks and\nbias reinforcement. Despite rapid advancements in AI-generated persuasive\ncontent, our understanding of what makes persuasion effective remains limited\ndue to its inherently subjective and context-dependent nature. In this survey,\nwe provide a comprehensive overview of computational persuasion, structured\naround three key perspectives: (1) AI as a Persuader, which explores\nAI-generated persuasive content and its applications; (2) AI as a Persuadee,\nwhich examines AI's susceptibility to influence and manipulation; and (3) AI as\na Persuasion Judge, which analyzes AI's role in evaluating persuasive\nstrategies, detecting manipulation, and ensuring ethical persuasion. We\nintroduce a taxonomy for computational persuasion research and discuss key\nchallenges, including evaluating persuasiveness, mitigating manipulative\npersuasion, and developing responsible AI-driven persuasive systems. Our survey\noutlines future research directions to enhance the safety, fairness, and\neffectiveness of AI-powered persuasion while addressing the risks posed by\nincreasingly capable language models.",

Yet, standard practices in\nAI development often obscure or eliminate disagreement, resulting in an\nengineered homogenization that can be epistemically and ethically harmful,\nparticularly for marginalized groups. In this paper, we characterize this risk,\nand develop a normative framework to guide practical reasoning about\ndisagreement in the AI lifecycle. Our contributions are two-fold. First, we\nintroduce the notion of perspectival homogenization, characterizing it as a\ncoupled ethical-epistemic risk that arises when an aspect of an AI system's\ndevelopment unjustifiably suppresses disagreement and diversity of\nperspectives. We argue that perspectival homogenization is best understood as a\nprocedural risk, which calls for targeted interventions throughout the AI\ndevelopment pipeline. Second, we propose a normative framework to guide such\ninterventions, grounded in lines of research that explain why disagreement can\nbe epistemically beneficial, and how its benefits can be realized in practice.\nWe apply this framework to key design questions across three stages of AI\ndevelopment tasks: when disagreement is epistemically valuable; whose\nperspectives should be included and preserved; how to structure tasks and\nnavigate trade-offs; and how disagreement should be documented and\ncommunicated. In doing so, we challenge common assumptions in AI practice,\noffer a principled foundation for emerging participatory and pluralistic\napproaches, and identify actionable pathways for future work in AI design and\ngovernance.",

The plasma jet produces ionization\nwaves as guided positive streamers that reach the surface. Molecular beam mass\nspectrometry (MBMS) with an energy filter has been used to monitor the IEDFs at\na distance of 1.5 cm from the dielectric barrier discharge plasma jet exit. The\nspecies are sampled from the supersonic expanding helium beam passing into the\nMBMS through a 40 $\\mu$m (metal) or a 50 $\\mu$m (ceramic) diameter orifice.\nN$_2^+$, O$_2^+$, NO$^+$, O$_3^+$ and water cluster ions (H$_2$O)$_n$H$^+$\n(n=1...4) are abundantly produced in the discharge. The analysis of the\ntime-resolved IEDFs reveals that all ions are predominantly sampled at a\nreference energy $E_{\\rm beam}$ when using the metallic orifice. This energy\n$E_{\\rm beam}$ is determined by the seeding of the ions into the supersonic\nexpanding helium beam into the MBMS. After the impact of the streamer, an\nafterglow of 10 $\\mu$s is observed when ions are continuously sampled at an\nenergy higher than $E_{\\rm beam}$ by a few 0.1 eVs. This is resolved by\npostulating a positive space-charge region in front of a positively charged\nsurface. The temporal sequence of the ion impact is consistent with reaction\nschemes in air plasmas, where O$_2^+$ and N$_2^+$ are created before the\nformation of NO and O$_3$, as well as larger water cluster ions.",

Our approach facilitates iterative grounding by\ninterleaving code generation, inline comment generation, and contextualized\nuser feedback through editable comments to align generated code with developer\nintent. We evaluated our approach on two popular benchmarks and demonstrated\nthat our approach significantly improved multiple state-of-the-art LLMs, e.g.,\n17.1% pass@1 improvement for code-davinci-002 on HumanEval.

It is puzzling how the complicated physics in\nstar-formation results in this surprisingly simple proportionality. Using\narchival Herschel and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array\nObservations, we derived the masses of the most massive cores ($M^{\\rm\nmax}_{\\rm core}$) and masses of the gravitationally bound gas ($ M_{\\rm\ngas}^{\\rm bound}$) in the parent molecular clouds for a sample of low-mass and\nhigh-mass star-forming regions.

Our discovered $M^{\\rm max}_{\\rm core}$-$M_{\\rm\ngas}^{\\rm bound}$ correlation can be approximately converted to the Gao-Solomon\nrelation if there is (1) a constant 30% efficiency of converting $M^{\\rm\nmax}_{\\rm core}$ to the mass of the most massive star ($m^{\\rm max}_{\\rm\nstar}$), and (2) if SFR and $m^{\\rm max}_{\\rm star}$ are tightly related\nthrough $\\log({\\rm SFR}/(M_{\\odot} {\\rm yr}^{-1})) = 2.04 \\log(m^{\\rm max}_{\\rm\nstar}/M_{\\odot})-5.80$.

    "abstract": "Stars form from molecular gas under complex conditions influenced by multiple\ncompeting physical mechanisms, such as gravity, turbulence, and magnetic\nfields. However, accurately identifying the fraction of gas actively involved\nin star formation remains challenging. Using dust continuum observations from\nthe Herschel Space Observatory, we derived column density maps and their\nassociated probability distribution functions (N-PDFs). Assuming the power-law\ncomponent in the N-PDFs corresponds to gravitationally bound (and thus\nstar-forming) gas, we analyzed a diverse sample of molecular clouds spanning a\nwide range of mass and turbulence conditions. This sample included 21 molecular\nclouds from the solar neighborhood ($d<$500 pc) and 16 high-mass star-forming\nmolecular clouds. For these two groups, we employed the counts of young stellar\nobjects (YSOs) and mid-/far-infrared luminosities as proxies for star formation\nrates (SFR), respectively. Both groups revealed a tight linear correlation\nbetween the mass of gravitationally bound gas and the SFR, suggesting a\nuniversally constant star formation efficiency in the gravitationally bound gas\nphase. The star-forming gas mass derived from threshold column densities\n($N_{{\\mbox {threshold}}}$) varies from cloud to cloud and is widely\ndistributed over the range of $\\sim$1--17$\\times$10$^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$ based on\nN-PDF analysis. But in solar neighborhood clouds, it is in rough consistency\nwith the traditional approach using $A_{\\rm V}$ $\\ge$ 8 mag. In contrast, in\nhigh turbulent regions (e.g., the Central Molecular Zone) where the classical\napproach fails, the gravitationally bound gas mass and SFR still follow the\nsame correlation as other high-mass star-forming regions in the Milky Way. Our\nfindings also strongly support the interpretation that gas in the power-law\ncomponent of the N-PDF is undergoing self-gravitational collapse to form stars.",

We solve the penalized tractable\napproximation using a provably convergent algorithm with polynomial complexity.\nOur results highlight that, despite being conservative, the proposed solution\nresults in a similar power consumption as for the nominal power minimization\nproblem without channel uncertainties. Additionally, robust H-NOMA is shown to\nalmost always yield more power efficiency than the OMA case. Moreover, the\nrobustness of the proposed solution is manifested by a high probability of\nfeasibility of the robust design compared to the OMA and the nominal one.",

    "abstract": "We consider singular control in inventory management under Knightian\nuncertainty, where decision makers have a smooth ambiguity preference over\nGaussian-generated priors. We demonstrate that continuous-time smooth ambiguity\nis the infinitesimal limit of Kalman-Bucy filtering with recursive robust\nutility. Additionally, we prove that the cost function can be determined by\nsolving forward-backward stochastic differential equations with quadratic\ngrowth. With a sufficient condition and utilising variational inequalities in a\nviscosity sense, we derive the value function and optimal control policy. By\nthe change-of-coordinate technique, we transform the problem into\ntwo-dimensional singular control, offering insights into model learning and\naligning with classical singular control free boundary problems. We numerically\nimplement our theory using a Markov chain approximation, where inventory is\nmodeled as cash management following an arithmetic Brownian motion. Our\nnumerical results indicate that the continuation region can be divided into\nthree key areas: (i) the target region; (ii) the region where it is optimal to\nlearn and do nothing; and (iii) the region where control becomes predominant\nand learning should inactive. We demonstrate that ambiguity drives the decision\nmaker to act earlier, leading to a smaller continuation region. This effect\nbecomes more pronounced at the target region as the decision maker gains\nconfidence from a longer learning period. However, these dynamics do not extend\nto the third region, where learning is excluded.",

We find that broadband X-rays and UV emission lines are\ninsensitive to $M_{BH}$ and largely unable to distinguish between ULXs and\nIMBHs.

The docking analysis showed that the inhibitors formed multiple hydrogen\nbonds and occupied the same binding pockets as Phase 3 drug candidate. The\ntested inhibitors were derived from natural sources, which suggest reduced side\neffects and improved biocompability. This combined approach demonstrates the\npower of computational models in accelerating drug discovery, with implication\nfor more efficient and biocompatible therapies against Leishmania mexicana.",

    "abstract": "While generative artificial intelligence has advanced significantly across\ntext, image, audio, and video domains, 3D generation remains comparatively\nunderdeveloped due to fundamental challenges such as data scarcity, algorithmic\nlimitations, and ecosystem fragmentation. To this end, we present Step1X-3D, an\nopen framework addressing these challenges through: (1) a rigorous data\ncuration pipeline processing >5M assets to create a 2M high-quality dataset\nwith standardized geometric and textural properties; (2) a two-stage 3D-native\narchitecture combining a hybrid VAE-DiT geometry generator with an\ndiffusion-based texture synthesis module; and (3) the full open-source release\nof models, training code, and adaptation modules. For geometry generation, the\nhybrid VAE-DiT component produces TSDF representations by employing\nperceiver-based latent encoding with sharp edge sampling for detail\npreservation. The diffusion-based texture synthesis module then ensures\ncross-view consistency through geometric conditioning and latent-space\nsynchronization. Benchmark results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance\nthat exceeds existing open-source methods, while also achieving competitive\nquality with proprietary solutions. Notably, the framework uniquely bridges the\n2D and 3D generation paradigms by supporting direct transfer of 2D control\ntechniques~(e.g., LoRA) to 3D synthesis. By simultaneously advancing data\nquality, algorithmic fidelity, and reproducibility, Step1X-3D aims to establish\nnew standards for open research in controllable 3D asset generation.",

However, across\nfinancial applications, existing time-series pre-trained models have not shown\nboosts in performance over simple finance benchmarks in both zero-shot and\nfine-tuning settings.

Furthermore,\ntime-series data is continuous, noisy, and can be collected at varying\nfrequencies and with varying lags across different variables, making this data\nmore challenging to model than languages.

    "abstract": "The transition toward 6G is pushing wireless communication into a regime\nwhere the classical plane-wave assumption no longer holds. Millimeter-wave and\nsub-THz frequencies shrink wavelengths to millimeters, while meter-scale arrays\nfeaturing hundreds of antenna elements dramatically enlarge the aperture.\nTogether, these trends collapse the classical Rayleigh far-field boundary from\nkilometers to mere single-digit meters. Consequently, most practical 6G indoor,\nvehicular, and industrial deployments will inherently operate within the\nradiating near-field, where reliance on the plane-wave approximation leads to\nsevere array-gain losses, degraded localization accuracy, and excessive pilot\noverhead. This paper re-examines the fundamental question: Where does the\nfar-field truly begin? Rather than adopting purely geometric definitions, we\nintroduce an application-oriented approach based on user-defined error budgets\nand a rigorous Fresnel-zone analysis that fully accounts for both amplitude and\nphase curvature. We propose three practical mismatch metrics: worst-case\nelement mismatch, worst-case normalized mean square error, and spectral\nefficiency loss. For each metric, we derive a provably optimal transition\ndistance--the minimal range beyond which mismatch permanently remains below a\ngiven tolerance--and provide closed-form solutions. Extensive numerical\nevaluations across diverse frequencies and antenna-array dimensions show that\nour proposed thresholds can exceed the Rayleigh distance by more than an order\nof magnitude. By transforming the near-field from a design nuisance into a\nprecise, quantifiable tool, our results provide a clear roadmap for enabling\nreliable and resource-efficient near-field communications and sensing in\nemerging 6G systems.",

In this paper, we systematically evaluate the most influential\nsteady-state and fluid models describing BBR's coexistence with loss-based\nflows over shared bottleneck links. Our experiments, conducted on a new\nexperimental platform (FABRIC), extend previous evaluations to additional\nnetwork scenarios, enabling comparisons between the two models and include the\nrecently introduced BBRv3. Our findings confirm that the steady-state model\naccurately captures BBRv1 behavior, especially against single loss-based flows.\nThe fluid model successfully captures several key behaviors of BBRv1 and BBRv2\nbut shows limitations, in scenarios involving deep buffers, large numbers of\nflows, or intra-flow fairness. Importantly, we observe clear discrepancies\nbetween existing model predictions and BBRv3 behavior, suggesting the need for\nan updated or entirely new modeling approach for this latest version.

In this work, we assessed the\nability of reasoning models to perform chemistry tasks directly, without any\nassistance from external tools. We created a novel benchmark, called ChemIQ,\nconsisting of 816 questions assessing core concepts in organic chemistry,\nfocused on molecular comprehension and chemical reasoning. Unlike previous\nbenchmarks, which primarily use multiple choice formats, our approach requires\nmodels to construct short-answer responses, more closely reflecting real-world\napplications. The reasoning models, OpenAI's o3-mini, Google's Gemini Pro 2.5,\nand DeepSeek R1, answered 50%-57% of questions correctly in the highest\nreasoning modes, with higher reasoning levels significantly increasing\nperformance on all tasks. These models substantially outperformed the\nnon-reasoning models which achieved only 3%-7% accuracy. We found that Large\nLanguage Models can now convert SMILES strings to IUPAC names, a task earlier\nmodels were unable to perform. Additionally, we show that the latest reasoning\nmodels can elucidate structures from 1D and 2D 1H and 13C NMR data, with Gemini\nPro 2.5 correctly generating SMILES strings for around 90% of molecules\ncontaining up to 10 heavy atoms, and in one case solving a structure comprising\n25 heavy atoms.

    "abstract": "Detecting AI-synthetic faces presents a critical challenge: it is hard to\ncapture consistent structural relationships between facial regions across\ndiverse generation techniques. Current methods, which focus on specific\nartifacts rather than fundamental inconsistencies, often fail when confronted\nwith novel generative models. To address this limitation, we introduce\nLayer-aware Mask Modulation Vision Transformer (LAMM-ViT), a Vision Transformer\ndesigned for robust facial forgery detection. This model integrates distinct\nRegion-Guided Multi-Head Attention (RG-MHA) and Layer-aware Mask Modulation\n(LAMM) components within each layer. RG-MHA utilizes facial landmarks to create\nregional attention masks, guiding the model to scrutinize architectural\ninconsistencies across different facial areas. Crucially, the separate LAMM\nmodule dynamically generates layer-specific parameters, including mask weights\nand gating values, based on network context. These parameters then modulate the\nbehavior of RG-MHA, enabling adaptive adjustment of regional focus across\nnetwork depths. This architecture facilitates the capture of subtle,\nhierarchical forgery cues ubiquitous among diverse generation techniques, such\nas GANs and Diffusion Models. In cross-model generalization tests, LAMM-ViT\ndemonstrates superior performance, achieving 94.09% mean ACC (a +5.45%\nimprovement over SoTA) and 98.62% mean AP (a +3.09% improvement). These results\ndemonstrate LAMM-ViT's exceptional ability to generalize and its potential for\nreliable deployment against evolving synthetic media threats.",

This allows us to account for nonlinearities\nin the design for the sake of safety rather than treating them as disturbances.\nThis new controller parameterization and design approach reduces the\ncomputational complexity and the conservatism of designing a safe nonlinear\ncontroller.

A key motivating example is estimating long-term\ncausal effects in a new experiment with only short-term outcomes, using past\nexperiments to instrument for the effect of short- on long-term outcomes. Here,\nthe assignment to a past experiment serves as the instrument: we have many past\nexperiments but only a limited number of units in each. Since the structural\nfunction is nonparametric but constrained by only finitely many moment\nrestrictions, point identification typically fails. To address this, we\nconsider linear functionals of the minimum-norm solution to the moment\nrestrictions, which is always well-defined. As the number of instrument levels\ngrows, these functionals define an approximating sequence to a target\nfunctional, replacing point identification with a weaker asymptotic notion\nsuited to discrete instruments. Extending the Jackknife Instrumental Variable\nEstimator (JIVE) beyond the classical parametric setting, we propose npJIVE, a\nnonparametric estimator for solutions to linear inverse problems with many weak\ninstruments. We construct automatic debiased machine learning estimators for\nlinear functionals of both the structural function and its minimum-norm\nprojection, and establish their efficiency in the many-weak-instruments regime.\nTo do so, we develop a general semiparametric efficiency theory for regular\nestimators under weak identification and many-weak-instrument asymptotics.",

    "abstract": "Neural control variates (NCVs) have emerged as a powerful tool for variance\nreduction in Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, particularly in high-dimensional\nproblems where traditional control variates are difficult to construct\nanalytically. By training neural networks to learn auxiliary functions\ncorrelated with the target observable, NCVs can significantly reduce estimator\nvariance while preserving unbiasedness. However, a critical but often\noverlooked aspect of NCV training is the role of autocorrelated samples\ngenerated by Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). While such samples are typically\ndiscarded for error estimation due to their statistical redundancy, they may\ncontain useful information about the structure of the underlying probability\ndistribution that can benefit the training process. In this work, we\nsystematically examine the effect of using correlated configurations in\ntraining neural control variates. We demonstrate, both conceptually and\nnumerically, that training on correlated data can improve control variate\nperformance, especially in settings with limited computational resources. Our\nanalysis includes empirical results from $U(1)$ gauge theory and scalar field\ntheory, illustrating when and how autocorrelated samples enhance NCV\nconstruction. These findings provide practical guidance for the efficient use\nof MCMC data in training neural networks.",

    "abstract": "Centimeter-sized dust grains-pebbles-are necessary for planetesimal formation\nvia the streaming instability, they play an important role in forming\nprotoplanetary cores and giant planets, as well as enriching their atmospheres\nwith chemical elements. This work investigates the effect of luminosity\noutbursts on the abundance of pebbles and their ice mantles in protoplanetary\ndisks. We perform global simulations of formation and evolution of a\nself-gravitating viscous protoplanetary disk using the 2D hydrodynamic\nthin-disk FEOSAD code, which self-consistently reproduces luminosity outbursts.\nThe model includes thermal balance, dust evolution and its interaction with\ngas, development of magnetorotational instability, adsorption and desorption of\nfour volatile compounds (H$_2$O, CO$_2$, CH$_4$ and CO), and the feedback of\nice mantles on dust fragmentation properties. We show that luminosity outbursts\nhave a stronger effect on the positions of CO$_2$, CH$_4$ and CO snowlines\ncompared to the water snowline. This is because the H$_2$O snowline falls\nwithin the viscous heating dominated region during early disk evolution stages,\nwhile snowlines of other molecules are located in regions dominated by stellar\nirradiation heating and are thus more sensitive to temperature changes during\noutbursts. Nevertheless, luminosity outbursts reduce the total amount of\npebbles in the disk by half due to destruction of dust aggregates into monomers\nfollowing the loss of water ice that binds the aggregates together. Pebble\nrecovery occurs over several thousand years after the outburst ends due to\ncollisional coagulation, with recovery timescales significantly exceeding water\nfreeze-out times. Ice mantle desorption occurs in a complex non-axisymmetric 2D\nregion of the disk, associated with spiral substructure formation during early\nevolution of gravitationally unstable disks.",

This dataset, captured using an event-based camera, ensures\nfacial privacy protection and reduces memory usage due to the event\nrepresentation format.

The goal of this paper is to investigate the\nsecurity of Ethereum's PoS system from an Internet routing perspective.\n  To this end, this paper makes two contributions: First, we devise a novel\nframework for inferring the distribution of validators on the Internet without\ndisturbing the real network. Second, we introduce a class of network-level\nattacks on Ethereum's PoS system that jointly exploit Internet routing\nvulnerabilities with the protocol's reward and penalty mechanisms. We describe\ntwo representative attacks: StakeBleed, where the attacker triggers an\ninactivity leak, halting block finality and causing financial losses for all\nvalidators; and KnockBlock, where the attacker increases her expected MEV gains\nby preventing targeted blocks from being included in the chain. We find that\nboth attacks are practical and effective. An attacker executing StakeBleed can\ninflict losses of almost 300 ETH in just 2 hours by hijacking as few as 30 IP\nprefixes. An attacker implementing KnockBlock could increase their MEV expected\ngains by 44.5% while hijacking a single prefix for less than 2 minutes.\n  Our paper serves as a call to action for validators to reinforce their\nInternet routing infrastructure and for the Ethereum P2P protocol to implement\nstronger mechanisms to conceal validator locations.",

Each profile defines a set of functions\nparse_by_scene(scene) that outputs a list of logic-grounded assertions\ntriggered_statements, using both explicit control structures (e.g.,\nif-then-else) and condition checks like check_condition(scene, question), where\neach question is a semantically meaningful prompt about the scene (e.g., \"Is\nthe character in danger?\") discriminated by the role-playing LLM as true,\nfalse, or unknown. This explicit representation offers three key advantages\nover traditional prompt-based profiles, which append character descriptions\ndirectly into text prompts: (1) Persistence, by enforcing complete and\nconsistent execution of character logic, rather than relying on the model's\nimplicit reasoning; (2) Updatability, through systematic inspection and\nrevision of behavioral logic, which is difficult to track or debug in\nprompt-only approaches; (3) Controllable Randomness, by supporting stochastic\nbehavior directly within the logic, enabling fine-grained variability that\nprompting alone struggles to achieve. To validate these advantages, we\nintroduce a new benchmark constructed from 83 characters and 5,141 scenes\ncurated from Fandom, using NLI-based scoring to compare character responses\nagainst ground-truth actions. Our experiments demonstrate the significant\nbenefits of codified profiles in improving persistence, updatability, and\nbehavioral diversity.

    "abstract": "Diabetes is one of the most prevalent diseases worldwide, characterized by\npersistently high blood sugar levels, capable of damaging various internal\norgans and systems. Diabetes patients require routine check-ups, resulting in a\ntime series of laboratory records, such as hemoglobin A1c, which reflects each\npatient's health behavior over time and informs their doctor's recommendations.\nClustering patients into groups based on their entire time series data assists\ndoctors in making recommendations and choosing treatments without the need to\nreview all records. However, time series clustering of this type of dataset\nintroduces some challenges; patients visit their doctors at different time\npoints, making it difficult to capture and match trends, peaks, and patterns.\nAdditionally, two aspects must be considered: differences in the levels of\nlaboratory results and differences in trends and patterns. To address these\nchallenges, we introduce a new clustering algorithm called Time and Trend\nTraveling Time Series Clustering (4TaStiC), using a base dissimilarity measure\ncombined with Euclidean and Pearson correlation metrics. We evaluated this\nalgorithm on artificial datasets, comparing its performance with that of seven\nexisting methods. The results show that 4TaStiC outperformed the other methods\non the targeted datasets. Finally, we applied 4TaStiC to cluster a cohort of\n1,989 type 2 diabetes patients at Siriraj Hospital.

We analyze 338 pull requests from 255\nGitHub repositories containing self-admitted ChatGPT usage, including 645\nAI-generated snippets and 3,486 developer-authored patches. We introduce\nPatchTrack, a tool that classifies whether ChatGPT patches were applied, not\napplied, or not suggested, enabling fine-grained analysis of AI-assisted\ndecisions. Full adoption of ChatGPT code is rare: the median integration rate\nwas 25%. A qualitative analysis of 89 pull requests with integrated patches\nrevealed recurring patterns of structural integration, selective extraction,\nand iterative refinement, showing that developers typically treat ChatGPT's\noutput as a starting point rather than a final implementation. Even when code\nwas not directly adopted, ChatGPT influenced workflows through conceptual\nguidance, documentation, and debugging strategies. Integration decisions were\nshaped by scope, architectural fit, contributor role, and review norms. This\nstudy offers empirical insight into how generative AI is used in collaborative\nsoftware development, showing that its impact extends beyond patch generation\nto broader decision-making.

A common practice in pseudo-supervision is\nfiltering pseudo-labels based on pre-defined confidence thresholds or entropy.\nHowever, selecting optimal thresholds requires large labeled datasets, which\nare often scarce in real-world semi-supervised scenarios. To overcome this\nchallenge, we propose Ensemble-of-Confidence Reinforcement (ENCORE), a dynamic\nfeedback-driven thresholding strategy for pseudo-label selection. Instead of\nrelying on static confidence thresholds, ENCORE estimates class-wise\ntrue-positive confidence within the unlabeled dataset and continuously adjusts\nthresholds based on the model's response to different levels of pseudo-label\nfiltering. This feedback-driven mechanism ensures the retention of informative\npseudo-labels while filtering unreliable ones, enhancing model training without\nmanual threshold tuning.

This structured representation\nimproves semantic reasoning, interpretability, and cross-modal alignment,\nultimately enhancing the accuracy and clinical relevance of generated reports.\nExperimental results on IU X-Ray and MIMIC-CXR datasets demonstrate that A3Net\nsignificantly improves both visual perception and text generation quality.

    "abstract": "Data heterogeneity across multiple sources is common in real-world machine\nlearning (ML) settings. Although many methods focus on enabling a single model\nto handle diverse data, real-world markets often comprise multiple competing ML\nproviders. In this paper, we propose a game-theoretic framework -- the\nHeterogeneous Data Game -- to analyze how such providers compete across\nheterogeneous data sources. We investigate the resulting pure Nash equilibria\n(PNE), showing that they can be non-existent, homogeneous (all providers\nconverge on the same model), or heterogeneous (providers specialize in distinct\ndata sources). Our analysis spans monopolistic, duopolistic, and more general\nmarkets, illustrating how factors such as the \"temperature\" of data-source\nchoice models and the dominance of certain data sources shape equilibrium\noutcomes. We offer theoretical insights into both homogeneous and heterogeneous\nPNEs, guiding regulatory policies and practical strategies for competitive ML\nmarketplaces.",

    "abstract": "As Test-Time Scaling emerges as an active research focus in the large\nlanguage model community, advanced post-training methods increasingly emphasize\nextending chain-of-thought (CoT) generation length, thereby enhancing reasoning\ncapabilities to approach Deepseek R1-like reasoning models. However, recent\nstudies reveal that reasoning models (even Qwen3) consistently exhibit\nexcessive thought redundancy in CoT generation. This overthinking issue arises\nfrom the inherent limitations of conventional outcome-reward reinforcement\nlearning, which systematically overlooks the regulation of intermediate\nreasoning processes. This paper introduces Serial-Group Decaying-Reward Policy\nOptimization (S-GRPO), a novel reinforcement learning paradigm that enables\nmodels to implicitly evaluate the sufficiency of intermediate reasoning steps,\nthereby facilitating early exit in CoT generation. Unlike GRPO, which samples\nmultiple possible reasoning paths in parallel (parallel group), S-GRPO only\nsamples one reasoning path and serially selects multiple temporal positions\nfrom the path to exit thinking and directly generate answers (serial group).\nFor correct answers within a serial group, rewards gradually decrease based on\nthe exit positions along the reasoning path from front to back. This design\nencourages the model to produce more accurate and concise thoughts, while also\nincentivizing early thinking termination when appropriate. Empirical\nevaluations demonstrate that S-GRPO is compatible with state-of-the-art\nreasoning models, including Qwen3 and Deepseek-distill. Across diverse\nbenchmarks such as GSM8K, AIME 2024, AMC 2023, MATH-500, and GPQA Diamond,\nS-GRPO achieves a substantial reduction in sequence length (35.4% - 61.1%)\nwhile simultaneously improving accuracy (absolute 0.72% - 6.08%).",

The interaction\nbetween the star and its circumstellar disk is time-dependent, leading to short\nor long-term changes in the environment, and hence variability of the system.\nBy compiling a large dataset with high-cadence photometric (Kepler, TESS), and\nhigh-resolution spectroscopic observations (CFHT/ESPaDOnS) of the highly\nvariable T Tauri star DR Tau, we aim to examine the short- and long-term\nvariability of the system, and identify the underlying physical mechanisms. Our\nresults reveal that DR Tau exhibits stochastic photometric variability not only\non daily, but also on hourly timescale with peak-to-peak amplitude of 1.4 mag\nprobably originating from accretion related variations. Our ground-based\nmultifilter photometry shows that the amplitude of the variability decreases\nwith increasing wavelength. This trend towards the infrared wavelengths\nsuggests that part of the disk may be optically thick and invariable. The\nspectroscopic analysis showed that the H$\\alpha$ line presents the most complex\nline profile with several components but the significance of the components\nchanges over time. This suggests the presence and variation of both accretion\nflow and wind. Broad and narrow components can be clearly distinguished in the\nHe I and the Ca II lines, suggesting contribution from both the accretion flow\nand the post-shock region. DR Tau exhibits high level of photometric and\nspectroscopic variability on both short- and long-timescales, which is caused\nby the combination of accretion, wind, stellar activity, and obscuration by\ncircumstellar matter; and the significance of the physical mechanisms causing\nthe observed variability changes over time.",

As a benchmark\nwe consider the Nusselt number, defined as the average vertical heat transport\nof a convective flow. A set of formulae are derived which give the ODE\nprojection of the BC model onto any finite selection of modes. It is proven\nthat projected ODE models obey energy relations consistent with the PDE if and\nonly if a mode selection Criterion regarding the vertical resolution is\nsatisfied. It is also proven that the energy relations imply the existence of a\ncompact attractor for these ODE's, which then implies bounds on the Nusselt\nnumber. By contrast, it is proven that a broad class of energetically\ninconsistent models admit solutions with unbounded, exponential growth,\nprecluding the existence of a compact attractor and giving an infinite Nusselt\nnumber. On the other hand, certain energetically inconsistent models can admit\ncompact attractors as shown via a simple model. The above formulas are\nimplemented in MATLAB, enabling a user to study any desired Fourier truncated\nmodel by selecting a desired finite set of Fourier modes. All code is made\navailable on GitHub.

It introduces a spatiotemporal modeling\napproach that integrates Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) with Gated\nRecurrent Units (GRU). The GCN component captures spatial dependencies among\nnetwork nodes, while the GRU component models the temporal evolution of traffic\ndata. This combination allows for precise forecasting of future traffic\npatterns. The effectiveness of the proposed model is validated through\ncomprehensive experiments on the real-world Abilene network traffic dataset.\nThe model is benchmarked against several popular deep learning methods.\nFurthermore, a set of ablation experiments is conducted to examine the\ninfluence of various components on performance, including changes in the number\nof graph convolution layers, different temporal modeling strategies, and\nmethods for constructing the adjacency matrix. Results indicate that the\nproposed approach achieves superior performance across multiple metrics,\ndemonstrating robust stability and strong generalization capabilities in\ncomplex network traffic forecasting scenarios.",

In\nthis work, we characterise this phenomenon, called temporal aiming, for water\nwaves using a time-varying metabathymetry. This metabathymetry is composed of\nthin vertical plates that are periodically arranged at the fluid bottom and\nwhich act as an effective anisotropic medium for the surface wave in the\nlong-wavelength approximation. When this plate array is vertically lifted at\nthe fluid bottom at a given time, the medium switches from isotropic to\nanisotropic, causing a wavepacket to scatter in time and deflect from its\ninitial trajectory. Following a simple modelling, we obtain the scattering\ncoefficients of the two waves generated due to the sudden medium change as well\nas the angle of deviation with respect to the incident angle. We then\nnumerically evaluate this scattering problem with simulations of the full 2D\neffective anisotropic wave equation, with a time-dependent anisotropy tensor.\nFinally, we provide experimental evidence of the temporal aiming, using space\ntime resolved measurement techniques, demonstrating the trajectory shift of a\nwavepacket and measuring its angle of deviation.",

UAV networks are susceptible to several security threats,\nsuch as wormhole, jamming, spoofing, and false data injection. Time Delay\nAttack (TDA) is a unique attack in which malicious UAVs intentionally delay\npacket forwarding, posing significant threats, especially in time-sensitive\napplications. It is challenging to distinguish malicious delay from benign\nnetwork delay due to the dynamic nature of UAV networks, intermittent wireless\nconnectivity, or the Store-Carry-Forward (SCF) mechanism during multi-hop\ncommunication. Some existing works propose machine learning-based centralized\napproaches to detect TDA, which are computationally intensive and have large\nmessage overheads. This paper proposes a novel approach DATAMUt, where the\ntemporal dynamics of the network are represented by a weighted time-window\ngraph (TWiG), and then two deterministic polynomial-time algorithms are\npresented to detect TDA when UAVs have global and local network knowledge.\nSimulation studies show that the proposed algorithms have reduced message\noverhead by a factor of five and twelve in global and local knowledge,\nrespectively, compared to existing approaches. Additionally, our approaches\nachieve approximately 860 and 1050 times less execution time in global and\nlocal knowledge, respectively, outperforming the existing methods.",

The system is further\nenhanced with wearable haptic feedback functions to align better with the\n\"Marionette\" metaphor, and a user study has been conducted to validate its\nefficacy with and without the haptic channel enabled. Considering the\nimportance of robot independence, the TelePhysicalOperation interface\nincorporates autonomy modules to face, for example, the teleoperation of\ndual-arm mobile base robots for bimanual object grasping and transportation\ntasks.\n  With the laser-guided interface, the user can indicate points of interest to\nthe robot through the utilization of a simple but effective laser emitter\ndevice. With a neural network-based vision system, the robot tracks the laser\nprojection in real time, allowing the user to indicate not only fixed goals,\nlike objects, but also paths to follow.

The behavior is modeled using Behavior Trees, exploiting\ntheir reactivity to promptly respond to changes in goal positions, and their\nmodularity to adapt the motion planning to the task needs.

Spiking\nneural networks (SNNs) operate through discrete spike events and offer superior\nenergy efficiency, providing a bio-inspired alternative. However, current\nANN-to-SNN conversion often results in significant accuracy loss and increased\ninference time due to conversion errors such as clipping, quantization, and\nuneven activation. This paper proposes a novel ANN-to-SNN conversion framework\nbased on error compensation learning. We introduce a learnable threshold\nclipping function, dual-threshold neurons, and an optimized membrane potential\ninitialization strategy to mitigate the conversion error. Together, these\ntechniques address the clipping error through adaptive thresholds, dynamically\nreduce the quantization error through dual-threshold neurons, and minimize the\nnon-uniformity error by effectively managing the membrane potential.\nExperimental results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet datasets show that our\nmethod achieves high-precision and ultra-low latency among existing conversion\nmethods. Using only two time steps, our method significantly reduces the\ninference time while maintains competitive accuracy of 94.75% on CIFAR-10\ndataset under ResNet-18 structure.

The transient was first detected with the Wide-field X-ray\nTelescope as an intense flare lasting for ~100 s, reaching a luminosity of\nL_(0.5-4 keV)~10^48 erg/s at z=0.748. Further observations with EP's Follow-up\nX-ray Telescope reveal a huge drop in the X-ray flux by a factor of >1000\nwithin 1.5 days. After maintaining a nearly plateau phase for ~7 days, the\nX-ray flux declines as t^-1.2 over a period of ~30 days, followed by a sudden\ndecrease to an undetectable level by EP and XMM-Newton, making it the longest\nafterglow emission detected among known fast X-ray transients. A bright\ncounterpart at optical and radio wavelengths was also detected, with high peak\nluminosities in excess of 10^44 erg/s and 10^41 erg/s, respectively. In\naddition, EP241021a exhibits a non-thermal X-ray spectrum, red optical color,\nX-ray and optical rebrightenings in the light curves, and fast radio spectral\nevolution, suggesting that relativistic jets may have been launched. We discuss\npossible origins of EP241021a, including a choked jet with supernova shock\nbreakout, a merger-triggered magnetar, a highly structured jet, and a repeating\npartial tidal disruption event involving an intermediate-mass black hole, but\nnone can perfectly explain the multiwavelength properties. EP241021a may\nrepresent a new type of X-ray transients with months-duration evolution\ntimescales, and future EP detections and follow-up observations of similar\nsystems will provide statistical samples to understand the underlying\nmechanisms at work.",

Despite biological plausibility, no study\nto date has investigated how exposure to fine particulate matter air pollution\n(PM$_{2.5}$) may contribute to risk of heat-related hospitalization.\n  Methods: We identified Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries who experienced\na heat-related hospitalization between 2008 and 2016. Using a case-crossover\ndesign and fitting Bayesian conditional logistic regression models, we\ncharacterized the association between heat-related hospitalization and\ntemperature and PM$_{2.5}$ exposures. We estimated the relative excess risk due\nto interaction (RERI) to quantify the additive-scale interaction of\nsimultaneous exposure to heat and PM$_{2.5}$.\n  Results: We observed 112,969 heat-related hospitalizations. Fixing PM$_{2.5}$\nat the case day median, increasing temperature from its case day median to the\n95th percentile was associated with an odds ratio of 1.045 (95% CI: 1.026,\n1.063). Fixing temperature at the case day median and increasing PM$_{2.5}$\nfrom its median to the 95th percentile was associated with an odds ratio of\n1.014 (95% CI: 0.993, 1.037). We estimated the RERI associated with\nsimultaneous median-to-95th percentile increases in temperature and PM$_{2.5}$\nto be 0.032 (0.007, 0.057).\n  Conclusion: Using nationwide Medicare claims and a self-matched study design,\nwe found evidence supporting synergism between temperature and PM$_{2.5}$\nexposures on the risk of heat-related hospitalization.",

Traditional convolutional neural networks\ntypically process the entire images regardless of information density, leading\nto computational inefficiency and potential focus on irrelevant features. Our\napproach leverages a dynamic selection mechanism that uses coarse attention\ndistilled by fine multi-head attention from the downstream layers of the model,\nallowing the model to identify and extract the most salient k pixels, where k\nis adaptively learned during training based on loss convergence trends. Once\nthe top-k pixels are selected, the model processes only these pixels, embedding\nthem as words in a language model to capture their semantics, followed by\nmulti-head attention to incorporate global context. For biological cell images,\nwe demonstrate that SparseAttnNet can process approximately 15% of the pixels\ninstead of the full image. Applied to cell classification tasks using white\nblood cells images from the following modalities: optical path difference (OPD)\nimages from digital holography for stain-free cells, images from\nmotion-sensitive (event) camera from stain-free cells, and brightfield\nmicroscopy images of stained cells, For all three imaging modalities,\nSparseAttnNet achieves competitive accuracy while drastically reducing\ncomputational requirements in terms of both parameters and floating-point\noperations per second, compared to traditional CNNs and Vision Transformers.\nSince the model focuses on biologically relevant regions, it also offers\nimproved explainability.

Such codes are defined by a schedule of error-detecting\nmeasurements, which allows for flexibility in their construction. In this work,\nwe ask how best to optimise the measurement schedule of dynamically condensed\ncolour codes in various limits of noise bias. We take a particular focus on the\nsetting where measurements introduce more noise than unitary and idling\noperations - a noise model relevant to some hardware proposals. For\nmeasurement-biased noise models, we improve code performance by strategically\nrepeating measurements within the schedule. For unbiased or $Z$-biased noise\nmodels, we find repeating measurements offers little improvement - somewhat\ncontrary to our expectations - and investigate why this is. To perform this\nanalysis, we generalise a metric called the teraquop footprint to the teraquop\nvolume. This is the product of the number of qubits and number of rounds of\nmeasurements required such that the probability of a spacelike or timelike\nlogical error occurring is less than $10^{-12}$. In most cases, we find\ndifferences in performance are primarily due to the number of rounds of\nmeasurements required, rather than the number of qubits - emphasising the\nimportance of using the teraquop volume in the analysis. Additionally, our\nresults provide another example of the importance of making use of correlated\nerrors when decoding, in that using belief matching rather than minimum-weight\nperfect matching can turn a worst-performing code under a given noise model\ninto a best-performing code.",

    "abstract": "Recently developed convergence theory for Anderson acceleration (AA) assumes\nthat the AA optimization norm matches the norm of the Hilbert space that the\nfixed point function is defined on. While this seems a natural assumption, it\nmay not be the optimal choice in terms of convergence of the iteration or\ncomputational efficiency. For the Picard iteration for the Navier-Stokes\nequations (NSE), the associated Hilbert space norm is $H^1_0(\\Omega),$ which is\ninefficient to implement in a large scale HPC setting since it requires\nmultiplication of global coefficient vectors by the stiffness matrix. Motivated\nby recent numerical tests that show using the $\\ell^2$ norm produces similar\nconvergence behavior as $H^1_0$ does, we revisit the convergence theory of\n[Pollock et al, {\\it SINUM} 2019] and find that i) it can be improved with a\nsharper treatment of the nonlinear terms; and ii) in the case that the AA\noptimization norm is changed to $L^2$ (and by extension $\\ell^2$ or $L^2$ using\na diagonally lumped mass matrix), a new convergence theory is developed that\nprovides an essentially equivalent estimate as the $H^1_0$ case. Several\nnumerical tests illustrate the new theory, and the theory and tests reveal that\none can interchangeably use the norms $H^1_0$, $L^2$, $\\ell^2$ or $L^2$ with\ndiagonally lumped mass matrix for the AA optimization problem without\nsignificantly affecting the overall convergence behavior.

We find evidence of ideological opposition among clusters of users\nin both samples, and a temporal association between toxicity and structural\ndivergence for at least two ideologically opposed clusters in our samples.\nThese observations support the importance of analyzing polarization as a\nmultifaceted dynamic phenomenon where polarization dynamics may also manifest\nin unexpected ways such as within a single ideological camp.",

The problem becomes more difficult in low-sample regimes, where\nthe Sample Covariance Matrix (SCM) becomes ill-conditioned. To capture the ICM\nand high noise floor, we model the covariance matrix using a ``Banded+Spiked''\nstructure. Since the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) for this model is\nnon-convex, we propose a convex relaxation which is formulated as a Frobenius\nnorm minimization with non-smooth convex constraints enforcing banded sparsity.\nThis relaxation serves as a provable upper bound for the non-convex likelihood\nmaximization and extends to cases where the covariance matrix dimension exceeds\nthe number of samples.

We develop two complementary models for\nclustering transcription factors at binding site sensors that allow us to study\ninformation transfer from a signal to a variable relevant to development,\nnamely future cell fates, on the example of the signal morphogen Bicoid in\nearly fly development. We find that weak cooperativity or clustering can allow\nfor maximal information transfer, especially about the relevant variable.

Achieving this also requires an\nadaptive memory system and energy-efficient hardware-software co-design,\nenabling real-time action in dynamic environments. This paper introduces a\nunified framework for the Neural Brain of embodied agents, addressing two\nfundamental challenges: (1) defining the core components of Neural Brain and\n(2) bridging the gap between static AI models and the dynamic adaptability\nrequired for real-world deployment. To this end, we propose a biologically\ninspired architecture that integrates multimodal active sensing,\nperception-cognition-action function, neuroplasticity-based memory storage and\nupdating, and neuromorphic hardware/software optimization. Furthermore, we also\nreview the latest research on embodied agents across these four aspects and\nanalyze the gap between current AI systems and human intelligence. By\nsynthesizing insights from neuroscience, we outline a roadmap towards the\ndevelopment of generalizable, autonomous agents capable of human-level\nintelligence in real-world scenarios.",

We\nhypothesize, however, that the difficulty of applying MixIT to MSS arises from\nthe ill-posed nature of MSS itself, where stem definitions are\napplication-dependent and models lack explicit knowledge of what should or\nshould not be separated, rather than from high inter-source correlation. While\nMixIT does not assume any source model and struggles with such ambiguities, our\npreliminary experiments show that it can still separate instruments to some\nextent, suggesting its potential for unsupervised pre-training. Motivated by\nthese insights, this study investigates MixIT-based pre-training for MSS. We\nfirst pre-train a model on in-the-wild, unlabeled data from the Free Music\nArchive using MixIT, and then fine-tune it on MUSDB18 with supervision.

    "abstract": "This work examines aging effects in thin-film stacks studied by picosecond\nacoustics experiments. The method uses a strain wave created by the absorption\nof a laser pulse in the top metal transducer layer to study the inner structure\nand properties of multilayers. We show that significant changes in measured\nsignals developed over time, rapidly after sample deposition and continuing for\nmonths. Most apparent was the evolution of the thermal exponential background\nof the signal, but close inspection showed modifications also in the shape of\nthe echoes and the phase of the Brillouin oscillations. We revealed that these\nchanges originate from the titanium transducer layer exposed to the ambient\natmosphere. The aging process involves both - irreversible Ti oxidation and\nreversible gas/water vapor adsorption. Importantly, these aging effects can be\neliminated by passivating the Ti layer with a thin 10 nm Si3N4 coating,\nproviding a simple solution for ensuring long-term measurement stability.",

Technically, the framework fuses knowledge graphs, RAG\nretrieval, and educational assessment theory into a single pipeline. Domain\npassages are parsed into a structured graph; graph-aware retrieval feeds fact\nchains to an LLM; and an assessment layer governed by Bloom's Taxonomy levels\nand Item Response Theory (IRT) transforms those chains into psychometrically\nsound questions. This cross-disciplinary marriage yields two scholarly\ncontributions: it shows how semantic graph contexts guide LLM reasoning paths,\nand it operationalizes difficulty metrics within the generation process,\nproducing items whose IRT parameters match expert benchmarks. Every module,\nfrom KG construction scripts to the multi-agent reasoning scheduler and the\nautomatic IRT validator, is openly released on GitHub. This enables peer\nlaboratories to replicate experiments, benchmark against baselines, and extend\nindividual components without licensing barriers.

As copper faces\nlimitations at the nanoscale, tungsten and ruthenium have emerged as promising\nalternatives due to their substantial phonon contributions to thermal\nconductivity. Metals with stronger phonon-mediated thermal transport are\nparticularly advantageous in nanoscale architectures, where phonons are less\nsensitive to size effects than electrons. Here, we show that phonons play a\ncomparable role to electrons in the thermal transport of ruthenium and tungsten\nthin films, evidenced by deviations from the classical Wiedemann-Franz law.\nElevated Lorenz numbers-1.9 and 2.7 times the Sommerfeld value for ruthenium\nand tungsten, respectively-indicate phonon contributions of 45% and 62% to\ntotal thermal conductivity. Comparisons of in-plane thermal conductivity from\nsteady-state thermoreflectance and electron relaxation times from infrared\nellipsometry reveal that phonon-mediated transport is insensitive to\nmicrostructural variations and scaling. Ultrafast infrared pump-probe\nmeasurements show that ruthenium exhibits a higher electron-phonon coupling\nfactor than tungsten, consistent with the differing contributions of carriers\nto thermal transport. Molecular dynamics simulations and spectral energy\ndensity analysis confirm substantial phonon-driven thermal transport and\nmode-dependent phonon lifetimes.

    "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) become widely deployed, concerns about their\nsafety and alignment grow. An approach to steer LLM behavior, such as\nmitigating biases or defending against jailbreaks, is to identify which parts\nof a prompt influence specific aspects of the model's output. Token-level\nattribution methods offer a promising solution, but still struggle in text\ngeneration, explaining the presence of each token in the output separately,\nrather than the underlying semantics of the entire LLM response. We introduce\nConceptX, a model-agnostic, concept-level explainability method that identifies\nthe concepts, i.e., semantically rich tokens in the prompt, and assigns them\nimportance based on the outputs' semantic similarity. Unlike current\ntoken-level methods, ConceptX also offers to preserve context integrity through\nin-place token replacements and supports flexible explanation goals, e.g.,\ngender bias. ConceptX enables both auditing, by uncovering sources of bias, and\nsteering, by modifying prompts to shift the sentiment or reduce the harmfulness\nof LLM responses, without requiring retraining. Across three LLMs, ConceptX\noutperforms token-level methods like TokenSHAP in both faithfulness and human\nalignment. Steering tasks boost sentiment shift by 0.252 versus 0.131 for\nrandom edits and lower attack success rates from 0.463 to 0.242, outperforming\nattribution and paraphrasing baselines. While prompt engineering and\nself-explaining methods sometimes yield safer responses, ConceptX offers a\ntransparent and faithful alternative for improving LLM safety and alignment,\ndemonstrating the practical value of attribution-based explainability in\nguiding LLM behavior.",

In this\nsystem, the coupling between the magnon and photon generates the cavity magnon\npolaritons. When driving the photon-like polariton mode, the bistability can\nundergo a sudden transition with the increase of the driving power, resulting\nin an explosive growth of the bistable region by several times. Conversely,\ndriving the magnon-like polariton mode only gives rise to normal bistability.\nThis depends on whether the minimum driving power required to generate the\nbistability is non-monotonic with respect to the driving frequency. In\naddition, despite driving only the photon-like polariton mode, the photon- and\nmagnon-like polariton modes can show simultaneous explosive growth of the\nbistability in microwave transmission, owing to the light-matter interaction.\nOur research sheds light on the hidden side of the nonlinear cavity magnonic\nsystem and provides a potential application for cavity spintronic devices\nfounded on this novel feature.",

In this study, we conducted a search for\nexozodi candidates within 10 parsecs using the Reyl'e sample. We performed\nproper motion calculations and cross-matched the sample with the WISE and 2MASS\ndatabase, resulting in 339 preliminary target samples. We further analysed the\ninfrared radiation characteristics of these targets, using spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) fitting to predict photometric flux levels in the infrared\nand searching for 3sigma excesses in the WISE W3 band. During further selection\nprocesses, we applied various analysis methods to perform rigorous validation.\nWe identified five exozodi candidates all of which are brown dwarfs (BDs).\nGiven the clustering in candidate spectral types, we expect that these are not\ntrue exozodi candidates, rather the apparent excess arises from the inability\nof the BD photosphere models to accurately represent the SEDs of objects at the\nL-T transition. Indeed, for the object DENIS J025503.3-470049, excess is likely\ndue to silicate clouds in the BD atmosphere. We suggest that a more stringent\n5sigma excess is required to infer excess for this spectral type. The detection\nrate (0/339) in our sample shows that less than 1% M stars have exozodi above\n21% excess levels. This is consistent with the rate of exozodi at similar level\ntowards FGK stars in the Kennedy & Wyatt sample (25/24,174). We provide upper\nlimits on the 12 micron exozodi emission for the sample, which is typically at\n21% relative to the star.

Using linear mixed-effects modeling we demonstrate successful\ndistinctions of within-task workload levels and cross-task cognitive states\nbased on the spectral power data derived from the MUSE 2 device. With machine\nlearning we further show reliable predictive power to differentiate between\nworkload levels in the N-Back task, and also achieve effective cross-task\nclassification. These findings demonstrate that consumer-grade EEG devices like\nthe MUSE 2 can be used to effectively differentiate between various levels of\ncognitive workload as well as among more nuanced task-based cognitive states,\nand that these tools can be leveraged for real-time adaptive BCI applications\nin practical settings.",

We evaluate 19 LLMs across seven model families and uncover\nsubstantial variation in performance across constraint forms. For instance,\naverage performance drops from 77.67% at Level I to 32.96% at Level IV.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate the utility of our approach by using it to generate\ndata for reinforcement learning, achieving substantial gains in instruction\nfollowing without degrading general performance. In-depth analysis indicates\nthat these gains stem primarily from modifications in the model's attention\nmodules parameters, which enhance constraint recognition and adherence.

Previous observations from Spitzer and Herschel showed no\nsign of outer cold dust within their respective detection limits. Additional\nnulling and high-contrast AO observations were taken to spatially constrain the\ndust distribution, search for variability, and directly image potential\ncompanions in the system. This study presents the results of these observations\nand provides an interpretation of the inner system's architecture. The star was\nobserved using the LBTI's N'-band nulling mode during three epochs in 2017,\n2018, and 2023. The dust distribution is modeled and constrained for each epoch\nusing the standard LBTI nulling pipeline, assuming a vertically thin disk with\na face-on inclination. In addition, high-contrast AO observations are performed\nin the L'-band and H-band to constrain the presence of substellar companions\naround the star. Several solutions are found for the dust distribution, and for\neach epoch. However, the LBTI nulling observations are not able to discriminate\nbetween them. Using the upper limits from previous observations, we constrain\nthe representative size of the dust grains around 3-5$\\mu$m. A tentative\nincrease in dust brightness is also measured at the Earth-equivalent insolation\ndistance between 2017 and 2023. Several options are considered to explain the\norigin of the observed dust and its variability, but no clear sources could be\nidentified from the current observations.

Each\nday, an agent arrives with a private valuation per day of rental, drawn from\nthat day's (known) distribution. The designer can either rent out the asset to\nthe current agent for any number of remaining days, charging them a (possibly\ndifferent) payment per day, or turn the agent away. Agents who arrive when the\nasset is not available are turned away. A defining feature of our dynamic model\nis that agents are \\emph{stagewise-IR} (individually rational), meaning they\nreject any rental agreement that results in temporary negative utility, even if\ntheir final utility is positive. We ask whether and under which economic\nobjectives it is useful for the designer to exploit the stagewise-IR nature of\nthe agents.\n  We show that an optimal rental mechanism can be modeled as a sequence of\ndynamic auctions with seller costs. However, the stagewise-IR behavior of the\nagents makes these auctions quite different from classical single-parameter\nauctions: Myerson's Lemma does not apply, and indeed we show that truthful\nmechanisms are not necessarily monotone, and payments do not necessarily follow\nMyerson's unique payment rule. We develop alternative characterizations of\noptimal mechanisms under several classes of economic objectives, including\ngeneralizations of welfare, revenue and consumer surplus. These\ncharacterizations allow us to use Myerson's unique payment rule in several\ncases, and for the other cases we develop optimal mechanisms from scratch.

    "abstract": "Mid-infrared spectroscopy of protoplanetary disks provides a chemical\ninventory of gas within a few au, where planets are readily detected around\nolder stars. With the JWST Disk Infrared Spectral Chemistry Survey (JDISCS), we\nexplore demographic trends among 31 disks observed with MIRI (MRS) and with\nprevious ALMA millimeter continuum imaging at high angular resolution (5-10\nau). With these S/N $\\sim$200-450 spectra, we report emission from H$_2$O, OH,\nCO, C$_2$H$_2$, HCN, CO$_2$, [Ne II], [Ne III], and [Ar II]. Emission from\nH$_2$O, OH and CO is nearly ubiquitous for low-mass stars, and detection rates\nof all molecules are higher than for similar disks observed with Spitzer-IRS.\nSlab model fits to the molecular emission lines demonstrate that emission from\nC$_2$H$_2$, HCN, and possibly CO$_2$ is optically thin; thus since column\ndensities and emitting radii are degenerate, observations are actually\nsensitive to the total molecular mass. C$_2$H$_2$ and HCN emission also\ntypically originate in a hotter region ($920^{+70}_{-130}$, $820^{+70}_{-130}$\nK, respectively) than CO$_2$ ($600^{+200}_{-160}$ K). The HCN to cold H$_2$O\nluminosity ratios are generally smaller in smooth disks, consistent with more\nefficient water delivery via icy pebbles in the absence of large dust\nsubstructures. The molecular emission line luminosities are also correlated\nwith mass accretion rates and infrared spectral indices, similar to trends\nreported from Spitzer-IRS surveys. This work demonstrates the power of\ncombining multi-wavelength observations to explore inner disk chemistry as a\nfunction of outer disk and stellar properties, which will continue to grow as\nthe sample of observed Class II systems expands in the coming JWST observation\ncycles.",

We constrain the 3D fine structure of the magnetic field in the\nphotosphere of a solar plage from a unique spectropolarimetric dataset with a\nvery high spatial and spectral resolution and a fast temporal cadence. We\nanalyzed spectropolarimetric observations of a solar plage in the two\nmagnetically sensitive spectral lines of neutral iron around 630 nm.

MiHI obtained diffraction-limited, high-cadence\nobservations with high spectral fidelity. These observations were interpreted\nusing the spectropolarimetric inversion with magnetohydrostatic constraints,\nwhich allowed us to recover the magnetic and thermodynamic structure of the\nplage on a geometrical scale. The inversion results reveal that the magnetic\nfield can reach up to 2 kG and that it expands significantly from the deep to\nthe mid-photosphere. Weaker (200 G), and very small (subarcsecond) vertical\nmagnetic loops lie beneath this canopy, rooted in the photosphere.

    "abstract": "Water management is one of the most critical aspects of our society, together\nwith population increase and climate change. Water scarcity requires a better\ncharacterization and monitoring of Water Distribution Networks (WDNs). This\npaper presents a novel framework for monitoring Water Distribution Networks\n(WDNs) by integrating physics-informed modeling of the nonlinear interactions\nbetween pressure and flow data with Topological Signal Processing (TSP)\ntechniques. We represent pressure and flow data as signals defined over a\nsecond-order cell complex, enabling accurate estimation of water pressures and\nflows throughout the entire network from sparse sensor measurements. By\nformalizing hydraulic conservation laws through the TSP framework, we provide a\ncomprehensive representation of nodal pressures and edge flows that incorporate\nhigher-order interactions captured through the formalism of cell complexes.\nThis provides a principled way to decompose the water flows in WDNs in three\northogonal signal components (irrotational, solenoidal and harmonic). The\nspectral representations of these components inherently reflect the\nconservation laws governing the water pressures and flows. Sparse\nrepresentation in the spectral domain enable topology-based sampling and\nreconstruction of nodal pressures and water flows from sparse measurements. Our\nresults demonstrate that employing cell complex-based signal representations\nenhances the accuracy of edge signal reconstruction, due to proper modeling of\nboth conservative and non-conservative flows along the polygonal cells.",

    "abstract": "As the digital landscape becomes more interconnected, the frequency and\nseverity of zero-day attacks, have significantly increased, leading to an\nurgent need for innovative Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). Machine\nLearning-based IDS that learn from the network traffic characteristics and can\ndiscern attack patterns from benign traffic offer an advanced solution to\ntraditional signature-based IDS. However, they heavily rely on labeled\ndatasets, and their ability to generalize when encountering unseen traffic\npatterns remains a challenge. This paper proposes a novel self-supervised\ncontrastive learning approach based on transformer encoders, specifically\ntailored for generalizable intrusion detection on raw packet sequences. Our\nproposed learning scheme employs a packet-level data augmentation strategy\ncombined with a transformer-based architecture to extract and generate\nmeaningful representations of traffic flows. Unlike traditional methods reliant\non handcrafted statistical features (NetFlow), our approach automatically\nlearns comprehensive packet sequence representations, significantly enhancing\nperformance in anomaly identification tasks and supervised learning for\nintrusion detection. Our transformer-based framework exhibits better\nperformance in comparison to existing NetFlow self-supervised methods.\nSpecifically, we achieve up to a 3% higher AUC in anomaly detection for\nintra-dataset evaluation and up to 20% higher AUC scores in inter-dataset\nevaluation. Moreover, our model provides a strong baseline for supervised\nintrusion detection with limited labeled data, exhibiting an improvement over\nself-supervised NetFlow models of up to 1.5% AUC when pretrained and evaluated\non the same dataset. Additionally, we show the adaptability of our pretrained\nmodel when fine-tuned across different datasets, demonstrating strong\nperformance even when lacking benign data from the target domain.",

    "abstract": "Teachers' visual attention and its distribution across the students in\nclassrooms can constitute important implications for student engagement,\nachievement, and professional teacher training. Despite that, inferring the\ninformation about where and which student teachers focus on is not trivial.\nMobile eye tracking can provide vital help to solve this issue; however, the\nuse of mobile eye tracking alone requires a significant amount of manual\nannotations. To address this limitation, we present an automated processing\npipeline concept that requires minimal manually annotated data to recognize\nwhich student the teachers focus on. To this end, we utilize state-of-the-art\nface detection models and face recognition feature embeddings to train face\nrecognition models with transfer learning in the classroom context and combine\nthese models with the teachers' gaze from mobile eye trackers. We evaluated our\napproach with data collected from four different classrooms, and our results\nshow that while it is possible to estimate the visually focused students with\nreasonable performance in all of our classroom setups, U-shaped and small\nclassrooms led to the best results with accuracies of approximately 0.7 and\n0.9, respectively. While we did not evaluate our method for teacher-student\ninteractions and focused on the validity of the technical approach, as our\nmethodology does not require a vast amount of manually annotated data and\noffers a non-intrusive way of handling teachers' visual attention, it could\nhelp improve instructional strategies, enhance classroom management, and\nprovide feedback for professional teacher development.",

In this paper, we show that prevalent methods\nadopting this distance metric fail to adequately capture the impact of\nindividual lines when there is more than one line congested.

In this work, we introduce the novel concept of XAI\nconsistency, defined as the agreement among different feature attribution\nmethods, and propose new metrics to quantify it. For the first time, we\nintegrate XAI consistency directly into the hyperparameter tuning objective,\ncreating a multi-objective optimization framework that balances predictive\nperformance with explanation robustness. Implemented within the Sequential\nParameter Optimization Toolbox (SPOT), our approach uses both weighted\naggregation and desirability-based strategies to guide model selection. Through\nour proposed framework and supporting tools, we explore the impact of\nincorporating XAI consistency into the optimization process. This enables us to\ncharacterize distinct regions in the architecture configuration space: one\nregion with poor performance and comparatively low interpretability, another\nwith strong predictive performance but weak interpretability due to low\n\\gls{xai} consistency, and a trade-off region that balances both objectives by\noffering high interpretability alongside competitive performance.

    "abstract": "We completely discard the conventional spatial prior in image representation\nand introduce a novel discrete visual tokenizer: Self-consistency Tokenizer\n(Selftok). At its design core, we compose an autoregressive (AR) prior --\nmirroring the causal structure of language -- into visual tokens by using the\nreverse diffusion process of image generation. The AR property makes Selftok\nfundamentally distinct from traditional spatial tokens in the following two key\nways: - Selftok offers an elegant and minimalist approach to unify diffusion\nand AR for vision-language models (VLMs): By representing images with Selftok\ntokens, we can train a VLM using a purely discrete autoregressive architecture\n-- like that in LLMs -- without requiring additional modules or training\nobjectives. - We theoretically show that the AR prior satisfies the Bellman\nequation, whereas the spatial prior does not. Therefore, Selftok supports\nreinforcement learning (RL) for visual generation with effectiveness comparable\nto that achieved in LLMs. Besides the AR property, Selftok is also a SoTA\ntokenizer that achieves a favorable trade-off between high-quality\nreconstruction and compression rate. We use Selftok to build a pure AR VLM for\nboth visual comprehension and generation tasks. Impressively, without using any\ntext-image training pairs, a simple policy gradient RL working in the visual\ntokens can significantly boost the visual generation benchmark, surpassing all\nthe existing models by a large margin. Therefore, we believe that Selftok\neffectively addresses the long-standing challenge that visual tokens cannot\nsupport effective RL. When combined with the well-established strengths of RL\nin LLMs, this brings us one step closer to realizing a truly multimodal LLM.\nProject Page: https://selftok-team.github.io/report/.",

However, existing DRNGs are either not secure against quantum\ncomputers or depend on the random oracle model (ROM) to achieve security. In\nthis paper, we design a DRNG based on lattice-based publicly verifiable secret\nsharing (PVSS) that is post-quantum secure and proven secure in the standard\nmodel.

Hybrid model\napproaches, which combine data-driven ML with physics-based models, mitigate\nthese concerns by incorporating prior knowledge of the domain. This study\nintegrated a purely data-driven ML model and two hybrid models (using the Biasi\nand Bowring CHF correlations) within the CTF subchannel code via a custom\nFortran framework. Performance was evaluated using two validation cases: a\nsubset of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission CHF database and the Bennett dryout\nexperiments. In both cases, the hybrid models exhibited significantly lower\nerror metrics in comparison with conventional empirical correlations. The pure\nML model remained competitive with the hybrid models. Trend analysis of error\nparity indicates that ML-based models reduce the tendency for CHF\noverprediction, improving overall accuracy.

    "abstract": "This paper addresses inverse problems (in a broad sense) for two classes of\nmultivariate neural network (NN) operators, with particular emphasis on\nsaturation results, and both analytical and semi-analytical inverse theorems.\nOne of the key aspects in addressing these issues is solving of certain\nelliptic and hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs), as well as\nsuitable asymptotic formulas for the NN operators based on sufficiently smooth\nfunctions; the connection between these two topics lies in the application of\nthe so-called generalized parabola technique by Ditzian. From the saturation\ntheorems characterizations of the saturation classes are derived; these are\nrespectively related to harmonic functions and to the solution of a certain\ntransport equation. Analytical inverse theorems, on the other hand, are related\nto sub-harmonic functions as well as to functions in the Sobolev space\n$W^2_\\infty$. Finally, the problem of reconstructing data affected by noise is\naddressed, along with a semi-analytical inverse problem. The latter serves as\nthe starting point for deriving a retrieval procedure that may be useful in\nreal world applications.",

However, different from prethermalization that can be\nobserved in 1D Floquet classical spin systems with NN interactions, classical\nPDTCs in Floquet 1D systems with only NN interactions have not been proposed\nbefore. Here, we demonstrate the emergence of disorder-free PDTCs in 1D Floquet\nclassic spin systems with NN interactions. We show that the thermalization time\ngrows exponentially as the driving frequency increases and depends on the\nenergy density of the initial state, which are two key signatures of PDTCs. The\nrobustness of 1D classical PDTC order is verified by introducing imperfect spin\nflip operations. The emergence of 1D classical PDTCs can be explained by\nmapping the 1D classical spin chain with NN interacting to a quantum spin-half\nsystem with effective long-range interactions. Our work provides an exploration\nof quantum characteristics, when considering the classical counterparts of\nquantum phenomena, and will be helpful for further investigations of both\nclassical and quantum prethermal systems and discrete time-crystalline order.",

In this paper, we explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs)\nto automate client code updates in response to breaking dependency updates. We\nevaluate our approach on the BUMP dataset, a benchmark for breaking dependency\nupdates in Java projects. Our approach leverages LLMs with advanced prompts,\nincluding information from the build process and from the breaking dependency\nanalysis. We assess effectiveness at three granularity levels: at the build\nlevel, the file level, and the individual compilation error level. We\nexperiment with five LLMs: Google Gemini-2.0 Flash, OpenAI GPT4o-mini, OpenAI\no3-mini, Alibaba Qwen2.5-32b-instruct, and DeepSeek V3. Our results show that\nLLMs can automatically repair breaking updates. Among the considered models,\nOpenAI's o3-mini is the best, able to completely fix 27% of the builds when\nusing prompts that include contextual information such as the buggy line, API\ndifferences, error messages, and step-by-step reasoning instructions.

To address non-convexity in the monomial\ncoordinate formulation of the guidance problem, Sequential Convex Programming\nis applied. Using the methodology presented in this paper, repeatedly\nevaluating the nonlinear dynamics is not necessary, as in shooting or\ncollocation methods.

Their contribution to\ncoronal heating as well as their physical origin are currently being\ninvestigated. We wish to determine whether models of short loops and impulsive\nheating are compatible with the results from observations. In particular, we\nused two models of loops with distinct thermal properties: cool (T below 1E5 K)\nand hot loops (T above 1E5 K). We simulated the evolution of impulsively heated\nshort loops, using the 1D hydrodynamics (HD) code HYDRAD. We computed the\nsynthetic light curves of HRIEUV, four EUV channels of the Atmospheric Imaging\nAssembly (AIA), and five emission lines measured by the SPectral Imaging of the\nCoronal Environment (SPICE). We then compared the results from the synthetic\nlight curves with observations. The aim was to reproduce the short delays\nobserved between the intensity peaks of the light curves. Cool loops subjected\nto impulsive heating are good candidates to explain the physical origin of the\nEUV brightenings.

The existence and uniqueness of\n$\\Lambda_{F}C$ was proved by Deveney and Mordeson in 1977. We show that it\nadmits a simple description in terms of given generators for $C$: we expand the\nlanguage of rings by the parameterized Lambda functions, and then\n$\\Lambda_{F}C$ is the subfield of $F$ generated over $C$ by additionally\nclosing under these functions. We then show that, given particular generators\nof $C$, $\\Lambda_{F}C$ is the subfield of $F$ generated iteratively by the\nimages of the generators under Lambda functions taken with respect to\n$p$-independent tuples also drawn from those generators.\n  We apply these results to given a ``local description'' of existentially\ndefinable sets in fields equipped with a henselian topology. Let $X(K)$ be an\nexistentially definable set in the theory of a field $K$ equipped with a\nhenselian topology $\\tau$. We show that there is a definable injection into\n$X(K)$ from a Zariski-open subset $U_{1}^{\\circ}$ of a set with nonempty\n$\\tau$-interior, and that each element of $U_{1}^{\\circ}$ is interalgebraic\n(over parameters) with its image in $X(K)$. This can be seen as a kind of {\\em\nvery weak local quantifier elimination}, and it shows that existentially\ndefinable sets are (at least generically and locally) definably pararameterized\nby ``big'' sets.\n  In the final section we extend the theory of separably tame valued fields,\ndeveloped by Kuhlmann and Pal, to include the case of infinite degree of\nimperfection, and to allow expansions of the residue field and value group\nstructures.

We\nfocus on targeted tests of the Born rule for spin or polarisation\nprobabilities, which offer a particularly clean experimental signal, and which\ncan be described by a simple hidden-variables model of two-state systems\nproposed by Bell. These probabilities test a remarkable feature of the quantum\nformalism, whereby expectation values for incompatible experiments are linearly\nrelated. Born-rule violations can be parameterised by nonlinear expectation\nvalues for quantum measurements of spin or polarisation, along with anomalies\nin ensemble averages, which are to be constrained by experiment. Notable\nexperiments considered here include the recent detection of single photons from\ntop-quark decay, and the indirect measurement of tau-lepton polarisation.\nRepurposing these experiments as tests of the Born rule, however, presents\nseveral challenges, which are discussed in this paper.",

However, existing reasoning methods primarily focus on positive\nimportance of historical facts, neglecting adverse effects of outdated facts.\nBesides, training on these outdated facts yields extra computational cost. To\naddress these challenges, we propose an outdated fact filtering framework named\nHALO, which quantifies the temporal validity of historical facts by exploring\nthe half-life theory to filter outdated facts in TKGs. HALO consists of three\nmodules: the temporal fact attention module, the dynamic relation-aware encoder\nmodule, and the outdated fact filtering module. Firstly, the temporal fact\nattention module captures the evolution of historical facts over time to\nidentify relevant facts. Secondly, the dynamic relation-aware encoder module is\ndesigned for efficiently predicting the half life of each fact. Finally, we\nconstruct a time decay function based on the half-life theory to quantify the\ntemporal validity of facts and filter outdated facts. Experimental results show\nthat HALO outperforms the state-of-the-art TKG reasoning methods on three\npublic datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting and filtering\noutdated facts (Codes are available at\nhttps://github.com/yushuowiki/K-Half/tree/main ).",

Hence, an efficient navigation plan is essential for the final\nsuccess. This paper proposes a novel parameter-efficient action planner using\nlarge language models (PEAP-LLM) to generate a single-step instruction at each\nlocation. The proposed model consists of two modules, LLM goal planner (LGP)\nand LoRA action planner (LAP). Initially, LGP extracts the goal-oriented plan\nfrom REVERIE instructions, including the target object and room. Then, LAP\ngenerates a single-step instruction with the goal-oriented plan, high-level\ninstruction, and current visual observation as input. PEAP-LLM enables the\nembodied agent to interact with LAP as the path planner on the fly. A simple\ndirect application of LLMs hardly achieves good performance. Also, existing\nhard-prompt-based methods are error-prone in complicated scenarios and need\nhuman intervention. To address these issues and prevent the LLM from generating\nhallucinations and biased information, we propose a novel two-stage method for\nfine-tuning the LLM, consisting of supervised fine-tuning (STF) and direct\npreference optimization (DPO). SFT improves the quality of generated\ninstructions, while DPO utilizes environmental feedback.

We showed a large\ndeviation principle for both models. As a result, the two rate functions\ncoincide up to scaling and are minimized by the Rademacher distribution.\nTherefore, we refer to the logarithmic integral in the rate function as Boolean\nentropy.

We analyse the formation and growth of a very massive star (VMS)\nthrough successive stellar collisions and investigate the subsequent formation\nof an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) in the core of a dense star cluster.\n  Methods. We use both direct \\textit{N}-body and Monte Carlo simulations,\nincorporating updated stellar evolution prescriptions (SSE/BSE) tailored to\nmassive stars and VMSs. These include revised treatments of stellar radii,\nrejuvenation, and mass loss during collisions. While the prescriptions\nrepresent reasonable extrapolations into the VMS regime, the internal structure\nand thermal state of VMSs formed through stellar collisions remain uncertain,\nand future work may require further refinement.\n  Results. We find that runaway stellar collisions in the cluster core produce\na VMS exceeding $5 \\times 10^4~\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$ within 5 Myr, which\nsubsequently collapses into an IMBH.\n  Conclusions. Our model suggests that dense stellar environments may enable\nthe formation of very massive stars and massive black hole seeds through\nrunaway stellar collisions.

This is substantially larger\nthan the classical prediction of Higgs Inflation, $n_s \\approx 0.965$, which is\n2.74$\\sigma$ below the ACT mean value. We show that when an otherwise\nmetastable Standard Model Higgs Inflation potential is stabilised by the\naddition of vector-like quark pairs and the potential is renormalised in the\nJordan frame, the value of $n_s$ is generally larger than 0.965 and can explain\nthe ACT observation. As an example, assuming the 2022 PDG direct measurement\ncentral value for the t quark mass, $m_{t} = 172.69$ GeV, and central values\nfor the SM inputs to the renormalisation group equations, we obtain $n_s =\n0.9792 - 0.9844$ for the case of three isosinglet vector-like B quarks with\nmass $m_{Q}$ in the range 1-3 TeV, with the lowest value of the $n_s$ range\nbeing 1.44$\\sigma$ above the ACT mean value.

We find that in the microcanonical ensemble, where the black hole\nenergy is fixed, quantum gravity corrections do not modify the decoherence rate\ncompared to the semiclassical prediction. However, in the canonical ensemble,\nwhere the black hole is in a thermal equilibrium state, quantum gravitational\neffects significantly enhance the decoherence rate at low temperatures.

    "abstract": "We present an analysis of high-resolution spectra from the shock-heated\nplasmas in SN~1987A, based on an observation using the Resolve instrument\nonboard the X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM).The 1.7--10 keV\nResolve spectra are accurately represented by a single component,\nplane-parallel shock plasma model, with a temperature of $2.84_{-0.08}^{+0.09}$\nkeV and an ionization parameter of $2.64_{-0.45}^{+0.58} \\times 10^{11}$ s\ncm$^{-3}$.The Resolve spectra are also well reproduced by the 3-D\nmagneto-hydrodynamic simulation presented by Orlando et al. (2020) suggesting\nsubstantial contribution from the ejecta. The metal abundances obtained with\nResolve align with the LMC value, indicating that the X-rays in 2024 originate\nfrom non-metal-rich shock-heated ejecta and the reverse shock has not reached\nthe inner metal-rich region of ejecta. Doppler widths of the atomic lines from\nSi, S, and Fe correspond to velocities of 1,500--1,700 km s$^{-1}$, where the\nthermal broadening effects in this non-metal-rich plasma are negligible.\nTherefore, the line broadening seen in Resolve spectra is determined by the\nlarge bulk motion of ejecta. For reference, we determined a 90\\% upper limit on\nnon-thermal emission from a pulsar wind nebula at $4.3 \\times 10^{-13}$ erg\ncm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ in the 2 -- 10 keV range, aligning with NuSTAR findings by\nGreco et al.

Additionally, we searched for the $^{44}$Sc K line feature\nand found a $1\\sigma$ upper limit of $1.0 \\times 10^{-6}$ photons cm$^{-2}$\ns$^{-1}$, which translates to an initial $^{44}$Ti mass of approximately $2\n\\times 10^{-4} M_{\\odot}$, consistent with previous X-ray to soft gamma-ray\nobservations (Boggs et al. 2015; Grebenev et al. 2012; Leising 2006).",

However, many downstream tasks require\nguiding the generated content based on specific differentiable metrics,\ntypically necessitating backpropagation during the generation process. This\napproach is computationally expensive, as generating with DMs often demands\ntens to hundreds of recursive network calls, resulting in high memory usage and\nsignificant time consumption. In this paper, we propose a more efficient\nalternative that approaches the problem from the perspective of parallel\ndenoising. We show that full backpropagation throughout the entire generation\nprocess is unnecessary. The downstream metrics can be optimized by retaining\nthe computational graph of only one step during generation, thus providing a\nshortcut for gradient propagation. The resulting method, which we call Shortcut\nDiffusion Optimization (SDO), is generic, high-performance, and computationally\nlightweight, capable of optimizing all parameter types in diffusion sampling.\nWe demonstrate the effectiveness of SDO on several real-world tasks, including\ncontrolling generation by optimizing latent and aligning the DMs by fine-tuning\nnetwork parameters.

These campaigns leveraged high-resolution and high-cadence\nobservations from the mission's remote-sensing suite, including the\nHigh-Resolution EUV Imager (EUI/HRI_EUV), the Spectrometer/Telescope for\nImaging X-rays (STIX), the Spectral Imaging of the Coronal Environment (SPICE)\nspectrometer, and the High Resolution Telescope of the Polarimetric and\nHelioseismic Imager (PHI/HRT), as well as coordinated ground-based and\nEarth-orbiting observations. EUI/HRI_EUV operating in short-exposure modes,\nprovided two-second-cadence, non-saturated EUV images, revealing structures and\ndynamics on scales not previously observed. Simultaneously, STIX captured hard\nX-ray imaging and spectroscopy of accelerated electrons, while SPICE acquired\nEUV slit spectroscopy to probe chromospheric and coronal responses. Together,\nthese observations offer an unprecedented view of magnetic reconnection, energy\nrelease, particle acceleration, and plasma heating across a broad range of\ntemperatures and spatial scales.

    "abstract": "One of the most remarkable discoveries by the IBEX is the ribbon - a narrow\nband of enhanced ENA fluxes observed in the sky. The prevailing explanation\nattributes the IBEX ribbon to the secondary ENA mechanism. In this process,\nprimary H ENAs, produced via charge exchange between solar wind (SW) protons\nand interstellar H atoms within the heliosphere, travel beyond the heliopause\n(HP) and undergo further charge exchange with protons of the LISM, generating\npickup protons. Some of these pickup protons subsequently experience charge\nexchange with interstellar H atoms, forming secondary ENAs, some of which\ntravel back toward the Sun and are detected by the IBEX. This paper presents a\nkinetic model developed to simulate secondary ENA fluxes. Ribbon simulations\nare performed using global distributions of plasma and H atoms in the\nheliosphere derived from a kinetic-MHD model of the SW/LISM interaction. The\nmodel accounts for all relevant primary ENA populations, including neutralized\nthermal SW protons, neutralized pickup protons, and ENAs originating in the\ninner heliosheath (IHS). The transport of pickup protons beyond the HP is\ndescribed by the focused transport equation for a gyrotropic velocity\ndistribution in the scatter-free limit, assuming no pitch-angle scattering or\nenergy diffusion. Our simulations qualitatively reproduce IBEX-Hi ribbon\nobservations and exhibit good quantitative agreement at low heliolatitudes.\nHowever, the model underestimates fluxes at high heliolatitudes, likely due to\nthe omission of non-stationary SW behavior in the stationary framework used in\nthis work. The study highlights the importance of ENAs from the IHS, a\npopulation considered for the ribbon production in the frame of the kinetic\nmodel of pickup proton transport in the heliosphere for the first time, for\naccurately reproducing ribbon fluxes observed by IBEX-Hi at the highest energy\nsteps.",

This\nprocess disrupts early-stage percolated networks, resulting in reentrant\nbehavior -- a dynamic transition from disordered cluster to network to chiral\nrigid cluster. On the other hand, the cluster-elastic network boundary in the\nfinal state is governed by isostatic percolation, which slows structural\nrearrangements, preserves branching points, and sustains a long-lived network.\nThe resulting structure consist of rigid Bernal spiral-like branches connected\nthrough flexible branching points lacking order. These insights advance our\nmicroscopic understanding of out-of-equilibrium ordering driven by competing\ninteractions, particularly phenomena like temporally delayed frustration\nreflecting different length scales of competing interactions. The mechanisms\nidentified here may play a crucial role in mesoscale self-organization across\nsoft materials, from nanoparticle assemblies to biological gels and\ncytoskeletal networks.

    "abstract": "To assess the significance and scale dependence of anomalous large scale\nmodes in the CatWISE quasar data, we generate smoothed number density fields on\nthe sphere and study their extreme values -- maximum, minimum, maximum\nantipodal difference. By comparing these summary statistics to those obtained\nfrom random isotropic realisations of the data, we determine the statistical\nsignificance of large scale modes as a function of smoothing scale. We perform\nour analysis using five different versions of the data -- the original quasar\nmap, the maps after separately subtracting the ecliptic bias and the CMB\ndipole, the map obtained after subtracting both, and the map after subtracting\nthe ecliptic bias and anomalous dipole inferred in \\cite{Secrest2021}. We find\nthat the ecliptic-corrected, CMB dipole-removed map exhibits large scale modes\nthat are in tension with random realisations of the data (p-values $p \\sim\n10^{-4}$), over a wide range of smoothing scales $\\pi/8 \\leq \\delta \\leq\n\\pi/2$. The most prominent feature in the data is an underdensity in the\nsouthern galactic plane at $(b,\\ell) = (-31^\\circ,78^\\circ)$, which reaches its\nhighest statistical significance when smoothed on scales $\\delta = \\pi/6$ ($p\n\\ll 10^{-5}$). Notably, the minima statistics align with the maximum antipodal\ndifference statistics, whereas the maxima do not. This suggests that the\nobserved dipole-like behavior in the data is primarily driven by the\nunderdensity in the southern sky. The ecliptic corrected, anomalous dipole\nsubtracted map reduces the significance of any residual anisotropic features,\nbut an underdensity in the south sky persists with p-value $p =0.0018$.",

However, existing\niterative model-aware data selection methods incur significant computational\noverhead, as they rely on repeatedly performing full-dataset model inference to\nestimate sample utility for subsequent training iterations, creating a\nfundamental efficiency bottleneck. In this paper, we propose LEAD, an efficient\niterative data selection framework that accurately estimates sample utility\nentirely within the standard training loop, eliminating the need for costly\nadditional model inference. At its core, LEAD introduces Instance-Level Dynamic\nUncertainty (IDU), a theoretically grounded utility function combining\ninstantaneous training loss, gradient-based approximation of loss changes, and\nexponential smoothing of historical loss signals. To further scale efficiently\nto large datasets, LEAD employs a two-stage, coarse-to-fine selection strategy,\nadaptively prioritizing informative clusters through a multi-armed bandit\nmechanism, followed by precise fine-grained selection of high-utility samples\nusing IDU. Extensive experiments across four diverse benchmarks show that LEAD\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, improving average model\nperformance by 6.1%-10.8% while using only 2.5% of the training data and\nreducing overall training time by 5-10x.",

More interestingly, we also find a regime where\nthe system can hold four unprotected nonzero-energy edge modes in the trivial\nphase, which is analogous to a weak topological phase. The third regime is also\ntrivial but holds no edge modes. The emergence of zero- and nonzero-energy edge\nmodes in the system are analyzed by transforming the lattice model into a\nladder consisting of Majorana fermions, where the competition between intra-\nand inter-leg couplings leads to the rich phase diagram.

    "abstract": "Recommendation systems in AI-based medical diagnostics and treatment\nconstitute a critical component of AI in healthcare. Although some studies have\nexplored this area and made notable progress, healthcare recommendation systems\nremain in their nascent stage. And these researches mainly target the treatment\nprocess such as drug or disease recommendations. In addition to the treatment\nprocess, the diagnostic process, particularly determining which medical\nexaminations are necessary to evaluate the condition, also urgently requires\nintelligent decision support. To bridge this gap, we first formalize the task\nof medical examination recommendations. Compared to traditional\nrecommendations, the medical examination recommendation involves more complex\ninteractions. This complexity arises from two folds: 1) The historical medical\nrecords for examination recommendations are heterogeneous and redundant, which\nmakes the recommendation results susceptible to noise. 2) The correlation\nbetween the medical history of patients is often irregular, making it\nchallenging to model spatiotemporal dependencies. Motivated by the above\nobservation, we propose a novel Diffusion-driven SpatioTemporal Graph\nKANsformer for Medical Examination Recommendation (DST-GKAN) with a two-stage\nlearning paradigm to solve the above challenges. In the first stage, we exploit\na task-adaptive diffusion model to distill recommendation-oriented information\nby reducing the noises in heterogeneous medical data. In the second stage, a\nspatiotemporal graph KANsformer is proposed to simultaneously model the complex\nspatial and temporal relationships. Moreover, to facilitate the medical\nexamination recommendation research, we introduce a comprehensive dataset. The\nexperimental results demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the\nproposed method compared to various competitive baselines.",

Recent forecasting models typically\nadopt the temporal forecast (TF) paradigm, which directly encode and decode\ntime series in the time domain. However, the entangled step-wise dependencies\nin series data can hinder the performance of TF. To address this, some\nforecasters conduct encoding and decoding in the transformed domain using\nfixed, dataset-independent bases (e.g., sine and cosine signals in the Fourier\ntransform). In contrast, we utilize $\\mathbf{OrthoTrans}$, a data-adaptive\ntransformation based on an orthogonal matrix that diagonalizes the series'\ntemporal Pearson correlation matrix. This approach enables more effective\nencoding and decoding in the decorrelated feature domain and can serve as a\nplug-in module to enhance existing forecasters. To enhance the representation\nlearning for multivariate time series, we introduce a customized linear layer,\n$\\mathbf{NormLin}$, which employs a normalized weight matrix to capture\nmultivariate dependencies. Empirically, the NormLin module shows a surprising\nperformance advantage over multi-head self-attention, while requiring nearly\nhalf the FLOPs. Extensive experiments on 24 benchmarks and 140 forecasting\ntasks demonstrate that OLinear consistently achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance with high efficiency. Notably, as a plug-in replacement for\nself-attention, the NormLin module consistently enhances Transformer-based\nforecasters.

While significant attention has been devoted to\nunderstanding the WNM and CNM, the formation of a substantial fraction of the\nUNM, with temperatures ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand Kelvin,\nremains less well understood. In this study, we present three-dimensional\nhydrodynamical and magnetohydrodynamical simulations of turbulent multiphase\nISM to investigate the roles of turbulence and magnetic fields in regulating\nthe multiphase ISM. Our results confirm that turbulence is crucial in\nredistributing energy and producing the UNM. The turbulent mixing effect\nsmooths the phase diagram, flattens the pressure-density relationship, and\nincreases the fraction of gas in the UNM. We find that magnetic fields not only\ncontribute to sustaining the UNM but also influence the dynamics and\ndistribution of gas across all phases. Magnetic fields introduce anisotropy to\nthe turbulent cascade, reducing the efficiency of turbulent mixing in the\ndirection perpendicular to the magnetic field. We find the anisotropy results\nin a less flat phase diagram compared to hydrodynamical cases. Furthermore, the\ninclusion of magnetic fields shallowens the second-order velocity structure\nfunctions across multiple ISM phases, suggesting that more small-scale\nfluctuations are driven. These fluctuations contribute to the formation of the\nUNM by altering the energy cascade and thermodynamic properties of the gas.

In this study, we investigate CR superdiffusion in\nturbulent, partially ionized media using high-resolution 3D two-fluid\nsimulations that treat ions and neutrals separately. We examine the influence\nof neutral-ion decoupling and the associated damping of turbulence on CR\npropagation in both transonic and supersonic conditions. Our simulations\ndemonstrate that neutral-ion decoupling significantly damps velocity, density,\nand magnetic field fluctuations at small scales, producing spectral slopes\nsteeper than those of Kolmogorov and Burgers scaling. We also identify an\nintermediate coupling regime in which neutrals remain partially coupled with\nions, leading to a steepening of kinetic energy spectra in both fluids. Shocks\ncan enhance the neutral-ion coupling, thereby reducing the differences between\nneutral and ion density structures. Moreover, the damping of magnetic field\nfluctuations substantially decreases pitch angle scattering, which increases CR\nparallel mean free paths. As a result, CR perpendicular transport transitions\nbetween two distinct superdiffusive regimes: a scattering-dominated regime with\nperpendicular displacement proportional to $t^{3/4}$, and a scattering-free\nregime dominated by magnetic field line wandering, with perpendicular\ndisplacement scaling as $t^{3/2}$. When the pitch angle is large, the effects\nof magnetic mirroring, naturally arising in magnetohydrodynamic turbulence,\nbecome significant, enhancing the confinement (but not fully trapping) of CRs\nand inducing oscillations in their perpendicular displacement. These results\nhighlight the necessity of incorporating two-fluid effects for accurately\nmodeling CR transport in partially ionized environments such as molecular\nclouds and dense interstellar clumps.",

In this study, we propose a comprehensive framework\nthat utilizes graph neural networks to predict and enhance the performance of\nTENG electrode materials and doping strategies. By leveraging an extensive\ndataset of experimental and computational results, the model effectively\nclassifies electrode materials, predicts optimal doping ratios, and establishes\nrobust structure-property relationships. Key findings include a 65.7% increase\nin energy density for aluminum-doped PTFE and an 85.7% improvement for\nfluorine-doped PTFE, highlighting the critical influence of doping materials\nand their concentrations. The model further identifies PTFE as a highly\neffective negative electrode material, achieving a maximum energy density of\n1.12 J/cm$^2$ with 7% silver (Ag) doping when copper (Cu) is used as the\npositive electrode. This data-driven approach not only accelerates material\ndiscovery but also significantly reduces experimental costs, providing novel\ninsights into the fundamental factors influencing TENG performance. The\nproposed methodology establishes a robust platform for intelligent material\ndesign, advancing the development of sustainable energy technologies and\nself-powered systems.",

The generalized EPR state is\ntheoretically analyzed here and its entanglement quantified in terms of a\nrecently introduced generalized entanglement measure. This state can also be\napplied to entangled photons produced from spontaneous parametric down\nconversion (SPDC). The present analysis is then used in quantifying the\nentanglement of photons produced from the SPDC process, in terms of certain\nexperimental parameters. A comparison is also made with the Schmidt number,\nwhich is normally used as an entanglement measure in such situations. A\nprocedure for experimentally determining the entanglement of SPDC photons has\nalso been described.

    "abstract": "Pruning is a widely used method for compressing Deep Neural Networks (DNNs),\nwhere less relevant parameters are removed from a DNN model to reduce its size.\nHowever, removing parameters reduces model accuracy, so pruning is typically\ncombined with fine-tuning, and sometimes other operations such as rewinding\nweights, to recover accuracy. A common approach is to repeatedly prune and then\nfine-tune, with increasing amounts of model parameters being removed in each\nstep. While straightforward to implement, pruning pipelines that follow this\napproach are computationally expensive due to the need for repeated\nfine-tuning.\n  In this paper we propose ICE-Pruning, an iterative pruning pipeline for DNNs\nthat significantly decreases the time required for pruning by reducing the\noverall cost of fine-tuning, while maintaining a similar accuracy to existing\npruning pipelines. ICE-Pruning is based on three main components: i) an\nautomatic mechanism to determine after which pruning steps fine-tuning should\nbe performed; ii) a freezing strategy for faster fine-tuning in each pruning\nstep; and iii) a custom pruning-aware learning rate scheduler to further\nimprove the accuracy of each pruning step and reduce the overall time\nconsumption. We also propose an efficient auto-tuning stage for the\nhyperparameters (e.g., freezing percentage) introduced by the three components.\nWe evaluate ICE-Pruning on several DNN models and datasets, showing that it can\naccelerate pruning by up to 9.61x.

This paper presents various\nways householders use a technological artifact for the real-time monitoring of\nrenewable energy provision. Such a monitoring thus affords householders with an\nopportunity to adjust their energy consumption according to renewable energy\nprovision. In Denmark, Ewii, previously Barry, is a Danish energy supplier\nwhich provides householders with an opportunity to monitor energy sources in\nreal time through a technological solution of the same name. This paper use\nprovision afforded by Ewii as a case for exploring how householders organize\nthemselves to use a technological artefact that supports the monitoring of\nenergy and its related usage. This study aims to inform technology design\nthrough the derivation of four personas. The derived personas highlight the\ndifferences in energy monitoring practices for the householders and their\nengagement. These personas are characterised as dedicated, organised, sporadic,\nand convenient. Understanding these differences in energy monitoring practice\nusing the technological artefact form a solid element in the design of future\nenergy technologies that interfere with the everyday practices and energy\nconsumption for households. This is paramount for future energy related\ntechnology design, and for the clarification of usage assumptions that are\nembedded in the rollout of energy related technology as a country such as\nDenmark moves through its green transition.",

    "abstract": "State-of-the-art LiDAR-camera 3D object detectors usually focus on feature\nfusion. However, they neglect the factor of depth while designing the fusion\nstrategy. In this work, we are the first to observe that different modalities\nplay different roles as depth varies via statistical analysis and\nvisualization. Based on this finding, we propose a Depth-Aware Hybrid Feature\nFusion (DepthFusion) strategy that guides the weights of point cloud and RGB\nimage modalities by introducing depth encoding at both global and local levels.\nSpecifically, the Depth-GFusion module adaptively adjusts the weights of image\nBird's-Eye-View (BEV) features in multi-modal global features via depth\nencoding. Furthermore, to compensate for the information lost when transferring\nraw features to the BEV space, we propose a Depth-LFusion module, which\nadaptively adjusts the weights of original voxel features and multi-view image\nfeatures in multi-modal local features via depth encoding. Extensive\nexperiments on the nuScenes and KITTI datasets demonstrate that our DepthFusion\nmethod surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, our DepthFusion\nis more robust to various kinds of corruptions, outperforming previous methods\non the nuScenes-C dataset.",

In the current work, we propose a generic\nmethodology -- IRM-SP and IRM-SHOCK to obtain any class of global accretion and\nwind solutions, given a set of constants of motion. We have considered\nviscosity in the system, which transports angular momentum outwards. In\naddition, it heats the system. Radiative processes like bremsstrahlung which\ncools the system is also incorporated. An interplay between heating and cooling\nprocess, along with gravity and centrifugal forces gives rise to multiple sonic\npoints and hence shocks.

    "abstract": "The concept of statistical depth has received considerable attention as a way\nto extend the notions of the median and quantiles to other statistical models.\nThese procedures aim to formalize the idea of identifying deeply embedded fits\nto a model that are less influenced by contamination. Since contamination\nintroduces bias in estimators, it is well known in the location model that the\nmedian minimizes the worst-case performance, in terms of maximum bias, among\nall equivariant estimators. In the multivariate case, Tukey's median was a\ngroundbreaking concept for location estimation, and its counterpart for scatter\nmatrices has recently attracted considerable interest. The breakdown point and\nthe maximum asymptotic bias are key concepts used to summarize an estimator's\nbehavior under contamination. For the location and scale model, we consider two\nclosely related depth formulations, whose deepest estimators display\nsignificantly different behavior in terms of breakdown point. In the\nmultivariate setting, we analyze recently introduced concentration inequalities\nthat provide a unified framework for studying both the statistical convergence\nrate and robustness of Tukey's median and depth-based scatter matrices. We\nobserve that slight variations in these inequalities allow us to visualize the\nmaximum bias behavior of the deepest estimators. Since the maximum bias for\ndepth-based scatter matrices had not previously been derived, we explicitly\ncalculate both the breakdown point and the maximum bias curve for the deepest\nscatter matrices.",

A diverse range\nof material combinations, including hexagonal boron nitride, transition metal\ndichalcogenides and graphene, with electronic properties spanning from\ninsulating to semiconducting, metallic, and semimetallic, have been explored to\ntune the properties of these heterostacks.

Using synchrotron-based angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy,\nwe analyze the band structure of each layer, focusing on the charge transfer\nfrom K to the underlying 2D layers. Since K forms a $(2 \\times 2)$ overlayer\nwith respect to graphene, the amount of charge carriers donated by K can be\ndetermined. Our findings reveal that adsorption of K not only leads to a\nsignificant $n$-doping of the adjacent graphene layer but also to an electron\ntransfer into the Pb monolayer.

Assessing different characteristics of discursive\npractices and linking them to student learning achievement enhances the\nunderstanding of teaching quality. Traditional assessments rely on manual\ncoding of classroom observation protocols, which is time-consuming and costly.\nDespite many studies utilizing AI techniques to analyze classroom discourse at\nthe utterance level, investigations into the evaluation of discursive practices\nthroughout an entire lesson segment remain limited. To address this gap, our\nstudy proposes a novel text-centered multimodal fusion architecture to assess\nthe quality of three discourse components grounded in the Global Teaching\nInSights (GTI) observation protocol: Nature of Discourse, Questioning, and\nExplanations. First, we employ attention mechanisms to capture inter- and\nintra-modal interactions from transcript, audio, and video streams. Second, a\nmulti-task learning approach is adopted to jointly predict the quality scores\nof the three components. Third, we formulate the task as an ordinal\nclassification problem to account for rating level order. The effectiveness of\nthese designed elements is demonstrated through an ablation study on the GTI\nGermany dataset containing 92 videotaped math lessons. Our results highlight\nthe dominant role of text modality in approaching this task.

However, current methods primarily target scenes with\nconsistent illumination and struggle to accurately reconstruct 3D geometry in\nuncontrolled environments with transient occlusions or varying appearances.\nWhile some neural radiance field (NeRF)-based variants can better manage\nphotometric variations and transient objects in complex scenes, they are\ndesigned for novel view synthesis rather than precise surface reconstruction\ndue to limited surface constraints. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a\nnovel approach that applies multiple geometric constraints to the implicit\nsurface optimization process, enabling more accurate reconstructions from\nunconstrained image collections. First, we utilize sparse 3D points from\nstructure-from-motion (SfM) to refine the signed distance function estimation\nfor the reconstructed surface, with a displacement compensation to accommodate\nnoise in the sparse points. Additionally, we employ robust normal priors\nderived from a normal predictor, enhanced by edge prior filtering and\nmulti-view consistency constraints, to improve alignment with the actual\nsurface geometry. Extensive testing on the Heritage-Recon benchmark and other\ndatasets has shown that the proposed method can accurately reconstruct surfaces\nfrom in-the-wild images, yielding geometries with superior accuracy and\ngranularity compared to existing techniques. Our approach enables high-quality\n3D reconstruction of various landmarks, making it applicable to diverse\nscenarios such as digital preservation of cultural heritage sites.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel methodology for enhancing Automated Program\nRepair (APR) through synthetic data generation utilizing Large Language Models\n(LLMs). Current APR systems are constrained by the limited availability of\nhigh-quality training data encompassing diverse bug types across multiple\nprogramming languages. The proposed approach addresses this limitation through\na two-phase process: a synthetic sample generation followed by a rigorous\nquality assessment. Multiple state-of-the-art LLMs were employed to generate\napproximately 30,000 paired examples of buggy and fixed code across 12\nprogramming languages and 13 bug categories. Subsequently, these samples\nunderwent cross-model evaluation against five criteria: correctness, code\nquality, security, performance, and completeness. Experimental evaluation on\nthe VulRepair test set dataset showed statistically significant improvements in\nPerfect Prediction rates, with the quality-filtered synthetic dataset\noutperforming both baseline and real-world commit data configurations in\ncertain scenarios. The methodology was validated through rigorous statistical\ntesting, including ANOVA and post-hoc Tukey's Honest Significant Difference\nanalysis. Furthermore, the best-performing configurations surpassed existing\nsystems despite using a less computationally intensive decoding strategy. This\nresearch establishes a self-bootstrapping paradigm in which LLMs generate and\nevaluate their own training data, potentially transforming approaches to data\nscarcity across software engineering tasks and advancing the development of\nrobust, adaptable tools for automated code maintenance.",

Research in the cross-modal medical image\ntranslation domain has been very productive over the past few years in tackling\nthe scarce availability of large curated multimodality datasets with the\npromising performance of GAN-based architectures. However, only a few of these\nstudies assessed task-based related performance of these synthetic data,\nespecially for the training of deep models. Method. We design and compare\ndifferent GAN-based frameworks for generating synthetic brain\n[18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET images from T1 weighted MRI data. We first\nperform standard qualitative and quantitative visual quality evaluation. Then,\nwe explore further impact of using these fake PET data in the training of a\ndeep unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) model designed to detect subtle\nepilepsy lesions in T1 MRI and FDG PET images. We introduce novel diagnostic\ntask-oriented quality metrics of the synthetic FDG PET data tailored to our\nunsupervised detection task, then use these fake data to train a use case UAD\nmodel combining a deep representation learning based on siamese autoencoders\nwith a OC-SVM density support estimation model. This model is trained on normal\nsubjects only and allows the detection of any variation from the pattern of the\nnormal population. We compare the detection performance of models trained on 35\npaired real MR T1 of normal subjects paired either on 35 true PET images or on\n35 synthetic PET images generated from the best performing generative models.\nPerformance analysis is conducted on 17 exams of epilepsy patients undergoing\nsurgery. Results. The best performing GAN-based models allow generating\nrealistic fake PET images of control subject with SSIM and PSNR values around\n0.9 and 23.8, respectively and in distribution (ID) with regard to the true\ncontrol dataset. The best UAD model trained on these synthetic normative PET\ndata allows reaching 74% sensitivity. Conclusion. Our results confirm that\nGAN-based models are the best suited for MR T1 to FDG PET translation,\noutperforming transformer or diffusion models.

Its\noverall underbinding behavior can be effectively mitigated by a simple\ncorrection term, called renormalized single excitation (rSE) correction.\nAnalytical gradient calculations of the RPA energy have become increasingly\navailable, enabling structural relaxations and even molecular dynamics at the\nRPA level. However, such calculations at the RPA+rSE level have not been\nreported, due to the lack of the rSE analytical gradient. Here, we present the\nfirst formulation and implementation of the analytical gradients of the rSE\nenergy with respect to the nuclear coordinates within an atomic-orbital basis\nset framework, which allows us to assess the performance of RPA+rSE in\ndetermining the molecular geometries and energetics. It is found that the\nslight overestimation behavior of RPA for small covalently bonded molecules is\nstrengthened by rSE, while such behavior for molecules bonded with purely\ndispersion interactions is corrected. We further applied the approach to the\nwater clusters, and found that the energy difference between the low-energy\nisomers of water hexamers is almost unchanged when going from RPA to RPA+rSE\ngeometries. For the bigger WATER27 test set, using the RPA+rSE geometries\ninstead of the RPA ones leads to a slight reduction of the mean absolute error\nof RPA+rSE from 0.91 kcal/mol to 0.70 kcal/mol, at the complete basis set.",

Integrating the\nAttentional Gate Model (AGM) and Internal Clock Model (ICM), we examined how\nemotional valence and stress alter perceived duration in Virtual Reality (VR).\nThis study assesses the effects of valence (calming, neutral, stressful) and\nstress (low/high) on prospective time estimation, mood, and arousal. Methods:\nFifty-four adults (18-39 years) explored three custom VR environments: (1) a\ntranquil Japanese garden, (2) an affectively neutral room, and (3) a\nthreatening underground sewer. Active navigation promoted presence; a\ndistraction task separated conditions. Valence and arousal were assessed with\nthe Visual Analog Mood Scales, stress with the Perceived Stress Scale-10\n(PSS-10), and perceived duration with a verbal estimation task. Mixed-model\nANOVAs evaluated main and interaction effects. Results: Valence reliably shaped\nperceived duration: calming VR led to overestimation, stressful VR to\nunderestimation, and neutral VR to intermediate timing. Baseline stress level,\nas measured by PSS-10, neither altered timing nor interacted with valence.\nNevertheless, the VR environments affected VAMS' mood metrics: calming\nenvironments elevated mood and reduced perceived stress, whereas stressful\nenvironments lowered mood and heightened stress. Conclusions: Findings support\nthe AGM-attentionally demanding negative environments shorten perceived\ntime-and the ICM-valence-linked arousal speeds or slows the pacemaker. Contrary\nto classical predictions, in VR, baseline stress did not distort duration,\nsuggesting valence-driven attentional allocation outweighs pre-exposure stress\nlevels.

We show that existing methods train for these objectives separately\nand then search for recourse through a joint optimization over the recourse\ngoals during inference, leading to poor recourse recommendations.

It remains unclear how\nspatial coordination, positional perturbations, and large-scale topological\nconfigurations affect coherent signal aggregation and overall system\nperformance. This paper investigates the feasibility of achieving coherent\nbeamforming in such systems from both deterministic and stochastic\nperspectives. First, we develop a rigorous theoretical framework that\ncharacterizes the necessary and sufficient conditions for the emergence of\ngrating lobes in multiple linear configurations. Notably, we show that for dual\nlinear arrays, the classical half-wavelength spacing constraint can be safely\nrelaxed without introducing spatial aliasing. This result challenges\ntraditional array design principles and enables more flexible, collision-aware\ntopologies. Second, we present a theoretical analysis, supported by empirical\nvalidation, demonstrating that coherent gain can be approximately preserved\nunder realistic positional perturbations. Our results reveal that spatial\nperturbations introduce measurable degradation in the main lobe, an effect that\ncannot be mitigated merely by increasing the number of antennas.

The proposed system introduces a refined Soft\nActor-Critic (SAC) algorithm, leveraging a residual RL structure to enhance\nclassical controllers in real-time by integrating multi-step\nTemporal-Difference (TD) learning, an asynchronous training pipeline, and\nHeuristic Delayed Reward Adjustment (HDRA) to improve sample efficiency and\ntraining stability.

    "abstract": "Zirconium nitride (ZrN) is a refractory material with good mechanical and\nthermal properties. It is therefore a good candidate for hard surface treatment\nat high temperature. In this work, we report the growth and characterization of\nZrN by plasma assisted thermal nitridation of zirconium films in a NH3\natmosphere. The process was monitored by in situ monochromatic ellipsometry and\nthe nitrides grown were profiled and analyzed by Auger electron spectroscopy.\nBy using temperatures in the 700--800___{\\textdegree}C range, the material\nobtained is quite close to ZrN, but, depending on experimental conditions,\nresidual oxygen (impurities) can be easily incorporated by reaction with\nzirconium. The analysis of the ellipsometric data has shown that the\nnitridation did not occur by simple growth of nitride on zirconium. Auger\nprofiles confirmed the presence of an oxidized zirconium layer localized\nbetween the nitrided surface and the remaining metal. This oxidation was\nobserved to occur preferentially during temperature ramping, that is, in the\nlow temperature regime. At high temperature, nitridation is dominant and the\nincorporated oxygen is exchanged with nitrogen. Oxygen is then partly rejected\nby diffusion out of the film through the ZrN surface layer and partly by\ndiffusion in the deep zirconium sublayer. By using these observations, a new\nmodel of growth with a layered ZrN/ZrOx/Zr film was used to describe in situ\nellipsometric data. By comparing the pure thermal and the plasma treatments,\nthe advantages of the plasma assisted treatment become clearly: complete\nnitridation of the zirconium layer was achieved and the oxygen amounts in the\nfilm were substantially reduced.",

    "abstract": "Due to the scarcity of industrial data, individual equipment users,\nparticularly start-ups, struggle to independently train a comprehensive fault\ndiagnosis model; federated learning enables collaborative training while\nensuring data privacy, making it an ideal solution. However, the diversity of\nworking conditions leads to variations in fault modes, resulting in\ninconsistent label spaces across different clients. In federated diagnostic\nscenarios, label space inconsistency leads to local models focus on\nclient-specific fault modes and causes local models from different clients to\nmap different failure modes to similar feature representations, which weakens\nthe aggregated global model's generalization. To tackle this issue, this\narticle proposed a federated cross-domain diagnostic framework termed Federated\nInvariant Features Learning (FedIFL). In intra-client training, prototype\ncontrastive learning mitigates intra-client domain shifts, subsequently,\nfeature generating ensures local models can access distributions of other\nclients in a privacy-friendly manner. Besides, in cross-client training, a\nfeature disentanglement mechanism is introduced to mitigate cross-client domain\nshifts, specifically, an instance-level federated instance consistency loss is\ndesigned to ensure the instance-level consistency of invariant features between\ndifferent clients, furthermore, a federated instance personalization loss and\nan orthogonal loss are constructed to distinguish specific features that from\nthe invariant features. Eventually, the aggregated model achieves promising\ngeneralization among global label spaces, enabling accurate fault diagnosis for\ntarget clients' Motor Driven Systems (MDSs) with inconsistent label spaces.\nExperiments on real-world MDSs validate the effectiveness and superiority of\nFedIFL in federated cross-domain diagnosis with inconsistent fault modes.",

In contrast, Fock-state boson sampling\nhas been theoretically established as a means of achieving quantum supremacy.\nHowever, most existing experimental realizations of boson sampling to date have\nbeen based on Gaussian boson sampling, in which the input states consist of\nsqueezed states of light. In this work, we first introduce spin sampling for\narbitrary spin-$S$ states as a practical path to quantum supremacy. We\nidentified a quasi-linear scaling relation between the number of sites $m$ and\nthe number of spins $n$ as $m\\sim n^{1+\\epsilon}$, where $\\epsilon=3/(2S)$ is\ninversely proportional to the spin quantum number.

With the rise of Large Language Models shaping the future of deep\nlearning, this work extends ZC proxy applicability to Vision Transformers\n(ViTs). We present a new benchmark using the Autoformer search space evaluated\non 6 distinct tasks and propose Layer-Sample Wise Activation with Gradients\ninformation (L-SWAG), a novel, generalizable metric that characterizes both\nconvolutional and transformer architectures across 14 tasks. Additionally,\nprevious works highlighted how different proxies contain complementary\ninformation, motivating the need for a ML model to identify useful\ncombinations. To further enhance ZC-NAS, we therefore introduce LIBRA-NAS (Low\nInformation gain and Bias Re-Alignment), a method that strategically combines\nproxies to best represent a specific benchmark. Integrated into the NAS search,\nLIBRA-NAS outperforms evolution and gradient-based NAS techniques by\nidentifying an architecture with a 17.0% test error on ImageNet1k in just 0.1\nGPU days.",

To address this issue, we revisit the problem from the perspective\nof communication degrees of freedom. We demonstrate that a properly designed\nsparse array with optimized element spacing can effectively mitigate focal\nshift while enabling stable control of the focusing height during beam\nscanning. Simulation results based on dipole antennas with different\npolarizations and patch antennas validate our findings. Notably, with optimized\ninter-element distances, the energy distribution across focal points becomes\nnearly uniform, and highly accurate focusing positions are achieved.",

However, localness is a social and relational identity\nshaped by knowledge, participation, and community recognition. Drawing on the\nGerman philosopher Heidegger's concept of dwelling -- which extends beyond\nphysical presence to encompass meaningful connection to place -- we investigate\nhow people conceptualize and evaluate localness in both human and artificial\nagents. Using a chat-based interaction paradigm inspired by Turing's Imitation\nGame and Von Ahn's Games With A Purpose, we engaged 230 participants in\nconversations designed to examine the cues people rely on to assess local\npresence. Our findings reveal a multi-dimensional framework of localness,\nhighlighting differences in how locals and nonlocals emphasize various aspects\nof local identity. We show that people are significantly more accurate in\nrecognizing locals than nonlocals, suggesting that localness is an affirmative\nstatus requiring active demonstration rather than merely the absence of\nnonlocal traits. Additionally, we identify conditions under which artificial\nagents are perceived as local and analyze participants' sensemaking strategies\nin evaluating localness. Through predictive modeling, we determine key factors\nthat drive accurate localness judgments. By bridging theoretical perspectives\non human-place relationships with practical challenges in digital environments,\nour work informs the design of location-based services that foster meaningful\nlocal engagement.

    "abstract": "The precise timing of synaptic transmission in auditory hair cells is\nimportant to hearing and speech recognition. Neurotransmitter release is an\nunderlying step in translating sound. Thus, understanding nature of the\nsynaptic fusion is key to understand the hearing mechanism. Extraordinary large\nexcitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) have been observed in the auditory\nhair cell synapse, and its origin has been controversial. It is not known yet\nwhether the size and shape of the EPSCs are results of a big vesicle or many\nsmall vesicles. We report our numerical simulation of the vesicular fusion\nprocess from calcium channel process to the generation of EPSC currents. Our\nnumerical experiments indicate that the origin of the large EPSC with its\nmysterious form is close to the scenario of the multivesicular release. The\nlarge EPSCs might be triggered by strong calcium channeling of the calcium\nchannel clusters.",

    "abstract": "The Bradley-Terry (BT) model is widely practiced in reward modeling for\nreinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF). Despite its effectiveness,\nreward models (RMs) trained with BT model loss are prone to over-optimization,\nlosing generalizability to unseen input distributions. In this paper, we study\nthe cause of over-optimization in RM training and its downstream effects on the\nRLHF procedure, accentuating the importance of distributional robustness of RMs\nin unseen data. First, we show that the excessive dispersion of hidden state\nnorms is the main source of over-optimization. Then, we propose batch-wise\nsum-to-zero regularization (BSR) to enforce zero-centered reward sum per batch,\nconstraining the rewards with extreme magnitudes. We assess the impact of BSR\nin improving robustness in RMs through four scenarios of over-optimization,\nwhere BSR consistently manifests better robustness. Subsequently, we compare\nthe plain BT model and BSR on RLHF training and empirically show that robust\nRMs better align the policy to the gold preference model. Finally, we apply BSR\nto high-quality data and models, which surpasses state-of-the-art RMs in the 8B\nscale by adding more than 5% in complex preference prediction tasks. By\nconducting RLOO training with 8B RMs, AlpacaEval 2.0 reduces generation length\nby 40% while adding a 7% increase in win rate, further highlighting that\nrobustness in RMs induces robustness in RLHF training.

    "abstract": "The widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) in software\nengineering has amplified the role of natural language (NL). The inherent\nambiguity of NL threatens software quality, because ambiguous requirements may\nlead to faulty program generation. The complexity of ambiguity detection and\nresolution motivates us to introduce automated repair of ambiguous NL\nrequirements, which we approach by reducing code generation uncertainty and\naligning NL with input-output examples. Repairing ambiguity in requirements is\na difficult challenge for LLMs, as it demands metacognition - the model must\nunderstand how its own interpretation changes when the text is altered. Our\nexperiments show that directly prompting an LLM to detect and resolve\nambiguities results in irrelevant or inconsistent clarifications. Our key\ninsight is to decompose this problem into simpler sub-problems that do not\nrequire metacognitive reasoning. First, we analyze and repair the LLM's\ninterpretation of requirements embodied by the distribution of programs they\ninduce by using traditional testing and program repair. Second, we repair\nrequirements based on the changes to the distribution via contrastive\nspecification inference. We implemented this proposal, dubbed as SpecFix, and\nevaluated it by using three state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3 and\nQwen2.5-Coder-32b) across two widely used code generation benchmarks, namely\nHumanEval+ and MBPP+. Our results show that SpecFix, operating autonomously\nwithout human intervention or external information, modifies 23.93% of the\nrequirements, leading to a 33.66% improvement in model Pass@1 on the modified\nrequirements. Across the entire benchmark, this corresponds to an 4.3% increase\nin overall Pass@1. Importantly, SpecFix's repairs generalize across models:\nrequirements repaired by one model boost the performance of other models by\n9.6%.",

In contrast, we show three positive results: First, CCR-CS and\nCCR-CJ are solvable in linear and quadratic time, respectively, when $G$ is a\npath. Second, we show that CCR-CS is solvable in linear time for cographs.\nThird, when $\\mathcal{M}$ contains only the same elements (i.e., all connected\ncomponents have the same size), we show that CCR-CJ is solvable in linear time\nif $G$ is chordal.

The\nsteady-state position distributions of harmonically bound active Brownian\nparticles (HBABPs) exhibit a crossover from Boltzmann-like to bimodal, commonly\nrecognized as passive to active transition, upon variation of the activity and\nthe confinement strength. By studying optically trapped phoretically active\nJanus colloids, along with simulations and analytical calculations of HBABPs,\nwe provide a comprehensive dynamical description emphasizing the resultant\nvelocity to examine this understanding.

We trace the failure to loose\ncoupling between high-level (HL) sub-goal selection and low-level (LL)\ntrajectory generation, which leads to incoherent plans and degraded\nperformance. We propose Coupled Hierarchical Diffusion (CHD), a framework that\nmodels HL sub-goals and LL trajectories jointly within a unified diffusion\nprocess. A shared classifier passes LL feedback upstream so that sub-goals\nself-correct while sampling proceeds. This tight HL-LL coupling improves\ntrajectory coherence and enables scalable long-horizon diffusion planning.\nExperiments across maze navigation, tabletop manipulation, and household\nenvironments show that CHD consistently outperforms both flat and hierarchical\ndiffusion baselines.

    "abstract": "This work addresses the critical lack of precision in state estimation in the\nKalman filter for 3D multi-object tracking (MOT) and the ongoing challenge of\nselecting the appropriate motion model. Existing literature commonly relies on\nconstant motion models for estimating the states of objects, neglecting the\ncomplex motion dynamics unique to each object. Consequently, trajectory\ndivision and imprecise object localization arise, especially under occlusion\nconditions. The core of these challenges lies in the limitations of the current\nKalman filter formulation, which fails to account for the variability of motion\ndynamics as objects navigate their environments. This work introduces a novel\nformulation of the Kalman filter that incorporates motion dynamics, allowing\nthe motion model to adaptively adjust according to changes in the object's\nmovement. The proposed Kalman filter substantially improves state estimation,\nlocalization, and trajectory prediction compared to the traditional Kalman\nfilter. This is reflected in tracking performance that surpasses recent\nbenchmarks on the KITTI and Waymo Open Datasets, with margins of 0.56\\% and\n0.81\\% in higher order tracking accuracy (HOTA) and multi-object tracking\naccuracy (MOTA), respectively. Furthermore, the proposed Kalman filter\nconsistently outperforms the baseline across various detectors. Additionally,\nit shows an enhanced capability in managing long occlusions compared to the\nbaseline Kalman filter, achieving margins of 1.22\\% in higher order tracking\naccuracy (HOTA) and 1.55\\% in multi-object tracking accuracy (MOTA) on the\nKITTI dataset. The formulation's efficiency is evident, with an additional\nprocessing time of only approximately 0.078 ms per frame, ensuring its\napplicability in real-time applications.",

    "abstract": "Predicting future vehicle purchases among existing owners presents a critical\nchallenge due to extreme class imbalance (<0.5% positive rate) and complex\nbehavioral patterns. We propose REMEDI (Relative feature Enhanced Meta-learning\nwith Distillation for Imbalanced prediction), a novel multi-stage framework\naddressing these challenges. REMEDI first trains diverse base models to capture\ncomplementary aspects of user behavior. Second, inspired by comparative\nop-timization techniques, we introduce relative performance meta-features\n(deviation from ensemble mean, rank among peers) for effective model fusion\nthrough a hybrid-expert architecture. Third, we distill the ensemble's\nknowledge into a single efficient model via supervised fine-tuning with MSE\nloss, enabling practical deployment. Evaluated on approximately 800,000 vehicle\nowners, REMEDI significantly outperforms baseline approaches, achieving the\nbusiness target of identifying ~50% of actual buyers within the top 60,000\nrecommendations at ~10% precision. The distilled model preserves the ensemble's\npredictive power while maintaining deployment efficiency, demonstrating\nREMEDI's effectiveness for imbalanced prediction in industry settings.",

    "abstract": "Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs), which are the\ncontinuous-time analog of Residual Neural Networks (ResNets), have gained\nsignificant attention in recent years. Similarly, Neural Delay Differential\nEquations (Neural DDEs) can be interpreted as an infinite depth limit of\nDensely Connected Residual Neural Networks (DenseResNets). In contrast to\ntraditional ResNet architectures, DenseResNets are feed-forward networks that\nallow for shortcut connections across all layers. These additional connections\nintroduce memory in the network architecture, as typical in many modern\narchitectures. In this work, we explore how the memory capacity in neural DDEs\ninfluences the universal approximation property. The key parameter for studying\nthe memory capacity is the product $K \\tau$ of the Lipschitz constant and the\ndelay of the DDE. In the case of non-augmented architectures, where the network\nwidth is not larger than the input and output dimensions, neural ODEs and\nclassical feed-forward neural networks cannot have the universal approximation\nproperty. We show that if the memory capacity $K\\tau$ is sufficiently small,\nthe dynamics of the neural DDE can be approximated by a neural ODE.\nConsequently, non-augmented neural DDEs with a small memory capacity also lack\nthe universal approximation property. In contrast, if the memory capacity\n$K\\tau$ is sufficiently large, we can establish the universal approximation\nproperty of neural DDEs for continuous functions. If the neural DDE\narchitecture is augmented, we can expand the parameter regions in which\nuniversal approximation is possible. Overall, our results show that by\nincreasing the memory capacity $K\\tau$, the infinite-dimensional phase space of\nDDEs with positive delay $\\tau>0$ is not sufficient to guarantee a direct jump\ntransition to universal approximation, but only after a certain memory\nthreshold, universal approximation holds.",

However,\nMPC requires frequent inter-server communication, causing high performance\noverhead.\n  Inspired by the prevalent activation sparsity of LLMs, where most neuron are\nnot activated after non-linear activation functions, we propose an efficient\nprivate inference system, Comet.

While binary black holes produced\nthrough many formation channels have negligible eccentricity close to merger,\nthey often have a non-negligible eccentricity at formation, and dynamical\ninteractions could produce binaries with non-negligible eccentricity in the\nbands of current and proposed gravitational-wave (GW) detectors. Another\nquantity that carries information about the formation channel is the angle\nbetween each black hole's spin vector and the binary's orbital angular momentum\n(referred to as the spin tilt) at formation. The spin tilts inferred in GW\nastronomy are usually those when the binary is in the band of a GW detector,\nbut these can differ significantly from those at formation. Therefore, it is\nnecessary to evolve the binary back in time to compute the tilts at formation.\nFor many formation scenarios, the tilts in the formal limit of infinite orbital\nangular momentum, also known as tilts at infinity, are a good approximation to\nthose at formation. We thus generalize the publicly available\n\\texttt{tilts\\_at\\_infinity} code to compute the tilts at infinity for\neccentric, spin-precessing binaries. This code employs hybrid post-Newtonian\nevolution, starting with orbit-averaged evolution for higher frequencies and\nthen transitioning to precession-averaged evolution to compute the tilts at\ninfinity. We find that the transition frequency used in the quasicircular case\nstill gives acceptably small errors in the eccentric case, and show that\neccentricity and hybrid evolution both have a significant effect on the tilts\nat infinity for many binaries. Finally, we give examples of cases where the\ntilts at infinity are and are not a good approximation to the tilts at\nformation in the eccentric case.",

Unlike conventional periodic sampling, the\nproposed identification scheme employs aperiodic state sampling, leveraging the\nChebyshev nodes to achieve the desired approximation accuracy. Unlike\ntraditional off-line PS approaches, the scheme utilizes a moving time-window\nstrategy to compute the sampling instants (Chebyshev nodes) forward in time for\nstate measurements. Within each time window, the number of sampling instants is\nadaptively determined to meet the specified approximation accuracy. The\nChebyshev basis is also shifted for each time window to accommodate arbitrary\napproximation intervals. The least-squares approach is employed to estimate the\ncoefficients of the shifted Chebyshev basis functions using the measured state\nand its derivatives at the end of each window, resulting in a piecewise\napproximation of the drift dynamics of the system. In the second step, the\nidentified drift dynamics are utilized to design an adaptive state estimator to\nreconstruct the continuous system states from the aperiodic state measurements.\nTo address the smoothness of the piecewise approximated system dynamics, the\nChebyshev coefficients are recomputed at the window transition instants,\nbetween two consecutive time windows, by enforcing continuity of the\napproximated function and its derivatives.

    "abstract": "We investigate spatial confounding in the presence of multivariate disease\ndependence. In the \"analysis model perspective\" of spatial confounding, adding\na spatially dependent random effect can lead to significant variance inflation\nof the posterior distribution of the fixed effects. The \"data generation\nperspective\" views covariates as stochastic and correlated with an unobserved\nspatial confounder, leading to inferior statistical inference over multiple\nrealizations. While multiple methods have been proposed for adjusting\nstatistical models to mitigate spatial confounding in estimating regression\ncoefficients, results on interactions between spatial confounding and\nmultivariate dependence are very limited. We contribute to this domain by\ninvestigating spatial confounding from the analysis and data generation\nperspectives in a Bayesian coregionalized areal regression model. We derive\nnovel results that distinguish variance inflation due to spatial confounding\nfrom inflation based on multicollinearity between predictors and provide\ninsights into the estimation efficiency of a spatial estimator under a\nspatially confounded data generation model. We demonstrate favorable\nperformance of spatial analysis compared to a non-spatial model in our\nsimulation experiments even in the presence of spatial confounding and a\nmisspecified spatial structure. In this regard, we align with several other\nauthors in the defense of traditional hierarchical spatial models (Gilbert et\nal., 2025; Khan and Berrett, 2023; Zimmerman and Ver Hoef, 2022) and extend\nthis defense to multivariate areal models. We analyze county-level data from\nthe US on obesity / diabetes prevalence and diabetes-related cancer mortality,\ncomparing the results with and without spatial random effects.",

PG modes emerge from accidental\ndegeneracies lifted by quantum and thermal fluctuations, leading to a finite\ngap--a phenomenon known as \"order by disorder.\" In this paper, we derive a\ngeneral curvature formula for the PG gap at finite temperature, applicable to\nboth collinear (e.g., ferromagnets and anti-ferromagnets) and noncollinear\nmagnetic orders (e.g., coplanar orders in frustrated magnetic systems). After\nvalidating our formula against known models, we apply it to the XXZ model on\nthe triangular lattice, which hosts coplanar magnetic orders in equilibrium and\nis relevant to materials such as Na2BaCo(PO4)2 and K2Co(SeO3)2, known for their\nsupersolid phases and giant magnetocaloric effects. Our results reveal a\ndistinct scaling behavior: a linear decrease of the PG gap with temperature,\ndriven by entropy effects from magnon scattering across multiple bands. This\nstands in stark contrast to the high-temperature scaling recently proposed for\nsystems with a single magnon band.

This agrees with\ngeneral proposals by Li. We use the SYZ transform, the toric gamma theorem, and\ntoric homological mirror symmetry in order to reduce the statement to one about\nsupercritical deformed Hermitian Yang-Mills connections, known as the\nNakai-Moishezon criterion. As an application, we prove that, on the mirror of a\ntoric weak del Pezzo surface, if $L$ defines a Bridgeland stable object in the\nFukaya-Seidel category in a natural sense, then it is Hamiltonian isotopic to a\nspecial Lagrangian section in the class. The converse also holds for the mirror\nof the projective plane blown-up at one or two points, and always holds\nassuming a conjecture of Arcara and Miles.

Despite increasing\nawareness of their existence, the specific linguistic and emotional strategies\nemployed by these campaigns remain underexplored. This study addresses this gap\nby conducting a comprehensive analysis of sentiment, emotional valence, and\nabusive language across 2 million tweets attributed to influence operations\nlinked to China, Iran, and Russia, using Twitter's publicly released dataset of\nstate-affiliated accounts. We identify distinct affective and rhetorical\npatterns that characterize each nation's digital propaganda.

Since the DMI plays a\ncritical role in generating topological spin textures (TSTs) such as the chiral\nsoliton, the magnetic skyrmion, and the magnetic hedgehog, electric-field\ncontrols of these TSTs have become an important issue. This paper shows that\nsuch electric-field-induced DMI indeed creates and annihilates TSTs by\nnumerically solving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation for many-body\nspin systems at finite temperatures. We show that when a strong electric field\nis applied in a proper way to one- or two-dimensional ferromagnets, the\nHamiltonians are changed into the well-known spin models for the chiral soliton\nor the skyrmion lattice, and the TST states emerge. We utilize a\nmachine-learning method to count the number of generated TSTs. In the\nthree-dimensional (3D) case, we demonstrate the electric-field induction of a\nmagnetic hedgehog structure as follows: Applying a strong enough electric field\nalong a proper direction to a skyrmion-string state (a triple-$\\boldsymbol{q}$\nstate) at low but finite temperatures, we find that the field-induced DMI can\ndrive a quadruple-$\\boldsymbol{q}$ state with hedgehog-antihedgehog pairs.

    "abstract": "Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) try to make the decision-making process\ntransparent by exploring an intermediate concept space between the input image\nand the output prediction. Existing CBMs just learn coarse-grained relations\nbetween the whole image and the concepts, less considering local image\ninformation, leading to two main drawbacks: i) they often produce spurious\nvisual-concept relations, hence decreasing model reliability; and ii) though\nCBMs could explain the importance of every concept to the final prediction, it\nis still challenging to tell which visual region produces the prediction. To\nsolve these problems, this paper proposes a Disentangled Optimal Transport CBM\n(DOT-CBM) framework to explore fine-grained visual-concept relations between\nlocal image patches and concepts. Specifically, we model the concept prediction\nprocess as a transportation problem between the patches and concepts, thereby\nachieving explicit fine-grained feature alignment. We also incorporate\northogonal projection losses within the modality to enhance local feature\ndisentanglement. To further address the shortcut issues caused by statistical\nbiases in the data, we utilize the visual saliency map and concept label\nstatistics as transportation priors. Thus, DOT-CBM can visualize inversion\nheatmaps, provide more reliable concept predictions, and produce more accurate\nclass predictions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed\nDOT-CBM achieves SOTA performance on several tasks, including image\nclassification, local part detection and out-of-distribution generalization.",

    "abstract": "Besides typical generative applications, like ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and\nCursor, we observe an emerging trend that LLMs are increasingly used in\ntraditional discriminative tasks, such as recommendation, credit verification,\nand data labeling. The key characteristic of these emerging use cases is that\nthe LLM generates only a single output token, rather than an arbitrarily long\nsequence of tokens. We call this prefill-only workload. However, since existing\nLLM engines assume arbitrary output lengths, they fail to leverage the unique\nproperties of prefill-only workloads. In this paper, we present PrefillOnly,\nthe first LLM inference engine that improves the inference throughput and\nlatency by fully embracing the properties of prefill-only workloads. First,\nsince it generates only one token, PrefillOnly only needs to store the KV cache\nof only the last computed layer, rather than of all layers. This drastically\nreduces the GPU memory footprint of LLM inference and allows handling long\ninputs without using solutions that reduces throughput, such as cross-GPU KV\ncache parallelization. Second, because the output length is fixed, rather than\narbitrary, PrefillOnly can precisely determine the job completion time (JCT) of\neach prefill-only request before it starts. This enables efficient JCT-aware\nscheduling policies such as shortest remaining job first. PrefillOnly can\nprocess upto 4x larger queries per second without inflating average and P99\nlatency.",

Only 19 such stars, known as\n'Main-sequence Radio Pulse emitters' (MRPs) are currently known. The majority\nof MRPs have been discovered through targeted observation campaigns that\ninvolve carefully selecting a sample of stars that are likely to produce ECME,\nand which can be detected by a given telescope within reasonable amount of\ntime. These selection criteria inadvertently introduce bias in the resulting\nsample of MRPs, which affects subsequent investigation of the relation between\nECME properties and stellar magnetospheric parameters. The alternative is to\nuse all-sky surveys. Until now, MRP candidates obtained from surveys were\nidentified based on their high circular polarisation ($\\gtrsim 30\\%$). In this\npaper, we introduce a complementary strategy, which does not require\npolarisation information. Using multi-epoch data from the Australian SKA\nPathfinder (ASKAP) telescope, we identify four MRP candidates based on the\nvariability in the total intensity light curves. Follow-up observations with\nthe Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) confirm three of them to be MRPs,\nthereby demonstrating the effectiveness of our strategy. With the expanded\nsample, we find that ECME is affected by temperature and the magnetic field\nstrength, consistent with past results. There is, however, a degeneracy\nregarding how the two parameters govern the ECME luminosity for magnetic A and\nlate-B stars (effective temperature $\\lesssim 16$ kK). The current sample is\nalso inadequate to investigate the role of stellar rotation, which has been\nshown to play a key role in driving incoherent radio emission.",

RIS can be categorized into multiple types based on their\nreflective/transmissive modes and polarization control capabilities, all of\nwhich are expected to be widely deployed in practical environments. A reliable\nRIS channel model is essential for the design and development of RIS\ncommunication systems. While deterministic modeling approaches such as\nray-tracing (RT) offer significant benefits, a unified model that accommodates\nall RIS types is still lacking. This paper addresses this gap by developing a\nhigh-precision deterministic channel model based on RT, supporting multiple RIS\ntypes: reflective, transmissive, hybrid, and three polarization operation\nmodes. To achieve this, a unified EM response model for the aforementioned RIS\ntypes is developed. The reflection and transmission coefficients of RIS\nelements are derived using a tensor-based equivalent impedance approach,\nfollowed by calculating the scattered fields of the RIS to establish an EM\nresponse model. The performance of different RIS types is compared through\nsimulations in typical scenarios. During this process, passive and lossless\nconstraints on the reflection and transmission coefficients are incorporated to\nensure fairness in the performance evaluation. Simulation results validate the\nframework's accuracy in characterizing the RIS channel, and specific cases\ntailored for dual-polarization independent control and polarization rotating\nRISs are highlighted as insights for their future deployment.

Floquet engineering aims at generation of\nlight-induced Berry curvature associated with topological phase transition in\nsolids, which may manifest itself as a light-induced anomalous Hall effect.\nHowever, recent studies have pointed out an important role of the bias electric\nfield, which adds a field-induced circular photogalvanic effect to the\nphotovoltaic Hall effect. Except for numerical studies, the two mechanisms have\nbeen described by different theoretical frameworks, hindering a coherent\nunderstanding. Here, we develop a unified theory of the photovoltaic Hall\neffect capable of describing both mechanisms on an equal footing. We reveal\nthat the bias electric field alters the interband transition dipole moment,\ntransition energy, and intraband velocity, all contributing to the\nfield-induced circular photogalvanic effect in nonmagnetic materials. The first\nprocess can be expressed as a manifestation of the electric field-induced Berry\ncurvature. Shift vector plays an essential role in determining the transition\nenergy shift. We also clearly distinguish the anomalous Hall effect by\nlight-dressed states within the density matrix calculation using the length\ngauge. Our theory unifies a number of nonlinear optical processes in a\nphysically transparent way and reveals their geometric aspect.",

While sparse\nrepresentations offer a more efficient alternative by avoiding dense BEV\nprocessing, existing methods often lag behind due to the lack of tailored\ndesigns. These limitations have hindered the competitiveness of sparse\nrepresentations in online HD map construction. In this work, we systematically\nrevisit and enhance sparse representation techniques, identifying key\narchitectural and algorithmic improvements that bridge the gap with--and\nultimately surpass--dense approaches. We introduce a dedicated network\narchitecture optimized for sparse map feature extraction, a sparse-dense\nsegmentation auxiliary task to better leverage geometric and semantic cues, and\na denoising module guided by physical priors to refine predictions. Through\nthese enhancements, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the\nnuScenes dataset, significantly advancing HD map construction and centerline\ndetection.

    "abstract": "Evaluating generative models for synthetic medical imaging is crucial yet\nchallenging, especially given the high standards of fidelity, anatomical\naccuracy, and safety required for clinical applications. Standard evaluation of\ngenerated images often relies on no-reference image quality metrics when ground\ntruth images are unavailable, but their reliability in this complex domain is\nnot well established. This study comprehensively assesses commonly used\nno-reference image quality metrics using brain MRI data, including tumour and\nvascular images, providing a representative exemplar for the field. We\nsystematically evaluate metric sensitivity to a range of challenges, including\nnoise, distribution shifts, and, critically, localised morphological\nalterations designed to mimic clinically relevant inaccuracies. We then compare\nthese metric scores against model performance on a relevant downstream\nsegmentation task, analysing results across both controlled image perturbations\nand outputs from different generative model architectures. Our findings reveal\nsignificant limitations: many widely-used no-reference image quality metrics\ncorrelate poorly with downstream task suitability and exhibit a profound\ninsensitivity to localised anatomical details crucial for clinical validity.\nFurthermore, these metrics can yield misleading scores regarding distribution\nshifts, e.g. data memorisation. This reveals the risk of misjudging model\nreadiness, potentially leading to the deployment of flawed tools that could\ncompromise patient safety. We conclude that ensuring generative models are\ntruly fit for clinical purpose requires a multifaceted validation framework,\nintegrating performance on relevant downstream tasks with the cautious\ninterpretation of carefully selected no-reference image quality metrics.",

By systematically\nreplacing each removed spin with an effective interaction among its neighbors,\nour method lowers the total spin count without invoking approximations or\niterative recalculations. This capability is especially beneficial for\nhardware-constrained platforms, classical or quantum, that can directly\nimplement multi-body interactions but have limited qubit or spin resources. We\ndemonstrate three key advances enabled by this technique. First, we handle\nlarger instances of benchmark problems such as Max-Cut on cubic graphs without\nexceeding a 2-local interaction limit. Second, we reduce qubit requirements in\nQAOA-based integer factorization on near-term quantum devices, thus extending\nthe feasible range of integers to be factorized. Third, we improve memory\ncapacity in Hopfield associative memories and enhance memory retrieval by\nsuppressing spurious attractors, enhancing retrieval performance. Our\nspin-elimination procedure trades local spin complexity for higher-order\ncouplings or higher node degrees in a single pass, opening new avenues for\nscaling up combinatorial optimization and energy-based machine learning on\nnear-term hardware.

    "abstract": "The increasing volume of healthcare textual data requires computationally\nefficient, yet highly accurate classification approaches able to handle the\nnuanced and complex nature of medical terminology. This research presents\nKnowledge Distillation for Healthcare Multi-Label Text Classification\n(KDH-MLTC), a framework leveraging model compression and Large Language Models\n(LLMs). The proposed approach addresses conventional healthcare Multi-Label\nText Classification (MLTC) challenges by integrating knowledge distillation and\nsequential fine-tuning, subsequently optimized through Particle Swarm\nOptimization (PSO) for hyperparameter tuning. KDH-MLTC transfers knowledge from\na more complex teacher LLM (i.e., BERT) to a lighter student LLM (i.e.,\nDistilBERT) through sequential training adapted to MLTC that preserves the\nteacher's learned information while significantly reducing computational\nrequirements. As a result, the classification is enabled to be conducted\nlocally, making it suitable for healthcare textual data characterized by\nsensitivity and, therefore, ensuring HIPAA compliance. The experiments\nconducted on three medical literature datasets of different sizes, sampled from\nthe Hallmark of Cancer (HoC) dataset, demonstrate that KDH-MLTC achieves\nsuperior performance compared to existing approaches, particularly for the\nlargest dataset, reaching an F1 score of 82.70%. Additionally, statistical\nvalidation and an ablation study are carried out, proving the robustness of\nKDH-MLTC. Furthermore, the PSO-based hyperparameter optimization process\nallowed the identification of optimal configurations. The proposed approach\ncontributes to healthcare text classification research, balancing efficiency\nrequirements in resource-constrained healthcare settings with satisfactory\naccuracy demands.",

    "abstract": "Effective feedback is essential for refining instructional practices in\nmathematics education, and researchers often turn to advanced natural language\nprocessing (NLP) models to analyze classroom dialogues from multiple\nperspectives. However, utterance-level discourse analysis encounters two\nprimary challenges: (1) multifunctionality, where a single utterance may serve\nmultiple purposes that a single tag cannot capture, and (2) the exclusion of\nmany utterances from domain-specific discourse move classifications, leading to\ntheir omission in feedback. To address these challenges, we proposed a\nmulti-perspective discourse analysis that integrates domain-specific talk moves\nwith dialogue act (using the flattened multi-functional SWBD-MASL schema with\n43 tags) and discourse relation (applying Segmented Discourse Representation\nTheory with 16 relations). Our top-down analysis framework enables a\ncomprehensive understanding of utterances that contain talk moves, as well as\nutterances that do not contain talk moves. This is applied to two mathematics\neducation datasets: TalkMoves (teaching) and SAGA22 (tutoring). Through\ndistributional unigram analysis, sequential talk move analysis, and multi-view\ndeep dive, we discovered meaningful discourse patterns, and revealed the vital\nrole of utterances without talk moves, demonstrating that these utterances, far\nfrom being mere fillers, serve crucial functions in guiding, acknowledging, and\nstructuring classroom discourse. These insights underscore the importance of\nincorporating discourse relations and dialogue acts into AI-assisted education\nsystems to enhance feedback and create more responsive learning environments.\nOur framework may prove helpful for providing human educator feedback, but also\naiding in the development of AI agents that can effectively emulate the roles\nof both educators and students.",

    "abstract": "Despite the widespread adoption of Shannon's confusion-diffusion architecture\nin image encryption, the implementation of diffusion to sequentially establish\ninter-pixel dependencies for attaining plaintext sensitivity constrains\nalgorithmic parallelism, while the execution of multiple rounds of diffusion\noperations to meet the required sensitivity metrics incurs excessive\ncomputational overhead. Consequently, the pursuit of plaintext sensitivity\nthrough diffusion operations is the primary factor limiting the computational\nefficiency and throughput of video encryption algorithms, rendering them\ninadequate to meet the demands of real-time encryption for high-resolution\nvideo. To address the performance limitation, this paper proposes a real-time\nvideo encryption protocol based on heterogeneous parallel computing, which\nincorporates the SHA-256 hashes of original frames as input, employs multiple\nCPU threads to concurrently generate encryption-related data, and deploys\nnumerous GPU threads to simultaneously encrypt pixels. By leveraging the\nextreme input sensitivity of the SHA hash, the proposed protocol achieves the\nrequired plaintext sensitivity metrics with only a single round of confusion\nand XOR operations, significantly reducing computational overhead. Furthermore,\nthrough eliminating the reliance on diffusion, it realizes the allocation of a\ndedicated GPU thread for encrypting each pixel within every channel,\neffectively enhancing algorithm's parallelism.

    "abstract": "Traditional topic models often struggle with contextual nuances and fail to\nadequately handle polysemy and rare words. This limitation typically results in\ntopics that lack coherence and quality. Large Language Models (LLMs) can\nmitigate this issue by generating an initial set of topics. However, these raw\ntopics frequently lack refinement and representativeness, which leads to\nredundancy without lexical similarity and reduced interpretability. This paper\nintroduces HAMLET, a graph-driven architecture for cross-lingual healthcare\ntopic modeling that uses LLMs. The proposed approach leverages neural-enhanced\nsemantic fusion to refine the embeddings of topics generated by the LLM.\nInstead of relying solely on statistical co-occurrence or human interpretation\nto extract topics from a document corpus, this method introduces a topic\nembedding refinement that uses Bidirectional Encoder Representations from\nTransformers (BERT) and Graph Neural Networks (GNN). After topic generation, a\nhybrid technique that involves BERT and Sentence-BERT (SBERT) is employed for\nembedding. The topic representations are further refined using a GNN, which\nestablishes connections between documents, topics, words, similar topics, and\nsimilar words. A novel method is introduced to compute similarities.\nConsequently, the topic embeddings are refined, and the top k topics are\nextracted. Experiments were conducted using two healthcare datasets, one in\nEnglish and one in French, from which six sets were derived. The results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of HAMLET.",

A critical step in this process is the development of complex Boolean\nqueries to retrieve relevant literature.

One of the first studies,Wang et al.,\ninvestigated ChatGPT for this task, followed by Staudinger et al., which\nevaluated multiple LLMs in a reproducibility study. However, the latter\noverlooked several key aspects of the original work, including (i) validation\nof generated queries, (ii) output formatting constraints, and (iii) selection\nof examples for chain-of-thought (Guided) prompting.
