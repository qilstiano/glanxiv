    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in text generation and understanding,\nespecially in simulating socio-political and economic patterns, serving as an\nalternative to traditional surveys. However, their global applicability remains\nquestionable due to unexplored biases across socio-demographic and geographic\ncontexts. This study examines how LLMs perform across diverse populations by\nanalyzing public surveys from Chile and the United States, focusing on\npredictive accuracy and fairness metrics. The results show performance\ndisparities, with LLM consistently outperforming on U.S. datasets. This bias\noriginates from the U.S.-centric training data, remaining evident after\naccounting for socio-demographic differences. In the U.S., political identity\nand race significantly influence prediction accuracy, while in Chile, gender,\neducation, and religious affiliation play more pronounced roles. Our study\npresents a novel framework for measuring socio-demographic biases in LLMs,\noffering a path toward ensuring fairer and more equitable model performance\nacross diverse socio-cultural contexts.",

Modeling the polymer melt flow\nextrusion-deposition process is important in understanding the development of\nthe inherent microstructure within the print beads, particularly the\nmicro-voids formation and growth which significantly affects the resulting\nmaterial properties and part performance. The current research presents a\ncomputational-based approach for investigating process-induced micro-voids and\ntheir impact on print properties. We develop a multiscale FEA simulation tool\nto predict global and local flow-fields during the polymer-melt flow process to\ninvestigate underlying mechanisms that may promote the micro-void development\nwithin the bead microstructure specifically the occurrence of low-pressure\nregions at sites of stress concentration such as at the tips of suspended\nfibers and at locations with abrupt changes in flow direction like the\ndie-swell region just after the nozzle exit. The research also investigates\npotential factors that may influence the growth and development of these\nmicro-voids such as the suspension viscosity and shear-thinning polymer melt\nrheology, the size and geometry of the reinforcing particles, etc. Furthermore,\nthe research presents a method for quantifying and characterizing micro-voids\nwithin printed beads and assessing their impact on the effective material\nproperties.

Hosting Capacity Assessment (HCA) is a critical tool for\nevaluating how much DER capacity a grid can handle without breaching\noperational limits. HCA serves multiple goals: enabling higher DER penetration,\naccelerating grid connection times, guiding infrastructure upgrades or flexible\nresource deployment, ensuring equitable policies, and improving grid\nflexibility while minimizing curtailment. HCA lacks a universal definition,\nvarying by modelling approaches, uncertainty considerations, and objectives.\nThis paper addresses five key questions to standardize and enhance HCA\npractices. First, it classifies HCA objectives associated with different\nstakeholders such as system operators, consumers, market operators and\nconsumers. Second, it examines model attributes, including modelling\nsophistication, data requirements, and uncertainty handling, thus balancing\ncomplexity with computational efficiency. Third, it explores HCA applications,\nsuch as planning grid investments or operational decisions, and summarizes use\ncases associated with HCA. Fourth, it emphasizes the need for periodic updates\nto reflect dynamic grid conditions, evolving technologies, and new DER\ninstallations.

    "abstract": "Contextual pricing strategies are prevalent in online retailing, where the\nseller adjusts prices based on products' attributes and buyers'\ncharacteristics. Although such strategies can enhance seller's profits, they\nraise concerns about fairness when significant price disparities emerge among\nspecific groups, such as gender or race. These disparities can lead to adverse\nperceptions of fairness among buyers and may even violate the law and\nregulation. In contrast, price differences can incentivize disadvantaged buyers\nto strategically manipulate their group identity to obtain a lower price. In\nthis paper, we investigate contextual dynamic pricing with fairness\nconstraints, taking into account buyers' strategic behaviors when their group\nstatus is private and unobservable from the seller. We propose a dynamic\npricing policy that simultaneously achieves price fairness and discourages\nstrategic behaviors. Our policy achieves an upper bound of $O(\\sqrt{T}+H(T))$\nregret over $T$ time horizons, where the term $H(T)$ arises from buyers'\nassessment of the fairness of the pricing policy based on their learned price\ndifference. When buyers are able to learn the fairness of the price policy,\nthis upper bound reduces to $O(\\sqrt{T})$. We also prove an $\\Omega(\\sqrt{T})$\nregret lower bound of any pricing policy under our problem setting. We support\nour findings with extensive experimental evidence, showcasing our policy's\neffectiveness. In our real data analysis, we observe the existence of price\ndiscrimination against race in the loan application even after accounting for\nother contextual information. Our proposed pricing policy demonstrates a\nsignificant improvement, achieving 35.06% reduction in regret compared to the\nbenchmark policy.",

However, real-world sensor data often exhibits irregular sampling due\nto, for example, hardware constraints, power-saving measures, or communication\ndelays, posing challenges for deployed static HAR models. This study assesses\nthe impact of sampling irregularities on HAR by simulating irregular data\nthrough two methods: introducing slight inconsistencies in sampling intervals\n(timestamp variations) to mimic sensor jitter, and randomly removing data\npoints (random dropout) to simulate missing values due to packet loss or sensor\nfailure. We evaluate both discrete-time neural networks and continuous-time\nneural networks, which are designed to handle continuous-time data, on three\npublic datasets. We demonstrate that timestamp variations do not significantly\naffect the performance of discrete-time neural networks, and the\ncontinuous-time neural network is also ineffective in addressing the challenges\nposed by irregular sampling, possibly due to limitations in modeling complex\ntemporal patterns with missing data. Our findings underscore the necessity for\nnew models or approaches that can robustly handle sampling irregularity in\ntime-series data, like the reading in human activity recognition, paving the\nway for future research in this domain.",

In\nthese applications, jobs/tasks are held by selfish entities that do not want to\ncoordinate with each other, yet the goal is to balance the load among servers\nin a distributed manner. First, we provide a static game formulation in which\neach player holds a job with a specific processing requirement and wants to\nschedule it fractionally among a set of heterogeneous servers to minimize its\naverage processing time. We show that this static game is a potential game with\na pure Nash equilibrium (NE). In particular, the best-response dynamics\nconverge to such an NE after $n$ iterations, where $n$ is the number of\nplayers. Additionally, we bound the price of anarchy (PoA) of the static game\nin terms of game parameters. We then extend our results to a dynamic game\nsetting, where jobs arrive and get processed, and players observe the load on\nthe servers to decide how to schedule their jobs. In this setting, we show that\nif the players update their strategies using dynamic best-response, the system\neventually becomes fully load-balanced and the players' strategies converge to\nthe pure NE of the static game. In particular, we show that the convergence\ntime scales only polynomially with respect to the game parameters.

Second, we do not observe any plateau of decoding\nperformance as the amount of training data increases. Rather, decoding\nperformance scales log-linearly with the amount of brain recording.

A local search\nstrategy, including 2-opt and 3-opt techniques, is applied to improve the\nsolution after updating the particle positions. The performance of the proposed\nPSO algorithm is evaluated using benchmark TSP instances and compared to other\npopular optimization algorithms, such as Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Simulated\nAnnealing (SA). Results show that PSO performs well for small to medium-sized\nproblems, though its performance diminishes for larger instances due to\ndifficulties in escaping local optima. This paper concludes that PSO is a\npromising approach for solving TSP, with potential for further improvement\nthrough hybridization with other optimization techniques.",

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) allows collaborative model training among distributed\nparties without pooling local datasets at a central server. However, the\ndistributed nature of FL poses challenges in training fair federated learning\nmodels. The existing techniques are often limited in offering fairness\nflexibility to clients and performance. We formally define and empirically\nanalyze a simple and intuitive post-processing-based framework to improve group\nfairness in FL systems. This framework can be divided into two stages: a\nstandard FL training stage followed by a completely decentralized local\ndebiasing stage. In the first stage, a global model is trained without fairness\nconstraints using a standard federated learning algorithm (e.g. FedAvg). In the\nsecond stage, each client applies fairness post-processing on the global model\nusing their respective local dataset. This allows for customized fairness\nimprovements based on clients' desired and context-guided fairness\nrequirements. We demonstrate two well-established post-processing techniques in\nthis framework: model output post-processing and final layer fine-tuning. We\nevaluate the framework against three common baselines on four different\ndatasets, including tabular, signal, and image data, each with varying levels\nof data heterogeneity across clients. Our work shows that this framework not\nonly simplifies fairness implementation in FL but also provides significant\nfairness improvements with minimal accuracy loss or even accuracy gain, across\ndata modalities and machine learning methods, being especially effective in\nmore heterogeneous settings.",

In this paper, we investigate the following\noverarching research question: can VR applications and VR user activities in\nthe context of such applications (e.g., manipulating virtual objects, walking,\ntalking, flying) be identified based on the (potentially encrypted) network\ntraffic that is generated by VR headsets during the operation of VR\napplications? To answer this question, we collect network traffic data from 25\nVR applications running on the Meta Quest Pro headset and identify\ncharacteristics of the generated network traffic, which we subsequently use to\ntrain off-the-shelf Machine Learning (ML) models. Our results indicate that\nthrough the use of ML models, we can identify the VR applications being used\nwith an accuracy of 92.4% and the VR user activities performed with an accuracy\nof 91%. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that an attacker does not need to\ncollect large amounts of network traffic data for each VR application to carry\nout such an attack.

Traditional\nquantum mechanics corresponds to a single quadratic constraint of wavefunction\nnormalization.

The SQM stationary problem is equivalent to a new algebraic\nproblem that we address in this paper. The SQM non-stationary problem considers\nthe evolution of a quantum system itself, distinct from the explicit time\ndependence of the Hamiltonian, $H(t)$. Two options for the SQM dynamic equation\nare considered: (1) within the framework of linear maps from higher-order\nquantum theory, where 2D-type quantum circuits are introduced to transform one\nquantum system into another; and (2) in the form of a Gross-Pitaevskii-type\nnonlinear map. Although no known physical process currently describes such 2D\ndynamics, this approach naturally bridges direct and inverse quantum mechanics\nproblems, allowing for the development of a new type of computer algorithms.\nBeyond computer modeling, the developed theory could be directly applied if or\nwhen a physical process capable of solving a quantum inverse problem in a\nsingle measurement act (analogous to how an eigenvalue arises from a\nmeasurement in traditional quantum mechanics) is discovered in the future.",

    "abstract": "We consider guarded negation transitive closure logic (GNTC). In this paper,\nwe show that the satisfiability problem for GNTC is in 2-EXPTIME (hence,\n2-EXPTIME-complete from existing lower bound results), which improves the\npreviously known non-elementary time upper bound. This extends previously known\n2-EXPTIME upper bound results, e.g., for the guarded negation fragment of\nfirst-order logic, the unary negation fragment of first-order logic with\nregular path expressions, propositional dynamic logic (PDL) with intersection\nand converse, and CPDL+ (an extension of PDL with conjunctive queries) of\nbounded treewidth. To this end, we present a sound and complete local model\nchecker on tree decompositions. This system has a closure property of size\nsingle exponential, and it induces a reduction from the satisfiability problem\nfor GNTC into the non-emptiness problem for 2-way (weak) alternating parity\ntree automata in single exponential time. Additionally, we investigate the\ncomplexity of satisfiability and model checking for fragments of GNTC, such as\nguarded (quantification) fragments, unary negation fragments, and existential\npositive fragments.",

Since\nthe number of analytes varies from one microbead (or microlaser) to another due\nto the randomness in binding processes, a distribution of the analytes (and\nhence the quenchers) in the ME is created, which in turn leads to a lasing\nthreshold distribution in the ME.

In BDG, in which we find the largest value for $H_0$ among the models\nconsidered, the combination of Planck and DESI is consistent with CCHP results\nand reduces the $H_0$ tension with the SH0ES measurement to $1.2\\sigma$\n(compared to $4.5\\sigma$ of $\\Lambda$CDM in our Planck + DESI analysis).",

With a recent explosion in technology to facilitate the\ncollection of dynamic self-response data for which mechanisms underlying\nmissing data are inherently scientifically informative, this limitation in\nstatistical methodology also limits scientific advancement. The goal of this\narticle is to develop the first statistical methodology for modeling, fitting,\nand conducting inference on stochastic volatility with data that are missing\nnot at random. The approach is based upon a novel imputation method derived\nusing Tukey's representation, which utilizes the Markovian nature of stochastic\nvolatility models to overcome unidentifiable components often faced when\nmodeling informative missingness in other settings. This imputation method is\ncombined with a new conditional particle filtering with ancestor sampling\nprocedure that accounts for variability in imputation to formulate a complete\nparticle Gibbs sampling scheme.

    "abstract": "The ever-increasing size of large language models (LLMs) presents significant\nchallenges for deployment due to their heavy computational and memory\nrequirements. Current model pruning techniques attempt to alleviate these\nissues by relying heavily on external calibration datasets to determine which\nparameters to prune or compress, thus limiting their flexibility and\nscalability across different compression ratios. Moreover, these methods often\ncause severe performance degradation, particularly in downstream tasks, when\nsubjected to higher compression rates. In this paper, we propose PruneNet, a\nnovel model compression method that addresses these limitations by\nreformulating model pruning as a policy learning process. PruneNet decouples\nthe pruning process from the model architecture, eliminating the need for\ncalibration datasets. It learns a stochastic pruning policy to assess parameter\nimportance solely based on intrinsic model properties while preserving the\nspectral structure to minimize information loss. PruneNet can compress the\nLLaMA-2-7B model in just 15 minutes, achieving over 80% retention of its\nzero-shot performance with a 30% compression ratio, outperforming existing\nmethods that retain only 75% performance. Furthermore, on complex multitask\nlanguage understanding tasks, PruneNet demonstrates its robustness by\npreserving up to 80% performance of the original model, proving itself a\nsuperior alternative to conventional structured compression techniques.",

Clique, which selects consensus nodes to generate blocks with a\npre-determined order, is the most popular implementation of PoA due to its low\ncommunication overhead and energy consumption. However, our study unveils that\nthe speed to process transactions by Clique is severely restricted by 1) the\nlong communication delay of full blocks (each containing a certain number of\ntransactions) between consensus nodes; and 2) occurrences of no-turn blocks,\ngenerated by no-turn nodes if an in-turn block generation fails. Consequently,\nClique struggles to support distributed applications requiring a high\ntransaction processing speed, e.g., online gaming. To overcome this deficiency,\nwe propose an Express Clique (ExClique) algorithm by improving Clique from two\nperspectives: compacting blocks for broadcasting to shorten communication delay\nand prohibiting the occurrences of no-turn blocks. For performance evaluation,\nwe implement ExClique by modifying Geth of Ethereum, the software implementing\nClique, and deploy a permissioned blockchain network by using container\ntechnology. The experimental results show that ExClique achieves a substantial\nenhancement in transactions per second (TPS). Specifically, it boosts TPS by\n2.25X in a typical network with 21 consensus nodes and an impressive 7.01X in a\nlarge-scale network with 101 consensus nodes when compared to Clique.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion models are a powerful framework for tackling ill-posed problems,\nwith recent advancements extending their use to point cloud upsampling. Despite\ntheir potential, existing diffusion models struggle with inefficiencies as they\nmap Gaussian noise to real point clouds, overlooking the geometric information\ninherent in sparse point clouds. To address these inefficiencies, we propose\nPUFM, a flow matching approach to directly map sparse point clouds to their\nhigh-fidelity dense counterparts. Our method first employs midpoint\ninterpolation to sparse point clouds, resolving the density mismatch between\nsparse and dense point clouds. Since point clouds are unordered\nrepresentations, we introduce a pre-alignment method based on Earth Mover's\nDistance (EMD) optimization to ensure coherent interpolation between sparse and\ndense point clouds, which enables a more stable learning path in flow matching.\nExperiments on synthetic datasets demonstrate that our method delivers superior\nupsampling quality but with fewer sampling steps. Further experiments on\nScanNet and KITTI also show that our approach generalizes well on RGB-D point\nclouds and LiDAR point clouds, making it more practical for real-world\napplications.",

By capturing\nthe total event-free time over a specified horizon, RMST provides an intuitive\nand clinically meaningful measure of absolute treatment benefit. Nonetheless,\nselecting the restriction time $L$ poses challenges: choosing a small $L$ can\noverlook late-emerging benefits, whereas a large $L$, often underestimated in\nits impact, may inflate variance and undermine power. We propose a novel\ndata-driven, adaptive procedure that identifies the optimal restriction time\n$L^*$ from a continuous range by maximizing a criterion balancing effect size\nand estimation precision. Consequently, our procedure is particularly useful\nwhen the pattern of the treatment effect is unknown at the design stage. We\nprovide a rigorous theoretical foundation that accounts for variability\nintroduced by adaptively choosing $L^*$. To address nonregular estimation under\nthe null, we develop two complementary strategies: a convex-hull-based\nestimator, and a penalized approach that further enhances power. Additionally,\nwhen restriction time candidates are defined on a discrete grid, we propose a\nprocedure that surprisingly incurs no asymptotic penalty for selection, thus\nachieving oracle performance. Extensive simulations across realistic survival\nscenarios demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional RMST analyses and\nthe log-rank test, achieving superior power while maintaining nominal Type I\nerror rates.

The Flip FET (FFET), a novel\ntransistor architecture combining 3D transistor stacking and fully functional\nwafer backside, was recently proposed. With symmetric dual-sided standard cell\ndesign, the FFET can deliver around 12.5% cell area scaling and faster but more\nenergy-efficient libraries beyond other stacked transistor technologies such as\nCFET. Besides, thanks to the novel cell design with dual-sided pins, the FFET\nsupports dual-sided signal routing, delivering better routability and larger\nbackside design space. In this work, we demonstrated a comprehensive FFET\nevaluation framework considering physical implementation and block-level\npower-performance-area (PPA) assessment for the first time, in which key\nfunctions are dual-sided routing and dual-sided RC extraction. A 32-bit RISC-V\ncore was used for the evaluation here. Compared to the CFET with single-sided\nsignals, the FFET with single-sided signals achieved 23.3% post-P&R core area\nreduction, 25.0% higher frequency and 11.9% lower power at the same\nutilization, and 16.0 % higher frequency at the same core area. Meanwhile, the\nFFET supports dual-sided signals, which can further benefit more from flexible\nallocation of cell input pins on both sides. By optimizing the input pin\ndensity and BEOL routing layer number on each side, 10.6% frequency gain was\nrealized without power degradation compared to the one with single-sided signal\nrouting. Moreover, the routability and power efficiency of FFET barely degrades\neven with the routing layer number reduced from 12 to 5 on each side,\nvalidating the great space for cost-friendly design enabled by FFET.",

Methods: We propose a method using millimeter-wave radar and pulse\noximeter for OSAHS diagnosis (ROSA). It contains a sleep apnea-hypopnea events\n(SAE) detection network, which directly predicts the temporal localization of\nSAE, and a sleep staging network, which predicts the sleep stages throughout\nthe night, based on radar signals. It also fuses oxygen saturation (SpO2)\ninformation from the pulse oximeter to adjust the score of SAE detected by\nradar. Results: Experimental results on a real-world dataset (>800 hours of\novernight recordings, 100 subjects) demonstrated high agreement (ICC=0.9870) on\napnea-hypopnea index (AHI) between ROSA and PSG.

We first use a group-sparsity formulation to optimize the given mesh\nshape into an approximately piecewise ruled form, in conjunction with a tangent\nvector field that indicates the ruling directions. Afterward, we utilize the\noptimization result to extract seams that separate smooth families of rulings,\nand use the seams to construct the initial rulings. Finally, we further\noptimize the positions and orientations of the rulings to improve the alignment\nwith the input target shape. We apply our method to a variety of freeform\nshapes with different topologies and complexity, demonstrating its\neffectiveness in approximating arbitrary shapes.",

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) has gained significant attention for enabling\ndecentralized training on edge networks without exposing raw data. However, FL\nmodels remain susceptible to adversarial attacks and performance degradation in\nnon-IID data settings, thus posing challenges to both robustness and accuracy.\nThis paper aims to achieve communication-efficient adversarial federated\nlearning (AFL) by leveraging a pre-trained model to enhance both robustness and\naccuracy under adversarial attacks and non-IID challenges in AFL. By leveraging\nthe knowledge from a pre-trained model for both clean and adversarial images,\nwe propose a pre-trained model-guided adversarial federated learning (PM-AFL)\nframework. This framework integrates vanilla and adversarial mixture knowledge\ndistillation to effectively balance accuracy and robustness while promoting\nlocal models to learn from diverse data. Specifically, for clean accuracy, we\nadopt a dual distillation strategy where the class probabilities of randomly\npaired images, and their blended versions are aligned between the teacher model\nand the local models. For adversarial robustness, we employ a similar\ndistillation approach but replace clean samples on the local side with\nadversarial examples. Moreover, by considering the bias between local and\nglobal models, we also incorporate a consistency regularization term to ensure\nthat local adversarial predictions stay aligned with their corresponding global\nclean ones. These strategies collectively enable local models to absorb diverse\nknowledge from the teacher model while maintaining close alignment with the\nglobal model, thereby mitigating overfitting to local optima and enhancing the\ngeneralization of the global model. Experiments demonstrate that the\nPM-AFL-based framework not only significantly outperforms other methods but\nalso maintains communication efficiency.",

Additionally, flavor-conserving couplings of\nthe ALP to Standard Model (SM) fermions arise at the one-loop level as well\nfrom ALP-electroweak gauge boson couplings, even in the absence of tree-level\ncouplings to these SM fermions, with consequent ALP decays to the SM fermions\nleading to constraints on the ALP-electroweak gauge boson couplings.

Abstractions are widely used for solving\ngeneralized planning, and QNP (qualitative numeric planning) is a popular\nabstract model. Recently, Cui et al. showed that a plan solves a sound and\ncomplete abstraction of a generalized planning problem if and only if the\nrefined plan solves the original problem. However, existing work on automatic\nabstraction for generalized planning can hardly guarantee soundness let alone\ncompleteness. In this paper, we propose an automatic sound and complete\nabstraction method for generalized planning with baggable types. We use a\nvariant of QNP, called bounded QNP (BQNP), where integer variables are\nincreased or decreased by only one. Since BQNP is undecidable, we propose and\nimplement a sound but incomplete solver for BQNP. We present an automatic\nmethod to abstract a BQNP problem from a classical planning instance with\nbaggable types. The basic idea for abstraction is to introduce a counter for\neach bag of indistinguishable tuples of objects. We define a class of domains\ncalled proper baggable domains, and show that for such domains, the BQNP\nproblem got by our automatic method is a sound and complete abstraction for a\ngeneralized planning problem whose instances share the same bags with the given\ninstance but the sizes of the bags might be different. Thus, the refined plan\nof a solution to the BQNP problem is a solution to the generalized planning\nproblem.

    "abstract": "Multimode lasers have a very complex dynamics, as expected when oscillators\nare nonlinearly coupled. Order emerges when the modes lock together; in this\ncase the coherent superposition of the modes results into a periodic train of\npulses or a nearly constant power output with a linearly chirped frequency, for\ninstance. The first is promoted by a saturable absorber, or an equivalent\nphysical mechanism, while the latter is connected to more subtle conditions,\nsuch as the fast dynamics of the gain. Here we consider the case of a multimode\nsemiconductor laser with gain provided by quantum wells but without any\nsaturable absorber. The cavity is designed to have a photonic bandgap and very\nlow dispersion. We show, first in theory, that modes can lock together and\ngenerate a variety of waveforms which are not trains of pulses nor chirped\ncontinuous power waves. Mode locking is observed in experiments on a\nIII-V/Silicon hybrid laser with the cavity made of a suitably tapered grating.\nMoreover, we find that the mode-locking beatnote is strongly dependent on the\ninjected current: we reach more than 1 GHz modulation amplitude of the beatnote\nat a modulation frequency of 50 kHz. The behaviour of the laser is critically\ndetermined by the dispersion, which can be controlled by the photonic crystal\nstructure. By scaling up the number of interacting modes, this laser source may\noffer an effective and extremely flexible way of generating waveforms \\`a la\ncarte.",

However, once a device model is widely deployed, the\nperformance of each device becomes different after a period of running. This is\ncaused by the differences in user configurations, environmental conditions,\nmanufacturing variances, battery degradation, etc. Existing DNN compression\nmethods have not taken this scenario into consideration and can not guarantee\ngood compression results in all homogeneous edge devices. To address this, we\npropose Homogeneous-Device Aware Pruning (HDAP), a hardware-aware DNN\ncompression framework explicitly designed for homogeneous edge devices, aiming\nto achieve optimal average performance of the compressed model across all\ndevices. To deal with the difficulty of time-consuming hardware-aware\nevaluations for thousands or millions of homogeneous edge devices, HDAP\npartitions all the devices into several device clusters, which can dramatically\nreduce the number of devices to evaluate and use the surrogate-based evaluation\ninstead of hardware evaluation in real-time. Experiments on ResNet50 and\nMobileNetV1 with the ImageNet dataset show that HDAP consistently achieves\nlower average inference latency compared with state-of-the-art methods, with\nsubstantial speedup gains (e.g., 2.86 $\\times$ speedup at 1.0G FLOPs for\nResNet50) on the homogeneous device clusters.

A full transition pathway is realized\nin sequence from a drag-enhanced to a drag-reduced flow regime, before\nasymptotically approaching the single-phase state as $St^+$ increases\ncontinuously up to 300. For the first time, a set of transport equations for\nthe particle phase is derived analytically to interpret the inter-phase\ncoupling, in the context of the point-based statistical description of\nparticle-laden turbulence. By virtue of this, two dominant mechanisms are\nsubstantially identified and quantified: a positive, particle-induced extra\ntransport, which decreases monotonically with $St^+$, and a negative,\nparticle-induced extra dissipation, which depends non-monotonically on $St^+$.\nThe coupling of these two mechanisms leads to a direct contribution of particle\nphase to the shear stress balance, turbulent kinetic energy, and Reynolds\nstress budgets. As a consequence, with the increase of particle inertia, the\nself-sustaining cycle of near-wall turbulence transitions from being augmented\nto being suppressed and, eventually, recovers to the single-phase situation.\nThis gives rise to an indirect effect, manifested by the non-monotonic\nmodification of Reynolds shear stress and turbulent production rate.

Despite the inherent complexity of many-body systems,\na number of the salient features of electron scattering measurements are\ndescribed by a simple, factorized theory called Generalized Contact Formalism.\nA key element of this theory, the factorization of the interaction with a hard\nprobe, has yet to be tested.

    "abstract": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is extensively utilized to incorporate\nexternal, current knowledge into large language models, thereby minimizing\nhallucinations. A standard RAG pipeline may comprise several components, such\nas query rewriting, document retrieval, document filtering, and answer\ngeneration. However, these components are typically optimized separately\nthrough supervised fine-tuning, which can lead to misalignments between the\nobjectives of individual modules and the overarching aim of generating accurate\nanswers in question-answering (QA) tasks. Although recent efforts have explored\nreinforcement learning (RL) to optimize specific RAG components, these\napproaches often focus on overly simplistic pipelines with only two components\nor do not adequately address the complex interdependencies and collaborative\ninteractions among the modules. To overcome these challenges, we propose\ntreating the RAG pipeline as a multi-agent cooperative task, with each\ncomponent regarded as an RL agent. Specifically, we present MMOA-RAG, a\nMulti-Module joint Optimization Algorithm for RAG, which employs multi-agent\nreinforcement learning to harmonize all agents' goals towards a unified reward,\nsuch as the F1 score of the final answer. Experiments conducted on various QA\ndatasets demonstrate that MMOA-RAG improves the overall pipeline performance\nand outperforms existing baselines.

From the perspective of dynamic system,\niteratively solving a constrained optimization problem can be framed as the\ntemporal evolution of a feedback control system. Classical constrained\noptimization methods, such as penalty and Lagrangian approaches, inherently use\nproportional and integral feedback controllers. In this paper, we propose a\nmore generic equivalence framework to build the connection between constrained\noptimization and feedback control system, for the purpose of developing more\neffective constrained RL algorithms. Firstly, we define that each step of the\nsystem evolution determines the Lagrange multiplier by solving a multiplier\nfeedback optimal control problem (MFOCP). In this problem, the control input is\nmultiplier, the state is policy parameters, the dynamics is described by policy\ngradient descent, and the objective is to minimize constraint violations. Then,\nwe introduce a multiplier guided policy learning (MGPL) module to perform\npolicy parameters updating. And we prove that the resulting optimal policy,\nachieved through alternating MFOCP and MGPL, aligns with the solution of the\nprimal constrained RL problem, thereby establishing our equivalence framework.\nFurthermore, we point out that the existing PID Lagrangian is merely one\nspecial case within our framework that utilizes a PID controller. We also\naccommodate the integration of other various feedback controllers, thereby\nfacilitating the development of new algorithms. As a representative, we employ\nmodel predictive control (MPC) as the feedback controller and consequently\npropose a new algorithm called predictive Lagrangian optimization (PLO).\nNumerical experiments demonstrate its superiority over the PID Lagrangian\nmethod, achieving a larger feasible region up to 7.2% and a comparable average\nreward.",

Our findings demonstrate that the bilayer\nfilms uniaxial magnetic anisotropy (UMA) with out-of-plane coercivity (Hcp) is\nhighly influenced by the W buffer, capping layers, and TA. Specifically, the\nHcp of the CoFeB layer with the buffer and capping layers annealed at 400 C\nsamples exceed several times the coercivity of those unannealed. CoFeB buffered\nwith W and annealed at 400 C shows larger Hcp, two-fold UMA, and higher\nin-plane UMA energy density (Keff) than the CoFeB/W bilayers, which can be\nattributed to the W buffer layer inducing the crystallization of CoFeB during\nannealing. The W buffer, capping layers, and the TA for W and CoFeB-based\nbilayer samples significantly alter the surface morphology, grain sizes, and\nsurface roughness. The XRD analysis reveals nano-crystallites embedded in the\nlarger grains of the 400 C annealed samples. Hence, this work offers a\npromising approach to achieving high thermal stability of UMA in W and\nCoFeB-based spintronic applications.",

    "abstract": "Robotic manipulation is often challenging due to the long-horizon tasks and\nthe complex object relationships. A common solution is to develop a task and\nmotion planning framework that integrates planning for high-level task and\nlow-level motion. Recently, inspired by the powerful reasoning ability of Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs), LLM-based planning approaches have achieved remarkable\nprogress. However, these methods still heavily rely on expert-specific\nknowledge, often generating invalid plans for unseen and unfamiliar tasks. To\naddress this issue, we propose an innovative language-guided symbolic task\nplanning (LM-SymOpt) framework with optimization. It is the first expert-free\nplanning framework since we combine the world knowledge from LLMs with formal\nreasoning, resulting in improved generalization capability to new tasks.\nSpecifically, differ to most existing work, our LM-SymOpt employs LLMs to\ntranslate natural language instructions into symbolic representations, thereby\nrepresenting actions as high-level symbols and reducing the search space for\nplanning. Next, after evaluating the action probability of completing the task\nusing LLMs, a weighted random sampling method is introduced to generate\ncandidate plans. Their feasibility is assessed through symbolic reasoning and\ntheir cost efficiency is then evaluated using trajectory optimization for\nselecting the optimal planning. Our experimental results show that LM-SymOpt\noutperforms existing LLM-based planning approaches.",

Thus, zero-shot anomaly synthesis (ZSAS), which\nsynthesizes pseudo anomaly images without any domain-specific anomaly, emerges\nas a vital technique for IAD. However, existing solutions are either unable to\nsynthesize authentic pseudo anomalies, or require cumbersome training. Thus, we\nfocus on ZSAS and propose a brand-new paradigm that can realize both authentic\nand training-free ZSAS. It is based on a chronically-ignored fact: Although\ndomain-specific anomalies are rare, real anomalies from other domains (i.e.\ncross-domain anomalies) are actually abundant and directly applicable to ZSAS.\nSpecifically, our new ZSAS paradigm makes three-fold contributions: First, we\npropose a novel method named Cross-domain Anomaly Injection (CAI), which\ndirectly exploits cross-domain anomalies to enable highly authentic ZSAS in a\ntraining-free manner. Second, to supply CAI with sufficient cross-domain\nanomalies, we build the first Domain-agnostic Anomaly Dataset within our best\nknowledge, which provides ZSAS with abundant real anomaly patterns. Third, we\npropose a CAI-guided Diffusion Mechanism, which further breaks the quantity\nlimit of real anomalies and enable unlimited anomaly synthesis.

The main focus is on\na version where users reserve a parking space when they take a car. In a first\nmodel, the reservation of parking spaces is effective for all users (see [4])\nand capacity constraints are ignored. The model is carried out in\nthermodynamical limit, that is when the number $N$ of stations and the number\nof cars $M_N$ tend to infinity, with $U = \\lim_{N\\to\\infty} M_N/N$. This limit\nis described by Kolmogorov equations of a two-dimensional time-inhomogeneous\nMarkov process depicting the numbers of reservations and cars at a station. It\nsatisfies a non-linear differential system. We prove analytically that this\nsystem has a unique solution, which converges, as $t\\to\\infty$, to an\nequilibrium point exponentially fast. Moreover, this equilibrium point\ncorresponds to the stationary distribution of a two queue tandem (reservations,\ncars), which is here always ergodic.

We also provide a dedicated transpiler and scheduler for this\narchitecture, wherein the scheduler coordinates the sequence of operations and\ninserts the necessary swap and shuttling operations. Finally, we developed an\nerror analyzer to evaluate the chip's performance across a variety of quantum\nalgorithms. Simulation results confirm that our architecture can significantly\nincrease success rates and reduce gate error probabilities, particularly\nlowering the effective two-qubit gate error probability to about 10^{-8} when a\nquantum error-correcting code of 31 physical qubits is employed. Our findings\nclearly show that the improvement in success rates clearly outweighs the\nruntime overhead, demonstrating that strategic hardware-scheduler co-design can\nadvance quantum systems towards reliable, large-scale computing, potentially\nsurpassing classical capabilities.",

Notably, our model identifies\nwhich values to reinforce at each turn and how to do so, by leveraging online\nsupport conversations from Reddit. We evaluate the method across support\nskills, seekers' emotional intensity, and value reinforcement. Our method\nconsistently outperforms various baselines, effectively exploring and eliciting\nvalues from seekers. Additionally, leveraging crowd knowledge from Reddit\nsignificantly enhances its effectiveness. Therapists highlighted its ability to\nvalidate seekers' challenges and emphasize positive aspects of their\nsituations$\\unicode{x2013}$both crucial elements of value reinforcement. Our\nwork, being the first to integrate value reinforcement into emotional support\nsystems, demonstrates its promise and establishes a foundation for future\nresearch.",

Furthermore, we incorporate a prior-guided fusion (PGF) module and\na score-aware sampling strategy to efficiently fuse pose and RGB information,\naddressing keypoint inaccuracies and improving computational efficiency.\nExtensive experiments across multiple SLU benchmarks demonstrate that Uni-Sign\nachieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple downstream SLU tasks.\nDataset and code are available at github.com/ZechengLi19/Uni-Sign.",

Adaptive transmission power control (ATPC)\nenables nodes to adapt to extreme conditions and maintain stable wireless links\nand often rely on knowledge of the received power as a closed-feedback system\nto adjust the power of outgoing packets.

    "abstract": "Stable and efficient food markets are crucial for global food security, yet\ninternational staple food markets are increasingly exposed to complex risks,\nincluding intensified risk contagion and escalating external uncertainties.\nThis paper systematically investigates risk spillovers in global staple food\nmarkets and explores the key determinants of these spillover effects, combining\ninnovative decomposition-reconstruction techniques, risk connectedness\nanalysis, and random forest models. The findings reveal that short-term\ncomponents exhibit the highest volatility, with futures components generally\nmore volatile than spot components. Further analysis identifies two main risk\ntransmission patterns, namely cross-grain and cross-timescale transmission, and\nclarifies the distinct roles of each component in various net risk spillover\nnetworks. Additionally, price drivers, external uncertainties, and core\nsupply-demand indicators significantly influence these spillover effects, with\nheterogeneous importance of varying factors in explaining different risk\nspillovers. This study provides valuable insights into the risk dynamics of\nstaple food markets, offers evidence-based guidance for policymakers and market\nparticipants to enhance risk warning and mitigation efforts, and supports the\nstabilization of international food markets and the safeguarding of global food\nsecurity.",

In this study, we propose a physical mechanism to explain the\nobserved gamma-ray variability within the framework of a supermassive black\nhole binary (SMBHB) system, supported by a newly identified component hidden in\nthe light curve. A detailed analysis for its about 16-year light curve obtained\nfrom Fermi-LAT observations is performed by Gaussian process (GP). As\nanticipated, the QPO of 2.1 years is effectively captured by the\nstochastically-driven damped simple harmonic oscillator (SHO) kernel within the\nunder-damped regime, and the overall stochastic nature of the variability is\ndescribed by the damped random walk (DRW) kernel albeit with an unconstrained\ndamping timescale. Additionally, our results reveal a previously unrecognized\ncomponent in active galactic nuclei variability, characterized by the\nMat\\'ern-3/2 kernel, which is typically associated with systems undergoing\nabrupt energy release. These findings can be consistently interpreted within\nthe SMBHB framework. The QPO of about 2.1 years is likely attributed to the\norbital motion in a SMBHB system. The Mat\\'ern-3/2 component is interpreted as\nresulting from magnetic reconnection events triggered by gravitational\nperturbations of the magnetic field within the jet, occurring as one black hole\napproaches the other. Meanwhile, in this case, the damping timescale of the\ncommon DRW kernel remains unconstrained due to the influence of new\nperturbations within the system.",

We utilize the combined capabilities of UAVs\nand ground edge servers (ESs) to maximize user satisfaction and thereby also\nmaximize the service provider's (SP) profit. We design IoT task-offloading as\njoint IoT-UAV-ES association and UAV-network topology optimization problem.

We develop a Three-sided Matching\nwith Size and Cyclic preference (TMSC) based task offloading algorithm to find\nstable association between IoTs, UAVs, and ESs to achieve system objective. We\nalso propose a K-means based iterative algorithm to decide the minimum number\nof UAVs and their positions to provide offloading services to maximum IoTs in\nthe system.

It is known that there are three possible\nsymmetric teleparallel connection branches that respect the cosmological\nprinciples of spatial homogeneity, isotropy, and global spatial flatness.

Furthermore, we establish that the\nstability of the $\\Lambda$CDM-like cosmic solution within this reconstructed\n$f(Q)$, as well as the robustness of the reconstructed $f(Q)$ form with respect\nto small errors in the astrophysical measurements of the jerk parameter.

We find that existing\nforest density estimation at a certain point is inherently resistant to the\noutliers outside the cells containing the point, which we call\n\\textit{non-local outliers}, but not resistant to the rest \\textit{local\noutliers}. To achieve robustness against all outliers, we propose an ensemble\nlearning algorithm called \\textit{medians of forests for robust density\nestimation} (\\textit{MFRDE}), which adopts a pointwise median operation on\nforest density estimators fitted on subsampled datasets. Compared to existing\nrobust kernel-based methods, MFRDE enables us to choose larger subsampling\nsizes, sacrificing less accuracy for density estimation while achieving\nrobustness. On the theoretical side, we introduce the local outlier exponent to\nquantify the number of local outliers. Under this exponent, we show that even\nif the number of outliers reaches a certain polynomial order in the sample\nsize, MFRDE is able to achieve almost the same convergence rate as the same\nalgorithm on uncontaminated data, whereas robust kernel-based methods fail. On\nthe practical side, real data experiments show that MFRDE outperforms existing\nrobust kernel-based methods. Moreover, we apply MFRDE to anomaly detection to\nshowcase a further application.",

However, existing SNN-based\nobject detection methods suffer from local firing saturation, where neurons in\ninformation-concentrated regions fire continuously throughout all time steps.\nThis abnormal neuron firing pattern reduces the feature discrimination\ncapability and detection accuracy, while also increasing the firing rates that\nprevent SNNs from achieving their potential energy efficiency. To address this\nproblem, we propose SpikeDet, a novel spiking object detector that optimizes\nfiring patterns for accurate and energy-efficient detection. Specifically, we\ndesign a spiking backbone network, MDSNet, which effectively adjusts the\nmembrane synaptic input distribution at each layer, achieving better neuron\nfiring patterns during spiking feature extraction. Additionally, to better\nutilize and preserve these high-quality backbone features, we introduce the\nSpiking Multi-direction Fusion Module (SMFM), which realizes multi-direction\nfusion of spiking features, enhancing the multi-scale detection capability of\nthe model. Experimental results demonstrate that SpikeDet achieves superior\nperformance. On the COCO 2017 dataset, it achieves 51.4% AP, outperforming\nprevious SNN-based methods by 2.5% AP while requiring only half the power\nconsumption. On object detection sub-tasks, including the GEN1 event-based\ndataset and the URPC 2019 underwater dataset, SpikeDet also achieves the best\nperformance.

However, assessing the\nequally important creative capabilities of LLMs is challenging due to the\nsubjective, diverse, and data-scarce nature of creativity, especially in\nmultimodal scenarios. In this paper, we consider the comprehensive pipeline for\nevaluating the creativity of multimodal LLMs, with a focus on suitable\nevaluation platforms and methodologies. First, we find the Oogiri game, a\ncreativity-driven task requiring humor, associative thinking, and the ability\nto produce unexpected responses to text, images, or both. This game aligns well\nwith the input-output structure of modern multimodal LLMs and benefits from a\nrich repository of high-quality, human-annotated creative responses, making it\nan ideal platform for studying LLM creativity. Next, beyond using the Oogiri\ngame for standard evaluations like ranking and selection, we propose LoTbench,\nan interactive, causality-aware evaluation framework, to further address some\nintrinsic risks in standard evaluations, such as information leakage and\nlimited interpretability. The proposed LoTbench not only quantifies LLM\ncreativity more effectively but also visualizes the underlying creative thought\nprocesses. Our results show that while most LLMs exhibit constrained\ncreativity, the performance gap between LLMs and humans is not insurmountable.\nFurthermore, we observe a strong correlation between results from the\nmultimodal cognition benchmark MMMU and LoTbench, but only a weak connection\nwith traditional creativity metrics. This suggests that LoTbench better aligns\nwith human cognitive theories, highlighting cognition as a critical foundation\nin the early stages of creativity and enabling the bridging of diverse\nconcepts. https://lotbench.github.io",

Within the framework of\nintegration communication and artificial intelligence as a pivotal development\nvision for 6G, it is imperative to achieve intelligent prediction of channel\ncharacteristics.

    "abstract": "Community detection is a critical task in graph theory, social network\nanalysis, and bioinformatics, where communities are defined as clusters of\ndensely interconnected nodes. However, detecting communities in large-scale\nnetworks with millions of nodes and billions of edges remains challenging due\nto the inefficiency and unreliability of existing methods. Moreover, many\ncurrent approaches are limited to specific graph types, such as unweighted or\nundirected graphs, reducing their broader applicability. To address these\nissues, we propose a novel heuristic community detection algorithm, termed\nCoDeSEG, which identifies communities by minimizing the two-dimensional (2D)\nstructural entropy of the network within a potential game framework. In the\ngame, nodes decide to stay in current community or move to another based on a\nstrategy that maximizes the 2D structural entropy utility function.\nAdditionally, we introduce a structural entropy-based node overlapping\nheuristic for detecting overlapping communities, with a near-linear time\ncomplexity.Experimental results on real-world networks demonstrate that CoDeSEG\nis the fastest method available and achieves state-of-the-art performance in\noverlapping normalized mutual information (ONMI) and F1 score.",

They are managed entirely\nby the compiler through a process called register allocation, during which the\ncompiler attempts to cache predictable data from thread-local memory into\nthread-private registers. Computing the permanent of a sparse matrix poses a\nchallenge for compilers, as optimizing this process is hindered by the\nunpredictable distribution of nonzero elements, which only become known at\nruntime. In this work, we employ fully-automated code generation to address\nthis, producing highly optimized kernels tailored to the matrix's sparsity\npattern. State-of-the-art permanent computation algorithms require each thread\nto store a private array, denoted x, of size n. We first propose a technique\nthat fully stores these arrays in registers, with inclusion and exclusion\nkernels generated for each column. To minimize control divergence and reduce\nthe number of unique kernels within a warp, we exploit the internal structure\nof Gray codes, which are also used in the state-of-the-art algorithm. Our\nsecond technique reduces register pressure by utilizing both registers and\nglobal memory and introduces a matrix ordering and partitioning strategy for\ngreater efficiency.

A common\napproach merges domain-specific sequences into cross-domain sequences, serving\nas bridges to connect domains. One key challenge is to correctly extract the\nshared knowledge among these sequences and appropriately transfer it. Most\nexisting works directly transfer unfiltered cross-domain knowledge rather than\nextracting domain-invariant components and adaptively integrating them into\ndomain-specific modelings. Another challenge lies in aligning the\ndomain-specific and cross-domain sequences. Existing methods align these\nsequences based on timestamps, but this approach can cause prediction\nmismatches when the current tokens and their targets belong to different\ndomains. In such cases, the domain-specific knowledge carried by the current\ntokens may degrade performance. To address these challenges, we propose the\nA-B-Cross-to-Invariant Learning Recommender (ABXI). Specifically, leveraging\nLoRA's effectiveness for efficient adaptation, ABXI incorporates two types of\nLoRAs to facilitate knowledge adaptation. First, all sequences are processed\nthrough a shared encoder that employs a domain LoRA for each sequence, thereby\npreserving unique domain characteristics. Next, we introduce an invariant\nprojector that extracts domain-invariant interests from cross-domain\nrepresentations, utilizing an invariant LoRA to adapt these interests into\nmodeling each specific domain. Besides, to avoid prediction mismatches, all\ndomain-specific sequences are aligned to match the domains of the cross-domain\nground truths.

By utilizing SKA's high spectral resolution settings (0.001, 0.002, 0.005,\n0.01 Hz) to detect redshift drift, particularly focusing on the 0.001 and 0.002\nHz configuration, one aims to achieve the necessary mm/s in precision\nmeasurement by the 0.5-year observation period. The velocity drift rate,\ncrucially determined by the two operational regimes within 0.01 to 0.21 mm/s\nand 0.031 to 0.17 mm/s, respectively, exceeds the theoretical accuracy limit of\n1.28 mm/s. The analysis thoroughly restricts cosmological parameters related to\ndark energy using the Sandage-Loeb (SL) signal from the HI 21cm emission and\nabsorption lines. It estimates $\\rm H_0$ of about 70 km/s/Mpc, $\\rm \\Omega_m$\nnear 0.3, with w close to -1, $\\rm w_0$ around -1, and $\\rm w_a$ approaching\n-0.1. These results strongly endorse the SL effect as an effective method for\nconfirming cosmic acceleration and exploring the dark sector in real-time\ncosmology with the SKA.",

    "abstract": "Massive Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) is critical for boosting 6G\nwireless network capacity. Nevertheless, high dimensional Channel State\nInformation (CSI) acquisition becomes the bottleneck of 6G massive MIMO system.\nRecently, Channel Digital Twin (CDT), which replicates physical entities in\nwireless channels, has been proposed, providing site-specific prior knowledge\nfor CSI acquisition. However, external devices (e.g., cameras and GPS devices)\ncannot always be integrated into existing communication systems, nor are they\nuniversally available across all scenarios. Moreover, the trained CDT model\ncannot be directly applied in new environments, which lacks environmental\ngeneralizability. To this end, Path Evolution Model (PEM) is proposed as an\nalternative CDT to reflect physical path evolutions from consecutive channel\nmeasurements. Compared to existing CDTs, PEM demonstrates virtues of full\nendogeneity, self-sustainability and environmental generalizability. Firstly,\nPEM only requires existing channel measurements, which is free of other\nhardware devices and can be readily deployed. Secondly, self-sustaining\nmaintenance of PEM can be achieved in dynamic channel by progressive updates.\nThirdly, environmental generalizability can greatly reduce deployment costs in\ndynamic environments. To facilitate the implementation of PEM, an intelligent\nand light-weighted operation framework is firstly designed. Then, the\nenvironmental generalizability of PEM is rigorously analyzed. Next, efficient\nlearning approaches are proposed to reduce the amount of training data\npractically. Extensive simulation results reveal that PEM can simultaneously\nachieve high-precision and low-overhead CSI acquisition, which can serve as a\nfundamental CDT for 6G wireless networks.",

We analyse discrepancies from a technical point of view, and adjust\ncode and parametrisation to minimise replication differences.

    "abstract": "KV cache is a widely used acceleration technique for large language models\n(LLMs) inference. However, its memory requirement grows rapidly with input\nlength. Previous studies have reduced the size of KV cache by either removing\nthe same number of unimportant tokens for all attention heads or by allocating\ndifferentiated KV cache budgets for pre-identified attention heads. However,\ndue to the importance of attention heads varies across different tasks, the\npre-identified attention heads fail to adapt effectively to various downstream\ntasks. To address this issue, we propose Task-KV, a method that leverages the\nsemantic differentiation of attention heads to allocate differentiated KV cache\nbudgets across various tasks. We demonstrate that attention heads far from the\nsemantic center (called heterogeneous heads) make an significant contribution\nto task outputs and semantic understanding. In contrast, other attention heads\nplay the role of aggregating important information and focusing reasoning.\nTask-KV allocates full KV cache budget to heterogeneous heads to preserve\ncomprehensive semantic information, while reserving a small number of recent\ntokens and attention sinks for non-heterogeneous heads. Furthermore, we\ninnovatively introduce middle activations to preserve key contextual\ninformation aggregated from non-heterogeneous heads. To dynamically perceive\nsemantic differences among attention heads, we design a semantic separator to\ndistinguish heterogeneous heads from non-heterogeneous ones based on their\ndistances from the semantic center. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks\nand different model architectures demonstrate that Task-KV significantly\noutperforms existing baseline methods.",

Meanwhile,\nvanilla LoRA struggles with task conflicts in multi-task scenarios. Recent\nworks adopt Mixture of Experts (MoE) by treating each LoRA module as an expert,\nthereby mitigating task interference through multiple specialized LoRA modules.\nWhile effective, these methods often isolate knowledge within individual tasks,\nfailing to fully exploit the shared knowledge across related tasks. In this\npaper, we establish a connection between single LoRA and multi-LoRA MoE,\nintegrating them into a unified framework. We demonstrate that the dynamic\nrouting of multiple LoRAs is functionally equivalent to rank partitioning and\nblock-level activation within a single LoRA. We further empirically demonstrate\nthat finer-grained LoRA partitioning, within the same total and activated\nparameter constraints, leads to better performance gains across heterogeneous\ntasks. Building on these findings, we propose Single-ranked Mixture of Experts\nLoRA (\\textbf{SMoRA}), which embeds MoE into LoRA by \\textit{treating each rank\nas an independent expert}. With a \\textit{dynamic rank-wise activation}\nmechanism, SMoRA promotes finer-grained knowledge sharing while mitigating task\nconflicts. Experiments demonstrate that SMoRA activates fewer parameters yet\nachieves better performance in multi-task scenarios.",

A significant challenge lies in the\nabsence of a natural physical backdoor dataset, and constructing such a dataset\nis both time- and labor-intensive. In this work, we address this gap by\ncreating a large-scale dataset comprising approximately 11,800 images/frames\nwith annotations featuring natural objects (e.g., T-shirts and hats) as\ntriggers to incur cloaking adversarial effects in diverse real-world scenarios.\nThis dataset is tailored for the study of physical backdoors in object\ndetectors. Leveraging this dataset, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of an\ninsidious cloaking backdoor effect against object detectors, wherein the\nbounding box around a person vanishes when the individual is near a natural\nobject (e.g., a commonly available T-shirt) in front of the detector. Our\nevaluations encompass three prevalent attack surfaces: data outsourcing, model\noutsourcing, and the use of pretrained models. The cloaking effect is\nsuccessfully implanted in object detectors across all three attack surfaces. We\nextensively evaluate four popular object detection algorithms (anchor-based\nYolo-V3, Yolo-V4, Faster R-CNN, and anchor-free CenterNet) using 19 videos\n(totaling approximately 11,800 frames) in real-world scenarios. Our results\ndemonstrate that the backdoor attack exhibits remarkable robustness against\nvarious factors, including movement, distance, angle, non-rigid deformation,\nand lighting. In data and model outsourcing scenarios, the attack success rate\n(ASR) in most videos reaches 100% or near it, while the clean data accuracy of\nthe backdoored model remains indistinguishable from that of the clean model,\nmaking it impossible to detect backdoor behavior through a validation set.",

To address this gap and enable a more comprehensive\nevaluation of the long-context reasoning capabilities of current LLMs, we\npropose a new synthetic benchmark, LongReason, which is constructed by\nsynthesizing long-context reasoning questions from a varied set of\nshort-context reasoning questions through context expansion. LongReason\nconsists of 794 multiple-choice reasoning questions with diverse reasoning\npatterns across three task categories: reading comprehension, logical\ninference, and mathematical word problems. We evaluate 21 LLMs on LongReason,\nrevealing that most models experience significant performance drops as context\nlength increases. Our further analysis shows that even state-of-the-art LLMs\nstill have significant room for improvement in providing robust reasoning\nacross different tasks. We have open-sourced LongReason under\nhttps://huggingface.co/datasets/lz1bytedance/LongReason to support the\ncomprehensive evaluation of LLMs' long-context reasoning capabilities.",

To enable\nLLMs to model long histories, we pursue a concise embedding representation for\nitems and sessions. In the LLM embedding space, we construct an item's\nembedding by aggregating its textual token embeddings; similarly, we construct\na session's embedding by aggregating its item embeddings. While efficient, this\nway poses two challenges since it ignores the temporal significance of user\ninteractions and LLMs do not natively interpret our custom embeddings. To\novercome these, we propose PatchRec, a multi-grained patch training method\nconsisting of two stages: (1) Patch Pre-training, which familiarizes LLMs with\naggregated embeddings -- patches, and (2) Patch Fine-tuning, which enables LLMs\nto capture time-aware significance in interaction history. Extensive\nexperiments show that PatchRec effectively models longer behavior histories\nwith improved efficiency.

However,\noptimizing such real-world industrial systems faces numerous challenges,\nincluding but not limited to a lack of reliable simulation environments,\nlimited historical data, and stringent safety and control robustness\nrequirements. In this work, we present a novel physics-informed offline\nreinforcement learning (RL) framework for energy efficiency optimization of DC\ncooling systems. The proposed framework models the complex dynamical patterns\nand physical dependencies inside a server room using a purposely designed graph\nneural network architecture that is compliant with the fundamental\ntime-reversal symmetry. Because of its well-behaved and generalizable\nstate-action representations, the model enables sample-efficient and robust\nlatent space offline policy learning using limited real-world operational data.\nOur framework has been successfully deployed and verified in a large-scale\nproduction DC for closed-loop control of its air-cooling units (ACUs).

The results show that our method achieves 14~21%\nenergy savings in the DC cooling system, without any violation of the safety or\noperational constraints.

In this paper, we explore integrating the knowledge from the ML\ndomain to provide empirical evaluations of cryptosystems. Particularly, we\nutilize information theoretic metrics to perform ML-based distribution\nestimation. We propose two novel applications of ML algorithms that can be\napplied in a known plaintext setting to perform cryptanalysis on any\ncryptosystem. We use mutual information neural estimation to calculate a\ncryptosystem's mutual information leakage, and a binary cross entropy\nclassification to model an indistinguishability under chosen plaintext attack\n(CPA). These algorithms can be readily applied in an audit setting to evaluate\nthe robustness of a cryptosystem and the results can provide a useful empirical\nbound. We evaluate the efficacy of our methodologies by empirically analyzing\nseveral encryption schemes. Furthermore, we extend the analysis to novel\nnetwork coding-based cryptosystems and provide other use cases for our\nalgorithms. We show that our classification model correctly identifies the\nencryption schemes that are not IND-CPA secure, such as DES, RSA, and AES ECB,\nwith high accuracy. It also identifies the faults in CPA-secure cryptosystems\nwith faulty parameters, such a reduced counter version of AES-CTR. We also\nconclude that with our algorithms, in most cases a smaller-sized neural network\nusing less computing power can identify vulnerabilities in cryptosystems,\nproviding a quick check of the sanity of the cryptosystem and help to decide\nwhether to spend more resources to deploy larger networks that are able to\nbreak the cryptosystem.",

Therefore, it requires expensive\ninference-time computations that occur at every request for model explanations.\nIn contrast, our framework unifies the explanation and prediction in training\nthrough a novel Shapley-based pre-training design, which eliminates the\nundesirable test-time computation and replaces it with a single-time\npre-training. Moreover, this specialized pre-training benefits the prediction\nperformance by making the transformer model more effectively weigh different\nfeatures and time-steps in the time-series, particularly improving the\nrobustness against data noise that is common to raw time-series data.

As a key\ntechnique in this field, Task Arithmetic (TA) defines task vectors by\nsubtracting the pre-trained model ($\\theta_{\\text{pre}}$) from the fine-tuned\ntask models in parameter space, then adjusting the weight between these task\nvectors and $\\theta_{\\text{pre}}$ to balance task-generalized and task-specific\nknowledge. Despite the promising performance of TA, conflicts can arise among\nthe task vectors, particularly when different tasks require distinct model\nadaptations. In this paper, we formally define this issue as knowledge\nconflicts, characterized by the performance degradation of one task after\nmerging with a model fine-tuned for another task. Through in-depth analysis, we\nshow that these conflicts stem primarily from the components of task vectors\nthat align with the gradient of task-specific losses at $\\theta_{\\text{pre}}$.\nTo address this, we propose Task Arithmetic in Trust Region (TATR), which\ndefines the trust region as dimensions in the model parameter space that cause\nonly small changes (corresponding to the task vector components with gradient\northogonal direction) in the task-specific losses. Restricting parameter\nmerging within this trust region, TATR can effectively alleviate knowledge\nconflicts.

    "abstract": "EEG-based fatigue monitoring can effectively reduce the incidence of related\ntraffic accidents. In the past decade, with the advancement of deep learning,\nconvolutional neural networks (CNN) have been increasingly used for EEG signal\nprocessing. However, due to the data's non-Euclidean characteristics, existing\nCNNs may lose important spatial information from EEG, specifically channel\ncorrelation. Thus, we propose the node-holistic graph convolutional network\n(NHGNet), a model that uses graphic convolution to dynamically learn each\nchannel's features. With exact fit attention optimization, the network captures\ninter-channel correlations through a trainable adjacency matrix. The\ninterpretability is enhanced by revealing critical areas of brain activity and\ntheir interrelations in various mental states. In validations on two public\ndatasets, NHGNet outperforms the SOTAs. Specifically, in the intra-subject,\nNHGNet improved detection accuracy by at least 2.34% and 3.42%, and in the\ninter-subjects, it improved by at least 2.09% and 15.06%.

To address\nthe missing interactions driven by negative values in query-key pairs, we\npropose a polarity-aware linear attention mechanism that explicitly models both\nsame-signed and opposite-signed query-key interactions, ensuring comprehensive\ncoverage of relational information.

On a\nmulti-document question answering task with varying input context lengths, we\nfound that the depth of prediction refinement (defined as the number of\nintermediate layers an LLM uses to transition from an initial correct token\nprediction to its final, stable correct output), as a function of the position\nof relevant information, exhibits an approximately inverted U-shaped curve.

Simulated user accounts with assigned\nemotional preferences navigate the platform, selecting videos that align with\ntheir assigned preferences and recording subsequent recommendations. Our\nfindings reveal reveal that YouTube amplifies negative emotions, such as anger\nand grievance, by increasing their prevalence and prominence in\nrecommendations. This reinforcement intensifies over time and persists across\ncontexts. Surprisingly, contextual recommendations often exceed personalized\nones in reinforcing emotional alignment.

    "abstract": "This study addresses a critical gap in adolescent health education strategies\nin the Philippines, as highlighted by the Young Adult Fertility and Sexuality\n(YAFS) survey series, which overlooks the use of games as a medium for\ndisseminating health information. To bridge this gap, the research introduces\nAHlam Na, a game-based mobile application designed to enhance adolescents'\nawareness and understanding of key health-related topics. Using a single-group\npretest-posttest design, the study involved forty junior high school students\nfrom a randomly selected school in the Philippines. They interacted with the\napplication that embedded adolescent health topics into its gameplay. Data\ncollected through pretest and post-test surveys revealed a significant\nimprovement in the student's knowledge and attitudes toward adolescent health\nafter engaging in the game, indicating that game-based learning effectively\nenhances their learning experience. The positive reception and knowledge gains\nsuggest that AHlam Na is a promising tool for promoting adolescent health\nawareness. Based on these findings, it is recommended that the application be\nintegrated into the adolescent health curriculum in schools across the\nPhilippines. Future studies should examine the long-term impact of game-based\nlearning on health behaviors and expand the sample size to include more diverse\ndemographic groups. This research contributes to the growing body of literature\non game-based learning in health education by demonstrating the potential of\ndigital games to address the limitations of traditional teaching methods. The\nsuccessful implementation of AHlam Na underscores the importance of exploring\ngamified learning tools to deliver critical health information to young people\neffectively.",

    "abstract": "Despite their impressive performance on multi-modal tasks, large\nvision-language models (LVLMs) tend to suffer from hallucinations. An important\ntype is object hallucination, where LVLMs generate objects that are\ninconsistent with the images shown to the model. Existing works typically\nattempt to quantify object hallucinations by detecting and measuring the\nfraction of hallucinated objects in generated captions. Additionally, more\nrecent work also measures object hallucinations by directly querying the LVLM\nwith binary questions about the presence of likely hallucinated objects based\non object statistics like top-k frequent objects and top-k co-occurring\nobjects. In this paper, we present Context-Aware Object Similarities (CAOS), a\nnovel approach for evaluating object hallucination in LVLMs using object\nstatistics as well as the generated captions. CAOS uniquely integrates object\nstatistics with semantic relationships between objects in captions and\nground-truth data. Moreover, existing approaches usually only detect and\nmeasure hallucinations belonging to a predetermined set of in-domain objects\n(typically the set of all ground-truth objects for the training dataset) and\nignore generated objects that are not part of this set, leading to\nunder-evaluation. To address this, we further employ language model--based\nobject recognition to detect potentially out-of-domain hallucinated objects and\nuse an ensemble of LVLMs for verifying the presence of such objects in the\nquery image. CAOS also examines the sequential dynamics of object generation,\nshedding light on how the order of object appearance influences hallucinations,\nand employs word embedding models to analyze the semantic reasons behind\nhallucinations. CAOS aims to offer a nuanced understanding of the hallucination\ntendencies of LVLMs by providing a systematic framework to identify and\ninterpret object hallucinations.",

    "abstract": "Robustly predicting attention regions of interest for self-driving systems is\ncrucial for driving safety but presents significant challenges due to the\nlabor-intensive nature of obtaining large-scale attention labels and the domain\ngap between self-driving scenarios and natural scenes. These challenges are\nfurther exacerbated by complex traffic environments, including camera\ncorruption under adverse weather, noise interferences, and central bias from\nlong-tail distributions. To address these issues, we propose a robust\nunsupervised attention prediction method. An Uncertainty Mining Branch refines\npredictions by analyzing commonalities and differences across multiple\npre-trained models on natural scenes, while a Knowledge Embedding Block bridges\nthe domain gap by incorporating driving knowledge to adaptively enhance\npseudo-labels.

While\ndeep learning-based methods have shown promising results, they still face key\nchallenges: 1) uncontrolled removal of all shadows, or 2) controllable removal\nbut heavily relies on precise shadow region masks. To address these issues, we\nintroduce a novel paradigm: prompt-aware controllable shadow removal. Unlike\nexisting approaches, our paradigm allows for targeted shadow removal from\nspecific subjects based on user prompts (e.g., dots, lines, or subject masks).\nThis approach eliminates the need for shadow annotations and offers flexible,\nuser-controlled shadow removal. Specifically, we propose an end-to-end\nlearnable model, the Prompt-Aware Controllable Shadow Removal Network\n(PACSRNet). PACSRNet consists of two key modules: a prompt-aware module that\ngenerates shadow masks for the specified subject based on the user prompt, and\na shadow removal module that uses the shadow prior from the first module to\nrestore the content in the shadowed regions. Additionally, we enhance the\nshadow removal module by incorporating feature information from the\nprompt-aware module through a linear operation, providing prompt-guided support\nfor shadow removal. Recognizing that existing shadow removal datasets lack\ndiverse user prompts, we contribute a new dataset specifically designed for\nprompt-based controllable shadow removal.

Then five optimization methods are developed to compute\nstationary states of the discretized energy function, including the accelerated\nadaptive Bregman proximal gradient, Nesterov, adaptive Nesterov, adaptive\nnonlinear conjugate gradient and adaptive gradient descent methods. To speed up\nthe convergence, we propose a principal mode analysis (PMA) method to estimate\ngood initial configurations and sphere radius.

Although these proposed semi-supervised GAD methods have\nachieved great success, their superior performance will be seriously degraded\nwhen the provided labels are extremely limited due to some unpredictable\nfactors. Besides, the existing methods primarily focus on anomaly detection in\nstatic graphs, and little effort was paid to consider the continuous evolution\ncharacteristic of graphs over time (dynamic graphs). To address these\nchallenges, we propose a novel GAD framework (EL$^{2}$-DGAD) to tackle anomaly\ndetection problem in dynamic graphs with extremely limited labels.\nSpecifically, a transformer-based graph encoder model is designed to more\neffectively preserve evolving graph structures beyond the local neighborhood.\nThen, we incorporate an ego-context hypersphere classification loss to classify\ntemporal interactions according to their structure and temporal neighborhoods\nwhile ensuring the normal samples are mapped compactly against anomalous data.\nFinally, the above loss is further augmented with an ego-context contrasting\nmodule which utilizes unlabeled data to enhance model generalization.

In particular, we\nconsider the case of two intervals in the holographic dual to a BCFT, with one\ninterval $A$ located at the asymptotic boundary and the second interval $B$\nlocated on the ETW brane. We discuss in detail subtleties that arise near the\nRT end-points when defining the EW for this configuration, particularly in the\nconnected phase. Entanglement wedge nesting (EWN) requires that\n$\\mathcal{W}_E(A) \\cup \\mathcal{W}_E(B) \\subseteq \\mathcal{W}_E(A\\cup B)$. We\ndemonstrate that already in the simplest example of an AdS$_3$ bulk geometry,\nEWN can be violated even if $A$ and $B$ are spacelike separated through the\nbulk and instead we must require the stronger condition that $\\mathcal{W}_E(A)$\nbe spacelike separated from $\\mathcal{W}_E(B)$, which highlights the non-local\nnature of the cutoff theory. Our prescription to associate EWs to subregions on\nthe ETW brane is different from the restricted maximin procedure in\narXiv:2008.07022 but will agree within the subset of parameter space where EWN\nis respected. Additionally, we study EWN in a two sided BTZ black hole geometry\nwith an ETW brane in one of the exteriors.

A-IoT devices are batteryless and consume ultra-low\npower, relying on energy harvesting and energy storage to capture a small\namount of energy for communication. A promising usecase of A-IoT is inventory,\nwhere a reader communicates with hundreds of A-IoT devices to identify them.\nHowever, energy harvesting required before communication can significantly\ndelay or even fail inventory completion. In this work, solutions including duty\ncycled monitoring (DCM), device grouping and low-power receiving chain are\nproposed. Evaluation results show that the time required for a reader to\ncomplete an inventory procedure for hundreds of A-IoT devices can be reduced by\n50% to 83% with the proposed methods.",

Leading AI labs\nand scientists have called for the global prioritization of AI safety citing\nexistential risks comparable to nuclear war. However, research on catastrophic\nrisks and AI alignment is often met with skepticism, even by experts.\nFurthermore, online debate over the existential risk of AI has begun to turn\ntribal (e.g. name-calling such as \"doomer\" or \"accelerationist\"). Until now, no\nsystematic study has explored the patterns of belief and the levels of\nfamiliarity with AI safety concepts among experts. I surveyed 111 AI experts on\ntheir familiarity with AI safety concepts, key objections to AI safety, and\nreactions to safety arguments. My findings reveal that AI experts cluster into\ntwo viewpoints -- an \"AI as controllable tool\" and an \"AI as uncontrollable\nagent\" perspective -- diverging in beliefs toward the importance of AI safety.\nWhile most experts (78%) agreed or strongly agreed that \"technical AI\nresearchers should be concerned about catastrophic risks\", many were unfamiliar\nwith specific AI safety concepts. For example, only 21% of surveyed experts had\nheard of \"instrumental convergence,\" a fundamental concept in AI safety\npredicting that advanced AI systems will tend to pursue common sub-goals (such\nas self-preservation).

In this paper, we\nexperimentally demonstrate that, while directly applying DBA to decentralized\nFL, the attack success rate depends on the distribution of attackers in the\nnetwork architecture. Considering that the attackers can not decide their\nlocation, this paper aims to achieve a high attack success rate regardless of\nthe attackers' location distribution. Specifically, we first design a method to\ndetect the network by predicting the distance between any two attackers on the\nnetwork. Then, based on the distance, we organize the attackers in different\nclusters. Lastly, we propose an algorithm to \\textit{dynamically} embed local\npatterns decomposed from a global pattern into the different attackers in each\ncluster. We conduct a thorough empirical investigation and find that our method\ncan, in benchmark datasets, outperform both centralized attacks and naive DBA\nin different decentralized frameworks.",

While natural\nselection has produced these eyes through countless mutations over millions of\nyears, they represent just one set of realized evolutionary paths. Testing\nhypotheses about how environmental pressures shaped eye evolution remains\nchallenging since we cannot experimentally isolate individual factors.\nComputational evolution offers a way to systematically explore alternative\ntrajectories. Here we show how environmental demands drive three fundamental\naspects of visual evolution through an artificial evolution framework that\nco-evolves both physical eye structure and neural processing in embodied\nagents. First, we demonstrate computational evidence that task specific\nselection drives bifurcation in eye evolution - orientation tasks like\nnavigation in a maze leads to distributed compound-type eyes while an object\ndiscrimination task leads to the emergence of high-acuity camera-type eyes.\nSecond, we reveal how optical innovations like lenses naturally emerge to\nresolve fundamental tradeoffs between light collection and spatial precision.\nThird, we uncover systematic scaling laws between visual acuity and neural\nprocessing, showing how task complexity drives coordinated evolution of sensory\nand computational capabilities. Our work introduces a novel paradigm that\nilluminates evolutionary principles shaping vision by creating targeted\nsingle-player games where embodied agents must simultaneously evolve visual\nsystems and learn complex behaviors. Through our unified genetic encoding\nframework, these embodied agents serve as next-generation hypothesis testing\nmachines while providing a foundation for designing manufacturable bio-inspired\nvision systems.

    "abstract": "Recent work indicates that video recognition models are vulnerable to\nadversarial examples, posing a serious security risk to downstream\napplications. However, current research has primarily focused on adversarial\nattacks, with limited work exploring defense mechanisms. Furthermore, due to\nthe spatial-temporal complexity of videos, existing video defense methods face\nissues of high cost, overfitting, and limited defense performance. Recently,\ndiffusion-based adversarial purification methods have achieved robust defense\nperformance in the image domain. However, due to the additional temporal\ndimension in videos, directly applying these diffusion-based adversarial\npurification methods to the video domain suffers performance and efficiency\ndegradation. To achieve an efficient and effective video adversarial defense\nmethod, we propose the first diffusion-based video purification framework to\nimprove video recognition models' adversarial robustness: VideoPure. Given an\nadversarial example, we first employ temporal DDIM inversion to transform the\ninput distribution into a temporally consistent and trajectory-defined\ndistribution, covering adversarial noise while preserving more video structure.\nThen, during DDIM denoising, we leverage intermediate results at each denoising\nstep and conduct guided spatial-temporal optimization, removing adversarial\nnoise while maintaining temporal consistency. Finally, we input the list of\noptimized intermediate results into the video recognition model for multi-step\nvoting to obtain the predicted class. We investigate the defense performance of\nour method against black-box, gray-box, and adaptive attacks on benchmark\ndatasets and models. Compared with other adversarial purification methods, our\nmethod overall demonstrates better defense performance against different\nattacks.

    "abstract": "Inclusive electron scattering cross sections off a hydrogen target at a beam\nenergy of 10.6 GeV have been measured with data collected from the CLAS12\nspectrometer at Jefferson Laboratory. These first absolute cross sections from\nCLAS12 cover a wide kinematic area in invariant mass W of the final state\nhadrons from the pion threshold up to 2.5 GeV for each bin in virtual photon\nfour-momentum transfer squared $Q^2$ from 2.55 to 10.4~GeV$^2$ owing to the\nlarge scattering angle acceptance of the CLAS12 detector. Comparison of the\ncross sections with the resonant contributions computed from the CLAS results\non the nucleon resonance electroexcitation amplitudes has demonstrated a\npromising opportunity to extend the information on their $Q^2$ evolution up to\n10 GeV$^2$. Together these results from CLAS and CLAS12 offer good prospects\nfor probing the nucleon parton distributions at large fractional parton momenta\n$x$ for $W$ < 2.5 GeV, while covering the range of distances where the\ntransition from the strongly coupled to the perturbative regimes is expected.",

Despite the growing body of research in dysarthric\nspeech recognition, many existing systems are speaker-dependent and adaptive,\nlimiting their generalizability across different speakers and etiologies. Our\nprimary objective is to develop a robust speaker-independent model capable of\naccurately recognizing dysarthric speech, irrespective of the speaker.\nAdditionally, as a secondary objective, we aim to test the cross-etiology\nperformance of our model by evaluating it on the TORGO dataset, which contains\nspeech samples from individuals with cerebral palsy (CP) and amyotrophic\nlateral sclerosis (ALS). By leveraging the Whisper model, our\nspeaker-independent system achieved a CER of 6.99% and a WER of 10.71% on the\nSAP-1005 dataset. Further, in cross-etiology settings, we achieved a CER of\n25.08% and a WER of 39.56% on the TORGO dataset. These results highlight the\npotential of our approach to generalize across unseen speakers and different\netiologies of dysarthria.",

    "abstract": "The proximal algorithm is a powerful tool to minimize nonlinear and nonsmooth\nfunctionals in a general metric space. Motivated by the recent progress in\nstudying the training dynamics of the noisy gradient descent algorithm on\ntwo-layer neural networks in the mean-field regime, we provide in this paper a\nsimple and self-contained analysis for the convergence of the general-purpose\nWasserstein proximal algorithm without assuming geodesic convexity of the\nobjective functional. Under a natural Wasserstein analog of the Euclidean\nPolyak-{\\L}ojasiewicz inequality, we establish that the proximal algorithm\nachieves an unbiased and linear convergence rate. Our convergence rate improves\nupon existing rates of the proximal algorithm for solving Wasserstein gradient\nflows under strong geodesic convexity. We also extend our analysis to the\ninexact proximal algorithm for geodesically semiconvex objectives. In our\nnumerical experiments, proximal training demonstrates a faster convergence rate\nthan the noisy gradient descent algorithm on mean-field neural networks.",

    "abstract": "Developing an automated driving system capable of navigating complex traffic\nenvironments remains a formidable challenge. Unlike rule-based or supervised\nlearning-based methods, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based controllers\neliminate the need for domain-specific knowledge and datasets, thus providing\nadaptability to various scenarios. Nonetheless, a common limitation of existing\nstudies on DRL-based controllers is their focus on driving scenarios with\nsimple traffic patterns, which hinders their capability to effectively handle\ncomplex driving environments with delayed, long-term rewards, thus compromising\nthe generalizability of their findings. In response to these limitations, our\nresearch introduces a pioneering hierarchical framework that efficiently\ndecomposes intricate decision-making problems into manageable and interpretable\nsubtasks. We adopt a two step training process that trains the high-level\ncontroller and low-level controller separately. The high-level controller\nexhibits an enhanced exploration potential with long-term delayed rewards, and\nthe low-level controller provides longitudinal and lateral control ability\nusing short-term instantaneous rewards. Through simulation experiments, we\ndemonstrate the superiority of our hierarchical controller in managing complex\nhighway driving situations.",
