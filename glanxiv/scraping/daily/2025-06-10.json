To mathematically assess best-possible antimalarial\ninterventions in the context of hypnozoite reactivation and seasonal forest\nmigration, we extend a previously developed three-scale integro-differential\nequations model of P. vivax transmission. In particular, we fit the model to\ndata gathered over a four-year period in Vietnam to gain insight into local P.\nvivax dynamics and validate the model's ability to capture epidemiological\ntrends. The calibrated model is then used to generate optimal schedules for\nmass-drug administration (MDA) in forest-goers and gauge the efficacy of vector\ncontrol techniques (such as long-lasting insecticide nets and indoor residual\nspraying) in forest-adjacent areas. Our results highlight the dependence of\noptimal MDA timing on the demographics of the human population, the importance\nof interventions targeting the mosquito bite rate, and the need for efficacy in\nhypnozoite-targeting antimalarial drugs.",

We show that $(RSA)^2$ enables\nhuman-compatible interpretations of non-literal utterances without modeling a\nspeaker's motivations for being non-literal.

Therefore, it is critical to account for these\nuncertainties in the design optimization and control of powder bed fusion AM\nprocesses. In this work, we formulate and solve a design optimization problem\nunder uncertainty for a powder bed fusion metal AM process. Our objective is to\nminimize energy consumption while enforcing a risk-based constraint formulated\nwith a buffered probability of failure on residual stress, along with a\nconstraint on melting temperature to ensure a successful build. We use\nsurrogate models for the residual stress and temperature snapshots to\naccelerate optimization; we train these models using data from high-fidelity\nfinite element simulations.

CADASIL is an inherited vascular disease that impairs\nblood flow in the small cerebral vessels of the brain, leading to strokes and\nother neurological deficits. The disease is caused by a mutation in the NOTCH3\ngene located on chromosome 19. NOTCH3 encodes a transmembrane receptor\nexpressed on vascular smooth muscle cells. In CADASIL, mutations in the NOTCH3\ngene lead to the accumulation and deposition of the receptor, affecting the\nnumber of cysteine residues in its extracellular domain. These mutations result\nin the loss or gain of a cysteine residue within the epidermal growth\nfactor-like repeat (EGFr) domains of the NOTCH protein. Beyond traditional\nsymptomatic treatments for stroke, this work highlights advances in disease\nmodifying approaches including gene editing, cell therapies, and immune-based\ninterventions aimed at altering the course of CADASIL. It also examines ongoing\nclinical trials and recent patents related to these novel strategies.

This often leads to a set of equally\npossible underlying causal graphs due to information loss from sub-sampling\n(i.e., not observing all possible states of the system throughout time). Our\nresearch addresses this challenge by incorporating the effects of sub-sampling\nin the derivation of causal graphs, resulting in more accurate and intuitive\noutcomes. We use a constraint optimization approach, specifically answer set\nprogramming (ASP), to find the optimal set of answers. ASP not only identifies\nthe most probable underlying graph, but also provides an equivalence class of\npossible graphs for expert selection. In addition, using ASP allows us to\nleverage graph theory to further prune the set of possible solutions, yielding\na smaller, more accurate answer set significantly faster than traditional\napproaches. We validate our approach on both simulated data and empirical\nstructural brain connectivity, and demonstrate its superiority over established\nmethods in these experiments. We further show how our method can be used as a\nmeta-approach on top of established methods to obtain, on average, 12%\nimprovement in F1 score. In addition, we achieved state of the art results in\nterms of precision and recall of reconstructing causal graph from sub-sampled\ntime series data.

    "abstract": "Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) is a brain-inspired computing paradigm that\nrepresents and manipulates information using high-dimensional vectors, called\nhypervectors (HV). Traditional HDC methods, while robust to noise and\ninherently parallel, rely on single-pass, non-parametric training and often\nsuffer from low accuracy. To address this, recent approaches adopt iterative\ntraining of base and class HVs, typically accelerated on GPUs. Inference,\nhowever, remains lightweight and well-suited for real-time execution. Yet,\nefficient HDC inference has been studied almost exclusively on specialized\nhardware such as FPGAs and GPUs, with limited attention to general-purpose\nmulti-core CPUs. To address this gap, we propose ScalableHD for scalable and\nhigh-throughput HDC inference on multi-core CPUs. ScalableHD employs a\ntwo-stage pipelined execution model, where each stage is parallelized across\ncores and processes chunks of base and class HVs. Intermediate results are\nstreamed between stages using a producer-consumer mechanism, enabling\non-the-fly consumption and improving cache locality. To maximize performance,\nScalableHD integrates memory tiling and NUMA-aware worker-to-core binding.\nFurther, it features two execution variants tailored for small and large batch\nsizes, each designed to exploit compute parallelism based on workload\ncharacteristics while mitigating the memory-bound compute pattern that limits\nHDC inference performance on modern multi-core CPUs. ScalableHD achieves up to\n10x speedup in throughput (samples per second) over state-of-the-art baselines\nsuch as TorchHD, across a diverse set of tasks ranging from human activity\nrecognition to image classification, while preserving task accuracy.\nFurthermore, ScalableHD exhibits robust scalability: increasing the number of\ncores yields near-proportional throughput improvements.",

Effectively detecting and localizing\nsuch silent bugs in distributed training is challenging. Common debugging\npractice using metrics like training loss or gradient norm curves can be\ninefficient and ineffective. Additionally, obtaining intermediate tensor values\nand determining whether they are correct during silent bug localization is\ndifficult, particularly in the context of low-precision training.\n  To address those challenges, we design and implement TTrace, the first system\ncapable of detecting and localizing silent bugs in distributed training.

To properly compare the floating-point values in the tensors,\nwe propose novel mathematical analysis that provides a guideline for setting\nthresholds, enabling TTrace to distinguish bug-induced errors from\nfloating-point round-off errors.

Methods: We identified a cohort\nof PLWHs from the UF Health IDR and performed topic modeling analysis using\nLatent Dirichlet Allocation to uncover stigma-related dimensions and related\nsocial and behavioral contexts. Domain experts created a seed list of\nHIV-related stigma keywords, then applied a snowball strategy to review notes\nfor additional terms until saturation was reached iteratively.

Results: We identified 9140 PLWHs at UF Health and\ncollected 2.9 million clinical notes. Through the iterative keyword approach,\nwe generated a list of 91 keywords associated with HIV-related stigma. Topic\nmodeling on sentences containing at least one keyword uncovered a wide range of\ntopic themes, such as \"Mental Health Concern, Stigma\", \"Treatment Refusal,\nIsolation\", and \"Substance Abuse\". Topic variation analysis across age\nsubgroups revealed substantial differences.

We propose\nlearning the minimum action distance (MAD), defined as the minimum number of\nactions required to transition between states, as a fundamental metric that\ncaptures the underlying structure of an environment. MAD naturally enables\ncritical downstream tasks such as goal-conditioned reinforcement learning and\nreward shaping by providing a dense, geometrically meaningful measure of\nprogress. Our self-supervised learning approach constructs an embedding space\nwhere the distances between embedded state pairs correspond to their MAD,\naccommodating both symmetric and asymmetric approximations. We evaluate the\nframework on a comprehensive suite of environments with known MAD values,\nencompassing both deterministic and stochastic dynamics, as well as discrete\nand continuous state spaces, and environments with noisy observations.\nEmpirical results demonstrate that the proposed approach not only efficiently\nlearns accurate MAD representations across these diverse settings but also\nsignificantly outperforms existing state representation methods in terms of\nrepresentation quality.",

This phenomenon resembles the\nnoisy TV problem postulated in the exploration literature, in which\nexploration-guided agents get stuck by mistaking noise for novelty. To mitigate\nthe disruptive effects of noise in value estimation, we propose using epistemic\nuncertainty estimation to guide the prioritization of transitions from the\nreplay buffer. Epistemic uncertainty quantifies the uncertainty that can be\nreduced by learning, hence reducing transitions sampled from the buffer\ngenerated by unpredictable random processes. We first illustrate the benefits\nof epistemic uncertainty prioritized replay in two tabular toy models: a simple\nmulti-arm bandit task, and a noisy gridworld.

    "abstract": "The problem of estimating the slope parameter in regression between two\nspatial processes under confounding by an unmeasured spatial process has\nreceived widespread attention in the recent statistical literature. Yet, a\nfundamental question remains unsolved: when is this slope consistently\nestimable under spatial confounding, with existing insights being largely\nempirical or estimator-specific. In this manuscript, we characterize conditions\nfor consistent estimability of the regression slope between Gaussian random\nfields (GRFs). Under fixed-domain (infill) asymptotics, we give sufficient\nconditions for consistent estimability using a novel characterization of the\nregression slope as the ratio of principal irregular terms of covariances,\ndictating the relative local behavior of the exposure and confounder processes.\nWhen estimability holds, we provide consistent estimators of the slope using\nlocal differencing (taking discrete differences or Laplacians of the processes\nof suitable order). Using functional analysis results on Paley-Wiener spaces,\nwe then provide an easy-to-verify necessary condition for consistent\nestimability of the slope in terms of the relative spectral tail decays of the\nconfounder and exposure. As a by-product, we establish a novel and general\nspectral condition on the equivalence of measures on the paths of multivariate\nGRFs with component fields of varying smoothnesses, a result of independent\nimportance. We show that for the Mat\\'ern, power-exponential, generalized\nCauchy, and coregionalization families, the necessary and sufficient conditions\nbecome identical, thereby providing a complete characterization of consistent\nestimability of the slope under spatial confounding. The results are extended\nto accommodate measurement error using local-averaging-and-differencing based\nestimators. Finite sample behavior is explored via numerical experiments.",

Prior research has focused on detecting relatively small\nvolumes of toxic content using various Natural Language Processing (NLP)\ntechniques for the purpose of moderation. However, recent studies emphasize the\nimportance of detecting prosocial communication, which can be as crucial as\nidentifying toxic interactions. Recognizing prosocial behavior allows for its\nanalysis, rewarding, and promotion. Unlike toxicity, there are limited\ndatasets, models, and resources for identifying prosocial behaviors in\ngame-chat text. In this work, we employed unsupervised discovery combined with\ngame domain expert collaboration to identify and categorize prosocial player\nbehaviors from game chat. We further propose a novel Self-Anchored Attention\nModel (SAAM) which gives 7.9% improvement compared to the best existing\ntechnique. The approach utilizes the entire training set as \"anchors\" to help\nimprove model performance under the scarcity of training data. This approach\nled to the development of the first automated system for classifying prosocial\nbehaviors in in-game chats, particularly given the low-resource settings where\nlarge-scale labeled data is not available. Our methodology was applied to one\nof the most popular online gaming titles - Call of Duty(R): Modern\nWarfare(R)II, showcasing its effectiveness. This research is novel in applying\nNLP techniques to discover and classify prosocial behaviors in player in-game\nchat communication.

The quantum mechanical scattering\ncalculations account for the full anisotropic interaction potential, replacing\nthe isotropic approximation.

Computational\nmaterials screening can help identify promising materials from the vast\nchemical space of potential sorbents. Experiments have shown that MOF framework\nflexibility and deformation induced by adsorbate molecules can drastically\naffect adsorption properties such as capacity and selectivity. Force field (FF)\nmodels are commonly used as surrogates for more accurate density functional\ntheory (DFT) calculations when modeling sorbents, but most studies using FFs\nfor MOFs assume framework rigidity to simplify calculations.

This work benchmarks the efficacy of several general\nFFs in describing adsorbate-induced deformation for DAC against DFT.\nSpecifically, we compare a common classical FF (UFF4MOF) with several machine\nlearning (ML) FFs: M3GNet, CHGNet, MACE-MP-0, MACE-MPA-0, eSEN, and the\nEquiformer V2 model developed from the recent Open DAC 2023 dataset.

    "abstract": "Underwater noise pollution caused by anthropogenic activities, such as\noffshore wind farms, significantly affects marine life, hindering the intra-\nand inter-specific interactions of many aquatic species. A common strategy to\nmitigate these effects is to enclose the noise source within a physical barrier\nto achieve acceptable noise levels in the surrounding region. Underwater\nbarriers typically achieve noise reduction through sound absorption based on\nlocally resonant systems (e.g., foam and bubble elements) or sound reflecting\nsystems (e.g., air bubble curtains). Although locally resonant-based solutions\ncan yield significant noise attenuation levels, their performance is usually\nnarrow-band. On the other hand, sound-reflecting systems require wider\ndimensions, presenting poor performance in the low-frequency range. Thus,\nsignificant low-frequency underwater noise attenuation remains an open issue,\nespecially when considering thin structures that perform over a broad frequency\nrange. In this work, we present the design of thin metamaterial-based acoustic\nbarriers whose underwater noise attenuation is owed to tailored anisotropic\nmaterial properties. A topology optimization approach is used to obtain a unit\ncell that maximizes the coupling between normal stresses and shear strains (and\nvice-versa). The resulting metabarrier presents a sub-wavelength\nthickness-to-wavelength ratio in the low-frequency range (circa 1/70 below 1\nkHz) and also high sound transmission loss values at higher frequencies (almost\n100 dB above 2 kHz). We also investigate the effects of increased hydrostatic\npressure, presenting structural modifications that enable real-world\napplications. The results presented in this work indicate an efficient\nmetamaterial-based solution for the mitigation of underwater noise, suggesting\na fruitful direction for the exploitation of anisotropy in acoustic insulation\napplications.",

A hybrid CPU-GPU execution model is adopted, in which\nnumerical components are selectively assigned to either the CPU or the GPU,\ndepending on considerations of performance or convenience. This design enables\na progressive porting strategy, allowing most features of the original\nCPU-based codebase to be gradually and seamlessly adapted to GPU execution. The\nnew architecture builds upon two complementary paradigms: a classical\nobject-oriented structure for CPU execution, and a data-oriented counterpart\nfor GPUs, which reproduces the modularity of the original code while\neliminating object-oriented overhead detrimental to GPU performance. Central to\nthis approach is the use of modern C++, including standard parallel algorithms\nand template metaprogramming techniques, which permit the generation of\nhardware-agnostic computational kernels. This facilitates the development of\nuser-defined, GPU-accelerated components such as collision operators or\nboundary conditions, while preserving compatibility with the existing codebase\nand avoiding the need for external libraries or non-standard language\nextensions.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) generation have led to the\nemergence of highly expressive models such as diffusion transformers (DiTs),\nexemplified by FLUX. However, their massive parameter sizes lead to slow\ninference, high memory usage, and poor deployability. Existing acceleration\nmethods (e.g., single-step distillation and attention pruning) often suffer\nfrom significant performance degradation and incur substantial training costs.\nTo address these limitations, we propose FastFLUX, an architecture-level\npruning framework designed to enhance the inference efficiency of FLUX. At its\ncore is the Block-wise Replacement with Linear Layers (BRLL) method, which\nreplaces structurally complex residual branches in ResBlocks with lightweight\nlinear layers while preserving the original shortcut connections for stability.\nFurthermore, we introduce Sandwich Training (ST), a localized fine-tuning\nstrategy that leverages LoRA to supervise neighboring blocks, mitigating\nperformance drops caused by structural replacement. Experiments show that our\nFastFLUX maintains high image quality under both qualitative and quantitative\nevaluations, while significantly improving inference speed, even with 20\\% of\nthe hierarchy pruned. Our code will be available soon.",

However, current AD and AL approaches are often susceptible to\nadversarial attacks due to limitations in training data, which typically\ninclude only normal, unlabeled samples. This study introduces PatchGuard, an\nadversarially robust AD and AL method that incorporates pseudo anomalies with\nlocalization masks within a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based architecture to\naddress these vulnerabilities. We begin by examining the essential properties\nof pseudo anomalies, and follow it by providing theoretical insights into the\nattention mechanisms required to enhance the adversarial robustness of AD and\nAL systems. We then present our approach, which leverages Foreground-Aware\nPseudo-Anomalies to overcome the deficiencies of previous anomaly-aware\nmethods. Our method incorporates these crafted pseudo-anomaly samples into a\nViT-based framework, with adversarial training guided by a novel loss function\ndesigned to improve model robustness, as supported by our theoretical analysis.\nExperimental results on well-established industrial and medical datasets\ndemonstrate that PatchGuard significantly outperforms previous methods in\nadversarial settings, achieving performance gains of $53.2\\%$ in AD and\n$68.5\\%$ in AL, while also maintaining competitive accuracy in non-adversarial\nsettings.

    "abstract": "Runaway electrons are known to provide robust ideal or collisionless\n  kinetic drive for plasma wave instabilities in both the whistler and\n  slow-X branches, via the anomalous Doppler-shifted cyclotron\n  resonances. In a cold and dense post-thermal-quench plasma,\n  collisional damping of the plasma waves can be competitive with the\n  collisionless drive. Previous studies have found that for its higher\n  wavelength and frequency, slow-X waves suffer stronger collisional\n  damping than the whistlers, while the ideal growth rate of slow-X\n  modes is higher. Here we study runaway avalanche distributions that maintain\nthe same eigen distribution and increase only in magnitude over time. The\ndistributions are computed from the\n  relativistic Fokker-Planck-Boltzmann solver, upon which a linear\n  dispersion analysis is performed to search for the most unstable or\n  least damped slow-X and whistler modes. Taking into account the\n  effect of plasma density, plasma temperature, and effective charge\n  number, we find that the slow-X modes tend to be excited before the\n  whistlers in a runaway current ramp-up. Furthermore, even when the\n  runaway current density is sufficiently high that both branches are\n  excited, the most unstable slow-X mode has much higher growth rate\n  than the most unstable whistler mode. The qualitative and\n  quantitative trends uncovered in current study indicate that even\n  though past experiments and modeling efforts have concentrated on whistler\nmodes, there's a compelling case that slow-X modes should also be a key area of\nfocus.",

We develop a\nframework beyond the classical paradigm for power-law fluids, providing a\nunified account for the distinct behaviors of the advancing contact lines. We\nshow that the apparent dynamic contact angle $\\theta_d$ can depend on the\nextent of the characteristic dissipation length $h^* \\propto U_n/(n-1)$,\naltering its dependence on the contact line speed $U$. For shear-thinning\nfluids, we find $\\theta_d \\sim (h/h^*)^{(1-n)/3}$, with contact line motion\nbeing dissipated within $h^*$ extending beyond the local wedge height $h$\nwithout requiring a cutoff. In drop spreading problems, $\\theta_d$ varies with\nthe spreading radius $R$, leading to $\\theta_d \\propto U^{3n/(2n+7)}$\nconsistent with the spreading law $R \\propto t^{n/(3n+7)}$ derived from a\nself-similar solution, where $R$ is the spreading radius and $t$ is time. For\nshear-thickening fluids, the apparent contact line motion is characterized by\n$\\theta_d \\sim (h^*/h_m)^{(1-n)/3}$, where dissipation is concentrated within\n$h^*$ which is smaller than the microscopic liquid height $h_m$ near the\ncontact line. In fact, the dynamic contact angle relationship in this case can\nbe expressed as the Cox-Voinov law $\\theta_d \\sim Ca_{eff}^{1/3}$ in terms of a\ncapillary number $Ca_{eff} =\\eta_f U/\\gamma$ where $\\gamma$ is the surface\ntension and $\\eta_f \\propto (U/ h_m)^{n-1}$ is the viscosity based on the local\nshear rate $U/h_m$ across $h_m$. We also show that a precursor film induced by\nmolecular forces ahead of the wedge leads to $h_m \\propto U^{-n/(4-n)}$ and\nhence $\\theta_d \\propto U^{3n/(4-n)}$, making the spreading behavior highly\nsensitive to the contact line microstructure.

    "abstract": "The spectral width wB and the center wavelength lB of the UV absorption bump\nuvB measured for two z=7 galaxies were found to differ from Milky Way (MW)\nvalues. A decrease of wB by 45% and a positive shift of lB by 70-80 Ang were\nmeasured. In the MW, the uvB amplitude hB and wB do vary; however, such a\nnarrow bump has never been observed and no variability of lB has been\nconvincingly found. Recently, links have been found between both hB and wB and\nthe strength of several Diffuse Interstellar absorption Bands (DIBs). They were\nfound to be limited to the sigma-type DIBs and their detection to be strongly\nfavored if the data were limited to monocloud-type lines-of-sight, selected\nbased on 3D dust maps. We extended the study of the links between MW DIBs and\nuvB to the lB value and to the hB to continuum ratio, and compared MW\nvariations of the bump parameters to high z values. We used the 5780 and 6284 A\nsigma, and 5797 and 5850 A zeta DIBs. Similarly to hB and wB, lB reacts to the\nabundance of sigma carriers and is insensitive to the abundance of zeta DIB\ncarriers, which dominate in dense cloud cores. A strong abundance of sigma\ncarriers induces a shift of lB to longer wavelengths and a decrease of wB. The\nMW lB and wB variability range is about half the difference between average MW\nvalues and values in the distant galaxies. These results reinforce the\nhypothesis of the existence of individual types of hydrocarbon molecules\nresponsible for both DIBs and part of the UV bump. They show that the majority\nof species responsible for narrow and positively shifted bumps in distant\ngalaxies have a link with or are those producing the sigma DIBs and the\nlong-wavelength part of the bump in the MW, and that species producing the\nshort-wavelength part of the bump in the MW are of a different nature and\nabsent along the paths to regions of those distant galaxies that contribute\nmost to the UV emission.",

AI-based perception outputs are inherently\nstochastic, with variability driven by these external factors, while\ntraditional evaluation metrics remain static and event-independent, failing to\ncapture fluctuations in confidence over time. In this work, we introduce the\nPerception Characteristics Distance (PCD) -- a novel evaluation metric that\nquantifies the farthest distance at which an object can be reliably detected,\nincorporating uncertainty in model outputs. To support this, we present the\nSensorRainFall dataset, collected on the Virginia Smart Road using a\nsensor-equipped vehicle (cameras, radar, LiDAR) under controlled daylight-clear\nand daylight-rain scenarios, with precise ground-truth distances to the target\nobjects. Statistical analysis reveals the presence of change points in the\nvariance of detection confidence score with distance. By averaging the PCD\nvalues across a range of detection quality thresholds and probabilistic\nthresholds, we compute the mean PCD (mPCD), which captures the overall\nperception characteristics of a system with respect to detection distance.\nApplying state-of-the-art perception models shows that mPCD captures meaningful\nreliability differences under varying weather conditions -- differences that\nstatic metrics overlook. PCD provides a principled, distribution-aware measure\nof perception performance, supporting safer and more robust ADS operation,\nwhile the SensorRainFall dataset offers a valuable benchmark for evaluation.\nThe SensorRainFall dataset is publicly available at\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datadrivenwheels/sensorrainfall, and the\nevaluation code is open-sourced at\nhttps://github.com/datadrivenwheels/PCD_Python.",

It is a key component of Earth system state estimation and is\ncommonly used in weather and ocean forecasting. The approach involves a\nlarge-scale generalized nonlinear least-squares problem.

Following this, we\nintroduce a novel imputation framework, Macomss, specifically designed to\nhandle structurally and heterogeneously occurring missing data. We establish\ntheoretical guarantees for Macomss, ensuring its robustness in preserving the\nintegrity and reliability of integrated analyses. To assess its empirical\nperformance, we conduct extensive simulation studies that replicate the complex\nmissingness patterns observed in real-world EHR systems, complemented by\nvalidation using EHR datasets from the Duke University Health System (DUHS).\n  Results: Simulation studies show that our approach consistently outperforms\nexisting imputation methods. Using datasets from three hospitals within DUHS,\nMacomss achieves the lowest imputation errors for missing data in most cases\nand provides superior or comparable downstream prediction performance compared\nto benchmark methods.\n  Conclusions: We provide a theoretically guaranteed and practically meaningful\nmethod for imputing structured and sporadic missing data, enabling accurate and\nreliable integrated analysis across multiple EHR datasets.

Recently, Latent Space Dynamics Identification (LaSDI) was\nproposed as a data-driven, non-intrusive ROM framework. LaSDI compresses the\ntraining data using an autoencoder and learns a system of user-chosen ordinary\ndifferential equations (ODEs), which govern the latent space dynamics. This\nallows for rapid predictions by interpolating and evolving the low-dimensional\nODEs in the latent space. While LaSDI has produced effective ROMs for numerous\nproblems, the autoencoder can have difficulty accurately reconstructing\ntraining data while also satisfying the imposed dynamics in the latent space,\nparticularly in complex or high-frequency regimes. To address this, we propose\nmulti-stage Latent Space Dynamics Identification (mLaSDI). With mLaSDI, several\nautoencoders are trained sequentially in stages, where each autoencoder learns\nto correct the error of the previous stages. We find that applying mLaSDI with\nsmall autoencoders results in lower prediction and reconstruction errors, while\nalso reducing training time compared to LaSDI.",

It is well known that the IET\ndistribution for regular earthquakes is commonly characterized by a power law\nwith the exponent of 0.3. However, less is known about other classes of\nearthquakes, such as volcanic earthquakes, which do not manifest\nmainshock-aftershocks sequences. Since volcanic earthquakes are caused by the\nmovement of magmas, their IET distribution may be closely related to the\nvolcanic activities and therefore of particular interest. Nevertheless, the\ngeneral form of IET distribution for volcanic earthquakes and its dependence on\nvolcanic activity are still unknown. Here we show that the power-law exponent\ncharacterizing the IET distribution exhibits a few common values depending on\nthe stage of volcanic activity. Volcanoes with steady seismicity exhibit the\nlowest exponent ranging from 0.6 to 0.7. During the burst period, when the\nearthquake rate is highest, the exponent reaches its peak at approximately 1.3.\nIn the preburst phase, the exponent takes on the intermediate value of 1.0.\nThese values are common to several different volcanoes. Since the preburst\nphase is characterized by the distinct exponent value, it may serve as an\nindicator of imminent volcanic activity that is accompanied by a surge in\nseismic events.",

    "abstract": "Proximity ferroelectricity is a novel paradigm for inducing ferroelectricity,\nwhere a non-ferroelectric polar material, which is unswitchable with an\nexternal field below the dielectric breakdown field, becomes a practically\nswitchable ferroelectric in direct contact with a thin switchable ferroelectric\nlayer. Here, we develop a Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire approach to study the\nproximity effect of local piezoelectric response and polarization reversal in\nwurtzite ferroelectric multilayers under a sharp electrically biased tip. Using\nfinite element modeling we analyze the probe-induced nucleation of nanodomains,\nthe features of local polarization hysteresis loops and coercive fields in the\nAl1-xScxN/AlN bilayers and three-layers. Similar to the wurtzite multilayers\nsandwiched between two parallel electrodes, the regimes of \"proximity\nswitching\" (where the multilayers collectively switch) and the regime of\n\"proximity suppression\" (where they collectively do not switch) are the only\ntwo possible regimes in the probe-electrode geometry. However, the parameters\nand asymmetry of the local piezo-response and polarization hysteresis loops\ndepend significantly on the sequence of the layers with respect to the probe.\nThe physical mechanism of the proximity ferroelectricity in the local probe\ngeometry is a depolarizing electric field determined by the polarization of the\nlayers and their relative thickness. The field, whose direction is opposite to\nthe polarization vector in the layer(s) with the larger spontaneous\npolarization (such as AlN), renormalizes the double-well ferroelectric\npotential to lower the steepness of the switching barrier in the \"otherwise\nunswitchable\" polar layers. Tip-based control of domains in otherwise\nnon-ferroelectric layers using proximity ferroelectricity can provide nanoscale\ncontrol of domain reversal in memory, actuation, sensing and optical\napplications.",

We\nintroduce LaDCast, the first global latent-diffusion framework for medium-range\nensemble forecasting, which generates hourly ensemble forecasts entirely in a\nlearned latent space. An autoencoder compresses high-dimensional ERA5\nreanalysis fields into a compact representation, and a transformer-based\ndiffusion model produces sequential latent updates with arbitrary hour\ninitialization. The model incorporates Geometric Rotary Position Embedding\n(GeoRoPE) to account for the Earth's spherical geometry, a dual-stream\nattention mechanism for efficient conditioning, and sinusoidal temporal\nembeddings to capture seasonal patterns. LaDCast achieves deterministic and\nprobabilistic skill close to that of the European Centre for Medium-Range\nForecast IFS-ENS, without any explicit perturbations. Notably, LaDCast\ndemonstrates superior performance in tracking rare extreme events such as\ncyclones, capturing their trajectories more accurately than established models.\nBy operating in latent space, LaDCast reduces storage and compute by orders of\nmagnitude, demonstrating a practical path toward forecasting at kilometer-scale\nresolution in real time.

The JFCs therefore represent the ideal dynamical population for\ninvestigating the dust production rates at high-cadence. We analyzed\nobservations by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) of 74\nJFCs that reached perihelion in 2022 and 2023. The work contained in this study\nbuilds upon our previous work (Gillan et al. 2024), for a total of 116 JFCs\nover a four-year period. Using the Afrho parameter, we measured the dust\nproduction rates of each JFC as a function of heliocentric distance. We found\nthat there remained a clear preference for JFCs to reach their maximum A(0)frho\npost-perihelion, with 170P/Christensen, 254P/McNaught and P/2020 WJ5 (Lemmon)\nreaching a maximum A(0)frho between 200-400 days after perihelion. However, all\nJFCs reached their maximum dust production within 10% of their orbital period\nrelative to perihelion. Fitting A(0)fp as a function of Rh^n, we measured\nstatistically significant differences in the distribution of pre-perihelion and\npost-perihelion activity index n, with average activity indices of -5.2 +/- 4.5\nand -3.2 +/- 2.7 respectively.

While well-studied with single-timepoint data,\nstandard methods do not easily generalize to address non-baseline positivity\nviolations in longitudinal data, and remain vulnerable to such violations. In\nthis paper, we extend weighting and trimming to longitudinal data via\nstochastic ``flip'' interventions, which maintain the treatment status of\nsubjects who would have received the target treatment, and flip others'\ntreatment to the target with probability equal to their weight (e.g., overlap\nweight, trimming indicator). We first show, in single-timepoint data, that flip\ninterventions yield a large class of weighted average treatment effects,\nascribing a novel policy interpretation to these popular weighted estimands.\nWith longitudinal data, we then show that flip interventions provide\ninterpretable weighting or trimming on non-baseline covariates and, crucially,\nyield effects that are identifiable under arbitrary positivity violations.\nMoreover, we demonstrate that flip interventions are policy-relevant since they\ncould be implemented in practice. By contrast, we show that alternative\napproaches for weighting on non-baseline covariates fail to achieve this\nproperty. We derive flexible and efficient estimators based on efficient\ninfluence functions when the weight is a smooth function of the propensity\nscore. Namely, we construct multiply robust-style and sequentially doubly\nrobust-style estimators that achieve root-n consistency and asymptotic\nnormality under nonparametric conditions.

Compared to\npredictions using BH repositioning, the overall $z\\gtrsim5$ BH merger rates\nunder subgrid DF decrease by a factor of $\\sim4-10$. Under subgrid DF, the\ndifferent seed models predict merger rates between $\\sim100-1000$ events per\nyear at $z\\gtrsim5$. These mergers dominate early BH growth, assembling BHs up\nto $\\sim10^4-10^5~M_{\\odot}$ by $z\\sim5$, wherein $\\lesssim2~\\%$ of their mass\nis assembled via gas accretion. Our results highlight the promise for\nconstraining seeding mechanisms using gravitational waves from future\nfacilities such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of automated vehicles (AVs) in recent years,\ncommercially available AVs are increasingly demonstrating high-level automation\ncapabilities. However, most existing AV safety evaluation methods are primarily\ndesigned for simple maneuvers such as car-following and lane-changing. While\nsuitable for basic tests, these methods are insufficient for assessing\nhigh-level automation functions deployed in more complex environments. First,\nthese methods typically use crash rate as the evaluation metric, whose accuracy\nheavily depends on the quality and completeness of naturalistic driving\nenvironment data used to estimate scenario probabilities. Such data is often\ndifficult and expensive to collect. Second, when applied to diverse scenarios,\nthese methods suffer from the curse of dimensionality, making large-scale\nevaluation computationally intractable. To address these challenges, this paper\nproposes a novel framework for full-scenario AV safety evaluation. A unified\nmodel is first introduced to standardize the representation of diverse driving\nscenarios. This modeling approach constrains the dimension of most scenarios to\na regular highway setting with three lanes and six surrounding background\nvehicles, significantly reducing dimensionality. To further avoid the\nlimitations of probability-based method, we propose a volume-based evaluation\nmethod that quantifies the proportion of risky scenarios within the entire\nscenario space. For car-following scenarios, we prove that the set of safe\nscenarios is convex under specific settings, enabling exact volume computation.\nExperimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed volume-based\nmethod using both AV behavior models from existing literature and six\nproduction AV models calibrated from field-test trajectory data in the Ultra-AV\ndataset.

    "abstract": "Hybrid Foreground Residual Subtraction (HyFoReS) is a new family of\nalgorithms designed to remove systematics-induced foreground contamination for\n21-cm intensity mapping data. Previously, the algorithm was shown to be\neffective in mitigating beam perturbations in sky maps from the Canadian\nHydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME). In this study, we apply HyFoReS\nto CHIME simulations and test the algorithm's ability to mitigate antenna\ngain-type systematics in polarized visibilities. Simulating a two-cylinder\ntelescope similar to the CHIME pathfinder, we find that HyFoReS reduces\nforeground bias caused by bandpass perturbations to a level below the thermal\nnoise, provided that the RMS value of the perturbations is on the order of\n$10^{-4}$ or lower. When tested with complex antenna-dependent gain errors,\nHyFoReS can reduce residual foreground bias in the power spectrum by up to\nthree orders of magnitude. While noise bias and second-order perturbations are\ncurrently the limiting factors for the algorithm, we have demonstrated that\nHyFoReS can suppress gain-induced foreground leakage in polarized data from\n21-cm telescopes, aiding in the detection of the 21-cm auto-power spectrum for\nhydrogen intensity mapping experiments.",

    "abstract": "Object transport tasks are fundamental in robotic automation, emphasizing the\nimportance of efficient and secure methods for moving objects. Non-prehensile\ntransport can significantly improve transport efficiency, as it enables\nhandling multiple objects simultaneously and accommodating objects unsuitable\nfor parallel-jaw or suction grasps. Existing approaches incorporate constraints\nbased on the Coulomb friction model, which is imprecise during fast motions\nwhere inherent mechanical vibrations occur. Imprecise constraints can cause\ntransported objects to slide or even fall off the tray. To address this\nlimitation, we propose a novel method to learn a friction model using acoustic\nsensing that maps a tray's motion profile to a dynamically conditioned friction\ncoefficient. This learned model enables an optimization-based motion planner to\nadjust the friction constraint at each control step according to the planned\nmotion at that step. In experiments, we generate time-optimized trajectories\nfor a UR5e robot to transport various objects with constraints using both the\nstandard Coulomb friction model and the learned friction model. Results suggest\nthat the learned friction model reduces object displacement by up to 86.0%\ncompared to the baseline, highlighting the effectiveness of acoustic sensing in\nlearning real-world friction constraints.",

    "abstract": "Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is a key marker of both metabolic health and\nhabitual physical activity (PA). Excess VAT is highly correlated with type 2\ndiabetes and insulin resistance. The mechanistic basis for this pathophysiology\nrelates to overloading the liver with fatty acids. VAT is also a highly labile\nfat depot, with increased turnover stimulated by catecholamines during\nexercise. VAT can be measured with sophisticated imaging technologies, but can\nalso be inferred directly from PA. We tested this relationship using National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data from 2011-2014, for\nindividuals aged 20-60 years with 7 days of accelerometry data (n=2,456 men;\n2,427 women) [1]. Two approaches were used for estimating VAT from activity.\nThe first used engineered features based on movements during gait and sleep,\nand then ridge regression to map summary statistics of these features into a\nVAT estimate. The second approach used deep neural networks trained on 24 hours\nof continuous accelerometry. A foundation model first mapped each 10s frame\ninto a high-dimensional feature vector. A transformer model then mapped each\nday's feature vector time series into a VAT estimate, which were averaged over\nmultiple days. For both approaches, the most accurate estimates were obtained\nwith the addition of covariate information about subject demographics and body\nmeasurements. The best performance was obtained by combining the two\napproaches, resulting in VAT estimates with correlations of r=0.86. These\nfindings demonstrate a strong relationship between PA and VAT and, by\nextension, between PA and metabolic health risks.",

However, the\nanthropomorphic characteristics of these chatbots create ambiguity regarding\nwhether students develop trust toward them as they would a human peer or\ninstructor, based in interpersonal trust, or as they would any other piece of\ntechnology, based in technology trust. This ambiguity presents theoretical\nchallenges, as interpersonal trust models may inappropriately ascribe human\nintentionality and morality to AI, while technology trust models were developed\nfor non-social technologies, leaving their applicability to anthropomorphic\nsystems unclear. To address this gap, we investigate how human-like and\nsystem-like trusting beliefs comparatively influence students' perceived\nenjoyment, trusting intention, behavioral intention to use, and perceived\nusefulness of an AI chatbot - factors associated with students' engagement and\nlearning outcomes. Through partial least squares structural equation modeling,\nwe found that human-like and system-like trust significantly influenced student\nperceptions, with varied effects. Human-like trust more strongly predicted\ntrusting intention, while system-like trust better predicted behavioral\nintention and perceived usefulness. Both had similar effects on perceived\nenjoyment. Given the partial explanatory power of each type of trust, we\npropose that students develop a distinct form of trust with AI chatbots\n(human-AI trust) that differs from human-human and human-technology models of\ntrust.

This approach\nyields far fewer image tokens than uniform patch tokenization. As a result we\ncan drastically reduce the computational cost of segmentation without reducing\nmodel size.

We found that the number of satellites around Milky\nWay analogs closely aligns with observations, which accords with recent\nstudies. In our simulations, the majority of subhalos are devoid of stars,\ni.e., \"starless.\" We first examined supernova feedback and the environmental\neffects associated with subhalos' orbital motion as candidates of origin.\nHowever, neither seems to be the main driver. Supernova feedback causes a\nreduction of cold gas in \"starred\" subhalos, but its impact is not significant.\nIn the case of starless subhalos, supernova feedback is irrelevant because most\nof them do not have in-situ star formation in the first place. The orbital\nmotion in dense environments causes gas removal in all subhalos but is not\nenough to remove pre-existing stars. The key is found to be the effect of\nreionization instead. Starless subhalos are initially born in regions that are\nless efficient in accreting matter. This makes them lack sufficiently dense gas\nto self-shield from UV background heating, preventing their gas from cooling\nbelow the star formation threshold.

Our algorithm implements an isometry between the occupation\nnumber basis of a fermionic Fock space of $2d$ modes, and the Gelfand-Tsetlin\n(GT) states spanning irreducible representations of the group $U(d) \\times\nSU(2)$. The latter forms a basis indexed by well-defined values of total\nparticle number $N$, global spin $S$, spin projection $M$, and $U(d)$ GT\npatterns. This realises the antisymmetric unitary-unitary duality discovered by\nHowe and developed into the Unitary Group Approach (UGA) for computational\nchemistry by Paldus and Shavitt in the 1970s. The Paldus transform lends tools\nfrom the UGA readily applicable to quantum computational chemistry, leading to\nmaximally sparse representations of spin-free Hamiltonians, efficient\npreparation of Configuration State Functions, and a direct interpretation of\nquantum chemistry reduced density matrix elements in terms of $SU(2)$ angular\nmomentum coupling. The transform also enables the encoding of quantum\ninformation into novel Decoherence-Free Subsystems for use in communication and\nerror mitigation. Our work can be seen as a generalisation of the quantum Schur\ntransform for the second quantisation, made tractable by the Pauli exclusion\nprinciple.

The modeling\nof out-of-equilibrium effects in these relativistic, astrophysical objects must\nbe one with care, as simple Newtonian intuition fails to remain causal. Radial\nstability of neutron stars is one of the primary conditions for the viability\nof such out-of-equilibrium models. In this paper, we study radial perturbations\nof neutron stars for the Eckart, the Bemfica-Disconzi-Noronha-Kovtun, and the\nM\\\"uller-Israel-Stewart fluid models of relativistic viscous fluids. We find\nthat for small viscosity, the three models have the same stability properties:\nthey are always stable to bulk and shear viscosity, but they can be unstable to\nheat conductivity if certain thermodynamic conditions are violated. For the\nlatter case, we derive a necessary criterion for stability to heat conductivity\nthat applies to all three fluids. Moreover, we show that the additional degrees\nof freedom introduced by the Bemfica-Disconzi-Noronha-Kovtun and the\nM\\\"uller-Israel-Stewart models force the perturbations to evolve on fast\ntimescales. Specifically, the Bemfica-Disconzi-Noronha-Kovtun model has\nadditional oscillatory perturbations that propagate with the speed of second\nsound, while the M\\\"uller-Israel-Stewart model MIS only exhibits decaying\nbehavior on the fast timescale.

However, the advantages of EP sensors have remained highly\ncontested, primarily due to their inherent hypersensitivity to model errors and\nloss of precision arising from eigenbasis collapse, quantified by the Petermann\nnoise factor. Recently, it has been suggested that practical sensor\nimplementations should instead utilize transmission peak degeneracies (TPDs),\nwhich exhibit square-root transmission splitting while maintaining a complete\neigenbasis, potentially mitigating the Petermann noise around EPs. This work\npresents a microwave magnon-photon dimer with near-universal tunability across\nall relevant parameters, which we use to investigate various TPDs\nexperimentally. We demonstrate that two-dimensional EP and TPD configurations\nbased on coupled oscillators can be unified into a general theory and\nexperimental framework utilizing synthetic gauge fields, which we present and\nvalidate through careful experiments on two representative TPDs. We also\nintroduce practical metrics to quantify the performance and robustness of TPDs\nbeyond just the Petermann noise factor.

We introduce a model-independent framework\nthat predicts the distribution of observed fluences and distances, and\nrepetition rates of an FRB population based on an assumed burst rate\ndistribution per source. Using parameters derived directly from observations,\nthis framework simultaneously explains several key features of the FRB\npopulation: (i) The observed ratio of repeaters to apparent non-repeaters; (ii)\nThe much lower ratio of apparent non-repeaters to the total number of Soft\nGamma Repeater (SGR) sources within the observable Universe; And (iii) the\nslightly smaller average distances of known repeaters compared to\nnon-repeaters. We further explore how survey parameters, such as radio\nsensitivity and observation time, influence these statistics. Notably, we find\nthat the fraction of repeaters rises only mildly with improved sensitivity or\nlonger exposure. This weak dependence could be misinterpreted as evidence that\nnot all FRBs repeat.

We\nalso prove that, at order $1/Q$, the first moment of the HJM distribution\ninvolves an additional non-perturbative parameter compared to the power\ncorrection that shifts the tail of the spectrum (where $1\\gg \\rho\\gg\n\\Lambda_{QCD}/Q$). This differs from thrust where a single non-perturbative\nparameter at order $1/Q$ describes both the first moment and the tail, and it\ndisfavors models of power corrections employing a single non-perturbative\nparameter, such as the low-scale effective coupling model.

The CO\nline ratios (especially CO(2-1)/CO(1-0) - $R_{21}$) vary within and among\ngalaxies, yet previous studies on $R_{21}$ and alike often rely on measurements\nconstructed by combining data from facilities with substantial relative\ncalibration uncertainties that have the same order as physical line ratio\nvariations. Hence robustly determining systematic $R_{21}$ variations is\nchallenging. Here, we compare CO(1-0) and CO(2-1) mapping data from ALMA for 14\nnearby galaxies, at a common physical resolution of 1.7 kpc. Our dataset\nincludes new ALMA (7m+TP) CO(1-0) maps of 12 galaxies. We investigate $R_{21}$\nvariation to understand its dependence on global galaxy properties, kpc-scale\nenvironmental factors, and its correlation with star formation rate (SFR)\nsurface density and metallicity. We find that the galaxy-to-galaxy scatter is\n0.05 dex. This is lower than previous studies which reported over 0.1 dex\nvariation, likely reflecting significant flux calibration uncertainties in\nsingle-dish surveys. Within individual galaxies, $R_{21}$ has a typical mean\nvalue of ~0.64 and 0.1 dex variation, with an increase to ~0.75 towards\ngalactic centers. We find strong correlations between $R_{21}$ and various\ngalactic parameters, particularly SFR surface density, which shows a power-law\nslope of 0.10-0.11 depending on the adopted binning/fitting methods. Our\nfindings suggest that, for studies covering main sequence galaxy samples,\nassuming a fixed $R_{21}$=0.64 does not significantly bias kpc-scale molecular\ngas mass estimates from CO(2-1). Instead, systematic uncertainties from flux\ncalibration and the CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor account for more systematic\nscatter of CO-derived molecular gas properties.",

X-ray SNRs in galaxies\nbeyond the Local Group are rare, mainly due to the limited sensitivity of\ncurrent X-ray instruments. Additionally, their identification requires an\noptical counterpart, making incomplete optical identification methods an extra\nchallenge. Detecting X-ray SNRs in other galaxies is crucial for understanding\ntheir feedback in different evolutionary phases and gaining insights into their\nlocal interstellar medium. In NGC 7793, only one X-ray SNR was previously\nknown, while a recent study reported nearly 240 optical SNRs. The discovery of\na new, larger optical SNR sample motivated a re-examination of the X-ray SNR\npopulation by comparing optical SNRs with X-ray sources. To identify X-ray\nSNRs, we utilised Chandra's spatial resolution and analysed all available\narchival data of NGC 7793, totaling 229.9 ks over 19 years. After data\nreduction, we performed source detection and analysis, searching for X-ray\nsources coinciding with optical SNRs. We also used XMM-Newton for spectral\nanalysis of the confirmed and candidate SNRs. We detected 58 X-ray sources down\nto an observed luminosity of $\\sim 1.5\\times 10^{36}\\, erg\\, s^{-1}$. Among\nthem, five X-ray counterparts to optical SNRs were identified, all presenting\nsoft emission (<1.2 keV) with no short- or long-term variability. One\ncorresponds to the previously known X-ray SNR, while four are newly detected.\nSpectral modeling of two SNRs shows thermal spectra exceeding 2.5 million K,\nwith strong OVII, OVIII, and NeIX emission lines. A correlation between\ndensity, X-ray luminosity, and source softness was observed. We also report\nX-ray emission from supernova 2008bk, refining its position, and suggest two\ncandidate X-ray SNRs with soft, non-variable spectra, one resembling the\nidentified X-ray SNRs.",

    "abstract": "There is growing evidence that a substantial fraction of the neutron\nstar-black holes (NSBHs) detected through gravitational waves merge with\nnon-zero eccentricity or large BH spin-orbit misalignment. This is in tension\nwith the leading formation scenarios to date. Residual eccentricity rules out\nformation through isolated binary star evolution, while NS natal kicks and the\nunequal masses of NSBHs inhibit efficient pairing in dense stellar\nenvironments. Here, we report that all observed properties-NSBH merger rate,\neccentricity, and spin-orbit misalignment-are explained by the high prevalence\nof massive stellar triples in the field. Modelling their evolution from the\nZAMS, we investigate NSBH mergers caused by gravitational perturbations from a\ntertiary companion. We show that the formation of the NS decisively impacts the\ntriple stability, preferentially leaving behind surviving NSBHs in compact\ntriple architectures. The rich three-body dynamics of compact, unequal-mass\ntriples enables mergers across a wide range of orbital parameters without\nrequiring fine-tuned highly inclined tertiary orbits and provides a natural\nexplanation for an abundance of residual eccentricity and spin-orbit\nmisalignment. We infer a total NSBH merger rate of $R\\sim1-23\\,\\rm\nGpc^{-3}\\,yr^{-1}$, with more than a few 10% exhibiting eccentricity\n$e_{20}>0.1$ or large spin-orbit misalignment $\\cos\\theta_{\\rm BH}<0$,\nconsistent with current observations. Tertiary-driven NSBH mergers closely\ntrack the cosmic star formation rate due to their short delay times, include a\nsubstantial fraction of burst-like highly eccentric systems ($e_{20} > 0.9$),\nand almost universally retain eccentricities $e_{20}>10^{-3}$, potentially\ndetectable by next-generation detectors. If evidence for eccentric and\nmisaligned events solidifies, our results suggest that triple dynamics is the\ndominant formation channel of NSBH mergers.",

    "abstract": "A small fraction of red dwarfs younger than 100 million years show\nstructured, periodic optical light curves suggestive of transiting opaque\nmaterial that corotates with the star. However, the composition, origin, and\neven the existence of this material are uncertain. The main alternative\nhypothesis is that these complex periodic variables (CPVs) are explained by\ncomplex distributions of bright or dark regions on the stellar surfaces. Here,\nwe present time-series spectroscopy and photometry of a rapidly-rotating\n($P$=3.9 hr) CPV, TIC 141146667. The spectra show sinusoidal time-varying\nH$\\alpha$ emission at twice to four times the star's equatorial velocity,\nproviding direct evidence for cool ($\\lesssim$10$^4$ K) plasma clumps trapped\nin corotation around a CPV. These data support the idea that young,\nrapidly-rotating M dwarfs can sustain warped tori of cool plasma, similar to\nother rapidly-rotating magnetic stars. Outstanding questions include whether\ndust clumps in these plasma tori explain CPV light curves, and whether the tori\noriginate from the star or are fed by external sources. Rough estimates suggest\n$\\gtrsim$10% of M dwarfs host similar structures during their early lives.",

    "abstract": "Galactic archaeologists often assume that integrals of motion (IoMs) such as\n$L_z$ and $E$ are conserved, so substructure remains frozen in IoM space over\nmany Gyr. However, this is not true in the Milky Way due in part to its\nrotating bar. In this study we quantify the effects of the bar on the dynamics\nof substructure. We employ three different theoretical models: an analytical\ntoy model; a set of test particle simulations with steady and slowing bars; and\na cosmological zoom-in simulation of a Milky Way-like galaxy. Each model\npredicts that the bar increases the angular momentum and energy spread of\nlow-energy substructures by a factor of $\\sim10-100$, so they cannot remain\ntightly clustered. We derive a criterion for determining when this effect is\nimportant. The most affected orbits are low energy ($E\\lesssim E_\\odot$,\n$r_\\mathrm{apo}<40$ kpc), prograde, eccentric, or low inclination. This\nincludes $\\sim3/4$ of Galactic globular clusters and $\\sim1/4$ of known stellar\nstreams. We predict the presence of abundant bar-dispersed substructure. The\nstructures remain much more tightly clustered in the space of metallicity and\nJacobi integral $H_\\mathrm{J}=E-\\Omega_\\mathrm{b}L_z$. We therefore propose\nusing $H_\\mathrm{J}$ and chemistry instead of traditional IoMs when searching\nfor inner halo substructure. In $(L_z,E)$ space the dispersal of the structures\nis along a principal direction with gradient $\\mathrm{d}E/\\mathrm{d}L_z$ equal\nto the bar's pattern speed $\\Omega_\\mathrm{b}$. Bar-dispersed substructure\nshould therefore allow the past evolution of $\\Omega_\\mathrm{b}$ to be\nconstrained.",

    "abstract": "We develop techniques for generating accurate and precise internal\ncovariances for measurements of clustering and weak lensing angular power\nspectra. These methods are designed to produce non-singular and unbiased\ncovariances for Euclid's large anticipated data vector and will be critical for\nvalidation against observational systematic effects. We construct jackknife\nsegments that are equal in area to high precision by adapting the binary space\npartition algorithm to work on arbitrarily shaped regions on the unit sphere.\nJackknife estimates of the covariances are internally derived and require no\nassumptions about cosmology or galaxy population and bias. Our covariance\nestimation, called DICES (Debiased Internal Covariance Estimation with\nShrinkage), first estimates a noisy covariance through conventional delete-1\njackknife resampling. This is followed by linear shrinkage of the empirical\ncorrelation matrix towards the Gaussian prediction, rather than linear\nshrinkage of the covariance matrix. Shrinkage ensures the covariance is\nnon-singular and therefore invertible, critical for the estimation of\nlikelihoods and validation. We then apply a delete-2 jackknife bias correction\nto the diagonal components of the jackknife covariance that removes the general\ntendency for jackknife error estimates to be biased high. We validate\ninternally derived covariances, which use the jackknife resampling technique,\non synthetic Euclid-like lognormal catalogues. We demonstrate that DICES\nproduces accurate, non-singular covariance estimates, with the relative error\nimproving by $33\\%$ for the covariance and $48\\%$ for the correlation structure\nin comparison to jackknife estimates. These estimates can be used for highly\naccurate regression and inference.",

    "abstract": "The ubiquity of dynamic data in domains such as weather, healthcare, and\nenergy underscores a growing need for effective interpretation and retrieval of\ntime-series data. These data are inherently tied to domain-specific contexts,\nsuch as clinical notes or weather narratives, making cross-modal retrieval\nessential not only for downstream tasks but also for developing robust\ntime-series foundation models by retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Despite\nthe increasing demand, time-series retrieval remains largely underexplored.\nExisting methods often lack semantic grounding, struggle to align heterogeneous\nmodalities, and have limited capacity for handling multi-channel signals. To\naddress this gap, we propose TRACE, a generic multimodal retriever that grounds\ntime-series embeddings in aligned textual context. TRACE enables fine-grained\nchannel-level alignment and employs hard negative mining to facilitate\nsemantically meaningful retrieval. It supports flexible cross-modal retrieval\nmodes, including Text-to-Timeseries and Timeseries-to-Text, effectively linking\nlinguistic descriptions with complex temporal patterns. By retrieving\nsemantically relevant pairs, TRACE enriches downstream models with informative\ncontext, leading to improved predictive accuracy and interpretability. Beyond a\nstatic retrieval engine, TRACE also serves as a powerful standalone encoder,\nwith lightweight task-specific tuning that refines context-aware\nrepresentations while maintaining strong cross-modal alignment. These\nrepresentations achieve state-of-the-art performance on downstream forecasting\nand classification tasks. Extensive experiments across multiple domains\nhighlight its dual utility, as both an effective encoder for downstream\napplications and a general-purpose retriever to enhance time-series models.",

While recent works have\nleveraged large language models (LLMs) for multi-agent planning, a few have\nbegun to explore vision-language models (VLMs) for visual reasoning. However,\nthese VLM-based approaches remain limited in their support for diverse\nembodiment types.

To demonstrate the utility of VIKI-Bench, we propose VIKI-R, a\ntwo-stage framework that fine-tunes a pretrained vision-language model (VLM)\nusing Chain-of-Thought annotated demonstrations, followed by reinforcement\nlearning under multi-level reward signals. Our extensive experiments show that\nVIKI-R significantly outperforms baselines method across all task levels.\nFurthermore, we show that reinforcement learning enables the emergence of\ncompositional cooperation patterns among heterogeneous agents.

Despite their empirical success, the\nunderlying principles governing their emergence and functionality remain\nunclear. This work proposes the Linear Combination Conjecture, positing that\ntask vectors act as single in-context demonstrations formed through linear\ncombinations of the original ones. We provide both theoretical and empirical\nsupport for this conjecture. First, we show that task vectors naturally emerge\nin linear transformers trained on triplet-formatted prompts through loss\nlandscape analysis. Next, we predict the failure of task vectors on\nrepresenting high-rank mappings and confirm this on practical LLMs. Our\nfindings are further validated through saliency analyses and parameter\nvisualization, suggesting an enhancement of task vectors by injecting multiple\nones into few-shot prompts. Together, our results advance the understanding of\ntask vectors and shed light on the mechanisms underlying ICL in\ntransformer-based models.",

To overcome these\nconstraints, we present the Agentic Neural Network(ANN), a framework that\nconceptualizes multi-agent collaboration as a layered neural network\narchitecture. In this design, each agent operates as a node, and each layer\nforms a cooperative \"team\" focused on a specific subtask. Agentic Neural\nNetwork follows a two-phase optimization strategy: (1) Forward Phase-Drawing\ninspiration from neural network forward passes, tasks are dynamically\ndecomposed into subtasks, and cooperative agent teams with suitable aggregation\nmethods are constructed layer by layer. (2) Backward Phase-Mirroring\nbackpropagation, we refine both global and local collaboration through\niterative feedback, allowing agents to self-evolve their roles, prompts, and\ncoordination. This neuro-symbolic approach enables ANN to create new or\nspecialized agent teams post-training, delivering notable gains in accuracy and\nadaptability. Across four benchmark datasets, ANN surpasses leading multi-agent\nbaselines under the same configurations, showing consistent performance\nimprovements.

    "abstract": "Typical large vision-language models (LVLMs) apply autoregressive supervision\nsolely to textual sequences, without fully incorporating the visual modality\ninto the learning process. This results in three key limitations: (1) an\ninability to utilize images without accompanying captions, (2) the risk that\ncaptions omit critical visual details, and (3) the challenge that certain\nvision-centric content cannot be adequately conveyed through text. As a result,\ncurrent LVLMs often prioritize vision-to-language alignment while potentially\noverlooking fine-grained visual information. While some prior works have\nexplored autoregressive image generation, effectively leveraging autoregressive\nvisual supervision to enhance image understanding remains an open challenge. In\nthis paper, we introduce Autoregressive Semantic Visual Reconstruction (ASVR),\nwhich enables joint learning of visual and textual modalities within a unified\nautoregressive framework. We show that autoregressively reconstructing the raw\nvisual appearance of images does not enhance and may even impair multimodal\nunderstanding. In contrast, autoregressively reconstructing the semantic\nrepresentation of images consistently improves comprehension. Notably, we find\nthat even when models are given continuous image features as input, they can\neffectively reconstruct discrete semantic tokens, resulting in stable and\nconsistent improvements across a wide range of multimodal understanding\nbenchmarks. Our approach delivers significant performance gains across varying\ndata scales (556k-2M) and types of LLM bacbones. Specifically, ASVR improves\nLLaVA-1.5 by 5% in average scores across 14 multimodal benchmarks. The code is\navailable at https://github.com/AlenjandroWang/ASVR.",

RAN slicing and the O-RAN paradigm are considered game changers\nin TNs, where the former makes it possible to tailor user services to users\nrequirements, and the latter brings openness and intelligence to the management\nof the RAN. In TNs, bandwidth scarcity requires a dynamic bandwidth slicing\nstrategy. Although this type of strategy ensures efficient bandwidth\nutilization, it compromises RAN slicing isolation in terms of quality of\nservice (QoS) performance. To deal with this challenge, we propose a deep\nreinforcement learning (DRL)-based RAN slicing mechanism that achieves a\ntrade-off between efficient RAN bandwidth sharing and appropriate inter- and\nintra-slice isolation. The proposed mechanism performs bandwidth allocation in\ntwo stages. In the first stage, the bandwidth is allocated to the RAN slices.\nIn the second stage, each slice partitions its bandwidth among its associated\nusers. In both stages, the slicing operation is constrained by several\nconsiderations related to improving the QoS of slices and users that in turn\nfoster inter- and intra-slice isolation. The proposed RAN slicing mechanism is\nbased on DRL algorithms to perform the bandwidth sharing operation in each\nstage. We propose to deploy the mechanism in an O-RAN architecture and describe\nthe O-RAN functional blocks and the main DRL model lifecycle management phases\ninvolved. We also develop three different implementations of the proposed\nmechanism, each based on a different DRL algorithm, and evaluate their\nperformance against multiple baselines across various parameters.",

First, we prove that the quantum algorithm of\nHastings--O'Donnell for $p=1$ still achieves a constant-factor approximation to\nthe ground energy when $p\\geq\\Omega(\\log n/n)$. Additionally, we prove that\nwith high probability, Gaussian states cannot achieve better than a\n$O(\\sqrt{\\log n/pn})$-factor approximation to the true ground state energy of\nsparse SYK. This is done through a general classical circuit complexity\nlower-bound of $\\Omega(pn^3)$ for any quantum state achieving a constant-factor\napproximation. Combined, these show a provable separation between classical\nalgorithms outputting Gaussian states and efficient quantum algorithms for the\ngoal of finding approximate sparse SYK ground states when $p \\geq \\Omega(\\log\nn/n)$, extending the analogous $p=1$ result of Hastings--O'Donnell.",

These foregrounds\ncan introduce mode coupling at small-scales (multipoles $\\ell \\geq 3000$) that\nmimic true lensing signals, thereby complicating analyses such as CMB lensing\nreconstruction. We present a novel approach to learn their full joint\ndistribution using Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) trained on\npaired CIB-tSZ patches at 150 GHz, from the Agora suite of extragalactic sky\nsimulations. While simulations like Agora, which are based on N-body\ncalculations, can take thousands of CPU hours, DDPM can synthesize realistic\nCIB-tSZ patches that faithfully reproduce both auto- and cross-spectral\nstatistics of the 2-point, 3-point, and 4-point correlation functions, in a\nmatter of seconds. We further demonstrate matching pixel-value histograms and\nMinkowski functionals, confirming that conventional non-Gaussian benchmarks are\nalso satisfied. This framework provides a powerful generative tool for\nforward-modeling correlated extragalactic foregrounds in current and future CMB\nanalyses. Although we mainly demonstrate the joint modeling of tSZ and CIB at a\nsingle frequency, we also include examples of its extension to multiple\nfrequencies, showing that the framework can learn the spectral energy\ndistributions (SEDs) across different bands. While establishing DDPMs as a\npromising tool for addressing foreground contamination in next-generation CMB\nsurveys, we also outline remaining challenges to their practical deployment in\nanalysis pipelines, such as scaling to larger sky areas and reliance on the\nunderlying cosmological and astrophysical assumptions in the simulations used\nfor training.",

    "abstract": "Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) often faces GPU memory bottlenecks:\nthe backward pass of first-order optimizers like Adam increases memory usage to\nmore than 10 times the inference level (e.g., 633 GB for OPT-30B). Zeroth-order\n(ZO) optimizers avoid this cost by estimating gradients only from forward\npasses, yet existing methods like MeZO usually require many more steps to\nconverge. Can this trade-off between speed and memory in ZO be fundamentally\nimproved? Normalized-SGD demonstrates strong empirical performance with greater\nmemory efficiency than Adam. In light of this, we introduce FZOO, a Fast\nZeroth-Order Optimizer toward Adam-Scale Speed. FZOO reduces the total forward\npasses needed for convergence by employing batched one-sided estimates that\nadapt step sizes based on the standard deviation of batch losses. It also\naccelerates per-batch computation through the use of Rademacher random vector\nperturbations coupled with CUDA's parallel processing. Extensive experiments on\ndiverse models, including RoBERTa-large, OPT (350M-66B), Phi-2, and Llama3,\nacross 11 tasks validate FZOO's effectiveness. On average, FZOO outperforms\nMeZO by 3 percent in accuracy while requiring 3 times fewer forward passes. For\nRoBERTa-large, FZOO achieves average improvements of 5.6 percent in accuracy\nand an 18 times reduction in forward passes compared to MeZO, achieving\nconvergence speeds comparable to Adam. We also provide theoretical analysis\nproving FZOO's formal equivalence to a normalized-SGD update rule and its\nconvergence guarantees. FZOO integrates smoothly into PEFT techniques, enabling\neven larger memory savings. Overall, our results make single-GPU, high-speed,\nfull-parameter fine-tuning practical and point toward future work on\nmemory-efficient pre-training.",

    "abstract": "The rapid emergence of diverse large language models (LLMs) has spurred the\ndevelopment of LLM routers that assign user queries to the most suitable model.\nHowever, existing LLM routers typically perform a single-round, one-to-one\nmapping (\\textit{i.e.}, assigning each query to a single model in isolation),\nwhich limits their capability to tackle complex tasks that demand the\ncomplementary strengths of multiple LLMs. In this paper, we present\n\\textbf{Router-R1}, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework that\nformulates multi-LLM routing and aggregation as a sequential decision process.\nRouter-R1 instantiates the router itself as a capable LLM, leveraging its\nreasoning ability to interleave \"think\" actions (internal deliberation) with\n\"route\" actions (dynamic model invocation), and integrates each response into\nits evolving context. To facilitate learning, we employ a lightweight\nrule-based reward comprising format rewards, final outcome rewards, and a novel\ncost reward for optimizing the balance between performance and cost, opening a\npathway toward enhancing performance-cost trade-offs via RL. Router-R1 also\nconditions only on simple model descriptors such as pricing, latency, and\nexample performance, enabling strong generalization to unseen model selection.\nExperiments on seven general and multi-hop QA benchmarks show that Router-R1\noutperforms several strong baselines, achieving superior performance while\nmaintaining robust generalization and cost management.",

Stabilizer codes, and in particular topological\nsurface codes, are promising candidates for implementing QEC by redundantly\nencoding quantum information. While it is widely believed that a strictly\nfault-tolerant protocol can only be implemented using single- and two-qubit\ngates, several quantum computing platforms, based on trapped ions, neutral\natoms and also superconducting qubits support native multi-qubit operations,\ne.g. using multi-ion entangling gates, Rydberg blockade or parallelized tunable\ncouplers, respectively. In this work, we show that stabilizer measurement\ncircuits for unrotated surface codes can be fault-tolerant using single\nauxiliary qubits and three-qubit gates. These gates enable lower-depth circuits\nleading to fewer fault locations and potentially shorter QEC cycle times.\nConcretely, we find that in an optimistic parameter regime where fidelities of\nthree-qubit gates are the same as those of two-qubit gates, the logical error\nrate can be up to one order of magnitude lower and the threshold can be\nsignificantly higher, increasing from $\\approx 0.76 \\%$ to $\\approx 1.05 \\%$.\nOur results, which are applicable to a wide range of platforms, thereby\nmotivate further investigation into multi-qubit gates as components for\nfault-tolerant QEC, as they can lead to substantial advantages in terms of time\nand physical qubit resources required to reach a target logical error rate.",

Prominent candidates for QEC are stabilizer\ncodes for which periodic readout of stabilizer operators is typically\nimplemented via successive two-qubit entangling gates, and is repeated many\ntimes during a computation. To improve QEC performance, it is thus beneficial\nto make the stabilizer readout faster and less prone to\nfault-tolerance-breaking errors. Here we design a 3-qubit CZZ gate for\nsuperconducting transmon qubits that maps the parity of two data qubits onto\none measurement qubit in a single step. We find that the gate can be executed\nin a duration of $35\\,$ns with a fidelity of F$=99.96 \\, \\%$. To optimize the\ngate, we use an error model obtained from the microscopic gate simulation to\nsystematically suppress Pauli errors that are particularly harmful to the QEC\nprotocol.

Surprisingly, we find that most existing reasoning\nmodels do not extrapolate well.

Effective OOD detection after deployment could benefit\nfrom access to the training data, enabling direct comparison between test\nsamples and the training data distribution to identify differences.\nState-of-the-art OOD detection methods, however, either discard training data\nafter deployment or assume that test samples and training data are centrally\nstored together, an assumption that rarely holds in real-world settings. This\nis because shipping training data with the deployed model is usually impossible\ndue to the size of training databases, as well as proprietary or privacy\nconstraints.

    "abstract": "Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is a cornerstone approach in computational\npathology (CPath) for generating clinically meaningful slide-level embeddings\nfrom gigapixel tissue images. However, MIL often struggles with small, weakly\nsupervised clinical datasets. In contrast to fields such as NLP and\nconventional computer vision, where transfer learning is widely used to address\ndata scarcity, the transferability of MIL models remains poorly understood. In\nthis study, we systematically evaluate the transfer learning capabilities of\npretrained MIL models by assessing 11 models across 21 pretraining tasks for\nmorphological and molecular subtype prediction. Our results show that\npretrained MIL models, even when trained on different organs than the target\ntask, consistently outperform models trained from scratch. Moreover,\npretraining on pancancer datasets enables strong generalization across organs\nand tasks, outperforming slide foundation models while using substantially less\npretraining data. These findings highlight the robust adaptability of MIL\nmodels and demonstrate the benefits of leveraging transfer learning to boost\nperformance in CPath. Lastly, we provide a resource which standardizes the\nimplementation of MIL models and collection of pretrained model weights on\npopular CPath tasks, available at https://github.com/mahmoodlab/MIL-Lab",

Recent work has increasingly\nutilized large language models (LLMs) to generate test cases, improving the\nquality of test generation by providing better context and correcting errors in\nthe model's output. However, these methods rely on fixed prompts, resulting in\nrelatively low compilation success rates and coverage. This paper presents\nPALM, an approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to enhance the\ngeneration of high-coverage unit tests. PALM performs program analysis to\nidentify branching conditions within functions, which are then combined into\npath constraints. These constraints and relevant contextual information are\nused to construct prompts that guide the LLMs in generating unit tests. We\nimplement the approach and evaluate it in 10 open-source Rust crates.\nExperimental results show that within just two or three hours, PALM can\nsignificantly improves test coverage compared to classic methods, with\nincreases in overall project coverage exceeding 50% in some instances and its\ngenerated tests achieving an average coverage of 75.77%, comparable to human\neffort (71.30%), highlighting the potential of LLMs in automated test\ngeneration.

To address these challenges, we propose CodeBrain, an\nefficient EFM structurally aligned with brain organization, trained in two\nstages.

Unlike fully connected Transformer models, EEGSSM better reflects\nthe brain's small-world topology and efficiently captures EEG's inherent\nmulti-scale structure. EEGSSM is trained with a masked self-supervised learning\nobjective to predict token indices obtained in TFDual-Tokenizer. Comprehensive\nexperiments on 10 public EEG datasets demonstrate the generalizability of\nCodeBrain with linear probing.

High definition (HD) maps offer a promising solution, but\ntheir high maintenance cost poses a significant barrier to scalable deployment.\nThis challenge is addressed by online HD map construction methods, which\ngenerate local HD maps from live sensor data. However, these methods are\ninherently limited by the short perception range of onboard sensors. To\novercome this limitation and improve general performance, recent approaches\nhave explored the use of standard definition (SD) maps as prior, which are\nsignificantly easier to maintain. We propose SDTagNet, the first online HD map\nconstruction method that fully utilizes the information of widely available SD\nmaps, like OpenStreetMap, to enhance far range detection accuracy. Our approach\nintroduces two key innovations. First, in contrast to previous work, we\nincorporate not only polyline SD map data with manually selected classes, but\nadditional semantic information in the form of textual annotations. In this\nway, we enrich SD vector map tokens with NLP-derived features, eliminating the\ndependency on predefined specifications or exhaustive class taxonomies. Second,\nwe introduce a point-level SD map encoder together with orthogonal element\nidentifiers to uniformly integrate all types of map elements. Experiments on\nArgoverse 2 and nuScenes show that this boosts map perception performance by up\nto +5.9 mAP (+45%) w.r.t. map construction without priors and up to +3.2 mAP\n(+20%) w.r.t. previous approaches that already use SD map priors.

Photometric redshifts\nestimated from simulated JWST photometry showed >=95% accuracy and were used in\nSED fitting with CIGALE. We demonstrated that JWST will provide reliable\nstellar mass estimates up to 0.1 dex for the majority of proto-spheroids at\nz>=1.5 and can detect low-mass systems during cosmic noon that were\ninaccessible in the pre-JWST era. Focusing on the active star-forming phase of\nthe proto-spheroid evolution, we defined a sub-sample flux limited at 250\nmicron (DSFG sample) and derived SFR, dust luminosity and dust mass\ncomplementing the JWST photometry with that from Spitzer/MIPS and Herschel. We\nalso constructed a JWST-selected DSFG catalog from ASTRODEEP data using NIRCam\ncolour criteria and demonstrated strong consistency between the observed and\nsimulated DSFG populations.",

We provide surprising evidence that while overall reasoning\ncapabilities increase with model sophistication, the nature of errors\nincreasingly mirrors predictable human reasoning fallacies: a previously\nunobserved inverse scaling phenomenon. To investigate this question, we apply\nthe Erotetic Theory of Reasoning (ETR), a formal cognitive framework with\nempirical support for predicting human reasoning outcomes. Using the\nopen-source package PyETR, we generate logical reasoning problems where humans\npredictably err, evaluating responses from 38 language models across 383\nreasoning tasks.

Notably, as we observe no correlation\nbetween model sophistication and logical correctness on these tasks, this shift\nin error patterns toward human-likeness occurs independently of error rate.\nThese findings challenge the prevailing view that scaling language models\nnaturally obtains normative rationality, suggesting instead a convergence\ntoward human-like cognition inclusive of our characteristic biases and\nlimitations, as we further confirm by demonstrating order-effects in language\nmodel reasoning.",

However, aligning them to avoid\ngenerating content with unacceptable concepts (e.g., offensive or copyrighted\ncontent, or celebrity likenesses) remains a significant challenge. Concept\nreplacement techniques (CRTs) aim to address this challenge, often by trying to\n\"erase\" unacceptable concepts from models. Recently, model providers have\nstarted offering image editing services which accept an image and a text prompt\nas input, to produce an image altered as specified by the prompt. These are\nknown as image-to-image (I2I) models. In this paper, we first use an I2I model\nto empirically demonstrate that today's state-of-the-art CRTs do not in fact\nerase unacceptable concepts. Existing CRTs are thus likely to be ineffective in\nemerging I2I scenarios, despite their proven ability to remove unwanted\nconcepts in T2I pipelines, highlighting the need to understand this discrepancy\nbetween T2I and I2I settings. Next, we argue that a good CRT, while replacing\nunacceptable concepts, should preserve other concepts specified in the inputs\nto generative models. We call this fidelity. Prior work on CRTs have neglected\nfidelity in the case of unacceptable concepts. Finally, we propose the use of\ntargeted image-editing techniques to achieve both effectiveness and fidelity.\nWe present such a technique, AntiMirror, and demonstrate its viability.",

One potential pairing mechanism,\ninvoked in the related re-entrant superconductors UCoGe and URhGe, involves\ntransverse fluctuations of a ferromagnetic order parameter. However, the\nrequisite ferromagnetic order - present in both UCoGe and URhGe - is absent in\nUTe$_{2}$, and magnetization measurements show no sign of strong fluctuations.\nHere, we measure the magnetotropic susceptibility of UTe$_{2}$ across two\nfield-angle planes. This quantity is sensitive to the magnetic susceptibility\nin a direction transverse to the applied magnetic field - a quantity that is\nnot accessed in conventional magnetization measurements. We observe a very\nlarge decrease in the magnetotropic susceptibility over a broad range of field\norientations, indicating a large increase in the transverse magnetic\nsusceptibility. The three superconducting phases of UTe$_{2}$, including the\nhigh-field re-entrant phase, surround this region of enhanced susceptibility in\nthe field-angle phase diagram. The strongest transverse susceptibility is found\nnear the critical end point of the high-field metamagnetic transition,\nsuggesting that quantum critical fluctuations of a field-induced magnetic order\nparameter may be responsible for the large transverse susceptibility, and may\nprovide a pairing mechanism for field-induced superconductivity in UTe$_{2}$.",

In our analysis, we train a set of unconditional image generative\nmodels and adopt a commonly used bias evaluation framework to study bias shift\nbetween training and generated distributions. Our experiments reveal that the\ndetected attribute shifts are small. We find that the attribute shifts are\nsensitive to the attribute classifier used to label generated images in the\nevaluation framework, particularly when its decision boundaries fall in\nhigh-density regions. Our empirical analysis indicates that this classifier\nsensitivity is often observed in attributes values that lie on a spectrum, as\nopposed to exhibiting a binary nature.

The\nframework integrates two core strategies: online learning and\nhistorically-informed safety constraints. To contend with process\ntime-variance, a Recursive Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (rEDMDc)\ntechnique is employed to construct an adaptive Koopman model capable of\nupdating its parameters from real-time data, endowing the controller with the\nability to continuously learn and track dynamic changes. To tackle the critical\nissue of safe operation under model uncertainty, we introduce a novel\nHistorical Process Constraint (HPC) mechanism. This mechanism mines successful\noperational experiences from a historical database and, by coupling them with\nthe confidence level of the online model, generates a dynamic \"safety corridor\"\nfor the MPC optimization problem. This approach transforms implicit expert\nknowledge into explicit, adaptive constraints, establishing a dynamic balance\nbetween pursuing optimal performance and ensuring robust safety. The proposed\nHPC-AK-MPC method is applied to a real-world tobacco loosening and conditioning\nprocess and systematically validated using an \"advisor mode\" simulation\nframework with industrial data. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared\nto historical operations, the proposed method significantly improves the\nProcess Capability Index (Cpk) for key quality variables across all tested\nbatches, proving its substantial potential in enhancing control performance\nwhile guaranteeing operational safety.",

Our findings\nestablish full finetuning as the most practical solution for TabPFNv2 in terms\nof time-efficiency and effectiveness. We then investigate how finetuning alters\nTabPFNv2's inner mechanisms, drawing an analogy to retrieval-augmented models.\nWe reveal that the success of finetuning stems from the fact that after\ngradient-based adaptation, the dot products of the query-representations of\ntest objects and the key-representations of in-context training objects more\naccurately reflect their target similarity. This improved similarity allows\nfinetuned TabPFNv2 to better approximate target dependency by appropriately\nweighting relevant in-context samples, improving the retrieval-based prediction\nlogic. From the practical perspective, we managed to finetune TabPFNv2 on\ndatasets with up to 50K objects, observing performance improvements on almost\nall tasks.

Evaluation on the HumanEval and MBPP benchmarks reveals that AdaDec\nachieves up to a 15.5% improvement in Pass@1 accuracy compared to greedy\ndecoding, matches or outperforms traditional beam search, and reduces both\ncomputational overhead and latency through targeted, selective pausing.

AGENT-NEXUS\nachieves 24% to 40% task success rate improvement for existing mobile agents on\ncompositional operation tasks within the UI-NEXUS benchmark without\nsignificantly sacrificing inference overhead.

    "abstract": "In a previous study, we used JWST to identify three new brown dwarfs in the\ncenter of a nearby star-forming cluster, IC 348. The faintest object had an\nestimated mass of 3-4 $M_{\\rm Jup}$, making it a contender for the least\nmassive brown dwarf confirmed with spectroscopy. Two of the new brown dwarfs\nalso exhibited absorption features from an unidentified aliphatic hydrocarbon,\nwhich were not predicted by atmospheric models and were not previously detected\nin atmospheres outside of the solar system. We have used JWST to perform a\ndeeper survey for brown dwarfs across a larger field in IC 348. We have\nidentified 39 brown dwarf candidates in NIRCam images and have obtained spectra\nfor 15 of them with NIRSpec, nine of which are classified as substellar members\nof the cluster. The faintest new members have mass estimates of $\\sim2$ $M_{\\rm\nJup}$, providing a new constraint on the minimum mass of the IMF. Two new\nmembers ($\\sim2$ and 10 $M_{\\rm Jup}$) exhibit large excess emission from\ncircumstellar disks, demonstrating that they harbor the raw materials for\nplanet formation. Finally, eight of the nine new brown dwarfs and one known\nmember that is newly observed with NIRSpec show the aforementioned hydrocarbon\nfeatures. Among the total of 11 brown dwarfs in IC 348 that have hydrocarbon\ndetections, the features are stronger at fainter magnitudes, indicating that\nthe hydrocarbon is a natural constituent of the atmospheres of the coolest\nnewborn brown dwarfs. We propose a new spectral class \"H\" that is defined by\nthe presence of the 3.4 $\\mu$m fundamental band of the hydrocarbon.",

For a given rank, while LoRA adds parameters\nproportional to the product across modes, MetaTT only adds parameters\nproportional to the sum across modes leading to a significantly compressed\nfinal adapter. Our benchmarks compare MetaTT with LoRA along with recent\nstate-of-the-art matrix and tensor decomposition based fine-tuning schemes. We\nobserve that when tested on standard language modeling benchmarks, MetaTT leads\nto the most reduction in the parameters while maintaining similar accuracy to\nLoRA and even outperforming other tensor-based methods. Unlike CP or other\nrank-factorizations, the TT ansatz benefits from mature optimization routines\n-- e.g., DMRG-style rank adaptive minimization in addition to Adam, which we\nfind simplifies training.

Treating the $S$-matrix in the\nspin-3/2 baryon-baryon scattering as a quantum logic gate in the spin space, we\nstudy the consequence of entanglement suppression and compute the entanglement\npower of the $S$-matrix. When the entanglement power vanishes, the $S$-matrix\nis either an Identity or a SWAP gate and spin-flavor symmetries and/or\nnon-relativistic conformal invariance emerge, as previously observed in\nspin-1/2 baryons. In the case of scattering identical particles, the\nentanglement power never vanishes due to constraints from spin statistics,\nwhich we interpret as projection-valued measurements onto symmetric or\nantisymmetric Hilbert space and define the entanglement power accordingly.

This task remains highly challenging due to (1) the limited\nsupervision provided by the incompletely annotated training data, and (2) the\ndifficulty of distinguishing concealed objects from the background, which\narises from the intrinsic similarities in concealed scenarios. In this paper,\nwe introduce the first unified method for ISCOS to address these challenges. To\ntackle the issue of incomplete supervision, we propose a unified mean-teacher\nframework, SEE, that leverages the vision foundation model, ``\\emph{Segment\nAnything Model (SAM)}'', to generate pseudo-labels using coarse masks produced\nby the teacher model as prompts. To mitigate the effect of low-quality\nsegmentation masks, we introduce a series of strategies for pseudo-label\ngeneration, storage, and supervision. These strategies aim to produce\ninformative pseudo-labels, store the best pseudo-labels generated, and select\nthe most reliable components to guide the student model, thereby ensuring\nrobust network training. Additionally, to tackle the issue of intrinsic\nsimilarity, we design a hybrid-granularity feature grouping module that groups\nfeatures at different granularities and aggregates these results. By clustering\nsimilar features, this module promotes segmentation coherence, facilitating\nmore complete segmentation for both single-object and multiple-object images.\nWe validate the effectiveness of our approach across multiple ISCOS tasks, and\nexperimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance.

Where support is absent, standard estimators remain\ncomputable but cease to identify meaningful causal parameters. A general\nsensitivity framework is developed, indexing identified sets by curvature\nconstraints on the selection mechanism. This yields a structural selection\nfrontier tracing the trade-off between assumption strength and inferential\nprecision. Two diagnostic statistics are introduced: the minimum assumption\nstrength for sign identification (MAS-SI), and a fragility index that\nquantifies the minimal deviation from ignorability required to overturn\nqualitative conclusions. Applied to the LaLonde (1986) dataset, the framework\nreveals that nearly half the treated strata lack empirical support, rendering\nthe ATT undefined in those regions.

Further, we aim to tackle the rate-limit constraint,\nrepresented through the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, by employing the\ndensity ratio trick alongside the implicit optimal prior method (IoPm). By\napplying the IoPm to our multi-task processing framework, we propose a hybrid\nlearning approach that combines deep neural networks with kernelized-parametric\nmachine learning methods, enabling a robust solution for the CMT-SemCom. Our\nframework is grounded in information-theoretic principles and employs\nvariational approximations to bridge theoretical foundations with practical\nimplementations.

On the\nother hand, the Transformer-based models for time series forecasting struggle\nto effectively model long sequences and intricate dynamic relationships due to\ntheir high computational complexity. To overcome these limitations, we\nintroduce KARMA, with an Adaptive Time Channel Decomposition module (ATCD) to\ndynamically extract trend and seasonal components.

This issue is particularly severe in cases\nof knowledge conflict, where the retrieved context conflicts with the model`s\nparametric knowledge. While existing faithful RAG approaches enforce strict\ncontext adherence through well-designed prompts or modified decoding\nstrategies, our analysis reveals a critical limitation: they achieve\nfaithfulness by forcibly suppressing the model`s parametric knowledge, which\nundermines the model`s internal knowledge structure and increases the risk of\nmisinterpreting the context. To this end, this paper proposes FaithfulRAG, a\nnovel framework that resolves knowledge conflicts by explicitly modeling\ndiscrepancies between the model`s parametric knowledge and retrieved context.\nSpecifically, FaithfulRAG identifies conflicting knowledge at the fact level\nand designs a self-thinking process, allowing LLMs to reason about and\nintegrate conflicting facts before generating responses.

For dealing with the implicitness introduced\nin the diffusion term, we propose a framework to derive the asymptotic error\ndistribution of diffusion-implicit or fully implicit numerical methods, which\nenables us to construct a fully explicit numerical method sharing the same\nasymptotic error distribution as the SRK method. Further, we show that the\nlimit distribution $U(T)$ satisfies $\\mathbf E|U(T)|^2\\le\ne^{L_1T}(1+\\eta_1)T^3$ for some $\\eta_1\\ge0$ only depending on the coefficients\nof the SRK method. Thus, we infer that $\\eta_1$ is the key parameter reflecting\nthe growth rate of the mean-square error of the SRK method. Especially, among\nthe SRK methods of strong order $1$, those of weak order $2$ correspond to\n$\\eta_1=0$, sharing the unified asymptotic error distribution, and have the\nsmallest mean-square errors after a long time. This property is also found for\nthe case of additive noise.

    "abstract": "Humanoid teleoperation plays a vital role in demonstrating and collecting\ndata for complex humanoid-scene interactions. However, current teleoperation\nsystems face critical limitations: they decouple upper- and lower-body control\nto maintain stability, restricting natural coordination, and operate open-loop\nwithout real-time position feedback, leading to accumulated drift. The\nfundamental challenge is achieving precise, coordinated whole-body\nteleoperation over extended durations while maintaining accurate global\npositioning. Here we show that an MoE-based teleoperation system, CLONE, with\nclosed-loop error correction enables unprecedented whole-body teleoperation\nfidelity, maintaining minimal positional drift over long-range trajectories\nusing only head and hand tracking from an MR headset. Unlike previous methods\nthat either sacrifice coordination for stability or suffer from unbounded\ndrift, CLONE learns diverse motion skills while preventing tracking error\naccumulation through real-time feedback, enabling complex coordinated movements\nsuch as ``picking up objects from the ground.'' These results establish a new\nmilestone for whole-body humanoid teleoperation for long-horizon humanoid-scene\ninteraction tasks.",

    "abstract": "Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) have emerged as a transformative\ntechnology for electromagnetic (EM) wave manipulation, offering unprecedented\ncontrol over wave reflections compared to traditional metallic reflectors. By\nutilizing an array of tunable elements, RIS can steer and shape electromagnetic\nwaves to enhance signal quality in wireless communication and radar systems.\nHowever, practical implementations face significant challenges due to hardware\nlimitations and phase quantization errors. In this work, a 1-bit RIS prototype\noperating at 28 GHz is developed to experimentally evaluate the impact of\nhardware constraints on RIS performance. Unlike conventional studies that model\nRIS as an ideal phase-shift matrix, this study accounts for physical parameters\nthat influence the actual reflection pattern. In particular, the presence of\nspecular reflection due to hardware limitations is investigated. Additionally,\nthe effects of phase quantization errors, which stem from the discrete nature\nof RIS elements, are analyzed, and a genetic algorithm (GA)-based optimization\nis introduced to mitigate these errors. The proposed optimization strategy\neffectively reduces gain degradation at the desired angle caused by 1-bit\nquantization, enhancing the overall performance of RIS. The effectiveness of\nthe approach is validated through measurements, underscoring the importance of\nadvanced phase control techniques in improving the functionality of RIS.",

To analyze this, we decompose the total entanglement of anyonic\nstates into two components: one from the tensor product structure and the other\nrepresenting residual contributions. By studying their asymptotic behavior, we\nfind that the former gradually increases and approaches the AEE while the\nlatter diminishes with the number of copies.

    "abstract": "Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) for Natural Language Processing\n(NLP) is the predominant AI technology to date. An important perspective for\nQuantum Computing (QC) is the question whether QC has the potential to reduce\nthe vast resource requirements for training and operating GenAI models. While\nlarge-scale generative NLP tasks are currently out of reach for practical\nquantum computers, the generation of short semantic structures such as\npasswords is not. Generating passwords that mimic real user behavior has many\napplications, for example to test an authentication system against realistic\nthreat models. Classical password generation via deep learning have recently\nbeen investigated with significant progress in their ability to generate novel,\nrealistic password candidates. In the present work we investigate the utility\nof adiabatic quantum computers for this task. More precisely, we study\ndifferent encodings of token strings and propose novel approaches based on the\nQuadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) and the Unit-Disk Maximum\nIndependent Set (UD-MIS) problems. Our approach allows us to estimate the token\ndistribution from data and adiabatically prepare a quantum state from which we\neventually sample the generated passwords via measurements. Our results show\nthat relatively small samples of 128 passwords, generated on the QuEra Aquila\n256-qubit neutral atom quantum computer, contain human-like passwords such as\n\"Tunas200992\" or \"teedem28iglove\".",

Equation learning (EQL) methods can derive\ncontinuum models from ABM data, but they typically require extensive\nsimulations for each parameter set, raising concerns about generalizability. In\nthis work, we extend EQL to Multi-experiment equation learning (ME-EQL) by\nintroducing two methods: one-at-a-time ME-EQL (OAT ME-EQL), which learns\nindividual models for each parameter set and connects them via interpolation,\nand embedded structure ME-EQL (ES ME-EQL), which builds a unified model library\nacross parameters. We demonstrate these methods using a birth--death mean-field\nmodel and an on-lattice agent-based model of birth, death, and migration with\nspatial structure. Our results show that both methods significantly reduce the\nrelative error in recovering parameters from agent-based simulations, with OAT\nME-EQL offering better generalizability across parameter space. Our findings\nhighlight the potential of equation learning from multiple experiments to\nenhance the generalizability and interpretability of learned models for complex\nbiological systems.",

At the same time, many image-level object-centric tasks require\nidentifying relevant regions, often requiring context. To address this\nconundrum, we propose a two-stage framework: stage 1 processes the full image\nto discover object parts and identify task-relevant regions, while stage 2\nleverages input attention masking to restrict its receptive field to these\nregions, enabling a focused analysis while filtering out potentially spurious\ninformation. Both stages are trained jointly, allowing stage 2 to refine stage\n1.

    "abstract": "Recent studies on Visual Autoregressive (VAR) models have highlighted that\nhigh-frequency components, or later steps, in the generation process contribute\ndisproportionately to inference latency. However, the underlying computational\nredundancy involved in these steps has yet to be thoroughly investigated. In\nthis paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the VAR inference process and\nidentify two primary sources of inefficiency: step redundancy and unconditional\nbranch redundancy. To address step redundancy, we propose an automatic\nstep-skipping strategy that selectively omits unnecessary generation steps to\nimprove efficiency. For unconditional branch redundancy, we observe that the\ninformation gap between the conditional and unconditional branches is minimal.\nLeveraging this insight, we introduce unconditional branch replacement, a\ntechnique that bypasses the unconditional branch to reduce computational cost.\nNotably, we observe that the effectiveness of acceleration strategies varies\nsignificantly across different samples. Motivated by this, we propose SkipVAR,\na sample-adaptive framework that leverages frequency information to dynamically\nselect the most suitable acceleration strategy for each instance. To evaluate\nthe role of high-frequency information, we introduce high-variation benchmark\ndatasets that test model sensitivity to fine details. Extensive experiments\nshow SkipVAR achieves over 0.88 average SSIM with up to 1.81x overall\nacceleration and 2.62x speedup on the GenEval benchmark, maintaining model\nquality. These results confirm the effectiveness of frequency-aware,\ntraining-free adaptive acceleration for scalable autoregressive image\ngeneration.

    "abstract": "Large-scale pre-training has fundamentally changed how machine learning\nresearch is done today: large foundation models are trained once, and then can\nbe used by anyone in the community (including those without data or compute\nresources to train a model from scratch) to adapt and fine-tune to specific\ntasks. Applying this same framework to reinforcement learning (RL) is appealing\nbecause it offers compelling avenues for addressing core challenges in RL,\nincluding sample efficiency and robustness. However, there remains a\nfundamental challenge to pre-train large models in the context of RL: actions\nhave long-term dependencies, so training a foundation model that reasons across\ntime is important. Recent advances in generative AI have provided new tools for\nmodeling highly complex distributions. In this paper, we build a probabilistic\nmodel to predict which states an agent will visit in the temporally distant\nfuture (i.e., an occupancy measure) using flow matching. As large datasets are\noften constructed by many distinct users performing distinct tasks, we include\nin our model a latent variable capturing the user intention. This intention\nincreases the expressivity of our model, and enables adaptation with\ngeneralized policy improvement. We call our proposed method\nintention-conditioned flow occupancy models (InFOM). Comparing with alternative\nmethods for pre-training, our experiments on $36$ state-based and $4$\nimage-based benchmark tasks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves $1.8\n\\times$ median improvement in returns and increases success rates by $36\\%$.\nWebsite: https://chongyi-zheng.github.io/infom Code:\nhttps://github.com/chongyi-zheng/infom",

    "abstract": "In type-I superconductors, zero electrical resistivity and perfect\ndiamagnetism define two fundamental criteria for superconducting behavior. In\ncontrast, type-II superconductors exhibit more complex mixed-state physics,\nwhere magnetic flux penetrates the material above the lower critical field Hc1\nin the form of quantized vortices, each carrying a single flux quantum. These\nvortices form a two-dimensional lattice which persists up to another\nirreversible field (Hirr) and then melts into a dissipative liquid phase. The\nvortex lattice is fundamental to the magnetic and electrical properties of\ntype-II superconductors, a third definitive criterion-beyond resistivity and\nmagnetization-for identifying this phase has remained elusive. Here, we report\nthe discovery of a dynamic magnetostrictive effect, wherein the geometry of the\nsuperconductor oscillates only under an applied alternating magnetic field due\nto the disturbance of the vortex lattice. This effect is detected by a thin\npiezoelectric transducer, which converts the excited geometric deformation into\nan in-phase ac voltage. Notably, we find a direct and nearly linear\nrelationship between the signal amplitude and the vortex density in lattice\nacross several representative type-II superconductors. In the vortex liquid\nphase above Hirr, the signal amplitude rapidly decays to zero near the upper\ncritical field (Hc2), accompanied by a pronounced out-of-phase component due to\nenhanced dissipation. This dynamic magnetostrictive effect not only reveals an\nunexplored magnetoelastic property of the vortex lattice but also establishes a\nfundamental criterion for identifying the type-II superconductors.",

Two control designs, energy-based feedback linearizing\ncontrol (FBLC) and sliding mode control (SMC), are proven to achieve asymptotic\nconvergence to reference outputs. The approach is validated on two systems: an\ninverter-controlled RLC circuit and a synchronous generator connected to a\nload. In both cases, energy-based control improves transient response and\nreduces control effort.",

Under a\nnatural condition ensuring that the domain is a poset, the map is a contraction\nof preordered sets. We apply this to lattices of regions of simplicial\nhyperplane arrangements, where the preorders are partial orders, in particular\nto finite Coxeter arrangements. For the latter, each choice of Coxeter element\ngives us a different partial order on the set of equivalence classes of maximal\nchains; these generalise certain reoriented higher Bruhat orders in dimension\ntwo. The maps of posets of maximal chains induced by Cambrian congruences\ngeneralise the map of Kapranov and Voevodsky from the higher Bruhat orders to\nthe higher Stasheff--Tamari orders in dimension two. While the fibres of this\nmap are known not always to be intervals, our results show that they are always\nconnected. We show that, in the case of Cambrian lattices, the induced maps on\nmaximal chains have nice descriptions in terms of orientations of rank-two root\nsubsystems, in a way which resembles taking the stable objects of a Rudakov\nstability condition.

Existing characterizations of\ncompute-optimality that consider model size, dataset size, and inference tokens\nin isolation or in fixed combinations risk overlooking more efficient operating\npoints. We introduce directed stochastic skill search (DS3), a general\nframework that represents inference as stochastic traversal over a learned\nskill graph.

To that end, we extend a prior first-principles tripartite\ngraph framework of LLM training to incorporate inference, and separately bridge\nDS3 with empirical methods that characterize LLM scaling behavior. We\ntheoretically recover empirically observed patterns, including: linear accuracy\nscaling with logarithmic compute; variation in preferred inference strategies\nas a function of task difficulty and model capability; emergent behavior\nelicited by reasoning even when performance plateaus under parameter scaling;\nand both best-of-N (BoN) and majority voting behavior captured within a unified\nanalytical framework.

Moreover, the exponential\ngrowth of the search space, presence of multiple objectives and parameters, and\nhighly dynamic nature of edge computing environments further exacerbate the\ncomplexity of task scheduling. As a result, schedulers based on heuristic and\nmetaheuristic algorithms frequently encounter difficulties in generating\noptimal or near-optimal task schedules due to their constrained ability to\nadapt to the dynamic conditions and complex environmental characteristics of\nedge computing. Accordingly, reinforcement learning algorithms have been\nincorporated into schedulers to address the complexity and dynamic conditions\ninherent in task scheduling in edge computing. However, a significant\nlimitation of reinforcement learning algorithms is the prolonged learning time\nrequired to adapt to new environments and to address medium- and large-scale\nproblems. This challenge arises from the extensive global action space and\nfrequent random exploration of irrelevant actions. Therefore, this study\nproposes Agile Reinforcement learning (aRL), in which the RL-agent performs\ninformed exploration and executes only relevant actions. Consequently, the\npredictability of the RL-agent is enhanced, leading to rapid adaptation and\nconvergence, which positions aRL as a suitable candidate for scheduling the\ntasks of soft real-time applications in edge computing.

    "abstract": "Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has transformed daily tasks from video\ntranscription to workplace hiring. ASR systems' growing use warrants robust and\nstandardized auditing approaches to ensure automated transcriptions of high and\nequitable quality. This is especially critical for people with speech and\nlanguage disorders (such as aphasia) who may disproportionately depend on ASR\nsystems to navigate everyday life. In this work, we identify three pitfalls in\nexisting standard ASR auditing procedures, and demonstrate how addressing them\nimpacts audit results via a case study of six popular ASR systems' performance\nfor aphasia speakers. First, audits often adhere to a single method of text\nstandardization during data pre-processing, which (a) masks variability in ASR\nperformance from applying different standardization methods, and (b) may not be\nconsistent with how users - especially those from marginalized speech\ncommunities - would want their transcriptions to be standardized. Second,\naudits often display high-level demographic findings without further\nconsidering performance disparities among (a) more nuanced demographic\nsubgroups, and (b) relevant covariates capturing acoustic information from the\ninput audio. Third, audits often rely on a single gold-standard metric -- the\nWord Error Rate -- which does not fully capture the extent of errors arising\nfrom generative AI models, such as transcription hallucinations. We propose a\nmore holistic auditing framework that accounts for these three pitfalls, and\nexemplify its results in our case study, finding consistently worse ASR\nperformance for aphasia speakers relative to a control group. We call on\npractitioners to implement these robust ASR auditing practices that remain\nflexible to the rapidly changing ASR landscape.",

Microstructural features such as grain boundaries (GBs),\nsubgrains, localized deformation bands, and non-uniform dislocation\ndistributions critically influence grain nucleation and growth during\nrecrystallization. Traditionally, modeling this coupled evolution involves\nseparate, specialized frameworks for mechanical deformation and microstructural\nkinetics, typically used in a staggered manner. Nucleation is often introduced\nad hoc, with nuclei seeded at predefined sites based on criteria like critical\ndislocation density, stress or strain. This is a consequence of the inherent\nlimitations of the staggered approach, where newly formed GBs or grains have to\nbe incorporated with additional processing. In this work, we propose a unified,\nthermodynamically consistent field theory that enables spontaneous nucleation\ndriven by stored dislocations at GBs. The model integrates Cosserat crystal\nplasticity with the Henry-Mellenthin-Plapp orientation phase field approach,\nallowing the simulation of key microstructural defects, as well as curvature-\nand stored energy-driven grain boundary migration. The unified approach enables\nseamless identification of GBs that emerge from deformation and nucleation.\nNucleation is activated through a coupling function that links\ndislocation-related free energy contributions to the phase field. Dislocation\nrecovery occurs both at newly formed nuclei and behind migrating GBs. The\nmodel's capabilities are demonstrated using periodic bicrystal and polycrystal\nsimulations, where mechanisms such as strain-induced boundary migration,\nsubgrain growth, and coalescence are captured. The proposed spontaneous\nnucleation mechanism offers a novel addition to the capabilities of phase field\nmodels for recrystallization simulation.",

To\novercome these challenges, we introduce the STI-SNN accelerator, designed for\nresource-constrained applications with high energy efficiency, flexibility, and\nlow latency. The accelerator is designed through algorithm and hardware\nco-design. Firstly, STI-SNN can perform inference in a single timestep.

This approach alleviates spike\ndisappearance during timestep reduction, maintains inference accuracy, and\nexpands TET's application. In hardware design, we analyze data access patterns\nand adopt the output stationary (OS) dataflow, eliminating the need to store\nmembrane potentials and access memory operations. Furthermore, based on the OS\ndataflow, we propose a compressed and sorted representation of spikes, then\ncached in the line buffer to reduce the memory access cost and improve reuse\nefficiency. Secondly, STI-SNN supports different convolution methods. By\nadjusting the computation mode of processing elements (PEs) and parameterizing\nthe computation array, STI-SNN can accommodate lightweight models based on\ndepthwise separable convolutions (DSCs), further enhancing hardware\nflexibility.

    "abstract": "The evolution of warped disks is governed by internal, oscillatory shear\nflows driven by their distorted geometry. However, these flows are known to be\nvigorously unstable to a hydrodynamic parametric instability. In many warped\nsystems, this might coexist and compete with the magnetorotational instability\n(MRI). The interplay of these phenomena and their combined impact on the\ninternal flows has not been studied. To this end, we perform three-dimensional,\nmagnetohydrodynamic unstratified shearing box simulations with an oscillatory\nradial forcing function to mimic the effects of a warped disk. In the\nhydrodynamic study, we find that the parametric instability manifests as\nstrong, vertical `elevator' flows that resist the sloshing motion. Above a\ncritical forcing amplitude, these also emerge in our magnetized runs and\ndominate the vertical stress, although they are partially weakened by the MRI,\nand hence the system equilibrates with larger radial sloshing flows. Below this\ncritical forcing, the MRI effectively quenches the parametric instability. In\nall cases, we find that the internal stresses are anisotropic in character and\nbetter described by a viscoelastic relationship with the shearing flows.\nUnfortunately, these important effects are typically unresolved in global\nsimulations of warped disks and are simplified in analytically tractable\nmodels. The incorporation of such complex, warp-amplitude-dependent,\nviscoelastic stresses will sensitively regulate the laminar flow response and\ninevitably modify the detailed spatio-temporal evolution of warped systems.",

In this work, we present the first study to systematically\nquantify the alignment of T2I models and evaluation metrics with respect to\nboth explicit (stated) as well as implicit (unstated, implied by the prompt's\ncultural context) cultural expectations. To this end, we introduce\nCulturalFrames, a novel benchmark designed for rigorous human evaluation of\ncultural representation in visual generations. Spanning 10 countries and 5\nsocio-cultural domains, CulturalFrames comprises 983 prompts, 3637\ncorresponding images generated by 4 state-of-the-art T2I models, and over 10k\ndetailed human annotations. We find that across models and countries, cultural\nexpectations are missed an average of 44% of the time. Among these failures,\nexplicit expectations are missed at a surprisingly high average rate of 68%,\nwhile implicit expectation failures are also significant, averaging 49%.\nFurthermore, we show that existing T2I evaluation metrics correlate poorly with\nhuman judgments of cultural alignment, irrespective of their internal\nreasoning. Collectively, our findings expose critical gaps, provide a concrete\ntestbed, and outline actionable directions for developing culturally informed\nT2I models and metrics that improve global usability.",

    ],
    "abstract": "An embedding $\\phi:V \\rightarrow S^n$ of a compact, connected manifold $V$\ninto the unit sphere $S^n \\subset {\\bf R}^{n+1}$ is said to be taut, if every\nnondegenerate spherical distance function $d_p$, $p \\in S^n$, is a perfect\nMorse function on $V$, i.e., it has the minimum number of critical points on\n$V$ required by the Morse inequalities. In these notes, we give an exposition\nof the proof of the invariance of tautness under Lie sphere transformations due\nto \\'{A}lvarez Paiva. First we extend the definition of tautness of\nsubmanifolds of $S^n$ to the concept of Lie-tautness of Legendre submanifolds\nof the contact manifold $\\Lambda^{2n-1}$ of projective lines on the Lie quadric\n$Q^{n+1}$. This definition has the property that if $\\phi:V \\rightarrow S^n$ is\nan embedding of a compact, connected manifold $V$, then $\\phi(V)$ is a taut\nsubmanifold in $S^n$ if and only if the Legendre lift $\\lambda$ of $\\phi$ is\nLie-taut. Furthermore, Lie-tautness is invariant under the action of Lie sphere\ntransformations on Legendre submanifolds. As a consequence, we get that if\n$\\phi:V \\rightarrow S^n$ and $\\psi:V \\rightarrow S^n$ are two embeddings of a\ncompact, connected manifold $V$ into $S^n$, such that their corresponding\nLegendre lifts are related by a Lie sphere transformation, then $\\phi$ is a\ntaut embedding if and only if $\\psi$ is a taut embedding. Thus, in that sense,\ntautness is invariant under Lie sphere transformations. The key idea is to\nformulate tautness in terms of real-valued functions on $S^n$ whose level sets\nform a parabolic pencil of unoriented spheres in $S^n$, and then show that this\nis equivalent to the usual formulation of tautness in terms of spherical\ndistance functions, whose level sets in $S^n$ form a pencil of unoriented\nconcentric spheres.",

Instead of calculating the CMB temperature around\nindividual galaxies as in previous works, we analyze mean CMB temperature\nprofiles associated to cosmic filaments in three dimensions. We have considered\ndifferent thresholds in the linear K-band luminosity density of the filaments\nas a proxy to mass density. Furthermore, we have analyzed the dependence of the\nresults on the average orientation of filaments with respect to the line of\nsight. These studies were implemented to test the expected dependence on mass\ndensity as well as on photon trajectory length within the cosmic filaments. We\nfind a $3-4\\sigma$ detection of a temperature decrement trend towards the spine\nof the filaments, the larger the mass and the more radially oriented the\nfilament, the stronger the temperature decrement. This trend is seen\nindependently in both redshift ranges $0.004<z<0.02$ and $0.02<z<0.04$. We\ntherefore conclude that our results provide strong evidence for a lower CMB\ntemperature along massive cosmic filaments in the nearby universe $z<0.04$.",

Extracting entities such as\npercentages of physical and/or psychological disability and the involved\ncompensation amounts is a challenging process, even for experts, due to the\nsubtle arguments and reasoning in the court decision. A two-step procedure is\nproposed: first, segmenting the document identifying the most relevant\nsegments, and then extracting the entities. For text segmentation, two\nmethodologies are compared: a classic method based on regular expressions and a\nsecond approach that divides the document into blocks of n-tokens, which are\nthen vectorized using multilingual models for semantic searches\n(text-embedding-ada-002/MiniLM-L12-v2 ).

    "abstract": "A novel solution is presented for the problem of estimating the backgrounds\nof a signal search using observed data while simultaneously maximizing the\nsensitivity of the search to the signal. The ``ABCD method'' provides a\nreliable framework for background estimation by partitioning events into one\nsignal-enhanced region (A) and three background-enhanced control regions (B, C,\nand D) via two statistically independent variables. In practice, even slight\ncorrelations between the two variables can significantly undermine the method's\nperformance. Thus, choosing appropriate variables by hand can present a\nformidable challenge, especially when background and signal differ only subtly.\nTo address this issue, the ABCD with distance correlation (ABCDisCo) method was\ndeveloped to construct two artificial variables from the output scores of a\nneural network trained to maximize signal-background discrimination while\nminimizing correlations using the distance correlation measure. However,\nrelying solely on minimizing the distance correlation can yield undesirable\ncharacteristics in the resulting distributions, which may compromise the\nvalidity of the background prediction obtained using this method. The ABCDisCo\ntraining enhanced with closure (ABCDisCoTEC) method is introduced to solve this\nissue by directly minimizing the nonclosure, expressed as a dedicated\ndifferentiable loss term. This extended method is applied to a data set of\nproton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV recorded by the\nCMS detector at the CERN LHC. Additionally, given the complexity of the\nminimization problem with constraints on multiple loss terms, the modified\ndifferential method of multipliers is applied and shown to greatly improve the\nstability and robustness of the ABCDisCoTEC method, compared to grid search\nhyperparameter optimization procedures.",

However, the high inference cost of multi-step sampling limits\ntheir applicability in real-time robotic systems. To address this issue,\nexisting approaches accelerate the sampling process in generative\nmodeling-based visuomotor policies by adapting acceleration techniques\noriginally developed for image generation. Despite this progress, a major\ndistinction remains: image generation typically involves producing independent\nsamples without temporal dependencies, whereas robotic manipulation involves\ngenerating time-series action trajectories that require continuity and temporal\ncoherence. To effectively exploit temporal information in robotic manipulation,\nwe propose FreqPolicy, a novel approach that first imposes frequency\nconsistency constraints on flow-based visuomotor policies. Our work enables the\naction model to capture temporal structure effectively while supporting\nefficient, high-quality one-step action generation. We introduce a frequency\nconsistency constraint that enforces alignment of frequency-domain action\nfeatures across different timesteps along the flow, thereby promoting\nconvergence of one-step action generation toward the target distribution. In\naddition, we design an adaptive consistency loss to capture structural temporal\nvariations inherent in robotic manipulation tasks. We assess FreqPolicy on 53\ntasks across 3 simulation benchmarks, proving its superiority over existing\none-step action generators. We further integrate FreqPolicy into the\nvision-language-action (VLA) model and achieve acceleration without performance\ndegradation on the 40 tasks of Libero.

This different appearance could be the result of distortion of the\ninternal magnetic structure, merging with other structures, or simply\nprojection effects. These factors complicate the interpretation of CMEs. This\ncomplexity is exemplified by a CME observed on 28 March 2022. The event\noriginated from a single eruption, evolving as a textbook CME in the low corona\nbut appearing as a complex two-MFR structure in white-light observations. Why?\nTo answer this question, we performed a multi-view data and modeling analysis\nto describe the CME coronal evolution. The thermodynamic MHD model, CORHEL-CME,\nhelps reveal the magnetic configuration of this CME and also reveals that the\nambient field plays a crucial role in shaping the complex structure of the CME\nduring early evolution.

    "abstract": "The integration of collaborative robots (cobots) in industrial settings\nraises concerns about worker well-being, particularly due to reduced social\ninteractions. Avatars - designed to facilitate worker interactions and\nengagement - are promising solutions to enhance the human-robot collaboration\n(HRC) experience. However, real-world perspectives on avatar-supported HRC\nremain unexplored. To address this gap, we conducted a focus group study with\nemployees from a German manufacturing company that uses cobots. Before the\ndiscussion, participants engaged with a scripted, industry-like HRC demo in a\nlab setting. This qualitative approach provided valuable insights into the\navatar's potential roles, improvements to its behavior, and practical\nconsiderations for deploying them in industrial workcells. Our findings also\nemphasize the importance of personalized communication and task assistance.\nAlthough our study's limitations restrict its generalizability, it serves as an\ninitial step in recognizing the potential of adaptive, context-aware avatar\ninteractions in real-world industrial environments.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in muonic x-ray experiments have reinvigorated efforts in\nmeasurements of absolute nuclear charge radii. Here, a modern approach is\npresented, and demonstrated through determination of the charge radii of the\ntwo stable chlorine nuclides $^{35}$Cl and $^{37}$Cl. Knowledge of these radii\nhas implications for fundamental studies in nuclear and atomic physics. For\nthis purpose, a state-of-the-art experiment was performed at the $\\pi$E1\nbeamline in the Paul Scherrer Institute (Switzerland), using a large-scale HPGe\ndetector array in order to extract precise energies of the muonic $^{35}$Cl and\n$^{37}$Cl $np1s$ transitions. The nuclear charge radius extraction relies on\nmodern calculations for QED effects and nuclear polarization with rigorous\nuncertainty quantification, including effects that were not accounted for in\nolder studies. Additionally, we established a new method for applying the\nnuclear shape correction directly from energy density functionals, which are\namenable to isotopes for which no high-quality electron scattering experiments\nare available. The resulting charge radii are $3.3335(23) fm$ for $^{35}$Cl and\n$3.3445(23) fm$ for $^{37}$Cl, thus improving the uncertainty of the available\nelectron scattering values by a factor of seven. The correlation of several\nobservables was evaluated between the different isotopes in order to produce a\nmore precise value of the differential mean square charge radius $\\delta\n\\langle r^2 \\rangle^{37, 35}=+0.0771(66) fm^{2}$. In this case, improvement of\nthe uncertainty by more than one order of magnitude was achieved compared to\nthe literature value. This precision is sufficient to use this differential as\ninput for isotope shift factor determination.",

AGN are believed to play important\nroles in the evolution of both supermassive black holes and their host galaxies\nover cosmic time. AGN and the nuclear star clusters (NSCs) that interact with\nthem remain unresolved with present and planned telescopes. As a result, the\nproperties of AGN and NSCs are highly uncertain. Here we review how binary\nblack hole (BBH) mergers can occur in AGN disks and how both the gravitational\nwave (GW) and electromagnetic wave (EM) properties of such mergers allow us to\nreverse-engineer the properties of AGN disks and NSCs over cosmic time. We\npoint out that the feature in the BBH mass spectrum around $\\sim 35M_{\\odot}$\nis an excellent probe of hierarchical merger models. Likewise constraints on\nthe spins of upper-mass gap BH ($\\gtrsim 50M_{\\odot}$) test the AGN channel.\nThe effective spin ($\\chi_{\\rm eff}$) distribution, including asymmetry,\nislands of structure and magnitudes are excellent tests of AGN model\npredictions. We also argue, that the rate of AGN-driven BBH mergers as a\nfunction of redshift should scale slightly shallower than the AGN number\ndensity, at least out to redshifts of $\\sim 2$, and should turnover at the same\nredshift as the AGN number density. Finally, we emphasize a determination of an\nAGN fraction of observed BBH mergers ($f_{\\rm BBH,AGN}$), \\emph{regardless of\nthe actual value}, allows us to infer the average properties of AGN disks and\nNSCs out to high redshift.",

To\ndemonstrate the viability of BLTP electrodynamics, we consider the BLTP\nanalogue of the radiation reaction of a classical point charge accelerated from\nrest by a static homogeneous capacitor plate field, and calculate it up to\n$O(\\varkappa^4)$ in a formal expansion about $\\varkappa=0$ in powers of\n$\\varkappa$, Bopp's reciprocal length, a new electrodynamics parameter\nintroduced by BLTP theory.

In\nthis article a crucial question regarding this ``small-$\\varkappa$'' expansion,\nraised by Carley and Kiessling, is answered as follows: The motions computed\nwith terms $O(\\varkappa^3)$ included are mathematically accurate approximations\nto {physically reasonable} solutions of the actual BLTP initial value problem\nfor short times $t$, viz. when $\\varkappa c t \\ll 1$, where $c$ is the speed of\nlight in vacuo, but their unphysical behavior over {much} longer times does not\naccurately approximate the actual BLTP solutions even when the dimensionless\nparameter $\\varkappa e^2 / |m_b| c^2 \\ll 1$, where $e$ is the elementary charge\nand $m_b$ the bare rest mass of the electron. This has the important\nimplication that BLTP electrodynamics remains a viable contender for an\naccurate classical electrodynamics with point charges that does not suffer from\nthe infinite self-interaction problems of textbook Lorentz electrodynamics with\npoint charges.",

Although a straight-line\nconnection between the noisy and natural data distributions is intuitive, fast,\nand easy to optimize, it still inevitably leads to: 1) Diversity concerns,\nwhich arise since straight-line paths only cover a fairly restricted sampling\nspace. 2) Multi-scale noise modeling concerns, since the straight line flow\nonly needs to optimize the constant velocity field $\\bm v$ between the two\ndistributions $\\bm\\pi_0$ and $\\bm\\pi_1$. In this work, we present\nDiscretized-RF, a new family of rectified flow (also called momentum flow\nmodels since they refer to the previous velocity component and the random\nvelocity component in each diffusion step), which discretizes the straight path\ninto a series of variable velocity field sub-paths (namely ``momentum fields'')\nto expand the search space, especially when close to the distribution\n$p_\\text{noise}$. Different from the previous case where noise is directly\nsuperimposed on $\\bm x$, we introduce noise on the velocity $\\bm v$ of the\nsub-path to change its direction in order to improve the diversity and\nmulti-scale noise modeling abilities. Experimental results on several\nrepresentative datasets demonstrate that learning momentum flow matching by\nsampling random velocity fields will produce trajectories that are both diverse\nand efficient, and can consistently generate high-quality and diverse results.\nCode is available at https://github.com/liuruixun/momentum-fm.",

    "abstract": "Context. Among the most significant chemical functional groups of\ninterstellar molecules are the class of nitriles, which are proposed as key\nprebiotic molecules due to their chemical connection to the peptide bond after\nhydrolysis. CN radicals, the simplest representative of this group, have been\nshown to exhibit strong interactions with interstellar water ices, potentially\nimpacting their reactivity with other radicals nearby. Aims. This study\nexplores (a) whether CN and CH3 radicals can readily react to form methyl\ncyanide (CH3CN) and its isomer methyl isocyanide (CH3NC); and (b) the\nfeasibility of the reaction (CN...H2O)hemi -> C(OH)=NH and its potential role\nin the formation of acetamide. Methods. Following a benchmark, density\nfunctional theory was employed to map the potential energy surfaces of these\nchemical processes, focusing on their reactivity on water and carbon monoxide\nices. Results. The results show that CN reacts with CH3 radicals on water ices,\nforming CH3CN and CH3NC efficiently. However, these reactions are driven by\ndiffusion of CH3 towards the reactive site and subsequently compete with\nback-diffusion of CH3 from that site. The formation of the radical intermediate\nC(OH)=NH on water ice requires quantum tunnelling and assuming that acetimidic\nacid forms via CH3 + C(OH)=NH -> CH3C(OH)=NH, it can also only isomerize into\nacetamide through a sizable barrier thanks to quantum tunnelling. Both quantum\ntunnelling-driven reactions are highly dependent on the local structure of the\nwater ice. Finally, radical coupling reactions on carbon monoxide ices are\nfound to be barrierless for all cases and again, both the cyanide and the\nisocyanide are formed. Conclusions. This work reinforces the conclusion that CN\nradicals on interstellar grain surfaces are highly reactive and unlikely to\npersist unaltered.",

    "abstract": "The magnetization of bodies in static fields, formulated as transmission\nproblems of the Laplace equation, has been a standard topic in electrodynamics\nfor over a century. In the infinite permeability limit, the body becomes\napproximately equipotential. However, surprisingly, this textbook-level\ndescription captures only the internal potential, leaving the exterior field\nlargely unaddressed. Textbooks typically note only that the external magnetic\nfield $\\mathbf{H}$ is normal to the surface near the boundary, without further\ncharacterizing the exterior field. This raises a question: could the exterior\nfield exhibit additional fundamental properties? Here, we fill this gap and\nreveal a previously overlooked geometric invariance: in the same limit, the\nentire external magnetic response, including field distribution and all\nmultipole moments, is determined solely by the outer surface geometry,\nindependent of its internal structure or deformation. This invariance provides\na theoretical basis for the lightweight design of magnetic devices such as flux\nconcentrators. Given that analogous Laplace transmission problems arise across\nphysics, including electric conduction, heat flow, and acoustic scattering,\nthis invariance exhibits cross-disciplinary universality. Together with\nquasi-equipotential property, it completes the characterization of Laplace\ntransmission problems in the infinite permeability limit.",

We seek simple symbolic\nparametrisations for the impact of baryonic physics on the matter power\nspectrum for a range of physically motivated models, as a function of\nwavenumber, redshift, cosmology, and parameters controlling the baryonic\nfeedback. We use symbolic regression to construct analytic approximations for\nthe ratio of the matter power spectrum in the presence of baryons to that\nwithout such effects. We obtain separate functions of each of four distinct\nsub-grid prescriptions of baryonic physics from the CAMELS suite of\nhydrodynamical simulations (Astrid, IllustrisTNG, SIMBA and Swift-EAGLE) as\nwell as for a baryonification algorithm. We also provide functions which\ndescribe the uncertainty on these predictions, due to both the stochastic\nnature of baryonic physics and the errors on our fits. The error on our\napproximations to the hydrodynamical simulations is comparable to the sample\nvariance estimated through varying initial conditions, and our baryonification\nexpression has a root mean squared error of better than one percent, although\nthis increases on small scales. These errors are comparable to those of\nprevious numerical emulators for these models. Our expressions are enforced to\nhave the physically correct behaviour on large scales and at high redshift. Due\nto their analytic form, we are able to directly interpret the impact of varying\ncosmology and feedback parameters, and we can identify parameters which have\nlittle to no effect.

One striking feature is a failure to\nreturn to equilibrium after an abrupt change in otherwise static external\nconditions. Instead, amorphous materials often exhibit physical aging: an\never-slowing, nonexponential relaxation that can span a huge range of\ntimescales. Here we examine the aging behavior of three different amorphous\nmaterials subjected to slow periodic driving. The results reveal a generic\naging phenomenon characterized by a logarithmic decay of dissipation per cycle.\nThis observation is evaluated against several mesoscopic models of amorphous\nmatter that successfully capture aging under static conditions: (i) a\ncollection of noninteracting relaxation processes (ii) a noisy hysteron model\nwith random pairwise interactions, and (iii) a structural model consisting of a\nrandom network of bi-stable elastic bonds. We find that only the latter model\nreproduces all experimental findings and relate its success to its persistent,\nslow exploration of a complex energy landscape with clear signatures of replica\nsymmetry breaking. Thus, cyclic driving emerges as a simple yet powerful\nprotocol to characterize amorphous materials, probe their complex energy\nlandscapes, and distinguish between different models.",

    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) for point cloud pre-training has become a\ncornerstone for many 3D vision tasks, enabling effective learning from\nlarge-scale unannotated data. At the scene level, existing SSL methods often\nincorporate volume rendering into the pre-training framework, using RGB-D\nimages as reconstruction signals to facilitate cross-modal learning. This\nstrategy promotes alignment between 2D and 3D modalities and enables the model\nto benefit from rich visual cues in the RGB-D inputs. However, these approaches\nare limited by their reliance on implicit scene representations and high memory\ndemands. Furthermore, since their reconstruction objectives are applied only in\n2D space, they often fail to capture underlying 3D geometric structures. To\naddress these challenges, we propose Gaussian2Scene, a novel scene-level SSL\nframework that leverages the efficiency and explicit nature of 3D Gaussian\nSplatting (3DGS) for pre-training. The use of 3DGS not only alleviates the\ncomputational burden associated with volume rendering but also supports direct\n3D scene reconstruction, thereby enhancing the geometric understanding of the\nbackbone network. Our approach follows a progressive two-stage training\nstrategy. In the first stage, a dual-branch masked autoencoder learns both 2D\nand 3D scene representations. In the second stage, we initialize training with\nreconstructed point clouds and further supervise learning using the geometric\nlocations of Gaussian primitives and rendered RGB images. This process\nreinforces both geometric and cross-modal learning. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of Gaussian2Scene across several downstream 3D object detection\ntasks, showing consistent improvements over existing pre-training methods.",

    "abstract": "Semantic segmentation in remote sensing images is crucial for various\napplications, yet its performance is heavily reliant on large-scale,\nhigh-quality pixel-wise annotations, which are notoriously expensive and\ntime-consuming to acquire. Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSS) offers a\npromising alternative to mitigate this data dependency. However, existing SSS\nmethods often struggle with the inherent distribution mismatch between limited\nlabeled data and abundant unlabeled data, leading to suboptimal generalization.\nTo alleviate this issue, we attempt to introduce the Vision Foundation Models\n(VFMs) pre-trained on vast and diverse datasets into the SSS task since VFMs\npossess robust generalization capabilities that can effectively bridge this\ndistribution gap and provide strong semantic priors for SSS. Inspired by this,\nwe introduce RS-MTDF (Multi-Teacher Distillation and Fusion), a novel framework\nthat leverages the powerful semantic knowledge embedded in VFMs to guide\nsemi-supervised learning in remote sensing. Specifically, RS-MTDF employs\nmultiple frozen VFMs (e.g., DINOv2 and CLIP) as expert teachers, utilizing\nfeature-level distillation to align student features with their robust\nrepresentations. To further enhance discriminative power, the distilled\nknowledge is seamlessly fused into the student decoder. Extensive experiments\non three challenging remote sensing datasets demonstrate that RS-MTDF\nconsistently achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, our method\noutperforms existing approaches across various label ratios on LoveDA and\nsecures the highest IoU in the majority of semantic categories.

Compressive and frictional contact constraints are\napplied over the contact pairs of sub-segments obtained by the subdivision of\nhigher-order segments. The normal traction depends upon the penalisation of\ntrue interpenetration, and frictional traction depends upon relative sliding\nbetween sub-segments over their shared patches. The midplane constructed by\nlinearised subfacets can be corrected to account for local curvature of\ninteracting physical surfaces.

    "abstract": "The Radon cumulative distribution transform (R-CDT), is an easy-to-compute\nfeature extractor that facilitates image classification tasks especially in the\nsmall data regime. It is closely related to the sliced Wasserstein distance and\nprovably guaranties the linear separability of image classes that emerge from\ntranslations or scalings. In many real-world applications, like the recognition\nof watermarks in filigranology, however, the data is subject to general affine\ntransformations originating from the measurement process. To overcome this\nissue, we recently introduced the so-called max-normalized R-CDT that only\nrequires elementary operations and guaranties the separability under arbitrary\naffine transformations. The aim of this paper is to continue our study of the\nmax-normalized R-CDT especially with respect to its robustness against\nnon-affine image deformations. Our sensitivity analysis shows that its\nseparability properties are stable provided the Wasserstein-infinity distance\nbetween the samples can be controlled. Since the Wasserstein-infinity distance\nonly allows small local image deformations, we moreover introduce a\nmean-normalized version of the R-CDT. In this case, robustness relates to the\nWasserstein-2 distance and also covers image deformations caused by impulsive\nnoise for instance. Our theoretical results are supported by numerical\nexperiments showing the effectiveness of our novel feature extractors as well\nas their robustness against local non-affine deformations and impulsive noise.",

In addition, it is sometimes natural to expect the regression\nfunction to be discontinuous at the change-points, and in the field of\nepidemiology, this model is used in \\cite{JiaZS22}, which is considered\nimportant due to the analysis of COVID-19 data. On the other hand, model\nselection is also indispensable in segmented regression, including the\nestimation of the number of change-points; however, it can be said that only\nBIC-type information criteria have been developed. In this paper, we derive an\ninformation criterion based on the original definition of AIC, aiming to\nminimize the divergence between the true structure and the estimated structure.\nThen, using the statistical asymptotic theory specific to the segmented\nregression, we confirm that the penalty for the change-point parameter is 6 in\nthe discontinuous case. On the other hand, in the continuous case, we show that\nthe penalty for the change-point parameter remains 2 despite the rapid change\nin the derivative coefficients.

    "abstract": "The X-ray Imaging Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM) provides the best spectral\nresolution with which to study Sulfur (S) K-shell photoabsorption features from\nthe interstellar medium (ISM). For the first time, we demonstrate the\nhigh-signal detection of interstellar atomic SII K-beta absorption in the\nspectrum of X-ray binaries (XRBs) 4U 1630-472 and GX 340+0. The persistence of\nthis feature across multiple instruments, targets, and flux states implies that\nit is interstellar in nature. We measure the SII Kbeta line centroid at 2470.8\n+/- 1.1 eV after including systematic uncertainties. We also find that the most\nrecently published high resolution SII absorption template requires a\nsystematic energy scale shift of +7-8 eV, which is comparable to the level of\ndisagreement among various atomic modeling procedures. The XRISM 300 ks\nobservation of GX 340+0 provides unprecedented signal-to-noise in the S K\nregion, and we find evidence of residual absorption from solid S in the spectra\nof GX 340+0. Absorption templates from three Fe-S compounds, troilite (FeS),\npyrrhotite (Fe_7S_8) and pyrite (FeS_2), provide equally good fits to the\nresiduals. Even though we are not able to distinguish among these three\ncompounds, they provide equal estimates for the abundance of S locked in dust\ngrains. Having accounted for both the gaseous and solid S in the GX 340+0\nsightline provides us with a direct measurement of S depletion, which is 40%\n+/- 15%. Our depletion measurement provides an upper limit to the fraction of\ninterstellar Fe bound in Fe-S compounds of < 25%, which is consistent with\nprior studies of Fe-S compounds via Fe L-shell absorption. Both XRBs in this\nstudy are at a distance of approximately 11 kpc and on the opposite side of the\nGalactic disk, suggesting that this value could represent the average S\ndepletion of the Milky Way when integrated across all phases of the ISM.",

We introduce superposed parameterised\nquantum circuits to overcome these limitations. By combining flip-flop quantum\nrandom-access memory with repeat-until-success protocols, a superposed\nparameterised quantum circuit embeds an exponential number of parameterised\nsub-models in a single circuit and induces polynomial activation functions\nthrough amplitude transformations and post-selection.

Numerical\nexperiments underscore these advantages: on a 1D step-function regression a\ntwo-qubit superposed parameterised quantum circuit cuts the mean-squared error\nby three orders of magnitude versus a parameter-matched variational baseline;\non a 2D star-shaped two-dimensional classification task, introducing a\nquadratic activation lifts accuracy to 81.4% and reduces run-to-run variance\nthree-fold.

For pulsed-field excitation, the spectral\nresponse of the quantum system may differ significantly: while a\nrectangular-shaped pulse leads to a linear power broadening, pulses with smooth\nshapes show significantly reduced power broadening, for instance, logarithmic\nfor the Gaussian shape and none for the hyperbolic-secant shape. Recently\n[Phys. Rev.

Applying Conditional\nIndependence (CI) tests directly to such discretized data, however, can lead to\nincorrect conclusions. To address this, recent advancements have sought to\ninfer the correct CI relationship between the latent variables through\nbinarizing observed data. However, this process inevitably results in a loss of\ninformation, which degrades the test's performance. Motivated by this, this\npaper introduces a sample-efficient CI test that does not rely on the\nbinarization process.

In this work, we propose a\nnovel self-rewarding reinforcement learning framework to enhance Large Language\nModel (LLM) reasoning by leveraging the consistency of intermediate reasoning\nstates across different reasoning trajectories. Our key insight is that correct\nresponses often exhibit consistent trajectory patterns in terms of model\nlikelihood: their intermediate reasoning states tend to converge toward their\nown final answers (high consistency) with minimal deviation toward other\ncandidates (low volatility). Inspired by this observation, we introduce CoVo,\nan intrinsic reward mechanism that integrates Consistency and Volatility via a\nrobust vector-space aggregation strategy, complemented by a curiosity bonus to\npromote diverse exploration. CoVo enables LLMs to perform RL in a\nself-rewarding manner, offering a scalable pathway for learning to reason\nwithout external supervision. Extensive experiments on diverse reasoning\nbenchmarks show that CoVo achieves performance comparable to or even surpassing\nsupervised RL. Our code is available at https://github.com/sastpg/CoVo.",

Interdisciplinary collaboration is often championed as a key\npathway for fostering such engagement. Yet it remains unclear whether\ninterdisciplinary research teams are actually leading this shift in practice.\nThis study analyzes over 100,000 AI-related papers published on ArXiv between\n2014 and 2024 to examine how ethical values and societal concerns are\nintegrated into technical AI research. We develop a classifier to identify\nsocietal content and measure the extent to which research papers express these\nconsiderations. We find a striking shift: while interdisciplinary teams remain\nmore likely to produce societally-oriented research, computer science-only\nteams now account for a growing share of the field's overall societal output.\nThese teams are increasingly integrating societal concerns into their papers\nand tackling a wide range of domains - from fairness and safety to healthcare\nand misinformation. These findings challenge common assumptions about the\ndrivers of societal AI and raise important questions. First, what are the\nimplications for emerging understandings of AI safety and governance if most\nsocietally-oriented research is being undertaken by exclusively technical\nteams? Second, for scholars in the social sciences and humanities: in a\ntechnical field increasingly responsive to societal demands, what distinctive\nperspectives can we still offer to help shape the future of AI?",

To fulfil the conditions necessary for phase mixing to\noccur, we consider the cross-field gradient in the Alfv\\'en speed as a free\nparameter in our model. Using a single-fluid description of a partially ionized\nchromospheric plasma, we explore the efficiency of damping of shear Alfv\\'en\nwaves subject to phase mixing when a pulse wave driver is employed. Our results\ndemonstrate a strong dependence of the dissipation length of shear Alfv\\'en\nwaves on both the ionization degree of the plasma and the gradient of the\nAlfv\\'en speed. When assessing the efficiency of phase mixing across various\ninhomogeneities, our findings indicate that waves originating from a pulse\ndriver exhibit initially identical heating rates as those generated by a\ncontinuous wave driver. One key difference observed was that Alfv\\'en pulses\npossess a lower overall decay rate due to a change in damping profile from\nexponential to algebraic. This discrepancy arises from the absence of a\nconsistent injection of energy into the base of the domain, that preserves\nlongitudinal gradients of the magnetic field perturbations more effectively.\nThese findings demonstrate the importance of understanding the relations\nbetween the wave driver, damping mechanisms, and propagation dynamics in\nresolving the atmospheric heating problem.",

    "abstract": "The tidal deformation of a neutron star in a binary inspiral driven by the\nemission of gravitational waves affects the orbital dynamics and produces a\nmeasurable modulation of the waves. Late in the inspiral, a regime of dynamical\ntides takes over from a prior regime of static tides. A recent analysis by Yu\net al. [M.N.R.A.S. 519, 4325 (2022)] reveals that nonlinear aspects of the\ntidal interaction are important during the regime of dynamical tides. Their\ntheoretical framework is grounded in Newtonian gravity and fluid mechanics, and\nrelies on a representation of the tidal deformation in terms of the star's\nnormal modes of vibration. We confirm their observation in a general\nrelativistic treatment of the tidal deformation of a neutron star, without\nrelying on a mode representation of this deformation. The starting point of our\ndescription is a simultaneous time-derivative and nonlinear expansion of the\ntidal deformation, expressed in terms of three encapsulating constants, the\nstatic $k_2$, dynamic $\\ddot{k}_2$, and nonlinear $p_2$ tidal constants. We\ndescribe the neutron star's deformation in terms of a well-defined quadrupole\nmoment tensor, which is related to the tidal quadrupole moment through a\nfrequency-domain response function $\\tilde{k}_2(\\omega)$. In a pragmatic\nextension of our simultaneous expansion, we express this in a form proportional\nto $(1-\\omega^2/\\omega_*^2)^{-1}$, the characteristic response of a harmonic\noscillator subjected to a driving force of frequency $\\omega$, with a\nnatural-frequency parameter $\\omega_*$ constructed from the tidal constants. We\ncompute these for polytropic stellar models, and show that the nonlinear\nconstant $p_2$ lowers the frequency parameter by as much as 15% relative to an\nestimation based on a purely linear treatment of the tidal deformation.",

Unlike prior Direct Alignment Algorithms (DAAs) such as\nDirect Preference Optimization (DPO), which uniformly adjust all token\nprobabilities regardless of their relevance to preference, ConfPO focuses\noptimization on the most impactful tokens. This targeted approach improves\nalignment quality while mitigating overoptimization (i.e., reward hacking) by\nusing the KL divergence budget more efficiently. In contrast to recent\ntoken-level methods that rely on credit-assignment models or AI annotators,\nraising concerns about scalability and reliability, ConfPO is simple,\nlightweight, and model-free. Experimental results on challenging alignment\nbenchmarks, including AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard, demonstrate that ConfPO\nconsistently outperforms uniform DAAs across various LLMs, delivering better\nalignment with zero additional computational overhead.",

Although decades of research have produced\na rich repertoire of mitigation techniques, persistent limitations: scarce\nhigh-quality data, algorithmic opacity, and residual reliance on expert\njudgment, continue to constrain progress. This review synthesizes recent\nadvances at the intersection of risk-informed decision making, human\nreliability assessment (HRA), artificial intelligence (AI), and cognitive\nscience to clarify how their convergence can curb human-error risk. We first\ncategorize the principal forms of human error observed in complex\nsociotechnical environments and outline their quantitative impact on system\nreliability. Next, we examine risk-informed frameworks that embed HRA within\nprobabilistic and data-driven methodologies, highlighting successes and gaps.\nWe then survey cognitive and human-performance models, detailing how\nmechanistic accounts of perception, memory, and decision-making enrich error\nprediction and complement HRA metrics. Building on these foundations, we\ncritically assess AI-enabled techniques for real-time error detection,\noperator-state estimation, and AI-augmented HRA workflows. Across these\nstrands, a recurring insight emerges: integrating cognitive models with\nAI-based analytics inside risk-informed HRA pipelines markedly enhances\npredictive fidelity, yet doing so demands richer datasets, transparent\nalgorithms, and rigorous validation. Finally, we identify promising research\ndirections, coupling resilience engineering concepts with grounded theory,\noperationalizing the iceberg model of incident causation, and establishing\ncross-domain data consortia, to foster a multidisciplinary paradigm that\nelevates human reliability in high-stakes systems.",

    "abstract": "Canada experienced in 2023 one of the most severe wildfire seasons in recent\nhistory, causing damage across ecosystems, destroying communities, and emitting\nlarge quantities of CO2. This extreme wildfire season is symptomatic of a\nclimate-change-induced increase in the length and severity of the fire season\nthat affects the boreal ecosystem. Therefore, it is critical to empower\nwildfire management in boreal communities with better mitigation solutions.\nWildfire probability maps represent an important tool for understanding the\nlikelihood of wildfire occurrence and the potential severity of future\nwildfires. The massive increase in the availability of Earth observation data\nhas enabled the development of deep learning-based wildfire forecasting models,\naiming at providing precise wildfire probability maps at different spatial and\ntemporal scales. A main limitation of such methods is their reliance on\ncoarse-resolution environmental drivers and satellite products, leading to\nwildfire occurrence prediction of reduced resolution, typically around $\\sim\n0.1${\\deg}. This paper presents a benchmark dataset: CanadaFireSat, and\nbaseline methods for high-resolution: 100 m wildfire forecasting across Canada,\nleveraging multi-modal data from high-resolution multi-spectral satellite\nimages (Sentinel-2 L1C), mid-resolution satellite products (MODIS), and\nenvironmental factors (ERA5 reanalysis data). Our experiments consider two\nmajor deep learning architectures.

Comprehensive evaluation requires testing across\ndiverse scenarios that can trigger various types of violations under different\nconditions. While existing methods typically focus on individual diversity\nmetrics, such as input scenarios, ADS-generated motion commands, and system\nviolations, they often fail to capture the complex interrelationships among\nthese elements. This oversight leads to gaps in testing coverage, potentially\nmissing critical issues in the ADS under evaluation. However, quantifying these\ninterrelationships presents a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose\na novel causality-aware fuzzing technique, Causal-Fuzzer, to enable efficient\nand comprehensive testing of ADSs by exploring causally diverse scenarios. The\ncore of Causal-Fuzzer is constructing a causal graph to model the\ninterrelationships among the diversities of input scenarios, ADS motion\ncommands, and system violations. Then the causal graph will guide the process\nof critical scenario generation. Specifically, Causal-Fuzzer proposes (1) a\ncausality-based feedback mechanism that quantifies the combined diversity of\ntest scenarios by assessing whether they activate new causal relationships, and\n(2) a causality-driven mutation strategy that prioritizes mutations on input\nscenario elements with higher causal impact on ego action changes and violation\noccurrence, rather than treating all elements equally. We evaluated\nCausal-Fuzzer on an industry-grade ADS Apollo, with a high-fidelity. Our\nempirical results demonstrate that Causal-Fuzzer significantly outperforms\nexisting methods in (1) identifying a greater diversity of violations, (2)\nproviding enhanced testing sufficiency with improved coverage of causal\nrelationships, and (3) achieving greater efficiency in detecting the first\ncritical scenarios.",

This approach\nenables LLMs not only to generate syntactically and semantically correct CUDA\ncode but also to iteratively refine it for efficiency, tailored to the\ncharacteristics of the GPU architecture. We evaluate FSR on representative CUDA\nkernels, covering AI workloads and computational intensive algorithms. Our\nresults show that LLMs augmented with FSR consistently guarantee correctness\nrates. Meanwhile, the automatically generated kernels can outperform general\nhuman-written code by a factor of up to 179$\\times$ in execution speeds. These\nfindings highlight the potential of combining LLMs with performance\nreinforcement to automate GPU programming for hardware-specific,\narchitecture-sensitive, and performance-critical applications.",

However, CLIP still struggles with fine-grained, region-level\nunderstanding, hindering its effectiveness on these dense prediction tasks. We\nidentify two pivotal factors required to address this limitation: semantic\ncoherence and fine-grained vision-language alignment. Current adaptation\nmethods often improve fine-grained alignment at the expense of semantic\ncoherence, and often rely on extra modules or supervised fine-tuning. To\novercome these issues, we propose Any-to-Any Self-Distillation (ATAS), a novel\napproach that simultaneously enhances semantic coherence and fine-grained\nalignment by leveraging own knowledge of a model across all representation\nlevels. Unlike prior methods, ATAS uses only unlabeled images and an internal\nself-distillation process to refine representations of CLIP vision encoders,\npreserving local semantic consistency while sharpening local detail\nrecognition. On open-vocabulary object detection and semantic segmentation\nbenchmarks, ATAS achieves substantial performance gains, outperforming baseline\nCLIP models. These results validate the effectiveness of our approach and\nunderscore the importance of jointly maintaining semantic coherence and\nfine-grained alignment for advanced open-vocabulary dense prediction.",

This procedure can be significantly enhanced with Artificial\nIntelligence (AI)-based software, which assists radiologists in identifying\nabnormalities. However, training AI systems requires large and diverse\ndatasets, which are often difficult to obtain due to privacy and ethical\nconstraints. To address this issue, the paper introduces MAMmography ensemBle\nmOdel (MAMBO), a novel patch-based diffusion approach designed to generate\nfull-resolution mammograms. Diffusion models have shown breakthrough results in\nrealistic image generation, yet few studies have focused on mammograms, and\nnone have successfully generated high-resolution outputs required to capture\nfine-grained features of small lesions. To achieve this, MAMBO integrates\nseparate diffusion models to capture both local and global (image-level)\ncontexts. The contextual information is then fed into the final model,\nsignificantly aiding the noise removal process. This design enables MAMBO to\ngenerate highly realistic mammograms of up to 3840x3840 pixels. Importantly,\nthis approach can be used to enhance the training of classification models and\nextended to anomaly segmentation. Experiments, both numerical and radiologist\nvalidation, assess MAMBO's capabilities in image generation, super-resolution,\nand anomaly segmentation, highlighting its potential to enhance mammography\nanalysis for more accurate diagnoses and earlier lesion detection.

In order to reduce this problem, the method\nof adaptive aperture photometry has been proposed. This method has been applied\nto star clusters from the M 31 Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT)\nsurvey, and studies show that the adaptive aperture photometry performs better\nthan the conventional approach. The aim of this study is to determine the best\nachievable limits on the accuracy and applicability of the aperture photometry\nmethod for studying star clusters in the local Universe. We computed a large\nnetwork of artificial 3D star clusters spanning the parameter space of the M 31\nclusters. We then simulated images of these clusters by projecting each onto a\n2D plane from 100 directions. Star cluster images were generated in six\npassbands to match the PHAT survey. To investigate the limiting accuracy of\naperture photometry and the limits of its applicability to star cluster\nstudies, we measured the simulated images and performed parameter determination\ntests. We demonstrate that star clusters with and without post-main-sequence\nstars have significant photometric differences. We show that in order to obtain\nreliable physical parameters of star clusters, the CIs must be measured using\nan aperture with a radius larger than the cluster's half-light radius.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate that the parameter determination of young clusters\n(~10 Myr) is problematic regardless of the aperture size used. Therefore, it is\nadvisable to determine the parameters of these clusters using colour-magnitude\ndiagram fitting methods, when possible. We also show that the randomness of the\nviewing angle can lead to a CI uncertainty of up to 0.1 mag, depending on\ncluster parameters and aperture size.",

    "abstract": "Rule-based reasoning has been acknowledged as one of the fundamental problems\nin reasoning, while deviations in rule formats, types, and complexity in\nreal-world applications pose severe challenges. Recent studies have shown that\nlarge reasoning models (LRMs) have remarkable reasoning capabilities, and their\nperformance is substantially enhanced by reinforcement learning (RL). However,\nit remains an open question whether small reasoning models (SRMs) can learn\nrule-based reasoning effectively with robust generalization across diverse\ntasks and domains. To address this, we introduce Reinforced Rule-based\nReasoning, a.k.a. RuleReasoner, a simple yet effective method to conduct\nrule-based reasoning via a wide collection of curated tasks and a novel\ndomain-aware dynamic sampling approach. Specifically, RuleReasoner resamples\neach training batch by updating the sampling weights of different domains based\non historical rewards. This facilitates domain augmentation and flexible online\nlearning schedules for RL, obviating the need for pre-hoc human-engineered\nmix-training recipes used in existing methods. Empirical evaluations on\nin-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmarks reveal that\nRuleReasoner outperforms frontier LRMs by a significant margin ($\\Delta$4.1%\naverage points on eight ID tasks and $\\Delta$10.4% average points on three OOD\ntasks over OpenAI-o1). Notably, our approach also exhibits higher computational\nefficiency compared to prior dynamic sampling methods for RL.",

    "abstract": "LSM-tree-based data stores are widely used in industry due to their\nexceptional performance. However, as data volumes grow, efficiently querying\nlarge-scale databases becomes increasingly challenging. To address this, recent\nstudies attempted to integrate learned indexes into LSM-trees to enhance lookup\nperformance, which has demonstrated promising improvements. Despite this, only\na limited range of learned index types has been considered, and the strengths\nand weaknesses of different learned indexes remain unclear, making them\ndifficult for practical use. To fill this gap, we provide a comprehensive and\nsystematic benchmark to pursue an in-depth understanding of learned indexes in\nLSM-tree systems. In this work, we summarize the workflow of 8 existing learned\nindexes and analyze the associated theoretical cost. We also identify several\nkey factors that significantly influence the performance of learned indexes and\nconclude them with a novel configuration space, including various index types,\nboundary positions, and granularity. Moreover, we implement different learned\nindex designs on a unified platform to evaluate across various configurations.\nSurprisingly, our experiments reveal several unexpected insights, such as the\nmarginal lookup enhancement when allocating a large memory budget to learned\nindexes and modest retraining overhead of learned indexes. Besides, we also\noffer practical guidelines to help developers intelligently select and tune\nlearned indexes for custom use cases.",

Though there\nare different methods for approximating the quantization, none of them model\nthe quantization noise correctly and thus, result in suboptimal networks.\nHence, we propose an additional finetuning training step: After conventional\nend-to-end training, parts of the network are retrained on quantized latents\nobtained at the inference stage. For entropy-constraint quantizers like\nTrellis-Coded Quantization, the impact of the quantizer is particularly\ndifficult to approximate by rounding or adding noise as the quantized latents\nare interdependently chosen through a trellis search based on both the entropy\nmodel and a distortion measure. We show that retraining on correctly quantized\ndata consistently yields additional coding gain for both uniform scalar and\nespecially for entropy-constraint quantization, without increasing inference\ncomplexity.

Empirical\nresults show, for example, training time reductions on the order of 20-35% and\ncommunication overhead reductions of 30-40% compared to baseline AdaBoost, with\nconvergence achieved in significantly fewer boosting rounds.

However, CBCT suffers from increased noise,\nlimited soft-tissue contrast, and artifacts, resulting in unreliable Hounsfield\nunit values and hindering direct dose calculation. Synthetic CT (sCT)\ngeneration from CBCT addresses these issues, especially using deep learning\n(DL) methods. Existing approaches are limited by institutional heterogeneity,\nscanner-dependent variations, and data privacy regulations that prevent\nmulti-center data sharing.\n  To overcome these challenges, we propose a cross-silo horizontal federated\nlearning (FL) approach for CBCT-to-sCT synthesis in the head and neck region,\nextending our FedSynthCT framework. A conditional generative adversarial\nnetwork was collaboratively trained on data from three European medical centers\nin the public SynthRAD2025 challenge dataset.\n  The federated model demonstrated effective generalization across centers,\nwith mean absolute error (MAE) ranging from $64.38\\pm13.63$ to $85.90\\pm7.10$\nHU, structural similarity index (SSIM) from $0.882\\pm0.022$ to $0.922\\pm0.039$,\nand peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) from $32.86\\pm0.94$ to $34.91\\pm1.04$ dB.\nNotably, on an external validation dataset of 60 patients, comparable\nperformance was achieved (MAE: $75.22\\pm11.81$ HU, SSIM: $0.904\\pm0.034$, PSNR:\n$33.52\\pm2.06$ dB) without additional training, confirming robust\ngeneralization despite protocol, scanner differences and registration errors.\n  These findings demonstrate the technical feasibility of FL for CBCT-to-sCT\nsynthesis while preserving data privacy and offer a collaborative solution for\ndeveloping generalizable models across institutions without centralized data\nsharing or site-specific fine-tuning.",

    "abstract": "A universal controller for any robot morphology would greatly improve\ncomputational and data efficiency. By utilizing contextual information about\nthe properties of individual robots and exploiting their modular structure in\nthe architecture of deep reinforcement learning agents, steps have been made\ntowards multi-robot control. Generalization to new, unseen robots, however,\nremains a challenge. In this paper we hypothesize that the relevant contextual\ninformation is partially observable, but that it can be inferred through\ninteractions for better generalization to contexts that are not seen during\ntraining. To this extent, we implement a modular recurrent architecture and\nevaluate its generalization performance on a large set of MuJoCo robots. The\nresults show a substantial improved performance on robots with unseen dynamics,\nkinematics, and topologies, in four different environments.",

    "abstract": "In the past decade, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers\nhave achieved wide applicaiton in semantic segmentation tasks. Although CNNs\nwith Transformer models greatly improve performance, the global context\nmodeling remains inadequate. Recently, Mamba achieved great potential in vision\ntasks, showing its advantages in modeling long-range dependency. In this paper,\nwe propose a lightweight Efficient CNN-Mamba Network for semantic segmentation,\ndubbed as ECMNet. ECMNet combines CNN with Mamba skillfully in a capsule-based\nframework to address their complementary weaknesses. Specifically, We design a\nEnhanced Dual-Attention Block (EDAB) for lightweight bottleneck. In order to\nimprove the representations ability of feature, We devise a Multi-Scale\nAttention Unit (MSAU) to integrate multi-scale feature aggregation, spatial\naggregation and channel aggregation. Moreover, a Mamba enhanced Feature Fusion\nModule (FFM) merges diverse level feature, significantly enhancing segmented\naccuracy. Extensive experiments on two representative datasets demonstrate that\nthe proposed model excels in accuracy and efficiency balance, achieving 70.6%\nmIoU on Cityscapes and 73.6% mIoU on CamVid test datasets, with 0.87M\nparameters and 8.27G FLOPs on a single RTX 3090 GPU platform.",

    "abstract": "Logical specifications play a key role in the formal analysis of behavioural\nmodels. Automating the derivation of such specifications is particularly\nvaluable in complex systems, where manual construction is time-consuming and\nerror-prone. This article presents an approach for generating logical\nspecifications from process models discovered via workflow mining, combining\npattern-based translation with automated reasoning techniques. In contrast to\nearlier work, we evaluate the method on both general-purpose and real-case\nevent logs, enabling a broader empirical assessment. The study examines the\nimpact of data quality, particularly noise, on the structure and testability of\ngenerated specifications. Using automated theorem provers, we validate a\nvariety of logical properties, including satisfiability, internal consistency,\nand alignment with predefined requirements. The results support the\napplicability of the approach in realistic settings and its potential\nintegration into empirical software engineering practices.",

    ],
    "abstract": "Conformance checking is a fundamental task of process mining, which\nquantifies the extent to which the observed process executions match a\nnormative process model. The state-of-the-art approaches compute alignments by\nexploring the state space formed by the synchronous product of the process\nmodel and the trace. This often leads to state space explosion, particularly\nwhen the model exhibits a high degree of choice and concurrency. Moreover, as\nalignments inherently impose a sequential structure, they fail to fully\nrepresent the concurrent behavior present in many real-world processes. To\naddress these limitations, this paper proposes a new technique for computing\npartial-order alignments {on the fly using directed Petri net unfoldings, named\nFoldA. We evaluate our technique on 485 synthetic model-log pairs and compare\nit against Astar- and Dijkstra-alignments on 13 real-life model-log pairs and 6\nbenchmark pairs. The results show that our unfolding alignment, although it\nrequires more computation time, generally reduces the number of queued states\nand provides a more accurate representation of concurrency.",

The\ntotal luminosity recorded by the LHCb experiment corresponds to 13.6 $pb^{-1}$\nfor $p$Pb collisions and 20.8 $pb^{-1}$ for Pb$p$ collisions, where the first\nparticle indicates the forward direction of the detector. Measurements are\nperformed in the dimuon final state at forward (backward) centre-of-mass\nrapidity $1.5<y^*<4.0$ ($-5.0<y^*<-2.5$) for $p$Pb (Pb$p$) collisions.A\nmultiplicity dependence of the prompt production ratio is observed in $p$Pb\ncollisions, whereas no dependence is found in nonprompt production, nor in\neither prompt or nonprompt production in Pb$p$ collisions. These results\nsuggest that in the Pb-going direction additional suppression mechanisms beyond\ncomover effects may be present, possibly related to the formation of\nquark-gluon plasma.

In this work, we introduce a simple yet powerful,\nbiologically inspired deep learning ensemble framework that-unlike prior\nstudies focused on only a handful of anatomical targets-simultaneously\ndistinguishes 16 fetal structures. Drawing on the hierarchical, modular\norganization of biological vision systems, our model stacks two complementary\nbranches (a \"shallow\" path for coarse, low-resolution cues and a \"detailed\"\npath for fine, high-resolution features), concatenating their outputs for final\nprediction. To our knowledge, no existing method has addressed such a large\nnumber of classes with a comparably lightweight architecture. We trained and\nevaluated on 5,298 routinely acquired clinical images (annotated by three\nexperts and reconciled via Dawid-Skene), reflecting real-world noise and\nvariability rather than a \"cleaned\" dataset. Despite this complexity, our\nensemble (EfficientNet-B0 + EfficientNet-B6 with LDAM-Focal loss) identifies\n90% of organs with accuracy > 0.75 and 75% of organs with accuracy >\n0.85-performance competitive with more elaborate models applied to far fewer\ncategories.

Compared with the original algorithm,\nthe new algorithm has two main differences.

Secondly, the\nspectral analysis method used for the final step of azimuth compression in the\noriginal SGA has been replaced with a new matched filtering processing, which\ncan avoid image aliasing in azimuth direction and improve computational\nefficiency.

Applications ranged from developing foundation models for fusion reactor\ncontrol to automating Monte Carlo simulations, predicting material degradation,\nand designing experimental programs for advanced reactors. Teams employed\nstructured workflows combining prompt engineering, deep research capabilities,\nand iterative refinement to generate hypotheses, prototype code, and research\nstrategies. Key findings demonstrate that LLMs excel at early-stage\nexploration, literature synthesis, and workflow design, successfully\nidentifying research gaps and generating plausible experimental frameworks.\nHowever, significant limitations emerged, including difficulties with novel\nmaterials designs, advanced code generation for modeling and simulation, and\ndomain-specific details requiring expert validation.

In all of these methods, a key characteristic is that none can\ntrain the neural network with every possible input data, specifically, every\npixel and potential 3D point along the projection rays due to scalability\nissues. While vanilla NeRFs uniformly sample both the image pixels and 3D\npoints along the projection rays, some variants focus only on guiding the\nsampling of the 3D points along the projection rays. In this paper, we leverage\nthe implicit surface representation of the foreground scene and model a\nprobability density function in a 3D image projection space to achieve a more\ntargeted sampling of the rays toward regions of interest, resulting in improved\nrendering. Additionally, a new surface reconstruction loss is proposed for\nimproved performance. This new loss fully explores the proposed 3D image\nprojection space model and incorporates near-to-surface and empty space\ncomponents. By integrating our novel sampling strategy and novel loss into\ncurrent state-of-the-art neural implicit surface renderers, we achieve more\naccurate and detailed 3D reconstructions and improved image rendering,\nespecially for the regions of interest in any given scene.",

Yet, perhaps\nsurprisingly, many widely deployed comparison-based preference learning models,\nincluding large language models, fail to have this guarantee. Until now, the\nonly comparison-based preference learning algorithms that were proved to be\nmonotone are the Generalized Bradley-Terry models.

Most of these indices are based on structural aspects of tree\nshape, such as clade sizes or leaf depths. For instance, indices like the\nSackin index, total cophenetic index, and $\\widehat{s}$-shape statistic all\nquantify tree balance through clade sizes, albeit with different definitions\nand properties.\n  In this paper, we formalize the idea that many tree (im)balance indices are\nfunctions of similar underlying tree shape characteristics by introducing\nmetaconcepts of tree balance. A metaconcept is a function $\\Phi_f$ that depends\non a function $f$ capturing some aspect of tree shape, such as balance values,\nclade sizes, or leaf depths. These metaconcepts encompass existing indices but\nalso provide new means of measuring tree balance. The versatility and\ngenerality of metaconcepts allow for the systematic study of entire families of\n(im)balance indices, providing deeper insights that extend beyond\nindex-by-index analysis.",

This paper explores the underlying\nfactors of this problem and points out the smoothness degree of soft labels for\ndifferent classes significantly impacts the robust fairness from both empirical\nobservation and theoretical analysis. Based on the above exploration, we\npropose Anti-Bias Soft Label Distillation (ABSLD) within the Knowledge\nDistillation framework to enhance the adversarial robust fairness.\nSpecifically, ABSLD adaptively reduces the student's error risk gap between\ndifferent classes, which is accomplished by adjusting the class-wise smoothness\ndegree of teacher's soft labels during the training process, and the adjustment\nis managed by assigning varying temperatures to different classes.\nAdditionally, as a label-based approach, ABSLD is highly adaptable and can be\nintegrated with the sample-based methods.

However, both traditional heuristics (e.g.,\ntwo-stage local search) and recent metaheuristics often struggle to adapt to\nthe dynamic characteristics of practical SCCSP instances. To address these\nlimitations, this paper introduces a novel Q learning based hierarchical\ncooperative local search framework, termed HierC_Q, aimed at minimizing the\nweighted sum of the maximum completion time and the average waiting time in\nSCCSP. The core contributions of HierC_Q are twofold. First, considering the\nintrinsic coupling properties of the SCCSP, a dedicated reward function is\nproposed based on a novel coupling measure (CM), guiding the exploration\nprocess towards promising regions of the solution space. Second, a hierarchical\narchitecture is devised, comprising two distinct tiers: the learn to improve\n(L2I) tier and the \"disturb to renovate\" (D2R) tier. The L2I tier performs deep\nexploitation within promising regions using two independent Q-learning-based\nlocal search frameworks (QLSFs) tailored for subproblems, along with a synergy\nQLSF designed for the main problem. To enhance the effectiveness of local\nsearch, a validity evaluation approach and a speed-up evaluation method are\nalso intro-duced, grounded in a detailed study of the problem's structure.\nMeanwhile, the D2R tier incorporates a perturbation and construction based\nsolution renewal strategy to mitigate the risk of premature convergence. The\nsuperiority and effectiveness of HierC_Q are demonstrated through extensive\ncomparisons with eleven local search frameworks and nine state-of-the-art\nalgorithms.",

As consequences, we establish the list of such\ncurves with low genus and we outline a maximality result which involves the\nSuzuki curves.

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are increasingly deployed in graph-related\napplications, making ownership verification critical to protect their\nintellectual property against model theft. Fingerprinting and black-box\nwatermarking are two main methods. However, the former relies on determining\nmodel similarity, which is computationally expensive and prone to ownership\ncollisions after model post-processing such as model pruning or fine-tuning.\nThe latter embeds backdoors, exposing watermarked models to the risk of\nbackdoor attacks. Moreover, both methods enable ownership verification but do\nnot convey additional information. As a result, each distributed model requires\na unique trigger graph, and all trigger graphs must be used to query the\nsuspect model during verification. Multiple queries increase the financial cost\nand the risk of detection.\n  To address these challenges, this paper proposes WGLE, a novel black-box\nwatermarking paradigm for GNNs that enables embedding the multi-bit string as\nthe ownership information without using backdoors. WGLE builds on a key insight\nwe term Layer-wise Distance Difference on an Edge (LDDE), which quantifies the\ndifference between the feature distance and the prediction distance of two\nconnected nodes. By predefining positive or negative LDDE values for multiple\nselected edges, WGLE embeds the watermark encoding the intended information\nwithout introducing incorrect mappings that compromise the primary task. WGLE\nis evaluated on six public datasets and six mainstream GNN architectures along\nwith state-of-the-art methods. The results show that WGLE achieves 100%\nownership verification accuracy, an average fidelity degradation of 0.85%,\ncomparable robustness against potential attacks, and low embedding overhead.\nThe code is available in the repository.",

The outflows and jets are well-collimated, with the jets\nexhibiting multiple bullet structures. The position-velocity diagram along the\nCO flow axis shows two characteristic structures: (a) the flow velocity which\nlinearly increases with the position offset from the core center (Hubble-like\nflow), and (b) continuous velocity components of the periodical flows\n(spine-like structures), which may indicate the episodic mass-ejection event.\nThe time intervals of the mass-ejection events are estimated to be 900--4000\nyears based on the slopes of these spine-like structures. These characteristics\nalign with those of nearby protostellar systems, indicating that early star\nformation in low-metallicity environments, such as the outer Galaxy, resembles\nthat in the inner Galaxy. In contrast to the physical similarities, the\n$N\\mathrm{(SiO)}$/$N\\mathrm{(CO)}$ ratio in the jet bullet appears to be lower\nthan that measured in the low-mass protostellar sources in the inner Galaxy.\nThis may indicate the different shock chemistry or different dust composition\nin the outer Galaxy source, although non-LTE effects could also affect the\nobserved low $N\\mathrm{(SiO)}$/$N\\mathrm{(CO)}$ ratio.

    "abstract": "Quantitative knowledge of sulfur speciation in the fluid phase is key to\nunderstanding sulfur degassing from magmas and its transfer along with metals\nby fluids across the lithosphere. Farsang and Zajacz (1) recently reported new\nsulfur speciation data using Raman spectroscopy measurements on aqueous\nH$_2$SO$_4$-NaCl(-KCl) solutions trapped as synthetic fluid inclusions in\nquartz at 875$^\\circ$C and 2 kbar under variable redox conditions. They\ninterpreted the data by dominant SO$_{2(aq)}$ and HS$^-$, along with\nsubordinate H$_2$S$_{(aq)}$, whereas the di-and trisulfur radical ions,\n$[S_3^\\bullet]^-$ and $[S_2^\\bullet]^-$, reported in aqueous fluids both in\nnature and experiment to at least 700 $^\\circ$C and 15 kbar (2-5) , were\nundetectable in Raman nonresonant spectra 1 . On the basis of thermochemical\ncalculations that returned negligible HS$^-$ and large $[S_3^\\bullet]^-$\nconcentrations at their experimental conditions, the authors claimed that the\npublished $[S_3^\\bullet]^-$ and HS$^-$ thermodynamic data were incorrect and\nthat the major species controlling both sulfur and gold transport in\nhydrothermal-magmatic fluids is the HS$^-$ anion. Here I demonstrate that their\nconclusions stem from the use of inconsistent thermodynamic data and incorrect\nRaman spectra assignments. Thus, ref. 1 provides no grounds for questioning the\nvalidity of the thermodynamic properties of HS$^-$ and $[S_3^\\bullet]^-$ or of\ntheir metal complexes in the fluids of the Earth's crust.",

This algorithm, dubbed the neural quantum\nexcited-state (NQES) algorithm, requires no explicit orthogonalization of the\nstates and is generally applicable to higher dimensions. We demonstrate,\nthrough concrete examples including the Haldane-Shastry model with all-to-all\ninteractions, that the NQES algorithm is capable of efficiently computing\nmultiple excited states and their related observable expectations. In addition,\nwe apply the NQES algorithm to two classes of long-range interacting\ntrapped-ion systems in a two-dimensional Wigner crystal. For non-decaying\nall-to-all interactions with alternating signs, our computed low-lying excited\nstates bear spatial correlation patterns similar to those of the ground states,\nwhich closely match recent experimental observations that the\nquasi-adiabatically prepared state accurately reproduces analytical\nground-state correlations.

    "abstract": "Elemental abundances hold important information about the star formation\nhistory in the Galactic Center. The thermal X-ray spectra of certain stars can\nprovide a robust probe of elemental abundances, mainly through the presence of\nK-shell emission lines. In this work, based on deep archival {\\it Chandra}\nobservations, we obtain X-ray measurements of five heavy elements (Si, S, Ar,\nCa and Fe) for three sources in the Arches cluster, one source in the\nQuintuplet cluster, as well as a field source known as Edd 1, which are all\nprobable WR stars exhibiting a high quality X-ray spectrum. A two-temperature,\nnon-equilibrium ionization plasma model is employed for the spectral fit,\ntaking into account light element compositions characteristic of WR star winds,\nwhich is substantially depleted in hydrogen but enriched in nitrogen and/or\ncarbon. It is found that the Arches and Quintuplet WR stars share similar\nabundances of Si, S, and Ar, while exhibiting distinct Ca and Fe abundances,\nwhich may be understood as due to dust depletion of the latter two elements in\nQuintuplet. The observed near-solar or sub-solar metallicity of the WR star\nwinds can be naturally understood as the result of nucleosynthesis and internal\nmixing of the parent star, which have a supersolar initial metallicity as\nexpected for the Galactic center in general. Implications of our findings on\nthe origin of the young star clusters and isolated massive stars in the\nGalactic center, as well as the elemental composition of the accretion flow\nonto Sgr A*, are addressed.",

For example, the class of 3D-grids is not\nk-planar for any fixed k.

We introduce CounselBench, a large-scale benchmark developed\nwith 100 mental health professionals to evaluate and stress-test LLMs in\nsingle-turn counseling. The first component, CounselBench-EVAL, contains 2,000\nexpert evaluations of responses from GPT-4, LLaMA 3, Gemini, and online human\ntherapists to real patient questions. Each response is rated along six\nclinically grounded dimensions, with written rationales and span-level\nannotations. We find that LLMs often outperform online human therapists in\nperceived quality, but experts frequently flag their outputs for safety\nconcerns such as unauthorized medical advice. Follow-up experiments show that\nLLM judges consistently overrate model responses and overlook safety issues\nidentified by human experts. To probe failure modes more directly, we construct\nCounselBench-Adv, an adversarial dataset of 120 expert-authored counseling\nquestions designed to trigger specific model issues. Evaluation across 2,880\nresponses from eight LLMs reveals consistent, model-specific failure patterns.\nTogether, CounselBench establishes a clinically grounded framework for\nbenchmarking and improving LLM behavior in high-stakes mental health settings.",

Do neurons and glia of the enteric nervous system display specific\nmechanical properties to withstand these forces? Using nano-indentation\ncombined with immunohistochemistry and second harmonic generation imaging of\ncollagen, we discovered that enteric ganglia in adult mice are an order of\nmagnitude more resistant to deformation than brain tissue. We found that\nglia-rich regions in ganglia have a similar stiffness to neuron-rich regions\nand to the surrounding smooth muscle, of ~3 kPa at 3 $\\mu$m indentation depth\nand of ~7 kPa at 8 $\\mu$m depth. Differences in the adhesion strength of the\ndifferent tissue layers to the glass indenter were scarce.

    "abstract": "Two-stage Colonel Blotto game represents a typical adversarial resource\nallocation problem, in which two opposing agents sequentially allocate\nresources in a network topology across two phases: an initial resource\ndeployment followed by multiple rounds of dynamic reallocation adjustments. The\nsequential dependency between game stages and the complex constraints imposed\nby the graph topology make it difficult for traditional approaches to attain a\nglobally optimal strategy. To address these challenges, we propose a\nhierarchical graph Transformer framework called HGformer. By incorporating an\nenhanced graph Transformer encoder with structural biases and a two-agent\nhierarchical decision model, our approach enables efficient policy generation\nin large-scale adversarial environments. Moreover, we design a layer-by-layer\nfeedback reinforcement learning algorithm that feeds the long-term returns from\nlower-level decisions back into the optimization of the higher-level strategy,\nthus bridging the coordination gap between the two decision-making stages.\nExperimental results demonstrate that, compared to existing hierarchical\ndecision-making or graph neural network methods, HGformer significantly\nimproves resource allocation efficiency and adversarial payoff, achieving\nsuperior overall performance in complex dynamic game scenarios.",

However, due to the tilt of the\nsupporting leg, the error of the contact model are amplified, making robot\nstate estimation more challenging. Therefore, this paper focuses on the noise\nanalysis and state estimation for robot walking with the ESVC foot. First,\nthrough physical robot experiments, we investigate the effect of the ESVC foot\non robot measurement noise and process noise. and a noise-time regression model\nusing sliding window strategy is developed. Then, a hierarchical adaptive state\nestimator for biped robots with the ESVC foot is proposed. The state estimator\nconsists of two stages: pre-estimation and post-estimation. In the\npre-estimation stage, a data fusion-based estimation is employed to process the\nsensory data. During post-estimation, the acceleration of center of mass is\nfirst estimated, and then the noise covariance matrices are adjusted based on\nthe regression model. Following that, an EKF(Extended Kalman Filter) based\napproach is applied to estimate the centroid state during robot walking.\nPhysical experiments demonstrate that the proposed adaptive state estimator for\nbiped robot walking with the ESVC foot not only provides higher precision than\nboth EKF and Adaptive EKF, but also converges faster under varying noise\nconditions.",

    "abstract": "Based on a sample of $(1.0087\\pm0.0044)\\times10^{10}$ $J/\\psi$ events\ncollected at BESIII, the transition form factor of the $\\eta$ meson is\nextracted by analyzing\n$J/\\psi\\to\\gamma\\eta',~\\eta'\\to\\pi^+\\pi^-\\eta,~\\eta\\to\\gamma l^+l^-$ ($l$=$e$,\n$\\mu$) events. The measured slope of the transition form factor is\n$\\Lambda^{-2}=1.645\\pm0.093_{\\rm stat.}\\pm {0.024_{\\rm sys.}}$\n(GeV/$c^2$)$^{-2}$ for the di-electron channel and\n$\\Lambda^{-2}=1.645\\pm0.343_{\\rm stat.}\\pm0.017_{\\rm sys.}$ (GeV/$c^2$)$^{-2}$\nfor the di-muon channel. The branching fractions for $\\eta\\rightarrow\\gamma\ne^+e^-$ and $\\eta\\rightarrow\\gamma\\mu^+\\mu^-$ are measured to be\n$\\mathcal{B}(\\eta\\to\\gamma e^+e^-)=(6.79\\pm0.04_{\\rm stat.}\\pm0.36_{\\rm\nsys.})\\times 10^{-3}$ and\n$\\mathcal{B}(\\eta\\to\\gamma\\mu^+\\mu^-)=(2.97\\pm0.11_{\\rm stat.}\\pm0.07_{\\rm\nsys.})\\times 10^{-4}$.

This adaptive tVMC approach addresses\nnumerical instabilities that arise when the variational ansatz is\noverparameterized or contains redundant degrees of freedom. Building on the\nconcept of the local-in-time error (LITE), a measure of the deviation between\nvariational and exact evolution, we introduce a procedure to quantify each\nparameter's contribution to reducing the LITE, using only quantities already\ncomputed in standard tVMC simulations.

We benchmark the algorithm on\nquantum quenches in the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model using both\nspin-Jastrow and restricted Boltzmann machine wave functions, with an emphasis\non overparameterized regimes. The adaptive scheme significantly improves\nnumerical stability and reduces the need for strong regularization, enabling\nreliable simulations with highly expressive variational ans\\\"atze.",

It includes more than 220'000\nhours in-domain (ID) sleep recordings, and more than 84'000 hours out-of-domain\n(OOD) sleep recordings, spanning a broad range of ages, sleep-wake disorders,\nand hardware setups. We release pre-trained models based on high-performing SoA\narchitectures and evaluate them under standardized conditions across single-\nand multi-channel EEG/EOG configurations. We introduce SOMNUS, an ensemble\ncombining models across architectures and channel setups via soft voting.\nSOMNUS achieves robust performance across twenty-four different datasets, with\nmacro-F1 scores between 68.7% and 87.2%, outperforming individual models in\n94.9% of cases. Notably, SOMNUS surpasses previous SoA methods, even including\ncases where compared models were trained ID while SOMNUS treated the same data\nas OOD. Using a subset of the BSWR (N=6'633), we quantify model biases linked\nto age, gender, AHI, and PLMI, showing that while ensemble improves robustness,\nno model architecture consistently minimizes bias in performance and clinical\nmarkers estimation. In evaluations on OOD multi-annotated datasets (DOD-H,\nDOD-O), SOMNUS exceeds the best human scorer, i.e., MF1 85.2% vs 80.8% on\nDOD-H, and 80.2% vs 75.9% on DOD-O, better reproducing the scorer consensus\nthan any individual expert (k = 0.89/0.85 and ACS = 0.95/0.94 for healthy/OSA\ncohorts).

Adiabatic DNP protocols on the other hand\nhave less strict requirements and could enable robust and high fidelity spin\ntransfer.

Instead of relying on expert labor in analyzing specific linguistic\nfeatures, these new methods enable the exploration of linguistic variation\nthrough embeddings derived directly from speech, opening new avenues for\nlarge-scale, data-driven analyses.\n  This study employs embeddings from the fine-tuned XLS-R self-supervised\nlanguage identification model voxlingua107-xls-r-300m-wav2vec, to analyze\nrelationships between 106 world languages based on speech recordings. Using\nlinear discriminant analysis (LDA), language embeddings are clustered and\ncompared with genealogical, lexical, and geographical distances. The results\ndemonstrate that embedding-based distances align closely with traditional\nmeasures, effectively capturing both global and local typological patterns.\nChallenges in visualizing relationships, particularly with hierarchical\nclustering and network-based methods, highlight the dynamic nature of language\nchange.\n  The findings show potential for scalable analyses of language variation based\non speech embeddings, providing new perspectives on relationships among\nlanguages. By addressing methodological considerations such as corpus size and\nlatent space dimensionality, this approach opens avenues for studying\nlow-resource languages and bridging macro- and micro-level linguistic\nvariation. Future work aims to extend these methods to underrepresented\nlanguages and integrate sociolinguistic variation for a more comprehensive\nunderstanding of linguistic diversity.",

This is\nparticularly challenging in offshore environments, such as the Endurance\nlicense area in the North Sea, where the UK's permanent land-based seismometer\nnetwork offers limited monitoring capability due to its distance from the\nexpected locations of seismic events. A Bayesian experimental design framework\nis used to assess enhancements of the network with a low-noise onshore station\nlocated at around 1~km depth in Boulby mine, the onshore North York Moors\nSeismic Array, an optimally-located additional on-shore monitoring site, and\nocean bottom seismometers (OBS). We quantify the expected information gain\nabout seismic source locations and introduce a practical method to incorporate\nsignal-to-noise dependent detectability and velocity model uncertainty. We show\nthat the Boulby station or an onshore array primarily lower the detection\nthreshold for small-magnitude events (M=0-2), but offer limited improvement in\nlocation accuracy. An optimally-located additional land-based seismometer or\nlocal array provides little additional benefit. OBS deployments yield\nsignificant improvements in location accuracy due to their proximity to\npotential seismicity. Optimised networks of two to three OBS stations are\neffective for Endurance, while three to five OBS stations offer robust\nmonitoring across North Sea carbon storage licence areas off England's east\ncoast. Velocity model uncertainty remains a key limiting factor for location\nprecision across all configurations.

However, many real-world applications demand not only sparsity\nconstraints but also some extra constraints. While prior algorithms have been\ndeveloped to address this complex scenario with mixed combinatorial and convex\nconstraints, they typically require the closed form projection onto the mixed\nconstraints which might not exist, and/or only provide local guarantees of\nconvergence which is different from the global guarantees commonly sought in\nsparse optimization. To fill this gap, in this paper, we study the problem of\nsparse optimization with extra support-preserving constraints commonly\nencountered in the literature. We present a new variant of iterative\nhard-thresholding algorithm equipped with a two-step consecutive projection\noperator customized for these mixed constraints, serving as a simple\nalternative to the Euclidean projection onto the mixed constraint. By\nintroducing a novel trade-off between sparsity relaxation and sub-optimality,\nwe provide global guarantees in objective value for the output of our\nalgorithm, in the deterministic, stochastic, and zeroth-order settings, under\nthe conventional restricted strong-convexity/smoothness assumptions. As a\nfundamental contribution in proof techniques, we develop a novel extension of\nthe classic three-point lemma to the considered two-step non-convex projection\noperator, which allows us to analyze the convergence in objective value in an\nelegant way that has not been possible with existing techniques. In the\nzeroth-order case, such technique also improves upon the state-of-the-art\nresult from de Vazelhes et. al.

This combined architecture, termed the DMDG\nsource-pocket TFET (DMDG-SP TFET), achieves higher ON current and reduced\nsubthreshold swing compared to conventional TFETs. Previous DMDG-SP TFET\ndesigns primarily use heterogeneous gate dielectrics, composed of two stacked\ninsulators to enhance gate control and tunneling modulation.

Theoretical\nmodelling of such multiphase outflows often employs wind tunnel simulations of\na spherical cold ($\\sim 10^4 \\ \\rm K$) cloud facing a uniform hot ($\\sim 10^6\\\n\\rm K$) wind. However, outflows are naturally expanding and wind conditions\nchange downstream -- a crucial aspect overlooked in most idealized simulations.\nTo address this, we examine how an expanding wind influences the survival,\nmorphology, and dynamics of a cloud. We perform idealized hydrodynamic\nsimulations of radiative cloud-crushing in an expanding wind, where the steady\nbackground wind is modelled using the adiabatic Chevalier & Clegg 1985 (CC85)\nanalytic solution. Moving downstream, we find that the clouds remain locally\nisobaric with the wind, leading to a steep decline in their density contrast\nwith respect to the ambient medium, and they eventually dissipate into the\nwind. This also suppresses the growth of cold gas mass in comparison to a\nplane-parallel wind since entrained clouds move into a less radiative\nbackground. Using analytic scaling arguments, we present a physical picture of\ncloud evolution in a CC85 wind. Cloud expansion and local pressure equilibrium\nare the key regulators of cold mass growth. Unlike traditional homogeneous wind\ntunnel simulations, our simulations account for the differential expansion\nexperienced by the long cometary tails of clouds moving in an outflow.\nConsequently, a strong head-to-tail emission gradient in the filamentary cold\ngas tails develop -- features closer to observations. In addition, we\ndemonstrate that the dynamics of individual clouds may substantially alter the\nradial properties of their host multiphase outflows.",

While the optical and morphological properties of nanoporous\nmetals have been extensively studied, their electronic properties at ultrafast\ntimescales remain largely unexplored. Here, we study the transient response of\na nanoporous gold metamaterial and compare it with the ultrafast dynamics of a\ncontinuous gold film. We unravel that the nanoporous sample supports lower\nenergy interband transitions, due to a much higher electron temperature in the\nnanoporous material, which causes an enhanced redistribution of electron\ndensity around the Fermi level. The experimental results are consistent with\nthe two-temperature model, which highlights the role of nanoscale porosity in\nenabling the more efficient generation of hot carriers, thus allowing lower\nenergy photons to induce interband transitions. Our findings demonstrate that\nnanoporosity affects fundamental ultrafast electronic processes and introduces\nthis platform as temporal metamaterial allowing the emergence of tunable\nelectronic properties not supported by the bulk counterpart. Furthermore, we\npresent new insights into ultrafast electronic properties of nanoporous metals,\nwhich can impact several areas, from photochemistry and catalysis to energy\nharvesting and opto-electronics.",

To model repeat consumption, the repeat-aware\nrecommendation has been proposed to predict which item will be re-interacted\nbased on the user-item interactions. In this paper, we investigate various\ninherent characteristics to enhance the repeat-aware recommendation.\nSpecifically, we explore these characteristics from two aspects: one is from\nthe temporal aspect where we consider the time interval relationship in the\nuser behavior sequence; the other is from the sequential aspect where we\nconsider the sequential-level relationship in the user behavior sequence. And\nour intuition is that both the temporal pattern and sequential pattern will\nreflect users' intentions of repeat consumption. By utilizing these two\npatterns, a novel model called Temporal and Sequential repeat-aware\nRecommendation(TSRec for short) is proposed to enhance repeat-aware\nrecommendation. TSRec has three main components: 1) User-specific Temporal\nRepresentation Module (UTRM), which encodes and extracts user historical repeat\ntemporal information. 2)Item-specific Temporal Representation Module (ITRM),\nwhich incorporates item time interval information as side information to\nalleviate the data sparsity problem of user repeat behavior sequence. 3)\nSequential Repeat-Aware Module (SRAM), which represents the similarity between\nthe user's current and the last repeat sequences.

In this paper, considering the problem of state estimation with\nunknown but bounded noise disturbances, an Invariant Zonotopic Set-Membership\nFilter (InZSMF) method on groups is innovatively proposed, which extends the\ninvariant filtering theory to the field of non-statistical filtering\nrepresented by set-membership filtering. Firstly, the InZSMF method transforms\nthe state space from the traditional Euclidean vector space to the Lie group\nspace to construct group affine discrete systems with unknown but bounded noise\nuncertainty defined by the zonotope on groups. Secondly, the nonlinear observer\non the group is defined and the corresponding linearized estimation error is\nderived. Then, two observer gain tuning algorithms under the InZSMF method are\nproposed, respectively, the pole configuration method and the F-radius\noptimization method. Finally, through simulation experiments, it is shown that\nthe InZSMF state estimation method is generally superior to the traditional\nZonotopic Set-Membership Filter (ZSMF) state estimation method.

Specifically, DTA identifies multiple token\nflows across frames within multi-head query and key tokens to warp inter-frame\ncontexts in the value tokens. AMC adaptively aggregates historical segment\ninformation via a cache unit, ensuring long-term coherence with minimal\noverhead. To further stabilize the cache interaction during inference, we\nintroduce an asymmetric sampling strategy that mitigates feature mismatches\narising from different diffusion sampling steps.

    "abstract": "As generative AI (Gen-AI) tools become more prevalent in education, there is\na growing need to understand how educators, not just students, can actively\nshape their design and use. This study investigates how two instructors\nintegrated four custom GPT tools into a Masters-level Qualitative Research\nMethods course for Urban Planning Policy students. Addressing two key gaps: the\ndominant framing of students as passive AI users, and the limited use of AI in\nqualitative methods education. The study explores how Gen-AI can support\ndisciplinary learning when aligned with pedagogical intent. Drawing on the\nTechnological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework and action\nresearch methodology, the instructors designed GPTs to scaffold tasks such as\nresearch question formulation, interview practice, fieldnote analysis, and\ndesign thinking. Thematic analysis of student reflections, AI chat logs, and\nfinal assignments revealed that the tools enhanced student reflexivity,\nimproved interview techniques, and supported structured analytic thinking.\nHowever, students also expressed concerns about cognitive overload, reduced\nimmersion in data, and the formulaic nature of AI responses. The study offers\nthree key insights: AI can be a powerful scaffold for active learning when\npaired with human facilitation; custom GPTs can serve as cognitive partners in\niterative research practice; and educator-led design is critical to\npedagogically meaningful AI integration.

However, the quantum noise associated with\nthe resulting coherent states, despite being reduced in amplitude by half,\nremains fundamentally constrained by the quantum noise limit, independent of\nthe intensity. By placing a mirror at the unused input port of the BS, a\nstanding wave is formed in the vicinity of the mirror, which influences the\nvacuum fluctuations of the coherent state at the BS output. Using\nsemi-classical and quantum mechanical approaches, we calculate the vacuum\nfluctuations induced by the mirror and demonstrate that the vacuum noise\noriginating from the mirror side periodically reaches zero at the BS output.\nLeveraging this effect, we show that the vacuum fluctuations of the light split\nby the BS can be readily reduced below the quantum noise limit. Furthermore,\nthrough feedback mechanisms, the vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic\nfield at the other output port can also be suppressed below the quantum noise\nlimit.

Due to practical\nconstraints, privacy concerns, or malfunctions, we often observe only a\nfraction of the topological evolution and associated signal, which not only\nhinders downstream tasks but also restricts our analysis of network evolution.\nSuch aspects could be mitigated by moving our attention at the underlying\nlatent driving factors of the network evolution, which can be naturally\nuncovered via low-rank tensor decomposition. Tensor-based methods provide a\npowerful means of uncovering the underlying factors of network evolution\nthrough low-rank decompositions. However, the extracted embeddings typically\nlack a relational structure and are obtained independently from the node\nsignals. This disconnect reduces the interpretability of the embeddings and\noverlooks the coupling between topology and signals. To address these\nlimitations, we propose a novel two-way decomposition to represent a dynamic\ngraph topology, where the structural evolution is captured by a linear\ncombination of latent graph adjacency matrices reflecting the overall joint\nevolution of both the topology and the signal. Using spatio-temporal data, we\nestimate the latent adjacency matrices and their temporal scaling signatures\nvia alternating minimization, and prove that our approach converges to a\nstationary point.

Here we present the first\nobservation of quasi-bound states in the continuum (qBICs) realized via\npolaritonic interfering resonances in isolated WS$_2$ nanodisks. We\nexperimentally validate the existence of polaritonic qBICs driven by intrinsic\ncoupling of Mie resonances and excitons. The system exhibits exceptionally\nstrong light-matter interaction with a measured Rabi splitting exceeding 310\nmeV - the largest reported value among all transition metal dichalcogenide\n(TMDC) self-hybridized systems to date. The giant coupling strength stems from\nqBIC-induced in-plane field enhancement, which strongly interacts with in-plane\nexcitonic dipoles while suppressing radiative losses. Polarization-controlled\nmeasurements further demonstrate selective excitation of qBIC through switching\nincident polarization to specific orthogonal configurations. The observed\npolarization-dependent coupling provides an additional degree of freedom to\ncontrol over the hybrid states' spectral characteristics and spatial field\ndistributions.

In contrast, the stellar populations of our $z=0$\nMilky Way analogs are never elongated and always symmetric about their minor\naxes. The youngest stars at $z=0$ reside in thin disks, intermediate-age stars\nreside in thick disks, and the oldest stars reside in flattened spheroids that\nare symmetric about their minor axes.

I ran dynamical simulations for 1 billion years\nusing leftover planetesimals from the Grand Tack, Depleted Disc and\nImplantation models of terrestrial planet formation with the GENGA N-body\nintegrator. I fit the cumulative impacts on the Earth and Mars using a function\nthat is a sum of exponentials with different weighing factors and e-folding\ntimes. Most fits require three or four terms. The fitted timescales cluster\naround t1=10 Myr, t2=35 Myr, t3=100 Myr and t4>200 Myr. I attribute them to\ndynamical losses of planetesimals through different mechanisms:\nhigh-eccentricity Earth crossers and the nu6 secular resonance, Earth crossers,\nMars crossers, and objects leaking on to Mars crossing orbits from beyond Mars.\nI place a constraint on the initial population using the known Archean\nterrestrial spherule beds, and I conclude that the Archean impacts were mostly\ncreated by leftover planetesimals. The inferred mass in leftover planetesimals\nat the time of the Moon's formation was about 0.015 Earth masses. The third\ntime constant is comparable to that of modern crater chronologies. As such, the\ncrater chronologies are indicative of impacts by an ancient population of Mars\ncrossers. The initial perihelion distribution of the leftovers is a major\nfactor in setting the rate of decline: to reproduce the current crater\nchronologies the number of Earth crossers at the time of the Moon's formation\nhad to be at most half of the Mars crossers.

    "abstract": "Vision Transformers (ViTs) exhibit superior performance in computer vision\ntasks but face deployment challenges on resource-constrained devices due to\nhigh computational/memory demands. While Mixture-of-Experts Vision Transformers\n(MoE-ViTs) mitigate this through a scalable architecture with sub-linear\ncomputational growth, their hardware implementation on FPGAs remains\nconstrained by resource limitations. This paper proposes a novel accelerator\nfor efficiently implementing quantized MoE models on FPGAs through two key\ninnovations: (1) A dual-stage quantization scheme combining\nprecision-preserving complex quantizers with hardware-friendly simplified\nquantizers via scale reparameterization, with only 0.28 $\\%$ accuracy loss\ncompared to full precision; (2) A resource-aware accelerator architecture\nfeaturing latency-optimized streaming attention kernels and reusable linear\noperators, effectively balancing performance and resource consumption.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our accelerator achieves nearly 155\nframes per second, a 5.35$\\times$ improvement in throughput, and over $80\\%$\nenergy reduction compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) FPGA MoE accelerators,\nwhile maintaining $<1\\%$ accuracy loss across vision benchmarks.

    "abstract": "Kinetic plasma processes, such as magnetic reconnection, collisionless\nshocks, and turbulence, are fundamental to the dynamics of astrophysical and\nlaboratory plasmas. Simulating these processes often requires particle-in-cell\n(PIC) methods, but the computational cost of fully kinetic simulations can\nnecessitate the use of artificial parameters, such as a reduced speed of light\nand ion-to-electron mass ratio, to decrease expense. While these approximations\ncan preserve overall dynamics under specific conditions, they introduce\nnontrivial impacts on particle collisionality that are not yet well understood.\nIn this work, we develop a method to scale particle collisionality in\nsimulations employing such approximations. By introducing species-dependent\nscaling factors, we independently adjust inter- and intra-species collision\nrates to better replicate the collisional properties of the physical system.\nOur approach maintains the fidelity of electron and ion transport properties\nwhile preserving critical relaxation rates, such as energy exchange timescales,\nwithin the limits of weakly collisional plasma theory. We demonstrate the\naccuracy of this scaling method through benchmarking tests against theoretical\nrelaxation rates and connecting to fluid theory, highlighting its ability to\nretain key transport properties. Existing collisional PIC implementations can\nbe easily modified to include this scaling, which will enable deeper insights\ninto the behavior of marginally collisional plasmas across various contexts.",

However,\nthese works only consider deepfake detection as a classification task and\nignore the case where partial segments of the video are tampered with. Temporal\nforgery localization (TFL) of small fake audio-visual clips embedded in real\nvideos is still challenging and more in line with realistic application\nscenarios. To resolve this issue, we propose a universal context-aware\ncontrastive learning framework (UniCaCLF) for TFL. Our approach leverages\nsupervised contrastive learning to discover and identify forged instants by\nmeans of anomaly detection, allowing for the precise localization of temporal\nforged segments. To this end, we propose a novel context-aware perception layer\nthat utilizes a heterogeneous activation operation and an adaptive context\nupdater to construct a context-aware contrastive objective, which enhances the\ndiscriminability of forged instant features by contrasting them with genuine\ninstant features in terms of their distances to the global context. An\nefficient context-aware contrastive coding is introduced to further push the\nlimit of instant feature distinguishability between genuine and forged instants\nin a supervised sample-by-sample manner, suppressing the cross-sample influence\nto improve temporal forgery localization performance.

This model isolates and\ncharacterizes the structural anisotropy generated during the annealing\nquenching process that is independent of any constituent specific interactions.\nWe refer to this computational framework as Indistinguishable Simulated Folding\n(ISF), a stochastic process that mimics a simulated annealing quenching\nprocedure. Formulated as a Markov process, ISF is governed by two physically\nmeaningful parameters: the number of Markov steps, representing the mean\nduration of each ring folding event, and the stochastic deformation magnitude,\nwhich quantifies thermally induced structural changes per event. Furthermore,\nwe show that the logarithm of any positive valued anisotropy measure generated\nby ISF is a skewed random variable, reflecting the growing entropy production\nrate during the Markov evolution.

However, the deployment of such systems in\nconsumer health contexts raises significant concerns related to hallucination,\nbias, lack of transparency, and ethical misuse. In response to recommendations\nfrom health authorities such as the World Health Organization (WHO), we propose\nResponsible Health Twin (RHealthTwin), a principled framework for building and\ngoverning AI-powered digital twins for well-being assistance. RHealthTwin\nprocesses multimodal inputs that guide a health-focused LLM to produce safe,\nrelevant, and explainable responses. At the core of RHealthTwin is the\nResponsible Prompt Engine (RPE), which addresses the limitations of traditional\nLLM configuration. Conventionally, users input unstructured prompt and the\nsystem instruction to configure the LLM, which increases the risk of\nhallucination. In contrast, RPE extracts predefined slots dynamically to\nstructure both inputs. This guides the language model to generate responses\nthat are context aware, personalized, fair, reliable, and explainable for\nwell-being assistance. The framework further adapts over time through a\nfeedback loop that updates the prompt structure based on user satisfaction. We\nevaluate RHealthTwin across four consumer health domains including mental\nsupport, symptom triage, nutrition planning, and activity coaching. RPE\nachieves state-of-the-art results with BLEU = 0.41, ROUGE-L = 0.63, and\nBERTScore = 0.89 on benchmark datasets.

    "abstract": "Many real-world problems can be transformed into optimization problems, which\ncan be classified into convex and non-convex. Although convex problems are\nalmost completely studied in theory, many related algorithms to many non-convex\nproblems do not work well and we need more optimization techniques. As a swarm\nintelligence optimization algorithm, the Fireworks Algorithm(FWA) has been\nwidely studied and applied to many real-world scenarios, even including large\nlanguage model fine-tuning. But the current fireworks algorithm still has a\nnumber of problems. Firstly, as a heuristic algorithm, its performance on\nconvex problems cannot match the SOTA results, and can even be said to be\nunsatisfactory; secondly, the sampling methods (explosion) of most FWA variants\nare still uniform sampling, which is actually inefficient in high dimensional\ncases. This work of ours proposes a new student's t-distribution based\nFWA(TFWA) with a solid theoretical foundation, which fully utilizes the\nadvantage that student's t-distribution can adjust the parameters (degrees of\nfreedom) and thus adjust the exploitation capability. We have fully\nexperimented on mainstream benchmarks CEC2013 and CEC2017, which proves that\nTFWA not only becomes the strongest variant of the fireworks algorithm, but\nalso achieves results comparable to SOTA on the test set, and its performance\nis far superior to that of the SOTA algorithm in some scenarios with a large\nnumber of extreme points.",

However, each existing PAP\ntypically supports only a single, fixed attack goal, and switching to a\ndifferent objective requires re-generating and re-deploying a new PAP. This\nrigidity limits their practicality in dynamic environments like autonomous\ndriving, where traffic conditions and attack goals can change rapidly. For\nexample, if no obstacles are present around the target vehicle, the attack may\nfail to cause meaningful consequences.\n  To overcome this limitation, we propose SwitchPatch, a novel PAP that is\nstatic yet enables dynamic and controllable attack outcomes based on real-time\nscenarios. Attackers can alter pre-defined conditions, e.g., by projecting\ndifferent natural-color lights onto SwitchPatch to seamlessly switch between\nattack goals. Unlike prior work, SwitchPatch does not require re-generation or\nre-deployment for different objectives, significantly reducing cost and\ncomplexity. Furthermore, SwitchPatch remains benign when the enabling\nconditions are absent, enhancing its stealth.\n  We evaluate SwitchPatch on two key tasks: traffic sign recognition\n(classification and detection) and depth estimation. First, we conduct\ntheoretical analysis and empirical studies to demonstrate the feasibility of\nSwitchPatch and explore how many goals it can support using techniques like\ncolor light projection and occlusion. Second, we perform simulation-based\nexperiments and ablation studies to verify its effectiveness and\ntransferability. Third, we conduct outdoor tests using a Unmanned Ground\nVehicle (UGV) to confirm its robustness in the physical world.

To address these challenges, we introduce\nU-CoT+, a novel framework for harmful meme detection. Instead of relying solely\non prompting or fine-tuning multimodal models, we first develop a high-fidelity\nmeme-to-text pipeline that converts visual memes into detail-preserving textual\ndescriptions. This design decouples meme interpretation from meme\nclassification, thus avoiding immediate reasoning over complex raw visual\ncontent and enabling resource-efficient harmful meme detection with general\nlarge language models (LLMs). Building on these textual descriptions, we\nfurther incorporate targeted, interpretable human-crafted guidelines to guide\nmodels' reasoning under zero-shot CoT prompting. As such, this framework allows\nfor easy adaptation to different harmfulness detection criteria across\nplatforms, regions, and over time, offering high flexibility and\nexplainability. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets validate the\neffectiveness of our framework, highlighting its potential for explainable and\nlow-resource harmful meme detection using small-scale LLMs. Codes and data are\navailable at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/HMC-AF2B/README.md.",

ESRGAN is employed as a\npre-processing step to enhance the low-resolution input image, effectively\nrestoring lost details and improving overall image quality. Subsequently, the\nenhanced image is fed into the Faster R-CNN model for accurate object detection\nand localization. Experimental results demonstrate that this integrated\napproach yields superior performance compared to traditional methods applied\ndirectly to low-resolution images. The proposed framework provides a promising\nsolution for applications where image quality is variable or limited, enabling\nmore robust and reliable object detection in challenging scenarios.

Transients are a novel modality, which are captured for an\nobject as photon counts versus arrival times using a precisely time-resolved\nsensor. In particular for non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios, transients of\nhidden objects are measured beyond the sensor's direct line of sight. Using\nNLOS transients, the majority of previous works optimize volume density or\nsurfaces to reconstruct the hidden objects and do not transfer priors learned\nfrom datasets. In this work, we present a masked autoencoder for modeling\ntransient imaging, or MARMOT, to facilitate NLOS applications. Our MARMOT is a\nself-supervised model pretrianed on massive and diverse NLOS transient\ndatasets. Using a Transformer-based encoder-decoder, MARMOT learns features\nfrom partially masked transients via a scanning pattern mask (SPM), where the\nunmasked subset is functionally equivalent to arbitrary sampling, and predicts\nfull measurements. Pretrained on TransVerse-a synthesized transient dataset of\n500K 3D models-MARMOT adapts to downstream imaging tasks using direct feature\ntransfer or decoder finetuning. Comprehensive experiments are carried out in\ncomparisons with state-of-the-art methods. Quantitative and qualitative results\ndemonstrate the efficiency of our MARMOT.",

For chiral SFs with $\\nu\\ge2$ or\n$|k|\\ge2$ in the BCS regime, the OAM $L_z$ is remarkably reduced from its\n``full\" value in the BEC regime. However, the deviations differ in these two\ncases. For chiral SFs with $\\nu\\ge2$, $L_z$ is sharply suppressed in this ideal\nsetting with a specular wall, while the suppression caused by the $|k| \\ge 2$\nvortex is moderate, which is core-size dependent. Furthermore, for $p+ip$-wave\nSF with $k=-1$, the total OAM $L_z$ is zero, but the distribution $L_z(r)$ is\nnontrivial compared with that of vortex-free $s$-wave SF, in which the total\nOAM is zero as well.

Existing off-dynamics offline RL\nmethods typically either filter source transitions that resemble those of the\ntarget domain or apply reward augmentation to source data, both constrained by\nthe limited transitions available from the target domain. As a result, the\nlearned policy is unable to explore target domain beyond the offline datasets.\nWe propose MOBODY, a Model-Based Off-Dynamics offline RL algorithm that\naddresses this limitation by enabling exploration of the target domain via\nlearned dynamics. MOBODY generates new synthetic transitions in the target\ndomain through model rollouts, which are used as data augmentation during\noffline policy learning. Unlike existing model-based methods that learn\ndynamics from a single domain, MOBODY tackles the challenge of mismatched\ndynamics by leveraging both source and target datasets. Directly merging these\ndatasets can bias the learned model toward source dynamics. Instead, MOBODY\nlearns target dynamics by discovering a shared latent representation of states\nand transitions across domains through representation learning. To stabilize\ntraining, MOBODY incorporates a behavior cloning loss that regularizes the\npolicy. Specifically, we introduce a Q-weighted behavior cloning loss that\nregularizes the policy toward actions with high target-domain Q-values, rather\nthan uniformly imitating all actions in the dataset. These Q-values are learned\nfrom an enhanced target dataset composed of offline target data, augmented\nsource data, and rollout data from the learned target dynamics.

    "abstract": "Electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure is increasingly critical to\nsustainable transport systems, yet its resilience under environmental and\ninfrastructural stress remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce\nRSERI-EV, a spatially explicit and multi-modal risk assessment framework that\ncombines remote sensing data, open infrastructure datasets, and spatial graph\nanalytics to evaluate the vulnerability of EV charging stations. RSERI-EV\nintegrates diverse data layers, including flood risk maps, land surface\ntemperature (LST) extremes, vegetation indices (NDVI), land use/land cover\n(LULC), proximity to electrical substations, and road accessibility to generate\na composite Resilience Score. We apply this framework to the country of Wales\nEV charger dataset to demonstrate its feasibility. A spatial $k$-nearest\nneighbours ($k$NN) graph is constructed over the charging network to enable\nneighbourhood-based comparisons and graph-aware diagnostics. Our prototype\nhighlights the value of multi-source data fusion and interpretable spatial\nreasoning in supporting climate-resilient, infrastructure-aware EV deployment.",

We\nsystematically examine the training and sampling procedures of diffusion\nmodels, and audio applications through different conditioning mechanisms. To\naddress the lack of audio diffusion model codebases and to promote reproducible\nresearch and rapid prototyping, we introduce an open-source codebase at\nhttps://github.com/gzhu06/AudioDiffuser that implements our reviewed framework\nfor various audio applications.

To improve the visual controllability,\nrecent works have considered fine-tuning pre-trained T2V models to support\nimage-to-video (I2V) generation. However, such adaptation frequently suppresses\nmotion dynamics of generated outputs, resulting in more static videos compared\nto their T2V counterparts. In this work, we analyze this phenomenon and\nidentify that it stems from the premature exposure to high-frequency details in\nthe input image, which biases the sampling process toward a shortcut trajectory\nthat overfits to the static appearance of the reference image. To address this,\nwe propose adaptive low-pass guidance (ALG), a simple fix to the I2V model\nsampling procedure to generate more dynamic videos without compromising\nper-frame image quality. Specifically, ALG adaptively modulates the frequency\ncontent of the conditioning image by applying low-pass filtering at the early\nstage of denoising. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ALG significantly\nimproves the temporal dynamics of generated videos, while preserving image\nfidelity and text alignment. Especially, under VBench-I2V test suite, ALG\nachieves an average improvement of 36% in dynamic degree without a significant\ndrop in video quality or image fidelity.",

Each candidate model is fitted using a\nflexible loss function paired with a general regularizer, and the optimal\nweights are determined by minimizing a cross-validation criterion.

However, it remains unclear\nwhether the knowledge has been truly forgotten or just hidden in the model.\nTherefore, we propose to study a novel problem of LLM unlearning attack, which\naims to recover the unlearned knowledge of an unlearned LLM. To achieve the\ngoal, we propose a novel framework Stealthy Unlearning Attack (SUA) framework\nthat learns a universal noise pattern. When applied to input images, this noise\ncan trigger the model to reveal unlearned content. While pixel-level\nperturbations may be visually subtle, they can be detected in the semantic\nembedding space, making such attacks vulnerable to potential defenses. To\nimprove stealthiness, we introduce an embedding alignment loss that minimizes\nthe difference between the perturbed and denoised image embeddings, ensuring\nthe attack is semantically unnoticeable. Experimental results show that SUA can\neffectively recover unlearned information from MLLMs. Furthermore, the learned\nnoise generalizes well: a single perturbation trained on a subset of samples\ncan reveal forgotten content in unseen images.

Those properties reveal that the 2N-storage methods of the\norder of global accuracy less than five possess a symmetry, called c-reflection\nsymmetry, i.e. most methods exist in pairs. A transformation that relates the\nButcher tableaux of the pairs is found and the fact that the c-reflected method\nsatisfies the same order conditions as the original one is proven. Numerical\nevidence that validates the analytic results is presented. Branches of\nsolutions for (5,4) methods, first explored by Carpenter and Kennedy, are\nconstructed numerically. Four new (5,4) schemes with coefficients expressed in\nradicals and one with rational coefficients are examined for illustration.\nEight new (6,4) schemes, some of which can be expressed in rationals or\nradicals, and one (8,4) scheme, are studied to understand the practical\nimplications of the c-reflection symmetry for methods with higher number of\nstages.

Existing OTPs focus almost exclusively on improving\nplatform revenue. In this work, we take a first step in incorporating hotel\nmerchants' objectives into the design of hotel S&R systems to achieve an\nincentive loop: the OTP tilts impressions and better-ranked positions to\nmerchants with high quality, and in return, the merchants provide better\nservice to consumers. Three critical design challenges need to be resolved to\nachieve this incentive loop: Matthew Effect in the consumer feedback-loop,\nunclear relation between hotel quality and performance, and conflicts between\nshort-term and long-term revenue. To address these challenges, we propose\nMERIT, a MERchant IncenTive ranking model, which can simultaneously take the\ninterests of merchants and consumers into account. We define a new Merchant\nCompetitiveness Index (MCI) to represent hotel merchant quality and propose a\nnew Merchant Tower to model the relation between MCI and ranking scores. Also,\nwe design a monotonic structure for Merchant Tower to provide a clear relation\nbetween hotel quality and performance. Finally, we propose a Multi-objective\nStratified Pairwise Loss, which can mitigate the conflicts between OTP's\nshort-term and long-term revenue. The offline experiment results indicate that\nMERIT outperforms these methods in optimizing the demands of consumers and\nmerchants. Furthermore, we conduct an online A/B test and obtain an improvement\nof 3.02% for the MCI score.",

To\naddress this, we propose a pruning framework for LLMs called Orthogonal\ndecomposition and Linear Calibration (Olica), which eliminates the need for\nretraining. A key observation is that the multi-head attention (MHA) layer\ndepends on two types of matrix products. By treating these matrix products as\nunified entities and applying principal component analysis (PCA), we extract\nthe most important information to compress LLMs without sacrificing accuracy or\ndisrupting their original structure.

Its ability to safeguard privacy,\nat the heart of FL, has recently been a hot-button debate topic. To elaborate,\nseveral studies have introduced a type of attacks known as gradient leakage\nattacks (GLAs), which exploit the gradients shared during training to\nreconstruct clients' raw data. On the flip side, some literature, however,\ncontends no substantial privacy risk in practical FL environments due to the\neffectiveness of such GLAs being limited to overly relaxed conditions, such as\nsmall batch sizes and knowledge of clients' data distributions.\n  This paper bridges this critical gap by empirically demonstrating that\nclients' data can still be effectively reconstructed, even within realistic FL\nenvironments. Upon revisiting GLAs, we recognize that their performance\nfailures stem from their inability to handle the gradient matching problem. To\nalleviate the performance bottlenecks identified above, we develop FedLeak,\nwhich introduces two novel techniques, partial gradient matching and gradient\nregularization. Moreover, to evaluate the performance of FedLeak in real-world\nFL environments, we formulate a practical evaluation protocol grounded in a\nthorough review of extensive FL literature and industry practices. Under this\nprotocol, FedLeak can still achieve high-fidelity data reconstruction, thereby\nunderscoring the significant vulnerability in FL systems and the urgent need\nfor more effective defense methods.",

In this work, we\ntheoretically demonstrate (e.g., on a (001)-oriented substrate) that\ndeterministic QD nucleation within a pristine growth region can be achieved by\nengineering the boundary geometry of that region. During epitaxial growth,\nadatoms initially move toward the boundary and promote the formation of primary\nQDs along the boundary, driven by curvature and diffusion anisotropy. The\nresulting primary QDs distribution will generate many-body interactions that\ndynamically reshape the chemical potential landscape for subsequently deposited\nadatoms, enabling the formation of secondary QDs within the pristine growth\nregion. These findings provide a theoretical foundation for reliable patterning\nof high optical-quality QDs, with potential applications in next-generation\nquantum photonic devices.",

    "abstract": "The radio map represents the spatial distribution of spectrum resources\nwithin a region, supporting efficient resource allocation and interference\nmitigation. However, it is difficult to construct a dense radio map as a\nlimited number of samples can be measured in practical scenarios. While\nexisting works have used deep learning to estimate dense radio maps from sparse\nsamples, they are hard to integrate with the physical characteristics of the\nradio map. To address this challenge, we cast radio map estimation as the\nsparse signal recovery problem. A physical propagation model is further\nincorporated to decompose the problem into multiple factor optimization\nsub-problems, thereby reducing recovery complexity. Inspired by the existing\ncompressive sensing methods, we propose the Radio Deep Unfolding Network\n(RadioDUN) to unfold the optimization process, achieving adaptive parameter\nadjusting and prior fitting in a learnable manner. To account for the radio\npropagation characteristics, we develop a dynamic reweighting module (DRM) to\nadaptively model the importance of each factor for the radio map. Inspired by\nthe shadowing factor in the physical propagation model, we integrate\nobstacle-related factors to express the obstacle-induced signal stochastic\ndecay. The shadowing loss is further designed to constrain the factor\nprediction and act as a supplementary supervised objective, which enhances the\nperformance of RadioDUN.

In\nthis work, we show that data reuse can improve existing scaling laws in linear\nregression. Specifically, we derive sharp test error bounds on $M$-dimensional\nlinear models trained by multi-pass stochastic gradient descent (multi-pass\nSGD) on $N$ data with sketched features. Assuming that the data covariance has\na power-law spectrum of degree $a$, and that the true parameter follows a prior\nwith an aligned power-law spectrum of degree $b-a$ (with $a > b > 1$), we show\nthat multi-pass SGD achieves a test error of $\\Theta(M^{1-b} + L^{(1-b)/a})$,\nwhere $L \\lesssim N^{a/b}$ is the number of iterations. In the same setting,\none-pass SGD only attains a test error of $\\Theta(M^{1-b} + N^{(1-b)/a})$ (see\ne.g., Lin et al., 2024).

Heat transfer predictions obtained\nfrom the fluid flow solvers are used as input in ice accretion codes. In glaze\nice conditions, the freezing rates and resulting ice shapes are highly\nsensitive to the input values of the heat transfer coefficient. Hence, an\naccurate prediction of heat transfer on iced airfoils is crucial for correctly\npredicting the ice accretion process [1, 2]. In this study, we perform\nconjugate heat transfer (CHT) simulations using wall-modeled large eddy\nsimulation (WMLES) over surfaces characterized by ice roughness. The results\nshow that WMLES with CHT accurately captures surface temperature distributions\nand heat fluxes across a range of roughness geometries. For the cases\nconsidered, large roughness-to-boundary-layer thickness ratios disrupt\nouter-layer similarity, leading to substantial errors in estimating equivalent\nsandgrain roughness when applying traditional empirical models based on surface\nstatistics. The simulations further show that local heat fluxes vary\nsignificantly across roughness elements due to the low thermal conductivity of\nthe solid; in particular, roughness crests exhibit reduced fluxes in contrast\nto slopes and valleys. These effects are not captured in isothermal wall\nsimulations, which overestimate the Stanton number, especially at roughness\npeaks. By enabling the calculation of Stanton number using heat flux\ndistributions, not directly available in the experiments, the present\nsimulations augment experimental results and highlight the importance of\nincluding solid conduction effects for accurately modeling heat transfer over\nrough, low-conductivity surfaces such as ice.",

    "abstract": "Machine translation has long been a central task in natural language\nprocessing. With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), there\nhas been remarkable progress in translation quality. However, fully realizing\nthe translation potential of LLMs remains an open challenge. Recent studies\nhave explored multi-agent systems to decompose complex translation tasks into\ncollaborative subtasks, showing initial promise in enhancing translation\nquality through agent cooperation and specialization. Nevertheless, existing\nmulti-agent translation frameworks largely neglect foundational insights from\ncognitive translation studies. These insights emphasize how human translators\nemploy different cognitive strategies, such as balancing literal and free\ntranslation, refining expressions based on context, and iteratively evaluating\noutputs. To address this limitation, we propose a cognitively informed\nmulti-agent framework called TACTIC, which stands for T ranslation A gents with\nCognitive- T heoretic Interactive Collaboration. The framework comprises six\nfunctionally distinct agents that mirror key cognitive processes observed in\nhuman translation behavior. These include agents for drafting, refinement,\nevaluation, scoring, context reasoning, and external knowledge gathering. By\nsimulating an interactive and theory-grounded translation workflow, TACTIC\neffectively leverages the full capacity of LLMs for high-quality translation.\nExperimental results on diverse language pairs from the FLORES-200 and WMT24\nbenchmarks show that our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance.

    "abstract": "Exciton condensation in semiconductors and semimetals has long been predicted\nbut remains elusive. In a semiconductor, condensation occurs when the exciton\nbinding energy matches the band gap. This binding energy results from a balance\nbetween Coulomb attraction, which enhances it, and kinetic energy, which\nsuppresses it. However, reducing kinetic energy typically increases screening,\nweakening Coulomb attraction. Empirically, in most candidate materials, the\nbinding energy remains below the band gap, with few external parameters capable\nof altering this balance. Here, we propose an in-plane electric field as a\ncontrol parameter. This field induces hybridisation between even- and\nodd-parity excitons, and the resulting level repulsion effectively enhances\nbinding energy. We argue that this mechanism is generic to excitons in\nsemiconductors and illustrate it with a model of biased bilayer graphene.\nBilayer graphene is chosen since it has a tunable band gap, making it an\nexcitonic condensate candidate and moreover, the Zener tunnelling rate\ncontains, in addition to the usual exponential decay, a non-standard\noscillating component -- thanks to details of the electron dispersion.\nAnalogous to quantum oscillations, we propose that Fourier spectrum of the\ncurrent-voltage data allows for a novel test of exciton condensation. Finally,\nwe show that the is a large excitonic gap to critical temperature ratio -- a\nclear prediction for STM studies.",

The\nprevailing shilling attack methods typically manipulate recommendation results\nby injecting a large number of fake nodes and edges. However, such attack\nstrategies face two primary challenges: low stealth and high destructiveness.\nTo address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel graph backdoor attack\nmethod that aims to enhance the exposure of target items to the target user in\na covert manner, without affecting other unrelated nodes. Specifically, we\ndesign a single-node trigger generator, which can effectively expose multiple\ntarget items to the target user by inserting only one fake user node.\nAdditionally, we introduce constraint conditions between the target nodes and\nirrelevant nodes to mitigate the impact of fake nodes on the recommendation\nsystem's performance. Experimental results show that the exposure of the target\nitems reaches no less than 50% in 99% of the target users, while the impact on\nthe recommendation system's performance is controlled within approximately 5%.",

In this paper, we evaluate deep learning,\nensemble learning and data augmentation frameworks to detect cyclone rapid\nintensification based on wind intensity and spatial coordinates. We note that\nconventional data augmentation methods cannot be utilised for generating\nspatiotemporal patterns replicating cyclones that undergo rapid\nintensification. Therefore, our framework employs deep learning models to\ngenerate spatial coordinates and wind intensity that replicate cyclones to\naddress the class imbalance problem of rapid intensification. We also use a\ndeep learning model for the classification module within the data augmentation\nframework to differentiate between rapid and non-rapid intensification events\nduring a cyclone.

    "abstract": "Recent studies empirically reveal that large reasoning models (LRMs) can\nautomatically allocate more reasoning strengths (i.e., the number of reasoning\ntokens) for harder problems, exhibiting difficulty-awareness for better task\nperformance. While this automatic reasoning strength allocation phenomenon has\nbeen widely observed, its underlying mechanism remains largely unexplored. To\nthis end, we provide explanations for this phenomenon from the perspective of\nmodel activations. We find evidence that LRMs pre-plan the reasoning strengths\nin their activations even before generation, with this reasoning strength\ncausally controlled by the magnitude of a pre-allocated directional vector.\nSpecifically, we show that the number of reasoning tokens is predictable solely\nbased on the question activations using linear probes, indicating that LRMs\nestimate the required reasoning strength in advance. We then uncover that LRMs\nencode this reasoning strength through a pre-allocated directional vector\nembedded in the activations of the model, where the vector's magnitude\nmodulates the reasoning strength. Subtracting this vector can lead to reduced\nreasoning token number and performance, while adding this vector can lead to\nincreased reasoning token number and even improved performance. We further\nreveal that this direction vector consistently yields positive reasoning length\nprediction, and it modifies the logits of end-of-reasoning token </think> to\naffect the reasoning length. Finally, we demonstrate two potential applications\nof our findings: overthinking behavior detection and enabling efficient\nreasoning on simple problems. Our work provides new insights into the internal\nmechanisms of reasoning in LRMs and offers practical tools for controlling\ntheir reasoning behaviors.

In recent decades, DEM has found widespread applications in fields\nsuch as data visualization, geometry processing, and medical imaging.\nTraditional approaches to DEM primarily rely on iterative numerical solvers for\ndiffusion equations or optimization-based methods that minimize handcrafted\nenergy functionals. However, these conventional techniques often face several\nchallenges: they may suffer from limited accuracy, produce overlapping\nartifacts in extreme cases, and require substantial algorithmic redesign when\nextended from 2D to 3D, due to the derivative-dependent nature of their energy\nformulations. In this work, we propose a novel learning-based\ndensity-equalizing mapping framework (LDEM) using deep neural networks.\nSpecifically, we introduce a loss function that enforces density uniformity and\ngeometric regularity, and utilize a hierarchical approach to predict the\ntransformations at both the coarse and dense levels. Our method demonstrates\nsuperior density-equalizing and bijectivity properties compared to prior\nmethods for a wide range of simple and complex density distributions, and can\nbe easily applied to surface remeshing with different effects. Also, it\ngeneralizes seamlessly from 2D to 3D domains without structural changes to the\nmodel architecture or loss formulation.

    "abstract": "Personalized product search provides significant benefits to e-commerce\nplatforms by extracting more accurate user preferences from historical\nbehaviors. Previous studies largely focused on the user factors when\npersonalizing the search query, while ignoring the item perspective, which\nleads to the following two challenges that we summarize in this paper: First,\nprevious approaches relying only on co-occurrence frequency tend to\noverestimate the conversion rates for popular items and underestimate those for\nlong-tail items, resulting in inaccurate item similarities; Second, user\npurchasing propensity is highly heterogeneous according to the popularity of\nthe target item: it is less correlated with the user's historical behavior for\na popular item and more correlated for a long-tail item. To address these\nchallenges, in this paper we propose NAM, a Normalization Attention Model,\nwhich optimizes ''when to personalize'' by utilizing Inverse Item Frequency\n(IIF) and employing a gating mechanism, as well as optimizes ''how to\npersonalize'' by normalizing the attention mechanism from a global perspective.\nThrough comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed NAM model\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models. Furthermore, we\nconducted an online A/B test at Fliggy, and obtained a significant improvement\nof 0.8% over the latest production system in conversion rate.",

    "abstract": "Accuracy and efficiency of the conventional physics-informed neural network\n(PINN) need to be improved before it can be a competitive alternative for soil\nconsolidation analyses. This paper aims to overcome these limitations by\nproposing a highly accurate and efficient physics-informed machine learning\n(PIML) approach, termed time-stepping physics-informed extreme learning machine\n(TS-PIELM). In the TS-PIELM framework the consolidation process is divided into\nnumerous time intervals, which helps overcome the limitation of PIELM in\nsolving differential equations with sharp gradients. To accelerate network\ntraining, the solution is approximated by a single-layer feedforward extreme\nlearning machine (ELM), rather than using a fully connected neural network in\nPINN. The input layer weights of the ELM network are generated randomly and\nfixed during the training process. Subsequently, the output layer weights are\ndirectly computed by solving a system of linear equations, which significantly\nenhances the training efficiency compared to the time-consuming gradient\ndescent method in PINN. Finally, the superior performance of TS-PIELM is\ndemonstrated by solving three typical Terzaghi consolidation problems. Compared\nto PINN, results show that the computational efficiency and accuracy of the\nnovel TS-PIELM framework are improved by more than 1000 times and 100 times for\none-dimensional cases, respectively. This paper provides compelling evidence\nthat PIML can be a powerful tool for computational geotechnics.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces two variational inference approaches for\ninfinite-dimensional inverse problems, developed through gradient descent with\na constant learning rate. The proposed methods enable efficient approximate\nsampling from the target posterior distribution using a constant-rate\nstochastic gradient descent (cSGD) iteration. Specifically, we introduce a\nrandomization strategy that incorporates stochastic gradient noise, allowing\nthe cSGD iteration to be viewed as a discrete-time process. This transformation\nestablishes key relationships between the covariance operators of the\napproximate and true posterior distributions, thereby validating cSGD as a\nvariational inference method. We also investigate the regularization properties\nof the cSGD iteration and provide a theoretical analysis of the discretization\nerror between the approximated posterior mean and the true background function.\nBuilding on this framework, we develop a preconditioned version of cSGD to\nfurther improve sampling efficiency. Finally, we apply the proposed methods to\ntwo practical inverse problems: one governed by a simple smooth equation and\nthe other by the steady-state Darcy flow equation. Numerical results confirm\nour theoretical findings and compare the sampling performance of the two\napproaches for solving linear and non-linear inverse problems.",

    "abstract": "Leveraging more test-time computation has proven to be an effective way to\nboost the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Among various\nmethods, the verify-and-improve paradigm stands out for enabling dynamic\nsolution exploration and feedback incorporation. However, existing approaches\noften suffer from restricted feedback spaces and lack of coordinated training\nof different parties, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we\nmodel this multi-turn refinement process as a Markov Decision Process and\nintroduce DPSDP (Direct Policy Search by Dynamic Programming), a reinforcement\nlearning algorithm that trains an actor-critic LLM system to iteratively refine\nanswers via direct preference learning on self-generated data. Theoretically,\nDPSDP can match the performance of any policy within the training distribution.\nEmpirically, we instantiate DPSDP with various base models and show\nimprovements on both in- and out-of-distribution benchmarks. For example, on\nbenchmark MATH 500, majority voting over five refinement steps increases\nfirst-turn accuracy from 58.2% to 63.2% with Ministral-based models. An\nablation study further confirms the benefits of multi-agent collaboration and\nout-of-distribution generalization.",

    "abstract": "Dark matter (DM) continues to evade direct detection, but neutron stars (NSs)\nserve as natural laboratories where even a modest DM component can alter their\nstructure. While many studies have examined DM effects on NSs, they often rely\non specific choices of equations of state (EOS) models, assume isotropy, and\nlack a Bayesian statistical framework, limiting their predictive power. In this\nwork, we present a Bayesian framework that couples pressure-anisotropic nuclear\nEOS to a self-interacting fermionic DM component, constrained by NICER and\nGW170817 data. Our results show that DM mass fractions up to $\\sim10\\%$ remain\nconsistent with current data, which softens the high-density EOS, leading to\nreduced stellar radii and tidal deformabilities while requiring negligible\npressure anisotropy. Bayesian model comparison reveals no statistically\nsignificant preference between pure baryonic and DM-admixed NSs, indicating\nthat DM inclusion enhances physical realism without complexity penalties.\nHowever, existing data cannot tightly constrain the DM parameters, and our\nempirical radius definition introduces a systematic bias toward the DM core\nconfigurations. To address this, we therefore introduce the DM radius span\n$\\Delta R_\\chi \\equiv R_{\\chi,\\mathrm{max}} - R_{\\chi,\\mathrm{min}}$ as a\nunified diagnostic for DM distributions. This parameter simultaneously\ncharacterizes core-halo transition features while exhibiting strong linear\ncorrelations ($\\Delta R_\\chi < 4\\,\\mathrm{km}$) with both DM and BM parameters,\nproviding a clear avenue for future constraints. Our approach bridges current\nlimitations and future potential in probing DM through compact star\nobservations.",

The corresponding primal\noptimization model has been researched in several recent works. However, its\ndual problem is a more challenging topic that has not been well addressed. One\npossible reason is that the Fenchel conjugate of any indicator function is\nfinite only at the origin. This work aims to explore the dual optimization for\nthe sum of a strongly convex function and a composite term with indicator\nfunctions on positive intervals. For the first time, a dual problem is\nconstructed by extending the classic conjugate subgradient property to the\nindicator function. This extension further helps us establish the equivalence\nbetween the primal and dual solutions. The dual problem turns out to be a\nsparse optimization with a $\\ell_0$ regularizer and a nonnegative constraint.\nThe proximal operator of the sparse regularizer is used to identify a dual\nsubspace to implement gradient and/or semismooth Newton iteration with low\ncomputational complexity. This gives rise to a dual Newton-type method with\nboth global convergence and local superlinear (or quadratic) convergence rate\nunder mild conditions. Finally, when applied to AUC maximization and sparse\nmulti-label classification, our dual Newton method demonstrates satisfactory\nperformance on computational speed and accuracy.",

We analyzed over 260 edits per dataset, and identified two editing\npatterns: one where students refined introductory units repeatedly before\nprogressing, and another where they quickly shifted to extensive edits in body\nunits (e.g., topic and supporting sentences). MLR analyses revealed that the\nnumber of AI-generated words positively predicted all score dimensions, while\nmost editing variables showed minimal impact.

However, its direct use in training\ndeep models that are sensitive to fine-grained atomic geometry, such as inverse\nfolding, exposes a critical limitation. Comparative analysis of structural\nfeature distributions reveals that AFDB structures exhibit distinct statistical\nregularities, reflecting a systematic geometric bias that deviates from the\nconformational diversity found in experimentally determined structures from the\nProtein Data Bank (PDB). While AFDB structures are cleaner and more idealized,\nPDB structures capture the intrinsic variability and physical realism essential\nfor generalization in downstream tasks. To address this discrepancy, we\nintroduce a Debiasing Structure AutoEncoder (DeSAE) that learns to reconstruct\nnative-like conformations from intentionally corrupted backbone geometries. By\ntraining the model to recover plausible structural states, DeSAE implicitly\ncaptures a more robust and natural structural manifold. At inference, applying\nDeSAE to AFDB structures produces debiased structures that significantly\nimprove inverse folding performance across multiple benchmarks.

In this work, we propose\na principled causal-attribution framework for identifying behavior-relevant\nattention heads in transformers.

Our pilot study highlights this gap, showing that\neven state-of-the-art models perform only marginally better than simplistic\nbaselines on implicit semantics tasks.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) can face factual limitations when responding to\ntime-sensitive queries about recent events that arise after their knowledge\nthresholds in the training corpus. Existing search-augmented approaches fall\ninto two categories, each with distinct limitations: multi-agent search\nframeworks incur substantial computational overhead by separating search\nplanning and response synthesis across multiple LLMs, while single-LLM\ntool-calling methods restrict themselves to sequential planned, single-query\nsearches from sole search sources. We present Reasoning-Search (R-Search), a\nsingle-LLM search framework that unifies multi-step planning, multi-source\nsearch execution, and answer synthesis within one coherent inference process.\nInnovatively, it structure the output into four explicitly defined components,\nincluding reasoning steps that guide the search process (<think>), a\nnatural-language directed acyclic graph that represents the search plans with\nrespect to diverse sources (<search>), retrieved results from executing the\nsearch plans (<result>), and synthesized final answers (<answer>). To enable\neffective generation of these structured outputs, we propose a specialized\nReinforcement Fine-Tuning (ReFT) method based on GRPO, together with a\nmulti-component reward function that optimizes LLM's answer correctness,\nstructural validity of the generated DAG, and adherence to the defined output\nformat. Experimental evaluation on FinSearchBench-24, SearchExpertBench-25, and\nseven Q and A benchmarks demonstrates that R-Search outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods, while achieving substantial efficiency gains through\n70% reduction in context token usage and approximately 50% decrease in\nexecution latency.

Differential Privacy (DP) offers a principled approach for\nquantifying privacy risks, with DP-SGD emerging as a standard mechanism for\nprivate model training. However, directly applying DP-SGD to relational\nlearning is challenging due to two key factors: (i) entities often participate\nin multiple relations, resulting in high and difficult-to-control sensitivity;\nand (ii) relational learning typically involves multi-stage, potentially\ncoupled (interdependent) sampling procedures that make standard privacy\namplification analyses inapplicable.

Recently,\nthe security of these technologies has been revealed to be susceptible to\nbackdoor attacks. Specifically, attackers use noisy disruption triggers and\nspeech element triggers to produce poisoned speech samples that train models to\nbecome vulnerable. However, these methods typically create only a limited\nnumber of backdoors due to the inherent constraints of the trigger function. In\nthis paper, we propose that speech backdoor attacks can strategically focus on\nspeech elements such as timbre and emotion, leveraging the Speech Large\nLanguage Model (SLLM) to generate diverse triggers. Increasing the number of\ntriggers may disproportionately elevate the poisoning rate, resulting in higher\nattack costs and a lower success rate per trigger. We introduce the Multiple\nGradient Descent Algorithm (MGDA) as a mitigation strategy to address this\nchallenge. The proposed attack is called the Speech Prompt Backdoor Attack\n(SPBA). Building on this foundation, we conducted attack experiments on two\nspeech classification tasks, demonstrating that SPBA shows significant trigger\neffectiveness and achieves exceptional performance in attack metrics.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion models, formulated as discretizations of stochastic differential\nequations (SDEs), achieve state-of-the-art generative performance. However,\nexisting analyses of their discretization error often rely on complex\nprobabilistic tools. In this work, we present a simplified theoretical\nframework for analyzing the Euler--Maruyama discretization of\nvariance-preserving SDEs (VP-SDEs) in Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models\n(DDPMs), where $ T $ denotes the number of denoising steps in the diffusion\nprocess. Our approach leverages Gr\\\"onwall's inequality to derive a convergence\nrate of $ \\mathcal{O}(1/T^{1/2}) $ under Lipschitz assumptions, significantly\nstreamlining prior proofs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Gaussian noise\nin the discretization can be replaced by a discrete random variable (e.g.,\nRademacher or uniform noise) without sacrificing convergence guarantees-an\ninsight with practical implications for efficient sampling. Experiments\nvalidate our theory, showing that (1) the error scales as predicted, (2)\ndiscrete noise achieves comparable sample quality to Gaussian noise, and (3)\nincorrect noise scaling degrades performance. By unifying simplified analysis\nand discrete noise substitution, our work bridges theoretical rigor with\npractical efficiency in diffusion-based generative modeling.",

    "abstract": "Despite their growing adoption across domains, large language model\n(LLM)-powered agents face significant security risks from backdoor attacks\nduring training and fine-tuning. These compromised agents can subsequently be\nmanipulated to execute malicious operations when presented with specific\ntriggers in their inputs or environments. To address this pressing risk, we\npresent ReAgent, a novel defense against a range of backdoor attacks on\nLLM-based agents. Intuitively, backdoor attacks often result in inconsistencies\namong the user's instruction, the agent's planning, and its execution. Drawing\non this insight, ReAgent employs a two-level approach to detect potential\nbackdoors. At the execution level, ReAgent verifies consistency between the\nagent's thoughts and actions; at the planning level, ReAgent leverages the\nagent's capability to reconstruct the instruction based on its thought\ntrajectory, checking for consistency between the reconstructed instruction and\nthe user's instruction. Extensive evaluation demonstrates ReAgent's\neffectiveness against various backdoor attacks across tasks. For instance,\nReAgent reduces the attack success rate by up to 90\\% in database operation\ntasks, outperforming existing defenses by large margins. This work reveals the\npotential of utilizing compromised agents themselves to mitigate backdoor\nrisks.",

It is shown clearly that a long-range\ncharge-order state with\n  spontaneously broken chiral symmetry emerges in the weak and moderate\ninteraction regimes, as\n  well as a presumed site-selected topological Mott insulator state in the\nstronger interaction regime\n  with U < UMott, where UMott is the critical interaction strength, and in the\ncase of U > UMott,\n  the system is transited into the usual topological Mott state. This new\ncharge-order state has\n  lower energy compared to the usual topological band insulator (TBI) state\nwith chiral symmetry,\n  and thus is named as non-chiral TBI state. More specifically, in this\nnon-chiral TBI state without\n  any long-range magnetic order, a long-range charge order with different\nelectron occupation on\n  two sublattices appears in the absence of external sublattice field. The\nspontaneously broken chiral\n  symmetry gives rise to a special helical edge state, which has different spin\naccumulation on opposite\n  edges of the cylinder with periodic boundary condition in the zigzag\ndirection, and thus leads to\n  a net spin current across the system. This net spin current would be further\nstrengthened if the\n  nearest neighbor electron Coulomb interaction is taken into account as well,\nbecause it is favorable\n  for the long-range charge order with different electron occupation on\nsublattices.",

A data-enable framework called DEKC which contains offline\ntraining part and online execution part is proposed to deploy tethered space\nrobot in the presence of uncertainty. The main idea of this work is modeling\nthe unknown uncertainty as a dynamical system, which enables high accuracy and\nconvergence of capturing uncertainty. The core part of proposed framework is a\nproxy model of uncertainty, which is derived from data-driven Koopman theory\nand is separated with controller design. In the offline stage, the lifting\nfunctions associated with Koopman operator are parameterized with deep neural\nnetworks. Then by solving an optimization problem, the lifting functions are\nlearned from sampling data. In the online execution stage, the proxy model\ncooperates the learned lifting functions obtained in the offline phase to\ncapture the unknown uncertainty. Then the output of proxy model is compensated\nto the baseline controller such that the effect of uncertainty can be\nattenuated or even eliminated. Furthermore, considering some scenarios in which\nthe performance of proxy model may weaken, a receding-horizon scheme is\nproposed to update the proxy model online. Finally, the extensive numerical\nsimulations demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.

Gradual generation in theory comes with many conceptual\nbenefits; for example, inductive biases can be incorporated into the noising\nMarkov process, and access to improved sampling algorithms. In practice,\nhowever, the consistently best performing discrete diffusion model is,\nsurprisingly, masking diffusion, which does not denoise gradually. Here we\nexplain the superior performance of masking diffusion by noting that it makes\nuse of a fundamental difference between continuous and discrete Markov\nprocesses: discrete Markov processes evolve by discontinuous jumps at a fixed\nrate and, unlike other discrete diffusion models, masking diffusion builds in\nthe known distribution of jump times and only learns where to jump to. We show\nthat we can similarly bake in the known distribution of jump times into any\ndiscrete diffusion model. The resulting models - schedule-conditioned discrete\ndiffusion (SCUD) - generalize classical discrete diffusion and masking\ndiffusion. By applying SCUD to models with noising processes that incorporate\ninductive biases on images, text, and protein data, we build models that\noutperform masking.",

To overcome these limitations, we introduce\nRule-Driven Approach for Attribute Embedding (RAE), a novel methodology that\nenhances recommendation performance by effectively mining and utilizing\nsemantic rules from property graphs. RAE applies a rule-mining process to\nextract meaningful rules that guide random walks in generating enriched\nattribute embeddings. These enriched embeddings are subsequently integrated\ninto GCNs, surpassing conventional triple-based embedding techniques. We\nevaluate RAE on real-world datasets (e.g., Blogcatalog and Flickr) and\ndemonstrate that RAE achieves an average improvement of 10.6% in both Recall@20\nand NDCG@20 compared to state-of-the-art baselines, indicating superior\nrelevance coverage and ranking rationality in top-20 recommendations.\nAdditionally, RAE exhibits enhanced robustness against data sparsity and the\nattribute missingness problem.

Hence, we aim to develop Learnable\nSpatial-Temporal Positional Encoding in an effective and efficient manner and\npropose a simple temporal link prediction model named L-STEP. Briefly, for\nL-STEP, we (1) prove the proposed positional learning scheme can preserve the\ngraph property from the spatial-temporal spectral viewpoint, (2) verify that\nMLPs can fully exploit the expressiveness and reach transformers' performance\non that encoding, (3) change different initial positional encoding inputs to\nshow robustness, (4) analyze the theoretical complexity and obtain less\nempirical running time than SOTA, and (5) demonstrate its temporal link\nprediction out-performance on 13 classic datasets and with 10 algorithms in\nboth transductive and inductive settings using 3 different sampling strategies.\nAlso, L-STEP obtains the leading performance in the newest large-scale TGB\nbenchmark.

The BdG\nequation is essentially a constrained eigenvalue/eigenfunction system. Firstly,\nwe investigate its analytical properties, including exact eigenpairs,\ngeneralized nullspace, and bi-orthogonality of eigenspaces. Secondly, by\ncombining the standard Fourier spectral method for spatial discretization and a\nstable Gram-Schmidt bi-orthogonal algorithm, we develop a subspace iterative\nsolver for such a large-scale dense eigenvalue problem, and it proves to be\nnumerically stable, efficient, and accurate. Our solver is matrix-free and the\noperator-function evaluation is accelerated by discrete Fast Fourier Transform\n(FFT) with almost optimal efficiency. Therefore, it is memory-friendly and\nefficient for large-scale problems. Furthermore, we give a rigorous and\ndetailed numerical analysis on the stability and spectral convergence. Finally,\nwe present extensive numerical results to illustrate the spectral accuracy and\nefficiency, and investigate the excitation spectrum and Bogoliubov amplitudes\naround the ground state in 1-3 spatial dimensions.",

We provide code to\neasily access the data and benchmark seven lossless compression methods (three\nneural and four non-neural, including all practical state-of-the-art\nalgorithms).

Even in the absence of spatially synchronized exogenous\nforces, metapopulations may synchronize via dispersal. For many species, most\ndispersal is local, but rare long-distance dispersal events also occur. While\neven small amounts of long-range dispersal are known to be important for\nprocesses like invasion and spatial spread rates, their potential influence on\npopulation synchrony is often overlooked, since local dispersal on its own can\nbe strongly synchronizing. In this work, we investigate the effect of random,\nrare, long-range dispersal on the spatial synchrony of a metapopulation and\nfind profound effects not only on synchrony but also on properties of the\nresulting spatial patterns. While controlling for the overall amount of\nemigration from each local subpopulation, we vary the fraction of dispersal\nthat occurs locally (to nearest neighbors) versus globally (to random\nlocations, irrespective of distance). Using a metric that measures the\ninstantaneous level of global synchrony, we show that this form of long-range\ndispersal significantly favors the spatially synchronous state and homogenizes\nthe population by decreasing the size of clusters of subpopulations that are\nout of phase with the rest of the metapopulation. Moreover, the addition of\nnon-local dispersal significantly decreases the equilibration time of the\nmetapopulation.",

In the theoretical treatment,\none typically invokes semiclassical methods to describe the light-matter\ninteraction between quantum emitters, e.g., atoms or molecules, and a strong\ncoherent laser field. However, these semiclassical approaches struggle to\npredict the stochastic measurement fluctuations beyond the mean value,\nnecessary to predict the sensitivity of spectroscopic quantum sensing\nprotocols. Here, we develop a theoretical framework based on the recently\ndeveloped Photon-resolved Floquet theory (PRFT) which is capable to predict the\nmeasurement statistics describing higher order statistics of coherent quantum\nstates of light. The PRFT constructs flow equations for the cumulants of the\nphotonic measurement statistics utilizing only the semiclassical dynamics of\nthe matter system. We apply the PRFT to spectroscopic quantum sensing using\ndissipative two-level and four-level systems (describing electric field sensing\nwith Rydberg atoms), and demonstrate how to calculate the Fisher information of\nthe measurement statistics with respect to various system parameters. In doing\nso, we demonstrate that the PRFT is a flexible tool allowing to improve the\nsensitivity of spectroscopic quantum sensing devices by several orders of\nmagnitudes.",
