This study evaluated a non-destructive method\ncombining sequential 3D reconstructions from RGB images and machine learning to\nestimate TLA for three dwarf tomato cultivars: Mohamed, Hahms Gelbe Topftomate,\nand Red Robin -- grown under controlled greenhouse conditions. Two experiments\n(spring-summer and autumn-winter) included 73 plants, yielding 418 TLA\nmeasurements via an \"onion\" approach. High-resolution videos were recorded, and\n500 frames per plant were used for 3D reconstruction. Point clouds were\nprocessed using four algorithms (Alpha Shape, Marching Cubes, Poisson's, Ball\nPivoting), and meshes were evaluated with seven regression models:\nMultivariable Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, Elastic\nNet Regression, Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting, and Multilayer\nPerceptron. The Alpha Shape reconstruction ($\\alpha = 3$) with Extreme Gradient\nBoosting achieved the best performance ($R^2 = 0.80$, $MAE = 489 cm^2$).\nCross-experiment validation showed robust results ($R^2 = 0.56$, $MAE = 579\ncm^2$).

Recently,\nacetone ice has been reported as (tentatively) detected toward B1-c, which\nenables the gas-to-ice comparison of its abundances. The detection of acetone\nice warrants a more systematic study of its gaseous abundances which is\ncurrently lacking. Therefore, we conducted systematic measurements of acetone\ngas in a dozen hot cores observed by the CoCCoA survey and investigate the\nchemical evolution from ice to gas of acetone in protostellar systems. We fit\nthe ALMA spectra to determined the column density, excitation temperature, and\nline width of acetone, along with propanal (C2H5CHO), ketene (CH2CO), and\npropyne (CH3CCH), which might be chemically linked with acetone. We found that\nthe observed gas abundances of acetone are surprisingly high compared to those\nof two-carbon O-COMs, while aldehydes are overall less abundant than other\nO-COMs (e.g., alcohols, ethers, and esters). This may suggest specific\nformation or destruction mechanisms that favor the production of ethers,\nesters, and ketones over aldehydes. The derived physical properties suggest\nthat acetone, propanal, and ketene have the same origin from hot cores as other\nO-COMs, while propyne tends to trace the more extended outflows. The\nacetone-to-methanol ratios are higher in ice than in gas by one order of\nmagnitude, hinting at gas-phase reprocessing after sublimation. There are\nseveral suggested formation pathways of acetone (in both ice and gas) from\nacetaldehyde (CH3CHO), ketene, and propylene (C3H6).

We propose a detailed analysis\nof the galaxy evolution to disentangle the relationship between the two\nfirst-ranked galaxies in CGs throughout their history as a function of the\nassembly channels of their hosts. Our study was performed from a\nsemi-analytical point of view, using more than 20000 CGs. We based our analysis\non studying the first- (1R) and second-ranked (2R) galaxies in CGs, where the\nranking is determined using the galaxy stellar mass. The 1R galaxies have\nsignificantly reduced their star-forming capacity over time, reaching a\nquenching stage and often becoming bulge-dominated or elliptical. Notably, this\ntransformation occurred earlier for 1R galaxies in early-formed CGs (around 5\nto 8 Gyrs ago), while those in recently-formed CGs experienced this change more\nrecently (around 2 to 3 Gyrs ago). The analysis of the time evolution of a\nvariant of the Tremaine & Richstone statistics showed that the 1R galaxy in\nearly-formed CGs began to stand out for its dominant properties around 6 Gyrs\nago, almost 5 Gyrs earlier than the 1R inhabiting recently formed CGs. We\nobserved that a large majority of the 1R galaxies have experienced at least one\nmajor merger event during their life, while we observed this only for a third\nof 2R galaxies. The 1R galaxies can also display several of these events and\nmost of their last major merger events can be described as the addition of a\nprogenitor that is the second most massive galaxy in their surroundings at the\ntime of the merger. We find that the semi-analytical framework explored in this\nwork describes a scenario where galaxy mergers are the main driving force in\nshaping the properties of the 1R galaxies in CGs. We note that this scenario is\nespecially intensive when those galaxies inhabit CGs that had formed early on.",

RL agents learn by\nperiodically conducting computationally expensive gradient updates. When\ndecision-making and gradient update tasks are carried out sequentially by the\nRL agent in a physical robot, it significantly increases the agent's response\ntime. In a rapidly changing environment, this increased response time may be\ndetrimental to the performance of the learning agent.

For this\nreason, the exact performance benefits of using asynchronous RL methods over\nsynchronous RL methods are still unclear. In this study, we provide a\nperformance comparison between asynchronous and synchronous RL using a physical\nrobotic arm called Franka Emika Panda. Our experiments show that the agents\nlearn faster and attain significantly more returns using asynchronous RL.

It is straightforward to improve the $(4k-5)$-stretch of\nthe handshake to $\\approx3.68k$-stretch using the compact routing scheme of\nChechik [PODC'13]. We improve the handshake stretch to the optimal $(2k-1)$, by\nborrowing the concept of roundtrip routing from directed graphs to\n\\textit{undirected} graphs.\n  \\textit{For weighted directed graphs}, more than two decades ago, Roditty,\nThorup, and Zwick [SODA'02 and TALG'08] presented a $(4k+\\eps)$-stretch compact\nroundtrip routing scheme that uses $\\tilde{O}(n^{1/k})$ local storage for every\n$k\\ge 3$. For $k=3$, this gives a $(12+\\eps)$-roundtrip stretch using\n$\\tilde{O}(n^{1/3})$ local storage. We improve the stretch by developing a\n$7$-roundtrip stretch routing scheme with $\\tilde{O}(n^{1/3})$ local storage.",

To address this, we introduce FedVSR, the first FL\nframework specifically designed for VSR. It is model-agnostic and stateless,\nand introduces a lightweight loss function based on the DWT to better preserve\nhigh-frequency details during local training. Additionally, a loss-aware\naggregation strategy combines both DWT-based and task-specific losses to guide\nglobal updates effectively.

Specifically, we propose a self-supervised\nlearning framework, consisting of an encoder-decoder model and a\nself-supervised pretext task, cross-view image synchronization, which aims to\ndistinguish whether two images from different views are captured at the same\ntime. The model encodes each person's unified geometric and appearance\nfeatures, and we train it by utilizing synchronization labels for supervision\nafter applying Hungarian matching to bridge the gap between instance-wise and\nimage-wise distances. To further reduce the solution space, we propose two\ntypes of self-supervised linear constraints: multi-view re-projection and\npairwise edge association. Extensive experiments on three challenging public\nbenchmark datasets (WILDTRACK, MVOR, and SOLDIERS) show that our approach\nachieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing existing unsupervised and\nfully-supervised approaches.

Despite\ntheir widespread occurrence, there remains a gap in modeling particle\npropagation through these complex structures from a molecular communication\n(MC) perspective. This paper introduces a generalized analytical framework for\nmodeling diffusion-based molecular communication in multi-layered spherical\nenvironments. The framework is capable of supporting an arbitrary number of\nlayers and flexible transmitter-receiver positioning. As an example, the\ndetailed formulation is presented for the three-layer sphere, which is\nparticularly relevant for different biological models such as tumor spheroids.\nThe analytical results are validated using particle-based simulation (PBS) in\nscenarios that have short inter-layer distances. The findings reveal that the\ncharacteristics of each layer significantly impact molecule propagation\nthroughout the entire structure, making their consideration crucial for\ndesigning targeted therapies and optimizing drug delivery systems.",

However, despite optical and radio\nobservations indicate a clear multiple merger, the X-ray emission of the\ncluster, derived from XMM-Newton observations, shows only moderate disturbance.\nWe present new 200 ks Chandra observations of PLCKG287. We detect a shock front\nto the NW direction at a distance of ~390 kpc from the X-ray peak,\ncharacterized by a Mach number M~1.3, as well as a cold front at a distance of\n~300 kpc from the X-ray peak, nested in the same direction of the shock in a\ntypical configuration expected by a merger. We also find evidence for X-ray\ndepressions to the E and W, that could be the signature of feedback from the\nactive galactic nucleus (AGN). The radial profile of the thermodynamic\nquantities show a temperature and abundance peak in the cluster center, where\nalso the pressure and entropy have a rapid increase. Based on these properties,\nwe argue that PLCKG287 is what remains of a cool core after a heating event. We\nestimate that both the shock energy and the AGN feedback energy, implied by the\nanalysis of the X-ray cavities, are sufficient to heat the core to the observed\ntemperature of ~17 keV in the central ~160 kpc. We discuss the possible origin\nof the detected shock by investigating alternative scenarios of merger and AGN\noutburst, finding that they are both energetically viable. However, no single\nmodel seems able to explain all the X-ray features detected in this system.\nThis suggests that the combined action of merger and central AGN feedback is\nlikely necessary to explain the reheated cool core, the large-scale shock and\nthe cold front. The synergy of these two processes may act in shaping the\ndistribution of cool core and non cool core clusters. [Abridged]",

By developing a generalized optimal transport theory for open\nquantum systems, we rigorously establish the relationship between the minimum\ntransport time and the source-target distance, and investigate the maximal\ntransportable distance of bosons. We demonstrate that optimal transport\nexhibits a fundamental distinction depending on whether the system experiences\none-body loss or multi-body loss.

    "abstract": "Training robust deep video representations has proven to be computationally\nchallenging due to substantial decoding overheads, the enormous size of raw\nvideo streams, and their inherent high temporal redundancy. Different from\nexisting schemes, operating exclusively in the compressed video domain and\nexploiting all freely available modalities, i.e., I-frames, and P-frames\n(motion vectors and residuals) offers a compute-efficient alternative. Existing\nmethods approach this task as a naive multi-modality problem, ignoring the\ntemporal correlation and implicit sparsity across P-frames for modeling\nstronger shared representations for videos of the same action, making training\nand generalization easier. By revisiting the high-level design of dominant\nvideo understanding backbones, we increase inference speed by a factor of $56$\nwhile retaining similar performance. For this, we propose a hybrid end-to-end\nframework that factorizes learning across three key concepts to reduce\ninference cost by $330\\times$ versus prior art: First, a specially designed\ndual-encoder scheme with efficient Spiking Temporal Modulators to minimize\nlatency while retaining cross-domain feature aggregation. Second, a unified\ntransformer model to capture inter-modal dependencies using global\nself-attention to enhance I-frame -- P-frame contextual interactions.

The\nstaggered layer design with pixelated scintillators enables the determination\nof the gamma's depth of interaction and facilitates an iteration-free\nformulation of the MLP algorithm. The efficacy of the algorithm optimization\nwas tested on a scintillation detector block designed for an ultra-high field\nBrainPET 7T, comprising three scintillator pixel layers. The three layers\ncontain 24 x 24, 24 x 23 and 23 x 22 scintillator pixels, respectively, with a\npixel pitch of 2 mm in both directions and layer thicknesses of 9, 8 and 7 mm.\nCalibration measurements, in combination with an automated calibration script,\nwere used to obtain the expected counts of scintillation photons required in\nthe MLP algorithm. Using Single-Instruction-Multiple-Data parallelization,\nmulti-threading and optimized cache lines, a maximum processing speed of\napproximately 22.5 million singles per second was achieved on a platform with\nfour Intel Xeon Platinum 8168 CPUs and 60 threads, encompassing all required\nprocessing steps. The automatic calibration failed for 1 to 15 individual\nscintillator pixels in approximately 10 per cent of the 120 scintillation\ndetector blocks, necessitating manual correction. After applying the energy\ncorrection to the positioned single events, an energy resolution of of 12 +/- 2\nper cent FWHM was obtained for the entire scintillation block. This value is\nvery close to the energy resolutions measured for the individual scintillator\npixels, proving that the MLP accurately identifies the scintillating pixel and\nthat the energy correction method effectively compensates for the light\ncollection variations of the SiPM array.",

However, such methods primarily emphasize\nbroadening the receptive field in textureless areas, while neglecting\ndeformation instability caused by easily overlooked edge-skipping, potentially\nleading to matching distortions. To address this, we propose SED-MVS, which\nadopts panoptic segmentation and multi-trajectory diffusion strategy for\nsegmentation-driven and edge-aligned patch deformation. Specifically, to\nprevent unanticipated edge-skipping, we first employ SAM2 for panoptic\nsegmentation as depth-edge guidance to guide patch deformation, followed by\nmulti-trajectory diffusion strategy to ensure patches are comprehensively\naligned with depth edges. Moreover, to avoid potential inaccuracy of random\ninitialization, we combine both sparse points from LoFTR and monocular depth\nmap from DepthAnything V2 to restore reliable and realistic depth map for\ninitialization and supervised guidance. Finally, we integrate segmentation\nimage with monocular depth map to exploit inter-instance occlusion\nrelationship, then further regard them as occlusion map to implement two\ndistinct edge constraint, thereby facilitating occlusion-aware patch\ndeformation. Extensive results on ETH3D, Tanks & Temples, BlendedMVS and\nStrecha datasets validate the state-of-the-art performance and robust\ngeneralization capability of our proposed method.",

While it can be defined as a dimensional reduction of 3D\nCS theory, it is also equivalent to JT gravity. Moreover, further holographic\nsettings relate BF theory to a particle on group theory. Here, we reconsider\nthis \"simplest holography\" construction as SL(2,R) invariant particle on group\ntheory and extend the web of dualities diagram in terms of a holographic\ndescription of the 2D N=1 BF theory on half-plane and find its 1D particle on\ngroup description as N=1B supermultiplet superconformal quantum mechanics.\nMoreover, we provide wedge space holography-type construction to achieve\ncodimension 2 holography and show the web of dualities diagram also closes\ndiagonally for BF and CS theories. For BF theory it leads to a complex 1D\nparticle on group mechanics on the face of the wedge, a 0D quantum mechanics on\nthe boundary theory of the faces, and its supersymmetric extension is a\nsupermultiplet containing complex boson and complex scalar of the\nLandau-Ginzburg type. Upon this construction boundary theory also realizes a\nglobal U_j(1) invariance which extends the total symmetry group. To have a more\ncomplete picture we also included wedge space holography for 3D CS theory as an\nappendix and showed its codimension 2 holography corresponds to a 1D particle\non group we found earlier.",

We detect marginally significant\npolarization in the combined data set in the full 2--8 keV energy band, with a\npolarization degree (PD) of 3.0+-1.1% and polarization angle (PA) of -18\ndegrees. The energy-resolved analysis shows a clear energy dependence of the\npolarization properties, with a remarkable ~70 degrees switch in PA between low\nand high energies. Similarly, the pulse phase-resolved spectro-polarimetric\nanalysis reveals different signatures at low and high energies. At low (2--3\nkeV) energies, the PD ranges between ~2% and ~18%, with the PA varying between\n-16 and 70 degrees. At higher (4--8 keV) energies, the PD varies between ~3%\nand ~12%, with a drastically different PA behavior. Fitting the rotating vector\nmodel to the pulse phase dependence of the PA at the lower energies, we\nconstrain the geometric configuration of the pulsar. The analysis favors a high\nspin-axis inclination of >50 which agrees with both previous\npulse-phase-dependent spectral fitting of the cyclotron line region and the\nknown high orbital inclination of the binary system. The magnetic obliquity is\nestimated to be 30 degrees and the spin position angle to be 19 degrees. A\nsharp switch in PA around 3 keV presents a particular theoretical challenge, as\nit is not consistent with the right-angle switch that was only seen in one\nother pulsar Vela X-1.",

By\nsystematically tracking how prior data and successive judgements inform final\nrankings, BCJ clarifies the assessment process and helps identify assessor\ndisagreements. Multi-criteria BCJ extends this by evaluating multiple learning\noutcomes (LOs) independently, preserving the richness of CJ while producing\ntransparent, granular rankings aligned with specific assessment goals. It also\nenables a holistic ranking derived from individual LOs, ensuring comprehensive\nevaluations without compromising detailed feedback.\n  Using a real higher education dataset with professional markers in the UK, we\ndemonstrate BCJ's quantitative rigour and ability to clarify ranking\nrationales. Through qualitative analysis and discussions with experienced CJ\npractitioners, we explore its effectiveness in contexts where transparency is\ncrucial, such as high-stakes national assessments.

    "abstract": "The phenomenon of cell sorting/segregation, by which cells organise spatially\ninto clusters of specific cell type or function, is essential for tissue\nmorphogenesis. This self-organization process involves an interplay between\nmechanical, biochemical, and cellular mechanisms that act across various\nspatial and temporal scales. Several mechanisms for cell sorting have been\nproposed; however, the physical nature of these mechanisms and how they lead to\nsymmetric or asymmetric cell sorting remains unclear. Here, using experimental\ndata from cocultures of genetically modified Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK293)\ncells and numerical simulations, we show the existence of a cell sorting\nmechanism based on transient increases in the persistence of motion of cells.\nThis mechanism is activated on cells overexpressing the ephrinB1-related\nreceptor EphB2 after their interaction with cells overexpressing ephrinB1. We\nshow that this mechanism is sufficient to cause cell sorting, breaking the\nsymmetry of the sorting dynamics, and show that the duration of this transient\ndifferential persistence state is optimal for enhancing sorting. Furthermore,\nwe show that in combination with other interaction mechanisms, such as changes\nin direction-also known as contact inhibition of locomotion-and adhesion\nforces, differential persistence significantly reduces the timescale of\nsorting. Our findings offer insights into the behaviour of cell mixtures, the\nrelevance of non-reciprocal interactions, and may provide insight into\ndevelopmental processes and tissue patterning.",

    "abstract": "Photo-realistic rendering and novel view synthesis play a crucial role in\nhuman-computer interaction tasks, from gaming to path planning. Neural Radiance\nFields (NeRFs) model scenes as continuous volumetric functions and achieve\nremarkable rendering quality. However, NeRFs often struggle in large,\nlow-textured areas, producing cloudy artifacts known as ''floaters'' that\nreduce scene realism, especially in indoor environments with featureless\narchitectural surfaces like walls, ceilings, and floors. To overcome this\nlimitation, prior work has integrated geometric constraints into the NeRF\npipeline, typically leveraging depth information derived from Structure from\nMotion or Multi-View Stereo. Yet, conventional RGB-feature correspondence\nmethods face challenges in accurately estimating depth in textureless regions,\nleading to unreliable constraints. This challenge is further complicated in\n360-degree ''inside-out'' views, where sparse visual overlap between adjacent\nimages further hinders depth estimation. In order to address these issues, we\npropose an efficient and robust method for computing dense depth priors,\nspecifically tailored for large low-textured architectural surfaces in indoor\nenvironments. We introduce a novel depth loss function to enhance rendering\nquality in these challenging, low-feature regions, while complementary\ndepth-patch regularization further refines depth consistency across other\nareas.

    "abstract": "In a proof of knowledge (PoK), a verifier becomes convinced that a prover\npossesses privileged information. In combination with zero-knowledge proof\nsystems, PoKs play an important role in security protocols such as in digital\nsignatures and authentication schemes, as they enable a prover to demonstrate\npossession of certain information (such as a private key or a credential),\nwithout revealing it. A PoK is formally defined via the existence of an\nextractor, which is capable of reconstructing the key information that makes a\nverifier accept, given oracle access to any accepting prover. We extend this\nconcept to the setting of a single classical verifier and multiple quantum\nprovers and present the first statistical zero-knowledge (ZK) PoK proof system\nfor problems in QMA. To achieve this, we establish the PoK property for the ZK\nprotocol of Broadbent, Mehta, and Zhao (TQC 2024), which applies to the local\nHamiltonian problem. More specifically, we construct an extractor which, given\noracle access to a provers' strategy that leads to high acceptance probability,\nis able to reconstruct the ground state of a local Hamiltonian. Our result can\nbe seen as a new form of self-testing, where, in addition to certifying a\npre-shared entangled state, the verifier also certifies that a prover has\naccess to a quantum system, in particular, a ground state; this indicates a new\nlevel of verification for a proof of quantumness.",

    "abstract": "Traditionally, experimental effects on humans are investigated at the group\nlevel. In this work, we present a distributional ``spotlight'' to investigate\nexperimental effects at the individual level. Specifically, we estimate the\neffects on individuals through the changes in the probability distributions of\ntheir experimental data across conditions. We test this approach on Reaction\nTime (RT) data from 10 individuals in a visual search task, examining the\neffects of (1) information set sizes and (2) the presence or absence of a\ntarget on their processing speed. The changes in individuals' RT distributions\nare measured using three approaches: (i) direct measurements of distributional\nchanges are compared against the changes captured by two established models of\nRT: (ii) the ex-Gaussian distribution and (iii) the Drift-Diffusion model. We\nfind that direct measurement of distributional changes provides the clearest\nview of the effects on individuals and highlights the presence of two\nsub-groups based on the effects experienced: one that shows neither effect and\nthe other showing only the target-presence effect. Moreover, the\nintra-individual changes across conditions (i.e., the experimental effects)\nappear much smaller than the inter-individual differences (i.e., the random\neffects). Generally, these results highlight the merits of going beyond group\nmeans and examining the effects on individuals, as well as the effectiveness of\nthe distributional spotlight in such pursuits.",

Furthermore, the annotation\nprocess for this task is labor-intensive, requiring extensive manual labeling\nacross modalities and temporal segments, limiting the scalability of current\nmethods. Current state-of-the-art models ignore the shifts in event\ndistributions over time, reducing their ability to adjust to changing video\ndynamics. Additionally, previous methods rely on late fusion to combine audio\nand visual information. While straightforward, this approach results in a\nsignificant loss of multimodal interactions. To address these challenges, we\npropose Audio-Visual Adaptive Video Analysis ($\\text{AV}^2\\text{A}$), a\nmodel-agnostic approach that requires no further training and integrates a\nscore-level fusion technique to retain richer multimodal interactions.\n$\\text{AV}^2\\text{A}$ also includes a within-video label shift algorithm,\nleveraging input video data and predictions from prior frames to dynamically\nadjust event distributions for subsequent frames.

We analyze the connection between\nabstract minions, which can be described as functors from the category of\nfinite ordinals to sets, and concrete minions, which are sets $\\mathrm{Pol}(A,\nB)$ of polymorphisms $A^k \\to B$ between relational structures $A$ and $B$. The\nfunctorial structure arises because a function $\\alpha\\colon n \\to k$\ntransforms an $n$-ary polymorphism $f\\colon A^n \\to B$ to the polymorphism\n$(x_0, \\ldots, x_{k-1}) \\mapsto f(x_{\\alpha (0)}, \\ldots, x_{\\alpha (n-1)})$.\nThis data is relevant to the constraint satisfaction problems over finite\ndomain, because minion homomorphisms $\\mathrm{Pol}(A, B) \\to \\mathrm{Pol}(A',\nB')$ give rise to log-space reductions from the promise constraint satisfaction\nproblem $\\mathrm{PCSP}(A', B')$ to $\\mathrm{PCSP}(A, B)$. Thus, they are\nvaluable to understand the homomorphism order of polymorphism minions over\nfinite-domain structures, especially since it is unknown whether the P vs. NP\ncomplexity dichotomy of constraint satisfaction problems extends to the more\ngeneralized promise setting.\n  Crucially, although implicitly used in some papers to solve nontrivial\nproblems, the concept of an abstract minion has not been exposed on so far,\neven though much is known about functor categories. The aim of this thesis is\nto start closing this gap, and to apply well-known constructions from category\ntheory to minions. Furthermore, we identify a condition under which an abstract\nminion can arise as a concrete one over a finite domain, and deduce that many\nconstructions remain stable under some of these concreteness assumptions. We\nwill conclude that some of the homomorphism orders in question are uncountable\ndistributive bounded lattices, and moreover (bi-) Heyting algebras.

    "abstract": "We study topological holography for 2+1-D gapped and gapless phases with\ngeneralized symmetries using tools from higher linear algebra and higher\ncondensation theory. We focus on bosonic fusion 2-category symmetries, where\nthe Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) are 3+1D Dijkgraaf-Witten\ntheories.\n  (1). Gapped phases are obtained from the sandwich construction with gapped\nsymmetry and physical boundaries. A gapped boundary of the 3+1D SymTFT is\ncalled minimal if it has no intrinsic 2+1-D topological order. We derive the\ngeneral structure of a sandwich construction with minimal gapped symmetry and\nphysical boundaries, including the underlying topological order and the\nsymmetry action. We also study some concrete examples with 2-group or\nnon-invertible symmetries.\n  (2). For gapless phases, we show that the SymTFT provides a complete\ndescription of the \\textit{topological skeleton} of a gapless phase. The\ntopological skeleton of a gapless phase is the higher categorical structure of\nits topological defects. We rigorously establish this relation for 2+1-D\ngapless phases with finite group symmetries. For a gapless phase with a finite\ngroup symmetry, its topological skeleton(also known as gapless SPT(gSPT)) can\nbe characterized by the decorated domain wall construction. We give a precise\nformulation of this using spectral sequence. We show that certain class of\ncondensable algebras in the SymTFT $\\mathcal{Z}_1[2\\mathbf{Vec}_G]$, which we\ncall minimal condensable algebras, has exactly the same structure. We further\ngive a cohomological classification of minimal condensable algebras, which\nenables us to compute the classification of 2+1-D $G$-gSPTs via ordinary group\ncohomology. Finally we use SymTFT to construct 2+1-D gSPT with generalized\nsymmetries, including an intrinsically gSPT(igSPT) with exact non-invertible\nfusion 2-category symmetry and anomalous 2-group IR symmetry.",

To address\nthis, we introduce FiVE, a Fine-grained Video Editing Benchmark for evaluating\nemerging diffusion and rectified flow models. Our benchmark includes 74\nreal-world videos and 26 generated videos, featuring 6 fine-grained editing\ntypes, 420 object-level editing prompt pairs, and their corresponding masks.\nAdditionally, we adapt the latest rectified flow (RF) T2V generation models,\nPyramid-Flow and Wan2.1, by introducing FlowEdit, resulting in training-free\nand inversion-free video editing models Pyramid-Edit and Wan-Edit. We evaluate\nfive diffusion-based and two RF-based editing methods on our FiVE benchmark\nusing 15 metrics, covering background preservation, text-video similarity,\ntemporal consistency, video quality, and runtime. To further enhance\nobject-level evaluation, we introduce FiVE-Acc, a novel metric leveraging\nVision-Language Models (VLMs) to assess the success of fine-grained video\nediting. Experimental results demonstrate that RF-based editing significantly\noutperforms diffusion-based methods, with Wan-Edit achieving the best overall\nperformance and exhibiting the least sensitivity to hyperparameters.

Such transformation facilitates the integration\nof the VNs of SCMA and low-density parity-check (LDPC), thereby emerging the\nSCMA and LDPC graphs into a SSG.

Our\nanalytical and numerical results, particularly for the $[[7^k,1,3^k]]$\nconcatenated Steane code, demonstrate exponential Bell pair savings and a\nhigher noise threshold. We establish theoretical lower bounds for local noise\nthreshold of $4.70\\times10^{-4}$ and an initial Bell pair infidelity threshold\nof $18.3\\%$. Our framework is adaptable to various quantum error-correcting\ncodes (QECCs) and experimental platforms. This work not only advances\nfault-tolerant nonlocal games but also inspires further research on interfacing\ndifferent QECCs, fostering modular quantum architectures and the quantum\ninternet.",

The first part of this study identified\nthe critical droplet size below which coalescence-induced jumping terminates,\ndeveloped a universal jumping mechanism for droplets of all types, explained a\nspecial phenomenon of jumping velocity becoming maximum before it approaches\nzero, and investigated how jumping terminates due to the size difference\nbetween droplets.

The second part of this study investigated the\njumping process of the merged droplet after the impact of a moving droplet upon\na stationary one. The impact velocity, droplet size, surface textures, and\nwettability are influential factors on the jumping velocity in this case.\nScaling laws for maximum spreading time, spreading factor, and restitution\ncoefficient are formulated based on the Weber (We) number and the Reynolds (Re)\nnumber. These laws differ from those established for single-droplet impacts.\nFor superhydrophobic surfaces, the spreading time is approximated by three\ntimes the droplet radius and impact velocity, and with the dimensionless\nspreading time, it exhibits a linear relationship with We 0.31. For both cases,\nthe jumping process is primarily governed by the energy available for\nconversion into the kinetic energy of the merged droplet following dissipation.\nFor the droplet impact case, the energy conversion efficiency becomes constant\nat high-impact droplet velocities.

This gap highlights the need to systematically analyze\nthe challenges hindering MAS effectiveness.\n  We present MAST (Multi-Agent System Failure Taxonomy), the first empirically\ngrounded taxonomy designed to understand MAS failures. We analyze seven popular\nMAS frameworks across over 200 tasks, involving six expert human annotators.\nThrough this process, we identify 14 unique failure modes, organized into 3\noverarching categories, (i) specification issues, (ii) inter-agent\nmisalignment, and (iii) task verification. MAST emerges iteratively from\nrigorous inter-annotator agreement studies, achieving a Cohen's Kappa score of\n0.88. To support scalable evaluation, we develop a validated LLM-as-a-Judge\npipeline integrated with MAST. We leverage two case studies to demonstrate\nMAST's practical utility in analyzing failures and guiding MAS development. Our\nfindings reveal that identified failures require more complex solutions,\nhighlighting a clear roadmap for future research.

We will consider a\nStern-Gerlach type apparatus to create macroscopic quantum superposition in a\nharmonic oscillator trap, and figure out the spin contrast loss due to linear\nspin-independent and spin-dependent noise in a single interferometer. We will\nshow that spin contrast loss due to spin-independent noise does not depend on\nthe initial thermal state of the matter wave function. However, spin contrast\nloss due to spin-dependent fluctuations do depend on the initial thermal\noccupation of the quantum state.

In contrast, developer communities on Stack\nOverflow (SO) provide an ever-evolving repository of knowledge, where security\nvulnerabilities are actively discussed and addressed through collective\nexpertise. These community-driven insights remain largely untapped by LLMs.\nThis paper introduces SOSecure, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system\nthat leverages the collective security expertise found in SO discussions to\nimprove the security of LLM-generated code. We build a security-focused\nknowledge base by extracting SO answers and comments that explicitly identify\nvulnerabilities. Unlike common uses of RAG, SOSecure triggers after code has\nbeen generated to find discussions that identify flaws in similar code. These\nare used in a prompt to an LLM to consider revising the code. Evaluation across\nthree datasets (SALLM, LLMSecEval, and LMSys) show that SOSecure achieves\nstrong fix rates of 71.7%, 91.3%, and 96.7% respectively, compared to prompting\nGPT-4 without relevant discussions (49.1%, 56.5%, and 37.5%), and outperforms\nmultiple other baselines.

These associations\ndegrade model accuracy by causing predictions to rely on incidental patterns\nrather than genuine visual understanding. Prior work has weaponized these\ncorrelations as an attack vector to manipulate model predictions, such as\ninserting a deceiving class text onto the image in a \"typographic\" attack.\nThese attacks succeed due to VLMs' text-heavy bias-a result of captions that\necho visible words rather than describing content. However, this attack has\nfocused solely on text that matches the target class exactly, overlooking a\nbroader range of correlations, including non-matching text and graphical\nsymbols, which arise from the abundance of branding content in web-scale data.\nTo address this gap, we introduce \"artifact-based\" attacks: a novel class of\nmanipulations that mislead models using both non-matching text and graphical\nelements. Unlike typographic attacks, these artifacts are not predefined,\nmaking them simultaneously harder to defend against and more challenging to\nfind. We address this by framing artifact attacks as a search problem and\ndemonstrate their effectiveness across five datasets, with some artifacts\nreinforcing each other to reach 100% attack success rates. These attacks\ntransfer across models with up to 90% effectiveness, making it possible to\nattack unseen models. To defend against these attacks, we extend prior work's\nartifact aware prompting to the graphical setting. We see a moderate reduction\nof success rates of up to 15% relative to standard prompts, suggesting a\npromising direction for enhancing model robustness.

The algorithm uses a variational\nquantum circuit based on the Standard Recursive Block Basis (SRBB), a\nhierarchical construction for the matrix algebra of the $SU(2^n)$ group, which\nis capable of linking the variational parameters with the topology of the Lie\ngroup. Compared to the full algebra, using only diagonal components reduces the\nnumber of CNOTs by an exponential factor, as well as the circuit depth, in full\nagreement with the relaxation principle, inherent to the approximation\nmethodology, of minimizing resources while achieving high accuracy. The desired\nquantum state is then approximated by a scalable quantum neural network, which\nis designed upon the diagonal SRBB sub-algebra. This approach provides a new\nscheme for approximate quantum state preparation in a variational framework and\na specific use case for the SRBB hierarchy. The performance of the algorithm is\nassessed with different loss functions, like fidelity, trace distance, and\nFrobenius norm, in relation to two optimizers: Adam and Nelder-Mead.

DNA nanotechnology is an emerging\nframework that uses programmed synthetic oligomers to encode the design of\nself-assembling structures with atomic precision at the nanoscale.\n  Here, we leverage DNA-directed self-assembly to construct single-molecule\nelectrical transport devices in high yield, precisely positioning a\nmetal-porphyrin between two 60 nm gold nanoparticles. Following deposition on\nSiO2 substrates, we image and establish electrical contact via established\nnanofabrication techniques. Each step of the process has a high probability of\nsuccess and we demonstrate device yields dramatically better than is possible\nusing conventional approaches. Our approach is inherently scalable and\nadaptable to devices incorporating multiple heterogenous functional molecular\ncomponents, finally offering a realistic framework for the realisation of\nclassical and quantum molecular technologies.",

    "abstract": "In human activity recognition (HAR), activity labels have typically been\nencoded in one-hot format, which has a recent shift towards using textual\nrepresentations to provide contextual knowledge. Here, we argue that HAR should\nbe anchored to physical motion data, as motion forms the basis of activity and\napplies effectively across sensing systems, whereas text is inherently limited.\nWe propose SKELAR, a novel HAR framework that pretrains activity\nrepresentations from skeleton data and matches them with heterogeneous HAR\nsignals. Our method addresses two major challenges: (1) capturing core motion\nknowledge without context-specific details. We achieve this through a\nself-supervised coarse angle reconstruction task that recovers joint rotation\nangles, invariant to both users and deployments; (2) adapting the\nrepresentations to downstream tasks with varying modalities and focuses. To\naddress this, we introduce a self-attention matching module that dynamically\nprioritizes relevant body parts in a data-driven manner. Given the lack of\ncorresponding labels in existing skeleton data, we establish MASD, a new HAR\ndataset with IMU, WiFi, and skeleton, collected from 20 subjects performing 27\nactivities. This is the first broadly applicable HAR dataset with\ntime-synchronized data across three modalities. Experiments show that SKELAR\nachieves the state-of-the-art performance in both full-shot and few-shot\nsettings. We also demonstrate that SKELAR can effectively leverage synthetic\nskeleton data to extend its use in scenarios without skeleton collections.",

For\ntransmission radiography, a source of directed high energy neutrons is\nrequired, while for applications to detect fissile isotopes, sub-MeV neutrons\nare preferred. The Excalibur (Experiment for Calibration with Uranium) neutron\nsource has been built and used in a variety of verification-related\nexperiments. Excalibur is based on a commercial deuterium-tritium neutron\ngenerator specified and measured to be capable of producing 14 MeV neutrons at\nrates of up to 8.2$\\times$10$^8$ neutrons/s. The generator is enclosed in a\ncarbon-steel 32$^{\\prime\\prime}$ diameter, 23.62$^{\\prime\\prime}$ high\ncarbon-steel cylinder that moderates the mean neutron energy to under 500 keV.\nThis, in turn, is encased in 5\\%-borated polyethylene such that the entire\nassembly is a 48$^{\\prime\\prime}$$\\times$48$^{\\prime\\prime}$ box that is\n30$^{\\prime\\prime}$ tall. For radiographic applications, a narrow, tapered\nchannel in the steel and polyethylene allows 14 MeV neutrons to stream directly\nfrom the generator to a test object. Its collimating capability is demonstrated\nby measuring the neutron flux profile. In the moderated mode of operation, the\ngenerator is fully enclosed in the steel, but a large section of the\npolyethylene is removed, providing a flux of sub-MeV neutrons from a wide range\nof angles. Neutron angular and spectral measurements using both a nested\nneutron spectrometer and a commercial liquid scintillator coupled with a $^3$He\ndetector show the expected softer neutron spectrum in moderated mode in good\nagreement with MCNP6 calculations. The gamma-ray spectrum from Excalibur is\nalso in good agreement with MCNP modeling. Based on these findings, the future\napplication of Excalibur in its two configurations is discussed.",

By analyzing approximately 6\nmillion messages from 29,196 users across 409 groups, we identify and quantify\nthe key factors that stimulate users to actively participate (i.e., send\nmessages) in group discussions. These factors include social influence,\nnovelty, complexity, uncertainty, and conflict, all measured through metrics\nderived from message sequences and user participation over time. After\nclustering the messages, we apply explainability techniques to assign\nmeaningful labels to the clusters. This approach uncovers macro categories\nrepresenting distinct curiosity stimulation profiles, each characterized by a\nunique combination of various stimuli. Social influence from peers and\ninfluencers drives engagement for some users, while for others, rare media\ntypes or a diverse range of senders and media sparks curiosity. Analyzing\npatterns, we found that user curiosity stimuli are mostly stable, but, as the\ntime between the initial message increases, curiosity occasionally shifts. A\ngraph-based analysis of influence networks reveals that users motivated by\ndirect social influence tend to occupy more peripheral positions, while those\nwho are not stimulated by any specific factors are often more central,\npotentially acting as initiators and conversation catalysts. These findings\ncontribute to understanding information dissemination and spread processes on\nsocial media networks, potentially contributing to more effective communication\nstrategies.",

This work\npresents the first set of cosmological constraints derived with ~16,000\noptically selected redMaPPer clusters across nearly 5,000 $\\rm{deg}^2$ using\nDES Year 3 data sets. Our analysis leverages a consistent modeling framework\nfor galaxy cluster cosmology and DES-Y3 joint analyses of galaxy clustering and\nweak lensing (3x2pt), ensuring direct comparability with the DES-Y3 3x2pt\nanalysis. We obtain constraints of $S_8 = 0.864 \\pm 0.035$ and $\\Omega_{\\rm{m}}\n= 0.265^{+0.019}_{-0.031}$ from the cluster-based data vector. We find that\ncluster constraints and 3x2pt constraints are consistent under the $\\Lambda$CDM\nmodel with a Posterior Predictive Distribution (PPD) value of $0.53$. The\nconsistency between clusters and 3x2pt provides a stringent test of\n$\\Lambda$CDM across different mass and spatial scales. Jointly analyzing\nclusters with 3x2pt further improves cosmological constraints, yielding $S_8 =\n0.811^{+0.022}_{-0.020}$ and $\\Omega_{\\rm{m}} = 0.294^{+0.022}_{-0.033}$, a\n$24\\%$ improvement in the $\\Omega_{\\rm{m}}-S_8$ figure-of-merit over 3x2pt\nalone. Moreover, we find no significant deviation from the Planck CMB\nconstraints with a probability to exceed (PTE) value of $0.6$, significantly\nreducing previous $S_8$ tension claims. Finally, combining DES 3x2pt, DES\nclusters, and Planck CMB places an upper limit on the sum of neutrino masses of\n$\\sum m_\\nu < 0.26$ eV at 95% confidence under the $\\Lambda$CDM model.

    "abstract": "Federated Learning is widely discussed as a distributed machine learning\nconcept with stress on preserving data privacy. Various structures of Federated\nLearning were proposed. Centralized Federated learning for instance has been\nthe primary structure that suits cloud computing. Decentralized Federated\nlearning also has been proposed for ecosystems where communication is\ndominantly peer-to-peer. Semi-Decentralized Federated Learning (SDFL) has\nemerged recently as a new concept where the interconnected nodes are clustered,\nand each cluster is managed independently. The potential of SDFL lies in its\nclustering feature, which distributes the load of the global model update down\nonto multiple nodes. Since the concept is fairly new, much can be done to\nrender this FL model a reliable, efficient, and real-time service at the edge.\nIn this paper, we propose SDFLMQ, a semi-decentralized Federated learning\nframework at the Edge that uses MQTT as the communication protocol. We\ndemonstrate how the publish/subscribe communication model is used to facilitate\nthe clustering and load balancing in SDFL. We also demonstrate how SDFLMQ can\nuse some of the core MQTT features to expand its capacity with no significant\ncosts. Based on some primary evaluations, we demonstrate how SDFLMQ can\nefficiently distribute the load of aggregation, and potentially save\nunnecessary memory allocation, all with no requirement for a powerful central\nunit for aggregation and global model update. We also disclose some of the key\nfuture expansions of SDFLMQ with a focus on the operation of large deep neural\nnetwork models at the edge.",

    "abstract": "We present a supervised dimensionality reduction technique called Convex\nLinear Discriminant Analysis (ConvexLDA). The proposed model optimizes a\nmulti-objective cost function by balancing two complementary terms. The first\nterm pulls the samples of a class towards its centroid by minimizing a sample's\ndistance from its class-centroid in low dimensional space. The second term\npushes the classes far apart by maximizing their hyperellipsoid scattering\nvolume via the logarithm of the determinant (\\textit{log det}) of the outer\nproduct matrix formed by the low-dimensional class-centroids. Using the\nnegative of the \\textit{log det}, we pose the final cost as a minimization\nproblem, which balances the two terms using a hyper-parameter $\\lambda$. We\ndemonstrate that the cost function is convex. Unlike Fisher LDA, the proposed\nmethod doesn't require to compute the inverse of a matrix, hence avoiding any\nill-conditioned problem where data dimension is very high, e.g. RNA-seq data.\nConvexLDA doesn't require pair-wise distance calculation, making it faster and\nmore easily scalable. Moreover, the convex nature of the cost function ensures\nglobal optimality, enhancing the reliability of the learned embedding. Our\nexperimental evaluation demonstrates that ConvexLDA outperforms several popular\nlinear discriminant analysis (LDA)-based methods on a range of high-dimensional\nbiological data, image data sets, etc.",

Despite these advances, Code LLMs often\nstruggle with programming language confusion--producing code in unintended\nlanguages despite explicit instructions or obvious context. We systematically\nevaluate this phenomenon across diverse programming contexts. Our study\nassesses seven popular general and Code LLMs across multiple natural and\nprogramming languages, analyzing their behavior using four datasets (HumanEval,\nHumanEval-xl, MBPP, TP3) for code generation and one dataset (CodeNet) for code\ntranslation. The study results reveal that language confusion occurs across all\nevaluated models, with StarCoder and CodeLlama exhibiting the highest confusion\nrates. Even high-performing models fail to maintain language consistency\nthroughout generated solutions, particularly when handling complex algorithmic\nproblems. We identify key factors contributing to this confusion, including\nsyntactic similarities between programming languages and inconsistent prompt\nformatting. Interestingly, we find evidence suggesting that LLMs consistently\nexhibit strategic language migration behaviors, prioritizing languages where\nthey can produce more syntactically correct code even when explicitly\ninstructed otherwise.

They can therefore form a link between fully synchronized\nand incoherent states. Despite their fundamental role in coupled oscillator\ndynamics, our understanding of how these clusters form and differentiate is\nstill quite limited. Here, we study an ensemble of globally coupled\nStuart-Landau oscillators and focus on the question of how 3-cluster solutions\nemerge from 2-cluster solutions and how the different 3-cluster solutions are\norganized in parameter space. We show that the arrangement of the clusters is\ndictated by a co-dimension 2 point, which we coin Type-II cluster singularity.\nFurthermore, our study points to a hierarchical structure of higher cluster\nsolutions.",

In\nquantum physics, an arrow of time emerges when a sequence of measurements is\nperformed on a system. We introduce quantum control tools that can yield\ndynamics more consistent with time flowing backward than forward. The control\ntools are based on the explicit construction of a Hamiltonian that can\nreplicate the stochastic trajectories of a monitored quantum system. Such\nHamiltonian can reverse the effect of monitoring and, via a feedback process,\ngenerate trajectories consistent with a reversed arrow of time.

High inward velocities are caused by the advection of accreted\nmaterial which is deficient in angular momentum, rather than being set by\nviscous spreading, and accretion gives rise to strong velocity fluctuations.\nTherefore, we aim to investigate when it is possible for the first\nplanetesimals to form and subsequent planet formation to commence.

While\ntheoretical studies have so far primarily focused on the simplest two-point\ncorrelator, mapping out the dynamics of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) will\nrequire developing a theoretical understanding of multi-point energy\ncorrelators. In this paper we present a systematic theoretical study of\nmulti-point energy correlators for jets fragmenting in a dense quark-gluon\nplasma, accounting for both the medium's perturbative modification to the jet,\nand its hydrodynamical back-reaction. We consider both the scaling behavior of\nprojected correlators, as well as the shape dependent three-point correlator,\nhighlighting how both provide insight into interactions with the QGP. We\ndiscuss the parametric dependence of modifications on the medium scales,\nopening new opportunities to experimentally separate jet modifications from the\nmedium response. Our results open the door to a systematic exploration of\nmulti-point energy correlators in heavy ion collisions.",

Simulations have corroborated this\nfinding, providing further insights into how the shape of the stellar component\naligns with the surrounding dark matter halo. In this work, we aim at gaining a\ndeeper understanding of galaxy alignments by quantifying how this property is\nrelated to the mass of the haloes hosting central galaxies and to the\nlarge-scale environment measured at different scales. By studying different\nangles, we describe how the alignments of central galaxies depend on the mass\nof the haloes they inhabit. We explore how the main axes of central galaxies\nalign across different scales, both in three-dimensional and two-dimensional\nprojections. We examine how halo mass influences these alignments and how they\nvary in the surrounding large-scale environment. To conduct this study, we\nemploy the TNG300 hydrodynamical simulations and compare our results with the\nspectroscopic data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 18. Three\ntypes of alignment were analysed: between stellar and dark matter components,\nbetween satellite galaxies and the central galaxy, and between the central\ngalaxy and its host halo. The results show that the alignment increases with\nhalo mass and varies with the environment (clusters, filaments, cluster\nperiphery, and others). However, after controlling for local density, we found\nthat most of the observed trends disappear, except for a marginal influence of\ncosmic filaments on some of the considered alignment angles. The SDSS\nobservations confirm a mass dependence similar to the simulations, although\nobservational biases limit the detection of differences between the different\nenvironments.",

The key to our approach is the\ndevelopment of a highly parallelizable minimum-weight perfect matching (MWPM)\ndecoder, which achieves a polylog parallel runtime in terms of the code size\nwhile providing theoretical guarantees on threshold existence and overhead\nbounds. Our protocol integrates this decoder with a topological-code protocol\nthat incorporates single-shot decoding for efficient syndrome extraction;\nfurthermore, we concatenate this with the concatenated Steane codes to\nguarantee the existence of the threshold while avoiding a backlog problem,\nenabling us to achieve doubly polylog time overheads even when accounting for\nthe decoder's runtime.

Recently, the stabilizer R\\'{e}nyi entropy (SRE) has\nemerged as a computationally tractable measure of nonstabilizerness, a crucial\nresource for fault-tolerant universal quantum computation. While numerical\nresults suggested that the SRE in critical states can exhibit universal\nbehavior, its comprehensive theoretical understanding has remained elusive. In\nthis work, we develop a field-theoretical framework for the SRE in a\n$(1+1)$-dimensional many-body system and elucidate its universal aspects using\nboundary conformal field theory. We demonstrate that the SRE is equivalent to a\nparticipation entropy in the Bell basis of a doubled Hilbert space, which can\nbe calculated from the partition function of a replicated field theory with the\ninterlayer line defect created by the Bell-state measurements. This\nidentification allows us to characterize the universal contributions to the SRE\non the basis of the data of conformal boundary conditions imposed on the\nreplicated theory. We find that the SRE of the entire system contains a\nuniversal size-independent term determined by the noninteger ground-state\ndegeneracy known as the g-factor. In contrast, we show that the mutual SRE\nexhibits the logarithmic scaling with a universal coefficient given by the\nscaling dimension of a boundary condition changing operator, which elucidates\nthe origin of universality previously observed in numerical results. As a\nconcrete demonstration, we present a detailed analysis of the Ising\ncriticality, where we analytically derive the universal quantities at arbitrary\nR\\'{e}nyi indices and numerically validate them with high accuracy by employing\ntensor network methods.

    "abstract": "Methods based on diffusion backbones have recently revolutionized novel view\nsynthesis (NVS). However, those models require pretrained 2D diffusion\ncheckpoints (e.g., Stable Diffusion) as the basis for geometrical priors. Since\nsuch checkpoints require exorbitant amounts of data and compute to train, this\ngreatly limits the scalability of diffusion-based NVS models. We present\nNext-Scale Autoregression Conditioned by View (ArchonView), a method that\nsignificantly exceeds state-of-the-art methods despite being trained from\nscratch with 3D rendering data only and no 2D pretraining. We achieve this by\nincorporating both global (pose-augmented semantics) and local (multi-scale\nhierarchical encodings) conditioning into a backbone based on the next-scale\nautoregression paradigm. Our model also exhibits robust performance even for\ndifficult camera poses where previous methods fail, and is several times faster\nin inference speed compared to diffusion. We experimentally verify that\nperformance scales with model and dataset size, and conduct extensive\ndemonstration of our method's synthesis quality across several tasks.

    "abstract": "One critical challenge for large language models (LLMs) for making complex\nreasoning is their reliance on matching reasoning patterns from training data,\ninstead of proactively selecting the most appropriate cognitive strategy to\nsolve a given task. Existing approaches impose fixed cognitive structures that\nenhance performance in specific tasks but lack adaptability across diverse\nscenarios. To address this limitation, we introduce METASCALE, a test-time\nscaling framework based on meta-thoughts -- adaptive thinking strategies\ntailored to each task. METASCALE initializes a pool of candidate meta-thoughts,\nthen iteratively selects and evaluates them using a multi-armed bandit\nalgorithm with upper confidence bound selection, guided by a reward model. To\nfurther enhance adaptability, a genetic algorithm evolves high-reward\nmeta-thoughts, refining and extending the strategy pool over time. By\ndynamically proposing and optimizing meta-thoughts at inference time, METASCALE\nimproves both accuracy and generalization across a wide range of tasks.\nExperimental results demonstrate that MetaScale consistently outperforms\nstandard inference approaches, achieving an 11% performance gain in win rate on\nArena-Hard for GPT-4o, surpassing o1-mini by 0.9% under style control.

    "abstract": "Mobile manipulation is the fundamental challenge for robotics to assist\nhumans with diverse tasks and environments in everyday life. However,\nconventional mobile manipulation approaches often struggle to generalize across\ndifferent tasks and environments because of the lack of large-scale training.\nIn contrast, recent advances in vision-language-action (VLA) models have shown\nimpressive generalization capabilities, but these foundation models are\ndeveloped for fixed-base manipulation tasks. Therefore, we propose an efficient\npolicy adaptation framework named MoManipVLA to transfer pre-trained VLA models\nof fix-base manipulation to mobile manipulation, so that high generalization\nability across tasks and environments can be achieved in mobile manipulation\npolicy. Specifically, we utilize pre-trained VLA models to generate waypoints\nof the end-effector with high generalization ability. We design motion planning\nobjectives for the mobile base and the robot arm, which aim at maximizing the\nphysical feasibility of the trajectory. Finally, we present an efficient\nbi-level objective optimization framework for trajectory generation, where the\nupper-level optimization predicts waypoints for base movement to enhance the\nmanipulator policy space, and the lower-level optimization selects the optimal\nend-effector trajectory to complete the manipulation task. In this way,\nMoManipVLA can adjust the position of the robot base in a zero-shot manner,\nthus making the waypoints predicted from the fixed-base VLA models feasible.\nExtensive experimental results on OVMM and the real world demonstrate that\nMoManipVLA achieves a 4.2% higher success rate than the state-of-the-art mobile\nmanipulation, and only requires 50 training cost for real world deployment due\nto the strong generalization ability in the pre-trained VLA models.",

In this work,\nwe measure the size of the shift of the BAO peak using large Ly-$\\alpha$ forest\nmocks produced on the $N$-body simulation suite \\textsc{AbacusSummit}.\nSpecifically, we measure the Ly-$\\alpha$ auto-correlation and the\nLy-$\\alpha$-quasar cross-correlation functions. We use the DESI Ly-$\\alpha$\nforest fitting pipeline, \\textsc{Vega}, with the publicly available covariance\nmatrix from eBOSS DR16. To mitigate the noise, we adopt a linear control\nvariates (LCV) technique, reducing the error bars by a factor of up to $\\sim\n\\sqrt{50}$ on large scales.

However, due to the challenges in acquiring\nmulti-view video data, the current 4D reconstruction benchmarks mainly display\nactions performed in place, such as dancing, within limited scenarios. In\npractical scenarios, many scenes involve wide-range spatial movements,\nhighlighting the limitations of existing 4D reconstruction datasets.\nAdditionally, existing 4D reconstruction methods rely on deformation fields to\nestimate the dynamics of 3D objects, but deformation fields struggle with\nwide-range spatial movements, which limits the ability to achieve high-quality\n4D scene reconstruction with wide-range spatial movements. In this paper, we\nfocus on 4D scene reconstruction with significant object spatial movements and\npropose a novel 4D reconstruction benchmark, WideRange4D. This benchmark\nincludes rich 4D scene data with large spatial variations, allowing for a more\ncomprehensive evaluation of the generation capabilities of 4D generation\nmethods. Furthermore, we introduce a new 4D reconstruction method, Progress4D,\nwhich generates stable and high-quality 4D results across various complex 4D\nscene reconstruction tasks.

    "abstract": "The gold-standard for robustly estimating relative pose through image\nmatching is RANSAC. While RANSAC is powerful, it requires setting the inlier\nthreshold that determines whether the error of a correspondence under an\nestimated model is sufficiently small to be included in its consensus set.\nSetting this threshold is typically done by hand, and is difficult to tune\nwithout an access to ground truth data. Thus, a method capable of automatically\ndetermining the optimal threshold would be desirable. In this paper we revisit\ninlier noise scale estimation, which is an attractive approach as the inlier\nnoise scale is linear to the optimal threshold. We revisit the noise scale\nestimation method SIMFIT and find bias in the estimate of the noise scale. In\nparticular, we fix underestimates from using the same data for fitting the\nmodel as estimating the inlier noise, and from not taking the threshold itself\ninto account. Secondly, since the optimal threshold within a scene is\napproximately constant we propose a multi-pair extension of SIMFIT++, by\nfiltering of estimates, which improves results. Our approach yields robust\nperformance across a range of thresholds, shown in Figure 1. Code is available\nat https://github.com/Parskatt/simfitpp",

    "abstract": "Determining consumer preferences and utility is a foundational challenge in\neconomics. They are central in determining consumer behaviour through the\nutility-maximising consumer decision-making process. However, preferences and\nutilities are not observable and may not even be known to the individual making\nthe choice; only the outcome is observed in the form of demand. Without the\nability to observe the decision-making mechanism, demand estimation becomes a\nchallenging task and current methods fall short due to lack of scalability or\nability to identify causal effects. Estimating these effects is critical when\nconsidering changes in policy, such as pricing, the impact of taxes and\nsubsidies, and the effect of a tariff. To address the shortcomings of existing\nmethods, we combine revealed preference theory and inverse reinforcement\nlearning to present a novel algorithm, Preference Extraction and Reward\nLearning (PEARL) which, to the best of our knowledge, is the only algorithm\nthat can uncover a representation of the utility function that best\nrationalises observed consumer choice data given a specified functional form.\nWe introduce a flexible utility function, the Input-Concave Neural Network\nwhich captures complex relationships across goods, including cross-price\nelasticities.

Evaluating models at both stages provides\npolicymakers with essential evidence to regulate deployment, access, and safety\nstandards.

Our analysis of AI safety disclosures from leading\nfrontier labs identifies three critical gaps: (1) companies rarely evaluate\nboth pre- and post-mitigation versions, (2) evaluation methods lack\nstandardization, and (3) reported results are often too vague to inform policy.\nTo address these issues, we recommend mandatory disclosure of pre- and\npost-mitigation capabilities to approved government bodies, standardized\nevaluation methods, and minimum transparency requirements for public safety\nreporting.

    "abstract": "Large-scale articulated objects with high quality are desperately needed for\nmultiple tasks related to embodied AI. Most existing methods for creating\narticulated objects are either data-driven or simulation based, which are\nlimited by the scale and quality of the training data or the fidelity and heavy\nlabour of the simulation. In this paper, we propose Infinite Mobility, a novel\nmethod for synthesizing high-fidelity articulated objects through procedural\ngeneration. User study and quantitative evaluation demonstrate that our method\ncan produce results that excel current state-of-the-art methods and are\ncomparable to human-annotated datasets in both physics property and mesh\nquality. Furthermore, we show that our synthetic data can be used as training\ndata for generative models, enabling next-step scaling up.

    "abstract": "The assumption across nearly all language model (LM) tokenization schemes is\nthat tokens should be subwords, i.e., contained within word boundaries. While\nproviding a seemingly reasonable inductive bias, is this common practice\nlimiting the potential of modern LMs? Whitespace is not a reliable delimiter of\nmeaning, as evidenced by multi-word expressions (e.g., \"by the way\"),\ncrosslingual variation in the number of words needed to express a concept\n(e.g., \"spacesuit helmet\" in German is \"raumanzughelm\"), and languages that do\nnot use whitespace at all (e.g., Chinese). To explore the potential of\ntokenization beyond subwords, we introduce a \"superword\" tokenizer, SuperBPE,\nwhich incorporates a simple pretokenization curriculum into the byte-pair\nencoding (BPE) algorithm to first learn subwords, then superwords that bridge\nwhitespace. This brings dramatic improvements in encoding efficiency: when\nfixing the vocabulary size to 200k, SuperBPE encodes a fixed piece of text with\nup to 33% fewer tokens than BPE on average. In experiments, we pretrain 8B\ntransformer LMs from scratch while fixing the model size, vocabulary size, and\ntrain compute, varying *only* the algorithm for learning the vocabulary. Our\nmodel trained with SuperBPE achieves an average +4.0% absolute improvement over\nthe BPE baseline across 30 downstream tasks (including +8.2% on MMLU), while\nsimultaneously requiring 27% less compute at inference time. In analysis, we\nfind that SuperBPE results in segmentations of text that are more uniform in\nper-token difficulty. Qualitatively, this may be because SuperBPE tokens often\ncapture common multi-word expressions that function semantically as a single\nunit. SuperBPE is a straightforward, local modification to tokenization that\nimproves both encoding efficiency and downstream performance, yielding better\nlanguage models overall.",

However, current DMoE systems lack an effective expert\nselection algorithm to address the simultaneous task-expert relevance and\nchannel diversity inherent in these systems. Traditional AI or communication\nsystems focus on either performance or channel conditions, and direct\napplication of these methods leads to high communication overhead or low\nperformance. To address this, we propose the DMoE protocol to schedule the\nexpert inference and inter-expert transmission. This protocol identifies expert\nselection and subcarrier allocation as key optimization problems. We formulate\nan expert selection problem by incorporating both AI performance and channel\nconditions, and further extend it to a Joint Expert and Subcarrier Allocation\n(JESA) problem for comprehensive AI and channel management within the DMoE\nframework. For the NP-hard expert selection problem, we introduce the Dynamic\nExpert Selection (DES) algorithm, which leverages a linear relaxation as a\nbounding criterion to significantly reduce search complexity. For the JESA\nproblem, we discover a unique structural property that ensures asymptotic\noptimality in most scenarios. We propose an iterative algorithm that addresses\nsubcarrier allocation as a subproblem and integrates it with the DES algorithm.\nThe proposed framework effectively manages the tradeoff between task relevance\nand channel conditions through a tunable importance factor, enabling flexible\nadaptation to diverse scenarios.

While this DL-enabled\ncybersickness detection method provides promising solutions for enhancing user\nexperiences, it also introduces new risks since these models are vulnerable to\nadversarial attacks; a small perturbation of the input data that is visually\nundetectable to human observers can fool the cybersickness detection model and\ntrigger unexpected mitigation, thus disrupting user immersive experiences (UIX)\nand even posing safety risks. In this paper, we present a new type of VR\nattack, i.e., a cybersickness attack, which successfully stops the triggering\nof cybersickness mitigation by fooling DL-based cybersickness detection models\nand dramatically hinders the UIX. Next, we propose a novel explainable\nartificial intelligence (XAI)-guided cybersickness attack detection framework\nto detect such attacks in VR to ensure UIX and a comfortable VR experience.

    "abstract": "Learning to manipulate objects efficiently, particularly those involving\nsustained contact (e.g., pushing, sliding) and articulated parts (e.g.,\ndrawers, doors), presents significant challenges. Traditional methods, such as\nrobot-centric reinforcement learning (RL), imitation learning, and hybrid\ntechniques, require massive training and often struggle to generalize across\ndifferent objects and robot platforms. We propose a novel framework for\nlearning object-centric manipulation policies in force space, decoupling the\nrobot from the object. By directly applying forces to selected regions of the\nobject, our method simplifies the action space, reduces unnecessary\nexploration, and decreases simulation overhead. This approach, trained in\nsimulation on a small set of representative objects, captures object dynamics\n-- such as joint configurations -- allowing policies to generalize effectively\nto new, unseen objects. Decoupling these policies from robot-specific dynamics\nenables direct transfer to different robotic platforms (e.g., Kinova, Panda,\nUR5) without retraining. Our evaluations demonstrate that the method\nsignificantly outperforms baselines, achieving over an order of magnitude\nimprovement in training efficiency compared to other state-of-the-art methods.\nAdditionally, operating in force space enhances policy transferability across\ndiverse robot platforms and object types.

In\nthis work, we study a coupling that is mixed between two pairs of quadratures\nof a bosonic mode and a spin. In this setting, we can suppress the dispersive\nshift while retaining a nonzero Kerr shift, which remarkably results in a cubic\nrelationship between shot noise dephasing and thermal photons in the\noscillator. We demonstrate this configuration with a simple toy model, quantify\nthe expected improvements to photon shot-noise dephasing of the spin, and\ndescribe an approach to fast qubit readout via the Kerr shift. Further, we show\nhow such a regime is achievable in superconducting circuits because magnetic\nand electric couplings can be of comparable strength, using two examples: the\nCooper pair transistor and the fluxonium molecule.",

    "abstract": "Estimating the size of the modeling error is crucial for robust control. Over\nthe years, numerous metrics have been developed to quantify the model error in\na control relevant manner. One of the most important such metrics is the\nstructured singular value, as it leads to necessary and sufficient conditions\nfor ensuring stability and robustness in feedback control under structured\nmodel uncertainty. Although the computation of the structured singular value is\noften intractable, lower and upper bounds for it can often be obtained if a\nmodel of the system is known. In this paper, we introduce a fully data-driven\nmethod to estimate a lower bound for the structured singular value, by\nconducting experiments on the system and applying power iterations to the\ncollected data.

To achieve a cost-effective preventive\nmaintenance strategy, accurate remaining useful life (RUL) prediction based on\nthe signals is of paramount importance. However, the CM signals are often\nrecorded at different factories and production lines, with limited amounts of\ndata. Unfortunately, these datasets have rarely been shared between the sites\ndue to data confidentiality and ownership issues, a lack of computing and\nstorage power, and high communication costs associated with data transfer\nbetween sites and a data center. Another challenge in real applications is that\nthe CM signals are often not explicitly specified \\textit{a priori}, meaning\nthat existing methods, which often usually a parametric form, may not be\napplicable. To address these challenges, we propose a new prognostic framework\nfor RUL prediction using the joint modeling of nonlinear degradation signals\nand time-to-failure data within a federated learning scheme. The proposed\nmethod constructs a nonparametric degradation model using a federated\nmulti-output Gaussian process and then employs a federated survival model to\npredict failure times and probabilities for in-service machinery.

However, current clinical\ndiagnoses primarily rely on manual evaluation. Deep learning methods have shown\npromise in lesion detection, but most supervised approaches are heavily\ndependent on large, annotated datasets. Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD)\noffers a compelling alternative by eliminating the need for abnormal data\nannotations. However, existing UAD methods rely on curated normal datasets and\ntheir performance frequently deteriorates when applied to clinical datasets due\nto domain shifts. We propose an Uncertainty-based Unsupervised Anomaly\nDetection framework, termed U2AD, to address these limitations. Unlike\ntraditional methods, U2AD is designed to be trained and tested within the same\nclinical dataset, following a \"mask-and-reconstruction\" paradigm built on a\nVision Transformer-based architecture. We introduce an uncertainty-guided\nmasking strategy to resolve task conflicts between normal reconstruction and\nanomaly detection to achieve an optimal balance. Specifically, we employ a\nMonte-Carlo sampling technique to estimate reconstruction uncertainty mappings\nduring training. By iteratively optimizing reconstruction training under the\nguidance of both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty, U2AD reduces overall\nreconstruction variance while emphasizing regions. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that U2AD outperforms existing supervised and unsupervised methods\nin patient-level identification and segment-level localization tasks. This\nframework establishes a new benchmark for incorporating uncertainty guidance\ninto UAD, highlighting its clinical utility in addressing domain shifts and\ntask conflicts in medical image anomaly detection.

To bridge\nthis gap, we introduce MicroVQA, a visual-question answering (VQA) benchmark\ndesigned to assess three reasoning capabilities vital in research workflows:\nexpert image understanding, hypothesis generation, and experiment proposal.\nMicroVQA consists of 1,042 multiple-choice questions (MCQs) curated by biology\nexperts across diverse microscopy modalities, ensuring VQA samples represent\nreal scientific practice. In constructing the benchmark, we find that standard\nMCQ generation methods induce language shortcuts, motivating a new two-stage\npipeline: an optimized LLM prompt structures question-answer pairs into MCQs;\nthen, an agent-based `RefineBot' updates them to remove shortcuts. Benchmarking\non state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal a peak performance of 53\\%; models with\nsmaller LLMs only slightly underperform top models, suggesting that\nlanguage-based reasoning is less challenging than multimodal reasoning; and\ntuning with scientific articles enhances performance.

For $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$, the $k$-IP\nproblem is a variant of the IP problem with the extra constraint that each path\nin $\\mathcal{P}$ must have exactly $k$ edges. Kalyanaraman, Kamruzzaman, and\nKrishnamoorthy (Journal of Computational Geometry, 2019) claim that both IP and\n$k$-IP (for $k \\geq 3$) are NP-complete. We point out some inaccuracies in\ntheir proofs. Furthermore, we show that both problems are NP-hard in directed\nacyclic graphs.",

    "abstract": "Quantum spin Hall effect is usually realized in two-dimensional materials\nwith time-reversal symmetry, but whether it can be realized without symmetry\nprotection remains unexplored. Here, we propose type-II quantum spin Hall\ninsulator with quantized spin Hall conductivity, whose edge states with\nopposite chirality and polarization, distributed in different Brillouin zone\nregions, connect the conduction and valence bands at the boundary. Thus, the\ntype-II quantum spin Hall insulator does not require any symmetry protection\nother than translational symmetry. Then, based on symmetry analysis and the\nfirst-principles electronic structure calculations, we demonstrate that type-II\nquantum spin Hall insulator can be realized in both altermagnetic materials and\nLuttinger compensated magnetic materials. Furthermore, based on lattice model,\nwe find that as long as $U(1)$ symmetry exists, type-II quantum spin Hall\ninsulator phase can always exist stably. However, if $U(1)$ symmetry is broken,\ntype-II quantum spin Hall insulator phase transforms into an obstructed atomic\ninsulator phase as spin-orbit coupling effect is enhanced. Therefore, our work\nnot only proposes a new mechanism for realizing the quantum spin Hall effect,\nbut also enriches the types of unconventional magnetic topological phases.",

    "abstract": "Complex systems can be described at myriad different scales, and their causal\nworkings often have multiscale structure (e.g., a computer can be described at\nthe microscale of its hardware circuitry, the mesoscale of its machine code,\nand the macroscale of its operating system). While scientists study and model\nsystems across the full hierarchy of their scales, from microphysics to\nmacroeconomics, there is debate about what the macroscales of systems can\npossibly add beyond mere compression. To resolve this longstanding issue, here\na new theory of emergence is introduced wherein the different scales of a\nsystem are treated like slices of a higher-dimensional object. The theory can\ndistinguish which of these scales possess unique causal contributions, and\nwhich are not causally relevant. Constructed from an axiomatic notion of\ncausation, the theory's application is demonstrated in coarse-grains of Markov\nchains. It identifies all cases of macroscale causation: instances where\nreduction to a microscale is possible, yet lossy about causation. Furthermore,\nthe theory posits a causal apportioning schema that calculates the causal\ncontribution of each scale, showing what each uniquely adds. Finally, it\nreveals a novel measure of emergent complexity: how widely distributed a\nsystem's causal workings are across its hierarchy of scales.",

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of dataset scales has been a key driver in advancing deep\nlearning research. However, as dataset scale increases, the training process\nbecomes increasingly inefficient due to the presence of low-value samples,\nincluding excessive redundant samples, overly challenging samples, and\ninefficient easy samples that contribute little to model improvement.To address\nthis challenge, we propose Scale Efficient Training (SeTa) for large datasets,\na dynamic sample pruning approach that losslessly reduces training time. To\nremove low-value samples, SeTa first performs random pruning to eliminate\nredundant samples, then clusters the remaining samples according to their\nlearning difficulty measured by loss. Building upon this clustering, a sliding\nwindow strategy is employed to progressively remove both overly challenging and\ninefficient easy clusters following an easy-to-hard curriculum.We conduct\nextensive experiments on large-scale synthetic datasets, including ToCa, SS1M,\nand ST+MJ, each containing over 3 million samples.SeTa reduces training costs\nby up to 50\\% while maintaining or improving performance, with minimal\ndegradation even at 70\\% cost reduction. Furthermore, experiments on various\nscale real datasets across various backbones (CNNs, Transformers, and Mambas)\nand diverse tasks (instruction tuning, multi-view stereo, geo-localization,\ncomposed image retrieval, referring image segmentation) demonstrate the\npowerful effectiveness and universality of our approach.

However, their stability and generalizability are compromised due to\nthe vulnerability to experimental setups and validation protocols, falling\nshort of surpassing random sampling (Diddee & Ippolito, 2024; Xia et al.,\n2024b). Built upon LLMs, multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs), combined with the sheer\ntoken volume and heightened heterogeneity of data sources, amplify both the\nsignificance and complexity of data selection.\n  To harvest multi-modal instructional data in a robust and efficient manner,\nwe re-define the granularity of the quality metric by decomposing it into 14\nvision-language-related capabilities, and introduce multi-modal rich scorers to\nevaluate the capabilities of each data candidate. To promote diversity, in\nlight of the inherent objective of the alignment stage, we take interaction\nstyle as diversity indicator and use a multi-modal rich styler to identify data\ninstruction patterns. In doing so, our multi-modal rich scorers and styler\n(mmSSR) guarantee that high-scoring information is conveyed to users in\ndiversified forms.

The direct measurement of densities and porosities is\nof great value in revealing the gravitational aggregates and icy bodies that\nform the asteroid-comet continuum. Aims. Several observation techniques from\nspace and ground-based platforms have provided many results in this regard.\nHere we show the value of the Gaia mission and its high-precision astrometry\nfor analysing asteroid binaries and for individually deriving the masses of the\ncomponents. Methods. We focus on the binary asteroid (4337) Arecibo, a member\nof the Themis family. We analysed the astrometry obtained in the Gaia FPR\ncatalogue release, and performed orbital fitting for both the heliocentric\norbit of the system and the relative orbit of the binary components.

The results are consistent with an ice-rich body in\nthe outer main belt. They also show a significantly denser secondary or a less\nclosely packed primary.

To this end, we\npropose SyncDiff, a simple yet effective approach to improve diffusion-based\nmodels using a temporal pose frame with information bottleneck and\nfacial-informative audio features extracted from AVHuBERT, as conditioning\ninput into the diffusion process. We evaluate SyncDiff on two canonical talking\nhead datasets, LRS2 and LRS3 for direct comparison with other SOTA models.\nExperiments on LRS2/LRS3 datasets show that SyncDiff achieves a synchronization\nscore 27.7%/62.3% relatively higher than previous diffusion-based methods,\nwhile preserving their high-fidelity characteristics.",

To\nthis end, a set of three highly resolved direct numerical simulations (DNS) at\nlean ambient conditions and varying hydrogen fraction in the fuel blend are\nconducted. The analysis of these DNS reveals a significant increase of NO\nformation in positively curved regions of the flame, particularly for lower\nhydrogen fuel fractions, while negatively curved areas exhibit reduced NO\nconcentrations. However, despite the strong variations of local mass fractions\nof NO in the flame sheet, the mean mass fraction in the post-flame region\nremains close to the solution from a one-dimensional flame. Through a\nrepresentative flame segment analysis of positively curved, negatively curved,\nand flat regions, key reactions contributing to NO formation are determined,\nwith the HNO pathway being the predominant production and the deNOx pathway\nbeing the predominant consumption pathway across all cases. Thermal NO plays no\nsignificant role in the considered cases. Generally, the peaks of NO production\nshift to lower values of progress variable in the negatively curved regions,\nleading to an annihilation of the production and consumption terms in the low\nhydrogen fuel fraction case. The decrease of NO production is found to be\nmainly driven by changes of the radical concentrations, rather than changes of\nthe temperature-dependent reaction rate coefficients.",

Working with IBM Qiskit\nquantum computing platform, we show that two types of quantum circuits named\nTwoLocal and EvolvedOperatorAnsatz can outperform the popular EfficientSU2\ncircuits which have been routinely used in the recent quantum physics\nliterature to run VQE. With their more customizable constructions that allow\nfor more flexibility beyond choosing the types of parameterized rotation gates,\nboth types of new circuit ansatzes used in this work have led to performances\nthat are either better than or at least comparable to EfficientSU2 in the\nsetting of $SU(2)$ matrix models. In particular, in the strong coupling regime\nof the bosonic model, both TwoLocal and EvolvedOperatorAnsatz circuits provided\na better approximation to the exact ground state, while in the supersymmetric\nmodel, shallow EvolvedOperatorAnsatz circuits, with a small number of\nparameters, attained a comparable or even better performance compared to the\nmuch deeper EfficientSU2 circuits with around 8 to 9 times more parameters.

KV cache reuse, which reuses the\nexact same KV cache of prefixes and templates or shares similar ones but with\nextra selective recomputation, offers a promising way to tackle this issue.\nHowever, prior studies overlook the cross-request KV reuse and the attention\ndeviations introduced by new tokens during the decoding stage.

The objective is\nto schedule all jobs on a single machine with a minimum total completion time.\nThe challenge lies in deciding which jobs to test and the order of\ntesting/processing jobs.\n  The online problem was first introduced with unit testing time and later\ngeneralized to variable testing times. For this general setting, the upper\nbounds of the competitive ratio are shown to be $4$ and $3.3794$ for\ndeterministic and randomized online algorithms; while the lower bounds for unit\ntesting time stands, which are $1.8546$ (deterministic) and $1.6257$\n(randomized).\n  We continue the study on variable testing times setting. We first enhance the\nanalysis framework and improve the competitive ratio of the deterministic\nalgorithm from $4$ to $1+\\sqrt{2} \\approx 2.4143$. Using the new analysis\nframework, we propose a new deterministic algorithm that further improves the\ncompetitive ratio to $2.316513$.

To understand how stellar flares impact the\nprimordial atmospheres of planets orbiting young M stars, we use UV\nspectroscopic data of flares from the Habitable Zones and M dwarf Activity\nacross Time (HAZMAT) and Measurements of the Ultraviolet Spectral\nCharacteristics of Low-mass Exoplanetary Systems (MUSCLES) programs as a proxy\nto the XUV flare emission. Using the software package VPLanet, we simulate the\nyoung AU Mic planetary system composed of two Neptune-sized and one Earth-sized\nplanet orbiting a 23-Myr-old M1 star. Our findings show that the Earth-sized\nplanet AU Mic d should be in the process of losing completely its atmosphere in\nthe next couple million years, solely due to the quiescent emission, with\nflares not significantly contributing to its atmospheric escape due to the\nsmall size of AU mic d and its close-in distance from the star. However, our\nresults indicate that flares would play a crucial role for such planets further\naway, in the habitable zone (i.e. 0.2935 AU) of AU Mic-like stars during the\npost-saturation phase, accelerating the total atmospheric loss process by a few\nbillion years.

However, it is well known that this\napproach overlooks scatter in mass assembly histories and merger effects, with\nprevious studies relying on model-based corrections, either from hydrodynamical\ncosmological simulations or adjustments to the evolution of cumulative number\ndensity with redshift. Here, we revisit this approach, showing that dark matter\nhalo assembly histories imply evolving number densities that are far from\nconstant. These exhibit an average slope of $d \\log n_\\text{vir} /dz \\sim 0.2$\ndex for progenitors at $z=0$, leading to evolutionary tracks where galaxies are\n$\\sim2-3$ times smaller in mass at $z\\sim2$ and an order of magnitude smaller\nby $z\\sim7$ compared to the number density matching approach. We show that\nevolving halo number densities provide realistic evolutionary tracks without\nrelying on model-based corrections. Accounting for random errors in stellar\nmass measurements is also crucial for robust track derivation. We also discuss\na generalization that incorporates a galaxy's star formation activity. When\nadditionally considering the scatter around the $M_\\ast-M_\\text{vir}$ relation\n($\\sim0.15$ dex), our evolving halo cumulative number density approach shows\nthat some observed stellar masses, $M_{\\text{obs},\\ast}$, can exceed the\nuniversal baryon fraction $f_\\text{bar}\\sim0.16$.

Unlike prevalent top-down pose estimation methods, our\napproach doesn't rely on per-frame target detections due to its tracking\ncapability. This facilitates a significant advancement in inference efficiency\nand potential applications. We train and validate our approach on datasets\nencompassing diverse species. Our experiments demonstrate superior results\ncompared to existing methods, opening doors to various applications, including\nbut not limited to action recognition and behavioral analysis.",

The average score across a wide range of benchmarks provides a\nsignal that helps guide the use of these LMs in practice. Currently, holistic\nevaluations are costly due to the large volume of benchmark questions, making\nfrequent evaluations impractical. A popular attempt to lower the cost is to\ncompute the average score on a subset of the benchmark. This approach,\nunfortunately, often renders an unreliable measure of LM performance because\nthe average score is often confounded with the difficulty of the questions in\nthe benchmark subset. Item response theory (IRT) was designed to address this\nchallenge, providing a reliable measurement by careful controlling for question\ndifficulty. Unfortunately, question difficulty is expensive to estimate. Facing\nthis challenge, we train a model that predicts question difficulty from its\ncontent, enabling a reliable measurement at a fraction of the cost. In\naddition, we leverage this difficulty predictor to further improve the\nevaluation efficiency through training a question generator given a difficulty\nlevel. This question generator is essential in adaptive testing, where, instead\nof using a random subset of the benchmark questions, informative questions are\nadaptively chosen based on the current estimation of LLM performance.\nExperiments on 22 common natural language benchmarks and 172 LMs show that this\napproach is more reliable and efficient compared to current common practice.",

The analysis is restricted to orbits confined to\nthe reflection-symmetric plane of the spheroidal configuration. Focusing on the\ninternal gravitational potential of a spheroidal body with both homogeneous and\ninhomogeneous density profiles, we elucidate how the ratio of local density to\naverage density governs the extended mass effect on the periapsis shift. By\nanalyzing the orbital angular frequency, along with the radial and vertical\nepicyclic frequencies, we demonstrate that in the uniform density case (i.e.,\nthe Maclaurin spheroid), where the potential takes the form of a harmonic\noscillator, the periapsis exhibits a constant retrograde shift of $-\\pi$. In\ncontrast, in regions where density inhomogeneity and spheroidal deformation (in\nboth prolate and oblate forms) are significant, the periapsis shift varies with\nthe guiding orbital radius due to local density contrast and deformation\neffects. The results indicate that oblate deformation suppresses the extended\nmass effect associated with the ratio of local density to average density,\nwhereas prolate deformation amplifies it. Furthermore, by varying the density\ndistribution parameters, we establish the conditions for orbital stability and\nidentify the emergence of marginally stable orbits.",

    "abstract": "Ease of access to data, tools and models expedites scientific research. In\nstructural biology there are now numerous open repositories of experimental and\nsimulated datasets. Being able to easily access and utilise these is crucial\nfor allowing researchers to make optimal use of their research effort. The\ntools presented here are useful for collating existing public cryoEM datasets\nand/or creating new synthetic cryoEM datasets to aid the development of novel\ndata processing and interpretation algorithms. In recent years, structural\nbiology has seen the development of a multitude of machine-learning based\nalgorithms for aiding numerous steps in the processing and reconstruction of\nexperimental datasets and the use of these approaches has become widespread.\nDeveloping such techniques in structural biology requires access to large\ndatasets which can be cumbersome to curate and unwieldy to make use of. In this\npaper we present a suite of Python software packages which we collectively\nrefer to as PERC (profet, EMPIARreader and CAKED). These are designed to reduce\nthe burden which data curation places upon structural biology research. The\nprotein structure fetcher (profet) package allows users to conveniently\ndownload and cleave sequences or structures from the Protein Data Bank or\nAlphafold databases. EMPIARreader allows lazy loading of Electron Microscopy\nPublic Image Archive datasets in a machine-learning compatible structure. The\nClass Aggregator for Key Electron-microscopy Data (CAKED) package is designed\nto seamlessly facilitate the training of machine learning models on electron\nmicroscopy data, including electron-cryo-microscopy-specific data augmentation\nand labelling. These packages may be utilised independently or as building\nblocks in workflows. All are available in open source repositories and designed\nto be easily extensible to facilitate more advanced workflows if required.",

While text-based methods excel at semantic manipulations through\ntextual prompts, they often struggle with precise geometric details (e.g.,\nposes and viewpoint changes). Reference-based editing, on the other hand,\ntypically focuses on style or appearance and fails at non-rigid\ntransformations. By explicitly learning the editing transformation from a\nsource-target pair, Edit Transfer mitigates the limitations of both text-only\nand appearance-centric references. Drawing inspiration from in-context learning\nin large language models, we propose a visual relation in-context learning\nparadigm, building upon a DiT-based text-to-image model. We arrange the edited\nexample and the query image into a unified four-panel composite, then apply\nlightweight LoRA fine-tuning to capture complex spatial transformations from\nminimal examples.

    "abstract": "Repositioning drug-disease relationships has always been a hot field of\nresearch. However, actual cases of biologically validated drug relocation\nremain very limited, and existing models have not yet fully utilized the\nstructural information of the drug. Furthermore, most repositioning models are\nonly used to complete the relationship matrix, and their practicality is poor\nwhen dealing with drug cold start problems. This paper proposes a\nstructure-enhanced multimodal relationship prediction model (SMRP). SMPR is\nbased on the SMILE structure of the drug, using the Mol2VEC method to generate\ndrug embedded representations, and learn disease embedded representations\nthrough heterogeneous network graph neural networks. Ultimately, a drug-disease\nrelationship matrix is constructed. In addition, to reduce the difficulty of\nusers' use, SMPR also provides a cold start interface based on structural\nsimilarity based on reposition results to simply and quickly predict\ndrug-related diseases. The repositioning ability and cold start capability of\nthe model are verified from multiple perspectives. While the AUC and ACUPR\nscores of repositioning reach 99% and 61% respectively, the AUC of cold start\nachieve 80%. In particular, the cold start Recall indicator can reach more than\n70%, which means that SMPR is more sensitive to positive samples. Finally, case\nanalysis is used to verify the practical value of the model and visual analysis\ndirectly demonstrates the improvement of the structure to the model. For quick\nuse, we also provide local deployment of the model and package it into an\nexecutable program.",

    "abstract": "Despite the growing accessibility of skeletal motion data, integrating it for\nanimating character meshes remains challenging due to diverse configurations of\nboth skeletons and meshes. Specifically, the body scale and bone lengths of the\nskeleton should be adjusted in accordance with the size and proportions of the\nmesh, ensuring that all joints are accurately positioned within the character\nmesh. Furthermore, defining skinning weights is complicated by variations in\nskeletal configurations, such as the number of joints and their hierarchy, as\nwell as differences in mesh configurations, including their connectivity and\nshapes. While existing approaches have made efforts to automate this process,\nthey hardly address the variations in both skeletal and mesh configurations. In\nthis paper, we present a novel method for the automatic rigging and skinning of\ncharacter meshes using skeletal motion data, accommodating arbitrary\nconfigurations of both meshes and skeletons. The proposed method predicts the\noptimal skeleton aligned with the size and proportion of the mesh as well as\ndefines skinning weights for various mesh-skeleton configurations, without\nrequiring explicit supervision tailored to each of them. By incorporating\nDiffusion 3D Features (Diff3F) as semantic descriptors of character meshes, our\nmethod achieves robust generalization across different configurations. To\nassess the performance of our method in comparison to existing approaches, we\nconducted comprehensive evaluations encompassing both quantitative and\nqualitative analyses, specifically examining the predicted skeletons, skinning\nweights, and deformation quality.",

However,\noptimizing these resonators simultaneously for high internal quality factors\n($Q_i$) and resilience to strong magnetic fields remains challenging. In this\nstudy, we systematically compare superconducting resonators fabricated from\nniobium nitride (NbN) and granular aluminum (grAl) thin films, each having\nsimilar kinetic inductance values ($L_k \\sim 100$ pH/sq). At zero magnetic\nfield, resonators made from grAl exhibit higher $Q_i$ compared to their NbN\ncounterparts. However, under applied magnetic fields, NbN resonators\ndemonstrate significantly better resilience. Moreover, NbN resonators exhibit\nan unexpected increase in $Q_i$ at intermediate in-plane magnetic fields\n($B_{\\parallel} \\sim 1$ T), which we attribute to an enhanced frequency\ndetuning that reduce coupling to two-level system defects. In contrast, grAl\nresonators show a distinct critical field above which $Q_i$ rapidly decreases,\nstrongly depending on resonator cross-section respect to the applied field\ndirection. Characterization of the nonlinear properties at zero magnetic field\nreveals that the self-Kerr coefficient in grAl resonators is more than an order\nof magnitude higher than in NbN resonators, making grAl particularly attractive\nfor applications requiring pronounced nonlinear interactions. Our findings\nillustrate a clear trade-off between the two materials: NbN offers superior\nmagnetic-field resilience beneficial for hybrid circuit quantum electrodynamics\napplications, while grAl is more advantageous in low-field regimes demanding\nhigh impedance and strong nonlinearity.",

These\nlarge-scale VDMs have demonstrated significant improvements over smaller-scale\nVDMs across multiple dimensions, including enhanced visual quality and more\nnatural motion dynamics. However, these models face two major limitations: (1)\nHigh inference overhead: Large-scale VDMs require approximately 10 minutes to\nsynthesize a 28-step video on a single H100 GPU. (2) Limited in portrait video\nsynthesis: Models like WanX-I2V and HunyuanVideo-I2V often produce unnatural\nfacial expressions and movements in portrait videos. To address these\nchallenges, we propose MagicDistillation, a novel framework designed to reduce\ninference overhead while ensuring the generalization of VDMs for portrait video\nsynthesis. Specifically, we primarily use sufficiently high-quality talking\nvideo to fine-tune Magic141, which is dedicated to portrait video synthesis. We\nthen employ LoRA to effectively and efficiently fine-tune the fake DiT within\nthe step distillation framework known as distribution matching distillation\n(DMD). Following this, we apply weak-to-strong (W2S) distribution matching and\nminimize the discrepancy between the fake data distribution and the ground\ntruth distribution, thereby improving the visual fidelity and motion dynamics\nof the synthesized videos. Experimental results on portrait video synthesis\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of MagicDistillation, as our method surpasses\nEuler, LCM, and DMD baselines in both FID/FVD metrics and VBench. Moreover,\nMagicDistillation, requiring only 4 steps, also outperforms WanX-I2V (14B) and\nHunyuanVideo-I2V (13B) on visualization and VBench.

The limited horizontal\nresolution of Global Climate Models is among the primary factors undermining\ntheir skill in this context. The physical mechanisms driving the onset and\ndevelopment of precipitation, especially in extreme events, operate at\nspatio-temporal scales smaller than those numerically resolved, thus struggling\nto be captured accurately. In order to circumvent this limitation, several\ndownscaling approaches have been developed over the last decades to address the\ndiscrepancy between the spatial resolution of models output and the resolution\nrequired by local-scale applications. In this paper, we introduce RainScaleGAN,\na conditional deep convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for\nprecipitation downscaling. GANs have been effectively used in image\nsuper-resolution, an approach highly relevant for downscaling tasks.\nRainScaleGAN's capabilities are tested in a perfect-model setup, where the\nspatial resolution of a precipitation dataset is artificially degraded from\n0.25$^{\\circ}\\times$0.25$^{\\circ}$ to 2$^{\\circ}\\times$2$^\\circ$, and\nRainScaleGAN is used to restore it. The developed model outperforms one of the\nleading precipitation downscaling method found in the literature. RainScaleGAN\nnot only generates a synthetic dataset featuring plausible high-resolution\nspatial patterns and intensities, but also produces a precipitation\ndistribution with statistics closely mirroring those of the ground-truth\ndataset.

    "abstract": "Determining the nature of emission processes at the heart of quasars is\ncritical for understanding environments of supermassive black holes. One of the\nkey open questions is the origin of long-wavelength emission from radio-quiet\nquasars. The proposed mechanisms span a broad range, from central star\nformation to dusty torus, low-power jets, or coronal emission from the\ninnermost accretion disk. Distinguishing between these scenarios requires\nprobing spatial scales $\\leq$0.01 pc, beyond the reach of any current\nmillimetre-wave telescope. Fortunately, in gravitationally lensed quasars,\ncompact mm-wave emission might be microlensed by stars in the foreground\ngalaxy, providing strong constraints on the source size. We report a striking\nchange in rest-frame 1.3-mm flux-ratios in RXJ1131-1231, a quadruply-lensed\nquasar at z = 0.658, observed by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter\nArray (ALMA) in 2015 and 2020. The observed flux-ratio variability is\nconsistent with microlensing of a very compact source with a half-light radius\n$\\leq$50 astronomical units. The compactness of the source leaves coronal\nemission as the most likely scenario. Furthermore, the inferred mm-wave and\nX-ray luminosities follow the characteristic G\\\"udel-Benz relationship for\ncoronal emission. These observations represent the first unambiguous evidence\nfor coronae as the dominant mechanism for long-wavelength emission in\nradio-quiet quasars.",

Recent breakthroughs in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have shown\nsignificant promise in development of advanced Deep Learning (DL) architectures\nfor breast cancer diagnosis through mammography. In this context, the paper\nfocuses on the integration of AI within a Human-Centric workflow to enhance\nbreast cancer diagnostics. Key challenges are, however, largely overlooked such\nas reliance on detailed tumor annotations and susceptibility to missing views,\nparticularly during test time. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid,\nmulti-scale and multi-view Swin Transformer-based framework (MSMV-Swin) that\nenhances diagnostic robustness and accuracy. The proposed MSMV-Swin framework\nis designed to work as a decision-support tool, helping radiologists analyze\nmulti-view mammograms more effectively.

The\nintegration of contextual and localized data ensures that MSMV-Swin's outputs\nalign with the way radiologists interpret mammograms, fostering better human-AI\ninteraction and trust. A hybrid fusion structure is then designed to ensure\nrobustness against missing views, a common occurrence in clinical practice when\nonly a single mammogram view is available.",

LIMCA systematically explores the IMC design\nspace by leveraging a structured dataset and LLM-based performance evaluation.\nOur experimental results on MNIST classification demonstrate that LIMCA\nsuccessfully generates crossbar designs achieving $\\geq$96% accuracy while\nmaintaining a power consumption $\\leq$3W, making this the first work in\nLLM-assisted IMC design space exploration. Compared to existing frameworks,\nLIMCA provides an automated, scalable, and hardware-aware solution, reducing\ndesign exploration time while ensuring user-constrained performance trade-offs.",

    "abstract": "Although existing text-to-motion (T2M) methods can produce realistic human\nmotion from text description, it is still difficult to align the generated\nmotion with the desired postures since using text alone is insufficient for\nprecisely describing diverse postures. To achieve more controllable generation,\nan intuitive way is to allow the user to input a few motion frames describing\nprecise desired postures. Thus, we explore a new Text-Frame-to-Motion (TF2M)\ngeneration task that aims to generate motions from text and very few given\nframes. Intuitively, the closer a frame is to a given frame, the lower the\nuncertainty of this frame is when conditioned on this given frame. Hence, we\npropose a novel Progressive Motion Generation (PMG) method to progressively\ngenerate a motion from the frames with low uncertainty to those with high\nuncertainty in multiple stages. During each stage, new frames are generated by\na Text-Frame Guided Generator conditioned on frame-aware semantics of the text,\ngiven frames, and frames generated in previous stages. Additionally, to\nalleviate the train-test gap caused by multi-stage accumulation of incorrectly\ngenerated frames during testing, we propose a Pseudo-frame Replacement Strategy\nfor training. Experimental results show that our PMG outperforms existing T2M\ngeneration methods by a large margin with even one given frame, validating the\neffectiveness of our PMG.

    "abstract": "Magnetic impurities are known to degrade superconductivity. For this reason,\nphysical vapor deposition chambers that have previously been used for magnetic\nmaterials have generally been avoided for making high-quality superconducting\nresonator devices. In this article, we show by example that such chambers can\nbe used: with Nb films sputtered in a chamber that continues to be used for\nmagnetic materials, we demonstrate compact (3 {\\mu}m gap) coplanar waveguide\nresonators with low-power internal quality factors near one million. We achieve\nthis using a resist strip bath with no post-fabrication acid treatment, which\nresults in performance comparable to previous strip baths with acid treatments.\nWe also find evidence that this improved resist strip bath provides a better\nsurface chemical template for post-fabrication hydrogen fluoride processing.\nThese results are consistent across three Si substrate preparation methods,\nincluding a \\SI{700}{\\celsius} anneal.",

    "abstract": "The article considers the nonlinear inverse problem of identifying the\nmaterial parameters in viscoelastic structures based on a generalized Maxwell\nmodel. The aim is to reconstruct the model parameters from stress data acquired\nfrom a relaxation experiment, where the number of Maxwell elements, and thus\nthe number of material parameters themselves, are assumed to be unknown. This\nimplies that the forward operator acts on a Cartesian product of a semigroup\n(of integers) and a Hilbert space and demands for an extension of existing\nregularization theory. We develop a stable reconstruction procedure by applying\nBayesian inversion to this setting. We use an appropriate binomial prior which\ntakes the integer setting for the number of Maxwell elements into account and\nat the same time computes the underlying material parameters. We extend the\nregularization theory for inverse problems to this special setup and prove\nexistence, stability and convergence of the computed solution. The theoretical\nresults are evaluated by extensive numerical tests.",

    "abstract": "The recurrent nova RS Ophiuchi (RS Oph) underwent a thermonuclear eruption in\nAugust 2021. In this event, RS Oph was detected by the High Energy Stereoscopic\nSystem (H.E.S.S.), the Major Atmospheric Gamma Imaging Cherenkov (MAGIC), and\nthe first Large-Sized Telescope (LST-1) of the future Cherenkov Telescope Array\nObservatory (CTAO) at very-high gamma-ray energies above 100 GeV. This means\nthat novae are a new class of very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray emitters. We\nreport the analysis of the RS Oph observations with LST-1. We constrain the\nparticle population that causes the observed emission in hadronic and leptonic\nscenarios. Additionally, we study the prospects of detecting further novae\nusing LST-1 and the upcoming LST array of CTAO-North. We conducted\ntarget-of-opportunity observations with LST-1 from the first day of this nova\nevent. The data were analysed in the framework of cta-lstchain and Gammapy, the\nofficial CTAO-LST reconstruction and analysis packages. One-zone hadronic and\nleptonic models were considered to model the gamma-ray emission of RS Oph using\nthe spectral information from Fermi-LAT and LST-1, together with public data\nfrom the MAGIC and H.E.S.S. telescopes. RS Oph was detected at $6.6\\sigma$ with\nLST-1 in the first 6.35 hours of observations following the eruption. The\nhadronic scenario is preferred over the leptonic scenario considering a proton\nenergy spectrum with a power-law model with an exponential cutoff whose\nposition increases from $(0.26\\pm 0.08)$ TeV on day 1 up to $(1.6\\pm 0.6)$ TeV\non day 4 after the eruption. The deep sensitivity and low energy threshold of\nthe LST-1/LST array will allow us to detect faint novae and increase their\ndiscovery rate.",

In this work, we study the role of\nrank-one qubit positive operator-valued measures (POVMs) in DI scenarios. This\nclass includes all qubit extremal POVMs, i.e., those measurements that cannot\nbe realized by randomly choosing among others, as well as part of non-extremal\nPOVMs, which have recently been shown to be useful for security applications in\nsequential quantum protocols. We demonstrate that any rank-one POVM can\ngenerate correlations in bipartite scenarios that saturate a Tsirelson\ninequality, i.e., a quantum bound on linear combinations of outcome statistics,\nwhen the two parties share an arbitrary entangled two-qubit state and some\nother self-tested measurements are performed. For extremal POVMs, such\nsaturation allows for an explicit calculation of the guessing probability and\nthe worst-case conditional von Neumann entropy. From the Tsirelson inequality,\nwe establish a randomness certification method that facilitates numerical\nsimulations and noise analysis. To test its feasibility, we performed a\nproof-of-concept experiment employing a three-outcome POVM on tilted entangled\nstates under experimental non-idealities. We further explore the case of\nnon-extremal POVMs, providing insights into their role in DI protocols.",

We propose LLM-Match, a novel framework for patient\nmatching leveraging fine-tuned open-source large language models. Our approach\nconsists of four key components. First, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)\nmodule extracts relevant patient context from a vast pool of electronic health\nrecords (EHRs). Second, a prompt generation module constructs input prompts by\nintegrating trial eligibility criteria (both inclusion and exclusion criteria),\npatient context, and system instructions. Third, a fine-tuning module with a\nclassification head optimizes the model parameters using structured prompts and\nground-truth labels. Fourth, an evaluation module assesses the fine-tuned\nmodel's performance on the testing datasets. We evaluated LLM-Match on four\nopen datasets - n2c2, SIGIR, TREC 2021, and TREC 2022 - using open-source\nmodels, comparing it against TrialGPT, Zero-Shot, and GPT-4-based closed\nmodels. LLM-Match outperformed all baselines.",

    "abstract": "The Pleiades is a young open cluster that has not yet dynamically relaxed,\nmaking it an ideal target to observe various internal dynamical effects. By\nemploying a well-defined sample of main-sequence (MS) cluster members,\nincluding both MS single stars and unresolved MS+MS binaries, we revisited\ntheir individual masses and mass functions and quantified the mass dependence\nof their radial distributions. We found that the mass function of binaries is\nmore top-heavy than that of single stars. Significant mass segregation is\nobserved for both single and binary populations respectively, with more massive\nobjects concentrated towards the cluster center. Notably, within given mass\nranges, binaries are distributed more scattered than single stars, providing\ndirect evidence for more efficient dynamical disruption of binaries in the\ninner region. The radial distribution of the binary fraction, expressed as the\n$f_{\\rm b}-R$ relation can be characterized by a bimodal shape, with higher\n$f_{\\rm b}$ values in both innermost and outermost regions of the cluster. The\nlower-mass subsample exhibits a monotonic increase in $f_{\\rm b}$ with radius,\nreflecting the impact of binary disruption. Conversely, for the higher-mass\nsubsample, $f_{\\rm b}$ decreases with radius. It can be explained that these\nmassive cluster members, which possess higher binary probabilities, have\nalready undergone significant mass segregation. All these observational\nevidence and analyses related to the radial mass distribution imply that the\nPleiades is currently undergoing a complicated interplay of various internal\ndynamical effects, of which the modulation between mass segregation and binary\ndisruption is particularly pronounced.",

    "abstract": "As requirements drift with rapid iterations, agile development becomes the\ndominant paradigm. Goal-driven Requirements Elicitation (RE) is a pivotal yet\nchallenging task in agile project development due to its heavy tangling with\nadaptive planning and efficient collaboration. Recently, AI agents have shown\npromising ability in supporting requirements analysis by saving significant\ntime and effort for stakeholders. However, current research mainly focuses on\nfunctional RE, and research works have not been reported bridging the long\njourney from goal to user stories. Moreover, considering the cost of LLM\nfacilities and the need for data and idea protection, privately hosted\nsmall-sized LLM should be further utilized in RE. To address these challenges,\nwe propose Goal2Story, a multi-agent fleet that adopts the Impact Mapping (IM)\nframework while merely using cost-effective sLLMs for goal-driven RE. Moreover,\nwe introduce a StorySeek dataset that contains over 1,000 user stories (USs)\nwith corresponding goals and project context information, as well as the\nsemi-automatic dataset construction method. For evaluation, we proposed two\nmetrics: Factuality Hit Rate (FHR) to measure consistency between the generated\nUSs with the dataset and Quality And Consistency Evaluation (QuACE) to evaluate\nthe quality of the generated USs.

    "abstract": "Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has overwhelmed healthcare systems,\nemphasizing the need for AI-driven tools to assist in rapid and accurate\npatient prognosis. Chest X-ray imaging is a widely available diagnostic tool,\nbut existing methods for prognosis classification lack scalability and\nefficiency. Objective: This study presents a high-accuracy deep learning model\nfor classifying COVID-19 severity (Mild, Moderate, and Severe) using Chest\nX-ray images, developed on Microsoft Azure Custom Vision. Methods: Using a\ndataset of 1,103 confirmed COVID-19 X-ray images from AIforCOVID, we trained\nand validated a deep learning model leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks\n(CNNs). The model was evaluated on an unseen dataset to measure accuracy,\nprecision, and recall. Results: Our model achieved an average accuracy of 97%,\nwith specificity of 99%, sensitivity of 87%, and an F1-score of 93.11%. When\nclassifying COVID-19 severity, the model achieved accuracies of 89.03% (Mild),\n95.77% (Moderate), and 81.16% (Severe). These results demonstrate the model's\npotential for real-world clinical applications, aiding in faster\ndecision-making and improved resource allocation. Conclusion: AI-driven\nprognosis classification using deep learning can significantly enhance COVID-19\npatient management, enabling early intervention and efficient triaging. Our\nstudy provides a scalable, high-accuracy AI framework for integrating deep\nlearning into routine clinical workflows. Future work should focus on expanding\ndatasets, external validation, and regulatory compliance to facilitate clinical\nadoption.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a novel large language model (LLM)-driven agent framework, which\niteratively refines queries and filters contextual evidence by leveraging\ndynamically evolving knowledge. A defining feature of the system is its\ndecoupling of external sources from an internal knowledge cache that is\nprogressively updated to guide both query generation and evidence selection.\nThis design mitigates bias-reinforcement loops and enables dynamic, trackable\nsearch exploration paths, thereby optimizing the trade-off between exploring\ndiverse information and maintaining accuracy through autonomous agent\ndecision-making. Our approach is evaluated on a broad range of open-domain\nquestion answering benchmarks, including multi-step tasks that mirror\nreal-world scenarios where integrating information from multiple sources is\ncritical, especially given the vulnerabilities of LLMs that lack explicit\nreasoning or planning capabilities. The results show that the proposed system\nnot only outperforms single-step baselines regardless of task difficulty but\nalso, compared to conventional iterative retrieval methods, demonstrates\npronounced advantages in complex tasks through precise evidence-based reasoning\nand enhanced efficiency. The proposed system supports both competitive and\ncollaborative sharing of updated context, enabling multi-agent extension. The\nbenefits of multi-agent configurations become especially prominent as task\ndifficulty increases.

We define a cyclic tableau\nsystem for PDL with a loading mechanism to recognize successful repeats. For\nthis system, we show soundness and completeness via a game. To show\ninterpolation, we modify Maehara's method to work for tableaux with repeats: we\nfirst define pre-interpolants at each node, and then use a quasi-tableau to\ndefine interpolants for clusters (strongly connected components). In different\nterms, our method solves the fixpoint equations that characterize the desired\ninterpolants, and the method ensures that the solutions to these equations can\nbe expressed within PDL. The proof is constructive and we show how to compute\ninterpolants. We also make available a Haskell implementation of the proof\nsystem that provides interpolants.

There are newly proposed deep learning-based methods employing\ngraph random neural networks or contrastive learning to extract graph features,\ndemonstrating superior performance compared to traditional statistical methods,\nbut their experimental results also demonstrate that these methods do not\nalways working well across different metrics. Although there are overlaps among\nthese metrics, they are generally not interchangeable, each evaluating\ngenerative models from a different perspective.

We conduct extensive experiments on graphs\nand empirically demonstrate that our method can be more reliable and effective\nthan previously proposed methods across a number of GGM evaluation metrics,\nsuch as \"Fr\\'echet Distance (FD)\" and \"MMD Linear\".

It is known that charge storage in carbon nanostructures\ncontaining disordered sp2-domains is determined by their wettability, surface\narea, and porosity. However, their charge-storage performance is limited to the\nareal capacitance of the order of a few mF/cm2. We enhanced the supercapacitor\nperformance of nitrogen-doped amorphous carbon nanofoam by engineering its\nwettability and sp2-C/sp3-C ratio by vacuum annealing. The specific capacitance\nwas enhanced by about fifty times and the device voltage increased from 0.8 to\n1.1 V compared to as-grown carbon nanofoam. In addition, we examined for the\nfirst time the initial increase in specific capacitance of the aqueous\nsymmetric supercapacitor with respect to the scan rate, employing in-situ\nmeasurements coupling Raman spectroscopy and electrochemistry. We attribute\nthis effect, observed but generally not explained in previous works in the\nliterature, to the electrochemical activation induced by structural changes\nduring the charge storage performance.

We develop a\nmicrophysical model for galactic outflows driven by a continuous central\nfeedback source, incorporating a simplified treatment of CRs. The model\nparameters are linked to the effective properties of a starburst. By analyzing\nits asymptotic behavior, we derive a criterion for launching starburst-driven\ngalactic outflows and determine the corresponding outflow velocities. Results.\nWe find that in the absence of CRs, galactic outflows can only be launched if\nthe star-formation rate (SFR) surface density exceeds a critical threshold\nproportional to the dynamical equilibrium pressure. In contrast, CRs can always\ndrive slow outflows. CRs dominate in systems with SFR surface densities below\nthe critical threshold but become negligible in highly star-forming systems.\nHowever, in older systems with established CR halos, the CR contribution to\noutflows diminishes once the outflow reaches the galactic scale height,\nrendering CRs ineffective in sustaining outflows in such systems. Conclusions.\nOver cosmic time, galaxies accumulate relic CRs in their halos, providing\nadditional non-thermal pressure support that suppresses low-velocity CR-driven\noutflows. We predict that such low-velocity outflows are expected only in young\nsystems that have not yet built up significant CR halos. In contrast, fast\noutflows in starburst galaxies, where the SFR surface density exceeds the\ncritical threshold, are primarily driven by momentum injection and remain\nlargely unaffected by CR halos.",

Unlike objective tasks\nsuch as object/scene recognition, perceptual tasks rely on subjective human\nassessments, making its data-labeling difficult. The scarcity of such\nhuman-annotated data results in small datasets leading to poor generalization.\nTypically, specialized models were designed for each perceptual task, tailored\nto its unique characteristics and its own training dataset. We propose a\nunified architectural framework for solving multiple different perceptual tasks\nleveraging CLIP as a prior. Our approach is based on recent cognitive findings\nwhich indicate that CLIP correlates well with human judgment. While CLIP was\nexplicitly trained to align images and text, it implicitly also learned human\ninclinations. We attribute this to the inclusion of human-written image\ncaptions in CLIP's training data, which contain not only factual image\ndescriptions, but inevitably also human sentiments and emotions. This makes\nCLIP a particularly strong prior for perceptual tasks. Accordingly, we suggest\nthat minimal adaptation of CLIP suffices for solving a variety of perceptual\ntasks. Our simple unified framework employs a lightweight adaptation to\nfine-tune CLIP to each task, without requiring any task-specific architectural\nchanges. We evaluate our approach on three tasks: (i) Image Memorability\nPrediction, (ii) No-reference Image Quality Assessment, and (iii) Visual\nEmotion Analysis. Our model achieves state-of-the-art results on all three\ntasks, while demonstrating improved generalization across different datasets.",

These forests\nplay a vital role in supporting small rural communities, but face increasing\npressures and restrictions on their use. This research aims to assign a\nmonetary value to forest conservation, considering the region's specific\nsocio-economic context. Strategies for empowering local residents as key actors\nin developing sustainable cross-border initiatives are further investigated.\nEmploying the contingent valuation method, a survey of 350 local residents and\ninternational users was conducted to assess their willigness to pay fo forest\nconservation efforts. Logistic regression analysis revealed that\nsociodemographic factors, such as monthly income and preferred payment method,\nsignificantly influence both and the likehood of participation. These findingd\nhighlight the feasibility and importance of reconciling economic development\nwith ecological sustainability in this critical region.",

    "abstract": "Radar has become an essential sensor for autonomous navigation, especially in\nchallenging environments where camera and LiDAR sensors fail. 4D single-chip\nmillimeter-wave radar systems, in particular, have drawn increasing attention\nthanks to their ability to provide spatial and Doppler information with low\nhardware cost and power consumption. However, most single-chip radar systems\nusing traditional signal processing, such as Fast Fourier Transform, suffer\nfrom limited spatial resolution in radar detection, significantly limiting the\nperformance of radar-based odometry and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping\n(SLAM) systems. In this paper, we develop a novel radar signal processing\npipeline that integrates spatial domain beamforming techniques, and extend it\nto 3D Direction of Arrival estimation. Experiments using public datasets are\nconducted to evaluate and compare the performance of our proposed signal\nprocessing pipeline against traditional methodologies. These tests specifically\nfocus on assessing structural precision across diverse scenes and measuring\nodometry accuracy in different radar odometry systems. This research\ndemonstrates the feasibility of achieving more accurate radar odometry by\nsimply replacing the standard FFT-based processing with the proposed pipeline.\nThe codes are available at GitHub*.",

However, current gaze-based assistive systems mainly help\nusers with basic grasping actions, offering limited support. Moreover, the\nrestricted intent recognition capability constrains the assistive system's\nability to provide diverse assistance functions. In this paper, we propose an\nopen implicit intention recognition framework powered by Large Language Model\n(LLM) and Vision Foundation Model (VFM), which can process gaze input and\nrecognize user intents that are not confined to predefined or specific\nscenarios. Furthermore, we implement a gaze-driven LLM-enhanced assistive robot\nsystem (MindEye-OmniAssist) that recognizes user's intentions through gaze and\nassists in completing task. To achieve this, the system utilizes open\nvocabulary object detector, intention recognition network and LLM to infer\ntheir full intentions. By integrating eye movement feedback and LLM, it\ngenerates action sequences to assist the user in completing tasks. Real-world\nexperiments have been conducted for assistive tasks, and the system achieved an\noverall success rate of 41/55 across various undefined tasks.

Meanwhile,\nestimating a mathematical model from experimental data is a vital step in\nunderstanding the dynamics of real-world complex systems. In coupled oscillator\nsystems, identifying the type of interaction (e.g. pairwise or three-body) of a\nnetwork is challenging, because different interactions can induce similar\ndynamical states and bifurcations.

The\nproposed method can successfully classify the type of interaction and infer the\nprobabilities of the existence of pairwise and three-body couplings.

    "abstract": "Scene-aware Adaptive Compressive Sensing (ACS) has attracted significant\ninterest due to its promising capability for efficient and high-fidelity\nacquisition of scene images. ACS typically prescribes adaptive sampling\nallocation (ASA) based on previous samples in the absence of ground truth.\nHowever, when confronting unknown scenes, existing ACS methods often lack\naccurate judgment and robust feedback mechanisms for ASA, thus limiting the\nhigh-fidelity sensing of the scene. In this paper, we introduce a Sampling\nInnovation-Based ACS (SIB-ACS) method that can effectively identify and\nallocate sampling to challenging image reconstruction areas, culminating in\nhigh-fidelity image reconstruction. An innovation criterion is proposed to\njudge ASA by predicting the decrease in image reconstruction error attributable\nto sampling increments, thereby directing more samples towards regions where\nthe reconstruction error diminishes significantly. A sampling innovation-guided\nmulti-stage adaptive sampling (AS) framework is proposed, which iteratively\nrefines the ASA through a multi-stage feedback process. For image\nreconstruction, we propose a Principal Component Compressed Domain Network\n(PCCD-Net), which efficiently and faithfully reconstructs images under AS\nscenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed SIB-ACS method\nsignificantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of image\nreconstruction fidelity and visual effects.

When\nabsent in the test data, these unintended associations between non-target\nattributes and target labels lead to poor generalization. This paper addresses\nthis problem from a model optimization perspective and proposes a novel method,\nGradient Extrapolation for Debiased Representation Learning (GERNE), designed\nto learn debiased representations in both known and unknown attribute training\ncases. GERNE uses two distinct batches with different amounts of spurious\ncorrelations and defines the target gradient as a linear extrapolation of the\ngradients computed from each batch's loss. Our analysis shows that when the\nextrapolated gradient points toward the batch gradient with fewer spurious\ncorrelations, it effectively guides training toward learning a debiased model.\nGERNE serves as a general framework for debiasing, encompassing ERM and\nResampling methods as special cases. We derive the theoretical upper and lower\nbounds of the extrapolation factor employed by GERNE. By tuning this factor,\nGERNE can adapt to maximize either Group-Balanced Accuracy (GBA) or Worst-Group\nAccuracy (WGA). We validate GERNE on five vision and one NLP benchmarks,\ndemonstrating competitive and often superior performance compared to\nstate-of-the-art baselines.

Our multiscale approach is suitable both for\nexamining atomic short-range order in the solid solution, as well as for\nstudying the emergence of long-range crystallographic order with decreasing\ntemperature. In both alloys considered in this work, in alignment with\nexperimental observations, we predict a B2 (CsCl) chemical ordering emerging at\nhigh temperatures, which is driven primarily by Al and Ti, with other elements\nexpressing weaker site preferences. The predicted B2 ordering temperature for\nAlTiVNb is higher than that for AlTiCrMo. These chemical orderings are\ndiscussed in terms of the alloys' electronic structure, with hybridisation\nbetween the $sp$ states of Al and the $d$ states of the transition metals\nunderstood to play an important role. Within our modelling, the chemically\nordered B2 phases for both alloys have an increased predicted residual\nresistivity compared to the A2 (disordered bcc) phases. These increased\nresistivity values are understood to originate in a reduction in the electronic\ndensity of states at the Fermi level, in conjunction with qualitative changes\nto the alloys' smeared-out Fermi surfaces.

Composite\nbreathers interact trivially both with each other and with a fundamental\nsoliton or breather. Explicit formulas for the scattering coefficients that\ncharacterize fundamental and composite breathers are given.

However, we discover that the\nquality of pseudo-label is largely deteriorated by data heterogeneity, an\nintrinsic facet of federated learning. In this paper, we study the problem of\nFSSL in-depth and show that (1) heterogeneity exacerbates pseudo-label\nmismatches, further degrading model performance and convergence, and (2) local\nand global models' predictive tendencies diverge as heterogeneity increases.\nMotivated by these findings, we propose a simple and effective method called\nSemi-supervised Aggregation for Globally-Enhanced Ensemble (SAGE), that can\nflexibly correct pseudo-labels based on confidence discrepancies.

    "abstract": "The same real-world entity (e.g., a movie, a restaurant, a person) may be\ndescribed in various ways on different datasets. Entity Resolution (ER) aims to\nfind such different descriptions of the same entity, this way improving data\nquality and, therefore, data value. However, an ER pipeline typically involves\nseveral steps (e.g., blocking, similarity estimation, clustering), with each\nstep requiring its own configurations and tuning. The choice of the best\nconfiguration, among a vast number of possible combinations, is a\ndataset-specific and labor-intensive task both for novice and expert users,\nwhile it often requires some ground truth knowledge of real matches. In this\nwork, we examine ways of automatically configuring a state of-the-art\nend-to-end ER pipeline based on pre-trained language models under two settings:\n(i) When ground truth is available. In this case, sampling strategies that are\ntypically used for hyperparameter optimization can significantly restrict the\nsearch of the configuration space. We experimentally compare their relative\neffectiveness and time efficiency, applying them to ER pipelines for the first\ntime. (ii) When no ground truth is available. In this case, labelled data\nextracted from other datasets with available ground truth can be used to train\na regression model that predicts the relative effectiveness of parameter\nconfigurations. Experimenting with 11 ER benchmark datasets, we evaluate the\nrelative performance of existing techniques that address each problem, but have\nnot been applied to ER before.",

    "abstract": "Despite their groundbreaking performance, state-of-the-art autonomous agents\ncan misbehave when training and environmental conditions become inconsistent,\nwith minor mismatches leading to undesirable behaviors or even catastrophic\nfailures. Robustness towards these training/environment ambiguities is a core\nrequirement for intelligent agents and its fulfillment is a long-standing\nchallenge when deploying agents in the real world. Here, departing from\nmainstream views seeking robustness through training, we introduce DR-FREE, a\nfree energy model that installs this core property by design. It directly wires\nrobustness into the agent decision-making mechanisms via free energy\nminimization. By combining a robust extension of the free energy principle with\na novel resolution engine, DR-FREE returns a policy that is optimal-yet-robust\nagainst ambiguity. Moreover, for the first time, it reveals the mechanistic\nrole of ambiguity on optimal decisions and requisite Bayesian belief updating.\nWe evaluate DR-FREE on an experimental testbed involving real rovers navigating\nan ambiguous environment filled with obstacles. Across all the experiments,\nDR-FREE enables robots to successfully navigate towards their goal even when,\nin contrast, standard free energy minimizing agents that do not use DR-FREE\nfail. In short, DR-FREE can tackle scenarios that elude previous methods: this\nmilestone may inspire both deployment in multi-agent settings and, at a perhaps\ndeeper level, the quest for a biologically plausible explanation of how natural\nagents - with little or no training - survive in capricious environments.",

    "abstract": "Despite significant achievements in improving the instruction-following\ncapabilities of large language models (LLMs), the ability to process multiple\npotentially entangled or conflicting instructions remains a considerable\nchallenge. Real-world scenarios often require consistency across multiple\ninstructions over time, such as secret privacy, personal preferences, and\nprioritization, which demand sophisticated abilities to integrate multiple\nturns and carefully balance competing objectives when instructions intersect or\nconflict. This work presents a systematic investigation of LLMs' capabilities\nin handling multiple turns of instructions, covering three levels of\ndifficulty: (1) retrieving information from instructions, (2) tracking and\nreasoning across turns, and (3) resolving conflicts among instructions. We\nconstruct MultiTurnInstruct with around 1.1K high-quality multi-turn\nconversations through the human-in-the-loop approach and result in nine\ncapability categories, including statics and dynamics, reasoning, and\nmultitasking. Our finding reveals an intriguing trade-off between different\ncapabilities. While GPT models demonstrate superior memorization, they show\nreduced effectiveness in privacy-protection tasks requiring selective\ninformation withholding. Larger models exhibit stronger reasoning capabilities\nbut still struggle with resolving conflicting instructions. Importantly, these\nperformance gaps cannot be attributed solely to information loss, as models\ndemonstrate strong BLEU scores on memorization tasks but their attention\nmechanisms fail to integrate multiple related instructions effectively. These\nfindings highlight critical areas for improvement in complex real-world tasks\ninvolving multi-turn instructions.",

By\ncombining the binary mass function obtained from optical observations and a GW\nmass function, that we introduce, derived from GW observations, we demonstrate\nhow we can set improved constraints on the NS mass and break the degeneracy in\nthe mass and viewing inclination determination. We further comment on the\nuniversal relation of the error bar of the GW mass function versus GW\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and propose a simple method for the estimate of\ncapability of GW observations on mass determination with {LISA}.

    "abstract": "Alignment between human brain networks and artificial models is actively\nstudied in machine learning and neuroscience. A widely adopted approach to\nexplore their functional alignment is to identify metamers for both humans and\nmodels. Metamers refer to input stimuli that are physically different but\nequivalent within a given system. If a model's metameric space completely\nmatched the human metameric space, the model would achieve functional alignment\nwith humans. However, conventional methods lack direct ways to search for human\nmetamers. Instead, researchers first develop biologically inspired models and\nthen infer about human metamers indirectly by testing whether model metamers\nalso appear as metamers to humans. Here, we propose the Multidimensional\nAdaptive Metamer Exploration (MAME) framework, enabling direct high-dimensional\nexploration of human metameric space. MAME leverages online image generation\nguided by human perceptual feedback. Specifically, it modulates reference\nimages across multiple dimensions by leveraging hierarchical responses from\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs). Generated images are presented to\nparticipants whose perceptual discriminability is assessed in a behavioral\ntask. Based on participants' responses, subsequent image generation parameters\nare adaptively updated online. Using our MAME framework, we successfully\nmeasured a human metameric space of over fifty dimensions within a single\nexperiment. Experimental results showed that human discrimination sensitivity\nwas lower for metameric images based on low-level features compared to\nhigh-level features, which image contrast metrics could not explain. The\nfinding suggests that the model computes low-level information not essential\nfor human perception.

Such a phenomenon suggests that soft prompts can\npositively impact certain instances while negatively affecting others,\nparticularly during the later phases of reasoning. To address these challenges,\nWe first identify an information accumulation within the soft prompts. Through\ndetailed analysis, we demonstrate that this phenomenon is often accompanied by\nerroneous information flow patterns in the deeper layers of the model, which\nultimately lead to incorrect reasoning outcomes. we propose a novel method\ncalled Dynamic Prompt Corruption (DPC) to take better advantage of soft prompts\nin complex reasoning tasks, which dynamically adjusts the influence of soft\nprompts based on their impact on the reasoning process. Specifically, DPC\nconsists of two stages: Dynamic Trigger and Dynamic Corruption. First, Dynamic\nTrigger measures the impact of soft prompts, identifying whether beneficial or\ndetrimental. Then, Dynamic Corruption mitigates the negative effects of soft\nprompts by selectively masking key tokens that interfere with the reasoning\nprocess. We validate the proposed approach through extensive experiments on\nvarious LLMs and reasoning tasks, including GSM8K, MATH, and AQuA.

A novel data structure called Time and Distance Dependency Graph is\ndesigned to model gate data dependencies and physical distances from quantum\ntopologies for precise scheduling. Additionally, dynamically punching barriers\nreduces idle time in quantum circuits, further enhancing parallelism.\nSimulations show a reduction of up to 37.44% in quantum program cycle (14.19%\non average) on various NISQ devices with 53 to 127 qubits. Real-device\nexperiments on IBMQ-Brisbane demonstrate significant acceleration in quantum\ncomputing while maintaining fidelity.",

Traditional batched\nmatching methods often use fixed time intervals to accumulate ride requests\nbefore assigning matches. While this approach increases the number of available\ndrivers and passengers for matching, it fails to adapt to real-time\nsupply-demand fluctuations, often leading to longer passenger wait times and\ndriver idle periods. To address this limitation, we propose an adaptive\nride-matching strategy using deep reinforcement learning (RL) to dynamically\ndetermine when to perform matches based on real-time system conditions. Unlike\nfixed-interval approaches, our method continuously evaluates system states and\nexecutes matching at moments that minimize total passenger wait time.\nAdditionally, we incorporate a potential-based reward shaping (PBRS) mechanism\nto mitigate sparse rewards, accelerating RL training and improving decision\nquality. Extensive empirical evaluations using a realistic simulator trained on\nreal-world data demonstrate that our approach outperforms fixed-interval\nmatching strategies, significantly reducing passenger waiting times and detour\ndelays, thereby enhancing the overall efficiency of ride-hailing and\nride-pooling systems.",

To do so, we develop and validate a\nnew framework that reconstructs the DE density through a third-degree\npiece-wise polynomial interpolation, allowing for direct constraints on its\nredshift evolution without assuming any specific functional form. The strength\nof our approach resides in the choice of directly reconstructing the DE\ndensity, which provides a more straightforward relation to the distances\nmeasured by BAO than the equation of state parameter. We investigate the\nconstraining power of cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations combined\nwith supernovae (SNe) and BAO measurements. In agreement with results from\nother works, we find a preference for deviations from $\\Lambda$CDM, with a\nsignificance of $2.4\\sigma$ when using the Dark Energy Survey Year 5 (DESY5)\nSNe data, and $1.3\\sigma$ with PantheonPlus. In all the cases we consider, the\nderived DE equation of state parameter presents evidence for phantom crossing.\nBy investigating potential systematic effects in the low-redshift samples of\nDESY5 observations, we confirm that correcting for the offset in apparent\nmagnitude with respect to PantheonPlus data, as suggested in previous studies,\ncompletely removes the tension.

Instead, we propose to use\nso-called Stein estimators: we use the Stein characterizations to obtain new\nestimators for local dependency exponential random graph models.",

Robots can help to automate this process. To do so,\nthey need to be able to perceive the surrounding environment to identify target\nobjects such as trees and plants. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach\nto address the problem of hierarchical panoptic segmentation of apple orchards\non 3D data from different sensors. Our approach is able to simultaneously\nprovide semantic segmentation, instance segmentation of trunks and fruits, and\ninstance segmentation of trees (a trunk with its fruits). This allows us to\nidentify relevant information such as individual plants, fruits, and trunks,\nand capture the relationship among them, such as precisely estimate the number\nof fruits associated to each tree in an orchard. To efficiently evaluate our\napproach for hierarchical panoptic segmentation, we provide a dataset designed\nspecifically for this task. Our dataset is recorded in Bonn, Germany, in a real\napple orchard with a variety of sensors, spanning from a terrestrial laser\nscanner to a RGB-D camera mounted on different robots platforms.

However, existing studies primarily focus on logical reasoning\nand visual understanding, while the capability of MLLMs to operate effectively\nin 3D vision remains an ongoing area of exploration. In this paper, we\nintroduce a novel visual prompting method, called 3DAxisPrompt, to elicit the\n3D understanding capabilities of MLLMs in real-world scenes. More specifically,\nour method leverages the 3D coordinate axis and masks generated from the\nSegment Anything Model (SAM) to provide explicit geometric priors to MLLMs and\nthen extend their impressive 2D grounding and reasoning ability to real-world\n3D scenarios. Besides, we first provide a thorough investigation of the\npotential visual prompting formats and conclude our findings to reveal the\npotential and limits of 3D understanding capabilities in GPT-4o, as a\nrepresentative of MLLMs. Finally, we build evaluation environments with four\ndatasets, i.e., ScanRefer, ScanNet, FMB, and nuScene datasets, covering various\n3D tasks. Based on this, we conduct extensive quantitative and qualitative\nexperiments, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\nOverall, our study reveals that MLLMs, with the help of 3DAxisPrompt, can\neffectively perceive an object's 3D position in real-world scenarios.\nNevertheless, a single prompt engineering approach does not consistently\nachieve the best outcomes for all 3D tasks.

    "abstract": "Although recent methods have tried to introduce large multimodal models\n(LMMs) into industrial anomaly detection (IAD), their generalization in the IAD\nfield is far inferior to that for general purposes. We summarize the main\nreasons for this gap into two aspects. On one hand, general-purpose LMMs lack\ncognition of defects in the visual modality, thereby failing to sufficiently\nfocus on defect areas. Therefore, we propose to modify the AnyRes structure of\nthe LLaVA model, providing the potential anomalous areas identified by existing\nIAD models to the LMMs. On the other hand, existing methods mainly focus on\nidentifying defects by learning defect patterns or comparing with normal\nsamples, yet they fall short of understanding the causes of these defects.\nConsidering that the generation of defects is closely related to the\nmanufacturing process, we propose a manufacturing-driven IAD paradigm. An\ninstruction-tuning dataset for IAD (InstructIAD) and a data organization\napproach for Chain-of-Thought with manufacturing (CoT-M) are designed to\nleverage the manufacturing process for IAD. Based on the above two\nmodifications, we present Triad, a novel LMM-based method incorporating an\nexpert-guided region-of-interest tokenizer and manufacturing process for\nindustrial anomaly detection. Extensive experiments show that our Triad not\nonly demonstrates competitive performance against current LMMs but also\nachieves further improved accuracy when equipped with manufacturing processes.\nSource code, training data, and pre-trained models will be publicly available\nat https://github.com/tzjtatata/Triad.",

    "abstract": "During September 2023 the Alice ultraviolet spectrograph on the New Horizons\n(NH) spacecraft was used to map diffuse Lyman alpha (Lya) emission over most of\nthe sky, at a range of 56.9 AU from the Sun. At that distance, models predict\nthat the interplanetary medium Lya emissions result from comparable amounts of\nresonant backscattering of the solar Lya line by interstellar hydrogen atoms\n(HI) passing through the solar system, in addition to an approximately\nisotropic background of 30-70 R from the Local InterStellar Medium (LISM). The\nNH observations show no strong correlations with nearby cloud structures of the\nLISM or with expected structures of the heliosphere, such as a hydrogen wall\nassociated with the heliopause. To explain the relatively bright and uniform\nLya of the LISM we propose that hot, young stars within the Local Hot Bubble\n(LHB) shine on its interior walls, photoionizing HI atoms there. Recombination\nof these ions can account for the observed 50 R Lya background, after\namplification of the diffuse Lya by resonant scattering, although sophisticated\n(i.e., 3-D) radiative transfer models should be used to confirm this\nconjecture. Future observations of the diffuse Lya, with instruments capable of\nresolving the line profile, could provide a new window on HI populations in the\nLISM and heliosphere. The NH Alice all-sky Lya observations presented here may\nbe repeated at some point in the future, if resources allow, and the two maps\ncould be combined to provide a significant increase in angular resolution.",

The rotation law of the conducting fluid is a quasi-Keplerian one.\nWithout rotation all toroidal fields are the more destabilized the more the\nradial profiles differ from the uniformity. For medium Reynolds numbers of\nrotation, however, the behaviour of the lines of neutral stability strongly\ndepend on the magnetic Prandtl number. For Pm=1 the differential rotation\nmatches the instability lines of azimuthal fields with and without rings so\nthat the maximally possible Reynolds numbers for fields with smooth radial\nprofiles and such with rings do hardly differ. The magnetic Mach number of the\nconsidered examples are of the astrophysically relevant order of magnitude\nbetween ten and twenty.\n  The nonaxisymmetric instability fluctuations form a weak alpha effect of the\nmean-field electrodynamics which always changes its sign between the walls\nindependent of the Reynolds number, magnetic Prandtl number or the radial\nprofile of the magnetic background field. The resulting dynamo modes work on a\nsimilar axial scale as the Tayler instability, hence they are small-scale\ndynamos. The fields are axially drifting with high phase velocity where at\ncertain periods the azimuthal fields with one-ring geometry develop to fields\nwith two rings along the radius.

Commonly, agents are located on a graph and can traverse edges. This\nproblem has many variations and has been studied for decades. Two such\nvariations are the continuous-time and the lifelong MAPF problems. In the\nformer, edges have non-unit lengths and volumetric agents can traverse them at\nany real-valued time. In the latter, agents must attend to a continuous stream\nof incoming tasks. Much work has been devoted to designing solution methods\nwithin these two areas. To our knowledge, however, the combined problem of\ncontinuous-time lifelong MAPF has yet to be addressed. This work addresses\ncontinuous-time lifelong MAPF with volumetric agents by presenting the fast and\nsub-optimal Continuous-time Prioritized Lifelong Planner (CPLP). CPLP\ncontinuously assigns agents to tasks and computes plans using a combination of\ntwo path planners; one based on CCBS and the other based on SIPP. Experimental\nresults with up to 800 agents on graphs with up to 12 000 vertices demonstrate\npractical performance, where maximum planning times fall within the available\ntime budget.

Federated learning proceeds through iterative exchanges of model updates,\nwhich pose two key challenges: First, the accumulation of privacy leakage over\ntime, and second, communication latency. These two limitations are typically\naddressed separately: The former via perturbed updates to enhance privacy and\nthe latter using user selection to mitigate latency - both at the expense of\naccuracy. In this work, we propose a method that jointly addresses the\naccumulation of privacy leakage and communication latency via active user\nselection, aiming to improve the trade-off among privacy, latency, and model\nperformance. To achieve this, we construct a reward function that accounts for\nthese three objectives. Building on this reward, we propose a multi-armed\nbandit (MAB)-based algorithm, termed Privacy-aware Active User SElection\n(PAUSE) which dynamically selects a subset of users each round while ensuring\nbounded overall privacy leakage. We establish a theoretical analysis,\nsystematically showing that the reward growth rate of PAUSE follows that of the\nbest-known rate in MAB literature. To address the complexity overhead of active\nuser selection, we propose a simulated annealing-based relaxation of PAUSE and\nanalyze its ability to approximate the reward-maximizing policy under reduced\ncomplexity.

However, finetuning on LLMs will\ndiminish this general skills and continual finetuning will further cause severe\ndegradation on accumulated knowledge. Recently, Continual Learning (CL) in\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) arises which aims to continually adapt the LLMs to\nnew tasks while maintaining previously learned knowledge and inheriting general\nskills. Existing techniques either leverage previous data to replay, leading to\nextra computational costs, or utilize a single parameter-efficient module to\nlearn the downstream task, constraining new knowledge absorption with\ninterference between different tasks. Toward these issues, this paper proposes\nAnalytic Subspace Routing(ASR) to address these challenges. For each task, we\nisolate the learning within a subspace of deep layers' features via low-rank\nadaptation, eliminating knowledge interference between different tasks.\nAdditionally, we propose an analytic routing mechanism to properly utilize\nknowledge learned in different subspaces.

To cope\nwith these challenges, we analyze the restoration process in depth through a\nprogressive spectral perspective, and deconstruct the complex UHD restoration\nproblem into three progressive stages: zero-frequency enhancement,\nlow-frequency restoration, and high-frequency refinement. Building on this\ninsight, we propose a novel framework, ERR, which comprises three collaborative\nsub-networks: the zero-frequency enhancer (ZFE), the low-frequency restorer\n(LFR), and the high-frequency refiner (HFR). Specifically, the ZFE integrates\nglobal priors to learn global mapping, while the LFR restores low-frequency\ninformation, emphasizing reconstruction of coarse-grained content. Finally, the\nHFR employs our designed frequency-windowed kolmogorov-arnold networks (FW-KAN)\nto refine textures and details, producing high-quality image restoration. Our\napproach significantly outperforms previous UHD methods across various tasks,\nwith extensive ablation studies validating the effectiveness of each component.\nThe code is available at \\href{https://github.com/NJU-PCALab/ERR}{here}.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a design method for densergraph-frequency graph Fourier\nframes (DGFFs) to enhance graph signal processing and analysis. The graph\nFourier transform (GFT) enables us to analyze graph signals in the graph\nspectral domain and facilitates various graph signal processing tasks, such as\nfiltering, sampling and reconstruction, denoising, and so on. However, the\nconventional GFT faces two significant limitations. First, unlike the discrete\nFourier transform and its variants (such as discrete cosine transforms), the\ngraph frequencies of the derived graph Fourier basis (GFB) from a given graph\ntend to be unevenly distributed or localized, which leads to biased spectral\nanalysis. Second, the GFB used in GFT does not provide an efficient sparse\nrepresentation of graph signals compared to overcomplete systems like frames.\nTo overcome these challenges, we propose adding oscillating vectors with\nintermediate graph frequencies between the original vectors in the GFB for both\nundirected and directed graphs, constructing GFFs with densergraph frequencies.\nThe resulting DGFFs are expected to enable more accurate graph signal analysis.\nFurthermore, we propose a graph filtering method based on the DGFFs.

This is often true in practice due to differences in observation\nspace and action space expressiveness (e.g. perceptual or morphological\ndifferences between robots and humans). Given the learner must make some\nmistakes in the misspecified setting, interaction with the environment is\nfundamentally required to figure out which mistakes are particularly costly and\nlead to compounding errors. However, given the computational cost and safety\nconcerns inherent in interaction, we'd like to perform as little of it as\npossible while ensuring we've learned a strong policy. Accordingly, prior work\nhas proposed a flavor of efficient inverse reinforcement learning algorithms\nthat merely perform a computationally efficient local search procedure with\nstrong guarantees in the realizable setting. We first prove that under a novel\nstructural condition we term reward-agnostic policy completeness, these sorts\nof local-search based IRL algorithms are able to avoid compounding errors. We\nthen consider the question of where we should perform local search in the first\nplace, given the learner may not be able to \"walk on a tightrope\" as well as\nthe expert in the misspecified setting. We prove that in the misspecified\nsetting, it is beneficial to broaden the set of states on which local search is\nperformed to include those reachable by good policies the learner can actually\nplay. We then experimentally explore a variety of sources of misspecification\nand how offline data can be used to effectively broaden where we perform local\nsearch from.",

Existing approaches, including\nspatio-temporal graph convolutional networks (ST-GCNs), often face high memory\ndemands and struggle to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies, limiting\ntheir efficiency in clinical applications. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce DynSTG-Mamba (Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Graph Mamba), a novel framework\nthat combines DF-STGNN and STG-Mamba to enhance motion sequence modeling.

This approach ensures better feature propagation\nthrough dynamic graph structures by considering the hierarchical nature and\ndynamics of skeletal gait data.

To reduce the number of model parameters and computational costs\nwhile maintaining consistency, we propose Cross-Graph Relational Knowledge\nDistillation, a novel knowledge transfer mechanism that aligns relational\ninformation between teacher (large architecture) and student models (small\narchitecture) while using shared memory. This ensures that the interactions and\nmovement patterns of the joints are accurately preserved in the motion\nsequences.

Using a master equation formalism, we write down the\ndynamics of the corresponding (infinite) set of probability distributions: this\ntakes the form of coupled Fokker-Planck equations with model-dependent source\nand sink terms. We derive the general expression of entropy production rate for\nthis class of models in terms of path irreversibility. To demonstrate the\npractical use of this framework, we analyze a biologically motivated model\nincorporating division, death, and diffusion, where spatial correlations arise\nthrough the division process. By systematically integrating out excess degrees\nof freedom, we obtain the marginal probability distribution, enabling exact\ncalculations of key statistical properties such as average density and\ncorrelation functions. We validate our analytical results through numerical\nBrownian dynamics simulations, finding excellent agreement between theory and\nsimulation. Our method thus provides a powerful tool for tackling previously\nunsolved problems in stochastic birth-death dynamics.",

Our idea stems\nfrom the observations that 1) the degradation of hazy images varies with haze\ndensity and scene depth, and 2) clear regions play crucial cues in restoring\ndense haze regions. However, it is non-trivial to progressively refine the\nobtained codes in subsequent iterations, owing to the difficulty in determining\nwhich codes should be retained or replaced at each iteration. Another key\ninsight of our study is to propose Code-Critic to capture interrelations among\ncodes. The Code-Critic is used to evaluate code correlations and then resample\na set of codes with the highest mask scores, i.e., a higher score indicates\nthat the code is more likely to be rejected, which helps retain more accurate\ncodes and predict difficult ones.

By employing molecular simulation algorithms, we compute\nentropy landscapes as functions of both training loss and test accuracy (or\ntest loss), on networks with up to 1 million parameters, across four distinct\nmachine learning tasks: arithmetic question, real-world tabular data, image\nrecognition, and language modeling. Our results reveal the existence of\nhigh-entropy advantage, wherein high-entropy network states generally\noutperform those reached via conventional training techniques like stochastic\ngradient descent. This entropy advantage provides a thermodynamic explanation\nfor neural network generalizability: the generalizable states occupy a larger\npart of the parameter space than its non-generalizable analog at low train\nloss.

The contribution of dust, whose measured mass is still uncertain,\ncould influence this equilibrium. Aims. We aim to formulate and solve\napproximately the equations governing the hydrostatic equilibrium of a\nself-gravitating disc composed of gas and dust. Particularly, we aim to provide\na fully consistent treatment of turbulence and gravity, affecting almost\nsymmetrically gas and dust. Observationally, we study the possibility of\nindirectly measuring disc masses through gas layering and dust settling\nmeasurements. Methods. We used analytical methods to approximate the solution\nof the 1D Liouville equation with additional non-linearities governing the\nstratification of a self-gravitating protoplanetary disc. The findings were\nverified numerically and validated through physical interpretation. Results.\nFor a constant vertical stopping time profile, we discovered a nearly exact\nlayering solution valid across all self-gravity regimes for gas and dust. From\nfirst principles, we defined the Toomre parameter of a bi-fluid system as the\nharmonic average of its constituents' Toomre parameters. Based on these\nfindings, we propose a method to estimate disc mass through gas or dust\nsettling observations. We introduce a generic definition of the dust-to-gas\nscale height, applicable to complex profiles. We also identified new exact\nsolutions for benchmarking self-gravity solvers in numerical codes.\nConclusions. The hydrostatic equilibrium of a gas/dust mixture is governed by\ntheir Toomre parameters and effective relative temperature.

Therefore, non-destructively\ndetecting these imperceptible scratches on the emitting surfaces is essential\nfor enhancing yield and reducing costs. These sub-micron level scratches,\nbarely visible against the background, are extremely difficult to detect with\nconventional methods, compounded by a lack of labeled datasets. To address this\nchallenge, this paper introduces TexRecNet, a consistent texture entropy\nrecursive optimization semi-supervised network. The network, based on a\nrecursive optimization architecture, iteratively improves the detection\naccuracy of imperceptible scratch edges, using outputs from previous cycles to\ninform subsequent inputs and guide the network's positional encoding. It also\nintroduces image texture entropy, utilizing a substantial amount of unlabeled\ndata to expand the training set while maintaining training signal reliability.\nUltimately, by analyzing the inconsistency of the network output sequences\nobtained during the recursive process, a semi-supervised training strategy with\nrecursive consistency constraints is proposed, using outputs from the recursive\nprocess for non-destructive signal augmentation and consistently optimizes the\nloss function for efficient end-to-end training.

Learning-based approaches have shown promise in accelerating\npredictions but have fallen short in modeling soft-rigid interactions\neffectively.

We validate our method in a realistic\nclinical scenario, demonstrating superior performance compared to baseline GNN\nmodels and traditional FEM methods.

Our findings\nreveal that GWs induce energy shifts in hyperfine magnetic substates, modifying\nthe 21 cm line.

This leads to a critical\ndilemma for design houses: seeking to build externally accessible LLMs offering\ncompetitive Verilog coding, how can they leverage in-house IP to enhance FT\nutility while ensuring IP protection?\n  For the first time in the literature, we study this dilemma. Using LLaMA\n3.1-8B, we conduct in-house FT on a baseline Verilog dataset (RTLCoder)\nsupplemented with our own in-house IP, which is validated through multiple\ntape-outs.

However, how MLLMs process and\nutilize visual information remains unclear. In this paper, a shift in the\ndominant flow of visual information is uncovered: (1) in shallow layers, strong\ninteractions are observed between image tokens and instruction tokens, where\nmost visual information is injected into instruction tokens to form cross-modal\nsemantic representations; (2) in deeper layers, image tokens primarily interact\nwith each other, aggregating the remaining visual information to optimize\nsemantic representations within visual modality.

However, these techniques often involve quite\ncomplicated optical setups compared to standard SHG microscopes, a major\nimpediment towards more widespread utilization. Here we apply super-resolution\nradial fluctuations (SRRF), a commonly used technique for super-resolution\nfluorescence imaging, to enable super-resolution SHG microscopy.

Our analysis takes advantage of\nthe high spatiotemporal daily data resolution coming from an unprecedented\nlongitudinal micro-Big Data (GPS and PING records) to make comparisons of small\nintervention areas, while controlling for common daily trends, deterrence\n(spatial and temporal), and diffusion; to show that an average police crackdown\ncauses a 35% decrease in violent crime occurrences.

Although crime increases by 6% immediately after the\nend of a blitz, we observe lasting deterrent effects (diffusion) after 2-3\ndays. The residual deterrence cancels the relocation of the crime, and the\nintervention does not generate significant temporal displacement. In addition,\nwe do not find spatial displacement from crime in blocks up to 1.5 km from a\nblitz. This type of micropolicing tactics generates deterrence by being highly\nvisible in a street segment for a short period and intermittently quasirandom\nin space-time, which produces uncertainty that might be crucial in minimizing\nthe temporal and spatial displacement of crime.

It may also be given, or not, the\ndistance from the root to the treasure. This yields four different knowledge\ntypes that are partially ordered by their precision.

    "abstract": "Drug-resistant focal epilepsy is associated with abnormalities in the brain\nin both grey matter (GM) and superficial white matter (SWM). However, it is\nunknown if both types of abnormalities are important in supporting seizures.\nHere, we test if surgical removal of GM and/or SWM abnormalities relates to\npost-surgical seizure outcome in people with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE).\n  We analyzed structural imaging data from 143 TLE patients (pre-op dMRI and\npre-op T1-weighted MRI) and 97 healthy controls. We calculated GM volume\nabnormalities and SWM mean diffusivity abnormalities and evaluated if their\nsurgical removal distinguished seizure outcome groups post-surgically.\n  At a group level, GM and SWM abnormalities were most common in the\nipsilateral temporal lobe and hippocampus in people with TLE. Analyzing both\nmodalities together, compared to in isolation, improved surgical outcome\ndiscrimination (GM AUC = 0.68, p < 0.01, WM AUC = 0.65, p < 0.01; Union AUC =\n0.72, p < 0.01, Concordance AUC = 0.64, p = 0.04). Additionally, 100% of people\nwho had all concordant abnormal regions resected had ILAE$_{1,2}$ outcomes.\n  These findings suggest that regions identified as abnormal from both\ndiffusion-weighted and T1-weighted MRIs are involved in the epileptogenic\nnetwork and that resection of both types of abnormalities may enhance the\nchances of living without disabling seizures.",

Effective temperature (Teff=14,500) and gravity\n(log g=3.79) suggest that the star is close to terminating hydrogen burning. An\nanalysis of the spectral energy distribution allowed us to determine the\nangular diameter as well as the interstellar reddening. Using evolutionary\nmodels from the MIST database we derived the stellar mass (4.75Msun) and age\n(104^+11_-13 Myr). The spectroscopic distance (4.17 kpc), the radius (4.5\nRsun), and the luminosity (log(L/Lsun)=2.89) then result from the atmospheric\nparameters. Using Gaia proper motions, the trajectory is traced back to the\nGalactic disk to identify the place of birth in a spiral arm. The ejection\nvelocity of 92 km s^{-1} is typical for runaway stars in the halo. The age of\nthe star is larger than its time of flight (78+-4 Myr), which favors a binary\nsupernova event as the likely ejection mechanism. The TESS light curve shows\nvariations with a period of 3.58 days from which we conclude that it is a\nslowly pulsating B-star, one of very few run-away B-stars known to pulsate.",

    "abstract": "Optical microscopy has been employed to derive salient characteristics of an\nobject in various fields, including cell biology, flow cytometry, biopsy, and\nneuroscience. In particular, measuring the phase of light scattered from an\nobject aroused great interest by allowing retrieving quantitative parameters\nsuch as refractive index, an intrinsic property of a material. Reciprocal\ndiffractive imaging (RDI) has succeeded in recovering the light field scattered\nfrom diffusive objects without special restrictions on illumination and sample\nsupport from a single-shot intensity in the reference-free regime. However, RDI\nis limited to imaging samples in the diffusive regime, making application to\nbiological samples difficult. Here, we extend RDI to biological applications by\nspatially filtering the transmitted fields in the pupil plane. The proposed\nmethod is demonstrated by imaging the objects with known structures and various\nbiological samples, showing its capability as a stand-alone optical microscope.\nWe believe that the presented advance could be at the forefront of quantitative\nphase imaging due to the unique advantages the technique possesses.",

    "abstract": "Performing robotic grasping from a cluttered bin based on human instructions\nis a challenging task, as it requires understanding both the nuances of\nfree-form language and the spatial relationships between objects.\nVision-Language Models (VLMs) trained on web-scale data, such as GPT-4o, have\ndemonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities across both text and images. But\ncan they truly be used for this task in a zero-shot setting? And what are their\nlimitations?

Our method detects all\nobjects as keypoints and uses these keypoints to annotate marks on images,\naiming to facilitate GPT-4o's zero-shot spatial reasoning. This allows our\nmethod to determine whether a requested object is directly graspable or if\nother objects must be grasped and removed first.

Since the fixed graph in the MRF\nprior is for the prior probability distribution, it is not a hard constraint to\ndetermine variable selection, so the proposed model can verify known\ninformation and has the potential to identify new and novel biomarkers for\ndrawing new biological knowledge. Our simulation results show that the proposed\nBayesian Cox model with graph-based prior knowledge results in more trustable\nand stable variable selection and non-inferior survival prediction, compared to\nmethods modeling the covariates independently without any prior knowledge. The\nresults also indicate that the performance of the proposed model is robust to a\npartially correct graph in the MRF prior, meaning that in a real setting where\nnot all the true network information between covariates is known, the graph can\nstill be useful.

However, as system sizes and\nsimulation timescales increase, so does the associated computational cost. To\nextend simulated time using the same resources, a common strategy is to\nconstrain the fastest degrees of freedom, such as bond lengths, allowing for\nlarger integration time steps without compromising accuracy. The de facto\nstate-of-the-art algorithms for this purpose (SHAKE, LINCS, and P-LINCS) are\nintegrated into most molecular dynamics packages and widely adopted across the\nfield. Despite their impact, these methods exhibit limitations: all converge\nslowly when high numerical accuracy is required, and the LINCS and P-LINCS\nalgorithms cannot handle general angular constraints, limiting further\nincreases in time step.\n  In this article, we introduce ILVES, a family of parallel algorithms that\nconverge so rapidly that it is now practical to solve bond length and\nassociated angular constraint equations as accurately as the hardware will\nallow. We have integrated ILVES into Gromacs and our analysis demonstrates that\nit is superior to the state-of-the-art when constraining bond lengths. Due to\nits better convergence properties, we also show that if the time step is\nincreased up to 3.5 fs by enforcing angular constraints, ILVES enables a 1.65x\nincrease in simulated time using the same computational resources and\nwall-clock time, an outcome unattainable with current methods.

    "abstract": "While recent advancing image super-resolution (SR) techniques are continually\nimproving the perceptual quality of their outputs, they can usually fail in\nquantitative evaluations. This inconsistency leads to a growing distrust in\nexisting image metrics for SR evaluations. Though image evaluation depends on\nboth the metric and the reference ground truth (GT), researchers typically do\nnot inspect the role of GTs, as they are generally accepted as `perfect'\nreferences. However, due to the data being collected in the early years and the\nignorance of controlling other types of distortions, we point out that GTs in\nexisting SR datasets can exhibit relatively poor quality, which leads to biased\nevaluations. Following this observation, in this paper, we are interested in\nthe following questions: Are GT images in existing SR datasets 100% trustworthy\nfor model evaluations? How does GT quality affect this evaluation? And how to\nmake fair evaluations if there exist imperfect GTs? To answer these questions,\nthis paper presents two main contributions. First, by systematically analyzing\nseven state-of-the-art SR models across three real-world SR datasets, we show\nthat SR performances can be consistently affected across models by low-quality\nGTs, and models can perform quite differently when GT quality is controlled.\nSecond, we propose a novel perceptual quality metric, Relative Quality Index\n(RQI), that measures the relative quality discrepancy of image pairs, thus\nissuing the biased evaluations caused by unreliable GTs. Our proposed model\nachieves significantly better consistency with human opinions.

In this research note, we apply several well-known ranking\nmethods for incomplete round robin tournaments to the 2024/25 UEFA Champions\nLeague league phase in order to check the robustness of the official ranking,\nas well as to call the attention of organizers to the non-trivial issue of\nranking in these competitions.

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the challenge of achieving high-quality and fast image\ngeneration that aligns with complex human preferences. While recent\nadvancements in diffusion models and distillation have enabled rapid\ngeneration, the effective integration of reward feedback for improved abilities\nlike controllability and preference alignment remains a key open problem.\nExisting reward-guided post-training approaches targeting accelerated few-step\ngeneration often deem diffusion distillation losses indispensable. However, in\nthis paper, we identify an interesting yet fundamental paradigm shift: as\nconditions become more specific, well-designed reward functions emerge as the\nprimary driving force in training strong, few-step image generative models.\nMotivated by this insight, we introduce Reward-Instruct, a novel and\nsurprisingly simple reward-centric approach for converting pre-trained base\ndiffusion models into reward-enhanced few-step generators. Unlike existing\nmethods, Reward-Instruct does not rely on expensive yet tricky diffusion\ndistillation losses. Instead, it iteratively updates the few-step generator's\nparameters by directly sampling from a reward-tilted parameter distribution.\nSuch a training approach entirely bypasses the need for expensive diffusion\ndistillation losses, making it favorable to scale in high image resolutions.\nDespite its simplicity, Reward-Instruct yields surprisingly strong performance.\nOur extensive experiments on text-to-image generation have demonstrated that\nReward-Instruct achieves state-of-the-art results in visual quality and\nquantitative metrics compared to distillation-reliant methods, while also\nexhibiting greater robustness to the choice of reward function.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, numerous tasks have been proposed to encourage model to\ndevelop specified capability in understanding audio-visual scene, primarily\ncategorized into temporal localization, spatial localization, spatio-temporal\nreasoning, and pixel-level understanding. Instead, human possesses a unified\nunderstanding ability for diversified tasks. Therefore, designing an\naudio-visual model with general capability to unify these tasks is of great\nvalue. However, simply joint training for all tasks can lead to interference\ndue to the heterogeneity of audiovisual data and complex relationship among\ntasks. We argue that this problem can be solved through explicit cooperation\namong tasks. To achieve this goal, we propose a unified learning method which\nachieves explicit inter-task cooperation from both the perspectives of data and\nmodel thoroughly. Specifically, considering the labels of existing datasets are\nsimple words, we carefully refine these datasets and construct an Audio-Visual\nUnified Instruction-tuning dataset with Explicit reasoning process (AV-UIE),\nwhich clarifies the cooperative relationship among tasks. Subsequently, to\nfacilitate concrete cooperation in learning stage, an interaction-aware LoRA\nstructure with multiple LoRA heads is designed to learn different aspects of\naudiovisual data interaction. By unifying the explicit cooperation across the\ndata and model aspect, our method not only surpasses existing unified\naudio-visual model on multiple tasks, but also outperforms most specialized\nmodels for certain tasks. Furthermore, we also visualize the process of\nexplicit cooperation and surprisingly find that each LoRA head has certain\naudio-visual understanding ability.

However,\nclients' data originating from diverse domains may degrade model performance\ndue to domain shifts, preventing the model from learning consistent\nrepresentation space. In this paper, we propose a novel FL framework, Federated\nDomain Shift Eraser (FDSE), to improve model performance by differently erasing\neach client's domain skew and enhancing their consensus. First, we formulate\nthe model forward passing as an iterative deskewing process that extracts and\nthen deskews features alternatively. This is efficiently achieved by\ndecomposing each original layer in the neural network into a Domain-agnostic\nFeature Extractor (DFE) and a Domain-specific Skew Eraser (DSE). Then, a\nregularization term is applied to promise the effectiveness of feature\ndeskewing by pulling local statistics of DSE's outputs close to the globally\nconsistent ones. Finally, DFE modules are fairly aggregated and broadcast to\nall the clients to maximize their consensus, and DSE modules are personalized\nfor each client via similarity-aware aggregation to erase their domain skew\ndifferently.

To overcome\nthese limitations, we introduce MaskSDM, a novel deep learning-based SDM that\nenables flexible predictor selection by employing a masked training strategy.\nThis approach allows the model to make predictions with arbitrary subsets of\ninput variables while remaining robust to missing data. It also provides a\nclearer understanding of how adding or removing a given predictor affects model\nperformance and predictions. Additionally, MaskSDM leverages Shapley values for\nprecise predictor contribution assessments, improving upon traditional\napproximations. We evaluate MaskSDM on the global sPlotOpen dataset, modeling\nthe distributions of 12,738 plant species. Our results show that MaskSDM\noutperforms imputation-based methods and approximates models trained on\nspecific subsets of variables. These findings underscore MaskSDM's potential to\nincrease the applicability and adoption of SDMs, laying the groundwork for\ndeveloping foundation models in SDMs that can be readily applied to diverse\necological applications.",

We calibrate these parameters on a suite of fast approximate simulations\ngenerated by PINOCCHIO as well as full $N$-body simulations from OpenGADGET3.\nWe demonstrate that PINOCCHIO can reproduce the 2PCF covariance measured in\nOpenGADGET3 at the few percent level, provided the mass functions are carefully\nrescaled. Resolution tests confirm that high particle counts are necessary to\ncapture shot-noise corrections, especially at high redshifts. We perform the\nparameter calibration across multiple cosmological models, showing that one of\nthe nuisance parameters, the non-Poissonian shot-noise correction $\\alpha$,\ndepends mildly on the amplitude of matter fluctuations $\\sigma_8$. In contrast,\nthe remaining two parameters, $\\beta$ controlling the bias correction and\n$\\gamma$ controlling the secondary shot-noise correction, exhibit more\nsignificant variation with redshift and halo mass.

Scene\nrepresentation, as a key module in the pipeline, has traditionally relied on\nconventional perception, which focus on the global scene. However, in driving\nscenarios, human drivers typically focus only on regions that directly impact\ndriving, which often coincide with those required for end-to-end autonomous\ndriving. In this paper, a novel end-to-end autonomous driving method called\nInsightDrive is proposed, which organizes perception by language-guided scene\nrepresentation. We introduce an instance-centric scene tokenizer that\ntransforms the surrounding environment into map- and object-aware instance\ntokens. Scene attention language descriptions, which highlight key regions and\nobstacles affecting the ego vehicle's movement, are generated by a\nvision-language model that leverages the cognitive reasoning capabilities of\nfoundation models. We then align scene descriptions with visual features using\nthe vision-language model, guiding visual attention through these descriptions\nto give effectively scene representation. Furthermore, we employ self-attention\nand cross-attention mechanisms to model the ego-agents and ego-map\nrelationships to comprehensively build the topological relationships of the\nscene. Finally, based on scene understanding, we jointly perform motion\nprediction and planning.

    "abstract": "In the last 175 years, the physical understanding of\n  nature has seen a revolutionary change. Until about 1850, Newton's\n  theory and the mechanical world view derived from it provided the\n  dominant view of the physical world, later supplemented by Maxwell's\n  theory of the electromagnetic field. That approach was entirely\n  deterministic and free of probabilistic concepts. In contrast to\n  that conceptual edifice, today many fields of physics are governed\n  by probabilistic concepts. Statistical mechanics in its classical or\n  quantum version and random-matrix theory are obvious\n  examples. Quantum mechanics is an intrinsically statistical\n  theory. Classical chaos and its quantum manifestations also require\n  a stochastic approach. The paper describes how a combination of\n  discoveries and conceptual problems undermined the mechanical world\n  view, led to novel concepts, and shaped the modern understanding of\n  physics.",

In this work, we propose WMINet a wheel-mounted\ninertial deep learning approach to estimate the mobile robot's position based\nonly on its inertial sensors. To that end, we merge two common practical\nmethods to reduce inertial drift: a wheel-mounted approach and driving the\nmobile robot in periodic trajectories.

To evaluate our proposed\napproach we recorded using the Rosbot-XL a wheel-mounted initial dataset\ntotaling 190 minutes, which is made publicly available.

In this study, we investigate the internal\nkinematics of the LMC by deriving precise stellar proper motions using data\nfrom the VISTA survey of the Magellanic Clouds system (VMC). The main objective\nis to refine the LMC's dynamical parameters using improved proper motion\nmeasurements, including one additional epoch of VISTA observations, which\nextended the time baseline from ~ 2 to 10 years. The precision of the proper\nmotion was enhanced, reducing uncertainties from 6 mas/yr to 1.5 mas/yr. We\nderived geometrical and kinematic parameters, generating velocity maps and\nrotation curves, for both young and old stellar populations. Finally, we\ncompared a suite of dynamical models, which simulate the interaction of the LMC\nwith the Milky Way and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), against the observations.\nThe tangential rotation curve reveals an asymmetric drift between young and old\nstars, while the radial velocity curve for the young population shows an\nincreasing trend within the inner bar region, suggesting non-circular orbits.\nWe confirm the clockwise rotation around the dynamical centre of the LMC,\nconsistent with previous predictions. A significant residual motion was\ndetected toward the north-east of the LMC, directed away from the centre. This\nfeature observed in the inner disk region is kinematically connected with a\nsubstructure identified in the periphery known as Eastern Substructure 1.

This paraelectric-metaparaelectric transition leads to a\npolarization saturation at large electric field. The corresponding P-E loop\ndisplays a giant energy density of 308 J/cm$^3$ with high efficiency nearly\n100%.

    "abstract": "The remarkable performance of large multimodal models (LMMs) has attracted\nsignificant interest from the image segmentation community. To align with the\nnext-token-prediction paradigm, current LMM-driven segmentation methods either\nuse object boundary points to represent masks or introduce special segmentation\ntokens, whose hidden states are decoded by a segmentation model requiring the\noriginal image as input. However, these approaches often suffer from inadequate\nmask representation and complex architectures, limiting the potential of LMMs.\nIn this work, we propose the Hierarchical Mask Tokenizer (HiMTok), which\nrepresents segmentation masks with up to 32 tokens and eliminates the need for\nthe original image during mask de-tokenization. HiMTok allows for compact and\ncoarse-to-fine mask representations, aligning well with the LLM\nnext-token-prediction paradigm and facilitating the direct acquisition of\nsegmentation capabilities. We develop a 3-stage training recipe for progressive\nlearning of segmentation and visual capabilities, featuring a hierarchical mask\nloss for effective coarse-to-fine learning. Additionally, we enable\nbidirectional information flow, allowing conversion between bounding boxes and\nmask tokens to fully leverage multi-task training potential.

However, a long-standing and as yet unresolved problem of modern\nastrophysics concerns the identity of their progenitor. We aim to use GCE\npredictions to help constrain potential SN Ia progenitor scenarios, since it is\nwell known that SN Ia nucleosynthesis yields, in particular the Fe-peak\nelements, depend on the explosion mechanism. We calculated 1140 GCE models and\ncompared the GCE-predicted abundance ratios for four different SN Ia explosion\nmechanisms -- two from sub-Chandrasekhar (MCh) mass progenitors and two from\nnear-MCh mass progenitors -- to spectroscopic measurements of Milky Way disk\nstars, considering both local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) and non-LTE\n(NLTE) assumptions. We calibrated the GCE framework for two sets of massive\nstar yields in order to assess how stellar modelling uncertainties affect the\nrelative contribution from core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) towards Si, Ca, and\nthe Fe-peak elements. From a GCE perspective, Si and Ca cannot be used to\nconstrain SN Ia progenitors since there is little variation in their yields\nbetween different explosion types. The GCE of [Ti/Fe] and [Co/Fe] are not\nreproduced by any combination of yields. The [Cr/Fe] ratio is also problematic,\nsince hardly any NLTE data of the disk are available and there are conflicting\nyields from CCSNe. For [Mn/Fe], neither CCSN yield set are compatible with the\nNLTE data. For [Ni/Fe], the NLTE data are well fit by one set of CCSN yields,\nwith the best-fitting GCE models having a $\\sim85\\%$ contribution from sub-MCh\nSNe Ia. We advise caution when using GCE models to constrain the Galaxy's SN Ia\npopulation, since the results depend on both the choice of CCSN yields and the\nelemental ratio used as a diagnostic.",

    "abstract": "Multi-object tracking (MOT) is one of the most important problems in computer\nvision and a key component of any vision-based perception system used in\nadvanced autonomous mobile robotics. Therefore, its implementation on low-power\nand real-time embedded platforms is highly desirable. Modern MOT algorithms\nshould be able to track objects of a given class (e.g. people or vehicles). In\naddition, the number of objects to be tracked is not known in advance, and they\nmay appear and disappear at any time, as well as be obscured. For these\nreasons, the most popular and successful approaches have recently been based on\nthe tracking paradigm. Therefore, the presence of a high quality object\ndetector is essential, which in practice accounts for the vast majority of the\ncomputational and memory complexity of the whole MOT system. In this paper, we\npropose an FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) implementation of an embedded\nMOT system based on a quantized YOLOv8 detector and the SORT (Simple Online\nRealtime Tracker) tracker. We use a modified version of the FINN framework to\nutilize external memory for model parameters and to support operations\nnecessary required by YOLOv8. We discuss the evaluation of detection and\ntracking performance using the COCO and MOT15 datasets, where we achieve 0.21\nmAP and 38.9 MOTA respectively. As the computational platform, we use an MPSoC\nsystem (Zynq UltraScale+ device from AMD/Xilinx) where the detector is deployed\nin reprogrammable logic and the tracking algorithm is implemented in the\nprocessor system.",

Same as in Paper I~\\cite{HH24} we consider a\nsystem of $N$ harmonic oscillators, modeling the internal degrees of freedom\n(idf) of $N$ neutral atoms interacting with a scalar quantum field altered by\nthe presence of a dielectric medium. Different from Paper I, which uses the\ngraded influence action formalism, here, taking advantage of the Gaussian\nnature of our extended system's interactions, we use the quantum Langevin\nequation method to calculate the time evolution of the covariance matrix\nelements of the quantum correlation functions of the idfs of the $N$\nsystem-atoms in a dielectric-altered quantum field. The covariance matrix is\nparticularly useful for extracting quantum informational properties of a\nGaussian system related to quantum correlations, such as quantum entanglement.\nAs an illustration of the method we calculate the entanglement between one\nsystem atom and the ambient quantum field outside the dielectric half-space,\nmeasured by the purity function and the von Neumann entropy. We highlight one\nsomewhat peculiar feature in our results and one important technical issue: The\nspecial feature refers to the non-monotonic behavior of the purity function\nwhen the atom is positioned very close to the dielectric surface. By deriving\nthe Robertson-Schr\\\"odinger function and displaying a similar qualitative\nbehavior under these conditions we attribute this novelty to a manifestation of\nthe uncertainty relation. The technical issue refers to the order-reduction\nscheme to remove the third time derivative term in the Langevin equation for\nthe idfs of the atom. We point out the inconsistencies in the traditional\ntreatments and propose a new consistent scheme of order reduction for Gaussian\nopen systems.",

Past research has suggested that\nwhereas CLIP effectively matches text to images when the matching can be\nachieved just by matching the text with the objects in the image, CLIP\nstruggles when the matching depends on representing the relationship among the\nobjects in the images (i.e., inferring relations). Previous attempts to address\nthis limitation by training CLIP on relation detection datasets with only\nlinguistic supervision have met with limited success. In this paper, we offer\ninsights and practical methods to advance the field of relation inference from\nimages. This paper approaches the task of creating a model that effectively\ndetects relations among the objects in images by producing text and image\nembeddings that capture relationships through linguistic supervision. To this\nend, we propose Dynamic Relation Inference via Verb Embeddings (DRIVE), which\naugments the COCO dataset, fine-tunes CLIP with hard negatives\nsubject-relation-object triples and corresponding images, and introduces a\nnovel loss function to improve relation detection. Evaluated on multiple\nCLIP-based models, our method significantly improves zero-shot relation\ninference accuracy in both frozen and fine-tuned settings, significantly\noutperforming CLIP and state-of-the-art models while generalizing well on\nunseen data.",

    "abstract": "Due to limitations such as geographic, physical, or economic factors,\ncollected seismic data often have missing traces. Traditional seismic data\nreconstruction methods face the challenge of selecting numerous empirical\nparameters and struggle to handle large-scale continuous missing traces. With\nthe advancement of deep learning, various diffusion models have demonstrated\nstrong reconstruction capabilities. However, these UNet-based diffusion models\nrequire significant computational resources and struggle to learn the\ncorrelation between different traces in seismic data. To address the complex\nand irregular missing situations in seismic data, we propose a latent diffusion\ntransformer utilizing representation learning for seismic data reconstruction.\nBy employing a mask modeling scheme based on representation learning, the\nrepresentation module uses the token sequence of known data to infer the token\nsequence of unknown data, enabling the reconstructed data from the diffusion\nmodel to have a more consistent data distribution and better correlation and\naccuracy with the known data. We propose the Representation Diffusion\nTransformer architecture, and a relative positional bias is added when\ncalculating attention, enabling the diffusion model to achieve global modeling\ncapability for seismic data. Using a pre-trained data compression model\ncompresses the training and inference processes of the diffusion model into a\nlatent space, which, compared to other diffusion model-based reconstruction\nmethods, reduces computational and inference costs. Reconstruction experiments\non field and synthetic datasets indicate that our method achieves higher\nreconstruction accuracy than existing methods and can handle various complex\nmissing scenarios.",

In this paper, we\npresent an average-atom approach for the calculation of direct-current electric\nconductivity within Ziman's theory.

    "abstract": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in\nvarious multi-modal tasks. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in\nimproving the personalization capabilities of VLMs. To better integrate\nuser-provided concepts into VLMs, many methods use positive and negative\nsamples to fine-tune these models. However, the scarcity of user-provided\npositive samples and the low quality of retrieved negative samples pose\nchallenges for fine-tuning. To reveal the relationship between sample and model\nperformance, we systematically investigate the impact of positive and negative\nsamples (easy and hard) and their diversity on VLM personalization tasks. Based\non the detailed analysis, we introduce Concept-as-Tree (CaT), which represents\na concept as a tree structure, thereby enabling the data generation of positive\nand negative samples with varying difficulty and diversity for VLM\npersonalization. With a well-designed data filtering strategy, our CaT\nframework can ensure the quality of generated data, constituting a powerful\npipeline. We perform thorough experiments with various VLM personalization\nbaselines to assess the effectiveness of the pipeline, alleviating the lack of\npositive samples and the low quality of negative samples. Our results\ndemonstrate that CaT equipped with the proposed data filter significantly\nenhances the personalization capabilities of VLMs across the MyVLM, Yo'LLaVA,\nand MC-LLaVA datasets. To our knowledge, this work is the first controllable\nsynthetic data pipeline for VLM personalization.

This topic has received a lot of attention\nin the distributed computing setting, and we introduce it here in the context\nof \\emph{streaming} algorithms, where the input is too large to be stored in\nmemory.\n  Given a graph property $\\mbox{P}$, a \\emph{streaming certification scheme}\nfor $\\mbox{P}$ is a \\emph{prover-verifier} pair where the prover is a\ncomputationally unlimited but non-trustable oracle, and the verifier is a\nstreaming algorithm. For any input graph, the prover provides the verifier with\na \\emph{certificate}. The verifier then receives the input graph as a stream of\nedges in an adversarial order, and must check whether the certificate is indeed\na \\emph{proof} that the input graph satisfies $\\mbox{P}$. The main complexity\nmeasure for a streaming certification scheme is its \\emph{space complexity},\ndefined as the sum of the size of the certificate provided by the oracle, and\nof the memory space required by the verifier.\n  We give streaming certification schemes for several graph properties,\nincluding maximum matching, diameter, degeneracy, and coloring, with space\ncomplexity matching the requirement of \\emph{semi-streaming}, i.e., with space\ncomplexity $O(n\\,\\mbox{polylog}\\, n)$ for $n$-node graphs. All these problems\ndo {\\em not} admit semi-streaming algorithms, showing that also in the (semi)\nstreaming setting, certification is sometimes easier than calculation (like\n$NP$). For each of these properties, we provide upper and lower bounds on the\nspace complexity of the corresponding certification schemes, many being tight\nup to logarithmic multiplicative factors. We also show that some graph\nproperties are hard for streaming certification, in the sense that they cannot\nbe certified in semi-streaming, as they require $\\Omega(n^2)$-bit certificates.",

Various methods\nhave been proposed to automate this task in the past decade. Most of them rely\non the exchanged content, but ignore the structure and dynamics of the\nconversation, which could provide some relevant information. In this article,\nwe propose to use representation learning methods to automatically produce\nembeddings of this textual content and of the conversational graphs depicting\nmessage exchanges. While the latter could be enhanced by including additional\ninformation on top of the raw conversational structure, no method currently\nexists to learn whole-graph representations using simultaneously edge\ndirections, weights, signs, and vertex attributes. We propose two such methods\nto fill this gap in the literature. We experiment with 5 textual and 13 graph\nembedding methods, and apply them to a dataset of online messages annotated for\nabuse detection. Our best results achieve an F -measure of 81.02 using text\nalone and 80.61 using graphs alone. We also combine both modalities of\ninformation (text and graphs) through three fusion strategies, and show that\nthis strongly improves abuse detection performance, increasing the F -measure\nto 87.06. Finally, we identify which specific engineered features are captured\nby the embedding methods under consideration. These features have clear\ninterpretations and help explain what information the representation learning\nmethods deem discriminative.",

To\nfurther facilitate this process, efforts have been made to combine it with\nLearning from Demonstrations (LfD) for more flexible and efficient policy\ntransfer. However, these approaches are almost exclusively limited to offline\ndemonstrations collected before policy transfer starts, which may suffer from\nthe intrinsic issue of covariance shift brought by LfD and harm the performance\nof policy transfer. Meanwhile, extensive work in the learning-from-scratch\nsetting has shown that online demonstrations can effectively alleviate\ncovariance shift and lead to better policy performance with improved sample\nefficiency. This work combines these insights to introduce online\ndemonstrations into a policy transfer setting. We present Policy Transfer with\nOnline Demonstrations, an active LfD algorithm for policy transfer that can\noptimize the timing and content of queries for online episodic expert\ndemonstrations under a limited demonstration budget. We evaluate our method in\neight robotic scenarios, involving policy transfer across diverse environment\ncharacteristics, task objectives, and robotic embodiments, with the aim to\ntransfer a trained policy from a source task to a related but different target\ntask. The results show that our method significantly outperforms all baselines\nin terms of average success rate and sample efficiency, compared to two\ncanonical LfD methods with offline demonstrations and one active LfD method\nwith online demonstrations.

    "abstract": "Researchers, policy makers, and engineers need to make sense of data on\nspreading processes as diverse as viral infections, water contamination, and\nmisinformation in social networks. Classical questions include predicting\ninfection behavior in a given network or deducing the structure of a network\nfrom infection data. We study two central problems in this area. In graph\ndiscovery, we aim to fully reconstruct the structure of a graph from infection\ndata. In source detection, we observe a limited subset of the infections and\naim to deduce the source of the infection chain. These questions have received\nconsiderable attention and have been analyzed in many settings (e.g., under\ndifferent models of spreading processes), yet all previous work shares the\nassumption that the network has the same structure at every point in time. For\nexample, if we consider how a disease spreads, it is unrealistic to assume that\ntwo people can either never or always infect each other, rather such an\ninfection is possible precisely when they meet. Temporal graphs, in which\nconnections change over time, have recently been used as a more realistic graph\nmodel to study infections. Despite this recent attention, we are the first to\nstudy graph discovery or source detection in temporal graphs.\n  We propose models for temporal graph discovery and source detection that are\nconsistent with previous work on static graphs and extend it to embrace the\nstronger expressiveness of temporal graphs. For this, we employ the standard\nsusceptible-infected-resistant model of spreading processes, which is\nparticularly often used to study diseases.

    "abstract": "Neutrinos, being elusive subatomic particles having only weak interactions,\nprovide an ideal platform to look for physics beyond the Standard Model. In the\npresent era of neutrino physics, various experiments are focusing towards the\nprecision measurements of the oscillation parameters. Hence, various new\nphysics scenarios which can affect the neutrino oscillation probabilities in\nmatter, be in need of careful investigation. There is a slight tension at the\nlevel of $2 \\sigma$ between the recently reported results on the CP violating\nphase $\\delta_{CP}$ by NOvA and T2K experiments, which can be attributed to the\nrole of non-standard interactions (NSIs) in the propagation of neutrinos\nthrough matter. Another interesting possibility is that though neutrinos are\nelectrically neutral, they can possess electromagnetic properties such as\nelectric and magnetic dipole moments in the presence of new physics, and the\nneutrino oscillation experiments can put limits on them. In this work, we will\nfocus on these two aspects and show how they can be used to probe the nature of\nnew physics from model-building perspectives.",

However, this\neffect is restricted to materials that lack inversion symmetry. In contrast,\nthe flexoelectric effect couples strain gradients to electric polarization, and\nis a universal property in insulating materials of arbitrary symmetry.\nFlexoelectricity becomes prominent at the nanoscale from the inverse scaling of\nstrain gradients with material dimensions. Here, we measure the\nstrain-gradient-induced structural distortions in strontium titanate using\nmultislice electron ptychography. This technique enables reliable\npicometer-scale measurements of the dominant oxygen-titanium distortions,\ncorrecting for artifacts that limited conventional imaging methods. This\nenables us to directly measure the sign of the net ionic contribution to the\nflexoelectric polarization. Guided by the experimental measurements,\nfirst-principles calculations show how the sign and magnitude of the bulk\ncontribution to the flexoelectric coefficient in strontium titanate can be\nswitched by tuning the strain state. Hybridization between the optical soft\nphonon and acoustic phonon modes drives this transition, yielding a large\nresponse and a polarity switch across the resonance. This strain-dependence\nmight explain the sign discrepancy and orders of magnitude variation in the\nvalues of previously reported flexoelectric coefficients for strontium\ntitanate.

We introduce the SISSI (Supernovae In a Stratified, Shearing\nInterstellar medium) simulation suite, which aims to enable a more\ncomprehensive understanding of supernova remnants (SNRs) evolving in a complex\ninterstellar medium (ISM) structured under the influence of galactic rotation,\ngravity and turbulence. Methods. We utilize zoom-in simulations of 30 SNRs\nexpanding in the ISM of a simulated isolated disk galaxy. The ISM of the galaxy\nis resolved down to a maximum resolution of $\\sim 12\\,\\text{pc}$, while we\nachieve a zoomed-in resolution of $\\sim 0.18\\, \\text{pc}$ in the vicinity of\nthe explosion sources. We compute the time-evolution of the SNRs' geometry and\ncompare it to the observed geometry of the Local Bubble. Results. During the\nearly stages of evolution, SNRs are well described by existing analytical\nmodels. On longer timescales, starting at about a percent of the orbital\ntimescale, they depart from spherical symmetry and become increasingly prolate\nor oblate. The timescale for the departure from spherical symmetry is shorter\nthan the expectation from a simple model for the deformation by galactic shear,\nsuggesting that galactic shear alone cannot explain these differences. Yet, the\nalignment of the minor- and major axis of the SNRs is in line with expectations\nfrom said model, indicating that the deformation might have a shear-related\norigin. A comparison with the geometry of the Local Bubble reveals that it\nmight be slightly younger than previously believed, but otherwise has a\nstandard morphology for a SNR of its age and size. Conclusions. Studying the\ngeometry of SNRs can reveal valuable insights about the complex interactions\nshaping their dynamical evolution.

By deliberately controlling the thickness of the LNO sublayers thus\nthe amount of charge transfer, a robust ferromagnetism of 4 uB is realized for\na stacking periodicity consisting of one single unit cell of both LNO and LFO,\nan emergent double perovskite phase of La2FeNiO6 with B-site layered ordering\nconfigurations. The ferromagnetic LFO/LNO superlattices offer great potential\nfor the search of emergent magnetodielectric and/or multiferroic properties as\nwell as applications in spintronics and electrocatalysts.",

Conventional model-based trackers\ntypically rely on random vector-based Bayesian filters within the\ntracking-by-detection (TBD) framework but face limitations due to heuristic\ndata association and track management schemes. In contrast, random finite set\n(RFS)-based Bayesian filtering handles object birth, survival, and death in a\ntheoretically sound manner, facilitating interpretability and parameter tuning.\nIn this paper, we present OptiPMB, a novel RFS-based 3D MOT method that employs\nan optimized Poisson multi-Bernoulli (PMB) filter while incorporating several\nkey innovative designs within the TBD framework. Specifically, we propose a\nmeasurement-driven hybrid adaptive birth model for improved track\ninitialization, employ adaptive detection probability parameters to effectively\nmaintain tracks for occluded objects, and optimize density pruning and track\nextraction modules to further enhance overall tracking performance. Extensive\nevaluations on nuScenes and KITTI datasets show that OptiPMB achieves superior\ntracking accuracy compared with state-of-the-art methods, thereby establishing\na new benchmark for model-based 3D MOT and offering valuable insights for\nfuture research on RFS-based trackers in autonomous driving.",

    "abstract": "We propose a new task to benchmark human-in-scene understanding for embodied\nagents: Human-In-Scene Question Answering (HIS-QA). Given a human motion within\na 3D scene, HIS-QA requires the agent to comprehend human states and behaviors,\nreason about its surrounding environment, and answer human-related questions\nwithin the scene. To support this new task, we present HIS-Bench, a multimodal\nbenchmark that systematically evaluates HIS understanding across a broad\nspectrum, from basic perception to commonsense reasoning and planning. Our\nevaluation of various vision-language models on HIS-Bench reveals significant\nlimitations in their ability to handle HIS-QA tasks. To this end, we propose\nHIS-GPT, the first foundation model for HIS understanding. HIS-GPT integrates\n3D scene context and human motion dynamics into large language models while\nincorporating specialized mechanisms to capture human-scene interactions.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that HIS-GPT sets a new state-of-the-art on\nHIS-QA tasks.

    "abstract": "Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is widely used in fields\nranging from chemistry, material science to neuroscience. Nanoscale NMR\nspectroscopy using Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond has emerged as a\npromising platform due to an unprecedented sensitivity down to the single spin\nlevel. At the nanoscale, high nuclear spin polarization through spin\nfluctuations (statistical polarization) far outweighs thermal polarization.\nHowever, until now efficient NMR detection using coherent averaging techniques\ncould not be applied to the detection of statistical polarization, leading to\nlong measurement times. Here we present two protocols to enable coherent\naveraging of statistical oscillating signals through rectification. We\ndemonstrate these protocols on an artificial radiofrequency signal detected\nwith a single NV center at 2.7 T. Through this, the signal-to-noise scaling\nwith number of measurements $N$ is improved from $N^{0.5}$ to $N^1$, improving\nthe measurement time significantly. The relevance of rectification for the\ndetection of statistical polarization using NV ensembles is outlined, paving\nthe way for efficient nanoscale NMR spectroscopy.",

    "abstract": "Text-video prediction (TVP) is a downstream video generation task that\nrequires a model to produce subsequent video frames given a series of initial\nvideo frames and text describing the required motion. In practice TVP methods\nfocus on a particular category of videos depicting manipulations of objects\ncarried out by human beings or robot arms. Previous methods adapt models\npre-trained on text-to-image tasks, and thus tend to generate video that lacks\nthe required continuity. A natural progression would be to leverage more recent\npre-trained text-to-video (T2V) models. This approach is rendered more\nchallenging by the fact that the most common fine-tuning technique, low-rank\nadaptation (LoRA), yields undesirable results. In this work, we propose an\nadaptation-based strategy we label Frame-wise Conditioning Adaptation (FCA).\nWithin the module, we devise a sub-module that produces frame-wise text\nembeddings from the input text, which acts as an additional text condition to\naid generation. We use FCA to fine-tune the T2V model, which incorporates the\ninitial frame(s) as an extra condition. We compare and discuss the more\neffective strategy for injecting such embeddings into the T2V model. We conduct\nextensive ablation studies on our design choices with quantitative and\nqualitative performance analysis. Our approach establishes a new\nstate-of-the-art for the task of TVP.

New dust cools quickly and is\ntherefore detectable at mid-infrared (mid-IR) wavelengths. However, before the\nera of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), direct observational evidence for\ndust condensation was found in only a handful of nearby CCSNe, and dust masses\n(~10$^{-2}-10^{-3} M_{\\odot}$, generally limited to <5 yr and to >500K\ntemperatures) have been 2-3 orders of magnitude smaller than either theoretical\npredictions or dust amounts found by far-IR/submm observations of Galactic SN\nremnants and in the very nearby SN 1987A. The combined angular resolution and\nmid-IR sensitivity of JWST finally allow us to reveal hidden cool (~100-200K)\ndust reservoirs in extragalactic SNe beyond SN 1987A. Our team received\nJWST/MIRI time for studying a larger sample of CCSNe to fill the currently\nexisting gap in their dust formation histories. The first observed target of\nthis program is the well-known Type IIb SN~1993J appeared in M81. We generated\nits spectral energy distribution (SED) from the current JWST/MIRI F770W,\nF1000W, F1500W, and F2100W fluxes. We fit single- and two-component silicate\nand carbonaceous dust models to the SED. We found that SN 1993J still contains\na significant amount (~0.01 $M_{\\odot}$) of dust ~30 yr after explosion.\nComparing these results to those of the analysis of earlier {Spitzer Space\nTelescope data, we see a similar amount of dust now that was detected ~15-20 yr\nago, but at a lower temperature. We also find residual background emission near\nthe SN site (after point-spread-function subtraction on the JWST/MIRI images)\nthat may plausibly be attributed to an IR echo from more distant interstellar\ndust grains heated by the SN shock-breakout luminosity or ongoing star\nformation in the local environment.",

This study presents an experimentally\nvalidated energy balance with thermodynamic phenomenon mathematically modelled\nfor synthesising consistent geopolymer activator solutions. The model's general\napplicability enables dynamic assessments of user-specified systems, offering\nstability metrics for quality control in laboratory and industrial settings.\nFundamentally, the mathematical model can be used towards batching optimisation\nunder user-defined conditions where dissolution of geopolymer precursors can be\nmaximised via solution preparation and batching optimisation. The model results\nquantify experimentally validated temperature dynamics, thermodynamic\nstability, and process design/batching optimisation, challenging traditional\npractices in the literature that rely on undefined equilibration periods. Key\nfindings demonstrate that stable, ready-to-use activator solutions can be\nachieved in as little as 1 minute, compared to the typically used 24-hour\nbatching periods. This research paves the way towards standardised activator\nsolution preparation and supports the development of Standard Operating\nProcedures (SOPs) for geopolymer synthesis, promoting consistency and\nscalability in geopolymer technology.",

In this paper, we propose a generic and\ncomputationally efficient framework that can adapt a standard unconstrained RL\nmethod to ACRL through two modifications: (i) To enforce the action\nconstraints, we leverage the classic acceptance-rejection method, where we\ntreat the unconstrained policy as the proposal distribution and derive a\nmodified policy with feasible actions. (ii) To improve the acceptance rate of\nthe proposal distribution, we construct an augmented two-objective Markov\ndecision process (MDP), which include additional self-loop state transitions\nand a penalty signal for the rejected actions. This augmented MDP incentives\nthe learned policy to stay close to the feasible action sets. Through extensive\nexperiments in both robot control and resource allocation domains, we\ndemonstrate that the proposed framework enjoys faster training progress, better\nconstraint satisfaction, and a lower action inference time simultaneously than\nthe state-of-the-art ACRL methods.

Concurrently, at high metallicities, for $z < 2$, while massive\ngalaxies in nodes show increasing $Z_{g}$ and decreasing [O/Fe], void galaxies\nshow a turnover where $Z_{g}$ falls with decreasing [O/Fe]. This directly\npoints to the importance of cold-gas accretion in retaining lower $Z_{g}$ in\nmassive void galaxies for $z < 2$, whilst its absence in nodes allowed $Z_{g}$\nto access higher values.",

Traditional diagnostic methods rely on\nsubjective evaluations that are time-consuming and inconsistent. To address\nthese challenges, we introduce MMLNB, a multi-modal learning (MML) model that\nintegrates pathological images with generated textual descriptions to improve\nclassification accuracy and interpretability. The approach follows a two-stage\nprocess. First, we fine-tune a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to enhance\npathology-aware text generation. Second, the fine-tuned VLM generates textual\ndescriptions, using a dual-branch architecture to independently extract visual\nand textual features. These features are fused via Progressive Robust\nMulti-Modal Fusion (PRMF) Block for stable training. Experimental results show\nthat the MMLNB model is more accurate than the single modal model. Ablation\nstudies demonstrate the importance of multi-modal fusion, fine-tuning, and the\nPRMF mechanism. This research creates a scalable AI-driven framework for\ndigital pathology, enhancing reliability and interpretability in NB subtyping\nclassification.

    "abstract": "Speculative decoding (SD) has emerged as a method to accelerate LLM inference\nwithout sacrificing any accuracy over the 16-bit model inference. In a typical\nSD setup, the idea is to use a full-precision, small, fast model as \"draft\" to\ngenerate the next few tokens and use the \"target\" large model to verify the\ndraft-generated tokens. The efficacy of this method heavily relies on the\nacceptance ratio of the draft-generated tokens and the relative token\nthroughput of the draft versus the target model. Nevertheless, an efficient SD\npipeline requires pre-training and aligning the draft model to the target\nmodel, making it impractical for LLM inference in a plug-and-play fashion. In\nthis work, we propose using MXFP4 models as drafts in a plug-and-play fashion\nsince the MXFP4 Weight-Only-Quantization (WOQ) merely direct-casts the BF16\ntarget model weights to MXFP4. In practice, our plug-and-play solution gives\nspeedups up to 2x over the BF16 baseline. Then we pursue an opportunity for\nfurther acceleration: the MXFP4 draft token generation itself can be\naccelerated via speculative decoding by using yet another smaller draft. We\ncall our method ML-SpecQD: Multi-Level Speculative Decoding with Quantized\nDrafts since it recursively applies speculation for accelerating the\ndraft-token generation. Combining Multi-Level Speculative Decoding with MXFP4\nQuantized Drafts we outperform state-of-the-art speculative decoding, yielding\nspeedups up to 2.72x over the BF16 baseline.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of large multimodal models (LMMs), multimodal\nunderstanding applications are emerging. As most LMM inference requests\noriginate from edge devices with limited computational capabilities, the\npredominant inference pipeline involves directly forwarding the input data to\nan edge server which handles all computations. However, this approach\nintroduces high transmission latency due to limited uplink bandwidth of edge\ndevices and significant computation latency caused by the prohibitive number of\nvisual tokens, thus hindering delay-sensitive tasks and degrading user\nexperience. To address this challenge, we propose a task-oriented feature\ncompression (TOFC) method for multimodal understanding in a device-edge\nco-inference framework, where visual features are merged by clustering and\nencoded by a learnable and selective entropy model before feature projection.\nSpecifically, we employ density peaks clustering based on K nearest neighbors\nto reduce the number of visual features, thereby minimizing both data\ntransmission and computational complexity. Subsequently, a learnable entropy\nmodel with hyperprior is utilized to encode and decode merged features, further\nreducing transmission overhead. To enhance compression efficiency, multiple\nentropy models are adaptively selected based on the characteristics of the\nvisual features, enabling a more accurate estimation of the probability\ndistribution. Comprehensive experiments on seven visual question answering\nbenchmarks validate the effectiveness of the proposed TOFC method. Results show\nthat TOFC achieves up to 52% reduction in data transmission overhead and 63%\nreduction in system latency while maintaining identical task performance,\ncompared with neural compression ELIC.",

    "abstract": "Unconventional charge and spin density-wave states are commonly observed in\nbilayer nickelates, drawing considerable attention due to their proximity to\nhigh-$T_c$ superconductivity in various phase diagrams. However, the nature and\nmechanisms of charge and spin density-waves (DWs) in nickelates remain poorly\nunderstood. Numerous experiments have reported that the charge-density-wave\n(CDW) transition temperature $T_{ cdw}$ and the spin-density-wave (SDW)\ntransition temperature $T_{sdw}$ are closely related but distinct. However, in\ncontrast to these experiments, previous mean-field-type analyses have yielded\nonly a simple SDW phase. To resolve this key problem, this paper demonstrates\nthat sizable CDW instabilities emerge in proportion to the SDW instability in\nLa$3$Ni$2$O$7$.This behavior is driven by the paramagnon-interference (PMI)\nmechanism, which captures important electron correlations beyond mean-field\ntheory. Therefore, (i) experimental CDW + SDW coexisting state is naturally\nexplained. In addition, (ii) the CDW + SDW fluctuations cooperatively drive\nhigh-$T_c$ superconductivity. Notably, the predicted $s$-wave SC state is\nrobust against the inner apical O vacancies. Furthermore, (iii) the CDW\ninstability is highly sensitive to the size of the $d_{z^2}$-orbital hole\npocket, allowing for the realization of CDW quantum criticality through\ncarrier-doping and pressure application. We find that the coexistence of charge\nand spin fluctuations is essential in bilayer nickelates, with both playing a\ncooperative role in mediating high-$T_c$ superconductivity.",

A key\ndifficulty lies in effectively preventing catastrophic forgetting and\nfacilitating knowledge transfer while maintaining reliable decision-making\nperformance across subsequent tasks in dynamic environments. To tackle this, we\npropose a novel framework, SDW (Similarity-Driven Weighting Framework), which\nleverages large-language-model-generated dynamic functions to precisely control\nthe training process. The core of SDW lies in two functions pre-generated by\nlarge models: the task similarity function and the weight computation function.\nThe task similarity function extracts multidimensional features from task\ndescriptions to quantify the similarities and differences between tasks in\nterms of states, actions, and rewards. The weight computation function\ndynamically generates critical training parameters based on the similarity\ninformation, including the proportion of old task data stored in the Replay\nBuffer and the strategy consistency weight in the loss function, enabling an\nadaptive balance between learning new tasks and transferring knowledge from\nprevious tasks. By generating function code offline prior to training, rather\nthan relying on large-model inference during the training process, the SDW\nframework reduces computational overhead while maintaining efficiency in\nsequential task scenarios. Experimental results on Atari and MiniHack\nsequential tasks demonstrate that SDW significantly outperforms existing\nlifelong reinforcement learning methods.",

Additionally, the\nconvergence rate of the algorithm under different parameters is established\nusing a utility function.

However, the inherent heterogeneity between these modalities,\nincluding unbalanced convergence and modal misalignment, poses significant\nchallenges. Meanwhile, the large size of the detection-oriented feature also\nconstrains existing fusion strategies to capture long-range dependencies for\nthe 3D detection tasks. In this work, we introduce a fast yet effective\nmultimodal 3D object detector, incorporating our proposed Instance-level\nContrastive Distillation (ICD) framework and Cross Linear Attention Fusion\nModule (CLFM). ICD aligns instance-level image features with LiDAR\nrepresentations through object-aware contrastive distillation, ensuring\nfine-grained cross-modal consistency. Meanwhile, CLFM presents an efficient and\nscalable fusion strategy that enhances cross-modal global interactions within\nsizable multimodal BEV features. Extensive experiments on the KITTI and\nnuScenes 3D object detection benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nmethods. Notably, our 3D object detector outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nmethods while achieving superior efficiency.

However,\nexisting computational models often fail to achieve satisfactory performance.\nPsychological research has shown a strong correlation between pose and\npersonality traits, yet previous research has largely ignored pose data in\ncomputational models. To address this gap, we develop a novel multimodal\ndataset that incorporates full-body pose data. The dataset includes video\nrecordings of 287 participants completing a virtual interview with 36\nquestions, along with self-reported Big Five personality scores as labels. To\neffectively utilize this multimodal data, we introduce the Psychology-Inspired\nNetwork (PINet), which consists of three key modules: Multimodal Feature\nAwareness (MFA), Multimodal Feature Interaction (MFI), and Psychology-Informed\nModality Correlation Loss (PIMC Loss). The MFA module leverages the Vision\nMamba Block to capture comprehensive visual features related to personality,\nwhile the MFI module efficiently fuses the multimodal features. The PIMC Loss,\ngrounded in psychological theory, guides the model to emphasize different\nmodalities for different personality dimensions. Experimental results show that\nthe PINet outperforms several state-of-the-art baseline models. Furthermore,\nthe three modules of PINet contribute almost equally to the model's overall\nperformance. Incorporating pose data significantly enhances the model's\nperformance, with the pose modality ranking mid-level in importance among the\nfive modalities. These findings address the existing gap in personality-related\ndatasets that lack full-body pose data and provide a new approach for improving\nthe accuracy of personality prediction models, highlighting the importance of\nintegrating psychological insights into AI frameworks.",

The equations of motion can be derived and show in\nparticular that in the polar coordinate, the orbits can be restricted to the\nplane for an aligned spin with the orbital motion, but there is an induced\nmotion out of the plane for a misaligned spin. The radial potential can be\ndefined from the equation of motion along the radial direction, where the roots\nare studied to construct the parameter space diagram for different types of\norbits. We then consider the so-called innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO)\ndue to the triple root to see the effects of the particle spin and the black\nhole charge. These non-geodesic equations can be solved analytically in terms\nof the Mino time with the solutions involving Jacobi elliptic functions. One of\nthe bound motions considered is an oscillating orbit between two turning points\nin the radial direction.

Purpose: This\nstudy aims at combining upright static proton arcs with additional layers of\nshoot-through (ST) protons to sharpen the beam penumbra and improve plan\nquality for such systems. Methods: We examined various treatment plans for a\nvirtual phantom: 3-beam IMPT, static arc (Arc) with/without ST (Arc+ST), and\nwith/without collimation (+Coll). In the virtual phantom three different\ntargets were utilized to study the effect on conformity index (CI), homogeneity\nindex (HI), robustness and mean dose to the phantom volume. The phantom study\nwas complemented with a head-and-neck (H&N) patient case with a similar set of\nplans. The delivery time for all plans was estimated. A range verification\nconcept that determines residual ranges of the ST protons was studied in\nsimulated scenarios for the H&N case. Results: In the phantom study, the Arc+ST\nplans show superior CI, HI and target robustness compared to the Arc+Coll\nplans. For the Arc plans without ST, the collimated plans perform better than\nthe uncollimated plans. On the other hand, for Arc+ST, collimation has little\nimpact on CI, HI and robustness. For the H&N case, similar improvements for\nArc+ST can be seen. These results imply that no aperture is needed when\ncombining arcs with ST, which in turn substantially reduces treatment times.\nThe range verification simulation shows that the method is sensitive to detect\nSPR errors, setup errors and changes in the patient anatomy. Conclusions:\nCombining proton arcs and ST layers can enhance compact upright proton\nsolutions by improving plan quality. It is also tailored for the inclusion of a\nfast and straightforward residual range verification method.",

In contrast to\n``classic'' decision trees with constant values in their leaves, model trees\ncan use linear combinations of predictor variables in their leaf nodes to form\npredictions, which can help achieve higher accuracy and smaller trees. Typical\nalgorithms for learning model trees from training data work in a greedy\nfashion, growing the tree in a top-down manner by recursively splitting the\ndata into smaller and smaller subsets. Crucially, the selected splits are only\nlocally optimal, potentially rendering the tree overly complex and less\naccurate than a tree whose structure is globally optimal for the training data.\nIn this paper, we empirically investigate the effect of constructing globally\noptimal model trees for classification and regression with linear support\nvector machines at the leaf nodes. To this end, we present mixed-integer linear\nprogramming formulations to learn optimal trees, compute such trees for a large\ncollection of benchmark data sets, and compare their performance against\ngreedily grown model trees in terms of interpretability and accuracy. We also\ncompare to classic optimal and greedily grown decision trees, random forests,\nand support vector machines. Our results show that optimal model trees can\nachieve competitive accuracy with very small trees. We also investigate the\neffect on the accuracy of replacing axis-parallel splits with multivariate\nones, foregoing interpretability while potentially obtaining greater accuracy.",

This system\nis formulated as a magnetic geodesic equation on an infinite-dimensional Lie\ngroup equipped with a right-invariant metric, the $\\dot{H}^1$ -metric, which is\nclosely related to the infinite-dimensional Fisher-Rao metric, and the\nderivative of an infinite-dimensional contact-type form as the magnetic field.\nWe define Ma\\~n\\'e's critical value for exact magnetic systems on Hilbert\nmanifolds in full generality and compute it explicitly for the (M2HS).\nMoreover, we establish an infinite-dimensional Hopf-Rinow theorem for this\nmagnetic system, where Ma\\~n\\'e's critical value serves as the threshold beyond\nwhich the Hopf-Rinow theorem no longer holds. This geometric framework enables\nus to thoroughly analyze the blow-up behavior of solutions to the (M2HS). Using\nthis insight, we extend solutions beyond blow-up by introducing and proving the\nexistence of global conservative weak solutions. This extension is facilitated\nby extending the Madelung transform from an isometry into a magnetomorphism,\nembedding the magnetic system into a magnetic system on an infinite-dimensional\nsphere equipped with the derivative of the standard contact form as the\nmagnetic field.

    "abstract": "Language Models (LMs) are widely used in software engineering for code\ngeneration, but they may produce code with errors. Rather than repairing the\ngenerated code, an alternative way is to address the underlying failures of\nmodels. LM repair offers a lightweight solution to this challenge: it requires\nminimal data, reduces computational costs, and reduces the side effects. Unlike\nretraining, LM repair focuses on applying tailored updates to targeted neurons,\nmaking it ideal for scenarios with limited resources, high-performance demands,\nor strict safety requirements. In this paper, we propose Semantic Targeting for\nAnalytical Repair (STAR), a pioneering and novel semantic-based optimization\napproach for repairing LLMs. STAR realizes the main operations of repairing LMs\nin an optimization process, including locating ``buggy neurons'', solving\n``neuron patches'', and patching ``buggy neurons''. Correspondingly, it\ncomputes the deltas of weight matrix as the prior information to guide\noptimization; and attributes the targeted layers and neurons leveraging\nstatistical insights. The neuron patches are computed with a solid\nsemantic-based analytical formula, which directly bridges the changes to logits\nwith the deltas of neurons, by steering latent representations. Compared to the\nprior work of LM repair (MINT) and optimization methods (SGD), STAR integrates\ntheir strengths while mitigating their limitations. STAR supports solving\nmultiple failures together, significantly improving the usefulness. Evaluated\non coding tasks using popular code LMs, STAR exhibits superior effectiveness\n(10.5%-19.9% improvements) and efficiency (2.4-7.0 times speedup). In terms of\nside effects, namely the balance between generalization and specificity, STAR\noutperforms prior work by a significant margin. Additionally, we conducted\nassessments on the overfitting risk of LM repair as well as the cumulative\nimpact.",

Typically, to retrieve information from the cloud while\nsafeguarding privacy, the end device transforms original data into embeddings\nwith a local embedding model. However, the recently emerging Embedding\nInversion Attacks (EIAs) can still recover the original data from text\nembeddings (e.g., training a recovery model to map embeddings back to original\ntexts), posing a significant threat to user privacy. To address this risk, we\npropose EntroGuard, an entropy-driven perturbation-based embedding privacy\nprotection method, which can protect the privacy of text embeddings while\nmaintaining retrieval accuracy during the end-cloud collaboration.\nSpecifically, to defeat various EIAs, we perturb the embeddings to increase the\nentropy of the recovered text in the common structure of recovery models, thus\nsteering the embeddings toward meaningless texts rather than original sensitive\ntexts during the recovery process. To maintain retrieval performance in the\ncloud, we constrain the perturbations within a bound, applying the strategy of\nreducing them where redundant and increasing them where sparse. Moreover,\nEntroGuard can be directly integrated into end devices without requiring any\nmodifications to the embedding model.

Our findings provide direct spectroscopic insights\nto understand the strong uniaxial ferromagnetism in Sm$_{\\rm 2}$Co$_{\\rm 17}$\n(and REPMs alike).

Despite the\nsubstantial progress, most of the existing approaches tackle object tracking as\na deterministic coordinate regression problem, while the target localization\nuncertainty has been greatly overlooked, which hampers trackers' ability to\nmaintain reliable target state prediction in challenging scenarios. To address\nthis issue, we propose UncTrack, a novel uncertainty-aware transformer tracker\nthat predicts the target localization uncertainty and incorporates this\nuncertainty information for accurate target state inference. Specifically,\nUncTrack utilizes a transformer encoder to perform feature interaction between\ntemplate and search images. The output features are passed into an\nuncertainty-aware localization decoder (ULD) to coarsely predict the\ncorner-based localization and the corresponding localization uncertainty. Then\nthe localization uncertainty is sent into a prototype memory network (PMN) to\nexcavate valuable historical information to identify whether the target state\nprediction is reliable or not. To enhance the template representation, the\nsamples with high confidence are fed back into the prototype memory bank for\nmemory updating, making the tracker more robust to challenging appearance\nvariations.

Monitoring temporal patterns\nthrough time series analysis offers a potential alternative for earlier\ndetection of disturbance but requires substantial storage resources.

For networks, the increasing scale and operation\nand management (O&M) complexity drive the need for autonomous networks (AN).\nThe technical objective of AN is to ensure trustworthy O&M without human\nintervention for higher efficiency and lower operating costs. However,\nrealizing AN seems more difficult than autonomous vehicles.

Test-time\nadaptation (TTA) has emerged as a promising approach to enhance VLM performance\nunder such conditions. In practice, test data often arrives in batches, leading\nto increasing interest in the transductive TTA setting. However, existing TTA\nmethods primarily focus on individual test samples, overlooking crucial\ncross-sample correlations within a batch. While recent ViT-based TTA methods\nhave introduced batch-level adaptation, they remain suboptimal for VLMs due to\ninadequate integration of the text modality. To address these limitations, we\npropose a novel transductive TTA framework, Supportive Clique-based Attribute\nPrompting (SCAP), which effectively combines visual and textual information to\nenhance adaptation by generating fine-grained attribute prompts across test\nbatches. SCAP first forms supportive cliques of test samples in an unsupervised\nmanner based on visual similarity and learns an attribute prompt for each\nclique, capturing shared attributes critical for adaptation. For each test\nsample, SCAP aggregates attribute prompts from its associated cliques,\nproviding enriched contextual information. To ensure adaptability over time, we\nincorporate a retention module that dynamically updates attribute prompts and\ntheir associated attributes as new data arrives.

A\ndecision-dependent robust optimization model is formulated with min-max\nresilience constraint and discrete recourse structure, which helps achieve the\nload survivability target considering endogenous uncertainties. Different from\nthe traditional model with a fixed uncertainty set, we adopt a dynamic\nrepresentation that explicitly captures the endogenous uncertainties of network\ncontingency as well as the available hydrogen storage levels of MHERs, which\ninduces a decision-dependent uncertainty (DDU) set. Also, the multi-period\nadaptive routing and energy scheduling of MHERs are modeled as a mixed-integer\nrecourse problem for further decreasing the resilience cost. Then, a nested\nparametric column-and-constraint generation (N-PC&CG) algorithm is customized\nand developed to solve this challenging formulation. By leveraging the\nstructural property of the DDU set as well as the combination of discrete\nrecourse decisions and the corresponding extreme points, we derive a\nstrengthened solution scheme with nontrivial enhancement strategies to realize\nefficient and exact computation. Numerical results on 14-bus test system and\n56-bus real-world distribution network demonstrate the resilience benefits and\neconomical feasibility of the proposed method under different damage severity\nlevels.

CAT-3DGS introduces a context-adaptive triplane hyperprior for\nend-to-end optimized compression, delivering state-of-the-art coding\nperformance. Despite this, it requires prolonged training and decoding time. To\naddress these limitations, we propose CAT-3DGS Pro, an enhanced version of\nCAT-3DGS that improves both compression performance and computational\nefficiency. First, we introduce a PCA-guided vector-matrix hyperprior, which\nreplaces the triplane-based hyperprior to reduce redundant parameters. To\nachieve a more balanced rate-distortion trade-off and faster encoding, we\npropose an alternate optimization strategy (A-RDO). Additionally, we refine the\nsampling rate optimization method in CAT-3DGS, leading to significant\nimprovements in rate-distortion performance. These enhancements result in a\n46.6% BD-rate reduction and 3x speedup in training time on BungeeNeRF, while\nachieving 5x acceleration in decoding speed for the Amsterdam scene compared to\nCAT-3DGS.",

Thus, TTA is very useful in natural language processing (NLP) in the\ndialectal setting, since oftentimes, models are trained on Standard American\nEnglish (SAE), evaluated on Indian English or Nigerian English, of which\ndistribution differs significantly from the former. This is especially useful\nsince dialectal datasets are scarce. In this paper, we explore one of the most\nfamous TTA techniques, SHOT, in dialectal NLP. We finetune and evaluate SHOT on\ndifferent combinations of dialectal GLUE. Our findings show that SHOT is a\nviable technique when labeled datasets are unavailable. We also theoretically\npropose the concept of dialectal gap and show that it has a positive\ncorrelation with the effectiveness of SHOT. We also find that in many cases,\nfinetuning on SAE yields higher performance than finetuning on dialectal data.\nOur code is available at https://github.com/dukenguyenxyz/dialect-adaptation",

Most previous methods emphasize spatial\nor temporal multi-modal modeling, yet overlook challenges from ambiguous\naudio-visual correspondences such as nearby visually similar but acoustically\ndifferent objects and frequent shifts in objects' sounding status.\nConsequently, they may struggle to reliably correlate audio and visual cues,\nleading to over- or under-segmentation. To address these limitations, we\npropose a novel framework with two primary components: an audio-guided modality\nalignment (AMA) module and an uncertainty estimation (UE) module. Instead of\nindiscriminately correlating audio-visual cues through a global attention\nmechanism, AMA performs audio-visual interactions within multiple groups and\nconsolidates group features into compact representations based on their\nresponsiveness to audio cues, effectively directing the model's attention to\naudio-relevant areas. Leveraging contrastive learning, AMA further\ndistinguishes sounding regions from silent areas by treating features with\nstrong audio responses as positive samples and weaker responses as negatives.\nAdditionally, UE integrates spatial and temporal information to identify\nhigh-uncertainty regions caused by frequent changes in sound state, reducing\nprediction errors by lowering confidence in these areas. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our approach achieves superior accuracy compared to existing\nstate-of-the-art methods, particularly in challenging scenarios where\ntraditional approaches struggle to maintain reliable segmentation.",

This potential stems from\nthe rich information that is spatially and temporally contextualized across\nmultiple channels and sensing modalities. Recent work has adapted existing\nself-supervised learning approaches for such geospatial data. However, they\nfall short of scalable model architectures, leading to inflexibility and\ncomputational inefficiencies when faced with an increasing number of channels\nand modalities. To address these limitations, we introduce Low-rank Efficient\nSpatial-Spectral Vision Transformer with three key innovations: i) the LESS\nAttention Block that approximates high-dimensional spatial-spectral attention\nthrough Kronecker's product of the low-dimensional spatial and spectral\nattention components; ii) the Continuous Positional-Channel Embedding Layer\nthat preserves both the continuity and physical characteristics of each\nspatial-spectral patch; and iii) the Perception Field Mask that exploits local\nspatial dependencies by constraining attention to neighboring patches. To\nevaluate the proposed innovations, we construct GFM-Bench, which serves as a\ncomprehensive benchmark for such geospatial raster data. We pretrain LESS ViT\nusing a Hyperspectral Masked Autoencoder framework with integrated positional\nand channel masking strategies.

To address these challenges, we propose Dynamic\nDerivation and Elimination (DDESeg): a novel audio-visual segmentation\nframework. Specifically, to mitigate feature confusion, DDESeg reconstructs the\nsemantic content of the mixed audio signal by enriching the distinct semantic\ninformation of each individual source, deriving representations that preserve\nthe unique characteristics of each sound. To reduce the matching difficulty, we\nintroduce a discriminative feature learning module, which enhances the semantic\ndistinctiveness of generated audio representations. Considering that not all\nderived audio representations directly correspond to visual features (e.g.,\noff-screen sounds), we propose a dynamic elimination module to filter out\nnon-matching elements. This module facilitates targeted interaction between\nsounding regions and relevant audio semantics. By scoring the interacted\nfeatures, we identify and filter out irrelevant audio information, ensuring\naccurate audio-visual alignment.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are combined with tools to create powerful LLM\nagents that provide a wide range of services. Unlike traditional software, LLM\nagent's behavior is determined at runtime by natural language prompts from\neither user or tool's data. This flexibility enables a new computing paradigm\nwith unlimited capabilities and programmability, but also introduces new\nsecurity risks, vulnerable to privilege escalation attacks. Moreover, user\nprompts are prone to be interpreted in an insecure way by LLM agents, creating\nnon-deterministic behaviors that can be exploited by attackers. To address\nthese security risks, we propose Prompt Flow Integrity (PFI), a system\nsecurity-oriented solution to prevent privilege escalation in LLM agents.\nAnalyzing the architectural characteristics of LLM agents, PFI features three\nmitigation techniques -- i.e., agent isolation, secure untrusted data\nprocessing, and privilege escalation guardrails. Our evaluation result shows\nthat PFI effectively mitigates privilege escalation attacks while successfully\npreserving the utility of LLM agents.",

To\ntackle these issues, we propose a point cloud registration method, MT-PCR,\nbased on Modality Transformation. MT-PCR leverages a BEV capturing the maximal\noverlap information to improve the accuracy and utilizes images to provide\ncomplementary spatial features. Specifically, MT-PCR converts 3D point clouds\nto BEV images and eastimates correspondence by 2D image keypoints extraction\nand matching. Subsequently, the 2D correspondence estimates are then\ntransformed back to 3D point clouds using inverse mapping. We have applied\nMT-PCR to Terrestrial Laser Scanning and Aerial Laser Scanning point cloud\nregistration on the GrAco dataset, involving 8 low-overlap, square-kilometer\nscale registration scenarios. Experiments and comparisons with commonly used\nmethods demonstrate that MT-PCR can achieve superior accuracy and robustness in\nlarge-scale scenes with limited overlap.",

We study\nthe local and global minimum mean square error (MMSE) combining schemes to\nmaximize the uplink spectral efficiency (SE) for Level 1 and Level 2,\nrespectively. The MMSE-based successive interference cancellation detector is\nutilized to compute the uplink SE. We introduce the optimal large-scale fading\ndecoding at the central processing unit and derive closed-form SE expressions\nutilizing maximum ratio combining at APs for Level 1. Our numerical results\nreveal that hardware impairments negatively affect SE performance, particularly\nat the user end. However, this degradation can be mitigated by increasing the\nnumber of user antennas.

With the increasing availability of\nhigh-quality pre-trained model checkpoints (e.g., vision and language models),\nfine-tuning has become a popular strategy. However, despite recent progress in\nunderstanding and applying DP-SGD for private transfer learning tasks,\nsignificant challenges remain -- most notably, the performance gap between\nmodels fine-tuned with DP-SGD and their non-private counterparts. Sparse\nfine-tuning on private data has emerged as an alternative to full-model\nfine-tuning; recent work has shown that privately fine-tuning only a small\nsubset of model weights and keeping the rest of the weights fixed can lead to\nbetter performance. In this work, we propose a new approach for sparse\nfine-tuning of neural networks under DP. Existing work on private sparse\nfinetuning often used fixed choice of trainable weights (e.g., updating only\nthe last layer), or relied on public model's weights to choose the subset of\nweights to modify. Such choice of weights remains suboptimal. In contrast, we\nexplore an optimization-based approach, where our selection method makes use of\nthe private gradient information, while using off the shelf privacy accounting\ntechniques.

    "abstract": "Different from traditional secure communication that focuses on symbolic\nprotection at the physical layer, semantic secure communication requires\nfurther attention to semantic-level task performance at the application layer.\nThere is a research gap on how to comprehensively evaluate and optimize the\nsecurity performance of semantic communication. In order to fill this gap, a\nunified semantic security metric, the cross-layer semantic secure rate (CLSSR),\nis defined to estimate cross-layer security requirements at both the physical\nlayer and the application layer. Then, we formulate the maximization problem of\nthe CLSSR with the mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP). We propose a\nhierarchical AI-native semantic secure communication network with a\nreinforcement learning (RL)-based semantic resource allocation scheme, aiming\nto ensure the cross-layer semantic security (CL-SS). Finally, we prove the\nconvergence of our proposed intelligent resource allocation, and the simulation\nresults demonstrate that our proposed CLSS method outperforms the traditional\nphysical layer semantic security (PL-SS) method in terms of both task\nreliability and CLSSR.",

However, the mechanism\nunderlying the Josephson current remains unclear because of the observed h/2e\nmagnetic interference period and the lack of precisely quantized Hall plateaus.\nTo address this issue, we investigate the edge dependence of the Josephson\ncurrent in graphene Josephson junctions operating in the quantum Hall regime.\nBy systematically comparing devices with native, etched, edge-free, and\ngate-defined edges, we demonstrate that the Josephson current is confined to\nthe physical edges and is highly sensitive to specific edge configurations. Our\nfindings provide direct evidence that counter-propagating quantum Hall edge\nstates mediate Andreev bound states, enabling Josephson coupling.

Our proposed law takes a multi-power form, combining a power law\nbased on the sum of learning rates and additional power laws to account for a\nloss reduction effect induced by learning rate decay. We extensively validate\nthis law on various model sizes and architectures, and demonstrate that after\nfitting on a few learning rate schedules, the law accurately predicts the loss\ncurves for unseen schedules of different shapes and horizons. Moreover, by\nminimizing the predicted final pretraining loss across learning rate schedules,\nwe are able to find a schedule that outperforms the widely used cosine learning\nrate schedule.

We consider a wide\nrange of stellar mass of $0.1$ - $7M_{\\odot}$, and incorporate the luminosity\nevolution of the central star. For solar-mass stars, stellar evolution delays\nthe disk dispersal time as the FUV luminosity decreases toward the main\nsequence. In the case of intermediate-mass stars, the FUV luminosity increases\nsignificantly over a few million years, driving strong photoevaporation and\nenhancing disk mass loss during the later stages of disk evolution. This\nhighlights the limitations of assuming a constant FUV luminosity throughout a\nsimulation.

To facilitate\nthis task, we also carefully design and construct a dataset called multimodal\ngrounded chain-of-thought (MM-GCoT) consisting of 24,022 GCoT examples for\n5,033 images. Besides, a comprehensive consistency evaluation system is also\nintroduced, including the metrics of answer accuracy, grounding accuracy and\nanswer-grounding consistency.

    "abstract": "Handwriting verification has stood as a steadfast identity authentication\nmethod for decades. However, this technique risks potential privacy breaches\ndue to the inclusion of personal information in handwritten biometrics such as\nsignatures. To address this concern, we propose using the Random Digit String\n(RDS) for privacy-preserving handwriting verification. This approach allows\nusers to authenticate themselves by writing an arbitrary digit sequence,\neffectively ensuring privacy protection. To evaluate the effectiveness of RDS,\nwe construct a new HRDS4BV dataset composed of online naturally handwritten\nRDS. Unlike conventional handwriting, RDS encompasses unconstrained and\nvariable content, posing significant challenges for modeling consistent\npersonal writing style. To surmount this, we propose the Pattern Attentive\nVErification Network (PAVENet), along with a Discriminative Pattern Mining\n(DPM) module. DPM adaptively enhances the recognition of consistent and\ndiscriminative writing patterns, thus refining handwriting style\nrepresentation. Through comprehensive evaluations, we scrutinize the\napplicability of online RDS verification and showcase a pronounced\noutperformance of our model over existing methods. Furthermore, we discover a\nnoteworthy forgery phenomenon that deviates from prior findings and discuss its\npositive impact in countering malicious impostor attacks.

    "abstract": "The sixth-generation (6G) mobile network is envisioned to incorporate sensing\nand edge artificial intelligence (AI) as two key functions. Their natural\nconvergence leads to the emergence of Integrated Sensing and Edge AI (ISEA), a\nnovel paradigm enabling real-time acquisition and understanding of sensory\ninformation at the network edge. However, ISEA faces a communication bottleneck\ndue to the large number of sensors and the high dimensionality of sensory\nfeatures. Traditional approaches to communication-efficient ISEA lack awareness\nof semantic relevance, i.e., the level of relevance between sensor observations\nand the downstream task. To fill this gap, this paper presents a novel\nframework for semantic-relevance-aware sensor selection to achieve optimal\nend-to-end (E2E) task performance under heterogeneous sensor relevance and\nchannel states. E2E sensing accuracy analysis is provided to characterize the\nsensing task performance in terms of selected sensors' relevance scores and\nchannel states. Building on the results, the sensor-selection problem for\naccuracy maximization is formulated as an integer program and solved through a\ntight approximation of the objective. The optimal solution exhibits a\npriority-based structure, which ranks sensors based on a priority indicator\ncombining relevance scores and channel states and selects top-ranked sensors.\nLow-complexity algorithms are then developed to determine the optimal numbers\nof selected sensors and features.

The complexity of driving\nscenarios, which includes multi-view information, poses significant challenges\nfor existing MLLMs. In this paper, we introduce NuPlanQA-Eval, a multi-view,\nmulti-modal evaluation benchmark for driving scene understanding. To further\nsupport generalization to multi-view driving scenarios, we also propose\nNuPlanQA-1M, a large-scale dataset comprising 1M real-world visual\nquestion-answering (VQA) pairs. For context-aware analysis of traffic scenes,\nwe categorize our dataset into nine subtasks across three core skills: Road\nEnvironment Perception, Spatial Relations Recognition, and Ego-Centric\nReasoning. Furthermore, we present BEV-LLM, integrating Bird's-Eye-View (BEV)\nfeatures from multi-view images into MLLMs. Our evaluation results reveal key\nchallenges that existing MLLMs face in driving scene-specific perception and\nspatial reasoning from ego-centric perspectives. In contrast, BEV-LLM\ndemonstrates remarkable adaptability to this domain, outperforming other models\nin six of the nine subtasks. These findings highlight how BEV integration\nenhances multi-view MLLMs while also identifying key areas that require further\nrefinement for effective adaptation to driving scenes.

However, their application to multi-person tracking\n(MPT) has been limited due to data scarcity and the inherent difficulty of\ndistinguishing individuals. In this study, we propose a cooperative MPT system\nthat utilizes co-located RGB and thermal cameras, where pseudo-annotations\n(bounding boxes and person IDs) are used to train both RGB and thermal\ntrackers. Evaluation experiments demonstrate that the thermal tracker performs\nrobustly in both bright and dark environments. Moreover, the results suggest\nthat a tracker-switching strategy -- guided by a binary brightness classifier\n-- is more effective for information integration than a tracker-fusion\napproach. As an application example, we present an image change pattern\nrecognition (ICPR) method, the ``human-as-landmark,'' which combines two key\nproperties: the thermal recognizability of humans in dark environments and the\nrich landmark characteristics -- appearance, geometry, and semantics -- of\nstatic objects (occluders). Whereas conventional SLAM focuses on mapping static\nlandmarks in well-lit environments, the present study takes a first step toward\na new Human-Only SLAM paradigm, ``Dynamic-Dark SLAM,'' which aims to map even\ndynamic landmarks in complete darkness.

Understanding and controlling\nthe complex interactions between fuel injection, turbulent combustion, and\naerodynamic effects of compressible flows are crucial for ensuring stable\ncombustion in scramjet engines. However, identifying stable modes in scramjet\ncombustors is often challenging due to limited experimental measurement means\nand extremely complex spatiotemporal evolution of supersonic turbulent\ncombustion.

By analyzing\nthe standard deviation of latent variable trajectories, we introduce a novel\nmethod for objectively distinguishing between dynamic transitions, which\nprovides a scalable and expert-independent alternative to traditional\nclassification methods.

Our\nproposed framework adapts an adversarial IRL approach to infer the reward and\npolicy functions of activity-travel behavior. The policy function is\ninterpreted through a surrogate interpretable model based on choice\nprobabilities from the policy function, while the reward function is\ninterpreted by deriving both short-term rewards and long-term returns for\nvarious activity-travel patterns. Our analysis of real-world travel survey data\nreveals promising results in two key areas: (i) behavioral pattern insights\nfrom the policy function, highlighting critical factors in decision-making and\nvariations among socio-demographic groups, and (ii) behavioral preference\ninsights from the reward function, indicating the utility individuals gain from\nspecific activity sequences.",

    "abstract": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems rely on retrieval models for\nidentifying relevant contexts and answer generation models for utilizing those\ncontexts. However, retrievers exhibit imperfect recall and precision, limiting\ndownstream performance. We introduce RAG-RL, an answer generation model trained\nnot only to produce answers but also to identify and cite relevant information\nfrom larger sets of retrieved contexts, shifting some of the burden of\nidentifying relevant documents from the retriever to the answer generator. Our\napproach uses curriculum learning, where the model is first trained on easier\nexamples that include only relevant contexts. Our experiments show that these\ntraining samples enable models to acquire citation and reasoning skills with\ngreater sample efficiency and generalizability, demonstrating strong model\nperformance even as the number of irrelevant passages increases. We benchmark\nour methods on three open-domain multi-hop question answering datasets and\nreport significant gains in answer and citation accuracy. Our experiments\nprovide empirical insights into how easier training samples can give models\nstronger signals for learning specific skills (e.g., citation generation) and\nhow different components of post-training (e.g., training set construction,\nrule-based rewards, training sample ordering, etc.) impact final model\nperformance.",

Previous methods relying on 2D slice-based angiography\nsynthesis struggle with maintaining continuity in 3D vascular structures and\nexhibit limited effectiveness across different imaging modalities.

A pre-trained\nvision embedder is employed to construct vascular state space representations,\nenabling consistent modeling of vascular structures across multiple modalities.\nExtensive experiments on various angiographic datasets demonstrate the\nsuperiority of VasTSD over prior works, achieving enhanced continuity of blood\nvessels in synthesized angiographic synthesis for multiple modalities and\nanatomical regions.",

Despite significant efforts,\nour understanding of relevant energy transfer mechanisms, even in an\nextensively-studied benchmark like NO scattering from Au(111), remains far from\ncomplete. To fully disentangle different energy transfer channels, we develop a\nfirst-principles nonadiabatic dynamical model that incorporates explicitly all\ndegrees of freedom and the interfacial electron transfer. Our simulations\nreproduce, for the first time, most experimental observations on vibrational\nrelaxation and excitation of NO molecules under varying initial conditions and\nclearly elaborate the respective adiabatic and nonadiabatic contributions. This\nmodel identifies the direct adiabatic vibration-to-translation coupling as the\ndominant role of translation, while excluding significant\ntranslation-to-electron nonadiabatic coupling. Furthermore, the observed steric\neffect varying with the initial vibrational state is understood by the change\nof orientational dependence of the metal-to-molecule electron transfer. These\nnew insights highlight the importance of treating both adiabatic and\nnonadiabatic energy transfer pathways on an equal footing, offering significant\nimplications for modeling energy transfer processes in more complex systems,\nsuch as plasmonic photocatalysis.",

    "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based slicing policies have shown\nsignificant success in simulated environments but face challenges in physical\nsystems such as open radio access networks (O-RANs) due to\nsimulation-to-reality gaps. These policies often lack safety guarantees to\nensure compliance with service level agreements (SLAs), such as the strict\nlatency requirements of immersive applications. As a result, a deployed DRL\nslicing agent may make resource allocation (RA) decisions that degrade system\nperformance, particularly in previously unseen scenarios. Real-world immersive\napplications require maintaining SLA constraints throughout deployment to\nprevent risky DRL exploration. In this paper, we propose SafeSlice to address\nboth the cumulative (trajectory-wise) and instantaneous (state-wise) latency\nconstraints of O-RAN slices. We incorporate the cumulative constraints by\ndesigning a sigmoid-based risk-sensitive reward function that reflects the\nslices' latency requirements. Moreover, we build a supervised learning cost\nmodel as part of a safety layer that projects the slicing agent's RA actions to\nthe nearest safe actions, fulfilling instantaneous constraints. We conduct an\nexhaustive experiment that supports multiple services, including real virtual\nreality (VR) gaming traffic, to investigate the performance of SafeSlice under\nextreme and changing deployment conditions. SafeSlice achieves reductions of up\nto 83.23% in average cumulative latency, 93.24% in instantaneous latency\nviolations, and 22.13% in resource consumption compared to the baselines. The\nresults also indicate SafeSlice's robustness to changing the threshold\nconfigurations of latency constraints, a vital deployment scenario that will be\nrealized by the O-RAN paradigm to empower mobile network operators (MNOs).",

To address these limitations, we propose\nWRATH, a novel systematic approach that categorizes failures based on the\nunique layered structure of TBPP frameworks and defines specific responses to\naddress failures at different layers. WRATH combines a distributed monitoring\nsystem and a resilient module to collaboratively address different types of\nfailures in real time. The monitoring system captures execution and resource\ninformation, reports failures, and profiles tasks across different layers of\nTBPP frameworks. The resilient module then categorizes failures and responds\nwith appropriate actions, such as hierarchically retrying failed tasks on\nsuitable resources. Evaluations demonstrate that WRATH significantly improves\nTBPP robustness, tripling the task success rate and maintaining an application\nsuccess rate of over 90% for resolvable failures. Additionally, WRATH can\nreduce the time to failure by 20%-50%, allowing tasks that are destined to fail\nto be identified and fail more quickly.",

We evaluate ProtoDepth on benchmark dataset sequences, where\nwe reduce forgetting compared to baselines by 52.2% for indoor and 53.2% for\noutdoor to achieve the state of the art.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the ability of finite samples to identify two-layer\nirreducible shallow networks with various nonlinear activation functions,\nincluding rectified linear units (ReLU) and analytic functions such as the\nlogistic sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent. An ``irreducible\" network is one whose\nfunction cannot be represented by another network with fewer neurons. For ReLU\nactivation functions, we first establish necessary and sufficient conditions\nfor determining the irreducibility of a network. Subsequently, we prove a\nnegative result: finite samples are insufficient for definitive identification\nof any irreducible ReLU shallow network. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that for\na given irreducible network, one can construct a finite set of sampling points\nthat can distinguish it from other network with the same neuron count.\nConversely, for logistic sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent activation functions,\nwe provide a positive result. We construct finite samples that enable the\nrecovery of two-layer irreducible shallow analytic networks. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first study to investigate the exact identification of\ntwo-layer irreducible networks using finite sample function values. Our\nfindings provide insights into the comparative performance of networks with\ndifferent activation functions under limited sampling conditions.",

    "abstract": "Despite their potential to address crucial bottlenecks in computing\narchitectures and contribute to the pool of biological inspiration for\nengineering, pathological biological mechanisms remain absent from\ncomputational theory. We hereby introduce the concept of cancer-inspired\ncomputing as a paradigm drawing from the adaptive, resilient, and evolutionary\nstrategies of cancer, for designing computational systems capable of thriving\nin dynamic, adversarial or resource-constrained environments. Unlike known\nbioinspired approaches (e.g., evolutionary and neuromorphic architectures),\ncancer-inspired computing looks at emulating the uniqueness of cancer cells\nsurvival tactics, such as somatic mutation, metastasis, angiogenesis and immune\nevasion, as parallels to desirable features in computing architectures, for\nexample decentralized propagation and resource optimization, to impact areas\nlike fault tolerance and cybersecurity. While the chaotic growth of cancer is\ncurrently viewed as uncontrollable in biology, randomness-based algorithms are\nalready being successfully demonstrated in enhancing the capabilities of other\ncomputing architectures, for example chaos computing integration. This vision\nfocuses on the concepts of multilevel intelligence and context-driven mutation,\nand their potential to simultaneously overcome plasticity-limited neuromorphic\napproaches and the randomness of chaotic approaches. The introduction of this\nconcept aims to generate interdisciplinary discussion to explore the potential\nof cancer-inspired mechanisms toward powerful and resilient artificial systems.",

Our analysis reveals that such emergent\nstructures enable multi-head attention to approximately implement a debiased\ngradient descent predictor -- one that outperforms single-head attention and\nnearly achieves Bayesian optimality up to proportional factor. Furthermore,\ncompared to linear transformers, the softmax attention readily generalizes to\nsequences longer than those seen during training.

    "abstract": "Matrix completion is fundamental for predicting missing data with a wide\nrange of applications in personalized healthcare, e-commerce, recommendation\nsystems, and social network analysis. Traditional matrix completion approaches\ntypically assume centralized data storage, which raises challenges in terms of\ncomputational efficiency, scalability, and user privacy. In this paper, we\naddress the problem of federated matrix completion, focusing on scenarios where\nuser-specific data is distributed across multiple clients, and privacy\nconstraints are uncompromising. Federated learning provides a promising\nframework to address these challenges by enabling collaborative learning across\ndistributed datasets without sharing raw data. We propose \\texttt{FedMC-ADMM}\nfor solving federated matrix completion problems, a novel algorithmic framework\nthat combines the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers with a randomized\nblock-coordinate strategy and alternating proximal gradient steps. Unlike\nexisting federated approaches, \\texttt{FedMC-ADMM} effectively handles\nmulti-block nonconvex and nonsmooth optimization problems, allowing efficient\ncomputation while preserving user privacy. We analyze the theoretical\nproperties of our algorithm, demonstrating subsequential convergence and\nestablishing a convergence rate of $\\mathcal{O}(K^{-1/2})$, leading to a\ncommunication complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-2})$ for reaching an\n$\\epsilon$-stationary point. This work is the first to establish these\ntheoretical guarantees for federated matrix completion in the presence of\nmulti-block variables. To validate our approach, we conduct extensive\nexperiments on real-world datasets, including MovieLens 1M, 10M, and Netflix.\nThe results demonstrate that \\texttt{FedMC-ADMM} outperforms existing methods\nin terms of convergence speed and testing accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Studies in reward shaping for reinforcement learning (RL) have flourished in\nrecent years due to its ability to speed up training. Our previous work\nproposed an adaptive potential function (APF) and showed that APF can\naccelerate the Q-learning with a Multi-layer Perceptron algorithm in the\nlow-dimensional domain. This paper proposes to extend APF with an encoder\n(APF+) for RL state representation, allowing applying APF to the pixel-based\nAtari games using a state-encoding method that projects high-dimensional game's\npixel frames to low-dimensional embeddings. We approach by designing the\nstate-representation encoder as a W-shaped network (W-Net), by using which we\nare able to encode both the background as well as the moving entities in the\ngame frames. Specifically, the embeddings derived from the pre-trained W-Net\nconsist of two latent vectors: One represents the input state, and the other\nrepresents the deviation of the input state's representation from itself. We\nthen incorporate W-Net into APF to train a downstream Dueling Deep Q-Network\n(DDQN), obtain the APF-WNet-DDQN, and demonstrate its effectiveness in Atari\ngame-playing tasks. To evaluate the APF+W-Net module in such high-dimensional\ntasks, we compare with two types of baseline methods: (i) the basic DDQN; and\n(ii) two encoder-replaced APF-DDQN methods where we replace W-Net by (a) an\nunsupervised state representation method called Spatiotemporal Deep Infomax\n(ST-DIM) and (b) a ground truth state representation provided by the Atari\nAnnotated RAM Interface (ARI). The experiment results show that out of 20 Atari\ngames, APF-WNet-DDQN outperforms DDQN (14/20 games) and APF-STDIM-DDQN (13/20\ngames) significantly. In comparison against the APF-ARI-DDQN which employs\nembeddings directly of the detailed game-internal state information, the\nAPF-WNet-DDQN achieves a comparable performance.",

    "abstract": "This study utilizes a hybrid Finite Element Method (FEM) and Material Point\nMethod (MPM) to investigate the runout of liquefaction-induced flow slide\nfailures. The key inputs to this analysis are the earthquake ground motion,\nwhich induces liquefaction, and the post-liquefaction residual strength. The\ninfluence of these factors on runout is evaluated by subjecting a model of a\ntailings dam to thirty different earthquake motions and by assigning different\nvalues of post-liquefaction residual strength. Ground motions with larger peak\nground accelerations (PGA) generate liquefaction to larger depths, thus\nmobilizing a greater mass of material and resulting in a flow slide with\ngreater runout. However, different ground motions with the same PGA yield\nsignificant variations in the depth of liquefaction, indicating that other\nground motion characteristics (e.g., frequency content) also exert significant\ninfluence over the initiation of liquefaction. Ground motion characteristics of\npeak ground velocity (PGV) and Modified Acceleration Spectrum Intensity (MASI)\nshow a strong correlation to the induced depth of liquefaction because they\ncapture both the intensity and frequency content of the earthquake motion. The\ncomputed runout is directly related to the depth of liquefaction induced by the\nearthquake motion. For dam geometry analyzed, measurable runout occurs when\nliquefaction extends to 10 m depth and the runout is maximized when\nliquefaction extends to about 18 m. Strain-softening of the residual strength\nof the liquefied tailings during runout is shown to substantially increase the\nrunout distance of the flow slide, highlighting the need for additional\nresearch to better characterize the appropriate strength of liquefied materials\nduring flow failures.",

    "abstract": "Stereo images are fundamental to numerous applications, including extended\nreality (XR) devices, autonomous driving, and robotics. Unfortunately,\nacquiring high-quality stereo images remains challenging due to the precise\ncalibration requirements of dual-camera setups and the complexity of obtaining\naccurate, dense disparity maps. Existing stereo image generation methods\ntypically focus on either visual quality for viewing or geometric accuracy for\nmatching, but not both. We introduce GenStereo, a diffusion-based approach, to\nbridge this gap. The method includes two primary innovations (1) conditioning\nthe diffusion process on a disparity-aware coordinate embedding and a warped\ninput image, allowing for more precise stereo alignment than previous methods,\nand (2) an adaptive fusion mechanism that intelligently combines the\ndiffusion-generated image with a warped image, improving both realism and\ndisparity consistency. Through extensive training on 11 diverse stereo\ndatasets, GenStereo demonstrates strong generalization ability. GenStereo\nachieves state-of-the-art performance in both stereo image generation and\nunsupervised stereo matching tasks. Project page is available at\nhttps://qjizhi.github.io/genstereo.",

A major\nchallenge in $hr$-adaptive finite element methods lies in projecting the\nprevious step's finite element solution onto the updated mesh. This projection\ndepends on the new mesh and must be recomputed for each adaptive iteration. To\naddress this, we introduce a neural network to construct a mesh-free surrogate\nof the previous step finite element solution. Since the neural network is\nmesh-free, it only requires training once per time step, with its parameters\ninitialized using the optimizer from the previous time step. This approach\neffectively overcomes the interpolation challenges associated with non-nested\nmeshes in computation, making node insertion and movement more convenient and\nefficient. The new algorithm also emphasizes SIZING and GENERATE, allowing each\nrefinement to roughly double the number of mesh nodes of the previous iteration\nand then redistribute them to form a new mesh that effectively captures the\nsingularities. It significantly reduces the time required for repeated\nrefinement and achieves the desired accuracy in no more than seven\nspace-adaptive iterations per time step. Numerical experiments confirm the\nefficiency of the proposed algorithm in capturing dynamic changes of\nsingularities.",

In an\nAM, superconductivity (SC) is faced with a dilemma that the spin-polarized\nbands, induced by the broken time reversal (T ) symmetry, dominantly supports\nspin-triplet pairing. In contrast, AM spin fluctuations routinely facilitate\nspin-singlet pairing as in AFM. Consequently, unconventional SC is either\nabsent or weak in AM materials. Here, we propose that stacking 2D AM materials\ncould resolve this dilemma. Stacked 2D materials have yielded a variety of new\nelectronic properties by altering the symmetries inherent in the monolayer. In\na 2D anisotropic Hubbard model, we investigate the general energy dispersions\nof both single-layer and stacked AM materials. We demonstrate that AM sheet\nstacking can alter the original symmetries, consequently affecting the energy\ndispersion. The interlayer magnetic coupling enhances the low q magnetic\nfluctuations. T symmetry is restored in the AA stacking with an\nantiferromagnetic interlayer coupling, and then both the energy dispersion and\npairing interaction are in favor of spin-singlet SC. The ferromagnetic\ninterlayer coupling in the AB stacking not only recovers T symmetry but also\nsupports spin-triplet pairing. It is further anticipated that twisted bilayer\nAM sheets could exhibit additional novel electronic properties, including\ntopology, flat bands, and collective excitations. Our work illustrates that\nstacking sheets of AM materials could open up a unique research domain in\nexploring novel quantum phenomena and offer a fertile ground for potential\nelectronic applications.",

This article argues that the juxtaposition of\nthe two phenomena helps to reveal that they both share two fundamental traits\nas both elevate form and appearance over substance and content, and users of\nboth routinely mistake the form for the substance. In drawing upon legal\ntheory, computer science, linguistics and cognitive psychology, the article\nargues that both phenomena rely upon creating illusions of meaning that users\nmistake for the underlying primary phenomenon. I then explore four implications\nof this conception of both phenomena. Firstly, both rely on human tendencies of\nconceptual pareidolia resulting in the erroneous perception of meaningful\nlinguistic legal patterns from nebulous inputs. Secondly, both rely upon the\nconfidence heuristic, the human cognitive bias for treating confidence as a\nproxy for competence. Thirdly, both succeed when the primary concern is with\nthe form of the output and not its content. Fourthly, both rely heavily upon\nthe magical thinking of users and the desire for the promise of the approach to\nbe real. The article argues that the legal context helps to reveal a solution\nfor the problems caused by both phenomena as it is only where users possess\nsufficient legal and technological literacy that it becomes possible to reveal\nto them the illusionary nature of the phenomena.",

    "abstract": "The Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) will enable a transformative leap in\nthe direct imaging and characterization of Earth-like exoplanets. For this,\nNASA is focusing on early investment in technology development prior to mission\ndefinition and actively seeking international partnerships earlier than for\nprevious missions. The \"R&D for Space-Based HCI in Europe\" workshop, held in\nMarch 2024 at Paris Observatory, convened leading experts in high-contrast\nimaging (HCI) to discuss European expertise and explore potential strategies\nfor European contributions to HWO. This paper synthesizes the discussions and\noutcomes of the workshop, highlighting Europe's critical contributions to past\nand current HCI efforts, the synergies between ground- and space-based\ntechnologies, and the importance of laboratory testbeds and collaborative\nfunding mechanisms.\n  Key conclusions include the need for Europe to invest in technology\ndevelopment for areas such as deformable mirrors and advanced detectors, and\nestablish or enhance laboratory facilities for system-level testing. Putting\nemphasis on the urgency of aligning with the timeline of the HWO, the\nparticipants called on an open affirmation by the European Space Agency (ESA)\nthat a European contribution to HWO is clearly anticipated, to signal national\nagencies and unlock funding opportunities at the national level. Based on the\nexpertise demonstrated through R&D, Europe is poised to play a pivotal role in\nadvancing global HCI capabilities, contributing to the characterization of\ntemperate exoplanets and fostering innovation across domains.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in deep-learning based methods for image matching have\ndemonstrated their superiority over traditional algorithms, enabling\ncorrespondence estimation in challenging scenes with significant differences in\nviewing angles, illumination and weather conditions. However, the existing\ndatasets, learning frameworks, and evaluation metrics for the deep-learning\nbased methods are limited to ground-based images recorded with pinhole cameras\nand have not been explored for satellite images. In this paper, we present\n``SatDepth'', a novel dataset that provides dense ground-truth correspondences\nfor training image matching frameworks meant specifically for satellite images.\nSatellites capture images from various viewing angles and tracks through\nmultiple revisits over a region. To manage this variability, we propose a\ndataset balancing strategy through a novel image rotation augmentation\nprocedure. This procedure allows for the discovery of corresponding pixels even\nin the presence of large rotational differences between the images. We\nbenchmark four existing image matching frameworks using our dataset and carry\nout an ablation study that confirms that the models trained with our dataset\nwith rotation augmentation outperform (up to 40% increase in precision) the\nmodels trained with other datasets, especially when there exist large\nrotational differences between the images.",

Data is a critical resource in BCI research and a key\nfactor in the development of BCI technology, making efficient storage and\nmanagement of this data increasingly vital. In the realm of research, ample\ndata can facilitate the development of novel algorithms, which can be more\naccurately validated. In terms of applications, well-organized data can foster\nthe emergence of new business opportunities, thereby maximizing the commercial\nvalue of the data. Currently, there are two major challenges in the storage and\nmanagement of BCI data: providing different classification storage modes for\nmulti-modal data, and adapting to varying application scenarios while improving\nstorage strategies. To address these challenges, this study has developed the\nNeuroStore BCI data persistence system, which provides a general and easily\nscalable data model and can effectively handle multiple types of data storage.\nThe system has a flexible distributed framework and can be widely applied to\nvarious scenarios.

    "abstract": "The jellium model is a paradigmatic problem in condensed matter physics,\nexhibiting a phase transition between metallic and Wigner crystal phases.\nHowever, its vanishing Berry curvature makes it ill-suited for studying recent\nexperimental platforms that combine strong interactions with nontrivial quantum\ngeometry. These experiments inspired the anomalous Hall crystal (AHC) -- a\ntopological variant of the Wigner crystal. The AHC spontaneously breaks\ncontinuous translation symmetry but has a nonzero Chern number. In this work,\nwe introduce $\\lambda-$jellium, a minimal extension of the two-dimensional\njellium model. Its Berry curvature distribution is controlled by a single\nparameter, $\\lambda$, where $\\lambda=0$ corresponds to the standard jellium\nmodel. This setup facilitates the systematic exploration of Berry curvature's\nimpact on electron crystallization. The phase diagram of this model,\nestablished using self-consistent Hartree Fock calculations, reveals several\ninteresting features: (i) The AHC phase occupies a large region of the phase\ndiagram. (ii) Two distinct Wigner crystal phases, the latter enabled by quantum\ngeometry, and two distinct Fermi liquid phases are present. (iii) A continuous\nphase transition separates the AHC and one of the WC phases. (iv) In some parts\nof the AHC phase, the lattice geometry is non-triangular, unlike in the\nclassical Wigner crystal. In addition to elucidating the physics of correlated\nelectrons with nonzero Berry curvature, we expect that the simplicity of the\nmodel makes it an excellent starting point for more advanced numerical methods.",

    "abstract": "Let $(M^{n+1},g_+)$ be an asymptotically hyperbolic manifold. We compute the\nCheeger constant of conformally compact asymptotically constant mean curvature\nsubmanifolds $ \\iota : Y^{k+1} \\to (M^{n+1},g_+)$ with arbitrary codimension.\nAs an application, we provide two classes of examples of $(n+1)$-dimensional\nasymptotically hyperbolic manifolds with Cheeger constant equal to $n$, whose\nconformal infinity is of the following types: 1) positive Yamabe invariant, and\n2) negative Yamabe invariant. Moreover, in the same spirit as\nBlitz--Gover--Waldron \\cite{BlitzSamuel2021CFFa}, we show that an\nasymptotically hyperbolic manifold with umbilic boundary is conformally weakly\nPoincar\\'e--Einstein if and only if the third conformal fundamental form of the\nboundary vanishes. Next, in the space of asymptotically minimal hypersurfaces\n$Y$ within a Poincar\\'e--Einstein manifold, we identify an extrinsic conformal\ninvariant of $\\partial Y$ which obstructs the vanishing of the mean curvature\nof $Y$ to second order. This conformal invariant is a linear combination of two\nRiemannian hypersurface invariants of $\\partial Y,$ one which depends on its\nextrinsic geometry within $\\overline{Y}$ and the other on its extrinsic\ngeometry within $\\partial M;$ neither of which are conformal invariants\nindividually. Finally, we show that for asymptotically minimal hypersurfaces\nwith mean curvature vanishing to second order inside of a Poincar\\'e--Einstein\nspace, being weakly Poincar\\'e--Einstein is equivalent to the boundary of $Y$\nhaving vanishing second and third conformal fundamental forms when viewed as a\nhypersurface within the conformal infinity.",
