    "abstract": "We introduce a time-dimensional reduction method for the inverse source\nproblem in linear elasticity, where the goal is to reconstruct the initial\ndisplacement and velocity fields from partial boundary measurements of elastic\nwave propagation. The key idea is to employ a novel spectral representation in\ntime, using an orthonormal basis composed of Legendre polynomials weighted by\nexponential functions. This Legendre polynomial-exponential basis enables a\nstable and accurate decomposition in the time variable, effectively reducing\nthe original space-time inverse problem to a sequence of coupled spatial\nelasticity systems that no longer depend on time. These resulting systems are\nsolved using the quasi-reversibility method. On the theoretical side, we\nestablish a convergence theorem ensuring the stability and consistency of the\nregularized solution obtained by the quasi-reversibility method as the noise\nlevel tends to zero. On the computational side, two-dimensional numerical\nexperiments confirm the theory and demonstrate the method's ability to\naccurately reconstruct both the geometry and amplitude of the initial data,\neven in the presence of substantial measurement noise. The results highlight\nthe effectiveness of the proposed framework as a robust and computationally\nefficient strategy for inverse elastic source problems.",

    "abstract": "The newly established IEEE 802.11bf Task Group aims to amend the WLAN\nstandard to support advanced sensing applications such as human activity\nrecognition (HAR). Although studies have demonstrated the potential of sub-7\nGHz Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI) for HAR, no method currently performs\nreliably in real-world scenarios. This work tackles the poor generalization of\nWi-Fi-based HAR by introducing an innovative approach to extracting and\nutilizing movement-related representations, which makes it robust to noise and\nstatic environmental properties. This is achieved by transforming CSI signals\ninto the delay profile space and decomposing them into various Doppler\nvelocities, which serve as informative projections of a mobile point's velocity\nfrom different unknown random angles. To mitigate the impact of this\nrandomness, MORIC is introduced as a novel time series classification model\nbased on random convolutional kernels, designed to be invariant to the random\norder and repetition of input representations, thereby enabling robust Wi-Fi\nCSI-based activity classification. Experimental results on the collected\ndataset demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art\napproaches in terms of generalization accuracy for hand motion recognition,\nparticularly for challenging gestures.

    "abstract": "GaN defect based quantum emitters have recently gained attention as promising\nsingle photon sources for quantum information applications. However, dephasing\nprocesses, manifested as photoluminescence (PL) linewidth broadening, pose a\nlimitation to photon indistinguishability. In this study, we use a custom built\nconfocal scanning microscope to examine the temperature dependent PL spectra of\nGaN defect quantum emitters integrated with solid immersion lenses, with the\ngoal of elucidating their dephasing mechanisms. Our experimental findings show\nthat at low temperatures, the PL lineshape exhibits a Gaussian profile with a\nconstant, temperature independent linewidth, consistent with spectral\ndiffusion. As the temperature increases, the PL lineshape evolves into a\nLorentzian, and the temperature dependent linewidth deviates from the common T3\nlaw. Considering the Debye temperature of GaN (about 600 K), the experimentally\nobserved temperature dependent linewidth can be modeled by the quadratic Stark\neffect modulated by acoustic phonons in defect rich crystals. Furthermore, this\nmodel exhibits a level of accuracy comparable to that of the defect-E2(low)\noptical phonon coupling model previously reported in the literature. Our work\nreveals the mechanism of acoustic phonon induced dephasing in GaN defect\nemitters and demonstrates that both acoustic and optical phonons can contribute\nto their dephasing.",

    ],
    "abstract": "We propose a covariant definition of an inertia tensor on spatial\nhypersurfaces in general relativity, constructed via integrals of geodesic\ndistance functions using the exponential map. In the ADM 3+1 decomposition, we\nconsider a spacelike slice (Sigma, gamma_ij) with induced metric gamma_ij,\nlapse N, shift N^i, and a mass-energy density rho(x) on Sigma. At each point p\nin Sigma, we define a Riemannian inertia tensor I_p(u,v) as an integral over\nSigma involving geodesic distances and the exponential map. This reduces to the\nNewtonian inertia tensor in the flat-space limit. An expansion in Riemann\nnormal coordinates shows curvature corrections involving the spatial Riemann\ntensor. We apply this to two cases: (i) for closed or open FLRW slices, a\nspherical shell of matter has an effective moment of inertia scaled by (chi_0 /\nsin(chi_0))^2 > 1 or (chi_0 / sinh(chi_0))^2 < 1, confirming that positive\ncurvature increases and negative curvature decreases inertia; and (ii) for a\nslowly rotating relativistic star (Hartle--Thorne approximation), we recover\nthe known result: I = (8 pi / 3) integral from 0 to R of rho(r) exp(-(nu +\nlambda)/2) [omega_bar(r)/Omega] r^4 dr. In the Newtonian limit, this becomes\nI_Newt = (8 pi / 3) integral from 0 to R of rho(r) r^4 dr. We show that I_p\nreproduces these corrections and encodes post-Newtonian contributions\nconsistent with Thorne's and Dixon's multipole formalisms. We also discuss the\nrelation to Geroch--Hansen moments and propose an extension to dynamical slices\ninvolving extrinsic curvature. This work thus provides a unified, geometric\naccount of inertia and multipole structure in general relativity, bridging\nNewtonian intuition and relativistic corrections.",

Addressing the lack of inductive biases and dependence on\nextensive training datasets in ViTs, our model employs a CNN backbone to\ngenerate hierarchical visual representations.

We also introduce a\nscale-wise attention mechanism that directly captures intra-scale and\ninter-scale associations. This mechanism complements patch-wise attention by\nenhancing spatial understanding and preserving global perception, which we\nrefer to as local and global attention, respectively. Our model significantly\noutperforms baseline models in terms of classification accuracy, demonstrating\nits efficiency in bridging the gap between Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)\nand Vision Transformers (ViTs).

This\ngraph contains rich event information useful to reveal bias: four common types\nof in-doc event relations to reflect content framing bias, cross-doc event\ncoreference relation to reveal content selection bias, and event-level moral\nopinions to highlight opinionated framing bias. We further develop two\nstrategies to incorporate the multi-document event relation graph for\nneutralized summarization. Firstly, we convert a graph into natural language\ndescriptions and feed the textualized graph into LLMs as a part of a hard text\nprompt. Secondly, we encode the graph with graph attention network and insert\nthe graph embedding into LLMs as a soft prompt. Both automatic evaluation and\nhuman evaluation confirm that our approach effectively mitigates both lexical\nand informational media bias, and meanwhile improves content preservation.",

    "abstract": "An impurity immersed in a Bose condensate can form a quasiparticle known as a\nBose polaron. When the impurity-boson interaction is short-ranged, the\nquasiparticle's properties are universal, characterized - independent of the\nbath density $n_0$ - by the impurity-boson scattering length $a_{IB}$.\nLong-ranged interactions - such as provided by Rydberg or ionic impurities -\nintroduce an effective interaction range $r_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, and boson-boson\ninteractions provide a third length scale, the condensate coherence length $\\xi\n$. These competing length scales raise the question of whether a universal\ndescription remains valid across different bath densities. In this study, we\ndiscuss the quasiparticle nature of long-range impurities and its dependence on\nthe length scales $ n_0^{-1/3} $, $ r_{\\mathrm{eff}} $, and $ \\xi $. We employ\ntwo complementary theories - the coherent state Ansatz and the perturbative\nGross-Pitaevskii theory - which incorporate beyond-Fr\\\"ohlich interactions. We\nderive an analytical expression for the beyond-Fr\\\"ohlich effective mass for a\ncontact interaction and numerically compute the effective mass for long-range\nimpurities. We argue that the coupling parameter $ |a_{IB}| n_0^{1/3} $ remains\nthe principal parameter governing the properties of the polaron. For weak $\n(|a_{IB}| n_0^{1/3} \\ll 1) $ and intermediate $ (|a_{IB}| n_0^{1/3} \\simeq 1) $\nvalues of the coupling parameter, long-range impurities in a BEC are\nwell-described as quasiparticles with a finite quasiparticle weight and a\nwell-defined effective mass. However, the quasiparticle weight becomes\nsignificantly suppressed as the effective impurity volume is occupied by an\nincreasing number of bath particles $ (r_{\\mathrm{eff}} n_0^{1/3} \\gg 1) $.",

We show that conventional unlearning algorithms,\noriginally designed for non-reasoning models, are inadequate for LRMs. In\nparticular, even when final answers are successfully erased, sensitive\ninformation often persists within the intermediate reasoning steps, i.e., CoT\ntrajectories. To address this challenge, we extend conventional unlearning and\npropose Reasoning-aware Representation Misdirection for Unlearning ($R^2MU$), a\nnovel method that effectively suppresses sensitive reasoning traces and\nprevents the generation of associated final answers, while preserving the\nmodel's reasoning ability.

Many authors have proposed a probabilistic framework\nto soften the axiomatic approach. Instead of immediately passing to random\npreference profiles, we begin by measuring the degree to which an axiom is\nupheld or violated on a given profile. We focus on two foundational\naxioms-Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA) and Unanimity (U)-and\nextend them to take values in $[0,1]$. Our $\\sigma_{IIA}$ measures the\nstability of a voting rule when candidates are removed from consideration,\nwhile $\\sigma_{U}$ captures the degree to which the outcome respects majority\npreferences. Together, these metrics quantify how a voting rule navigates the\nfundamental trade-off highlighted by Arrow's Theorem. We show that\n$\\sigma_{IIA}\\equiv 1$ recovers classical IIA, and $\\sigma_{U}>0$ recovers\nclassical Unanimity, allowing a quantitative restatement of Arrow's Theorem. In\nthe empirical part of the paper, we test these metrics on two kinds of data: a\nset of over 1000 ranked choice preference profiles from Scottish local\nelections, and a batch of synthetic preference profiles generated with a\nBradley-Terry-type model. We use those to investigate four positional voting\nrules-Plurality, 2-Approval, 3-Approval, and the Borda rule-as well as the\niterative rule known as Single Transferable Vote (STV). The Borda rule\nconsistently receives the highest $\\sigma_{IIA}$ and $\\sigma_{U}$ scores across\nobserved and synthetic elections.

To accurately assess the\nefficiency of these applications, it is necessary to account for the drift of\nthe ablated material toward the low-field side. In this study, we have\nimplemented a semi-analytical model for ablation cloud drifts in the numerical\ndisruption modelling tool DREAM. We show that this model is capable of\nreproducing the density evolution in shattered pellet injection (SPI)\nexperiments in ASDEX Upgrade, for model parameters within the expected range.\nThe model is then used to investigate the prospects for disruption mitigation\nby staggered SPIs in 15 MA DT H-mode ITER scenarios. We find that the drifts\nmay decrease the assimilation of pure deuterium SPIs by about an order of\nmagnitude, which may be important to consider when designing the disruption\nmitigation scheme in ITER. The ITER scenarios studied here generally result in\nsimilar multi-MA runaway electron (RE) currents, regardless of the drift\nassumptions, but the effect of the drift is larger in situations with a fast\nand early thermal quench. The RE current may also be more strongly affected by\nthe drift losses when accounting for RE losses caused by the vertical plasma\nmotion.",

The specifics of the interactions are notably different when the gas\nis atomic or molecular. Motivated by the idea that molecules survive to high\naltitudes in some exoplanets, we built a model for the energy transfer from\nnonthermal electrons to the H2O, H2, and O2 molecules. Our calculations show\nthat the primary electrons of energy above about a hundred eV, a likely outcome\nfrom X-ray photoionization at moderately high atmospheric densities, expend\nmost of their energy in ionization, dissociation, and electronic excitation\ncollisions. In contrast, the primary electrons of less than about ten eV, such\nas those produced by extreme-ultraviolet photons at low densities, expend most\nof their energy in momentum transfer (heating), rotational, and vibrational\nexcitation collisions. The partitioning between channels with weak thresholds\nis particularly sensitive to local fractional ionization. The transition\nbetween these two situations introduces a parallel transition in the way that\nthe stellar energy is deposited in the atmosphere. Our calculations show that\nthe nonthermal electrons enhance the ionization rate by a factor of a few or\nmore with respect to photoionization alone but may not greatly contribute to\nthe direct dissociation of molecules unless the local flux of far-ultraviolet\nphotons is relatively weak. These findings highlight the importance of tracking\nthe energy from the incident photons to the nonthermal electrons and onto the\ngas for problems concerned with the remote sensing and energy balance of\nexoplanet atmospheres.",

CHB-$k$ and CLB-$k$ coincide with proportionality for $k=1$. For\nall $k \\leq n$, CHB-$k$ allocations are a superset of envy-free allocations\n(i.e., easier to find).

While significant progress has been made on the numerical\nfront, theoretical understanding of turbulence in stellarators is still\nlacking.

Performing a PuD operation involves activating\nmultiple DRAM rows in quick succession or simultaneously, i.e., multiple-row\nactivation. Multiple-row activation is fundamentally different from\nconventional memory access patterns that activate one DRAM row at a time.\nHowever, repeatedly activating even one DRAM row (e.g., RowHammer) can induce\nbitflips in unaccessed DRAM rows because modern DRAM is subject to read\ndisturbance. Unfortunately, no prior work investigates the effects of\nmultiple-row activation on DRAM read disturbance.\n  In this paper, we present the first characterization study of read\ndisturbance effects of multiple-row activation-based PuD (which we call\nPuDHammer) using 316 real DDR4 DRAM chips from four major DRAM manufacturers.\nOur detailed characterization show that 1) PuDHammer significantly exacerbates\nthe read disturbance vulnerability, causing up to 158.58x reduction in the\nminimum hammer count required to induce the first bitflip ($HC_{first}$),\ncompared to RowHammer, 2) PuDHammer is affected by various operational\nconditions and parameters, 3) combining RowHammer with PuDHammer is more\neffective than using RowHammer alone to induce read disturbance error, e.g.,\ndoing so reduces $HC_{first}$ by 1.66x on average, and 4) PuDHammer bypasses an\nin-DRAM RowHammer mitigation mechanism (Target Row Refresh) and induces more\nbitflips than RowHammer.\n  To develop future robust PuD-enabled systems in the presence of PuDHammer, we\n1) develop three countermeasures and 2) adapt and evaluate the state-of-the-art\nRowHammer mitigation standardized by industry, called Per Row Activation\nCounting (PRAC). We show that the adapted PRAC incurs large performance\noverheads (48.26%, on average).",

    "abstract": "We consider a multiple-species mixture of interacting bosons, $N_1$ bosons of\nmass $m_1$, $N_2$ bosons of mass $m_2$, and $N_3$ bosons of mass $m_3$ in a\nharmonic trap of frequency $\\omega$. The corresponding intraspecies interaction\nstrengths are $\\lambda_{11}$, $\\lambda_{22}$, and $\\lambda_{33}$, and the\ninterspecies interaction strengths are $\\lambda_{12}$, $\\lambda_{13}$, and\n$\\lambda_{23}$. When the shape of all interactions are harmonic, this is the\ngeneric multiple-species harmonic-interaction model which is exactly solvable.\nWe start by solving the many-particle Hamiltonian and concisely discussing the\nground-state wavefunction and energy in explicit forms as functions of all\nparameters, the masses, numbers of particles, and the intraspecies and\ninterspecies interaction strengths. We then move to compute explicitly the\nreduced one-particle density matrices for all the species and diagonalize them,\nthus generalizing the treatment in [J. Chem. Phys. {\\bf 161}, 184307 (2024)].\nThe respective eigenvalues determine the degree of fragmentation of each\nspecies. As applications, we focus on aspects that do not appear for the\nrespective single-species and two-species systems. For instance, placing a\nmixture of two kinds of bosons in a bath made by a third kind, and controlling\nthe fragmentation of the former by coupling to the latter. Another example\nexploits the possibility of different connectivities (i.e., which species\ninteracts with which species) in the mixture, and demonstrates how the\nfragmentation of species $3$ can be manipulated by the interaction between\nspecies $1$ and species $2$, when species $3$ and $1$ do not interact with each\nother. We thereby highlight properties of fragmentation that only appear in the\nmultiple-species mixture. Further applications are briefly discussed.",

The\ncomplete set of these constants forms an agent-specific coupling profile that\ngoverns internal information flow, shaping the agent's overall processing\ntendencies and cognitive style. We provide a detailed taxonomy of these\nintra-level coupling roles, covering domains such as perceptual integration,\nmemory access and formation, planning, meta-cognition, execution control, and\naffective modulation. We also explore how these coupling profiles generate\nfeedback loops, systemic dynamics, and emergent signatures of cognitive\nbehavior. Methodologies for inferring these profiles from behavioral or\ninternal agent data are outlined, along with a discussion of how these\ncouplings evolve across abstraction levels.

The method achieves state-of-the-art performance and\nscales to massive databases of tens of millions of news articles and hundreds\nof events happening globally.

Observations of nearby\nstar-forming galaxies support the existence of such a change.

For this work,\nwe used an extended set of high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations of\nisolated disc galaxies with initial properties (i.e. stellar mass, gas\nfraction, stellar disc scale length, and the bulge mass fraction) with\nproperties covering the range of galaxies in the PHANGS sample to investigate\nthis change of regime. We studied the physical properties of the star-forming\nISM in both stellar mass regimes and extracted a few physical tracers: the\ninner Lindblad resonance (ILR), the probability distribution function (PDF),\nthe virial parameter, and the Mach number. In line with observations, we\nconfirm a structure transition in the simulations that occurs between a stellar\nmass of $10^{9.5}$ and $10^{10}$ M$_{\\odot}$.

We identify the most relevant Wilson coefficients (WCs) affecting the\ntrilinear Higgs coupling ($hhh$) and Higgs-vector boson interactions ($hVV$,\n$hhVV$).

The empirical results reveal that\neven state-of-the-art LLMs that can solve complex real-world reasoning tasks\ncould fall short on the hard tier of PersonaFeedback where even human\nevaluators may find the distinctions challenging. Furthermore, we conduct an\nin-depth analysis of failure modes across various types of systems,\ndemonstrating that the current retrieval-augmented framework should not be seen\nas a de facto solution for personalization tasks. All benchmark data,\nannotation protocols, and the evaluation pipeline will be publicly available to\nfacilitate future research on LLM personalization.",

    "abstract": "Several continuous dynamical systems have recently been proposed as\nspecial-purpose analog computers designed to solve combinatorial optimization\nproblems such as $k$-SAT or the Ising problem. While combinatorial optimization\nproblems are known to be NP-hard, and thus scale, in the worst case,\nexponentially with the problem size, these analog solvers promise substantial\nspeed-up and scaling advantages in finding the solution. The underlying\nalgorithms, which can be cast in the form of differential equations,\ngenerically involve highly chaotic dynamics and thus assume that the system\nvariables can be processed with, in principle, arbitrary precision. However,\nboth actual physical systems as well as finite digital machines, which are used\nto virtually emulate the dynamics, can process the evolution only with finite\nprecision, be it because of intrinsic noise or because of limited precision in\nnumber representation. We investigate the impact of such noise on the\nsolution-finding capability. To this end, we focus on two representative analog\nsolvers, designed to address the Ising problem and the $k$-SAT problem,\nrespectively. Our numerical analysis reveals that the ability of these\nalgorithms to find solutions exhibits a threshold behavior under the addition\nof noise, where the solution-finding capability remains mostly uncompromised\nbelow a noise threshold, while it rapidly deteriorates above the threshold. As\nwe show, these noise tolerance thresholds decrease with the problem size,\nfollowing an approximate algebraic scaling. This allows us to infer principal\nlimits on the problem sizes that can be efficiently tackled with these solvers\nunder given noise levels.",

    "abstract": "Instruction-based image editing, which aims to modify the image faithfully\naccording to the instruction while preserving irrelevant content unchanged, has\nmade significant progress. However, there still lacks a comprehensive metric\nfor assessing the editing quality. Existing metrics either require high human\nevaluation costs, which hinder large-scale evaluation, or are adapted from\nother tasks and lose task-specific concerns, failing to comprehensively\nevaluate both instruction-based modification and preservation of irrelevant\nregions, resulting in biased evaluation. To tackle this, we introduce a new\nmetric called Balancing Preservation and Modification (BPM), tailored for\ninstruction-based image editing by explicitly disentangling the image into\nediting-relevant and irrelevant regions for specific consideration. We first\nidentify and locate editing-relevant regions, followed by a two-tier process to\nassess editing quality: Region-Aware Judge evaluates whether the position and\nsize of the edited region align with the instruction, and Semantic-Aware Judge\nfurther assesses the instruction content compliance within editing-relevant\nregions as well as content preservation within irrelevant regions, yielding\ncomprehensive and interpretable quality assessment. Moreover, the\nediting-relevant region localization in BPM can be integrated into image\nediting approaches to improve editing quality, demonstrating its broad\napplicability. We verify the effectiveness of the BPM metric on comprehensive\ninstruction-editing data, and the results show the highest alignment with human\nevaluation compared to existing metrics, indicating its efficacy.

Unfortunately, there is no\nprincipled approach to identify when jailbreaks will transfer from a source\nmodel to a target model. In this work, we observe that transfer success from a\nsource model to a target model depends on quantifiable measures of both\njailbreak strength with respect to the source model and the contextual\nrepresentation similarity of the two models. Furthermore, we show\ntransferability can be increased by distilling from the target model into the\nsource model where the only target model responses used to train the source\nmodel are those to benign prompts. We show that the distilled source model can\nact as a surrogate for the target model, yielding more transferable attacks\nagainst the target model. These results suggest that the success of jailbreaks\nis not merely due to exploitation of safety training failing to generalize\nout-of-distribution, but instead a consequence of a more fundamental flaw in\ncontextual representations computed by models.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of multi-agent distributed optimization (MA-DO)\ntheory over the past decade, the distributed stochastic gradient method (DSGM)\noccupies an important position. Although the theory of different DSGMs has been\nwidely established, the main-stream results of existing work are still derived\nunder the condition of light-tailed stochastic gradient noises. Increasing\nrecent examples from various fields, indicate that, the light-tailed noise\nmodel is overly idealized in many practical instances, failing to capture the\ncomplexity and variability of noises in real-world scenarios, such as the\npresence of outliers or extreme values from data science and statistical\nlearning. To address this issue, we propose a new DSGM framework that\nincorporates stochastic gradients under sub-Weibull randomness. We study a\ndistributed composite stochastic mirror descent scheme with sub-Weibull\ngradient noise (DCSMD-SW) for solving a distributed composite optimization\n(DCO) problem over the time-varying multi-agent network. By investigating\nsub-Weibull randomness in DCSMD for the first time, we show that the algorithm\nis applicable in common heavy-tailed noise environments while also guaranteeing\ngood convergence properties. We comprehensively study the convergence\nperformance of DCSMD-SW. Satisfactory high probability convergence rates are\nderived for DCSMD-SW without any smoothness requirement. The work also offers a\nunified analysis framework for several critical cases of both algorithms and\nnoise environments.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a geometric multigrid preconditioner for the Shifted\nBoundary Method (SBM) designed to solve PDEs on complex geometries. While SBM\nsimplifies mesh generation by using a non-conforming background grid, it often\nresults in non-symmetric and potentially ill-conditioned linear systems that\nare challenging to solve efficiently. Standard multigrid methods with pointwise\nsmoothers prove ineffective for such systems due to the localized perturbations\nintroduced by the shifted boundary conditions. To address this challenge, we\nintroduce a Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) formulation for SBM that enables the\ndesign of a cell-wise multiplicative smoother within an $hp$-multigrid\nframework. The element-local nature of DG methods naturally facilitates\ncell-wise correction, which can effectively handle the local complexities\narising from the boundary treatment. Numerical results for the Poisson equation\ndemonstrate favorable performance with mesh refinement for linear ($p=1$) and\nquadratic ($p=2$) elements in both 2D and 3D, with iteration counts showing\nmild growth. However, challenges emerge for cubic ($p=3$) elements,\nparticularly in 3D, where the current smoother shows reduced effectiveness.",

When handling videos,\nmapping compact inputs to entire frames or spatially partitioned patch images\nis an effective approach. This strategy better preserves spatial relationships,\nreduces computational overhead, and improves reconstruction quality compared to\ncoordinate-based mapping. However, predicting entire frames often limits the\nreconstruction of high-frequency visual details. Additionally, conventional\npatch-based approaches based on uniform spatial partitioning tend to introduce\nboundary discontinuities that degrade spatial coherence.

    "abstract": "Normalization is a critical yet often overlooked component in the\npreprocessing pipeline for EEG deep learning applications. The rise of\nlarge-scale pretraining paradigms such as self-supervised learning (SSL)\nintroduces a new set of tasks whose nature is substantially different from\nsupervised training common in EEG deep learning applications. This raises new\nquestions about optimal normalization strategies for the applicable task. In\nthis study, we systematically evaluate the impact of normalization granularity\n(recording vs. window level) and scope (cross-channel vs. within-channel) on\nboth supervised (age and gender prediction) and self-supervised (Contrastive\nPredictive Coding) tasks. Using high-density resting-state EEG from 2,836\nsubjects in the Healthy Brain Network dataset, we show that optimal\nnormalization strategies differ significantly between training paradigms.\nWindow-level within-channel normalization yields the best performance in\nsupervised tasks, while minimal or cross-channel normalization at the window\nlevel is more effective for SSL. These results underscore the necessity of\ntask-specific normalization choices and challenge the assumption that a\nuniversal normalization strategy can generalize across learning settings. Our\nfindings provide practical insights for developing robust EEG deep learning\npipelines as the field shifts toward large-scale, foundation model training.",

This requires an analysis of massive states,\nwhich reveals a picture that is more intricate than the well-known situation on\nthe torus. It involves towers of states of different quantum numbers, related\nby modular transformations. Members of different towers become massless at\ndifferent points in moduli space. We also show that, at least in the Z_3\norbifold, the string selection rules can be understood as discrete remnants of\ncontinuous gauge symmetries. Non-Abelian discrete flavor symmetries arise as\nrelics of various, relatively misaligned, continuous Abelian gauge symmetries.\nThe generators of these U(1) symmetries give rise to CP-violating\nClebsch-Gordan coefficients.

This hampers real-world\napplicability in scenarios where current-year labels are unavailable. In\naddition, uncertainty quantification is often overlooked, which reduces the\nreliability of such approaches for operational crop monitoring. Inspired by\necophysiological principles of plant growth, we propose a simple,\nmodel-agnostic Thermal-Time-based Temporal Sampling (T3S) method that replaces\ncalendar time with thermal time. By subsampling time series in this\nbiologically meaningful way, our method highlights key periods within the\ngrowing season while reducing temporal redundancy and noise. We evaluate the\nT3S on a multi-year Sentinel-2 dataset covering the entirety of Switzerland,\nwhich allows us to assess all applied methods on unseen years. Compared to\nstate-of-the-art baselines, our approach yields substantial improvements in\nclassification accuracy and, critically, provides well-calibrated uncertainty\nestimates. Moreover, the T3S method excels in low-data regimes and enables\nsignificantly more accurate early-season classification.

A major limitation\nof current FHE schemes is their high runtime overhead. As a result, automatic\noptimization of circuits describing FHE computation has garnered significant\nattention in the logic synthesis community. Existing works primarily target the\nmultiplicative depth (MD) and multiplicative complexity (MC) of FHE circuits,\ncorresponding to the total number of multiplications and maximum number of\nmultiplications in a path from primary input to output, respectively. In many\nFHE schemes, these metrics are the primary contributors to the homomorphic\nevaluation runtime of a circuit. However, oftentimes they are opposed: reducing\neither depth or complexity may result in an increase in the other. To our\nknowledge, existing works have yet to optimize FHE circuits for overall\nruntime, only considering one metric at a time and thus making significant\ntradeoffs. In this paper, we use e-graphs to augment existing flows that\nindividually optimize MC and MD, in a technique called cut tracing. We show how\ncut tracing can effectively combine two state-of-the-art MC and MD reduction\nflows and balance their weaknesses to minimize runtime.

    "abstract": "We study the evolution of a general class of stochastic processes\n(containing, e.g. SIS and SIR models) on large random networks, focusing on a\nparticular general class of random graph models. To approximate the expected\ndynamics of these processes, we employ a mean-field technique known as the\nN-Intertwined Mean-Field Approximation (NIMFA). Our primary goal is to quantify\nthe impact of the randomness in the network topology on the accuracy of such\napproximations. While classical work by Kurtz established strong approximation\nresults for density-dependent Markov chains using mean-field on the\ncomplete-graph of order $N$, yielding error bounds of order\n$\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}}$, we demonstrate that in the context of NIMFA on random\ngraphs, the error admits a refined characterization depending on initial\nconditions. Specifically, for generic initial conditions, the worst case error\nis of order $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}}$, where $d$ is the expected average degree of\nthe graph. This result highlights how network sparsity contributes an\nadditional source of variability not captured by classical mean-field\napproaches. Furthermore, when the initial conditions are taken to be fairly\nhomogeneous, we show that the error term is of order\n$\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}}+\\frac{1}{d}$, where $N$ is the number of nodes,\nunderscoring the intricate role of the choice of initial conditions in the\nerror bounds. Our analysis connects with recent interest in quantifying the\nrole of graph heterogeneity in epidemic thresholds and dynamics.",

However, existing models remain highly\nvulnerable to adversarial attacks: imperceptible noise added to forged images\ncan severely mislead these models. In this paper, we address this challenge\nwith an Adversarial Noise Suppression Module (ANSM) that generate a defensive\nperturbation to suppress the attack effect of adversarial noise. We observe\nthat forgery-relevant features extracted from adversarial and original forged\nimages exhibit distinct distributions. To bridge this gap, we introduce\nForgery-relevant Features Alignment (FFA) as a first-stage training strategy,\nwhich reduces distributional discrepancies by minimizing the channel-wise\nKullback-Leibler divergence between these features. To further refine the\ndefensive perturbation, we design a second-stage training strategy, termed\nMask-guided Refinement (MgR), which incorporates a dual-mask constraint. MgR\nensures that the perturbation remains effective for both adversarial and\noriginal forged images, recovering forgery localization accuracy to their\noriginal level. Extensive experiments across various attack algorithms\ndemonstrate that our method significantly restores the forgery localization\nmodel's performance on adversarial images. Notably, when ANSM is applied to\noriginal forged images, the performance remains nearly unaffected. To our best\nknowledge, this is the first report of adversarial defense in image forgery\nlocalization tasks. We have released the source code and anti-forensics\ndataset.",

The\nmass formula reproduces all measured lepton, quark, meson and baryon masses to\nbetter than 0.1% and resolves the long-standing bottom-quark anomaly via a\nnaturally emerging recognition boundary at $n \\approx 60.7$. RS also predicts\nconcrete and testable masses for yet-undiscovered states.",

However, the number of degrees of\nfreedom of a LON is far fewer than the dimensionality of the multi-photon\nmulti-mode Fock space, therefore it cannot implement arbitrary unitary\nevolutions on multi-photon states. Understanding these intrinsic constraints is\nessential for the preparation, manipulation, and measurement of multi-photon\nstates with LONs. Although several properties of the multi-photon state have\nbeen shown to be invariant under LON unitary evolution, their physical\ninterpretation remains elusive. Here, we introduce a Hermitian transfer matrix\napproach to explore the multi-photon evolution, revealing that the overall\nstate purity decomposes into three distinct invariants -- each arising from\neither single-photon dynamics or the multi-photon interference. We\nexperimentally observe these purity-like invariants by preparing distinct\ninitial states, applying LON unitaries, and measuring the resulting invariants.\nOur results not only confirm their conservation but also provide valuable\ninsights into multi-photon state evolution in linear optics.",

    "abstract": "This work explores the connection between differential privacy (DP) and\nonline learning in the context of PAC list learning. In this setting, a\n$k$-list learner outputs a list of $k$ potential predictions for an instance\n$x$ and incurs a loss if the true label of $x$ is not included in the list. A\nbasic result in the multiclass PAC framework with a finite number of labels\nstates that private learnability is equivalent to online learnability [Alon,\nLivni, Malliaris, and Moran (2019); Bun, Livni, and Moran (2020); Jung, Kim,\nand Tewari (2020)]. Perhaps surprisingly, we show that this equivalence does\nnot hold in the context of list learning. Specifically, we prove that, unlike\nin the multiclass setting, a finite $k$-Littlestone dimensio--a variant of the\nclassical Littlestone dimension that characterizes online $k$-list\nlearnability--is not a sufficient condition for DP $k$-list learnability.\nHowever, similar to the multiclass case, we prove that it remains a necessary\ncondition.\n  To demonstrate where the equivalence breaks down, we provide an example\nshowing that the class of monotone functions with $k+1$ labels over\n$\\mathbb{N}$ is online $k$-list learnable, but not DP $k$-list learnable. This\nleads us to introduce a new combinatorial dimension, the \\emph{$k$-monotone\ndimension}, which serves as a generalization of the threshold dimension. Unlike\nthe multiclass setting, where the Littlestone and threshold dimensions are\nfinite together, for $k>1$, the $k$-Littlestone and $k$-monotone dimensions do\nnot exhibit this relationship. We prove that a finite $k$-monotone dimension is\nanother necessary condition for DP $k$-list learnability, alongside finite\n$k$-Littlestone dimension. Whether the finiteness of both dimensions implies\nprivate $k$-list learnability remains an open question.",

Directly prompting MLLMs to perform this complex\ntask often yields unsatisfactory results. To address this challenge, we propose\n{ChartIR}, an iterative refinement method based on structured instruction.\nFirst, we distinguish two tasks: visual understanding and code translation. To\naccomplish the visual understanding component, we design two types of\nstructured instructions: description and difference. The description\ninstruction captures the visual elements of the reference chart, while the\ndifference instruction characterizes the discrepancies between the reference\nchart and the generated chart. These instructions effectively transform visual\nfeatures into language representations, thereby facilitating the subsequent\ncode translation process. Second, we decompose the overall chart generation\npipeline into two stages: initial code generation and iterative refinement,\nenabling progressive enhancement of the final output. Experimental results show\nthat, compared to other method, our method achieves superior performance on\nboth the open-source model Qwen2-VL and the closed-source model GPT-4o.",

Our method achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 67.01\\% on\nthe iMiGUE test set. As a result of these contributions, our approach ranks\nthird on the official MiGA Challenge leaderboard.

    "abstract": "Digital human video generation is gaining traction in fields like education\nand e-commerce, driven by advancements in head-body animation and lip-syncing\ntechnologies. However, realistic Hand-Object Interaction (HOI) - the complex\ndynamics between human hands and objects - continues to pose challenges.\nGenerating natural and believable HOI reenactments is difficult due to issues\nsuch as occlusion between hands and objects, variations in object shapes and\norientations, and the necessity for precise physical interactions, and\nimportantly, the ability to generalize to unseen humans and objects. This paper\npresents a novel framework iDiT-HOI that enables in-the-wild HOI reenactment\ngeneration. Specifically, we propose a unified inpainting-based token process\nmethod, called Inp-TPU, with a two-stage video diffusion transformer (DiT)\nmodel. The first stage generates a key frame by inserting the designated object\ninto the hand region, providing a reference for subsequent frames. The second\nstage ensures temporal coherence and fluidity in hand-object interactions. The\nkey contribution of our method is to reuse the pretrained model's context\nperception capabilities without introducing additional parameters, enabling\nstrong generalization to unseen objects and scenarios, and our proposed\nparadigm naturally supports long video generation. Comprehensive evaluations\ndemonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods, particularly in\nchallenging real-world scenes, offering enhanced realism and more seamless\nhand-object interactions.",

However, it also brings new threats and challenges. The\nadvancement of model inversion attacks has rendered the plaintext transmission\nof local models insecure, while the distributed nature of federated learning\nmakes it particularly vulnerable to attacks raised by malicious clients. To\nprotect data privacy and prevent malicious client attacks, this paper proposes\na privacy-preserving federated learning framework based on verifiable\nfunctional encryption, without a non-colluding dual-server setup or additional\ntrusted third-party. Specifically, we propose a novel decentralized verifiable\nfunctional encryption (DVFE) scheme that enables the verification of specific\nrelationships over multi-dimensional ciphertexts. This scheme is formally\ntreated, in terms of definition, security model and security proof.\nFurthermore, based on the proposed DVFE scheme, we design a privacy-preserving\nfederated learning framework VFEFL that incorporates a novel robust aggregation\nrule to detect malicious clients, enabling the effective training of\nhigh-accuracy models under adversarial settings. Finally, we provide formal\nanalysis and empirical evaluation of the proposed schemes.

The literature lacks\nefficient relaxations to produce tight lower bounds on the optimal objective\nvalue of the RWAP-PPP. Consequently, the solution quality for the RWAP-PPP\ncannot be properly assessed, which is critical for telecommunication providers\nin customer bidding and service improvement. Due to numerous failure scenarios,\ndeveloping effective lower bounds for the RWAP-PPP is challenging. To address\nthis, we formulate and analyze various linear programming (LP) relaxations of\nthe RWAP-PPP. Among them, we propose a novel LP relaxation yielding promising\nlower bounds. To solve it, we develop a Benders decomposition algorithm with\nvalid inequalities to enhance performance. Computational results on practical\nnetworks, including large ones with hundreds of nodes and edges, demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of the LP relaxation and efficiency of its algorithm.

Of 107 detected clusters,\ntwo correspond to previously unidentified VHE sources: weak BL Lacertae objects\n4FGL J0039.1-2219 and 4FGL J0212.2-0219, promising targets for next-generation\nVHE observatories. Due to low VHE photon background, even doublets with a\nduration of several days exhibited high statistical significance. While most of\nthe 114 detected doublets originated from bright TeV emitters (e.g., Mrk 421,\nMrk 501), we identified six VHE flares lacking TeVCat associations. Five of\nthese flares correlate with sources from the Third Catalog of Fermi-LAT\nHigh-Energy Sources (3FHL), while one 'orphan' flare lacks a high-energy (HE;\n$E > 10$ GeV) source counterpart. Some of these flares reached extreme\nluminosities of $\\mathcal{O}(10^{47} \\mathrm{erg~s^{-1}})$. No consistent\ntemporal correlation emerged between HE and VHE activity: HE flares preceded,\ncoincided with, or followed VHE emission across sources, with some showing no\nHE counterpart. Remarkably, 3FHL J0308.4+0408 (NGC 1218) is a Seyfert Type I\ngalaxy, while no object of this class was known VHE emitter before. The\n'orphan' flare without any known HE source in the vicinity may originate from\nNGC 5549, a low-luminosity LINER galaxy. Both sources expand the limited sample\nof non-blazar AGN detected at VHE energies.",

    "abstract": "As Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate increasing capabilities across\nreal-world applications such as code generation and chatbot assistance,\nensuring their safety has become paramount. Unlike traditional Large Language\nModels (LLMs), VLMs face unique vulnerabilities due to their multimodal nature,\nallowing adversaries to modify visual or textual inputs to bypass safety\nguardrails and trigger the generation of harmful content. Through systematic\nanalysis of VLM behavior under attack, we identify a novel phenomenon termed\n``delayed safety awareness''. Specifically, we observe that safety-aligned VLMs\nmay initially be compromised to produce harmful content, but eventually\nrecognize the associated risks and attempt to self-correct. This pattern\nsuggests that VLMs retain their underlying safety awareness but experience a\ntemporal delay in their activation. Building on this insight, we hypothesize\nthat VLMs' safety awareness can be proactively reactivated through carefully\ndesigned prompts. To this end, we introduce ``The Safety Reminder'', a soft\nprompt tuning approach that optimizes learnable prompt tokens, which are\nperiodically injected during the text generation process to enhance safety\nawareness, effectively preventing harmful content generation. Additionally, our\nsafety reminder only activates when harmful content is detected, leaving normal\nconversations unaffected and preserving the model's performance on benign\ntasks. Through comprehensive evaluation across three established safety\nbenchmarks and one adversarial attacks, we demonstrate that our approach\nsignificantly reduces attack success rates while maintaining model utility,\noffering a practical solution for deploying safer VLMs in real-world\napplications.",

We solve this coupled system (Lyman-$\\alpha$-HI system along with X-ray\nheating) for a period of 500 Myr (redshift range $8 <z < 25$). Our main results\nare: (a) without X-ray heating, the temperature of the gas reaches an\nequilibrium which is nearly independent of photon intensity and only weakly\ndependent on the expansion of the universe. The main determinant of the\nquasi-static temperature is the ratio of injected and continuum Lyman-$\\alpha$\nphotons, (b) while X-ray photons provide an additional source of heating at\ninitial times, for large enough Lyman-$\\alpha$ photon intensity, the system\ntends to reach the same quasi-static temperature as expected without additional\nheating. This limit is reached when the density of photons close to the\nLyman-$\\alpha$ resonance far exceeds the HI number density, (c) we compute the\nglobal HI signal for these scenarios. In the limit of the large density of\nLyman-$\\alpha$ photons, the spin temperature of the hyperfine line is fixed.\nThis freezes the global HI signal from the era of cosmic dawn and the\ncross-over redshift from absorption to emission.

However, poor implementation\npractices can lead to unintended consequences, particularly in socioeconomic\ncontexts where externalities (costs or benefits to third parties outside the\noptimization process) are significant. To propose solutions, it is crucial to\nfirst characterize involved stakeholders, their goals, and the types of subpar\npractices causing unforeseen outcomes. This task is complex because affected\nstakeholders often fall outside the direct focus of optimization processes.\nAlso, incorporating these externalities into optimization requires going beyond\ntraditional economic frameworks, which often focus on describing externalities\nbut fail to address their normative implications or interconnected nature, and\nfeedback loops. This paper suggests a framework that combines systems thinking\nwith the economic concept of externalities to tackle these challenges. This\napproach aims to characterize what went wrong, who was affected, and how (or\nwhere) to include them in the optimization process. Economic externalities,\nalong with their established quantification methods, assist in identifying \"who\nwas affected and how\" through stakeholder characterization. Meanwhile, systems\nthinking (an analytical approach to comprehending relationships in complex\nsystems) provides a holistic, normative perspective. Systems thinking\ncontributes to an understanding of interconnections among externalities,\nfeedback loops, and determining \"when\" to incorporate them in the optimization.\nTogether, these approaches create a comprehensive framework for addressing\noptimization's unintended consequences, balancing descriptive accuracy with\nnormative objectives.

When given a\ncomputationally expensive high-order prediction model, a reduction to a\nlower-order simplified model can enable such real-time applications. Herein, we\nreview state-of-the-art nonlinear model order reduction methods and provide a\ntheoretical comparison of method properties. Additionally, we discuss both\ngeneral-purpose methods and tailored approaches for (chemical) process systems\nand we identify similarities and differences between these methods. As\nmanifold-Galerkin approaches currently do not account for inputs in the\nconstruction of the reduced state subspace, we extend these methods to\ndynamical systems with inputs. In a comparative case study, we apply eight\nestablished model order reduction methods to an air separation process model:\nPOD-Galerkin, nonlinear-POD-Galerkin, manifold-Galerkin, dynamic mode\ndecomposition, Koopman theory, manifold learning with latent predictor,\ncompartment modeling, and model aggregation.

    "abstract": "Bayesian optimization (BO) has traditionally solved black box problems where\nevaluation is expensive and, therefore, design-evaluation pairs (i.e.,\nobservations) are few. Recently, there has been growing interest in applying BO\nto problems where evaluation is cheaper and, thus, observations are more\nplentiful. An impediment to scaling BO to many observations, $N$, is the\n$O(N^3)$ scaling of a na{\\\"i}ve query of the Gaussian process (GP) surrogate.\nModern implementations reduce this to $O(N^2)$, but the GP remains a\nbottleneck. We propose Epistemic Nearest Neighbors (ENN), a surrogate that\nestimates function values and epistemic uncertainty from $K$ nearest-neighbor\nobservations. ENN has $O(N)$ query time and omits hyperparameter fitting,\nleaving uncertainty uncalibrated. To accommodate the lack of calibration, we\nemploy an acquisition method based on Pareto-optimal tradeoffs between\npredicted value and uncertainty. Our proposed method, TuRBO-ENN, replaces the\nGP surrogate in TuRBO with ENN and its Thompson sampling acquisition method\nwith our Pareto-based alternative. We demonstrate numerically that TuRBO-ENN\ncan reduce the time to generate proposals by one to two orders of magnitude\ncompared to TuRBO and scales to thousands of observations.",

We find that\nexisting backdoor attacks in reinforcement learning are based on reward\nmanipulation, which are largely ineffective against the TO model due to its\ninherent sequence modeling nature. Moreover, the complexities introduced by\nhigh-dimensional action spaces further compound the challenge of action\nmanipulation. To address these gaps, we propose TrojanTO, the first\naction-level backdoor attack against TO models. TrojanTO employs alternating\ntraining to enhance the connection between triggers and target actions for\nattack effectiveness. To improve attack stealth, it utilizes precise poisoning\nvia trajectory filtering for normal performance and batch poisoning for trigger\nconsistency. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that TrojanTO effectively\nimplants backdoor attacks across diverse tasks and attack objectives with a low\nattack budget (0.3\\% of trajectories).

Recently, ferroelectricity has been\ndemonstrated in semiconducting halide perovskites, offering both a rare\ncombination of ferroelectricity and semiconductivity in the same material and a\npossible alternative to the prevailing perovskite oxide ferroelectrics. We\npropose a route to simulating such materials at finite temperatures capable of\nreproducing key experimental and first-principle data, such as Curie\ntemperature, phase transition sequence, spontaneous polarization, and soft mode\nfrequencies. The key methodological finding is the superior performance of\nhybrid exchange correlation functionals in parametrization of effective\nHamiltonians for ferroelectrics with lone pair. The parametrization for\neffective Hamiltonians for CsGeX$_3$, (X=Cl, Br, I) is reported. The\napplication of methodology to study polarization reversal in CsGeX$_3$, allows\nfor the development of a ``minimalistic\" model for polarization reversal in\nferroelectrics that provides an insight into the mechanisms of polarization\nreversal and its key features, such as the relationship between the coercive\nfield, temperature, and AC field frequency. Importantly, the model reveals the\norigin of the well-known and ever-puzzling overestimation of coercive fields in\ncomputations.

Flow-based generative models offer such potential,\nexcelling at capturing complex, multimodal action distributions. However, their\ndirect application in online RL is challenging due to a fundamental objective\nmismatch: standard flow training optimizes for static data imitation, while RL\nrequires value-based policy optimization through a dynamic buffer, leading to\ndifficult optimization landscapes. FlowRL first models policies via a\nstate-dependent velocity field, generating actions through deterministic ODE\nintegration from noise. We derive a constrained policy search objective that\njointly maximizes Q through the flow policy while bounding the Wasserstein-2\ndistance to a behavior-optimal policy implicitly derived from the replay\nbuffer.

    "abstract": "Constraining the chemical structure of exoplanetary atmospheres is pivotal\nfor interpreting spectroscopic data and understanding planetary evolution.\nTraditional retrieval methods often assume thermochemical equilibrium or free\nprofiles, which may fail to capture disequilibrium processes like\nphotodissociation and vertical mixing. This study leverages the TauREx 3.1\nretrieval framework coupled with FRECKLL, a disequilibrium chemistry model, to\naddress these challenges. The study aims to (1) assess the impact of\ndisequilibrium chemistry on constraining metallicity and C/O ratios; (2)\nevaluate the role of refractory species (TiO and VO) in spectral retrievals;\n(3) explore consistency between transit and eclipse observations for\ntemperature and chemical profiles; and (4) determine the effects of retrieval\npriors and data reduction methods. Ten hot-Jupiter atmospheres were reanalyzed\nusing Hubble Space Telescope (HST) WFC3 data in eclipse and transit. The\nTauREx-FRECKLL model incorporated disequilibrium chemistry calculations with a\nBayesian framework to infer atmospheric properties. The disequilibrium approach\nsignificantly altered retrieved metallicity and C/O ratios compared to\nequilibrium models, impacting planet formation insights. Retrievals reconciled\ntransit and eclipse temperature profiles in deeper atmospheric layers but not\nin upper layers. Results were highly dependent on spectral resolution and\nretrieval priors, emphasizing limitations of HST data and the need for broader\nspectral coverage from instruments like JWST. This study demonstrates the\nfeasibility and importance of incorporating disequilibrium chemistry in\natmospheric retrievals, highlighting its potential for advancing our\nunderstanding of exoplanetary atmospheres with next-generation telescopes.",

While neural systems rely on neuron-based sensory processing\nand evaluation, decision-making also occurs in organisms without a centralized\norganizing unit, such as the unicellular slime mold \\textit{Physarum\npolycephalum}. Unlike neural systems, P. polycephalum relies on rhythmic\nperistaltic contractions to drive internal flows and redistribute mass,\nallowing it to adapt to its environment. However, while previous studies have\nfocused on the outcomes of these decisions, the underlying mechanical\nprinciples that govern this mass relocation remain unknown. Here, we\ninvestigate the exploration process of P. polycephalum confined by blue light\ninto polygonal shapes up to its escape. While the escape occurs along the\nlongest axis of the polygones, independent of confinement shape, the\nexploration process prior to escape extends protrusions almost everywhere\naround a shape boundary. We find protrusions to align with the direction of\nperistaltic contraction waves driving mass relocation. Mapping out contraction\nmodes during exploration in detail we observe an ongoing switching between\ndifferent dominant principle contraction modes. Only over the course of time\ndoes the organism ultimately settle on the contraction mode most efficient for\ntransport, which coincides with the escape. Thus, we find that only harsh\nenvironmental confinement triggers optimal behaviour which is reached by long\ntime re-organization of the flow patterns.

In the case of the polyharmonic operator of\norder $2m$ we derive precise bounds yielding the first two terms in the\nasymptotic expansion for the first normalised eigenvalue as $m$ grows to\ninfinity. These results allow us to obtain the order of growth for the $k^{\\rm\nth}$ polyharmonic eigenvalue on general domains.",

    "abstract": "Scientific machine learning often involves representing complex solution\nfields that exhibit high-frequency features such as sharp transitions,\nfine-scale oscillations, and localized structures. While implicit neural\nrepresentations (INRs) have shown promise for continuous function modeling,\ncapturing such high-frequency behavior remains a challenge-especially when\nmodeling multiple solution fields with a shared network. Prior work addressing\nspectral bias in INRs has primarily focused on single-instance settings,\nlimiting scalability and generalization. In this work, we propose Global\nFourier Modulation (GFM), a novel modulation technique that injects\nhigh-frequency information at each layer of the INR through Fourier-based\nreparameterization. This enables compact and accurate representation of\nmultiple solution fields using low-dimensional latent vectors. Building upon\nGFM, we introduce PDEfuncta, a meta-learning framework designed to learn\nmulti-modal solution fields and support generalization to new tasks. Through\nempirical studies on diverse scientific problems, we demonstrate that our\nmethod not only improves representational quality but also shows potential for\nforward and inverse inference tasks without the need for retraining.",

Traditional approaches, which rely on empirical formulas or\nphysical simulations, often suffer from limited accuracy or require strong\nscene priors. Recent neural radiance field (NeRF-based) methods improve\nreconstruction fidelity through differentiable volumetric rendering, but their\nreliance on computationally expensive multilayer perceptron (MLP) queries\nhinders real-time deployment. To overcome these challenges, we introduce\nGaussian splatting (GS) to the wireless domain, leveraging its efficiency in\nmodeling optical radiance fields to enable compact and accurate WRF\nreconstruction. Specifically, we propose SwiftWRF, a deformable 2D Gaussian\nsplatting framework that synthesizes WRF spectra at arbitrary positions under\nsingle-sided transceiver mobility. SwiftWRF employs CUDA-accelerated\nrasterization to render spectra at over 100000 fps and uses a lightweight MLP\nto model the deformation of 2D Gaussians, effectively capturing\nmobility-induced WRF variations. In addition to novel spectrum synthesis, the\nefficacy of SwiftWRF is further underscored in its applications in\nangle-of-arrival (AoA) and received signal strength indicator (RSSI)\nprediction.

      "Hyeonuk Nam"
    ],
    "abstract": "Recent research in deep learning-based Sound Event Detection (SED) has\nprimarily focused on Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks (CRNNs) and\nTransformer models. However, conventional 2D convolution-based models assume\nshift invariance along both the temporal and frequency axes, leadin to\ninconsistencies when dealing with frequency-dependent characteristics of\nacoustic signals. To address this issue, this study proposes Frequency Dynamic\nConvolution (FDY conv), which dynamically adjusts convolutional kernels based\non the frequency composition of the input signal to enhance SED performance.\nFDY conv constructs an optimal frequency response by adaptively weighting\nmultiple basis kernels based on frequency-specific attention weights.\nExperimental results show that applying FDY conv to CRNNs improves performance\non the DESED dataset by 7.56% compared to the baseline CRNN. However, FDY conv\nhas limitations in that it combines basis kernels of the same shape across all\nfrequencies, restricting its ability to capture diverse frequency-specific\ncharacteristics. Additionally, the $3\\times3$ basis kernel size is insufficient\nto capture a broader frequency range. To overcome these limitations, this study\nintroduces an extended family of FDY conv models. Dilated FDY conv (DFD conv)\napplies convolutional kernels with various dilation rates to expand the\nreceptive field along the frequency axis and enhance frequency-specific feature\nrepresentation. Experimental results show that DFD conv improves performance by\n9.27% over the baseline. Partial FDY conv (PFD conv) addresses the high\ncomputational cost of FDY conv, which results from performing all convolution\noperations with dynamic kernels. Since FDY conv may introduce unnecessary\nadaptivity for quasi-stationary sound events, PFD conv integrates standard 2D\nconvolutions with frequency-adaptive kernels to reduce computational complexity\nwhile maintaining performance. Experimental results demonstrate that PFD conv\nimproves performance by 7.80% over the baseline while reducing the number of\nparameters by 54.4% compared to FDY conv. Multi-Dilated FDY conv (MDFD conv)\nextends DFD conv by addressing its structural limitation of applying the same\ndilation across all frequencies. By utilizing multiple convolutional kernels\nwith different dilation rates, MDFD conv effectively captures diverse\nfrequency-dependent patterns. Experimental results indicate that MDFD conv\nachieves the highest performance, improving the baseline CRNN performance by\n10.98%. Furthermore, standard FDY conv employs Temporal Average Pooling, which\nassigns equal weight to all frames along the time axis, limiting its ability to\neffectively capture transient events. To overcome this, this study proposes\nTAP-FDY conv (TFD conv), which integrates Temporal Attention Pooling (TA) that\nfocuses on salient features, Velocity Attention Pooling (VA) that emphasizes\ntransient characteristics, and Average Pooling (AP) that captures stationary\nproperties. TAP-FDY conv achieves the same performance as MDFD conv but reduces\nthe number of parameters by approximately 30.01% (12.703M vs. 18.157M),\nachieving equivalent accuracy with lower computational complexity. Class-wise\nperformance analysis reveals that FDY conv improves detection of non-stationary\nevents, DFD conv is particularly effective for events with broad spectral\nfeatures, and PFD conv enhances the detection of quasi-stationary events.\nAdditionally, TFD conv (TFD-CRNN) demonstrates strong performance in detecting\ntransient events. In the case studies, PFD conv effectively captures stable\nsignal patterns in tank powertrain fault recognition, DFD conv recognizes wide\nharmonic spectral patterns on speed-varying motor fault recognition, while TFD\nconv outperforms other models in detecting transient signals in offshore arc\ndetection. These results suggest that frequency-adaptive convolutions and their\nextended variants provide a robust alternative to conventional 2D convolutions\nin deep learning-based audio processing.",

However, it still faces some problems, such as\nthe lack of prior knowledge, which seriously affects detection accuracy. In\norder to solve this problem, we propose a scene-aware SAR ship detection method\nbased on unsupervised sea-land segmentation. This method follows a classical\ntwo-stage framework and is enhanced by two models: the unsupervised land and\nsea segmentation module (ULSM) and the land attention suppression module\n(LASM). ULSM and LASM can adaptively guide the network to reduce attention on\nland according to the type of scenes (inshore scene and offshore scene) and add\nprior knowledge (sea land segmentation information) to the network, thereby\nreducing the network's attention to land directly and enhancing offshore\ndetection performance relatively. This increases the accuracy of ship detection\nand enhances the interpretability of the model. Specifically, in consideration\nof the lack of land sea segmentation labels in existing deep learning-based SAR\nship detection datasets, ULSM uses an unsupervised approach to classify the\ninput data scene into inshore and offshore types and performs sea-land\nsegmentation for inshore scenes. LASM uses the sea-land segmentation\ninformation as prior knowledge to reduce the network's attention to land.

Fragility is often associated with dynamic\nheterogeneity, implying that if structure influences dynamics, more fragile\nsystems should exhibit stronger structure dynamics correlations. In this study,\nwe test the generality of this assumption using: Lennard Jones (LJ) and Weeks\nChandler Andersen (WCA) systems, where fragility is tuned via density, and a\nmodified LJ (q,p) system, where fragility is varied by changing the potential\nsoftness. We define a structural order parameter based on a mean field caging\npotential and analyse energy barriers at both macroscopic and microscopic\nlevels. While the macroscopic free energy barrier slope correlates with\nfragility, the microscopic free energy barrier does not show a consistent\ntrend. Instead, it exhibits a strong correlation with a structure dynamics\ncorrelation measure obtained from isoconfigurational ensemble simulations.\nInterestingly, the two systems showing the highest structure dynamics\ncorrelation, LJ at rho = 1.1 and the (8,5) model, are respectively the least\nand most fragile within their classes. These systems exhibit broad mobility\ndistributions, large non Gaussian parameters, yet low four point\nsusceptibilities, suggesting a decoupling between spatial correlation length\nand mobility contrast. Both systems lie in the enthalpy dominated regime and\nare close to the spinodal, pointing to mechanical instability as a source of\nheterogeneity. Our results reveal that structure dynamics correlation is more\nclosely linked to the contrast in individual particle mobility than to the\nspatial extent of dynamic correlations that typically scale with fragility.",

We demonstrate\nthis by presenting and comparing two distinct Distributional Instrumental\nVariable Local Average Treatment Effect (D-IV-LATE) estimators.

    "abstract": "As blockchain technology continues to evolve and mature, smart contracts have\nbecome a key driving force behind the digitization and automation of\ntransactions. Smart contracts greatly simplify and refine the traditional\nbusiness transaction processes, and thus have had a profound impact on various\nindustries such as finance and supply chain management. However, because smart\ncontracts cannot be modified once deployed, any vulnerabilities or design flaws\nwithin the contract cannot be easily fixed, potentially leading to significant\nfinancial losses or even legal issues. The compiler, as a critical component in\nthe development process, directly affects the quality and security of smart\ncontracts. This paper innovatively proposes a method, known as the Improved\nDifferent Optimization Levels (IDOL), for testing the Solidity compiler. The\nkey idea behind IDOL is to perform reverse optimization transformations (i.e.,\nchange optimized form into unoptimized form) to generate semantically\nequivalent variants of the smart contracts under test, aiming to maximize the\nopportunities to trigger the optimization logic of compilers.

In this paper, we propose a novel\nmethodology to assess such alignment, combining (1) the F-scale, a psychometric\ntool for measuring authoritarian tendencies, (2) FavScore, a newly introduced\nmetric for evaluating model favorability toward world leaders, and (3)\nrole-model probing to assess which figures are cited as general role-models by\nLLMs. We find that LLMs generally favor democratic values and leaders, but\nexhibit increases favorability toward authoritarian figures when prompted in\nMandarin. Further, models are found to often cite authoritarian figures as role\nmodels, even outside explicit political contexts.

Modern backscatter systems are no longer simple reflectors of continuous\nwaves but are increasingly designed to interact with complex, data-carrying\nambient signals from ubiquitous sources like WiFi, ZigBee, and cellular\nnetworks. This review systematically charts the journey of ambient backscatter,\nparticularly focusing on its interaction with ZigBee and other commodity\nwireless protocols over the last decade. We analyze the progression from\nfoundational proof-of-concept systems that established productive backscatter\nto modern high-throughput, concurrent, and cross-technology communication\narchitectures. Key advancements in fine-grained modulation, robust\nsynchronization, cross-technology physical layer emulation, and multi-tag\ncoordination are detailed. A comparative analysis of state-of-the-art systems\nhighlights the core trade-offs between performance metrics like data rate and\nrange, power consumption, and compatibility with commodity hardware. Finally,\nwe synthesize the primary challenges, including networking scalability,\nsecurity vulnerabilities, the near-far problem, and practical deployment\nhurdles, and outline future research directions, such as integration with\nReconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) and 6G networks, that promise to\nfurther expand the capabilities of this transformative technology.",

    "abstract": "In modern recommender systems, CTR/CVR models are increasingly trained with\nranking objectives to improve item ranking quality. While this shift aligns\ntraining more closely with serving goals, most existing methods rely on\nin-batch negative sampling, which predominantly surfaces easy negatives. This\nlimits the model's ability to capture fine-grained user preferences and weakens\noverall ranking performance. To address this, we propose a Hierarchical\nGroup-wise Ranking Framework with two key components. First, we apply residual\nvector quantization to user embeddings to generate hierarchical user codes that\npartition users into hierarchical, trie-structured clusters. Second, we apply\nlistwise ranking losses to user-item pairs at each level of the hierarchy,\nwhere shallow levels group loosely similar users and deeper levels group highly\nsimilar users, reinforcing learning-to-rank signals through progressively\nharder negatives. Since users with similar preferences and content exposure\ntend to yield more informative negatives, applying ranking losses within these\nhierarchical user groups serves as an effective approximation of hard negative\nmining. Our approach improves ranking performance without requiring complex\nreal-time context collection or retrieval infrastructure. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that the proposed framework consistently enhances both model\ncalibration and ranking accuracy, offering a scalable and practical solution\nfor industrial recommender systems.",

In this paper, we investigate a two-phase\nhierarchical data uplink model in SAGIN. Specifically, UAVs optimize\ntrajectories to enable efficient data collection from IoT devices, and then\nthey transmit the data to LEO satellites with computing capabilities for\nfurther processing. The problem is formulated to minimize the total energy\nconsumption for IoT devices, UAVs, and LEO satellites. Since the problem is in\nthe form of mixed-integer nonlinear programming and intractable to solve\ndirectly, we decompose it into two phases. In the IoT-UAV phase, we design the\nalgorithm to jointly optimize the IoT pairing, power allocation, and UAVs\ntrajectories. Considering the high dynamic characteristics of LEO satellites, a\nreal-time LEO satellite selection mechanism joint with the Satellite Tool Kit\nis proposed in the UAV-LEO phase. Finally, simulation results show the\neffectiveness of the proposed algorithms, with about 10% less energy\nconsumption compared with the benchmark algorithm.",

    "abstract": "Inherent communication noises have the potential to preserve privacy for\nwireless federated learning (WFL) but have been overlooked in digital\ncommunication systems predominantly using floating-point number standards,\ne.g., IEEE 754, for data storage and transmission. This is due to the\npotentially catastrophic consequences of bit errors in floating-point numbers,\ne.g., on the sign or exponent bits. This paper presents a novel channel-native\nbit-flipping differential privacy (DP) mechanism tailored for WFL, where\ntransmit bits are randomly flipped and communication noises are leveraged, to\ncollectively preserve the privacy of WFL in digital communication systems. The\nkey idea is to interpret the bit perturbation at the transmitter and bit errors\ncaused by communication noises as a bit-flipping DP process. This is achieved\nby designing a new floating-point-to-fixed-point conversion method that only\ntransmits the bits in the fraction part of model parameters, hence eliminating\nthe need for transmitting the sign and exponent bits and preventing the\ncatastrophic consequence of bit errors. We analyze a new metric to measure the\nbit-level distance of the model parameters and prove that the proposed\nmechanism satisfies (\\lambda,\\epsilon)-R\\'enyi DP and does not violate the WFL\nconvergence. Experiments validate privacy and convergence analysis of the\nproposed mechanism and demonstrate its superiority to the state-of-the-art\nGaussian mechanisms that are channel-agnostic and add Gaussian noise for\nprivacy protection.",

Some previous methods inspired by dropout, which enhances\ngeneralization by regularizing features, have shown promising results in blind\nSR. Nevertheless, these methods focus solely on regularizing features before\nthe final layer and overlook the need for generalization in features at\nintermediate layers. Without explicit regularization of features at\nintermediate layers, the blind SR network struggles to obtain well-generalized\nfeature representations. However, the key challenge is that directly applying\ndropout to intermediate layers leads to a significant performance drop, which\nwe attribute to the inconsistency in training-testing and across layers it\nintroduced. Therefore, we propose Adaptive Dropout, a new regularization method\nfor blind SR models, which mitigates the inconsistency and facilitates\napplication across intermediate layers of networks.

    "abstract": "Multimodal foundation models have achieved impressive progress across a wide\nrange of vision-language tasks. However, existing approaches often adopt fixed\nor task-specific fusion strategies, neglecting the intrinsic variability of\nmodality reliability and sample complexity. In this paper, we propose\nModality-Aware Adaptive Fusion Scheduling (MA-AFS), a general framework that\nlearns to dynamically modulate the contribution of each modality on a\nper-instance basis. MA-AFS introduces a lightweight neural scheduler that\npredicts modality fusion weights by integrating visual and textual entropy\nsignals along with cross-modal agreement cues. This enables the model to\nadaptively emphasize more reliable modalities, especially under noisy, missing,\nor misaligned inputs. We formulate the fusion process as a differentiable\nscheduling mechanism, analyze its theoretical consistency and regularization\neffect, and demonstrate that it improves robustness without increasing model\ncapacity significantly. Extensive experiments on image-text retrieval,\ncaptioning, and visual question answering show that MA-AFS achieves consistent\nperformance gains over strong baselines such as CLIP, ALBEF, and BLIP.\nMoreover, MA-AFS exhibits improved robustness under modality corruption and\nenhanced generalization under domain shifts. Our work highlights the importance\nof adaptive fusion and opens a promising direction toward reliable and\nuncertainty-aware multimodal learning.",

These platforms provide designers with\naccess to manufacturing resources through a network of suppliers and have\ninstant order placement capabilities. Two key decision making levers are\ntypically used to optimize the operations of these marketplaces: pricing and\nmatching. The existing marketplaces operate in a centralized structure where\nthey have complete control over decision making. However, a decentralized\norganization of the platform enables transparency of information across clients\nand suppliers. This dissertation focuses on developing tools for decision\nmaking enabling decentralization in MaaS marketplaces. In pricing mechanisms, a\ndata driven method is introduced which enables small service providers to price\nservices based on specific attributes of the services offered. A data mining\nmethod recommends a network based price to a supplier based on its attributes\nand the attributes of other suppliers on the platform. Three different\napproaches are considered for matching mechanisms. First, a reverse auction\nmechanism is introduced where designers bid for manufacturing services and the\nmechanism chooses a supplier which can match the bid requirements and stated\nprice. The second approach uses mechanism design and mathematical programming\nto develop a stable matching mechanism for matching orders to suppliers based\non their preferences. Empirical simulations are used to test the mechanisms in\na simulated 3D printing marketplace and to evaluate the impact of stability on\nits performance. The third approach considers the matching problem in a dynamic\nand stochastic environment where demand (orders) and supply (supplier\ncapacities) arrive over time and matching is performed online.",

Here, we explore the multi-wavelength\nproperties of a sample of radio-observed optically selected TDEs to shed light\non the physical process(es) responsible for the late-rising radio emission. We\ncombine new late-time X-ray observations with archival optical, UV, X-ray, and\nradio data to conclude that a diversity of accretion-driven outflows may power\ndelayed radio emission in TDEs. Simultaneous X-ray data and modeling of the\nUV/optical emission suggest that some late radio outflows may be launched by a\ndelayed phase of super-Eddington accretion onto the central supermassive black\nhole (SMBH), while others may result from a state transition to a \"low-hard\"\nradiatively inefficient accretion flow or the deceleration of an off-axis\nrelativistic jet. We additionally find weak statistical evidence that TDEs with\ndelayed radio emission have larger optical/UV photospheric radii than other\nTDEs and are less likely to exhibit helium emission lines at early times,\npossibly also supporting the hypothesis that the onset of SMBH accretion is\ndelayed in these systems. Our results have implications for our understanding\nof state changes in SMBH accretion flows, the circularization timescale for TDE\ndebris, and the prevalence of off-axis jets in TDEs, and motivates systematic,\nlong-term monitoring of these unique transients.

Although quality Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data can enhance reasoning,\ncurrent methods face two critical flaws: (1) weak rejection sampling reduces\ndata quality, and (2) inadequate step validation causes error accumulation.\nThese limitations lead to flawed reasoning chains that impair LLMs'ability to\nlearn reliable issue resolution.

Key innovations include: (1) augmenting MCTS with a\nreflection mechanism that corrects errors via rejection sampling and\nrefinement, (2) decomposing issue resolution into three subtasks-File\nLocalization, Fault Localization, and Patch Generation-each with clear\nground-truth criteria, and (3) enforcing a strict sampling protocol where\nintermediate outputs must exactly match verified developer patches, ensuring\ncorrectness across reasoning paths.

However, their high computational cost and\nlow execution frequency hinder their suitability for real-time tasks such as\nrobotic manipulation and autonomous navigation. Existing VLA acceleration\nmethods primarily focus on structural optimization, overlooking the fact that\nthese models operate in sequential decision-making environments. As a result,\ntemporal redundancy in sequential action generation and spatial redundancy in\nvisual input remain unaddressed. To this end, we propose SP-VLA, a unified\nframework that accelerates VLA models by jointly scheduling models and pruning\ntokens. Specifically, we design an action-aware model scheduling mechanism that\nreduces temporal redundancy by dynamically switching between VLA model and a\nlightweight generator. Inspired by the human motion pattern of focusing on key\ndecision points while relying on intuition for other actions, we categorize VLA\nactions into deliberative and intuitive, assigning the former to the VLA model\nand the latter to the lightweight generator, enabling frequency-adaptive\nexecution through collaborative model scheduling. To address spatial\nredundancy, we further develop a spatio-semantic dual-aware token pruning\nmethod. Tokens are classified into spatial and semantic types and pruned based\non their dual-aware importance to accelerate VLA inference. These two\nmechanisms work jointly to guide the VLA in focusing on critical actions and\nsalient visual information, achieving effective acceleration while maintaining\nhigh accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves up to\n1.5$\\times$ acceleration with less than 3% drop in accuracy, outperforming\nexisting approaches in multiple tasks.",

A variety of test cases are\nconducted to validate the performance of the adaptive UGKWP method, including\nhypersonic flows around a cylinder at multiple inflow Knudsen numbers,\nhypersonic flow over a slender cavity, side-jet impingement on hypersonic flow\nand three-dimensional hypersonic flows over a $70^{\\circ}$ blunted cone with a\ncylindrical sting.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a new theoretical perspective for studying the Hodge\nconjecture through an analytical framework based on constraint geometry. Our\ntheory begins with a key observation: in compatible pair Spencer theory, a\n\"differential degeneration\" mechanism simplifies Spencer differential operators\nto classical exterior differential under specific algebraic conditions,\nbridging constraint geometry and de Rham cohomology. This bridge alone is\ninsufficient to filter rare Hodge classes with algebraicity. We introduce the\ncore concept -- \"Spencer hyper-constraint conditions,\" a constraint system from\nLie algebraic internal symmetry integrating: differential degeneration, Cartan\nsubalgebra constraints, and mirror stability. This constraint principle filters\ngeometric objects with excellent properties from degenerate classes,\nconstructively defined as \"Spencer-Hodge classes.\" To reveal their geometric\nsignificance, we \"complex geometrize\" the framework, integrating with Variation\nof Hodge Structures theory to construct Spencer-VHS theory. We establish\nconnections between Spencer hyper-constraint conditions and flatness of\ncorresponding sections under Spencer-Gauss-Manin connections. With the\n\"Spencer-calibration equivalence principle\" and \"dimension matching strong\nhypothesis,\" flatness directly corresponds to algebraicity, providing\nsufficient conditions for verifying the Hodge conjecture. This forms\n\"Spencer-Hodge verification criteria,\" transforming the proof problem into\ninvestigating whether three structured conditions hold: geometric realization\nof Spencer theory, satisfaction of algebraic-dimensional control, and\nestablishment of the Spencer-calibration equivalence principle.

While existing models perform well\non novel view synthesis for isolated objects, they struggle to generalize to\ncomplex, cluttered scenes. To address this, GenMOJO decomposes the scene into\nindividual objects, optimizing a differentiable set of deformable Gaussians per\nobject. This object-wise decomposition allows leveraging object-centric\ndiffusion models to infer unobserved regions in novel viewpoints. It performs\njoint Gaussian splatting to render the full scene, capturing cross-object\nocclusions, and enabling occlusion-aware supervision. To bridge the gap between\nobject-centric priors and the global frame-centric coordinate system of videos,\nGenMOJO uses differentiable transformations that align generative and rendering\nconstraints within a unified framework. The resulting model generates 4D object\nreconstructions over space and time, and produces accurate 2D and 3D point\ntracks from monocular input.

The chaotic nature was revealed concretely\nthrough a matching among the vacuum Virasoro block in holographic CFT$_2$, ETH\nanalysis, and gravitational on-shell partition function in AdS$_3$ with\nnontrivial backreaction. In this work, we generalize this matching in two ways.\nFirst, we compute two-point correlator of the spinning defects, in contrast to\nprevious scalar defect correlator, in both the microcanonical ensemble and the\ncanonical ensemble. Holographically, these spinning defects correspond to bulk\ndomain walls composed of dust particles with angular momentum. Using the first\norder formalism of gravity, it is shown that the junction condition deviates\nfrom Israel's junction condition, resulting in a discontinuous metric across\nthe domain wall. Second, we calculate general higher point correlators\ninvolving multiple scalar defects and provide a detailed example with four\ndefects. We see explicitly that, because line operators in CFT$_2$ are\ncodimension one objects, the correlators depend on the order in which these\nnonlocal defects are inserted, unlike the Euclidean correlators of local\noperators. In both generalizations, we achieve a precise matching between field\ntheory solutions, ETH analysis and gravitational on-shell actions.",

    "abstract": "The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs), driven by growing\nparameter scales, adoption of mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures, and\nexpanding context lengths, imposes unprecedented demands on AI infrastructure.\nTraditional AI clusters face limitations in compute intensity, memory\nbandwidth, inter-chip communication, and latency, compounded by variable\nworkloads and strict service-level objectives. Addressing these issues requires\nfundamentally redesigned hardware-software integration. This paper introduces\nHuawei CloudMatrix, a next-generation AI datacenter architecture, realized in\nthe production-grade CloudMatrix384 supernode. It integrates 384 Ascend 910\nNPUs and 192 Kunpeng CPUs interconnected via an ultra-high-bandwidth Unified\nBus (UB) network, enabling direct all-to-all communication and dynamic pooling\nof resources. These features optimize performance for communication-intensive\noperations, such as large-scale MoE expert parallelism and distributed\nkey-value cache access. To fully leverage CloudMatrix384, we propose\nCloudMatrix-Infer, an advanced LLM serving solution incorporating three core\ninnovations: a peer-to-peer serving architecture that independently scales\nprefill, decode, and caching; a large-scale expert parallelism strategy\nsupporting EP320 via efficient UB-based token dispatch; and hardware-aware\noptimizations including specialized operators, microbatch-based pipelining, and\nINT8 quantization. Evaluation with the DeepSeek-R1 model shows\nCloudMatrix-Infer achieves state-of-the-art efficiency: prefill throughput of\n6,688 tokens/s per NPU and decode throughput of 1,943 tokens/s per NPU (<50 ms\nTPOT). It effectively balances throughput and latency, sustaining 538 tokens/s\nper NPU even under stringent 15 ms latency constraints, while INT8 quantization\nmaintains model accuracy across benchmarks.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have achieved widespread adoption across\nnumerous applications. However, many LLMs are vulnerable to malicious attacks\neven after safety alignment. These attacks typically bypass LLMs' safety\nguardrails by wrapping the original malicious instructions inside adversarial\njailbreaks prompts. Previous research has proposed methods such as adversarial\ntraining and prompt rephrasing to mitigate these safety vulnerabilities, but\nthese methods often reduce the utility of LLMs or lead to significant\ncomputational overhead and online latency. In this paper, we propose\nSecurityLingua, an effective and efficient approach to defend LLMs against\njailbreak attacks via security-oriented prompt compression. Specifically, we\ntrain a prompt compressor designed to discern the \"true intention\" of the input\nprompt, with a particular focus on detecting the malicious intentions of\nadversarial prompts. Then, in addition to the original prompt, the intention is\npassed via the system prompt to the target LLM to help it identify the true\nintention of the request. SecurityLingua ensures a consistent user experience\nby leaving the original input prompt intact while revealing the user's\npotentially malicious intention and stimulating the built-in safety guardrails\nof the LLM. Moreover, thanks to prompt compression, SecurityLingua incurs only\na negligible overhead and extra token cost compared to all existing defense\nmethods, making it an especially practical solution for LLM defense.\nExperimental results demonstrate that SecurityLingua can effectively defend\nagainst malicious attacks and maintain utility of the LLM with negligible\ncompute and latency overhead.

For example, TrRa reduces\ntoken usage by 54.63% on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B without any performance\ndegradation, outperforming DeepScaleR-1.5B's 33.86%. To complement TrRa during\ninference, we introduce a layer adapter that enables smooth Inference-time\nRealignment (InRa). This adapter is initialized to perform an identity\ntransformation at the bottom layer and is inserted preceding the original\nlayers. During inference, input embeddings are simultaneously processed by the\nadapter and the original layer, followed by the remaining layers, and then\ncontrollably interpolated at the logit level. We upgraded\nDeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B from a slow-thinking model to one that supports\nboth fast and slow thinking, allowing flexible alignment control even during\ninference.

To overcome these challenges, we propose the\nMulti-scale Global-detail Feature Integration Strategy (MGDFIS), a unified\nfusion framework that tightly couples global context with local detail to boost\ndetection performance while maintaining efficiency.

    "abstract": "Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) are highly effective in long-term time\nseries forecasting due to their ability to efficiently represent nonlinear\nrelationships and exhibit local plasticity. However, prior research on KANs has\npredominantly focused on the time domain, neglecting the potential of the\nfrequency domain. The frequency domain of time series data reveals recurring\npatterns and periodic behaviors, which complement the temporal information\ncaptured in the time domain. To address this gap, we explore the application of\nKANs in the frequency domain for long-term time series forecasting. By\nleveraging KANs' adaptive activation functions and their comprehensive\nrepresentation of signals in the frequency domain, we can more effectively\nlearn global dependencies and periodic patterns. To integrate information from\nboth time and frequency domains, we propose the\n$\\textbf{T}$ime-$\\textbf{F}$requency KAN (TFKAN). TFKAN employs a dual-branch\narchitecture that independently processes features from each domain, ensuring\nthat the distinct characteristics of each domain are fully utilized without\ninterference. Additionally, to account for the heterogeneity between domains,\nwe introduce a dimension-adjustment strategy that selectively upscales only in\nthe frequency domain, enhancing efficiency while capturing richer frequency\ninformation. Experimental results demonstrate that TFKAN consistently\noutperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across multiple datasets. The code\nis available at https://github.com/LcWave/TFKAN.",

However, a local\n``medium element\" in the continuous field may contain large numbers of\nvibrational particles at microscopic level, like for complex lattices with many\natoms in a unit cell. We find this causes the phonon spin in real materials no\nlonger a simple sum of each atom rotation, but a collective interference of\nmany particles, since phonons are phase-coherent vibrational modes across unit\ncells. We demonstrate the many-particle-interference phonon spin manifested as\nthe dipole moment rotating (DMR) of charge-polarized unit cell, by deriving the\ninfrared circular dichroism (ICD) with phonon-photon interaction in complex\nlattices. We compare the DMR with the local atom rotation without interference,\nand exemplify their distinct ICD spectrum in a chiral lattice model and two\nrealistic chiral materials.

To solve this problem, we\npropose a 3D mesh-guided refinement framework using a diffusion pipeline. We\nuse a state-of-the-art 3D hand mesh estimator, which provides more details of\nthe hands. For training, we collect and reannotate a dataset consisting of RGB\nimages and 3D hand mesh. Then we design a diffusion inpainting model to\ngenerate refined outputs guided by 3D hand meshes. For inference, we propose a\ndouble check algorithm to facilitate the 3D hand mesh estimator to obtain\nrobust hand mesh guidance to obtain our refined results. Beyond malformed hand\nrefinement, we propose a novel hand pose transformation method. It increases\nthe flexibility and diversity of the malformed hand refinement task.

In particular, the quantum Zeno effect has been studied\nin the context of both selective and nonselective measurements; for both pulsed\nand continuous interactions; for suppression and enhancement of decay (Zeno /\nanti-Zeno effects); and even in the absence of measurement entirely. This\nconcise review presents a unified picture of these effects by examining how\nthey all arise in the context of a driven qubit subjected to measurements or\ndissipation.

Prior works in interactive imitation learning solicit\ncorrective expert demonstrations under the OOD conditions -- but this can be\ncostly and inefficient. We observe that task success under OOD conditions does\nnot always warrant novel robot behaviors. In-distribution (ID) behaviors can\ndirectly be transferred to OOD conditions that share functional similarities\nwith ID conditions. For example, behaviors trained to interact with\nin-distribution (ID) pens can apply to interacting with a visually-OOD pencil.\nThe key challenge lies in disambiguating which ID observations functionally\ncorrespond to the OOD observation for the task at hand. We propose that an\nexpert can provide this OOD-to-ID functional correspondence. Thus, instead of\ncollecting new demonstrations and re-training at every OOD encounter, our\nmethod: (1) detects the need for feedback by first checking if current\nobservations are OOD and then identifying whether the most similar training\nobservations show divergent behaviors, (2) solicits functional correspondence\nfeedback to disambiguate between those behaviors, and (3) intervenes on the OOD\nobservations with the functionally corresponding ID observations to perform\ndeployment-time generalization. We validate our method across diverse\nreal-world robotic manipulation tasks with a Franka Panda robotic manipulator.\nOur results show that test-time functional correspondences can improve the\ngeneralization of a vision-based diffusion policy to OOD objects and\nenvironment conditions with low feedback.",

The\ninvestigation focuses on the effects of cluster parameters on two-point\ncorrelators using a rotor model for symmetric collisions ($^{16}$O+$^{16}$O and\n$^{20}$Ne+$^{20}$Ne) and asymmetric collisions ($^{208}$Pb+$^{16}$O and\n$^{208}$Pb+$^{20}$Ne).

    "abstract": "Current advances in AI and its applicability have highlighted the need to\nensure its trustworthiness for legal, ethical, and even commercial reasons.\nSub-symbolic machine learning algorithms, such as the LLMs, simulate reasoning\nbut hallucinate and their decisions cannot be explained or audited (crucial\naspects for trustworthiness). On the other hand, rule-based reasoners, such as\nCyc, are able to provide the chain of reasoning steps but are complex and use a\nlarge number of reasoners. We propose a middle ground using s(CASP), a\ngoal-directed constraint-based answer set programming reasoner that employs a\nsmall number of mechanisms to emulate reliable and explainable human-style\ncommonsense reasoning. In this paper, we explain how s(CASP) supports the 16\ndesiderata for trustworthy AI introduced by Doug Lenat and Gary Marcus (2023),\nand two additional ones: inconsistency detection and the assumption of\nalternative worlds. To illustrate the feasibility and synergies of s(CASP), we\npresent a range of diverse applications, including a conversational chatbot and\na virtually embodied reasoner.",
