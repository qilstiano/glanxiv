    "abstract": "Direct data-driven control methods are known to be vulnerable to uncertainty\nin stochastic systems. In this paper, we propose a new robust data-driven\npredictive control (DDPC) framework to tackle the uncertainty in dynamic\nsystems. By analyzing non-unique solutions to behavioral representation, we\nfirst shed light on the lack of robustness in subspace predictive control (SPC)\nas well as the projection-based regularized DDPC. This inspires us to construct\nan uncertainty set that includes admissible output trajectories deviating to\nsome extent from nominal predictions from the subspace predictor and develop a\nmin-max robust formulation of DDPC that endows control sequences with\nrobustness against such unknown deviations. We establish its performance\nguarantees under bounded additive noise and develop convex reformulations of\nthe min-max problem with moderate complexity. To mitigate the conservatism of\nrobust design, an adaptive robust DDPC scheme is further proposed by\nincorporating an affine feedback policy, with performance guarantees and\ntractable reformulations derived. Simulation studies show that the proposed\nmethod effectively robustifies SPC and outperforms projection-based\nregularizer.",

    "abstract": "Advancements in deep learning are revolutionizing science and engineering.\nThe immense success of deep learning is largely due to its ability to extract\nessential high-dimensional (HD) features from input data and make inference\ndecisions based on this information. However, current deep neural network (DNN)\nmodels face several challenges, such as the requirements of extensive amounts\nof data and computational resources. Here, we introduce a new learning scheme,\nreferred to as deep-and-wide learning (DWL), to systematically capture features\nnot only within individual input data (intra-data features) but also across the\ndata (inter-data features). Furthermore, we propose a dual-interactive-channel\nnetwork (D-Net) to realize the DWL, which leverages our Bayesian formulation of\nlow-dimensional (LD) inter-data feature extraction and its synergistic\ninteraction with the conventional HD representation of the dataset, for\nsubstantially enhanced computational efficiency and inference.

While\nmost theoretical studies assume atomically sharp, perfect interfaces, real SLs\noften feature atomic interdiffusion spanning approximately a single atomic\nlayer or more. Such interface mixing can significantly influence phonon\ncoherence and transport behavior. In this study, we employ atomistic\nwave-packet simulations to systematically investigate the effects of interface\nmixing on coherent heat conduction. Our analysis identifies two competing\nmechanisms that govern phonon transport across mixed interfaces: (1) Interface\nmixing disrupts coherent mode-conversion effects arising from the interface\narrangement. (2) The disorder enhances the potential for interference events,\ngenerating additional coherent phonon transport pathways. The second mechanism\nenhances the transmission of Bragg-reflected modes in periodic SLs and most\nphonons in aperiodic SLs, which otherwise lack coherent mode-conversion in\nperfect structures. Conversely, the first mechanism dominates in periodic SLs\nfor non-Bragg-reflected modes, where transmission is already high due to\nsubstantial mode-conversion. These findings provide insights into the interplay\nbetween interface imperfections and phonon coherence.",

    "abstract": "Ethical intervention prompting has emerged as a tool to counter demographic\nbiases of text-to-image generative AI models. Existing solutions either require\nto retrain the model or struggle to generate images that reflect desired\ndistributions on gender and race. We propose an inference-time process called\nDebiasPI for Debiasing-by-Prompt-Iteration that provides prompt intervention by\nenabling the user to control the distributions of individuals' demographic\nattributes in image generation. DebiasPI keeps track of which attributes have\nbeen generated either by probing the internal state of the model or by using\nexternal attribute classifiers. Its control loop guides the text-to-image model\nto select not yet sufficiently represented attributes, With DebiasPI, we were\nable to create images with equal representations of race and gender that\nvisualize challenging concepts of news headlines. We also experimented with the\nattributes age, body type, profession, and skin tone, and measured how\nattributes change when our intervention prompt targets the distribution of an\nunrelated attribute type. We found, for example, if the text-to-image model is\nasked to balance racial representation, gender representation improves but the\nskin tone becomes less diverse. Attempts to cover a wide range of skin colors\nwith various intervention prompts showed that the model struggles to generate\nthe palest skin tones. We conducted various ablation studies, in which we\nremoved DebiasPI's attribute control, that reveal the model's propensity to\ngenerate young, male characters. It sometimes visualized career success by\ngenerating two-panel images with a pre-success dark-skinned person becoming\nlight-skinned with success, or switching gender from pre-success female to\npost-success male, thus further motivating ethical intervention prompting with\nDebiasPI.",

    "abstract": "Decentralized finance (DeFi) markets spread across Layer-1 (L1) and Layer-2\n(L2) blockchains rely on arbitrage to keep prices aligned. Today most price\ngaps are closed against centralized exchanges (CEXes), whose deep liquidity and\nfast execution make them the primary venue for price discovery. As trading\nvolume migrates on-chain, cross-chain arbitrage between decentralized exchanges\n(DEXes) will become the canonical mechanism for price alignment. Yet, despite\nits importance to DeFi-and the on-chain transparency making real activity\ntractable in a way CEX-to-DEX arbitrage is not-existing research remains\nconfined to conceptual overviews and hypothetical opportunity analyses.\n  We study cross-chain arbitrage with a profit-cost model and a year-long\nmeasurement. The model shows that opportunity frequency, bridging time, and\ntoken depreciation determine whether inventory- or bridge-based execution is\nmore profitable. Empirically, we analyze one year of transactions (September\n2023 - August 2024) across nine blockchains and identify 242,535 executed\narbitrages totaling 868.64 million USD volume. Activity clusters on\nEthereum-centric L1-L2 pairs, grows 5.5x over the study period, and\nsurges-higher volume, more trades, lower fees-after the Dencun upgrade (March\n13, 2024). Most trades use pre-positioned inventory (66.96%) and settle in 9s,\nwhereas bridge-based arbitrages take 242s, underscoring the latency cost of\ntoday's bridges. Market concentration is high: the five largest addresses\nexecute more than half of all trades, and one alone captures almost 40% of\ndaily volume post-Dencun. We conclude that cross-chain arbitrage fosters\nvertical integration, centralizing sequencing infrastructure and economic power\nand thereby exacerbating censorship, liveness, and finality risks;\ndecentralizing block building and lowering entry barriers are critical to\ncountering these threats.",

Since this approach relies\non online optimization, it can be computationally expensive, and thus\nunrealistic for systems with limited computing resources. One potential\nsolution to this issue is to incorporate a Neural Network (NN) into the control\nloop to emulate the behavior of the optimal control scheme. Ensuring stability\nand reference tracking in the resulting NN-based closed-loop system requires\nmodifications to the primary optimization problem.

To address this issue, this\npaper develops a Neural Optimization Machine (NOM) to solve the resulting\noptimization problems. The central concept of a NOM is to transform the\noptimization challenges into the problem of training a NN. Rigorous proofs\ndemonstrate that when a NN trained on data generated by the NOM is used in the\ncontrol loop, all signals remain bounded and the system states asymptotically\nconverge to a neighborhood around the desired equilibrium point, with a tunable\nproximity threshold.

Availability is defined as the normalized effective\nservice time which is effected by different HO scenarios: Intra-satellite HO is\nthe HO from one beam to another within the same satellite; inter-satellite HO\nrefers to the HO from one satellite to another where satellites can be\nconnected to the same or different GSs. We investigate the impact of open radio\naccess network (O-RAN) functional splits (FSs) between ground station (GS) and\nLEO satellites on HO delay and assess how beam configurations affect RLF rates\nand intra- and inter-satellite HO rates. This work focuses on three O-RAN FSs\n-- split 7.2x (low layer 1 functions on the satellite), split 2 (layer 1 and\nlayer 2 functions on the satellite), and gNB onboard the satellite -- and two\nbeam configurations (19-beam and 127-beam). In a realistic dynamic LEO\nsatellite constellation where different types of HO scenarios are simulated, we\nmaximize effective service time by tuning the time-to-trigger (TTT) and HO\nmargin (HOM) parameters. Our findings reveal that the gNB onboard the satellite\nachieves the highest availability, approximately 95.4%, while the split 7.2x\nexhibits the lowest availability, around 92.8% due to higher intra-satellite HO\ndelays.",

To improve exploration, we introduce the Discrete Replica EXchangE\nLangevin (DREXEL) sampler and its variant with Adjusted Metropolis (DREAM).\nThese samplers use two GDSs at different temperatures and step sizes: one\nfocuses on local exploitation, while the other explores broader energy\nlandscapes. When energy differences are significant, sample swaps occur, which\nare determined by a mechanism tailored for discrete sampling to ensure detailed\nbalance. Theoretically, we prove that the proposed samplers satisfy detailed\nbalance and converge to the target distribution under mild conditions.\nExperiments across 2d synthetic simulations, sampling from Ising models and\nrestricted Boltzmann machines, and training deep energy-based models further\nconfirm their efficiency in exploring non-convex discrete energy landscapes.",

Retinal visual prostheses provide limited\ncapabilities as a result of low resolution, limited field of view and poor\ndynamic range. Understanding the influence of these parameters in the\nperception results can guide prostheses research and design. In this work, we\nevaluate the influence of field of view with respect to spatial resolution in\nvisual prostheses, measuring the accuracy and response time in a search and\nrecognition task. Twenty-four normally sighted participants were asked to find\nand recognize usual objects, such as furniture and home appliance in indoor\nroom scenes. For the experiment, we use a new simulated prosthetic vision\nsystem that allows simple and effective experimentation. Our system uses a\nvirtual-reality environment based on panoramic scenes. The simulator employs a\nhead-mounted display which allows users to feel immersed in the scene by\nperceiving the entire scene all around. Our experiments use public image\ndatasets and a commercial head-mounted display. We have also released the\nvirtual-reality software for replicating and extending the experimentation.\nResults show that the accuracy and response time decrease when the field of\nview is increased. Furthermore, performance appears to be correlated with the\nangular resolution, but showing a diminishing return even with a resolution of\nless than 2.3 phosphenes per degree. Our results seem to indicate that, for the\ndesign of retinal prostheses, it is better to concentrate the phosphenes in a\nsmall area, to maximize the angular resolution, even if that implies\nsacrificing field of view.",

First, we study the lifetime in the metastable\nsuperconducting state of current-biased short and long junctions, in the\npresence of Gaussian and L\\'evy noise sources. We highlight the noise-induced\nnonmonotonic behavior of the mean switching time as a function of noise\nintensity and driving frequency, that is the noise enhanced stability and the\nstochastic resonant activation, respectively. Then, we characterize the L\\'evy\nnoise source through the average voltage drop across a current-biased junction.\nThe voltage measurement versus the noise intensity allows to infer the value of\nthe stability index that characterizes L\\'evy-distributed fluctuations. The\nnumerical calculation of the average voltage drop across the junction well\nagrees with the analytical estimate of the average velocity for L\\'evy-driven\nescape processes from a metastable state. Finally, we look at the distribution\nof switching currents out of the zero-voltage state, when a L\\'evy noise signal\nis added to a linearly ramped bias current. The analysis of the cumulative\ndistribution function of the switching currents gives information on both the\nL\\'evy stability index and the intensity of fluctuations. We present also a\ntheoretical model to catch the features of the L\\'evy signal from a measured\ndistribution of switching currents. The phenomena discussed in this work can\npave the way for an effective and reliable Josephson-based scheme to\ncharacterize L\\'evy components eventually embedded in an unknown noisy signal.",

For our\nproof it is essential that the potentials are time-independent as a key tool in\nthis work are pointwise estimates for the Radon transform of the vector\npotential $\\mathcal{A}=(A_0,\\mathrm{i} A)$ and external potential $\\Phi$.\nFurthermore, the demonstrated stability estimates hold for a wide range of\n$H^s$ Sobolev scales and a main contribution is to explicitly determine the\ndependence of the involved constants and the H\\\"older exponent on the Sobolev\nexponents of the potentials $A_0,A$ and $\\Phi$.",

The SIRSV-model divides the\npopulation into four compartments and introduces periodic re-vaccination for\nwaning immunity. The efficiency of the vaccine is assumed to decay with the\ntime passed since the vaccination. Periodic re-vaccinations are applied to the\npopulation. We develop a partial differential equation (PDE) model for the\ncontinuous vaccination time and a coupled ordinary differential equation (ODE)\nsystem when discretizing the vaccination period. We analyze the equilibria of\nthe ODE model and investigate the linear stability of the disease-free\nequilibrium (DFE). Furthermore, we explore an optimization framework where\nvaccination rate, re-vaccination time, and non-pharmaceutical interventions\n(NPIs) are control variables to minimize infection levels. The optimization\nobjective is defined using different norm-based measures of infected\nindividuals. A numerical analysis of the model's dynamic behavior under varying\ncontrol parameters is conducted using path-following methods. The analysis\nfocuses on the impacts of vaccination strategies and contact limitation\nmeasures.

    "abstract": "Rationale and Objectives: Early prediction of pathological complete response\n(pCR) can facilitate personalized treatment for breast cancer patients. To\nimprove prediction accuracy at the early time point of neoadjuvant\nchemotherapy, we proposed a two-stage dual-task learning strategy to train a\ndeep neural network for early prediction of pCR using early-treatment magnetic\nresonance images. Methods: We developed and validated the two-stage dual-task\nlearning strategy using the dataset from the national-wide, multi-institutional\nI-SPY2 clinical trial, which included dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic\nresonance images acquired at three time points: pretreatment (T0), after 3\nweeks (T1), and after 12 weeks of treatment (T2). First, we trained a\nconvolutional long short-term memory network to predict pCR and extract the\nlatent space image features at T2. At the second stage, we trained a dual-task\nnetwork to simultaneously predict pCR and the image features at T2 using images\nfrom T0 and T1. This allowed us to predict pCR earlier without using images\nfrom T2. Results: The conventional single-stage single-task strategy gave an\narea under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.799 for pCR\nprediction using all the data at time points T0 and T1. By using the proposed\ntwo-stage dual-task learning strategy, the AUROC was improved to 0.820.\nConclusions: The proposed two-stage dual-task learning strategy can improve\nmodel performance significantly (p=0.0025) for predicting pCR at the early\nstage (3rd week) of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The early prediction model can\npotentially help physicians to intervene early and develop personalized plans\nat the early stage of chemotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Outside ideal settings, conventions are shaped by competing processes that\ncan challenge the emergence of norms. This paper identifies three trade-offs\nchallenging the diffusion of conventions: (I) the trade-off between the\nimperatives of social, sequential, and contextual consistency that individuals\nbalance when choosing between conventions; (II) the competition between local\nand global coordination, depending on whether individuals coordinate their\nbehavior via interactions throughout a social network or external factors\ntranscending the network; and (III) the balance between decision optimality\n(e.g., collective satisfaction) and decision costs when collectives with\nconflicting preferences choose a convention. We develop a broadly applicable\nstatistical physics framework for measuring each of these trade-offs, which we\nthen apply to a sign convention in physics. Our method can recover the\nstructure of the underlying coordination game, the networks of social\ninteractions involved, and the processes through which conflicts are resolved\nin collaborations. We find that the purpose of conventions may exceed\ncoordination, and that individual preferences towards conventions are\nconcurrently shaped by cultural factors and multiple social networks.\nAdditionally, we reveal the role of leadership in the resolution of conflicts.\nFinally, this work provides a generalization of Lewis' account of conventions.",

To overcome these\nchallenges, we introduce a novel coupled multi-physics neural operator learning\n(COMPOL) framework that extends the capabilities of Fourier operator layers to\nmodel interactions among multiple physical processes. Our approach implements\nfeature aggregation through recurrent and attention mechanisms, enabling\ncomprehensive modeling of coupled interactions. Our method's core is an\ninnovative system for aggregating latent features from multi-physics processes.\nThese aggregated features serve as enriched information sources for neural\noperator layers, allowing our framework to capture complex physical\nrelationships accurately. We evaluated our coupled multi-physics neural\noperator across diverse physical simulation tasks, including biological\nsystems, fluid mechanics, and multiphase flow in porous media. Our proposed\nmodel demonstrates a two to three-fold improvement in predictive performance\ncompared to existing approaches.",

However, ND methods often suffer significant performance drops\nunder minor distribution shifts caused by changes in the environment, known as\nstyle shifts. This challenge arises from the ND setup, where the absence of\nout-of-distribution (OOD) samples during training causes the detector to be\nbiased toward the dominant style features in the in-distribution (ID) data. As\na result, the model mistakenly learns to correlate style with core features,\nusing this shortcut for detection. Robust ND is crucial for real-world\napplications like autonomous driving and medical imaging, where test samples\nmay have different styles than the training data. Motivated by this, we propose\na robust ND method that crafts an auxiliary OOD set with style features similar\nto the ID set but with different core features. Then, a task-based knowledge\ndistillation strategy is utilized to distinguish core features from style\nfeatures and help our model rely on core features for discriminating crafted\nOOD and ID sets.

    "abstract": "Stiff differential equations are prevalent in various scientific domains,\nposing significant challenges due to the disparate time scales of their\ncomponents. As computational power grows, physics-informed neural networks\n(PINNs) have led to significant improvements in modeling physical processes\ndescribed by differential equations. Despite their promising outcomes, vanilla\nPINNs face limitations when dealing with stiff systems, known as failure modes.\nIn response, we propose a novel approach, stiff transfer learning for\nphysics-informed neural networks (STL-PINNs), to effectively tackle stiff\nordinary differential equations (ODEs) and partial differential equations\n(PDEs). Our methodology involves training a Multi-Head-PINN in a low-stiff\nregime, and obtaining the final solution in a high stiff regime by transfer\nlearning. This addresses the failure modes related to stiffness in PINNs while\nmaintaining computational efficiency by computing \"one-shot\" solutions. The\nproposed approach demonstrates superior accuracy and speed compared to\nPINNs-based methods, as well as comparable computational efficiency with\nimplicit numerical methods in solving stiff-parameterized linear and polynomial\nnonlinear ODEs and PDEs under stiff conditions. Furthermore, we demonstrate the\nscalability of such an approach and the superior speed it offers for\nsimulations involving initial conditions and forcing function\nreparametrization.",

    "abstract": "The Generalized SU(2) Proca (GSU2P) theory has recently garnered attention\nfor its potential to describe key phases of cosmic evolution, including\nprimordial inflation and late-time accelerated expansion. However, its full\ncosmological implications remain unexplored. In this work, we perform a\ncomprehensive analysis of the dynamical properties of the GSU2P theory in a\nflat, homogeneous, and isotropic spacetime, through a dynamical-system\napproach. Our analysis reveals the presence of three pairs of fixed points, one\nof them corresponding to de-Sitter expansion which may represent either a\nstable or unstable phase in the evolution of the universe. These points,\nnonetheless, give rise to an indeterminate or infinite Hubble parameter, which\nrenders them cosmologically unviable. Additionally, we find two key\npseudostationary states: the ``attractor lines'', along which the system\nexhibits constant-roll dynamics, and the ``central zone'', characterized by\noscillatory radiation-like behaviour of the field. The dynamics within the\ncentral zone could represent a graceful exit from the primordial inflationary\nphase to a radiation dominated phase, or a state of the dark energy component\nprior to the late-time cosmic acceleration. However, within the central zone,\nthe dynamics of the vector field leads to recurrent instances of a nonphysical\nexpansion rate. The absence of a limit cycle in the central zone further\nexacerbates the issue, as the system may follow unbounded phase-space\ntrajectories, and the expansion rate becomes complex once it escapes the\nregion. Collectively, these challenges undermine the viability of the GSU2P\ntheory as a cosmological model for cosmic acceleration.",

This\nproblem is strongly motivated by political redistricting, where contiguity,\npopulation balance, and compactness are essential. We provide hardness and\napproximation algorithms for this problem. In particular, we show NP-hardness\nfor an approximation better than $n^{1/2-\\delta}$ for any constant $\\delta>0$\nin general graphs even when the districts are star graphs, as well as\nNP-hardness on complete graphs, tree graphs, planar graphs and other restricted\nsettings. On the other hand, we develop an algorithm for balanced star\ndistricting that gives an $O(\\sqrt{n})$-approximation on any graph (which is\nbasically tight considering matching hardness of approximation results), an\n$O(\\log n)$ approximation on planar graphs with extensions to minor-free\ngraphs. Our algorithm uses a modified Whack-a-Mole algorithm [Bhattacharya,\nKiss, and Saranurak, SODA 2023] to find a sparse solution of a fractional\npacking linear program (despite exponentially many variables) and to get a good\napproximation ratio of the rounding procedure, a crucial element in the\nanalysis is the \\emph{balanced scattering separators} for planar graphs and\nminor-free graphs - separators that can be partitioned into a small number of\n$k$-hop independent sets for some constant $k$ - which may find independent\ninterest in solving other packing style problems.",

Here we investigate this question in the setting of cubic-lattice\nclassical Ising spin glasses, where recent theoretical and experimental\ndevelopments open the possibility of showing quantum speedup with quantum\nannealing, and where classical time-complexity results remain absent. For the\nsubsystem-based approach we introduce a very simple deterministic\ntensor-network heuristic that features linear time and space complexity for\napproximate optimization of the full problem. For the full-system approach we\nuse simulated annealing and parallel tempering. For the most rugged instances\ngenerated with tile planting on system sizes up to 56$\\times$56$\\times$56, we\nfind that full-system simulated annealing and full-system parallel tempering\ndisplay a slightly superlinear time complexity when targeting the same energy\nerror achieved by the subsystem-based linear-time heuristic. We also find that\nthe error of the latter heuristic monotonically decreases with increasing\nruggedness over the higher end of the ruggedness spectrum. These results\nsuggest that subsystem-based classical optimization heuristics should be taken\ninto account when seeking to demonstrate quantum speedup on rugged energy\nlandscapes.

This method is architecture-agnostic,\nmaking it adaptable to any APE system, regardless of the underlying model or\ntraining approach. Our experiments on English-German, English-Hindi, and\nEnglish-Marathi language pairs show the proposed approach yields significant\nimprovements over their corresponding baseline APE systems, with TER gains of\n$0.65$, $1.86$, and $1.44$ points, respectively. These results underscore the\ncomplementary relationship between QE and APE tasks and highlight the\neffectiveness of integrating QE information to reduce over-correction in APE\nsystems.",

Despite its clinical\nsignificance, developing OCT-based diagnostic tools faces challenges, such as\nlimited public datasets, sparse annotations, and privacy concerns. Although\ndeep learning has made progress in automating OCT analysis, these challenges\nremain unresolved. To address these limitations, we introduce the Vision\nTransformer-based Dual-Stream Self-Supervised Pretraining Network (ViT-2SPN), a\nnovel framework designed to enhance feature extraction and improve diagnostic\naccuracy. ViT-2SPN employs a three-stage workflow: Supervised Pretraining,\nSelf-Supervised Pretraining (SSP), and Supervised Fine-Tuning. The pretraining\nphase leverages the OCTMNIST dataset (97,477 unlabeled images across four\ndisease classes) with data augmentation to create dual-augmented views. A\nVision Transformer (ViT-Base) backbone extracts features, while a negative\ncosine similarity loss aligns feature representations. Pretraining is conducted\nover 50 epochs with a learning rate of 0.0001 and momentum of 0.999.\nFine-tuning is performed on a stratified 5.129% subset of OCTMNIST using\n10-fold cross-validation.

The introduction of gender-specific treatment, where only one\ngender receives treatment, allows for a detailed examination of its effects on\nboth male and female populations. Two compartmental models, divided by gender,\nare analyzed in parallel to identify the parameters that most significantly\nimpact the control of infected populations and the number of treated females.\nStochastic methods, including the Euler, Runge-Kutta, and Non-Standard Finite\nDifference (SNSFD) approaches, demonstrate that stochastic models provide a\nmore accurate and realistic portrayal of HIV transmission and progression\ncompared to deterministic models. Key findings reveal that the stochastic\nRunge-Kutta method is particularly effective in capturing the epidemic's\ncomplex dynamics, such as subtle fluctuations in transmission and population\nchanges. The study also emphasizes the crucial role of transmission\nprobabilities and treatment rates in shaping the epidemic's trajectory,\nhighlighting their importance for optimizing public health interventions.

For all variants of fair mean-payoff and fair energy\n(under unknown initial credit) games, we give pseudo-polynomial algorithms to\ncompute the winning regions of both players.

The decomposition of a particular algorithm into a\nsequence of these available gates is not unique. Thus, the fidelity of an\nalgorithm's implementation can be increased by choosing an optimized\ndecomposition. This is true both for noisy intermediate-scale quantum platforms\nas well as for implementation of quantum error correction schemes. Here we\npresent a compilation scheme which implements a general-circuit decomposition\nto a sequence of Ising-type, long-range, multi-qubit entangling gates, that are\nseparated by layers of single qubit rotations. We use trapped ions as an\nexample in which multi-qubit gates naturally arise, yet any system that has\nconnectivity beyond nearest-neighbors may gain from our approach. We evaluate\nour methods using the quantum volume test over $N$ qubits. In this context, our\nmethod replaces $3N^2/2$ two-qubit gates with $2N+1$ multi-qubit gates.\nFurthermore, our method minimizes the magnitude of the entanglement phases,\nwhich typically enables an improved implementation fidelity, by using weaker\ndriving fields or faster realizations. We numerically test our compilation and\nshow that, compared to conventional realizations with sequential two-qubit\ngates, our compilations improves the logarithm of quantum volume by $20\\%$ to\n$25\\%$.",

In this work, we\ninvestigate the role of cosmic ray (CR) feedback in galaxy evolution and\nreionisation, by examining its impact on the escape of ionising radiation from\ngalaxies. For this purpose, we present two Sphinx cosmological\nradiation-magneto-hydrodynamics simulations, allowing for the first time a\nstudy of the impact of CR feedback on thousands of resolved galaxies during the\nEpoch of Reionisation (EoR). The simulations differ in their feedback\nprescriptions: one adopts a calibrated strong supernova (SN) feedback, while\nthe other simulation reduces the strength of SN feedback and includes CR\nfeedback instead. We show that both comparably regulate star formation,\nreasonably match observations of high-redshift UV luminosity functions, and\nproduce a similar amount of hydrogen ionising photons. In contrast to the model\nwith strong SN feedback, the model with CRs lead to incomplete reionisation,\nwhich is in strong disagreement with observational estimates of the\nreionisation history. This is due to CR feedback shaping the ISM differently,\nfilling with gas the low density cavities otherwise carved by SN explosions. As\na result, this reduces the escape of ionising photons, at any halo mass, and\nprimarily in the close vicinity of the stars. Our study indicates that CR\nfeedback regulates galaxy growth during the EoR, but negatively affects\nreionisation, a tension which paves the way for further exploration and\nrefinement of existing galaxy formation and feedback models. Such improvements\nare crucial in order to capture and understand the process of reionisation and\nthe underlying evolution of galaxies through cosmic time.",

Our goal is also to estimate the impact of\nthe systematics present in current stellar evolutionary models (SEMs) on this\ninference. We use a new implementation of the BGM Fast Approximate Simulations\n(BGM FASt) framework to fit the seven million star Gaia DR3 all-sky $G<13$\ncolor-magnitude diagram (CMD) to the most updated dynamically self-consistent\nBGM. Our derived SFH supports an abrupt decrease of the star formation\napproximately 1-1.5 Gyr ago followed by a significant enhancement with a wide\nplateau in the range 2-6 Gyr ago. A remarkable hiatus appears around 5-7 Gyr\nago with a $\\sim$1 Gyr shift depending on the set of stellar models. A complex\nevolution at ages older than 8 Gyr deserves further investigation. Precise but\ndiscrepant values using different SEMs are found for the power-law indices of\nthe IMF. In our fiducial execution with PARSEC SEM, the slope takes a value of\n$\\alpha_2 = 1.45^{+0.19}_{-0.12}$ for the range [0.5-1.53]$M_\\odot$, while for\nmasses larger than 1.53 $M_\\odot$ we obtain $\\alpha_3 = 1.98^{+0.13}_{-0.05}$.\nUsing STAREVOL SEM, the inferred values are $\\alpha_2 = 2.48^{+0.09}_{-0.11}$\nand $\\alpha_3 = 1.64^{+0.15}_{-0.02}$. We find the solution with PARSEC to have\na significantly higher likelihood than that obtained with STAREVOL. The BGM\nFASt framework is now ready to address executions fitting all-sky Gaia data up\nto 14-17 apparent limiting magnitude.

A critical component of such studies is the\nassumed population model, which can range from astrophysically motivated\nfunctional forms to non-parametric treatments that are flexible but difficult\nto interpret. In practice, the current approach is to fit the data multiple\ntimes with different population models to identify robust features. We propose\nan alternative strategy: assuming the data have already been fit with a\nflexible model, we present a practical recipe to reconstruct the population\ndistribution of a different model. As our procedure postprocesses existing\nresults, it avoids the need to access the underlying gravitational-wave data\nagain and handle selection effects. Additionally, our reconstruction metric\nprovides a goodness-of-fit measure to compare multiple models. We apply this\nmethod to the mass distribution of black-hole binaries detected by\nLIGO/Virgo/KAGRA. Our work paves the way for streamlined gravitational-wave\npopulation analyses by fitting the data once and for all with advanced\nnon-parametric methods and careful handling of selection effects, while the\nastrophysical interpretation is then made accessible using our reconstruction\nprocedure on targeted models. The key principle is that of conceptually\nseparating data description from data interpretation.",

A subset of these modes is identified as superradiant,\nleading to the formation of quantum black hole `bombs'. All such quantum black\nholes have curvature singularities shrouded by horizons. Thus, while\nbackreaction enforces cosmic censorship, it also renders the black holes\ndynamically unstable. Further, we find all thermally unstable black holes are\ndynamically unstable, though the converse does not hold generally. Our findings\nthus suggest a semiclassical version of the Gubser-Mitra conjecture on black\nhole stability. This motivates us to propose a stability criterion for quantum\nblack holes.",

    "abstract": "Context: Tidal tails of open clusters are the result of stellar evaporation\nfrom the cluster through the Galactic potential and internal dynamics. With the\nrecent availability of high-precision data, tidal tails are being detected for\nmost of the nearby open clusters. Aims: We identify the tidal tail members for\nall open clusters within a distance of 400 pc that are older than 100 Myr and\nhave $>$100 members. To do this, we use model-independent methods. Methods: We\nused the convergent-point (CP) method to identify the co-moving stars near the\nopen clusters using Gaia DR3 data. A new method called the self-compact\nconvergent-point (SCCP) method was proposed and applied to some of the\nclusters. It performed better overall in tracing the tails. We also analysed\nthe colour-magnitude diagrams and orbital energy to diagnose possible\ncontamination. Results: Nineteen out of 21 clusters have tidal tails. Five of\nthem were discovered for the first time through this work. The typical span of\nthe tidal tails is 20--200 pc, and 30--700 member stars lie in the region\ninside the tidal radius and the tidal tails. Four out of 19 tidal tails are\ntilted away from direction of the Galactic centre. This contradicts the known\ntheory of the tidal-tail formation. The luminosity functions of the tails and\nclusters are consistent with each other and with the canonical stellar\ninterstellar mass function, but systematically higher radial velocities for the\ntrailing tail than for the leading tail were observed for the first time.\nConclusions: The CP method is useful for detecting tidal tails on a scale of\napprox. 100 pc for clusters closer than 400 pc. A further analysis of\ntheoretical N-body models is required to understand the incompleteness and\nbiases in the current sample of tidal tails.",

However, existing energy correlators all measure\ncorrelations in angles between particles, from which other observables such as\nmass must be inferred through potentially complicated procedures. In this work,\nwe generalize energy correlators to enable straightforward measurements of\nnon-angular correlations, which we call Energy Weighted Observable Correlations\n(EWOCs). To enforce collinear safety, EWOCs quantify correlations between\nsubjets rather than particles. The subjet radius can be tuned to control both\nthe physical scales probed by EWOCs and their sensitivity to non-perturbative\nphysics. We focus on the phenomenologically relevant example of the mass EWOC,\nwhich measures mass correlations between pairs of subjets, in the task of\nextracting mass scales from jets. In jet substructure determinations of the\nmass of a hadronically-decaying W boson, we show that the mass EWOC outperforms\nthe angle-based energy correlator, and performs comparably to the soft-drop\ngroomed jet mass.

A\ncareful analysis of the astrometric orbits and spectral energy distributions\nisolates 33 main-sequence (MS) stars with highly likely WD companions. By\ncombining cluster age estimates, dynamically measured WD masses, and, where\navailable, WD cooling temperatures, we derive progenitor masses for 26 WD\ncandidates. Our analysis suggests the presence of two distinct WD populations:\n(i) low-mass WDs, likely shaped by binary interactions during the progenitor's\nred-giant phase; and (ii) \"spender\" WDs, which experienced higher-than-expected\nmass loss and have progenitor masses above the IFMR predictions. The rest of\nthe candidates, referred to as the \"others\", represent systems with\ninconclusive formation mechanisms. We suggest that at least some of these\nsystems might be hierarchical triples, where the companion to the MS is a\ndouble WD or a double-WD merger product. However, follow-up studies are\nrequired to determine the nature of each case. These results highlight\nsignificant deviations from the IFMR derived for isolated WDs, emphasizing the\nrole of binary evolution. Follow-up observations, particularly in the\nfar-ultraviolet, are crucial for refining these findings and advancing our\nunderstanding of mass transfer processes and binary evolution pathways.",

A vast majority of datasets in optical and infrared astronomy are\nrepresented by values on a discrete grid because the actual signal is sampled\nby regularly shaped pixels in the light detectors.

However, personalized portrait generation remains challenging due\nto the diversity in user profiles, including variations in appearance and\nlighting conditions. To address these challenges, we propose IC-Portrait, a\nnovel framework designed to accurately encode individual identities for\npersonalized portrait generation. Our key insight is that pre-trained diffusion\nmodels are fast learners (e.g.,100 ~ 200 steps) for in-context dense\ncorrespondence matching, which motivates the two major designs of our\nIC-Portrait framework. Specifically, we reformulate portrait generation into\ntwo sub-tasks: 1) Lighting-Aware Stitching: we find that masking a high\nproportion of the input image, e.g., 80%, yields a highly effective\nself-supervisory representation learning of reference image lighting. 2)\nView-Consistent Adaptation: we leverage a synthetic view-consistent profile\ndataset to learn the in-context correspondence. The reference profile can then\nbe warped into arbitrary poses for strong spatial-aligned view conditioning.\nCoupling these two designs by simply concatenating latents to form\nControlNet-like supervision and modeling, enables us to significantly enhance\nthe identity preservation fidelity and stability. Extensive evaluations\ndemonstrate that IC-Portrait consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art\nmethods both quantitatively and qualitatively, with particularly notable\nimprovements in visual qualities.

QSM consists of multiple processing steps, with\nvarious choices for each step. Despite its increasing application in detecting\nand monitoring neurodegenerative diseases, the impact of algorithmic choices in\nQSM's workflow on clinical outcomes has not been thoroughly quantified.\n  Objective: This study aimed to evaluate how choices in background field\nremoval (BFR), dipole inversion algorithms, and anatomical referencing impact\nthe sensitivity and reproducibility error of QSM in detecting group-level and\nlongitudinal changes in deep gray matter susceptibility in a clinical setting.\n  Methods: We compared 378 different QSM pipelines using a 10-year follow-up\ndataset of healthy adults. We analyzed the sensitivity of pipelines to detect\nknown aging-related susceptibility changes in the DGM over time.\n  Results: We found high variability in the sensitivity of QSM pipelines to\ndetect susceptibility changes. The study highlighted that while most pipelines\ncould detect changes reliably, the choice of BFR algorithm and the referencing\nstrategy substantially influenced the outcome reproducibility error and\nsensitivity. Notably, pipelines using RESHARP with AMP-PE, HEIDI or LSQR\ninversion showed the highest overall sensitivity.\n  Conclusions: The findings underscore the critical influence of algorithmic\nchoices in QSM processing on the accuracy and reliability of detecting\nphysiological changes in the brain.

Additively manufactured alloys\nproposed for future nuclear applications are expected to demonstrate a distinct\nresponse to irradiation owing to their unique microstructure with as-solidified\ndislocation density and chemical microsegregation. To capture the composition\nredistribution in such systems, we develop a mesoscale model with coupled\nevolution of atomic and point defect components in the presence of dislocation\ndensity, dislocation heterogeneity, and thermodynamic interactions at the GB.\nThe model is parameterized for an FCC Fe-Cr-Ni alloy as a representative system\nfor austenitic stainless steels, and simulations are performed in 1D and 2D as\na function of irradiation temperature, dose, dislocation density, and grain\nsize. Radiation-induced segregation (RIS) characterized by Cr depletion and Ni\nenrichment is predicted at both the GB and the dislocation cell wall, with RIS\nbeing lower in magnitude but wider at the cell wall. Strongly biased absorption\nof self-interstitials by dislocations is found to suppress Ni enrichment but\nslightly enhance Cr depletion under certain conditions. Thermodynamic\nsegregation at the GB is predicted to be narrower and opposite in sign to RIS\nfor both Cr and Ni. Importantly, non-monotonic segregation is found to occur\nwhen both thermodynamic and RIS mechanisms are considered, providing a novel\nphysical interpretation of experimental observations. The model is expected to\nserve as a key tool in accelerated qualification of irradiated materials.",

There has been an increasing focus\non developing effective general trojan scanning methods across various trojan\nattacks. Despite advancements, there remains a shortage of methods that perform\neffectively without preconceived assumptions about the backdoor attack method.\nAdditionally, we have observed that current methods struggle to identify\nclassifiers trojaned using adversarial training. Motivated by these challenges,\nour study introduces a novel scanning method named TRODO (TROjan scanning by\nDetection of adversarial shifts in Out-of-distribution samples). TRODO\nleverages the concept of \"blind spots\"--regions where trojaned classifiers\nerroneously identify out-of-distribution (OOD) samples as in-distribution (ID).\nWe scan for these blind spots by adversarially shifting OOD samples towards\nin-distribution. The increased likelihood of perturbed OOD samples being\nclassified as ID serves as a signature for trojan detection. TRODO is both\ntrojan and label mapping agnostic, effective even against adversarially trained\ntrojaned classifiers. It is applicable even in scenarios where training data is\nabsent, demonstrating high accuracy and adaptability across various scenarios\nand datasets, highlighting its potential as a robust trojan scanning strategy.",

That in turn can impact the behavior of scientists and create\ndistortions in publication rates, frequency, and publication venues targeted.\nTo that end, we provide evidence that indicates significant inequality using\nstandard Gini Index metrics in the publication rates of individual scientists\nacross various groupings (e.g. country, institution type, ranking-level) based\non an intensive analysis of thousands of papers published in several well-known\nACM conferences (HRI, IUI, KDD, CHI, SIGGRAPH, UIST, and UBICOMP) over 15 years\nbetween 2010 to 2024.

    "abstract": "While the $\\Lambda$CDM model succeeds on large scales, its validity on\nsmaller scales remains uncertain. Recent works suggest that non-halo dark\nmatter structures, such as filaments and walls, could significantly influence\ngravitational lensing and that the importance of these effects depends on the\ndark matter model: in warm dark matter scenarios, fewer low-mass objects form\nand thus their mass is redistributed into the cosmic-web. We investigate these\neffects on galaxy-galaxy lensing using fragmentation-free Warm Dark Matter\n(WDM) simulations with particle masses of m$_{\\chi}$ = 1 keV and m$_{\\chi}$ = 3\nkeV. Although these cosmological scenarios are already observationally\nexcluded, the fraction of mass falling outside of haloes grows with the thermal\nvelocity of the dark matter particles, which allows for the search for\nfirst-order effects. We create mock datasets, based on gravitationally-lensed\nsystems from the BELLS-Gallery, incorporating non-halo contributions from these\nsimulations to study their impact in comparison to mocks where the lens has a\nsmooth mass distribution. Using Bayesian modelling, we find that perturbations\nfrom WDM non-halo structures produce an effect on the inferred parameters of\nthe main lens and shift the reconstructed source position. However, these\nvariations are subtle and are effectively absorbed by standard elliptical\npower-law lens models, making them challenging to distinguish from intrinsic\nlensing features. Most importantly, non-halo perturbation does not appear as a\nstrong external shear term, which is commonly used in gravitational lensing\nanalyses to represent large-scale perturbations. Our results demonstrate that\nwhile non-halo structures can affect the lensing analysis, the overall impact\nremains indistinguishable from variations of the main lens in colder WDM and\nCDM scenarios, where non-halo contributions are smaller.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents an integrated modelling assessment that estimated the\nsensitivities of five endogenous factors in commercial rangelands, i.e. number\nof active farmers, profits, stocking rate, standing herbage biomass, and soil\nerosion, to the same percentage variation in 70 factors, including economic and\nclimate drivers. The assessment utilised a system dynamics model (107\nequations) which represents an area of extensive private farms, its farmers,\nthe main local markets on which they trade, and key ecosystem services\ninvolved. The assessment procedure consisted in analysing the behaviours of\n288,000 variants of this system during 300 years, each under a different\neconomic and climate scenario. Our key findings were as follows: 1) It is\nlikely that at least annual grasslands will suffer environmental degradation in\nthe future, and that such degradation will be primarily caused by climate\nchange, not by the increasing demand for livestock products; 2) Private farming\nsystems provide social and economic security to farmers against the effects of\nclimate change, especially in a scenario of rising prices of animal products.\nHowever, this research will remain incomplete until its methods and results can\nbe contrasted with other similar assessments.",

The competition and interplay between these phases remain\nelusive, even for the seemingly most distinguishable band and Mott insulators.\nIn multilayer systems, such interplay is mediated by interlayer hopping, which\ncompetes with the Coulomb repulsion to determine the nature of insulators. The\nlayered compound 1T-TaS_{2} provides an ideal platform for investigating this\nphenomenon, as it naturally hosts coexisting Mott and band insulating states.\nHowever, distinguishing these distinct insulating states and characterizing the\nevolution remain challenging. In this study, we employ a dual approach\nutilizing surface-sensitive High-Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy\n(HREELS) and bulk-sensitive Fourier-transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) to\ninvestigate the electronic excitation spectrum of 1T-TaS_{2}. Our methodology\neffectively identifies the features originating from the Mott and band\ninsulators by analyzing the differences in their bulk and surface spectral\nweights, along with their energy distinctions. Based on the previous\nidentification, we further investigate the evolution of insulating state\nfeatures in the homostructure as they are modulated by temperature. The\nmeasurements and Dynamical Mean-Field Theory (DMFT) calculations suggest that\nthe softening and broadening of Hubbard excitations in the Mott state with\nincreasing temperature result from enhanced interlayer hopping between the Mott\nand band insulators.",

    "abstract": "Given finitely many pointed forces in the plane. Suppose that these forces\nsum up to zero and their net torques also sum up to zero. One can show that\nthere exists a system of springs whose boundary forces exactly counter-balance\nthese pointed forces. We will generalize to higher dimensions using the Cauchy\nstress tensor for elastic materials.\n  Given a system of springs, we can multiply the length of each spring with its\ncorresponding spring constant and then sum these products up. The result is\ncalled the total mass of the system. We are interested in the Plateau problem\nof the existence of the minimal spring system given a boundary condition.\n  This minimization problem was first introduced in 1904 by A. Michell. He\nshowed that a minimizer could smear out. The Michell Truss became known in\nmechanical engineering. It raised attention in optimal design, such as\nminimizing costs in building bridges. In 1960s and 1970s, the problem was\ndeveloped using PDE and convex analysis by introducing an equivalent dual\nmaximization problem. In 2008, Bouchitt\\'{e}, Gangbo, and Sppecher introduced\nlines of principal actions to generalize Hencky-Prandtle net to higher\ndimensional duality and proved that the minimizer can be found provided that it\nexists. In the unpublished notes of Gangbo, he also showed that if springs of\nthe same kind are optimal.\n  In this paper, we are going to solve the Plateau problem using two different\ntools in GMT: first, a minimizer can be viewed as a flat chain complex; second,\na minimizer can also be viewed as a current. At the end, we are going to show\none progress in discovering the topological properties of minimizers:\ncompressed and stretched springs must be perpendicular to each other at\nnon-boundary points.\n  I appreciate my advisor Prof. Robert Hardt for communicating with me\nregularly on this problem.",

However, it is\nrealized that the developed methodologies may not yield accurate values of CEs,\nespecially for magnetic systems with competing interactions, referred to as\nnontrivial magnetic systems. Currently, no comprehensive method effectively\naddresses the competing effects of the range of magnetic interactions among the\nconstituent entities emerging in such systems.

In this paper, we present ASTRAL, a tool\nthat automates the generation and execution of test cases (i.e., prompts) for\ntesting the safety of LLMs. First, we introduce a novel black-box coverage\ncriterion to generate balanced and diverse unsafe test inputs across a diverse\nset of safety categories as well as linguistic writing characteristics (i.e.,\ndifferent style and persuasive writing techniques). Second, we propose an\nLLM-based approach that leverages Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG),\nfew-shot prompting strategies and web browsing to generate up-to-date test\ninputs. Lastly, similar to current LLM test automation techniques, we leverage\nLLMs as test oracles to distinguish between safe and unsafe test outputs,\nallowing a fully automated testing approach. We conduct an extensive evaluation\non well-known LLMs, revealing the following key findings: i) GPT3.5 outperforms\nother LLMs when acting as the test oracle, accurately detecting unsafe\nresponses, and even surpassing more recent LLMs (e.g., GPT-4), as well as LLMs\nthat are specifically tailored to detect unsafe LLM outputs (e.g., LlamaGuard);\nii) the results confirm that our approach can uncover nearly twice as many\nunsafe LLM behaviors with the same number of test inputs compared to currently\nused static datasets; and iii) our black-box coverage criterion combined with\nweb browsing can effectively guide the LLM on generating up-to-date unsafe test\ninputs, significantly increasing the number of unsafe LLM behaviors.",

Simulations assume Planet-9 has a mass\nof 7.5 Earth masses, an inclination of ~20 degrees, a semi-major axis of ~600\nau, and an eccentricity of ~0.3. Results suggest a less massive Planet-9 aligns\nwith observed trans-Neptunian object inclinations and the number of ecliptic\ncomets (D > 10 km). Distant Kuiper belt objects with 40 < q < 100 au and 200 <\na < 500 au, particularly with significant inclinations, are more likely to\nalign apsidally with Planet-9, with an anti-aligned-to-aligned ratio of\n0.5-0.7. Lower inclination objects (<20 degrees) exhibit significant apsidal\nanti-alignment, with an anti-aligned-to-aligned ratio of 2-4. These findings\noffer a new observational direction to refine the search for Planet-9.",

We explore spatial search on\nthe complete bipartite graph, which is generally irregular and breaks the\nequivalence of the three quantum walks for regular graphs, and where the search\noracle breaks the equivalence of the Laplacian and signless Laplacian quantum\nwalks on bipartite graphs without the oracle. We prove that a uniform\nsuperposition over all the vertices of the graph partially evolves to the\nmarked vertices in one partite set, with the choice of set depending on the\njumping rate of the quantum walk. We boost this success probability to 1 by\nproving that a particular non-uniform initial state completely evolves to the\nmarked vertices in one partite set, again depending on the jumping rate.

This pilot study introduces a novel\nmodel, called Co-Operational Regressor Network (CoRe-Net) for blind radar\nsignal restoration, designed to address such limitations and drawbacks.\nCoRe-Net replaces adversarial training with a novel cooperative learning\nstrategy, leveraging the complementary roles of its Apprentice Regressor (AR)\nand Master Regressor (MR). The AR restores radar signals corrupted by various\nartifacts, while the MR evaluates the quality of the restoration and provides\nimmediate and task-specific feedback, ensuring stable and efficient learning.\nThe AR, therefore, has the advantage of both self-learning and assistive\nlearning by the MR. The proposed model has been extensively evaluated over the\nbenchmark Blind Radar Signal Restoration (BRSR) dataset, which simulates\ndiverse real-world artifact scenarios. Under the fair experimental setup, this\nstudy shows that the CoRe-Net surpasses the Op-GANs over a 1 dB mean SNR\nimprovement. To further boost the performance gain, this study proposes\nmulti-pass restoration by cascaded CoRe-Nets trained with a novel paradigm\ncalled Progressive Transfer Learning (PTL), which enables iterative refinement,\nthus achieving an additional 2 dB mean SNR enhancement.

Such attacks\nare especially dangerous as they can be executed remotely without requiring\nphysical access to the victim's device. This study focuses on a specific class\nof these threats: fingerprinting attacks, where an adversary monitors and\nanalyzes the behavior of co-located processes via cache side channels. This can\npotentially reveal confidential information, such as encryption keys or user\nactivity patterns. A comprehensive threat model illustrates how attackers\nsharing computational resources with target systems exploit these side channels\nto compromise sensitive data. To mitigate such risks, a hybrid deep learning\nmodel is proposed for detecting cache side channel attacks. Its performance is\ncompared with five widely used deep learning models: Multi-Layer Perceptron,\nConvolutional Neural Network, Simple Recurrent Neural Network, Long Short-Term\nMemory, and Gated Recurrent Unit. The experimental results demonstrate that the\nhybrid model achieves a detection rate of up to 99.96%. These findings\nhighlight the limitations of existing models, the need for enhanced defensive\nmechanisms, and directions for future research to secure sensitive data against\nevolving side channel threats.",

Kernel methods have recently been\ngeneralized to solve nonlinear PDEs by approximating their solutions as the\nmaximum a posteriori estimator of GPs that are conditioned to satisfy the PDE\nat a finite set of collocation points. The convergence and error guarantees of\nthese methods, however, rely on the PDE being defined in a classical sense and\nits solution possessing sufficient regularity to belong to the associated\nreproducing kernel Hilbert space. We propose a generalization of these methods\nto handle roughly forced nonlinear PDEs while preserving convergence guarantees\nwith an oversmoothing GP kernel that is misspecified relative to the true\nsolution's regularity. This is achieved by conditioning a regular GP to satisfy\nthe PDE with a modified source term in a weak sense (when integrated against a\nfinite number of test functions). This is equivalent to replacing the empirical\n$L^2$-loss on the PDE constraint by an empirical negative-Sobolev norm. We\nfurther show that this loss function can be used to extend physics-informed\nneural networks (PINNs) to stochastic equations, thereby resulting in a new\nNN-based variant termed Negative Sobolev Norm-PINN (NeS-PINN).",

Additionally, a Few-Shot annotation approach with GPT-4o\nachieved substantial agreement (Cohen's kappa of 0.684) with manual labels.\nEmotion analysis revealed that disinformation on X is mainly associated with\nincreased sadness and fear, while on TikTok, it correlates with higher levels\nof anger and disgust.

The present work focuses on model criticism, and more\nspecifically on Goodness of fit (GoF) tests, for intractable likelihood models.\nWe introduce two new GoF tests: the pre-inference \\gof tests whether the\nobserved dataset is distributed from the prior predictive distribution, while\nthe post-inference GoF tests whether there is a parameter value such that the\nobserved dataset is distributed from the likelihood with that value. The\npre-inference test can be used to prune a large set of models using a limited\namount of simulations, while the post-inference test is used to assess the fit\nof a selected model. Both tests are based on the Local Outlier Factor (LOF,\nBreunig et al., 2000). This indicator was initially defined for outlier and\nnovelty detection. It is able to quantify local density deviations, capturing\nsubtleties that a more traditional k-NN-based approach may miss. We evaluated\nthe performance of our two GoF tests on simulated datasets from three different\nmodel settings of varying complexity. We then illustrate the utility of these\napproaches on a dataset of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers for the\nevaluation of complex evolutionary scenarios of modern human populations. Our\ndual-test GoF approach highlights the flexibility of our method: the\npre-inference \\gof test provides insight into model validity from a Bayesian\nperspective, while the post-inference test provides a more general and\ntraditional view of assessing goodness of fit",

    "abstract": "Ba\\v{z}ant's microprestress theory relates the logarithmic basic creep of\nconcrete to power-law relaxation of heterogeneous eigenstresses at the\nnanoscale. However, the link between material chemistry, nanostructure, and\nmicroprestress relaxation, is not understood. To approach this, we use a simple\nmodel of harmonically interacting, packed nanoparticles, relaxing with and\nwithout external stress. Microprestresses are related to per-particle virial\nstress heterogeneities. Simulation results show that logarithmic creep and\npower-law microprestress relaxation emerge from generic deformation kinetics in\ndisordered systems, which can occur in various materials and at various scales.\nWhen the interactions are matched to some mechanical properties of C--S--H at\nthe 100 nm scale, the predicted microprestresses have similar magnitude as in\nBa\\v{z}ant's theory. The ability of our simulations to quantitatively link\nstress relaxation with nanostructure and chemistry-dependent interactions,\nprovides a pathway to better characterise, extrapolate, and even engineer the\ncreep behaviour of traditional and new concretes.",

It involves creating a memorable visual link between what a\nword means and what its pronunciation in a foreign language sounds like in the\nlearner's native language. However, these memorable visual links remain\nimplicit in the people's mind and are not easy to remember for a large set of\nwords. To enhance the memorisation and recall of the vocabulary, we developed\nan application that combines the keyword method with text-to-image generators\nto externalise the memorable visual links into visuals. These visuals represent\nadditional stimuli during the memorisation process. To explore the\neffectiveness of this approach we first run a pilot study to investigate how\ndifficult it is to externalise the descriptions of mental visualisations of\nmemorable links, by asking participants to write them down. We used these\ndescriptions as prompts for text-to-image generator (DALL-E2) to convert them\ninto images and asked participants to select their favourites. Next, we\ncompared different text-to-image generators (DALL-E2, Midjourney, Stable and\nLatent Diffusion) to evaluate the perceived quality of the generated images by\neach. Despite heterogeneous results, participants mostly preferred images\ngenerated by DALL-E2, which was used also for the final study. In this study,\nwe investigated whether providing such images enhances the retention of\nvocabulary being learned, compared to the keyword method only. Our results\nindicate that people did not encounter difficulties describing their\nvisualisations of memorable links and that providing corresponding images\nsignificantly improves memory retention.",

Here, we identify a tell-tale signature of\nFloquet-Bloch states in the linear optical response of laser-dressed solids\nthat remains prominent even in the presence of strong spectral congestion of\nbulk matter. To do so, we introduce a computationally efficient strategy to\nfinally capture the response properties of realistic laser-dressed solids, and\nuse it to compute the optical absorption of ZnO using a model of\nfull-dimensionality. The computations reveal intense, spectrally isolated,\nabsorption/stimulated emission features at mid-infrared energies present for a\nwide range of laser-driving conditions that arise due to the hybridization of\nthe Floquet-Bloch states.

At the very\nleast, it captures all universal content of that matrix model. The disk\ndecomposes into the physical (gauge invariant) solutions of the WdW equation,\nwhich are trumpets with discrete sizes. This decomposition modifies the usual\nno-boundary wavefunction to a normalizable one in sine dilaton gravity. We\nfurthermore present an exact quantization of sine dilaton gravity with open and\nclosed end of the world branes. These EOW branes correspond with FZZT branes\nfor the two Liouville theories that make up sine dilaton gravity. The WdW\nequation implies redundancies in this space of branes, leaving a one parameter\nfamily of gauge invariant branes. One gauge choice corresponds with branes\ndiscussed by Okuyama in the context of chord diagrams and of DSSYK. Legendre\ntransforming the EOW brane amplitude reproduces the trumpet, independent of the\nWdW quantization calculation.

This paper explores the compression\nof SSM-based models, particularly Mamba and its hybrids. We study the\nsensitivity of these models to the removal of selected components at different\ngranularities to reduce the model size and computational overhead, thus\nimproving their efficiency while maintaining accuracy. The proposed solutions,\ncollectively referred to as Mamba-Shedder, achieve a speedup of up to 1.4x\nduring inference, demonstrating that model efficiency can be improved by\neliminating several redundancies with minimal impact on the overall model\nperformance.

Experiments conducted on 14 representative RAG components\ndemonstrate that RAG exhibits significant vulnerability to all attack tasks and\neven the most apparent attack task can easily bypass existing retrievers,\nfilters, or advanced LLMs, resulting in the degradation of RAG service quality.\nCode is available at: https://github.com/IAAR-Shanghai/SafeRAG.",

    "abstract": "Bars are ubiquitously found in disc galaxies and are known to drive galaxy\nevolution through secular processes. However, the specific contribution of bars\nin suppression of star formation (SF) is still under inspection which we\ninvestigate in this paper using spatially resolved UV-optical colour maps &\nradial color profiles of a sample of 17 centrally quenched (CQ) barred galaxies\nin redshift range 0.02-0.06. The sample is selected based on their location in\nM$_{\\ast}$ - SFR plane. They are classified as passive based on parameters from\nMPA-JHU VAC, but non-passive based on the GSWLC catalog, indicating a passive\ninner region & recent star formation in their extended disc. We use archival\nSDSS r-band and GALEX FUV & NUV imaging data and created spatially resolved\n(FUV-NUV vs NUV-r) colour maps to understand the nature of UV emission from\ndifferent regions of these galaxies. We then analyse their NUV-r radial\nprofiles using NUV-r colour as a proxy for stellar population (SP) age. A\ncontrol sample of 8 CQ unbarred galaxies is also analysed to disentangle the\neffect of bulge and bar in quenching SF. The CQ barred galaxies display redder\ncolors (NUV-r $>$ 4-4.5 mag) in inner regions, up to the length of the bar,\nindicating the age of stellar population in these regions to be older than $>$\n1 Gyr. Most barred galaxies in our sample host pseudo bulges and do not host\nAGN, emphasizing most probable reason for the internal quenching is action of\nstellar bar. In comparison to the unbarred, the barred galaxies show redder\ncolors to a larger spatial extent. We conclude that bars in their later stages\nof evolution turn the inner regions of galaxies redder, leading to quenching,\nwith the effect being most prominent up to the ends of the bar and creating a\nregion dominated by older SP. This may occur when bars have already funneled\ngas to the galactic centre leaving behind no fuel for further SF.",

Of these, the drilling mode is the\none more likely to emerge in a soft matter shell (as compared to a hard,\nstructural one), as it is ignited by a swerve of material fibers about the\nlocal normal. We propose a hyperelastic theory for soft shells, based on a\nseparation criterion that envisages the strain-energy density as the sum of\nthree independent pure measures of stretching, drilling, and bending. Each\nindividual measure is prescribed to vanish on all other companion modes. The\nresult is a direct, second-grade theory featuring a bending energy quartic in\nan invariant strain descriptor that stems from the polar rotation hidden in the\ndeformation gradient (although quadratic energies are also appropriate in\nspecial cases). The proposed energy functional has a multi-well character,\nwhich fosters cases of soft elasticity (with a continuum of ground states)\nrelated to minimal surfaces.",

Reducing dependency on fossil fuels promotes sustainable practices and\naligns with circular economy goals such as resource efficiency, pollution\nreduction, and waste minimization. The existing literature has primarily\nfocused on the contribution of nuclear energy to decarbonization, whereas the\npotential of nuclear energy in facilitating a circular economy has been largely\nneglected. In light of this context, this paper explores the impact of nuclear\nenergy on the circular economy, thereby offering strong econometric evidence.\nThe study used the advanced econometric tool Dynamic Auto-Regressive\nDistributive Lag (DYNARDL) method for empirical estimation to obtain long- and\nshort-run estimates. The regression estimates, derived from a sample of China\nspanning 1990 to 2017, support the hypothesis that nuclear energy negatively\nimpacts the circular economy in both the long- and short-run.

These findings suggest that the optical coronal lines\nare significantly suppressed in the majority of local AGNs, possibly as a\nresult of the presence of dust in the emitting regions. We find that the\nincidence of ionized outflows is significantly higher in coronal line emitters\ncompared with non-coronal line emitters, possibly suggesting that dust\ndestruction in outflows enhances coronal line emission in AGNs. Many coronal\nlines show line profiles that are broader than those of narrow lines, and are\nblue-shifted relative the lower ionization potential lines, suggesting outflows\nin the highly ionized gas. Given the limited number of detections, we do not\nfind any statistically significant trends of detection statistics, or line\nratios with black hole mass, Eddington ratio, or AGN bolometric luminosity.

While a minimum of four measurement bases is typically required to\ndetermine an arbitrary pure state, we prove that for any states generated by\nfinite-depth Clifford + T circuits, just two measurement bases are sufficient.\nMore generally, we prove that two measurement bases are informationally\ncomplete for determining algebraic pure states whose state-vector elements\nrepresented in the computational basis are algebraic numbers. Since any pure\nstate can be asymptotically approximated by a sequence of algebraic states with\narbitrarily high precision, our scheme is referred to as asymptotically\ninformationally complete for pure state tomography. Furthermore, existing works\nmostly construct the measurements using entangled bases. So far, the best\nresult requires $O(n)$ local measurement bases for $n$-qubit pure-state\ntomography. Here, we show that two measurement bases that involve polynomial\nelementary gates are sufficient for uniquely determining sparse algebraic\nstates. Moreover, we prove that two local measurement bases, involving\nsingle-qubit local operations only, are informationally complete for certain\nalgebraic states, such as GHZ-like and W-like states. Besides, our\ntwo-measurement-bases scheme remains valid for mixed states with certain types\nof noises. We numerically test the uniqueness of the reconstructed states under\ntwo (local) measurement bases with and without measurement and depolarising\ntypes of noise. Our scheme provides a theoretical guarantee for pure state\ntomography in the fault-tolerant quantum computing regime.",

Existing centralized and fully\ndecentralized channel estimation methods face limitations due to excessive\ncomputational complexity or degraded performance. To overcome these challenges,\nwe propose a novel two-stage channel estimation scheme that integrates local\nsparse reconstruction with global fusion and refinement. Specifically, in the\nfirst stage, by exploiting the sparsity of channels in the angular-delay\ndomain, the local reconstruction task is formulated as a sparse signal recovery\nproblem. To solve it, we develop a graph neural networks-enhanced sparse\nBayesian learning (SBL-GNNs) algorithm, which effectively captures dependencies\namong channel coefficients, significantly improving estimation accuracy. In the\nsecond stage, the local estimates from the local processing units (LPUs) are\naligned into a global angular domain for fusion at the central processing unit\n(CPU). Based on the aggregated observations, the channel refinement is modeled\nas a Bayesian denoising problem. To efficiently solve it, we devise a\nvariational message passing algorithm that incorporates a Markov chain-based\nhierarchical sparse prior, effectively leveraging both the sparsity and the\ncorrelations of the channels in the global angular-delay domain. Simulation\nresults validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed SBL-GNNs\nalgorithm over existing methods, demonstrating improved estimation performance\nand reduced computational complexity.",

    "abstract": "In recent prior work, the author derived interfacial mass and heat flux\nconditions for phase-change processes. The mass flux condition is identical to\nthe Schrage equation, but the additional heat flux expression enables one to\ncouple the interface to the continua in both the liquid and the vapor phases\nand compute the interfacial temperature and density discontinuities. However,\nquestions exist on how to treat phase change heat transfer in the presence of\nnon-condensable gases. In this work, the author shows that the same set of\ninterfacial conditions can be used to account for the presence of\nnon-condensable gases. Although the mass flux of non-condensable gas is zero,\ntheir presence impacts the heat transfer. For evaporation, when the presence of\nthe non-condensable gas is small, temperature and density discontinuities\npersist across the interface, as well as inverted temperature distributions.\nFor condensation, however, no temperature inversion happens in the presence of\na small amount of non-condensable gas and the interfacial temperature jump is\nsignificantly smaller. When a large amount of non-condensable gas is present,\nsuch as for evaporation into and condensation from air, the temperature\ndiscontinuities at the interface are significantly smaller and no temperature\ninversion happens. For evaporation driven purely by humidity difference,\ntemperature inversion and discontinuity still exist. Results from this work\nwill benefit the modeling of phase change processes in the presence of\nnon-condensable gases, evaporative cooling in air, air-gap distillation,\natmospheric water harvesting, and other applications.",

The shape of the\ncavities is linked to binary and disc properties like viscosity and scale\nheight, and the disc and cavity shape influences the orbital evolution of the\nbinary stars.\n  This is the second part of the study in which we use 2D hydrodynamic\nlong-term simulations for a range of viscous parameters relevant to\nprotoplanetary discs to understand the interaction between young stars and the\ncircumbinary disc. The long-term simulations allow us to study how disc shape\nand exchange of mass, momentum and energy between binary and disc depend on the\nprecession angle between disc and binary orbit on time scales of thousands of\nbinary orbits.\n  We find a considerable, periodic interaction between the precession of the\ndisc and the binary eccentricity that can significantly exceed the\nprecession-averaged change in eccentricity. We further confirm that thin discs\n($H/R<0.05$) lead to shrinking binary orbits, also in the regime of low\nviscosity, $\\alpha=10^{-3}$. In general, the disc can excite eccentricity in\nbinaries with initial eccentricities in the range of $e_\\mathrm{bin}=0.05-0.4$.\nIn most cases, the terms aiding shrinking or expansion and circularisation or\nexcitation are nearly balanced, and the evolution of the binary semi-major axis\nand eccentricity will be sensitive to the ratio of mass accretion between the\nsecondary and primary components.",

The goal of this manuscript is to explain, from a PDE\nperspective, how this method works and how to derive the PDE governing the\nreverse dynamics as well as to study its solution analytically. By linking\nforward and reverse dynamics, we show that the reverse process's distribution\nhas its support contained within the original distribution. Consequently,\ndiffusion methods, in their analytical formulation, do not inherently\nregularize the original distribution, and thus, there is no generalization\nprinciple. This raises a question: where does generalization arise, given that\nin practice it does occur? Moreover, we derive an explicit solution to the\nreverse process's SDE under the assumption that the starting point of the\nforward process is fixed. This provides a new derivation that links two popular\napproaches to generative diffusion models: stable diffusion (discrete dynamics)\nand the score-based approach (continuous dynamics). Finally, we explore the\ncase where the original distribution consists of a finite set of data points.\nIn this scenario, the reverse dynamics are explicit (i.e., the loss function\nhas a clear minimizer), and solving the dynamics fails to generate new samples:\nthe dynamics converge to the original samples. In a sense, solving the\nminimization problem exactly is \"too good for its own good\" (i.e., an\noverfitting regime).",

    "abstract": "Bimodal stimulation, combining cochlear implant (CI) and acoustic input from\nthe opposite ear, typically enhances speech perception but varies due to\nfactors like temporal mismatch. Previously, we used cortical auditory evoked\npotentials (CAEPs) to estimate this mismatch based on N1 latency differences.\nThis study expands on that by assessing the impact of temporal mismatch\ncompensation on speech perception. We tested bimodal CI users in three\nconditions: clinical, compensated temporal mismatch, and a 50 ms mismatch.\nMeasures included speech understanding, pupillometry, CAEPs, selective\nattention decoding, and parietal alpha power. Despite stable speech\nunderstanding across conditions, neural measures showed stronger effects. CAEP\nN1P2 amplitudes were highest in the compensated condition. Phase-locking value\n(PLV) and selective attention decoding improved but lacked significance.\nParietal alpha power increased under 50 ms mismatch, suggesting cognitive\nresource allocation. Pupillometry correlated with speech understanding but\nshowed limited sensitivity. Findings highlight that neural metrics are more\nsensitive than behavioral tests for detecting interaural mismatch. While CAEP\nN1P2 amplitudes significantly improved with compensation, other neural measures\nshowed limited effects, suggesting the need for combined temporal and spectral\ncompensation strategies.",

    "abstract": "The true vision for real-time virtual and augmented reality is reproducing\nour visual reality in its entirety on immersive displays. To this end, foveated\nrendering leverages the limitations of spatial acuity in human peripheral\nvision to allocate computational resources to the fovea while reducing quality\nin the periphery. Such methods are often derived from studies on the spatial\nresolution of the human visual system and its ability to perceive blur in the\nperiphery, enabling the potential for high spatial quality in real-time.\nHowever, the effects of blur on other visual cues that depend on luminance\ncontrast, such as depth, remain largely unexplored. It is critical to\nunderstand this interplay, as accurate depth representation is a fundamental\naspect of visual realism. In this paper, we present the first evaluation\nexploring the effects of foveated rendering on stereoscopic depth perception.\nWe design a psychovisual experiment to quantitatively study the effects of\nperipheral blur on depth perception. Our analysis demonstrates that\nstereoscopic acuity remains unaffected (or even improves) by high levels of\nperipheral blur. Based on our studies, we derive a simple perceptual model that\ndetermines the amount of foveation that does not affect stereoacuity.\nFurthermore, we analyze the model in the context of common foveation practices\nreported in literature. The findings indicate that foveated rendering does not\nimpact stereoscopic depth perception, and stereoacuity remains unaffected with\nup to 2x stronger foveation than commonly used.

Although, we present alternative\napproaches that are of interest in the context of the further optimization in\nthe number of two-qubit operation, we note that these approaches do not perform\nwell enough in terms of the convergence to required energies. While these\nchallenges persist, our resource analysis represents a valuable step towards\nthe practical use of quantum computers and the development of better methods\nfor optimizing computing resources.",

    "abstract": "This work investigates how site-specific doping can enhance the\nthermoelectric performance of tetragonal Cu$_{2}$S using Density functional\nTheory and Projected Atomic Orbital Framework for Electronic Transport. We\naddress the gap in current research, where most doping studies focus on the\nhigh-temperature cubic polymorph, leaving the tetragonal structure\nunderexplored. By substituting Cu with Li, Na, or Mg, as well as partially\nreplacing S with Se or Te, we systematically examine changes in electronic\nstructure and transport properties. Our results reveal that cation-site doping\ncan strongly shift the Fermi level. In particular, Li doping enhances the power\nfactor ($\\sigma S^2$) by optimizing carrier concentrations and band-edge\nalignments, whereas Mg, due to its divalent nature, offers a higher carrier\ndensity but requires careful balancing to maintain a large Seebeck coefficient.\nOn the anion side, substituting heavier chalcogens (Se or Te) reshapes the\nvalence bands and subtly shifts the Fermi level, yielding moderate improvements\nin both electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient. These doping-induced\nalterations, captured through transport calculations, demonstrate a clear route\nfor tailoring the interplay between conductivity and thermal transport toward\npotentially high figure-of-merit values. Overall, the findings highlight the\nimportance of site specificity in doping strategies for tetragonal Cu$_{2}$S,\nshowing that judicious choice of dopant elements and concentrations can\nsignificantly improve key thermoelectric metrics. Such insights provide a\nfoundation for experimental validation and further development of\nCu$_{2}$S-based materials for mid- to high-temperature thermoelectric\napplications.",

    "abstract": "Rivers exhibit fractal-like properties that are associated with scaling laws\nlinking geometry and size. The optimal channel network (OCN) model, which is a\nmathematically tractable representation of river networks often used in\ntheoretical studies, is based on the fractal properties of rivers and\nconsequently reproduces geometric scaling laws. However, purely geometric\nrelationships may not fully capture the interaction between river structure and\nspecies' movement strategies that is most relevant to many large-scale\necological processes. In contrast, connectivity, which is a concept that blends\nhabitat geometry and individual movement, has been shown both theoretically and\nempirically to influence relevant large-scale ecological outcomes across a\nbroad array of ecosystems. Here, we analyze networks from more than 1000 major\nrivers around the world, including the Amazon, Mississippi, and Nile, to\ninvestigate how river network connectivity metrics scale with system size.\nSpecifically, we found clear power-law scaling of both the harmonic centrality\nand betweenness centrality network connectivity metrics. To assess the extent\nto which OCNs can capture these empirical connectivity patterns, we generated\nsynthetic river networks by fitting an OCN model to each real river. We found\nexcellent agreement between empirical and OCN-based scaling laws, supporting\nthe notion that OCNs can accurately represent rivers in network-based models\nand analyses. Finally, we examined the robustness of the connectivity scaling\nlaws to species movement strategies ranging from ideal shortest-path navigation\nto suboptimal random-path navigation. Surprisingly, we found that random\nnavigation breaks the power-law scaling relationship for harmonic centrality,\nbut not for betweenness centrality.",

This problem is usually formulated as\nextrapolating the Fourier transform of the object from a bounded region to the\nentire space, that is, in terms of performing extrapolation in frequency. This\nproblem is ill-posed unless one assumes that the object has some additional\nstructure. When the object is compactly supported, then it is well-known that\nits Fourier transform can be extended to the entire space. However, it is also\nwell-known that this problem is severely ill-conditioned.\n  In this work, we assume that the object is known to belong to a collection of\ncompactly supported functions and, instead performing extrapolation in\nfrequency to the entire space, we study the problem of extrapolating to a\nlarger bounded set using dilations in frequency and a single Fourier\nmultiplier. This is reminiscent of the refinement equation in multiresolution\nanalysis. Under suitable conditions, we prove the existence of a worst-case\noptimal multiplier over the entire collection, and we show that all such\nmultipliers share the same canonical structure. When the collection is finite,\nwe show that any worst-case optimal multiplier can be represented in terms of\nan Hermitian matrix. This allows us to introduce a fixed-point iteration to\nfind the optimal multiplier. This leads us to introduce a family of\nmultipliers, which we call $\\Sigma$-multipliers, that can be used to perform\nextrapolation in frequency. We establish connections between\n$\\Sigma$-multipliers and multiresolution analysis. We conclude with some\nnumerical experiments illustrating the practical consequences of our results.",

Recent theoretical and experimental works\ninvestigate the possible role of spin-orbit interaction in generating\nspin-triplet pair correlations. In this work, we present an experimental survey\nof thin normal metal-superconductor-normal metal trilayers with Nb\nsuperconductor and Al, Ti, Cu, Pt, Ta, and Au normal metals, along with single\nlayers of Nb as reference. We aim to probe the role of spin-orbit interaction\nand resistivity on the normal metal proximity effect through measurements of\nthe upper critical field. We find that the upper critical fields of the\ntrilayers are lower than that of a single layer Nb reference sample, and that\nthe trilayers with higher resistivity metals, Ti, Pt, and Ta, behave as\n2-dimensional superconductors. At low applied in-plane magnetic fields and\ntemperatures close to the zero field transition temperature, we find a possible\ndeviation from 2-dimensional to 3-dimensional behavior in the Ti and Pt\ntrilayers. We also find that compared to single layer Nb films, all of our\ntrilayers show a greater suppression of critical temperature during rotation\nfrom an in-plane to an out-of-plane applied magnetic field, with the greatest\nsuppression observed in trilayers with Au or Al. This suppression of the\ncritical temperature under field rotation might appear analogous to the\ncolossal spin valve effect that can be achieved in systems with ferromagnetic\nmaterials; however, in our trilayers, only conventional orbital screening\ncontributions to the suppression are present and the additional suppression is\nnot present in the absence of applied magnetic field.",

In this space, electric vertical take-off and landing\nvehicles (eVTOLs) perform a variety of tasks to improve aviation safety and\nefficiency, such as collaborative computing and perception. However, eVTOLs\nface constraints such as compacted shape and restricted onboard computing\nresources. These limitations necessitate task offloading to nearby\nhigh-performance base stations (BSs) for timely processing. Unfortunately, the\nhigh mobility of eVTOLs, coupled with their restricted flight airlines and\nheterogeneous resource management creates significant challenges in dynamic\ntask offloading. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel network\nslice-based Low-Altitude Intelligent Network (LAIN) framework for eVTOL tasks.\nBy leveraging advanced network slicing technologies from 5G/6G, the proposed\nframework dynamically adjusts communication bandwidth, beam alignment, and\ncomputing resources to meet fluctuating task demands. Specifically, the\nframework includes an access pairing method to pre-schedule optimal\neVTOL-BS-slice assignments, a pre-assessment algorithm to avoid resource waste,\nand a deep reinforcement learning-based slice orchestration mechanism to\noptimize resource allocation and lifecycle management. Simulation results\ndemonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing benchmarks in\nterms of resource allocation efficiency and operational/violation costs across\nvarying eVTOL velocities.

    "abstract": "This chapter presents Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND), the proposal that,\nbelow a certain acceleration scale $a_0$, dynamics departs from the Newtonian\nexpectation. In that context, the determining factor for the emergence of\napparent missing matter in galactic systems is predicted to be the\nacceleration, and not the mass or size of the system. MOND enables, for\nexample, the prediction of rotation curves from only the baryonic distribution\nof galaxies. The simple rule is that the acceleration observed in the\nlow-acceleration regime is the square root of the Newtonian expectation times\n$a_0$. Immediately, the flatness of rotation curves follows, as well as the\nproportionality of the fourth power of the asymptotic circular speed to only\nthe baryonic mass of the galaxy. While the asymptotic circular speed is\npredicted not to depend on the baryonic surface density of galaxies of fixed\nbaryonic mass, the inner shape of rotation curves is predicted to strongly\ndepend on it. More generally, MOND implies an algebraic relation between the\nacceleration expected from Newtonian gravity and the total observed\nacceleration, at any radius in a galaxy. This is known, observationally, as the\nRadial Acceleration Relation. For galaxy clusters, it is commonly accepted that\nMOND fails, needing a stronger gravitational force (or more baryonic mass than\nobserved) to account for the thermodynamic state of galaxy clusters, their\nlensing and kinematics. MOND, however, is not a complete theory, but a\nphenomenological non-relativistic paradigm in the limit of low accelerations,\nin need of embedding in a more fundamental theory. While various\nnon-relativistic field theories of MOND exist, the search for a relativistic\ntheory that recovers general relativity for high accelerations and MOND for low\naccelerations in the quasi-static limit, as well as a cosmology compatible with\nobservations, is still on-going.",

    "abstract": "For future regulatory compliance, organizations must assess and report on the\nstate of sustainability in terms of its impacts over time. Sustainability,\nbeing a multidimensional concern, is complex to quantify. This complexity\nfurther increases with the interdependencies of the quality concerns across\ndifferent sustainability dimensions. The research literature lacks a holistic\nway to evaluate sustainability at the software architecture level. With this\nstudy, our aim is to identify quality attribute (QA) trade-offs at the software\narchitecture level and quantify the related sustainability impact. To this aim\nwe present an improved version of the Sustainability Impact Score (SIS),\nbuilding on our previous work. The SIS facilitates the identification and\nquantification of trade-offs in terms of their sustainability impact,\nleveraging a risk- and importance-based prioritization mechanism. To evaluate\nour approach, we apply it to an industrial case study involving a multi-model\nframework for integrated decision-making in the energy sector. Our study\nreveals that technical quality concerns have significant, often unrecognized\nimpacts across sustainability dimensions. The SIS coupled with QA trade-offs\ncan help practitioners make informed decisions that align with their\nsustainability goals. Early evaluations can help organizations mitigate\nsustainability risks by taking preventive actions.",

Given that the controller observes only\nthe sequence of visited states, we investigate whether the actuator can\ncovertly deviate from the controller's policy to minimize its reward without\nbeing detected. We establish conditions for covert adversarial behavior over an\ninfinite time horizon and formulate an optimization problem to determine the\noptimal adversarial policy under these conditions. Additionally, we derive the\nasymptotic error exponents for detection in two scenarios: (1) a binary\nhypothesis testing framework, where the actuator either follows the prescribed\npolicy or a known adversarial strategy, and (2) a composite hypothesis testing\nframework, where the actuator may employ any stationary policy.

    "abstract": "The fate of deformable buoyancy-driven bubbles rising near a vertical wall\nunder highly inertial conditions is investigated numerically. In the absence of\npath instability, simulations reveal that when the Galilei number, $Ga$, which\nrepresents the buoyancy-to-viscous force ratio, exceeds a critical value,\nbubbles escape from the near-wall region after one to two rounds of bouncing,\nwhile at smaller $Ga$ they perform periodic bounces without escaping. The\nescape mechanism is rooted in the vigorous rotational flow that forms around a\nbubble during its bounce at high enough $Ga$, resulting in a Magnus-like\nrepulsive force capable of driving it away from the wall. Path instability\ntakes place with bubbles whose Bond number, the buoyancy-to-capillary force\nratio, exceeds a critical $Ga$-dependent value. Such bubbles may or may not\nescape from the wall region, depending on the competition between the classical\nrepulsive wake-wall interaction mechanism and a specific wall-ward trapping\nmechanism. The latter results from the reduction of the bubble oblateness\ncaused by the abrupt drop of the rise speed when the bubble-wall gap becomes\nvery thin. Owing to this transient shape variation, bubbles exhibiting\nzigzagging motions with a large enough amplitude experience larger transverse\ndrag and virtual mass forces when departing from the wall than when returning\nto it. With moderately oblate bubbles, i.e. in an intermediate Bond number\nrange, this effect is large enough to counteract the repulsive interaction\nforce, forcing such bubbles to perform a periodic zigzagging-like motion at a\nconstant distance from the wall.",

The remnant spans about 3.5 in diameter and exhibits bilateral shells.\nIn this work, we present optical spectra of G206.7+5.9 with the Large sky Area\nMulti-Object fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST), and narrow-band (H$\\alpha$\nand [SII]) images with the 1-m T100 telescope. The filamentary structure seen\nin H$\\alpha$ image shows a clear correlation with the radio emission. We use\noptical line ratios to determine the physical parameters of G206.7+5.9. The\nLAMOST spectra reveal large ratios of [SII]/H$\\alpha$ $\\sim$ (0.61-1.78) and\n[NII]/H$\\alpha$ $\\sim$ (0.63-1.92) consistent with that expected for a\nshock-heated SNR. The emission lines [OI] $\\lambda$6300, $\\lambda$6363 detected\nin the spectra also support the presence of shocks. Electron density ($n_{\\rm\ne}$) measurements based on the [SII] $\\lambda$6716/$\\lambda$6731 ratio suggest\ndensities between 117 and 597 cm$^{-3}$. We estimate the pre-shock cloud\ndensity ($n_{\\rm c}$) to be approximately 2.6$-$13.3 cm$^{-3}$. We also\ninvestigate the archival HI data and have newly identified an expanding gas\nmotion of the HI, whose velocity span is approximately 10 km s$^{-1}$.

    "abstract": "This paper examines the physical meaning of the wave function in Bohmian\nmechanics (BM), addressing the debate between causal and nomological\ninterpretations. While BM postulates particles with definite trajectories\nguided by the wave function, the ontological status of the wave function itself\nremains contested. Critics of the causal interpretation argue that the wave\nfunction's high-dimensionality and lack of back-reaction disqualify it as a\nphysical entity. Proponents of the nomological interpretation, drawing\nparallels to the classical Hamiltonian, propose that the wave function is a\n\"law-like\" entity. However, this view faces challenges, including reliance on\nspeculative quantum gravity frameworks (e.g., the Wheeler-DeWitt equation) and\nconceptual ambiguities about the nature of \"nomological entities\". By\nsystematically comparing BM to Hamilton-Jacobi theory, this paper highlights\ndisanalogies between the wave function and the classical action function. These\ndifferences, particularly the wave function's dynamical necessity and\nirreducibility, support a sui generis interpretation, where the wave function\nrepresents a novel ontological category unique to quantum theory. The paper\nconcludes that the wave function's role in BM resists classical analogies,\ndemanding a metaphysical framework that accommodates its non-local,\nhigh-dimensional, and dynamically irreducible nature.",

    "abstract": "When testing many hypotheses, often we do not have strong expectations about\nthe directions of the effects. In some situations however, the alternative\nhypotheses are that the parameters lie in a certain direction or interval, and\nit is in fact expected that most hypotheses are false. This is often the case\nwhen researchers perform multiple noninferiority or equivalence tests, e.g.\nwhen testing food safety with metabolite data. The goal is then to use data to\ncorroborate the expectation that most hypotheses are false. We propose a\nnonparametric multiple testing approach that is powerful in such situations. If\nthe user's expectations are wrong, our approach will still be valid but have\nlow power. Of course all multiple testing methods become more powerful when\nappropriate one-sided instead of two-sided tests are used, but our approach has\nsuperior power then. The methods in this paper control the median of the false\ndiscovery proportion (FDP), which is the fraction of false discoveries among\nthe rejected hypotheses.

The two geometries are\nlinked by a nontrivial diffeomorphism, which can be fully determined\nanalytically if the two geometries possess the same isometries. This exact\nsolution depends on four free parameters: the mass parameters of the two black\nholes, the ratio between the areal radii of the two metrics, and the\nproportionality constant between their (appropriately normalized)\ntime-translation invariance Killing vector fields. We study the dynamics of\naxial dipolar perturbations on such a background and obtain general analytical\nsolutions for their evolution. We show that, in general, the characteristic\ncurves followed by dipolar gravitational waves are spacelike with respect to\nboth metrics, and thus the propagation is superluminal. In fact, the velocity\nof a pulse, as measured by a static observer, turns out to increase with the\ndistance to the black hole. The only exception to this general behavior\ncorresponds to the special case where the two proportionality constants linking\nthe areal radii and the Killing vectors coincide, for which waves travel at the\nspeed of light. Therefore, we conclude that this is the only physically\nreasonable background, and thus our results restrict the class of viable\nblack-hole solutions in bimetric gravity.",

    "abstract": "While cosmological simulations of galaxy formation have reached maturity,\nable to reproduce many fundamental galaxy and halo properties, no consensus has\nyet been reached on the impact of `baryonic feedback' on the non-linear matter\npower spectrum. This severely limits the precision of (and potentially biases)\nsmall-scale cosmological constraints obtained from weak lensing and galaxy\nsurveys. Recent observational evidence indicates that `baryonic feedback' may\nbe more extreme than commonly assumed in current cosmological hydrodynamical\nsimulations. In this paper, we therefore explore a range of empirical AGN\nfeedback models, within the FABLE simulation suite, with different\nparameterizations as a function of cosmic time, host halo properties, and/or\nspatial location where feedback energy is thermalized. We demonstrate that an\nAGN radio-mode feedback acting in a larger population of black holes, with jets\nthermalizing at relatively large cluster-centric distances, as exemplified by\nour XFABLE model, is in good agreement with the latest weak lensing + kSZ\nconstraints across all k-scales. Furthermore, XFABLE maintains good agreement\nwith the galaxy stellar mass function, gas fraction measurements, and all key\ngalaxy group and cluster properties, including scaling relations and ICM radial\nprofiles. Our work highlights the pressing need to model black hole accretion\nand feedback physics with a greater level of realism, including relativistic,\nmagnetized jets in full cosmological simulations. Finally, we discuss how a\nrange of complementary observational probes in the near future will enable us\nto constrain AGN feedback models, and therefore reduce `baryonic feedback'\nmodelling uncertainty for the upcoming era of large cosmological surveys.",

Most existing open-vocabulary object detectors attempt to utilize the\npre-trained VLMs to attain generalized representation. F-ViT uses the\npre-trained visual encoder as the backbone network and freezes it during\ntraining. However, its frozen backbone doesn't benefit from the labeled data to\nstrengthen the representation for detection. Therefore, we propose a novel\ntwo-branch backbone network, named as \\textbf{V}iT-Feature-\\textbf{M}odulated\nMulti-Scale \\textbf{C}onvolutional Network (VMCNet), which consists of a\ntrainable convolutional branch, a frozen pre-trained ViT branch and a VMC\nmodule. The trainable CNN branch could be optimized with labeled data while the\nfrozen pre-trained ViT branch could keep the representation ability derived\nfrom large-scale pre-training. Then, the proposed VMC module could modulate the\nmulti-scale CNN features with the representations from ViT branch. With this\nproposed mixed structure, the detector is more likely to discover objects of\nnovel categories.

This is a typical situation\nin which the evaluators, have passed by heterogeneous experiences along their\nlife which implies they could consider different variables when evaluating a\nproduct. Despite it, the models for measuring Los usually consider a\nhomogeneous set of criteria when facing LoS evaluation. This study applies a\ntotally non-compensatory modeling that allows each customer to select the\ncriteria, from a whole set of aspects, the customer wants to use for evaluating\nLoS. The proposal was tested in evaluating LoS regarding the services provided\nby Airport Terminal of Passengers (ATPs) in Brazil, with data collected in a\nsurvey involving 19,240 passengers, interviewed at 15 Brazilian international\nairports. The data collected was imputed into ELECTRE TRI ME algorithm to\nobtain the a credibility degree of sorting the instances. The values of\ncredibility degree were them used to obtain groups of ATPs. Finally, the\nstatistical modes of the evaluations in each group were analyzed and compared.\nThe proposal allowed a full non-compensatory approach to obtain the credibility\ndegree even when considering perceptions from several evaluators that could use\ndifferent criteria. As a result, it was identified, for each cluster of ATP,\nthe criteria sets to be improved and even those to be prioritized. The pioneer\nmodeling proposed in this article for evaluating LoS plus its instancing in\nATPs terminals represents an original advance in the establishment of a\nmulti-criteria decision aid (MCDA) model to assess the quality of services and\nfills a relevant gap for a full non-compensatory approach able to classify the\nLoS in the airport context, considering perceptions of multiple evaluators even\nif they use different criteria in their evaluations.",

We leverage a\ntext-to-image model to achieve this goal.

    "abstract": "A crucial aspect in phase-field modeling, based on the variational\nformulation of brittle fracture, is the accurate representation of how the\nfracture surface energy is dissipated during the fracture process in the energy\ncompetition within a minimization problem. In general, the family of AT1\nfunctionals showcases a well-defined elastic limit and narrow transition\nregions before crack onset, as opposed to AT2 models. On the other hand,\nhigh-order functionals provide similar accuracy as low-order ones but allow for\nlarger mesh sizes in their discretization, remarkably reducing the\ncomputational cost. In this work, we aim to combine both these advantages and\npropose a novel AT1 fourth-order phase-field model for brittle fracture within\nan isogeometric framework, which provides a straightforward discretization of\nthe high-order term in the crack surface density functional. For the introduced\nAT1 functional, we first prove a {\\Gamma}-convergence result (in both the\ncontinuum and discretized isogeometric setting) based on a careful study of the\noptimal transition profile, which ultimately provides the explicit correction\nfactor for the toughness and the exact size of the transition region. Fracture\nirreversibility is modeled by monotonicity of the damage variable and is\nconveniently enforced using the Projected Successive Over-Relaxation algorithm.\nOur numerical results indicate that the proposed fourth-order AT1 model is more\naccurate than the considered lower-order AT1 and AT2 models; this allows to\nemploy larger mesh sizes, entailing a lower computational cost.",

To tackle these challenges, this\npaper proposes a novel Heterogeneity-aware Personalized Federated Learning\nmethod, named HAPFL, via multi-level Reinforcement Learning (RL) mechanisms.\nHAPFL optimizes the training process by incorporating three strategic\ncomponents: 1) An RL-based heterogeneous model allocation mechanism. The\nparameter server employs a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based RL agent to\nadaptively allocate appropriately sized, differentiated models to clients based\non their performance, effectively mitigating performance disparities. 2) An\nRL-based training intensity adjustment scheme. The parameter server leverages\nanother PPO-based RL agent to dynamically fine-tune the training intensity for\neach client to further enhance training efficiency and reduce straggling\nlatency. 3) A knowledge distillation-based mutual learning mechanism. Each\nclient deploys both a heterogeneous local model and a homogeneous lightweight\nmodel named LiteModel, where these models undergo mutual learning through\nknowledge distillation. This uniform LiteModel plays a pivotal role in\naggregating and sharing global knowledge, significantly enhancing the\neffectiveness of personalized local training.

While some security-related analysis\nof UEFI components has been performed--primarily via debugging and runtime\nbehavior testing--to the best of our knowledge, no prior study has specifically\naddressed capturing and analyzing volatile UEFI runtime memory to detect\nmalicious exploitation during the pre-OS phase.

By integrating\nhistorical redlining data with 2010 PM$_{2.5}$ and NO$_2$ concentrations, our\nstudy aims to discern whether a causal link exists.

The considered equations represent a three-dimensional system of\ngeological structure deformation subject to suitable initial and boundary\nconditions. The space derivatives are approximated using the finite element\nprocedure while the approximation in time derivative is obtained using the\nLax-Wendroff and interpolation techniques. The new approach is so called a\ncombined Lax-Wendroff/interpolation method with finite element method. The\nmodified Lax-Wendroff/interpolation scheme is employed to efficiently treat the\ntime derivative term and to provide a suitable time step restriction for\nstability. Under this time step requirement, both stability and error estimates\nof the new algorithm are deeply analyzed using a constructed strong norm.

Our\nobjective is to address the following dilemma in multicell ISAC: 1) Beamforming\nstrategies that rely solely on local channel information risk generating\nsignificant inter-cell interference (ICI), which degrades network performance\nfor both communication users and sensing receivers in neighboring cells; 2)\nconversely centralized beamforming strategies can mitigate ICI by leveraging\nglobal channel information, but they come with substantial transmission\noverhead and latency that can be prohibitive for latency-sensitive and\nsource-constrained applications. To tackle these challenges, we first propose a\npartially decentralized training framework motivated by the vertical federated\nlearning (VFL) paradigm. In this framework, the participating base stations\n(BSs) collaboratively design beamforming matrices under the guidance of a\ncentral server. The central server aggregates local information from the BSs\nand provides feedback, allowing BSs to implicitly manage ICI without accessing\nthe global channel information. To make the solution scalable for densely\ndeployed wireless networks, we take further steps to reduce communication\noverhead by presenting a fully decentralized design based on the horizontal\nfederated learning (HFL). Specifically, we develop a novel loss function to\ncontrol the interference leakage power, enabling a more efficient training\nprocess by entirely eliminating local channel information exchange.

    "abstract": "This paper examines the systemic risks posed by incremental advancements in\nartificial intelligence, developing the concept of `gradual disempowerment', in\ncontrast to the abrupt takeover scenarios commonly discussed in AI safety. We\nanalyze how even incremental improvements in AI capabilities can undermine\nhuman influence over large-scale systems that society depends on, including the\neconomy, culture, and nation-states. As AI increasingly replaces human labor\nand cognition in these domains, it can weaken both explicit human control\nmechanisms (like voting and consumer choice) and the implicit alignments with\nhuman interests that often arise from societal systems' reliance on human\nparticipation to function. Furthermore, to the extent that these systems\nincentivise outcomes that do not line up with human preferences, AIs may\noptimize for those outcomes more aggressively. These effects may be mutually\nreinforcing across different domains: economic power shapes cultural narratives\nand political decisions, while cultural shifts alter economic and political\nbehavior. We argue that this dynamic could lead to an effectively irreversible\nloss of human influence over crucial societal systems, precipitating an\nexistential catastrophe through the permanent disempowerment of humanity. This\nsuggests the need for both technical research and governance approaches that\nspecifically address the risk of incremental erosion of human influence across\ninterconnected societal systems.",

In explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), the Shapley\nValue (SV) is the predominant method to quantify contributions of individual\nfeatures to a ML model's output. Addressing the limitations of SVs in complex\nprediction models, Shapley Interactions (SIs) extend the SV to groups of\nfeatures. In this work, we explain single graph predictions of GNNs with SIs\nthat quantify node contributions and interactions among multiple nodes.

As a result, the\nexponential complexity of SIs depends only on the receptive fields, i.e. the\nmessage-passing ranges determined by the connectivity of the graph and the\nnumber of convolutional layers. Based on our theoretical results, we introduce\nGraphSHAP-IQ, an efficient approach to compute any-order SIs exactly.\nGraphSHAP-IQ is applicable to popular message passing techniques in conjunction\nwith a linear global pooling and output layer. We showcase that GraphSHAP-IQ\nsubstantially reduces the exponential complexity of computing exact SIs on\nmultiple benchmark datasets.

A significant remaining issue lies in\nthe major differences between teacher and student models, namely the\nsubstantial capacity gap, mode averaging, and mode collapse, which pose\nbarriers during distillation. To address these issues, we introduce\n$\\textit{Temporally Adaptive Interpolated Distillation (TAID)}$, a novel\nknowledge distillation approach that dynamically interpolates student and\nteacher distributions through an adaptive intermediate distribution, gradually\nshifting from the student's initial distribution towards the teacher's\ndistribution.

For hierarchical\nmultivarariates outcomes, the FDA recommends the Win Ratio and Generalized\nPairwise Comparisons approaches. However, as far as we know, these empirical\nmethods lack causal or statistical foundations to justify their broader use in\nrecent studies. To address this gap, we establish causal foundations for\nhierarchical comparison methods. We define related causal effect measures, and\nhighlight that depending on the methodology used to compute Win Ratios or Net\nBenefits of treatments, the causal estimand targeted can be different, as\nproved by our consistency results. Quite dramatically, it appears that the\ncausal estimand related to the historical estimation approach can yield\nreversed and incorrect treatment recommendations in heterogeneous populations,\nas we illustrate through striking examples. In order to compensate for this\nfallacy, we introduce a novel, individual-level yet identifiable causal effect\nmeasure that better approximates the ideal, non-identifiable individual-level\nestimand. We prove that computing Win Ratio or Net Benefits using a Nearest\nNeighbor pairing approach between treated and controlled patients, an approach\nthat can be seen as an extreme form of stratification, leads to estimating this\nnew causal estimand measure. We extend our methods to observational settings\nvia propensity weighting, distributional regression to address the curse of\ndimensionality, and a doubly robust framework.

This\nvariability arises from multiple sources, including train-test split, weights\ninitialization, and hyperparameter tuning. Investigating the characteristics of\nperformance metric distributions, rather than focusing on a single point only,\nis essential for informed decision-making during model selection and\noptimization, especially in high-stakes settings.\n  How does the performance metric vary due to intrinsic uncertainty in the\nselected modeling approach? For example, train-test split is modified, initial\nweights for optimization are modified or hyperparameter tuning is done using an\nalgorithm with probabilistic nature?\n  This is shifting the focus from identifying a single best model to\nunderstanding a distribution of the performance metric that captures\nvariability across different training conditions. By running multiple\nexperiments with varied settings, empirical distributions of performance\nmetrics can be generated.

For the $q$-state\nPotts model, the critical exponents are merely determined by the\norder-parameter symmetry $S_q$, spatial dimensionality and interaction range,\nindependent of microscopic details. In a simplest and mean-field\ntreatment--i.e., the Potts model on complete graph (CG), the phase transition\nis further established to be of percolation universality for the range of $0 <\nq <2$. By simulating the CG Potts model in the random-cluster representation,\nwe numerically demonstrate such a hyper-universality that the critical\nexponents are the same for $0< q <2$ and, moreover, the Ising system ($q = 2$)\nexhibits a variety of critical geometric properties in percolation\nuniversality. On the other hand, many other universal properties in the\nfinite-size scaling (FSS) theory, including Binder-like ratios and distribution\nfunction of the order parameter, are observed to be $q$-dependent. Our finding\nprovides valuable insights for the study of critical phenomena in finite\nspatial dimensions, particularly when the FSS theory is utilized.",

Moreover, performing these measurements can be costly in\npractice, e.g., due to the use of resources. With these challenges in mind, it\nis desirable to reduce the number of measurements needed to optimize\nperformance. Therefore, in this work, we present a sampled-data ESC approach\naimed at reducing the number of measurements that need to be performed. In the\nproposed approach, we use input-output data obtained during regular operation\nof the extremum-seeking controller to construct online an approximation of the\nsystem's underlying cost function.

As a result, we indeed obtain a reduction in the\nrequired number of measurements to achieve optimization.

This result\neffectively overcomes the strong mode competition typically observed in modes\nwith similar spatial distributions and frequency scales. Remarkably, this\nregime is achieved even when the mechanical frequencies do not satisfy a\nharmonic relation, leading to quasi-periodic or chaotic intra-cavity power\ndynamics, while the mechanical modes maintain coherent, high-amplitude\noscillations. These results, supported by a numerical model that accurately\npredicts the dynamics of the system, open new pathways for the generation and\ncontrol of multi-phonon coherent sources in chip-integrated silicon platforms.",

This study\nintroduces a probabilistic model of bilateral lymphatic tumor progression in\nOPSCC to estimate personalized risks of occult disease in specific lymph node\nlevels (LNLs) based on clinical involvement, T-stage, and tumor lateralization.\nBuilding on a previously developed hidden Markov model for ipsilateral spread,\nwe extend the approach to the contralateral neck. The model represents LNLs I,\nII, III, IV, V, and VII on both sides of the neck as binary hidden variables\n(healthy/involved), connected via arcs representing spread probabilities. These\nprobabilities are learned using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling from a\ndataset of 833 OPSCC patients, enabling the model to reflect the underlying\nlymphatic progression dynamics. The model accurately and precisely describes\nobserved patterns of involvement with a compact set of interpretable\nparameters. Midline extension of the primary tumor is identified as the primary\nrisk factor for contralateral involvement, with advanced T-stage and extensive\nipsilateral involvement further increasing risk. Occult disease in\ncontralateral LNL III is highly unlikely if upstream LNL II is clinically\nnegative, and in contralateral LNL IV, occult disease is exceedingly rare\nwithout LNL III involvement. For lateralized tumors not crossing the midline,\nthe model suggests the contralateral neck may safely be excluded from the\nCTV-N. For tumors extending across the midline but with a clinically negative\ncontralateral neck, the CTV-N could be limited to LNL II, reducing unnecessary\nexposure of normal tissue while maintaining regional tumor control.",

Recently, the\noptical-circuit-switches (OCSes) have attracted industry and academia because\nof their cost efficiency and higher capacity than traditional electrical packet\nswitches (EPSes) and reconfigurable optical add drop multiplexers (ROADMs).\nThough the open interfaces and control planes for traditional ROADMs and\ntransponders have been defined by several standard-defining organizations\n(SDOs), those of OCSes have not. Considering that several OCSes have already\nbeen installed in production datacenter networks (DCNs) and several OCS\nproducts are on the market, bringing the openness and interoperability into the\nOCS-based networks has become important. Motivated by this fact, this paper\ninvestigates a software-defined networking (SDN) controller for open\noptical-circuit-switched networks. To this end, we identified the use cases of\nOCSes and derived the controller requirements for supporting them. We then\nproposed a multi-vendor (MV) OCS controller framework that satisfies the\nderived requirements; it was designed to quickly and consistently operate fiber\npaths upon receiving the operation requests. We validated our controller by\nimplementing it and evaluating its performance on actual MV-OCS networks. It\nsatisfied all the requirements, and fiber paths could be configured within 1.0\nsecond by using our controller.",

On the other hand, the constraints on $H_0$ in the sound\nhorizon-independent EFTofLSS analysis arise from not only the shape of the\npower spectrum ($k_\\text{eq}$-based $H_0$), but also the overall amplitude\n(when combined with CMB lensing observations) and the relative amplitudes of\nthe BAO wiggles, thus besides $k_\\text{eq}$ other information may also play a\nrole in constraining $H_0$.

We investigate three injection scenarios for UHECRs, and\ntrack them through isotropic turbulent magnetic fields of varying strengths in\nthe Galactic halo. We calculate the resultant dipole and quadrupole amplitudes\nfor the arriving UHECRs detected by an observer in the Galactic plane region.\nWe find that, regardless of the injection scenario considered, when the\nscattering length of the particles is comparable to the size of the halo, the\nUHECRs skymap resembles a dipole. However, as the scattering length is\nincreased, the dipolar moment always increases, and the quadrupolar moment\nincreases rapidly for two of the three cases considered. Additionally, the\nquadrupole amplitude is highlighted to be a key discriminator in discerning the\norigin of the observed dipole. We conclude that, to understand the origin of\nthe UHECR dipole, one has to measure the strength of the quadrupole amplitude\nas well.",

    "abstract": "Anomaly detection is crucial for ensuring the stability and reliability of\nweb service systems. Logs and metrics contain multiple information that can\nreflect the system's operational state and potential anomalies. Thus, existing\nanomaly detection methods use logs and metrics to detect web service systems'\nanomalies through data fusion approaches. They associate logs and metrics using\ncoarse-grained time window alignment and capture the normal patterns of system\noperation through reconstruction. However, these methods have two issues that\nlimit their performance in anomaly detection. First, due to asynchrony between\nlogs and metrics, coarse-grained time window alignment cannot achieve a precise\nassociation between the two modalities. Second, reconstruction-based methods\nsuffer from severe overgeneralization problems, resulting in anomalies being\naccurately reconstructed. In this paper, we propose a novel anomaly detection\nmethod named FFAD to address these two issues. On the one hand, FFAD employs\ngraph-based alignment to mine and extract associations between the modalities\nfrom the constructed log-metric relation graph, achieving precise associations\nbetween logs and metrics. On the other hand, we improve the model's fit to\nnormal data distributions through Fourier Frequency Focus, thereby enhancing\nthe effectiveness of anomaly detection. We validated the effectiveness of our\nmodel on two real-world industrial datasets and one open-source dataset.

The\norientation of the polarization vectors is strongly wavelength-dependent and\ncan be attributed to different wavelength-dependent polarization mechanisms in\nthe disk and its local environment. In bands A, C, and D, the orientation of\nthe polarization is roughly consistent with a value of 114{\\deg} at the maximum\nemission. Hereby, the magnetic field direction is close to that of the spin\naxis of the disk. In contrast, in band E, the orientation is nearly parallel to\nthe minor axis of the projection of the inclined disk. Based on a viscous\naccretion disk model combined with a surrounding envelope, we performed\npolarized three-dimensional Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations. In\nparticular, we considered polarization due to emission and absorption by\naligned dust grains, and polarization due to scattering of the thermal\nreemission (self-scattering). At wavelengths of 53 $\\mu$m, 89 $\\mu$m, and 155\n$\\mu$m, we were able to reproduce the observed orientation of the polarization\nvectors. Here, the origin of polarization is consistent with polarized emission\nby aligned non-spherical dust grains.

To address these gaps, this study evaluates\nstate-of-the-art affective computing models -- including facial expression\nrecognition, text sentiment analysis, and smile detection -- using videos of\nolder adults interacting with either a person or a virtual avatar. As part of\nthis effort, we introduce a novel dataset featuring Spanish-speaking older\nadults engaged in human-to-human video interviews. Through three comprehensive\nanalyses, we investigate (1) the alignment between human-annotated labels and\nautomatic model outputs, (2) the relationships between model outputs across\ndifferent modalities, and (3) individual variations in emotional signals. Using\nboth the Wizard of Oz (WoZ) dataset and our newly collected dataset, we uncover\nlimited agreement between human annotations and model predictions, weak\nconsistency across modalities, and significant variability among individuals.\nThese findings highlight the shortcomings of generalized emotion perception\nmodels and emphasize the need of incorporating personal variability and\ncultural nuances into future systems.",

It is well-known that a\nconceptually similar S/F/S system is a platform for implementing ultra-strong\nmagnon-photon coupling. Here, we demonstrate that in such S/F/I/F/S\nheterostructure, ultra-strong magnon-magnon coupling between the two F layers\nalso appears. The strength of this interaction is many times greater than the\nstrength of the usual dipole-dipole interaction. It is mediated via Meissner\ncurrents excited in the superconductor layers by the magnon stray fields. The\nstrength of the magnon-magnon coupling is anisotropic, and its anisotropy is\nopposite to the anisotropy of the magnon-photon coupling, which allows them to\nbe separated. Both couplings become much stronger when the temperature drops\nbelow the critical temperature of the superconductor layers. It enables the\nimplementation of an efficient tuning of the wavenumber in the S/F/I/F/S\nheterostructures controlled by temperature in a wide range of frequencies.\nOverall, the rich and tunable spectrum of S/F/I/F/S multilayers opens broad\nprospects for their application in magnonics.",

Modeling the pool boiling heat\ntransfer characteristics of these surfaces under varied conditions is essential\nin diverse applications. A new empirical correlation for nucleate boiling on\nmicrochannel structured surfaces has been proposed with the data collected from\nvarious experiments in previous studies since the existing correlations are\nlimited by their accuracy and narrow operating ranges. This study also examines\nvarious Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and Deep Neural Networks (DNN) on the\nmicrochannel structured surfaces dataset to predict the nucleate pool boiling\nHeat Transfer Coefficient (HTC). With the aim to integrate both the ML and\ndomain knowledge, a Physics-Informed Machine Learning Aided Framework (PIMLAF)\nis proposed. The proposed correlation in this study is employed as the prior\nphysics-based model for PIMLAF, and a DNN is employed to model the residuals of\nthe prior model. This hybrid framework achieved the best performance in\ncomparison to the other ML models and DNNs. This framework is able to\ngeneralize well for different datasets because the proposed correlation\nprovides the baseline knowledge of the boiling behavior.

We identify three regimes where\nprocesses are either similar, quantitatively or qualitatively different between\nlow- and high-mass star formation.\n  Similar characteristics can be identified for the turbulent gas properties\nand density structures of the star-forming regions. Many of the observational\ncharacteristics also do not depend that strongly on the environment.\n  Quantitative differences can be found for outflow, infall and accretion rates\nas well as mean column and volume densities. Also the multiplicity\nsignificantly rises from low- to high-mass stars. The importance of the\nmagnetic field for the formation processes appears still less well constrained.\n  Qualitative differences between low- and high-mass star formation relate\nmainly to the radiative and ionizing feedback that occurs almost exclusively in\nregions forming high-mass stars.

This limits\nsubstantially the exploitability of the collected data.

The\nmethodology has been designed to be deployed on top, and enriches the\nfunctionalities of, an existing data collection APP, called iLog, which has\nbeen used in large scale, worldwide data collection experiments.

The disorder is given by a locally finite random graph with\nvertices indexed by the integers that is assumed to be invariant under index\nshifts and augments the nearest-neighbour lattice by additional long-range\nedges. We provide sufficient conditions that imply the existence of a\nsubcritical phase and therefore the non-triviality of the phase transition. Our\nresults apply to instances of scale-free random geometric graphs with any\nintegrable degree distribution. The present work complements previously\ndeveloped techniques to establish the existence of a subcritical phase on\nPoisson--Gilbert graphs and Poisson--Delaunay triangulations (M\\'enard et al.,\nAnn. Sci. \\'Ec. Norm. Sup\\'er., 2016), on Galton--Watson trees (Bhamidi et al.,\nAnn. Probab., 2021) and on locally tree-like random graphs (Nam et al., Trans.\nAm. Math. Soc., 2022), all of which require exponential decay of the degree\ndistribution. Two applications of our approach are particularly noteworthy:\nFirstly, for Gilbert graphs derived from stationary point processes on\n$\\mathbb{R}$ marked with i.i.d. random radii, our results are sharp. We show\nthat there is a non-trivial phase transition if and only if the graph is\nlocally finite. Secondly, for independent Bernoulli long-range percolation on\n$\\mathbb{Z}$, with coupling constants $J_{x,y}\\asymp |x-y|^{-\\delta}$, we\nverify a conjecture of Can (Electron. Commun. Probab., 2015) stating the\nnon-triviality of the phase transition whenever $\\delta>2$. We believe that the\nresults are indicative of the behaviour of contact processes on spatial random\ngraphs also in dimensions $d > 1$ as long as the degree distribution of the\nunderlying network has at least finite $d$-th moment. We support this by\nproving that no phase transition exists if the $d$-th moment is infinite.",

In the weak\nnonlinear regime of our formalism, we demonstrate the ability of the echo peak\nto distinguish between elastic and inelastic scattering processes, in perfect\nagreement with the intuition developed in isolated two-level systems.\nFurthermore, we discuss unique many-body effects on the echo peak signature\narising from interaction induced quantum fluctuations. In particular, we show\nthat these quantum fluctuations induce a finite nonrephasable broadening and\nexamine how the echo peak is influenced by the attractive or repulsive nature\nof the collective excitations.",

This work proposes a novel\napproach to model the active electricity market participation of co-located\nrenewable energy and electrolyzer plants, based on opportunity-cost bidding.\nWhile a renewable energy plant typically has zero marginal cost, selling power\nto the grid carries a potential opportunity-cost of not producing hydrogen when\nit is co-located with a hydrogen electrolyzer. We first consider only the\nelectrolyzer, and derive its revenue of consuming electricity based on the\nnon-convex hydrogen production curve. We then consider the available renewable\nenergy production and form a piece-wise linear cost curve representing the\nopportunity cost of selling (or revenue from consuming) various levels of\nelectricity. This cost curve can be used to model a stand-alone electrolyzer or\na co-located hydrogen and renewable energy plant participating in an\nelectricity market. Our case study analyzes the effects of market-bidding\nelectrolyzers on electricity markets and grid operations. We compare two\nstrategies for a co-located electrolyzer-wind plant; one based on the proposed\nbid curve and one with a more conventional fixed electrolyzer consumption. The\nresults show that electrolyzers that actively participate in the electricity\nmarket lower the average cost of electricity and the amount of curtailed\nrenewable energy in the system compared with a fixed consumption case. However,\nthe difference in total system emissions between the two strategies is\ninsignificant. The specific impacts vary based on electrolyzer capacity and\nhydrogen price, which determines the location of the co-located plant in the\nelectricity market merit order.",

Skeleton data are typically transmitted to cloud servers\nfor action recognition, with results returned to clients via Apps/APIs.\nHowever, the vulnerability of skeletal models against adversarial perturbations\ngradually reveals the unreliability of these systems. Existing black-box\nattacks all operate in a decision-based manner, resulting in numerous queries\nthat hinder efficiency and feasibility in real-world applications. Moreover,\nall attacks off the shelf focus on only restricted perturbations, while\nignoring model weaknesses when encountered with non-semantic perturbations. In\nthis paper, we propose two query-effIcient Skeletal Adversarial AttaCks,\nISAAC-K and ISAAC-N. As a black-box attack, ISAAC-K utilizes Grad-CAM in a\nsurrogate model to extract key joints where minor sparse perturbations are then\nadded to fool the classifier. To guarantee natural adversarial motions, we\nintroduce constraints of both bone length and temporal consistency. ISAAC-K\nfinds stronger adversarial examples on $\\ell_\\infty$ norm, which can encompass\nthose on other norms. Exhaustive experiments substantiate that ISAAC-K can\nuplift the attack efficiency of the perturbations under 10 skeletal models.\nAdditionally, as a byproduct, ISAAC-N fools the classifier by replacing\nskeletons unrelated to the action. We surprisingly find that skeletal models\nare vulnerable to large perturbations where the part-wise non-semantic joints\nare just replaced, leading to a query-free no-box attack without any prior\nknowledge. Based on that, four adaptive defenses are eventually proposed to\nimprove the robustness of skeleton recognition models.",

The\nframework is trained and evaluated on the PLAID dataset, and achieved a\nclassification accuracy of 90% while maintaining low computational requirements\nand a latency of less than one second.",

    "abstract": "When treating moving tumors, the precise delivery of proton therapy by pencil\nbeam scanning (PBS) is challenged by the interplay effect. Although several\n4D-optimization methods have been proposed, what is the most beneficial motion\nmanagement technique is still an open question. In this study, we wish to\ninvestigate the dosimetric impact of re-optimizing the PBS spot weights during\nthe treatment delivery in response to, and in anticipation of, variations in\nthe patient's breathing pattern. We simulate for PBS the implementation of a\nreal-time adaptive framework based on principles from receding horizon control.\nWe consider the patient motion as characterized by a one-dimensional amplitude\nsignal and a 4DCT, to simulate breathing of variable frequency. The framework\ntracks the signal and predicts the future motion with uncertainty increasing\nwith the length of the prediction horizon. After each delivered energy layer,\nthe framework re-optimizes the spot weights of the next layer based on the\ndelivered dose and the predicted motion. For three lung patients, we generate\n500 variable breathing patterns to evaluate the dosimetric results of the\nframework and compare them to those of implementations of previously proposed\nnon-adaptive methods. Compared to the best non-adaptive method, the adaptive\nframework improves the CTV D98 in the near-worst breathing scenario (5th\npercentile), from 96.4 to 98.9 % of the prescribed dose and considerably\nreduces the variation as measured by a mean decrease in the inter-quartile\nrange by more than 80 %. The target coverage improvements are achieved without\ngenerally compromising target dose homogeneity or OAR dose. The study indicates\nthat a motion-adaptive approach based on re-optimization of spot weights during\ndelivery has the potential to substantially improve the dosimetric performance\nof PBS given fast and accurate models of patient motion.",

Individuals reproduce at random times independently of each\nother but die at a rate which increases with the population size. When\nindividuals reproduce, they produce a random number of offspring, drawn\naccording to some probability distribution on the natural integers. We keep\ntrack of the number of descendants of the initial individuals by adding neutral\nmarkers to the individuals, which are inherited by one's offspring. We then\nconsider several scaling limits of the measure-valued process describing the\ndistribution of neutral markers in the population, as well as the population\nsize, when the competition parameter tends to zero. Three regimes emerge,\ndepending on the tail of the offspring distribution. When the offspring\ndistribution admits a second moment (actually a $ 2+\\delta $ moment for some\npositive $ \\delta $), the fluctuations of the population size around its\ncarrying capacity are small and the neutral types asymptotically follow a\nFleming-Viot process. When the offspring distribution has a power-law decay\nwith exponent $ \\alpha \\in (1,2) $, the population size remains most of the\ntime close to its carrying capacity with some (short-lived) fluctuations, and\nthe neutral types evolve in the limit according to a generalised $ \\Lambda\n$-Fleming-Viot process. When the exponent $ \\alpha $ is equal to 1, the time\nscale of the fluctuations changes drastically, as well as the order of\nmagnitude of the population size. In that case the limiting dynamics of the\nneutral markers is given by the dual of the Bolthausen-Sznitman coalescent.",

While often unintentional, misspellings have become\nubiquitous in digital communication, especially with the proliferation of Web\n2.0, user-generated content, and informal text mediums such as social media,\nblogs, and forums. Even if humans can generally interpret misspelled text, NLP\nmodels frequently struggle to handle it: this causes a decline in performance\nin common tasks like text classification and machine translation. In this\npaper, we reconstruct a history of misspellings as a scientific problem. We\nthen discuss the latest advancements to address the challenge of misspellings\nin NLP. Main strategies to mitigate the effect of misspellings include data\naugmentation, double step, character-order agnostic, and tuple-based methods,\namong others. This survey also examines dedicated data challenges and\ncompetitions to spur progress in the field. Critical safety and ethical\nconcerns are also examined, for example, the voluntary use of misspellings to\ninject malicious messages and hate speech on social networks. Furthermore, the\nsurvey explores psycholinguistic perspectives on how humans process\nmisspellings, potentially informing innovative computational techniques for\ntext normalization and representation. Finally, the misspelling-related\nchallenges and opportunities associated with modern large language models are\nalso analyzed, including benchmarks, datasets, and performances of the most\nprominent language models against misspellings. This survey aims to be an\nexhaustive resource for researchers seeking to mitigate the impact of\nmisspellings in the rapidly evolving landscape of NLP.",

In\nthis paper, we aim to study the combined behaviour of hydrodynamically\ninteracting chiral rotors in the presence of an external chemical gradient.\nWhile a single isolated rotor is stationary in a fluid, a pair of rotors can\nmove in linear or circular paths as they hydrodynamically interact with each\nother. It is observed that the emergent linear or circular trajectories depend\non the type of rotors and the orientation of their rotation axes. The dynamics\nof the rotors are altered in a more complex environment, such as in an external\nchemical field. Interestingly, we observe two types of motion: chemotaxis and\nanti-chemotaxis. While in the anti-chemotaxis case, both rotors are driving\naway from the target, in the chemotaxis case, one of the rotors successfully\nreaches the chemical target.

In this paper, we further advance the\nunderstanding of ICL by demonstrating that transformers can perform full\nBayesian inference for commonly used statistical models in context. More\nspecifically, we introduce a general framework that builds on ideas from prior\nfitted networks and continuous normalizing flows and enables us to infer\ncomplex posterior distributions for models such as generalized linear models\nand latent factor models. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets\ndemonstrate that our ICL approach yields posterior samples that are similar in\nquality to state-of-the-art MCMC or variational inference methods that do not\noperate in context.

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the algebraic and dynamical properties of the twisted\ncocycle, a $\\mathrm{GL}(d, \\mathbb{C})$-valued cocycle defined over the toral\nextension of the Zorich (Rauzy-Veech) renormalization for interval exchange\ntransformations (IET). As a natural generalization of the Zorich cocycle, the\ntwisted cocycle plays a central role in studying the asymptotic growth of\ntwisted Birkhoff sums which in turn provide a suitable tool for obtaining fine\nspectral information about IETs and translation flows such as the local\ndimension of spectral measures and quantitative weak mixing. Although it shares\nsimilarities with the classical (untwisted) Zorich cocycle, structural\ndifferences make its analysis more challenging. Our results yield a block-form\ndecomposition into invariant and covariant subbundles allowing us to\ndemonstrate the existence of $\\kappa+1$ zero exponents with respect to a large\nclass of natural invariant measures where $\\kappa$ is an explicit integer\ndepending on the permutation. We establish the symmetry of the Lyapunov\nspectrum by showing the existence of a family of non-degenerate invariant\nsymplectic forms. As a corollary, we prove that for rotation-type permutations,\nthe twisted cocycle has a degenerate Lyapunov spectrum with respect to certain\nnatural ergodic invariant measures in contrast with the higher genus case where\nthe existence of at least one positive Lyapunov exponent is guaranteed by\nprevious work of the authors. In the appendix, we apply our result about the\ninvariant section to substitution systems and prove the pure singularity of the\nspectrum for a substantially large class of substitutions on two letters, while\ngreatly simplifying the proof for some systems previously known to have this\nproperty.",

    "abstract": "The uncertainty principle guarantees a non-zero value for the positional\nuncertainty, $\\left\\langle \\Delta x^2\\right\\rangle > 0$, even without thermal\nfluctuations. This implies that quantum fluctuations inherently enhance\npositional uncertainty at zero temperature. A natural question then arises:\nwhat happens at finite temperatures, where the interplay between quantum and\nthermal fluctuations may give rise to complex and intriguing behaviors? To\naddress this question, we systematically investigate the positional\nuncertainty, $\\left\\langle\\Delta x^2\\right\\rangle$, of a particle in\nequilibrium confined within a nonlinear potential of the form $V(x) \\propto\nx^n$, where $n = 2, 4, 6, \\dots$ represents an even exponent. Using path\nintegral Monte Carlo simulations, we calculate $\\left\\langle\\Delta\nx^2\\right\\rangle$ in equilibrium as a function of the thermal de Broglie\nwavelength $\\Lambda$. Interestingly, for large values of $n$,\n$\\left\\langle\\Delta x^2\\right\\rangle$ exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on\n$\\Lambda$: it initially decreases with increasing $\\Lambda$ at small $\\Lambda$\nbut increases at larger $\\Lambda$. To further understand this behavior, we\nemploy a semiclassical approximation, which reveals that quantum fluctuations\ncan reduce positional uncertainty for small $\\Lambda$ when the nonlinearity of\nthe potential is sufficiently strong. Finally, we discuss the potential\nimplications of this result for many-body phenomena driven by strong nonlinear\ninteractions, such as glass transitions, where the transition densities exhibit\na similar non-monotonic dependence on $\\Lambda$.",

    "abstract": "Variable selection plays a crucial role in enhancing modeling effectiveness\nacross diverse fields, addressing the challenges posed by high-dimensional\ndatasets of correlated variables. This work introduces a novel approach namely\nKnockoff with over-parameterization (Knoop) to enhance Knockoff filters for\nvariable selection. Specifically, Knoop first generates multiple knockoff\nvariables for each original variable and integrates them with the original\nvariables into an over-parameterized Ridgeless regression model. For each\noriginal variable, Knoop evaluates the coefficient distribution of its\nknockoffs and compares these with the original coefficients to conduct an\nanomaly-based significance test, ensuring robust variable selection. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate superior performance compared to existing methods in\nboth simulation and real-world datasets. Knoop achieves a notably higher Area\nunder the Curve (AUC) of the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve for\neffectively identifying relevant variables against the ground truth by\ncontrolled simulations, while showcasing enhanced predictive accuracy across\ndiverse regression and classification tasks. The analytical results further\nbackup our observations.",

    "abstract": "DDO68-V1 is a Luminous Blue Variable (LBV) star in the eXtremely Metal-Poor\n(XMP) galaxy DDO68. It resides in the HII region with 12+log(O/H)~7.1 dex, or Z\n~ Zo/40. Since DDO68-V1 is the only known LBV with a so low initial\nmetallicity, its in-deep study can give the hints for understanding the LBV\nevolutionary stage and the nature of their powerful and highly variable mass\nloss in the very low-metallicity regime. Our goal is to study the optical\nvariability of DDO68-V1 during the last 36 years, with the emphasis on the\nperiod of the last 8 years, after the LBV giant eruption. We use our published\nresults of monitoring in B, V, R bands of the total flux of HII region 'Knot\n3', containing the LBV, along with photometry of the archive Hubble Space\nTelescope (HST) images, obtained in May 2010 and December 2017. This data allow\nus to disentangle the variable light of DDO68-V1 and that of the underlying HII\nregion. From all available photometry of Knot 3, we derive the V-band\nlightcurve of DDO68-V1 since 1988, with a higher cadence during the years\n2015-2023, when the lightcurve resembles that of S Doradus. The new data reveal\nthe full range of DDO68-V1 absolute magnitudes M_V of [-5.9, --10.8] mag. The\nLBV variations after the fading of the 'giant eruption' show the unusually\nlarge amplitude of delta_V > 3.0-3.5mag on the time-scale of ~1-1.5 year. The\napparent changes of the integrated B-V colour of Knot 3 are consistent with the\nexpected colour variations of the LBV in course of the S Doradus 'normal\neruptions'. These data, along with spectra of DDO68-V1, demonstrate the need\nfor a higher-cadence photometry of DDO68-V1, in order to probe the possible\nperiodicity in its lightcurve and binarity of the object.",

However,\nin the deep-UV spectral range (<280 nm) these emitters exhibit very low quantum\nefficiencies, which in part is linked to the light polarization characteristics\nof (Al,Ga)N quantum wells (QWs). In this study we provide insight into the\ndegree of optical polarization of (Al,Ga)N QW systems operating across the UV-C\nspectral range by means of an atomistic, multi-band electronic structure model.\nOur model not only captures the difference in valence band ordering in AlN and\nGaN, it accounts also for alloy disorder induced band mixing effects\noriginating from random alloy fluctuations in (Al,Ga)N QWs. The latter aspect\nis not captured in widely employed continuum based models. The impact of alloy\ndisorder on the electronic structure is studied in terms of Urbach tail\nenergies, which reflect the broadening of the valence band density of states\ndue to carrier localization effects. We find that especially in wider wells,\nUrbach tail energies are reduced with increasing carrier densities in the well,\nhighlighting that alloy disorder induced carrier localization effects in\n(Al,Ga)N QWs are also tightly linked to electrostatic built-in fields. Our\ncalculations show that for QWs designed to emit at the longer wavelength end of\nthe UV-C spectrum, carrier density and well width are of secondary importance\nfor their light emission properties, meaning that one observes mainly\ntransverse electrical polarization. However, for (Al,Ga)N QWs with high Al\ncontents, we find that both well width and carrier density will impact the\ndegree of optical polarization.

Understanding\nhow information flows from molecular interactions to cellular processes and\ntissue organization during development is crucial for explaining the remarkable\nreproducibility of complex organisms. This review explores how\nchromatin-encoded information is transduced from localized transcriptional\nevents to global gene expression patterns, highlighting the challenge of\nbridging these scales. We discuss recent experimental findings and theoretical\nframeworks, emphasizing polymer physics as a tool for describing the\nrelationship between chromatin structure and dynamics across scales.

They might play an important dynamic and diagnostic role for the Sun.\nThis work aims to assess the validity of simplifying assumptions in the\nequation of continuity, which have often been used in the linear models of\nsolar inertial modes. We compute the linear eigenmodes of the Sun's convection\nzone in the inertial frequency range using the Dedalus code. This single\nframework enables us to compare the sensitivity of the modes to different model\nsetups, such as the compressible setup and the Boussinesq and anelastic\napproximations. We consider both the cases of uniform rotation and solar\ndifferential rotation (as given by helioseismology). We find that the\ncompressible and anelastic models have almost identical eigenmodes under\nuniform rotation and solar differential rotation. On the other hand, the\nabsence of density stratification in the Boussinesq model results in\nsignificantly different eigenmodes under these setups. The differences are most\nprominent for the non-toroidal modes with significant radial motions mainly due\nto the absence of the compressional $\\beta$ effect. The anelastic approximation\nsimplifies the calculations and reduces the numerical cost without affecting\nthe solar inertial modes. The Boussinesq or incompressible approximations\ncannot be used to model the solar inertial modes accurately. Given the strong\ninfluence of differential rotation on the eigenmodes, an acceptable setup is to\nuse the anelastic approximation together with the solar differential rotation.",

We\nuse the virial expansion to account for nuclear interaction effects. We focus\non the region of validity of the expansion, which reaches $10^{-3}$ fm$^{-3}$\nat $T=5$ MeV up to almost saturation density at $T=50$ MeV. In pure neutron\nmatter, we find an analytical expression for the thermal index, and show that\nit is nearly density- and temperature-independent, within a fraction of a\npercent of the non-interacting, non-relativistic value of $\\Gamma_\\text{th}\n\\approx 5/3$. When we incorporate protons, electrons and photons, we find that\nthe density and temperature dependence of the thermal index changes\nsignificantly. We predict a smooth transition between an electron-dominated\nregime with $\\Gamma_\\text{th} \\approx 4/3$ at low densities to a\nneutron-dominated region with $\\Gamma_\\text{th} \\approx 5/3$ at high densities.\nThis behavior is by and large independent of proton fraction and is not\naffected by nuclear interactions in the region where the virial expansion\nconverges. We model this smooth transition analytically and provide a simple\nbut accurate parametrization of the inflection point between these regimes.\nWhen compared to tabulated realistic models of the thermal index, we find an\noverall agreement at high temperatures that weakens for colder matter. The\ndiscrepancies can be attributed to the missing contributions of nuclear\nclusters.

A low-rank strategy is used to reduce the\ncomplexity of parameters in learning hypergraph structures, while a\nGumbel-Softmax-based sampling strategy optimizes the patch distribution across\nhyperedges. An MIL aggregator is then used to derive a graph-level embedding\nfor comprehensive WSI analysis.

Our research revealed an unexpected pattern of substantial Tor\nnetwork traffic targeting cloudless IoT devices. suggesting that attackers are\nusing Tor to anonymously exploit undisclosed vulnerabilities (possibly obtained\nfrom underground markets). To delve deeper into this phenomenon, we developed\nTORCHLIGHT, a tool designed to detect both known and unknown threats targeting\ncloudless IoT devices by analyzing Tor traffic. TORCHLIGHT filters traffic via\nspecific IP patterns, strategically deploys virtual private server (VPS) nodes\nfor cost-effective detection, and uses a chain-of-thought (CoT) process with\nlarge language models (LLMs) for accurate threat identification.\n  Our results are significant: for the first time, we have demonstrated that\nattackers are indeed using Tor to conceal their identities while targeting\ncloudless IoT devices.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a continuous-time stochastic dynamical framework for\nunderstanding how large language models (LLMs) may self-amplify latent biases\nor toxicity through their own chain-of-thought reasoning. The model posits an\ninstantaneous \"severity\" variable $x(t) \\in [0,1]$ evolving under a stochastic\ndifferential equation (SDE) with a drift term $\\mu(x)$ and diffusion\n$\\sigma(x)$. Crucially, such a process can be consistently analyzed via the\nFokker--Planck approach if each incremental step behaves nearly Markovian in\nseverity space. The analysis investigates critical phenomena, showing that\ncertain parameter regimes create phase transitions from subcritical\n(self-correcting) to supercritical (runaway severity). The paper derives\nstationary distributions, first-passage times to harmful thresholds, and\nscaling laws near critical points. Finally, it highlights implications for\nagents and extended LLM reasoning models: in principle, these equations might\nserve as a basis for formal verification of whether a model remains stable or\npropagates bias over repeated inferences.",

    "abstract": "Accurate prediction of future trajectories of traffic agents is essential for\nensuring safe autonomous driving. However, partially observed trajectories can\nsignificantly degrade the performance of even state-of-the-art models. Previous\napproaches often rely on knowledge distillation to transfer features from fully\nobserved trajectories to partially observed ones. This involves firstly\ntraining a fully observed model and then using a distillation process to create\nthe final model. While effective, they require multi-stage training, making the\ntraining process very expensive. Moreover, knowledge distillation can lead to a\nperformance degradation of the model. In this paper, we introduce a\nTarget-driven Self-Distillation method (TSD) for motion forecasting. Our method\nleverages predicted accurate targets to guide the model in making predictions\nunder partial observation conditions. By employing self-distillation, the model\nlearns from the feature distributions of both fully observed and partially\nobserved trajectories during a single end-to-end training process. This\nenhances the model's ability to predict motion accurately in both fully\nobserved and partially observed scenarios. We evaluate our method on multiple\ndatasets and state-of-the-art motion forecasting models. Extensive experimental\nresults demonstrate that our approach achieves significant performance\nimprovements in both settings.

Few-shot\nlearning is a suitable learning paradigm in such scenarios due to its ability\nto adapt to a new task with limited supervision (small training budget).\nExisting few-shot semantic segmentation (FSSS) methods fix the number of target\nclasses. Therefore, they do not support joint training on multiple datasets\nvarying in the number of classes. In the context of the interpretation of\nseismic facies, fixing the number of target classes inhibits the generalization\ncapability of a model trained on one facies dataset to another, which is likely\nto have a different number of facies. To address this shortcoming, we propose a\nfew-shot semantic segmentation method for interpreting seismic facies that can\nadapt to the varying number of facies across the dataset, dubbed the AdaSemSeg.\nIn general, the backbone network of FSSS methods is initialized with the\nstatistics learned from the ImageNet dataset for better performance. The lack\nof such a huge annotated dataset for seismic images motivates using a\nself-supervised algorithm on seismic datasets to initialize the backbone\nnetwork. We have trained the AdaSemSeg on three public seismic facies datasets\nwith different numbers of facies and evaluated the proposed method on multiple\nmetrics.

After\ncorrecting for extinction and completeness, we model the stellar density\ndistribution and confirm the presence of an elongation with an eccentricity of\n$0.71$. The eccentricity decreases slightly with increasing mass. We fit the\nradial profile with the Elson, Fall, and Freeman model, observing a decrease in\nthe core radius with increasing mass, indicative of weak but detectable mass\nsegregation. This finding is further supported by a measured mass segregation\nratio of $\\Lambda_\\mathrm{\\rm MSR}=1.11\\pm0.11$, only above $1$ by $1\\sigma$,\nand slightly shorter minimum spanning tree length for higher mass bins. The\ncluster has a 1D velocity dispersion of $3.42 \\pm\n0.10~\\mathrm{km}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, suggesting it is subvirial.

The proposed SSF-PAN can\nachieve the functionalities of LiDAR point cloud based object\ndetection/localization and SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) with\nhigh computational efficiency and accuracy, enabling map-free navigation\nframeworks. The novelty of this work is threefold: 1) developing a neural\nnetwork which can achieve segmentation among static and dynamic objects within\nthe scene flows with different motion features, that is, semantic scene flow\n(SSF); 2) developing an iterative framework which can further optimize the\nquality of input scene flows and output segmentation results; 3) developing a\nscene flow-based navigation platform which can test the performance of the SSF\nperception system in the simulation environment. The proposed SSF-PAN method is\nvalidated using the SUScape-CARLA and the KITTI datasets, as well as on the\nCARLA simulator. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach\noutperforms traditional methods in terms of scene flow computation accuracy,\nmoving object detection accuracy, computational efficiency, and autonomous\nnavigation effectiveness.",

The primary\nchallenge in next-frame prediction lies in effectively capturing and processing\nboth spatial and temporal information from previous video sequences. The\ntransformer architecture, known for its prowess in handling sequence data, has\nmade remarkable progress in this domain. However, transformer-based next-frame\nprediction models face notable issues: (a) The multi-head self-attention (MHSA)\nmechanism requires the input embedding to be split into $N$ chunks, where $N$\nis the number of heads. Each segment captures only a fraction of the original\nembeddings information, which distorts the representation of the embedding in\nthe latent space, resulting in a semantic dilution problem; (b) These models\npredict the embeddings of the next frames rather than the frames themselves,\nbut the loss function based on the errors of the reconstructed frames, not the\npredicted embeddings -- this creates a discrepancy between the training\nobjective and the model output. We propose a Semantic Concentration Multi-Head\nSelf-Attention (SCMHSA) architecture, which effectively mitigates semantic\ndilution in transformer-based next-frame prediction. Additionally, we introduce\na loss function that optimizes SCMHSA in the latent space, aligning the\ntraining objective more closely with the model output.

We first construct a hate speech\ndataset of 7,838 samples generated by six widely-used LLMs covering 34 identity\ngroups, with meticulous annotations by three labelers. We then assess the\neffectiveness of eight representative hate speech detectors on the\nLLM-generated dataset. Our results show that while detectors are generally\neffective in identifying LLM-generated hate speech, their performance degrades\nwith newer versions of LLMs. We also reveal the potential of LLM-driven hate\ncampaigns, a new threat that LLMs bring to the field of hate speech detection.\nBy leveraging advanced techniques like adversarial attacks and model stealing\nattacks, the adversary can intentionally evade the detector and automate hate\ncampaigns online. The most potent adversarial attack achieves an attack success\nrate of 0.966, and its attack efficiency can be further improved by\n$13-21\\times$ through model stealing attacks with acceptable attack\nperformance.

In addition, we propose\nanother RPE method called Log-PE, which combines the logarithmic form of the\nrelative distance matrix directly into the spiking attention map. Furthermore,\nwe extend our RPE methods to a two-dimensional form, making them suitable for\nprocessing image patches.

Using\nfirst-principles calculations, we predict a remarkable strain-induced\nenhancement of second-harmonic generation (SHG) in the high-performance 2D\nsemiconductors Bi$_2$O$_2$X (X = S, Se, Te). The SHG susceptibilities of\nBi$_2$O$_2$X under strain are on the order of 1~nm/V, rivalling the highest\nvalues reported among 2D materials. This giant SHG response originates from\ngauge-invariant geometric quantities, including the quantum metric, shift\nvector, and triple phase product. The strain also induces a bandgap variation\nin Bi$_2$O$_2$X. Intriguingly, in Bi$_2$O$_2$Te, strain-induced bandgap tuning\ndrives a transition from a semiconductor to a half-metal, and ultimately to a\npolar metal.

Specifically, we introduce a pioneering training\nframework under diffusion models that brings two key innovations. First, we\nconvert 3D structural priors derived from the initial 3D point cloud as a bound\nterm to increase evidence in the variational Bayesian framework, leveraging\nthese robust intrinsic priors to tightly govern the diffusion training process\nand bolster consistency in reconstruction. Second, we extract and incorporate\n2D priors from the single input image, projecting them onto the 3D point cloud\nto enrich the guidance for diffusion training. Our framework not only sidesteps\npotential model learning shifts that may arise from directly imposing\nadditional constraints during training but also precisely transposes the 2D\npriors into the 3D domain.

    "abstract": "Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have been widely applied to multi-objective\noptimization due to their population-based nature. Population update, a key\ncomponent in multi-objective EAs (MOEAs), is usually performed in a greedy,\ndeterministic manner. However, recent studies have questioned this practice and\nshown that stochastic population update (SPU), which allows inferior solutions\nhave a chance to be preserved, can help MOEAs jump out of local optima more\neasily. Nevertheless, SPU risks losing high-quality solutions, potentially\nrequiring a large population. Intuitively, a possible solution to this issue is\nto introduce an archive that stores the best solutions ever found. In this\npaper, we theoretically show that using an archive allows a small population\nand may enhance the search performance of SPU-based MOEAs. We examine two\nclassic algorithms, SMS-EMOA and NSGA-II, on the bi-objective problem\nOneJumpZeroJump, and prove that using an archive can reduce the expected\nrunning time upper bound (even exponentially). The comparison between SMS-EMOA\nand NSGA-II also suggests that the $(\\mu+\\mu)$ update mode may be more suitable\nfor SPU than the $(\\mu+1)$ update mode. We also validate our findings\nempirically. We hope this work may provide theoretical support to explore\ndifferent ideas of designing algorithms in evolutionary multi-objective\noptimization.",

Meanwhile, a behavior policy is learned jointly\nwith PIWM. It is trained in PIWM's imagination and effectively navigates in the\nurban driving scenes leveraging intention-aware latent states.

To address these challenges, we propose a novel Block\nmatrix-based low-rank adaptation framework, called Block-LoRA, for fine-tuning\nVLMs on downstream few-shot tasks. Inspired by recent work on Low-Rank\nAdaptation (LoRA), Block-LoRA partitions the original low-rank decomposition\nmatrix of LoRA into a series of sub-matrices while sharing all down-projection\nsub-matrices. This structure not only reduces the number of training\nparameters, but also transforms certain complex matrix multiplication\noperations into simpler matrix addition, significantly lowering the\ncomputational cost of fine-tuning. Notably, Block-LoRA enables fine-tuning CLIP\non the ImageNet few-shot benchmark using a single 24GB GPU. We also show that\nBlock-LoRA has the more tighter bound of generalization error than vanilla\nLoRA. Without bells and whistles, extensive experiments demonstrate that\nBlock-LoRA achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art\nCLIP-based few-shot methods, while maintaining a low training parameters count\nand reduced computational overhead.",

To realize this goal, the adaptation of DM should be possible to model\nthe specified motion concept, without compromising the ability to generate\ndiverse appearances. Thus, the key to solving this problem lies in how to\nseparate the motion concept from the appearance in the adaptation process of\nDM. Typical previous works explore different ways to represent and insert a\nmotion concept into large-scale pretrained text-to-video diffusion models,\ne.g., learning a motion LoRA, using latent noise residuals, etc. While those\nmethods can encode the motion concept, they also inevitably encode the\nappearance in the reference videos, resulting in weakened appearance generation\ncapability. In this paper, we follow the typical way to learn a motion LoRA to\nencode the motion concept, but propose two novel strategies to enhance\nmotion-appearance separation, including temporal attention purification (TAP)\nand appearance highway (AH). Specifically, we assume that in the temporal\nattention module, the pretrained Value embeddings are sufficient to serve as\nbasic components needed by producing a new motion. Thus, in TAP, we choose only\nto reshape the temporal attention with motion LoRAs so that Value embeddings\ncan be reorganized to produce a new motion. Further, in AH, we alter the\nstarting point of each skip connection in U-Net from the output of each\ntemporal attention module to the output of each spatial attention module.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that compared to previous works, our method\ncan generate videos with appearance more aligned with the text descriptions and\nmotion more consistent with the reference videos.",

We adopt a model-based\napproach for nonrigid motion correction, addressing two challenges: (a) motion\nrepresentation and (b) motion estimation. For motion representation, we derive\nimage-space gridding by adapting the nonuniform fast Fourier transform (NUFFT)\nto represent and compute nonrigid motion, which provides an exact\nforward-adjoint pair of linear operators. We then introduce nonrigid SENSE\noperators that incorporate nonrigid motion into the multi-coil MR acquisition\nmodel.

During each heartbeat, data are acquired along two\ntypes of non-Cartesian trajectories: a subset of a high-resolution trajectory\nthat sparsely covers 3D k-space, followed by a full low-resolution trajectory.\nWe reconstruct 3D iNAVs for each heartbeat using the full low-resolution data,\nwhich are then used to estimate bulk motion and identify the respiratory phase\nof each heartbeat.

    "abstract": "The R package bsvarSIGNs implements state-of-the-art algorithms for the\nBayesian analysis of Structural Vector Autoregressions identified by sign,\nzero, and narrative restrictions. It offers fast and efficient estimation\nthanks to the deployment of frontier econometric and numerical techniques and\nalgorithms written in C++. The core model is based on a flexible Vector\nAutoregression with estimated hyper-parameters of the Minnesota prior and the\ndummy observation priors. The structural model can be identified by sign, zero,\nand narrative restrictions, including a novel solution, making it possible to\nuse the three types of restrictions at once. The package facilitates predictive\nand structural analyses using impulse responses, forecast error variance and\nhistorical decompositions, forecasting and conditional forecasting, as well as\nanalyses of structural shocks and fitted values. All this is complemented by\ncolourful plots, user-friendly summary functions, and comprehensive\ndocumentation.

A\nmulti-wavelength analysis using X-ray, optical, and IR data, mostly taken in\nits quiescent phase, was conducted to identify the origin of NuSTAR\nJ230059+5857.4 and elucidate the phenomena associated with the flare activity.\nThe results indicated that NuSTAR J230059+5857.4 was a stellar flare that\noccurred on a single M-dwarf, M-dwarf binary, or pre-main-sequence star. NuSTAR\nJ230059+5857.4 exhibited the higher emission measure and higher temperature,\n8.60+2.15/-1.73x10^54 cm^-3 and 8.21+2.71/-1.86 keV, respectively, on average\nthan the nominal values of stellar flares reported in the past. The flare loop\nsize estimated on the basis of the model to balance the plasma and magnetic\npressures was larger than the stellar radius by a factor of several. Since\nbased on solar flare loops, this flare loop scale is excessively large, we\nconjecture that the observed large emission measure is possible to be\nattributed to the observation of mutually-associated multiple flares\nsimultaneously occurring on the stellar surface, known as sympathetic flares.\nThanks to the large effective area of NuSTAR in the hard X-ray band, we can\nconduct detailed discussion about a temperature variation associated with the\nflare. Investigation of the temperature variation during the flare revealed\nthat the temperature remained significantly higher than during the quiescent\nphase even after the count rate dropped to around 5% of the peak. The sustained\nhigh temperature over the long duration is consistent with the idea of\nsympathetic flares. We found that it is essential to use theoretical models to\nevaluate loops and assess temporal changes in temperature as done in this study\nto determine whether there are multiple flares or not when analyzing flare\nobservation data.",

    "abstract": "For photosynthetic systems under irradiation not limited to blackbody\nradiation, this study formulates the ideal efficiency and Boltzmann factor in a\ngeneral form based on energy-entropy flow analysis, assuming zero entropy\ngeneration within the system as the ideal condition. The non-equilibrium\ncontribution between the radiation and system, which increases with the\nabsorption rate and reduces the ideal efficiency, is quantitatively analyzed,\nfirst for monochromatic light. Based on these results, a unified formula for\nthe ideal efficiency of a light-powered system with an absorption rate\n|$\\varepsilon$| for non-monochromatic light diluted with a dilution factor d\nafter being emitted by blackbody radiation at temperature T is derived in the\nmost compact form. This formulation is then extended to include cases wherein\nentropy was discarded from the system via radiation simultaneously with waste\nheat. This leads to a unified reclassification of several previously proposed\nideal efficiencies, such as the Jeter, Spanner, and Petela, as the basis of\npractical efficiency, based on flow conditions. Furthermore, in this study,\nprevious frameworks on light-powered systems are classified into\npiston-cylinder (closed photon gas) and flowing radiation (open photon gas)\nmodels, demonstrating that the latter better suits microscopic light-powered\nsystems. Finally, two issues related to the ideal efficiency derived from the\nprior flowing radiation model (Landsberg and Tonge, 1980), often referred to as\nthe Landsberg limit, have been resolved using a simplified mathematical model\nconstructed in this study based on Einstein's absorption and radiation theory.\nThe ideal efficiency obtained is found to be very similar to Carnot efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Deep extragalactic X-ray surveys, such as the Chandra COSMOS-Legacy field\n(CCLS), are prone to be biased against active galactic nuclei (AGN) with high\ncolumn densities due to their lower count rates at a given luminosity. To\nquantify this selection effect, we forward model nearby ($z\\sim0.05$) AGN from\nthe BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey (BASS) with well-characterized ($\\gtrsim$1000\ncts) broadband X-ray spectra (0.5-195 keV) to simulate the CCLS absorption\ndistribution. We utilize the BASS low-redshift analogs with similar\nluminosities to the CCLS ($L_\\mathrm{2-10\\ keV}^\\mathrm{int}\\sim10^{42-45}\\\n\\mathrm{erg}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$), which are much less affected by obscuration\nand low-count statistics, as the seed for our simulations, and follow the\nspectral fitting of the CCLS. Our simulations reveal that Chandra would fail to\ndetect the majority (53.3%; 563/1056) of obscured ($N_\\mathrm{H}>10^{22}\\\n\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$) simulated BASS AGN given the observed redshift and\nluminosity distribution of the CCLS. Even for detected sources with sufficient\ncounts ($\\geq30$) for spectral modeling, the level of obscuration is\nsignificantly overestimated. This bias is most extreme for objects whose best\nfit indicates a high-column density AGN ($N_\\mathrm{H}\\geq10^{24}\\\n\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$), since the majority (66.7%; 18/27) of these are actually\nunobscured sources ($N_\\mathrm{H}<10^{22}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$). This implies\nthat previous studies may have significantly overestimated the increase in the\nobscured fraction with redshift and the fraction of luminous obscured AGN. Our\nfindings highlight the importance of directly considering obscuration biases\nand forward modeling in X-ray surveys, as well as the need for\nhigher-sensitivity X-ray missions such as the Advanced X-ray Imaging Satellite\n(AXIS), and the importance of multi-wavelength indicators to estimate\nobscuration in distant supermassive black holes.",

    "abstract": "3D vision and spatial reasoning have long been recognized as preferable for\naccurately perceiving our three-dimensional world, especially when compared\nwith traditional visual reasoning based on 2D images. Due to the difficulties\nin collecting high-quality 3D data, research in this area has only recently\ngained momentum. With the advent of powerful large language models (LLMs),\nmulti-modal LLMs for 3D vision have been developed over the past few years.\nHowever, most of these models focus primarily on the vision encoder for 3D\ndata. In this paper, we propose converting existing densely activated LLMs into\nmixture-of-experts (MoE) models, which have proven effective for multi-modal\ndata processing. In addition to leveraging these models' instruction-following\ncapabilities, we further enable embodied task planning by attaching a diffusion\nhead, Pose-DiT, that employs a novel rectified flow diffusion scheduler.\nExperimental results on 3D question answering and task-planning tasks\ndemonstrate that our 3D-MoE framework achieves improved performance with fewer\nactivated parameters.",

Hence, the latitudinal distribution of\nactive regions (LDAR) of stars is ambiguous and controversial, mainly due to\nthe limit of the current technique for spatially resolving the stellar surface.\nFast rotating stars, which are young and active, are thought to operate with a\ndifferent dynamo process than the Sun.

It plays a crucial role in understanding 3D scenes and has great\npotential for various applications, such as robotic vision perception and\nautonomous driving. Many existing works utilize planar-based representations\nsuch as Bird's Eye View (BEV) and Tri-Perspective View (TPV). These\nrepresentations aim to simplify the complexity of 3D scenes while preserving\nessential object information, thereby facilitating efficient scene\nrepresentation. However, in dense indoor environments with prevalent\nocclusions, directly applying these planar-based methods often leads to\ndifficulties in capturing global semantic occupancy, ultimately degrading model\nperformance. In this paper, we present a new vertical slice representation that\ndivides the scene along the vertical axis and projects spatial point features\nonto the nearest pair of parallel planes. To utilize these slice features, we\npropose SliceOcc, an RGB camera-based model specifically tailored for indoor 3D\nsemantic occupancy prediction. SliceOcc utilizes pairs of slice queries and\ncross-attention mechanisms to extract planar features from input images. These\nlocal planar features are then fused to form a global scene representation,\nwhich is employed for indoor occupancy prediction. Experimental results on the\nEmbodiedScan dataset demonstrate that SliceOcc achieves a mIoU of 15.45% across\n81 indoor categories, setting a new state-of-the-art performance among RGB\ncamera-based models for indoor 3D semantic occupancy prediction.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a quadrature-free, data-driven approach to balanced\ntruncation for both continuous-time and discrete-time systems. The method\nnon-intrusively constructs reduced-order models using available transfer\nfunction samples from the right half of the $s$-plane. It is highlighted that\nthe proposed data-driven balanced truncation and existing quadrature-based\nbalanced truncation algorithms share a common feature: both compress their\nrespective data quadruplets to derive reduced-order models. Additionally, it is\ndemonstrated that by using different compression strategies, these quadruplets\ncan be utilized to develop three data-driven formulations of the IRKA for both\ncontinuous-time and discrete-time systems. These formulations non-intrusively\ngenerate reduced models using transfer function samples from the $j\\omega$-axis\nor the right half of the $s$-plane, or impulse response samples. Notably, these\nIRKA formulations eliminate the necessity of computing new transfer function\nsamples as IRKA iteratively updates the interpolation points. The efficacy of\nthe proposed algorithms is validated through numerical examples, which show\nthat the proposed data-driven approaches perform comparably to their intrusive\ncounterparts.",

The adversary\nfirst generates lookalike addresses similar to one with which the victim has\npreviously interacted, and then engages with the victim to ``poison'' their\ntransaction history. The goal is to have the victim mistakenly send tokens to\nthe lookalike address, as opposed to the intended recipient. Compared to\ncontemporary studies, this paper provides four notable contributions. First, we\ndevelop a detection system and perform measurements over two years on both\nEthereum and BSC. We identify 13~times more attack attempts than reported\npreviously -- totaling 270M on-chain attacks targeting 17M victims. 6,633\nincidents have caused at least 83.8M USD in losses, which makes blockchain\naddress poisoning one of the largest cryptocurrency phishing schemes observed\nin the wild. Second, we analyze a few large attack entities using improved\nclustering techniques, and model attacker profitability and competition. Third,\nwe reveal attack strategies -- targeted populations, success conditions\n(address similarity, timing), and cross-chain attacks. Fourth, we\nmathematically define and simulate the lookalike address generation process\nacross various software- and hardware-based implementations, and identify a\nlarge-scale attacker group that appears to use GPUs.

While these approaches provide interpretability\nthrough the extracted rule-set, they often compromise accuracy compared to the\noriginal CNN model. In this paper, we identify the root cause of this accuracy\nloss as the post-training binarization of filter activations to extract the\nrule-set. To address this, we propose a novel sparsity loss function that\nenables class-specific filter binarization during CNN training, thus minimizing\ninformation loss when extracting the rule-set. We evaluate several training\nstrategies with our novel sparsity loss, analyzing their effectiveness and\nproviding guidance on their appropriate use.

However, the foreground-background feature\ncoupling caused by the overlapping phenomenon specific to X-ray images makes\ngeneral detectors designed for natural images perform poorly. To address this\nissue, we propose a Category Semantic Prior Contrastive Learning (CSPCL)\nmechanism, which aligns the class prototypes perceived by the classifier with\nthe content queries to correct and supplement the missing semantic information\nresponsible for classification, thereby enhancing the model sensitivity to\nforeground features.To achieve this alignment, we design a specific contrastive\nloss, CSP loss, which includes Intra-Class Truncated Attraction (ITA) loss and\nInter-Class Adaptive Repulsion (IAR) loss, and outperforms classic N-pair loss\nand InfoNCE loss. Specifically, ITA loss leverages class prototypes to attract\nintra-class category-specific content queries while preserving necessary\ndistinctiveness. IAR loss utilizes class prototypes to adaptively repel\ninter-class category-specific content queries based on the similarity between\nclass prototypes, helping disentangle features of similar categories.CSPCL is\ngeneral and can be easily integrated into Deformable DETR-based models.\nExtensive experiments on the PIXray and OPIXray datasets demonstrate that CSPCL\nsignificantly enhances the performance of various state-of-the-art models\nwithout increasing complexity.The code will be open source once the paper is\naccepted.",

Existing research has\ndemonstrated that the presence of duplicated data in training datasets can\nsignificantly influence both model performance and data privacy. However, the\nimpact of data duplication on the unlearning process remains largely\nunexplored. This paper addresses this gap by pioneering a comprehensive\ninvestigation into the role of data duplication, not only in standard machine\nunlearning but also in federated and reinforcement unlearning paradigms.\nSpecifically, we propose an adversary who duplicates a subset of the target\nmodel's training set and incorporates it into the training set. After training,\nthe adversary requests the model owner to unlearn this duplicated subset, and\nanalyzes the impact on the unlearned model. For example, the adversary can\nchallenge the model owner by revealing that, despite efforts to unlearn it, the\ninfluence of the duplicated subset remains in the model. Moreover, to\ncircumvent detection by de-duplication techniques, we propose three novel\nnear-duplication methods for the adversary, each tailored to a specific\nunlearning paradigm. We then examine their impacts on the unlearning process\nwhen de-duplication techniques are applied. Our findings reveal several crucial\ninsights: 1) the gold standard unlearning method, retraining from scratch,\nfails to effectively conduct unlearning under certain conditions; 2) unlearning\nduplicated data can lead to significant model degradation in specific\nscenarios; and 3) meticulously crafted duplicates can evade detection by\nde-duplication methods.",

Along these directions, we discuss new research opportunities\nbased on the significance of transportation problems and data availability.\nFinally, we compile resources such as data, code, and other learning materials\nto foster interdisciplinary communication.

However, existing metrics for\nevaluating such workflows, mainly build status and occasionally log analysis,\nare too sparse and limited in providing the information needed to assess the\nquality of changes made. In this work, we designed LLM-based critics to derive\nwell-structured and rigorous intermediate/step-level, execution-free evaluation\nproxies for repo-level code changes. Importantly, we assume access to the gold\ntest patch for the problem (i.e., reference-aware) to assess both semantics and\nexecutability of generated patches. With the gold test patch as a reference, we\npredict executability of all editing locations with an F1 score of 91.6%,\naggregating which, we can predict the build status in 84.8% of the instances in\nSWE-bench. In particular, such an execution-focused LLM critic outperforms\nother reference-free and reference-aware LLM critics by 38.9% to 72.5%.\nMoreover, we demonstrate the usefulness of such a reference-aware framework in\ncomparing patches generated by different agentic workflows.

The chiral bag surface can be interpreted as an $\\eta'$ domain\nwall, where a dynamical Chern-Simons theory emerges. Under level-rank duality,\nthe Chern-Simons theory serves as the counterterm introduced to block the\nso-called color charge leakage. To ensure the correct net baryon number of the\nfull chiral bag, an additional Chern-Simons theory involving the vector meson\nfield arises on the bag surface and extends outside the bag.

    "abstract": "We show that $4$-dimensional Robertson-Walker spacetimes can be constructed\nfor which all of the beta functions vanish to leading order, yielding\nconsistent string theory without extra dimensions. We find that there is a\nunique static solution, which we refer to as an anti-Einstein static universe.\nThe associated stress energy tensor can be interpreted as a perfect fluid with\na negative energy density. Interestingly, a fluid with a negative energy\ndensity was proposed in [2] as an ad hoc hypothesis to serve as a possible\nexplanation for dark energy and dark matter. Here, such a fluid spontaneously\nappears by trying to fit string theory into only $4$ dimensions. We can look at\nperturbations away from the anti-Einstein static universe. This has to be done\nnumerically and we only do it for a few choices of initial conditions. We find\nthat these solutions are very sensitive to the initial conditions and yield a\nvariety of behaviors. We hope that this behavior is rich enough to match\ncosmological observations by appropriately choosing the initial conditions. One\nof these solutions that we found is particularly interesting. It has a hubble\nparameter which is negative in the past (meaning a contracting universe), then\na point at which the hubble parameter changes sign, so the universe starts\nexpanding which could be identified with a big bang, after which the hubble\nparameter continues growing. Throughout all of this time, the acceleration is\npositive since the Hubble parameter is increasing. Finally, we comment that our\nresult does not contradict [1] as it seems that the authors overlooked the\npossibility of a purely complex axion field which allows for the\nRobertson-Walker metrics to make a contribution $c_{RW}\\geq 4$ to the central\ncharge. Thus, we can interpret dark matter and dark energy as being parts of a\nmechanism needed to keep $4$-dimensional string theory consistent.",

However,\nhuman + AI teams have been shown to perform worse than AI alone, with evidence\nindicating automation bias as the reason for poorer performance, particularly\nbecause humans tend to follow AI's recommendations even when they are\nincorrect. In many existing human + AI systems, decision-making support is\ntypically provided in the form of text explanations (XAI) to help users\nunderstand the AI's reasoning. Since human decision-making often relies on\nSystem 1 thinking, users may ignore or insufficiently engage with the\nexplanations, leading to poor decision-making. Previous research suggests that\nthere is a need for new approaches that encourage users to engage with the\nexplanations and one proposed method is the use of cognitive forcing functions\n(CFFs). In this work, we examine how various decision-support mechanisms impact\nuser engagement, trust, and human-AI collaborative task performance in a\ndiabetes management decision-making scenario. In a controlled experiment with\n108 participants, we evaluated the effects of six decision-support mechanisms\nsplit into two categories of explanations (text, visual) and four CFFs. Our\nfindings reveal that mechanisms like AI confidence levels, text explanations,\nand performance visualizations enhanced human-AI collaborative task\nperformance, and improved trust when AI reasoning clues were provided.\nMechanisms like human feedback and AI-driven questions encouraged deeper\nreflection but often reduced task performance by increasing cognitive effort,\nwhich in turn affected trust. Simple mechanisms like visual explanations had\nlittle effect on trust, highlighting the importance of striking a balance in\nCFF and XAI design.",

However, HCCI poses challenges for\ntraditional control methods due to its nonlinear, autoregressive, and\nstochastic nature.

Additionally, operating limits are not known a priori\nand must be determined experimentally. To mitigate these risks, real-time\nsafety monitoring based on the k-nearest neighbor algorithm is implemented,\nenabling safe interaction with the testbench.

The consequent signal pulses\ngenerated by the OPO are coupled to one another via the nonlinear delayed\ndynamics of the OPO, thus forming the internal nodes of a deep recurrent neural\nnetwork. We use such a nonlinearly coupled OPO network for chaotic time series\nprediction, nonlinear error correction in a noisy communication channel, as\nwell as noisy waveform classification and achieve accuracies exceeding 93% at\nan operating clock rate of ~ 10 GHz. Our OPO network is capable of achieving\nsub-nanosecond latencies, a timescale comparable to a single clock cycle in\nstate-of-the-art digital electronic processors. By circumventing the need for\noptical-electronic-optical (OEO) conversions, our ultrafast nanophotonic neural\nnetwork paves the way for the next generation of compact all-optical\nneuromorphic processors with ultralow latencies and high energy efficiencies.",

    "abstract": "The integration of biological principles into artificial olfactory systems\nhas led to significant advancements in odor detection and classification.\nInspired by the intricate mechanisms of natural olfaction, researchers are\ndeveloping sophisticated systems that mimic the functionality of biological\nolfactory pathways. These systems utilize high-density chemoresistive sensor\narrays (HCSA) combined with advanced computational techniques, such as\nFPGA-accelerated glomerular convergence circuits (FGCC) and hierarchical graph\nneural networks (HGNN). This bioinspired approach enables real-time adaptive\nresponses to volatile organic compounds (VOCs), enhancing the accuracy and\nefficiency of odor identification. At the core of these innovations is the\nmultiparametric sigmoidal sensor activation (MPSA), which quantifies VOCs by\nleveraging the diverse responses of sensor arrays. The implementation of\nlateral inhibition via programmable synaptic crossbars (LIPSC) further refines\nodor processing by mimicking neural interactions found in biological systems.\nAdditionally, temporal self-organizing maps (TSOM) facilitate dynamic\nclustering of odor patterns, allowing for a nuanced understanding of complex\nodor environments. A novel aspect of this research lies in the Grassmannian\nmanifold embedding (GME) of odor profiles, which provides a mathematical\nframework for representing and analyzing the multidimensional nature of odors.\nCoupled with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo-optimized feedback (HMC-FB), this system\neffectively compensates for drift in sensor readings, ensuring consistent\nperformance over time.

While numerous studies have investigated web\naccessibility within specific sectors such as education, healthcare, and\ngovernment services, these efforts have been largely constrained to individual\ncountries or narrow contexts, leaving a critical gap in cross-regional,\nlarge-scale analysis. This paper addresses this gap by conducting the first\nlarge-scale comparative study of mobile web accessibility across the Global\nSouth. In this work, we evaluate 100,000 websites from 10 countries in the\nGlobal South to provide a comprehensive understanding of accessibility\npractices in these regions. Our findings reveal that websites from countries\nwith strict accessibility regulations and enforcement tend to adhere better to\nWeb Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) guidelines. However, accessibility\nviolations impact different disability groups in varying ways. Blind and\nlow-vision individuals in the Global South are disproportionately affected, as\nonly 40% of the evaluated websites meet critical accessibility guidelines.

    "abstract": "Integrating Urban Air Mobility (UAM) into airspace managed by Air Traffic\nControl (ATC) poses significant challenges, particularly in congested terminal\nenvironments. This study proposes a framework to assess the feasibility of UAM\nroute integration using probabilistic aircraft trajectory prediction. By\nleveraging conditional Normalizing Flows, the framework predicts short-term\ntrajectory distributions of conventional aircraft, enabling UAM vehicles to\ndynamically adjust speeds and maintain safe separations. The methodology was\napplied to airspace over Seoul metropolitan area, encompassing interactions\nbetween UAM and conventional traffic at multiple altitudes and lanes. The\nresults reveal that different physical locations of lanes and routes experience\nvarying interaction patterns and encounter dynamics. For instance, Lane 1 at\nlower altitudes (1,500 ft and 2,000 ft) exhibited minimal interactions with\nconventional aircraft, resulting in the largest separations and the most stable\ndelay proportions. In contrast, Lane 4 near the airport experienced more\nfrequent and complex interactions due to its proximity to departing traffic.\nThe limited trajectory data for departing aircraft in this region occasionally\nled to tighter separations and increased operational challenges. This study\nunderscores the potential of predictive modeling in facilitating UAM\nintegration while highlighting critical trade-offs between safety and\nefficiency. The findings contribute to refining airspace management strategies\nand offer insights for scaling UAM operations in complex urban environments.",

    "abstract": "Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) are two\nprominent strategies for controlling legged robots, each with unique strengths.\nRL learns control policies through system interaction, adapting to various\nscenarios, whereas MPC relies on a predefined mathematical model to solve\noptimization problems in real-time. Despite their widespread use, there is a\nlack of direct comparative analysis under standardized conditions. This work\naddresses this gap by benchmarking MPC and RL controllers on a Unitree Go1\nquadruped robot within the MuJoCo simulation environment, focusing on a\nstandardized task-straight walking at a constant velocity. Performance is\nevaluated based on disturbance rejection, energy efficiency, and terrain\nadaptability. The results show that RL excels in handling disturbances and\nmaintaining energy efficiency but struggles with generalization to new terrains\ndue to its dependence on learned policies tailored to specific environments. In\ncontrast, MPC shows enhanced recovery capabilities from larger perturbations by\nleveraging its optimization-based approach, allowing for a balanced\ndistribution of control efforts across the robot's joints. The results provide\na clear understanding of the advantages and limitations of both RL and MPC,\noffering insights into selecting an appropriate control strategy for legged\nrobotic applications.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs), or foundation models (FMs), are pretrained\ntransformers that coherently complete sentences auto-regressively. In this\npaper, we show that LLMs can control simplified space systems after some\nadditional training, called fine-tuning. We look at relatively small language\nmodels, ranging between 7 and 13 billion parameters. We focus on four problems:\na three-dimensional spring toy problem, low-thrust orbit transfer, low-thrust\ncislunar control, and powered descent guidance. The fine-tuned LLMs are capable\nof controlling systems by generating sufficiently accurate outputs that are\nmulti-dimensional vectors with up to 10 significant digits. We show that for\nseveral problems the amount of data required to perform fine-tuning is smaller\nthan what is generally required of traditional deep neural networks (DNNs), and\nthat fine-tuned LLMs are good at generalizing outside of the training dataset.\nFurther, the same LLM can be fine-tuned with data from different problems, with\nonly minor performance degradation with respect to LLMs trained for a single\napplication. This work is intended as a first step towards the development of a\ngeneral space systems controller.",
