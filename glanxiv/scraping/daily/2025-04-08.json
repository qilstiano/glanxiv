    "abstract": "While the Born rule is traditionally introduced as a separate postulate of\nquantum mechanics, we show it emerges naturally from a modified Schr\\\"odinger\nequation that includes \"small-signal truncation\". This parallels the way\nquantum decoherence gives rise to the branches of the multiverse in the\n\"Many-Worlds Interpretation\", eliminating the need for a separate measurement\npostulate. Our approach thus offers a unified framework in which both the\nemergence of multiple branches of the multiverse and their statistical\nproperties follow from a single fundamental law of motion. We model\n\"small-signal truncation\" in a somewhat stylized manner, but we argue that the\nprecise details of its underlying physical mechanism do not affect the\nemergence of the Born rule.",

    "abstract": "In exploring Predictive Health Management (PHM) strategies for Proton\nExchange Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFC), the Transformer model, widely used in\ndata-driven approaches, excels in many fields but struggles with time series\nanalysis due to its self-attention mechanism, which yields a complexity of the\ninput sequence squared and low computational efficiency. It also faces\nchallenges in capturing both global long-term dependencies and local details\neffectively. To tackle this, we propose the Temporal Scale Transformer\n(TSTransformer), an enhanced version of the inverted Transformer\n(iTransformer). Unlike traditional Transformers that treat each timestep as an\ninput token, TSTransformer maps sequences of varying lengths into tokens at\ndifferent stages for inter-sequence modeling, using attention to capture\nmultivariate correlations and feed-forward networks (FFN) to encode sequence\nrepresentations. By integrating a one-dimensional convolutional layer into the\nmultivariate attention for multi-level scaling of K and V matrices, it improves\nlocal feature extraction, captures temporal scale characteristics, and reduces\ntoken count and computational costs. Experiments comparing TSTransformer with\nmodels like Long Short-Term Memory, iTransformer, and Transformer demonstrate\nits potential as a powerful tool for advancing PHM in renewable energy,\neffectively addressing the limitations of pure Transformer models in\ndata-driven time series tasks.",

    "abstract": "Research on chemotherapy, heart surgery, and vaccines has indicated that the\nrisks and benefits of a treatment could vary depending on the time of day it is\nadministered. A challenge with performing studies on timing treatment\nadministration is that the optimal treatment time is different for each\npatient, as it would be based on a patient's internal clock time (ICT) rather\nthan the 24-hour day-night cycle time. Prediction methods have been developed\nto determine a patient's ICT based on biomarker measurements, which can be\nleveraged to personalize treatment time. However, these methods face two\nlimitations. First, these methods are designed to output predictions given\nbiomarker measurements from a single tissue sample, when multiple tissue\nsamples can be collected over time. Second, these methods are based on linear\nmodelling frameworks, which would not capture the potentially complex\nrelationships between biomarkers and a patient's ICT. To address these two\nlimitations, this paper introduces a recurrent neural network framework, which\nwe refer to as LassoRNet, for predicting the ICT at which a patient's\nbiomarkers are measured as well as the underlying offset between a patient's\nICT and the 24-hour day-night cycle time, or that patient's dim-light melatonin\nonset (DLMO) time. A novel feature of LassoRNet is a proposed variable\nselection scheme that minimizes the number of biomarkers needed to predict ICT.\nWe evaluate LassoRNet on three longitudinal circadian transcriptome study data\nsets where DLMO time was determined for each study participant, and find that\nit consistently outperforms state-of-the art in both ICT and DLMO time\nprediction. Notably, LassoRNet obtains a median absolute error of approximately\none hour in ICT prediction and 30 to 40 minutes in DLMO time prediction, where\nDLMO time prediction is performed using three samples collected at sequential\ntime points.",

The matrix integral can be viewed as a\nstatistical physics partition function with inverse temperature $\\Omega^4$. At\nlarge $\\Omega$ the model is dominated by a matrix configuration corresponding\nto a 'polarised' spherical D1-brane. We show that at a critical value of\n$\\Omega^2 N$ the model undergoes a first order phase transition, corresponding\nto tunneling into a collection of well-separated D-instantons.

Moreover, local\nsmoothness and consistency receive particular attention to prevent jumps in the\nrobot state belief.

Tensor decomposition emerges\nas a promising approach to compress model size without sacrificing accuracy.\nNevertheless, training tensorized neural networks (TNNs) incurs non-trivial\noverhead and severe performance degradation on conventional accelerators due to\ncomplex tensor shaping requirements.

In our study, we employ a commonly used\nsoftware approach that streamlines JOIN operations into simpler selection or\nfiltering tasks using pre-join denormalization which makes query processing\nworkload more amenable to PIM acceleration. This research explores DRAM design\nlandscape to evaluate how effectively these filtering tasks can be efficiently\nexecuted across DRAM hierarchy and their effect on overall application speedup.\nWe also find that operations such as aggregates are more suitably executed on\nthe CPU rather than PIM. Thus, we propose a cooperative query processing\nframework that capitalizes on both CPU and PIM strengths, where (i) the\nDRAM-based PIM block, with its massive parallelism, supports scan operations\nwhile (ii) CPU, with its flexible architecture, supports the rest of query\nexecution.

    "abstract": "Transformer architectures, underpinned by the self-attention mechanism, have\nachieved state-of-the-art results across numerous natural language processing\n(NLP) tasks by effectively modeling long-range dependencies. However, the\ncomputational complexity of self-attention, scaling quadratically with input\nsequence length, presents significant challenges for processing very long\nsequences or operating under resource constraints. This paper introduces the\nLearnable Multi-Scale Wavelet Transformer (LMWT), a novel architecture that\nreplaces the standard dot-product self-attention with a learnable multi-scale\nHaar wavelet transform module. Leveraging the intrinsic multi-resolution\nproperties of wavelets, the LMWT efficiently captures both local details and\nglobal context. Crucially, the parameters of the wavelet transform, including\nscale-specific coefficients, are learned end-to-end during training, allowing\nthe model to adapt its decomposition strategy to the data and task. We present\nthe detailed mathematical formulation of the learnable Haar wavelet module and\nits integration into the transformer framework, supplemented by an\narchitectural diagram. We conduct a comprehensive experimental evaluation on a\nstandard machine translation benchmark (WMT16 En-De), comparing the LMWT\nagainst a baseline self-attention transformer using metrics like BLEU score,\nperplexity, and token accuracy. Furthermore, we analyze the computational\ncomplexity, highlighting the linear scaling of our approach, discuss its\nnovelty in the context of related work, and explore the interpretability\noffered by visualizing the learned Haar coefficients. Our results indicate that\nthe LMWT achieves competitive performance while offering substantial\ncomputational advantages, positioning it as a promising and novel alternative\nfor efficient sequence modeling.",

    "abstract": "It has been observed that the growth of the nucleus and the cytoplasm is\ncoordinated during cell growth, resulting in a nearly constant nuclear-to-cell\nvolume ratio (N/C) throughout the cell cycle. Previous studies have shown that\nthe N/C ratio is determined by the ratio between the number of proteins in the\nnucleus and the total number of proteins in the cell. These observations\nsuggest the importance of the nucleocytoplasmic transport process in nuclear\nsize by regulating protein concentrations in the nucleus and cytoplasm. This\npaper combines a biophysical model of Ran-mediated nucleocytoplasmic transport\nand a simple cell growth model to provide insights into several key aspects of\nthe N/C ratio homeostasis in growing cells. Our model shows that the\npermeability of the nuclear envelope needs to grow in line with the cell to\nmaintain a nearly constant N/C ratio, that several parameters involved in the\nnucleocytoplasmic transport mechanism and gene translation significantly affect\nthe N/C ratio, and that Ran may potentially compensate for the lack of NTF2 in\nthe nucleocytoplasmic transport mechanism to maintain a viable N/C ratio.\nHowever, this compensation is possible only if RanGDP is allowed to translocate\nthrough the nuclear envelope independently of NTF2.",

    "abstract": "Recent high-cadence transient surveys have uncovered a subclass of Type Ibc\nsupernovae (SNe) that exhibit an early, blue peak lasting a few days before the\nmain, radioactively powered peak. Since progenitors of Type Ibc SNe are\ntypically compact and lack an extended envelope, this early peak is commonly\nattributed to the presence of circumstellar matter (CSM) surrounding the\nprogenitor star. As such, these SNe provide a unique opportunity to constrain\nthe pre-explosion activity of Type Ibc SN progenitors. We present the first\nsystematic study of this Type Ibc SN population that incorporates hydrodynamic\nmodelling. We simulated Type Ibc SNe exploding within CSM using the multi-group\nradiation-hydrodynamics code \\texttt{STELLA}, exploring a range of SN and CSM\nproperties. By comparing the theoretical multi-band light curves to a sample of\nseven Type Ibc SNe with early peaks, we constrained their CSM properties.\nAssuming a wind-like density distribution of CSM, we found CSM masses of\n$10^{-2} - 10^{-1} \\ \\Msun$ and CSM radii of $(1 - 5) \\times 10^3 \\ \\Rsun$.\nWhile the masses were roughly consistent with a previous estimate obtained\nusing an analytical model, the radii were significantly different, likely due\nto a simplified assumption on blackbody temperature used in analytical models.\nWe infer that the progenitors could have created CSM via late-time binary mass\ntransfer or pulsational pair instability. We also estimate that, in the planned\n\\textit{ULTRASAT} high-cadence survey, $\\sim 30$ early peaks similar to those\nin this paper from Type Ibc SNe will be observed.",

They have been used very effectively to speed up dense\nmatrix-matrix multiplication libraries like Nvidia's cuBLAS, enabling\nsignificantly higher performance over use of the traditional scalar GPU cores.\nThere also been recent interest in using these dense TCUs for the important\nsparse-dense matrix-matrix multiplication (SpMM) kernel via explicit\nzero-filling.\n  However, an examination of the attainable performance of TC-GNN, the\nstate-of-the-art TCU-enhanced SpMM implementation, indicates that for a\nsubstantial majority of the sparse matrices in the SuiteSparse collection, the\nachieved performance falls significantly short of the state-of-the-art SpMM\nkernels that only utilize scalar cores.\n  In this paper, we therefore address the question: Can dense TCUs be\neffectively used to accelerate SpMM for a range of sparse matrices arising from\nmultiple application domains, such as those found in the SuiteSparse matrix\ncollection? We answer this question in the affirmative by developing a very\nefficient TCU-based GPU kernel - cuTeSpMM (cuda Tensor core SpMM) that achieves\nsubstantially higher performance over TC-GNN. We also develop a notion of the\nTCU-Synergy of a sparse-matrix, based on its non-zero structure and a modeled\nOperational Intensity.

Unfortunately, no\nwork establishes the causal effect of generative search designs on human trust.\nHere we execute ~12,000 search queries across seven countries, generating\n~80,000 real-time GenAI and traditional search results, to understand the\nextent of current global exposure to GenAI search. We then use a preregistered,\nrandomized experiment on a large study sample representative of the U.S.\npopulation to show that while participants trust GenAI search less than\ntraditional search on average, reference links and citations significantly\nincrease trust in GenAI, even when those links and citations are incorrect or\nhallucinated. Uncertainty highlighting, which reveals GenAI's confidence in its\nown conclusions, makes us less willing to trust and share generative\ninformation whether that confidence is high or low. Positive social feedback\nincreases trust in GenAI while negative feedback reduces trust. These results\nimply that GenAI designs can increase trust in inaccurate and hallucinated\ninformation and reduce trust when GenAI's certainty is made explicit. Trust in\nGenAI varies by topic and with users' demographics, education, industry\nemployment and GenAI experience, revealing which sub-populations are most\nvulnerable to GenAI misrepresentations. Trust, in turn, predicts behavior, as\nthose who trust GenAI more click more and spend less time evaluating GenAI\nsearch results. These findings suggest directions for GenAI design to safely\nand productively address the AI \"trust gap.\"",

Diffusion features have demonstrated success in image\ngeneration and image completion while understanding image context. Occlusion\ncan be posed as an image completion problem by deeming the pixels of the\noccluder to be `missing.' We hypothesize that such features can help\nhallucinate object visual features behind occluding objects, and hence we\npropose using them to enable models to become more occlusion robust. We design\nexperiments to include input-based augmentations as well as feature-based\naugmentations. Input-based augmentations involve finetuning on images where the\noccluder pixels are inpainted, and feature-based augmentations involve\naugmenting classification features with intermediate diffusion features. We\ndemonstrate that our proposed use of diffusion-based features results in models\nthat are more robust to partial object occlusions for both Transformers and\nConvNets on ImageNet with simulated occlusions.

We resolve this issue by redefining the vertex amplitude using a\nnovel set of phase space coordinates that eliminate the extraneous phase\nfactor, yielding a universally defined face amplitude. Key results include: (1)\nThe vertex amplitude is rigorously shown to be well-defined for Chern-Simons\nlevels $k \\in 8\\mathbb{N}$, compatible with semi-classical analysis ($k \\to\n\\infty$). (2) The symplectic structure of the Chern-Simons phase space is\nmodified to accommodate ${\\rm SL}(2,\\mathbb{C})$ holonomies, relaxing\nquantization constraints to $\\mathrm{Sp}(2r,\\mathbb{Z}/4)$. (3) Edge amplitudes\nare simplified using constraints aligned with colored tensor models, enabling\nsystematic gluing of 4-simplices into complexes dual to colored graphs.

    "abstract": "Property-based testing is a popular technique for automatically testing\nsemantic properties of a program, specified as a pair of pre- and\npost-conditions. The efficacy of this approach depends on being able to quickly\ngenerate inputs that meet the precondition, in order to maximize the set of\nprogram behaviors that are probed. For semantically rich preconditions, purely\nrandom generation is unlikely to produce many valid inputs; when this occurs,\nusers are forced to manually write their own specialized input generators. One\ncommon problem with handwritten generators is that they may be\n\\emph{incomplete}, i.e.,\\ they are unable to generate some values meeting the\ntarget precondition. This paper presents a novel program repair technique that\npatches an incomplete generator so that its range includes every valid input.\nOur approach uses a novel enumerative synthesis algorithm that leverages the\nrecently developed notion of \\emph{coverage types} to characterize the set of\nmissing test values as well as the coverage provided by candidate repairs. We\nhave implemented a repair tool for OCaml input generators, called Cobb, and\nhave used it to repair a suite of benchmarks drawn from the property-based\ntesting literature.",

Consequently, there is a\nrising significance in addressing privacy apprehensions related to the\ninclusion of sensitive and private information within event data utilized by\nprocess mining algorithms. State-of-the-art research mainly focuses on\nproviding quantifiable privacy guarantees, e.g., via differential privacy, for\ntrace variants that are used by the main process mining techniques, e.g.,\nprocess discovery. However, privacy preservation techniques designed for the\nrelease of trace variants are still insufficient to meet all the demands of\nindustry-scale utilization. Moreover, ensuring privacy guarantees in situations\ncharacterized by a high occurrence of infrequent trace variants remains a\nchallenging endeavor. In this paper, we introduce two novel approaches for\nreleasing differentially private trace variants based on trained generative\nmodels. With TraVaG, we leverage \\textit{Generative Adversarial Networks}\n(GANs) to sample from a privatized implicit variant distribution. Our second\nmethod employs \\textit{Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models} that\nreconstruct artificial trace variants from noise via trained Markov chains.\nBoth methods offer industry-scale benefits and elevate the degree of privacy\nassurances, particularly in scenarios featuring a substantial prevalence of\ninfrequent variants.

These results establish a robust quantitative framework for optimizing\nCCR designs to perform at the sub-millimeter level under realistic lunar\nconditions and underscore the advantages of precision hollow SiC CCRs for\nnext-generation LLR operations.",

Today large input\nmatrices require distributed memory parallelism to avoid disk I/O, and modern\nHPC machines with GPUs can greatly accelerate linear algebra computation. In\nthis paper, we implement a GPU-based distributed-memory SpGEMM routine on top\nof the CombBLAS library.

Furthermore, we note that communication between\nprocesses can be optimized by either direct host-to-host or device-to-device\ncommunication, depending on the message size. To exploit this, we introduce a\nhybrid communication scheme that dynamically switches data paths depending on\nthe message size, thus improving runtimes in communication-bound scenarios.",

This paper goes\none step further to evaluate the causal reasoning process of LLMs when they\nanswer questions eliciting social biases. We first propose a novel conceptual\nframework to classify the causal reasoning produced by LLMs. Next, we use LLMs\nto synthesize $1788$ questions covering $8$ sensitive attributes and manually\nvalidate them.

    "abstract": "This thesis explores the cosmological implications of modified gravity,\nfocusing on nonmetricity-based $f(Q)$ gravity as an alternative to the\n$\\Lambda$CDM model in explaining cosmic acceleration. Chapter I lays the\ntheoretical groundwork by reviewing General Relativity (GR), $\\Lambda$CDM, and\nthe limitations of the standard model, motivating $f(Q)$ gravity. Chapter II\nconstructs cosmological reconstructions of $f(Q)$ gravity within the FLRW\nframework, deriving forms of $f(Q)$ that replicate the $\\Lambda$CDM expansion\nand using the e-folding parameter to show compatibility with various cosmic\nhistories. Chapter III addresses challenges with arbitrary $f(Q)$ forms by\napplying Gaussian Process (GP) reconstruction using observational Hubble data.\nThis model-independent method reconstructs the Hubble parameter H(z), leading\nto a data-driven $f(Q)$ form. Motivated by this, a new parametrization $f(Q) =\n-2\\Lambda + \\epsilon Q^2$ is proposed, and power-law and exponential models are\ntested for consistency. Chapter IV incorporates a quintessence scalar field in\npower-law $f(Q)$ gravity to study inflation and late-time acceleration. Using\nGP, the scalar potential $V(\\phi)$ is reconstructed and analyzed. Results show\nthat early dark energy has little impact today, but reconstructed quintessence\nmodels offer insights into cosmic acceleration. Chapter V examines interacting\ndark energy and matter under power-law $f(Q)$ using dynamical systems. Two\ninteraction types are studied, and fixed points linked to de Sitter and\nquintessence solutions are identified. Chapter VI concludes and suggests future\nwork.",

When prior knowledge about the system is\navailable, Bayesian analysis provides a natural framework for encoding it\nthrough a prior distribution. In practice, such knowledge is often too vague to\nspecify a full prior distribution, motivating the use of default\n'uninformative' priors that minimize subjective bias. Jeffreys prior is an\nappealing uninformative prior because: (i) it is invariant under any\nre-parameterization of the model, (ii) it encodes the intrinsic geometric\nstructure of the parameter space through the Fisher information matrix, which\nin turn enhances the diversity of parameter samples. Despite these benefits,\ndrawing samples from Jeffreys prior is challenging. In this paper, we develop a\ngeneral sampling scheme using the Metropolis-Adjusted Langevin Algorithm that\nenables sampling of parameter values from Jeffreys prior; the method extends\nnaturally to nonlinear state-space models. The resulting samples can be\ndirectly used in sampling-based system identification methods and Bayesian\nexperiment design, providing an objective, information-geometric description of\nparameter uncertainty.

    "abstract": "Sub-micrometer thin films are promising platforms for emerging flexible\nphotovoltaic devices. Although the current market already produces efficient\nsolar cells, the average wafer thickness of these devices remains far from the\nsub-micrometer scale, making them susceptible to cracking under bending stress\nand thus precluding their use in flexible device applications. Due to its earth\nabundance, non-toxicity, and low elastic modulus, titanium trisulfide (TiS$_3$)\nhas emerged as a promising alternative for flexible device applications. Here,\nusing excited-state density functional calculations combined with the transfer\nmatrix approach, we perform an optical analysis and assess the efficiency of a\nprototype photovoltaic device based on sub-micrometer TiS$_3$ thin films. Using\noptical constants obtained from our first-principles calculations, we evaluate\nthe photovoltaic response of a single-junction device in the radiative limit,\nfinding that a 140-nm-thick active layer achieves a maximum power conversion\nefficiency of approximately 22%. Additionally, we investigate tandem solar\ncells that incorporate TiS$_3$ into perovskite thin films, and find that the\nlower and upper power conversion efficiencies range from approximately 18% to\n33%. Overall, our results suggest great potential for using TiS$_3$ thin films\nas an active layer in the design of highly efficient flexible solar cells.",

Using the Sherwood-Relics suite, we extract\nhigh-fidelity flux power spectra from simulated Lyman-$\\alpha$ forest data,\nspanning a broad range of cosmologies and thermal histories. This enables\nprecise constraints on the warm dark matter (WDM) fraction, $f_{\\mathrm{WDM}}$,\nand the mass of the WDM particle, $m_{\\mathrm{WDM}}$. A key advancement of our\nanalysis is the integration of a neural network emulator directly at the\nlikelihood level, significantly accelerating Bayesian parameter inference. With\nnew observations of high-redshift ($z$ = 4.2$-$5.0) quasar spectra from UVES\nand HIRES, we establish stringent upper limits: for $m_{\\mathrm{WDM}}$ = 1 keV,\nwe find $f_{\\mathrm{WDM}} < 0.16$ (2$\\sigma$), with constraints loosening to\n35\\%, 50\\%, and 67\\% for $m_{\\mathrm{WDM}}$ = 2, 3, and 4 keV, respectively.\nOur results for pure WDM reaffirm the lower bounds of previous work. Crucially,\nwe account for the fixed resolution of simulations and the impact of patchy\nreionization, demonstrating their minimal influence on mixed dark matter\nconstraints. This robustness paves the way for tighter bounds with improved\nstatistical samples in the future. Our findings suggest that CWDM models can\nnaturally accommodate mild suppression of matter clustering in the high\nredshift Lyman-$\\alpha$ forest 1D flux power, potentially offering a resolution\nto some of the ongoing cosmological tensions at low redshifts, namely the\n$S_{8}$ tension.",

To investigate their dynamical state from an observational\nperspective, we employed Gaia DR3 data to perform a comprehensive analysis of\n174 OCs (~10% of Dias et al.'s 2021 catalogue). We employed radial density\nprofiles and astrometrically decontaminated colour-magnitude diagrams to derive\nstructural parameters, distance, mass and time-related quantities. We explored\nthe parameters space and searched for connections relating the clusters'\nstructure with the internal evolutionary state and the external Galactic tidal\nfield. Correlations were verified after segregating the sample according to the\nGalactocentric distance and half-light to Jacobi radius ratio ($r_h/R_J$). This\ntidal filling ratio decreases with both the cluster mass and dynamical age. At\na given evolutionary stage, OCs with larger $r_h/R_J$ tend to present larger\nfractions of mass loss due to dynamical effects. Regarding the impact of the\nexternal conditions, we identified different evaporation regimes: for ambient\ndensities ($\\rho_{\\rm{amb}}$) larger than ~0.1M$_{\\odot}$/pc$^3$, clusters tend\nto be more tidally filled as they are subject to weaker tidal stresses. For\n$\\rho_{\\rm{amb}}$ $\\lesssim$ 0.1M$_{\\odot}$/pc$^3$, the opposite occurs: $R_J$\nincreases for smaller $\\rho_{\\rm{amb}}$, causing $r_h/R_J$ to decrease. In\nturn, two-body relaxation tends to compact the cluster core, which is less\nsensitive to variations of the external potential. The higher the degree of\ncentral concentration, the larger the number of relaxation times a cluster\ntakes until its dissolution.",

    "abstract": "Both biological cortico-thalamic networks and artificial transformer networks\nuse canonical computations to perform a wide range of cognitive tasks. In this\nwork, we propose that the structure of cortico-thalamic circuits is well suited\nto realize a computation analogous to multihead self-attention, the main\nalgorithmic innovation of transformer networks. We assign distinct\ncomputational roles to superficial and deep pyramidal cells of the cortex:\nwhile superficial pyramidal cells maintain a key-value memory, deep pyramidal\ncells encode the current query, gain-modulated by the key-value memory in the\nsuperficial layer. We show that the structure of this computation matches the\nfine-grained structure of core and matrix projections from the thalamus to the\ncortex. We then suggest the parallel between one head of attention and a\ncortical area, and propose that a thalamo-cortico-thalamic pathway implements a\ncomputation akin to a multihead, unnormalized, linear self-attention block.\nCross-attention corresponds to the key-value memory of one cortical area being\nused for retrieval by the query in another cortical area. Finally, as a first\nstep towards a mechanistic theory of synaptic learning of cortical\ntransformers, we derive the formal gradients of a typical loss function with\nrespect to the parameters of such computation.",

    "abstract": "The presence of a 'butterfly' or a quadrupole structure in the stellar mean\nradial velocity field of the Milky Way is well known from the Gaia and the\nAPOGEE surveys. Past studies indicated that a stellar bar can excite such a\nquadrupole feature in the $<V_R>$ distribution. However, a systematic study\ninvestigating the co-evolution of bar and quadrupole structure is largely\nmissing. Furthermore, whether this quadrupole structure in $<V_R>$ can be used\nas a robust kinematic diagnostic to constrain bar properties, particularly for\nthe Milky Way, is still beyond our grasp. Here, we investigate the bar-induced\nquadrupole feature using a suite of isolated N-body models forming prominent\nbars and a sample of Milky Way-like barred galaxies from the TNG50 cosmological\nsimulation. We demonstrate that the properties of the quadrupole (strength,\nlength, and orientation) are strongly correlated with the bar properties,\nregardless of the choice of the stellar tracer population; thereby making the\nquadrupole feature an excellent kinematic diagnostic for constraining the bar\nproperties. In presence of spirals, the estimator which takes into account the\nphase-angle of m=4 Fourier moment, serves as a more appropriate estimator for\nmeasuring the length of the quadrupole. Further, we constructed a novel\nGaia-like mock dataset from a simulated bar model while incorporating the dust\nextinction and the broad trends of observational errors of the Gaia survey. The\nquadrupole properties (strength and length) estimated from those Gaia-like mock\ndata are larger (~35-45 percent) when compared with their true values. We\ndetermined that the majority of this effect is due to the uncertainty in\nparallax measurement. This demonstrates the potential caveat of inferring Milky\nWay's bar properties by using the stellar kinematic information from the Gaia\nDR3 without properly accounting for the observational uncertainties.",

When the\nbinary is compact enough, the two black holes are thought to be surrounded by a\ncommon broad line region that reprocesses the impinging periodically varying\nionising flux, creating broad emission lines with variable lineshapes.\nTherefore, the study of broad emission line variability through multi-epoch\nspectroscopic campaigns is of paramount importance for the unambiguous\nidentification of a binary. In this work, we study the response of a disc-like\nbroad line region to the Doppler-boosted ionising flux emitted by\n$\\mathrm{sub-milli-pc}$ MBH binaries on a circular orbit and compare it with\nthe response of a broad line region illuminated by a single MBH with a\nperiodically but isotropically varying intrinsic luminosity.\n  We show that in the binary case, the time lags of the blue and red wings of\nthe broad emission lines, arising from diametrically opposite sides of the\ncircumbinary disk, are out of phase by half of the binary's orbital period, as\nthey each respond to the periodic \"light-house\" modulation from the binary's\ncontinuum emission.

    "abstract": "We present a comprehensive end-to-end framework for simulating the real-time\ndynamics of chemical systems on a fault-tolerant quantum computer,\nincorporating both electronic and nuclear quantum degrees of freedom. An\nall-particle simulation is nominally efficient on a quantum computer, but\npractically infeasible. Hence, central to our approach is the construction of a\nfirst-quantized plane-wave algorithm making use of pseudoions. The latter\nconsolidate chemically inactive electrons and the nucleus into a single\neffective dynamical ionic entity, extending the well-established concept of\npseudopotentials in quantum chemistry to a two-body interaction. We explicitly\ndescribe efficient quantum circuits for initial state preparation across all\ndegrees of freedom, as well as for block-encoding the Hamiltonian describing\ninteracting pseudoions and chemically active electrons, by leveraging recent\nadvances in quantum rejection sampling to optimize the implementations. To\nextract useful chemical information, we first design molecular fingerprints by\ncombining density-functional calculations with machine learning techniques, and\nsubsequently validate them through surrogate classical molecular dynamics\nsimulations. These fingerprints are then coherently encoded on a quantum\ncomputer for efficient molecular identification via amplitude estimation. We\nprovide an extensive analysis of the cost of running the algorithm on a\nfault-tolerant quantum computer for several chemically interesting systems. As\nan illustration, simulating the interaction between $\\mathrm{NH_3}$ and\n$\\mathrm{BF_3}$ (a 40-particle system) requires 808 logical qubits to encode\nthe problem, and approximately $10^{11}$ Toffoli gates per femtosecond of time\nevolution.

Keck data, taken 8 years after the\nevent, reveal a strong lens detection enabling a direct measurement of lens\nflux and source-lens relative proper motion. We find the relative source-lens\nproper motion to be $\\mu_{\\rm rel, Hel} = 4.07 \\pm 0.34\\ \\rm mas\\ yr^{-1}$,\nwith the lens being $\\sim10$ times fainter than the source. The lens was very\nfaint in the Hubble passbands, and the small lens-source separation of $\\sim$35\nmas made its detection difficult. However, we obtained estimates of the lens\nmagnitudes in Hubble bands by constraining its location to match the Keck\nK-band detection. The original analysis by \\citet{Furusawa2013} reports a\ndegenerate light curve, with several viable models depending on higher-order\neffects. We attempt to break the degeneracy by remodeling the event using\nconstraints from follow-up data. Our best fit model includes parallax, orbital\nmotion, xallarap and the magnification of a source companion. Models omitting\nany of these are excluded. However, even with a lens detection the solution\nremains unclear, as the degeneracy between a nearby late M dwarf and a distant\nearly M dwarf in the disk persists, and cannot be broken with NIR data alone.\nWe conclude the lens is either a $\\sim0.2\\ M_{\\odot}$ star at $2-3$kpc, or a\n$\\sim0.5\\ M_{\\odot}$ star at $4-5$kpc.

In this paper, starting from 't Hooft's constant\nfield strength ($F$) instantons, the only known exact solutions on $\\mathbb\nT^4$, we explore the moduli space via analytical and lattice tools. These\nsolutions are characterized by two positive integers $k, \\ell$, $k+\\ell=N$, and\nare self-dual for $\\mathbb T^4$ sides $L_\\mu$ tuned to $k L_1 L_2 = r \\ell L_3\nL_4$. For gcd$(k,r) = r$, we show, analytically and numerically (for $N = 3$)\nthat the constant-$F$ solutions are the only self-dual solutions on the tuned\n$\\mathbb T^4$, with $4r$ holonomy moduli. In contrast, when gcd$(k,r) \\ne r$,\nwe argue that the self-dual constant-$F$ solutions acquire, in addition to the\n$4\\text{gcd}(k,r)$ holonomies, $4r - 4\\text{gcd}(k,r)$ extra moduli, whose\nturning on makes the field strength nonabelian and non-constant. Thus, for\ngcd($k,r) \\ne r$, 't Hooft's constant-$F$ solutions are a measure-zero subset\nof the moduli space on the tuned $\\mathbb T^4$, a fact explaining a puzzle\nencountered in arXiv:2307.04795. We also show that, for $r = k = 2$, $N = 3$,\nthe agreement between the approximate analytic solutions on the slightly\ndetuned $\\mathbb T^4$ and the $Q=2/3$ self-dual configurations obtained by\nminimizing the lattice action is remarkable.",

    "abstract": "The properties of active region nests, which are locations on the Sun with\nrecurring flux emergence, are poorly constrained by observations from Earth\nalone. ESA's Solar Orbiter now monitors the far side of the Sun for extended\nperiods of time. This facilitates observations of the entire Sun. We combined\nobservations from near-Earth satellites and Solar Orbiter to evaluate the\ncontribution of a long-lived active region nest to the global flaring activity\nof the Sun. We identified a location in Carrington coordinates with episodic\nbursts of flux emergence throughout 2022. The combined observations allowed a\nnearly continuous monitoring of this region from April to October, that is,\nduring its most active period. GOES and Solar Orbiter/STIX were used to compare\nits flaring activity to that of the entire Sun. The region morphology was\nextracted from SDO/AIA and Solar Orbiter/EUI extreme-ultraviolet images and was\ncombined with magnetic field measurements from SDO/HMI and Solar Orbiter/PHI to\nassess its unsigned magnetic flux. The active region nest grew in complexity\nfrom January to May due to repeated flux emergence events. The peak unsigned\nmagnetic flux was $5\\times10^{22}$Mx. The region caused 40% of the observed\nsolar flares in 2022, including five months in which it produced 50-70% of all\nflares over the entire Sun (in the nearly continuous monitoring window). Of the\n17 complex flaring NOAA active regions in 2022, this region contained 10, but\nthey occupied less than 20% of the area in the active latitudes. Active region\nnests can maintain a high rate of flaring activity for several solar rotations\nand are more likely to produce complex active regions that can trigger X-class\nsolar flares. Improving the identification and monitoring of long-lived active\nregion nests would benefit space weather forecasts in the short to medium term.",

The APOGEE data reveal three stellar populations\noccupying separate loci on canonical chemical planes. One population resembles\nmetal-poor halo field stars (P1), a second shows light-element abundance\nanti-correlations typical of metal-poor globular clusters (IM), and a third\npopulation (P2) is characterised by an extreme \"second-generation\" abundance\npattern. Both P1 and P2 populations cover a broad range of metallicity,\nconsistent with extended histories of bursty star formation (SF), which is also\nevident from their light- and $\\alpha$-element abundance patterns. Conversely,\nthe IM stars exhibit a narrow metallicity spread, combined with the Al-Mg,\nNa-O, and C-N anti-correlations common to metal-poor Galactic globular\nclusters. Moreover, these three populations alone seem to account for the\ndistribution of $\\omega$ Cen stars in the chromosome map. We discuss these\nfindings in context of a scenario according to which $\\omega$ Cen formed by a\ncombination of in situ SF within the host galaxy (P1), followed by the\nspiralling in of gas-rich globular clusters (IM), leading to another burst of\nSF (P2). We perform a robust comparison of the chemical composition of $\\omega$\nCen with those of halo substructures well represented in APOGEE DR17, finding\nno chemical associations to a high confidence level.",

MACER3D resolves gas dynamics from within the\nBondi radius ($\\sim 25\\,\\mathrm{pc}$) to halo scales. Combined with black hole\naccretion theory, it enables an accurate calculation of AGN outputs and\nsubsequently their large-scale feedback effects. We present results from\nsimulating an isolated elliptical galaxy with different feedback\nconfigurations. In the fiducial model with both AGN and supernova (SN)\nfeedback, the temporal evolution of AGN luminosity and star formation rate are\nstrongly correlated, suggesting shared dependence on the availability of gas\nsupply for SMBH accretion and star formation. AGN duty cycles of several\npercent with a single-cycle timescale of $\\sim 10^2\\,\\mathrm{Myr}$ agree with\nobservations, while models with only AGN or SN feedback fail to reproduce\nobserved cycles. While all models maintain a quiescent galaxy state, fiducial\nAGN+SN feedback model results in higher star formation than no-SN feedback,\nsuggesting SN feedback, when acting synergistically with AGN feedback, may\npositively impact star formation. Combined AGN and SN feedback enhances\nhalo-scale metal enrichment compared to single-feedback models. The simulated\nX-ray properties match observations and predict transient cavities produced by\ncold-mode AGN winds from past burst events. The differences between the results\nobtained by MACER2D and MACER3D are also discussed.",

If the\nacceleration is driven by magnetized turbulence, the main properties of the\nresulting proton and neutrino spectra can be deduced based on insights from\nparticle-in-cell simulations of magnetized turbulence. We have previously shown\nthat these properties are consistent with the TeV~neutrino signal observed from\nthe nearby active galaxy NGC 1068. In this work, we extend this result to a\npopulation study. We show that the produced neutrino flux depends mainly on the\nenergetics of the corona -- the relative fraction of X-ray, magnetic, and\nnon-thermal proton energy -- and on the spectral energy distribution of the\nAGN. We find that coronae with similar properties can explain neutrinos from\nthe candidate AGN for which IceCube has reported an excess, albeit less\nsignificant than NGC 1068. Building on this framework, we show how the neutrino\nsignal evolves with the AGN luminosity, and use this AGN sequence to predict\nthe diffuse neutrino flux from the extragalactic population, showing that it\ncan account for the diffuse neutrino signal observed by IceCube in the\n$\\sim$1-100 TeV energy range.",

Among several\nexplanations, one hypothesis suggests these cavities are carved by undetected\nstellar or planetary companions. We present a novel approach to quantify the\nlikelihood that a cavity-carving companion goes undetected because it is either\ntoo close to the star (i.e., has a small projected separation) or too faint to\nbe resolved. We generate two independent samples of stellar and planetary\ncompanions with random sky orientations, assuming distributions in\neccentricity, mass ratio, and time-weighted orbital phases, to study the\nstatistical properties of the cavities they produce. We calculate the\nlikelihood that a companion appears with a projected separation $d$ relative to\nits semi-major axis $a_{bin}$ ($d/a_{bin}$). Then, using a disc truncation\nmodel, we calculate the likelihood that companions carve a cavity with size\n$a_{cav}$ relative to its semi-major axis $a_{bin}$ and projected separation\n$d$, deriving distributions of $a_{bin}/a_{cav}$ and $d/a_{cav}$. We find that\nstellar companions carve cavities with median sizes ~3 times larger than their\nprojected separation $d$ ($a_{cav}\\sim3d$, $a_{cav}\\sim1.7 d$ for planets), but\nwith a statistically significant tail towards larger values ($a_{cav}\\gg 3d$).\nWe estimate the likelihood that cavity-carving companions go undetected due to\nprojection effects when the system is observed with spatial resolution $R$,\n$P(d< R)$. Considering observational constraints on companion masses, we apply\nthis framework to 13 well-known transition discs. We find that undetected\nstellar companions are unlikely in 8 out of 13 systems we considered, with 5\nnotable exceptions: ABAur, MWC758, HD135344B, CQTau and HD169142.

    "abstract": "The chemical evolution of galaxies is shaped by their star formation\nhistories and the exchange of gas with their environments. Metallicity provides\nkey insights into these processes, reflecting the interplay between star\nformation and gas flows. A fundamental aspect of this evolution is the\nmass-metallicity relation, which captures the strong correlation between a\ngalaxy stellar mass ($M_\\star$) and its gas-phase oxygen abundance. In this\nstudy, we use MUSE observations to analyze star-forming disc galaxies in 12\nclusters within the redshift range $0.3 < z < 0.5$. Galaxies were classified\ninto three groups: ram-pressure stripping (RPS), control cluster, and control\nfield. For the first time, we investigate the impact of RPS on gas-phase\nmetallicities across a wide mass range of galaxies at intermediate redshift,\ncomparing RPS galaxies to counterparts in both cluster and field environments.\nBy analyzing the integrated flux within galactic disks, our results reveal\nthat, on average, RPS induces a metallicity enhancement of 0.2 dex over\nnon-stripped galaxies. Contrary to the prevailing view that cluster membership\nalone drives metallicity enrichment, we find that control cluster galaxies\nexhibit metallicities comparable to field galaxies at a given $M_\\star$, with\nonly RPS galaxies displaying significantly higher metal content, highlighting\nthe unique role of RPS in shaping the chemical properties of galaxies. These\ndifferences become more pronounced at lower $M_\\star$, indicating that\nenvironmental influences play a more critical role in shaping the chemical\nevolution of lower-mass galaxies. Our findings suggest that both enhanced star\nformation rates and suppressed gas inflows -- consequences of ram pressure\nstripping -- drive the elevated metallicity observed in RPS galaxies.",

Our methodology, based on\nrobust Bayesian model selection, reveals the presence of multiple narrow\nemission lines at the expected redshift of the source and confirms (for\nH\\{beta}) and detects (for H{\\gamma}) the presence of redshifted broad\ncomponents. Additionally, we have discovered a very broad and, if it is\nassociated with the H\\{beta}, very redshifted component at {\\lambda} \\simeq\n5000{\\AA}. We evaluate two scenarios for explaining the observed broad emission\nline (BEL) in PG 1302-102. In the case in which the redshifted BEL asymmetry\narises from the orbital motion of a putative binary, our measurements coupled\nwith simple estimates of the broad-line region (BLR) sizes suggest that the\nindividual black hole BLRs are either settled in a single BLR or in the process\nof merging and, therefore truncated and highly disturbed. Alternatively, in the\nscenario of a single SMBH, we explain the distorted emission of the BELs with a\nnonsymmetric distribution of the BLR clouds; namely, a thin disk with a spiral\nperturbation. This BLR configuration is statistically preferred over any\nempirical multi-Gaussian fit and simultaneously explains the asymmetric\nemission of the H{\\beta} and H{\\gamma} close to the bulk of the line and any\nadditional excess (or the lack of it, in the case of the H{\\gamma}) at much\nlonger wavelengths. The physical origins of the perturbation are unclear, and a\nconnection with the possible presence of a black hole binary cannot be ruled\nout. Given the growing evidence from theoretical and observational works\ndemonstrating the common presence of disturbed BLRs in active galactic nuclei,\nwe argue that an origin related to self-gravitating instabilities may be more\nplausible.",

This mechanism\nproved effective at forming planetesimals in the fragmentation-limited inner\ndisk, but much less effective in the drift-limited outer disk, concluding that\ndust traps may be key to forming planets at wide orbital separations. Here we\nexplore a different hypothesis: That vortices host a feedback loop in which a\nvortex traps dust, boosting dust coagulation, which in turn boosts vortex\ntrapping. We combine an analytic model of vortex trapping with an analytic\nmodel of fragmentation limited grain growth that accounts for how dust\nconcentration dampens gas turbulence. We find a powerful synergy between vortex\ntrapping and dust growth. For $\\alpha \\le 10^{-3}$ and solar-like metallicity\nthis feedback loop consistently takes the grain size and dust density into the\nplanetesimal formation region of the streaming instability (SI). Only in the\nregime of strong turbulence ($\\alpha \\ge 3\\times 10^{-3}$) does the system\noften converge to a steady state below the SI criterion. The combination of\nvortex trapping with dust coagulation is an even more powerful mechanism than\nthe one involving the SI.

Applied to Buchwald-Hartwig reaction\noptimization, our method nearly doubles the discovery rate of high-performing\nreactions compared to static LLM embeddings (from 24% to 43% coverage of the\ntop 5% reactions in just 50 optimization iterations). We also observe a 14%\nimprovement over domain-specific representations without requiring specialized\nfeatures. Extensive empirical evaluation across 19 benchmarks - ranging from\ngeneral chemistry to reaction and molecular property optimization -\ndemonstrates our method's robustness, generality, and consistent improvements\nacross: (1) tasks, (2) LLM architectures (encoder, decoder, encoder-decoder),\n(3) pretraining domains (chemistry-related or general-purpose) and (4)\nhyperparameter settings (tuned once on a single dataset). Finally, we explain\nthese improvements: joint LLM-GP optimization through marginal likelihood\nimplicitly performs contrastive learning, aligning representations to produce\n(1) better-structured embedding spaces, (2) improved uncertainty calibration,\nand (3) more efficient sampling - without requiring any external loss. This\nwork provides both practical advances in sample-efficient optimization and\ninsights into what makes effective Bayesian optimization.",

Solving these tasks often involves long\ninference-time computations. In human problem solving, a common strategy to\nexpedite work is collaboration: by dividing the problem into sub-tasks,\nexploring different strategies concurrently, etc. Recent research has shown\nthat LLMs can also operate in parallel by implementing explicit cooperation\nframeworks, such as voting mechanisms or the explicit creation of independent\nsub-tasks that can be executed in parallel. However, each of these frameworks\nmay not be suitable for all types of tasks, which can hinder their\napplicability. In this work, we propose a different design approach: we run LLM\n\"workers\" in parallel , allowing them to synchronize via a concurrently-updated\nattention cache and prompt these workers to decide how best to collaborate. Our\napproach allows the LLM instances to come up with their own collaboration\nstrategy for the problem at hand, all the while \"seeing\" each other's memory in\nthe concurrent KV cache. We implement this approach via Hogwild! Inference: a\nparallel LLM inference engine where multiple instances of the same LLM run in\nparallel with the same attention cache, with \"instant\" access to each other's\nmemory. Hogwild! Inference takes advantage of Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE)\nto avoid recomputation while improving parallel hardware utilization.

    "abstract": "The fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect (FQAHE) is a fascinating\nemergent quantum state characterized by fractionally charged excitations in the\nabsence of magnetic field,which could arise from the intricate interplay\nbetween electron correlation, nontrivial topology and spontaneous time-reversal\nsymmetry breaking. Recently, FQAHE has been realized in aligned rhombohedral\npentalayer graphene on BN superlattice (aligned R5G/BN), where the topological\nflat band is modulated by the moir\\'e potential. However, intriguingly, the\nFQAHE is observed only when electrons are pushed away from the moir\\'e\ninterface. The apparently opposite implications from these experimental\nobservations, along with different theoretical models, have sparked intense\ndebates regarding the role of the moir\\'e potential. Unambiguous experimental\nobservation of the topological flat band as well as moir\\'e bands with energy\nand momentum resolved information is therefore critical to elucidate the\nunderlying mechanism. Here by performing nanospot angle-resolved photoemission\nspectroscopy (NanoARPES) measurements, we directly reveal the topological flat\nband electronic structures of R5G, from which key hopping parameters essential\nfor determining the fundamental electronic structure of rhombohedral graphene\nare extracted. Moreover, a comparison of electronic structures between aligned\nand non-aligned samples reveals that the moir\\'e potential plays a pivotal role\nin enhancing the topological flat band in the aligned sample. Our study\nprovides experimental guiding lines to narrow down the phase space of\nrhombohedral graphene, laying an important foundation for understanding exotic\nquantum phenomena in this emerging platform.",

One important type of PDR\nis the interface between HII regions and molecular clouds, where\nfar-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation from massive stars heats gas and dissociates\nmolecules. Photochemical models predict that the C/CO transition occurs deeper\nin the PDR compared to the H/H$_2$ transition in low-metallicity environments,\nincreasing the extent of CO-dark H$_2$ gas. This prediction has been difficult\nto test outside the Milky Way due to the lack of high spatial resolution\nobservations tracing H$_2$ and CO. This study examines a low-metallicity PDR in\nthe N13 region of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) where we spatially resolve\nthe ionization front, the H$_2$ dissociation front, and the C/CO transition\nusing 12CO J=2-1, 3-2 and [CI] (1-0) observations from the Atacama Large\nMillimeter/sub-mm Array (ALMA) and near-infrared spectroscopy of the H$_2$ 2.12\n1-0S(1) vibrational line, and H recombination lines from the James Webb Space\nTelescope (JWST). Our analysis shows that the separation between the H/H$_2$\nand C/CO boundaries is approximately 0.043 $\\pm$ 0.013(stat.) $\\pm$\n0.0036(syst.) pc (equivalent to 0\".146 $\\pm$ 0\".042(stat.) $\\pm$ 0\".012(syst.)\nat the SMC's distance of 62 kpc), defining the spatial extent of the CO-dark\nH$_2$ region. Compared to our plane-parallel PDR models, we find that a\nconstant pressure model matches the observed structure better than a constant\ndensity one. Overall, we find that the PDR model does well at predicting the\nextent of the CO-dark H$_2$ layer in N13. This study represents the first\nresolved benchmark for low metallicity PDRs.",

This can be hard to prove\nexperimentally, and most previous theoretical works have been based on models\nwhich either have continuously differentiable free energies, or no\nstraightforward way to determine the free energy. Here we build a free energy\nmodel based on the common definitions of the phases ; ordered ice-VIII,\norientationally disordered ice VII and proton-disordered ice X. All transitions\nin this model might or might not be associated with a discontinuity in the\nspecific heat, depending on paramaterization. By comparing with data, we find\nthat a VII-X transition line exists, but it ends in a critical point hidden\nwithin the stability field of phase VIII. If the model is correct, there is a\ndiscontinuity between VII and X, so they are separate phases.

    "abstract": "Much of federated learning (FL) focuses on settings where local dataset\nstatistics remain the same between training and testing. However, this\nassumption often does not hold in practice due to distribution shifts,\nmotivating the development of domain generalization (DG) approaches that\nleverage source domain data to train models capable of generalizing to unseen\ntarget domains. In this paper, we are motivated by two major gaps in existing\nwork on FL and DG: (1) the lack of formal mathematical analysis of DG\nobjectives; and (2) DG research in FL being limited to the star-topology\narchitecture. We develop Decentralized Federated Domain Generalization with\nStyle Sharing ($\\textit{StyleDDG}$), a decentralized DG algorithm which allows\ndevices in a peer-to-peer network to achieve DG based on sharing style\ninformation inferred from their datasets. Additionally, we provide the first\nsystematic approach to analyzing style-based DG training in decentralized\nnetworks. We cast existing centralized DG algorithms within our framework, and\nemploy their formalisms to model $\\textit{StyleDDG}$. We then obtain analytical\nconditions under which convergence of $\\textit{StyleDDG}$ can be guaranteed.\nThrough experiments on popular DG datasets, we demonstrate that\n$\\textit{StyleDDG}$ can obtain significant improvements in accuracy across\ntarget domains with minimal communication overhead compared to baseline\ndecentralized gradient methods.",

    "abstract": "Radio transients, such as pulsars and Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), are primarily\ndetected at centimetre radio wavelengths, where higher luminosities are found.\nHowever, observations of sources in dense environments are heavily affected by\npropagation effects which may hinder a detection. Millimetre wave observations\nbypass this complication but require the largest radio telescopes to compensate\nfor the lower flux densities. When used in phased mode, the ALMA radio\ntelescope provides an equivalent dish size of 84m, being the most sensitive\ninstrument at mm/sub mm. With its high time resolution it offers a unique\nopportunity to study radio transients in an unexplored window. We study the\nGalactic Centre (GC) magnetar, PSR J1745$-$2900, as a laboratory for magnetars\nin complex magneto-turbulent environments and to link with FRBs. We showcase\nthe potential of ALMA in phased mode to observe radio transients and to\nachieve, for some sources, the first ever detections outside the cm wave range.\nWe studied the GC magnetar using ALMA archival data of Sgr A* at Band 3 from\nthe 2017 GMVA campaign. We searched in intensity and classified the pulses\nbased on their circular and linear polarisation properties and arrival phase.\nWe detected eight pulses with energies in the range of 10$^{29}$ erg. We\nconstructed its cumulative energy distribution and we fit a power law, where\nthe event rate scales with energy as $R \\propto E^{\\gamma}$. The result is an\nexponent of $\\gamma = -2.4 \\pm 0.1$. With the $\\gamma -$value and the system\nproperties of phased ALMA, we estimate that over 160 known pulsars could be\ndetected by ALMA. For repeating FRBs, observing during their peak activity\nwindow could lead to several detections. We expect that ALMA's lower frequency\nbands with polarisation capabilities, will serve as a pioneer on mm wave\nsearches for pulsars and to study complex environments involving radio\ntransients.",

Recent approaches have\ninvestigated training-free strategies to enable high-resolution image synthesis\nwith pre-trained models. However, these techniques often struggle with\ngenerating high-quality visuals and tend to exhibit artifacts or low-fidelity\ndetails, as they typically rely solely on the endpoint of the low-resolution\nsampling trajectory while neglecting intermediate states that are critical for\npreserving structure and synthesizing finer detail. To this end, we present\nHiFlow, a training-free and model-agnostic framework to unlock the resolution\npotential of pre-trained flow models. Specifically, HiFlow establishes a\nvirtual reference flow within the high-resolution space that effectively\ncaptures the characteristics of low-resolution flow information, offering\nguidance for high-resolution generation through three key aspects:\ninitialization alignment for low-frequency consistency, direction alignment for\nstructure preservation, and acceleration alignment for detail fidelity. By\nleveraging such flow-aligned guidance, HiFlow substantially elevates the\nquality of high-resolution image synthesis of T2I models and demonstrates\nversatility across their personalized variants.

As a first validation they proved the conjecture for\nquasilinear Schr\\\"odinger flows.\n  In the present article we expand the reach of these ideas and methods to the\ncase of quasilinear ultrahyperbolic Schr\\\"odinger flows, which is the first\nexample with a nonconvex dispersion relation.\n  The study of local well-posedness for this class of problems, in all\ndimensions, was initiated in pioneering work of Kenig-Ponce-Vega for localized\ninitial data, and then continued by Marzuola-Metcalfe-Tataru (MMT) and\nPineau-Taylor (PT) for initial data in Sobolev spaces in the elliptic and\nnon-elliptic cases, respectively.\n  Our results here mirror the earlier results in the elliptic case: (i) a new,\npotentially sharp local well-posedness result in low regularity Sobolev spaces,\none derivative below MMT and just one-half derivative above scaling, (ii) a\nsmall data global well-posedness and scattering result at the same regularity\nlevel. One key novelty in this setting is the introduction of a new family of\ninteraction Morawetz functionals which are suitable for obtaining bilinear\nestimates in the ultrahyperbolic setting.

Under the electron\nbeam, we observe that 3-point star-style cracks grow on the surface of FAPbBr3,\nand bricklayer-style cracks are formed on the surface of MAPbBr3. Under the\nX-ray beam, a new composition without organic components appears in both\nFAPbBr3 and MAPbBr3. Such cracking and composition changes are attributed to\nthe volatilization of organic components. We propose a volume-strain-based\nmechanism, in which the energy conversion results from the organic cation loss.\nUsing nanoindentation, we reveal that beam radiations reduce the Youngs modulus\nand increase the hardness of both OIHPs. This study provides valuable insights\ninto the structural and mechanical stabilities of OIHP single crystals in\nradiation environments.",

The effectiveness of these systems, both in\nterms of the calibre and cognitive difficulty of the resulting questions,\ndepends heavily on the quality and modelling approach of the underlying\nontologies, making it crucial to assess their fitness for this task. To date,\nthere has been no comprehensive investigation into the specific ontology\naspects or characteristics that affect the question generation process.\nTherefore, this paper proposes a set of requirements and task-specific metrics\nfor evaluating the fitness of ontologies for question generation tasks in\npedagogical settings. Using the ROMEO methodology (a structured framework used\nfor identifying task-specific metrics), a set of evaluation metrics have been\nderived from an expert assessment of questions generated by a question\ngeneration model. To validate the proposed metrics, we apply them to a set of\nontologies previously used in question generation to illustrate how the metric\nscores align with and complement findings reported in earlier studies. The\nanalysis confirms that ontology characteristics significantly impact the\neffectiveness of question generation, with different ontologies exhibiting\nvarying performance levels. This highlights the importance of assessing\nontology quality with respect to Automatic Question Generation (AQG) tasks.",

However, we have observed that\nexisting PEFT methods, which are often designed with natural imagery in mind,\nstruggle when applied to Remote Sensing (RS) scenarios. This is primarily due\nto their inability to handle artifact influences, a problem particularly severe\nin RS image features. To tackle this challenge, we introduce Earth-Adapter, the\nfirst PEFT method specifically designed for RS artifacts conquering.\nEarth-Adapter introduces a novel Mixture of Frequency Adaptation process that\ncombines a Mixture of Adapter (MoA) with Discrete Fourier Transformation (DFT).\nBy utilizing DFT, Earth-Adapter can decompose features into different frequency\ncomponents, precisely separating artifacts from original features. The MoA then\ndynamically assigns weights to each adapter expert, allowing for the\ncombination of features across various frequency domains. These\nsimple-yet-effective approaches enable Earth-Adapter to more efficiently\novercome the disturbances caused by artifacts than previous PEFT methods,\nsignificantly enhancing the FMs' performance on RS scenarios. Experiments on\nDomain Adaptation (DA), and Domain Generalization (DG) semantic segmentation\nbenchmarks showcase the Earth-Adapter's effectiveness.

In this work, we\nconceptualize this effect as the $\\textit{data compliance gap}$ (DCG), which\nquantifies the performance difference between models trained on datasets that\ncomply with web crawling opt-outs, and those that do not. We measure the data\ncompliance gap in two settings: pretraining models from scratch and continual\npretraining from existing compliant models (simulating a setting where\ncopyrighted data could be integrated later in pretraining). Our experiments\nwith 1.5B models show that, as of January 2025, compliance with web data\nopt-outs does not degrade general knowledge acquisition (close to 0\\% DCG).\nHowever, in specialized domains such as biomedical research, excluding major\npublishers leads to performance declines.

Quantum strategies with entangled states can\nachieve better sensing accuracies with the same probe energy, yet it is often\nsimpler to use classical probes with higher energy than to take advantage of\nthe quantum regime. Recently, it has been shown that useful quantum advantage\ncan be achieved in covert situations, where sensing has to be performed while\nalso avoiding detection by an adversary: here increasing energy is not a viable\nstratagem, as it facilitates the adversary. In this paper we introduce a\ngeneral framework to assess and quantify quantum advantage in covert\nsituations. This is based on extending the information bottleneck principle,\noriginally developed for communication and machine learning applications, to\ndecision problems via the Chernoff information, with the ultimate goal of\nquantitatively optimizing the trade-off between covertness and sensing ability.\nIn this context we show how quantum resources, namely entangled photonic probes\npaired with photon counting, greatly outperform classical coherent transmitters\nin target detection and ranging, while also maintaining a chosen level of\ncovertness.

    "abstract": "Considerable progress has been made in the recent literature studies to\ntackle the Algorithms Selection and Parametrization (ASP) problem, which is\ndiversified in multiple meta-learning setups. Yet there is a lack of surveys\nand comparative evaluations that critically analyze, summarize and assess the\nperformance of existing methods. In this paper, we provide an overview of the\nstate of the art in this continuously evolving field. The survey sheds light on\nthe motivational reasons for pursuing classifiers selection through\nmeta-learning. In this regard, Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) is usually\ntreated as an ASP problem under the umbrella of the democratization of machine\nlearning. Accordingly, AutoML makes machine learning techniques accessible to\ndomain scientists who are interested in applying advanced analytics but lack\nthe required expertise. It can ease the task of manually selecting ML\nalgorithms and tuning related hyperparameters. We comprehensively discuss the\ndifferent phases of classifiers selection based on a generic framework that is\nformed as an outcome of reviewing prior works. Subsequently, we propose a\nbenchmark knowledge base of 4 millions previously learned models and present\nextensive comparative evaluations of the prominent methods for classifiers\nselection based on 08 classification algorithms and 400 benchmark datasets. The\ncomparative study quantitatively assesses the performance of algorithms\nselection methods along while emphasizing the strengths and limitations of\nexisting studies.",

While beneficial, they usually require the\nhuge computation and memory cost when handling large-size segmentation, which\nlimits their applications in foundation model building and real-world clinical\nscenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a holistically efficient\nframework for high-resolution medical image segmentation, called HER-Seg.\nSpecifically, we first devise a computation-efficient image encoder\n(CE-Encoder) to model long-range dependencies with linear complexity while\nmaintaining sufficient representations. In particular, we introduce the\ndual-gated linear attention (DLA) mechanism to perform cascaded token\nfiltering, selectively retaining important tokens while ignoring irrelevant\nones to enhance attention computation efficiency. Then, we introduce a\nmemory-efficient mask decoder (ME-Decoder) to eliminate the demand for the\nhierarchical structure by leveraging cross-scale segmentation decoding.\nExtensive experiments reveal that HER-Seg outperforms state-of-the-arts in\nhigh-resolution medical 2D, 3D and video segmentation tasks. In particular, our\nHER-Seg requires only 0.59GB training GPU memory and 9.39G inference FLOPs per\n1024$\\times$1024 image, demonstrating superior memory and computation\nefficiency.

    "abstract": "Link prediction is a crucial graph-learning task with applications including\ncitation prediction and product recommendation. Distilling Graph Neural\nNetworks (GNNs) teachers into Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) students has\nemerged as an effective approach to achieve strong performance and reducing\ncomputational cost by removing graph dependency. However, existing distillation\nmethods only use standard GNNs and overlook alternative teachers such as\nspecialized model for link prediction (GNN4LP) and heuristic methods (e.g.,\ncommon neighbors). This paper first explores the impact of different teachers\nin GNN-to-MLP distillation. Surprisingly, we find that stronger teachers do not\nalways produce stronger students: MLPs distilled from GNN4LP can underperform\nthose distilled from simpler GNNs, while weaker heuristic methods can teach\nMLPs to near-GNN performance with drastically reduced training costs. Building\non these insights, we propose Ensemble Heuristic-Distilled MLPs (EHDM), which\neliminates graph dependencies while effectively integrating complementary\nsignals via a gating mechanism. Experiments on ten datasets show an average\n7.93% improvement over previous GNN-to-MLP approaches with 1.95-3.32 times less\ntraining time, indicating EHDM is an efficient and effective link prediction\nmethod.",

In this work we\ninvestigated the crystalline dependent anisotropic magnetoresistance in\nepitaxial Fe85Co15 films and discuss the magnetization process through the\nmagnetotransport properties by varying the relative orientations between the\nelectric current, the external magnetic field and the Fe85Co15 crystallographic\ndirections.

We fit our experimental data\nusing the Stoner-Wohlfarth model to describe the path followed by the\nmagnetization during the magnetization process and to extract the anisotropy\nconstants. The fitted cubic and uniaxial anisotropy constants are Kc = 21 kJ/m3\nand Ku = 11 kJ/m3, which are comparable with reported values from the angular\nvariation of ferromagnetic resonance experiments.

In this\nwork, we assess the validity of the Effective Field Theory of Large Scale\nStructure (EFTofLSS) and the IR-resummation scheme of PyBird in the context of\nprimordial (oscillatory) features. We find an excellent agreement at the level\nof the matter power spectrum between N-body simulations and the one-loop EFT\npredictions, for models commonly studied in the literature.

We demonstrate that\nwhile such features can improve the fit to cosmic microwave background (CMB)\ndata, they may result in a poorer fit to clustering measurements at low\nredshift. The resulting constraints on the amplitude of the primordial\noscillations are competitive with those obtained from CMB data, despite the\nwell-known damping of oscillations due to non-linear structure formation\nprocesses. For the first time in this context, we jointly analyze the galaxy\npower spectrum (monopole and quadrupole) in combination with Planck CMB data to\nderive strong constraints on the amplitude of primordial features.

To overcome these challenges, we propose Flash\nSculptor in this paper, a simple yet effective framework for compositional 3D\nscene/object reconstruction from a single image. At the heart of Flash Sculptor\nlies a divide-and-conquer strategy, which decouples compositional scene\nreconstruction into a sequence of sub-tasks, including handling the appearance,\nrotation, scale, and translation of each individual instance. Specifically, for\nrotation, we introduce a coarse-to-fine scheme that brings the best of both\nworlds--efficiency and accuracy--while for translation, we develop an\noutlier-removal-based algorithm that ensures robust and precise parameters in a\nsingle step, without any iterative optimization. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that Flash Sculptor achieves at least a 3 times speedup over\nexisting compositional 3D methods, while setting new benchmarks in\ncompositional 3D reconstruction performance.

Second, the extent to which distillation can work under realistic\ndevice noise is less well-studied. In this work, we both simulate distillation\nusing a variety of device noise models and perform distillation experiments on\nfixed-frequency IBM devices.

In particular, these\ntechniques adopt large antenna arrays and formulate narrow beams to obtain\nsatisfactory received powers. However, performing accurate beam alignment over\nnarrow beams for efficient link configuration by traditional standard defined\nbeam selection approaches, which mainly rely on channel state information and\nbeam sweeping through exhaustive searching, imposes computational and\ncommunications overheads. And, such resulting overheads limit their potential\nuse in vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V)\ncommunications involving highly dynamic scenarios. In comparison, utilizing\nout-of-band contextual information, such as sensing data obtained from sensor\ndevices, provides a better alternative to reduce overheads. This paper presents\na deep learning-based solution for utilizing the multi-modality sensing data\nfor predicting the optimal beams having sufficient mmWave received powers so\nthat the best V2I and V2V line-of-sight links can be ensured proactively. The\nproposed solution has been tested on real-world measured mmWave sensing and\ncommunication data, and the results show that it can achieve up to 98.19%\naccuracies while predicting top-13 beams. Correspondingly, when compared to\nexisting been sweeping approach, the beam sweeping searching space and time\noverheads are greatly shortened roughly by 79.67% and 91.89%, respectively\nwhich confirm a promising solution for beamforming in mmWave enabled\ncommunications.",

The\ncomparison of the position-velocity (PV) and position-position-velocity (PPV)\ndiagrams with existing theoretical models suggests that rotation, central\ncollapse, and end-dominated collapse are not responsible for the observed gas\nmotion in the filament.

However, significant influence of differential diffusion\neffects on local structure of flame reaction zones and bulk burning velocity is\nwell pronounced in all cases, even at Ka as high as 1315. Therefore, a decrease\nin magnitude of superadiabatic local temperature with increasing Karlovitz\nnumber or even negligible probability of finding such a high temperature at\nhigh Ka is not an evidence that differential diffusion effects play a minor\nrole under such conditions.

    "abstract": "Despite recent advances in Artificial Intelligence, the use of chatbot\ntechnology in customer service continues to face adoption hurdles. This paper\nexplores reasons for these adoption hurdles and tests several service design\nlevers to increase chatbot uptake. We use incentivized online experiments to\nstudy chatbot uptake in a variety of scenarios. The results of these\nexperiments are threefold. First, people respond positively to improvements in\nchatbot performance; however, the chatbot channel is utilized less frequently\nthan expected-time minimization would predict. A key driver of this\nunderutilization is the reluctance to engage with a gatekeeper process, i.e., a\nprocess with an imperfect initial service stage and possible transfer to a\nsecond, expert service stage -- a behavior we term \"gatekeeper aversion\". We\nshow that gatekeeper aversion can be further amplified by a secondary hurdle,\nalgorithm aversion. Second, chatbot uptake can be increased by providing\ncustomers with average waiting times in the chatbot channel, as well as by\nbeing more transparent about chatbot capabilities and limitations. Third,\nmethodologically, we show that chatbot adoption can depend on experimental\nimplementation. In particular, chatbot adoption decreases further as (i) stakes\nare increased, (ii) the human/algorithmic nature of the server is manipulated\nwith more realism. Our results suggest that firms should continue to prioritize\ninvestments in chatbot technology. However, less expensive, process-related\ninterventions can also be effective. These may include being more transparent\nabout the types of queries that are (or are not) suitable for chatbots,\nemphasizing chatbot reliability and quick resolution times, as well as\nproviding faster live agent access to customers who experienced chatbot\nfailure.",

    "abstract": "Software requirements expressed in natural language (NL) frequently suffer\nfrom verbosity, ambiguity, and inconsistency. This creates a range of\nchallenges, including selecting an appropriate architecture for a system and\nassessing different architectural alternatives. Relying on human expertise to\naccomplish the task of mapping NL requirements to architecture is\ntime-consuming and error-prone. This paper proposes ARLO, an approach that\nautomates this task by leveraging (1) a set of NL requirements for a system,\n(2) an existing standard that specifies architecturally relevant software\nquality attributes, and (3) a readily available Large Language Model (LLM).\nSpecifically, ARLO determines the subset of NL requirements for a given system\nthat is architecturally relevant and maps that subset to a tailorable matrix of\narchitectural choices. ARLO applies integer linear programming on the\narchitectural-choice matrix to determine the optimal architecture for the\ncurrent requirements. We demonstrate ARLO's efficacy using a set of real-world\nexamples. We highlight ARLO's ability (1) to trace the selected architectural\nchoices to the requirements and (2) to isolate NL requirements that exert a\nparticular influence on a system's architecture. This allows the\nidentification, comparative assessment, and exploration of alternative\narchitectural choices based on the requirements and constraints expressed\ntherein.",

By leveraging\nreinforcement learning, Adv-RM trains a policy to generate adversarial examples\nthat reliably expose vulnerabilities in large state-of-the-art reward models\nsuch as Nemotron 340B RM. Incorporating these adversarial examples into the\nreward training process improves the robustness of RMs, mitigating reward\nhacking and enhancing downstream performance in RLHF.

Our results\non the end-to-end Spiking-VGG11 model demonstrate a significant 4.39x speedup\nand an increase in utilization from 9.28% to 52.3% compared to a non-streaming\nparallel baseline. Additionally, we achieve an energy efficiency gain of 3.46x\nover LSMCore and a performance gain of 2.38x over Loihi.",

    "abstract": "In this article, we investigate the gravitational baryogenesis mechanism in\nthe framework of Extended Proca-Nuevo (EPN) gravity, a theory where a massive\nvector field is non-minimally coupled to the curvature. This analysis is\ncarried out for an early universe, encompassing three separate cosmological\nscenarios defined by power-law, exponential, and modified exponential scale\nfactors. By deriving the modified field equations from the EPN action, we\nobtain precise solutions for each scale factor, including the influence of the\nvector field. We compute the baryon-to-entropy ratio using the gravitational\nbaryogenesis formalism, where the baryon asymmetry arises from a dynamical\ncoupling of the baryon current with the derivative of the Ricci scalar. Our\nfindings demonstrate that the baryon-to-entropy ratio is consistent with\nobservational constraints in all scenarios, highlighting the potential of EPN\ngravity as a viable theory to explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the\nearly universe. The study further stresses the contribution of anisotropy and\nvector field dynamics to the cosmological evolution within modified gravity\nmodels.",

The study of these transition regions allows us to\nidentify the real potentials and inherent limitations of the most commonly used\noptical spectroscopy techniques. Here, we measure and explain the co-existence\nbetween bandgap modulation and non-invasive spectroscopy in the case of\nresonant perturbative nonlinear optics in an atomically thin direct gap\nsemiconductor.

These methods are gaining promising performance\nand increasing attention for the rapid development of large language models.\nAccording to the property of the language models, the more related and specific\ncontext information the input query provides, the more discriminative the\nresultant embedding will be.

    "abstract": "Safety is critical during human-robot interaction. But -- because people are\ninherently unpredictable -- it is often difficult for robots to plan safe\nbehaviors. Instead of relying on our ability to anticipate humans, here we\nidentify robot policies that are robust to unexpected human decisions. We\nachieve this by formulating human-robot interaction as a zero-sum game, where\n(in the worst case) the human's actions directly conflict with the robot's\nobjective. Solving for the Nash Equilibrium of this game provides robot\npolicies that maximize safety and performance across a wide range of human\nactions. Existing approaches attempt to find these optimal policies by\nleveraging Hamilton-Jacobi analysis (which is intractable) or linear-quadratic\napproximations (which are inexact). By contrast, in this work we propose a\ncomputationally efficient and theoretically justified method that converges\ntowards the Nash Equilibrium policy. Our approach (which we call MCLQ)\nleverages linear-quadratic games to obtain an initial guess at safe robot\nbehavior, and then iteratively refines that guess with a Monte Carlo search.\nNot only does MCLQ provide real-time safety adjustments, but it also enables\nthe designer to tune how conservative the robot is -- preventing the system\nfrom focusing on unrealistic human behaviors.

    "abstract": "Understanding whether cosmic acceleration arises from a cosmological constant\nor a dynamical component is a central goal of cosmology, and the Dark Energy\nSpectroscopic Instrument (DESI) enables stringent tests with high-precision\ndistance measurements. We analyze baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO)\nmeasurements from DESI Data Release 1 (DR1) and Data Release 2 (DR2), combined\nwith Type Ia supernovae and a cosmic microwave background (CMB) distance prior.\nWith the larger statistical power and wider redshift coverage of DR2, the\npreference for dynamical dark energy does not diminish relative to DR1. Using\nboth a shape-function reconstruction and non-parametric approaches with a\nHorndeski-motivated correlation prior, we find that the dark-energy equation of\nstate $w(z)$ varies with redshift. BAO data alone yield modest constraints, but\nin combination with independent supernova compilations and the CMB prior they\nstrengthen the evidence for dynamics. Bayesian model comparison shows moderate\nsupport for departures from $\\Lambda$CDM when multiple degrees of freedom in\n$w(z)$ are allowed, corresponding to $\\approx3\\sigma$ tension with $\\Lambda$CDM\n(and higher for some data sets). Despite methodological differences, our\nresults are consistent with companion DESI papers, underscoring the\ncomplementarity of approaches.

    "abstract": "We call a projective Calabi-Yau (CY) 3-fold almost generic if it has only\nisolated nodes as singularities and the homology classes of all of the\nexceptional curves in an analytic small resolution are non-trivial but torsion.\nSuch a Calabi-Yau supports a topologically non-trivial flat B-field and the\ncorresponding A-model topological string partition function encodes a torsion\nrefinement of the Gopakumar-Vafa invariants of the smooth deformation. Our goal\nin this paper is to find new examples of almost generic CY 3-folds, using both\nconifold transitions as well as the integral structure of the periods of the\nmirrors. In this way we explicitly construct two quintic CY 3-folds with\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2$-torsion, two octics with $\\mathbb{Z}_3$-torsion and deduce the\nexistence of a complete intersection\n$X_{(6,6)}\\subset\\mathbb{P}^5_{1,1,2,2,3,3}$ with $\\mathbb{Z}_5$-torsion. Via\nmirror symmetry, the examples give new geometric interpretations to several\nAESZ Calabi-Yau operators. The mirror periods of the almost generic $X_{(6,6)}$\nwith non-trivial B-field topology are annihilated by an irrational Picard-Fuchs\noperator. We describe how the usual integral structure of the periods has to be\nmodified and in all of the cases we calculate the monodromies around the\nsingular points to verify integrality. Additional points of maximally unipotent\nmonodromy in the moduli spaces lead us to find several more examples of smooth\nor almost generic CY 3-folds and to conjecture new twisted derived\nequivalences. We integrate the holomorphic anomaly equations and extract the\ntorsion refined Gopakumar-Vafa invariants up to varying genus. For our\nconstruction of the almost generic octic CY 3-folds, we also give a short\nintroduction to the subject of hypermatrices and hyperdeterminants.",

Coupled with\na mass consumption society, there is a risk of detrimental social outcomes and\nthreats to democracy, such as misinformation and political polarization. But\nAI, robotics and other emerging technologies could also provide a transition to\ncommunity-based economies, in which more democratic, egalitarian, and\nsustainable value circulations can be established. Based on both a review of\ncase studies, and our own experiments in Detroit, we derive three core\nprinciples for the use of computing in community-based economies. The\nprefigurative principle requires that the development process itself\nincorporates equity goals, rather than viewing equity as something to be\nachieved in the future. The generative principle requires the prevention of\nvalue extraction, and its replacement by circulations in which value is\nreturned back to the aspects of labor, nature, and society by which it is\ngenerated. And third, the solidarity principle requires that deployments at all\nscales and across all domains support both individual freedoms and\nopportunities for mutual aid. Thus we propose the use of computational\ntechnologies to develop a specifically generative form of community-based\neconomy: one that is egalitarian regarding race, class and gender; sustainable\nboth environmentally and socially; and democratic in the deep sense of putting\npeople in control of their own lives and livelihoods.",

The INS reveals\ntwo distinct spin wave excitations below TN: one at 5.6 meV and the other at\n10-15 meV. By accompanying the INS spectra based on a linear spin wave theory\nusing SpinW software and machine learning force fields (MLFFs), we show that\nBa5Ru3O12 exhibits spin frustration due to competing exchange interactions\nbetween neighboring and next-neighboring Ru-moments, exchange anisotropy, and\nstrong spin-orbit coupling, which yields a non-collinear spin structure, in\ncontrast to other ruthenate trimers in this series. Interestingly, these\nmagnetic excitations do not completely vanish even at high temperatures above\nTN, evidencing short-range magnetic correlations in this trimer system. This is\nfurther supported by muSR spectroscopy, which exhibits a gradual drop in the\ninitial asymmetry around the magnetic phase transition and is further verified\nthrough maximum entropy analysis. The results of muSR spectroscopy indicate a\ndynamic nature of magnetic order, attributed to local magnetic anisotropy\nwithin the trimer as a result of local structural distortion and different\nhybridization, consistent with canted spin-structure.

Under this setting, a detailed\nexamination of the co-evolution of individual strategies and resource\nallocation is carried. Through extensive simulations, we find that the\nadvantageous environment mechanism not only significantly increases the\nproportion of cooperators in the system but also influences the resource\ndistribution among individuals. Additionally, limited resources reinforce\ncooperative behaviors within the system while shaping the evolutionary dynamics\nand strategic interactions across different dilemmas.

Our\nresults show that this mechanism not only reduces disparities in resource\ndistribution across the entire system and among individuals in different\ndilemmas but also significantly enhances cooperative behavior in higher\nresource intervals.

    "abstract": "Several mating restriction techniques have been implemented in Evolutionary\nAlgorithms to promote diversity. From similarity-based selection to niche\npreservation, the general goal is to avoid premature convergence by not having\nfitness pressure as the single evolutionary force. In a way, such methods can\nresemble the mechanisms involved in Sexual Selection, although generally\nassuming a simplified approach. Recently, a selection method called mating\nPreferences as Ideal Mating Partners (PIMP) has been applied to GP, providing\npromising results both in performance and diversity maintenance. The method\nmimics Mate Choice through the unbounded evolution of personal preferences\nrather than having a single set of rules to shape parent selection. As such,\nPIMP allows ideal mate representations to evolve freely, thus potentially\ntaking advantage of Sexual Selection as a dynamic secondary force to fitness\npressure. However, it is still unclear how mating preferences affect the\noverall population and how dependent they are on set-up choices. In this work,\nwe tracked the evolution of individual preferences through different mutation\ntypes, searching for patterns and evidence of self-reinforcement. Results\nsuggest that mating preferences do not stand on their own, relying on subtree\nmutation to avoid convergence to single-node trees. Nevertheless, they\nconsistently promote smaller and more balanced solutions depth-wise than a\nstandard tournament selection, reducing the impact of bloat. Furthermore, when\ncoupled with subtree mutation it also results in more solution diversity with\nstatistically significant results.",

Significantly, we obtain our results without imposing growth\nrestrictions on the nonlinearity or the underlying space {\\em a priori}.\n  The key findings are as follows: a completely new smoothing estimate for the\naction of the heat semigroup between two arbitrary Orlicz spaces; sufficient\nconditions for local and global (for small initial data) well-posedness in the\nMorse-Transue space; a comparison principle in the case of monotone\nnonlinearities; for nonlinearities enjoying additional structure (e.g.\nconvexity) and growing sufficiently rapidly at infinity (as measured by the\nvariation of $\\log f$), an explicit characterisation of a critical\nMorse-Transue space for local well-posedness.",

Intrusion detection\npromises to quickly detect such attacks and mitigate the worst consequences.\nHowever, public datasets of realistic scenarios are vital to evaluate these\nsystems.

In total, Sherlock covers three scenarios with various\nattacks manipulating the process state by injecting malicious commands or\nmanipulating measurement values. We additionally test five recently-published\nintrusion detection systems on Sherlock, highlighting specific challenges for\nintrusion detection in power grids.

We show that, in a\nsuitable parameter regime, the interplay between rotating magnetic fields and\nspatially modulated interwire tunnelings leads to the opening of gaps in the\nbulk and surface spectrum of the system, while one or more chiral hinge states\npropagating along a closed path of one-dimensional hinges are left gapless. The\nexact path of these hinge states is determined by the hierarchy of interwire\ncouplings and the boundary termination of the sample. Depending on the ratio\nbetween the period of the rotating magnetic field and the Fermi wavelength, our\nmodel can realize both integer and fractional chiral SOTIs. The fractional\nregime emerges in the presence of strong electron-electron interactions and\nfeatures hinge states carrying only a fraction $e/p$ of the electronic charge\n$e$ for a positive odd integer $p$.",

    "abstract": "Fossil magnetic fields of early-type stars are typically characterised by\nsymmetric or slightly distorted oblique dipolar surface geometries. Contrary to\nthis trend, the late-B magnetic chemically peculiar star HD 57372 exhibits an\nunusually large rotational variation of its mean magnetic field modulus,\nsuggesting a highly atypical field configuration. In this study, we present a\nZeeman Doppler imaging analysis of HD 57372, revealing an exceptionally\nasymmetric bipolar magnetic topology, rarely observed in early-type stars.\nAccording to our magnetic field maps, reconstructed from the intensity and\ncircular polarisation profiles of Fe, Cr, and Ti lines, approximately 66 per\ncent of the stellar surface is covered by a diffuse outward-directed radial\nfield, with local field strengths reaching 11.6 kG, while the remaining 34 per\ncent hosts a highly concentrated inward-directed field with a strong horizontal\ncomponent and a peak strength of 17.8 kG. These unusual surface magnetic field\ncharacteristics make HD 57372 a notable object for testing fossil-field\ntheories and interpreting phase-resolved spectropolarimetric observations of\nearly-type stars.",

    "abstract": "LLM training is scaled up to 10Ks of GPUs by a mix of data-(DP) and\nmodel-parallel (MP) execution. Critical to achieving efficiency is\ntensor-parallel (TP; a form of MP) execution within tightly-coupled subsets of\nGPUs, referred to as a scale-up domain, and the larger the scale-up domain the\nbetter the performance. New datacenter architectures are emerging with more\nGPUs able to be tightly-coupled in a scale-up domain, such as moving from 8\nGPUs to 72 GPUs connected via NVLink. Unfortunately, larger scale-up domains\nincrease the blast-radius of failures, with a failure of single GPU potentially\nimpacting TP execution on the full scale-up domain, which can degrade overall\nLLM training throughput dramatically. With as few as 0.1% of GPUs being in a\nfailed state, a high TP-degree job can experience nearly 10% reduction in LLM\ntraining throughput. We propose nonuniform-tensor-parallelism (NTP) to mitigate\nthis amplified impact of GPU failures. In NTP, a DP replica that experiences\nGPU failures operates at a reduced TP degree, contributing throughput equal to\nthe percentage of still-functional GPUs. We also propose a rack-design with\nimproved electrical and thermal capabilities in order to sustain power-boosting\nof scale-up domains that have experienced failures; combined with NTP, this can\nallow the DP replica with the reduced TP degree (i.e., with failed GPUs) to\nkeep up with the others, thereby achieving near-zero throughput loss for\nlarge-scale LLM training.",

    "abstract": "Local-nonlocal coupling approaches provide a means to combine the\ncomputational efficiency of local models and the accuracy of nonlocal models.\nTo facilitate the coupling of the two models, non-matching grids are often\ndesirable as nonlocal grids usually require a finer resolution than local\ngrids. In that case, it is often convenient to resort to interpolation\noperators so that models can exchange information in the overlap regions when\nnodes from the two grids do not coincide. This paper studies three existing\ncoupling approaches, namely 1) a method that enforces matching displacements in\nan overlap region, 2) a variant that enforces a constraint on the stresses\ninstead, and 3) a method that considers a variable horizon in the vicinity of\nthe interfaces. The effect of the interpolation order and of the grid ratio on\nthe performance of the three coupling methods with non-matching grids is\ncarefully studied on one-dimensional examples using polynomial manufactured\nsolutions. The numerical results show that the degree of the interpolants\nshould be chosen with care to avoid introducing additional modeling errors, or\nsimply minimize these errors, in the coupling approach.",

The high-fidelity scattering equations are solved with the matrix\nNumerov method, a reformulation of the popular Numerov recurrence relation for\nsolving special second-order differential equations as a linear system of\ncoupled equations. A novel error estimator based on reduced-space residuals is\napplied to an active learning approach (a greedy algorithm) to choosing\ntraining samples (\"snapshots\") for the emulator and contrasted with a proper\northogonal decomposition (POD) approach. Both approaches allow for\ncomputationally efficient offline-online decompositions, but the greedy\napproach requires much fewer snapshot calculations. These developments set the\ngroundwork for emulating scattering observables based on chiral nucleon-nucleon\nand three-nucleon interactions and optical models, where computational\nspeed-ups are necessary for Bayesian uncertainty quantification. Our emulators\nand error estimators are widely applicable to linear systems.",

However, manually selecting standard frames is\ntime-consuming and prone to intra- and inter-sonographer variability. Existing\nmethods primarily rely on image-based approaches that capture standard frames\nand then classify the input frames across different anatomies. This ignores the\ndynamic nature of video acquisition and its interpretation. To address these\nchallenges, we introduce Multi-Tier Class-Aware Token Transformer (MCAT), a\nvisual query-based video clip localization (VQ-VCL) method, to assist\nsonographers by enabling them to capture a quick US sweep. By then providing a\nvisual query of the anatomy they wish to analyze, MCAT returns the video clip\ncontaining the standard frames for that anatomy, facilitating thorough\nscreening for potential anomalies. We evaluate MCAT on two ultrasound video\ndatasets and a natural image VQ-VCL dataset based on Ego4D. Our model\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods by 10% and 13% mIoU on the ultrasound\ndatasets and by 5.35% mIoU on the Ego4D dataset, using 96% fewer tokens. MCAT's\nefficiency and accuracy have significant potential implications for public\nhealth, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where it may\nenhance prenatal care by streamlining standard plane acquisition, simplifying\nUS-based screening, diagnosis and allowing sonographers to examine more\npatients.",

At the radio band, even though\nthe filament is difficult to identify in its early phase, it rapidly became\ndistinct and formed a continuous loop-like dark structure during the eruption,\ni.e., so-called radio depression. Compared with the fragmentation of the\nerupting filament observed at the Ha and EUV bands, the radio depression\nappeared more coherently. Based on synthetic radio images from a\nthree-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulation of a flux-rope-filament\neruption, it is suggested that the radio depression originates from the\nabsorption of cold and dense materials within the erupting flux rope to the\nbackground emission. The absorption seems to be stronger than that at the Ha\nand EUV bands, thus leading to their apparent discrepancies. Moreover, the\nradio depression is also found to occupy the lower part but not the whole body\nof the flux rope.",

    "abstract": "Textual adversarial examples pose serious threats to the reliability of\nnatural language processing systems. Recent studies suggest that adversarial\nexamples tend to deviate from the underlying manifold of normal texts, whereas\npre-trained masked language models can approximate the manifold of normal data.\nThese findings inspire the exploration of masked language models for detecting\ntextual adversarial attacks. We first introduce Masked Language Model-based\nDetection (MLMD), leveraging the mask and unmask operations of the masked\nlanguage modeling (MLM) objective to induce the difference in manifold changes\nbetween normal and adversarial texts. Although MLMD achieves competitive\ndetection performance, its exhaustive one-by-one masking strategy introduces\nsignificant computational overhead. Our posterior analysis reveals that a\nsignificant number of non-keywords in the input are not important for detection\nbut consume resources. Building on this, we introduce Gradient-guided MLMD\n(GradMLMD), which leverages gradient information to identify and skip\nnon-keywords during detection, significantly reducing resource consumption\nwithout compromising detection performance.",

    "abstract": "Many aspects of our societies now depend upon satellite telecommunications,\nsuch as those requiring Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). GNSS is\nbased on radio waves that propagate through the ionosphere and experience\ncomplicated propagation effects caused by inhomogeneities in its electron\ndensity. The Earth's ionosphere forms part of the solar-terrestrial\nenvironment, and its state is determined by the spatial distribution and\ntemporal evolution of its electron density. It varies in response to the \"space\nweather\" combination of solar activity and geomagnetic conditions. Notably, the\nradio waves used in satellite telecommunications suffer due to the dispersive\nnature of the ionospheric plasma.\n  Scales and indices that summarise the state of the solar-terrestrial\nenvironment due to solar activity and geomagnetic conditions already exist.\nHowever, the response of the ionosphere to active geomagnetic conditions, its\ngeoeffectiveness, and its likely impact on systems and services are not\nencapsulated by these. This is due to the ionosphere's intrinsic day-to-day\nvariability, persistent seasonal patterns, and because radio wave measurements\nof the ionosphere depend upon many factors.\n  Here we develop a novel index that describes the state of the ionosphere\nduring specific space weather conditions.

    "abstract": "Enhancing energy efficiency in residential buildings is a crucial step toward\nmitigating climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Retrofitting\nexisting buildings, which account for a significant portion of energy\nconsumption, is critical particularly in regions with outdated and inefficient\nbuilding stocks. This study presents an Artificial Intelligence (AI) and\nMachine Learning (ML)-based framework to recommend energy efficiency measures\nfor residential buildings, leveraging accessible building characteristics to\nachieve energy class targets. Using Latvia as a case study, the methodology\naddresses challenges associated with limited datasets, class imbalance and data\nscarcity. The proposed approach integrates Conditional Tabular Generative\nAdversarial Networks (CTGAN) to generate synthetic data, enriching and\nbalancing the dataset. A Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model serves as the\npredictive model performing multi-label classification to predict appropriate\nretrofit strategies. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), specifically\nSHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), ensures transparency and trust by\nidentifying key features that influence recommendations and guiding feature\nengineering choices for improved reliability and performance. The evaluation of\nthe approach shows that it notably overcomes data limitations, achieving\nimprovements up to 54% in precision, recall and F1 score. Although this study\nfocuses on Latvia, the methodology is adaptable to other regions, underscoring\nthe potential of AI in reducing the complexity and cost of building energy\nretrofitting overcoming data limitations.

The method constructs a\nreduced-order model (ROM) of the solution residual using intermediate solutions\nand periodically solves a least-square problem in the low-dimensional ROM\nsubspace. The second-order approximation of the residual and the use of normal\nequation distinguish this work from similar approaches in the literature from\nthe methodology perspective. From the application perspective, in contrast to\nprior studies that focus on linear systems or idealized problems, we rigorously\nassess the method's performance on realistic computational fluid dynamics (CFD)\napplications. In addition to reducing the time complexity of point-iterative\nsolvers for linear systems, we demonstrate substantial reductions in the number\nof pseudo-time steps required for implicit schemes solving the nonlinear\nNavier-Stokes equations. Across a range of two- and three-dimensional\nflows-including subsonic inviscid and transonic turbulent cases-the method\nconsistently achieves a 3 to 4 times speedup in wall-clock time. Lastly, the\nproposed method acts as a robust stabilizer, capable of converging to steady\nsolutions in flows that would otherwise exhibit persistent unsteadiness-such as\nvortex shedding or transonic buffet-without relying on symmetry boundary\nconditions.",

In this paper, the objective is\nto show that hybrid systems methods can aid in filling this gap. We do this by\nformally analyzing rhythmic neuromorphic control of a pendulum system, which\nwas recently proposed as a prototypical setup. The neuromorphic controller\ngenerates spikes, which we model as a Dirac delta pulse, whenever the pendulum\nangular position crosses its resting position, with the goal of inducing a\nstable limit cycle. This leads to modeling the closed-loop system as a hybrid\ndynamical system, which in between spikes evolves in open loop and where the\njumps correspond to the spiking control actions. Exploiting the hybrid system\nmodel, we formally prove the existence, uniqueness, and a stability property of\nthe hybrid limit cycle for the closed-loop system. Numerical simulations\nillustrate our approach.

In particular, a main goal has been to understand\nwhich lower bounds suffice to obtain efficient PIT algorithms, and how close\nare they to lower bounds that are necessary for the conclusion.\n  We construct polynomial-time PIT algorithms from lower bounds that are, up to\nrelatively minor remaining gaps, necessary for the existence of such\nalgorithms. That is, we prove that these lower bounds are, up to the mentioned\nminor gaps, both sufficient and necessary for polynomial-time PIT, over fields\nof characteristic zero. Over sufficiently large finite fields, we show a\nsimilar result wherein the PIT algorithm runs in time $n^{\\log^{(c)}(n)}$, i.e.\na power of $c$-iterated log for an arbitrarily large constant $c>1$.\n  The key to these improvements is studying PIT versus lower bounds in the\nuniform setting, in which we focus on proving lower bounds for uniform\narithmetic circuits and their variants (and on deducing algorithms from such\nlower bounds). Indeed, by working in this setting we obtain results that are\nsignificantly tighter than previously known results concerning polynomial-time\nPIT vs lower bounds, and are in fact also tighter than known\nhardness-vs-randomness connections in the Boolean setting.\n  Our results are obtained by combining recent techniques from Boolean hardness\nvs randomness, and in particular the generator of Chen and Tell (FOCS 2021),\nwith the algebraic hitting-set generator of Guo, Kumar, Saptharishi, and\nSolomon (SIAM J.

    "abstract": "Planar Hall magnetoresistive sensors (PHMR) are promising candidates for\nvarious magnetic sensing applications due to their high sensitivity, low power\nconsumption, and compatibility with integrated circuit technology. However,\ntheir performance is often limited by inherent noise sources, impacting their\nresolution and overall sensitivity. Here the effect of three bilayer structures\nNiFe(10 nm)/IrMn(10 nm), NiFe(30 nm)/IrMn(10 nm), and NiFe(30 nm)/IrMn(20 nm)\non noise levels is investigated at low-frequency (DC - 25 Hz). This study\nincludes a detailed investigation on the optimization process and noise\ncharacteristics of multiring PHMR sensors, focusing on identifying and\nquantifying the dominant noise sources. The experimental measurements are\ncomplemented by a theoretical analysis of noise sources including thermal\nnoise, 1/f noise, intermixing and environmental noise. The best magnetic\nresolution is observed for the NiFe(30 nm)/IrMn(10 nm) structure, which\nachieves a detectivity below 1.5 nT/sqrt(Hz) at 10 Hz in a non-shielded\nenvironment at room temperature. In addition, a substantial improvement in\nsensitivity is observed by annealing the sensors at 250 deg C for 1 hour. The\nfindings of this study contribute to a deeper understanding of noise behavior\nin PHMR sensors, paving the way for developing strategies to improve their\nperformance for demanding sensing applications at low frequencies.",

    "abstract": "Capsule endoscopy is a method to capture images of the gastrointestinal tract\nand screen for diseases which might remain hidden if investigated with standard\nendoscopes. Due to the limited size of a video capsule, embedding AI models\ndirectly into the capsule demands careful consideration of the model size and\nthus complicates anomaly detection in this field. Furthermore, the scarcity of\navailable data in this domain poses an ongoing challenge to achieving effective\nanomaly detection. Thus, this work introduces an ensemble strategy to address\nthis challenge in anomaly detection tasks in video capsule endoscopies,\nrequiring only a small number of individual neural networks during both the\ntraining and inference phases. Ensemble learning combines the predictions of\nmultiple independently trained neural networks. This has shown to be highly\neffective in enhancing both the accuracy and robustness of machine learning\nmodels. However, this comes at the cost of higher memory usage and increased\ncomputational effort, which quickly becomes prohibitive in many real-world\napplications. Instead of applying the same training algorithm to each\nindividual network, we propose using various loss functions, drawn from the\nanomaly detection field, to train each network. The methods are validated on\nthe two largest publicly available datasets for video capsule endoscopy images,\nthe Galar and the Kvasir-Capsule dataset. We achieve an AUC score of 76.86% on\nthe Kvasir-Capsule and an AUC score of 76.98% on the Galar dataset. Our\napproach outperforms current baselines with significantly fewer parameters\nacross all models, which is a crucial step towards incorporating artificial\nintelligence into capsule endoscopies.",

    "abstract": "In active sensing systems, waveforms with ambiguity functions (AFs) of low\npeak sidelobe levels (PSLs) across a time delay and Doppler frequency shift\nplane (delay-Doppler plane) of interest are desirable for reducing false\nalarms. Additionally, unimodular waveforms are preferred due to hardware\nlimitations. In this paper, a new method is proposed to design unimodular\nwaveforms with PSL suppression over a continuous Doppler frequency shift\nregion, based on the discrete-time ambiguity function (DTAF). Compared with\nexisting methods that suppress PSL over grid points in the delay-Doppler plane\nby using the discrete ambiguity function (DAF), we regard the DTAF optimization\nproblem as of more practical interest because the Doppler frequency shifts\nobserved in echo signals reflected from targets are inherently continuous\nrather than discrete. The problem of interest is formulated as an optimization\nproblem with infinite constraints along with unimodular constraints. To the\nbest of the authors' knowledge, such a problem has not been studied yet. We\npropose to reformulate a non-convex semi-infinite programming (SIP) to a\nsemidefinite programming (SDP) with a finite number of constraints and a\nrank-one constraint, which is then solved by the sequential rank-one constraint\nrelaxation (SROCR) algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed\nmethod outperforms existing methods in achieving a lower PSL of AF over a\ncontinuous Doppler frequency shift region of interest. Moreover, the designed\nwaveform can effectively prevent false alarms when detecting a target with an\narbitrary velocity.",

In this paper we investigate effects of non-locality on the\nthree-point function (the bi-spectrum) during cosmic inflation. The study is\ndone in an Einstein frame with an infinite-derivative scalar field Lagrangian\nminimally coupled to the Einstein-Hilbert term. A non-local generalization of\nthe Mukhanov-Sasaki equation is derived. Infinite-derivative operators present\nin this equation lead to an appearance of infinitely many new background\ninduced states in the perturbation spectrum during inflation with complex\nmasses on top of a usual nearly massless inflaton. On contrary to a flat\nbackground such states can be classically stable in a de Sitter space-time.\nThis helps preserving observational constraints on the scalar power-spectrum.\nWe proceed by studying a particular configuration assuming that the generalized\nMukhanov-Sasaki equation gives rise to an inflaton and one pair of new states\nwith complex conjugate masses as perturbative degrees of freedom. The\ncorresponding scalar bi-spectrum is computed numerically in squeezed and\nequilateral limits. We use the latest observational constraints on amplitude of\nthe bi-spectrum $f_{NL}$ from Planck 2018 dataset as a guideline for possible\nvalues of masses of new emerging states. We find that $f_{NL}$ is non-trivially\nsensitive to the values of complex masses and this can reduce the parameter\nspace of gravity modifications. In particular we find that the amplitude of the\nsqueezed limit gets easily enhanced while of the equilateral limit can stay\nlike in a local single-field model of inflation.

Firstly, we propose a\nnovel one-step unaligned target-guided conditional denoising diffusion\nprobabilistic models(UTGOS-CDDPM)to translate multimodal images into a unified\ndomain. In the inference stage, traditional conditional DDPM generate\ntranslated source image by a large number of iterations, which severely slows\ndown the image registration task. To address this issues, we use the unaligned\ntraget image as a condition to promote the generation of low-frequency features\nof the translated source image. Furthermore, during the training stage, we add\nthe inverse process of directly predicting the translated image to ensure that\nthe translated source image can be generated in one step during the testing\nstage. Additionally, to supervised the detail features of translated source\nimage, we propose a new perceptual loss that focuses on the high-frequency\nfeature differences between the translated and ground-truth images. Finally, a\nmultimodal multiscale image registration network (MM-Reg) fuse the multimodal\nfeature of the unimodal images and multimodal images by proposed multimodal\nfeature fusion strategy.

    "abstract": "A triality is a sort of super-symmetry that exchanges the types of the\nelements of an incidence geometry in cycles of length three. Although\ngeometries with trialities exhibit fascinating behaviors, their construction is\nchallenging, making them rare in the literature. To understand trialities more\ndeeply, it is crucial to have a wide variety of examples at hand. In this\narticle, we introduce a general method for constructing various rank-three\nincidence systems with trialities. Specifically, for any rank two incidence\nsystem $\\Gamma$, we define its triangle complex $\\Delta(\\Gamma)$, a rank three\nincidence system whose elements consist of three copies of the flags (pairs of\nincident elements) of $\\Gamma$. This triangle complex always admits a triality\nthat cyclically permutes the three copies. We then explore in detail the\nproperties of the triangle complex when $\\Gamma$ is a linear space, including\nflag-transitivity, the existence of dualities, and connectivity properties. As\na consequence of our work, this construction yields the first infinite family\nof thick, flag-transitive and residually connected geometries with trialities\nbut no dualities.",

However, existing reward models lack this ability, as they are typically\ntrained by increasing the reward gap between chosen and rejected responses,\nwhile overlooking the prompts that the responses are conditioned on.\nConsequently, when the trained reward model is evaluated on prompt-response\npairs that lie outside the data distribution, neglecting the effect of prompts\nmay result in poor generalization of the reward model. To address this issue,\nwe decompose the reward value into two independent components: prompt-free\nreward and prompt-related reward. Prompt-free reward represents the evaluation\nthat is determined only by responses, while the prompt-related reward reflects\nthe reward that derives from both the prompt and the response. We extract these\ntwo components from an information-theoretic perspective, which requires no\nextra models. Subsequently, we propose a new reward learning algorithm by\nprioritizing data samples based on their prompt-free reward values. Through toy\nexamples, we demonstrate that the extracted prompt-free and prompt-related\nrewards effectively characterize two parts of the reward model. Further,\nstandard evaluations show that our method improves both the alignment\nperformance and the generalization capability of the reward model.",

A system dynamics technology interaction\nframework is built and simulated based on Technological Innovation System and\nLotka-Volterra to investigate the inter-technology relationship impacts and\nmodes that hybrid technologies establish with incumbent and emerging\ntechnologies. This is conducted for the case of conventional, hybrid and\nbattery electric vehicles under various scenarios . Results reveal that, by\nacting as an exploration-hybrid solution, hybrid technologies maintain a\ntransitionary role by supporting mainly the technological development side of\nemerging technology. On the contrary, by acting as an exploitation-hybrid\nsolution, they hardly (or never) sustain an inhibitive role against both the\ntechnological and market development sides of incumbent technology. While\nhybrid technologies may play a stationary role on the market development side\nin transitions processes, simulation results show that maintaining all\ninter-technology relationship modes as business-as-usual (i.e., baseline\nscenario) but instead simultaneously strengthening the various socio-technical\ndimensions of emerging technology and destabilising the various socio-technical\ndimensions of incumbent technology (i.e., sociotechnical scenario) is a more\npromising pathway in both short term (e.g., an accelerated uptake of emerging\ntechnology and decline of incumbent technology) and long term (e.g., highest\nemission reduction).

This paper\noffers a unifying perspective by casting QML as a specialized yet more\nexpressive branch of GML. We argue that quantum states, whether pure or mixed,\nreside on curved manifolds (e.g., projective Hilbert spaces or density-operator\nmanifolds), mirroring how covariance matrices inhabit the manifold of symmetric\npositive definite (SPD) matrices or how image sets occupy Grassmann manifolds.\nHowever, QML also benefits from purely quantum properties, such as\nentanglement-induced curvature, that can yield richer kernel structures and\nmore nuanced data embeddings.\n  We illustrate these ideas with published and newly discussed results,\nincluding hybrid classical -quantum pipelines for diabetic foot ulcer\nclassification and structural health monitoring. Despite near-term hardware\nlimitations that constrain purely quantum solutions, hybrid architectures\nalready demonstrate tangible benefits by combining classical manifold-based\nfeature extraction with quantum embeddings.

    "abstract": "Developing high-quality large language models (LLMs) for moderately resourced\nlanguages presents unique challenges in data availability, model adaptation,\nand evaluation. We introduce Llama-3-Nanda-10B-Chat, or Nanda for short, a\nstate-of-the-art Hindi-centric instruction-tuned generative LLM, designed to\npush the boundaries of open-source Hindi language models. Built upon\nLlama-3-8B, Nanda incorporates continuous pre-training with expanded\ntransformer blocks, leveraging the Llama Pro methodology. A key challenge was\nthe limited availability of high-quality Hindi text data; we addressed this\nthrough rigorous data curation, augmentation, and strategic bilingual training,\nbalancing Hindi and English corpora to optimize cross-linguistic knowledge\ntransfer. With 10 billion parameters, Nanda stands among the top-performing\nopen-source Hindi and multilingual models of similar scale, demonstrating\nsignificant advantages over many existing models. We provide an in-depth\ndiscussion of training strategies, fine-tuning techniques, safety alignment,\nand evaluation metrics, demonstrating how these approaches enabled Nanda to\nachieve state-of-the-art results. By open-sourcing Nanda, we aim to advance\nresearch in Hindi LLMs and support a wide range of real-world applications\nacross academia, industry, and public services.",

    "abstract": "Multimodal misinformation, such as miscaptioned images, where captions\nmisrepresent an image's origin, context, or meaning, poses a growing challenge\nin the digital age. To support fact-checkers, researchers have focused on\ndeveloping datasets and methods for multimodal misinformation detection (MMD).\nDue to the scarcity of large-scale annotated MMD datasets, recent approaches\nrely on synthetic training data created via out-of-context pairings or named\nentity manipulations (e.g., altering names, dates, or locations). However,\nthese often yield simplistic examples that lack real-world complexity, limiting\nmodel robustness. Meanwhile, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) remain\nunderexplored for generating diverse and realistic synthetic data for MMD. To\naddress, we introduce \"Miscaption This!\", a collection of LVLM-generated\nmiscaptioned image datasets. Additionally, we introduce \"Latent Multimodal\nReconstruction\" (LAMAR), a network trained to reconstruct the embeddings of\ntruthful captions, providing a strong auxiliary signal to guide detection. We\nexplore various training strategies (end-to-end vs. large-scale pre-training)\nand integration mechanisms (direct, mask, gate, and attention). Extensive\nexperiments show that models trained on \"MisCaption This!\" generalize better to\nreal-world misinformation while LAMAR achieves new state-of-the-art on both\nNewsCLIPpings and VERITE benchmarks; highlighting the value of LVLM-generated\ndata and reconstruction-based networks for advancing MMD.

The server aggregates these models using the FedAvg method and\nsubsequently retrains the global classifier utilizing the shared features. The\nclassifier retraining process enhances the model's understanding of the\nholistic view of the data distribution, ensuring better generalization across\ndiverse datasets. This improved generalization enables the classifier to\nadaptively influence the feature extractor during subsequent local training\nepochs. We establish a balance between enhancing model accuracy and\nsafeguarding individual privacy through the implementation of differential\nprivacy mechanisms.

The lowest-energy band crosses\nthe Fermi level and we find strong site-dependent spectral variations\nespecially at the chain's terminations. We attribute these features to quantum\nspin effects and ferromagnetic coupling influenced by the local chemical\nenvironment, rather than topological superconductivity or Majorana modes.",

    "abstract": "In the last decade, the available measurements of fluorine abundance have\nincreased significantly, providing additional information on the chemical\nevolution of our Galaxy and details on complex stellar nucleosynthesis\nprocesses. However, the observational challenges to obtain stellar F abundances\nfavor samples with higher metallicities, resulting in a scarcity of\nmeasurements at low-metallicity ([Fe/H] $<-2.0$). We present F abundances and\nupper limits in 7 carbon enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars observed with the\nImmersion Grating Infrared Spectrometer (IGRINS), at the Gemini-South\ntelescope. These new observations delivered high-resolution, high\nsignal-to-noise ratio, infrared spectra allowing us to probe significantly\ndeeper into the metal-poor regime and the cosmic origin of F. This work\npresents the results of our observations, including two 2-sigma detections and\nfive upper limits in a variety of CEMP stars. Arguably the most important\nresult is for CS 29498-0043, a CEMP-no star at [Fe/H] = $-3.87$ with a F\ndetection of [F/Fe] = $+2.0\\pm 0.4$, the lowest metallicity star (more than a\nfactor of 10 lower in metallicity than the next detection) with observed F\nabundance to date. This measurement allowed us to differentiate between two\nzero metallicity Population III (Pop III) progenitors: one involving He-burning\nwith primary N in Wolf-Rayet stars, and the other suggesting H-burning during\nhypernova explosions. Our measured value is in better agreement with the latter\nscenario. This detection represents a pilot, and pioneering study demonstrating\nthe power of F to explore the nature and properties of the first chemical\nenrichment from Pop III stars.",

In this framework, the challenging\nproblem of testing the quantum nature of gravity is mapped to the easier task\nof determining the non-classicality of the gravitationally-induced optical\nchannel: If the optical channel is not entanglement-breaking, then gravity must\nhave a quantum nature. This approach is applicable without making any\nassumption on the, currently unknown, correct model of gravity in the quantum\nregime. In the second part of this work, we model gravity as a quadratic\nHamiltonian interaction (e.g. a weak Newtonian force), resulting in a Gaussian\nthermal attenuator channel between the two systems.

In fact, the odds ratio is >10:1\nfor all possible values of the biosphere's ultimate lifespan and speculative\nhypotheses of ancient civilizations.

    "abstract": "The unmanned aerial manipulator system, consisting of a multirotor UAV\n(unmanned aerial vehicle) and a manipulator, has attracted considerable\ninterest from researchers. Nevertheless, the operation of a dual-arm\nmanipulator poses a dynamic challenge, as the CoM (center of mass) of the\nsystem changes with manipulator movement, potentially impacting the multirotor\nUAV. Additionally, unmodeled effects, parameter uncertainties, and external\ndisturbances can significantly degrade control performance, leading to\nunforeseen dangers. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes a nonlinear\nadaptive RISE (robust integral of the sign of the error) controller based on\nDNN (deep neural network). The first step involves establishing the kinematic\nand dynamic model of the dual-arm aerial manipulator. Subsequently, the\nadaptive RISE controller is proposed with a DNN feedforward term to effectively\naddress both internal and external challenges. By employing Lyapunov\ntechniques, the asymptotic convergence of the tracking error signals are\nguaranteed rigorously. Notably, this paper marks a pioneering effort by\npresenting the first DNN-based adaptive RISE controller design accompanied by a\ncomprehensive stability analysis. To validate the practicality and robustness\nof the proposed control approach, several groups of actual hardware experiments\nare conducted. The results confirm the efficacy of the developed methodology in\nhandling real-world scenarios, thereby offering valuable insights into the\nperformance of the dual-arm aerial manipulator system.",

Recent\nadvances, especially the GPT-4o, have demonstrated the feasibility of\nhigh-fidelity multimodal generation, their architectural design remains\nmysterious and unpublished. This prompts the question of whether image and text\ngeneration have already been successfully integrated into a unified framework\nfor those methods. In this work, we conduct an empirical study of GPT-4o's\nimage generation capabilities, benchmarking it against leading open-source and\ncommercial models. Our evaluation covers four main categories, including\ntext-to-image, image-to-image, image-to-3D, and image-to-X generation, with\nmore than 20 tasks.

The loss function comprises the squared residuals of the governing\nequations, computed via automatic differentiation, along with sparse\nobservations and partially known boundary conditions. We construct shared KANs\nusing Jacobi polynomials and investigate their performance by considering\nJacobi polynomials of different degrees and types in terms of both\ncomputational cost and prediction accuracy. As a benchmark test case, we\nconsider natural convection in a square enclosure with a cylinder, where the\ncylinder's shape varies across a dataset of 135 geometries.

Among various guidance strategies presented in literature,\nlook-ahead distance ($L_1$)-based guidance method has received significant\nattention due to its ease in implementation and ability to maintain a low\ncross-track error while following simpler reference paths and generate bounded\nlateral acceleration commands. However, the constant value of $L_1$ becomes\nproblematic when the UxV is far away from the reference path and also produce\nhigher cross-track error while following complex reference paths having high\nvariation in radius of curvature. To address these challenges, the notion of\nlook-ahead distance is leveraged in a novel way to develop a two-phase guidance\nstrategy. Initially, when the UxV is far from the reference path, an optimized\n$L_1$ selection strategy is developed to guide the UxV toward the reference\npath in order to maintain minimal lateral acceleration command. Once the\nvehicle reaches a close vicinity of the reference path, a novel notion of\ncorrector point is incorporated in the constant $L_1$-based guidance scheme to\ngenerate the lateral acceleration command that effectively reduces the root\nmean square of the cross-track error thereafter. Simulation results demonstrate\nthat this proposed corrector point and look-ahead point pair-based guidance\nstrategy along with the developed midcourse guidance scheme outperforms the\nconventional constant $L_1$ guidance scheme both in terms of feasibility and\nmeasures of effectiveness like cross-track error and lateral acceleration\nrequirements.",

However, it is\nhighly challenging due to individual variability and large 3D search space.\nExisting work needs labor-intensive and time-consuming manual annotations to\ntrain view-specific models, which are limited to predicting only a fixed set of\nplanes. However, in real clinical scenarios, the challenge of positioning\nsemantic 2D slices with any orientation into varying coordinate space in\narbitrary 3D volume remains unsolved. We thus introduce a novel framework,\nAVP-AP, the first to use Atlas Prompting for self-supervised Automatic View\nPositioning in the 3D CT volume. Specifically, this paper first proposes an\natlas prompting method, which generates a 3D canonical atlas and trains a\nnetwork to map slices into their corresponding positions in the atlas space via\na self-supervised manner. Then, guided by atlas prompts corresponding to the\ngiven query images in a reference CT, we identify the coarse positions of\nslices in the target CT volume using rigid transformation between the 3D atlas\nand target CT volume, effectively reducing the search space. Finally, we refine\nthe coarse positions by maximizing the similarity between the predicted slices\nand the query images in the feature space of a given foundation model. Our\nframework is flexible and efficient compared to other methods, outperforming\nother methods by 19.8% average structural similarity (SSIM) in arbitrary view\npositioning and achieving 9% SSIM in two-chamber view compared to four\nradiologists.

The verification\nproblem for pMCs asks whether each MC in the corresponding family satisfies a\ngiven temporal specification. The state-of-the-art approach for this problem is\nparameter lifting (PL) -- an abstraction-refinement loop that abstracts the pMC\nto a non-parametric model analyzed with standard probabilistic model checking\ntechniques. This paper presents two key improvements to tackle the main\nlimitations of PL. First, we introduce generalized parameter lifting (GPL) to\nlift various restrictive assumptions made by PL.

While the frame- and\ntuple-level alignment approaches have been promising, their methods heavily\nrely on pre-defined and length-dependent alignment units (e.g., frames or\ntuples), which limits flexibility for actions of varying lengths and speeds. In\nthis work, we introduce a novel TEmporal Alignment-free Matching (TEAM)\napproach, which eliminates the need for temporal units in action representation\nand brute-force alignment during matching. Specifically, TEAM represents each\nvideo with a fixed set of pattern tokens that capture globally discriminative\nclues within the video instance regardless of action length or speed, ensuring\nits flexibility. Furthermore, TEAM is inherently efficient, using token-wise\ncomparisons to measure similarity between videos, unlike existing methods that\nrely on pairwise comparisons for temporal alignment. Additionally, we propose\nan adaptation process that identifies and removes common information across\nclasses, establishing clear boundaries even between novel categories.

One extensively studied example is the\nferromagnetic (FM) CrI$_3$ monolayer with the honeycomb Cr$^{3+}$ ($t_{2g}^3$,\n$S$ = 3/2) spin lattice, while VPS$_3$ has a same honeycomb $S$ = 3/2 spin\nlattice (V$^{2+}$, $t_{2g}^3$) but displays N$\\acute{e}$el antiferromagnetism\n(AFM). In this work, we study the electronic structure and particularly the\ncontrasting magnetism of VPS$_3$ and CrI$_3$ monolayers. We find that VPS$_3$\nis a Mott-Hubbard insulator but CrI$_3$ is a charge-transfer insulator, and\ntherefore their magnetic exchange mechanisms are essentially different. The\nfirst nearest-neighbor (1NN) direct $d$-$d$ exchange dominates in VPS$_3$, thus\nleading to a strong antiferromagnetic (AF) coupling. However, the formation of\nvanadium vacancies, associated with instability of the low-valence V$^{2+}$\nions, suppresses the AF coupling and thus strongly reduces the N$\\acute{e}$el\ntemperature ($T_{\\text{N}}$) in line with the experimental observation. In\ncontrast, our results reveal that the major 1NN $d$-$p$-$d$ superexchanges in\nCrI$_3$ via different channels give rise to competing FM and AF couplings,\nultimately resulting in a weak FM coupling as observed experimentally. After\nrevisiting several important superexchange channels reported in the literature,\nbased on our MLWFs and tight-binding analyses, we note that some antiphase\ncontributions must be subtly and simultaneously considered, and thus we provide\na deeper insight into the FM coupling of CrI$_3$. Moreover, we identify and\ncompare the major contributions to the magnetic anisotropy, i.e., a weak shape\nanisotropy in VPS$_3$ and a relatively strong exchange anisotropy in CrI$_3$.",

Unlike previous approaches relying on the\nlight-cone gauge or symmetry-based constructions, our model retains full\n11-dimensional Lorentz invariance by introducing a novel gauge-fixing condition\nthat restricts the symmetry of volume-preserving deformations (VPD) to a\nsubclass, which we call restricted VPD (RVPD). This restriction enables a\nconsistent matrix regularization of the Nambu bracket, bypassing the\nlong-standing obstructions related to the Leibniz rule and the Fundamental\nIdentity. The resulting model exhibits RVPD symmetry, admits particle-like and\nnoncommutative membrane solutions, and lays the foundation for a\nLorentz-invariant, nonperturbative matrix description of M2-branes. Our work\noffers a new paradigm for constructing Lorentz-invariant matrix models of\nmembranes, revisiting the algebraic structure underlying M-theory.",

The proposed control\nframework employs two kinds of CBFs to impose safety constraints on the UAVs'\nmotion. The first class of CBFs (LCBF) is a three-dimensional exponentially\ndecaying function centered above the landing platform, designed to safely and\nprecisely land UAVs on the UGVs. The second set is a spherical CBF (SCBF),\ndefined between every pair of UAVs, which avoids collisions between them. The\nLCBF is time-varying and adapts to the motions of the UGVs. In the proposed CBF\napproach, the control input from the UAV's nominal tracking controller designed\nto reach the landing platform is filtered to choose a minimally-deviating\ncontrol input that ensures safety (as defined by the CBFs). As the control\ninputs of every UAV are shared in establishing multiple CBF constraints, we\nprove that the control inputs are shared without conflict in rendering the safe\nsets forward invariant. The performance of the control framework is validated\nthrough a simulated scenario involving three UAVs landing on three moving\ntargets.",

This assumption may not hold in certain technical and environmental\napplications, especially in systems with large temperature gradients, large\ndifferences in thermal properties, or high velocities. Local Thermal\nNon-Equilibrium (LTNE) models aim to describe heat transfer processes when the\nLTE assumption may fail. In this work, we compare three continuum-scale models\nfrom the pore to the representative elementary volume (REV) scale.\nSpecifically, dual-network and REV-scale models are evaluated against a\npore-resolved model, which we perceive as a reference in the absence of\nexperimental results. Different effective models are used to obtain upscaled\nproperties on the REV scale and to compare resulting temperature profiles. The\nsystems investigated are fully saturated, consisting of one fluid and one solid\nphase. This study focuses on purely conductive systems without significant\ndifferences in thermal properties. Results show that LTE holds then for low\ninterfacial resistances. However, for large interfacial resistances, solid and\nfluid temperatures differ. The REV-scale model with effective parameters\nobtained by homogenization leads to similar results as the pore-resolved model,\nwhereas the dual-network model shows greater deviation due to its fixed spatial\nresolution. Among the evaluated effective parameter formulations for the\nREV-scale model, only the homogenization-based approach captures the LTNE\nbehavior, as it incorporates the interfacial heat transfer coefficient.\nConvection is relevant for most practical applications, and its impact will be\naddressed in a follow-up article.",

Motivated by the ever-increasing rate of generating such\ndata, as well as by their importance in several domains, we introduce Useful\nString Indexing (USI), a natural generalization of the classic String Indexing\nproblem. Given a string $S$ (the text) of length $n$, USI asks for\npreprocessing $S$ into a compact data structure supporting the following\nqueries efficiently: given a shorter string $P$ (the pattern), return the\nglobal utility $U(P)$ of $P$ in $S$, where $U$ is a function that maps any\nstring $P$ to a utility score based on the utilities of the letters of every\noccurrence of $P$ in $S$. Our work also makes the following contributions: (1)\nWe propose a novel and efficient data structure for USI based on finding the\ntop-$K$ frequent substrings of $S$. (2) We propose a linear-space data\nstructure that can be used to mine the top-$K$ frequent substrings of $S$ or to\ntune the parameters of the USI data structure. (3) We propose a novel\nspace-efficient algorithm for estimating the set of the top-$K$ frequent\nsubstrings of $S$, thus improving the construction space of the data structure\nfor USI.

One of the key assumptions of the model is that the `atom' is a\nperfect two-level system. We explore what happens when one generalizes the atom\nto a multilevel system, with $m$ ground and $n$ excited states coupled to the\nsame field. We focus on the case where the excited and ground states form\ndistinct, well-separated, manifolds of near-degenerate levels (so that the\nspacing between the excited states on a given manifold is much less than the\naverage spacing between the manifolds) and consider either uniform or random\ncouplings between the individual ground and excited levels. We find that the\nsystem reduces approximately to a direct sum of Rabi models with a range of\ndifferent couplings. Importantly, the strongest coupling is enhanced in a way\nthat depends on the number of levels, for the simple case where $n=m$, the\ncoupling scales with $n$ for uniform couplings and $2\\sqrt{n}$ for random\ncouplings (in the limit of large $n$).

HCEs offer several\nkey advantages, including increased statistical power, mitigation of competing\nrisks, and hierarchical ranking of clinical outcomes. While, as summary\nmeasures, the win ratio (WR) along with the Net Benefit (NB) and the Win Odds\n(WO) provide a structured approach to analyzing HCEs, several concerns\nregarding their interpretability remain. In this paper, we present known issues\nwith the WR using simple examples designed to explore the implications for the\nclinical interpretability of the treatment effect measure in the chronic kidney\ndisease setting. Specifically, we discuss the challenge of defining an\nappropriate estimand in the context of HCEs using the WR, the difficulties in\nformulating a relevant causal question underlying the WR, and the dependency of\nthe WR on the variance of its components, which complicates its role as an\neffect measure. Additionally, we highlight the non-collapsibility and\nnon-transitivity of the WR, further complicating its interpretation. While the\nWR remains a valuable tool in clinical trials, its inherent limitations must be\nacknowledged to ensure its proper use in regulatory and clinical\ndecision-making.",

However, these methods fail to properly balance the motion-appearance\nrelationship. Consequently, even with complex fusion modules for\nmotion-appearance integration, the extracted suboptimal features degrade the\nmodels' overall performance. Moreover, the quality of optical flow varies\nacross scenarios, making it insufficient to rely solely on optical flow to\nachieve high-quality segmentation results. To address these challenges, we\npropose the Saliency-Motion guided Trunk-Collateral Network (SMTC-Net), which\nbetter balances the motion-appearance relationship and incorporates model's\nintrinsic saliency information to enhance segmentation performance.\nSpecifically, considering that optical flow maps are derived from RGB images,\nthey share both commonalities and differences. Accordingly, we propose a novel\nTrunk-Collateral structure for motion-appearance UVOS. The shared trunk\nbackbone captures the motion-appearance commonality, while the collateral\nbranch learns the uniqueness of motion features. Furthermore, an Intrinsic\nSaliency guided Refinement Module (ISRM) is devised to efficiently leverage the\nmodel's intrinsic saliency information to refine high-level features, and\nprovide pixel-level guidance for motion-appearance fusion, thereby enhancing\nperformance without additional input.

The Standard Model\nLagrangian (without gravity) is strictly renormalizable from a perturbative\npoint of view. On the other hand, the inclusion of gravity seems not to respect\nthis criterion, since general relativity is perturbatively non-renormalizable.\nThe aim of this work is to provide concrete evidence that strict\nrenormalizability is still a valid criterion even when applied to gravity.\nFirst, we show that adding quadratic curvature terms to the Einstein-Hilbert\naction gives rise to a strictly renormalizable theory known as quadratic\ngravity. Second, we argue that this unique theory represents the most\nconservative approach to quantum gravity and, at the same time, is highly\npredictive, as it can explain new physics beyond general relativity already in\nthe sub-Planckian regime. In particular, it provides one of the best fits to\nthe CMB anisotropies via Starobinsky inflation and makes sharp cosmological\npredictions that can be tested in the near future.

Hybrid CPU-GPU\ninference has been proposed to leverage CPU computation to reduce expert\nloading overhead but faces major challenges: on one hand, the expert activation\npatterns of MoE models are highly unstable, rendering the fixed mapping\nstrategies in existing works inefficient; on the other hand, the hybrid CPU-GPU\nschedule for MoE is inherently complex due to the diverse expert sizes,\nstructures, uneven workload distribution, etc. To address these challenges, in\nthis paper, we propose HybriMoE, a hybrid CPU-GPU inference framework that\nimproves resource utilization through a novel CPU-GPU scheduling and cache\nmanagement system.

    "abstract": "Effective demand forecasting is critical for inventory management, production\nplanning, and decision making across industries. Selecting the appropriate\nmodel and suitable features to efficiently capture patterns in the data is one\nof the main challenges in demand forecasting. In reality, this becomes even\nmore complicated when the recorded sales have zeroes, which can happen\nnaturally or due to some anomalies, such as stockouts and recording errors.\nMistreating the zeroes can lead to the application of inappropriate forecasting\nmethods, and thus leading to poor decision making. Furthermore, the demand\nitself can have different fundamental characteristics, and being able to\ndistinguish one type from another might bring substantial benefits in terms of\naccuracy and thus decision making. We propose a two-stage model-based\nclassification framework that in the first step, identifies artificially\noccurring zeroes, and then classifies demand to one of the possible types:\nregular/intermittent, intermittent smooth/lumpy, fractional/count. The\nframework utilises statistical modelling and information criteria to detect\nanomalous zeroes and then classify demand into those categories. We then argue\nthat different types of demand need different features, and show empirically\nthat they tend to increase the accuracy of the forecasting methods compared to\nthose applied directly to the dataset without the generated features and the\ntwo-stage framework. Our general practical recommendation based on that is to\nuse the mixture approach for intermittent demand, capturing the demand sizes\nand demand probability separately, as it seems to improve the accuracy of\ndifferent forecasting approaches.",

    "abstract": "We designed customized Lyman-break color selection techniques to identify\ngalaxy candidates in the redshift ranges $15 \\leq z \\leq 20$ and $20 \\leq z\n\\leq 28$. The selection was performed on the ASTRODEEP-JWST multi-band catalogs\nof the CEERS, Abell-2744, JADES, NGDEEP, and PRIMER survey fields, covering a\ntotal area of $\\sim0.2$ sq. deg. We identify nine candidates at $15 \\leq z \\leq\n20$, while no objects are found based on the $z\\gtrsim20$ color selection\ncriteria. Despite exhibiting a $>$1.5 mag break, all the objects display\nmultimodal redshift probability distributions across different SED-fitting\ncodes and methodologies. The alternative solutions correspond to poorly\nunderstood populations of low-mass quiescent or dusty galaxies at z$\\sim$3-7.\nThis conclusion is supported by the analysis of a NIRSpec spectrum recently\nacquired by the CAPERS program for one interloper object, which is confirmed to\nbe a dusty ($E(B-V)=0.8$ mag) starburst galaxy at $z=6.56$. We measured the UV\nluminosity function under different assumptions on the contamination level\nwithin our sample. We find that if even a fraction of the candidates is indeed\nat $z\\gtrsim15$, the resulting UV LF points to a very mild evolution compared\nto estimates at $z<15$, implying a significant tension with existing\ntheoretical models. In particular, confirming our bright ($M_{\\text{UV}}<-21$)\ncandidates would require substantial revisions to the theoretical framework. In\nturn, if all these candidates will be confirmed to be interlopers, we conclude\nthat future surveys may need ten times wider areas to select\n$M_{\\text{UV}}\\lesssim-20$ galaxies at $z>15$. Observations in the F150W and\nF200W filters at depths comparable to those in the NIRCam LW bands are also\nrequired to mitigate contamination from rare red objects at z$\\lesssim$8.",

This motivates\nthe representation of information defined in irregular domains as topological\nsignals. By leveraging the spectral dualities of Hodge and Dirac theory,\npractical topological signals often concentrate in specific spectral subspaces\n(e.g., gradient or curl). For instance, in a foreign currency exchange network,\nthe exchange flow signals typically satisfy the arbitrage-free condition and\nhence are curl-free. However, the presence of anomalies can disrupt these\nconditions, causing the signals to deviate from such subspaces. In this work,\nwe formulate a hypothesis testing framework to detect whether simplicial\ncomplex signals lie in specific subspaces in a principled and tractable manner.\nConcretely, we propose Neyman-Pearson matched topological subspace detectors\nfor signals defined at a single simplicial level (such as edges) or jointly\nacross all levels of a simplicial complex. The (energy-based projection)\nproposed detectors handle missing values, provide closed-form performance\nanalysis, and effectively capture the unique topological properties of the\ndata. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed topological detectors on\nvarious real-world data, including foreign currency exchange networks.",

The main aim is to\ncheck if the increase in band gap due to substitution of I$^-$ ions with Br$^-$\nions can be overcome by introducing the inorganic SbH$_4^+$ cation. Since the\nBr$^-$ ions merely enhance structural stability of the perovskite framework and\nSbH$_4^+$ not only sustains that stability but also reduces the band gap to\nnearly ideal values and thereby improves electronic performance, these are the\nleading candidates among them. Of them, the reduced band gap SbH$_4$PbI$_3$\n($\\sim$1.37 eV) and the perfectly matched SbH$_4$PbBrI$_2$ with its band gap\nbeing exactly 1.51 eV are top prospects for being stable and having\nhigh-efficiency solar cell applications.

    "abstract": "For the assessment of the financial soundness of a pension fund, it is\nnecessary to take into account mortality forecasting so that longevity risk is\nconsistently incorporated into future cash flows. In this article, we employ\nmachine learning models applied to actuarial science ({\\it actuarial learning})\nto make mortality predictions for a relevant sample of pension funds'\nparticipants. Actuarial learning represents an emerging field that involves the\napplication of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI)\ntechniques in actuarial science. This encompasses the use of algorithms and\ncomputational models to analyze large sets of actuarial data, such as\nregression trees, random forest, boosting, XGBoost, CatBoost, and neural\nnetworks (eg. FNN, LSTM, and MHA). Our results indicate that some ML/AI\nalgorithms present competitive out-of-sample performance when compared to the\nclassical Lee-Carter model. This may indicate interesting alternatives for\nconsistent liability evaluation and effective pension fund risk management.",

It is often\nassumed recently that these phenomena might be produced by some specific\nphysical mechanism, but no particular suggestions were put forward. It is the\naim of the present paper to show that a promising explanation of the stealth\nCMEs can be based on the so-called 'topological' ignition of the magnetic\nreconnection, when the magnetic null point is produced by a specific\nsuperposition of the remote sources (sunspots) rather than by the local current\nsystems. As follows from our numerical simulations, the topological model\nexplains very well all basic features of the stealth CMEs: (i) the plasma\neruption develops without an appreciable heat release from the spot of\nreconnection, i.e., without the solar flare; (ii) the spot of reconnection\n(magnetic null point) can be formed far away from the location of the magnetic\nfield sources; (iii) the trajectories of eruption are usually strongly curved,\nwhich can explain observability of CMEs generated behind the solar limb.",

Traditional large language model (LLM) watermarking techniques,\nwhich rely on token-level manipulations, are ill-suited for agents due to the\nchallenges of behavior tokenization and information loss during\nbehavior-to-action translation. To address these issues, we propose Agent\nGuide, a novel behavioral watermarking framework that embeds watermarks by\nguiding the agent's high-level decisions (behavior) through probability biases,\nwhile preserving the naturalness of specific executions (action). Our approach\ndecouples agent behavior into two levels, behavior (e.g., choosing to bookmark)\nand action (e.g., bookmarking with specific tags), and applies watermark-guided\nbiases to the behavior probability distribution. We employ a z-statistic-based\nstatistical analysis to detect the watermark, ensuring reliable extraction over\nmultiple rounds. Experiments in a social media scenario with diverse agent\nprofiles demonstrate that Agent Guide achieves effective watermark detection\nwith a low false positive rate. Our framework provides a practical and robust\nsolution for agent watermarking, with applications in identifying malicious\nagents and protecting proprietary agent systems.",

As\nthe temperature decreases below 5 K, $\\chi(T)$ approaches a constant,\nindicating van-Vleck paramagnetic behavior. The specific heat, $C(T)$, displays\na broad shoulder at around 4 K, which can be reproduced by a doublet triplet\ntwo-level model with an energy gap of 12 K. These results suggest a\nnon-magnetic $\\Gamma_3$ doublet ground state of the Pr$^{3+}$ ion in the cubic\ncrystalline electric field. $C(T)$ exhibits a peak at $T_{\\rm O}$ = 1.0 K and\nthis peak remains robust against magnetic fields up to 5 T.

Traditional linear techniques,\nsuch as principal component analysis, are widely used but often neglect the\nphysical response of the system and lack invertibility to the design space,\ni.e., the ability to reconstruct the original design parameters from a reduced\nrepresentation. This work introduces two physics-aware extensions of the\nparametric model embedding (PME) framework, aimed at generating reduced\nrepresentations that incorporate physical information while maintaining\nanalytical backmapping. The first, physics-informed PME (PI-PME), combines\ngeometric and physical variability; the second, physics-driven PME (PD-PME),\nrelies solely on physical responses. The proposed methods enable the\nconstruction of interpretable and physically relevant reduced spaces that can\nbe used for design-space exploration, surrogate modeling, and optimization. The\napproach is demonstrated on multiple engineering configurations, including\nairfoils, propellers, gliders, and hulls, showing its ability to capture\nperformance-relevant directions and preserve parametric consistency. The\nmethodology is offline and non-intrusive, compatible with low-fidelity\nsimulations, and requires only a modest number of samples to ensure variance\nconvergence.",

But how do these agents perform in complex high-stakes\ndomains, where domain expertise is essential and mistakes carry substantial\nrisk? This paper investigates the effectiveness of LLM-advisors in the finance\ndomain, focusing on three distinct challenges: (1) eliciting user preferences\nwhen users themselves may be unsure of their needs, (2) providing personalized\nguidance for diverse investment preferences, and (3) leveraging advisor\npersonality to build relationships and foster trust. Via a lab-based user study\nwith 64 participants, we show that LLM-advisors often match human advisor\nperformance when eliciting preferences, although they can struggle to resolve\nconflicting user needs. When providing personalized advice, the LLM was able to\npositively influence user behavior, but demonstrated clear failure modes. Our\nresults show that accurate preference elicitation is key, otherwise, the\nLLM-advisor has little impact, or can even direct the investor toward\nunsuitable assets. More worryingly, users appear insensitive to the quality of\nadvice being given, or worse these can have an inverse relationship. Indeed,\nusers reported a preference for and increased satisfaction as well as emotional\ntrust with LLMs adopting an extroverted persona, even though those agents\nprovided worse advice.",

The fitting performed using the impedance and constant-phase\nelement (CPE) confirm the non-Debye type relaxation.

    "abstract": "Generative models have demonstrated remarkable success in domains such as\ntext, image, and video synthesis. In this work, we explore the application of\ngenerative models to fluid dynamics, specifically for turbulence simulation,\nwhere classical numerical solvers are computationally expensive. We propose a\nnovel stochastic generative model based on stochastic interpolants, which\nenables probabilistic forecasting while incorporating physical constraints such\nas energy stability and divergence-freeness. Unlike conventional stochastic\ngenerative models, which are often agnostic to underlying physical laws, our\napproach embeds energy consistency by making the parameters of the stochastic\ninterpolant learnable coefficients. We evaluate our method on a benchmark\nturbulence problem - Kolmogorov flow - demonstrating superior accuracy and\nstability over state-of-the-art alternatives such as autoregressive conditional\ndiffusion models (ACDMs) and PDE-Refiner. Furthermore, we achieve stable\nresults for significantly longer roll-outs than standard stochastic\ninterpolants. Our results highlight the potential of physics-aware generative\nmodels in accelerating and enhancing turbulence simulations while preserving\nfundamental conservation properties.",

Conventional approaches often\nemploy explicit optimization objectives or specialized machine learning\narchitectures; however, these methods typically exhibit limited flexibility and\ngeneralizability, necessitating costly retraining to accommodate new scenarios.\nThis paper introduces an alternative paradigm that conceptualizes PR as a\nnatural language generation task. We present PathGPT, a retrieval-augmented\nlarge language model (LLM) system that leverages historical trajectory data and\nnatural language user constraints to generate plausible paths. The proposed\nmethodology first converts raw trajectory data into a human-interpretable\ntextual format, which is then stored in a database. Subsequently, a hybrid\nretrieval system extracts path-specific context from this database to inform a\npretrained LLM. The primary contribution of this work is a novel framework that\ndemonstrates how integrating established information retrieval and generative\nmodel components can enable adaptive, zero-shot path generation across diverse\nscenarios. Extensive experiments on large-scale trajectory datasets indicate\nthat PathGPT's performance is competitive with specialized, learning-based\nmethods, underscoring its potential as a flexible and generalizable path\ngeneration system that avoids the need for retraining inherent in previous\ndata-driven models.",

This study addresses key\nchallenges in anomaly detection by leveraging time correlations in sensor data,\nintegrating physical principles into machine learning models, and optimizing\ncomputational efficiency for edge applications. We build upon the concept of\ntemporal differential consistency (TDC) loss to capture the dynamics of the\nsystem, ensuring meaningful relationships between dynamic states. Expanding on\nthis foundation, we propose a hybrid autoencoder-based approach, referred to as\nhybrid TDC-AE, which extends TDC by incorporating both deterministic nodes and\nconventional statistical nodes. This hybrid structure enables the model to\naccount for non-deterministic processes. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art\nclassification performance while improving time to detect anomalies by 3%,\noutperforming the BATADAL challenge leader without requiring domain-specific\nknowledge, making it broadly applicable. Additionally, it maintains the\ncomputational efficiency of conventional autoencoders while reducing the number\nof fully connected layers, resulting in a more sustainable and efficient\nsolution.

However, in this paper, we reveal that T2I-DMs equipped with\nthe IP-Adapter (T2I-IP-DMs) enable a new jailbreak attack named the hijacking\nattack. We demonstrate that, by uploading imperceptible image-space adversarial\nexamples (AEs), the adversary can hijack massive benign users to jailbreak an\nImage Generation Service (IGS) driven by T2I-IP-DMs and mislead the public to\ndiscredit the service provider. Worse still, the IP-Adapter's dependency on\nopen-source image encoders reduces the knowledge required to craft AEs.\nExtensive experiments verify the technical feasibility of the hijacking attack.\nIn light of the revealed threat, we investigate several existing defenses and\nexplore combining the IP-Adapter with adversarially trained models to overcome\nexisting defenses' limitations.

The primordial magneto-genesis takes place in the radiation\ndominated (RD) epoch, after the electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) phase. As\na result, our mechanism is naturally free from the over-production of electric\nfields due to high conductivity in the RD epoch, and the baryon isocurvature\nproblem which takes place only if magneto-genesis happens before the ESWB\nphase. In addition, we find that a significant amount of PMFs can be generated\nwhen the scalar field experiences a tachyonic phase. In this case, the scalar\nfield is light and weakly coupled and has negligible energy density compared to\nthe cold dark matter, hence the strong coupling problem and the back-reaction\nproblem are also absent. Therefore, our model is free from the above-mentioned\nproblems that frequently appear in other primordial magneto-genesis scenarios.",

A resistive force theory-based analysis\nreveals that the effect stems from the anisotropic hydrodynamic response of the\nelongated particle to local shear, with maximal alignment torque occurring at\nintermediate particle orientations. The alignment efficiency depends on\nparticle elongation and the relative texture wavelength, with an optimal range\nfor maximal effect. While the observed alignment behavior is not limited to low\nReynolds numbers, the characteristic alignment length scale diverges as the\nReynolds number increases toward the turbulent flow regime.

To address these\nchallenges, biologically inspired event cameras offer a promising solution to\novercome the limitations of traditional RGB cameras.

The first\ncontribution is the proposed large-scale multi-modal RGB-Event human activity\nrecognition benchmark dataset, termed HARDVS 2.0, which bridges the dataset\ngaps. It contains 300 categories of everyday real-world actions with a total of\n107,646 paired videos covering various challenging scenarios.

    "abstract": "Cosystolic expansion is a high-dimensional generalization of the Cheeger\nconstant for simplicial complexes. Originally, this notion was motivated by the\nfact that it implies the topological overlapping property, but more recently it\nwas shown to be connected to problems in theoretical computer science such as\nlist agreement expansion and agreement expansion in the low soundness regime.\n  There are only a few constructions of high-dimensional cosystolic expanders\nand, in dimension larger than $2$, the only known constructions prior to our\nwork were (co-dimension 1)-skeletons of quotients of affine buildings. In this\npaper, we give the first coset complex construction of cosystolic expanders for\nan arbitrary dimension. Our construction is more symmetric and arguably more\nelementary than the previous constructions relying on quotients of affine\nbuildings.\n  The coset complexes we consider arise from finite quotients of\nKac--Moody--Steinberg (KMS) groups and are known as KMS complexes. KMS\ncomplexes were introduced in recent work by Grave de Peralta and\nValentiner-Branth where it was shown that they are local-spectral expanders.\nOur result is that KMS complexes, satisfying some minor condition, give rise to\ninfinite families of bounded degree cosystolic expanders of arbitrary dimension\nand for any finitely generated Abelian coefficient group.\n  This result is achieved by observing that proper links of KMS complexes are\njoins of opposition complexes in spherical buildings. In order to show that\nthese opposition complexes are coboundary expanders, we develop a new method\nfor constructing cone functions by iteratively adding sets of vertices. Hence\nwe show that the links of KMS complexes are coboundary expanders. Using the\nprior local-to-global results, we obtain cosystolic expansion for the\n(co-dimension 1)-skeletons of the KMS complexes.",

    "abstract": "The right to be forgotten is a fundamental principle of privacy-preserving\nregulations and extends to Machine Learning (ML) paradigms such as Federated\nLearning (FL). While FL enhances privacy by enabling collaborative model\ntraining without sharing private data, trained models still retain the\ninfluence of training data. Federated Unlearning (FU) methods recently proposed\noften rely on impractical assumptions for real-world FL deployments, such as\nstoring client update histories or requiring access to a publicly available\ndataset. To address these constraints, this paper introduces a novel method\nthat leverages negated Pseudo-gradients Updates for Federated Unlearning (PUF).\nOur approach only uses standard client model updates, anyway employed during\nregular FL rounds, and interprets them as pseudo-gradients. When a client needs\nto be forgotten, we apply the negated of their pseudo-gradients, appropriately\nscaled, to the global model. Unlike state-of-the-art mechanisms, PUF seamlessly\nintegrates with FL workflows, incurs no additional computational and\ncommunication overhead beyond standard FL rounds, and supports concurrent\nunlearning requests. We extensively evaluated the proposed method on two\nwell-known benchmark image classification datasets (CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100) and\na real-world medical imaging dataset for segmentation (ProstateMRI), using\nthree different neural architectures: two residual networks and a vision\ntransformer.

However, recent studies have shown that\ndiffusion models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, allowing attackers to\nenter input data containing triggers to activate the backdoor and generate\ntheir desired output. Existing backdoor attack methods primarily focused on\ntarget noise-to-image and text-to-image tasks, with limited work on backdoor\nattacks in image-to-image tasks. Furthermore, traditional backdoor attacks\noften rely on a single, conspicuous trigger to generate a fixed target image,\nlacking concealability and flexibility. To address these limitations, we\npropose a novel backdoor attack method called \"Parasite\" for image-to-image\ntasks in diffusion models, which not only is the first to leverage\nsteganography for triggers hiding, but also allows attackers to embed the\ntarget content as a backdoor trigger to achieve a more flexible attack.\n\"Parasite\" as a novel attack method effectively bypasses existing detection\nframeworks to execute backdoor attacks. In our experiments, \"Parasite\" achieved\na 0 percent backdoor detection rate against the mainstream defense frameworks.\nIn addition, in the ablation study, we discuss the influence of different\nhiding coefficients on the attack results.

Optical losses are ubiquitous, which inherently\nsuppress the photonic spin Hall shift (PSHS). In this work, we consider an\natomic medium that exhibits both absorption and transparency to investigate and\nmitigate the effects of loss on PSHS. We demonstrate that laser-induced\ncoherence in an atomic medium, leading to electromagnetically induced\ntransparency (EIT) at resonance, counteracts the detrimental effects of losses\non the PSHS. Upon EIT in a coherent medium enclosed within dielectric slabs,\nthe reflectivity of the incident polarized state is reduced near Brewster's\nangle to enhance PSHS. Moreover, the tunable refractive index of the atomic\nmedium enables the manipulation of PSHS without structural modifications with a\ntiny loss. Our proposed loss-free approach to PSHS may enable advanced optical\nsensing and other spin-based applications.",

The concept of inferred pBSI is\nintroduced to reduce the noiseless single-sensor pBSI problem to a Markov\ndecision process with a moderate state-space size, enabling the optimal policy\nto be obtained through a value iteration algorithm. A lower bound on the\nexpected time-average on-demand age of information performance is established\nfor the general single-sensor status update problem. For the single-sensor pBSI\nproblem, a semi-closed-form policy called the current-next (CN) policy is\nproposed, along with an efficient post-update value iteration algorithm with a\nper-iteration time complexity proportional to the square of the battery\ncapacity.

While useful for\nsingle subjects, we find that it struggles when scaling to multiple characters.\nIn this work, we first analyze the reason for these limitations. Our\nexploration reveals that the primary-issue stems from self-attention-leakage,\nwhich is exacerbated when trying to ensure consistency across\nmultiple-characters. This happens when tokens from one subject pay attention to\nother characters, causing them to appear like each other (e.g., a dog appearing\nlike a duck).

In\nparticular, we first leverage multi-modal chain-of-thought reasoning and\nregion-based generation to apriori localize the different subjects across the\ndesired story outputs. The final outputs are then generated using a modified\ndiffusion model which consists of two novel layers: 1) a bounded cross-frame\nself-attention layer for reducing inter-character attention leakage, and 2)\ntoken-merging layer for improving consistency of fine-grain subject details.\nThrough both qualitative and quantitative results we find that the proposed\napproach surpasses prior state-of-the-art, exhibiting improved consistency\nacross both multiple-characters and fine-grain subject details.",

    "abstract": "The pygmy dipole resonance (PDR) at the low-lying tail of the giant dipole\nresonance (GDR) is an interesting research subject as it carries important\ninformation about the nuclear surface with mixed isoscalar and isovector\nvibrations in $N > Z$ systems. The present paper investigates the possible\nexistence of the PDR built on excited states in a neutron-rich $^{80}$Ge\nnucleus using the phonon damping model (PDM) with and without pairing\ncorrelation at zero and finite temperatures. The results obtained within the\nPDM with exact pairing (EP+PDM) reveal the appearance of two enhanced\n$\\gamma$-transitions $E_\\gamma = 7.25$ and 7.35 MeV at $T=0.6$ MeV, which carry\nthe PDR nature and hence implying the possible existence of PDR built on\nexcited states in this nucleus. These two $\\gamma$-energies nicely match with a\nrecent experimental observation, thus indicating the crucial role of the\ninclusion of exact pairing solution in the precise description of low-lying\n$\\gamma$-transitions. The partition function-based analysis shows that this\npredicted PDR at $T=$ 0.6MeV is mainly contributed by the first $2^+$ excited\nstate of the $^{80}$Ge nucleus. The isospin mixing at the nuclear surface is\nalso observed in the investigated PDR at $T=0.6-0.7$ MeV. The primary mechanism\nunderlying the emergence of the hot PDR is found due to the coupling of GDR\nphonon to non-collective particle-particle and hole-hole configurations at\nfinite temperatures within the PDM framework, along with the shift in\nparticle-hole excitation energies due to thermal pairing correlations",

Subsequently, we design a hybrid\nattention-based fusion network to aggregate multi-modal information, in which\nthe obtained composite control priori is deeply embedded to linearly modulate\nthe intermediate fused features. To ensure the alignment between language\ninstructions and control outcomes, we introduce a novel language-feature\nalignment loss, which constrains the consistency between feature-level gains\nand the composite control priori. Extensive experiments on publicly available\ndatasets demonstrate that our RFC is robust against various composite\ndegradations, particularly in highly challenging flare scenarios.",

Cataloging viruses across\nvarious environments is essential for understanding their properties and\nfunctions. Metagenomic sequencing has emerged as the most comprehensive method\nfor virus discovery, enabling the sequencing of all genetic materials,\nincluding viruses, from host or environmental samples. However, distinguishing\nviral sequences from the vast background of cellular organism-derived reads in\nmetagenomic data remains a significant challenge. While several learning-based\ntools, such as VirSorter2 and geNomad, have shown promise in identifying viral\ncontigs, they often experience varying degrees of false positive rates due to\nnoise in sequencing and assembly, shared genes between viruses and their hosts,\nand the formation of proviruses within host genomes. This highlights the urgent\nneed for an accurate and efficient method to evaluate the quality of viral\ncontigs. Results: To address these challenges, we introduce ViralQC, a tool\ndesigned to assess the quality of reported viral contigs or bins. ViralQC\nidentifies contamination regions within putative viral sequences using\nfoundation models trained on viral and cellular genomes and estimates viral\ncompleteness through protein organization alignment. We evaluate ViralQC on\nmultiple datasets and compare its performance against CheckV, the\nstate-of-the-art in virus quality assessment. Notably, ViralQC correctly\nidentifies 38% more contamination than CheckV, while maintaining a median\nabsolute error of only 3%. In addition, ViralQC delivers more accurate results\nfor medium- to high-quality (>50% completeness) contigs, demonstrating its\nsuperior performance in completeness estimation.",

    "abstract": "Video Question Answering (VideoQA) is a complex video-language task that\ndemands a sophisticated understanding of both visual content and temporal\ndynamics. Traditional Transformer-style architectures, while effective in\nintegrating multimodal data, often simplify temporal dynamics through\npositional encoding and fail to capture non-linear interactions within video\nsequences. In this paper, we introduce the Temporal Trio Transformer (T3T), a\nnovel architecture that models time consistency and time variability. The T3T\nintegrates three key components: Temporal Smoothing (TS), Temporal Difference\n(TD), and Temporal Fusion (TF). The TS module employs Brownian Bridge for\ncapturing smooth, continuous temporal transitions, while the TD module\nidentifies and encodes significant temporal variations and abrupt changes\nwithin the video content. Subsequently, the TF module synthesizes these\ntemporal features with textual cues, facilitating a deeper contextual\nunderstanding and response accuracy. The efficacy of the T3T is demonstrated\nthrough extensive testing on multiple VideoQA benchmark datasets. Our results\nunderscore the importance of a nuanced approach to temporal modeling in\nimproving the accuracy and depth of video-based question answering.",

Comprehensive evaluation\nagainst U-Net, Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), and U-Net enhanced Fourier Neural\nOperator (UFNO) demonstrates U-ResNet superior performance in capturing sharp\nhemodynamic gradients and complex flow features. For pressure prediction,\nU-ResNet achieves a normalized mean absolute error (NMAE) of 1.10%.

Notably, U-ResNet demonstrates robust generalization to\ninterpolated Reynolds numbers without retraining - a capability rarely achieved\nin existing models. From a computational perspective, U-ResNet delivers a\n180-fold acceleration over CFD, reducing simulation time from approximately 30\nminutes to 10 seconds per case.

We use\nhighly resolved numerical simulations to investigate the flow regimes,\ndissolution rates, and mixing of the dissolved solute for $Sc = 1$, $Ra =\n[10^5, 10^8]$ and $\\Omega = [0, 2.5]$. In the absence of rotation and buoyancy,\nthe distance of the interface from its initial position follows a square root\nrelationship with time ($r_d \\propto \\sqrt{t}$), which ceases to exist at a\nlater time due to the finite-size effect of the liquid domain. We then explore\nthe rotation parameter, considering a range of rotation frequency -- from\nsmaller to larger, relative to the inverse of the buoyancy-induced timescale --\nand Rayleigh number. We show that the area of the dissolved solute varies\nnonlinearly with time depending on $Ra$ and $\\Omega$. The symmetry breaking of\nthe interface is best described in terms of $Ra/\\Omega^2$.",

    "abstract": "In order to obtain a stochastic model that accounts for the stochastic\naspects of the dynamics of a business process, usually the following steps are\ntaken. Given an event log, a process tree is obtained through a process\ndiscovery algorithm, i.e., a process tree that is aimed at reproducing, as\naccurately as possible, the language of the log. The process tree is then\ntransformed into a Petri net that generates the same set of sequences as the\nprocess tree. In order to capture the frequency of the sequences in the event\nlog, weights are assigned to the transitions of the Petri net, resulting in a\nstochastic Petri net with a stochastic language in which each sequence is\nassociated with a probability. In this paper we show that this procedure has\nunfavorable properties. First, the weights assigned to the transitions of the\nPetri net have an unclear role in the resulting stochastic language. We will\nshow that a weight can have multiple, ambiguous impact on the probability of\nthe sequences generated by the Petri net. Second, a number of different Petri\nnets with different number of transitions can correspond to the same process\ntree. This means that the number of parameters (the number of weights) that\ndetermines the stochastic language is not well-defined. In order to avoid these\nambiguities, in this paper, we propose to add stochasticity directly to process\ntrees. The result is a new formalism, called stochastic process trees, in which\nthe number of parameters and their role in the associated stochastic language\nis clear and well-defined.",

    "abstract": "Survival Regression (SuR) is a key technique for modeling time to event in\nimportant applications such as clinical trials and semiconductor manufacturing.\nCurrently, SuR algorithms belong to one of three classes: non-linear black-box\n-- allowing adaptability to many datasets but offering limited interpretability\n(e.g., tree ensembles); linear glass-box -- being easier to interpret but\nlimited to modeling only linear interactions (e.g., Cox proportional hazards);\nand non-linear glass-box -- allowing adaptability and interpretability, but\nempirically found to have several limitations (e.g., explainable boosting\nmachines, survival trees). In this work, we investigate whether Symbolic\nRegression (SR), i.e., the automated search of mathematical expressions from\ndata, can lead to non-linear glass-box survival models that are interpretable\nand accurate. We propose an evolutionary, multi-objective, and multi-expression\nimplementation of SR adapted to SuR. Our empirical results on five real-world\ndatasets show that SR consistently outperforms traditional glass-box methods\nfor SuR in terms of accuracy per number of dimensions in the model, while\nexhibiting comparable accuracy with black-box methods.

This paradigm shifts challenges\ntraditional team dynamics, requiring new interaction protocols, delegation\nstrategies, and responsibility distribution frameworks. Drawing on Team\nSituation Awareness (SA) theory, we identify two critical gaps in current\nhuman-AI teaming research: the difficulty of aligning AI agents with human\nvalues and objectives, and the underutilization of AI's capabilities as genuine\nteam members. Addressing these gaps, we propose a structured research outlook\ncentered on four key aspects of human-AI teaming: formulation, coordination,\nmaintenance, and training. Our framework highlights the importance of shared\nmental models, trust-building, conflict resolution, and skill adaptation for\neffective teaming.

The\nCommonality Principle is a necessary and sufficient condition for identifying\noptimal drivers of a portfolio in terms of its diversification dynamics. The\nproof relies on the Reichenbach Common Cause Principle, along with the fact\nthat the sensitivities of portfolio constituents with respect to the common\ncausal drivers are themselves causal. A conformal map preserves idiosyncratic\ndiversification from the unconditional setting while optimizing systematic\ndiversification on an embedded space of these sensitivities. Causal\nmethodologies for combinatorial driver selection are presented, such as the use\nof Bayesian networks and correlation-based algorithms from Reichenbach's\nprinciple. Limitations of linear models in capturing causality are discussed,\nand included for completeness alongside more advanced models such as neural\nnetworks. Portfolio optimization methods are presented that map risk from the\nsensitivity space to other risk measures of interest. Finally, the work\nintroduces a novel risk management framework based on Common Causal Manifolds,\nincluding both theoretical development and experimental validation. The\nsensitivity space is predicted along the common causal manifold, which is\nmodeled as a causal time system. Sensitivities are forecasted using SDEs\ncalibrated to data previously extracted from neural networks to move along the\nmanifold via its tangent bundles. An optimization method is then proposed that\naccumulates information across future predicted tangent bundles on the common\ncausal time system manifold. It aggregates sensitivity-based distance metrics\nalong the trajectory to build a comprehensive sensitivity distance matrix.

A question that\nnaturally arises in this situation would be whether it is possible to\nexhaustively search for all LCSs one by one in a time-efficient manner using\nonly a space linear in the LCS length, where we treat read-only memory for\nstoring the strings as excluded from the space consumed. As a part of the\nanswer to this question, we propose an $O(L)$-space algorithm that outputs all\ndistinct LCSs of the strings one by one each in $O(n^2)$ time, where the\nstrings are both of length $n$ and $L$ is the LCS length of the strings.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion transformers have demonstrated remarkable generation quality,\nalbeit requiring longer training iterations and numerous inference steps. In\neach denoising step, diffusion transformers encode the noisy inputs to extract\nthe lower-frequency semantic component and then decode the higher frequency\nwith identical modules. This scheme creates an inherent optimization dilemma:\nencoding low-frequency semantics necessitates reducing high-frequency\ncomponents, creating tension between semantic encoding and high-frequency\ndecoding. To resolve this challenge, we propose a new\n\\textbf{\\color{ddt}D}ecoupled \\textbf{\\color{ddt}D}iffusion\n\\textbf{\\color{ddt}T}ransformer~(\\textbf{\\color{ddt}DDT}), with a decoupled\ndesign of a dedicated condition encoder for semantic extraction alongside a\nspecialized velocity decoder. Our experiments reveal that a more substantial\nencoder yields performance improvements as model size increases. For ImageNet\n$256\\times256$, Our DDT-XL/2 achieves a new state-of-the-art performance of\n{1.31 FID}~(nearly $4\\times$ faster training convergence compared to previous\ndiffusion transformers). For ImageNet $512\\times512$, Our DDT-XL/2 achieves a\nnew state-of-the-art FID of 1.28. Additionally, as a beneficial by-product, our\ndecoupled architecture enhances inference speed by enabling the sharing\nself-condition between adjacent denoising steps. To minimize performance\ndegradation, we propose a novel statistical dynamic programming approach to\nidentify optimal sharing strategies.",

To ensure the reliability of cloud applications, cloud providers\nwidely adopt API testing techniques. Unfortunately, existing API testing\napproaches are insufficient to reach strict conditions, a problem known as\nfitness plateaus, due to the lack of gradient provided by coverage metrics. To\naddress this issue, we propose MioHint, a novel white-box API testing approach\nthat leverages the code comprehension capabilities of Large Language Model\n(LLM) to boost API testing. The key challenge of LLM-based API testing lies in\nsystem-level testing, which emphasizes the dependencies between requests and\ntargets across functions and files, thereby making the entire codebase the\nobject of analysis. However, feeding the entire codebase to an LLM is\nimpractical due to its limited context length and short memory. MioHint\naddresses this challenge by synergizing static analysis with LLMs. We retrieve\nrelevant code with data-dependency analysis at the statement level, including\ndef-use analysis for variables used in the target and function expansion for\nsubfunctions called by the target.\n  To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we conducted experiments across\n16 real-world REST API services.

Personalized Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which retrieves\nrelevant documents from the user's history to reflect their preferences and\nenhance LLM generation, is one commonly used approach for personalization.\nHowever, existing personalized RAG methods do not consider that the histories\nof similar users can also assist in personalized generation for the current\nuser, meaning that collaborative information between users can also benefit\npersonalized generation. Inspired by the application of collaborative filtering\nin recommender systems, we propose a method called CFRAG, which adapts\nCollaborative Filtering to RAG for personalized text generation. However, this\npresents two challenges: (1)~how to incorporate collaborative information\nwithout explicit user similarity labels? (2)~how to retrieve documents that\nsupport personalized LLM generation? For Challenge 1, we use contrastive\nlearning to train user embeddings to retrieve similar users and introduce\ncollaborative information. For Challenge 2, we design a personalized retriever\nand reranker to retrieve the top-$k$ documents from these users' histories. We\ntake into account the user's preference during retrieval and reranking. Then we\nleverage feedback from the LLM to fine-tune the personalized retriever and\nreranker, enabling them to retrieve documents that meet the personalized\ngeneration needs of the LLM.

While prior work has shown that integrating\nsearch and recommendation can be mutually beneficial, it also reveals a\nperformance trade-off: enhancements in one task often come at the expense of\nthe other. This challenge arises from their distinct information requirements:\nsearch emphasizes semantic relevance between queries and items, whereas\nrecommendation depends more on collaborative signals among users and items.\nEffectively addressing this trade-off requires tackling two key problems: (1)\nintegrating both semantic and collaborative signals into item representations,\nand (2) guiding the model to distinguish and adapt to the unique demands of\nsearch and recommendation. The emergence of generative retrieval with Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) presents new possibilities. This paradigm encodes items\nas identifiers and frames both search and recommendation as sequential\ngeneration tasks, offering the flexibility to leverage multiple identifiers and\ntask-specific prompts. In light of this, we introduce GenSAR, a unified\ngenerative framework for balanced search and recommendation. Our approach\ndesigns dual-purpose identifiers and tailored training strategies to\nincorporate complementary signals and align with task-specific objectives.\nExperiments on both public and commercial datasets demonstrate that GenSAR\neffectively reduces the trade-off and achieves state-of-the-art performance on\nboth tasks.",

To alleviate these, we extend PoNQ, a Quadric Error\nMetrics (QEM)-based representation, and propose a novel model, QEMesh, for\nhigh-quality mesh generation. PoNQ divides the shape surface into tiny patches,\neach represented by a point with its normal and QEM matrix, which preserves\nfine local geometry information. In our QEMesh, we regard these elements as\ngenerable parameters and design a unique latent diffusion model containing a\nnovel multi-decoder VAE for PoNQ parameters generation. Given the latent code\ngenerated by the diffusion model, three parameter decoders produce several PoNQ\nparameters within each voxel cell, and an occupancy decoder predicts which\nvoxel cells containing parameters to form the final shape. Extensive\nevaluations demonstrate that our method generates results with watertight\nsurfaces and is comparable to state-of-the-art methods in several main metrics.",

Existing techniques, such\nas software coloring and memory replication, introduce significant area and\nperformance overhead, especially with virtualized memory where address\ntranslation adds latency uncertainty. To address these limitations, we propose\nCVA6-VMRT, an extension of the open-source RISC-V CVA6 core, adding hardware\nsupport for predictability in virtual memory access with minimal area overhead.\nCVA6-VMRT features dynamically partitioned Translation Look-aside Buffers\n(TLBs) and hybrid L1 cache/scratchpad memory (SPM) functionality. It allows\nfine-grained per-thread control of resources, enabling the operating system to\nmanage TLB replacements, including static overwrites, to ensure single-cycle\naddress translation for critical memory regions. Additionally, CVA6-VMRT\nenables runtime partitioning of data and instruction caches into cache and SPM\nsections, providing low and predictable access times for critical data without\nimpacting other accesses. In a virtualized setting, CVA6-VMRT enhances\nexecution time determinism for critical guests by 94% during interference from\nnon-critical guests, with minimal impact on their average absolute execution\ntime compared to isolated execution of the critical guests only. This\ninterference-aware behaviour is achieved with just a 4% area overhead and no\ntiming penalty compared to the baseline CVA6 core.",

As a\nresult, the motion of KG particles/antiparticles is restricted indefinitely\nwithin the range \\(r \\in [0, \\pi/\\sqrt{2\\Lambda}]\\), and the particles and\nantiparticles cannot be found elsewhere.

Despite\nstrong performance on standard action recognition benchmarks, video\nself-supervised learning methods are largely evaluated under narrow protocols,\ntypically pretraining on Kinetics-400 and fine-tuning on similar datasets,\nlimiting our understanding of their generalization in real world scenarios. In\nthis work, we present a comprehensive evaluation of modern video\nself-supervised models, focusing on generalization across four key downstream\nfactors: domain shift, sample efficiency, action granularity, and task\ndiversity. Building on our prior work analyzing benchmark sensitivity in\nCNN-based contrastive learning, we extend the study to cover state-of-the-art\ntransformer-based video-only and video-text models. Specifically, we benchmark\n12 transformer-based methods (7 video-only, 5 video-text) and compare them to\n10 CNN-based methods, totaling over 1100 experiments across 8 datasets and 7\ndownstream tasks. Our analysis shows that, despite architectural advances,\ntransformer-based models remain sensitive to downstream conditions. No method\ngeneralizes consistently across all factors, video-only transformers perform\nbetter under domain shifts, CNNs outperform for fine-grained tasks, and\nvideo-text models often underperform despite large scale pretraining. We also\nfind that recent transformer models do not consistently outperform earlier\napproaches.

While\ninstance scene completion methods have been proposed for completing objects\nwithin a scene, they lag behind point-based object completion methods in terms\nof object completion quality and still do not consider known scene constraints\nduring completion. To overcome these limitations, we propose a point\ncloud-based instance completion model that can robustly complete objects at\narbitrary scales and pose in the scene.

However, three key\nchallenges with existing visualizations make it difficult for clinicians to\nfind information efficiently. First, the document embeddings used in these\nvisualizations are generated statically by pretrained language models, which\ncannot adapt to the user's evolving interest. Second, existing document\nvisualization techniques cannot effectively display how the documents are\nrelevant to users' interest, making it difficult for users to identify the most\npertinent information. Third, existing embedding generation and visualization\nprocesses suffer from a lack of interpretability, making it difficult to\nunderstand, trust and use the result for decision-making. In this paper, we\npresent a novel visual analytics pipeline for user driven document\nrepresentation and iterative information seeking (VADIS). VADIS introduces a\nprompt-based attention model (PAM) that generates dynamic document embedding\nand document relevance adjusted to the user's query. To effectively visualize\nthese two pieces of information, we design a new document map that leverages a\ncircular grid layout to display documents based on both their relevance to the\nquery and the semantic similarity. Additionally, to improve the\ninterpretability, we introduce a corpus-level attention visualization method to\nimprove the user's understanding of the model focus and to enable the users to\nidentify potential oversight. This visualization, in turn, empowers users to\nrefine, update and introduce new queries, thereby facilitating a dynamic and\niterative information-seeking experience.

Two scenarios were developed, and\n644 images were generated based on input prompts that specified nationalities.\nThe results show that in one scenario, 52.88% of images, and in the other,\n27.4%, depict individuals wearing traditional attire. A statistically\nsignificant relationship was observed between this representation pattern and\nregions. This indicates that the issue disproportionately affects certain\nareas, particularly the Middle East & North Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa. A\nnotable association with income groups was also found. CLIP, ALIGN, and GPT-4.1\nmini were used to measure alignment scores between generated images and 3320\nprompts and captions, with findings indicating statistically significant higher\nscores for images featuring individuals in traditional attire in one scenario.\nThe study also examined revised prompts, finding that the word \"traditional\"\nwas added by the model to 88.46% of prompts for one scenario. These findings\nprovide valuable insights into T2I models' representation of individuals across\ndifferent countries, demonstrating how the examined model prioritizes\ntraditional characteristics despite their impracticality for the given\nactivities.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have attracted significant attention in\nrecommender systems for their excellent world knowledge capabilities. However,\nexisting methods that rely on Euclidean space struggle to capture the rich\nhierarchical information inherent in textual and semantic data, which is\nessential for capturing user preferences. The geometric properties of\nhyperbolic space offer a promising solution to address this issue.\nNevertheless, integrating LLMs-based methods with hyperbolic space to\neffectively extract and incorporate diverse hierarchical information is\nnon-trivial. To this end, we propose a model-agnostic framework, named\nHyperLLM, which extracts and integrates hierarchical information from both\nstructural and semantic perspectives. Structurally, HyperLLM uses LLMs to\ngenerate multi-level classification tags with hierarchical parent-child\nrelationships for each item. Then, tag-item and user-item interactions are\njointly learned and aligned through contrastive learning, thereby providing the\nmodel with clear hierarchical information. Semantically, HyperLLM introduces a\nnovel meta-optimized strategy to extract hierarchical information from semantic\nembeddings and bridge the gap between the semantic and collaborative spaces for\nseamless integration. Extensive experiments show that HyperLLM significantly\noutperforms recommender systems based on hyperbolic space and LLMs, achieving\nperformance improvements of over 40%. Furthermore, HyperLLM not only improves\nrecommender performance but also enhances training stability, highlighting the\ncritical role of hierarchical information in recommender systems.",

To ensure conversational LLMs\nfollow instructions, role separators are employed to distinguish between\ndifferent participants in a conversation. However, incorporating role\nseparators introduces potential vulnerabilities. Misusing roles can lead to\nprompt injection attacks, which can easily misalign the model's behavior with\nthe user's intentions, raising significant security concerns. Although various\nprompt injection attacks have been proposed, recent research has largely\noverlooked the impact of role separators on safety. This highlights the\ncritical need to thoroughly understand the systemic weaknesses in dialogue\nsystems caused by role separators. This paper identifies modeling weaknesses\ncaused by role separators. Specifically, we observe a strong positional bias\nassociated with role separators, which is inherent in the format of dialogue\nmodeling and can be triggered by the insertion of role separators. We further\ndevelop the Separators Injection Attack (SIA), a new orthometric attack based\non role separators.

Creating\nsuch videos mainly involves editing raw footage and writing advertisement\nscripts, which requires a certain level of creative ability. It is usually\nchallenging to create many different video contents for the same product, and\nmanual efficiency is often low. In this paper, we present VC-LLM, a framework\npowered by Large Language Models for the automatic creation of high-quality\nshort-form advertisement videos. Our approach leverages high-resolution spatial\ninput and low-resolution temporal input to represent video clips more\neffectively, capturing both fine-grained visual details and broader temporal\ndynamics. In addition, during training, we incorporate supplementary\ninformation generated by rewriting the ground truth text, ensuring that all key\noutput information can be directly traced back to the input, thereby reducing\nmodel hallucinations. We also designed a benchmark to evaluate the quality of\nthe created videos. Experiments show that VC-LLM based on GPT-4o can produce\nvideos comparable to those created by humans.

The additional energy loss due to NMM\ncan significantly influence the He flash evolution in low-mass stars. Using the\nMESA code, we investigated the impact of NMM on the He flash evolution in\nlow-mass stars. We found that NMM leads to an increase in both the critical He\ncore mass required for the He flash and the luminosity of TRGB. For a typical\n$Z = 1 Z_{\\odot}$ , $M$ = 1.0 $M_{\\odot}$, and $\\mu_v = 3 \\times 10^{-12}\n\\mu_{\\mathrm{B}}$ model, the He core mass increases by $\\sim 5\\%$, and the TRGB\nluminosity increases by $\\sim 35\\%$ compared to the model without NMM. However,\ncontrary to previous conclusions, our model indicates that the He flash occurs\nearlier, rather than delayed, with increasing NMM values. This is because the\nadditional energy loss from NMM accelerates the contraction of the He core,\nreleases more gravitational energy that heats the H shell and increases the\nhydrogen burning rate, thereby causing the He core to reach the critical mass\nfaster and advancing the He flash. An increase in NMM results in a higher peak\nluminosity for the first He flash, a more off-center ignition position, and\nsub-flashes with higher luminosities, shorter intervals, and higher frequency.\nWe found that the internal gravity wave (IGW) mixing generated by the He flash\ncan induce sufficient mixing in the radiative zone, turning the overshoot\nregion into a low-Dmix bottleneck within the stellar interior. The increase in\nNMM in the model narrows the overshoot bottleneck region, enabling Li to enter\nthe surface convection zone more quickly, thereby enhancing the enrichment\neffect of IGW mixing on surface Li. For models incorporating both NMM and IGW\nmixing, the reduction in the overshoot bottleneck region allows them to\neffectively produce super Li-rich red clump star samples.",

MTF is essential for ensuring user satisfaction, as it directly\ninfluences recommendation outcomes.

    "abstract": "In the standard planet formation scenario, planetesimals are assumed to form\nthroughout the protoplanetary disk and to be smoothly distributed in the radial\ndirection except for the snowline. Planetesimal growth has been investigated\nusing this assumption, and the oligarchic growth model is widely accepted.\nHowever, recent simulations of gas and dust evolution have shown that\nplanetesimals form only in radially limited locations -- such as at gas\npressure bumps and snowlines -- and are concentrated in ring-like regions. When\nplanetesimals are distributed in a ring-like region, scattered ones leak from\nthe ring edge, resulting in planetesimal diffusion. To investigate protoplanet\ngrowth in expanding planetesimal rings, we perform a series of $\\textit{\nN}$-body simulations. In all the simulations, protoplanet growth is well\nexplained by oligarchic growth, while the ring width expands due to\nplanetesimal scattering by the protoplanets. Massive protoplanets tend to form\nnear the ring center, and protoplanets that form far from the ring center are\nless massive than those in the center. The scaled orbital separations depend on\nneither the initial ring width nor on the total mass, and they are consistent\nwith estimates based on the oligarchic growth model and the diffused\nplanetesimal distribution. The width of the expanded planetesimal ring does not\ndepend on its initial width, but it does depend on its total mass. The maximum\nmass of protoplanets depends strongly on the total ring mass and weakly on its\ninitial width.",

Hole grasp is widely employed by humans to manipulate hollow objects,\nfacilitating precise placement and enabling efficient subsequent operations,\nsuch as tightly packing objects into trays or accurately inserting them into\nnarrow machine slots in manufacturing processes. Asymmetric pivoting for hole\ngrasping is applicable to hollow objects of various sizes and hole shapes,\nincluding bottles, cups, and ducts. We investigate the variable parameters that\nsatisfy the force balance conditions for successful grasping configurations.\nOur method can be implemented using a commercially available parallel-jaw\ngripper installed directly on a robot arm without modification.

Importantly, we contend that the\nlimitations in prior reconstruction-based methods originate from the prevailing\ndetection via denoising in RGB space paradigm. To address this, we model AD\nunder a reconstruction-free formulation, which directly infers the final latent\nvariable corresponding to the input image via DDIM inversion, and then measures\nthe deviation based on the known prior distribution for anomaly scoring.\nSpecifically, in approximating the original probability flow ODE using the\nEuler method, we only enforce very few inversion steps to noise the clean image\nto pursue inference efficiency. As the added noise is adaptively derived with\nthe learned diffusion model, the original features for the clean testing image\ncan still be leveraged to yield high detection accuracy. We perform extensive\nexperiments and detailed analysis across three widely used image AD datasets\nunder the unsupervised unified setting to demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nmodel, regarding state-of-the-art AD performance, and about 2 times inference\ntime speedup without diffusion distillation.",

    "abstract": "This paper employs Laurent series expansions and the\nRobson--Villari--Biancalana (RVB) method to provide a refined derivation of the\nHawking temperature for two newly introduced topological black hole solutions.\nPrevious calculations have demonstrated inconsistencies when applying\ntraditional methods to such exotic horizons, prompting the need for a more\nthorough mathematical analysis. By systematically incorporating higher-order\nterms in the Laurent expansions of the metric functions near the horizon and\nleveraging the topological features characterized by the Euler characteristic,\nwe reveal additional corrections to the Hawking temperature beyond standard\napproaches. These findings underscore the subtle interplay between local\ngeometry, spacetime topology, and quantum effects. The results clarify\ndiscrepancies found in earlier works, present a more accurate representation of\nthermodynamic properties for the black holes in question, and suggest broader\nimplications for topological structures in advanced gravitational theories.",

    "abstract": "Recent outbreaks of COVID-19, Zika, Ebola, and influenza have renewed\ninterest in advancing epidemic models to better reflect the complexities of\ndisease spreading. Modern approaches incorporate social norms, mobility\npatterns, and heterogeneous community structures to capture the interplay\nbetween social and biological dynamics. This study examines epidemic\npropagation in hierarchically structured metapopulation networks, where\nindividuals interact within localized communities -- such as schools,\nworkplaces, and theaters -- and diffuse across them. Using mean-field\naveraging, we derive a scaling law linking contagion rates to the mean\nconnectivity degree, while stability analysis identifies thresholds for\ninfection surges. In networks with heterogeneous mean degrees, spectral\nperturbation theory reveals how structural variability accelerates and\namplifies disease spreading. We find that nodes with above-average degrees are\nnot only infected earlier but also act as key outbreak drivers. Framing\nepidemic dynamics as a continuous phase transition, we apply pattern formation\ntheory to show that the critical eigenvectors governing system stability are\nshaped by the network's degree distribution. Crucially, by analyzing Laplacian\neigenvector localization, we uncover a one-to-one correspondence between\ncommunity infection densities and the entries of the critical eigenvector --\nrevealing how internal community structure directly shapes global infection\npatterns. This work provides a systematic framework for understanding and\npredicting epidemic dynamics in structured populations, while highlighting the\nfundamental role of community organization.",

However, existing methods primarily rely on\nblack-box manipulation of prompt templates, resulting in poor interpretability\nand limited generalization. To break through the bottleneck, this study first\nintroduces the concept of Defense Threshold Decay (DTD), revealing the\npotential safety impact caused by LLMs' benign generation: as benign content\ngeneration in LLMs increases, the model's focus on input instructions\nprogressively diminishes. Building on this insight, we propose the Sugar-Coated\nPoison (SCP) attack paradigm, which uses a \"semantic reversal\" strategy to\ncraft benign inputs that are opposite in meaning to malicious intent. This\nstrategy induces the models to generate extensive benign content, thereby\nenabling adversarial reasoning to bypass safety mechanisms. Experiments show\nthat SCP outperforms existing baselines. Remarkably, it achieves an average\nattack success rate of 87.23% across six LLMs. For defense, we propose\nPart-of-Speech Defense (POSD), leveraging verb-noun dependencies for syntactic\nanalysis to enhance safety of LLMs while preserving their generalization\nability.",

In this work, we propose alternative simple methods to\nestimate dataset-level correlations, and show that these can be used to\napproximate an off-the-shelf model's memorization ability without any\nretraining.

This paper explores the unique advantage of Frequency\nModulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) LiDAR in autonomous perception. Given a single\nframe FMCW point cloud with radial velocity measurements, we expect that our\nobject detector can detect the short-term future locations of objects using\nonly the current frame sensor data and demonstrate a fast ability to respond to\nintermediate danger. To achieve this, we extend the standard object detection\ntask to a novel task named predictive object detection (POD), which aims to\npredict the short-term future location and dimensions of objects based solely\non current observations. Typically, a motion prediction task requires\nhistorical sensor information to process the temporal contexts of each object,\nwhile our detector's avoidance of multi-frame historical information enables a\nmuch faster response time to potential dangers. The core advantage of FMCW\nLiDAR lies in the radial velocity associated with every reflected point. We\npropose a novel POD framework, the core idea of which is to generate a virtual\nfuture point using a ray casting mechanism, create virtual two-frame point\nclouds with the current and virtual future frames, and encode these two-frame\nvoxel features with a sparse 4D encoder. Subsequently, the 4D voxel features\nare separated by temporal indices and remapped into two Bird's Eye View (BEV)\nfeatures: one decoded for standard current frame object detection and the other\nfor future predictive object detection.

Based on\nthe Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of the M87* black hole shadow,\nwe implemented necessary constraints on the parameter\nspace($a/M$,$\\lambda/M$).We found that for lower values of the magnetic charge\nparameter, the effective range of the PFDM parameter is approximately between\n-0.2 and 0, while as the magnetic charge parameter increases, this effective\nrange gradually extends toward more negative values. Then through sixth-order\nWKB method and time-domain method, we systematically analyzed the quasinormal\noscillation spectra under scalar field and electromagnetic field perturbations.\nThe results reveal that: the magnetic charge $a$ and PFDM parameters $\\lambda$\nmodulate the effective potential barrier of black hole spacetime, profoundly\ninfluencing the response frequency and energy dissipation characteristics of\nexternal perturbations. The consistently negative imaginary part of QNMs across\nthe entire physical parameter domain substantiates the dynamical stability of\nthe investigated system. Moreover, we discovered differences in the parameter\nvariation sensitivity between scalar field and electromagnetic field\nperturbations, providing a theoretical basis for distinguishing different field\ndisturbances. These results not only unveil the modulation mechanisms of\nelectromagnetic interactions and dark matter distribution on black hole\nspacetime structures but also offer potential observational evidence for future\ngravitational wave detection and black hole environment identification.",

In this paper, we address this\nproblem that many on-demand transportation start-ups face: how to establish\nthemselves in a new market. When starting, such companies often have limited\nfleet resources to serve demand across a city. Depending on the use of the\nfleet, varying service quality is observed in different areas of the city, and\nin turn, the service quality impacts the respective growth of demand in each\narea.

First, we derive\nanalytical insights into optimal allocation decisions for a stylized problem.\nSecond, we use these insights to shape the training data of a reinforcement\nlearning strategy for operational real-time fulfillment.

The resource trade-offs in simulating a block-encoding can be\nquantified by the circuit size, the normalization factor, and the time and\nspace complexity of parameter computation. Previous studies have primarily\nfocused either on the time and memory complexity of computing the parameters,\nor on the circuit size and normalization factor in isolation, often neglecting\nthe balance between these trade-offs.

    "abstract": "WiFi-based device localization is a key enabling technology for smart\napplications, which has attracted numerous research studies in the past decade.\nMost of the existing approaches rely on Line-of-Sight (LoS) signals to work,\nwhile a critical problem is often neglected: In the real-world indoor\nenvironments, WiFi signals are everywhere, but very few of them are usable for\naccurate localization. As a result, the localization accuracy in practice is\nfar from being satisfactory. This paper presents BIFROST, a novel\nhardware-software co-design for accurate indoor localization. The core idea of\nBIFROST is to reinvent WiFi signals, so as to provide sufficient LoS signals\nfor localization. This is realized by exploiting the dispersion effect of\nsignals emitted by the leaky wave antenna (LWA). We present a low-cost plug-in\ndesign of LWA that can generate orthogonal polarized signals: On one hand, LWA\ndisperses signals of different frequencies to different angles, thus providing\nAngle-of-Arrival (AoA) information for the localized target. On the other hand,\nthe target further leverages the antenna polarization mismatch to distinguish\nAoAs from different LWAs. In the software layer, fine-grained information in\nChannel State Information (CSI) is exploited to cope with multipath and noise.\nWe implement BIFROST and evaluate its performance under various settings. The\nresults show that the median localization error of BIFROST is 0.81m, which is\n52.35% less than that of SpotFi, a state-of-the-art approach. SpotFi, when\ncombined with BIFROST to work in the realistic settings, can reduce the\nlocalization error by 33.54%.",

Experiments show that the\nproposed method can achieve continual learning capabilities while reducing\nnetwork scale, without introducing regularization, replay, or freezing\nstrategies, and achieving superior accuracy on new tasks compared to direct\nlearning.

    "abstract": "Differential privacy (DP) has become a prevalent privacy model in a wide\nrange of machine learning tasks, especially after the debut of DP-SGD. However,\nDP-SGD, which directly perturbs gradients in the training iterations, fails to\nmitigate the negative impacts of noise on gradient direction. As a result,\nDP-SGD is often inefficient. Although various solutions (e.g., clipping to\nreduce the sensitivity of gradients and amplifying privacy bounds to save\nprivacy budgets) are proposed to trade privacy for model efficiency, the root\ncause of its inefficiency is yet unveiled.\n  In this work, we first generalize DP-SGD and theoretically derive the impact\nof DP noise on the training process. Our analysis reveals that, in terms of a\nperturbed gradient, only the noise on direction has eminent impact on the model\nefficiency while that on magnitude can be mitigated by optimization techniques,\ni.e., fine-tuning gradient clipping and learning rate. Besides, we confirm that\ntraditional DP introduces biased noise on the direction when adding unbiased\nnoise to the gradient itself. Overall, the perturbation of DP-SGD is actually\nsub-optimal from a geometric perspective. Motivated by this, we design a\ngeometric perturbation strategy GeoDP within the DP framework, which perturbs\nthe direction and the magnitude of a gradient, respectively. By directly\nreducing the noise on the direction, GeoDP mitigates the negative impact of DP\nnoise on model efficiency with the same DP guarantee. Extensive experiments on\ntwo public datasets (i.e., MNIST and CIFAR-10), one synthetic dataset and three\nprevalent models (i.e., Logistic Regression, CNN and ResNet) confirm the\neffectiveness and generality of our strategy.",

This approach, an upgrade from\ntraditional methods, extends the original algorithm to effectively address 3D\nperforated surface milling. Unlike conventional algorithms, the method embeds a\ncontinuous spiral trajectory within perforated surfaces without requiring\ncellular decomposition or additional boundaries. The proposed method addresses\nthree primary challenges, including modifying conformal slit mapping for mesh\nsurfaces, maintaining uniform scallop height between adjacent spiral\ntrajectories, and optimizing the mapped origin point to ensure uniform scallop\nheight distribution. To overcome these challenges, surface flattening\ntechniques are incorporated into the original approach to accommodate mesh\nsurfaces effectively. Tool path spacing is then optimized using a binary search\nstrategy to regulate scallop height. A functional energy metric associated with\nscallop height uniformity is introduced for rapid evaluation of points mapped\nto the origin, with the minimum functional energy determined through\nperturbation techniques.

Since sentence-to-sentence (Sent2Sent) and Doc2Doc\ntranslation address different aspects of the translation process, we propose\nfine-tuning LLMs for translation refinement using two intermediate\ntranslations, combining the strengths of both Sent2Sent and Doc2Doc.\nAdditionally, recognizing that the quality of intermediate translations varies,\nwe introduce an enhanced fine-tuning method with quality awareness that assigns\nlower weights to easier translations and higher weights to more difficult ones,\nenabling the model to focus on challenging translation cases.

Modern graph-cut based approaches rely on high-dimensional\nattention maps from Transformer-based foundation models, typically employing a\nrelaxed Normalized Cut solved recursively via the Fiedler vector (the\neigenvector of the second smallest eigenvalue). Consequently, they still lag\nbehind supervised methods in both mask generation speed and segmentation\naccuracy. We present a regularized fractional alternating cut (Falcon), an\noptimization-based K-way Normalized Cut without relying on recursive\neigenvector computations, achieving substantially improved speed and accuracy.\nFalcon operates in two stages: (1) a fast K-way Normalized Cut solved by\nextending into a fractional quadratic transformation, with an alternating\niterative procedure and regularization to avoid local minima; and (2)\nrefinement of the resulting masks using complementary low-level information,\nproducing high-quality pixel-level segmentations. Experiments show that Falcon\nnot only surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods by an average of 2.5%\nacross six widely recognized benchmarks (reaching up to 4.3\\% improvement on\nCityscapes), but also reduces runtime by around 30% compared to prior\ngraph-based approaches. These findings demonstrate that the semantic\ninformation within foundation-model attention can be effectively harnessed by a\nhighly parallelizable graph cut framework.

Scaling efforts focus\non connecting multiple smaller quantum devices (nodes) in a distributed manner.\nNon-local CNOTs and teleportation of quantum states become important operations\nas they enable computation between different nodes in a distributed\narchitecture. For physical qubits, today's high quantum network noise rates\nprevent the execution of distributed operations with useful accuracy. By\nemploying QEC, we show that non-local operations and teleportation of logical\nqubits between nodes are feasible under Surface Code and qLDPC encodings with\nvery low logical error rates (LER), even with network noise in near-term\nregimes. We use circuit-level simulations to assess physical and network noise\nregimes ranging from $10^{-1}$ to $10^{-6}$. This is a wider range than\ntypically studied in circuit level simulations, understanding the behavior of\nQEC codes in these regimes is necessary for achieving accurate computation. Our\nsimulations give evidence that transversal distributed operations may carry\nsignificantly lower LER than lattice surgery. Importantly, we also find that\nthe LER of our distributed operations decreases exponentially as QEC code\ndistance increases, proving the feasibility of executing large algorithms on\ndistributed quantum computers. Our results indicate that non-local CNOTs can be\ncarried out with a logical error rate of $10^{-12}$ for a physical error rate\nof $10^{-3}$ and ebit noise of $10^{-2}$.

While machine learning methods have been\nused to estimate external hand load from worker postures or force exertion\ndata, our findings reveal systematic bias in these predictions due to\nindividual differences such as age and biological sex. To explore this issue,\nwe examined bias in hand load prediction by varying the sex ratio in the\ntraining dataset. We found substantial sex disparity in predictive performance,\nespecially when the training dataset is more sex-imbalanced. To address this\nbias, we developed and evaluated a fair predictive model for hand load\nestimation that leverages a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with feature\ndisentanglement. This approach is designed to separate sex-agnostic and\nsex-specific latent features, minimizing feature overlap.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across\nvarious tasks, including sentiment analysis. However, data\nquality--particularly when sourced from social media--can significantly impact\ntheir accuracy. This research explores how textual nuances, including emojis\nand sarcasm, affect sentiment analysis, with a particular focus on improving\ndata quality through text paraphrasing techniques. To address the lack of\nlabeled sarcasm data, the authors created a human-labeled dataset of 5929\ntweets that enabled the assessment of LLM in various sarcasm contexts. The\nresults show that when topic-specific datasets, such as those related to\nnuclear power, are used to finetune LLMs these models are not able to\ncomprehend accurate sentiment in presence of sarcasm due to less diverse text,\nrequiring external interventions like sarcasm removal to boost model accuracy.\nSarcasm removal led to up to 21% improvement in sentiment accuracy, as LLMs\ntrained on nuclear power-related content struggled with sarcastic tweets,\nachieving only 30% accuracy. In contrast, LLMs trained on general tweet\ndatasets, covering a broader range of topics, showed considerable improvements\nin predicting sentiment for sarcastic tweets (60% accuracy), indicating that\nincorporating general text data can enhance sarcasm detection. The study also\nutilized adversarial text augmentation, showing that creating synthetic text\nvariants by making minor changes significantly increased model robustness and\naccuracy for sarcastic tweets (approximately 85%). Additionally, text\nparaphrasing of tweets with fragmented language transformed around 40% of the\ntweets with low-confidence labels into high-confidence ones, improving LLMs\nsentiment analysis accuracy by 6%.",

    "abstract": "Object detection in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) images poses significant\nchallenges due to complex scale variations and class imbalance among objects.\nExisting methods often address these challenges separately, overlooking the\nintricate nature of UAV images and the potential synergy between them. In\nresponse, this paper proposes AD-Det, a novel framework employing a coherent\ncoarse-to-fine strategy that seamlessly integrates two pivotal components:\nAdaptive Small Object Enhancement (ASOE) and Dynamic Class-balanced Copy-paste\n(DCC). ASOE utilizes a high-resolution feature map to identify and cluster\nregions containing small objects. These regions are subsequently enlarged and\nprocessed by a fine-grained detector. On the other hand, DCC conducts\nobject-level resampling by dynamically pasting tail classes around the cluster\ncenters obtained by ASOE, main-taining a dynamic memory bank for each tail\nclass. This approach enables AD-Det to not only extract regions with small\nobjects for precise detection but also dynamically perform reasonable\nresampling for tail-class objects. Consequently, AD-Det enhances the overall\ndetection performance by addressing the challenges of scale variations and\nclass imbalance in UAV images through a synergistic and adaptive framework. We\nextensively evaluate our approach on two public datasets, i.e., VisDrone and\nUAVDT, and demonstrate that AD-Det significantly outperforms existing\ncompetitive alternatives. Notably, AD-Det achieves a 37.5% Average Precision\n(AP) on the VisDrone dataset, surpassing its counterparts by at least 3.1%.",

    "abstract": "A stellar mass black hole (BH) is believed to be formed as the result of the\ncore collapse of a massive star at the end of its evolution. For a class of\nGamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), it is widely believed that their centre engines are\njust these stellar-mass BHs, which accrete the collapsing matter in\nhyper-accretion mode. In such systems, a popular scenario is that the magnetic\nfield supported in the accretion disk extracts the rotational energy of the\nspinning BH and launches a jet on one hand, and the accretion of the infalling\nmatter of the collapse will increase the BH's rotational energy on the other\nhand. Here we report that when the accretion process is dominated by a\nMagnetically-Arrested-Disk (MAD), the above-mentioned two competing processes\nlink to each other, so that the spin evolution of the BH can be written in a\nsimple form. Most interestingly, when the total accreted mass is enough, the BH\nspin will always reach an equilibrium value. This value does not depend on the\ninitial mass and spin of the BH, as well as the history of accretion but is a\nfunction of the accretion physics near the event horizon. This model predicts\nthat there is a population of stellar-mass BH that possess a universal spin at\nthe end of the collapsing accretion. We test this prediction against the 4th\ngravitational wave (GW) catalogue (GWTC-4.0) and found that there is a\ndominating population with high significance, in which the distribution of the\nspin of the secondary BH is centred narrowly around a single value ~0.017. The\nabove-mentioned scenario is supported and the parameters of the accretion\nphysics near the event horizon can be thus constrained. The result is also\nconsistent with previous numerical simulations.",

    "abstract": "Speculative Decoding (SD) is a widely used approach to accelerate the\ninference of large language models (LLMs) without reducing generation quality.\nIt operates by first using a compact model to draft multiple tokens\nefficiently, followed by parallel verification using the target LLM. This\napproach leads to faster inference compared to auto-regressive decoding. While\nthere are multiple approaches to create a draft model, one promising approach\nis to use early-exit methods. These methods draft candidate tokens by using a\nsubset of layers of the primary model and applying the remaining layers for\nverification, allowing a single model to handle both drafting and verification.\nWhile this technique reduces memory usage and computational cost, its\nperformance relies on the choice of the exit layer for drafting and the number\nof tokens drafted (speculation length) in each SD round. Prior works use\nhyperparameter exploration to statically select these values. However, our\nevaluations show that these hyperparameter values are task-specific, and even\nwithin a task they are dependent on the current sequence context. We introduce\nDEL (Dynamic Exit Layer), a plug-and-play method that adaptively selects the\nexit layer and speculation length during inference. DEL dynamically tracks the\ntoken acceptance rate if the tokens are drafted at each layer of an LLM and\nuses that knowledge to heuristically select the optimal exit layer and\nspeculation length. Our experiments across a broad range of models and\ndownstream tasks show that DEL achieves overall speedups of\n$2.16\\times$$\\sim$$2.62\\times$ over vanilla auto-regressive decoding and\nimproves upon state-of-the-art SD methods, which peak at $2.43\\times$, by up to\n$0.19\\times$.

In this work, we test statistical isotropy in\nPlanck Data Release 4 (PR4) by estimating the temperature and $E$-mode power\nspectra across independent sky regions. We find that the directions with higher\nlocal bandpower amplitudes in intensity are clustered for multipoles between\n200 and 2000 with clustering probabilities consistently below 1% for all these\nscales when compared to end-to-end (E2E) Planck simulations; notably, this\nrange extends beyond that reported in Planck Data Release 3 (PR3). On the other\nhand, no significant clustering is observed in the polarization $E$-modes. In a\ncomplementary analysis, we search for dipolar variations in cosmological\nparameters fitted using the previously computed power spectra. When combining\ntemperature and polarization power spectra, we identify a potential anomaly in\nthe amplitude of the primordial power spectrum, $A_{s}$, with only 5 out of 600\nsimulations exhibiting a dipole amplitude as large as that observed in the\ndata. Interestingly, the dipole direction aligns closely with the known\nhemispherical power asymmetry, suggesting a potential link between these\nanomalies. All other cosmological parameters remain consistent with\n$\\Lambda\\mathrm{CDM}$ expectations.

    "abstract": "Learning-based image dehazing algorithms have shown remarkable success in\nsynthetic domains. However, real image dehazing is still in suspense due to\ncomputational resource constraints and the diversity of real-world scenes.\nTherefore, there is an urgent need for an algorithm that excels in both\nefficiency and adaptability to address real image dehazing effectively. This\nwork proposes a Compression-and-Adaptation (CoA) computational flow to tackle\nthese challenges from a divide-and-conquer perspective. First, model\ncompression is performed in the synthetic domain to develop a compact dehazing\nparameter space, satisfying efficiency demands. Then, a bilevel adaptation in\nthe real domain is introduced to be fearless in unknown real environments by\naggregating the synthetic dehazing capabilities during the learning process.\nLeveraging a succinct design free from additional constraints, our CoA exhibits\ndomain-irrelevant stability and model-agnostic flexibility, effectively\nbridging the model chasm between synthetic and real domains to further improve\nits practical utility. Extensive evaluations and analyses underscore the\napproach's superiority and effectiveness. The code is publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/fyxnl/COA.",

    "abstract": "This paper develops an input-output feedback linearization-based adaptive\ncontroller to stabilize and regulate a dual-rotor rotational system (DRRS),\nwhose inertial properties as well as the geometric configuration of rotors are\nunknown. First, the equations of motion governing the dynamics of DRRS are\nderived using the Newton-Euler approach. Next, an input-output feedback\nlinearization technique is used to linearize the dynamics from the rotor speeds\nto the angular position of the system. A finite-time convergent estimator,\nbased on the portion of the DRRS dynamics, is used to update the required\nparameters in the controller. Finally, the proposed controller is validated in\nboth step and harmonic command-following problems, and the robustness of the\ncontroller to the system's parameters is demonstrated.",

    "abstract": "Controlling instabilities in complex dynamical systems is challenging in\nscientific and engineering applications. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has\nseen promising results for applications in different scientific applications.\nThe many-query nature of control tasks requires multiple interactions with real\nenvironments of the underlying physics. However, it is usually sparse to\ncollect from the experiments or expensive to simulate for complex dynamics.\nAlternatively, controlling surrogate modeling could mitigate the computational\ncost issue. However, a fast and accurate learning-based model by offline\ntraining makes it very hard to get accurate pointwise dynamics when the\ndynamics are chaotic. To bridge this gap, the current work proposes a\nmulti-fidelity reinforcement learning (MFRL) framework that leverages\ndifferentiable hybrid models for control tasks, where a physics-based hybrid\nmodel is corrected by limited high-fidelity data. We also proposed a\nspectrum-based reward function for RL learning. The effect of the proposed\nframework is demonstrated on two complex dynamics in physics. The statistics of\nthe MFRL control result match that computed from many-query evaluations of the\nhigh-fidelity environments and outperform other SOTA baselines.",

    "abstract": "Sparsely activated Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) has shown promise in scaling up\nthe learning capacity of neural networks. However, vanilla SMoEs have issues\nsuch as expert redundancy and heavy memory requirements, making them\ninefficient and non-scalable, especially for resource-constrained scenarios.\nExpert-level sparsification of SMoEs involves pruning the least important\nexperts to address these limitations. In this work, we aim to address three\nquestions: (1) What is the best recipe to identify the least knowledgeable\nsubset of experts that can be dropped with minimal impact on performance? (2)\nHow should we perform expert dropping (one-shot or iterative), and what\ncorrection measures can we undertake to minimize its drastic impact on SMoE\nsubnetwork capabilities? (3) What capabilities of full-SMoEs are severely\nimpacted by the removal of the least dominant experts, and how can we recover\nthem? Firstly, we propose MoE Experts Compression Suite (MC-Suite), which is a\ncollection of some previously explored and multiple novel recipes to provide a\ncomprehensive benchmark for estimating expert importance from diverse\nperspectives, as well as unveil numerous valuable insights for SMoE experts.\nSecondly, unlike prior works with a one-shot expert pruning approach, we\nexplore the benefits of iterative pruning with the re-estimation of the\nMC-Suite criterion. Moreover, we introduce the benefits of task-agnostic\nfine-tuning as a correction mechanism during iterative expert dropping, which\nwe term MoE Lottery Subnetworks. Lastly, we present an experimentally validated\nconjecture that, during expert dropping, SMoEs' instruction-following\ncapabilities are predominantly hurt, which can be restored to a robust level\nsubject to external augmentation of instruction-following capabilities using\nk-shot examples and supervised fine-tuning.",

    "abstract": "Episodic tasks in Reinforcement Learning (RL) often pose challenges due to\nsparse reward signals and high-dimensional state spaces, which hinder efficient\nlearning. Additionally, these tasks often feature hidden \"trap states\" --\nirreversible failures that prevent task completion but do not provide explicit\nnegative rewards to guide agents away from repeated errors. To address these\nissues, we propose Time-Weighted Contrastive Reward Learning (TW-CRL), an\nInverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) framework that leverages both successful\nand failed demonstrations. By incorporating temporal information, TW-CRL learns\na dense reward function that identifies critical states associated with success\nor failure. This approach not only enables agents to avoid trap states but also\nencourages meaningful exploration beyond simple imitation of expert\ntrajectories. Empirical evaluations on navigation tasks and robotic\nmanipulation benchmarks demonstrate that TW-CRL surpasses state-of-the-art\nmethods, achieving improved efficiency and robustness.",

    "abstract": "Inspired by human visual attention, deep neural networks have widely adopted\nattention mechanisms to learn locally discriminative attributes for challenging\nvisual classification tasks. However, existing approaches primarily emphasize\nthe representation of such features while neglecting their precise\nlocalization, which often leads to misclassification caused by shortcut biases.\nThis limitation becomes even more pronounced when models are evaluated on\ntransfer or out-of-distribution datasets. In contrast, humans are capable of\nleveraging prior object knowledge to quickly localize and compare fine-grained\nattributes, a capability that is especially crucial in complex and\nhigh-variance classification scenarios. Motivated by this, we introduce\nGaze-CIFAR-10, a human gaze time-series dataset, along with a dual-sequence\ngaze encoder that models the precise sequential localization of human attention\non distinct local attributes. In parallel, a Vision Transformer (ViT) is\nemployed to learn the sequential representation of image content. Through\ncross-modal fusion, our framework integrates human gaze priors with\nmachine-derived visual sequences, effectively correcting inaccurate\nlocalization in image feature representations. Extensive qualitative and\nquantitative experiments demonstrate that gaze-guided cognitive cues\nsignificantly enhance classification accuracy.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we study some basic problems about Toeplitz subshifts of finite\ntopological rank. We define the notion of a strong Toeplitz subshift of finite\nrank $K$ by combining the characterizations of Toeplitz-ness and of finite\ntopological rank $K$ from the point of view of the Bratteli--Vershik\nrepresentation or from the $\\mathcal{S}$-adic point of view. The\ncharacterization problem asks if for every $K\\geq 2$, every Toeplitz subshift\nof topological rank $K$ is a strong Toeplitz subshift of rank $K$. We give a\nnegative answer to the characterization problem by constructing a Toeplitz\nsubshift of topological rank $2$ which fails to be a strong Toeplitz subshift\nof rank $2$. However, we show that the set of all strong Toeplitz subshifts of\nfinite rank is generic in the space of all infinite minimal subshifts. In the\nsecond part we consider several classification problems for Toeplitz subshifts\nof topological rank $2$ from the point of view of descriptive set theory. We\ncompletely determine the complexity of the conjugacy problem, the flip\nconjugacy problem, and the bi-factor problem by showing that, as equivalence\nrelations, they are hyperfinite and not smooth. We also consider the inverse\nproblem for all Toeplitz subshifts. We give a criterion for when a Toeplitz\nsubshift is conjugate to its own inverse, and use it to show that the set of\nall such Toeplitz subshifts is a meager set in the space of all infinite\nminimal subshifts. Finally, we show that the automorphism group of any Toeplitz\nsubshift of finite rank is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}\\oplus C$ for some finite\ncyclic group $C$, and for every nontrivial finite cyclic group $C$,\n$\\mathbb{Z}\\oplus C$ can be realized as the isomorphism type of an automorphism\ngroup of a strong Toeplitz subshift of finite rank greater than $2$.",

By employing an anti-parity-time two-state guiding configuration, we\ndemonstrate efficient extraction of entanglement from any input state. This\nfilter is implemented on a lossless waveguide network using Lanczos\ntransformations, consistent with Wigner-Weisskopf theory. This scheme achieves\nnear-unity fidelity under single- and two-photon excitation and is scalable to\nhigher photon levels while remaining robust against decoherence during\npropagation.

Existing methods for TAP rely heavily on complex\ntracking-specific inductive biases and heuristics, limiting their generality\nand potential for scaling. To address these challenges, we present TAPNext, a\nnew approach that casts TAP as sequential masked token decoding. Our model is\ncausal, tracks in a purely online fashion, and removes tracking-specific\ninductive biases. This enables TAPNext to run with minimal latency, and removes\nthe temporal windowing required by many existing state of art trackers. Despite\nits simplicity, TAPNext achieves a new state-of-the-art tracking performance\namong both online and offline trackers. Finally, we present evidence that many\nwidely used tracking heuristics emerge naturally in TAPNext through end-to-end\ntraining.

    "abstract": "Extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) is a key\ntechnology for next-generation wireless communication systems. By deploying\nsignificantly more antennas than conventional massive MIMO systems, XL-MIMO\npromises substantial improvements in spectral efficiency. However, due to the\ndrastically increased array size, the conventional planar wave channel model is\nno longer accurate, necessitating a transition to a near-field spherical wave\nmodel. This shift challenges traditional beam training and channel estimation\nmethods, which were designed for planar wave propagation. In this article, we\npresent a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art beam training and channel\nestimation techniques for XL-MIMO systems. We analyze the fundamental\nprinciples, key methodologies, and recent advancements in this area,\nhighlighting their respective strengths and limitations in addressing the\nchallenges posed by the near-field propagation environment. Furthermore, we\nexplore open research challenges that remain unresolved to provide valuable\ninsights for researchers and engineers working toward the development of\nnext-generation XL-MIMO communication systems.",

    "abstract": "Boolean symbolic reasoning for gate-level netlists is a critical step in\nverification, logic and datapath synthesis, and hardware security.\nSpecifically, reasoning datapath and adder tree in bit-blasted Boolean networks\nis particularly crucial for verification and synthesis, and challenging.\nConventional approaches either fail to accurately (exactly) identify the\nfunction blocks of the designs in gate-level netlist with structural hashing\nand symbolic propagation, or their reasoning performance is highly sensitive to\nstructure modifications caused by technology mapping or logic optimization.\nThis paper introduces BoolE, an exact symbolic reasoning framework for Boolean\nnetlists using equality saturation. BoolE optimizes scalability and performance\nby integrating domain-specific Boolean ruleset for term rewriting. We\nincorporate a novel extraction algorithm into BoolE to enhance its structural\ninsight and computational efficiency, which adeptly identifies and captures\nmulti-input, multi-output high-level structures (e.g., full adder) in the\nreconstructed e-graph.\n  Our experiments show that BoolE surpasses state-of-the-art symbolic reasoning\nbaselines, including the conventional functional approach (ABC) and machine\nlearning-based method (Gamora). Specifically, we evaluated its performance on\nvarious multiplier architecture with different configurations. Our results show\nthat BoolE identifies $3.53\\times$ and $3.01\\times$ more exact full adders than\nABC in carry-save array and Booth-encoded multipliers, respectively.\nAdditionally, we integrated BoolE into multiplier formal verification tasks,\nwhere it significantly accelerates the performance of traditional formal\nverification tools using computer algebra, demonstrated over four orders of\nmagnitude runtime improvements.",

Given a pre-acquired recording of the\nscene from sparsely distributed microphones, SoundVista can synthesize the\nsound of that scene from an unseen target viewpoint. The method learns the\nunderlying acoustic transfer function that relates the signals acquired at the\ndistributed microphones to the signal at the target viewpoint, using a limited\nnumber of known recordings. Unlike existing works, our method does not require\nconstraints or prior knowledge of sound source details. Moreover, our method\nefficiently adapts to diverse room layouts, reference microphone configurations\nand unseen environments. To enable this, we introduce a visual-acoustic binding\nmodule that learns visual embeddings linked with local acoustic properties from\npanoramic RGB and depth data. We first leverage these embeddings to optimize\nthe placement of reference microphones in any given scene. During synthesis, we\nleverage multiple embeddings extracted from reference locations to get adaptive\nweights for their contribution, conditioned on target viewpoint. We benchmark\nthe task on both publicly available data and real-world settings. We\ndemonstrate significant improvements over existing methods.",

MicroNN addresses the\nproblem of on-device vector search for real-world workloads containing updates\nand hybrid search queries that combine nearest neighbour search with structured\nattribute filters. In this scenario, memory is highly constrained and\ndisk-efficient index structures and algorithms are required, as well as support\nfor continuous inserts and deletes. MicroNN is an embeddable library that can\nscale to large vector collections with minimal resources. MicroNN is used in\nproduction and powers a wide range of vector search use-cases on-device.\nMicroNN takes less than 7 ms to retrieve the top-100 nearest neighbours with\n90% recall on publicly available million-scale vector benchmark while using ~10\nMB of memory.",
