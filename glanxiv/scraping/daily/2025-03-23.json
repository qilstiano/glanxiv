    "abstract": "We propose a novel knowledge distillation approach, CustomKD, that\neffectively leverages large vision foundation models (LVFMs) to enhance the\nperformance of edge models (e.g., MobileNetV3). Despite recent advancements in\nLVFMs, such as DINOv2 and CLIP, their potential in knowledge distillation for\nenhancing edge models remains underexplored. While knowledge distillation is a\npromising approach for improving the performance of edge models, the\ndiscrepancy in model capacities and heterogeneous architectures between LVFMs\nand edge models poses a significant challenge. Our observation indicates that\nalthough utilizing larger backbones (e.g., ViT-S to ViT-L) in teacher models\nimproves their downstream task performances, the knowledge distillation from\nthe large teacher models fails to bring as much performance gain for student\nmodels as for teacher models due to the large model discrepancy. Our simple yet\neffective CustomKD customizes the well-generalized features inherent in LVFMs\nto a given student model in order to reduce model discrepancies. Specifically,\nbeyond providing well-generalized original knowledge from teachers, CustomKD\naligns the features of teachers to those of students, making it easy for\nstudents to understand and overcome the large model discrepancy overall.\nCustomKD significantly improves the performances of edge models in scenarios\nwith unlabeled data such as unsupervised domain adaptation (e.g., OfficeHome\nand DomainNet) and semi-supervised learning (e.g., CIFAR-100 with 400 labeled\nsamples and ImageNet with 1% labeled samples), achieving the new\nstate-of-the-art performances.",

    "abstract": "Emotion regulation is a crucial skill for managing emotions in everyday life,\nyet finding a constructive and accessible method to support these processes\nremains challenging due to their cognitive demands. In this study, we explore\nhow regular interactions with a social robot, conducted in a structured yet\nfamiliar environment within university halls and departments, can provide\neffective support for emotion regulation through cognitive reappraisal.\nTwenty-one students participated in a five-session study at a university hall\nor department, where the robot, powered by a large language model (GPT-3.5),\nfacilitated structured conversations, encouraging the students to reinterpret\nemotionally charged situations they shared with the robot. Quantitative and\nqualitative results indicate significant improvements in emotion\nself-regulation, with participants reporting better understanding and control\nof their emotions. The intervention led to significant changes in constructive\nemotion regulation tendencies and positive effects on mood and sentiment after\neach session. The findings also demonstrate that repeated interactions with the\nrobot encouraged greater emotional expressiveness, including longer speech\ndisclosures, increased use of affective language, and heightened facial\narousal. Notably, expressiveness followed structured patterns aligned with the\nreappraisal process, with expression peaking during key reappraisal moments,\nparticularly when participants were prompted to reinterpret negative\nexperiences. The qualitative feedback further highlighted how the robot\nfostered introspection and provided a supportive space for discussing emotions,\nenabling participants to confront long-avoided emotional challenges. These\nfindings demonstrate the potential of robots to effectively assist in emotion\nregulation in familiar environments, offering both emotional support and\ncognitive guidance.",

In this paper we study the $k$-version of\nSSR, namely $k$-Subset Sum Ratio ($k$-SSR), which asks to minimize the\nlargest-to-smallest ratio of sums of $k$ disjoint subsets of $A$. We develop an\napproximation scheme for $k$-SSR running in $O({n^{2k}}/{\\varepsilon^{k-1}})$\ntime, where $n=|A|$ and $\\varepsilon$ is the error parameter. To the best of\nour knowledge, this is the first FPTAS for $k$-SSR for fixed $k>2$.\n  We also study the $k$-way Number Partitioning Ratio ($k$-PART) problem, which\ndiffers from $k$-SSR in that the $k$ subsets must constitute a partition of\n$A$; this problem in fact corresponds to the objective of minimizing the\nlargest-to-smallest sum ratio in the family of Multiway Number Partitioning\nproblems. We present a more involved FPTAS for $k$-PART, also achieving\n$O({n^{2k}}/{\\varepsilon^{k-1}})$ time complexity. Notably, $k$-PART is also\nequivalent to the Minimum Envy-Ratio problem with identical valuation\nfunctions, which has been studied in the context of fair division of\nindivisible goods. Thus, for the case of identical valuations, our FPTAS\nrepresents a significant improvement over the\n$O(n^{4k^2+1}/\\varepsilon^{2k^2})$ bound obtained by Nguyen and Rothe's FPTAS\nfor Minimum Envy-Ratio with general additive valuations.\n  Lastly, we propose a second FPTAS for $k$-SSR, which employs carefully\ndesigned calls to the first one; the new scheme has a time complexity of\n$\\widetilde{O}(n/{\\varepsilon^{3k-1}})$, thus being much faster when $n\\gg 1/\n\\varepsilon$.",

In a large-scale\nmarketing experiment on the platform, 2310 participants were randomly assigned\nto human-human and human-AI teams. The teams exchanged 183,691 messages and\ncreated 63,656 image edits, 1,960,095 ad copy edits, and 10,375 AI-generated\nimages while producing 11,138 ads for a large think tank. Analysis of\nfine-grained communication, collaboration, and workflow logs revealed that\ncollaborating with AI agents increased communication by 63% and allowed humans\nto engage in 71% less direct text editing. While human-AI teams engaged in 18%\nmore process and content communication, human-human teams engaged in 29% more\nsocial and emotional communication. Humans in human-AI teams experienced 73%\ngreater productivity per worker and produced higher-quality ad copy, while\nhuman-human teams produced higher-quality images, suggesting AI agents require\nfine-tuning for multimodal workflows. Field tests of the ad campaigns\naccumulated ~5M ad impressions and revealed that ads with higher image quality\n(produced by human-human collaborations) and higher text quality (produced by\nhuman-AI collaborations) performed significantly better on click-through rates,\nview through rates, and cost per click metrics.

Recently, adaptive supply models\npioneered by Morpho and Euler have become a popular means of dynamic pricing\nfor loans. This pricing is facilitated by agents known as curators, who bid to\nmatch supply and demand. We construct and analyze an online learning model for\nstatic and dynamic pricing models within DeFi lending. We show that when loans\nare small and have a short duration relative to an observation time $T$,\nadaptive supply models achieve $O(\\log T)$ regret, while static models cannot\nachieve better than $\\Omega(\\sqrt{T})$ regret. We then study competitive\nbehavior between curators, demonstrating that adaptive supply mechanisms\nmaximize revenue and welfare for both borrowers and lenders.",

    "abstract": "The evaluation of a researcher's performance has traditionally relied on\nvarious bibliometric measures, with the h-index being one of the most\nprominent.

In this study, we comprehensively evaluate existing\nmetrics in their ability to account for authorship contribution by their\nposition and introduce a novel variant of the h-index, known as the\nh-leadership index. The h-leadership index aims to advance the fair evaluation\nof academic contributions in multi-authored publications by giving importance\nto authorship position beyond the first and last authors, motivated by\nStanford's ranking of the top 2 \\% of world scientists. We assign weighted\ncitations based on a modified complementary unit Gaussian curve, ensuring that\nthe contributions of middle authors are appropriately recognised.

This issue raises concerns\nabout their reliability in high-stakes domains such as fraud detection, and\nrisk assessment, where well-calibrated predictions are essential for\ndecision-making. To ensure trustworthy predictions, several GNN calibration\nmethods are proposed. Though they can improve global calibration, our\nexperiments reveal that they often fail to generalize across different node\ngroups, leading to inaccurate confidence in node groups with different degree\nlevels, classes, and local structures. In certain cases, they even degrade\ncalibration compared to the original uncalibrated GNN. To address this\nchallenge, we propose a novel AdvCali framework that adaptively enhances\ncalibration across different node groups. Our method leverages adversarial\ntraining to automatically identify mis-calibrated node groups and applies a\ndifferentiable Group Expected Calibration Error (ECE) loss term to refine\nconfidence estimation within these groups. This allows the model to dynamically\nadjust its calibration strategy without relying on dataset-specific prior\nknowledge about miscalibrated subgroups. Extensive experiments on real-world\ndatasets demonstrate that our approach not only improves global calibration but\nalso significantly enhances calibration within groups defined by feature\nsimilarity, topology, and connectivity, outperforming previous methods and\ndemonstrating its effectiveness in practical scenarios.",

Aside from\nprimordial Big Bang nucleosynthesis, massive stars, due to their short\nlifetimes, dominate the ejecta into the interstellar medium of the early\nGalaxy. Most of them will end as core-collapse supernova (CCSN) explosions, and\ntypical ejected abundance distributions, e.g. in terms of the\nalpha-element-to-Fe ratios, reflect these contributions. Essentially all CCSNe\ncontribute 56Fe. Therefore, low-metallicity stars can be used to test whether\nthe abundances of any other elements are correlated with those of Fe, i.e.\nwhether these elements have been co-produced in the progenitor sources or if\nthey require either a different or additional astrophysical origin(s). The\npresent analysis focuses on stars with [Fe/H]<-2, as they probe the earliest\nformation phase of the Galaxy when only one or very few nucleosynthesis events\nhad contributed their ejecta to the gas from which the lowest metallicity stars\nform. This was also the era before low and intermediate mass stars (or type Ia\nsupernovae) could contribute any additional heavy elements.

    "abstract": "Multi-fidelity Reinforcement Learning (RL) frameworks efficiently utilize\ncomputational resources by integrating analysis models of varying accuracy and\ncosts. The prevailing methodologies, characterized by transfer learning,\nhuman-inspired strategies, control variate techniques, and adaptive sampling,\npredominantly depend on a structured hierarchy of models. However, this\nreliance on a model hierarchy can exacerbate variance in policy learning when\nthe underlying models exhibit heterogeneous error distributions across the\ndesign space. To address this challenge, this work proposes a novel adaptive\nmulti-fidelity RL framework, in which multiple heterogeneous, non-hierarchical\nlow-fidelity models are dynamically leveraged alongside a high-fidelity model\nto efficiently learn a high-fidelity policy. Specifically, low-fidelity\npolicies and their experience data are adaptively used for efficient targeted\nlearning, guided by their alignment with the high-fidelity policy. The\neffectiveness of the approach is demonstrated in an octocopter design\noptimization problem, utilizing two low-fidelity models alongside a\nhigh-fidelity simulator. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach\nsubstantially reduces variance in policy learning, leading to improved\nconvergence and consistent high-quality solutions relative to traditional\nhierarchical multi-fidelity RL methods. Moreover, the framework eliminates the\nneed for manually tuning model usage schedules, which can otherwise introduce\nsignificant computational overhead. This positions the framework as an\neffective variance-reduction strategy for multi-fidelity RL, while also\nmitigating the computational and operational burden of manual fidelity\nscheduling.",

Existing methods address this issue through\nmodality fusion, integrating textual and image information to provide more\ndetailed priors. In this study, we argue that the granularity of text and the\ndomain gap affect the accuracy of the priors. Furthermore, the discrepancy\nbetween high-level abstract semantics and pixel-level boundary details in\nimages can introduce noise into the fusion process. To address this, we propose\nPrior-Guided SAM (PG-SAM), which employs a fine-grained modality prior aligner\nto leverage specialized medical knowledge for better modality alignment. The\ncore of our method lies in efficiently addressing the domain gap with\nfine-grained text from a medical LLM. Meanwhile, it also enhances the priors'\nquality after modality alignment, ensuring more accurate segmentation. In\naddition, our decoder enhances the model's expressive capabilities through\nmulti-level feature fusion and iterative mask optimizer operations, supporting\nunprompted learning.

Therefore, to ensure seamless\nconnectivity and reliable communications in open-source 5G software stacks such\nas OpenAirInterface (OAI), we propose a slot-based approach to the 5G random\naccess procedure leveraging full downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) slots instead of\nusing special or mixed slots. We highlight how this approach achieves reliable\n5G connectivity over 1 mile-the longest communication range that has been\nachieved so far in real-world settings using open-source 5G software stacks and\nthe Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) SDRs. We also demonstrate that,\nin a highly obstructed environment such as an industrial setting, we can\nincrease the probability of a successful random access procedure to 90%-100%\nwhen we use at least 9 OFDM symbols to transmit msg2 and msg3.",

The timescale for abiogenesis\n$\\tau_{AB}$, which depends primarily on prebiotic-chemistry, is expected to be\nindependent of the planetary habitability timescale $\\tau_{Hab}$, which depends\nprimarily on the sun and therefore on nuclear forces and gravity. Therefore, we\nexpect that either $\\tau_{AB} \\ll \\tau_{Hab}$ or $\\tau_{AB} \\gg \\tau_{Hab}$.\nThe correct inequality is universal and a single example should suffice to\nresolve this binary choice. Here I argue that, contrary to a well known\nanthropic selection effect, our existence (which entails life on Earth) can be\nconsidered evidence that the correct choice is the former. A Bayesian analysis,\ntaking into account that our existence is old evidence, implies that the\nprobability of the hypothesis $\\tau_{AB} \\ll \\tau_{Hab}$ is > 0.91, assuming\nequal priors. The Bayes factor, which depends only on the evidence, is > 10 and\nsuggests strong to decisive support for the short abiogenesis timescale\nhypothesis, according to the Jeffreys interpretation.",

Neuron-adaptive techniques, which selectively activate\nneurons in Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) layers, offer some speedups but suffer\nfrom limitations in modern Transformers. These include reliance on sparse\nactivations, incompatibility with attention layers, and the use of costly\nneuron masking techniques. To address these issues, we propose the Adaptive\nRank Allocation framework and introduce the Rank and Neuron Allocator (RaNA)\nadapter. RaNA adapters leverage rank adapters, which operate on linear layers\nby applying both low-rank matrix decompositions and adaptive masking to\nefficiently allocate compute without depending on activation sparsity. This\nenables RaNA to be generally applied to MLPs and linear components of attention\nmodules, while eliminating the need for expensive maskers found in\nneuron-adaptive methods. Notably, when compared to neuron adapters, RaNA\nimproves perplexity by up to 7 points and increases accuracy by up to 8\npercentage-points when reducing FLOPs by $\\sim$44% in state-of-the-art\nTransformer architectures. These results position RaNA as a robust solution for\nimproving inference efficiency in modern Transformer architectures.",

Within machine learning, the ultimate\naspiration is to attain Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) through a\nmachine. This pursuit has led to the exploration of two distinct AI paradigms.\nSymbolic AI, also known as classical or GOFAI (Good Old-Fashioned AI) and\nConnectionist (Sub-symbolic) AI, represented by Neural Systems, are two\nmutually exclusive paradigms. Symbolic AI excels in reasoning, explainability,\nand knowledge representation but faces challenges in processing complex\nreal-world data with noise. Conversely, deep learning (Black-Box systems)\nresearch breakthroughs in neural networks are notable, yet they lack reasoning\nand interpretability. Neuro-symbolic AI (NeSy), an emerging area of AI\nresearch, attempts to bridge this gap by integrating logical reasoning into\nneural networks, enabling them to learn and reason with symbolic\nrepresentations. While a long path, this strategy has made significant progress\ntowards achieving common sense reasoning by systems. This article conducts an\nextensive review of over 977 studies from prominent scientific databases (DBLP,\nACL, IEEExplore, Scopus, PubMed, ICML, ICLR), thoroughly examining the\nmultifaceted capabilities of Neuro-Symbolic AI, with a particular focus on its\nhealthcare applications, particularly in drug discovery, and Protein\nengineering research.

This review\nmeticulously outlines the origins and principles of the EDL theory.\nAdditionally, it categorizes battery electrode materials into two main groups:\nsemiconductors and conductors. A comprehensive examination is presented on the\nimplementation of EDL and other interface theories, accompanied by a\ncomparative evaluation of the fundamental models and experiments described. The\nreview also explores the potential advancements of EDL and other interface\ntheories, as well as their application in electrode materials. This exhaustive\nreview serves as an invaluable resource for scholars in electrochemistry and\nmaterials science, aiding in their understanding of interface theories, their\nscope of applicability, and the integration of these theories with practical\nexperimental approaches.",

    "abstract": "Multi-echelon inventory optimization (MEIO) is critical for effective supply\nchain management, but its inherent complexity can pose significant challenges.\nHeuristics are commonly used to address this complexity, yet they often face\nlimitations in scope and scalability. Recent research has found deep\nreinforcement learning (DRL) to be a promising alternative to traditional\nheuristics, offering greater versatility by utilizing dynamic decision-making\ncapabilities. However, since DRL is known to struggle with the curse of\ndimensionality, its relevance to complex real-life supply chain scenarios is\nstill to be determined. This thesis investigates DRL's applicability to MEIO\nproblems of increasing complexity. A state-of-the-art DRL model was replicated,\nenhanced, and tested across 13 supply chain scenarios, combining diverse\nnetwork structures and parameters. To address DRL's challenges with\ndimensionality, additional models leveraging graph neural networks (GNNs) and\nmulti-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) were developed, culminating in the\nnovel iterative multi-agent reinforcement learning (IMARL) approach. IMARL\ndemonstrated superior scalability, effectiveness, and reliability in optimizing\ninventory policies, consistently outperforming benchmarks. These findings\nconfirm the potential of DRL, particularly IMARL, to address real-world supply\nchain challenges and call for additional research to further expand its\napplicability.",

FUSE-based distributed file systems flip those trade-offs:\nthey run in user space for fast deployment and strong fault isolation, yet the\nFUSE interface disables the kernel's write-back page cache whenever strong\nconsistency is required. Practitioners must therefore choose between (i) weak\nconsistency with fast write-back caching or (ii) strong consistency with slow\nwrite-through I/O, an limitation that has kept FUSE distributed file systems\nout of write-intensive cloud workloads.\n  To this end, We present DistFUSE, the first distributed FUSE file system that\ndelivers write-back kernel caching and strong consistency.

    "abstract": "I dispute the conventional claim that the second law of thermodynamics is\nsaved from a \"Maxwell's Demon\" by the entropy cost of information erasure, and\nshow that instead it is measurement that incurs the entropy cost. Thus\nBrillouin, who identified measurement as savior of the second law, was\nessentially correct, and putative refutations of his view, such as Bennett's\nclaim to measure without entropy cost, are seen to fail when the applicable\nphysics is taken into account. I argue that the tradition of attributing the\ndefeat of Maxwell's Demon to erasure rather than to measurement arose from\nunphysical classical idealizations that do not hold for real gas molecules, as\nwell as a physically ungrounded recasting of physical thermodynamical processes\ninto computational and information-theoretic conceptualizations. I argue that\nthe fundamental principle that saves the second law is the quantum uncertainty\nprinciple applying to the need to localize physical states to precise values of\nobservables in order to effect the desired disequilibria aimed at violating the\nsecond law. I obtain the specific entropy cost for localizing a molecule in the\nSzilard engine and show that it coincides with the quantity attributed to\nLandauer's principle. I also note that an experiment characterized as upholding\nan entropy cost of erasure in a \"quantum Maxwell's Demon\" actually demonstrates\nan entropy cost of measurement.",

    "abstract": "Counterfactual explanations have emerged as a prominent method in Explainable\nArtificial Intelligence (XAI), providing intuitive and actionable insights into\nMachine Learning model decisions. In contrast to other traditional feature\nattribution methods that assess the importance of input variables,\ncounterfactual explanations focus on identifying the minimal changes required\nto alter a model's prediction, offering a ``what-if'' analysis that is close to\nhuman reasoning. In the context of XAI, counterfactuals enhance transparency,\ntrustworthiness and fairness, offering explanations that are not just\ninterpretable but directly applicable in the decision-making processes.\n  In this paper, we present a novel framework that integrates perturbation\ntheory and statistical mechanics to generate minimal counterfactual\nexplanations in explainable AI. We employ a local Taylor expansion of a Machine\nLearning model's predictive function and reformulate the counterfactual search\nas an energy minimization problem over a complex landscape. In sequence, we\nmodel the probability of candidate perturbations leveraging the Boltzmann\ndistribution and use simulated annealing for iterative refinement. Our approach\nsystematically identifies the smallest modifications required to change a\nmodel's prediction while maintaining plausibility. Experimental results on\nbenchmark datasets for cybersecurity in Internet of Things environments,\ndemonstrate that our method provides actionable, interpretable counterfactuals\nand offers deeper insights into model sensitivity and decision boundaries in\nhigh-dimensional spaces.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, many cyber incidents have occurred in the maritime sector,\ntargeting the information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT)\ninfrastructure. One of the key approaches for handling cyber incidents is cyber\nsecurity monitoring, which aims at timely detection of cyber attacks with\nautomated methods. Although several literature review papers have been\npublished in the field of maritime cyber security, none of the previous studies\nhas focused on cyber security monitoring. The current paper addresses this\nresearch gap and surveys the methods, algorithms, tools and architectures used\nfor cyber security monitoring in the maritime sector. For the survey, a\nsystematic literature review of cyber security monitoring studies is conducted\nfollowing the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and\nMeta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol. The first contribution of this paper is the\nbibliometric analysis of related literature and the identification of the main\nresearch themes in previous works. For that purpose, the paper presents a\ntaxonomy for existing studies which highlights the main properties of maritime\ncyber security monitoring research. The second contribution of this paper is an\nin-depth analysis of previous works and the identification of research gaps and\nlimitations in existing literature. The gaps and limitations include several\ndataset and evaluation issues and a number of understudied research topics.\nBased on these findings, the paper outlines future research directions for\ncyber security monitoring in the maritime field.",

This incompatibility is known under the terms 4/3 problem of\nthe classical electron and radiation reaction force and was circumvented in the\ncurrently most successful theories, the quantum field theories, by limit value\nconsiderations, by the mutual subtraction of infinities, i.e., by purely\nmathematical methods that eliminate obvious contradictions but are not really\nbased on an intuitive understanding of its physical causes. The actual origin\nof the problems mentioned lies in the instability of the classical electron.\nStabilization cannot be achieved within the framework of Maxwell's\nelectrodynamics.

    "abstract": "Producing high-quality segmentation masks for medical images is a fundamental\nchallenge in biomedical image analysis. Recent research has explored\nlarge-scale supervised training to enable segmentation across various medical\nimaging modalities and unsupervised training to facilitate segmentation without\ndense annotations. However, constructing a model capable of segmenting diverse\nmedical images in a zero-shot manner without any annotations remains a\nsignificant hurdle. This paper introduces the Attention Diffusion Zero-shot\nUnsupervised System (ADZUS), a novel approach that leverages self-attention\ndiffusion models for zero-shot biomedical image segmentation. ADZUS harnesses\nthe intrinsic capabilities of pre-trained diffusion models, utilizing their\ngenerative and discriminative potentials to segment medical images without\nrequiring annotated training data or prior domain-specific knowledge. The ADZUS\narchitecture is detailed, with its integration of self-attention mechanisms\nthat facilitate context-aware and detail-sensitive segmentations being\nhighlighted. Experimental results across various medical imaging datasets,\nincluding skin lesion segmentation, chest X-ray infection segmentation, and\nwhite blood cell segmentation, reveal that ADZUS achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance. Notably, ADZUS reached Dice scores ranging from 88.7\\% to 92.9\\%\nand IoU scores from 66.3\\% to 93.3\\% across different segmentation tasks,\ndemonstrating significant improvements in handling novel, unseen medical\nimagery. It is noteworthy that while ADZUS demonstrates high effectiveness, it\ndemands substantial computational resources and extended processing times. The\nmodel's efficacy in zero-shot settings underscores its potential to reduce\nreliance on costly annotations and seamlessly adapt to new medical imaging\ntasks, thereby expanding the diagnostic capabilities of AI-driven medical\nimaging technologies.",

We address these challenges by introducing prompt\nambiguity, a theoretical framework that captures users' varying abilities in\nprompt engineering, and developing an Optimal Prompt Pricing (OPP) algorithm.\nOur analysis reveals a counterintuitive insight: users with higher prompt\nambiguity (i.e., lower capability) exhibit non-monotonic prompt usage patterns,\nfirst increasing then decreasing with ambiguity levels, reflecting complex\nchanges in marginal utility.

    "abstract": "The Indian Scintillator Matrix for Reactor Anti-Neutrinos (ISMRAN) is an\nabove-ground, very short baseline reactor anti-neutrino\n(${\\overline{\\ensuremath{\\nu}}}_{e}$) experiment, located inside the Dhruva\nresearch reactor facility, Mumbai, India. The primary goal of the ISMRAN\nexperiment is the indirect detection of reactor\n${\\overline{\\ensuremath{\\nu}}}_{e}$ through an inverse beta decay (IBD)\nprocess, using a cluster of 90 optically segmented plastic scintillator\ndetectors, weighing $\\sim$1 ton. In this work, we present the neutron capture\ntime response and energy deposition of neutron capture signals generated by\ncosmic muons in the ISMRAN geometry, and we compare these experimental results\nwith Geant4-based Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. The obtained mean capture time\nof fast neutrons is 74.46 $\\pm$ 5.98 $\\mathrm{\\mu}$s and is comparable with the\nMC simulation results. The efficiency-corrected rate of muon-induced neutron\nbackground inside the ISMRAN geometry, due to the presence of a passive\nshielding structure of 10 cm lead followed by 10 cm borated polyethylene with a\nsurface area of 600 $\\mathrm{cm^{2}}$, deployed on top of the ISMRAN setup, is\nreported to be 1334 $\\pm$ 64 (stat.) $\\pm$ 70 (sys.) per day. This result shows\ngood agreement with the expected background rate from MC simulations using\nGeant4. We also estimate the muon-induced fast-neutron rate in the ISMRAN\ngeometry for the actual shielding configuration of 9000 $\\mathrm{cm^{2}}$\nsurface area to be 3335 $\\pm$ 160 (stat.) $\\pm$ 175 (sys.) neutrons\n$\\mathrm{day^{-1}}$ through an extrapolation, after incorporating the model\ndependent acceptance correction factor from the Geant4 MC simulation. Finally,\nusing these results, we evaluate the neutron production yield due to the\ncomposite shielding in the ISMRAN geometry, which is\n2.81$\\times$$\\mathrm{10^{-5}}$ neutrons per $\\mu$ per (g/$\\mathrm{cm^{2}}$) at\nsea level.",

    "abstract": "Real-time speech-driven 3D facial animation has been attractive in academia\nand industry. Traditional methods mainly focus on learning a deterministic\nmapping from speech to animation. Recent approaches start to consider the\nnondeterministic fact of speech-driven 3D face animation and employ the\ndiffusion model for the task. Existing diffusion-based methods can improve the\ndiversity of facial animation. However, personalized speaking styles conveying\naccurate lip language is still lacking, besides, efficiency and compactness\nstill need to be improved. In this work, we propose DiffusionTalker to address\nthe above limitations via personalizer-guided distillation. In terms of\npersonalization, we introduce a contrastive personalizer that learns identity\nand emotion embeddings to capture speaking styles from audio. We further\npropose a personalizer enhancer during distillation to enhance the influence of\nembeddings on facial animation. For efficiency, we use iterative distillation\nto reduce the steps required for animation generation and achieve more than 8x\nspeedup in inference. To achieve compactness, we distill the large teacher\nmodel into a smaller student model, reducing our model's storage by 86.4\\%\nwhile minimizing performance loss. After distillation, users can derive their\nidentity and emotion embeddings from audio to quickly create personalized\nanimations that reflect specific speaking styles. Extensive experiments are\nconducted to demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods.\nThe code will be released at: https://github.com/ChenVoid/DiffusionTalker.",

One approach\nto probe for lighter candidates is to consider cases where they have been\nboosted by collisions with cosmic rays in the Milky Way, such that the\nadditional kinetic energy lifts their induced signatures above the nominal\nthreshold.

    "abstract": "AI-generated images have become so good in recent years that individuals\noften cannot distinguish them any more from \"real\" images. This development,\ncombined with the rapid spread of AI-generated content online, creates a series\nof societal risks, particularly with the emergence of \"deep fakes\" that\nimpersonate real individuals. Watermarking, a technique that involves embedding\ninformation within images and other content to indicate their AI-generated\nnature, has emerged as a primary mechanism to address the risks posed by\nAI-generated content. Indeed, watermarking and AI labelling measures are now\nbecoming a legal requirement in many jurisdictions, including under the 2024\nEuropean Union AI Act. Despite the widespread use of AI image generation\nsystems, the current status of the implementation of such measures remains\nlargely unexamined. Moreover, the practical implications of the AI Act's\nwatermarking and labelling requirements have not previously been studied. The\npresent paper therefore both provides an empirical analysis of 50 widely used\nAI systems for image generation, embedded into a legal analysis of the AI Act.\nIn our legal analysis, we identify four categories of generative AI image\ndeployment scenarios relevant under the AI Act and outline how the legal\nobligations apply in each category. In our empirical analysis, we find that\nonly a minority number of AI image generators currently implement adequate\nwatermarking (38%) and deep fake labelling (8%) practices. In response, we\nsuggest a range of avenues of how the implementation of these legally mandated\ntechniques can be improved, and publicly share our tooling for the easy\ndetection of watermarks in images.",

The equation specifies an information balance condition\nbetween two logical propositions, which is satisfied only by independence and\nby this new solution. The solution is a new elementary informational\nrelationship between logical propositions, which we denote as $A \\sim B$.\n  The $\\sim$ relation cannot be expressed as a relationship between\nprobabilities without the use of complex numbers. It can, however, be greatly\nsimplified by expressing each proposition as a combination of a question and an\nanswer, for example, writing, ``All men are mortal'', as (Are all men mortal?,\nYes).\n  We will study the mathematics of questions and find out what role the $\\sim$\nrelationship plays inside the algebra. We will find that, like propositions,\nquestions can act on probability distributions. A proposition, $X$, can be\ngiven, setting $P(X)$ to 1. The question of $X$ can be raised, setting $P(X)$\nto $1/2$. Giving the proposition adds information to the probability\ndistribution, but raising the question takes information away. Introducing\nquestions into probability theory makes it possible to represent subtraction of\ninformation as well as addition.\n  We will examine how questions can be related to each other geometrically.\nRemarkably, the simplest way of orienting questions in space has the same\nstructure as the simplest quantum system -- the two-state system.

In addition to the density wave phase\nreported in the experiment, we find several regimes of superfluidity when one\nor two hopping parameters are large enough, and interestingly there is a\nsupercounterfluid phase at moderate and comparable hopping parameters. The\nuniversality classes of these phase transitions are analyzed from the\ncorrelation functions, excitation gaps, and entanglement entropy.

The values of this rate vary\ndepending on both the scattering photon rate and the kinetic energy acquired\nthrough individual photon recoils. While the combined roles of these factors\nhave been extensively studied, the energy transfer per recoil has not been\nexplicitly examined. This energy transfer is often approximated using a linear\ndipole model with coefficients $\\{1/5, 2/5, 7/5\\}$ which applies in the\nRayleigh limit. In this work, we analyze the evolution of energy transfer per\nphoton recoil for low-absorption dielectric nanospheres with diameters ranging\nfrom 2 nm to 500 nm. Using a far-field approximation, we demonstrate that the\nKerker condition, which enhances the alignment between incident and scattered\nwavevectors, may significantly reduce the energy transferred per recoil.\nAlthough this reduction is counterbalanced by the increasing scattering rate,\nfor an individual scattering event, the reduction of recoil suggests an\nintrinsic suppression of back-action. Our results reveal a potential\nenhancement in the accuracy of estimations in tabletop experiments involving\nMie particles of the considered sizes and provide guidance for the selection of\noptimal probe sizes and materials. Our interpretation of recoil reduction as a\nmanifestation of back-action suppression indicates the potential for quantum\nnondemolition (QND) measurements by tailoring scattered radiation patterns with\nmetamaterials.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in text-to-image synthesis,\nlargely attributed to the use of classifier-free guidance (CFG), which enables\nhigh-quality, condition-aligned image generation. CFG combines the conditional\nscore (e.g., text-conditioned) with the unconditional score to control the\noutput. However, the unconditional score is in charge of estimating the\ntransition between manifolds of adjacent timesteps from $x_t$ to $x_{t-1}$,\nwhich may inadvertently interfere with the trajectory toward the specific\ncondition. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that leverages a\ngeometric perspective on the unconditional score to enhance CFG performance\nwhen conditional scores are available. Specifically, we propose a method that\nfilters the singular vectors of both conditional and unconditional scores using\nsingular value decomposition. This filtering process aligns the unconditional\nscore with the conditional score, thereby refining the sampling trajectory to\nstay closer to the manifold. Our approach improves image quality with\nnegligible additional computation. We provide deeper insights into the score\nfunction behavior in diffusion models and present a practical technique for\nachieving more accurate and contextually coherent image synthesis.",

Recent research shows\nthat well-tuned reward-based pipelines remain the most robust, and\nsingle-response demonstrations can outperform pairwise preference data.\nHowever, two key challenges remain: (i) imbalanced safety datasets that\nover-represent common hazards while neglecting long-tail threats; and (ii)\nstatic reward models that ignore task difficulty, limiting optimization\nefficiency and attainable gains.

While recent multimodal large language\nmodels (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive 2D image reasoning segmentation,\nadapting these capabilities to 3D scenes remains underexplored. In this paper,\nwe introduce MLLM-For3D, a simple yet effective framework that transfers\nknowledge from 2D MLLMs to 3D scene understanding. Specifically, we utilize\nMLLMs to generate multi-view pseudo segmentation masks and corresponding text\nembeddings, then unproject 2D masks into 3D space and align them with the text\nembeddings. The primary challenge lies in the absence of 3D context and spatial\nconsistency across multiple views, causing the model to hallucinate objects\nthat do not exist and fail to target objects consistently. Training the 3D\nmodel with such irrelevant objects leads to performance degradation. To address\nthis, we introduce a spatial consistency strategy to enforce that segmentation\nmasks remain coherent in the 3D space, effectively capturing the geometry of\nthe scene. Moreover, we develop a Token-for-Query approach for multimodal\nsemantic alignment, enabling consistent identification of the same object\nacross different views. Extensive evaluations on various challenging indoor\nscene benchmarks demonstrate that, even without any labeled 3D training data,\nMLLM-For3D outperforms existing 3D reasoning segmentation methods, effectively\ninterpreting user intent, understanding 3D scenes, and reasoning about spatial\nrelationships.",

The cell contains a mmWave base\nstation (mBS) and its associated users. At the end of each time slot, a packet\narrives into the queue of a user at the mBS with a certain probability. A\nholding cost is incurred for the packets stored in a user's queue at the mBS in\nevery time slot. The number of simultaneous beams that the mBS can form to\ndifferent users is less than the number of associated users. Also, a cost is\nincurred whenever a beam is formed from the mBS to a user. In a given time\nslot, a packet transmitted from the mBS to a user that has been assigned a beam\nis successfully received (respectively, not received) if the channel quality\nbetween the mBS and the user is good (respectively, bad). In every time slot,\nthe mBS needs to assign the available beams to a subset of the users, in order\nto minimize the long-run expected average cost. This problem can be modeled as\na restless multi-armed bandit problem, which is provably hard to solve. We\nprove the Whittle indexability of the above beam scheduling problem and propose\na strategy to compute the Whittle index of each user.

However, reward\nover-optimization remains an open challenge leading to discrepancies between\nthe performance of LLMs under the reward model and the true human objectives. A\nprimary contributor to reward over-optimization is the extrapolation error that\narises when the reward model evaluates out-of-distribution (OOD) responses.\nHowever, current methods still fail to prevent the increasing frequency of OOD\nresponse generation during the reinforcement learning (RL) process and are not\neffective at handling extrapolation errors from OOD responses. In this work, we\npropose the Behavior-Supported Policy Optimization (BSPO) method to mitigate\nthe reward over-optimization issue. Specifically, we define behavior policy as\nthe next token distribution of the reward training dataset to model the\nin-distribution (ID) region of the reward model. Building on this, we introduce\nthe behavior-supported Bellman operator to regularize the value function,\npenalizing all OOD values without impacting the ID ones. Consequently, BSPO\nreduces the generation of OOD responses during the RL process, thereby avoiding\noverestimation caused by the reward model's extrapolation errors.\nTheoretically, we prove that BSPO guarantees a monotonic improvement of the\nsupported policy until convergence to the optimal behavior-supported policy.\nEmpirical results from extensive experiments show that BSPO outperforms\nbaselines in preventing reward over-optimization due to OOD evaluation and\nfinding the optimal ID policy.",

We generate\nspectral energy distributions and synthetic JWST/MIRI images of the model\ndisks, and perform an extensive grid search for particle parameters --\npertaining to composition and collisional strength -- that best match the\nobservations.

Considering time as another variable, we characterize\nthese new phases of the driven models by momentum space Chern number,\nperiodic-bulk and open-bulk real space Bott index. We also investigate the time\nevolution of pumped charge for these models and connect it with the intriguing\nwindings of the mid-gap energy levels with time. Interestingly, the maximum\nvalue of Chern number or Bott index for the driven models is more than that of\nthe winding number associated with the static model indicating the fact that\nthere exist more zero-energy modes during the full course of a driving cycle\ncompared to the underlying static models.

    "abstract": "Non-integrability in the sense of dynamical systems, also known as dynamical\nchaos, is a strongly nonlinear qualitative phenomenon. Its most promising\ntheoretical descriptions are likely to emerge from non-perturbative approaches,\nwith symmetry-based methods being particularly reliable. One such\nsymmetry-based framework is supersymmetric theory of stochastic dynamics (STS).\nSTS reformulates a general form stochastic (partial) differential equations\n(SDE) as a cohomological topological field theory (TFT) and identifies the\norder associated with the spontaneous breakdown of the corresponding\ntopological supersymmetry (TS) as the stochastic generalization of chaos. The\nFaddeev-Popov ghosts of STS act as a systematic bookkeeping tool for the\ndynamic differentials from the definition of the butterfly effect (BE): the\ninfinitely long dynamical memory unique to chaos. Accordingly, the effective\nfield theory (EFT) of the TS breaking is essentially a field theory of the BE\nin the long-wavelength limit. Building on this perspective, here we demonstrate\nthat one way to build such EFTs is the background field method with the\nexternal $\\mathfrak{gl}(1|1)$ supergauge field coupled to N=2 supercurrents of\nSTS, the fermion number conservation, and translations in time. By the\nGoldstone theorem, the resulting EFTs are conformal field theories (CFTs) and\nthe operator product expansion provides an explanation for 1/f noise -- the\nexperimental signature of chaos in the form of dynamical power-law\ncorrelations. Moreover, the generating functional of the background field\npossesses its own TS, revealing the topological nature of the BE. Particularly,\nwhen the Anti-de Sitter(AdS)/CFT correspondence is an acceptable approximation,\nthe holographic dual of EFT is a cohomological TFT on AdS in which the\nassociated TS and the isometry of the basespace underlie the BE and 1/f noise,\nrespectively.",

However, INR-based classification still\nsignificantly under-performs compared to pixel-based methods like CNNs. This\nwork presents an end-to-end strategy for initializing SIRENs together with a\nlearned learning-rate scheme, to yield representations that improve\nclassification accuracy. We show that a simple, straightforward, Transformer\nmodel applied to a meta-learned SIREN, without incorporating explicit symmetry\nequivariances, outperforms the current state-of-the-art. On the CIFAR-10 SIREN\nclassification task, we improve the state-of-the-art without augmentations from\n38.8% to 59.6%, and from 63.4% to 64.7% with augmentations.

Both of the\nresults reveal that the energy-doubling phenomenon presents when the dipoles\nare placed in close proximity. As the distance between the two dipoles\nincreases, it is found that the total radiative power fluctuates in a damped\nmanner and ultimately converges to a value required by energy conservation law.\nThe theoretical conclusion of energy doubling is validated by experimental\nobservations, which show a 1.59-fold increase in power within a microwave\nanechoic chamber. By analyzing the interactions, i.e., the EM coupling, between\nthe two sources, we characterize a complete phenomenon of energy\nnon-conservation.",

Finite-element modelling is conducted on carbon-reinforced\nepoxy UD bundles with one fiber broken for different combinations of the bundle\nparameters: aligned/misaligned fibers and constant/randomly distributed fiber\ndiameters. Two definitions of stress concentration factor (SCF) are examined,\nbased on average and maximum stress over the fiber cross-section.

Methods Our objective in this study was to\nconduct a systematic review of research employing sentiment analysis or stance\ndetection to study discourse towards COVID-19 vaccines and vaccination spread\non Twitter (officially known as X since 2023). Following registration in the\nPROSPERO international registry of systematic reviews, we searched papers\npublished from 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2023 that used supervised machine\nlearning to assess COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy through stance detection or\nsentiment analysis on Twitter. We categorized the studies according to a\ntaxonomy of five dimensions: tweet sample selection approach, self-reported\nstudy type, classification typology, annotation codebook definitions, and\ninterpretation of results. We analyzed if studies using stance detection report\ndifferent hesitancy trends than those using sentiment analysis by examining how\nCOVID-19 vaccine hesitancy is measured, and whether efforts were made to avoid\nmeasurement bias. Results Our review found that measurement bias is widely\nprevalent in studies employing supervised machine learning to analyze sentiment\nand stance toward COVID-19 vaccines and vaccination.

    "abstract": "Open Vocabulary Video Anomaly Detection (OVVAD) seeks to detect and classify\nboth base and novel anomalies. However, existing methods face two specific\nchallenges related to novel anomalies. The first challenge is detection\nambiguity, where the model struggles to assign accurate anomaly scores to\nunfamiliar anomalies. The second challenge is categorization confusion, where\nnovel anomalies are often misclassified as visually similar base instances. To\naddress these challenges, we explore supplementary information from multiple\nsources to mitigate detection ambiguity by leveraging multiple levels of visual\ndata alongside matching textual information. Furthermore, we propose\nincorporating label relations to guide the encoding of new labels, thereby\nimproving alignment between novel videos and their corresponding labels, which\nhelps reduce categorization confusion. The resulting Anomize framework\neffectively tackles these issues, achieving superior performance on UCF-Crime\nand XD-Violence datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in OVVAD.",

    "abstract": "Controllability, one of the fundamental concepts in control theory, consists\nin guiding a system from an initial state to a desired one within a limited\n(and possibly minimum) time interval. When the objective is limited to a\nspecific sub-region of the system's domain, the concept is referred to as\nregional controllability. We examine this notion in the context of Boolean\none-dimensional cellular automata of finite length. Depending on the local\nevolution rule, we investigate whether it is possible to control the evolution\nof the system by imposing particular values on the boundary conditions. This\napproach is related to key dynamical properties of CA, specifically chain\ntransitivity and chain mixing. We show that the control problem can be\nformulated as a Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problem and can thus be addressed\nusing SAT solvers. We also show how finding shortest paths in the configuration\ngraph allows to determine controllability properties. From our observations we\ncan state that only peripherally-linear rules are fully controllable, while for\nother rules, the reachability ratio, that is, the fraction of controllable\npairs of initial and final configurations, is vanishing when the system size\ngrows.",

According to the Altshuler-Lee-Stone\ntheory, the amplitude of UCF remains independent of system parameters such as\nFermi energy and disorder strength. However, recent experiments have\ndemonstrated a significant variation in UCF with respect to Fermi energy in the\nanisotropic Dirac semimetal $\\mathrm{Cd_3As_2}$, suggesting a dependence on\nband anisotropy. In this work, we reconcile the discrepancy between theoretical\npredictions and experimental observations through a detailed study of UCF\nversus Fermi energy using a tight-binding model with tunable anisotropy\nparameters. Near the band edge, the Hamiltonian is simplified to an anisotropic\nfree electron gas model, recovering the generalized Altshuler-Lee-Stone theory.\nHowever, as the Fermi energy shifts toward the band center, where rotational\nsymmetry breaks into $C_4$ (four-fold rotational) symmetry, the UCF amplitude\ndeviates from the standard theory. Our findings reveal that UCF becomes\nincreasingly sensitive to Fermi energy as the anisotropy grows stronger.\nFurthermore, using realistic parameters for $\\mathrm{Cd_3As_2}$, our\ncalculations demonstrate an increase in UCF away from the Dirac point, in\nqualitative agreement with experimental results. The enhancement of UCF occurs\nin two perpendicular transport directions that we have calculated, albeit with\nquantitative differences in magnitude, which can be tested in future\nexperiments. Given the prevalence of anisotropic materials and technical\nadvances in engineering anisotropy through strain or twist, our results offer a\nvaluable reference for characterizing intrinsic electronic properties via UCF.",

Although their connection to strongly magnetized\nneutron stars has been strongly indicated, the exact triggering process and\nradiation mechanism are still unknown and highly debated. Due to their\nextremely short duration, the observation of FRBs has long been a difficult\ntask even for large radio telescopes. The difficulty results from the fact that\nthe information obtained in observations is always incomplete, since the\ntelescope always has a limited flux sensitivity and finite operating frequency\nband. A pressing challenge is to decode the intrinsic features of FRBs from the\nincomplete observations. Here we establish an efficient methodology to overcome\nthis problem, aiming at effectively correcting for the fluence and frequency\ncutoffs. Using this method, inverse modeling is performed on a large number of\nrepeating bursts from FRB 20121102A to recover their intrinsic features. It is\nfound that strong bursts intrinsically tend to concentrate their energy in a\nnarrow band, while the spectral range of weak bursts can be either narrow or\nwide. However, when a weak burst has a broad spectrum, the wing of the spectrum\ncan easily go undetected, resulting in a very narrow spectrum being observed.\nThe narrow spectrum features observed in repeating FRBs are thus an\nobservational selection effect. Underestimation of the burst energy caused by\nobservational cutoffs is also corrected for, and the intrinsic burst energy\ndistribution is re-constructed. It is also found that the bandwidth increases\nwith the increasing central frequency in the Arecibo sample (1.15-1.73 GHz),\nbut such a correlation is not observed in the FAST (1-1.5 GHz) and GBT (4-8\nGHz) sample.

Recent studies reveal that\nadversaries can exploit data synthesis techniques to steal machine learning\nmodels even in scenarios devoid of real data, leading to data-free model\nstealing attacks. Existing defenses against such attacks suffer from\nlimitations, including poor effectiveness, insufficient generalization ability,\nand low comprehensiveness. In response, this paper introduces a novel defense\nframework named Model-Guardian. Comprising two components, Data-Free Model\nStealing Detector (DFMS-Detector) and Deceptive Predictions (DPreds),\nModel-Guardian is designed to address the shortcomings of current defenses with\nthe help of the artifact properties of synthetic samples and gradient\nrepresentations of samples. Extensive experiments on seven prevalent data-free\nmodel stealing attacks showcase the effectiveness and superior generalization\nability of Model-Guardian, outperforming eleven defense methods and\nestablishing a new state-of-the-art performance. Notably, this work pioneers\nthe utilization of various GANs and diffusion models for generating highly\nrealistic query samples in attacks, with Model-Guardian demonstrating accurate\ndetection capabilities.",

    "abstract": "The discipline of Software Engineering (SE) allows students to understand\nspecific concepts or problems while designing software. Empowering students\nwith the necessary knowledge and skills for the software industry is\nchallenging for universities. One key problem is that traditional methodologies\noften leave students as passive agents, limiting engagement and learning\neffectiveness. To address this issue, instructors must promote active learning\nin the classroom. Among the teaching methodologies, Example-Based Learning\n(EBL) has shown promise in improving the quality of Software Engineering\nEducation (SEE). This study aims to investigate and classify the existing\nempirical evidence about using EBL in SEE. We carried out a systematic mapping\nto collect existing studies and evidence that describe how instructors have\nbeen employing EBL to teach SE concepts. By analyzing 30 studies, we identified\nthe benefits and difficulties of using EBL, the SE contents taught by\ninstructors, and the artifacts that support the methodology's use in the\nclassroom. Besides, we identified the main types of examples used in SEE\nthrough EBL. We realized that EBL contributes to student learning, helping in\nstudents' interaction, interpreting and applying concepts, and increasing\nstudent motivation and confidence. However, some barriers to adopting EBL in\nSEE are increasing the effort required by instructors, lack of adequate\nlearning support, and time spent constructing diagrams with errors. Overall,\nour findings suggest that EBL can improve the effectiveness of SEE, but more\nresearch is needed to address the gaps and challenges identified in our study.",

We propose a multi-model\nframework employing up to three lightweight worker models and a single, more\nrobust judge model analogous to draft models and target model, respectively, in\nspeculative decoding. The worker models, tasked with the bulk of the\ncomputation, independently predict discrete class labels for a given input.\nWhen majority worker models agree on a label, it is accepted as the final\nlabel, optimizing efficiency by bypassing the computationally expensive judge\nmodel. In cases of disagreement, the judge model intervenes to resolve the\nlabel. This approach minimizes redundant computation, leverages the redundancy\nof multiple workers for confidence, and confines the judge model's role to\nchallenging cases, offering a practical balance of efficiency and accuracy. Our\nanalysis suggests that smaller out of the box instruction/chat finetuned worker\nmodels with 3 billion parameters (hereafter, 3B) demonstrate a level of\nalignment with judge models comparable to that of larger finetuned worker\nmodels with 7 billion parameters (hereafter, 7B) across both simple and higher\norder reasoning tasks.

We propose to incorporate the skewness correction into\nthe definition of an approximating variational family. We consider\napproximating the posterior for hierarchical models, in which there are\n``global'' and ``local'' parameters. A baseline variational approximation is\ndefined as the product of a Gaussian marginal posterior for global parameters\nand a Gaussian conditional posterior for local parameters given the global\nones. Skewness corrections are then considered. The adjustment of the\nconditional posterior term for local variables is adaptive to the global\nparameter value. Optimization of baseline variational parameters is performed\njointly with the skewness correction. Our approach allows the location, scale\nand skewness to be captured separately, without using additional parameters for\nskewness adjustments.

To streamline the pipeline and achieve\nglobal optimization, we propose PanopticSplatting, an end-to-end system for\nopen-vocabulary panoptic reconstruction. Our method introduces query-guided\nGaussian segmentation with local cross attention, lifting 2D instance masks\nwithout cross-frame association in an end-to-end way. The local cross attention\nwithin view frustum effectively reduces the training memory, making our model\nmore accessible to large scenes with more Gaussians and objects. In addition,\nto address the challenge of noisy labels in 2D pseudo masks, we propose label\nblending to promote consistent 3D segmentation with less noisy floaters, as\nwell as label warping on 2D predictions which enhances multi-view coherence and\nsegmentation accuracy. Our method demonstrates strong performances in 3D scene\npanoptic reconstruction on the ScanNet-V2 and ScanNet++ datasets, compared with\nboth NeRF-based and Gaussian-based panoptic reconstruction methods.

This contrasts with momentum-conserving (\"wet\") active matter\nsystems, such as suspensions of swimming bacteria, where no theoretical\nprediction of GNFs exist, although numerous experimental observations of such\nenhanced fluctuations have been reported. In this Letter, we numerically\nconfirm the emergence of super-Gaussian number fluctuations in a 3-dimensional\nsuspension of pusher microswimmers undergoing a transition to collective\nmotion. These fluctuations emerge sharply above the transition, but only for\nsufficiently large values of the bacterial persistence length $\\ell_p = v_s /\n\\lambda$, where $v_s$ is the bacterial swimming speed and $\\lambda$ the\ntumbling rate. Crucially, these \"pseudo-GNFs\" differ from true GNFs, as they\nonly occur on length scales shorter than the typical size $\\xi$ of nematic\npatches in the collective motion state, which is in turn proportional to the\nsingle-swimmer persistence length $\\ell_p$. Our results thus suggest that\nobservations of enhanced density fluctuations in biological active matter\nsystems actually represent transient effects that decay away beyond mesoscopic\nlength scales, and raises the question to what extent \"true\" GNFs with\nuniversal properties can exist in the presence of fluid flows.",

Though promising, existing approaches more or less\noverlook the potential usage of landscape knowledge. In this paper, we propose\na novel optimization framework tailored for MMOPs, termed as APDMMO, which\nfacilitates peak detection via fully leveraging the landscape knowledge and\nhence capable of providing strong optimization performance on MMOPs.\nSpecifically, we first design a novel surrogate landscape model which ensembles\na group of non-linear activation units to improve the regression accuracy on\ndiverse MMOPs. Then we propose a free-of-trial peak detection method which\nefficiently locates potential peak areas through back-propagation on the\nlearned surrogate landscape model. Based on the detected peak areas, we employ\nSEP-CMAES for local search within these areas in parallel to further improve\nthe accuracy of the found optima. Extensive benchmarking results demonstrate\nthat APDMMO outperforms several up-to-date baselines. Further ablation studies\nverify the effectiveness of the proposed novel designs.

    "abstract": "Data scarcity is a long-standing challenge in the Vision-Language Navigation\n(VLN) field, which extremely hinders the generalization of agents to unseen\nenvironments. Previous works primarily rely on additional simulator data or\nweb-collected images/videos to improve the generalization. However, the\nsimulator environments still face limited diversity, and the web-collected data\noften requires extensive labor to remove the noise. In this paper, we propose a\nRewriting-driven AugMentation (RAM) paradigm for VLN, which directly creates\nthe unseen observation-instruction pairs via rewriting human-annotated training\ndata. Benefiting from our rewriting mechanism, new observation-instruction can\nbe obtained in both simulator-free and labor-saving manners to promote\ngeneralization. Specifically, we first introduce Object-Enriched Observation\nRewriting, where we combine Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Large Language\nModels (LLMs) to derive rewritten object-enriched scene descriptions, enabling\nobservation synthesis with diverse objects and spatial layouts via\nText-to-Image Generation Models (T2IMs). Then, we propose Observation-Contrast\nInstruction Rewriting, which generates observation-aligned rewritten\ninstructions by requiring LLMs to reason the difference between original and\nnew observations. We further develop a mixing-then-focusing training strategy\nwith a random observation cropping scheme, effectively enhancing data\ndistribution diversity while suppressing augmentation data noise during\ntraining. Experiments on both the discrete environments (R2R, REVERIE, and R4R\ndatasets) and continuous environments (R2R-CE dataset) show the superior\nperformance and impressive generalization ability of our method.

    "abstract": "Recognizing arbitrary or previously unseen categories is essential for\ncomprehensive real-world 3D scene understanding. Currently, all existing\nmethods rely on 2D or textual modalities during training or together at\ninference. This highlights the clear absence of a model capable of processing\n3D data alone for learning semantics end-to-end, along with the necessary data\nto train such a model. Meanwhile, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as\nthe de facto standard for 3D scene representation across various vision tasks.\nHowever, effectively integrating semantic reasoning into 3DGS in a\ngeneralizable manner remains an open challenge. To address these limitations,\nwe introduce SceneSplat, to our knowledge the first large-scale 3D indoor scene\nunderstanding approach that operates natively on 3DGS. Furthermore, we propose\na self-supervised learning scheme that unlocks rich 3D feature learning from\nunlabeled scenes. To power the proposed methods, we introduce SceneSplat-7K,\nthe first large-scale 3DGS dataset for indoor scenes, comprising 7916 scenes\nderived from seven established datasets, such as ScanNet and Matterport3D.\nGenerating SceneSplat-7K required computational resources equivalent to 150 GPU\ndays on an L4 GPU, enabling standardized benchmarking for 3DGS-based reasoning\nfor indoor scenes. Our exhaustive experiments on SceneSplat-7K demonstrate the\nsignificant benefit of the proposed method over the established baselines.",

Although a variety of exoskeleton\ncontrols have been developed for robot-assisted gait rehabilitation, little\nattention has been paid to correcting the gait asymmetry of stroke patients\nfollowing the assist-as-need (AAN) principle, and it is still challenging to\nproperly share control between the exoskeleton and stroke patients with partial\nmotor control. In view of this, this article proposes an AAN hip exoskeleton\ncontrol with human-in-the-loop optimization to correct gait asymmetry in stroke\npatients. To realize the AAN concept, an objective function was designed for\nreal-time evaluation of the subject's gait performance and active\nparticipation, which considers the variability of natural human movement and\nguides the online tuning of control parameters on a subject-specific basis. In\nthis way, patients were stimulated to contribute as much as possible to\nmovement, thus maximizing the efficiency and outcomes of post-stroke gait\nrehabilitation. Finally, an experimental study was conducted to verify the\nfeasibility and effectiveness of the proposed AAN control on healthy subjects\nwith artificial gait impairment. For the first time, the common hypothesis that\nAAN controls can improve human active participation was validated from the\nbiomechanics viewpoint.",

    "abstract": "The bolometric radiation from a central body is potentially a powerful driver\nof atmospheric escape from planets or satellites. When heated above their\nequilibrium temperatures those satellites, due to their low surface gravity,\nare be prone to significant atmospheric erosion. Such high temperatures can be\nreached through a known mechanism: a large ratio of the irradiation to\nre-radiation opacities of the atmospheric species. We investigate this\nmechanism for irradiating black-bodies of sub-stellar temperatures and find\nthat specific molecules exist, such as $\\rm NH_3$ and $\\rm CH_4$, which develop\ntemperature inversions under the irradiation of young post-formation giant\nplanets. These non-isothermal temperature profiles lead to escape rates that\ncan significantly exceed isothermal Parker-model escape rates evaluated at the\nsatellite's equilibrium temperature. Our results indicate that exo-satellites\ncan lose most of their atmospheric mass through this mechanism if the cooling\nof the exo-satellite's interior is not too rapid. In all scenarios, we find a\nhierarchical ordering of escape rates of atmospheric species due to thermal\ndecoupling in the upper atmosphere. This thermal decoupling leads to a natural\ndepletion of $\\rm CH_4$ and retention of $\\rm NH_3$ in our models. We find that\ngiant planets with masses above 2$m_{\\rm Jup}$, for cold starts and above\n1$m_{\\rm Jup}$ in hot start scenarios are able to remove the majority of a\nTitan analogue's atmosphere. Hence, finding and characterizing exomoon\natmospheres in hypothetical future surveys can constrain the post-formation\ncooling behaviour of giant planets.",

Traditional methods such as\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA) reduce dimensionality and identify key\nfeatures that explain the most variance, but are constrained by their reliance\non linear assumptions. In contrast, neural networks offer assumption-free\nfeature extraction through self-supervised learning techniques such as\nautoencoders, though their interpretability remains a challenge in fields\nrequiring transparency. To address this gap, this paper introduces Spofe, a\nnovel self-supervised machine learning pipeline that marries the power of\nkernel principal components for capturing nonlinear dependencies with a sparse\nand principled polynomial representation to achieve clear interpretability with\nstatistical rigor. Underpinning our approach is a robust theoretical framework\nthat delivers precise error bounds and rigorous false discovery rate (FDR)\ncontrol via a multi-objective knockoff selection procedure; it effectively\nbridges the gap between data-driven complexity and statistical reliability via\nthree stages: (1) generating self-supervised signals using kernel principal\ncomponents to model complex patterns, (2) distilling these signals into sparse\npolynomial functions for improved interpretability, and (3) applying a\nmulti-objective knockoff selection procedure with significance testing to\nrigorously identify important features.

Conventional communication\nsystems minimize interference by orthogonally allocating resources (time and/or\nbandwidth) among users, which limits their capacity. We introduce a machine\nlearning (ML)-aided wireless image transmission method that merges compression\nand channel coding using a multi-view autoencoder, which allows the\ntransmitters to use all the available channel resources simultaneously,\nresulting in a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme. The receiver must\nrecover all the images from the received superposed signal, while also\nassociating each image with its transmitter. Traditional ML models deal with\nindividual samples, whereas our model allows signals from different users to\ninterfere in order to leverage gains from NOMA under limited bandwidth and\npower constraints. We introduce a progressive fine-tuning algorithm that\ndoubles the number of users at each iteration, maintaining initial performance\nwith orthogonalized user-specific projections, which is then improved through\nfine-tuning steps. Remarkably, our method scales up to 16 users and beyond,\nwith only a 0.6% increase in the number of trainable parameters compared to a\nsingle-user model, significantly enhancing recovered image quality and\noutperforming existing NOMA-based methods over a wide range of datasets,\nmetrics, and channel conditions.

Inspired by meta-learning, this paper proposes a few-shot\nspike sorting (FS-SS) framework with variable network model size that requires\nminimal learning training and supervision. The framework is not only compatible\nwith few-shot adaptations, but also it uses attention mechanism and dilated\nconvolutional neural networks. This allows scaling the network parameters to\nlearn the important features of spike signals and to quickly generalize the\nlearning ability to new spike waveforms in recording channels after few\nobservations. The FS-SS was evaluated by using freely accessible datasets, also\ncompared with the other state-of-the-art algorithms. The average classification\naccuracy of the proposed method is 99.28%, which shows extreme robustness to\nbackground noise and similarity of the spike waveforms. When the number of\ntraining samples is reduced by 90%, the parameter scale is reduced by 68.2%,\nwhile the accuracy only decreased by 0.55%.

However, current approaches encounter challenges\ndue to the inability of point cloud encoders to effectively capture local\ndetails and long-range spatial relationships, as well as a significant modality\ngap between text and point cloud representations. To address these challenges,\nwe present Des4Pos, a novel two-stage text-driven remote sensing localization\nframework. In the coarse stage, the point-cloud encoder utilizes the\nMulti-scale Fusion Attention Mechanism (MFAM) to enhance local geometric\nfeatures, followed by a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) module to\nstrengthen global spatial relationships. Concurrently, the Stepped Text Encoder\n(STE) integrates cross-modal prior knowledge from CLIP [1] and aligns text and\npoint-cloud features using this prior knowledge, effectively bridging modality\ndiscrepancies. In the fine stage, we introduce a Cascaded Residual Attention\n(CRA) module to fuse cross-modal features and predict relative localization\noffsets, thereby achieving greater localization precision. Experiments on the\nKITTI360Pose test set demonstrate that Des4Pos achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance in text-to-point-cloud place recognition.

While traditional cloud-based LLM\nservices satisfy high-accuracy requirements, they fall short in meeting\ncritical demands for low delay and enhanced privacy. To address these\nlimitations, we propose HAT, a novel device-cloud collaborative inference\nframework that leverages the complementary strengths of U-shaped inference and\nspeculative decoding. HAT partitions the LLM into three submodels, and the\ninput and output submodels, stacked with a lightweight adapter network, are\ndeployed as a small language model (SLM) on each end device. Meanwhile, the\nmiddle submodel, encompassing the majority of the LLM's decoder layers, is\nhosted in the cloud to perform speculative decoding with on-device SLMs. During\ninference, HAT exchanges hidden states (rather than raw tokens) of input or\ndraft tokens between devices and the cloud, thereby incurring substantial\ncommunication delays. Besides, processing hidden states of long prompts will\nexacerbate computation delays in the cloud, further compromising inference\nefficiency. To improve efficiency, we introduce a prompt chunking mechanism\nthat segments long prompts into shorter chunks, enabling parallel transmission\nand processing. Furthermore, HAT is implemented to dynamically determine\noptimal chunk sizes for devices handling long prompts, thereby improving\noverall inference speed. Extensive experiments are conducted on a physical\ntestbed comprising 30 NVIDIA Jetson devices and a server with 8 NVIDIA A6000\nGPUs.

    "abstract": "Regularization is a technique to improve generalization of machine learning\n(ML) models. A common form of regularization in the ML literature is to train\non data where similar inputs map to different outputs. This improves\ngeneralization by preventing ML models from becoming overconfident in their\npredictions. This paper shows how using longer timesteps when modelling chaotic\nEarth systems naturally leads to more of this regularization. We show this in\ntwo domains. We explain how using longer model timesteps can improve results\nand demonstrate that increased regularization is one of the causes. We explain\nwhy longer model timesteps lead to improved regularization in these systems and\npresent a procedure to pick the model timestep. We also carry out a\nbenchmarking exercise on ORAS5 ocean reanalysis data to show that a longer\nmodel timestep (28 days) than is typically used gives realistic simulations. We\nsuggest that there will be many opportunities to use this type of\nregularization in Earth system problems because the Earth system is chaotic and\nthe regularization is so easy to implement.",

    "abstract": "Intelligent reflective surface (IRS) technologies help mitigate undesirable\neffects in wireless links by steering the communication signal between\ntransmitters and receivers. IRS elements are configured to adjust the phase of\nthe reflected signal for a user's location and enhance the perceived\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In this way, an IRS improves the communication\nlink but inevitably introduces more communication overhead. This occurs\nespecially in mobile scenarios, where the user's position must be frequently\nestimated to re-adjust the IRS elements periodically. Such an operation\nrequires balancing the amount of training versus the data time slots to\noptimize the communication performance in the link. Aiming to study this\nbalance with the age of information (AoI) framework, we address the question of\nhow often an IRS needs to be updated with the lowest possible overhead and the\nmaximum of freshness of information. We derive the corresponding analytical\nsolution for a mobile scenario, where the transmitter is static and the mobile\nuser (MU) follows a random waypoint mobility model. We provide a closed-form\nexpression for the average peak age of information (PAoI), as a metric to\nevaluate the impact of the IRS update frequency. As for the performance\nevaluation, we consider a realistic scenario following the IEEE 802.11ad\nstandard, targeting the mmWave band. Our results reveal that the minimum\nachievable average PAoI is in the microsecond range and the optimal IRS update\nperiod is in the seconds range, causing 9% overhead in the link when the MU\nmoves at a velocity of 1 m/s.",

In\nthis paper, we aim to shed light on these dynamics using a large language\nmodel-based simulation framework. Our work employs real-world short-video data\ncontaining rich video content information and detailed user-agents to\nrealistically simulate the recommendation-feedback cycle. Through large-scale\nsimulations, we demonstrate that LLMs can replicate real-world user-recommender\ninteractions, uncovering key mechanisms driving filter bubble formation.

To mitigate this, we design and test\ninterventions including various cold-start and feedback weighting strategies,\nshowing measurable reductions in filter bubble effects. Our framework enables\nrapid prototyping of recommendation strategies, offering actionable solutions\nto enhance content diversity in real-world systems. Furthermore, we analyze how\nLLM-inherent biases may propagate through recommendations, proposing safeguards\nto promote equity for vulnerable groups, such as women and low-income\npopulations.

To explore this, we generated six synthetic\ncultural datasets from GSM8K, a widely used benchmark for assessing LLMs'\nmathematical reasoning skills. While preserving the mathematical logic and\nnumerical values of the original GSM8K test set, we modify cultural elements\nsuch as personal names, food items, place names, etc. These culturally adapted\ndatasets provide a more reliable framework for evaluating LLMs' mathematical\nreasoning under shifting cultural contexts. Our findings reveal that LLMs\nstruggle with math problems when cultural references change, even though the\nunderlying mathematical structure remains constant. Smaller models exhibit\ngreater performance drops compared to larger models. Interestingly, our results\nalso suggest that cultural familiarity can enhance mathematical reasoning.

Under steady-state conditions, the depth-based\nFroude number $Fr$ and the angle of attack $\\alpha$ define regions where\ndistinct flow regimes are either locally or globally stable. To map the\nboundary between these stability regions, the parameter space $(\\alpha,Fr)$ was\nsystematically surveyed by increasing $\\alpha$ until the onset of ventilation,\nwhile maintaining a constant $Fr$. Two simplified model hydrofoils were\nexamined: a semi-ogive profile with a blunt trailing edge and a modified NACA\n0010-34. Tests were conducted in a towing tank under quasi-steady-state\nconditions for aspect ratios of $1.0$ and $1.5$, and $Fr$ ranging from $0.5$ to\n$2.5$. Ventilation occurred spontaneously for all test conditions as $\\alpha$\nincreased. Three distinct trigger mechanisms were identified: nose, tail, and\nbase ventilation. Nose ventilation is prevalent at $Fr<1.0$ and $Fr<1.25$ for\naspect ratios of $1.0$ and $1.5$, respectively, and is associated with an\nincrease in the inception angle of attack. Tail ventilation becomes prevalent\nat higher $Fr$, where the inception angle of attack takes a negative trend.\nBase ventilation was observed only for the semi-ogive profile but did not lead\nto the development of a stable ventilated cavity. Notably, the measurements\nindicate that the boundary between bistable and globally stable regions is not\nuniform and extends to significantly higher $\\alpha$ than previously estimated.\nA revised stability map is proposed to reconcile previously published and\ncurrent data, demonstrating how two alternative paths to a steady-state\ncondition can lead to different flow regimes.",

The new samples for the learned stochastic process can\nthen be obtained using the inner product between the output of the generator\nand the basis functions from the trained PI-BasisNet. The sPI-GeM addresses the\nscalability in the spatial space in a similar way as in the widely used\ndimensionality reduction technique, i.e., principal component analysis (PCA).

    "abstract": "Dimensionality reduction is a fundamental task that aims to simplify complex\ndata by reducing its feature dimensionality while preserving essential\npatterns, with core applications in data analysis and visualisation. To\npreserve the underlying data structure, multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) methods\nfocus on preserving pairwise dissimilarities, such as distances. They optimise\nthe embedding to have pairwise distances as close as possible to the data\ndissimilarities. However, the current standard is limited to embedding data in\nRiemannian manifolds. Motivated by the lack of asymmetry in the Riemannian\nmetric of the embedding space, this paper extends the MDS problem to a natural\nasymmetric generalisation of Riemannian manifolds called Finsler manifolds.\nInspired by Euclidean space, we define a canonical Finsler space for embedding\nasymmetric data. Due to its simplicity with respect to geodesics, data\nrepresentation in this space is both intuitive and simple to analyse. We\ndemonstrate that our generalisation benefits from the same theoretical\nconvergence guarantees. We reveal the effectiveness of our Finsler embedding\nacross various types of non-symmetric data, highlighting its value in\napplications such as data visualisation, dimensionality reduction, directed\ngraph embedding, and link prediction.",

We employ an entropy-based\napproach to quantify the dynamic structural resilience of international trade\nnetworks for maize, rice, soybean, and wheat from 1986 to 2022. Using index\ndecomposition analysis, we also investigate the relative contributions of\nseveral internal components to changes in resilience. Within this framework,\ndespite heterogeneity across different food commodities, we find that current\ntrade networks are relatively redundant, with improvements in efficiency being\nthe dominant driver of changes in resilience. In addition, we reveal a\nhistorically pronounced impact of flow concentrations on resilience, while\ntrade interactions have become increasingly important in recent years.\nFurthermore, following the leave-one-out approach, we identify critical\neconomies and trade relationships that disproportionately affect the overall\nresilience, many of which are overlooked by conventional volume-based or\ncentrality-based metrics. Moreover, we highlight that the overconcentration of\nflows along core trade relationships may undermine the overall efficiency and\nresilience, whereas peripheral trade networks play an essential role in\nsustaining resilience, underscoring the importance of promoting more equitable\ntrade relations. These findings not only provide new insights for assessing the\nresilience of international food trade systems but also propose directions for\nmaking them more resilient.",

Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable ability\nin decision-making with comprehensive internal world knowledge, but how it\ncould benefit NAS for STSF remains unexplored.

On the instance-level, we utilize a one-step tuning\nframework to quickly evaluate the architecture instance and a memory bank to\ncumulate knowledge to improve LLM's search ability.

    "abstract": "Complex question-answering (QA) systems face significant challenges in\nretrieving and reasoning over information that addresses multi-faceted queries.\nWhile large language models (LLMs) have advanced the reasoning capabilities of\nthese systems, the bounded-recall problem persists, where procuring all\nrelevant documents in first-stage retrieval remains a challenge. Missing\npertinent documents at this stage leads to performance degradation that cannot\nbe remedied in later stages, especially given the limited context windows of\nLLMs which necessitate high recall at smaller retrieval depths. In this paper,\nwe introduce SUNAR, a novel approach that leverages LLMs to guide a\nNeighborhood Aware Retrieval process. SUNAR iteratively explores a neighborhood\ngraph of documents, dynamically promoting or penalizing documents based on\nuncertainty estimates from interim LLM-generated answer candidates. We validate\nour approach through extensive experiments on two complex QA datasets. Our\nresults show that SUNAR significantly outperforms existing retrieve-and-reason\nbaselines, achieving up to a 31.84% improvement in performance over existing\nstate-of-the-art methods for complex QA.",

    "abstract": "Microorganisms thrive in complex environments and their behavior in fluids\nholds significant importance for various medical and industrial applications.\nBy conducting Lattice Boltzmann simulations, the transport and rotational\nproperties of a generic squirmer are investigated in solutions embedded with\nflexible polymers at different Reynolds numbers. The interplay of activity and\nheterogeneously distributed polymers have profound influences on these\nproperties. Remarkable enhancements of up to three orders of magnitude in the\nrotational motion, along with apparent decays in self-propelling velocities,\nare observed for squirmers with non-zero active stresses. These extraordinary\nphenomena stem from the squirmer-polymer mechanical and hydrodynamic\ninteractions. Specifically, polymer wrapping occurs in front of a pusher, while\nnumerous polymers are absorbed in the rear of a puller. Both mechanisms enhance\nthe rotational motion and simultaneously impede translations through forces and\ntorques arising from direct contacts or asymmetric local flows induced by\npolymers. The source dipole flow fields generated by a neutral swimmer rapidly\nadvect polymers to the rear, leaving no apparent impacts on its rotational and\ntransport properties. The influences of Reynolds number Re and squirmer-polymer\nboundary conditions (no-slip and repulsive) on the dynamics are addressed. In\nshort, the no-slip boundary condition results in more profound effects on both\nrotational and translational properties at Re = 0.8. However, at Re = 0.04, the\ndisparity between the two boundary conditions diminishes due to the heightened\nfluid viscous drag, which impedes direct contacts between squirmers and\npolymers. Our results reveal the relevance of system heterogeneity and\nhighlight the essential role of squirmer-polymer mechanical and hydrodynamic\ninteractions in shaping the behavior of swimmers in viscoelastic fluids.",

However, due to the LLM's\nlimited understanding of the T2I model and its safety filters, existing methods\nrequire numerous queries to achieve a successful attack, limiting their\npractical applicability. To address this issue, we propose Reason2Attack(R2A),\nwhich aims to enhance the LLM's reasoning capabilities in generating\nadversarial prompts by incorporating the jailbreaking attack into the\npost-training process of the LLM.

Subsequently, we\nincorporate the jailbreaking attack task into the reinforcement learning\nprocess of the LLM and design an attack process reward that considers prompt\nlength, prompt stealthiness, and prompt effectiveness, aiming to further\nenhance reasoning accuracy.

    "abstract": "In continual learning (CL), catastrophic forgetting often arises due to\nfeature drift. This challenge is particularly prominent in the exemplar-free\ncontinual learning (EFCL) setting, where samples from previous tasks cannot be\nretained, making it difficult to preserve prior knowledge. To address this\nissue, some EFCL methods aim to identify feature spaces that minimize the\nimpact on previous tasks while accommodating new ones. However, they rely on\nstatic features or outdated statistics stored from old tasks, which prevents\nthem from capturing the dynamic evolution of the feature space in CL, leading\nto performance degradation over time. In this paper, we introduce the\nDrift-Resistant Space (DRS), which effectively handles feature drifts without\nrequiring explicit feature modeling or the storage of previous tasks. A novel\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning approach called Low-Rank Adaptation Subtraction\n(LoRA-) is proposed to develop the DRS. This method subtracts the LoRA weights\nof old tasks from the initial pre-trained weight before processing new task\ndata to establish the DRS for model training. Therefore, LoRA- enhances\nstability, improves efficiency, and simplifies implementation. Furthermore,\nstabilizing feature drifts allows for better plasticity by learning with a\ntriplet loss. Our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art results,\nespecially for long task sequences, across multiple datasets.",

In this work, we study how\nfurther editing texts with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF),\nwhich aligns model outputs with human preferences, affects (a) the quality of\ngenerated texts for two tasks, and (b) the performance of LLM-generated text\ndetectors, looking at both training-based and zero-shot detection methods.\nAlthough RLHF improves the quality of LLM-generated texts, we find that it also\ntends to produce more detectable, lengthy, and repetitive outputs.\nAdditionally, we observe that training-based detectors are vulnerable to short\ntexts and to texts that incorporate code, whereas zero-shot detectors exhibit\ngreater robustness.",

This type of problem was addressed in our\nprevious work [Hw] concerning domains on hypersurfaces of constant mean\ncurvature (CMC) in $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. In this paper, we consider a more\npopular circumstance, where the deforming domains are situated in any smooth\nmanifold $M^{n}$ equipped with an arbitrary self-adjoint strongly elliptic\noperator $L$ (replacing the stability operator for CMC hypersurfaces in\n$\\mathbb R^{n+1}$ [Hw]).\n  We define the concept of quasi-Lipschitz domains by gluing together some\nboundary points of a Lipschitz domain in a specific manner, allowing the\ntopology of the deforming domain $D(t)$ to change. It is established that any\n``appropriate\" monotone $C^{0}$-deformation on $M^{n}$ (see Definition 1.1)\nexhibits Sobolev continuity and eigenvalue continuity of $L$ along $t$. As a\nconsequence, a ``global\" Morse index theorem is obtained.

To\naddress these challenges, some studies have incorporated unsupervised learning\nby leveraging local item contexts within individual sequences. However, these\nmethods often overlook the intricate associations between items across multiple\nsequences and are susceptible to noise in item co-occurrence patterns. In this\ncontext, we introduce a novel framework, Global Unsupervised Data-Augmentation\n(UDA4SR), which adopts a graph contrastive learning perspective to generate\nmore robust item embeddings for sequential recommendation.

Consequently, CodeJailbreaker explores to construct a prompt whose\ninstruction is benign and the malicious intent is implicitly encoded in a\ncovert channel, i.e., the commit message, to bypass the safety mechanism.\nExperiments on the recently-released RMCBench benchmark demonstrate that\nCodeJailbreaker markedly surpasses the conventional jailbreaking strategy,\nwhich explicitly conveys malicious intents in the instructions, in terms of the\nattack effectiveness across three code generation tasks. This study challenges\nthe traditional safety paradigms in LLM-based code generation, emphasizing the\nneed for enhanced safety measures in safeguarding against implicit malicious\ncues.",

This problem is amplified in low-resource\nsettings where data scarcity hinders accurate entity and relationship\nextraction. Contextual retrieval methods, while improving retrieval accuracy,\nstruggle with long documents. They truncate critical information in texts\nexceeding maximum context lengths of LLMs, significantly limiting knowledge\ngraph construction. We introduce SLIDE (Sliding Localized Information for\nDocument Extraction), a chunking method that processes long documents by\ngenerating local context through overlapping windows. SLIDE ensures that\nessential contextual information is retained, enhancing knowledge graph\nextraction from documents exceeding LLM context limits. It significantly\nimproves GraphRAG performance, achieving a 24% increase in entity extraction\nand a 39% improvement in relationship extraction for English. For Afrikaans, a\nlow-resource language, SLIDE achieves a 49% increase in entity extraction and\nan 82% improvement in relationship extraction.

    "abstract": "Cloud-cloud collision (CCC) has been proposed as a mechanism for triggering\nmassive star formation. Observations in the Milky Way and nearby galaxies have\nrevealed the presence of CCCs with collision velocity ($v_{\\rm col}$) of 1-40\nkm/s, and the connection between star formation activity and the properties of\ncolliding clouds has been investigated. In this study, we expand the study to\nmuch faster (~100 km/s) CCCs in a nearby colliding galaxies system, the\nAntennae galaxies. We examine how star formation rate (SFR) on a sub-kpc scale\ndepends on the $v_{\\rm col}$ and mass ($M_{\\rm mol}$) of giant molecular clouds\n(GMCs) across the Antennae galaxies, which show diverse star formation\nactivity. Furthermore, to examine the star formation process at a more\nfundamental level, we also investigate how the star formation efficiency (SFE)\nof a colliding GMC depends on its $v_{\\rm col}$ and $M_{\\rm mol}$. SFR is\ncalculated using H$\\alpha$ and mid-infrared data. From $\\sim2000$ GMCs\nidentified in the CO(1-0) data cube using the ALMA archival data, collision\nvelocities are estimated based on the velocity dispersion among GMCs in a\nsub-kpc scale region, assuming random motion in three-dimensional space. GMCs\nare considered to be colliding at a velocity of ~10-150 km/s. We find that\nregions where high-speed collisions ($v_{\\rm col}$~100 km/s) of massive\n($M_{\\rm mol}$~$10^{7-8}$ $M_\\odot$) GMCs are seen show the highest surface\ndensity of SFR. Particularly, in the region with $v_{\\rm col}$~100 km/s, we\nfind that SFR on a sub-kpc scale increases with increasing $M_{\\rm mol}$ in the\nrange of ~$10^{6}$-$10^{8}$ $M_\\odot$. The SFE of a colliding cloud is\nestimated to be 0.1%-3.0% without clear $M_{\\rm mol}$ dependence, and the SFE\nis the lowest at the $v_{\\rm col}$~100-150 km/s. These results suggest that the\nmost active star formation in the Antennae galaxies seems to occur due to large\nGMC mass.",

In this paper, we aim to study when we need\nmulti-turn interactions with LLMs to successfully get a question answered; or\nconclude that a question is unanswerable. We present a neural symbolic\nframework that models the interactions between human and LLM agents.

The technique proposed in this work utilizes the\nassumption that a dynamic PET scan can be modeled by the Patlak plot to\ndetermine an unscaled blood input function. Materials and Methods: The time\nactivity curve (TAC) for each voxel in a dynamic image can be considered as an\nn-dimensional vector. In this context, a TAC follows the Patlak plot if and\nonly if the TAC is a linear combination of the blood input function and the\nintegral of the blood input function. Given a set of TACs which follow the\nPatlak plot, we can thus use PCA to determine a basis which spans the same\nvector space as the blood input function and the integral of the blood input\nfunction. We then seek to find two TACs in this vector space which best satisfy\nthat the estimated anti-derivative of one of the TACs is close to the other\nTAC; such TACs are candidates for the blood input function and the integral of\nthe blood input function. We were able to construct a low (2) dimensional\noptimization problem to find such TACs. Results: We applied our results to\nobtain predicted blood input functions and Ki maps for twelve normal subjects.\nScaling the predicted blood input function to best match the ground truth, we\nachieved an average SSE of $0.042 \\pm 0.032$ and an average DTW distance of\n$0.141 \\pm 0.053$. Matching the means of the predicted and ground truth Ki\nmaps, we achieved an average MAPE of $2.539 \\pm 0.928$ and an average SSIM of\n$0.991 \\pm 0.005$. Conclusion: While not often viewed as such, the assumption\nthat some dynamic data follows a kinetic model gives strong prior information.\nIn the case of the Patlak plot, we can use this assumption to estimate an\nunscaled blood input function and unscaled Ki map.",

To this end, we introduce a parameter $\\epsilon(f)$\nfor a bounded measurable function $f$, which determines the exponent term of\nthe decay rate for the first moment of the fluctuation. Qualitatively, the\nsecond-order behaviour of $\\langle f,X_{t}\\rangle$ depends on the sign of\n$\\epsilon(f)-\\lambda_{1}/2$. We prove that, for a suitable test function $f$,\nthe fluctuation of the associated linear functional exhibits distinct\nasymptotic behaviours depending on the magnitude of $\\epsilon(f)$: If\n$\\epsilon(f)\\ge \\lambda_{1}/2$, the fluctuation converges in distribution to a\nGaussian limit under appropriate normalization; If $\\epsilon(f)<\\lambda_{1}/2$,\nthe fluctuation converges to an $L^{2}$ limit with a larger normalization\nfactor. In particular, when the test function is chosen as the right\neigenfunction $\\varphi$, we establish a functional central limit theorem.

Here, we use JWST + HST observations of the\nnearby spiral galaxy NGC 628 to produce spectral energy distribution (SED)\ntemplates of compact star clusters spanning 275 nm through 21 {\\mu}m. These\npreliminary SEDs capture the cluster stars and associated gas and dust within\nradii of 0.12\" to 0.67\" (corresponding to 6 to 33 pc at the distance of NGC\n628). One important finding is that the SEDs of 1, 2, 3, and 4 Myr clusters can\nbe differentiated in the infrared. Another is that in 80-90% of the cases we\nstudy, the PAH and H_alpha emission track one another, with the dust\nresponsible for the 3.3 {\\mu}m PAH emission largely removed by 4 Myr,\nconsistent with pre-supernova stellar feedback acting quickly on the\nsurrounding gas and dust. Nearly-embedded cluster candidates have infrared SEDs\nwhich are quite similar to optically visible 1 to 3 Myr clusters. In nearly all\ncases we find there is a young star cluster within a few tenths of an arcsec\n(10 - 30 pc) of the nearly embedded cluster, suggesting the formation of the\ncluster was triggered by its presence.

This study develops a\ngeneral equilibrium model that incorporates occupational choices, endogenous\nlabor supply, highlighting that the impact on the retirement decision is\namplified by the presence of assets and pensions.

    "abstract": "Approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) is a fundamental problem in vector\ndatabases and AI infrastructures. Recent graph-based ANNS algorithms have\nachieved high search accuracy with practical efficiency. Despite the\nadvancements, these algorithms still face performance bottlenecks in\nproduction, due to the random memory access patterns of graph-based search and\nthe high computational overheads of vector distance. In addition, the\nperformance of a graph-based ANNS algorithm is highly sensitive to parameters,\nwhile selecting the optimal parameters is cost-prohibitive, e.g., manual tuning\nrequires repeatedly re-building the index. This paper introduces VSAG, an\nopen-source framework that aims to enhance the in production performance of\ngraph-based ANNS algorithms. VSAG has been deployed at scale in the services of\nAnt Group, and it incorporates three key optimizations: (i) efficient memory\naccess: it reduces L3 cache misses with pre-fetching and cache-friendly vector\norganization; (ii) automated parameter tuning: it automatically selects\nperformance-optimal parameters without requiring index rebuilding; (iii)\nefficient distance computation: it leverages modern hardware, scalar\nquantization, and smartly switches to low-precision representation to\ndramatically reduce the distance computation costs. We evaluate VSAG on\nreal-world datasets. The experimental results show that VSAG achieves the\nstate-of-the-art performance and provides up to 4x speedup over HNSWlib (an\nindustry-standard library) while ensuring the same accuracy.",

This study systematically examines the influence of cybersecurity\nthreats on digital banking security, adoption, and regulatory compliance by\nconducting a comprehensive review of 78 peer-reviewed articles published\nbetween 2015 and 2024. Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic\nReviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology, this research critically\nevaluates the most prevalent cyber threats targeting digital banking platforms,\nthe effectiveness of modern security measures, and the role of regulatory\nframeworks in mitigating financial cybersecurity risks. The findings reveal\nthat phishing and malware attacks remain the most commonly exploited cyber\nthreats, leading to significant financial losses and consumer distrust.\nMulti-factor authentication (MFA) and biometric security have been widely\nadopted to combat unauthorized access, while AI-driven fraud detection and\nblockchain technology offer promising solutions for securing financial\ntransactions. However, the integration of third-party FinTech solutions\nintroduces additional security risks, necessitating stringent regulatory\noversight and cybersecurity protocols.

Drawing from the success of Contrastive Learning (CL) in other domains,\na consensus has been reached that the effectiveness of GCLs depends on a large\nnumber of negative pairs. As a result, despite the significant computational\noverhead, GCLs typically leverage as many negative node pairs as possible to\nimprove model performance. However, given that nodes within a graph are\ninterconnected, we argue that nodes cannot be treated as independent instances.\nTherefore, we challenge this consensus: Does employing more negative nodes lead\nto a more effective GCL model? To answer this, we explore the role of negative\nnodes in the commonly used InfoNCE loss for GCL and observe that: (1)\nCounterintuitively, a large number of negative nodes can actually hinder the\nmodel's ability to distinguish nodes with different semantics. (2) A smaller\nnumber of high-quality and non-topologically coupled negative nodes are\nsufficient to enhance the discriminability of representations.

    "abstract": "Despite recent success in applying large language models (LLMs) to electronic\nhealth records (EHR), most systems focus primarily on assessment rather than\ntreatment planning. We identify three critical limitations in current\napproaches: they generate treatment plans in a single pass rather than\nfollowing the sequential reasoning process used by clinicians; they rarely\nincorporate patient-specific historical context; and they fail to effectively\ndistinguish between subjective and objective clinical information. Motivated by\nthe SOAP methodology (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan), we introduce\n\\ours{}, a novel framework that structures LLM reasoning to align with\nreal-life clinician workflows. Our approach employs a two-stage architecture\nthat first generates a clinical assessment based on patient symptoms and\nobjective data, then formulates a structured treatment plan informed by this\nassessment and enriched with patient-specific information through\nretrieval-augmented generation. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that our\nmethod significantly outperforms baseline approaches in both assessment\naccuracy and treatment plan quality.",

    "abstract": "Almost equitable partitions (AEPs) have been linked to cluster\nsynchronization in oscillatory systems, highlighting the importance of\nstructure in collective network dynamics. We provide a general spectral\nframework that formalizes this connection, showing how eigenvectors associated\nwith AEPs span a subspace of the Laplacian spectrum that governs\npartition-induced synchronization behavior. This offers a principled reduction\nof network dynamics, allowing clustered states to be understood in terms of\nquotient graph projections. Our approach clarifies the conditions under which\ntransient hierarchical clustering and multi-frequency synchronization emerge,\nand connects these dynamical phenomena directly to network symmetry and\ncommunity structure. In doing so, we bridge a critical gap between static\ntopology and dynamic behavior-namely, the lack of a spectral method for\nanalyzing synchronization in networks that exhibit exact or approximate\nstructural regularity. Perfect AEPs are rare in real-world networks since most\nhave some degree of irregularity or noise. We define a relaxation of an AEP we\ncall a quasi-equitable partition at level $\\delta$ ($\\delta-$QEP).\n$\\delta-$QEPs can preserve many of the clustering-relevant properties of AEPs\nwhile tolerating structural imperfections and noise. This extension enables us\nto describe synchronization behavior in more realistic scenarios, where ideal\nsymmetries are rarely present.

Attackers leverage RowHammer bitflips in real systems\nto take over systems and leak data. Consequently, many prior works propose\nmitigations, including recent DDR specifications introducing new mitigations\n(e.g., PRAC and RFM). For robust operation, it is critical to analyze other\nsecurity implications of RowHammer mitigations. Unfortunately, no prior work\nanalyzes the timing covert and side channel vulnerabilities introduced by\nRowHammer mitigations.\n  This paper presents the first analysis and evaluation of timing covert and\nside channel vulnerabilities introduced by state-of-the-art RowHammer\nmitigations. We demonstrate that RowHammer mitigations' preventive actions have\ntwo fundamental features that enable timing channels. First, preventive actions\nreduce DRAM bandwidth availability, resulting in longer memory latencies.\nSecond, preventive actions can be triggered on demand depending on memory\naccess patterns.\n  We introduce LeakyHammer, a new class of attacks that leverage the RowHammer\nmitigation-induced memory latency differences to establish communication\nchannels and leak secrets. First, we build two covert channel attacks\nexploiting two state-of-the-art RowHammer mitigations, achieving 38.6 Kbps and\n48.6 Kbps channel capacity. Second, we demonstrate a website fingerprinting\nattack that identifies visited websites based on the RowHammer-preventive\nactions they cause. We propose and evaluate two countermeasures against\nLeakyHammer and show that fundamentally mitigating LeakyHammer induces large\noverheads in highly RowHammer-vulnerable systems.

    "abstract": "Current closed-loop insulin delivery algorithms need to be informed of\ncarbohydrate intake disturbances. This can be a burden on people using these\nsystems. Pramlintide is a hormone that delays gastric emptying, which enables\ninsulin kinetics to align with the kinetics of carbohydrate absorption.\nIntegrating pramlintide into an automated insulin delivery system can be\nhelpful in reducing the postprandial glucose excursion and may be helpful in\nenabling fully-closed loop whereby meals do not need to be announced. We\npresent an AI-enabled dual-hormone model predictive control (MPC) algorithm\nthat delivers insulin and pramlintide without requiring meal announcements that\nuses a neural network to automatically detect and deliver meal insulin. The MPC\nalgorithm includes a new pramlintide pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics\nmodel that was identified using data collected from people with type 1 diabetes\nundergoing a meal challenge. Using a simulator, we evaluated the performance of\nvarious pramlintide delivery methods and controller models, as well as the\nbaseline insulin-only scenario. Meals were automatically dosed using a neural\nnetwork meal detection and dosing (MDD) algorithm. The primary outcome was the\npercent time glucose is in the target range (TIR: 70-180 mg/dL). Results show\nthat delivering pramlintide at a fixed ratio of 6 mcg pramlintide:1 u insulin\nusing an MPC that is aware of the pramlintide achieved the most significant\nimproved TIR compared with an insulin-only MPC (91.6% vs. 64.1%). Delivering\npramlintide as a fixed ratio was better than delivering basal pramlintide at a\nconstant rate, indicating the benefit of the MDD algorithm. There was no\nadvantage of independent control of insulin and pramlintide compared with\ninsulin and pramlintide delivered as a fixed ratio. Preliminary real-world\nresults from a human subject further indicate the benefit of pramlintide\ndelivery.",

    "abstract": "Despite the tremendous success of automatic speech recognition (ASR) with the\nintroduction of deep learning, its performance is still unsatisfactory in many\nreal-world multi-talker scenarios. Speaker separation excels in separating\nindividual talkers but, as a frontend, it introduces processing artifacts that\ndegrade the ASR backend trained on clean speech. As a result, mainstream robust\nASR systems train the backend on noisy speech to avoid processing artifacts. In\nthis work, we propose to decouple the training of the speaker separation\nfrontend and the ASR backend, with the latter trained on clean speech only. Our\ndecoupled system achieves 5.1% word error rates (WER) on the Libri2Mix dev/test\nsets, significantly outperforming other multi-talker ASR baselines. Its\neffectiveness is also demonstrated with the state-of-the-art 7.60%/5.74% WERs\non 1-ch and 6-ch SMS-WSJ. Furthermore, on recorded LibriCSS, we achieve the\nspeaker-attributed WER of 2.92%. These state-of-the-art results suggest that\ndecoupling speaker separation and recognition is an effective approach to\nelevate robust multi-talker ASR.",
