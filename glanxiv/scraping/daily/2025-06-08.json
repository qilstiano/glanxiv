    "abstract": "Asynchronous Federated Learning (AFL) enables distributed model training\nacross multiple mobile devices, allowing each device to independently update\nits local model without waiting for others. However, device mobility introduces\nintermittent connectivity, which necessitates gradient sparsification and leads\nto model staleness, jointly affecting AFL convergence. This paper develops a\ntheoretical model to characterize the interplay among sparsification, model\nstaleness and mobility-induced contact patterns, and their joint impact on AFL\nconvergence. Based on the analysis, we propose a mobility-aware dynamic\nsparsification (MADS) algorithm that optimizes the sparsification degree based\non contact time and model staleness. Closed-form solutions are derived, showing\nthat under low-speed conditions, MADS increases the sparsification degree to\nenhance convergence, while under high-speed conditions, it reduces the\nsparsification degree to guarantee reliable uploads within limited contact\ntime. Experimental results validate the theoretical findings. Compared with the\nstate-of-the-art benchmarks, the MADS algorithm increases the image\nclassification accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset by 8.76% and reduces the\naverage displacement error in the Argoverse trajectory prediction dataset by\n9.46%.",

    "abstract": "Saliency methods are widely used to visualize which input features are deemed\nrelevant to a model's prediction. However, their visual plausibility can\nobscure critical limitations. In this work, we propose a diagnostic test for\nclass sensitivity: a method's ability to distinguish between competing class\nlabels on the same input. Through extensive experiments, we show that many\nwidely used saliency methods produce nearly identical explanations regardless\nof the class label, calling into question their reliability. We find that\nclass-insensitive behavior persists across architectures and datasets,\nsuggesting the failure mode is structural rather than model-specific. Motivated\nby these findings, we introduce CASE, a contrastive explanation method that\nisolates features uniquely discriminative for the predicted class. We evaluate\nCASE using the proposed diagnostic and a perturbation-based fidelity test, and\nshow that it produces faithful and more class-specific explanations than\nexisting methods.",

Significant attention has focused on using reward\nmodels as a means for fine-tuning generative models. However, the reward models\nthemselves -- which directly encode human value judgments by turning\nprompt-response pairs into scalar rewards -- remain relatively understudied. We\npresent a novel approach to reward model interpretability through exhaustive\nanalysis of their responses across their entire vocabulary space. By examining\nhow different reward models score every possible single-token response to\nvalue-laden prompts, we uncover several striking findings: (i) substantial\nheterogeneity between models trained on similar objectives, (ii) systematic\nasymmetries in how models encode high- vs low-scoring tokens, (iii) significant\nsensitivity to prompt framing that mirrors human cognitive biases, and (iv)\novervaluation of more frequent tokens. We demonstrate these effects across ten\nrecent open-source reward models of varying parameter counts and architectures.\nOur results challenge assumptions about the interchangeability of reward\nmodels, as well as their suitability as proxies of complex and\ncontext-dependent human values. We find that these models can encode concerning\nbiases toward certain identity groups, which may emerge as unintended\nconsequences of harmlessness training -- distortions that risk propagating\nthrough the downstream large language models now deployed to millions.",

Our problem formulation results in an MPPI subject to multiple\nstate and control-dependent equality constraints which are non-trivial to\nsatisfy with randomly sampled control inputs.

Results show that the assimilation system successfully integrates\ngeostationary NO2 observations, improves model performance in the column, and\ncaptures diurnal variability.

    "abstract": "We introduce AllTracker: a model that estimates long-range point tracks by\nway of estimating the flow field between a query frame and every other frame of\na video. Unlike existing point tracking methods, our approach delivers\nhigh-resolution and dense (all-pixel) correspondence fields, which can be\nvisualized as flow maps. Unlike existing optical flow methods, our approach\ncorresponds one frame to hundreds of subsequent frames, rather than just the\nnext frame. We develop a new architecture for this task, blending techniques\nfrom existing work in optical flow and point tracking: the model performs\niterative inference on low-resolution grids of correspondence estimates,\npropagating information spatially via 2D convolution layers, and propagating\ninformation temporally via pixel-aligned attention layers. The model is fast\nand parameter-efficient (16 million parameters), and delivers state-of-the-art\npoint tracking accuracy at high resolution (i.e., tracking 768x1024 pixels, on\na 40G GPU). A benefit of our design is that we can train jointly on optical\nflow datasets and point tracking datasets, and we find that doing so is crucial\nfor top performance. We provide an extensive ablation study on our architecture\ndetails and training recipe, making it clear which details matter most.

In this paper we present a fine-tuning strategy that we\ncall ConfQA, which can reduce hallucination rate from 20-40% to under 5% across\nmultiple factuality benchmarks. The core idea is simple: when the LLM answers a\nquestion correctly, it is trained to continue with the answer; otherwise, it is\ntrained to admit \"I am unsure\". But there are two key factors that make the\ntraining highly effective. First, we introduce a dampening prompt \"answer only\nif you are confident\" to explicitly guide the behavior, without which\nhallucination remains high as 15%-25%. Second, we leverage simple factual\nstatements, specifically attribute values from knowledge graphs, to help LLMs\ncalibrate the confidence, resulting in robust generalization across domains and\nquestion types. Building on this insight, we propose the Dual Neural Knowledge\nframework, which seamlessly select between internally parameterized neural\nknowledge and externally recorded symbolic knowledge based on ConfQA's\nconfidence. The framework enables potential accuracy gains to beyond 95%, while\nreducing unnecessary external retrievals by over 30%.",

We focus on the topological classification of\nphase portraits, the characterization of global centers, and the absence of\nlimit cycles for $\\alpha\\neq0$. For the linear case ($m = 1$), we establish\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for the origin to be a global center,\nshowing that this occurs if, and only if, $\\alpha = 0$ and $\\epsilon + \\sigma >\n0$. For the nonlinear case ($m > 1$), we prove that the origin is a global\ncenter if, and only if, $m$ is odd, $\\sigma, \\epsilon > 0$, $\\alpha = 0$.\nAdditionally, we classify the global phase portraits for every $m$,\ndemonstrating the rich dynamical behavior of the system and detect homoclinic,\nheteroclinic and double-homoclinic cycles for $\\alpha=0$. Using the\nBendixson-Dulac criterion, we rule out the existence of limit cycles for\n$\\alpha\\neq 0$, further clarifying the behavior of the system. Our results\nresolve the center-focus problem for the degenerate case $\\alpha = 0$ and\nprovide a complete characterization of global centers for generalized Duffing\noscillators of odd degrees.

    "abstract": "The sampling temperature, a critical hyperparameter in large language models\n(LLMs), modifies the logits before the softmax layer, thereby reshaping the\ndistribution of output tokens. Recent studies have challenged the Stochastic\nParrots analogy by demonstrating that LLMs are capable of understanding\nsemantics rather than merely memorizing data and that randomness, modulated by\nsampling temperature, plays a crucial role in model inference. In this study,\nwe systematically evaluated the impact of temperature in the range of 0 to 2 on\ndata sets designed to assess six different capabilities, conducting statistical\nanalyses on open source models of three different sizes: small (1B--4B), medium\n(6B--13B), and large (40B--80B). Our findings reveal distinct skill-specific\neffects of temperature on model performance, highlighting the complexity of\noptimal temperature selection in practical applications. To address this\nchallenge, we propose a BERT-based temperature selector that takes advantage of\nthese observed effects to identify the optimal temperature for a given prompt.\nWe demonstrate that this approach can significantly improve the performance of\nsmall and medium models in the SuperGLUE datasets. Furthermore, our study\nextends to FP16 precision inference, revealing that temperature effects are\nconsistent with those observed in 4-bit quantized models. By evaluating\ntemperature effects up to 4.0 in three quantized models, we find that the\nMutation Temperature -- the point at which significant performance changes\noccur -- increases with model size.",

Much of the more recent works\nexplore theoretical aspects of this new acceleration framework, connecting it\nto existing methods and order-optimal convergence rates from the literature.\nHowever, in practice introducing stochastic oracles allows for more\ncomputational efficiency given the size of many modern optimization problems.\nTo this end, this work provides the moving anchor variants [1] of the original\nanchoring algorithms [36] with stochastic implementations and robust analyses\nto bridge the gap from deterministic to stochastic algorithm settings. In\nparticular, we demonstrate that an accelerated convergence rate theory for\nstochastic oracles also exists for our moving anchor scheme, itself a\ngeneralization of the original fixed anchor algorithms, and provide numerical\nresults that validate our theoretical findings.

More specifically, we focus on \"adultification bias,\" a\nphenomenon in which Black girls are presumed to be more defiant, sexually\nintimate, and culpable than their White peers. Advances in alignment techniques\nshow promise towards mitigating biases but vary in their coverage and\neffectiveness across models and bias types.

We find that LLMs\nexhibit explicit and implicit adultification bias against Black girls,\nassigning them harsher, more sexualized consequences in comparison to their\nWhite peers. Additionally, we find that T2I models depict Black girls as older\nand wearing more revealing clothing than their White counterparts, illustrating\nhow adultification bias persists across modalities. We make three key\ncontributions: (1) we measure a new form of bias in generative AI models, (2)\nwe systematically study adultification bias across modalities, and (3) our\nfindings emphasize that current alignment methods are insufficient for\ncomprehensively addressing bias.

This study quantifies how LLM\nlabeling errors impact downstream diagnostic model evaluation. We developed a\nsimulation framework to assess how LLM label errors affect observed model\nperformance. A synthetic dataset of 10,000 cases was generated across different\nprevalence levels. LLM sensitivity and specificity were varied independently\nbetween 90% and 100%. We simulated diagnostic models with true sensitivity and\nspecificity ranging from 90% to 100%. Observed performance was computed using\nLLM-generated labels as the reference. We derived analytical performance bounds\nand ran 5,000 Monte Carlo trials per condition to estimate empirical\nuncertainty. Observed performance was highly sensitive to LLM label quality,\nwith bias strongly influenced by disease prevalence. In low-prevalence\nsettings, small reductions in LLM specificity led to substantial\nunderestimation of sensitivity. For example, at 10% prevalence, an LLM with 95%\nspecificity yielded an observed sensitivity of ~53% despite a perfect model. In\nhigh-prevalence scenarios, reduced LLM sensitivity caused underestimation of\nmodel specificity. Monte Carlo simulations consistently revealed downward bias,\nwith observed performance often falling below true values even when within\ntheoretical bounds. LLM-generated labels can introduce systematic,\nprevalence-dependent bias into model evaluation. Specificity is more critical\nin low-prevalence tasks, while sensitivity dominates in high-prevalence\nsettings.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities in question\nanswering and reasoning thanks to their extensive parametric memory.

Updating this knowledge\ntypically requires costly and brittle re-training, or in-context learning\n(ICL), which becomes impractical at scale given the volume and volatility of\nmodern information. Motivated by these limitations, we investigate how LLMs\nperform when exposed to temporal text corpora, or documents that reflect\nevolving knowledge over time, such as sports biographies where facts like a\nplayer's \"current team\" change year by year. To this end, we introduce two new\nbenchmarks: Temporal Wiki, which captures factual drift across historical\nWikipedia snapshots, and Unified Clark, which aggregates timestamped news\narticles to simulate real-world information accumulation. Our analysis reveals\nthat LLMs often struggle to reconcile conflicting or outdated facts and can be\nmisled when multiple versions of a fact appear in context. To address these\nissues, we propose a lightweight, agentic framework that incrementally builds a\nstructured, external memory from source documents without requiring\nre-training. This knowledge organization strategy enables models to retrieve\nand reason over temporally filtered, relevant information at inference time.\nEmpirically, our method outperforms ICL and RAG baselines across both\nbenchmarks, especially on questions requiring more complex reasoning or\nintegration of conflicting facts.",

    "abstract": "Model counting is a fundamental problem that consists of determining the\nnumber of satisfying assignments for a given Boolean formula. The weighted\nvariant, which computes the weighted sum of satisfying assignments, has\nextensive applications in probabilistic reasoning, network reliability,\nstatistical physics, and formal verification. A common approach for solving\nweighted model counting is to reduce it to unweighted model counting, which\nraises an important question: {\\em What is the minimum number of terms (or\nclauses) required to construct a DNF (or CNF) formula with exactly $k$\nsatisfying assignments?}\n  In this paper, we establish both upper and lower bounds on this question. We\nprove that for any natural number $k$, one can construct a monotone DNF formula\nwith exactly $k$ satisfying assignments using at most $O(\\sqrt{\\log k}\\log\\log\nk)$ terms. This construction represents the first $o(\\log k)$ upper bound for\nthis problem. We complement this result by showing that there exist infinitely\nmany values of $k$ for which any DNF or CNF representation requires at least\n$\\Omega(\\log\\log k)$ terms or clauses. These results have significant\nimplications for the efficiency of model counting algorithms based on formula\ntransformations.",

Building on previous work using\nhigh-accuracy spectrally-sparse time of arrival (ToA) waveforms and a\nmulti-step ToA refinement process, a high-accuracy two-way time transfer\n(TWTT)-based timefrequency coordination approach is demonstrated. Due to the\ntwo-way nature of the high-accuracy TWTT approach, the time and frequency\nestimates are Doppler and multi-path tolerant, so long as the channel is\nreciprocal over the synchronization epoch. This technique is experimentally\nverified using COTS SDRs in a lab environment in static and dynamic scenarios\nand with significant multipath scatterers. Time, frequency, and phase stability\nwere evaluated by beamforming over coaxial cables to an oscilloscope which\nachieved time and phase precisions of ~60 ps-70 ps, with median coherent gains\nabove 99 % using optimized coordination parameters, and a beamforming frequency\nroot-mean-square error (RMSE) of 3.73 ppb in a dynamic scenario.

Our analysis demonstrates that these BPU\nfeatures, while designed to enhance speculative execution efficiency through\nmore accurate branch histories, can also introduce significant security risks.\nWe show that these features can inadvertently modify the Branch History Buffer\n(BHB) update behavior and create new primitives that trigger malicious\nmis-speculations.\n  This discovery exposes previously unknown cross-privilege attack surfaces for\nBranch History Injection (BHI).

    "abstract": "Policy tree search is a family of tree search algorithms that use a policy to\nguide the search. These algorithms provide guarantees on the number of\nexpansions required to solve a given problem that are based on the quality of\nthe policy. While these algorithms have shown promising results, the process in\nwhich they are trained requires complete solution trajectories to train the\npolicy. Search trajectories are obtained during a trial-and-error search\nprocess. When the training problem instances are hard, learning can be\nprohibitively costly, especially when starting from a randomly initialized\npolicy. As a result, search samples are wasted in failed attempts to solve\nthese hard instances. This paper introduces a novel method for learning\nsubgoal-based policies for policy tree search algorithms. The subgoals and\npolicies conditioned on subgoals are learned from the trees that the search\nexpands while attempting to solve problems, including the search trees of\nfailed attempts. We empirically show that our policy formulation and training\nmethod improve the sample efficiency of learning a policy and heuristic\nfunction in this online setting.",

Building on the Shampoo family of algorithms, we identify and\nalleviate three key issues, resulting in the proposed SPlus method. First, we\nfind that naive Shampoo is prone to divergence when matrix-inverses are cached\nfor long periods. We introduce an alternate bounded update combining a\nhistorical eigenbasis with instantaneous normalization, resulting in\nacross-the-board stability and significantly lower computational requirements.\nSecond, we adapt a shape-aware scaling to enable learning rate transfer across\nnetwork width. Third, we find that high learning rates result in large\nparameter noise, and propose a simple iterate-averaging scheme which unblocks\nfaster learning. To properly confirm these findings, we introduce a pointed\nTransformer training benchmark, considering three objectives (language\nmodelling, image classification, and diffusion modelling) across different\nstages of training.

Current state-of-the-art RNNs use integrating\nor spiking neurons -- two classes of computing units whose outputs depend\ndirectly on their internal states -- and accordingly there is a wealth of\nliterature characterizing the behavior of large networks built from these\nneurons. On the other hand, past research on differentiating neurons, whose\noutputs are computed from the derivatives of their internal states, remains\nlimited to small hand-designed networks with fewer than one-hundred neurons.\nHere we show via numerical simulation that large lattices of differentiating\nneuron rings exhibit local neural synchronization behavior found in the\nKuramoto model of interacting oscillators. We begin by characterizing the\nperiodic orbits of uncoupled rings, herein called ring oscillators. We then\nshow the emergence of local correlations between oscillators that grow over\ntime when these rings are coupled together into lattices. As the correlation\nlength grows, transient dynamics arise in which large regions of the lattice\nsettle to the same periodic orbit, and thin domain boundaries separate\nadjacent, out-of-phase regions. The steady-state scale of these correlated\nregions depends on how the neurons are shared between adjacent rings, which\nsuggests that lattices of differentiating ring oscillator might be tuned to be\nused as reservoir computers. Coupled with their simple circuit design and\npotential for low-power consumption, differentiating neural nets therefore\nrepresent a promising substrate for neuromorphic computing that will enable\nlow-power AI applications.",

A series of collision algorithms, known as the\nBernoulli-trials (BT) family schemes, have been proposed based on the Kac\nstochastic equation. The impetus of this paper is to present a comprehensive\nevaluation of different BT-based collision partner selection schemes, including\nthe simplified Bernoulli-trials (SBT), generalized Bernoulli-trials (GBT),\nsymmetrized and simplified Bernoulli-trials (SSBT), and newly proposed\nsymmetrized and generalized Bernoulli-trials (SGBT), in treating some standard\nrarefied gas dynamics problems. In these algorithms, the first particle is\nchosen in a specific order from the list of particles in the cell. For the SBT\nand GBT, the second particle is chosen from the remaining particles in the list\nplaced after the first particle; however, for SSBT and SGBT, the second\nparticle is chosen from all particles in the list. This means that the SBT and\nGBT select pairs from the upper triangle of the collision probability matrix,\nwhile symmetrized algorithms such as SSBT and SGBT utilize the entire matrix.\nThe results show that the BT-based collision algorithms, compared to the\nstandard \"No Time Counter (NTC)\" and \"Nearest Neighbor (NN)\", successfully\nmaintain the collision frequency as the number of particles per cell decreases.\nSimulation of the Bobylev-Krook-Wu (BKW) exact solution of the Boltzmann\nequation indicates that, like the GBT, the SGBT algorithm produces the same\nresults as the theory for the average of the 4th moment of the velocity\ndistribution function (VDF).",

    "abstract": "Recently, techniques such as explicit structured reasoning have demonstrated\nstrong test-time scaling behavior by enforcing a separation between the model's\ninternal \"thinking\" process and the final response. A key factor influencing\nanswer quality in this setting is the length of the thinking stage. When the\nreasoning is too short, the model may fail to capture the complexity of the\ntask. Conversely, when it is too long, the model may overthink, leading to\nunnecessary computation and degraded performance. This paper explores and\nexploits the underlying mechanisms by which LLMs understand and regulate the\nlength of their reasoning during explicit thought processes. First, we show\nthat LLMs encode their progress through the reasoning process and introduce an\ninteractive progress bar visualization, which is then used to reveal insights\non the model's planning dynamics. Second, we manipulate the internal progress\nencoding during inference to reduce unnecessary steps and generate a more\nconcise and decisive chain of thoughts. Our empirical results demonstrate that\nthis \"overclocking\" method mitigates overthinking, improves answer accuracy,\nand reduces inference latency. Our code is publicly available.",

To this end, VeriLoC leverages\nrecent Verilog code-generation LLMs to extract local line-level and\nmodule-level embeddings, and train downstream classifiers/regressors on\nconcatenations of these embeddings. VeriLoC achieves high F1-scores of\n0.86-0.95 for line-level congestion and timing prediction, and reduces the mean\naverage percentage error from 14% - 18% for SOTA methods down to only 4%.

However, most MLLMs adopt a static\ninference paradigm, encoding the entire image into fixed visual tokens upfront,\nwhich limits their ability to iteratively refine understanding or adapt to\ncontext during inference. This contrasts sharply with human perception, which\nis dynamic, selective, and feedback-driven. In this work, we introduce a novel\nframework for inference-time visual token scaling that enables MLLMs to perform\niterative, verifier-guided reasoning over visual content. We formulate the\nproblem as a Markov Decision Process, involving a reasoner that proposes visual\nactions and a verifier, which is trained via multi-step Direct Preference\nOptimization (DPO), that evaluates these actions and determines when reasoning\nshould terminate. To support this, we present a new dataset, VTS, comprising\nsupervised reasoning trajectories (VTS-SFT) and preference-labeled reasoning\ncomparisons (VTS-DPO). Our method significantly outperforms existing approaches\nacross diverse visual reasoning benchmarks, offering not only improved accuracy\nbut also more interpretable and grounded reasoning processes.

We attribute this to\nlimitations in both training data and learning objectives. To address these\nissues, we propose a controlled data generation pipeline that produces\nminimally edited image pairs with semantically aligned captions. Using this\npipeline, we construct the Micro Edit Dataset (MED), containing over 50K\nimage-text pairs spanning 11 fine-grained edit categories, including attribute,\ncount, position, and object presence changes. Building on MED, we introduce a\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) framework with a feature-level consistency loss\nthat promotes stable visual embeddings under small edits. We evaluate our\napproach on the Micro Edit Detection benchmark, which includes carefully\nbalanced evaluation pairs designed to test sensitivity to subtle visual\nvariations across the same edit categories. Our method improves difference\ndetection accuracy and reduces hallucinations compared to strong baselines,\nincluding GPT-4o. Moreover, it yields consistent gains on standard\nvision-language tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering.\nThese results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining targeted data and\nalignment objectives for enhancing fine-grained visual reasoning in MLLMs.",

However, navigating instruments--catheters and\nendoscopes--through anatomical pathways creates frictional interactions with\nluminal walls, risking complications such as perforation, poor haptic feedback,\nand instrument buckling. In this paper, we present a new approach to actively\nlubricate transluminal instruments and dynamically reduce friction with\nsurrounding tissues. This approach employs ultrasonic vibrations, at the\ninstrument surface, to generate a pressurized fluid layer at the contact\ninterface, lubricating the interface and thereby reducing friction. We\nimplemented this approach in a prototype catheter, which we validated under dry\nand liquid-lubricated conditions, across rigid and soft interfaces, and along\nvaried anatomical curvatures. In a cardiac catheter use case, active\nlubrication reduced friction by up to 42% on ex-vivo porcine aorta tissue and\n82% on rigid substrates, denoting its potential performance on healthy and\ncalcified tissue, respectively. Thermal imaging confirmed that temperature at\nthe tissue-catheter interface remained within safe limits.

    "abstract": "Vision Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable performance, but are also\nvulnerable to backdoor attacks whereby the adversary can manipulate the model's\noutputs through hidden triggers. Prior attacks primarily rely on\nsingle-modality triggers, leaving the crucial cross-modal fusion nature of VLMs\nlargely unexplored. Unlike prior work, we identify a novel attack surface that\nleverages cross-modal semantic mismatches as implicit triggers. Based on this\ninsight, we propose BadSem (Backdoor Attack with Semantic Manipulation), a data\npoisoning attack that injects stealthy backdoors by deliberately misaligning\nimage-text pairs during training. To perform the attack, we construct SIMBad, a\ndataset tailored for semantic manipulation involving color and object\nattributes. Extensive experiments across four widely used VLMs show that BadSem\nachieves over 98% average ASR, generalizes well to out-of-distribution\ndatasets, and can transfer across poisoning modalities. Our detailed analysis\nusing attention visualization shows that backdoored models focus on\nsemantically sensitive regions under mismatched conditions while maintaining\nnormal behavior on clean inputs. To mitigate the attack, we try two defense\nstrategies based on system prompt and supervised fine-tuning but find that both\nof them fail to mitigate the semantic backdoor. Our findings highlight the\nurgent need to address semantic vulnerabilities in VLMs for their safer\ndeployment.",

However, deploying these fixed models in\nreal-world IoT applications is challenging because different devices possess\nheterogeneous computational and memory resources, making it impossible to\ndeploy a single model across all platforms. Although traditional compression\nmethods, such as pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation, can improve\nefficiency, they become inflexible once applied and cannot adapt to changing\nresource constraints. To address these issues, we propose ReStNet, a Reusable\nand Stitchable Network that dynamically constructs a hybrid network by\nstitching two pre-trained models together. Implementing ReStNet requires\naddressing several key challenges, including how to select the optimal\nstitching points, determine the stitching order of the two pre-trained models,\nand choose an effective fine-tuning strategy. To systematically address these\nchallenges and adapt to varying resource constraints, ReStNet determines the\nstitching point by calculating layer-wise similarity via Centered Kernel\nAlignment (CKA). It then constructs the hybrid model by retaining early layers\nfrom a larger-capacity model and appending deeper layers from a smaller one. To\nfacilitate efficient deployment, only the stitching layer is fine-tuned. This\ndesign enables rapid adaptation to changing budgets while fully leveraging\navailable resources. Moreover, ReStNet supports both homogeneous (CNN-CNN,\nTransformer-Transformer) and heterogeneous (CNN-Transformer) stitching,\nallowing to combine different model families flexibly. Extensive experiments on\nmultiple benchmarks demonstrate that ReStNet achieve flexible\naccuracy-efficiency trade-offs at runtime while significantly reducing training\ncost.",

This paper addresses two key issues:\ndetecting the global change-point and identifying the spatial support set,\nwithin a unified framework tailored to spatially indexed functional data. By\nleveraging a weakly separable cross-covariance structure -- an extension beyond\nthe restrictive assumption of space-time separability -- we incorporate\nfunctional principal component analysis into the change-detection methodology,\nwhile preserving common temporal features across locations.

Previous studies have primarily focused\non tasks such as style transfer, background replacement, object substitution,\nand attribute modification, while maintaining the content structure of the\nsource video. However, more complex tasks, including the addition of novel\nobjects and nonrigid transformations, remain relatively unexplored. In this\npaper, we present TV-LiVE, a Training-free and text-guided Video editing\nframework via Layerinformed Vitality Exploitation. We empirically identify\nvital layers within the video generation model that significantly influence the\nquality of generated outputs. Notably, these layers are closely associated with\nRotary Position Embeddings (RoPE). Based on this observation, our method\nenables both object addition and non-rigid video editing by selectively\ninjecting key and value features from the source model into the corresponding\nlayers of the target model guided by the layer vitality. For object addition,\nwe further identify prominent layers to extract the mask regions corresponding\nto the newly added target prompt. We found that the extracted masks from the\nprominent layers faithfully indicate the region to be edited. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that TV-LiVE outperforms existing approaches for both\nobject addition and non-rigid video editing. Project Page:\nhttps://emjay73.github.io/TV_LiVE/",

It features a unique\nsingle rotary joint that enables rapid transformation into an ultra-narrow\nprofile. Although quadrotors have seen widespread adoption in applications such\nas cinematography, agriculture, and disaster management with increasingly\nsophisticated control systems, their hardware configurations have remained\nlargely unchanged, limiting their capabilities in certain environments. Our\ndesign addresses this by enabling the hardware configuration to change on the\nfly when required. In standard flight mode, the MorphoCopter adopts an X\nconfiguration, functioning as a traditional quadcopter, but can quickly fold\ninto a stacked bicopters arrangement or any configuration in between. Existing\nmorphing designs often sacrifice controllability in compact configurations or\nrely on complex multi-joint systems. Moreover, our design achieves a greater\nwidth reduction than any existing solution. We develop a new inertia and\ncontrol-action aware adaptive control system that maintains robust performance\nacross all rotary-joint configurations. The prototype can reduce its width from\n447 mm to 138 mm (nearly 70\\% reduction) in just a few seconds.

    "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show impressive vision-language\nbenchmark performance, yet growing concerns about data contamination (test set\nexposure during training) risk masking true generalization. This concern\nextends to reasoning MLLMs, often fine-tuned via reinforcement learning from\npotentially contaminated base models. We propose a novel dynamic evaluation\nframework to rigorously assess MLLM generalization, moving beyond static\nbenchmarks. Instead of perturbing inputs, we perturb the task itself. Using the\nsame visual input, models are evaluated across a family of tasks (e.g., QA,\ncaptioning, question posing, verification) to probe diverse capabilities. This\ntask perturbation reveals whether model performance is robust or reliant on\nsuperficial task-specific cues. Our approach is analogous to loss landscape\nsharpness: models overfit or contaminated for a single task (sharp minima)\nfalter under task shifts, unlike models with generalizable solutions (flatter\nminima). We developed an automated pipeline with a calibrated judge scoring\nopen-ended generations (captions, questions) using paraphrase and corruption\nsampling. Applying this framework to leading image/video MLLMs on benchmarks\nincluding MME, RealWorldQA, and CVRR-ES, we analyze each model's cross-task\n\"ability vector.\" We demonstrate that fine-tuning on simulated test data\n(extreme contamination) drastically sharpens task-specific performance but\nharms overall generalization.

    "abstract": "Inter-VM RowHammer is an attack that induces a bitflip beyond the boundaries\nof virtual machines (VMs) to compromise a VM from another, and some\nsoftware-based techniques have been proposed to mitigate this attack.\nEvaluating these mitigation techniques requires to confirm that they actually\nmitigate inter-VM RowHammer in low overhead. A challenge in this evaluation\nprocess is that both the mitigation ability and the overhead depend on the\nunderlying hardware whose DRAM address mappings are different from machine to\nmachine. This makes comprehensive evaluation prohibitively costly or even\nimplausible as no machine that has a specific DRAM address mapping might be\navailable. To tackle this challenge, we propose a simulation-based framework to\nevaluate software-based inter-VM RowHammer mitigation techniques across\nconfigurable DRAM address mappings. We demonstrate how to reproduce existing\nmitigation techniques on our framework, and show that it can evaluate the\nmitigation abilities and performance overhead of them with configurable DRAM\naddress mappings.",

Here,\nwe derive general relationships between the measured SKPM voltage and the\nunderlying source, revealing either can be cast as a convolution with an\nappropriately scaled point spread function (PSF). For charge that exists on a\nthin insulating layer above a conductor, the PSF has the same shape as what\nwould occur from a work-function variation alone, differing by a simple scaling\nfactor. We confirm this relationship by: (1) backing it out from finite-element\nsimulations of work-function and charge signals, and (2) experimentally\ncomparing the measured PSF from a small work-function target to that from a\nsmall charge spot. This scaling factor is further validated by comparing SKPM\ncharge measurements with Faraday cup measurements for highly charged samples\nfrom contact-charging experiments.

In this setting, optimal CEs require history-dependent\npolicies; this poses new representational and algorithmic challenges as the\nnumber of possible histories grows exponentially with the number of time steps.\nWe focus on computing $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-optimal CEs -- solutions that\nachieve a value within $\\epsilon$ of an optimal CE, while allowing the agents'\nincentive constraints to be violated by at most $\\delta$. Our main result is an\nalgorithm that computes an $(\\epsilon,\\delta)$-optimal CE in time polynomial in\n$1/(\\epsilon\\delta(1 - \\gamma))^{n+1}$, where $\\gamma$ is the discount factor,\nand $n$ is the number of agents. For (a slightly more general variant of)\nturn-based games, we further reduce the complexity to a polynomial in $n$.

We first reveal that behavioral\nhallucinations mainly arise from two key factors: prior-driven bias and the\nsnowball effect. Based on these observations, we introduce SHE (Sequence\nHallucination Eradication), a lightweight, two-stage framework that (1) detects\nhallucinations via visual-textual alignment check using our proposed adaptive\ntemporal window and (2) mitigates them via orthogonal projection onto the joint\nembedding space.

Experiments under different actuation frequencies result in\ndifferent motion regimes. At low frequencies, in-plane tumbling; at higher\nfrequencies, moving forward in a spatial helical path in synchrony with the\nrotating magnetic field; in further frequency increase, asynchronous swimming\nis obtained. In this work, we present mathematical analysis of this\nnano-swimmer motion. We consider a simple two-link model and explicitly\nformulate and analyze its nonlinear dynamic equations, and reduce them to a\nsimpler time-invariant system. For the first time, we obtain explicit analytic\nsolutions of synchronous motion under simplifying assumptions, for both\nsolutions of in-plane tumbling and spatial helical swimming. We conduct\nstability analysis of the solutions, presenting stability transitions and\nbifurcations for the different solution branches. Furthermore, we present\nanalysis of the influence of additional effects, as well as parametric\noptimization of the swimmer's speed. The results of our theoretical study are\nessential for understanding the nonlinear dynamics of experimental magnetic\nnano-swimmers for biomedical applications, and conducting practical\noptimization of their performance.",

However, existing\nmethods often rely on large-scale forget and retain datasets, and suffer from\nunnatural responses, poor generalization, or catastrophic utility loss. In this\nwork, we propose Reinforcement UnLearning (RULE), an efficient framework that\nformulates unlearning as a refusal boundary optimization problem.

In our model, an agent may strategically\nmisreport the proposed element's utility, unlike the standard delegated choice\nproblem which assumes that the agent truthfully reports the utility for the\nproposed alternative. Thus, the principal needs to inspect the proposed element\npossibly along with other alternatives to maximize its own utility, given an\nexogenous cost of inspecting each element. Further, the delegation itself\nincurs a fixed cost, thus the principal can decide whether to delegate or not\nand inspect by herself.\n  We show that DCIC indeed is a generalization of PNOI where the side\ninformation from a strategic agent is available at certain cost, implying its\nNP-hardness by Fu, Li, and Liu (STOC'23). We first consider a costless\ndelegation setting in which the cost of delegation is free. We prove that the\nmaximal mechanism over the pure delegation with a single inspection and an PNOI\npolicy without delegation achieves a $3$-approximation for DCIC with costless\ndelegation, which is further proven to be tight. These results hold even when\nthe cost comes from an arbitrary monotone set function, and can be improved to\na $2$-approximation if the cost of inspection is the same for every element.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable\ncapabilities across diverse domains, particularly in mathematical reasoning,\namid which geometry problem solving remains a challenging area where auxiliary\nconstruction plays a enssential role. Existing approaches either achieve\nsuboptimal performance or rely on massive LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o), incurring\nmassive computational costs. We posit that reinforcement learning with\nverifiable reward (e.g., GRPO) offers a promising direction for training\nsmaller models that effectively combine auxiliary construction with robust\ngeometric reasoning. However, directly applying GRPO to geometric reasoning\npresents fundamental limitations due to its dependence on unconditional\nrewards, which leads to indiscriminate and counterproductive auxiliary\nconstructions. To address these challenges, we propose Group Contrastive Policy\nOptimization (GCPO), a novel reinforcement learning framework featuring two key\ninnovations: (1) Group Contrastive Masking, which adaptively provides positive\nor negative reward signals for auxiliary construction based on contextual\nutility, and a (2) length reward that promotes longer reasoning chains.\nBuilding on GCPO, we develop GeometryZero, a family of affordable-size\ngeometric reasoning models that judiciously determine when to employ auxiliary\nconstruction. Our extensive empirical evaluation across popular geometric\nbenchmarks (Geometry3K, MathVista) demonstrates that GeometryZero models\nconsistently outperform baselines (e.g. GRPO), achieving an average improvement\nof 4.29% across all benchmarks.",

    "abstract": "Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) enables clients to collaboratively\ntrain personalized models tailored to their individual objectives, addressing\nthe challenge of model generalization in traditional Federated Learning (FL)\ndue to high data heterogeneity. However, existing PFL methods often require\nincreased communication rounds to achieve the desired performance, primarily\ndue to slow training caused by the use of first-order optimization, which has\nlinear convergence. Additionally, many of these methods increase local\ncomputation because of the additional data fed into the model during the search\nfor personalized local models. One promising solution to this slow training is\nsecond-order optimization, known for its quadratic convergence. However,\nemploying it in PFL is challenging due to the Hessian matrix and its inverse.\nIn this paper, we propose pFedSOP, which efficiently utilizes second-order\noptimization in PFL to accelerate the training of personalized models and\nenhance performance with fewer communication rounds. Our approach first\ncomputes a personalized local gradient update using the Gompertz function-based\nnormalized angle between local and global gradient updates, incorporating\nclient-specific global information. We then use a regularized Fisher\nInformation Matrix (FIM), computed from this personalized gradient update, as\nan approximation of the Hessian to update the personalized models. This\nFIM-based second-order optimization speeds up training with fewer communication\nrounds by tackling the challenges with exact Hessian and avoids additional data\nbeing fed into the model during the search for personalized local models.\nExtensive experiments on heterogeneously partitioned image classification\ndatasets with partial client participation demonstrate that pFedSOP outperforms\nstate-of-the-art FL and PFL algorithms.",

The desired\noutcome is that the model asserts itself, maintaining consistent truth\nevaluation across both framings, rather than switching its evaluation to agree\nwith the user.

Both types of registration are realized by optical flow\nestimation.

We perform direct\nnonlinear simulations of both models in 2D to show that this instability leads\nto a state of elastic turbulence comprising several narrow shear bands that\ndynamically coalesce, split and interact. Importantly, we show that this 2D\ninstability arises not only in fluids that have a non-monotonic constitutive\ncurve, and therefore show shear banding in 1D calculations, but also in shear\nthinning fluids with a monotonic constitutive curve, for which an initially\nhomogeneous base state is stable in 1D. For the former category, the high shear\nbranch of the constitutive curve is unstable to 2D instability in both models,\nso that the high shear band may be turbulent. In the Rolie-Poly model, the low\nshear branch is also likewise unstable. Our work provides the first simulation\nevidence for elastic turbulence in highly entangled polymeric fluids. It also\npotentially explains rheo-chaotic states seen experimentally in shear banding\nwormlike micelles. We additionally demonstrate elastic turbulence within both\nmodels in the planar Poiseuille geometry.",

Here we extend this geometric-dynamic decomposition from the\nwave-evolution phase to a distinct class of wave scattering problems, where\nobservables (such as frequency, momentum, or position) experience shifts in\ntheir expectation values between the input and output wave sates. We describe\nthis class of problems using a unitary scattering matrix and the associated\ngeneralized Wigner-Smith operator (GWSO), which involves gradients of the\nscattering matrix with respect to conjugate variables (time, position, or\nmomentum, respectively). We show that both the GWSO and the resulting\nexpectation-values shifts admit gauge-invariant decompositions into dynamic and\ngeometric parts, related respectively to gradients of the eigenvalues and\neigenvectors of the scattering matrix. We illustrate this general theory\nthrough a series of examples, including frequency shifts in polarized-light\ntransmission through a time-varying waveplate (linked to the Pancharatnam-Berry\nphase), momentum shifts at spatially varying metasurfaces, optical forces, beam\nshifts upon reflection at a dielectric interface, and Wigner time delays in 1D\nscattering.

CoT is a widely adopted method for\nimproving reasoning tasks, however, our findings reveal a more nuanced picture\nof its effectiveness. We demonstrate two things:\n  - The effectiveness of Chain-of-Thought prompting can vary greatly depending\non the type of task and model. For non-reasoning models, CoT generally improves\naverage performance by a small amount, particularly if the model does not\ninherently engage in step-by-step processing by default. However, CoT can\nintroduce more variability in answers, sometimes triggering occasional errors\nin questions the model would otherwise get right. We also found that many\nrecent models perform some form of CoT reasoning even if not asked; for these\nmodels, a request to perform CoT had little impact. Performing CoT generally\nrequires far more tokens (increasing cost and time) than direct answers.\n  - For models designed with explicit reasoning capabilities, CoT prompting\noften results in only marginal, if any, gains in answer accuracy.

Such a problem suffers from three main challenges: (i)\nnonlinearity of the quantile objective as a functional of the reward\ndistribution, (ii) unobserved confounding issue, and (iii) insufficient\ncoverage of the offline dataset. To address these challenges, we propose a\nsuite of causal-assisted policy learning methods that provably enjoy strong\ntheoretical guarantees under mild conditions.

    "abstract": "Arising from the whole body of Wittgenstein's writings is a picture of a (not\nnecessarily straight, linear, but admittedly tireless) journey to come to terms\nwith the mechanics of language as an instrument to conceive `reality' and to\ncommunicate an acquired conception of the `world'. The journey passes through\nmathematics, psychology, color perception, certainty, aesthetic, but, looking\nat it from a sort of birdview, it seems reasonable to say that these are all\nused as `test beds' for his reflections and `experimentations' towards an all\nencompassing perspective of such a fundamental gateway to human reasoning and\nlife-revealing as language. Whatever labelling of Wittgenstein as a mystic, a\nlogicist, a conventionalist, a skeptic, an anti-metaphysics, an anti-realist, a\nverificationist, a pragmatist, a behaviorist, and many others, does not seem to\ndo justice to his absolute obsession with being a persistent `deep diver' into\nthe nature of language. Working with an open and searchable account of the\nNachlass has allowed us to identify important aspects of the philosopher's\npossible common line of thinking, in spite of changes of directions, some of\nthem acknowledged by Wittgenstein himself. One of those aspects is the\nassociation of meaning with use, application, purpose, usefulness of symbols in\nlanguage, which happens to show itself from the very beginning through to the\nvery late writings. The German terms Gebrauch, Anwendung, \\emph{Verwendung},\nZweck in relation to meaning, sense of signs, words, sentences, appear in\nseveral texts since the WW1 Notebooks (1914--1916) up until very late\nmanuscripts from 1950--51.",

While the literature\nhighlights the potential of RIS in different modern applications, two key\nissues have gained significant attention from the research community: channel\nestimation and phase shift optimization. The performance gains of RIS-assisted\nsystems rely heavily on optimal phase shifts, which, in turn, depend on\naccurate channel estimation. Several studies have addressed these challenges\nunder different assumptions. Some works consider a range of continuous phase\nshifts, while others propose a limited number of discrete phase values for the\nRIS elements. Many studies present an idealized perspective, whereas others aim\nto approximate more practical aspects by considering circuit system responses\nand employing phase shifts derived from a Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) or\nother lookup tables. However, to our knowledge, no study has examined the\ninfluence of circuit system parameters on channel estimation and subsequent\nphase shift optimization. This paper models each RIS element as an equivalent\nresonant circuit composed of resistance, capacitance, and inductance. We\npropose that resistance and capacitance parameters can be dynamically and\nindependently configured, leading to the formulation of an impedance matrix.\nFurthermore, we construct a circuit-based RIS phase shift matrix that accounts\nfor the response of the resonant circuit, which changes with variations in the\nphysical parameters of resistance and capacitance. We investigate the impact of\nthis circuit-based RIS phase shift within a tensor-based channel estimation\napproach. Our results indicate a performance loss compared to ideal scenarios,\nsuch as those using the DFT design.

We find that previous approaches to\nred-teaming may suffer from two key limitations.

QDRT achieves goal-driven diversity through\nbehavior-conditioned training and implements a behavioral replay buffer in an\nopen-ended manner.

This hybrid attribute helps alleviate the precision\nlimitation in audio feature extraction within other learning models like deep\nresidual shrinkage networks.

    "abstract": "The primal-dual hybrid gradient (PDHG) method is one of the most popular\nalgorithms for solving saddle point problems. However, when applying the PDHG\nmethod and its many variants to some real-world models commonly encountered in\nsignal processing, imaging sciences, and statistical learning, there often\nexists an imbalance between the two subproblems, with the dual subproblem\ntypically being easier to solve than the primal one. In this paper, we propose\na flexible triple-Bregman balanced primal-dual algorithm (TBDA) to solve a\nclass of (not necessarily smooth) convex-concave saddle point problems with a\nbilinear coupling term. Specifically, our TBDA mainly consists of two dual\nsubproblems and one primal subproblem. Moreover, three Bregman proximal terms,\neach one with an individual Bregman kernel function, are embedded into the\nrespective subproblems. In this way, it effectively enables us to strike a\npractical balance between the primal and dual subproblems. More interestingly,\nit provides us a flexible algorithmic framework to understand some existing\niterative schemes and to produce customized structure-exploiting algorithms for\napplications. Theoretically, we first establish the global convergence and\nergodic convergence rate of the TBDA under some mild conditions. In particular,\nour TBDA allows larger step sizes than the PDHG method under appropriate\nparameter settings. Then, when the requirements on objective functions are\nfurther strengthened, we accordingly introduce two improved versions with\nbetter convergence rates than the original TBDA. Some numerical experiments on\nsynthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our TBDA performs better than the\nPDHG method and some other efficient variants in practice.",

MARCUS applies dedicated agents for\nstructural noise removal and semantic segmentation, preserving answer-bearing\nspans while improving contextual integrity. Experimental evaluations\ndemonstrate that BRIGHT-Plus yields consistent and significant improvements in\nboth retrieval accuracy and multi-hop reasoning across a diverse set of\nretrievers.

To\naddress these issues, this work proposes a novel multi-scale dense text spotter\nfor edge AI-based vision system (EdgeSpotter) to achieve accurate and robust\nindustrial panel monitoring. Specifically, a novel Transformer with efficient\nmixer is developed to learn the interdependencies among multi-level features,\nintegrating multi-layer spatial and semantic cues. In addition, a new feature\nsampling with catmull-rom splines is designed, which explicitly encodes the\nshape, position, and semantic information of text, thereby alleviating missed\ndetections and reducing recognition errors caused by multi-scale or dense text\nregions. Furthermore, a new benchmark dataset for industrial panel monitoring\n(IPM) is constructed. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations on\nthis challenging benchmark dataset validate the superior performance of the\nproposed method in different challenging panel monitoring tasks. Finally,\npractical tests based on the self-designed edge AI-based vision system\ndemonstrate the practicality of the method.

When studying\ndiffusion equations with contrasting coefficients, special attention is given\nto nonlocal models with weakly conducting inclusions. In this case, macro-level\nprocesses are described by integro-differential equations, where the difference\nkernel is determined by the solution of a nonstationary cell problem. The main\ncontribution of this work is the development of a computational framework for\nthe homogenization of nonstationary processes, accounting for memory effects.\nThe effective diffusion tensor is computed using a standard numerical procedure\nbased on finite element discretization in space. The memory kernel is\napproximated by a sum of exponentials obtained from solving a partial spectral\nproblem on the periodicity cell. The nonlocal macro-level problem is\ntransformed into a local one, where memory effects are incorporated through the\nsolution of auxiliary nonstationary problems. Standard two-level time\ndiscretization schemes are employed, and unconditional stability of the\ndiscrete solutions is proved in appropriate norms.

To reduce\nthe efficiency gap, we propose REO-RL, a class of Reinforcement Learning\nalgorithms that minimizes REG by targeting a sparse set of token budgets.\nLeveraging numerical integration over strategically selected budgets, REO-RL\napproximates the full efficiency objective with low error using a small set of\ntoken budgets. Through systematic benchmarking, we demonstrate that our\nefficiency metric, REG, effectively captures the accuracy-length trade-off,\nwith low-REG methods reducing length while maintaining accuracy. Our approach,\nREO-RL, consistently reduces REG by >=50 across all evaluated LRMs and matching\nQwen3-4B/8B efficiency frontiers under a 16K token budget with minimal accuracy\nloss. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of our exponential token\nbudget strategy. Finally, our findings highlight that fine-tuning LRMs to\nperfectly align with the efficiency frontiers remains an open challenge.",

While\nthe Milky Way has been recognized as a barred spiral galaxy since the 1960s,\nthere is still uncertainty about the exact number of spiral arms it contains.\nCurrently, our understanding of the Galaxy is evolving thanks to the\nunprecedented detail provided by Gaia's parallactic distances. Aims. To shed\nlight on the spatial distribution of red supergiants (RSGs) on the Disk and\ntheir uniformity of parameters across it, a census of Galactic RSGs detected by\nGaia is needed. Methods. Candidate RSGs were extracted from the combined Gaia\nDR3 and 2MASS catalogs using color criteria and parallactic distances. The\nsample includes 335 stars that were not included in catalogs of previously\nknown RSGs detected by Gaia DR3. Interstellar and circumstellar extinction\nvalues were estimated from the infrared bands. Spectral types were collected\nfrom Simbad or VIZIER databases and, for 135 candidates, were inferred from the\nGaia DR3 BPRP spectra. Stellar luminosities were inferred using photometric\nmeasurements and the Gaia DR3 distances. Results. The analysis yielded a\ngenuine sample of O-rich late-type stars, and the calculated luminosities\nconfirm that the sample is mostly made of stars brighter than Mbol=-5 mag. This\nnew sample represents a 40% increase in the number of highly probable RSGs\ncompared to previous studies.

As experiments become increasingly complex, addressing this gap is\nessential to ensure that the designs accurately reflect the effects of the\naddition sequence and effectively handle the associated variability. Motivated\nby this, this paper seeks to address the gap by expanding the indicator\nfunction framework for block OofA designs. We propose the use of the word\nlength pattern as a criterion for selecting robust block OofA designs. To\nimprove search efficiency and reduce computational demands, we develop\nalgorithms that employ orthogonal Latin squares for design construction and\nselection, minimizing the need for exhaustive searches. Our analysis, supported\nby correlation plots, reveals that the algorithms effectively manage\nconfounding and aliasing between effects.

Our main result is that flat band superconductivity is robust\nagainst disorder: The critical disorder strength, $W_c$, required to localize\nthe fermion pairs and destroy superconductivity, is finite at any interaction\nstrength, $U$, and is proportional to the superconducting weight, $D_s$, of the\nclean system.

The aim of the patient similarity computation is to measure the\nsimilarity among patients according to their historical clinical records, which\nhelps to improve clinical decision support. This paper presents a novel\ndistributed patient similarity computation (DPSC) technique based on data\ntransformation (DT) methods, utilizing an effective combination of time series\nand static data. Time series data are sensor-collected patients' information,\nincluding metrics like heart rate, blood pressure, Oxygen saturation,\nrespiration, etc. The static data are mainly patient background and demographic\ndata, including age, weight, height, gender, etc. Static data has been used for\nclustering the patients. Before feeding the static data to the machine learning\nmodel adaptive Weight-of-Evidence (aWOE) and Z-score data transformation (DT)\nmethods have been performed, which improve the prediction performances. In\naWOE-based patient similarity models, sensitive patient information has been\nprocessed using aWOE which preserves the data privacy of the trained models. We\nused the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) approach, which is robust and very popular,\nfor time series similarity. However, DTW is not suitable for big data due to\nthe significant computational run-time. To overcome this problem, distributed\nDTW computation is used in this study. For Coronary Artery Disease, our DT\nbased approach boosts prediction performance by as much as 11.4%, 10.20%, and\n12.6% in terms of AUC, accuracy, and F-measure, respectively.

    "abstract": "Unsupervised Camoflaged Object Detection (UCOD) has gained attention since it\ndoesn't need to rely on extensive pixel-level labels. Existing UCOD methods\ntypically generate pseudo-labels using fixed strategies and train 1 x1\nconvolutional layers as a simple decoder, leading to low performance compared\nto fully-supervised methods. We emphasize two drawbacks in these approaches:\n1). The model is prone to fitting incorrect knowledge due to the pseudo-label\ncontaining substantial noise. 2). The simple decoder fails to capture and learn\nthe semantic features of camouflaged objects, especially for small-sized\nobjects, due to the low-resolution pseudo-labels and severe confusion between\nforeground and background pixels. To this end, we propose a UCOD method with a\nteacher-student framework via Dynamic Pseudo-label Learning called UCOD-DPL,\nwhich contains an Adaptive Pseudo-label Module (APM), a Dual-Branch Adversarial\n(DBA) decoder, and a Look-Twice mechanism. The APM module adaptively combines\npseudo-labels generated by fixed strategies and the teacher model to prevent\nthe model from overfitting incorrect knowledge while preserving the ability for\nself-correction; the DBA decoder takes adversarial learning of different\nsegmentation objectives, guides the model to overcome the foreground-background\nconfusion of camouflaged objects, and the Look-Twice mechanism mimics the human\ntendency to zoom in on camouflaged objects and performs secondary refinement on\nsmall-sized objects. Extensive experiments show that our method demonstrates\noutstanding performance, even surpassing some existing fully supervised\nmethods. The code is available now.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a hypothetical hybrid control framework for\nport-Hamiltonian (p$\\mathcal{H}$) systems, employing a dynamic decomposition\nbased on Data-Assisted Control (DAC). The system's evolution is split into two\nparts with fixed topology: Right-Hand Side (RHS)- an intrinsic Hamiltonian flow\nhandling worst-case parametric uncertainties, and Left-Hand Side (LHS)- a\ndissipative/input flow addressing both structural and parametric uncertainties.\nA virtual port variable $\\Pi$ serves as the interface between these two\ncomponents. A nonlinear controller manages the intrinsic Hamiltonian flow,\ndetermining a desired port control value $\\Pi_c$. Concurrently, Reinforcement\nLearning (RL) is applied to the dissipative/input flow to learn an agent for\nproviding optimal policy in mapping $\\Pi_c$ to the actual system input. This\nhybrid approach effectively manages RHS uncertainties while preserving the\nsystem's inherent structure. Key advantages include adjustable performance via\nLHS controller parameters, enhanced AI explainability and interpretability\nthrough the port variable $\\Pi$, the ability to guarantee safety and state\nattainability with hard/soft constraints, reduced complexity in learning\nhypothesis classes compared to end-to-end solutions, and improved\nstate/parameter estimation using LHS prior knowledge and system Hamiltonian to\naddress partial observability.

Test-time adaptation (TTA) has recently\nemerged as a viable strategy to address such domain shifts at inference time\nwithout requiring access to source data or labels. However, existing TTA\napproaches, particularly those relying on backpropagation, are\nmemory-intensive, limiting their applicability in speech tasks and\nresource-constrained settings. Although backpropagation-free methods offer\nimproved efficiency, existing ones exhibit poor accuracy.

    "abstract": "The expanding application of classical thermodynamic methods to black hole\nphysics has yielded significant advances in characterizing phase transition\nbehavior. Among these approaches, thermodynamic analysis -- particularly\nkinetic formulations like the Kramers' escape rate -- provides a robust\nframework for probing black hole phase transitions with minimal relativistic\nconstraints. This study investigates the kinetics and dynamic evolution of\nfirst-order phase transitions in black holes exhibiting multiple critical\npoints, employing a particle-based escape rate model. The distinct free energy\nlandscapes inherent to multi-critical systems, which can simultaneously support\nmultiple local minima under specific thermodynamic conditions (temperature and\npressure) within a given reference frame, raise fundamental questions regarding\ntransition pathways. We rigorously assess whether the Kramers' escape rate\nretains its predictive validity in these complex multi-minima systems, as\nestablished for conventional single-minimum configurations. Furthermore, we\nexamine whether transitions proceed via a sequential, stepwise mechanism\nbetween adjacent minima, or if pathways exist that bypass intermediate states\nthrough direct descent to the global minimum. Our analysis of black holes\nundergoing multiphase transitions reveals both parallels and significant\ndeviations from single-transition models. Crucially, we demonstrate that the\nKramers' escape rate remains a quantitatively reliable indicator of first-order\nphase transitions in black holes, even within multi-critical frameworks. This\napproach offers deeper insights into the governing energetic landscapes and\nkinetic processes underlying these phenomena.",

However, its\nperformance is highly dependent on the quality of the underlying human\npreference data. To address this bottleneck, prior work has explored various\ndata selection strategies, but these methods often overlook the impact of the\nevolving states of the language model during the DPO process. %including active\nquerying, response pair selection, and data pre-selection. In this paper, we\nintroduce a novel problem: Sample Scheduling for DPO, which aims to dynamically\nand adaptively schedule training samples based on the model's evolving states\nthroughout preference optimization. To solve this problem, we propose SamS, an\nefficient and effective algorithm that adaptively selects samples in each\ntraining batch based on the LLM's learning feedback to maximize the potential\ngeneralization performance. Notably, without modifying the core DPO algorithm,\nsimply integrating SamS significantly improves performance across tasks, with\nminimal additional computational overhead. This work points to a promising new\ndirection for improving LLM alignment through more effective utilization of\nfixed preference datasets.",

Despite its impressive\nalgorithmic performance, real-time rendering on resource-constrained devices\nremains a major challenge due to tight power and area budgets. This paper\npresents an architecture-algorithm co-design to address these inefficiencies.\nFirst, we reveal substantial redundancy caused by repeated computation of\ncommon terms/expressions during the conventional rasterization. To resolve\nthis, we propose axis-oriented rasterization, which pre-computes and reuses\nshared terms along both the X and Y axes through a dedicated hardware design,\neffectively reducing multiply-and-add (MAC) operations by up to 63%. Second, by\nidentifying the resource and performance inefficiency of the sorting process,\nwe introduce a novel neural sorting approach that predicts order-independent\nblending weights using an efficient neural network, eliminating the need for\ncostly hardware sorters. A dedicated training framework is also proposed to\nimprove its algorithmic stability. Third, to uniformly support rasterization\nand neural network inference, we design an efficient reconfigurable processing\narray that maximizes hardware utilization and throughput. Furthermore, we\nintroduce a $\\pi$-trajectory tile schedule, inspired by Morton encoding and\nHilbert curve, to optimize Gaussian reuse and reduce memory access overhead.\nComprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed design preserves\nrendering quality while achieving a speedup of $23.4\\sim27.8\\times$ and energy\nsavings of $28.8\\sim51.4\\times$ compared to edge GPUs for real-world scenes.

Traditional approaches\nto G-TAMP have relied either on domain-independent heuristics or on learning\nfrom planning experience to guide the search, both of which typically demand\nsignificant computational resources or data. In contrast, humans often use\ncommon sense to intuitively decide which objects to manipulate in G-TAMP\nproblems. Inspired by this, we propose leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs),\nwhich have common sense knowledge acquired from internet-scale data, to guide\ntask planning in G-TAMP problems. To enable LLMs to perform geometric\nreasoning, we design a predicate-based prompt that encodes geometric\ninformation derived from a motion planning algorithm. We then query the LLM to\ngenerate a task plan, which is then used to search for a feasible set of\ncontinuous parameters. Since LLMs are prone to mistakes, instead of committing\nto LLM's outputs, we extend Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to a hybrid action\nspace and use the LLM to guide the search. Unlike the previous approach that\ncalls an LLM at every node and incurs high computational costs, we use it to\nwarm-start the MCTS with the nodes explored in completing the LLM's task plan.\nOn six different G-TAMP problems, we show our method outperforms previous LLM\nplanners and pure search algorithms.

    "abstract": "Natural intelligence (NI) consistently achieves more with less. Infants learn\nlanguage, develop abstract concepts, and acquire sensorimotor skills from\nsparse data, all within tight neural and energy limits. In contrast, today's AI\nrelies on virtually unlimited computational power, energy, and data to reach\nhigh performance. This paper argues that constraints in NI are paradoxically\ncatalysts for efficiency, adaptability, and creativity. We first show how\nlimited neural bandwidth promotes concise codes that still capture complex\npatterns. Spiking neurons, hierarchical structures, and symbolic-like\nrepresentations emerge naturally from bandwidth constraints, enabling robust\ngeneralization. Next, we discuss chaotic itinerancy, illustrating how the brain\ntransits among transient attractors to flexibly retrieve memories and manage\nuncertainty. We then highlight reservoir computing, where random projections\nfacilitate rapid generalization from small datasets. Drawing on developmental\nperspectives, we emphasize how intrinsic motivation, along with responsive\nsocial environments, drives infant language learning and discovery of meaning.\nSuch active, embodied processes are largely absent in current AI. Finally, we\nsuggest that adopting 'less is more' principles -- energy constraints,\nparsimonious architectures, and real-world interaction -- can foster the\nemergence of more efficient, interpretable, and biologically grounded\nartificial systems.",

All-optical\ncontrol of antiferromagnetic order is essential to fully exploit their\npotential in energy-efficient and high-speed spintronic and memory\napplications. However, optical writing of antiferromagnetic domains remains a\nfundamental challenge, as conventional magneto-optical techniques rely on net\nmagnetization, which is absent in antiferromagnets. In certain multiferroic\nantiferromagnets, the magnetic toroidal moment provides an additional degree of\nfreedom through its inherent magnetoelectric coupling. This coupling at higher\nfrequencies results in the optical magnetoelectric effect (OME), which\nmanifests as a directional asymmetry in light propagation and enables optical\nprobing of antiferromagnetic states. Here, we demonstrate all-optical writing\nof antiferromagnetic domains using the inverse optical magnetoelectric effect\n(IOME) in ferrotoroidic LiNiPO4. The writing process is nonvolatile,\nnon-thermal, and deterministic, driven solely by reversing the light\npropagation direction. This directional control arises from a strong coupling\nbetween the photon linear momentum and the magnetic toroidal moment, enabling\nthe repeatable switching between time-reversed domains with arbitrary light\npolarization.

However, existing solutions fail to yield interpretable adversarial\nexamples due to their poor sparsity. Worse still, they often struggle with\nheavy computational overhead, poor transferability, and weak attack strength.\nIn this paper, we aim to develop a sparse attack for understanding the\nvulnerability of CNNs by minimizing the magnitude of initial perturbations\nunder the l0 constraint, to overcome the existing drawbacks while achieving a\nfast, transferable, and strong attack to DNNs. In particular, a novel and\ntheoretical sound parameterization technique is introduced to approximate the\nNP-hard l0 optimization problem, making directly optimizing sparse\nperturbations computationally feasible.

    "abstract": "Topological insulators exhibit unique boundary states that are protected by\nthe topology of the bulk bands, a phenomenon that has now been extended to\nclassical systems such as phononics and mechanics. Typically, nontrivial\ntopology in an $n$-dimensional bulk leads to the emergence of\n$(n-1)$-dimensional topologically protected boundary states. However, these\nstates can often be gapped out by breaking the symmetry that protects them,\nresulting in the possible creation of new in-gap higher-order topological\nmodes. A notable example of this is the higher-order topological insulator\n(HOTI), where gapping out surface states leads to the formation of\nlower-dimensional topological modes, such as hinge or corner states. This\nprocess reduces the spatial dimensionality of the protected modes from $(n-1)$\nto $(n-2)$ or even lower. In this work, we propose an alternative method to\nachieve higher-order topological modes using a one-dimensional\nSu-Schrieffer-Heeger model. Instead of relying on dimensional reduction, we\nmanipulate the positions of domain walls to gap out the originally\ntopologically protected domain-wall states, thereby inducing new higher-order\ntopological states. These new higher-order topological states can be\ncharacterized using a generalized winding number calculation. This approach\nallows for the realization of multiple (and even infinite) topological orders\nwithin simple 1D lattices while maintaining the principle of bulk-boundary\ncorrespondence. Our study reveals a new mechanism that enriches topological\nhierarchies beyond conventional classifications. Such a mechanism could also be\nextended to higher dimensions, potentially creating intricate networks of\ntopological states and advancing our control over wave phenomena.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in large language models show strong promise for formal\nreasoning. However, most LLM-based theorem provers have long been constrained\nby the need for expert-written formal statements as inputs, limiting their\napplicability to real-world problems expressed in natural language. We tackle\nthis gap with Mathesis, the first end-to-end theorem proving pipeline\nprocessing informal problem statements. It contributes Mathesis-Autoformalizer,\nthe first autoformalizer using reinforcement learning to enhance the\nformalization ability of natural language problems, aided by our novel\nLeanScorer framework for nuanced formalization quality assessment. It also\nproposes a Mathesis-Prover, which generates formal proofs from the formalized\nstatements. To evaluate the real-world applicability of end-to-end formal\ntheorem proving, we introduce Gaokao-Formal, a benchmark of 488 complex\nproblems from China's national college entrance exam. Our approach is carefully\ndesigned, with a thorough study of each component. Experiments demonstrate\nMathesis's effectiveness, with the autoformalizer outperforming the best\nbaseline by 22% in pass-rate on Gaokao-Formal.

However, their\neffectiveness in medical applications remains limited due to the inherent\ndiscrepancies between data and tasks in medical scenarios and those in the\ngeneral domain. Concretely, existing medical MLLMs face the following critical\nlimitations: (1) limited coverage of medical knowledge beyond imaging, (2)\nheightened susceptibility to hallucinations due to suboptimal data curation\nprocesses, (3) lack of reasoning capabilities tailored for complex medical\nscenarios. To address these challenges, we first propose a comprehensive data\ncuration procedure that (1) efficiently acquires rich medical knowledge data\nnot only from medical imaging but also from extensive medical texts and\ngeneral-domain data; and (2) synthesizes accurate medical captions, visual\nquestion answering (VQA), and reasoning samples. As a result, we build a\nmultimodal dataset enriched with extensive medical knowledge. Building on the\ncurated data, we introduce our medical-specialized MLLM: Lingshu.

We conducted\ncomprehensive evaluations using historical texts from Thucydides. Our findings\nreveal that enhancement strategies optimize different performance dimensions\nrather than providing universal improvements. For coverage and historical\nbreadth, base generation achieves optimal performance with Claude and GPT-4\nextracting comprehensive events. However, for precision, RAG enhancement\nimproves coordinate accuracy and metadata completeness. Model architecture\nfundamentally determines enhancement sensitivity: larger models demonstrate\nrobust baseline performance with incremental RAG improvements, while Llama 3.2\nshows extreme variance from competitive performance to complete failure. We\nthen developed an automated translation pipeline converting extracted RDF\nrepresentations into Coq proof assistant specifications, enabling higher-order\nreasoning beyond RDF capabilities including multi-step causal verification,\ntemporal arithmetic with BC dates, and formal proofs about historical\ncausation.

However,\nthese algorithms encounter biases and iteration difficulties due to significant\nnoise in quantum processors. These difficulties can only be partially addressed\nwithout error correction by optimizing hardware, reducing circuit complexity,\nor fitting and extrapolation. A compelling solution is applying probabilistic\nerror cancellation (PEC), a quantum error mitigation technique that enables\nunbiased results without full error correction. Traditional PEC is challenging\nto apply in VQAs due to its variance amplification, contradicting iterative\nprocess assumptions. This paper proposes a novel noise-adaptable strategy that\ncombines PEC with the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). It is\nimplemented through invariant sampling circuits (invariant-PEC, or IPEC) and\nsubstantially reduces iteration variance. This strategy marks the first\nsuccessful integration of PEC and QAOA, resulting in efficient convergence.\nMoreover, we introduce adaptive partial PEC (APPEC), which modulates the error\ncancellation proportion of IPEC during iteration. We experimentally validated\nthis technique on a superconducting quantum processor, cutting sampling cost by\n90.1\\%. Notably, we find that dynamic adjustments of error levels via APPEC can\nenhance escape from local minima and reduce sampling costs.

We find\na wide diversity of chemical sequences, without correlation between the\nemergence of dichotomous $\\alpha$-chemistry and GSE-like mergers. The\ntransition between multiple $\\alpha$-sequences is sequential, and is mediated\nby modulations in the star formation rate (SFR).

The metallicity overlap\nbetween the high-$\\alpha$ and low-$\\alpha$ sequences (as seen in the Solar\nneighbourhood of the MW) arises from accretion of metal-poor gas from the\ncircum-galactic medium. This depends on gas disc thickness, with thinner discs\nlosing their metal-poor extremities. Gas donation from singular gas-rich merger\nevents are incapable of driving long-lived metal dilution ($\\Delta\\text{[Fe/H]}\n\\gtrsim 0.3$), and we rule-out this scenario for the low-$\\alpha$ sequence in\nthe MW. Finally, the shape of $\\alpha$-sequences in the [Fe/H] versus [Mg/Fe]\nplane is related to long-term SFR trends, with a downward slanted locus (as is\nobserved in the low-$\\alpha$ sequence of the MW) owing to a sustained or\ndeclining SFR.",

    "abstract": "Tabular data serve as a fundamental and ubiquitous representation of\nstructured information in numerous real-world applications, e.g., finance and\nurban planning. In the realm of tabular imbalanced applications, data imbalance\nhas been investigated in classification tasks with insufficient instances in\ncertain labels, causing the model's ineffective generalizability. However, the\nimbalance issue of tabular regression tasks is underexplored, and yet is\ncritical due to unclear boundaries for continuous labels and simplifying\nassumptions in existing imbalance regression work, which often rely on known\nand balanced test distributions. Such assumptions may not hold in practice and\ncan lead to performance degradation. To address these issues, we propose MATI:\nMixture Experts with Test-Time Self-Supervised Aggregation for Tabular\nImbalance Regression, featuring two key innovations: (i) the Region-Aware\nMixture Expert, which adopts a Gaussian Mixture Model to capture the underlying\nrelated regions. The statistical information of each Gaussian component is then\nused to synthesize and train region-specific experts to capture the unique\ncharacteristics of their respective regions. (ii) Test-Time Self-Supervised\nExpert Aggregation, which dynamically adjusts region expert weights based on\ntest data features to reinforce expert adaptation across varying test\ndistributions. We evaluated MATI on four real-world tabular imbalance\nregression datasets, including house pricing, bike sharing, and age prediction.\nTo reflect realistic deployment scenarios, we adopted three types of test\ndistributions: a balanced distribution with uniform target frequencies, a\nnormal distribution that follows the training data, and an inverse distribution\nthat emphasizes rare target regions. On average across these three test\ndistributions, MATI achieved a 7.1% improvement in MAE compared to existing\nmethods.",

    "abstract": "Segmentation of nuclei regions from histological images is an important task\nfor automated computer-aided analysis of histological images, particularly in\nthe presence of impermissible color variation in the color appearance of\nstained tissue images. While color normalization enables better nuclei\nsegmentation, accurate segmentation of nuclei structures makes color\nnormalization rather trivial. In this respect, the paper proposes a novel deep\ngenerative model for simultaneously segmenting nuclei structures and\nnormalizing color appearance of stained histological images.This model\njudiciously integrates the merits of truncated normal distribution and spatial\nattention. The model assumes that the latent color appearance information,\ncorresponding to a particular histological image, is independent of respective\nnuclei segmentation map as well as embedding map information. The disentangled\nrepresentation makes the model generalizable and adaptable as the modification\nor loss in color appearance information cannot be able to affect the nuclei\nsegmentation map as well as embedding information. Also, for dealing with the\nstain overlap of associated histochemical reagents, the prior for latent color\nappearance code is assumed to be a mixture of truncated normal distributions.\nThe proposed model incorporates the concept of spatial attention for\nsegmentation of nuclei regions from histological images. The performance of the\nproposed approach, along with a comparative analysis with related\nstate-of-the-art algorithms, has been demonstrated on publicly available\nstandard histological image data sets.",

To develop a nuclei segmentation\nalgorithm, applicable to different types of target domain representations,\nimage-to-image translation networks can be considered as they are invariant to\ntarget domain image representations. One of the important issues with\nimage-to-image translation models is that they fail miserably when the\ninformation content between two image domains are asymmetric in nature. In this\nregard, the paper introduces a new deep generative model for segmenting nuclei\nstructures from histological images. The proposed model considers an embedding\nspace for handling information-disparity between information-rich histological\nimage space and information-poor segmentation map domain. Integrating\njudiciously the concepts of optimal transport and measure theory, the model\ndevelops an invertible generator, which provides an efficient optimization\nframework with lower network complexity. The concept of invertible generator\nautomatically eliminates the need of any explicit cycle-consistency loss. The\nproposed model also introduces a spatially-constrained squeeze operation within\nthe framework of invertible generator to maintain spatial continuity within the\nimage patches.

Recently, activation steering has emerged as an\neffective approach for enhancing LLM safety by adding a refusal direction\nvector to internal activations of LLMs during inference, which will further\ninduce the refusal behaviors of LLMs. However, indiscriminately applying\nactivation steering fundamentally suffers from the trade-off between safety and\nutility, since the same steering vector can also lead to over-refusal and\ndegraded performance on benign prompts. Although prior efforts, such as vector\ncalibration and conditional steering, have attempted to mitigate this\ntrade-off, their lack of theoretical grounding limits their robustness and\neffectiveness. To better address the trade-off between safety and utility, we\npresent a theoretically grounded and empirically effective activation steering\nmethod called AlphaSteer. Specifically, it considers activation steering as a\nlearnable process with two principled learning objectives: utility preservation\nand safety enhancement. For utility preservation, it learns to construct a\nnearly zero vector for steering benign data, with the null-space constraints.\nFor safety enhancement, it learns to construct a refusal direction vector for\nsteering malicious data, with the help of linear regression.

We introduce CrossGen, a novel\nframework that supports both feed-forward prediction and latent generative\nmodeling of cross fields for quad meshing by unifying geometry and cross field\nrepresentations within a joint latent space. Our method enables extremely fast\ncomputation of high-quality cross fields of general input shapes, typically\nwithin one second without per-shape optimization. Our method assumes a\npoint-sampled surface, or called a point-cloud surface, as input, so we can\naccommodate various different surface representations by a straightforward\npoint sampling process. Using an auto-encoder network architecture, we encode\ninput point-cloud surfaces into a sparse voxel grid with fine-grained latent\nspaces, which are decoded into both SDF-based surface geometry and cross\nfields. We also contribute a dataset of models with both high-quality signed\ndistance fields (SDFs) representations and their corresponding cross fields,\nand use it to train our network. Once trained, the network is capable of\ncomputing a cross field of an input surface in a feed-forward manner, ensuring\nhigh geometric fidelity, noise resilience, and rapid inference. Furthermore,\nleveraging the same unified latent representation, we incorporate a diffusion\nmodel for computing cross fields of new shapes generated from partial input,\nsuch as sketches. To demonstrate its practical applications, we validate\nCrossGen on the quad mesh generation task for a large variety of surface\nshapes. Experimental results...",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the passive detection problem in multi-static\nintegrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, where multiple sensing\nreceivers (SRs) jointly detect a target using random unknown communication\nsignals transmitted by a collaborative base station. Unlike traditional active\ndetection, the considered passive detection does not require complete prior\nknowledge of the transmitted communication signals at each SR. First, we derive\na generalized likelihood ratio test detector and conduct an asymptotic analysis\nof the detection statistic under the large-sample regime. We examine how the\nsignal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of the target paths and direct paths influence\nthe detection performance. Then, we propose two joint transmit beamforming\ndesigns based on the analyses. In the first design, the asymptotic detection\nprobability is maximized while satisfying the signal-to-interference-plus-noise\nratio requirement for each communication user under the total transmit power\nconstraint. Given the non-convex nature of the problem, we develop an\nalternating optimization algorithm based on the quadratic transform and\nsemi-definite relaxation. The second design adopts a heuristic approach that\naims to maximize the target energy, subject to a minimum SNR threshold on the\ndirect path, and offers lower computational complexity. Numerical results\nvalidate the asymptotic analysis and demonstrate the superiority of the\nproposed beamforming designs in balancing passive detection performance and\ncommunication quality. This work highlights the promise of target detection\nusing unknown communication data signals in multi-static ISAC systems.",

    "abstract": "The most popular interpretation of the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect is that the\nelectromagnetic potential locally affects the complex phase of a charged\nparticle's wave function in the magnetic field free region. However, since the\nvector potential is a gauge-variant quantity, not a few researchers suspect\nthat it is just a convenient tool for calculating the force field. This\nmotivates them to explain the AB effect without using the vector potential,\nwhich inevitably leads to some sort of non-locality. This frustrating situation\nis shortly summarized by the statement of Aharonov et al. that the AB effect\nmay be due to a local gauge potential or due to non-local gauge-invariant\nfields. In the present paper, we shall give several convincing arguments, which\nsupport the viewpoint that the vector potential is not just a convenient\nmathematical tool with little physical entity. Despite its gauge arbitrariness,\nthe vector potential certainly contains a gauge-invariant piece, which solely\nexplains the observed AB phase shift. Importantly, this component has a\nproperty such that it is basically unique and cannot be eliminated by any\nregular gauge transformations. To make the discussion complete, we also discuss\nthe role of remaining gauge arbitrariness still contained in the entire vector\npotential.",

We find that the equipartition\ncondition is reasonable for out-going neutrinos, but large deviations emerge in\nthe incoming neutrinos, that has an influence on matter profiles.

Our results reveal that\neliminating intense small-scale motion leads to the formation of more organized\nand coherent flow structures, with reduced mixing and enhanced anisotropy. The\nalignment of vorticity and scalar gradient with the strain-rate eigen-frame is\nalso altered by the flow control, reducing the downscale cascade of kinetic\nenergy and the scalar variance. When the control threshold is set below the\nspatial mean of the vorticity or strain-rate field, turbulent motion in RT is\nsignificantly suppressed. Moreover, flow control eliminates regions of extreme\nvorticity and strain-rate, leading to overlapped high vorticity and high\nstrain-rate regions with reduced turbulence intensity and more coherent\nstructures. These findings provide a deeper understanding of the fundamental\nmechanisms played by small-scale structures in RT flows and their modulation\nthrough flow control.

In this paper, we propose\nContext-aware Adaptation for Robot Learning (CARoL), a novel framework to\nefficiently learn a similar but distinct new task from prior knowledge. CARoL\nincorporates context awareness by analyzing state transitions in system\ndynamics to identify similarities between the new task and prior knowledge.

Magnetic susceptibility and\nisothermal magnetization analysis reveal a weak antiferromagnetic interaction\namong the $J_{\\rm{eff}}=1/2$ spins, characterized by a small Curie-Weiss\ntemperature ($\\theta_{\\text{CW}}^{\\text{LT}}\\simeq-0.26$ K) or a reduced\nexchange coupling ($J/k_{\\rm B} \\simeq 0.18$ K). The $^{51}$V NMR spectra and\nspin-lattice relaxation rate ($1/T_1$) show no evidence of magnetic\nlong-range-order down to 1.6 K but reflect strong influence of CEF excitations\nin the intermediate temperatures. At low temperatures, $1/T_1(T)$ shows\npronounced frequency dependence and $1/T_1$ vs field in different temperatures\nfollows the scaling behaviour, highlighting the role of paramagnetic\nfluctuations. The CEF calculations using the point charge approximation divulge\na large energy gap ($\\sim 18.61$ meV) between the lowest and second lowest\nenergy doublets, further establishing Kramers' doublet as the ground state. Our\ncalculations also reproduce the experimental magnetization and specific heat\ndata and indicate an in-plane magnetic anisotropy.

To adapt to these changing preferences and promptly\ncorrect any inaccurate estimations, collaborative robots must accurately track\nthese dynamic human intentions in real time. We propose a Hierarchical\nIntention Tracking (HIT) algorithm for collaborative robots to track dynamic\nand hierarchical human intentions effectively in real time. HIT represents\nhuman intentions as intention trees with arbitrary depth, and probabilistically\ntracks human intentions by Bayesian filtering, upward measurement propagation,\nand downward posterior propagation across all levels. We develop a HIT-based\nrobotic system that dynamically switches between Interaction-Task and\nVerification-Task trees for a collaborative assembly task, allowing the robot\nto effectively coordinate human intentions at three levels: task-level (subtask\ngoal locations), interaction-level (mode of engagement with the robot), and\nverification-level (confirming or correcting intention recognition). Our user\nstudy shows that our HIT-based collaborative robot system surpasses existing\ncollaborative robot solutions by achieving a balance between efficiency,\nphysical workload, and user comfort while ensuring safety and task completion.\nPost-experiment surveys further reveal that the HIT-based system enhances the\nuser trust and minimizes interruptions to user's task flow through its\neffective understanding of human intentions across multiple levels.",

    "abstract": "3D occupancy provides fine-grained 3D geometry and semantics for scene\nunderstanding which is critical for autonomous driving. Most existing methods,\nhowever, carry high compute costs, requiring dense 3D feature volume and\ncross-attention to effectively aggregate information. More recent works have\nadopted Bird's Eye View (BEV) or sparse points as scene representation with\nmuch reduced cost, but still suffer from their respective shortcomings. More\nconcretely, BEV struggles with small objects that often experience significant\ninformation loss after being projected to the ground plane. On the other hand,\npoints can flexibly model little objects in 3D, but is inefficient at capturing\nflat surfaces or large objects. To address these challenges, in this paper, we\npresent a novel 3D occupancy prediction approach, BePo, which combines BEV and\nsparse points based representations. We propose a dual-branch design: a\nquery-based sparse points branch and a BEV branch. The 3D information learned\nin the sparse points branch is shared with the BEV stream via cross-attention,\nwhich enriches the weakened signals of difficult objects on the BEV plane. The\noutputs of both branches are finally fused to generate predicted 3D occupancy.\nWe conduct extensive experiments on the Occ3D-nuScenes and Occ3D-Waymo\nbenchmarks that demonstrate the superiority of our proposed BePo.

However, recent detectors have shown greater robustness against\nsuch basic attacks. In this work, we introduce Adversarial Paraphrasing, a\ntraining-free attack framework that universally humanizes any AI-generated text\nto evade detection more effectively. Our approach leverages an off-the-shelf\ninstruction-following LLM to paraphrase AI-generated content under the guidance\nof an AI text detector, producing adversarial examples that are specifically\noptimized to bypass detection. Extensive experiments show that our attack is\nboth broadly effective and highly transferable across several detection\nsystems. For instance, compared to simple paraphrasing attack--which,\nironically, increases the true positive at 1% false positive (T@1%F) by 8.57%\non RADAR and 15.03% on Fast-DetectGPT--adversarial paraphrasing, guided by\nOpenAI-RoBERTa-Large, reduces T@1%F by 64.49% on RADAR and a striking 98.96% on\nFast-DetectGPT. Across a diverse set of detectors--including neural\nnetwork-based, watermark-based, and zero-shot approaches--our attack achieves\nan average T@1%F reduction of 87.88% under the guidance of\nOpenAI-RoBERTa-Large. We also analyze the tradeoff between text quality and\nattack success to find that our method can significantly reduce detection\nrates, with mostly a slight degradation in text quality. Our adversarial setup\nhighlights the need for more robust and resilient detection strategies in the\nlight of increasingly sophisticated evasion techniques.",

While it is expected\nthat their primary difference lies in the stylistic \"thinking cues\", LRMs\nuniquely exhibit two pivotal, previously under-explored phenomena: a Global\nMisalignment Rebound, where their divergence from non-reasoning models persists\nor even grows as response length increases, and more critically, a Local\nMisalignment Diminish, where the misalignment concentrates at the \"thinking\ncues\" each sentence starts with but rapidly declines in the remaining of the\nsentence.

In FoReaL-Decoding, a Leading model leads the first few\ntokens for each sentence, and then a weaker draft model completes the following\ntokens to the end of each sentence. FoReaL-Decoding adopts a stochastic gate to\nsmoothly interpolate between the small and the large model.

However, this data is prone to various biases, and\ntraining an LTR system directly on biased data can result in suboptimal ranking\nperformance. One of the most prominent and well-studied biases in implicit\nfeedback data is position bias, which occurs because users are more likely to\ninteract with higher-ranked documents regardless of their true relevance. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel control function-based method that accounts for\nposition bias in a two-stage process. The first stage uses exogenous variation\nfrom the residuals of the ranking process to correct for position bias in the\nsecond stage click equation. Unlike previous position bias correction methods,\nour method does not require knowledge of the click or propensity model and\nallows for nonlinearity in the underlying ranking model. Moreover, our method\nis general and allows for debiasing any state-of-the-art ranking algorithm by\nplugging it into the second stage.

To overcome these limitations, we\nimplemented a semi-supervised model, the $p$-Laplacian regression model. This\npaper is the first to demonstrate the application of a $p$-Laplacian model for\nregression. Our $p$-Laplacian model yielded errors of $\\sim13\\%$ for ALM,\n$\\sim10\\%$ for BMD, and $\\sim20\\%$ for BFP when the training data accounted for\n10 percent of all data. Among the supervised algorithms we implemented, Support\nVector Regression (SVR) performed the best for ALM and BMD, yielding errors of\n$\\sim 8\\%$ for both, while Least Squares SVR performed the best for BFP with\n$\\sim 11\\%$ error when trained on 80 percent of the data. Our findings position\nthe $p$-Laplacian model as a promising tool for healthcare applications,\nparticularly in a data-constrained environment.",

Notably, the use of operator theory in\npartitioning the multivariable chaotic series into precise symbolic cells has\nbeen underexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel symbolic partition\nmethod, referred to as Koopman Analysis(KA) method, exploiting Koopman operator\ntheory to address the symbolic partition, especially multivariate chaotic time\nseries. We map the chaotic time series into the basis functions to obtain the\napproximate representation of the Koopman operator.Then we transpose the\nKoopman approximate matrix and subsequently perform spectral decomposition to\nobtain the Koopman left eigenfunctions. We apply KA method to one-dimensional\nunimodal chaotic map to obtain Koopman left eigenfunctions. Then we find some\nparticular eigenfunctions whose eigenvalues are zero, some of which can be used\nto identify the symbolic boundary of region composed of chaotic series in that\nthe oscillation coincides with the subregion where the theoretical symbolic\nboundary is located. We refer to the function as the Valid Left Eigenfunction\nwith Zero(VLEZ). Based on the number of oscillations, we further classify VLEZ\ninto two categories.

QT-Mob introduces a\nlocation tokenization module that learns compact, semantically rich tokens to\nrepresent locations, preserving contextual information while ensuring\ncompatibility with LLMs. Furthermore, QT-Mob incorporates a series of\ncomplementary fine-tuning objectives that align the learned tokens with the\ninternal representations in LLMs, improving the model's comprehension of\nsequential movement patterns and location semantics. The proposed QT-Mob\nframework not only enhances LLMs' ability to interpret mobility data but also\nprovides a more generalizable approach for various mobility analytics tasks.\nExperiments on three real-world dataset demonstrate the superior performance in\nboth next-location prediction and mobility recovery tasks, outperforming\nexisting deep learning and LLM-based methods.",

    "abstract": "Due to the emergence of many sign language datasets, isolated sign language\nrecognition (ISLR) has made significant progress in recent years. In addition,\nthe development of various advanced deep neural networks is another reason for\nthis breakthrough. However, challenges remain in applying the technique in the\nreal world. First, existing sign language datasets do not cover the whole sign\nvocabulary. Second, most of the sign language datasets provide only single view\nRGB videos, which makes it difficult to handle hand occlusions when performing\nISLR. To fill this gap, this paper presents a dual-view sign language dataset\nfor ISLR named NationalCSL-DP, which fully covers the Chinese national sign\nlanguage vocabulary. The dataset consists of 134140 sign videos recorded by ten\nsigners with respect to two vertical views, namely, the front side and the left\nside. Furthermore, a CNN transformer network is also proposed as a strong\nbaseline and an extremely simple but effective fusion strategy for prediction.\nExtensive experiments were conducted to prove the effectiveness of the datasets\nas well as the baseline. The results show that the proposed fusion strategy can\nsignificantly increase the performance of the ISLR, but it is not easy for the\nsequence-to-sequence model, regardless of whether the early-fusion or\nlate-fusion strategy is applied, to learn the complementary features from the\nsign videos of two vertical views.",

A key challenge is identifying\nwhich interactions govern cononsolvency: coarse-grained analyses like standard\nFlory--Huggins models assume purely isotropic interactions, while atomistic\nsimulations contain complex anisotropic interactions that cannot be precisely\ncontrolled or isolated.

In this study, we show that the ratio of the alpha-relaxation time\nassociated with the relative and center-of-mass coordinate of nearest-neighbor\natomic pairs can effectively characterize the dynamic features of supercooled\nliquids. With this approach, supercooled liquids can be categorized into two\ndistinct 'states' based on their dynamics: solid-like and liquid-like\nbehaviors.

Two of\nthese paths predict a characteristic temperature Tx between Tm and Tg, where a\ncrossover between solid-like and liquid-like behaviors occurs in supercooled\nliquids. The molecular dynamics simulations of several supercooled liquids\nreveal that the actual path followed by all these systems undergo the crossover\nbetween solid-like and liquid-like behaviors. Tx is found to reside in a\nsimilar temperature range as the critical temperature Tc in the mode-coupling\ntheory and the breakdown temperature Tb of the Stokes-Einstein relation.

    "abstract": "The quantum statistics mechanism is very powerful for investigating the\nequilibrium states and the phase transitions in complex spin disorder systems.\nThe spin disorder systems act as an interdisciplinary platform for solving the\noptimum processes in computer science. In this work, I determined the lower\nbound of the computational complexity of knapsack problems. I investigated the\norigin of nontrivial topological structures in these hard problems. It was\nuncovered that the nontrivial topological structures arise from the\ncontradictory between the three-dimensional character of the lattice and the\ntwo-dimensional character of the transfer matrices used in the quantum\nstatistics mechanism. I illustrated a phase diagram for the non-deterministic\npolynomial (NP) vs polynomial (P) problems, in which a NP-intermediate (NPI)\narea exists between the NP-complete problems and the P-problems, while the\nabsolute minimum core model is at the border between the NPI and the\nNP-complete problems. The absolute minimum core model of the knapsack problem\ncannot collapse directly into the P-problem. Under the guide of the results,\none may develop the best algorithms for solving various optimum problems in the\nshortest time, being in subexponential and superpolynomial. This work\nilluminates the road on various fields of science ranging from physics to\nbiology to finances, and to information technologies.",

    "abstract": "The sea surface height budget, obtained by integrating hydrostatic balance\nover the water column, relates sea surface height variations to variations of\nthe seafloor pressure, density in the water column, and atmospheric surface\npressure. This budget is crucial for calibrating and interpreting satellite\naltimetry measurements. It only holds once non-hydrostatic surface gravity\nwaves are averaged out, however, which complicates an observational closure of\nthe budget. Using data from the California Current System, this study\ndemonstrates that the budget closes to within understood uncertainties if GPS\nbuoy measurements of surface height are interpreted as Lagrangian measurements.\nThe buoy largely follows wave motion and spends slightly more time near wave\ncrests than troughs. The associated Stokes offset, which reaches a maximum of\n16 cm in these observations, must be accounted for in the Eulerian sea surface\nheight budget.",

Our analysis identifies\ncritical weaknesses in current LLMs when handling logically valid but\nbelief-conflicting inputs.

    "abstract": "Mainstream approximate action-value iteration reinforcement learning (RL)\nalgorithms suffer from overestimation bias, leading to suboptimal policies in\nhigh-variance stochastic environments. Quantile-based action-value iteration\nmethods reduce this bias by learning a distribution of the expected cost-to-go\nusing quantile regression. However, ensuring that the learned policy satisfies\nsafety constraints remains a challenge when these constraints are not\nexplicitly integrated into the RL framework. Existing methods often require\ncomplex neural architectures or manual tradeoffs due to combined cost\nfunctions. To address this, we propose a risk-regularized quantile-based\nalgorithm integrating Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) to enforce safety\nwithout complex architectures. We also provide theoretical guarantees on the\ncontraction properties of the risk-sensitive distributional Bellman operator in\nWasserstein space, ensuring convergence to a unique cost distribution.\nSimulations of a mobile robot in a dynamic reach-avoid task show that our\napproach leads to more goal successes, fewer collisions, and better\nsafety-performance trade-offs compared to risk-neutral methods.",

    "abstract": "Single-image super-resolution refers to the reconstruction of a\nhigh-resolution image from a single low-resolution observation. Although recent\ndeep learning-based methods have demonstrated notable success on simulated\ndatasets -- with low-resolution images obtained by degrading and downsampling\nhigh-resolution ones -- they frequently fail to generalize to real-world\nsettings, such as document scans, which are affected by complex degradations\nand semantic variability. In this study, we introduce a task-driven, multi-task\nlearning framework for training a super-resolution network specifically\noptimized for optical character recognition tasks. We propose to incorporate\nauxiliary loss functions derived from high-level vision tasks, including text\ndetection using the connectionist text proposal network, text recognition via a\nconvolutional recurrent neural network, keypoints localization using Key.Net,\nand hue consistency. To balance these diverse objectives, we employ dynamic\nweight averaging mechanism, which adaptively adjusts the relative importance of\neach loss term based on its convergence behavior. We validate our approach upon\nthe SRResNet architecture, which is a well-established technique for\nsingle-image super-resolution. Experimental evaluations on both simulated and\nreal-world scanned document datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach\nimproves text detection, measured with intersection over union, while\npreserving overall image fidelity. These findings underscore the value of\nmulti-objective optimization in super-resolution models for bridging the gap\nbetween simulated training regimes and practical deployment in real-world\nscenarios.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in multimodal foundation models unifying image understanding\nand generation have opened exciting avenues for tackling a wide range of\nvision-language tasks within a single framework. Despite progress, existing\nunified models typically require extensive pretraining and struggle to achieve\nthe same level of performance compared to models dedicated to each task.\nAdditionally, many of these models suffer from slow image generation speeds,\nlimiting their practical deployment in real-time or resource-constrained\nsettings. In this work, we propose Layerwise Timestep-Expert Flow-based\nTransformer (LaTtE-Flow), a novel and efficient architecture that unifies image\nunderstanding and generation within a single multimodal model. LaTtE-Flow\nbuilds upon powerful pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to inherit strong\nmultimodal understanding capabilities, and extends them with a novel Layerwise\nTimestep Experts flow-based architecture for efficient image generation.\nLaTtE-Flow distributes the flow-matching process across specialized groups of\nTransformer layers, each responsible for a distinct subset of timesteps. This\ndesign significantly improves sampling efficiency by activating only a small\nsubset of layers at each sampling timestep. To further enhance performance, we\npropose a Timestep-Conditioned Residual Attention mechanism for efficient\ninformation reuse across layers. Experiments demonstrate that LaTtE-Flow\nachieves strong performance on multimodal understanding tasks, while achieving\ncompetitive image generation quality with around 6x faster inference speed\ncompared to recent unified multimodal models.",
