    "abstract": "This study presents a novel physics informed, data-driven modeling framework\nfor capturing the strongly nonlinear thermo-viscoelastic behavior of soft\nmaterials exhibiting stress softening, with emphasis on the Mullins effect.\nUnlike previous approaches limited to quasi-static or isothermal conditions,\nour model unifies rate dependence, temperature sensitivity, large strain cyclic\nloading, and evolving damage mechanisms. Thermodynamic admissibility is ensured\nvia a custom loss function that embeds the Clausius Duhem inequality and\nexplicitly constrains the damage variable for physically realistic softening. A\nTemporal Convolutional Network is trained on high fidelity experimental data\nacross multiple temperatures, strain rates, and stretch levels, enabling the\nmodel to capture rich thermomechanical coupling and history dependence. The\nframework generalizes to unseen thermo mechanical conditions, higher strain\nrates, and larger deformations, and remains robust to input noise. Validation\nagainst finite element simulations using Abaqus/Explicit demonstrates excellent\nagreement under cyclic loading and damage evolution, confirming the surrogate\nmodels effectiveness for advanced simulation workflows.",

This uncertainty, particularly\nresulting from disparities in data formats, frequently necessitates the\ninvolvement of experts to find resolutions. Current methodologies primarily\naddress conflicts related to data structures and schemas, often overlooking the\npivotal role played by data transformation. As the utilization of artificial\nintelligence (AI) continues to expand, there is a growing demand for a more\nstreamlined data preparation process, and data transformation becomes\nparamount. It customizes training data to enhance AI learning efficiency and\nadapts input formats to suit diverse AI models.

The angular\nresolution achieved for these observations ranged from 0.09-0.24 arcseconds,\ncorresponding to ~420-1100 km at Callisto. Global surface properties were\nderived from the observations using a thermophysical model (de Kleer et al.\n2021) constrained by spacecraft data. We find that Callisto's millimeter\nemissivities are high, with representative values of 0.85-0.97, compared to\n0.75-0.85 for Europa and Ganymede at these wavelengths. It is clear that models\nparameterized by a single thermal inertia are not sufficient to model\nCallisto's thermal emission, and clearly deviate from the temperature\ndistributions in the data in systematic ways. Rather, more complex models that\nadopt either two thermal inertia components or that treat electrical skin depth\nas a free parameter fit the data more accurately than single thermal inertia\nmodels. Residuals from the global best-fit models reveal thermal anomalies; in\nparticular, brightness temperatures that are locally 3-5 K colder than\nsurrounding terrain are associated with impact craters. We identify the\nValhalla impact basin and a suite of large craters, including Lofn, as key cold\nanomalies (~3-5 K) and geologic features of interest in these data.

A vanity address is\nan address that embeds custom characters such as a name. To generate a vanity\naddress, a classical try-and-error method is employed, and thus the number of\ncharacters to be embedded is limited. In this paper, we focus on the\nfunctionality of identity-based signatures (IBS) where any strings can be\nemployed as a verification key, and explore whether IBS can be used for\ngenerating a vanity address. We attach importance to the fact that it is not\nrealistic to replace ECDSA with key recovery, which is currently employed for\nissuing transactions in Ethereum, to an IBS scheme. Even if this replacement is\npossible, it is not a reasonable price for the ease of the vanity address\ngeneration. Thus, we pay attention to a generic construction of IBS from\nsignatures, and construct an IBS scheme from ECDSA with key recovery. Though we\ncannot directly generate a vanity address due to the key recovery functionality\nof the underlying ECDSA, we can connect any string with an address due to the\nfunctionality of IBS that can give additional meaning to the address. We\nimplement our system by Solidity, and demonstrate that the gas cost is almost\nsame as that of the ECDSA signature verification.",

    "abstract": "Visualization of large-scale time-dependent simulation data is crucial for\ndomain scientists to analyze complex phenomena, but it demands significant I/O\nbandwidth, storage, and computational resources. To enable effective\nvisualization on local, low-end machines, recent advances in view synthesis\ntechniques, such as neural radiance fields, utilize neural networks to generate\nnovel visualizations for volumetric scenes. However, these methods focus on\nreconstruction quality rather than facilitating interactive visualization\nexploration, such as feature extraction and tracking. We introduce VolSegGS, a\nnovel Gaussian splatting framework that supports interactive segmentation and\ntracking in dynamic volumetric scenes for exploratory visualization and\nanalysis. Our approach utilizes deformable 3D Gaussians to represent a dynamic\nvolumetric scene, allowing for real-time novel view synthesis. For accurate\nsegmentation, we leverage the view-independent colors of Gaussians for\ncoarse-level segmentation and refine the results with an affinity field network\nfor fine-level segmentation. Additionally, by embedding segmentation results\nwithin the Gaussians, we ensure that their deformation enables continuous\ntracking of segmented regions over time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of\nVolSegGS with several time-varying datasets and compare our solutions against\nstate-of-the-art methods. With the ability to interact with a dynamic scene in\nreal time and provide flexible segmentation and tracking capabilities, VolSegGS\noffers a powerful solution under low computational demands.

Second,\nthe direct application of gradient learning to the joint loss function can\nincur high computation overheads due to second-order derivative approximation.\nTo tackle these challenges, we propose a new Pareto Optimality Gradient\nMatching (POGM) method. In contrast to existing methods that add gradient\nmatching as regularization, we leverage gradient trajectories as collected data\nand apply independent training at the meta-learner. In the meta-update, we\nmaximize GIP while limiting the learned gradient from deviating too far from\nthe empirical risk minimization gradient trajectory.

Retinal\nphenotypes were quantified using automated image analysis tools, while serum\nlipid profiling was performed by Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatography\nElectrospray ionization High resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC ESI HRMS).\nStrong, age- and sex-independent correlations were established, particularly\nbetween average artery width, vessel density, and lipid subclasses such as\ntriacylglycerols (TAGs), diacylglycerols (DAGs), and ceramides (Cers). These\nassociations suggest a converging mechanism of microvascular remodeling under\nmetabolic stress. By linking detailed\n  vascular structural phenotypes to specific lipid species, this study fills a\ncritical gap in the understanding of early CVD pathogenesis. This integration\nnot only offers a novel perspective on microvascular metabolic associations but\nalso presents a significant opportunity for the identification of robust,\nnon-invasive biomarkers. Ultimately, these findings may support improved early\ndetection, targeted prevention, and personalized approaches in cardiovascular\nhealthcare.",

Additionally, we propose an adaptive AF that takes the form\nof a linear combination of standard AFs, which improves both the robustness and\naccuracy of the model. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that our\nmethod achieves an average of 40% reduction in relative L2 error and an average\nof 50% reduction in mean absolute error in the extrapolation domain, all\nwithout a significant increase in computational cost.

We combine\nthe motion, magnetic flux, and activity duration of the flux tubes to estimate\nthe energy content carried by individual Alfvenic pulses, which is ~10+25 erg,\nadequately higher than the energies ~10+23 erg estimated for the magnetic\nswitchbacks observed by the Parker Solar Probe (PSP). This implies the\npossibility that the surface-generated Alfvenic pulses could reach the solar\nwind with sufficient energy to generate switchbacks, even though some of then\nare expected to be reflected back in the stratified solar atmosphere.

    "abstract": "Spicules, the smallest observable jet-like dynamic features ubiquitous in the\nchromosphere, are supposedly an important potential source for small-scale\nsolar wind transients, with supporting evidence yet needed. We studied the\nhigh-resolution H-alpha images (0.10'') and magnetograms (0.29'') from Big Bear\nSolar Observatory (BBSO) to find that spicules are an ideal candidate for the\nsolar wind magnetic switchbacks detected by the Parker Solar Probe (PSP). It is\nnot that spicules are a miniature of coronal jets, but that they have unique\nproperties not found in other solar candidates in explaining solar origin of\nswitchbacks. (1) The spicules under this study originate from filigrees, all in\na single magnetic polarity. Since filigrees are known as footpoints of open\nfields, the spicule guiding field lines can form a unipolar funnel, which is\nneeded to create an SB patch, a group of fieldlines that switch from one common\nbase polarity to the other polarity. (2) The spicules come in a cluster lined\nup along a supergranulation boundary, and the simulated waiting times from\ntheir spatial intervals exhibit a number distribution continuously decreasing\nfrom a few sec to ~30 min, similar to that of switchbacks. (3) From a\ntime-distance map for spicules, we estimate their occurrence rate as 0.55\nspicules per Mm^2 and second, sufficiently high for detection by PSP. In\naddition the dissimilarity of spicules with coronal jets, including the absence\nof base brightening and low correlation with EUV emission is briefly discussed.",

    "abstract": "Platform trials evaluate multiple experimental treatments against a common\ncontrol group (and/or against each other), which often reduces the trial\nduration and sample size. Bayesian platform designs offer several practical\nadvantages, including the flexible addition or removal of experimental arms\nusing posterior probabilities and the incorporation of prior/external\ninformation. Regulatory agencies require that the operating characteristics of\nBayesian designs are assessed by estimating the sampling distribution of\nposterior probabilities via Monte Carlo simulation. It is computationally\nintensive to repeat this simulation process for all design configurations\nconsidered, particularly for platform trials with complex interim decision\nprocedures. In this paper, we propose an efficient method to assess operating\ncharacteristics and determine sample sizes as well as other design parameters\nfor Bayesian platform trials. We prove theoretical results that allow us to\nmodel the joint sampling distribution of posterior probabilities across\nmultiple endpoints and trial stages using simulations conducted at only two\nsample sizes.

    "abstract": "The increasing need for accurate and unified analysis of diverse biological\nsignals, such as ECG and EEG, is paramount for comprehensive patient\nassessment, especially in synchronous monitoring. Despite advances in\nmulti-sensor fusion, a critical gap remains in developing unified architectures\nthat effectively process and extract features from fundamentally different\nphysiological signals. Another challenge is the inherent class imbalance in\nmany biomedical datasets, often causing biased performance in traditional\nmethods. This study addresses these issues by proposing a novel and unified\ndeep learning framework that achieves state-of-the-art performance across\ndifferent signal types. Our method integrates a ResNet-based CNN with an\nattention mechanism, enhanced by a novel data augmentation strategy:\ntime-domain concatenation of multiple augmented variants of each signal to\ngenerate richer representations. Unlike prior work, we scientifically increase\nsignal complexity to achieve future-reaching capabilities, which resulted in\nthe best predictions compared to the state of the art. Preprocessing steps\nincluded wavelet denoising, baseline removal, and standardization. Class\nimbalance was effectively managed through the combined use of this advanced\ndata augmentation and the Focal Loss function. Regularization techniques were\napplied during training to ensure generalization. We rigorously evaluated the\nproposed architecture on three benchmark datasets: UCI Seizure EEG, MIT-BIH\nArrhythmia, and PTB Diagnostic ECG. It achieved accuracies of 99.96%, 99.78%,\nand 100%, respectively, demonstrating robustness across diverse signal types\nand clinical contexts.

However, spectral jitter, often induced by charge noise in\nepitaxial quantum dots, leads to exciton dephasing, thereby limiting their\npractical usage in quantum applications. We present a straightforward approach\nto mitigate charge noise-induced decoherence in droplet-etched GaAs quantum\ndots embedded in an n-i-p diode structure and integrated deterministically into\nan electrically contacted circular Bragg grating resonator for emission\nenhancement. The quantum device allows for the stabilization of the charge\nenvironment by applying an external electrical field while producing a photon\nextraction efficiency of approximately (37 +- 2)%. Hong-Ou-Mandel two-photon\ninterference measurements reveal a strong voltage dependence of the exciton\ndephasing time and interference visibility on the applied bias in excellent\nagreement with our theoretical predictions. Notably, the reduction in\nvisibility from a maximum, charge-stabilized corrected value of 97 percent at\nthe optimum bias point follows an inverse square dependence (proportional to\n1/I^2) with increasing diode current (I) in forward direction. Under a\nquasi-resonant excitation scheme, we achieve a maximum exciton dephasing time\n(T2*) of approximately (6.8 +-0.5) ns, reaching nearly the Fourier limit (T2 =\n2T1) without the need for complex echo schemes like Ramsey or\nCarr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill sequences.

The algorithm consists of three\nloosely-coupled components: a semantics-preserving vectorisation code\ntransformation (the bulk-operation transform or BOT), a fairly straightforward\nlifting of the basic dual-numbers reverse AD algorithm to a mostly first-order\narray language, and symbolic interpretation to achieve an end-to-end\ncompilation pipeline. Unfortunately, we lose some of the nice generalisable\naspects of dual-numbers AD in the process, most importantly support for\nhigher-order code.\n  We do support some higher-order array combinators, but only a\ncarefully-chosen set: 'build' (elementwise array construction), 'gather' and\n'scatter'. In return, the BOT can eliminate the essential (for AD)\nhigher-orderness of the input program, meaning that AD gets essentially\npresented with a first-order program. This allows the naive trick of lifting\ndual numbers to \"dual arrays\" to work without much modification.",

Three main temporal regions of interest\nare identified for fine time-resolution spectral analysis: triggering pulse,\nmain emission, and late emission, and the parameter evolution is traced across\nthese regions. The high flux of the burst allowed for the statistical\npreference of a more complex, physically-motivated model, the Double Smoothly\nBroken Power Law, over typical spectral fitting functions for GRBs. From this\nmodel the evolution of the parameters was found to be in accordance with those\nexpected for synchrotron radiation in the fast-cooling regime.

This\nwork aimed to achieve 'clinical mode' qMRI, by real-time, inline parameter\nestimation with a trained neural network (NN) fully integrated into a vendor's\nimage reconstruction environment, therefore facilitating and encouraging\nclinical adoption of advanced qMRI techniques. Methods: The Siemens Image\nCalculation Environment (ICE) pipeline was customised to deploy trained NNs for\nadvanced diffusion MRI parameter estimation with Open Neural Network Exchange\n(ONNX) Runtime. Two fully-connected NNs were trained offline with data\nsynthesised with the neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI)\nmodel, using either conventionally estimated (NNMLE) or ground truth (NNGT)\nparameters as training labels. The strategy was demonstrated online with an in\nvivo acquisition and evaluated offline with synthetic test data. Results: NNs\nwere successfully integrated and deployed natively in ICE, performing inline,\nwhole-brain, in vivo NODDI parameter estimation in <10 seconds. DICOM\nparametric maps were exported from the scanner for further analysis, generally\nfinding that NNMLE estimates were more consistent than NNGT with conventional\nestimates. Offline evaluation confirms that NNMLE has comparable accuracy and\nslightly better noise robustness than conventional fitting, whereas NNGT\nexhibits compromised accuracy at the benefit of higher noise robustness.\nConclusion: Real-time, inline parameter estimation with the proposed\ngeneralisable framework resolves a key practical barrier to clinical uptake of\nadvanced qMRI methods and enables their efficient integration into clinical\nworkflows.",

Motivated by ideas from Classification Theory, we\nseparate this conjecture into two parts: 1) stability over P (a structure\nproperty of theories) implies the Gaifman property, and 2) instability over P\nimplies non-structure. In this paper prove the first part of this conjecture.\nIn fact, we prove a stronger statement: an appropriate version of stability\nimplies higher stable amalgamation properties.",

    "abstract": "Channel estimation is crucial in wireless communications. However, in many\npapers neural networks are frequently tested by training and testing on one\nexample channel or similar channels. This is because data-driven methods often\ndegrade on new data which they are not trained on, as they cannot extrapolate\ntheir training knowledge. This is despite the fact physical channels are often\nassumed to be time-variant. However, due to the low latency requirements and\nlimited computing resources, neural networks may not have enough time and\ncomputing resources to execute online training to fine-tune the parameters.\nThis motivates us to design offline-trained neural networks that can perform\nrobustly over wireless channels, but without any actual channel information\nbeing known at design time. In this paper, we propose design criteria to\ngenerate synthetic training datasets for neural networks, which guarantee that\nafter training the resulting networks achieve a certain mean squared error\n(MSE) on new and previously unseen channels. Therefore, trained neural networks\nrequire no prior channel information or parameters update for real-world\nimplementations. Based on the proposed design criteria, we further propose a\nbenchmark design which ensures intelligent operation for different channel\nprofiles. To demonstrate general applicability, we use neural networks with\ndifferent levels of complexity to show that the generalization achieved appears\nto be independent of neural network architecture. From simulations, neural\nnetworks achieve robust generalization to wireless channels with both fixed\nchannel profiles and variable delay spreads.",

First, we introduce Masking-Augmented gaussian Diffusion\n(MAgD), a novel training strategy with dual corruption process which combines\nstandard denoising score matching and masked reconstruction by masking noisy\ninput from forward process. MAgD encourages the model to learn discriminative\nand compositional visual representations, thus enabling localized and\nstructure-aware editing. Second, we introduce an inference-time capacity\nscaling mechanism based on Pause Tokens, which act as special placeholders\ninserted into the prompt for increasing computational capacity at inference\ntime. Our findings show that adopting expressive and dense prompts during\ntraining further enhances performance, particularly for MAgD.

Since there\ncould be an exponential number of object-action combinations, labeled data is\nlimited - leading to a long-tail distribution problem. Recently, zero-shot\nlearning emerged as a solution, with end-to-end transformer-based object\ndetectors adapted for HOID becoming successful frameworks. However, their\nprimary focus is designing improved decoders for learning entangled or\ndisentangled interpretations of interactions. We advocate that HOI-specific\ncues must be anticipated at the encoder stage itself to obtain a stronger scene\ninterpretation. Consequently, we build a top-down framework named Funnel-HOI\ninspired by the human tendency to grasp well-defined concepts first and then\nassociate them with abstract concepts during scene understanding. We first\nprobe an image for the presence of objects (well-defined concepts) and then\nprobe for actions (abstract concepts) associated with them. A novel asymmetric\nco-attention mechanism mines these cues utilizing multimodal information\n(incorporating zero-shot capabilities) and yields stronger interaction\nrepresentations at the encoder level. Furthermore, a novel loss is devised that\nconsiders objectaction relatedness and regulates misclassification penalty\nbetter than existing loss functions for guiding the interaction classifier.\nExtensive experiments on the HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets across\nfully-supervised and six zero-shot settings reveal our state-of-the-art\nperformance, with up to 12.4% and 8.4% gains for unseen and rare HOI\ncategories, respectively.",

The\nresulting high-precision transmission spectrum robustly detects both CH4 and\nCO2, precisely measuring their abundances and firmly establishing the planet's\nwater-rich nature: either a thick envelope with >10% H2O by volume or a thin\natmosphere above a liquid-water ocean. The spectrum reveals no detectable H2O,\nNH3, or CO. The absence of atmospheric water vapor suggests an efficient cold\ntrap, while the nondetections of NH3 and CO support the scenario of a small\nH2-rich atmosphere overlying a liquid reservoir. However, alternative models\nthat include these gases can also reproduce the spectrum within uncertainties,\nhighlighting the need for deeper observations. The spectrum only contains\nmarginal signals of DMS, methyl mercaptan (CH3SH), and nitrous oxide (N2O),\nwith none exceeding 3 sigma in model preference and all falling below ~2 sigma\nwithout imposing a strong super-Rayleigh haze. Meanwhile, our self-consistent\nphotochemical models show that DMS and CH3SH may form abiotically in massive\nH2-rich atmospheres of high metallicity, making it important to consider\nadditional indicators for their potential use as biosignatures. K2-18 b, a\ncool, water-rich world, stands out as one of the most promising temperate\nsub-Neptunes for exploring the emergence of liquid-water environments in\nnon-Earth-like planets, motivating further characterization of its atmosphere\nand interior.",

Although novel view synthesis approaches enhance rendering efficiency,\nthey require additional learning effort for non-experts and lack support for\nsemantic-level interaction. To bridge this gap, we propose NLI4VolVis, an\ninteractive system that enables users to explore, query, and edit volumetric\nscenes using natural language. NLI4VolVis integrates multi-view semantic\nsegmentation and vision-language models to extract and understand semantic\ncomponents in a scene. We introduce a multi-agent large language model\narchitecture equipped with extensive function-calling tools to interpret user\nintents and execute visualization tasks. The agents leverage external tools and\ndeclarative VolVis commands to interact with the VolVis engine powered by 3D\neditable Gaussians, enabling open-vocabulary object querying, real-time scene\nediting, best-view selection, and 2D stylization. We validate our system\nthrough case studies and a user study, highlighting its improved accessibility\nand usability in volumetric data exploration.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a cornerstone of modern AI, driving\nbreakthroughs in natural language processing and expanding into multimodal jobs\ninvolving images, audio, and video. As with most computational software, it is\nimportant to distinguish between ordinary runtime performance and startup\noverhead. Prior research has focused on runtime performance: improving training\nefficiency and stability. This work focuses instead on the increasingly\ncritical issue of startup overhead in training: the delay before training jobs\nbegin execution. Startup overhead is particularly important in large,\nindustrial-scale LLMs, where failures occur more frequently and multiple teams\noperate in iterative update-debug cycles. In one of our training clusters, more\nthan 3.5% of GPU time is wasted due to startup overhead alone.\n  In this work, we present the first in-depth characterization of LLM training\nstartup overhead based on real production data. We analyze the components of\nstartup cost, quantify its direct impact, and examine how it scales with job\nsize. These insights motivate the design of Bootseer, a system-level\noptimization framework that addresses three primary startup bottlenecks: (a)\ncontainer image loading, (b) runtime dependency installation, and (c) model\ncheckpoint resumption. To mitigate these bottlenecks, Bootseer introduces three\ntechniques: (a) hot block record-and-prefetch, (b) dependency snapshotting, and\n(c) striped HDFS-FUSE. Bootseer has been deployed in a production environment\nand evaluated on real LLM training workloads, demonstrating a 50% reduction in\nstartup overhead.",

The dynamics are analyzed using a beam with clamped\nboundaries, a string model, and a beam with hinged boundaries. The range of\nvalidity for the different models is quantified in detail. A hinged beam model\nis found to provide an accurate description, with insightful closed-form\nanalytical expressions, over a wide range of conditions.

We present MS-DGCNN++, a hierarchical multiscale fusion\ndynamic graph convolutional network that uses semantically meaningful feature\nextraction at local, branch, and canopy scales with cross-scale information\npropagation. Our method employs scale-specific feature engineering, including\nstandard geometric features for the local scale, normalized relative vectors\nfor the branch scale, and distance information for the canopy scale. This\nhierarchical approach replaces uniform parallel processing with semantically\ndifferentiated representations that are aligned with the natural tree\nstructure. Under the same proposed tree species data augmentation strategy for\nall experiments, MS-DGCNN++ achieved an accuracy of 94.96 \\% on STPCTLS,\noutperforming DGCNN, MS-DGCNN, and the state-of-the-art model PPT.

    "abstract": "Crop mapping involves identifying and classifying crop types using spatial\ndata, primarily derived from remote sensing imagery. This study presents the\nfirst comprehensive review of large-scale, pixel-wise crop mapping workflows,\nencompassing both conventional supervised methods and emerging transfer\nlearning approaches. To identify the optimal time-series generation approaches\nand supervised crop mapping models, we conducted systematic experiments,\ncomparing six widely adopted satellite image-based preprocessing methods,\nalongside eleven supervised pixel-wise classification models. Additionally, we\nassessed the synergistic impact of varied training sample sizes and variable\ncombinations. Moreover, we identified optimal transfer learning techniques for\ndifferent magnitudes of domain shift. The evaluation of optimal methods was\nconducted across five diverse agricultural sites. Landsat 8 served as the\nprimary satellite data source. Labels come from CDL trusted pixels and field\nsurveys.\n  Our findings reveal three key insights. First, fine-scale interval\npreprocessing paired with Transformer models consistently delivered optimal\nperformance for both supervised and transferable workflows. RF offered rapid\ntraining and competitive performance in conventional supervised learning and\ndirect transfer to similar domains. Second, transfer learning techniques\nenhanced workflow adaptability, with UDA being effective for homogeneous crop\nclasses while fine-tuning remains robust across diverse scenarios. Finally,\nworkflow choice depends heavily on the availability of labeled samples. With a\nsufficient sample size, supervised training typically delivers more accurate\nand generalizable results. Below a certain threshold, transfer learning that\nmatches the level of domain shift is a viable alternative to achieve crop\nmapping. All code is publicly available to encourage reproducibility practice.",

Despite great progress, current experimental implementations\nof $2+1$D lattice gauge theories are mostly restricted to relatively small\nsystem sizes and two-level representations of the gauge and electric fields.\nHere, we propose a resource-efficient method for quantum simulating $2+1$D\nspin-$S$ $\\mathrm{U}(1)$ quantum link lattice gauge theories with dynamical\nmatter using qudit-based quantum processors. By integrating out the matter\nfields through Gauss's law, we reformulate the quantum link model in a purely\nspin picture compatible with qudit encoding across arbitrary spatial\ndimensions, eliminating the need for ancillary qubits and reducing resource\noverhead. Focusing first on the spin-$1/2$ case, we construct explicit circuits\nfor the full Hamiltonian and demonstrate through numerical simulations that the\nfirst-order Trotterized circuits accurately capture the quench dynamics even in\nthe presence of realistic noise levels. Additionally, we introduce a general\nmethod for constructing coupling-term circuits for higher-spin representations\n$S>1/2$.

Here, we re-examine the\nattractiveness-driven interaction model, an agent-based framework where\npoint-like agents move randomly in a 2D arena and exhibit varied social appeal,\nleading them to pause near highly attractive celebrity peers. We compare this\nmodel to a null model where the agents are continuously in movement, which\nresembles a Random Geometric Graph. Our extensive simulations reveal\nsignificant structural and dynamic differences: unlike the null model, the\nattractiveness-driven model's average degree increases linearly with system\nsize for fixed density, resulting in more compact groups and the suppression of\na percolation transition. Crucially, while the null model's group size\ndistribution is either exponentially decaying or bimodal, the\nattractiveness-driven model robustly exhibits a power-law distribution, $P(n)\n\\propto n^{-2.5}$, with an exponent independent of density.

In this\npaper, we consider the zero forcing model for information diffusion on\niterative deterministic complex network models. In particular, we continue the\nexploration of the Iterative Local Transitive (ILT) model and the Iterative\nLocal Anti-Transitive (ILAT) model, both introduced by Bonato et. al. in 2009\nand 2017, respectively. These models use ideas from Structural Balance Theory\nto generate edges through a notion of cloning where ``the friend of my friend\nis my friend'' and anticloning where ``the enemy of my enemy is my friend.''\n  Zero forcing, introduced independently by Burgarth and Giovanetti and a\nspecial working group at AIM in 2007 and 2008, begins with some set of forced\nvertices, the remaining are unforced. If a forced vertex has a single unforced\nneighbor, that neighbor becomes forced. The minimum number of vertices in a\nstarting set required to guarantee all vertices eventually become forced is the\nzero forcing number of the graph. The maximum number of vertices in a starting\nset such that the graph cannot become fully forced is the failed zero forcing\nnumber of a graph. In this paper we provide bounds for both the zero forcing\nand failed zero forcing number of graphs created using both the ILT and ILAT\nmodels. In particular, we show that in the case of ILAT graphs the failed zero\nforcing number can only take on one of four values, dependent on the number of\nvertices of the graph.

    "abstract": "Accurate modeling and control of autonomous vehicles remain a fundamental\nchallenge due to the nonlinear and coupled nature of vehicle dynamics. While\nKoopman operator theory offers a framework for deploying powerful linear\ncontrol techniques, learning a finite-dimensional invariant subspace for\nhigh-fidelity modeling continues to be an open problem. This paper presents a\ndeep Koopman approach for modeling and control of vehicle dynamics within the\ncurvilinear Frenet frame. The proposed framework uses a deep neural network\narchitecture to simultaneously learn the Koopman operator and its associated\ninvariant subspace from the data. Input-state bilinear interactions are\ncaptured by the algorithm while preserving convexity, which makes it suitable\nfor real-time model predictive control (MPC) application. A multi-step\nprediction loss is utilized during training to ensure long-horizon prediction\ncapability. To further enhance real-time trajectory tracking performance, the\nmodel is integrated with a cumulative error regulator (CER) module, which\ncompensates for model mismatch by mitigating accumulated prediction errors.\nClosed-loop performance is evaluated through hardware-in-the-loop (HIL)\nexperiments using a CarSim RT model as the target plant, with real-time\nvalidation conducted on a dSPACE SCALEXIO system. The proposed controller\nachieved significant reductions in tracking error relative to baseline\ncontrollers, confirming its suitability for real-time implementation in\nembedded autonomous vehicle systems.",

Among many approaches explored in literature, the\nfusion of classifiers has been showing good results and is getting growing\nattention. DS methods, due to the ensemble being instance-based, seem to be an\nefficient choice under drifting scenarios. However, some attention must be paid\nto adapting such methods for concept drift. The training must be done in order\nto create local experts, and the commonly used neighborhood-search DS may\nbecome prohibitive with the continuous arrival of data. In this work, we\npropose IncA-DES, which employs a training strategy that promotes the\ngeneration of local experts with the assumption that different regions of the\nfeature space become available with time. Additionally, the fusion of a concept\ndrift detector supports the maintenance of information and adaptation to a new\nconcept. An overlap-based classification filter is also employed in order to\navoid using the DS method when there is a consensus in the neighborhood, a\nstrategy that we argue every DS method should employ, as it was shown to make\nthem more applicable and quicker. Moreover, aiming to reduce the processing\ntime of the kNN, we propose an Online K-d tree algorithm, which can quickly\nremove instances without becoming inconsistent and deals with unbalancing\nconcerns that may occur in data streams. Experimental results showed that the\nproposed framework got the best average accuracy compared to seven\nstate-of-the-art methods considering different levels of label availability and\npresented the smaller processing time between the most accurate methods.\nAdditionally, the fusion with the Online K-d tree has improved processing time\nwith a negligible loss in accuracy.

To address these\nchallenges, our key idea is to embed a new visual parameter space into a\npre-trained LLM, enabling stable learning of visual knowledge from noisy data\nvia delta tuning. Based on this principle, we first introduce Mono-InternVL, an\nadvanced monolithic MLLM that incorporates a set of visual experts through a\nmultimodal mixture-of-experts architecture. In addition, we design an\ninnovative Endogenous Visual Pre-training (EViP) for Mono-InternVL to maximize\nits visual capabilities via progressive learning. Mono-InternVL achieves\ncompetitive performance against existing MLLMs but also leads to relatively\nexpensive data cost. Therefore, we further present Mono-InternVL-1.5, a cheaper\nand stronger monolithic MLLM equipped with an improved EViP (EViP++). EViP++\nintroduces additional visual attention experts to Mono-InternVL-1.5 and\nre-organizes the pre-training process in an efficient manner. During inference,\nit includes a fused CUDA kernel to speed up its MoE operations. With these\ndesigns, Mono-InternVL-1.5 significantly reduces training and inference costs,\nwhile still maintaining competitive performance with Mono-InternVL. To evaluate\nour approach, we conduct extensive experiments across 15 benchmarks. Results\ndemonstrate that Mono-InternVL outperforms existing monolithic MLLMs on 12 out\nof 15 benchmarks, e.g., +114-point improvement over Emu3 on OCRBench. Compared\nto its modular counterpart, i.e., InternVL-1.5, Mono-InternVL-1.5 achieves\nsimilar multimodal performance while reducing first-token latency by up to 69%.\nCode and models are released at https://github.com/OpenGVLab/Mono-InternVL.",

The\ntransition is found to involve both diffusive and diffusionless mechanisms.\nNucleation of 1T$^\\prime$ phase is initiated by the coalescence of neighboring\nTe monovacancies into divacancies, which are found to be mobile and can\ninteract with other Te vacancies to form small triangular 1T$^\\prime$ islands.\nGrowth of these islands proceeds either by incorporating pre-existing vacancies\nat the phase boundaries or, in their absence, by absorbing divacancies that\nmigrate from the surrounding lattice. Once a critical island size is reached,\nvacancy-free growth becomes possible although with a higher activation barrier.\nUpon removal of external stimuli, the system reverts to 2H phase, during which\nTe vacancies reorganize into three-fold spoke-like vacancy lines at the island\ncenter.

    "abstract": "Relational databases (RDBs) are ubiquitous in enterprise and real-world\napplications. Flattening the database poses challenges for deep learning models\nthat rely on fixed-size input representations to capture relational semantics\nfrom the structured nature of relational data. Graph neural networks (GNNs)\nhave been proposed to address this, but they often oversimplify relational\nstructures by modeling all the tuples as monolithic nodes and ignoring\nintra-tuple associations. In this work, we propose a novel hypergraph-based\nframework, that we call rel-HNN, which models each unique attribute-value pair\nas a node and each tuple as a hyperedge, enabling the capture of fine-grained\nintra-tuple relationships. Our approach learns explicit multi-level\nrepresentations across attribute-value, tuple, and table levels. To address the\nscalability challenges posed by large RDBs, we further introduce a\nsplit-parallel training algorithm that leverages multi-GPU execution for\nefficient hypergraph learning. Extensive experiments on real-world and\nbenchmark datasets demonstrate that rel-HNN significantly outperforms existing\nmethods in both classification and regression tasks. Moreover, our\nsplit-parallel training achieves substantial speedups -- up to 3.18x for\nlearning on relational data and up to 2.94x for hypergraph learning -- compared\nto conventional single-GPU execution.",

    "abstract": "Double periodic variables (DPVs) are a group of semi-detached interacting\nbinaries that exhibit a long photometric cycle with an average length of\n$\\sim33$ times the orbital period of the system. It has been proposed that this\nlong photometric cycle originates from a modulated mass transfer rate from the\ndonor star, which itself is driven by an internal magnetic dynamo. One of the\nmost well-studied DPVs in the Milky Way is AU Monocerotis (AU Mon). We aim to\nenhance our understanding of the long photometric cycle in AU Mon by\ncharacterising its behaviour through the analysis of available photometric data\nfrom several databases and surveys. We summarise previous findings on the\nsystem and analyse its published multi-wavelength photometry from different\nsources, covering 46.3 years, to study the variability of its light curve. We\nfind that the orbital period has remained constant over recent decades, but the\nlong cycle of approximately 417 days vanished around 2010. From an O-C\nanalysis, we conclude that the system is experiencing a change in its orbital\nperiod of no greater than $0.038\\pm0.040$ s yr$^{-1}$, and thus, imposing a\nvalue of $2\\times10^{-8}$ M$_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ for $\\dot{M}$ in a fully\nconservative mass transfer regime. A time-series analysis of the disentangling\nlight curve in the Ic filter shows a transient periodicity of approximately\n1910 days lasting at least 2000 days before it also disappears around the year\n2020. An analysis of the available APASS light curves around the year 2013\nshows a strong periodicity at approximately 280 days, which appears to be\nstronger in the Z filter. We report what is the second observation of the\nsudden disappearance of the long cycle in a DPV, after the Galactic DPV TYC\n5353-1137-1. The disappearance of the long cycle in AU Mon is a strong\nconstraint for current models that aim to explain the long cycle in DPVs.",

By decoupling part-scale thermal behavior\nfrom small-scale melt pool physics, the controller provides a scale-agnostic\nprediction of melt pool area and efficient optimization over it.

Results\nshowed that feedforward vector-level laser power scheduling reduced geometric\ninaccuracy in key dimensions by 62%, overall porosity by 16.5%, and photodiode\nvariation by 6.8% on average.

In order to reliably accomplish these\ntasks, LMs must be able to discern the modal category of a sentence (i.e.,\nwhether it describes something that is possible, impossible, completely\nnonsensical, etc.). However, recent studies have called into question the\nability of LMs to categorize sentences according to modality (Michaelov et al.,\n2025; Kauf et al., 2023). In this work, we identify linear representations that\ndiscriminate between modal categories within a variety of LMs, or modal\ndifference vectors. Analysis of modal difference vectors reveals that LMs have\naccess to more reliable modal categorization judgments than previously\nreported. Furthermore, we find that modal difference vectors emerge in a\nconsistent order as models become more competent (i.e., through training steps,\nlayers, and parameter count). Notably, we find that modal difference vectors\nidentified within LM activations can be used to model fine-grained human\ncategorization behavior. This potentially provides a novel view into how human\nparticipants distinguish between modal categories, which we explore by\ncorrelating projections along modal difference vectors with human participants'\nratings of interpretable features. In summary, we derive new insights into LM\nmodal categorization using techniques from mechanistic interpretability, with\nthe potential to inform our understanding of modal categorization in humans.",

While the standard disk and corona model can somewhat describe\nthis emission, it fails to predict specific features such as the soft X-ray\nexcess, the short-term optical/UV variability, and the observed UV/X-ray\ncorrelation in AGN. In this context, the fraction of AGN emission in different\nbands (i.e., bolometric corrections) can be useful to better understand the\naccretion physics of AGN. Past studies have shown that the X-ray bolometric\ncorrections are strongly dependent on the physical properties of AGN, such as\ntheir luminosities and Eddington ratios. However, since these two parameters\ndepend on each other, it has been unclear which is the main driver of the X-ray\nbolometric corrections. We present here results from a large study of hard\nX-ray-selected (14-195 keV) nearby ($z<0.1$) AGN. Based on our systematic\nanalysis of the simultaneous optical-to-X-ray spectral energy distributions of\n236 unobscured AGN, we found that the primary parameter controlling the X-ray\nbolometric corrections is the Eddington ratio. Our results show that while the\nX-ray bolometric correction increases with the bolometric luminosity for\nsources with intermediate Eddington ratios ($0.01-1$), this dependence vanishes\nfor sources with lower Eddington ratios ($<0.01$). This could be used as\nevidence for a change in the accretion physics of AGN at low Eddington ratios.",

We obtained broadband spectro-polarimetric $1-8$\nGHz Very Large Array observation of the lensing system B1600+434, which is a\nbackground quasar gravitationally lensed by a foreground spiral galaxy into two\nimages. We apply Rotation Measure (RM) synthesis and Stokes $QU$ fitting to\nderive the RM of the two lensed images, which we use to estimate the lensing\ngalaxy's magnetic field. We measured the RM difference between the lensed\nimages, and detected Faraday dispersion caused by the magneto-ionic medium of\nthe lensing galaxy at $z=0.414$. Assuming that the RM difference is due to the\nlarge-scale regular field of the galaxy's halo, we measure a coherent magnetic\nfield with a strength of $0.2 - 3.0\\,\\mu$G at 0.7 kpc, and $0.01 - 2.8 \\,\\mu$G\nat 6.2 kpc vertical distance from the disk of the galaxy.

If the RM difference is due\nto large-scale fields, our result follows the expectation from mean-field\ndynamo theory, and shows that galaxies at $z \\simeq 0.4$ already have magnetic\nfield strengths similar to present-day galaxies.

This study is based on\nthe asymptotic giant branch (AGB) scenario and incorporates photoionization\nfeedback and stellar winds from AGB stars. We model SG formation within a young\n($34$ Myr) massive ($10^6 $ Msun) proto-GC moving through a magnetized,\nhomogeneous interstellar medium. Our results indicate that variations in\nmagnetic field strength and orientation significantly influence the gas\ngeometry and SG star-forming regions around the cluster. Overall, magnetic\nfields limit SG formation to the very center of the cluster, with stronger\nmagnetic fields tending to form more compact SG clusters. For magnetic field\nstrengths of $0.5$ and $5$ microG, we observe no substantial changes in the\nmass of formed SG stars. However, with a strong $50$ microG field, we see a\n$25$ percent increase or a $70$ percent decrease in total SG mass, for a field\naligned parallel or perpendicular to the cluster's motion, respectively. This\nvariation reflects how magnetic fields influence gas accretion, as our results\nsuggest that gas accreted from the interstellar medium (ISM) slightly dominates\nover AGB ejecta in the cluster, except in cases of strong perpendicular fields,\nwhere gas accretion is efficiently suppressed. Additionally, stronger magnetic\nfields limit the cluster's ability to retain its ejecta, leading to the\nformation of stars with lower helium abundances.

The\nintegrated galaxy-wide IMF (IGIMF) theory, which incorporates variations in\nstellar populations due to star formation history (SFH) and metallicity,\nprovides a more accurate framework for understanding systematic deviations in\ngalaxy scaling relations than that given by an invariant gwIMF. By considering\nhow the mass-to-light ratio of the stellar population is influenced by\nmetallicity and SFH, we show that high-mass galaxies have their masses in stars\nand remnants underestimated under the assumption of a constant mass-to-light\nratio. In contrast, low-mass, gas-dominated galaxies are less affected. Our\nresults suggest that the discrepancies between the true and observed BTFR are\nprimarily driven by the evolving nature of the stellar IMF, particularly in\ngalaxies with slowly declining SFHs. The IGIMF theory offers a solution to the\nobserved offsets in the BTFR, especially for high-mass galaxies, where the\nrotational velocities are higher than predicted by MOND. We conclude that\nincorporating the IGIMF provides a more accurate description of galaxy\ndynamics, revealing the importance of stellar population characteristics in\nrefining our understanding of the baryonic mass-velocity relationship.

For the first time, we calculate the\nSommerfeld factor induced by quantum forces for both bosonic and fermionic\nmediators, including the background corrections.

    "abstract": "Magic state distillation enables universal fault-tolerant quantum computation\nby implementing non-Clifford gates via the preparation of high-fidelity magic\nstates. However, it comes at the cost of substantial logical-level overhead in\nboth space and time. In this work, we propose a very low-cost magic state\ndistillation scheme for biased-noise qubits. By leveraging the noise bias, our\nscheme enables the preparation of a magic state with a logical error rate of $3\n\\times 10^{-7}$, using only 53 qubits and 5.5 error correction rounds, under a\nnoise bias of $\\eta \\gtrsim 5 \\times 10^6$ and a phase-flip noise rate of\n$0.1\\%$. This reduces the circuit volume by more than one order of magnitude\nrelative to magic state cultivation for unbiased-noise qubits and by more than\ntwo orders of magnitude relative to standard magic state distillation.\nMoreover, our scheme provides three key advantages over previous proposals for\nbiased-noise qubits. First, it only requires nearest-neighbor two-qubit gates\non a 2D lattice. Second, the logical fidelity remains nearly identical even at\na more modest noise bias of $\\eta \\gtrsim 80$, at the cost of a slightly\nincreased circuit volume. Third, the scheme remains effective even at high\nphysical phase-flip rates, in contrast to previously proposed approaches whose\ncircuit volume grows exponentially with the error rate. Our construction is\nbased on unfolding the $X$ stabilizer group of the Hadamard 3D quantum\nReed-Muller code in 2D, enabling distillation at the physical level rather than\nthe logical level, and is therefore referred to as $\\textit{unfolded}$\ndistillation.",

These strongly tangential field\norientations are specific to CCs. In contrast, across the full cluster\npopulation, magnetic fields show isotropic configurations at all radii and\nredshifts. As individual halos grow, the evolution of their magnetic field\ntopologies is diverse: tangential features can be short-lived, persist over\nlarge cosmological time-scales, or periodically appear, vanish, and reappear\ntowards z=0. We discuss the underlying physics and possible physical scenarios\nto explain the origin of these structures. We argue that both AGN\nfeedback-driven outflows, and merger-driven sloshing motions, cannot explain\nthe population-wide tangential bias in magnetic field orientation.

Such a mass term has an integer coefficient, so it could\nnaturally have been very large during inflation and exactly zero by the time of\nthe QCD phase transition.

The populations that can\nproduce observable TDEs around non-rotating BHs are dominated by subsolar-mass\nstars. 3/4 TDEs requiring larger stellar masses exhibit multi-peaked light\ncurves, possibly implying relation to repeated partial disruptions of high-mass\nstars.

This raises a natural question: what happens when we make\nthis optimization explicit? To explore this, we propose benchmark-targeted\nranking (BETR), a simple method that selects pretraining documents based on\nsimilarity to benchmark training examples. BETR embeds benchmark examples and a\nsample of pretraining documents in a shared space, scores this sample by\nsimilarity to benchmarks, then trains a lightweight classifier to predict these\nscores for the full corpus. We compare data selection methods by training over\n500 models spanning $10^{19}$ to $10^{22}$ FLOPs and fitting scaling laws to\nthem. From this, we find that simply aligning pretraining data to evaluation\nbenchmarks using BETR achieves a 2.1x compute multiplier over DCLM-Baseline\n(4.7x over unfiltered data) and improves performance on 9 out of 10 tasks\nacross all scales. BETR also generalizes well: when targeting a diverse set of\nbenchmarks disjoint from our evaluation suite, it still matches or outperforms\nbaselines. Our scaling analysis further reveals a clear trend: larger models\nrequire less aggressive filtering. Overall, our findings show that directly\nmatching pretraining data to target tasks precisely shapes model capabilities\nand highlight that optimal selection strategies must adapt to model scale.",

As an initial attempt to address this challenge, we\npropose \\textbf{PhysX-3D}, an end-to-end paradigm for physical-grounded 3D\nasset generation. 1) To bridge the critical gap in physics-annotated 3D\ndatasets, we present PhysXNet - the first physics-grounded 3D dataset\nsystematically annotated across five foundational dimensions: absolute scale,\nmaterial, affordance, kinematics, and function description. In particular, we\ndevise a scalable human-in-the-loop annotation pipeline based on\nvision-language models, which enables efficient creation of physics-first\nassets from raw 3D assets.2) Furthermore, we propose \\textbf{PhysXGen}, a\nfeed-forward framework for physics-grounded image-to-3D asset generation,\ninjecting physical knowledge into the pre-trained 3D structural space.\nSpecifically, PhysXGen employs a dual-branch architecture to explicitly model\nthe latent correlations between 3D structures and physical properties, thereby\nproducing 3D assets with plausible physical predictions while preserving the\nnative geometry quality. Extensive experiments validate the superior\nperformance and promising generalization capability of our framework. All the\ncode, data, and models will be released to facilitate future research in\ngenerative physical AI.",

    "abstract": "Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator or Lasso, introduced by\nTibshirani (1996), is one of the widely used regularization methods in\nregression. It is observed that the properties of Lasso vary wildly depending\non the choice of the penalty parameter. The recent results of Lahiri (2021)\nsuggest that, depending on the nature of the penalty parameter, Lasso can\neither be variable selection consistent or be $n^{1/2}-$consistent. However,\npractitioners generally implement Lasso by choosing the penalty parameter in a\ndata-dependent way, the most popular being the $K$-fold cross-validation. In\nthis paper, we explore the variable selection consistency and\n$n^{1/2}-$consistency of Lasso when the penalty is chosen based on $K$-fold\ncross-validation with $K$ being fixed. We consider the fixed-dimensional\nheteroscedastic linear regression model and show that Lasso with $K$-fold\ncross-validation based penalty is $n^{1/2}-$consistent, but not variable\nselection consistent. We also establish the $n^{1/2}-$consistency of the\n$K$-fold cross-validation based penalty as an intermediate result.\nAdditionally, as a consequence of $n^{1/2}-$consistency, we establish the\nvalidity of Bootstrap to approximate the distribution of the Lasso estimator\nbased on $K-$fold cross-validation. We validate the Bootstrap approximation in\nfinite samples based on a moderate simulation study. Thus, our results\nessentially justify the use of $K$-fold cross-validation in practice to draw\ninferences based on $n^{1/2}-$scaled pivotal quantities in Lasso regression.",

OSS are also closely related to separations between\nclassical-binding and collapse-binding for post-quantum hashing and\ncommitments. Unfortunately, the only known OSS construction due to Amos et al.\nwas only justified in a classical oracle model, and moreover their\njustification was ultimately found to contain a fatal bug. Thus, the existence\nof OSS, even in a classical idealized model, has remained open.\n  We give the first standard-model OSS, with provable security assuming\n(sub-exponential) indistinguishability obfuscation (iO) and LWE.

To achieve our standard-model\nconstruction, we develop a notion of permutable pseudorandom permutations\n(permutable PRPs), and show how they are useful for translating oracle proofs\ninvolving random permutations into obfuscation-based proofs.

    "abstract": "Modeling latent representations in a hyperspherical space has proven\neffective for capturing directional similarities in high-dimensional text data,\nbenefiting topic modeling. Variational autoencoder-based neural topic models\n(VAE-NTMs) commonly adopt the von Mises-Fisher prior to encode hyperspherical\nstructure. However, VAE-NTMs often suffer from posterior collapse, where the KL\ndivergence term in the objective function highly diminishes, leading to\nineffective latent representations. To mitigate this issue while modeling\nhyperspherical structure in the latent space, we propose the Spherical Sliced\nWasserstein Autoencoder for Topic Modeling (S2WTM). S2WTM employs a prior\ndistribution supported on the unit hypersphere and leverages the Spherical\nSliced-Wasserstein distance to align the aggregated posterior distribution with\nthe prior.

We focus on the case of minmax\noptimality and define minmax exclusivity classes, demonstrating that the\nclassical family of power-type loss functions $L_p(\\theta,a) = |\\theta - a|^p$\nforms such a class.

While most current research focuses\non the accuracy and theoretical throughput of these models, a systematic\nperformance characterization on practical consumer hardware is critically\nneeded to guide system-level optimization and unlock new applications.\n  To address this gap, we present a comprehensive, comparative benchmarking of\ncarefully selected Transformer, SSM, and hybrid models specifically for\nlong-context inference on consumer and embedded GPUs.

While Transformers may be up to 1.8x faster at short\nsequences, SSMs demonstrate a dramatic performance inversion, becoming up to 4x\nfaster at very long contexts (~57K tokens). Our operator-level analysis reveals\nthat custom, hardware-aware SSM kernels dominate the inference runtime,\naccounting for over 55% of latency on edge platforms, identifying them as a\nprimary target for future hardware acceleration.

    "abstract": "Real robot data collection for imitation learning has led to significant\nadvancements in robotic manipulation. However, the requirement for robot\nhardware in the process fundamentally constrains the scale of the data. In this\npaper, we explore training Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models using egocentric\nhuman videos. The benefit of using human videos is not only for their scale but\nmore importantly for the richness of scenes and tasks. With a VLA trained on\nhuman video that predicts human wrist and hand actions, we can perform Inverse\nKinematics and retargeting to convert the human actions to robot actions. We\nfine-tune the model using a few robot manipulation demonstrations to obtain the\nrobot policy, namely EgoVLA. We propose a simulation benchmark called Ego\nHumanoid Manipulation Benchmark, where we design diverse bimanual manipulation\ntasks with demonstrations. We fine-tune and evaluate EgoVLA with Ego Humanoid\nManipulation Benchmark and show significant improvements over baselines and\nablate the importance of human data.

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across\ndecentralized clients while preserving data privacy. However, its\nopen-participation nature exposes it to data-poisoning attacks, in which\nmalicious actors submit corrupted model updates to degrade the global model.\nExisting defenses are often reactive, relying on statistical aggregation rules\nthat can be computationally expensive and that typically assume an honest\nmajority. This paper introduces a proactive, economic defense: a lightweight\nBayesian incentive mechanism that makes malicious behavior economically\nirrational. Each training round is modeled as a Bayesian game of incomplete\ninformation in which the server, acting as the principal, uses a small, private\nvalidation dataset to verify update quality before issuing payments. The design\nsatisfies Individual Rationality (IR) for benevolent clients, ensuring their\nparticipation is profitable, and Incentive Compatibility (IC), making poisoning\nan economically dominated strategy. Extensive experiments on non-IID partitions\nof MNIST and FashionMNIST demonstrate robustness: with 50% label-flipping\nadversaries on MNIST, the mechanism maintains 96.7% accuracy, only 0.3\npercentage points lower than in a scenario with 30% label-flipping adversaries.\nThis outcome is 51.7 percentage points better than standard FedAvg, which\ncollapses under the same 50% attack.

While frameworks like Double Machine Learning (DML) and\nTargeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE) can debias machine-learning fits,\nexisting neural implementations either rely on \"targeted losses\" that do not\nguarantee solving the efficient influence function equation or computationally\nexpensive post-hoc \"fluctuations\" for multi-parameter settings. We propose\nTargeted Deep Architectures (TDA), a new framework that embeds TMLE directly\ninto the network's parameter space with no restrictions on the backbone\narchitecture. Specifically, TDA partitions model parameters - freezing all but\na small \"targeting\" subset - and iteratively updates them along a targeting\ngradient, derived from projecting the influence functions onto the span of the\ngradients of the loss with respect to weights. This procedure yields plug-in\nestimates that remove first-order bias and produce asymptotically valid\nconfidence intervals. Crucially, TDA easily extends to multi-dimensional causal\nestimands (e.g., entire survival curves) by merging separate targeting\ngradients into a single universal targeting update. Theoretically, TDA inherits\nclassical TMLE properties, including double robustness and semiparametric\nefficiency. Empirically, on the benchmark IHDP dataset (average treatment\neffects) and simulated survival data with informative censoring, TDA reduces\nbias and improves coverage relative to both standard neural-network estimators\nand prior post-hoc approaches. In doing so, TDA establishes a direct, scalable\npathway toward rigorous causal inference within modern deep architectures for\ncomplex multi-parameter targets.",

Quantized indexing\noptimizes retrieval efficiency, while human-in-the-loop feedback and\nconversation memory improve adaptability.\n  Experiments on enterprise datasets show notable improvements: Precision@5\nincreased by 15 percent (90 versus 75), Recall@5 by 13 percent (87 versus 74),\nand Mean Reciprocal Rank by 16 percent (0.85 versus 0.69). Qualitative\nevaluations show higher scores in Faithfulness (4.6 versus 3.0), Completeness\n(4.2 versus 2.5), and Relevance (4.5 versus 3.2) on a 5-point Likert scale.\nThese results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in delivering accurate,\ncomprehensive, and contextually relevant responses for enterprise tasks. Future\nwork includes extending to multimodal data and integrating agent-based\nretrieval. The source code will be released at\nhttps://github.com/CheerlaChandana/Enterprise-Chatbot",

    "abstract": "Aggressive behavior in autistic inpatient youth often arises in temporally\nclustered bursts complicating efforts to distinguish external triggers from\ninternal escalation. The sample population branching factor-the expected number\nof new onsets triggered by a given event-is a key summary of self-excitation in\nbehavior dynamics. Prior pooled models overestimate this quantity by ignoring\npatient-specific variability. We addressed this using a hierarchical Hawkes\nprocess with an exponential kernel and edge-effect correction allowing partial\npooling across patients. This approach reduces bias from high-frequency\nindividuals and stabilizes estimates for those with sparse data. Bayesian\ninference was performed using the No U-Turn Sampler with model evaluation via\nconvergence diagnostics, power-scaling sensitivity analysis, and multiple\nGoodness-of-Fit (GOF) metrics: PSIS-LOO the Lewis test with Durbin's\nmodification and residual analysis based on the Random Time Change Theorem\n(RTCT). The hierarchical model yielded a significantly lower and more precise\nbranching factor estimate mean (0.742 +- 0.026) than the pooled model (0.899 +-\n0.015) and narrower intervals than the unpooled model (0.717 +- 0.139). This\nled to a threefold smaller cascade of events per onset under the hierarchical\nmodel. Sensitivity analyses confirmed robustness to prior and likelihood\nperturbations while the unpooled model showed instability for sparse\nindividuals. GOF measures consistently favored or on par to the hierarchical\nmodel. Hierarchical Hawkes modeling with edge-effect correction provides robust\nestimation of branching dynamics by capturing both within- and between-patient\nvariability. This enables clearer separation of endogenous from exogenous\nevents supports linkage to physiological signals and enhances early warning\nsystems individualized treatment and resource allocation in inpatient care.",

The initial dimensionless\nhorizontal distance between the wall and the bubble centroid was systematically\nvaried, $0.3 \\lesssim L \\lesssim 5$, and the bubble trajectories from two\northogonal vertical planes were captured using high-speed imaging. While the\nbubble rising paths were stable without the wall presence for all the cases,\nthe results reveal that wall proximity significantly affects the rising path,\ndepending on $Bo$ (or $Ga$) and $L$. A map with four distinct interaction\nregimes and their transitions is obtained: (i) Rectilinear Path (RP) at low\n$Bo$ and large $L$, with negligible wall influence; (ii) Migration Away (MA) at\nhigher $Bo$ and moderate-to-large $L$, with lateral deviation from the wall;\n(iii) Collision and Migration Away (C+MA) at high $Bo$ and small $L$, where\nbubbles first collide and then migrate away; and (iv) Periodic Collisions (PC)\nat low $Bo$, where repeated wall impacts occur due to competing forces.

    "abstract": "Bounding box regression (BBR) is fundamental to object detection, where the\nregression loss is crucial for accurate localization. Existing IoU-based losses\noften incorporate handcrafted geometric penalties to address IoU's\nnon-differentiability in non-overlapping cases and enhance BBR performance.\nHowever, these penalties are sensitive to box shape, size, and distribution,\noften leading to suboptimal optimization for small objects and undesired\nbehaviors such as bounding box enlargement due to misalignment with the IoU\nobjective. To address these limitations, we propose InterpIoU, a novel loss\nfunction that replaces handcrafted geometric penalties with a term based on the\nIoU between interpolated boxes and the target. By using interpolated boxes to\nbridge the gap between predictions and ground truth, InterpIoU provides\nmeaningful gradients in non-overlapping cases and inherently avoids the box\nenlargement issue caused by misaligned penalties. Simulation results further\nshow that IoU itself serves as an ideal regression target, while existing\ngeometric penalties are both unnecessary and suboptimal. Building on InterpIoU,\nwe introduce Dynamic InterpIoU, which dynamically adjusts interpolation\ncoefficients based on IoU values, enhancing adaptability to scenarios with\ndiverse object distributions. Experiments on COCO, VisDrone, and PASCAL VOC\nshow that our methods consistently outperform state-of-the-art IoU-based losses\nacross various detection frameworks, with particularly notable improvements in\nsmall object detection, confirming their effectiveness.",

While hippocampal\nneurons encoding position and orientation are well documented, the large-scale\nneural dynamics supporting spatial representation, particularly during\nnaturalistic, passive experience, remain poorly understood. Here, we\ndemonstrate for the first time that non-invasive brain-computer interfaces\n(BCIs) based on electroencephalography (EEG) can decode spontaneous,\nfine-grained egocentric 6D pose, comprising three-dimensional position and\norientation, during passive viewing of egocentric video. Despite EEG's limited\nspatial resolution and high signal noise, we find that spatially coherent\nvisual input (i.e., continuous and structured motion) reliably evokes decodable\nspatial representations, aligning with participants' subjective sense of\nspatial engagement. Decoding performance further improves when visual input is\npresented at a frame rate of 100 ms per image, suggesting alignment with\nintrinsic neural temporal dynamics. Using gradient-based backpropagation\nthrough a neural decoding model, we identify distinct EEG channels contributing\nto position -- and orientation specific -- components, revealing a distributed\nyet complementary neural encoding scheme.

This\nregrettable omission is in spite of the fact that many functions in modern day\napplications of optimization can be shown to be quasi-differentiable. In\nessence, a quasi-differentiable function is one whose directional derivative at\nan arbitrary reference vector, as a function of the direction, is the\ndifference of two positively homogenous, convex functions. Thus, to bring\nquasi-differentiable functions closer to the class of difference-of-convex\nfunctions that has received fast growing attention in recent years in\nconnection with many applied subjects, we propose to rename\nquasi-differentiable functions as quasi-difference-convex (quasi-dc) functions.\nBesides modernizing and advancing this class of nonconvex and nondifferentiable\nfunctions, our research aims to put together a unified treatment of iterative\nconvex-programming based descent algorithms for solving a broad class of\ncomposite quasi-dc programs and to establish their subsequential convergence,\nsequential convergence, and rates of convergence; the latter two topics are in\nline with the modern focus of such analysis for convex programs and some\nextensions and are departures from the sole emphasis of subsequential\nconvergence in the traditional studies of quasi-differentiable optimization.\nThrough this research, we have gained significant new insights and\nunderstanding, advanced the fundamentals, and broadened the applications of\nthis neglected yet pervasive class of nonconvex and nondifferentiable functions\nand their optimization.",

    "abstract": "Topological quantum materials have emerged as a frontier in condensed matter\nphysics as well as in materials science, with intriguing electronic states that\nare robust to perturbations. Among the diverse structural motifs, kagome,\nchiral, and square-net structures offer a wide range of topological phases and\nphysical phenomena. These include Dirac and Weyl fermions, nodal-line\nsemimetals, flat bands, van Hove singularities, charge density waves,\nsuperconductivity, nontrivial Berry phase, nonlinear electrical and thermal\ntransports. This review explores the distinct roles of geometry, symmetry,\nspin-orbit coupling, and electron correlations in these three classes of\nmaterials. It also highlights how their crystallographic features give rise to\nunique electronic band structures, topologically protected states and different\nphysical properties, which require high-quality-single crystals. The present\ndiscussion comprises recent experimental discoveries and identification of the\nsynthesis routes of key materials within each framework. Finally, the review\noutlines the current challenges and future directions in the design and\nexploration of topological quantum materials.",

We\nperform state-of-the-art density functional theory (DFT) calculations to\ncompute the electronic structure and phonon dynamics in the low-temperature\ndimerized phase. We also perform high-resolution neutron spectroscopy to\nmeasure the full phonon spectrum over multiple Brillouin zones. We find\nexcellent agreement between our numerical and experimental results that extend\nto all measurement temperatures. Notable features of our phonon spectra include\na number of steeply dispersive modes, nonmonotonic dispersion features, and\nspecific phonon anticrossings, which we relate to the mode eigenvectors. By\ncalculating the magnetic interactions within DFT and studying the effects of\ndifferent phonon modes on the superexchange paths, we discuss the possibility\nof observing spin-phonon hybridization effects in experiments performed both in\nand out of equilibrium.",

While quantum completeness and classical\nsoundness of the construction have been established for all multipartite games,\nquantum soundness is known only in the special case of bipartite games.\n  In this paper, we prove that the Kalai et al.'s compiler indeed achieves\nquantum soundness for all multipartite compiled non-local games, by showing\nthat any correlations that can be generated in the asymptotic case correspond\nto quantum commuting strategies.\n  Our proof uses techniques from the theory of operator algebras, and relies on\na characterisation of sequential operationally no-signalling strategies as\nquantum commuting operator strategies in the multipartite case, thereby\ngeneralising several previous results. On the way, we construct universal\nC*-algebras of sequential PVMs and prove a new chain rule for Radon-Nikodym\nderivatives of completely positive maps on C*-algebras which may be of\nindependent interest.",

    "abstract": "The Galactic fast radio burst (FRB) FRB 200428 was associated with a short\nX-ray burst (XRB) from the magnetar SGR J1935+2154 during one of its active\nphases. This FRB-associated XRB exhibits distinct properties compared to other\ntypical XRBs, including a significantly higher cutoff energy and a steeper\npower-law index. Its recovered X-ray light curve shows a multiple-peak\nstructure, with the time of arrival offset from that of the FRB. These unique\nfeatures imply a special physical link between the FRB and X-ray emissions. In\n2022 October, a similar FRB-XRB association was detected from the same source.\nIn this paper, we propose a model in which the observed spectral and temporal\nfeatures of the associated XRBs can be attributed to the inverse Compton\nscattering (ICS) of FRB photons by an extreme pair flow around the light\ncylinder, with a bulk Lorentz factor of $\\Gamma\\sim10$ and a power-law\ndistribution in the comoving frame, characterized by a typical Lorentz factor\n$\\gamma^\\prime_\\mathrm{m}\\sim5\\times 10^4$. This extreme pair flow could\noriginate from the compression of a transient pulse of\n$\\sim10^{40}-10^{41}\\mathrm{erg\\,s^{-1}}$ and the acceleration through magnetic\nreconnection in the current sheet during magnetar activity. The Doppler-boosted\nICS spectra and the arrival time shifts in such a scenario can well explain the\nobserved features of the FRB 200428-associated XRB and can also account for\nanother associated event in 2022.",

While symbolic regression (SR) offers a path to\ndiscover such formulas, its performance degrades with high-dimensional inputs\nand small datasets. We present a two-phase framework that combines neural\nnetworks (NN), feature importance analysis, and symbolic regression (SR) to\ndiscover interpretable descriptors for OER activity in oxide perovskites. In\nPhase I, using a small dataset and seven structural features, we reproduce and\nimprove the known {\\mu}/t descriptor by engineering composite features and\napplying symbolic regression, achieving training and validation MAEs of 22.8\nand 20.8 meV, respectively. In Phase II, we expand to 164 features, reduce\ndimensionality, and identify LUMO energy as a key electronic descriptor. A\nfinal formula using {\\mu}/t, {\\mu}/RA, and LUMO energy achieves improved\naccuracy (training and validation MAEs of 22.1 and 20.6 meV) with strong\nphysical interpretability. Our results demonstrate that NN-guided symbolic\nregression enables accurate, interpretable, and physically meaningful\ndescriptor discovery in data-scarce regimes, indicating interpretability need\nnot sacrifice accuracy for materials informatics.",

    "abstract": "We derive constraints on the neutrino mass using a variety of recent\ncosmological datasets, including DESI BAO, the full-shape analysis of the DESI\nmatter power spectrum and the one-dimensional power spectrum of the\nLyman-$\\alpha$ forest (P1D) from eBOSS quasars as well as the cosmic microwave\nbackground (CMB). The constraints are obtained in the frequentist formalism by\nconstructing profile likelihoods and applying the Feldman-Cousins prescription\nto compute confidence intervals. This method avoids potential prior and volume\neffects that may arise in a comparable Bayesian analysis. Parabolic fits to the\nprofiles allow one to distinguish changes in the upper limits from variations\nin the constraining power $\\sigma$ of the different data combinations. We find\nthat all profiles in the $\\Lambda$CDM model are cut off by the $\\sum m_\\nu \\geq\n0$ bound, meaning that the corresponding parabolas reach their minimum in the\nunphysical sector. The most stringent 95% C.L. upper limit is obtained by the\ncombination of DESI DR2 BAO, Planck PR4 and CMB lensing at 53 meV, below the\nminimum of 59 meV set by the normal ordering. Extending $\\Lambda$CDM to\nnon-zero curvature and $w_0w_\\mathrm{a}$CDM relaxes the constraints past 59 meV\nagain, but only $w_0w_\\mathrm{a}$CDM exhibits profiles with a minimum at a\npositive value. Using a combination of DESI DR1 full-shape, BBN and eBOSS\nLyman-$\\alpha$ P1D, we successfully constrain the neutrino mass independently\nof the CMB. This combination yields $\\sum m_\\nu \\leq 285$ meV (95% C.L.). The\naddition of DESI full-shape or Lyman-$\\alpha$ P1D to CMB and DESI BAO results\nin small but noticeable improvement of the constraining power of the data.\nLyman-$\\alpha$ free-streaming measurements especially improve the constraint.\nSince they are based on eBOSS data, this sets a promising precedent for\nupcoming DESI data.",

We consider a swarm of nanobots locating a single cancerous region and\ntreating it by releasing an onboard payload of drugs at the site. At nanoscale,\nthe computation, communication, sensing, and locomotion capabilities of\nindividual agents are extremely limited, noisy, and/or nonexistent.\n  We present a general model to formally describe the individual and collective\nbehavior of agents in a colloidal environment, such as the bloodstream, for\ncancer detection and treatment by nanobots. This includes a feasible and\nprecise model of agent locomotion, inspired by actual nanoparticles that, in\nthe presence of an external chemical gradient, move towards areas of higher\nconcentration by means of self-propulsion. We present two variants of our\ngeneral model: The first assumes an endogenous chemical gradient that is fixed\nover time and centered at the targeted cancer site; the second is a more\nspeculative and dynamic variant in which agents themselves create and amplify a\nchemical gradient centered at the cancer site. In both settings, agents can\nsense the gradient and ascend it noisily, locating the cancer site more quickly\nthan via simple Brownian motion.\n  For the first variant of the model, we present simulation results to show the\nbehavior of agents under our locomotion model, as well as {analytical results}\nto bound the time it takes for the agents to reach the cancer site. For the\nsecond variant, simulation results highlight the collective benefit in having\nagents issue their own chemical signal. While arguably more speculative in its\nagent capability assumptions, this variant shows a significant improvement in\nruntime performance over the first variant, resulting from its chemical signal\namplification mechanism.",

While many works have empirically studied\ntechniques like Best-of-N (BoN) and rejection sampling that make use of a\nverifier to enable test-time scaling, there is little theoretical understanding\nof how verifier imperfection affects performance. In this work, we address this\ngap. Specifically, we prove how instance-level accuracy of these methods is\nprecisely characterized by the geometry of the verifier's ROC curve.\nInterestingly, while scaling is determined by the local geometry of the ROC\ncurve for rejection sampling, it depends on global properties of the ROC curve\nfor BoN. As a consequence when the ROC curve is unknown, it is impossible to\nextrapolate the performance of rejection sampling based on the low-compute\nregime. Furthermore, while rejection sampling outperforms BoN for fixed\ncompute, in the infinite-compute limit both methods converge to the same level\nof accuracy, determined by the slope of the ROC curve near the origin. Our\ntheoretical results are confirmed by experiments on GSM8K using different\nversions of Llama and Qwen to generate and verify solutions.",

A\nlongstanding folklore conjecture asserts that the only solutions are the\n``trivial'' ones with $y=-1$. We confirm the conjecture unconditionally for\n$p\\leq 13$, and prove the conjecture holds for $p>911$ through a careful\napplication of lower bounds for linear forms in two logarithms.

    "abstract": "Realistic human surveillance datasets are crucial for training and evaluating\ncomputer vision models under real-world conditions, facilitating the\ndevelopment of robust algorithms for human and human-interacting object\ndetection in complex environments. These datasets need to offer diverse and\nchallenging data to enable a comprehensive assessment of model performance and\nthe creation of more reliable surveillance systems for public safety. To this\nend, we present two visual object detection benchmarks named OD-VIRAT Large and\nOD-VIRAT Tiny, aiming at advancing visual understanding tasks in surveillance\nimagery. The video sequences in both benchmarks cover 10 different scenes of\nhuman surveillance recorded from significant height and distance. The proposed\nbenchmarks offer rich annotations of bounding boxes and categories, where\nOD-VIRAT Large has 8.7 million annotated instances in 599,996 images and\nOD-VIRAT Tiny has 288,901 annotated instances in 19,860 images. This work also\nfocuses on benchmarking state-of-the-art object detection architectures,\nincluding RETMDET, YOLOX, RetinaNet, DETR, and Deformable-DETR on this object\ndetection-specific variant of VIRAT dataset. To the best of our knowledge, it\nis the first work to examine the performance of these recently published\nstate-of-the-art object detection architectures on realistic surveillance\nimagery under challenging conditions such as complex backgrounds, occluded\nobjects, and small-scale objects. The proposed benchmarking and experimental\nsettings will help in providing insights concerning the performance of selected\nobject detection models and set the base for developing more efficient and\nrobust object detection architectures.",

    "abstract": "Eukaryotic gene regulation is based on stochastic yet controlled promoter\nswitching, during which genes transition between transcriptionally active and\ninactive states. Despite the molecular complexity of this process, recent\nstudies reveal a surprising invariance of the \"switching correlation time\"\n($T_C$), which characterizes promoter activity fluctuations, across gene\nexpression levels in diverse genes and organisms. A biophysically plausible\nexplanation for this invariance remains missing. Here, we show that this\ninvariance imposes stringent constraints on minimal yet plausible models of\ntranscriptional regulation, requiring at least four system states and\nnon-equilibrium dynamics that break detailed balance. Using Bayesian inference\non Drosophila gap gene expression data, we demonstrate that such models (i)\naccurately reproduce the observed $T_C$-invariance; (ii) remain robust to\nparameter perturbations; and (iii) maximize information transmission from\ntranscription factor concentration to gene expression. These findings suggest\nthat eukaryotic gene regulation has evolved to balance precision with reaction\nrate and energy dissipation constraints, favoring non-equilibrium architectures\nfor optimal information transmission.",

LQA simulates quantum\nannealing while constraining the quantum state to remain in a product state and\nuses a gradient-based approach to find approximate solutions to large-scale\nquadratic unconstrained binary optimization problems. ExcLQA extends this\nframework by adding a penalty term in the cost function to target excited\nstates, with a single hyperparameter that can be tuned via binary search to set\nthe desired penalization level. We benchmark ExcLQA on the shortest vector\nproblem (SVP), a fundamental lattice problem underlying the security of many\npostquantum cryptographic schemes. Solving an SVP instance can be mapped to\nidentifying the first excited state of a Hamiltonian, with approximate\nsolutions located among nearby excited states. Our results show that ExcLQA\nmanages to solve SVP instances up to rank 46, and outperforms the\nMetropolis-Hastings algorithm in solved ratio, number of shots, and\napproximation factor in the tested instances.",

The\npremise of our study is twofold: firstly, the further two states are from each\nother, transition-wise, the less relevant the value of the first state is when\nlearning the $\\epsilon$-optimal value of the second; secondly, the amount of\n'effort', sample-complexity-wise, expended in learning the $\\epsilon$-optimal\nvalue of a state is independent of the number of samples required to learn the\n$\\epsilon$-optimal value of a second state that is a sufficient number of\ntransitions away from the first.

In\nparticular, detecting multiple QNMs enables consistency checks of their\nfrequencies and damping times, serving as a test of General Relativity -- a\ntechnique known as black hole spectroscopy. However, incorporating additional\nQNMs introduces challenges such as increased parameter correlations and higher\ncomputational costs in data analysis. To address this, we propose an efficient\nBayesian analysis method that applies the Gram-Schmidt algorithm to the QNMs.\nThis reduces the correlation between the modes and enables analytic\nmarginalization over the mode amplitudes.

We provide an SDK to\nrun and compose unmodified workloads as sandboxes, enclaves, and CVMs with\nminimal overhead compared to native Linux execution. Tyche supports complex\ncloud scenarios, such as confidential inference with mutually distrustful\nusers, model owners, and CSPs. An additional RISC-V prototype demonstrates\nTyche's portability across platforms.",

This poses an especially significant\nchallenge for large surveys such as Gaia or LAMOST, where the number of\navailable spectra per target is often not enough for a proper spectral\ndisentangling. We present a new approach for characterizing SB2 components from\nsingle-exposure spectroscopic observations. The proposed tool uses deep neural\nnetworks to extract the stellar parameters of the individual component spectra\nthat comprise the single exposure, without explicitly disentangling them or\nextracting their radial velocities. The neural networks were trained, tested,\nand validated using simulated data resembling Gaia RVS spectra, which will be\nmade available to the community in the coming Gaia data releases. We expect our\ntool to be useful in their analysis.",

Assuming $N$ is a\nhypersurface, it develops the notion of generalised exterior curvature,\nintroducing the generalised second fundamental form and the generalised mean\ncurvature. Generalised versions of the Gau{\\ss}-Codazzi equations are obtained.\nAs an application, the constraint equations for the initial value formulation\nof the generalised Einstein equations are established in the formalism of\ngeneralised geometry. Further applications include a generalised geometry\nversion of the fundamental theorem for hypersurfaces and the result that\ngeneralised K\\\"ahler and hyper-K\\\"ahler structures restrict to submanifolds\ncompatible with the generalised almost complex structure.

As a result, uncertainty\nquantification (UQ) has become a critical tool in modeling-based engineering,\nproviding methods to identify, characterize, and propagate uncertainty through\ncomputational models. However, the stochastic nature of UQ typically requires\nnumerous evaluations of these models, which can be computationally expensive\nand limit the scope of feasible analyses. To address this, surrogate models,\ni.e., efficient functional approximations trained on a limited set of\nsimulations, have become central in modern UQ practice. This book chapter\npresents a concise review of surrogate modeling techniques for UQ, with a focus\non the particularly challenging task of capturing the full time-dependent\nresponse of dynamical systems. It introduces a classification of time-dependent\nproblems based on the complexity of input excitation and discusses\ncorresponding surrogate approaches, including combinations of principal\ncomponent analysis with polynomial chaos expansions, time warping techniques,\nand nonlinear autoregressive models with exogenous inputs (NARX models).

However,\nsince brain development takes root at the fetal stage, a critical window of\nthis process remains largely unknown. The only technique capable of recording\nneural activity in the intrauterine environment is fetal magnetoencephalography\n(fMEG), but this approach presents challenges in terms of data quality and\nscarcity. Using artificial intelligence, the present research aims to transfer\nthe well-established knowledge from EEG studies to fMEG to improve\nunderstanding of prenatal brain development, laying the foundations for better\ndetection and treatment of potential pathologies. Methods: We developed an\nunpaired diffusion translation method based on dual diffusion bridges, which\nnotably includes numerical integration improvements to obtain more qualitative\nresults at a lower computational cost. Models were trained on our unpaired\ndataset of bursts of spontaneous activity from 30 high-resolution premature\nnewborns EEG recordings and 44 fMEG recordings. Results: We demonstrate that\nour method achieves significant improvement upon previous results obtained with\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (GANs), by almost 5% on the mean squared error\nin the time domain, and completely eliminating the mode collapse problem in the\nfrequency domain, thus achieving near-perfect signal fidelity.

    "abstract": "Deep learning has revolutionized many industries by enabling models to\nautomatically learn complex patterns from raw data, reducing dependence on\nmanual feature engineering. However, deep learning algorithms are sensitive to\ninput data, and performance often deteriorates under nonstationary conditions\nand across dissimilar domains, especially when using time-domain data.\nConventional single-channel or parallel multi-source data loading strategies\neither limit generalization or increase computational costs. This study\nintroduces selective embedding, a novel data loading strategy, which alternates\nshort segments of data from multiple sources within a single input channel.\nDrawing inspiration from cognitive psychology, selective embedding mimics\nhuman-like information processing to reduce model overfitting, enhance\ngeneralization, and improve computational efficiency. Validation is conducted\nusing six time-domain datasets, demonstrating that the proposed method\nconsistently achieves high classification accuracy across various deep learning\narchitectures while significantly reducing training times. The approach proves\nparticularly effective for complex systems with multiple data sources, offering\na scalable and resource-efficient solution for real-world applications in\nhealthcare, heavy machinery, marine, railway, and agriculture, where robustness\nand adaptability are critical.",

Understanding these relationships is vital for policymakers and\nother stakeholders as the world faces challenges such as satisfying humanity's\nincreasing need for energy and the effects of climate change. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the causal effect of electricity market liberalization on the\nelectricity price in the US. By performing this analysis, we aim to provide new\ninsights into the ongoing debate about the benefits of electricity market\nliberalization. We introduce Causal Machine Learning as a new approach for\ninterventions in the energy-finance field. The development of machine learning\nin recent years opened the door for a new branch of machine learning models for\ncausality impact, with the ability to extract complex patterns and\nrelationships from the data. We discuss the advantages of causal ML methods and\ncompare the performance of ML-based models to shed light on the applicability\nof causal ML frameworks to energy policy intervention cases. We find that the\nDeepProbCP framework outperforms the other frameworks examined. In addition, we\nfind that liberalization of, and individual players' entry to, the electricity\nmarket resulted in a 7% decrease in price in the short term.",

    "abstract": "The focus of the present paper is to forecast mortality rates for small\nsub-populations that are parts of a larger super-population. In this setting\nthe assumption is that it is possible to produce reliable forecasts for the\nsuper-population, but the sub-populations may be too small or lack sufficient\nhistory to produce reliable forecasts if modelled separately. This setup is\naligned with the ideas that underpin credibility theory, and in the present\npaper the classical credibility theory approach is extended to be able to\nhandle the situation where future mortality rates are driven by a latent\nstochastic process, as is the case for, e.g., Lee-Carter type models.\n  This results in sub-population credibility predictors that are weighted\naverages of expected future super-population mortality rates and expected\nfuture sub-population specific mortality rates. Due to the predictor's simple\nstructure it is possible to derive an explicit expression for the mean squared\nerror of prediction. Moreover, the proposed credibility modelling approach does\nnot depend on the specific form of the super-population model, making it\nbroadly applicable regardless of the chosen forecasting model for the\nsuper-population.\n  The performance of the suggested sub-population credibility predictor is\nillustrated on simulated population data. These illustrations highlight how the\ncredibility predictor serves as a compromise between only using a\nsuper-population model, and only using a potentially unreliable sub-population\nspecific model.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a neural polar decoder (NPD) for deletion channels with\na constant deletion rate. Existing polar decoders for deletion channels exhibit\nhigh computational complexity of $O(N^4)$, where $N$ is the block length. This\nlimits the application of polar codes for deletion channels to\nshort-to-moderate block lengths. In this work, we demonstrate that employing\nNPDs for deletion channels can reduce the computational complexity. First, we\nextend the architecture of the NPD to support deletion channels. Specifically,\nthe NPD architecture consists of four neural networks (NNs), each replicating\nfundamental successive cancellation (SC) decoder operations. To support\ndeletion channels, we change the architecture of only one. The computational\ncomplexity of the NPD is $O(AN\\log N)$, where the parameter $A$ represents a\ncomputational budget determined by the user and is independent of the channel.\nWe evaluate the new extended NPD for deletion channels with deletion rates\n$\\delta\\in\\{0.01, 0.1\\}$ and we verify the NPD with the ground truth given by\nthe trellis decoder by Tal et al. We further show that due to the reduced\ncomplexity of the NPD, we are able to incorporate list decoding and further\nimprove performance.

    "abstract": "With the increasing energy demand and the growing integration of renewable\nsources of energy, power systems face operational challenges such as overloads,\nlosses, and stability concerns, particularly as networks operate near their\ncapacity limits. Flexible alternating current transmission system (FACTS)\ndevices are essential to ensure reliable grid operations and enable the\nefficient integration of renewable energy. This work introduces a mixed-integer\nsecond-order cone programming (MISOCP) model for the multi-period scheduling of\nkey FACTS devices in electric transmission systems. The proposed model\nintegrates four key control mechanisms: (i) on-load tap changers (OLTCs) for\nvoltage regulation via discrete taps; (ii) static synchronous compensators\n(STATCOMs) and (iii) shunt reactors for reactive power compensation; and (iv)\nthyristor-controlled series capacitors (TCSCs) for adjustable impedance and\nflow control. The objective is to minimize active power losses using a limited\nnumber of control actions while meeting physical and operational constraints at\nall times throughout the defined time horizon. To ensure tractability, the\nmodel employs a second-order cone relaxation of the power flow. Device-specific\nconstraints are handled via binary expansion and linearization: OLTCs and shunt\nreactors are modelled with discrete variables, STATCOMs through reactive power\nbounds, and TCSCs using a reformulation-linearization technique (RLT). A\nmulti-period formulation captures the sequential nature of decision making,\nensuring consistency across time steps. The model is evaluated on the IEEE\n9-bus, 30-bus, and RTS96 test systems, demonstrating its ability to reduce\nlosses, with potential applicability to larger-scale grids.",

    "abstract": "Road roughness significantly affects vehicle vibrations and ride quality. We\nintroduce a Kalman filter (KF)-based method for estimating road roughness in\nterms of the international roughness index (IRI) by fusing inertial and speed\nmeasurements, offering a cost-effective solution for pavement monitoring. The\nmethod involves system identification on a physical vehicle to estimate\nrealistic model parameters, followed by KF-based reconstruction of the\nlongitudinal road profile to compute IRI values. It explores IRI estimation\nusing vertical and lateral vibrations, the latter more common in modern\nvehicles. Validation on 230 km of real-world data shows promising results, with\nIRI estimation errors ranging from 1% to 10% of the reference values. However,\naccuracy deteriorates significantly when using only lateral vibrations,\nhighlighting their limitations. These findings demonstrate the potential of\nKF-based estimation for efficient road roughness monitoring.",

This paper\npresents a structured approach to integrate geospatial foundation models into\noperational mapping systems. Our protocol has three key steps: defining\napplication requirements, adapting the model to domain-specific data and\nconducting rigorous empirical testing. Using the Presto model in a case study\nfor crop mapping, we demonstrate that fine-tuning a pre-trained model\nsignificantly improves performance over conventional supervised methods. Our\nresults highlight the model's strong spatial and temporal generalization\ncapabilities. Our protocol provides a replicable blueprint for practitioners\nand lays the groundwork for future research to operationalize foundation models\nin diverse remote sensing applications.

However,\ndespite the proliferation of LLMs for general code-related tasks, there's a\ndearth of research focused on evaluating and refining these models for hardware\ndescription languages (HDLs), notably VHDL. In this study, we evaluate the\nperformance of existing code LLMs for VHDL code generation and summarization\nusing various metrics and two datasets -- VHDL-Eval and VHDL-Xform. The latter,\nan in-house dataset, aims to gauge LLMs' understanding of functionally\nequivalent code. Our findings reveal consistent underperformance of these\nmodels across different metrics, underscoring a significant gap in their\nsuitability for this domain. To address this challenge, we propose\nChain-of-Descriptions (CoDes), a novel approach to enhance the performance of\nLLMs for VHDL code generation and summarization tasks. CoDes involves\ngenerating a series of intermediate descriptive steps based on: (i) the problem\nstatement for code generation, and (ii) the VHDL code for summarization. These\nsteps are then integrated with the original input prompt (problem statement or\ncode) and provided as input to the LLMs to generate the final output. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that the CoDes approach significantly surpasses the\nstandard prompting strategy across various metrics on both datasets.

The present work applies GSA to\nsimulations of the SPARC Primary Reference Discharge and demonstrates its\nseparation capability on all phases of the shot, including the ramp-up during\nwhich significant currents on the passive structures often complicate the\nreconstruction of plasma equilibria. Such early results suggest a promising new\nway to study ramp-ups, disruptions, and vertical displacement events without\nany specific modeling assumption. Envisaged applications include reading\nmagnetic data from experimental diagnostics and producing a new set of signals\nwithout external contributions to be used by downstream equilibrium codes for\nimproved accuracy or speed.",

    "abstract": "SHACL and OWL are two prominent W3C standards for managing RDF data. These\nlanguages share many features, but they have one fundamental difference: OWL,\ndesigned for inferring facts from incomplete data, makes the open-world\nassumption, whereas SHACL is a constraint language that treats the data as\ncomplete and must be validated under the closed-world assumption. The\ncombination of both formalisms is very appealing and has been called for, but\ntheir semantic gap is a major challenge, semantically and computationally. In\nthis paper, we advocate a semantics for SHACL validation in the presence of\nontologies based on core universal models. We provide a technique for\nconstructing these models for ontologies in the rich data-tractable description\nlogic Horn-ALCHIQ. Furthermore, we use a finite representation of this model to\ndevelop a rewriting technique that reduces SHACL validation in the presence of\nontologies to standard validation. Finally, we study the complexity of SHACL\nvalidation in the presence of ontologies, and show that even very simple\nontologies make the problem EXPTIME-complete, and PTIME-complete in data\ncomplexity.",

    "abstract": "This paper establishes the global existence of solutions for a class of\nwave-Klein-Gordon coupled systems with specific nonlinearities in\n3+1-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. The study demonstrates that imposing\ncertain constraints on the coefficients of these specific nonlinear terms\ninduces a damping effect within the system, which is crucial for proving the\nglobal existence of solutions. The proof is conducted within the framework of a\nbootstrap argument, primarily employing the hyperboloidal foliation method and\nthe vector field method.",

    "abstract": "Advancements in LLMs have enhanced task automation in software engineering;\nhowever, current evaluations primarily focus on natural language tasks,\noverlooking code quality. Most benchmarks prioritize high-level reasoning over\nexecutable code and real-world performance, leaving gaps in understanding true\ncapabilities and risks associated with these models in production. To address\nthis issue, we propose MERA Code, a new addition to the MERA benchmark family,\nspecifically focused on evaluating code for the latest code generation LLMs in\nRussian. This benchmark includes 11 evaluation tasks that span 8 programming\nlanguages. Our proposed evaluation methodology features a taxonomy that\noutlines the practical coding skills necessary for models to complete these\ntasks. The benchmark comprises an open-source codebase for users to conduct\nMERA assessments, a scoring system compatible with various programming\nenvironments, and a platform featuring a leaderboard and submission system. We\nevaluate open LLMs and frontier API models, analyzing their limitations in\nterms of practical coding tasks in non-English languages. We are publicly\nreleasing MERA to guide future research, anticipate groundbreaking features in\nmodel development, and standardize evaluation procedures.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable image generation capabilities,\nbut also pose risks in privacy and fairness by memorizing sensitive concepts or\nperpetuating biases. We propose a novel \\textbf{concept erasure} method for\ntext-to-image diffusion models, designed to remove specified concepts (e.g., a\nprivate individual or a harmful stereotype) from the model's generative\nrepertoire. Our method, termed \\textbf{FADE} (Fair Adversarial Diffusion\nErasure), combines a trajectory-aware fine-tuning strategy with an adversarial\nobjective to ensure the concept is reliably removed while preserving overall\nmodel fidelity. Theoretically, we prove a formal guarantee that our approach\nminimizes the mutual information between the erased concept and the model's\noutputs, ensuring privacy and fairness. Empirically, we evaluate FADE on Stable\nDiffusion and FLUX, using benchmarks from prior work (e.g., object, celebrity,\nexplicit content, and style erasure tasks from MACE). FADE achieves\nstate-of-the-art concept removal performance, surpassing recent baselines like\nESD, UCE, MACE, and ANT in terms of removal efficacy and image quality.\nNotably, FADE improves the harmonic mean of concept removal and fidelity by\n5--10\\% over the best prior method. We also conduct an ablation study to\nvalidate each component of FADE, confirming that our adversarial and\ntrajectory-preserving objectives each contribute to its superior performance.\nOur work sets a new standard for safe and fair generative modeling by\nunlearning specified concepts without retraining from scratch.",

The GW\nsignals targeted by this search are the so-called \"long-duration\" (> 1 s)\ntransients expected from a variety of astrophysical processes, including\nnon-axisymmetric deformations in magnetars or eccentric binary coalescences. We\nmake minimal assumptions on the emitted GW waveforms in terms of morphologies\nand durations. Overall, our search targets signals with durations ~1-1000 s and\nfrequency content in the range 16-2048 Hz. In the absence of significant\ndetections, we report the sensitivity limits of our search in terms of\nroot-sum-square signal amplitude (hrss) of reference waveforms. These limits\nimprove upon the results from the third LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing run (O3) by\nabout 30% on average. Moreover, this analysis demonstrates substantial progress\nin our ability to search for long-duration GW signals owing to enhancements in\npipeline detection efficiencies. As detector sensitivities continue to advance\nand observational runs grow longer, unmodeled long-duration searches will\nincreasingly be able to explore a range of compelling astrophysical scenarios\ninvolving neutron stars and black holes.",

These planar\nmetallic constrictions, which naturally exhibit Josephsonlike behavior, offer a\nfundamental platform for investigating nonreciprocal transport phenomena in a\nregime where the bridge width aligns with the superconducting coherence length.\nThe foundational concept is inspired by the Tesla valve, a classical fluidic\ndevice that achieves flow rectification through interference and turbulence\nbetween fluid streams enabled by geometric asymmetry. Analogously, we\ndemonstrate that spatial asymmetry within superconducting structures can result\nin rectification due to the polarity-dependent interaction between transport\nand screening currents. By implementing controlled geometric defects at the\njunction between the constriction and superconducting leads, we induce current\ncrowding and disrupt spatial inversion symmetry, thus facilitating directional\nswitching behavior. Experimental results indicate a linear-in-field\nrectification regime at low magnetic fields, driven by the interaction between\ntransport and screening currents, which is succeeded by complex vortex dynamics\nwithin the superconducting banks at elevated fields. Time-dependent\nGinzburg-Landau simulations replicate significant features of the experimental\nobservations and substantiate the influence of both screening currents and\nrearrangements of Abrikosov vortices. A comparative study across various\ngeometries highlights the crucial role of defect shape and spatial confinement\nin determining the rectification efficiency, revealing a minimum threshold in\nbridge width below which crowding-induced SDE is significantly reduced. Our\nfindings advocate for mesoscopic Dayem bridges as a flexible platform for\ndesigning and controlling superconducting diode functionalities.",

We find that searches for such blazar-boosted DM\nleave room for a variety of DM models to explain observations of high-energy\nneutrinos.

High levels of CPU\ncan slow down investments in green technologies, make regulatory planning more\ndifficult, and increase public resistance to climate reforms, especially during\ntimes of economic stress. This study addresses the challenge of forecasting the\nUS CPU index by building the Bayesian Structural Time Series (BSTS) model with\na large set of covariates, including economic indicators, financial cycle data,\nand public sentiments captured through Google Trends. The key strength of the\nBSTS model lies in its ability to efficiently manage a large number of\ncovariates through its dynamic feature selection mechanism based on the\nspike-and-slab prior. To validate the effectiveness of the selected features of\nthe BSTS model, an impulse response analysis is performed. The results show\nthat macro-financial shocks impact CPU in different ways over time. Numerical\nexperiments are performed to evaluate the performance of the BSTS model with\nexogenous variables on the US CPU dataset over different forecasting horizons.\nThe empirical results confirm that BSTS consistently outperforms classical and\ndeep learning frameworks, particularly for semi-long-term and long-term\nforecasts.",

Dust grains influence the ISM by\ncooling the gas, altering its chemistry, and absorbing stellar radiation,\nre-emitting it at longer wavelengths in the far-infrared (FIR) and\nsub-millimeter regimes. The cold dust component, which dominates the dust mass,\nis primarily heated by stellar radiation, including both young, massive stars\nand the diffuse emission from older stars. Understanding dust heating is\nessential to trace the connection between stellar populations and their\nenvironments.\n  Aims. We aim to identify the dominant heating mechanisms of the cold dust in\ntypical nearby spiral galaxies and explore the contributions of young and\nevolved stars to dust heating.\n  Methods. Using 18 large, face-on spiral galaxies from the DustPedia project,\nwe apply two complementary approaches: (1) correlation analysis between dust\ntemperature (T_dust), SFR surface density (Sigma_SFR), and stellar mass surface\ndensity (Sigma_Mstar); and (2) study of the relationship between T_dust and\ndust mass surface density (Sigma_dust).\n  Results. T_dust peaks at ~24 K in galaxy centers and drops to ~15 K at large\nradii. Galaxies with and without AGNs show similar T_dust profiles.

    "abstract": "Ocean wind waves are a fundamental manifestation of complex dynamics in\ngeophysical fluid systems, characterized by a rich interplay between dispersion\nand nonlinearity. While linear wave theory provides a first-order description\nof wave motion, real-world oceanic environments are governed by nonlinear\ninteractions that are responsible for a transfer of energy between waves of\ndifferent lengths. The pioneering research by O. Phillips, K. Hasselmann, and\nV. Zakharov in the 1960s introduced the concept that four-wave resonant\ninteractions serve as the primary mechanism for energy transfers among wave\ncomponents in oceanic surface wave fields. Although the presence and efficiency\nof these resonant interactions have been demonstrated in controlled determinist\nwave tank experiments, their direct identification in the real ocean, where a\nlarge number of random waves interact, has remained elusive. Here, using a\nstereoscopic system that enables the measurement of surface elevation in both\nspace and time, we provide experimental evidence of resonant interactions in\nocean wind waves. Our data not only reproduce the well-known figure-eight\npattern predicted by Phillips, but also reveal a continuum of different\nresonant configurations that closely match the theoretical predictions. These\nfindings support the validity of third-generation ocean wave models,\nstrengthening their ability to accurately capture wave dynamics in the ocean",

    "abstract": "Heavy neutral leptons (HNLs) are well-motivated new physics candidates. The\nmixing of sub-GeV HNLs with active neutrinos is severely constrained by\ncosmology. In particular, the success of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN)\nrequires the HNL lifetime to be shorter than about 0.02 sec if they were in\nthermal equilibrium, thus excluding a wide range of mixing angles accessible to\nterrestrial experiments. In order to justify the laboratory searches in this\ncosmologically-forbidden region, it is often argued that adding new dark sector\ndecay modes of HNLs can evade the stringent BBN constraint. Here we rule out\nthis possibility and show that, contrary to the naive expectation, HNLs with\nsignificant dark decay modes actually lead to stronger cosmological bounds.\nThis is mainly because of the increase in the extra radiation energy density in\nthe Universe around the BBN epoch, which causes observable effects in the\nprimordial helium fraction and $\\Delta N_{\\rm eff}$.

Defined by oxygen dependence at 36 weeks\npostmenstrual age, it causes lifelong respiratory complications. However,\npreventive interventions carry severe risks, including neurodevelopmental\nimpairment, ventilator-induced lung injury, and systemic complications.\nTherefore, early BPD prognosis and prediction of BPD outcome is crucial to\navoid unnecessary toxicity in low risk infants. Admission radiographs of\nextremely preterm infants are routinely acquired within 24h of life and could\nserve as a non-invasive prognostic tool. In this work, we developed and\ninvestigated a deep learning approach using chest X-rays from 163 extremely\nlow-birth-weight infants ($\\leq$32 weeks gestation, 401-999g) obtained within\n24 hours of birth. We fine-tuned a ResNet-50 pretrained specifically on adult\nchest radiographs, employing progressive layer freezing with discriminative\nlearning rates to prevent overfitting and evaluated a CutMix augmentation and\nlinear probing. For moderate/severe BPD outcome prediction, our best performing\nmodel with progressive freezing, linear probing and CutMix achieved an AUROC of\n0.78 $\\pm$ 0.10, balanced accuracy of 0.69 $\\pm$ 0.10, and an F1-score of 0.67\n$\\pm$ 0.11. In-domain pre-training significantly outperformed ImageNet\ninitialization (p = 0.031) which confirms domain-specific pretraining to be\nimportant for BPD outcome prediction. Routine IRDS grades showed limited\nprognostic value (AUROC 0.57 $\\pm$ 0.11), confirming the need of learned\nmarkers. Our approach demonstrates that domain-specific pretraining enables\naccurate BPD prediction from routine day-1 radiographs.

Naturally occurring fluoride and industrial runoff can\nresult in concentrations far exceeding the World Health Organization's\nrecommended limits in water supplies. In this study, we derive a model\nincorporating the dominant mechanisms governing fluoride removal from drinking\nwater using the two adsorbents mineral-rich carbon (MRC) and chemically treated\nmineral-rich carbon (TMRC). Using both new and previously published\nexperimental data, we validate the model for MRC, TMRC, and their mixture,\nusing both batch and column data. Despite the filters containing approximately\n40:1 MRC:TMRC ratio by mass, we find that TMRC dominates fluoride removal,\nwhile MRC contributes at early and late times. The full column model, which\nuses parameters from isotherm batch studies, achieves excellent agreement with\nexperimental breakthrough data across varying inlet concentrations and flow\nrates (R$^2>0.991$, SSE$<0.0632$). Motivated by this, we propose a reduced\nmodel based solely on TMRC adsorption, with a single fitting parameter, which\nstill performs well across all breakthrough curves (R$^2 > 0.983$, SSE\n$<0.117$). The simplicity of this model means that it is straightforward and\ninexpensive to work with numerically. In both models, batch and column\nbehaviours are reconciled and, for the case of breakthrough curves with varying\ninlet concentrations, a set of globally optimised parameters is found. The\nstrong agreement with experimental data supports the model's robustness and\nreinforces the physical interpretability of its parameters. These models for\nMRC and TMRC provide a foundation for filter optimisation and future efforts\naimed at improving fluoride removal in resource-limited settings.",

The scalar\nfield possesses a nonzero vacuum expectation value (VEV) during inflation, so\nthat its interaction with the axion effectively serves as an explicit\nPeccei-Quinn (PQ) violating term. At a temperature below the PQ phase\ntransition, the effective PQ violating interaction generates the axion\npotential which generally contains multiple degenerate vacua leading to the\nformation of the axion string-domain wall networks. The following QCD phase\ntransition provides another contribution to the axion potential making domain\nwalls decay before they dominate the Universe. Later, the scalar field starts\nto relax to the minimum of its potential with a vanishing VEV, turning off the\neffective PQ violating interaction so that the axion potential is aligned with\nthe QCD vacuum. We keep track of the evolution of the axion-scalar system and\ndiscuss the production of the axion DM through the domain wall decay and the\n(trapped) misalignment. We find that the string-wall network in some cases can\ndecay due to its structural instability, rather than the volume pressure, and\nthe correct axion DM abundance is realized with the decay constant larger than\nthat of the conventional post-inflationary QCD axion without fine tuning.",

    "abstract": "The elastic properties of the neutron star crust are thought to play a\ncrucial role in various phenomena of neutron stars (glitches, oscillations,\ngravitational wave emission) and should be described quantitatively to model\nthese phenomena. The fundamental problem of this description is associated with\nthe polycrystalline nature of the crust: similar to terrestrial materials, the\nelastic moduli, strictly speaking, depend on the shape and orientation of\ncrystallites, but for the crust, they are unknown. As a result, some\nassumptions are generally required to predict the elastic properties or\nconstrain their possible range. In this paper, we follow the commonly believed\nassumption that the crust is (locally) isotropic, which allows us to describe\nelastic properties by two (effective) parameters: bulk and shear moduli. The\nbulk modulus is well determined by the Voigt-Reuss bounds, and we constrain the\nshear modulus by applying, for the first time in astrophysics of compact stars,\nthe variational Hashin-Shtrikman approach, based on the additional assumption\nthat there are no correlations in the orientation of crystallites. We analyse\nthe Hashin-Shtrikman bounds for the one-component crust taking into account the\nelectron screening and the motion of the nuclei, and for two-component static\ncrystals. In particular, we demonstrate that within applied assumptions the\neffective shear modulus should be lower than the Voigt estimate, typically\napplied in the astrophysical literature.",

The introduction of optical switches in DCNs as a future-proof\nsolution exacerbates this problem due to several properties of optical\nswitches, such as the fact that they are generally bufferless and therefore\nrely on centralized scheduling, and that they have long switching times and\ntherefore require the number of rearrangements to be minimized.\n  In this paper, we propose a centralized scheduling algorithm that achieves\ntheoretical maximum throughput even in one-rate bidirectional Clos networks,\nwhile producing schemes with near-minimal numbers of rearrangements. It is the\nonly algorithm that directly supports bidirectional Clos networks and has a\ntime efficiency high enough to support dynamic scheduling to date. For static\nminimal rewiring, its running time ranges from a fraction to a few hundredths\nof other algorithms, and the number of rearrangements has also been steadily\nimproved, allowing for more frequent adjustments and less impact on ongoing\ncommunications.

    "abstract": "Direct numerical simulation of turbulent flows at high Reynolds numbers\nremains a major challenge for traditional computational fluid dynamics (CFD)\ntools running on classical computer hardware. This has motivated growing\ninterest in quantum algorithms for CFD to enable flow simulations on quantum\ncomputers. The reason being that these computers are expected to deliver\npotential speed-ups for certain problems. One promising quantum CFD approach is\na fully quantum implementation of the lattice Boltzmann method called QLBM.\nAlthough efficient quantum routines are now available for the streaming step,\nimplementing the nonlinear, irreversible collision step with a low depth\ncircuit that avoids additional ancilla qubits, probabilistic post-selection and\nrepeated executions remains a significant challenge. In this study, we address\nthis challenge by introducing a framework for learning a surrogate quantum\ncircuit (SQC) that approximates the full Bhatnagar Gross Krook (BGK) collision\noperator for the D2Q9 lattice. The four qubit circuit is trained to respect the\nphysical properties of the BGK collision operator, including mass and momentum\nconservation, D8 equivariance and scale equivariance. When compiled to the gate\nset used by IBM Heron processor under the assumption of full qubit\nconnectivity, the 15 block SQC requires only 2,430 native gates and uses\nneither ancilla qubits nor post-selection or repeated executions. Moreover, its\ndepth is independent of the grid resolution, as collision is a local operation\nthat can exploit quantum parallelism to its full extent. We validate the SQC on\ntwo benchmark flows, the Taylor Green vortex decay and the lid driven cavity,\ndemonstrating that it accurately captures vortex dissipation and flow\nrecirculation.",

Design automation in the QEC flow\nis thus critical, enabling automated synthesis, transpilation, layout, and\nverification of error-corrected circuits to reduce qubit footprints and push\nfault-tolerance margins. This chapter presents a comprehensive treatment of\ndesign automation in QEC, structured into four main sections. The first section\ndelves into the theoretical aspects of QEC, covering logical versus physical\nqubit representations, stabilizer code construction, and error syndrome\nextraction mechanisms. In the second section, we outline the QEC design flow,\ndetailing the areas highlighting the need for design automation. The third\nsection surveys recent advancements in design automation techniques, including\nalgorithmic $T$-gate optimization, modified surface code architecture to\nincorporate lesser qubit overhead, and machine-learning-based decoder\nautomation. The final section examines near-term FTQC architectures,\nintegrating automated QEC pipelines into scalable hardware platforms and\ndiscussing end-to-end verification methodologies.

This behaviour,\nobserved through numerical simulations using truncated bosonic annihilation and\ncreation operators, appeared in several properties of these states, including\ntheir average photon number. The authors argued that these oscillations reflect\na genuine physical effect. Here, however, we demonstrate that the observed\noscillatory behaviour is a consequence of numerical artefacts. A numerical\nanalysis reveals that the oscillations are highly sensitive to the truncation\nof the Fock basis, indicating a lack of convergence. This is further supported\nby a theoretical analysis of the Taylor series of the average photon number,\nsuggesting that these generalized squeezed states contain infinite energy after\na finite value of the squeezing parameter. Finally, we provide an analytical\nproof that the average photon number of any generalized squeezed state is a\nnon-decreasing function, thereby ruling out the possibility of intrinsic\noscillatory dynamics.

    "abstract": "Recommender systems can be found everywhere today, shaping our everyday\nexperience whenever we're consuming content, ordering food, buying groceries\nonline, or even just reading the news. Let's imagine we're in the process of\nbuilding a recommender system to make content suggestions to users on social\nmedia. When thinking about fairness, it becomes clear there are several\nperspectives to consider: the users asking for tailored suggestions, the\ncontent creators hoping for some limelight, and society at large, navigating\nthe repercussions of algorithmic recommendations. A shared fairness concern\nacross all three is the emergence of filter bubbles, a side-effect that takes\nplace when recommender systems are almost \"too good\", making recommendations so\ntailored that users become inadvertently confined to a narrow set of\nopinions/themes and isolated from alternative ideas. From the user's\nperspective, this is akin to manipulation. From the small content creator's\nperspective, this is an obstacle preventing them access to a whole range of\npotential fans. From society's perspective, the potential consequences are\nfar-reaching, influencing collective opinions, social behavior and political\ndecisions. How can our recommender system be fine-tuned to avoid the creation\nof filter bubbles, and ensure a more inclusive and diverse content landscape?\nApproaching this problem involves defining one (or more) performance metric to\nrepresent diversity, and tweaking our recommender system's performance through\nthe lens of fairness. By incorporating this metric into our evaluation\nframework, we aim to strike a balance between personalized recommendations and\nthe broader societal goal of fostering rich and varied cultures and points of\nview.",

Among PAIC methods,\nMatching-Adjusted Indirect Comparison (MAIC) is the most widely used. However,\nlittle is known about how MAIC performs under challenging conditions such as\nlimited covariate overlap or markedly non-normal covariate distributions.\n  We conducted a Monte Carlo simulation study comparing three estimators: (i)\nMAIC matching first moment (MAIC-1), (ii) MAIC matching first and second\nmoments (MAIC-2), and (iii) a benchmark method leveraging full IPD --\nPropensity Score Weighting (PSW). We examined eight scenarios ranging from\nideal conditions to situations with positivity violations and non-normal\n(including bimodal) covariate distributions. We assessed both anchored and\nunanchored estimators and examined the impact of adjustment model\nmisspecification.

All methods showed\nsubstantial bias when key confounders were omitted, emphasizing the importance\nof correct model specification. In real-world data, a consistent trend was\nfound with MAIC-1 showing narrower confidence intervals with positivity\nviolation.\n  Our findings support the cautious use of unanchored MAICs and highlight\nMAIC-1's resilience across moderate violations of assumptions.

    "abstract": "Recent research has focused extensively on constructing binary\nself-orthogonal (SO) linear codes due to their applications in quantum\ninformation theory, lattice design, and related areas. Despite significant\nactivity, the fundamental characterization remains unchanged: binary SO codes\nare necessarily even (all codeword weights even), while doubly-even codes\n(weights divisible by $4$) are automatically SO.\n  This paper advances the theory by addressing the understudied case of\nsingly-even (even but not doubly-even) SO codes. We first provide a complete\ncharacterization of binary SO linear codes, and a necessary and sufficient\ncondition for binary SO singly-even linear codes is given. Moreover, we give a\ngeneral approach to generating many binary SO linear codes from two known SO\nlinear codes, yielding three infinite classes of binary SO singly-even linear\ncodes with few weights. Note that these new codes are also minimal and violate\nthe Aschikhmin-Barg condition. Their weight distributions are determined.\nFurthermore, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for a Boolean\nfunction $f$ such that the linear code proposed from $f$ via a well-known\ngeneric construction is SO singly-even, and a general approach to constructing\nBoolean functions satisfying this condition is provided, yielding several\ninfinite classes of binary SO singly-even minimal linear codes with few\nweights. Finally, we would like to emphasize that using the methods in this\npaper, we can construct more binary linear codes that are SO, singly-even,\nminimal, violating the AB condition, and with few weights at the same time.",

In the work at hand, we advocate Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) for\nmicromechanics, empowering them by insights from computational micromechanics\nmethods based on the fast Fourier transform (FFT). We construct an FNO\nsurrogate mimicking the basic scheme foundational for FFT-based methods and\nshow that the resulting operator predicts solutions to cell problems with\narbitrary stiffness distribution only subject to a material-contrast constraint\nup to a desired accuracy. In particular, there are no restrictions on the\nmaterial symmetry like isotropy, on the number of phases and on the geometry of\nthe interfaces between materials. Also, the provided fidelity is sharp and\nuniform, providing explicit guarantees leveraging our physical empowerment of\nFNOs. To show the desired universal approximation property, we construct an FNO\nexplicitly that requires no training to begin with. Still, the obtained neural\noperator complies with the same memory requirements as the basic scheme and\ncomes with runtimes proportional to classical FFT solvers. In particular,\nlarge-scale problems with more than 100 million voxels are readily handled.

    "abstract": "Understanding how well future cosmological experiments can reconstruct the\nmechanism that generated primordial inhomogeneities is key to assessing the\nextent to which cosmology can inform fundamental physics. In this work, we\napply a quantum metrology tool - the quantum Fisher information - to the\nsqueezed quantum state describing cosmological perturbations at the end of\ninflation. This quantifies the ultimate precision achievable in parameter\nestimation, assuming ideal access to early-universe information. By comparing\nthe quantum Fisher information to its classical counterpart - derived from\nmeasurements of the curvature perturbation power spectrum alone (homodyne\nmeasurement) - we evaluate how close current observations come to this quantum\nlimit. Focusing on the tensor-to-scalar ratio as a case study, we find that the\ngap between classical and quantum Fisher information grows exponentially with\nthe number of e-folds a mode spends outside the horizon. This suggests the\nexistence of a highly efficient (but presently inaccessible) optimal\nmeasurement. Conversely, we show that accessing the decaying mode of\ninflationary perturbations is a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for\nexponentially improving the inference of the tensor-to-scalar ratio.",

We first derive the gravitational-wave strain\nthat would be generated by the passage of such a dark matter clump. We find\nthat the strain is primarily sourced by the Newtonian gravitational\nacceleration of the mirrors toward the clump and by the Shapiro time delay of\nthe photons in the laser beams as they pass through the gravitational potential\ncreated by the dark matter clump. We also find that the Newtonian acceleration\neffect dominates the gravitational-wave strain for both ground and space-based\ninterferometers. We then compare our dark matter clump, gravitational-wave\nstrain model to 84 Koi-Fish glitches detected during the second observing run\nof the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA collaboration through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo\nBayesian analysis. We find that all glitches but 9 can be confidently rejected\nas having originated from dark matter clumps. For the remaining glitches, the\ndark matter hypothesis cannot be excluded, and the maximum \\textit{a\nposteriori} parameters yield minimum densities of about $10^{-7}\n{\\rm{g}}/{\\rm{cm}}^3$, within the model. These results allow us to place the\nfirst direct upper limits with gravitational-wave detectors on the local\nover-density of dark matter in the form of clumps in the local neighborhood of\nEarth, namely $\\rho_{{\\rm DM} \\, {\\rm clumps}} \\lesssim 10^{-15}\n{\\rm{g}}/{\\rm{cm}}^{-3}$.",

Indeed, this was a\nprimary source of skepticism regarding the feasibility of DNNs in the early\ndays of the field. The past decades of progress in deep learning have revealed\nthis skepticism to be misplaced, and a large body of empirical evidence shows\nthat sufficiently large DNNs following standard training protocols exhibit\nwell-behaved optimization dynamics that converge to performant solutions. This\nsuccess has biased the community to use convex optimization as a mental model\nfor learning, leading to a focus on training efficiency, either in terms of\nrequired iteration, FLOPs or wall-clock time, when improving optimizers. We\nargue that, while this perspective has proven extremely fruitful, another\nperspective specific to DNNs has received considerably less attention: the\noptimizer not only influences the rate of convergence, but also the qualitative\nproperties of the learned solutions. Restated, the optimizer can and will\nencode inductive biases and change the effective expressivity of a given class\nof models. Furthermore, we believe the optimizer can be an effective way of\nencoding desiderata in the learning process. We contend that the community\nshould aim at understanding the biases of already existing methods, as well as\naim to build new optimizers with the explicit intent of inducing certain\nproperties of the solution, rather than solely judging them based on their\nconvergence rates. We hope our arguments will inspire research to improve our\nunderstanding of how the learning process can impact the type of solution we\nconverge to, and lead to a greater recognition of optimizers design as a\ncritical lever that complements the roles of architecture and data in shaping\nmodel outcomes.",

Existing synchronization methods,\nsuch as the previous-tick approach, suffer from information loss and create\nartificial price staleness. We introduce a novel framework that recasts the\ndata synchronization challenge as a constrained matrix completion problem. Our\napproach recovers the potential matrix of high-frequency price increments by\nminimizing its nuclear norm -- capturing the underlying low-rank factor\nstructure -- subject to a large-scale linear system derived from observed,\nasynchronous price changes. Theoretically, we prove the existence and\nuniqueness of our estimator and establish its convergence rate. A key\ntheoretical insight is that our method accurately and robustly leverages\ninformation from both frequently and infrequently traded assets, overcoming a\ncritical difficulty of efficiency loss in traditional methods. Empirically,\nusing extensive simulations and a large panel of S&P 500 stocks, we demonstrate\nthat our method substantially outperforms established benchmarks. It not only\nachieves significantly lower synchronization errors, but also corrects the bias\nin systematic risk estimates (i.e., eigenvalues) and the estimate of betas\ncaused by stale prices. Crucially, portfolios constructed using our\nsynchronized data yield consistently and economically significant higher\nout-of-sample Sharpe ratios. Our framework provides a powerful tool for\nuncovering the true dynamics of asset prices, with direct implications for\nhigh-frequency risk management, algorithmic trading, and econometric inference.",

As\nlargely a pedagogical exercise, in this paper we present additional analysis\ninto the astrodynamics of 3I/ATLAS, and hypothesize that this object could be\ntechnological, and possibly hostile as would be expected from the 'Dark Forest'\nresolution to the 'Fermi Paradox'. We show that 3I/ATLAS approaches\nsurprisingly close to Venus, Mars and Jupiter, with a probability of $\\lesssim\n0.005$\\%. Furthermore the low retrograde tilt of 3I/ATLAS's orbital plane to\nthe ecliptic offers various benefits to an Extra-terrestrial Intelligence\n(ETI), since it allows the object access to our planet with relative impunity.\nThe eclipse by the Sun from Earth of 3I/ATLAS at perihelion, would allow it to\nconduct a clandestine reverse Solar Oberth Manoeuvre, an optimal high-thrust\nstrategy for interstellar spacecraft to brake and stay bound to the Sun. An\noptimal intercept of Earth would entail an arrival in late November/early\nDecember of 2025, and also, a non-gravitational acceleration of $\\sim{5.9}\n\\times 10^{-5}$ au day$^{-2}$, normalized at 1 au from the Sun, would indicate\nan intent to intercept the planet Jupiter, not far off its path, and a strategy\nto rendezvous with it after perihelion.",

This study\ninvestigates how four different generative AI models understand and express\nugliness through text and image and explores the biases embedded within these\nrepresentations. We extracted 13 adjectives associated with ugliness through\niterative prompting of a large language model and generated 624 images across\nfour AI models and three prompts. Demographic and socioeconomic attributes\nwithin the images were independently coded and thematically analyzed. Our\nfindings show that AI models disproportionately associate ugliness with old\nwhite male figures, reflecting entrenched social biases as well as paradoxical\nbiases, where efforts to avoid stereotypical depictions of marginalized groups\ninadvertently result in the disproportionate projection of negative attributes\nonto majority groups. Qualitative analysis further reveals that, despite\nsupposed attempts to frame ugliness within social contexts, conventional\nphysical markers such as asymmetry and aging persist as central visual motifs.\nThese findings demonstrate that despite attempts to create more equal\nrepresentations, generative AI continues to perpetuate inherited and\nparadoxical biases, underscoring the critical work being done to create ethical\nAI training paradigms and advance methodologies for more inclusive AI\ndevelopment.",

Based on our analytical\nresults, the root raised cosine (RRC) pulse generally results in a higher\nmaximum PAPR compared to the rectangular pulse.

Additionally, through detailed modeling of each\ncycle process, particularly the recycling process, and utilizing the gas-phase\nmass-metallicity relation (MZR) at $z=0$ as a constraint, our model establishes\na relation between the recycle fraction and halo mass. It is found that the\nfraction of gas recycled from the outflow is a function of halo mass, with a\nvalue of $25\\%$ in galaxies with halo mass $\\sim10^{10.4}M_{\\rm \\odot}$,\nincreasing to $75\\%$ in halos with mass $\\sim 10^{12}M_{\\rm \\odot}$.

Even with post-hoc refinement techniques such as flow matching, these\nmethods fail to recover fine-grained details (e.g., prosodic nuances,\nspeaker-specific timbres), especially in challenging scenarios like singing\nvoice or music synthesis. We propose QTTS, a novel TTS framework built upon our\nnew audio codec, QDAC. The core innovation of QDAC lies in its end-to-end\ntraining of an ASR-based auto-regressive network with a GAN, which achieves\nsuperior semantic feature disentanglement for scalable, near-lossless\ncompression. QTTS models these discrete codes using two innovative strategies:\nthe Hierarchical Parallel architecture, which uses a dual-AR structure to model\ninter-codebook dependencies for higher-quality synthesis, and the Delay\nMultihead approach, which employs parallelized prediction with a fixed delay to\naccelerate inference speed. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed\nframework achieves higher synthesis quality and better preserves expressive\ncontent compared to baseline.

To address these issues,\nquantization can be selectively applied to only a subset of layers, but\nselecting which layers to exclude is non-trivial. To this direction, we propose\nTuneQn, a suite enabling selective quantization, deployment and execution of\nONNX models across various CPU and GPU devices, combined with profiling and\nmulti-objective optimization. TuneQn generates selectively quantized ONNX\nmodels, deploys them on different hardware, measures performance on metrics\nlike accuracy and size, performs Pareto Front minimization to identify the best\nmodel candidate and visualizes the results. To demonstrate the effectiveness of\nTuneQn, we evaluated TuneQn on four ONNX models with two quantization settings\nacross CPU and GPU devices. As a result, we demonstrated that our utility\neffectively performs selective quantization and tuning, selecting ONNX model\ncandidates with up to a $54.14$% reduction in accuracy loss compared to the\nfully quantized model, and up to a $72.9$% model size reduction compared to the\noriginal model.",

In this work, a uniform LGL\nmethod is proposed, termed UniLGL, which simultaneously achieves spatial and\nmaterial uniformity, as well as sensor-type uniformity. The key idea of the\nproposed method is to encode the complete point cloud, which contains both\ngeometric and material information, into a pair of BEV images (i.e., a spatial\nBEV image and an intensity BEV image). An end-to-end multi-BEV fusion network\nis designed to extract uniform features, equipping UniLGL with spatial and\nmaterial uniformity. To ensure robust LGL across heterogeneous LiDAR sensors, a\nviewpoint invariance hypothesis is introduced, which replaces the conventional\ntranslation equivariance assumption commonly used in existing LPR networks and\nsupervises UniLGL to achieve sensor-type uniformity in both global descriptors\nand local feature representations. Finally, based on the mapping between local\nfeatures on the 2D BEV image and the point cloud, a robust global pose\nestimator is derived that determines the global minimum of the global pose on\nSE(3) without requiring additional registration. To validate the effectiveness\nof the proposed uniform LGL, extensive benchmarks are conducted in real-world\nenvironments, and the results show that the proposed UniLGL is demonstratively\ncompetitive compared to other State-of-the-Art LGL methods. Furthermore, UniLGL\nhas been deployed on diverse platforms, including full-size trucks and agile\nMicro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs), to enable high-precision localization and mapping\nas well as multi-MAV collaborative exploration in port and forest environments,\ndemonstrating the applicability of UniLGL in industrial and field scenarios.",

This\nleads to highly entangled features and strong black-box characteristics, making\nthe model prone to shortcut learning. To mitigate the above issues, this paper\nproposes a wavelet-based low-light stereo image enhancement method with feature\nspace decoupling. Our insight comes from the following findings: (1) Wavelet\ntransform enables the independent processing of low-frequency and\nhigh-frequency information. (2) Illumination adjustment can be achieved by\nadjusting the low-frequency component of a low-light image, extracted through\nmulti-level wavelet decomposition. Thus, by using wavelet transform the feature\nspace is decomposed into a low-frequency branch for illumination adjustment and\nmultiple high-frequency branches for texture enhancement. Additionally, stereo\nlow-light image enhancement can extract useful cues from another view to\nimprove enhancement. To this end, we propose a novel high-frequency guided\ncross-view interaction module (HF-CIM) that operates within high-frequency\nbranches rather than across the entire feature space, effectively extracting\nvaluable image details from the other view. Furthermore, to enhance the\nhigh-frequency information, a detail and texture enhancement module (DTEM) is\nproposed based on cross-attention mechanism. The model is trained on a dataset\nconsisting of images with uniform illumination and images with non-uniform\nillumination. Experimental results on both real and synthetic images indicate\nthat our algorithm offers significant advantages in light adjustment while\neffectively recovering high-frequency information.

Out-of-domain\nuncertainty arises when the system operates under conditions not represented in\nthe initial training dataset, while in-domain uncertainty results from\nreal-world variability and flaws in the model structure or training process. To\nhandle out-of-domain uncertainty, a slow learning component, inspired by the\nhuman brain's slow thinking process, learns system dynamics under unexplored\noperating conditions, and it is activated only when a monitoring strategy deems\nit necessary. This component consists of an ensemble of models, featuring (i) a\ncombination rule that weights individual models based on the statistical\nproximity between their training data and the current operating condition, and\n(ii) a monitoring algorithm based on statistical control charts that supervises\nthe ensemble's reliability and triggers the offline training and integration of\na new model when a new operating condition is detected. To address in-domain\nuncertainty, a fast learning component, inspired by the human brain's fast\nthinking process, continuously compensates in real time for the mismatch of the\nslow learning model. This component is implemented as a Gaussian process (GP)\nmodel, trained online at each iteration using recent data while discarding\nolder samples.

We\nprovide theoretical guarantees for the algorithm's underlying scheme which say\nthat the performance loss is bounded by the average of the sampling\napproximation errors rather than the usual maximum, a crucial requirement given\nthe sampling sparsity of online planning. Empirical evaluations on two\nlarge-scale problems with dynamically evolving environments -- including a\nhelicopter emergency scenario in the Corsica region requiring approximately 150\nplanning steps -- corroborate the theoretical results and indicate that our\nsolver considerably outperforms current online benchmarks.",

While game-theoretic methods\nare widely acknowledged for their effectiveness in managing multi-agent\ninteractions, significant impediments persist when it comes to accommodating\nthe intentional uncertainties of agents. In the context of intentional\nuncertainties, the heavy computational burdens associated with existing\ngame-theoretic methods are induced, leading to inefficiencies and poor\nscalability. In this paper, we propose a novel game-theoretic interactive\ntrajectory planning method to effectively address the intentional uncertainties\nof agents, and it demonstrates both high efficiency and enhanced scalability.\nAs the underpinning basis, we model the interactions between agents under\nintentional uncertainties as a general Bayesian game, and we show that its\nagent-form equivalence can be represented as a potential game under certain\nminor assumptions. The existence and attainability of the optimal interactive\ntrajectories are illustrated, as the corresponding Bayesian Nash equilibrium\ncan be attained by optimizing a unified optimization problem. Additionally, we\npresent a distributed algorithm based on the dual consensus alternating\ndirection method of multipliers (ADMM) tailored to the parallel solving of the\nproblem, thereby significantly improving the scalability. The attendant\noutcomes from simulations and experiments demonstrate that the proposed method\nis effective across a range of scenarios characterized by general forms of\nintentional uncertainties.

In this\nwork we develop a novel method which improves upon these assumptions and\nreconstructs the underlying true galaxy field, respecting the spatial\ncorrelation of galaxies on large scales. In our method the true magnitude\ndistribution of galaxies is inferred alongside the spatial galaxy distribution.\nOur method results in an improved three-dimensional prior in redshift and sky\nposition for the host galaxy of a GW event, which is expected to make the\nresulting $H_0$ posterior more robust. Building on our previous work, we make a\nnumber of improvements, and validate our method on simulated data based on the\nMillennium simulation.",

    "abstract": "The Lyman-$\\alpha$ forest of high redshift quasars is a powerful probe of the\nlate stages of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), particularly through the\npresence of Gunn-Peterson troughs. These troughs span a broad range of lengths\n(up to $\\sim 100$ Mpc), suggesting large-scale coherent structures in the\nintergalactic medium. We aim to gain insight into the presence, extent, and\nmagnitude of correlations in the Lyman-$\\alpha$ forest at $5<z<6.1$, and to\nquantify the scales over which correlations are significant to inform on the\nnecessary volume for simulating the EoR. Using the extended XQR-30 dataset and\naccounting for the relevant systematics, we compute the flux correlation matrix\nand perform an MCMC analysis to quantify the extent and strength of the\ncorrelation. To interpret our results, we compare to $1.5^3,\\mathrm{Gpc}^3$\nlightcones of Lyman-$\\alpha$ transmission fluxes from several reionization\nscenarios, including a fiducial box employing SCRIPT. We detect strong\ncorrelations at $z > 5.3$, extending at least tens of Mpc and strongly\nincreasing with redshift. Our results suggest a redshift-dependent correlation\nlength, from $L \\leq 26.53\\, (68.47)$ Mpc at 1-$\\sigma$ (2-$\\sigma$) limit at\n$z = 5.0$ to $L = 252.72^{+272.61}_{-41.61}$ Mpc at $z = 6.1$. In contrast, all\nsimulation models predict shorter correlation lengths ($< 60$ Mpc) and a slower\nredshift evolution. The presence and redshift-dependence of correlations in the\nLyman-$\\alpha$ forest on $>200$ Mpc scales at $z=6$ indicates that cosmological\nsimulations should be larger than this scale to adequately sample the\nLyman-$\\alpha$ forest. Despite implementing a fluctuating UVB and numerous\nneutral islands at $z<6$, our fiducial SCRIPT-based simulation fails to\nreproduce the large-scale correlations. It may be that those ingredients are\nnecessary, but not sufficient, to understanding the unfolding of the EoR.",

The SM method combines the\ncomputational efficiency of EM single-physics simulations with the precision of\nmultiphysics simulations. The shared coarse model is based on EM single-physics\nresponses corresponding to various nontunable design parameters values.\nConversely, the fine model is implemented to delineate the behavior of\nmultiphysics responses concerning both nontunable and tunable design parameter\nvalues. The proposed overall surrogate model comprises multiple subsurrogate\nmodels, each consisting of one shared coarse model and two distinct mapping\nneural networks. The responses from the shared coarse model in the EM\nsingle-physics filed offer a suitable approximation for the fine responses in\nthe multiphysics filed, whereas the mapping neural networks facilitate\ntransition from the EM single-physics field to the multiphysics field. Each\nsubsurrogate model maintains consistent nontunable design parameter values but\npossesses unique tunable design parameter values. By developing multiple\nsubsurrogate models, optimization can be simultaneously performed for each\ntuning state. Nontunable design parameter values are constrained by all tuning\nstates, whereas tunable design parameter values are confined to their\nrespective tuning states. This optimization technique simultaneously accounts\nfor all the tuning states to fulfill the necessary multiple tuning state\nrequirements. Multiple EM and multiphysics training samples are generated\nconcurrently to develop the surrogate model.

    "abstract": "As industrial autonomous ground vehicles are increasingly deployed in\nsafety-critical environments, ensuring their safe operation under diverse\nconditions is paramount. This paper presents a novel approach for their safety\nverification based on systematic situation extraction, probabilistic modelling\nand verification. We build upon the concept of a situation coverage grid, which\nexhaustively enumerates environmental configurations relevant to the vehicle's\noperation. This grid is augmented with quantitative probabilistic data\ncollected from situation-based system testing, capturing probabilistic\ntransitions between situations. We then generate a probabilistic model that\nencodes the dynamics of both normal and unsafe system behaviour. Safety\nproperties extracted from hazard analysis and formalised in temporal logic are\nverified through probabilistic model checking against this model. The results\ndemonstrate that our approach effectively identifies high-risk situations,\nprovides quantitative safety guarantees, and supports compliance with\nregulatory standards, thereby contributing to the robust deployment of\nautonomous systems.",

While\nmost existing FGIR methods rely on backbones pretrained on large-scale datasets\nlike ImageNet, this dependence limits adaptability to resource-constrained\nenvironments and hinders the development of task-specific architectures\ntailored to the unique challenges of FGIR.\n  In this work, we challenge the conventional reliance on pretrained models by\ndemonstrating that high-performance FGIR systems can be trained entirely from\nscratch. We introduce a novel training framework, TGDA, that integrates\ndata-aware augmentation with weak supervision via a fine-grained-aware teacher\nmodel, implemented through knowledge distillation. This framework unlocks the\ndesign of task-specific and hardware-aware architectures, including LRNets for\nlow-resolution FGIR and ViTFS, a family of Vision Transformers optimized for\nefficient inference.\n  Extensive experiments across three FGIR benchmarks over diverse settings\ninvolving low-resolution and high-resolution inputs show that our method\nconsistently matches or surpasses state-of-the-art pretrained counterparts. In\nparticular, in the low-resolution setting, LRNets trained with TGDA improve\naccuracy by up to 23\\% over prior methods while requiring up to 20.6x less\nparameters, lower FLOPs, and significantly less training data. Similarly,\nViTFS-T can match the performance of a ViT B-16 pretrained on ImageNet-21k\nwhile using 15.3x fewer trainable parameters and requiring orders of magnitudes\nless data.

While several pioneering approaches have attempted to address\nthis issue using differentiable rendering or novel view synthesis, they are\noften limited by time-consuming optimization and refinement processes under\nill-posed conditions. To tackle above challenges, we propose SmokeSVD, an\nefficient and effective framework to progressively generate and reconstruct\ndynamic smoke from a single video by integrating both the powerful generative\ncapabilities from diffusion models and physically guided consistency\noptimization towards realistic appearance and dynamic evolution. Specifically,\nwe first propose a physically guided side-view synthesizer based on diffusion\nmodels, which explicitly incorporates divergence and gradient guidance of\nvelocity fields to generate visually realistic and spatio-temporally consistent\nside-view images frame by frame, significantly alleviating the ill-posedness of\nsingle-view reconstruction without imposing additional constraints.\nSubsequently, we determine a rough estimation of density field from the pair of\nfront-view input and side-view synthetic image, and further refine 2D blurry\nnovel-view images and 3D coarse-grained density field through an iterative\nprocess that progressively renders and enhances the images from increasing\nnovel viewing angles, generating high-quality multi-view image sequences.\nFinally, we reconstruct and estimate the fine-grained density field, velocity\nfield, and smoke source via differentiable advection by leveraging the\nNavier-Stokes equations.

This peculiar phase, which resembles the well-known Bose glass\nphase, may occur even for commensurate twist angles and is further enhanced\nwhen the twisting is incommensurate.

Sidewalk delivery\nrobots, increasingly deployed in urban environments, offer a promising solution\nto these limitations. This paper explores how these robots can serve as mobile\ndata collection platforms, capturing sidewalk-level features related to\nwalkability in a scalable, automated, and real-time manner. A sensor-equipped\nrobot was deployed on a sidewalk network at KTH in Stockholm, completing 101\ntrips covering 900 segments. From the collected data, different typologies of\nfeatures are derived, including robot trip characteristics (e.g., speed,\nduration), sidewalk conditions (e.g., width, surface unevenness), and sidewalk\nutilization (e.g., pedestrian density). Their walkability-related implications\nwere investigated with a series of analyses. The results demonstrate that\npedestrian movement patterns are strongly influenced by sidewalk\ncharacteristics, with higher density, reduced width, and surface irregularity\nassociated with slower and more variable trajectories. Notably, robot speed\nclosely mirrors pedestrian behavior, highlighting its potential as a proxy for\nassessing pedestrian dynamics.

However, this reliance on geometric\ninformation limits their usability in scenarios where the room layout is\nunknown or when perceptual realism (how a space sounds to a listener) is more\nimportant than strict physical accuracy. In this study, we propose an\nalternative strategy: conditioning RIR generation directly on a set of RIR\nacoustic parameters.

By\nspecifying how the space should sound instead of how it should look, our method\nenables more flexible and perceptually driven RIR generation.

Even on\nuniform metric spaces with sufficiently many points, the deterministic\ncompetitive ratio of weighted $k$-server is known to increase doubly\nexponentially with respect to $k$, while the behavior of its randomized\ncompetitive ratio is not fully understood. Specifically, no upper bound better\nthan doubly exponential is known, while the best known lower bound is singly\nexponential in $k$. In this paper, we close the exponential gap between these\nbounds by giving an $\\exp(O(k^2))$-competitive randomized online algorithm for\nthe weighted $k$-server problem on uniform metrics, thus breaking the doubly\nexponential barrier for deterministic algorithms for the first time. This is\nachieved by a recursively defined notion of a phase which, on the one hand,\nforces a lower bound on the cost of any offline solution, while, on the other\nhand, also admits a randomized online algorithm with bounded expected cost. The\nalgorithm is also recursive; it involves running several algorithms virtually\nand in parallel and following the decisions of one of them in a random order.\nWe also show that our techniques can be lifted to construct an\n$\\exp(O(k^2))$-competitive randomized online algorithm for the generalized\n$k$-server problem on weighted uniform metrics.",

    "abstract": "Plasmonic nanostructures enable efficient light-to-energy conversion by\nconcentrating optical energy into nanoscale volumes. A key mechanism in this\nprocess is chemical interface damping (CID), where surface plasmons are damped\nby adsorbed molecules, enabling the transfer of charge to adsorbed molecules.\nIn this study, we investigate the relationship between CID and\nadsorbate-induced changes in DC electrical resistivity for four molecular\nadsorbates-adenine, 4-aminothiophenol (ATP), biphenyl thiol (BPT), and\n1-dodecanethiol (DDT)-on gold surfaces. Our results reveal two distinct CID\nregimes. BPT causes CID via direct electronic transitions to the lowest\nunoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), which is centered at approx. 2 eV above\nthe Fermi level and can be resonantly excited by the plasmon. This mechanism is\ndependent on plasmon energy. In contrast, ATP, adenine and DDT lead to plasmon\ndamping through inelastic electron scattering at the metal-molecule interface.\nThis regime shows a weaker dependency on plasmon energy since it does not\ninvolve resonant electron excitation between hybridized metal-molecule states.\nThis same mechanism contributes to adsorbate-induced changes in DC resistivity,\nsuggesting that resistivity measurements can serve as a probe of plasmonic\nenergy transfer, as highlighted by the good correlation between the two\neffects. These findings provide new insights into the microscopic origins of\nplasmon damping and offer a unified framework for understanding metal-adsorbate\nenergy transfer.",

    "abstract": "Advancements in wireless and mobile technologies, including 5G advanced and\nthe envisioned 6G, are driving exponential growth in wireless devices. However,\nthis rapid expansion exacerbates spectrum scarcity, posing a critical\nchallenge. Dynamic spectrum allocation (DSA)--which relies on sensing and\ndynamically sharing spectrum--has emerged as an essential solution to address\nthis issue. While machine learning (ML) models hold significant potential for\nimproving spectrum sensing, their adoption in centralized ML-based DSA systems\nis limited by privacy concerns, bandwidth constraints, and regulatory\nchallenges. To overcome these limitations, distributed ML-based approaches such\nas Federated Learning (FL) offer promising alternatives. This work addresses\ntwo key challenges in FL-based spectrum sensing (FLSS). First, the scarcity of\nlabeled data for training FL models in practical spectrum sensing scenarios is\ntackled with a semi-supervised FL approach, combined with energy detection,\nenabling model training on unlabeled datasets. Second, we examine the security\nvulnerabilities of FLSS, focusing on the impact of data poisoning attacks. Our\nanalysis highlights the shortcomings of existing majority-based defenses in\ncountering such attacks. To address these vulnerabilities, we propose a novel\ndefense mechanism inspired by vaccination, which effectively mitigates data\npoisoning attacks without relying on majority-based assumptions. Extensive\nexperiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets validate our solutions,\ndemonstrating that FLSS can achieve near-perfect accuracy on unlabeled datasets\nand maintain Byzantine robustness against both targeted and untargeted data\npoisoning attacks, even when a significant proportion of participants are\nmalicious.",

However, these techniques often sacrifice accuracy by\nindependently pruning query (Q) and key (K) tokens, leading to performance\ndegradation due to overlooked token interactions. To address this limitation,\nwe introduce a novel {\\bf Block-based Symmetric Pruning and Fusion} for\nefficient ViT (BSPF-ViT) that optimizes the pruning of Q/K tokens jointly.\nUnlike previous methods that consider only a single direction, our approach\nevaluates each token and its neighbors to decide which tokens to retain by\ntaking token interaction into account. The retained tokens are compressed\nthrough a similarity fusion step, preserving key information while reducing\ncomputational costs. The shared weights of Q/K tokens create a symmetric\nattention matrix, allowing pruning only the upper triangular part for speed up.\nBSPF-ViT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art ViT methods at all pruning\nlevels, increasing ImageNet classification accuracy by 1.3% on DeiT-T and 2.0%\non DeiT-S, while reducing computational overhead by 50%.

    "abstract": "We present two extensive sets of 3500+1000 simulations of dark matter haloes\non the past light cone, and two corresponding sets of simulated (`mock') galaxy\ncatalogues that represent the Euclid spectroscopic sample. The simulations were\nproduced with the latest version of the PINOCCHIO code, and provide the\nlargest, public set of simulated skies. Mock galaxy catalogues were obtained by\npopulating haloes with galaxies using an halo occupation distribution (HOD)\nmodel extracted from the Flagship galaxy catalogue provided by Euclid\nCollaboration. The Geppetto set of 3500 simulated skies was obtained by tiling\na 1.2 Gpc/h box to cover a light-cone whose sky footprint is a circle of 30 deg\nradius, for an area of 2763 deg$^2$ and a minimum halo mass of\n$1.5\\times10^{11}$ Msun/h. The relatively small box size makes this set unfit\nfor measuring very large scales. The EuclidLargeBox set consists of 1000\nsimulations of 3.38 Gpc/h, with the same mass resolution and a footprint that\ncovers half of the sky, excluding the Milky Way zone of avoidance. From this we\nproduced a set of 1000 EuclidLargeMocks on the 30 deg radius footprint, whose\ncomoving volume is fully contained in the simulation box. We validated the two\nsets of catalogues by analysing number densities, power spectra, and 2-point\ncorrelation functions, showing that the Flagship spectroscopic catalogue is\nconsistent with being one of the realisations of the simulated sets, although\nwe noticed small deviations limited to the quadrupole at k>0.2 h/Mpc. We show\ncosmological parameter inference from these catalogues and demonstrate that\nusing one realisation of EuclidLargeMocks in place of the Flagship mock\nproduces the same posteriors, to within the expected shift given by sample\nvariance. These simulated skies will be used for the galaxy clustering analysis\nof Euclid's Data Release 1 (DR1).",

In addition, CDAD has\nalso been reported for achiral organic molecules at the interface to metallic\nsubstrates. For this latter case, we investigate two prototypical\n$\\pi$-conjugated molecules, namely tetracene and pentacene, whose frontier\norbitals have a similar shape but exhibit distinctly different symmetries. By\ncomparing experimental CDAD momentum maps with simulations within\ntime-dependent density functional theory, we show how the final state of the\nphotoelectron must be regarded as the source of the CDAD in such otherwise\nachiral systems. We gain additional insight into the mechanism by employing a\nsimple scattering model for the final state, which allows us to decompose the\nCDAD signal into partial wave contributions.",

    "abstract": "The exploration-exploitation trade-off constitutes one of the fundamental\nchallenges in reinforcement learning (RL), which is exacerbated in multi-agent\nreinforcement learning (MARL) due to the exponential growth of joint\nstate-action spaces. This paper proposes a topology-enhanced MARL (TPE-MARL)\nmethod for optimizing cooperative decision-making of connected and autonomous\nvehicles (CAVs) in mixed traffic. This work presents two primary contributions:\nFirst, we construct a game topology tensor for dynamic traffic flow,\neffectively compressing high-dimensional traffic state information and decrease\nthe search space for MARL algorithms. Second, building upon the designed game\ntopology tensor and using QMIX as the backbone RL algorithm, we establish a\ntopology-enhanced MARL framework incorporating visit counts and agent mutual\ninformation. Extensive simulations across varying traffic densities and CAV\npenetration rates demonstrate the effectiveness of TPE-MARL. Evaluations\nencompassing training dynamics, exploration patterns, macroscopic traffic\nperformance metrics, and microscopic vehicle behaviors reveal that TPE-MARL\nsuccessfully balances exploration and exploitation. Consequently, it exhibits\nsuperior performance in terms of traffic efficiency, safety, decision\nsmoothness, and task completion. Furthermore, the algorithm demonstrates\ndecision-making rationality comparable to or exceeding that of human drivers in\nboth mixed-autonomy and fully autonomous traffic scenarios.

Unlike iterative optimization-based\napproaches (e.g., gradient descent or other iterative solvers), our method\nleverages the structural characteristics of the FRS feature space. We figure\nout that individuals sharing the same attribute (e.g., gender or race) form an\nattributed subsphere. By utilizing such subspheres, our method achieves both\nnon-adaptiveness and a remarkably small number of queries. This eliminates the\nneed for relying on transferability and open-source surrogate models, which\nhave been a typical strategy when repeated adaptive queries to commercial FRSs\nare impossible. Despite requiring only a single non-adaptive query consisting\nof 100 face images, our method achieves a high success rate of over 93% against\nAWS's CompareFaces API at its default threshold. Furthermore, unlike many\nexisting attacks that perturb a given image, our method can deliberately\nproduce adversarial faces that impersonate the target identity while exhibiting\nhigh-level attributes chosen by the adversary.",

The resulting\ncloud-based platform supports a holistic real time decision making for green\nurban managers, technical experts and operational staff. It enables intelligent\ncontrol and management of urban green spaces using Tree Talker sensors,\nintegrated with soil moisture and water potential monitoring systems. Thanks to\npredictive models based on machine learning algorithms and real time data\nprovided by IoT sensors, irrigation of public parks can be optimized by\nproviding suggestions on when and how much water to apply. Customized alerts\nlayers are also activated warning users when monitored parameters, such as soil\ntemperature, humidity, or water potential, exceed predefined thresholds. This\nUse Case demonstrates how digitalization, IoT sensors fusion and technological\ninnovation can support sustainable urban governance, fostering environmental\nresilience and improving citizens quality of life.",

    "abstract": "Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation has emerged as a powerful paradigm for\ngrounding large language models with external structured knowledge. However,\nexisting Graph RAG methods struggle with temporal reasoning, due to their\ninability to model the evolving structure and order of real-world events. In\nthis work, we introduce DyG-RAG, a novel event-centric dynamic graph\nretrieval-augmented generation framework designed to capture and reason over\ntemporal knowledge embedded in unstructured text. To eliminate temporal\nambiguity in traditional retrieval units, DyG-RAG proposes Dynamic Event Units\n(DEUs) that explicitly encode both semantic content and precise temporal\nanchors, enabling accurate and interpretable time-aware retrieval. To capture\ntemporal and causal dependencies across events, DyG-RAG constructs an event\ngraph by linking DEUs that share entities and occur close in time, supporting\nefficient and meaningful multi-hop reasoning. To ensure temporally consistent\ngeneration, DyG-RAG introduces an event timeline retrieval pipeline that\nretrieves event sequences via time-aware traversal, and proposes a Time\nChain-of-Thought strategy for temporally grounded answer generation. This\nunified pipeline enables DyG-RAG to retrieve coherent, temporally ordered event\nsequences and to answer complex, time-sensitive queries that standard RAG\nsystems cannot resolve. Extensive experiments on temporal QA benchmarks\ndemonstrate that DyG-RAG significantly improves the accuracy and recall of\nthree typical types of temporal reasoning questions, paving the way for more\nfaithful and temporal-aware generation.

    "abstract": "The SaaS paradigm has revolutionized software distribution by offering\nflexible pricing options to meet diverse customer needs. However, the rapid\nexpansion of the SaaS market has introduced significant complexity for DevOps\nteams, who must manually manage and evolve pricing structures, an approach that\nis both time-consuming and prone to errors. The absence of automated tools for\npricing analysis restricts the ability to efficiently evaluate, optimize, and\nscale these models. This paper proposes leveraging intelligent pricing\n(iPricing), dynamic, machine-readable pricing models, as a solution to these\nchallenges. Intelligent pricing enables competitive analysis, streamlines\noperational decision-making, and supports continuous pricing evolution in\nresponse to market dynamics, leading to improved efficiency and accuracy. We\npresent an LLM-driven approach that automates the transformation of static HTML\npricing into iPricing, significantly improving efficiency and consistency while\nminimizing human error. Our implementation, AI4Pricing2Yaml, features a basic\nInformation Extractor that uses web scraping and LLMs technologies to extract\nessential pricing components, plans, features, usage limits, and add-ons, from\nSaaS websites. Validation against a dataset of 30 distinct commercial SaaS,\nencompassing over 150 intelligent pricings, demonstrates the system's\neffectiveness in extracting the desired elements across all steps. However,\nchallenges remain in addressing hallucinations, complex structures, and dynamic\ncontent. This work highlights the potential of automating intelligent pricing\ntransformation to streamline SaaS pricing management, offering implications for\nimproved consistency and scalability in an increasingly intricate pricing\nlandscape. Future research will focus on refining extraction capabilities and\nenhancing the system's adaptability to a wider range of SaaS websites.",

However, current routing systems (e.g., online maps) fail\nto incorporate shade information due to the difficulty of estimating shades\ndirectly from noisy satellite imagery and the limited availability of training\ndata for generative models. In this paper, we address these challenges through\ntwo main contributions. First, we build an extensive dataset covering diverse\nlongitude-latitude regions, varying levels of building density, and different\nurban layouts. Leveraging Blender-based 3D simulations alongside building\noutlines, we capture building shadows under various solar zenith angles\nthroughout the year and at different times of day. These simulated shadows are\naligned with satellite images, providing a rich resource for learning shade\npatterns. Second, we propose the DeepShade, a diffusion-based model designed to\nlearn and synthesize shade variations over time. It emphasizes the nuance of\nedge features by jointly considering RGB with the Canny edge layer, and\nincorporates contrastive learning to capture the temporal change rules of\nshade. Then, by conditioning on textual descriptions of known conditions (e.g.,\ntime of day, solar angles), our framework provides improved performance in\ngenerating shade images. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by using\nour shade predictions to calculate shade ratios for real-world route planning\nin Tempe, Arizona.

Our framework strictly generalizes\nseveral existing notions: it subsumes U-Calibration [KLST-23] and Calibration\nDecision Loss [HW-24], which compare a miscalibrated predictor to its\ncalibrated counterpart, and it recovers Blackwell informativeness [Bla-51,\nBla-53] as a special case when both predictors are perfectly calibrated.

Traditional sign-based methods, under the\nseparable smoothness assumption, guarantee a convergence rate of\n$\\mathcal{O}(T^{-1/4})$, but they either require large batch sizes or assume\nunimodal symmetric stochastic noise. To address these limitations, we\ndemonstrate that signSGD with momentum can achieve the same convergence rate\nusing constant batch sizes without additional assumptions. Our analysis, under\nthe standard $l_2$-smoothness condition, improves upon the result of the prior\nmomentum-based signSGD method by a factor of $\\mathcal{O}(d^{1/2})$, where $d$\nis the problem dimension. Furthermore, we explore sign-based methods with\nmajority vote in distributed settings and show that the proposed momentum-based\nmethod yields convergence rates of $\\mathcal{O}\\left( d^{1/2}T^{-1/2} +\ndn^{-1/2} \\right)$ and $\\mathcal{O}\\left( \\max \\{ d^{1/4}T^{-1/4},\nd^{1/10}T^{-1/5} \\} \\right)$, which outperform the previous results of\n$\\mathcal{O}\\left( dT^{-1/4} + dn^{-1/2} \\right)$ and $\\mathcal{O}\\left(\nd^{3/8}T^{-1/8} \\right)$, respectively.

Furthermore, their real space\nmagnetic texture is often complex and temperature-dependent. We investigate the\nmagnetic Kagome metal DyMn$_6$Sn$_6$ using high-resolution micro-focused\ncircular-dichroic angle-resolved photoemission ($\\mu$-CD-ARPES) to probe its\nmagnetic and electronic properties.

In this work, we propose a\nLarge Language Models (LLMs)-based Multi-feedback Smart Contract Fuzzing\nframework (LLAMA) that integrates LLMs, evolutionary mutation strategies, and\nhybrid testing techniques. Key components of the proposed LLAMA include: (i) a\nhierarchical prompting strategy that guides LLMs to generate semantically valid\ninitial seeds, coupled with a lightweight pre-fuzzing phase to select\nhigh-potential inputs; (ii) a multi-feedback optimization mechanism that\nsimultaneously improves seed generation, seed selection, and mutation\nscheduling by leveraging runtime coverage and dependency feedback; and (iii) an\nevolutionary fuzzing engine that dynamically adjusts mutation operator\nprobabilities based on effectiveness, while incorporating symbolic execution to\nescape stagnation and uncover deeper vulnerabilities. Our experiments\ndemonstrate that LLAMA outperforms state-of-the-art fuzzers in both coverage\nand vulnerability detection. Specifically, it achieves 91% instruction coverage\nand 90% branch coverage, while detecting 132 out of 148 known vulnerabilities\nacross diverse categories.

We compared the MEGA method to the traditional step-by-step (CoT)\nmethod to ascertain which is better by using a within-group design after\nrandomly assigning questions for the participants, who are university students.\nSamples (n=60) were randomly drawn from each of the two test sets of the Grade\nSchool Math 8K (GSM8K) and Mathematics Aptitude Test of Heuristics (MATH)\ndatasets, based on the error margin of 11%, the confidence level of 90%, and a\nmanageable number of samples for the student evaluators. These samples were\nused to evaluate two capable LLMs at length (Generative Pretrained Transformer\n4o (GPT4o) and Claude 3.5 Sonnet) out of the initial six that were tested for\ncapability. The results showed that students agree in more instances that the\nMEGA method is experienced as better for learning for both datasets. It is even\nmuch better than the CoT (47.5% compared to 26.67%) in the more difficult MATH\ndataset, indicating that MEGA is better at explaining difficult Maths problems.",

    "abstract": "A simple parametrized family of quantum systems consisting of two entangled\nsubsystems, dubbed left and right ones, both of them featuring N qubits is\nconsidered in the thermofield double formalism. We assume that the system\nevolves in a purely geometric manner based on the parallel transport condition\ndue to Uhlmann. We explore the different interpretations of this evolution\nrelative to observers either coupled to the left or to the right subsystems.\nThe Uhlmann condition breaks the symmetry between left and right by regarding\none of the two possible sets of local unitary operations as gauge degrees of\nfreedom. Then gauging the right side we show that the geometric evolution on\nthe left manifests itself via certain local operations reminiscent of\nnon-unitary filtering measurements. On the other hand on the right the basic\nevolutionary steps are organized into a sequence of unitary operations of a\nholonomic quantum computation. We calculate the Uhlmann connection governing\nthe transport for our model which turns out to be related to higher dimensional\ninstantons. Then we evaluate the anholonomy of the connection for geodesic\ntriangles with geodesic segments defined with respect to the Bures metric. By\nanalysing the explicit form of the local filtering measurements showing up on\nthe left side we realize that they are also optimal measurements for\ndistinguishing two given mixed states in the statistical sense. We also point\nout that by conducting an interference experiment on the right side one can\nobserve the physical effects of the anholonomic quantum computation. We\ndemonstrate this by calculating explicit examples for phase shifts and\nvisibility patterns arising in such interference experiments. Finally a\nsequence of geodesic triangles producing the iSWAP gate via anholonomy needed\nfor computational universality is presented.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel methodology for determining representational\nstructure, which builds upon the existing Spotlight Resonance method. This new\ntool is used to gain insight into how discrete representations can emerge and\norganise in autoencoder models, through a controlled ablation study in which\nonly the activation function is altered. Using this technique, the validity of\nwhether function-driven symmetries can act as implicit inductive biases on\nrepresentations is determined. Representations are found to tend to discretise\nwhen the activation functions are defined through a discrete algebraic\npermutation-equivariant symmetry. In contrast, they remain continuous under a\ncontinuous algebraic orthogonal-equivariant definition. This confirms the\nhypothesis that the symmetries of network primitives can carry unintended\ninductive biases, which produce task-independent artefactual structures in\nrepresentations. The discrete symmetry of contemporary forms is shown to be a\nstrong predictor for the production of discrete representations emerging from\notherwise continuous distributions -- a quantisation effect. This motivates\nfurther reassessment of functional forms in common usage due to such unintended\nconsequences. Moreover, this supports a general causal model for one mode in\nwhich discrete representations may form, and could constitute a prerequisite\nfor downstream interpretability phenomena, including grandmother neurons,\ndiscrete coding schemes, general linear features and possibly Superposition.\nHence, this tool and proposed mechanism for the influence of functional form on\nrepresentations may provide insights into interpretability research. Finally,\npreliminary results indicate that quantisation of representations appears to\ncorrelate with a measurable increase in reconstruction error, reinforcing\nprevious conjectures that this collapse can be detrimental.",

The DTS measured space-time\ncorrelation curves of temperature fluctuations are used to compute the bulk\nconvective speeds of temperature structures in buoyant conditions at a height\nof 3.1 m above the clearing.

However, unreliable travel times on\nsidewalks due to pedestrian density, obstacles, and varying infrastructure\nconditions can significantly affect their efficiency. This study addresses the\nrobust route planning problem for sidewalk robots, explicitly accounting for\ntravel time uncertainty due to varying sidewalk conditions. Optimization is\nintegrated with simulation to reproduce the effect of obstacles and pedestrian\nflows and generate realistic travel times. The study investigates three\ndifferent approaches to derive uncertainty sets, including budgeted,\nellipsoidal, and support vector clustering (SVC)-based methods, along with a\ndistributionally robust method to solve the shortest path (SP) problem. A\nrealistic case study reproducing pedestrian patterns in Stockholm's city center\nis used to evaluate the efficiency of robust routing across various robot\ndesigns and environmental conditions. The results show that, when compared to a\nconventional SP, robust routing significantly enhances operational reliability\nunder variable sidewalk conditions. The Ellipsoidal and DRSP approaches\noutperform the other methods, yielding the most efficient paths in terms of\naverage and worst-case delay. Sensitivity analyses reveal that robust\napproaches consistently outperform the conventional SP, particularly for\nsidewalk delivery robots that are wider, slower, and have more conservative\nnavigation behaviors.

The optomagnonic\ncoupling is essential for constructing a hybrid magnonic quantum network, as\nthe transmission of quantum information among remote quantum nodes must be\naccomplished using light rather than microwave field. Here we provide an\noptomagnonic continuous-variable quantum teleportation protocol, which enables\nthe transfer of an input optical state to a remote magnon mode. To overcome the\ncurrently relatively weak coupling in the experiment, we introduce non-Gaussian\ndistillation operations to enhance the optomagnonic entanglement and thus the\nfidelity of the teleportation. An auxiliary microwave cavity is adopted to\nrealize the non-Gaussian and displacement operations on magnons. We show that a\nseries of optical states, such as coherent, single-photon, squeezed and cat\nstates, can be teleported to the magnon mode. The work provides guidance for\nthe experimental realization of magnonic quantum repeaters and quantum networks\nand a new route to prepare diverse magnonic quantum states exploiting the\nphoton-to-magnon quantum teleportation.",

We\npresent first spectral synthesis based on 3D time-dependent unified RHD model\natmospheres with winds for O stars. We first carried out time-dependent, 3D\nsimulations of unified atmospheres with winds. We then used 3D radiative\ntransfer to compute surface brightness maps for the optical continuum as well\nas integrated flux profiles for select diagnostic lines. To derive occupation\nnumbers and source functions, an aNLTE method was used, as well as scattering\nsource functions. Our continuum intensity maps of a prototypical early O star\nreveal a highly variable and time-dependent surface, characterised by local\nemergent radiation temperature variations. Our averaged synthetic line profiles\nof optical absorption lines have large widths, without applying any macro- or\nmicroturbulence. From the simulations we find correspondingly large velocity\ndispersions in the photospheric layers. Additionally, the absorption line EWs\nare larger than for comparable 1D models. First results using scattering source\nfunctions further demonstrate that characteristic features like the softening\nof the blue edge of strong ultra-violet wind lines are qualitatively\nwell-reproduced by our models. Our 3D simulations clearly predict a highly\nstructured and strongly variable O star surface. First line profile results\nfurther suggest that several observed features are naturally reproduced by our\nmodels without the need to introduce ad-hoc spectral fitting parameters.

    "abstract": "As face recognition systems (FRS) become more widely used, user privacy\nbecomes more important. A key privacy issue in FRS is protecting the user's\nface template, as the characteristics of the user's face image can be recovered\nfrom the template. Although recent advances in cryptographic tools such as\nhomomorphic encryption (HE) have provided opportunities for securing the FRS,\nHE cannot be used directly with FRS in an efficient plug-and-play manner. In\nparticular, although HE is functionally complete for arbitrary programs, it is\nbasically designed for algebraic operations on encrypted data of predetermined\nshape, such as a polynomial ring. Thus, a non-tailored combination of HE and\nthe system can yield very inefficient performance, and many previous HE-based\nface template protection methods are hundreds of times slower than plain\nsystems without protection. In this study, we propose IDFace, a new HE-based\nsecure and efficient face identification method with template protection.\nIDFace is designed on the basis of two novel techniques for efficient searching\non a (homomorphically encrypted) biometric database with an angular metric. The\nfirst technique is a template representation transformation that sharply\nreduces the unit cost for the matching test. The second is a space-efficient\nencoding that reduces wasted space from the encryption algorithm, thus saving\nthe number of operations on encrypted templates. Through experiments, we show\nthat IDFace can identify a face template from among a database of 1M encrypted\ntemplates in 126ms, showing only 2X overhead compared to the identification\nover plaintexts.",

This change\nshifts the focus from more specialized 360{\\deg} audio and audiovisual scene\nanalysis to more commonplace audio and media scenarios with limited\nfield-of-view (FOV). Due to inherent angular ambiguities in stereo audio data,\nthe task focuses on direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation in the azimuth plane\n(left-right axis) along with distance estimation. The challenge remains divided\ninto two tracks: audio-only and audiovisual, with the audiovisual track\nintroducing a new sub-task of onscreen/offscreen event classification\nnecessitated by the limited FOV. This challenge introduces the DCASE2025 Task3\nStereo SELD Dataset, whose stereo audio and perspective video clips are sampled\nand converted from the STARSS23 recordings. The baseline system is designed to\nprocess stereo audio and corresponding video frames as inputs. In addition to\nthe typical SELD event classification and localization, it integrates\nonscreen/offscreen classification for the audiovisual track.

While it is easy to accurately estimate a population's\ndistribution of feedback given feedback from a large number of individuals,\ncost constraints typically necessitate using smaller groups. A simple method to\napproximate the population distribution is regularized averaging: compute the\nempirical distribution and regularize it toward a prior. Can we do better? As\nwe will discuss, the answer to this question depends on feedback granularity.\n  Suppose one wants to predict a population's distribution of feedback using\nfeedback from a limited number of individuals. We show that, as feedback\ngranularity increases, one can substantially improve upon predictions of\nregularized averaging by combining individuals' feedback in ways more\nsophisticated than regularized averaging.\n  Our empirical analysis using questions on social attitudes confirms this\npattern. In particular, with binary feedback, sophistication barely reduces the\nnumber of individuals required to attain a fixed level of performance. By\ncontrast, with five-point feedback, sophisticated methods match the performance\nof regularized averaging with about half as many individuals.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces UrbanScore - a real-time web platform that computes a\npersonalised liveability score for any urban address. The system fuses five\ndata streams: (i) address geocoding via Nominatim, (ii) facility extraction\nfrom OpenStreetMap through Overpass QL, (iii) segment-level traffic metrics\nfrom TomTom Flow v10, (iv) hourly air-quality readings from OpenWeatherMap, and\n(v) user-declared preference profiles, all persisted in an Oracle 19c\nrelational store. Six sub-scores (air, traffic, lifestyle, education, metro\naccess, surface transport) are derived, adaptively weighted and combined; an\nOpenAI large-language model then converts the numeric results into concise,\nuser-friendly explanations. A pilot deployment covering the 226 km2\nmetropolitan area of Bucharest evaluated 3,450 unique addresses over four\nweeks. Median end-to-end latency was 2.1 s (p95 = 2.9s), meeting the <3\nnon-functional requirement. Aggregate scores ranged from 34 to 92 (mean 68, SD\n11), with high-scoring clusters along metro corridors that pair abundant green\nspace with PM2.5 levels below 35 ug m-3. A detailed case study of the\nTineretului district produced an overall score of 91/100 and demonstrated how\nthe narrative layer guides users toward comparable neighbourhoods. Limitations\ninclude dependence on third-party API uptime, spatial bias toward well-mapped\nOSM regions and the absence of noise and crime layers, cited by 18% of survey\nparticipants as a desired enhancement. Overall, the results show that open\ngeodata, commercial mobility feeds and conversational AI can be integrated into\na performant, explainable decision-support tool that places \"liveability\nanalytics\" in the hands of every house-hunter, commuter and city planner.",

    "abstract": "Achieving sustainable, explainable, and maintainable automation for resource\noptimization is a core challenge across the edge-cloud continuum. Persistent\noverprovisioning and operational complexity often stem from heterogeneous\nplatforms and layered abstractions, while systems lacking explainability and\nmaintainability become fragile, impede safe recovery, and accumulate technical\ndebt. Existing solutions are frequently reactive, limited to single abstraction\nlayers, or require intrusive platform changes, leaving efficiency and\nmaintainability gains unrealized.\n  This paper addresses safe, transparent, and low-effort resource optimization\nin dynamic, multi-tenant edge-cloud systems, without disrupting operator\nworkflows or increasing technical debt. We introduce ARRC, a recommender system\nrooted in software engineering design principles, which delivers explainable,\ncross-layer resource recommendations directly into operator workflows (such as\ntickets and GitOps pull requests). ARRC encapsulates optimization logic in\nspecialized, auditable agents coordinated via a shared interface, supporting\nmaintainability and extensibility through transparency and the ability to\ninspect both recommendations and their rationale.\n  Empirical evaluation in a multi-region industrial deployment shows that ARRC\nreduces operator workload by over 50%, improves compute utilization by up to\n7.7x, and maintains error rates below 5%, with most benefits achieved through\nincremental, operator-approved changes. This demonstrates that explainable,\nrecommendation-based architectures can achieve sustainable efficiency and\nmaintainability improvements at production scale.\n  ARRC provides an empirically evaluated framework for integrating explainable,\nworkflow-driven automation into resource management, intended to advance best\npractices for robust, maintainable, and transparent edge-cloud continuum\nplatforms.",

An often-ignored aspect\nin URLLC is consecutive packet outages, which can destabilize control loops and\ncompromise safety in in-factory environments. Hence, the current work proposes\na link adaptation framework to support extreme reliability requirements using\nthe soft actor-critic (SAC)-based deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm\nthat jointly optimizes energy efficiency (EE) and reliability under dynamic\nchannel and interference conditions. Unlike prior work focusing on average\nreliability, our method explicitly targets reducing burst/consecutive outages\nthrough adaptive control of transmit power and blocklength based solely on the\nobserved signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). The joint optimization\nproblem is formulated under finite blocklength and quality of service\nconstraints, balancing reliability and EE. Simulation results show that the\nproposed method significantly outperforms the baseline algorithms, reducing\noutage bursts while consuming only 18\\% of the transmission cost required by a\nfull/maximum resource allocation policy in the evaluated scenario. The\nframework also supports flexible trade-off tuning between EE and reliability by\nadjusting reward weights, making it adaptable to diverse industrial\nrequirements.",

The quantum network node initiating the objective consequently derives a\ndistributed workflow, referred to as saga, comprising numerous tasks operating\non resources, which completes the objective. We identify three different kinds\nof resources with their own and independent topology, namely classical\nmessaging, quantum channels and entanglement. Sagas can either be centrally\norchestrated or performed in choreography by the network nodes. The tasks of a\nsaga originate from and operate on resources of the network, such as quantum\nchannels or entanglement, and they not only comprise operations and\nmeasurements, but potentially also include other tasks or even entire\nprotocols, such as sending a qubit, distributing entanglement or performing\nentanglement purification steps.",

While recent advances have made significant progress in this area,\nexisting NCD methods face two major limitations. First, they primarily focus on\nsingle-view data (e.g., images), overlooking the increasingly common multi-view\ndata, such as multi-omics datasets used in disease diagnosis. Second, their\nreliance on pseudo-labels to supervise novel class clustering often results in\nunstable performance, as pseudo-label quality is highly sensitive to factors\nsuch as data noise and feature dimensionality. To address these challenges, we\npropose a novel framework named Intra-view and Inter-view Correlation Guided\nMulti-view Novel Class Discovery (IICMVNCD), which is the first attempt to\nexplore NCD in multi-view setting so far. Specifically, at the intra-view\nlevel, leveraging the distributional similarity between known and novel\nclasses, we employ matrix factorization to decompose features into\nview-specific shared base matrices and factor matrices. The base matrices\ncapture distributional consistency among the two datasets, while the factor\nmatrices model pairwise relationships between samples. At the inter-view level,\nwe utilize view relationships among known classes to guide the clustering of\nnovel classes. This includes generating predicted labels through the weighted\nfusion of factor matrices and dynamically adjusting view weights of known\nclasses based on the supervision loss, which are then transferred to novel\nclass learning. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our proposed\napproach.",

    "abstract": "It is widely recognized that quantum computing has profound impacts on\nmultiple fields, including but not limited to cryptography, machine learning,\nmaterials science, etc. To run quantum algorithms, it is essential to develop\nscalable quantum hardware with low noise levels and to design efficient\nfault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) schemes. Currently, various FTQC\nschemes have been developed for different hardware platforms. However, a\ncomprehensive framework for the analysis and evaluation of these schemes is\nstill lacking. In this work, we propose Quantum Logical Operations Per Second\n(QLOPS) as a metric for assessing the performance of FTQC schemes on quantum\nhardware platforms. This benchmarking framework will integrate essential\nrelevant factors, e.g., the code rates of quantum error-correcting codes, the\naccuracy, throughput, and latency of the decoder, and reflect the practical\nrequirements of quantum algorithm execution. This framework will enable the\nidentification of bottlenecks in quantum hardware, providing potential\ndirections for their development. Moreover, our results will help establish a\ncomparative framework for evaluating FTQC designs. As this benchmarking\napproach considers practical applications, it may assist in estimating the\nhardware resources needed to implement quantum algorithms and offers\npreliminary insights into potential timelines.",

We validated the efficacy of DOV4MM through ten\nmasked image models on ImageNet-1K and four masked language models on\nWikiText-103.

This study develops an advanced expectile-based framework that\naddresses the shortcomings of conventional quantile-based approaches by\nproviding greater sensitivity to tail losses and improved stability in extreme\nmarket conditions.

The empirical results\ndemonstrate that expectile-based Value-at-Risk (EVaR) consistently outperforms\ntraditional VaR measures across various confidence levels and market\nconditions.

Existing methods regard the RGB\ndomain as a unified domain and neglect the multiple subdomains within it, such\nas daytime, nighttime, and foggy scenes. We argue that decoupling the\ndomain-invariant (DI) and domain-specific (DS) features across these multiple\nsubdomains is beneficial for RGB-IR domain adaptation. To this end, this paper\nproposes a new SS-DC framework based on a decoupling-coupling strategy. In\nterms of decoupling, we design a Spectral Adaptive Idempotent Decoupling (SAID)\nmodule in the aspect of spectral decomposition. Due to the style and content\ninformation being highly embedded in different frequency bands, this module can\ndecouple DI and DS components more accurately and interpretably. A novel filter\nbank-based spectral processing paradigm and a self-distillation-driven\ndecoupling loss are proposed to improve the spectral domain decoupling. In\nterms of coupling, a new spatial-spectral coupling method is proposed, which\nrealizes joint coupling through spatial and spectral DI feature pyramids.\nMeanwhile, this paper introduces DS from decoupling to reduce the domain bias.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our method can significantly improve the\nbaseline performance and outperform existing UDAOD methods on multiple RGB-IR\ndatasets, including a new experimental protocol proposed in this paper based on\nthe FLIR-ADAS dataset.",

This paper presents a real-world channel sounding data set acquired\nusing a testbed with synchronized, distributed ground-based sensor nodes and\nflying sensor nodes within a swarm of up to four drones. The conducted\nmeasurement campaign is designed to sense the bi-static reflectivity of objects\nsuch as parking cars, vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft, and small\ndrones in multi-path environments. We detail the rationale behind the selection\nof the included scenarios and the configuration of the participating nodesand\npresent exemplary results to demonstrate the potential of using collaborating\ndrone swarms for multi-static radar tracking and localization in air-to-air\n(A2A) and air-to-ground (A2G) scenarios.

Leveraging temporally correlated input\nfrom consecutive film frames, we employ temporal convolutional layers in our\narchitecture, which effectively allows to bridge the temporal resolution gap\nbetween natural movie stimuli and fMRI acquisitions. Our model predicts\nactivity of voxels in and around the visual cortex and performs reconstruction\nof corresponding visual inputs from neural activity. Finally, we investigate\nbrain regions contributing to visual decoding through saliency maps. We find\nthat the most contributing regions are the middle occipital area, the fusiform\narea, and the calcarine, respectively employed in shape perception, complex\nrecognition (in particular face perception), and basic visual features such as\nedges and contrasts. These functions being strongly solicited are in line with\nthe decoder's capability to reconstruct edges, faces, and contrasts.

However, the attention\nmechanism in ViTs makes each layer function as a low-pass filter, and the\nstacked-layer architecture in existing transformers suffers from frequency\nvanishing. This leads to the loss of critical details and textures. We propose\na novel, circuit-theory-inspired strategy called Frequency-Dynamic Attention\nModulation (FDAM), which can be easily plugged into ViTs. FDAM directly\nmodulates the overall frequency response of ViTs and consists of two\ntechniques: Attention Inversion (AttInv) and Frequency Dynamic Scaling\n(FreqScale). Since circuit theory uses low-pass filters as fundamental\nelements, we introduce AttInv, a method that generates complementary high-pass\nfiltering by inverting the low-pass filter in the attention matrix, and\ndynamically combining the two. We further design FreqScale to weight different\nfrequency components for fine-grained adjustments to the target response\nfunction. Through feature similarity analysis and effective rank evaluation, we\ndemonstrate that our approach avoids representation collapse, leading to\nconsistent performance improvements across various models, including SegFormer,\nDeiT, and MaskDINO. These improvements are evident in tasks such as semantic\nsegmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation.

Note that if $H$ is the complete\ngraph on $q$ vertices, the problem is equivalent to List $q$-Coloring. We\ninvestigate the kernelization properties of List $H$-Coloring parameterized by\nthe vertex cover number of $G$: given an instance $(G,L)$ and a vertex cover of\n$G$ of size $k$, can we reduce $(G,L)$ to an equivalent instance $(G',L')$ of\nList $H$-Coloring where the size of $G'$ is bounded by a low-degree polynomial\n$p(k)$ in $k$? This question has been investigated previously by Jansen and\nPieterse [Algorithmica 2019], who provided an upper bound, which turns out to\nbe optimal if $H$ is a complete graph, i.e., for List $q$-Coloring. This result\nwas one of the first applications of the method of kernelization via\nbounded-degree polynomials.

It\nproposes innovative approaches based on representation smoothness, including\nregularization strategies that utilize Jacobian and Hessian matrices to\nstabilize training and mitigate sensitivity to input perturbations. The second\npart focuses on methods to significantly enhance data and parameter efficiency\nby integrating active learning strategies with parameter-efficient fine-tuning,\nguided by insights from representation smoothness analysis. It presents\nsmoothness-informed early-stopping techniques designed to eliminate the need\nfor labeled validation sets and proposes innovative combinations of active\nlearning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning to reduce labeling efforts and\ncomputational resources. Extensive experimental evaluations across various NLP\ntasks demonstrate that these combined approaches substantially outperform\ntraditional methods in terms of performance, stability, and efficiency. The\nthird part explores weak supervision techniques enhanced by in-context learning\nto effectively utilize unlabeled data, further reducing dependence on extensive\nlabeling. It shows that using in-context learning as a mechanism for weak\nsupervision enables models to better generalize from limited labeled data by\nleveraging unlabeled examples more effectively during training.

For a plane wave incident onto a flat dielectric slab,\nreflection becomes strongly dependent on the incident angle as the electrical\nthickness becomes large. This behavior limits the applicability of conventional\nsingle- and multilayer anti-reflective coatings. Recently, inspired by the\ngeneralized Huygens' condition, synthesized admittance sheets implemented as\nmetasurfaces with local response have been shown to remove reflection from a\ndielectric slab in a wide range of incident angles, applicable, however, only\nin the case of small optical slab thickness. In this work, we study plane wave\ntransmission through dielectric slabs with arbitrary thickness coated from both\nsides by identical metasurfaces with nonlocal response, whose grid impedance is\nangularly dependent (spatially dispersive). Nonlocality is shown to play a key\nrole in obtaining wide-angle reflection suppression in the case of optically\nthick slabs. To validate our approach, we study a metasurface realization\ncomposed of Interconnected Split-Ring Resonators that approximates the\npredicted spatial dispersion law. As demonstrated numerically and\nexperimentally, such properly devised nonlocal metasurface coatings indeed\nprovide transmittance enhancement (and reflectance suppression) of thick\ndielectric slabs across a broad range of angles, paving the path to optically\nthin and easy-to-fabricate anti-reflective coatings efficiently operating in a\nwide angular range even for optically thick dielectric slabs.",

Rounding of complex log spaces was introduced\nin a 1999 paper by Kato and Nakayama and is a functorial generalization of\nA'Campo's 1975 notion of a real oriented blowup. It allows to cut canonically\nany complex toroidal variety $X$ along its toroidal boundary $\\partial X$,\nproducing a topological manifold-with-boundary, whose boundary is a canonical\nrepresentative of the boundary of any tubular neighborhood of $\\partial X$ in\n$X$. In singularity theory, roundings may be used to get canonical\nrepresentatives of links of isolated complex analytic singularities and of\nMilnor fibers of smoothings of complex singularities, once toroidal resolutions\nof the singularity or of the smoothing are chosen. The text starts with\nintroductions to not necessarily normal toric varieties, it passes then to\ntoroidal varieties and to their real oriented blowups. It continues with\nintroductions to log spaces and to rounding of complex log spaces. It concludes\nwith an important theorem of Nakayama and Ogus about the local triviality of\nthe rounding of special types of log morphisms. The notions of affine toric\nvariety, real oriented blowup, log structure and rounding are introduced by\nmeans of the classical passage to polar coordinates.",

As model size and latency increase limit user experience, hybrid\nedge-cloud collaborative framework was recently proposed to realize fast\ninference and high-quality generation, where the cloud model initiates\nhigh-quality semantic planning and the edge model expedites later-stage\nrefinement. However, excessive cloud denoising prolongs inference time, while\ninsufficient steps cause semantic ambiguity, leading to inconsistency in edge\nmodel output. To address these challenges, we propose EC-Diff that accelerates\ncloud inference through gradient-based noise estimation while identifying the\noptimal point for cloud-edge handoff to maintain generation quality.\nSpecifically, we design a K-step noise approximation strategy to reduce cloud\ninference frequency by using noise gradients between steps and applying cloud\ninference periodically to adjust errors. Then we design a two-stage greedy\nsearch algorithm to efficiently find the optimal parameters for noise\napproximation and edge model switching. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nour method significantly enhances generation quality compared to edge\ninference, while achieving up to an average $2\\times$ speedup in inference\ncompared to cloud inference.

Neural network pruning methods have\nsuccessfully addressed this challenge in supervised learning. However, their\napplication to RL is underexplored. We propose an approach to integrate\nsimultaneous training and pruning within advanced RL methods, in particular to\nRL algorithms enhanced by the Online Feature Extractor Network (OFENet). Our\nnetworks (XiNet) are trained to solve stochastic optimization problems over the\nRL networks' weights and the parameters of variational Bernoulli distributions\nfor 0/1 Random Variables $\\xi$ scaling each unit in the networks. The\nstochastic problem formulation induces regularization terms that promote\nconvergence of the variational parameters to 0 when a unit contributes little\nto the performance. In this case, the corresponding structure is rendered\npermanently inactive and pruned from its network. We propose a cost-aware,\nsparsity-promoting regularization scheme, tailored to the DenseNet architecture\nof OFENets expressing the parameter complexity of involved networks in terms of\nthe parameters of the RVs in these networks. Then, when matching this cost with\nthe regularization terms, the many hyperparameters associated with them are\nautomatically selected, effectively combining the RL objectives and network\ncompression. We evaluate our method on continuous control benchmarks (MuJoCo)\nand the Soft Actor-Critic RL agent, demonstrating that OFENets can be pruned\nconsiderably with minimal loss in performance.

How do low-dimensional\ncontrollers maintain homeostasis in high-dimensional systems? We develop an\nanalytically tractable model of integral feedback for complex systems in\nfluctuating environments.

Albeit previous works on PoT quantization can be efficiently\ndequantized on CPUs using fixed-point addition, it showed less effectiveness on\nGPUs. The reason is entanglement of the sign bit and sequential bit\nmanipulations needed for dequantization. We propose a novel POT quantization\nframework for LLM weights that (i) outperforms state-of-the-art accuracy in\nextremely low-precision number formats, and (ii) enables faster inference\nthrough more efficient dequantization. To maintain the accuracy of the\nquantized model, we introduce a two-step post-training algorithm: (i)\ninitialize the quantization scales with a robust starting point, and (ii)\nrefine these scales using a minimal calibration set. The performance of our PoT\npost-training algorithm surpasses the current state-of-the-art in integer\nquantization, particularly at low precisions such as 2- and 3-bit formats. Our\nPoT quantization accelerates the dequantization step required for the floating\npoint inference and leads to $3.67\\times$ speed up on a NVIDIA V100, and\n$1.63\\times$ on a NVIDIA RTX 4090, compared to uniform integer dequantization.",

    "abstract": "Microbiomes, which are collections of interacting microbes in an environment,\noften substantially impact the environmental patches or living hosts that they\noccupy. In microbiome models, it is important to consider both the local\ndynamics within an environment and exchanges of microbiomes between\nenvironments. One way to incorporate these and other interactions across\nmultiple scales is to employ metacommunity theory. Metacommunity models\ncommonly assume continuous microbiome dispersal between the environments in\nwhich local microbiome dynamics occur. Under this assumption, a single\nparameter between each pair of environments controls the dispersal rate between\nthose environments. This metacommunity framework is well-suited to abiotic\nenvironmental patches, but it fails to capture an essential aspect of the\nmicrobiomes of living hosts, which generally do not interact continuously with\neach other. Instead, living hosts interact with each other in discrete time\nintervals. In this paper, we develop a modeling framework that encodes such\ndiscrete interactions and uses two parameters to separately control the\ninteraction frequencies between hosts and the amount of microbiome exchange\nduring each interaction. We derive analytical approximations of models in our\nframework in three parameter regimes and prove that they are accurate in those\nregimes. We compare these approximations to numerical simulations for an\nillustrative model. We demonstrate that both parameters in our modeling\nframework are necessary to determine microbiome dynamics. Key features of the\ndynamics, such as microbiome convergence across hosts, depend sensitively on\nthe interplay between interaction frequency and strength.",

Class-wise prototypes, representing class centroids, serve as\ndomain-invariant cues that benefit generalization due to their stability and\nsemantic consistency. However, this approach faces three challenges. First,\nexisting methods often adopt coarse prototypical alignment strategies, which\nmay hinder performance. Second, naive prototypes computed by averaging source\nbatch features are prone to overfitting and may be negatively affected by\nunrelated source data. Third, most methods treat all source samples equally,\nignoring the fact that different features have varying adaptation difficulties.\nTo address these limitations, we propose a novel framework for generalizable\nsemantic segmentation: Prototypical Progressive Alignment and Reweighting\n(PPAR), leveraging the strong generalization ability of the CLIP model.\nSpecifically, we define two prototypes: the Original Text Prototype (OTP) and\nVisual Text Prototype (VTP), generated via CLIP to serve as a solid base for\nalignment.

    "abstract": "The origin, acceleration and anisotropy of suprathermal ions in the\ninterplanetary medium during quiet periods have remained poorly understood\nissues in solar wind physics. To address these aspects, we derive the spectral\nindices for the quiet time suprathermal ions based on the measurements by the\nfour directionally separated sensors that are part of the Supra-Thermal and\nEnergetic Particle Spectrometer (STEPS) of Aditya Solar Wind Particle\nEXperiment (ASPEX) on-board Aditya L1 spacecraft. Three out of four STEPS\nsensors Parker Spiral (PS), Inter-Mediate (IM), Earth Pointing (EP) are in one\nplane (nearly aligned with the ecliptic plane) while the fourth sensor North\nPointing (NP) is in a mutually orthogonal plane. The energy ranges covered by\nthe PS, IM, EP and NP sensors are 0.36-1.32 MeV, 0.14-1.22 MeV, 0.39-1.33 MeV\nand 0.12-1.23 MeV respectively. The quiet intervals are identified during\nJanuary November, 2024 and the derived spectral indices (differential\ndirectional flux versus energy) are found to be in the range of 2.0 for all\ndirections in the time scale of a few days revealing isotropic nature of their\ndistribution. Further analysis of elemental abundance ratios (3He/4He, Fe/O,\nand C/O) during the same quiet intervals obtained from the Ultra-Low Energy\nIsotope Spectrometer (ULEIS) on board the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE)\nspacecraft suggests possible contributions from the leftover ions from the\nprevious impulsive (Solar flares) and gradual events (CMEs) in the quiet time\nsuprathermal ion pool.",

Identifying ncRNAs directly from genomic\nsequence is a paramount challenge in bioinformatics and biology, essential for\nunderstanding the complete regulatory potential of an organism. This paper\npresents RNAMunin, a machine learning (ML) model that is capable of finding\nncRNAs using genomic sequence alone. It is also computationally viable for\nlarge sequence datasets such as long read metagenomic assemblies with contigs\ntotaling multiple Gbp. RNAMunin is trained on Rfam sequences extracted from\napproximately 60 Gbp of long read metagenomes from 16 San Francisco Estuary\nsamples. We know of no other model that can detect ncRNAs based solely on\ngenomic sequence at this scale. Since RNAMunin only requires genomic sequence\nas input, we do not need for an ncRNA to be transcribed to find it, i.e., we do\nnot need transcriptomics data. We wrote this manuscript in a narrative style in\norder to best convey how RNAMunin was developed and how it works in detail.\nUnlike almost all current ML models, at approximately 1M parameters, RNAMunin\nis very small and very fast.",

Despite its\nsignificance, this task remains largely unexplored. Most previous works have\nprimarily focused on mapping modalities like speech, audio, and music to\ngenerate human motion. As of yet, these models typically overlook the impact of\nspatial features encoded in spatial audio signals on human motion. To bridge\nthis gap and enable high-quality modeling of human movements in response to\nspatial audio, we introduce the first comprehensive Spatial Audio-Driven Human\nMotion (SAM) dataset, which contains diverse and high-quality spatial audio and\nmotion data. For benchmarking, we develop a simple yet effective\ndiffusion-based generative framework for human MOtion generation driven by\nSPatial Audio, termed MOSPA, which faithfully captures the relationship between\nbody motion and spatial audio through an effective fusion mechanism. Once\ntrained, MOSPA could generate diverse realistic human motions conditioned on\nvarying spatial audio inputs. We perform a thorough investigation of the\nproposed dataset and conduct extensive experiments for benchmarking, where our\nmethod achieves state-of-the-art performance on this task.

    "abstract": "Grasping unknown objects from a single view has remained a challenging topic\nin robotics due to the uncertainty of partial observation. Recent advances in\nlarge-scale models have led to benchmark solutions such as GraspNet-1Billion.\nHowever, such learning-based approaches still face a critical limitation in\nperformance robustness for their sensitivity to sensing noise and environmental\nchanges. To address this bottleneck in achieving highly generalized grasping,\nwe abandon the traditional learning framework and introduce a new perspective:\nsimilarity matching, where similar known objects are utilized to guide the\ngrasping of unknown target objects. We newly propose a method that robustly\nachieves unknown-object grasping from a single viewpoint through three key\nsteps: 1) Leverage the visual features of the observed object to perform\nsimilarity matching with an existing database containing various object models,\nidentifying potential candidates with high similarity; 2) Use the candidate\nmodels with pre-existing grasping knowledge to plan imitative grasps for the\nunknown target object; 3) Optimize the grasp quality through a local\nfine-tuning process. To address the uncertainty caused by partial and noisy\nobservation, we propose a multi-level similarity matching framework that\nintegrates semantic, geometric, and dimensional features for comprehensive\nevaluation. Especially, we introduce a novel point cloud geometric descriptor,\nthe C-FPFH descriptor, which facilitates accurate similarity assessment between\npartial point clouds of observed objects and complete point clouds of database\nmodels. In addition, we incorporate the use of large language models, introduce\nthe semi-oriented bounding box, and develop a novel point cloud registration\napproach based on plane detection to enhance matching accuracy under\nsingle-view conditions.

    "abstract": "Low-latency localization is critical in cellular networks to support\nreal-time applications requiring precise positioning. In this paper, we propose\na distributed machine learning (ML) framework for fingerprint-based\nlocalization tailored to cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output\n(MIMO) systems, an emerging architecture for 6G networks. The proposed\nframework enables each access point (AP) to independently train a Gaussian\nprocess regression model using local angle-of-arrival and received signal\nstrength fingerprints. These models provide probabilistic position estimates\nfor the user equipment (UE), which are then fused by the UE with minimal\ncomputational overhead to derive a final location estimate. This decentralized\napproach eliminates the need for fronthaul communication between the APs and\nthe central processing unit (CPU), thereby reducing latency. Additionally,\ndistributing computational tasks across the APs alleviates the processing\nburden on the CPU compared to traditional centralized localization schemes.\nSimulation results demonstrate that the proposed distributed framework achieves\nlocalization accuracy comparable to centralized methods, despite lacking the\nbenefits of centralized data aggregation. Moreover, it effectively reduces\nuncertainty of the location estimates, as evidenced by the 95\\% covariance\nellipse. The results highlight the potential of distributed ML for enabling\nlow-latency, high-accuracy localization in future 6G networks.",

Among the potential architectures,\nthe non-terrestrial network (NTN) and open radio access network (ORAN) have\nreceived increasing interest from both academia and industry. Although the\ndeployment of NTNs ensures coverage, enhances spectral efficiency, and improves\nthe resilience of wireless networks. The high altitude and mobility of NTN\npresent new challenges in the development and operations (DevOps) lifecycle,\nhindering intelligent and scalable network management due to the lack of native\nartificial intelligence (AI) capability. With the advantages of ORAN in\ndisaggregation, openness, virtualization, and intelligence, several works\npropose integrating ORAN principles into the NTN, focusing mainly on ORAN\ndeployment options based on transparent and regenerative systems. However, a\nholistic view of how to effectively combine ORAN and NTN throughout the DevOps\nlifecycle is still missing, especially regarding how intelligent ORAN addresses\nthe scalability challenges in NTN. Motivated by this, in this paper, we first\nprovide the background knowledge about ORAN and NTN, outline the\nstate-of-the-art research on ORAN for NTNs, and present the DevOps challenges\nthat motivate the adoption of ORAN solutions. We then propose the ORAN-based\nNTN framework, discussing its features and architectures in detail.

The competition between ASL states and edge\nnon-Hermitian skin states are further identified by their complex and real\neigenenergies, respectively.

Yet mental visualization is a critical cognitive skill\nin humans, supporting abilities such as spatial navigation, predicting physical\ntrajectories, and solving complex visual problems through imaginative\nsimulation. To bridge this gap, we introduce Hyperphantasia, a synthetic\nbenchmark designed to evaluate the mental visualization abilities of MLLMs\nthrough four carefully constructed puzzles. Each task is procedurally generated\nand presented at three difficulty levels, enabling controlled analysis of model\nperformance across increasing complexity.

Furthermore, the\nSchr\\\"odinger bridge (SB) has recently been used in diffusion-based SE to\nimprove speech quality by resolving a mismatch between the endpoint of the\nforward process and the starting point of the reverse process. However, the SB\nstill exhibits slow inference owing to the necessity of a large number of\nfunction evaluations (NFE) for inference to obtain high-quality results. While\nConsistency Models (CMs) address this issue by employing consistency training\nthat uses distillation from pretrained models in the field of image generation,\nit does not improve generation quality when the number of steps increases. As a\nsolution to this problem, Consistency Trajectory Models (CTMs) not only\naccelerate inference speed but also maintain a favorable trade-off between\nquality and speed. Furthermore, SoundCTM demonstrates the applicability of CTM\ntechniques to the field of sound generation. In this paper, we present\nSchr\\\"odinger bridge Consistency Trajectory Models (SBCTM) by applying the\nCTM's technique to the Schr\\\"odinger bridge for SE. Additionally, we introduce\na novel auxiliary loss, including a perceptual loss, into the original CTM's\ntraining framework. As a result, SBCTM achieves an approximately 16x\nimprovement in the real-time factor (RTF) compared to the conventional\nSchr\\\"odinger bridge for SE. Furthermore, the favorable trade-off between\nquality and speed in SBCTM allows for time-efficient inference by limiting\nmulti-step refinement to cases where 1-step inference is insufficient.

We rigorously compare its performance, in terms of mean-squared\nerror (MSE) and cost of power per sensor, against more conventional\nNon-Feedback (NF) architectures by evaluating conditions of feasibility and\nadvantage under different architecture specifications (e.g., communication\ndelay rate, power cost rate, maximum back-off time, sampling period,\nobservation noise). Here, we defined the advantage as the performance gain\nachieved by FB over NF, while FB is said to be feasible if the advantage region\nis nonempty. Our theoretical analyses show that the feasibility of FB depends\nmore on the communication power cost, while the advantage depends on the\nsensors' propagation delay per transmission interval; we derive concrete\nconditions under which these outcomes hold. Using extensive numerical\nsimulations under a variety of settings, we confirm the accuracy of the derived\nconditions, and show that our theoretical results hold even for more complex\nscenarios where the simplifying assumptions no longer hold.",

Existing methods often struggle with a trade-off among\naccuracy, computational cost, and the need for prior information such as the\nnumber of modes. This paper introduces time-frequency mode decomposition\n(TFMD), a novel framework for the fast, robust, and adaptive decomposition of\nsuch signals. TFMD operates on the principle that modes form contiguous\nhigh-energy regions in the time-frequency domain. Its non-iterative pipeline\nreframes signal decomposition as an image segmentation task: a signal is\ntransformed into a spectrogram, which is then smoothed to enhance the\ncontinuity of these high-energy regions. A sequence of adaptive thresholding\nand connected-component labeling with size-based filtering is then employed to\nautomatically segment the spectrogram and generate a mask for each mode. The\nmodes are finally reconstructed via the inverse short-time Fourier transform.\nValidation on diverse synthetic signals demonstrates that TFMD accurately\ndetermines the number of modes and reconstructs them with high fidelity. Its\nperformance is particularly strong in high-noise conditions. A comparative\nanalysis confirms that TFMD provides robust, competitive performance across a\nwider variety of signal types, while a theoretical complexity analysis reveals\nits superior computational efficiency stemming from its non-iterative design.\nThe method's practical utility is further demonstrated by successfully\nextracting modal responses from a real-world footbridge vibration signal.

In particular, we describe a new cost-bounded\ndepth-first search (CB-DFS) method that leverages the combined parallelism of\nmodern CPUs and GPUs. This is used to create algorithms like \\emph{Batch IDA*},\nan extension of the Iterative Deepening A* (IDA*) algorithm, or Batch BTS, an\nextensions of Budgeted Tree Search. Our approach builds on the general approach\nused by Asynchronous Parallel IDA* (AIDA*), while maintaining optimality\nguarantees. We evaluate the approach on the 3x3 Rubik's Cube and 4x4 sliding\ntile puzzle (STP), showing that GPU operations can be efficiently batched in\nDFS. Additionally, we conduct extensive experiments to analyze the effects of\nhyperparameters, neural network heuristic size, and hardware resources on\nperformance.",

However, how various\ntypes of noise, which are ubiquitous in real systems, may affect the QMPE\nremains unknown. Here, we address this gap by constructing a general dynamical\nframework for d level open quantum systems under random telegraph noise. By\ninvestigating the dynamics of an extended system and then projecting back, we\nfind that noise can induce additional modes and strongly influence the\nrelaxation dynamics of the original system. Specially, in the limit of long\ncorrelation time of noise, these modes cause anomalous slowdown for certain\ninitial states, thereby inducing or eliminating QMPE, illustrated by a\nthree-level example system. Interestingly, this mechanism leads to a counter\nintuitive effect:the decoherence rate may be slowed down by noise.",

The hardware consists of a four-microphone rectangular formation and a\ncamera mounted on glasses with a wristband for displaying necessary information\nlike direction. On a custom collected data set, JerryNet achieved a precision\nof 91. 1% for the sound direction, outperforming all the baseline models.

The\ndesign is separated into two problems: beamforming-aware UAV placement\noptimization and transceiver design for minimum SINR maximization. A\nsignificant challenge in beamforming-aware UAV placement optimization is the\nlack of instantaneous channel state information (CSI) prior to deploying UAV\nrelays, making it difficult to derive the beamforming SINR in non-orthogonal\nmulti-user transmission. To address this issue, an approximation of the\nexpected beamforming SINR is derived using the narrow beam property of a\nmassive MIMO base station. Based on this, a UAV placement algorithm is proposed\nto provide UAV positions that improve the minimum expected beamforming SINR\namong users, using a difference-of-convex framework. Subsequently, after\ndeploying the UAV relays to the optimized positions, and with estimated CSI\navailable, a joint relay beamforming and receive combining (JRBC) algorithm is\nproposed to optimize the transceiver to improve the minimum beamforming SINR\namong users, using a block-coordinate descent approach.

This\ntask, filtered vector search, is challenging as prior state-of-the-art\ngraph-based (unfiltered) similarity search techniques quickly degenerate when\nhard constraints are considered. That is, effective graph-based filtered\nsimilarity search relies on sufficient connectivity for reaching the most\nsimilar items within just a few hops. To consider predicates, recent works\npropose modifying graph traversal to visit only the items that may satisfy\npredicates. However, they fail to offer the just-a-few-hops property for a wide\nrange of predicates: they must restrict predicates significantly or lose\nefficiency if only a small fraction of items satisfy predicates.\n  We propose an opposite approach: instead of constraining traversal, we build\nmany indexes each serving different predicate forms. For effective\nconstruction, we devise a three-dimensional analytical model capturing\nrelationships among index size, search time, and recall, with which we follow a\nworkload-aware approach to pack as many useful indexes as possible into a\ncollection. At query time, the analytical model is employed yet again to\ndiscern the one that offers the fastest search at a given recall. We show\nsuperior performance and support on datasets with varying selectivities and\nforms: our approach achieves up to 8.06x speedup while having as low as 1%\nbuild time versus other indexes, with less than 2.15x memory of a standard HNSW\ngraph and modest knowledge of past workloads.",

    "abstract": "Imbalanced problems are prevalent in various real-world scenarios and are\nextensively explored in classification tasks. However, they also present\nchallenges for regression tasks due to the rarity of certain target values. A\ncommon alternative is to employ balancing algorithms in preprocessing to\naddress dataset imbalance. However, due to the variety of resampling methods\nand learning models, determining the optimal solution requires testing many\ncombinations. Furthermore, the learning model, dataset, and evaluation metric\naffect the best strategies. This work proposes the Meta-learning for Imbalanced\nRegression (Meta-IR) framework, which diverges from existing literature by\ntraining meta-classifiers to recommend the best pipeline composed of the\nresampling strategy and learning model per task in a zero-shot fashion. The\nmeta-classifiers are trained using a set of meta-features to learn how to map\nthe meta-features to the classes indicating the best pipeline. We propose two\nformulations: Independent and Chained. Independent trains the meta-classifiers\nto separately indicate the best learning algorithm and resampling strategy.\nChained involves a sequential procedure where the output of one meta-classifier\nis used as input for another to model intrinsic relationship factors. The\nChained scenario showed superior performance, suggesting a relationship between\nthe learning algorithm and the resampling strategy per task. Compared with\nAutoML frameworks, Meta-IR obtained better results. Moreover, compared with\nbaselines of six learning algorithms and six resampling algorithms plus no\nresampling, totaling 42 (6 X 7) configurations, Meta-IR outperformed all of\nthem.

    "abstract": "Video compression is a standard procedure applied to all videos to minimize\nstorage and transmission demands while preserving visual quality as much as\npossible. Therefore, evaluating the visual quality of compressed videos is\ncrucial for guiding the practical usage and further development of video\ncompression algorithms. Although numerous compressed video quality assessment\n(VQA) methods have been proposed, they often lack the generalization capability\nneeded to handle the increasing diversity of video types, particularly high\ndynamic range (HDR) content. In this paper, we introduce CompressedVQA-HDR, an\neffective VQA framework designed to address the challenges of HDR video quality\nassessment. Specifically, we adopt the Swin Transformer and SigLip 2 as the\nbackbone networks for the proposed full-reference (FR) and no-reference (NR)\nVQA models, respectively. For the FR model, we compute deep structural and\ntextural similarities between reference and distorted frames using\nintermediate-layer features extracted from the Swin Transformer as its\nquality-aware feature representation. For the NR model, we extract the global\nmean of the final-layer feature maps from SigLip 2 as its quality-aware\nrepresentation. To mitigate the issue of limited HDR training data, we\npre-train the FR model on a large-scale standard dynamic range (SDR) VQA\ndataset and fine-tune it on the HDRSDR-VQA dataset. For the NR model, we employ\nan iterative mixed-dataset training strategy across multiple compressed VQA\ndatasets, followed by fine-tuning on the HDRSDR-VQA dataset. Experimental\nresults show that our models achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to\nexisting FR and NR VQA models. Moreover, CompressedVQA-HDR-FR won first place\nin the FR track of the Generalizable HDR & SDR Video Quality Measurement Grand\nChallenge at IEEE ICME 2025.

    "abstract": "Load balancing plays a pivotal role in cloud computing, ensuring that\nresources are optimally allocated to maintain high service quality and\noperational efficiency. As workloads in cloud environments become increasingly\ndynamic and unpredictable, load balancing strategies are evolving from\ntraditional static methods to more adaptive and intelligent approaches. In this\nstudy, the Cloud Analyst simulation tool was used to evaluate the performance\nof different load balancing algorithms under various scenarios, including both\ncentralized and distributed resource setups. The results highlight that while\nthe Round Robin algorithm yields slightly better processing times within a\nsingle data center, Equally Spread and Throttled techniques perform\ncompetitively, especially when network latency is considered. More importantly,\nwhen resources are distributed across multiple data centers, response times are\nsignificantly reduced, emphasizing the value of proximity and efficient load\ndistribution. In these distributed environments, Equally Spread and Throttled\nalgorithms not only maintain quick response times but also contribute to lower\noperational costs. These findings demonstrate the necessity of strategic\nresource placement and proactive infrastructure planning to balance performance\nand cost. Adopting intelligent, dynamic load balancing and resource management\npractices can help organizations meet evolving cloud demands, optimize costs,\nand maintain a competitive advantage.

The dataset was enriched with sociodemographic data\nfrom the national census (population density, average residents per household),\nthe proportion of slum areas per neighborhood, a dummy variable for high-income\nneighborhoods (above 7.5 minimum wages), seasonal information (rainy/dry), and\nwater indicators derived from NDWI and MNDWI indexes. We first tested for\nspatial dependence in dengue cases per square kilometer using Moran's I, which\nconfirmed significant spatial autocorrelation, justifying spatial econometric\nmodels. We then applied the SAR (Spatial Autoregressive) model with the listed\nvariables and tested four spatial weight structures (Queen, Rook, KNN, Distance\nBand). The best-performing model was SAR with Rook contiguity, yielding a\npseudo-R-squared of 0.6864 and a spatial pseudo-R-squared of 0.6934. Five\nvariables showed p-values below 0.05. Moran's I applied to the residuals showed\nno significant spatial autocorrelation, suggesting the model effectively\ncaptured spatial structure. The SAC model (also with Rook) was tested but SAR\nremained slightly superior. In addition to generating a thematic risk map, the\nSAR model ranked neighborhoods by predicted vulnerability.

This study uses Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to examine the 2025\nswarm's statistical properties and compare them with historical patterns. The\n2025 swarm's frequency and magnitude distributions closely resemble those of\n2021 swarms, which coincided with volcanic activity at Suwanose Island, 10 km\nfrom the epicentral region, suggesting a magma-seismicity link. Statistical\nanalysis shows a low magnitude scale ({\\sigma} = 0.37) and moderate mean\nmagnitude ({\\mu} = 2.8), consistent with magma-driven seismicity, unlike the\nhigher {\\sigma} (1.2) and {\\mu} (3.6) before the 2011 Tohoku earthquake.

We also propose Multi-Scale Adaptive Upsampling\n(MSAU) to demodulate the modulated feature and recover high-frequency\ninformation through non-uniform upsampling This module further improves\nsegmentation by explicitly exploiting information interaction between densely\nand sparsely resampled areas at multiple scales. Both modules can seamlessly\nintegrate with various architectures, extending from convolutional neural\nnetworks to transformers.

The proposed system is validated\nthrough analytical modeling, controlled experimental evaluations, and\nopen-water trials. Results confirm the feasibility of online mission adaptation\nand semantic task updates, highlighting NemeSys as an online AUV platform for\ngoal-driven adaptive autonomy in dynamic and uncertain underwater environments.",

We observed these retardation effects only in multimode\ncavities, with the exciting possibility of controlling the collapse and revival\npatterns of tripartite entanglement by altering the qubit locations in the\ncavity. Furthermore, the impact of losses on the generated entanglement and the\ndependence of maximum entanglement on the total number of modes yield results\nthat surpass those reported for single and two excitations.

    "abstract": "The classical k-means clustering, based on distances computed from all data\nfeatures, cannot be directly applied to incomplete data with missing values. A\nnatural extension of k-means to missing data, namely k-POD, uses only the\nobserved entries for clustering and is both computationally efficient and\nflexible. However, for high-dimensional missing data including features\nirrelevant to the underlying cluster structure, the presence of such irrelevant\nfeatures leads to the bias of k-POD in estimating cluster centers, thereby\ndamaging its clustering effect. Nevertheless, the existing k-POD method\nperforms well in low-dimensional cases, highlighting the importance of\naddressing the bias issue. To this end, in this paper, we propose a regularized\nk-POD clustering method that applies feature-wise regularization on cluster\ncenters into the existing k-POD clustering. Such a penalty on cluster centers\nenables us to effectively reduce the bias of k-POD for high-dimensional missing\ndata. To the best of our knowledge, our method is the first to mitigate bias in\nk-means-type clustering for high-dimensional missing data, while retaining the\ncomputational efficiency and flexibility. Simulation results verify that the\nproposed method effectively reduces bias and improves clustering performance.\nApplications to real-world single-cell RNA sequencing data further show the\nutility of the proposed method.",

To\naddress these challenges, this study introduces CDT-TCS (Convex Dissection\nTopology-based Tethered Configuration Search), a novel algorithm that leverages\nCDT Encoding as a homotopy invariant to represent topological states of paths.\nBy integrating algebraic topology with geometric optimization, CDT-TCS\nefficiently computes the complete set of optimal feasible configurations for\ntethered robots at all positions in 2D environments through a single\ncomputation.

Prior work has shown that LLMs' refusal\nbehaviors can be mediated by a one-dimensional subspace, i.e., a refusal\ndirection. In this work, we identify a new dimension to analyze safety\nmechanisms in LLMs, i.e., harmfulness, which is encoded internally as a\nseparate concept from refusal. There exists a harmfulness direction that is\ndistinct from the refusal direction. As causal evidence, steering along the\nharmfulness direction can lead LLMs to interpret harmless instructions as\nharmful, but steering along the refusal direction tends to elicit refusal\nresponses directly without reversing the model's judgment on harmfulness.\nFurthermore, using our identified harmfulness concept, we find that certain\njailbreak methods work by reducing the refusal signals without reversing the\nmodel's internal belief of harmfulness. We also find that adversarially\nfinetuning models to accept harmful instructions has minimal impact on the\nmodel's internal belief of harmfulness. These insights lead to a practical\nsafety application: The model's latent harmfulness representation can serve as\nan intrinsic safeguard (Latent Guard) for detecting unsafe inputs and reducing\nover-refusals that is robust to finetuning attacks. For instance, our Latent\nGuard achieves performance comparable to or better than Llama Guard 3 8B, a\ndedicated finetuned safeguard model, across different jailbreak methods. Our\nfindings suggest that LLMs' internal understanding of harmfulness is more\nrobust than their refusal decision to diverse input instructions, offering a\nnew perspective to study AI safety",

While current methods have made progress in modeling spatiotemporal\npatterns, they face three key limitations: (1) lack of generalizable framework\napplicable to diverse disease progression prediction tasks; (2) frequent\noverlook of the ordinal nature inherent in disease staging; (3) susceptibility\nto representation collapse due to structural similarities between adjacent time\npoints, which can obscure subtle but discriminative progression biomarkers. To\naddress these limitations, we propose a Generalizable LOngitudinal Medical\nImage Analysis framework for disease Progression prediction (GLOMIA-Pro).\nGLOMIA-Pro consists of two core components: progression representation\nextraction and progression-aware fusion. The progression representation\nextraction module introduces a piecewise orthogonal attention mechanism and\nemploys a novel ordinal progression constraint to disentangle finegrained\ntemporal imaging variations relevant to disease progression. The\nprogression-aware fusion module incorporates a redesigned skip connection\narchitecture which integrates the learned progression representation with\ncurrent imaging representation, effectively mitigating representation collapse\nduring cross-temporal fusion. Validated on two distinct clinical applications:\nknee osteoarthritis severity prediction and esophageal cancer treatment\nresponse assessment, GLOMIA-Pro consistently outperforms seven state-of-the-art\nlongitudinal analysis methods.

The NANO\nfilter interprets Bayesian filtering as solutions to two distinct optimization\nproblems, which allows to define optimal Gaussian approximation and derive its\ncorresponding extremum conditions. The algorithm design still follows the\ntwo-step structure of Bayes filters. In the prediction step, NANO filter\ncalculates the first two moments of the prior distribution, and this process is\nequivalent to a moment-matching filter. In the update step, natural gradient\ndescent is employed to directly minimize the objective of the update step,\nthereby avoiding errors caused by model linearization. Comparative tests are\nconducted on four classic systems, including the damped linear oscillator,\nsequence forecasting, modified growth model, and robot localization, under\nGaussian, Laplace, and Beta noise to evaluate the NANO filter's capability in\nhandling nonlinearity.

Chapter two derives the replication strategy dynamics and introduces a\nnew two-factor volatility model: the OUOU model. Chapter three analyzes the\ndistribution and surface dynamics of implied volatilities using principal\ncomponent and common factor analysis. Chapter four discusses calibration\nmethods for stochastic volatility models, particularly the Heston model, and\npresents the new Implied Central Moments method to estimate parameters in the\nHeston and Sch\\\"obel-Zhu models.

This study proposes,\nevaluates and illustrates a bias reduction method when this assumption is\nviolated.

Results: Simulations showed that, in the presence of\nnegative (positive) event dependence, the crude PERR estimate of treatment\neffect was biased towards (away from) the null value. The proposed method\nsuccessfully reduced the bias, with median of absolute level of relative bias\nat about 5%. Dynamic random-intercept modelling revealed positive event\ndependence in emergency department visits among patients with advanced cancer.\nWhile conventional time-to-event regression analysis with covariate adjustment\nestimated higher rate of emergency department visits among palliative care\nrecipients (HR=3.61, P<0.001), crude PERR estimate and the proposed PERR\nestimate were 1.45 (P=0.22) and 1.22 (P=0.57), respectively. Conclusions: The\nproposed bias reduction method mitigates the impact of violation of the PERR\nassumption of absence of event dependence. It allows broader application of the\nPERR approach.",

Recent work, TroVE, argues that code-generating Large Language\nModels (LLMs) can benefit similarly on the MATH benchmark by inducing and\nreusing higher-level toolboxes. By allocating computational budget across an\nensemble of three modes -- directly generating code, creating tools, and\nreusing tools -- TroVE claims to outperform a PRIMITIVE baseline that only\nperforms direct generation. However, recent analysis (Berlot-Attwell et al.,\n2024) casts doubt on these gains, noting that the tools created are often\ntrivial or rarely reused, suggesting that improvements may stem from\nself-consistency or self-correction. In this work, we re-evaluate TroVE on\nMATH, analyze the impact of each of its modes, and show that its benefit does\nnot come from these mechanisms, but simply from a higher computational budget\nspent for TroVE compared to PRIMITIVE. To this end, we also perform a small\ncorrection in the original implementation of TroVE's selection mechanism,\nboosting TroVE's performance on MATH by 3\\% in accuracy.

To address this, we investigate rate-splitting multiple access\n(RSMA)-enabled near-field communications (NFC) under imperfect SCI. Our\ntransmit scheme employs a sub-connected hybrid analog-digital (HAD)\narchitecture to reduce hardware overhead while incorporating imperfect\nsuccessive interference cancellation (SIC) for practical implementation.

To\nsolve the non-convex problem, we develop a penalty-based block coordinate\ndescent (BCD) algorithm, deriving closed-form expressions for the optimal\nanalog and digital beamfocusers solutions. Furthermore, to reduce computational\ncomplexity, we propose a low-complexity algorithm, where analog and digital\nbeamfocusers are designed in two separate stages. Simulation results underscore\nthat: 1) beamfocusing alone is insufficient to fully suppress interference even\nunder perfect CSI; 2) RSMA exhibits superior interference management over SDMA\nunder imperfect CSI and SIC conditions; 3) sub-connected HAD architecture\ndelivers near-optimal digital beamfocusing performance with fewer radio\nfrequency chains.",

Recently, genomic selection has emerged as an efficient\nway for hybrid rice breeding. It predicts the traits of hybrids based on their\ngenes, which helps exclude many undesired hybrids, largely reducing the\nworkload of field cultivation. However, due to the limited accuracy of genomic\nprediction models, breeders still need to combine their experience with the\nmodels to identify regulatory genes that control traits and select hybrids,\nwhich remains a time-consuming process.

However, existing methods often\nrely on fixed and sparse trajectory supervision, limiting their ability to\ncapture the hierarchical reasoning process that human drivers naturally employ.\nTo bridge this gap, we propose ReAL-AD, a Reasoning-Augmented Learning\nframework that structures decision-making in autonomous driving based on the\nthree-tier human cognitive model: Driving Strategy, Driving Decision, and\nDriving Operation, where Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are incorporated to\nenhance situational awareness and structured reasoning across these levels.\nSpecifically, we introduce: (1) the Strategic Reasoning Injector, which\nformulates high-level driving strategies by interpreting complex traffic\ncontexts from VLM-generated insights; (2) the Tactical Reasoning Integrator,\nwhich refines strategic intent into interpretable tactical choices such as lane\nchanges, overtaking, and speed adjustments; and (3) the Hierarchical Trajectory\nDecoder, which progressively translates tactical decisions into precise control\nactions for smooth and human-like trajectory execution. Extensive evaluations\nshow that integrating our framework improves planning accuracy and safety by\nover 30%, making end-to-end autonomous driving more interpretable and aligned\nwith human-like hierarchical reasoning.

Unlike previous studies in\nthe literature, we consider contributions to nucleon decays from a complete set\nof dimension-eight BNV aLEFT operators involving light $u,\\,d,\\,s$ quarks. We\nperform the chiral irreducible representation (irrep) decomposition of all\nthose interactions under the QCD chiral group $\\rm SU(3)_{\\tt L}\\times\nSU(3)_{\\tt R}$, and match them onto the recently developed chiral framework to\nobtain nucleon-level effective interactions among the ALP, octet baryons, and\noctet pseudoscalar mesons.

We\nthen analyze the momentum distributions for the three-body modes and find that\nthe operators belonging to the newly identified chiral irreps $\\pmb{6}_{\\tt\nL(R)}\\times \\pmb{3}_{\\tt R(L)}$ exhibit markedly different behavior compared to\nthat in the usual irreps $\\pmb{8}_{\\tt L(R)}\\times \\pmb{1}_{\\tt R(L)}$ and\n$\\pmb{3}_{\\tt L(R)}\\times \\bar{\\pmb{3}}_{\\tt R(L)}$.

Our recasting constraints are\nseveral orders of magnitude more stringent than the inclusive bounds used in\nthe literature. Based on these improved bounds, we set stringent limits on the\nassociated effective scales across a broad range of ALP mass and predict\nstringent bounds on certain neutron and hyperon decays involving an ALP.",

However, existing numerical abstract\ninterpreters rely on hand-crafted, instruction-specific transformers tailored\nto each domain, with no general algorithm for handling common operations across\ndomains. This limits extensibility, prevents precise compositional reasoning\nover instruction sequences, and forces all downstream tasks to use the same\nfixed transformer regardless of their precision, efficiency, or task-specific\nrequirements. To address these limitations, we propose a universal transformer\nsynthesis algorithm that constructs a parametric family of sound abstract\ntransformers for any given polyhedral numerical domain and a concrete operator\nfrom the class of Quadratic-Bounded Guarded Operators (QGO), which includes\nboth individual instructions and structured sequences. Each instantiation in\nthis family is sound by construction, enabling downstream analyses to adapt the\ntransformer to their particular needs. The space of transformers is\ndifferentiable but complex. To efficiently explore this space of transformers,\nwe introduce the Adaptive Gradient Guidance (AGG) procedure, a gradient-guided\nsearch strategy that steers the search process based on downstream analysis\nobjectives and runtime constraints. We implement these ideas in the USTAD\nframework and evaluate their effectiveness across three numerical abstract\ndomains: Zones, Octagons, and Polyhedra. Our results demonstrate that the\nuniversal synthesis algorithm successfully constructs sound families of\ntransformers across domains, and that USTAD achieves significant, tunable\nprecision gains over baselines by leveraging compositional reasoning and\nefficient gradient-guided traversal of the transformer space.",

We systematically evaluate all mappings\ncorresponding to a subset of the Hamiltonian paths of the $N \\cross N$ grid\ngraphs up to $N=8$ and demonstrate that the fractal space-filling curves\ngenerally lead to faster convergence in ground state searches compared to the\ncommonly used ``snake\" path. To explain this performance gain, we analyze\nvarious locality metrics and propose a scalable method for constructing\nhigh-performing paths on larger lattices by tiling smaller optimal paths. Our\nresults show that such paths consistently improve simulation convergence, with\nthe advantage increasing with system size.",

Comput.\n30 (2021)] established a spectral version by showing that if $G$ is a\ntriangle-free non-bipartite graph on $n$ vertices, then $\\lambda (G)\\le \\lambda\n(S_1(T_{n-1,2}))$, with equality if and only if $G=S_1(T_{n-1,2})$, where\n$S_1(T_{n-1,2})$ is obtained from $T_{n-1,2}$ by subdividing an edge. In this\npaper, we investigate the maximum spectral radius of a non-bipartite graph\nwithout some short odd cycles. Let $C_{2\\ell +1}(T_{n-2\\ell, 2})$ be the graph\nobtained by identifying a vertex of $C_{2\\ell+1}$ and a vertex of the smaller\npartite set of $T_{n-2\\ell ,2}$.

This\nresult could be viewed as a spectral analogue of a min-degree result due to\nYuan and Peng [European J. Combin. 127 (2025)]. Moreover, our result extends a\nresult of Guo, Lin and Zhao [Linear Algebra Appl. 627 (2021)] as well as a\nrecent result of Zhang and Zhao [Discrete Math. 346 (2023)] since we can get\nrid of the condition that $n$ is sufficiently large.

    "abstract": "Learning with noisy labels (LNL) is essential for training deep neural\nnetworks with imperfect data. Meta-learning approaches have achieved success by\nusing a clean unbiased labeled set to train a robust model. However, this\napproach heavily depends on the availability of a clean labeled meta-dataset,\nwhich is difficult to obtain in practice. In this work, we thus tackle the\nchallenge of meta-learning for noisy label scenarios without relying on a clean\nlabeled dataset. Our approach leverages the data itself while bypassing the\nneed for labels. Building on the insight that clean samples effectively\npreserve the consistency of related data structures across the last hidden and\nthe final layer, whereas noisy samples disrupt this consistency, we design the\nCross-layer Information Divergence-based Meta Update Strategy (CLID-MU).\nCLID-MU leverages the alignment of data structures across these diverse feature\nspaces to evaluate model performance and use this alignment to guide training.\nExperiments on benchmark datasets with varying amounts of labels under both\nsynthetic and real-world noise demonstrate that CLID-MU outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "Universal machine learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs) have emerged as\npowerful tools for accelerating atomistic simulations, offering scalable and\nefficient modeling with accuracy close to quantum calculations. However, their\nreliability and effectiveness in practical, real-world applications remain an\nopen question. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and related nanoporous materials\nare highly porous crystals with critical relevance in carbon capture, energy\nstorage, and catalysis applications. Modeling nanoporous materials presents\ndistinct challenges for uMLIPs due to their diverse chemistry, structural\ncomplexity, including porosity and coordination bonds, and the absence from\nexisting training datasets. Here, we introduce MOFSimBench, a benchmark to\nevaluate uMLIPs on key materials modeling tasks for nanoporous materials,\nincluding structural optimization, molecular dynamics (MD) stability, the\nprediction of bulk properties, such as bulk modulus and heat capacity, and\nguest-host interactions. Evaluating over 20 models from various architectures\non a chemically and structurally diverse materials set, we find that\ntop-performing uMLIPs consistently outperform classical force fields and\nfine-tuned machine learning potentials across all tasks, demonstrating their\nreadiness for deployment in nanoporous materials modeling. Our analysis\nhighlights that data quality, particularly the diversity of training sets and\ninclusion of out-of-equilibrium conformations, plays a more critical role than\nmodel architecture in determining performance across all evaluated uMLIPs. We\nrelease our modular and extendable benchmarking framework at\nhttps://github.com/AI4ChemS/mofsim-bench, providing an open resource to guide\nthe adoption for nanoporous materials modeling and further development of\nuMLIPs.",
