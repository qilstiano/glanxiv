On the other\nhand, nonequilibrium physics provides a variational principle that describes\nhow fairly generic noisy dynamical systems are most likely to transition\nbetween two states; in this work, we exploit this principle to apply Noether's\ntheorem, and hence learn about how the continuous symmetries of dynamical\nsystems constrain their most likely trajectories.

Without this dual\nperspective, assessments may favor models that perform well on easy instances\nwhile failing to capture their true robustness. To address this limitation,\nthis study introduces a novel evaluation methodology that combines Item\nResponse Theory (IRT) with the Glicko-2 rating system, originally developed to\nmeasure player strength in competitive games. IRT assesses classifier ability\nbased on performance over difficult instances, while Glicko-2 updates\nperformance metrics - such as rating, deviation, and volatility - via simulated\ntournaments between classifiers. This combined approach provides a fairer and\nmore nuanced measure of algorithm capability. A case study using the\nOpenML-CC18 benchmark showed that only 15% of the datasets are truly\nchallenging and that a reduced subset with 50% of the original datasets offers\ncomparable evaluation power. Among the algorithms tested, Random Forest\nachieved the highest ability score.

We establish fundamental properties, including\ncompleteness for $V= C^r (r \\ge 1)$ or $H^k (k > \\dim(M)/2+1)$, and naturality\nunder diffeomorphisms. We show the utility of these metrics by proving\nquantitative stability results: proximity in $\\dAnV{V}$ implies controlled\nvariation of essential dynamical invariants, including topological entropy,\nLyapunov exponents, SRB measures, thermodynamic pressure, spectral gaps (mixing\nrates), and zeta functions. Sufficient regularity ensures local Lipschitz\ncontinuity and Fr\\'echet differentiability, connecting the metric structure to\nlinear response formulas, particularly for pressure, exponents, and the\nspectral gap. While Sobolev metrics yield locally flat geometry with straight\nline geodesics, the framework is broadly applicable. We explore implications\nfor the moduli space of Anosov flows, including stability of invariants and the\nframework for local slice theorems. Furthermore, we introduce \\emph{Topological\nAnosov Flows}, defined via simultaneous uniform flow convergence and $\\dAn$\nmetric convergence of the generating fields.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated revolutionary capabilities in\nunderstanding complex contexts and performing a wide range of tasks. However,\nLLMs can also answer questions that are unethical or harmful, raising concerns\nabout their applications. To regulate LLMs' responses to such questions, a\ntraining strategy called \\textit{alignment} can help. Yet, alignment can be\nunexpectedly compromised when fine-tuning an LLM for downstream tasks. This\npaper focuses on recovering the alignment lost during fine-tuning.\n  We observe that there are two distinct directions inherent in an aligned LLM:\nthe \\textit{aligned direction} and the \\textit{harmful direction}. An LLM is\ninclined to answer questions in the aligned direction while refusing queries in\nthe harmful direction. Therefore, we propose to recover the harmful direction\nof the fine-tuned model that has been compromised. Specifically, we restore a\nsmall subset of the fine-tuned model's weight parameters from the original\naligned model using gradient descent. We also introduce a rollback mechanism to\navoid aggressive recovery and maintain downstream task performance. Our\nevaluation on 125 fine-tuned LLMs demonstrates that our method can reduce their\nharmful rate (percentage of answering harmful questions) from 33.25\\% to\n1.74\\%, without sacrificing task performance much. In contrast, the existing\nmethods either only reduce the harmful rate to a limited extent or\nsignificantly impact the normal functionality.

    "abstract": "Automated analysis for engineering structures offers considerable potential\nfor boosting efficiency by minimizing repetitive tasks. Although AI-driven\nmethods are increasingly common, no systematic framework yet leverages Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) for automatic structural analysis. To address this gap,\nwe propose a novel framework that integrates LLMs with structural analysis\nsoftware. LLMs serve as the core engine: they parse structural descriptions\nfrom text and translate them into executable Python scripts. Moreover, the\nframework integrates the generative capabilities of LLMs with code-based finite\nelement (FE) tools like OpenSeesPy. It employs domain-specific prompt design\nand in-context learning strategies to enhance the LLM's problem-solving\ncapabilities and generative stability, enabling fully automated structural\nanalysis from descriptive text to model outputs. In our experiments, we\nintroduce a well-curated small-scale benchmark dataset of 20 structural\nanalysis word problems (SAWPs) with ground-truth solutions and evaluate the\nperformance of different LLMs within our framework in solving these SAWPs. The\nrole of system instructions, crafted by structural engineers, is also\ninvestigated to understand their impact on LLM-driven structural analysis.\nAdditionally, the generative stability of our framework is examined. Through\nmultiple validation experiments on the benchmark, our results demonstrate that\nthe proposed framework can substantially increase the level of automation in\nsolving SAWPs compared to traditional methods. Quantitatively, the framework,\nbuilt on GPT-4o, achieved 100% accuracy, surpassing GPT-4 (85%), Gemini 1.5 Pro\n(80%), and Llama-3.3 (30%) on the test examples.

We\nattempt to reproduce these enrichments by modeling the atmosphere as nebular\ngas that extracted heavy elements from accreted solids.

Our binary modeling indicates that the program target is a\nW-subclass contact binary with a mass ratio of $q$ = 5.48, an inclination angle\nof $i$ = 81$^\\circ$.68, a temperature difference of ($T_{\\rm eff,1}-T_{\\rm\neff,2}$) = 154 K, and a filling factor of $f$ = 36 \\%. The light asymmetries\nwere reasonably modeled by a dark starspot on the secondary's photosphere.\nIncluding our 26 minimum epochs, 84 times of minimum light were used to\ninvestigate the orbital period of the system. We found that the eclipse times\nof GV Leo have varied by a sinusoid with a period of 14.9 years and a\nsemi-amplitude of 0.0076 days superimposed on a downward parabola. The periodic\nmodulation is interpreted as a light time effect produced by an unseen outer\ntertiary with a minimum mass of 0.26 M$_\\odot$, while the parabolic component\nis thought to be a combination of mass transfer (secondary to primary) and\nangular momentum loss driven by magnetic braking. The circumbinary tertiary\nwould have caused the eclipsing pair of GV Leo to evolve into its current\nshort-period contact state by removing angular momentum from the primordial\nwidish binary.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider the classification of compact ancient noncollapsed\nmean curvature flows of hypersurfaces in arbitrary dimensions. More precisely,\nwe study $k$-ovals in $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, defined as ancient noncollapsed\nsolutions whose tangent flow at $-\\infty$ is given by $\\mathbb{R}^k \\times\nS^{n-k}((2(n-k)|t|)^{\\frac{1}{2}})$ for some $k \\in \\{1,\\dots,n-1\\}$, and whose\nfine cylindrical matrix has full rank. A significant advance achieved recently\nby Choi and Haslhofer suggests that the shrinking $n$-sphere and $k$-ovals\ntogether account for all compact ancient noncollapsed solutions in\n$\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. We prove that $k$-ovals are $\\mathbb{Z}^{k}_2 \\times\n\\mathrm{O}(n+1-k)$-symmetric and are uniquely determined by $(k-1)$-dimensional\nspectral ratio parameters. This result is sharp in view of the\n$(k-1)$-parameter family of $\\mathbb{Z}^{k}_2 \\times\n\\mathrm{O}(n+1-k)$-symmetric ancient ovals constructed by Du and Haslhofer, as\nwell as the conjecture of Angenent, Daskalopoulos and Sesum concerning the\nmoduli space of ancient solutions. We also establish a new spectral stability\ntheorem, which suggests the local $(k-1)$-rectifiability of the moduli space of\n$k$-ovals modulo space-time rigid motion and parabolic rescaling. In contrast\nto the case of $2$-ovals in $\\mathbb{R}^4$, resolved by Choi, Daskalopoulos,\nDu, Haslhofer and Sesum, the general case for arbitrary $k$ and $n$ presents\nnew challenges beyond increased algebraic complexity. In particular, the\nquadratic concavity estimates in the collar region and the absence of a global\nparametrization with regularity information pose major obstacles. To address\nthese difficulties, we introduce a novel test tensor that produces essential\ngradient terms for the tensor maximum principle, and we derive a local\nLipschitz continuity result by parameterizing $k$-ovals with nearly matching\nspectral ratio parameters.",

In\nparticular, our large number of measurements allows us to investigate differing\nmagnetic field behaviour in the upper and lower halves of the Galactic plane.\nWe find that the GMF is best explained as following the spiral arms in a\nroughly bisymmetric structure, with antisymmetric parity with respect to the\nGalactic plane. This picture is complicated by variations in parity on\ndifferent spiral arms, and the parity change location appears to be shifted by\na distance of 0.15 kpc perpendicular to the Galactic plane.

For imperfect-information games in extensive form, we could\nconvert the game to strategic form and then iteratively remove dominated\nstrategies in the same way; however, this conversion may cause an exponential\nblowup in game size. In this paper we define and study the concept of dominated\nactions in imperfect-information games.

The electron paramagnetic\nresonance (EPR) spectra reveal the great amount of oxygen vacancies in the\nannealed samples, at that the decrease of the orthorhombic phase fraction\n(observed with an increase in the annealing temperature) correlates with a\ndecrease in the intensity of EPR spectral lines associated with the oxygen\nvacancies and impurities. This indicates the participation of oxygen vacancies\nand other defects in the formation of the orthorhombic phase in the\nHf0.5Zr0.5O2 powders. To explain the results of electrophysical measurements,\nwe compare the features of the current-voltage characteristics with the phase\ncomposition of the Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 powders and with the peculiarities of their EPR\nspectra.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training have led\nto notable improvements in large language models (LLMs), particularly in\nenhancing their reasoning capabilities to handle complex tasks. However, most\nexisting methods treat the training data as a unified whole, overlooking the\nfact that modern LLM training often involves a mixture of data from diverse\ndistributions-varying in both source and difficulty. This heterogeneity\nintroduces a key challenge: how to adaptively schedule training across\ndistributions to optimize learning efficiency. In this paper, we present a\nprincipled curriculum learning framework grounded in the notion of\ndistribution-level learnability. Our core insight is that the magnitude of\npolicy advantages reflects how much a model can still benefit from further\ntraining on a given distribution. Based on this, we propose a\ndistribution-level curriculum learning framework for RL-based LLM\npost-training, which leverages the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) principle to\ndynamically adjust sampling probabilities for different distrubutions. This\napproach prioritizes distributions with either high average advantage\n(exploitation) or low sample count (exploration), yielding an adaptive and\ntheoretically grounded training schedule. We instantiate our curriculum\nlearning framework with GRPO as the underlying RL algorithm and demonstrate its\neffectiveness on logic reasoning datasets with multiple difficulties and\nsources. Our experiments show that our framework significantly improves\nconvergence speed and final performance, highlighting the value of\ndistribution-aware curriculum strategies in LLM post-training.

    "abstract": "In practical instances of nonconvex matrix factorization, the rank of the\ntrue solution $r^{\\star}$ is often unknown, so the rank $r$ of the model can be\noverspecified as $r>r^{\\star}$. This over-parameterized regime of matrix\nfactorization significantly slows down the convergence of local search\nalgorithms, from a linear rate with $r=r^{\\star}$ to a sublinear rate when\n$r>r^{\\star}$. We propose an inexpensive preconditioner for the matrix sensing\nvariant of nonconvex matrix factorization that restores the convergence rate of\ngradient descent back to linear, even in the over-parameterized case, while\nalso making it agnostic to possible ill-conditioning in the ground truth.\nClassical gradient descent in a neighborhood of the solution slows down due to\nthe need for the model matrix factor to become singular. Our key result is that\nthis singularity can be corrected by $\\ell_{2}$ regularization with a specific\nrange of values for the damping parameter. In fact, a good damping parameter\ncan be inexpensively estimated from the current iterate. The resulting\nalgorithm, which we call preconditioned gradient descent or PrecGD, is stable\nunder noise, and converges linearly to an information theoretically optimal\nerror bound.

Material degradation is\naffected by many factors, including the history of corrosion and\ncharacteristics of the environment, which can be measured by high-frequency\nsensors. However, the high volume of data produced by such sensors can inhibit\nefficient modeling and prediction. To alleviate this issue, we propose novel\nmetrics for representing material degradation, taking the form of discrete\ndegradation events. These events maintain the statistical properties of\ncontinuous sensor readings, such as correlation with time to coating failure\nand coefficient of variation at failure, but are composed of orders of\nmagnitude fewer measurements. To forecast future degradation of the coating\nsystem, a marked Hawkes process models the events. We use the forecast of\ndegradation to predict a future time of failure, exhibiting superior\nperformance to the approach based on direct modeling of galvanic corrosion\nusing continuous sensor measurements. While such maintenance is typically done\non a regular basis, degradation models can enable informed condition-based\nmaintenance, reducing unnecessary excess maintenance and preventing unexpected\nfailures.",

    "abstract": "Developing autonomous robots capable of learning and reproducing complex\nmotions from demonstrations remains a fundamental challenge in robotics. On the\none hand, movement primitives (MPs) provide a compact and modular\nrepresentation of continuous trajectories. On the other hand, autonomous\nsystems provide control policies that are time independent. We propose in this\npaper a simple and flexible approach that gathers the advantages of both\nrepresentations by transforming MPs into autonomous systems. The key idea is to\ntransform the explicit representation of a trajectory as an implicit shape\nencoded as a distance field. This conversion from a time-dependent motion to a\nspatial representation enables the definition of an autonomous dynamical system\nwith modular reactions to perturbation. Asymptotic stability guarantees are\nprovided by using Bernstein basis functions in the MPs, representing\ntrajectories as concatenated quadratic B\\'ezier curves, which provide an\nanalytical method for computing distance fields. This approach bridges\nconventional MPs with distance fields, ensuring smooth and precise motion\nencoding, while maintaining a continuous spatial representation. By simply\nleveraging the analytic gradients of the curve and its distance field, a stable\ndynamical system can be computed to reproduce the demonstrated trajectories\nwhile handling perturbations, without requiring a model of the dynamical system\nto be estimated. Numerical simulations and real-world robotic experiments\nvalidate our method's ability to encode complex motion patterns while ensuring\ntrajectory stability, together with the flexibility of designing the desired\nreaction to perturbations.

Unlike prior work, e.g., AI Scientist, which evaluates the\nend-to-end agentic pipeline by using LLM-as-a-judge, MLRC-Bench measures the\nkey steps of proposing and implementing novel research methods and evaluates\nthem with rigorous protocol and objective metrics. Our curated suite of 7\ncompetition tasks reveals significant challenges for LLM agents. Even the\nbest-performing tested agent (gemini-exp-1206 under MLAB) closes only 9.3% of\nthe gap between baseline and top human participant scores. Furthermore, our\nanalysis reveals a misalignment between the LLM-judged innovation and actual\nperformance on cutting-edge ML research problems. MLRC-Bench is a dynamic\nbenchmark, designed to grow with new ML competitions and encourage rigorous,\nobjective evaluations of AI research capabilities.

    "abstract": "Faraday rotation describes the change of the linear polarization angle of\nradiation passing through a magnetized plasma and it is quantified by the\nrotation measure (RM), which is related to the line-of-sight (LOS) magnetic\nfield component and the thermal electron density traversed by light along its\npath toward the observer. However, it is challenging to disentangle the signal\nfrom different LOS portions and separate the contribution from the local ISM.\nThis is particularly relevant since the Sun is located within the Local Bubble\n(LB), a low-density and hot cavity formed by past SN events, making it\nessential to investigate how this environment may influence the observed RM\nvalues. The present study investigates the imprint of the local environment on\nthe synthetic RM signal, as measured by an observer within a LB-like cavity.\nThe RM derived from diffuse polarized synchrotron radiation produced by CR\nelectrons at decimeter wavelengths is also analyzed. We produce synthetic RM\nmaps for an observer placed inside a LB candidate, selected from a MHD\nsimulation that resembles the properties of the ISM in the Solar vicinity.\nUsing the capabilities of the radiative transfer code POLARIS, we study the\nimprint of the cavity walls on the RM signal. As the MHD simulation does not\naccount for CR diffusion, we develop a CR toy-model to study the Faraday\nrotation of the diffuse polarized synchrotron radiation. We find that (i) the\nimprint of local structures, such as the walls of the LB candidate and the\nedges of other supernovae blown cavities, is of fundamental importance for\ninterpreting the global Faraday sky; (ii) the LB has a non negligible\ncontribution to the sinusoidal patterns of RM as a function of Galactic\nlongitude seen in observations; and (iii) the RM signal from diffuse\nsynchrotron emission shows a strong correspondence with the RM signal generated\nby the LB candidate walls.",

A long-standing limitation is that the instrument\ntip position obtained from the da Vinci API is inaccurate and requires hand-eye\ncalibration. Thus, directly computing the position of the tool tip in the\ncamera frame using the vision-based method becomes an attractive solution.\nBesides, surgical instrument tip detection is the key component of other tasks,\nlike surgical skill assessment and surgery automation.

    "abstract": "Topological spin configurations, such as soliton-like spin texture and Dirac\nelectron assemblies, have emerged in recent years in both fundamental science\nand technological applications. Achieving stable topological spin textures at\nroom-temperature is crucial for enabling these structures as long-range\ninformation carriers. However, their creation and manipulation processes have\nencountered difficulties due to multi-step field training techniques and\ncompetitive interactions. Thus, a spontaneous ground state for\nmulti-dimensional topological spin textures is desirable, as skyrmions form\nswirling, hedgehog-like spin structures in two dimensions, while hopfions\nemerge as their twisted three-dimensional counterparts. Here, we report the\nfirst observation of robust and reproducible topological spin textures of\nhopfions and skyrmions observed at room temperature and in zero magnetic field,\nwhich are stabilized by geometric confinement and protected by interfacial\nmagnetism in a ferromagnet/topological insulator/ferromagnet trilayer\nheterostructure. These skyrmion-hopfion configurations are directly observed at\nroom temperature with Lorenz transmission electron microscopy. Using\nmicromagnetic modelling, the experimental observations of hopfion-skyrmion\nassemblies are reproduced. Our model reveals a complete picture of how\nspontaneously organized skyrmion lattices encircled by hopfion rings are\ncontrolled by surface electrons, uniaxial anisotropy and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya\ninteraction, all at ambient temperature. Our study provides evidence that\ntopological chiral spin textures can facilitate the development of magnetically\ndefined information carriers. These stable structures hold promise for\nultralow-power and high-density information processing, paving the way for the\nnext generation of topologically defined devices.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the previously unexplored quantum dynamics of\nnon-relativistic, spinless particles propagating in curved spaces with torsion.\nOur findings demonstrate that while torsion has been predominantly associated\nwith spin, it can also influence the quantum behavior of spinless particles by\ninducing a logarithmic nonlinearity in the Schroedinger equation through\nquantum fluctuations, even in flat space. To facilitate quantization in curved\nspaces, we introduce a novel stochastic variational method. Unlike canonical\nquantization, this approach is naturally suited to general coordinate systems,\nwith quantum fluctuations arising from a noise term in the stochastic process\nthat is directly influenced by torsion. By requiring consistency with quantum\ndynamics, we ultimately derive an upper bound on the magnitude of torsion. Our\nresults reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism by which torsion, as\npredicted in certain extensions of general relativity, can influence quantum\nsystems, with potential implications for early-universe physics and dark matter\nor energy models.",

We demonstrate that the non-Hermiticity of an\nopen cavity facilitates the formation of the DBS, which consists of the\nvacancy-like DBS and Friedrich-Wintgen DBS. By deriving analytical conditions\nfor these DBS, we show that when a two-level atom couples to the standing-wave\nmode that corresponds to a node of the photonic wave function the vacancy-like\nDBS occur, which are characterized by null spectral density at cavity\nresonance. Conversely, Friedrich-Wintgen DBS can be realized by continuously\nadjusting system parameters and indicated by the disappearance of the Rabi peak\nin the emission spectrum, which is a distinctive feature in the strong-coupling\nregime. Moreover, we extend our analysis to the non-Markovian regime and find\nthat our results are consistent with those obtained under the Markovian\napproximation in the wideband limit. In the non-Markovian regime, we analyze\nDBS for both zero and non-zero accumulated phase factors. For zero accumulated\nphase factors, the non-Markovian regime exhibits higher peak values and longer\nrelaxation times for vacancy-like DBS compared to the Markovian regime, where\nthe Friedrich-Wintgen DBS are absent in the non-Markovian case. Finally, we\nestablish the correspondence between the energy spectrum and bound state\nconditions for non-zero accumulated phase factors and analyze the influence of\nvarious parameters on non-Markovian bound states.

    "abstract": "Underwater image dehazing is critical for vision-based marine operations\nbecause light scattering and absorption can severely reduce visibility. This\npaper introduces snnTrans-DHZ, a lightweight Spiking Neural Network (SNN)\nspecifically designed for underwater dehazing. By leveraging the temporal\ndynamics of SNNs, snnTrans-DHZ efficiently processes time-dependent raw image\nsequences while maintaining low power consumption. Static underwater images are\nfirst converted into time-dependent sequences by repeatedly inputting the same\nimage over user-defined timesteps. These RGB sequences are then transformed\ninto LAB color space representations and processed concurrently. The\narchitecture features three key modules: (i) a K estimator that extracts\nfeatures from multiple color space representations; (ii) a Background Light\nEstimator that jointly infers the background light component from the RGB-LAB\nimages; and (iii) a soft image reconstruction module that produces haze-free,\nvisibility-enhanced outputs. The snnTrans-DHZ model is directly trained using a\nsurrogate gradient-based backpropagation through time (BPTT) strategy alongside\na novel combined loss function. Evaluated on the UIEB benchmark, snnTrans-DHZ\nachieves a PSNR of 21.68 dB and an SSIM of 0.8795, and on the EUVP dataset, it\nyields a PSNR of 23.46 dB and an SSIM of 0.8439. With only 0.5670 million\nnetwork parameters, and requiring just 7.42 GSOPs and 0.0151 J of energy, the\nalgorithm significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms\nof efficiency. These features make snnTrans-DHZ highly suitable for deployment\nin underwater robotics, marine exploration, and environmental monitoring.",

To address these risks, we\npropose EmoAgent, a multi-agent AI framework designed to evaluate and mitigate\nmental health hazards in human-AI interactions. EmoAgent comprises two\ncomponents: EmoEval simulates virtual users, including those portraying\nmentally vulnerable individuals, to assess mental health changes before and\nafter interactions with AI characters. It uses clinically proven psychological\nand psychiatric assessment tools (PHQ-9, PDI, PANSS) to evaluate mental risks\ninduced by LLM. EmoGuard serves as an intermediary, monitoring users' mental\nstatus, predicting potential harm, and providing corrective feedback to\nmitigate risks. Experiments conducted in popular character-based chatbots show\nthat emotionally engaging dialogues can lead to psychological deterioration in\nvulnerable users, with mental state deterioration in more than 34.4% of the\nsimulations. EmoGuard significantly reduces these deterioration rates,\nunderscoring its role in ensuring safer AI-human interactions. Our code is\navailable at: https://github.com/1akaman/EmoAgent",

An effective load consolidation\nplan relies on carefully chosen consolidation points to ensure alignment with\nexisting transportation management processes, such as driver scheduling,\npersonnel planning, and terminal operations. This complexity represents a\nsignificant challenge when searching for optimal consolidation strategies.\nTraditional optimization-based methods provide exact solutions, but their\ncomputational complexity makes them impractical for large-scale instances and\nthey fail to leverage historical data. Machine learning-based approaches\naddress these issues but often ignore operational constraints, leading to\ninfeasible consolidation plans.\n  This work proposes SPOT, an end-to-end approach that integrates the benefits\nof machine learning (ML) and optimization for load consolidation. The ML\ncomponent plays a key role in the planning phase by identifying the\nconsolidation points through spatio-temporal clustering and constrained\nfrequent itemset mining, while the optimization selects the most cost-effective\nfeasible consolidation routes for a given operational day. Extensive\nexperiments conducted on industrial load data demonstrate that SPOT\nsignificantly reduces travel distance and transportation costs (by about 50% on\nlarge terminals) compared to the existing industry-standard load planning\nstrategy and a neighborhood-based heuristic. Moreover, the ML component\nprovides valuable tactical-level insights by identifying frequently recurring\nconsolidation opportunities that guide proactive planning.

A small\nfraction of these galaxies, called red nuggets, formed during the first phase\nmay have survived frozen until today, experiencing no massive mergers since\nz~2. Nearby massive compact ETGs are considered candidates for such relic\ngalaxies. We study the internal dynamical structures of 15 compact ETGs with\nexisting integral field unit (IFU) observations and 79 compact ETGs from the\nTNG50 simulation. We dynamically decompose each galaxy into a disk, bulge, and\nhot inner stellar halo, for both observations and simulations. In TNG50, the\nluminosity fraction of the hot inner stellar halo (or the size of the spheroid,\nwhich includes the bulge and halo) strongly correlates with the galaxy merger\nhistory. The true merger-free galaxies show an extremely low fraction of a hot\ninner stellar halo (or an extremely compact spheroid). Although such\ncompactness could result from the tidal stripping of satellites, tidal forces\nwould also destroy the dynamically cold disk (if one exists) when the halo is\nremoved. Thus, a galaxy is guaranteed to be merger-free if it has a very low\nfraction of the hot inner stellar halo and retains a dynamically cold disk.\nComparing observed galaxies with TNG50, we identify 7 of the 15 compact ETGs,\nPGC 11179, UGC 3816, NGC 2767, NGC 1277, PGC 32873, PGC 12562, and PGC 70520,\nas true merger-free galaxies.

These consecutive frame images enable the algorithm\nto update the position and state of the target in real-time in each frame of\nthe image. How to accurately associate the detected target with the target in\nthe previous or next frame to form a stable trajectory is a complex problem.\nTherefore, a multi object tracking and detection method for intelligent driving\nvehicles based on YOLOv5 and point cloud 3D projection is proposed. Using\nRetinex algorithm to enhance the image of the environment in front of the\nvehicle, remove light interference in the image, and build an intelligent\ndetection model based on YOLOv5 network structure. The enhanced image is input\ninto the model, and multiple targets in front of the vehicle are identified\nthrough feature extraction and target localization.

By\nsequentially projecting the multi-target recognition results of multiple\nconsecutive frame images into the 3D laser point cloud environment, effective\ntracking of the motion trajectories of all targets in front of the vehicle can\nbe achieved.

This rotational effect on viscosities\nis more evident at lower temperatures than at higher temperatures. Our analysis\nalso shows that, compared to the standard relaxation time approximation, the\nshear viscosity is lower while the bulk viscosity is higher in the novel\nrelaxation time approximation for all temperatures. Additionally, some\nobservables related to the flow characteristic, fluid behavior and conformal\nsymmetry of the medium are markedly impacted due to rotation.

To address this, we introduce the uncertainty\nguidance learning approach to SOD, intended to enhance the model's perception\nof uncertain regions.

Unlike conventional methods dedicated to enhancing\nfeatures, the proposed MIA facilitates the interaction and perception of\nmultilevel features, leveraging the complementary characteristics among\nmultilevel features. Then, through the proposed SSCA, the salient information\nacross diverse scales within the aggregated features can be integrated more\ncomprehensively and integrally. In the subsequent steps, we utilize the\nuncertainty map generated from the saliency prediction map to enhance the\nmodel's perception capability of uncertain regions, generating a\nhighly-saturated fine-grained saliency prediction map. Additionally, we devise\nan adaptive dynamic partition (ADP) mechanism to minimize the computational\noverhead of the URA module and improve the utilization of uncertainty guidance.\nExperiments on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the\nproposed UGRAN over the state-of-the-art methodologies.

    "abstract": "To accurately represent disease spread, epidemiological models must account\nfor the complex network topology and contact heterogeneity. Traditionally, most\nstudies have used random heterogeneous networks, which ignore correlations\nbetween the nodes' degrees. Yet, many real-world networks exhibit degree\nassortativity - the tendency for nodes with similar degrees to connect. Here we\nexplore the effect degree assortativity (or disassortativity) has on long-term\ndynamics and disease extinction in the realm of the\nsusceptible-infected-susceptible model on heterogeneous networks. We derive\nanalytical results for the mean time to extinction (MTE) in assortative\nnetworks with weak heterogeneity, and show that increased assortativity reduces\nthe MTE and that assortativity and degree heterogeneity are interchangeable\nwith regard to their impact on the MTE. Our analytical results are verified\nusing the weighted ensemble numerical method, on both synthetic and real-world\nnetworks. Notably, this method allows us to go beyond the capabilities of\ntraditional numerical tools, enabling us to study rare events in large\nassortative networks, which were previously inaccessible.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces the NSB-ARDL (Nonlinear Structural Break Autoregressive\nDistributed Lag) model, a novel econometric framework designed to capture\nasymmetric and nonlinear dynamics in macroeconomic time series. Traditional\nARDL models, while widely used for estimating short- and long-run\nrelationships, rely on assumptions of linearity and symmetry that may overlook\ncritical structural features in real-world data. The NSB-ARDL model overcomes\nthese limitations by decomposing explanatory variables into cumulative positive\nand negative partial sums, enabling the identification of both short- and\nlong-term asymmetries.\n  Monte Carlo simulations show that NSB-ARDL consistently outperforms\nconventional ARDL models in terms of forecasting accuracy when asymmetric\nresponses are present in the data-generating process. An empirical application\nto South Korea's CO2 emissions demonstrates the model's practical advantages,\nyielding a better in-sample fit and more interpretable long-run coefficients.\nThese findings highlight the NSB-ARDL model as a structurally robust and\nforecasting-efficient alternative for analyzing nonlinear macroeconomic\nphenomena.",

In this paper, we extend the XNLI task for one additional\nlow-resource language, Myanmar, as a proxy challenge for broader low-resource\nlanguages, and make three core contributions. First, we build a dataset called\nMyanmar XNLI (myXNLI) using community crowd-sourced methods, as an extension to\nthe existing XNLI corpus. This involves a two-stage process of community-based\nconstruction followed by expert verification; through an analysis, we\ndemonstrate and quantify the value of the expert verification stage in the\ncontext of community-based construction for low-resource languages. We make the\nmyXNLI dataset available to the community for future research. Second, we carry\nout evaluations of recent multilingual language models on the myXNLI benchmark,\nas well as explore data-augmentation methods to improve model performance. Our\ndata-augmentation methods improve model accuracy by up to 2 percentage points\nfor Myanmar, while uplifting other languages at the same time.

However, traditional remote sensing\nworkflows often rely on explicit segmentation or detection methods, which\nstruggle to handle complex, implicit queries that require reasoning over\nspatial context, domain knowledge, and implicit user intent. Motivated by this,\nwe introduce a new task, \\ie, geospatial pixel reasoning, which allows implicit\nquerying and reasoning and generates the mask of the target region. To advance\nthis task, we construct and release the first large-scale benchmark dataset\ncalled EarthReason, which comprises 5,434 manually annotated image masks with\nover 30,000 implicit question-answer pairs. Moreover, we propose SegEarth-R1, a\nsimple yet effective language-guided segmentation baseline that integrates a\nhierarchical visual encoder, a large language model (LLM) for instruction\nparsing, and a tailored mask generator for spatial correlation. The design of\nSegEarth-R1 incorporates domain-specific adaptations, including aggressive\nvisual token compression to handle ultra-high-resolution remote sensing images,\na description projection module to fuse language and multi-scale features, and\na streamlined mask prediction pipeline that directly queries description\nembeddings.

The model introduces the possibility of a multicomponent DM scenario\nleading to distinctive signals at colliders. The SM is extended by a ``dark\"\n$SU(2)_{D}$ gauge symmetry and new fermions and scalar doublets, charged only\nunder $SU(2)_{D}$, that provide candidates for a multicomponent DM. Previously,\nwe have considered in this model the asymmetric DM scenario, while in the\npresent work, we explore the symmetric DM case. We focus on the parameter\nregion where the dark fermion DM annihilates dominantly into the additional\ndark gauge bosons and the ``inert\" doublet DM annihilates to SM states via the\nSM Higgs resonance. This particular choice of doublet mass ensures that the\nheavier BSM Higgs always has one decay mode open to DM leading to the\npossibility of detecting such particles at the LHC, in the missing energy plus\ndijet ($\\cancel{E}_{T}+2j$) final states. We also discuss the prospects for\ndetecting DM through direct and indirect detection experiments and via\nLong-Lived-Particle searches. Finally, we show that, as typical of other WIMP\nmodels, for low DM mass, signals can be expected in future collider\nexperiments, but for the higher mass range above $500$ GeV we have to rely\nsolely on direct detection experiments. Both types of experiments will be\nessential to fully cover the allowed parameter space.",

Their enhanced excitonic\nbinding energies and large transition dipole moments enable strong coupling\nwith light, with some systems already reaching the ultrastrong coupling regime.\nIn contrast, a wide range of two-dimensional (2D) materials has been\nextensively explored in the literature, exhibiting high exciton stability and\nstrong electron-hole coupling due to reduced screening effects. In this Letter,\nwe present a microscopic model describing the interaction of 2D materials and\norganic molecular aggregates in an optical cavity. We predict the formation of\na hybrid Wannier-Mott-Frenkel exciton-polariton with an enhanced Rabi\nsplitting, exceeding that of the pure organic cavity by several tens of meV. To\nelucidate this phenomenon, we examine a cavity with 2D tungsten sulfide and a\ncyanine dye, where this enhancement corresponds to a $5\\%$ increase relative to\nthe organic cavity. The complementary characteristics of Wannier-Mott and\nFrenkel excitons enable the formation of tunable polariton states that merge\ninto a single hybrid state as a function of detuning, allowing for dual Rabi\nsplitting mechanisms. This provides a promising platform for exploring quantum\noptical phenomena in both the strong and ultrastrong coupling regimes.",

To address this fundamental\nissue, we propose Quantization Error Propagation (QEP), a general, lightweight,\nand scalable framework that enhances layer-wise PTQ by explicitly propagating\nquantization errors and compensating for accumulated errors. QEP also offers a\ntunable propagation mechanism that prevents overfitting and controls\ncomputational overhead, enabling the framework to adapt to various\narchitectures and resource budgets. Extensive experiments on several LLMs\ndemonstrate that QEP-enhanced layer-wise PTQ achieves substantially higher\naccuracy than existing methods.

However, due to the limited capacity of\ntraditional lightweight recommendation models, this one-step inference paradigm\noften leads to suboptimal performance. To tackle this issue, we present a novel\nslow thinking recommendation model, named STREAM-Rec. Our approach is capable\nof analyzing historical user behavior, generating a multi-step, deliberative\nreasoning process, and ultimately delivering personalized recommendations. In\nparticular, we focus on two key challenges: (1) identifying the suitable\nreasoning patterns in recommender systems, and (2) exploring how to effectively\nstimulate the reasoning capabilities of traditional recommenders. To this end,\nwe introduce a three-stage training framework. In the first stage, the model is\npretrained on large-scale user behavior data to learn behavior patterns and\ncapture long-range dependencies. In the second stage, we design an iterative\ninference algorithm to annotate suitable reasoning traces by progressively\nrefining the model predictions.

However, conflicting evidence between psychopathology\nand the ERN suggests that this phenomenon is modulated by variables are yet to\nbe identified. Socioeconomic status (SES) could potentially play a role in the\nrelationship between the ERN and psychopathological disorders, given that SES\nis known to be associated with depression and anxiety.

We measured error-related negativity (ERN) from a sample of\nadult participants from low to high socioeconomic backgrounds while controlling\ntheir depression scores. Results show that SES correlated with variations in\nERN amplitude. Specifically, we found that low-SES individuals had a larger ERN\nthan wealthier individuals. In addition, the relationship between depression\nand the ERN was fully accounted for by variations in SES. Overall, our results\nindicate that SES predicts neural responses to errors.

The BD-RIS comprises two phase\nreconfigurable antenna arrays interconnected by an array of tunable two-port\npower splitters. The two-port power splitter in each BD-RIS cell is built upon\na varactor in parallel with a bias inductor to exert tunable impedance\nvariations on transmission lines. Provided with variable reverse DC voltages,\nthe two-port power splitter can control the power ratio of S11 over S21 from\n-20 dB to 20 dB, thus allowing tunable power splitting. Each antenna is 2-bit\nphase reconfigurable with 200 MHz bandwidth at 2.4 GHz so that each cell of\nBD-RIS can also achieve independent reflection and transmission phase control.\nTo characterize and optimize the electromagnetic response of the proposed\nBD-RIS design, a Th\\'evenin equivalent model and corresponding analytical\nmethod is provided. A BD-RIS with 4 by 4 cells was also prototyped and tested.\nExperiments show that in reflection and transmission mode, the fabricated\nBD-RIS can realize beam steering in reflection and transmission space,\nrespectively. It is also verified that when operating in hybrid mode, the\nBD-RIS enables independent beam steering of the reflected and transmitted\nwaves. This work helps fill the gap between realizing practical hardware design\nand establishing an accurate physical model for the hybrid transmitting and\nreflecting BD-RIS, enabling hybrid transmitting and reflecting BD-RIS assisted\nwireless communications.",

    "abstract": "The possibility that muon-catalyzed nuclear fusion at ambient temperature\ntakes place in deuterated metals is analyzed theoretically. It is suggested\nthat the muon-catalyzed deuterium-deuterium (dd) or deuterium-tritium (dt)\nfusion rate, experimentally observed in liquid deuterium, increases in a PdD\ncrystal. The main reason is that, in the palladium crystal matrix, deuterium\ndiffuses in ionic (d+), rather than molecular (D2), form, thereby favoring the\nrate of (d$\\mu$d)+ formation. The slightly enhanced deuterium density and the\npossibly reduced muon sticking probability (compared to liquid hydrogen) point\nto an increase of the fusion-rate, unfortunately counterbalanced by the\nprobability of $\\mu^-$ capture by the Pd nucleus, whose value should be\nevaluated by a dedicated experiment. If this mechanism were possible, we\nadvance the hypothesis that 1989 cold fusion might have been randomly triggered\nby cosmic muons: an order-of-magnitude analysis shows that, under special\nconditions, a mW power per $\\mu^-$ might be produced. Moreover, recent\nexperimental results showing that neutrons can sustain deuterium fusion in\nout-of-equilibrium conditions might explain the remaining power generation.\nHowever, reliable quantitative figures are difficult to obtain theoretically,\nand an experiment is suggested, to be conducted at muon-beam sources, to verify\nor invalidate this idea.",

In the present paper it is\ndemonstrated that T-linear temperature dependence of electrical resistivity\narises naturally in the Q-ball gas phase, that may explain corresponding\nexperimental data in the \"strange metal\" phase of high-T$_c$ cuprates, as\nreviewed by Barisic et al. (2013). In the present theory it arises due to\nscattering of electrons on the Q-balls gas of condensed charge/spin\nfluctuations. Close to the lowest temperature boundary of the \"strange metal\"\nphase, at which Q-ball radius diverges, electrical resistivity caused by a\nslide of the Q-balls as a whole is calculated using fluctuation\nparaconductivity calculation method by Alex Abrikosov (1987). The diamagnetic\nresponse of Q-balls gas is calculated as well and shows good accord with\nexperimental data by L.Li et al. (2010) in the \"strange metal\" phase. In total,\nobtained results demonstrate different properties of the correlated electrons\nsystems that arise due to formation of Q-balls possessing internal bosonic\nfrequency $\\Omega=2\\pi nT$ in Matsubara time and, thus, forming the quantum\nthermodynamic time polycrystals. Presented theory may give a clue concerning a\npossible mechanism of the experimentally measured properties of high-T$_c$\ncuprates in the \"strange metal\" phase of their phase diagram. We believe ,\nthese results provide support to the quantum thermodynamic time crystal model\nof the Euclidean Q-balls considered in the present paper.",

One promising strategy for SDG is to leverage\nconsistent semantic shape priors across different imaging protocols, scanner\nvendors, and clinical sites. However, existing dictionary learning methods that\nencode shape priors often suffer from limited representational power with a\nsmall set of offline computed shape elements, or overfitting when the\ndictionary size grows. Moreover, they are not readily compatible with large\nfoundation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM). In this paper, we\npropose a novel Mixture-of-Shape-Experts (MoSE) framework that seamlessly\nintegrates the idea of mixture-of-experts (MoE) training into dictionary\nlearning to efficiently capture diverse and robust shape priors. Our method\nconceptualizes each dictionary atom as a shape expert, which specializes in\nencoding distinct semantic shape information. A gating network dynamically\nfuses these shape experts into a robust shape map, with sparse activation\nguided by SAM encoding to prevent overfitting. We further provide this shape\nmap as a prompt to SAM, utilizing the powerful generalization capability of SAM\nthrough bidirectional integration.

In this work, we\npropose GeoNav, a geospatially aware multimodal agent to enable long-range\nnavigation. GeoNav operates in three phases-landmark navigation, target search,\nand precise localization-mimicking human coarse-to-fine spatial strategies. To\nsupport such reasoning, it dynamically builds two different types of spatial\nmemory. The first is a global but schematic cognitive map, which fuses prior\ntextual geographic knowledge and embodied visual cues into a top-down,\nannotated form for fast navigation to the landmark region. The second is a\nlocal but delicate scene graph representing hierarchical spatial relationships\nbetween blocks, landmarks, and objects, which is used for definite target\nlocalization. On top of this structured representation, GeoNav employs a\nspatially aware, multimodal chain-of-thought prompting mechanism to enable\nmultimodal large language models with efficient and interpretable\ndecision-making across stages. On the CityNav urban navigation benchmark,\nGeoNav surpasses the current state-of-the-art by up to 12.53% in success rate\nand significantly improves navigation efficiency, even in hard-level tasks.\nAblation studies highlight the importance of each module, showcasing how\ngeospatial representations and coarse-to-fine reasoning enhance UAV navigation.",

    "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed significant progress in large language models'\n(LLMs) reasoning, which is largely due to the chain-of-thought (CoT)\napproaches, allowing models to generate intermediate reasoning steps before\nreaching the final answer. Building on these advances, state-of-the-art LLMs\nare instruction-tuned to provide long and detailed CoT pathways when responding\nto reasoning-related questions. However, human beings are naturally cognitive\nmisers and will prompt language models to give rather short responses, thus\nraising a significant conflict with CoT reasoning. In this paper, we delve into\nhow LLMs' reasoning performance changes when users provide short-path prompts.\nThe results and analysis reveal that language models can reason effectively and\nrobustly without explicit CoT prompts, while under short-path prompting, LLMs'\nreasoning ability drops significantly and becomes unstable, even on\ngrade-school problems. To address this issue, we propose two approaches: an\ninstruction-guided approach and a fine-tuning approach, both designed to\neffectively manage the conflict.

However, in practice, factors such as the\nfailure rates of storage devices can vary significantly over time, resulting in\nchanges to the optimal code parameters. To reduce storage cost while\nmaintaining efficiency, Maturana and Rashmi introduced a theoretical framework\nknown as code conversion, which enables dynamic adjustment of code parameters\naccording to device performance. In this paper, we focus exclusively on the\nbounds and constructions of generalized merge-convertible codes. First, we\nestablish a new lower bound on the access cost when the final code is an\n$(r,\\delta)$-LRC. This bound unifies and generalizes all previously known\nbounds for merge conversion, where the initial and final codes are either LRCs\nor MDS codes. We then construct a family of access-optimal MDS convertible\ncodes by leveraging subgroups of the automorphism group of a rational function\nfield. It is worth noting that our construction is also per-symbol read\naccess-optimal. Next, we further extend our MDS-based construction to design\naccess-optimal convertible codes for the conversion between $(r,\\delta)$-LRCs\nwith parameters that have not been previously reported. Finally, using the\nparity-check matrix approach, we present a construction of access-optimal\nconvertible codes that enable merge conversion from MDS codes to an\n$(r,\\delta)$-LRC. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first explicit\noptimal construction of code conversion between MDS codes and LRCs.

In addition to $\\alpha=1/2$, we\nfind that other rational wave vectors can also lead to the reentrant\nphenomenon. To investigate the underlying mechanisms of the reentrant\nlocalization transition, we vary the parameters of the composite potential and\nfind that the reentrant localization transition is sensitive to the phase\nfactor of the periodic component. By further studying the structure of the\nperiodic component, we confirm that this sensitivity arises from the periodic\nphase factor modulating the mirror symmetry. Finally, we map out a global phase\ndiagram and reveal that the reentrant localization transition originates from a\nparadoxical effect: increasing the amplitude of the periodic component enhances\nlocalization but simultaneously strengthens the mirror symmetry, which favors\nthe formation of extended states. Our numerical analysis suggests that the\ninterplay between these competing factors drives the reentrant localization\ntransition.",

However,\nin many real scenarios, the source tokens arrive in a streaming manner and\nsimultaneous machine translation (SiMT) is required, then the efficiency and\nperformance of decoder-only LLMs are significantly limited by their\nauto-regressive nature. To enable LLMs to achieve high-quality SiMT as\nefficiently as offline translation, we propose a novel paradigm that includes\nconstructing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data for SiMT, along with new\ntraining and inference strategies. To replicate the token input/output stream\nin SiMT, the source and target tokens are rearranged into an interleaved\nsequence, separated by special tokens according to varying latency\nrequirements. This enables powerful LLMs to learn read and write operations\nadaptively, based on varying latency prompts, while still maintaining efficient\nauto-regressive decoding. Experimental results show that, even with limited SFT\ndata, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across various SiMT\nbenchmarks, and preserves the original abilities of offline translation.\nMoreover, our approach generalizes well to document-level SiMT setting without\nrequiring specific fine-tuning, even beyond the offline translation model.",

Using classic lubrication theory and assuming isothermal,\nincompressible, and steady inertial flow, we present four fundamental methods\nfor deriving these expressions: the first is based on the momentum balance, the\nsecond on the total force balance in the channel, the third on a higher moment\nof the momentum balance combined with the continuity equation, and the fourth\non the mechanical energy of the flow. Additionally, we formally prove that the\nfirst and second methods yield identical expressions and highlight the\nsignificance of the exact analytical solution for the Oldroyd-B model along the\nchannel walls. For a Newtonian fluid at the creeping flow limit the first and\nsecond methods give the well-known result that the pressure gradient along the\nchannel equals the shear stress at the walls. The differences between the\nmethods and the outcomes are also presented and discussed. Additionally, we\nderive a new set of lubrication equations based on the streamfunction,\ntransformed coordinates that map the variable channel wall shape onto fixed\nones, and new components of the viscoelastic extra-stress tensor. This\nformulation facilitates a much easier implementation of the continuity\nequation, the total mass balance, and the total force balance in the system,\nensuring that non-physical or spurious solutions do not arise. Finally, we\npresent in detail a limiting nonlinear case by considering the Newtonian\ninertial flow in a linearly varying channel.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) achieve optimal utility when their responses are\ngrounded in external knowledge sources. However, real-world documents, such as\nannual reports, scientific papers, and clinical guidelines, frequently combine\nextensive narrative content with complex, hierarchically structured tables.\nWhile existing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems effectively\nintegrate LLMs' generative capabilities with external retrieval-based\ninformation, their performance significantly deteriorates when processing such\nheterogeneous text-table hierarchies. To address this limitation, we formalize\nthe task of Heterogeneous Document RAG, which requires joint retrieval and\nreasoning across textual and hierarchical tabular data. We propose MixRAG, a\nnovel three-stage framework: (i) hierarchy row-and-column-level (H-RCL)\nrepresentation that preserves hierarchical structure and heterogeneous\nrelationships, (ii) an ensemble retriever with LLM-based reranking for evidence\nalignment, and (iii) multi-step reasoning decomposition via a RECAP prompt\nstrategy. To bridge the gap in available data for this domain, we release a\nlarge-scale dataset, DocRAGLib, a 2k-document corpus paired with automatically\naligned text-table summaries and gold document annotations. The comprehensive\nexperimental results demonstrate that MixRAG boosts top-1 retrieval by 46% over\nstrong text-only, table-only, and naive-mixture baselines, establishing new\nstate-of-the-art performance for mixed-modality document grounding.",

To address these issues, we\npropose a novel two-stage feature learning framework named SD-ReID for AG-ReID,\nwhich takes advantage of the powerful understanding capacity of generative\nmodels, e.g., Stable Diffusion (SD), to generate view-specific features between\ndifferent viewpoints.

After\ninflation, whether the curvaton dominates the universe or not depends on its\nfield value when inflation ends. Since that value is stochastic, different\nregions of the universe undergo different post-inflationary histories.

While mental\nsimulation accurately captured human judgments in simpler scenarios, a linear\nheuristic model better matched human predictions when simulation time exceeded\na certain boundary.

While the innovative EmbodiedOcc framework utilizes\n3D semantic Gaussians for progressive indoor occupancy prediction, it overlooks\nthe geometric characteristics of indoor environments, which are primarily\ncharacterized by planar structures. This paper introduces EmbodiedOcc++,\nenhancing the original framework with two key innovations: a Geometry-guided\nRefinement Module (GRM) that constrains Gaussian updates through plane\nregularization, along with a Semantic-aware Uncertainty Sampler (SUS) that\nenables more effective updates in overlapping regions between consecutive\nframes. GRM regularizes the position update to align with surface normals. It\ndetermines the adaptive regularization weight using curvature-based and\ndepth-based constraints, allowing semantic Gaussians to align accurately with\nplanar surfaces while adapting in complex regions. To effectively improve\ngeometric consistency from different views, SUS adaptively selects proper\nGaussians to update. Comprehensive experiments on the EmbodiedOcc-ScanNet\nbenchmark demonstrate that EmbodiedOcc++ achieves state-of-the-art performance\nacross different settings. Our method demonstrates improved edge accuracy and\nretains more geometric details while ensuring computational efficiency, which\nis essential for online embodied perception.

This mixture retains a single\nshifted-median parameter for a unified regression link while selectively\nassigning extreme outcomes to the heavier-tail subdistribution. The cDW\ndistribution accommodates strictly positive data by setting the truncation\nlimit c=1 as well as full-range counts with c=0. We develop a Bayesian\nregression formulation and describe posterior inference using Markov chain\nMonte Carlo sampling. In an application to hospital length-of-stay data (with\nc=1, meaning the minimum possible stay is 1), the cDW model more effectively\ncaptures extreme stays and preserves the median-based link. Simulation-based\nresidual checks, leave-one-out cross-validation, and a Kullback-Leibler outlier\nassessment confirm that the cDW model provides a more robust fit than the\nsingle-component DW model, reducing the influence of outliers and improving\npredictive accuracy.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a Gegenbauer-based fractional approximation (GBFA)\nmethod for high-precision approximation of the left Riemann-Liouville\nfractional integral (RLFI). By using precomputable fractional-order shifted\nGegenbauer integration matrices (FSGIMs), the method achieves super-exponential\nconvergence for smooth functions, delivering near machine-precision accuracy\nwith minimal computational cost. Tunable shifted Gegenbauer (SG) parameters\nenable flexible optimization across diverse problems, while rigorous error\nanalysis verifies a fast reduction in approximation error when appropriate\nparameter choices are applied. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the GBFA\nmethod outperforms MATLAB's integral, MATHEMATICA's NIntegrate, and existing\ntechniques by up to two orders of magnitude in accuracy, with superior\nefficiency for varying fractional orders 0 < {\\alpha} < 1. Its adaptability and\nprecision make the GBFA method a transformative tool for fractional calculus,\nideal for modeling complex systems with memory and non-local behavior, where\nunderstanding underlying structures often benefits from recognizing inherent\nsymmetries or patterns.",

However, existing methods face a critical challenge: they simply skip\nupdating annotator-specific model parameters when encountering missing labels,\ni.e., a common scenario in real-world crowdsourced datasets where each\nannotator labels only small subsets of samples. This leads to inefficient data\nutilization and overfitting risks. To this end, we propose a novel\nsimilarity-weighted semi-supervised learning framework (SimLabel) that\nleverages inter-annotator similarities to generate weighted soft labels for\nmissing annotations, enabling the utilization of unannotated samples rather\nthan skipping them entirely. We further introduce a confidence-based iterative\nrefinement mechanism that combines maximum probability with entropy-based\nuncertainty to prioritize predicted high-quality pseudo-labels to impute\nmissing labels, jointly enhancing similarity estimation and model performance\nover time. For evaluation, we contribute a new multimodal multi-annotator\ndataset, AMER2, with high and more variable missing rates, reflecting\nreal-world annotation sparsity and enabling evaluation across different\nsparsity levels.",

Our work is motivated by\nthe possibility that the decaying vacuum is due to quantum field theory and\ndark matter originates from gravitationally induced matter creation. We delve\ndeeper into our investigation and explore both theoretical and statistical\nanalysis of the cosmological model to test its ability to describe the\nevolution of the Universe. To achieve this, we use three distinct combinations\nof datasets from CC, Pantheon SNIa sample, BAO, CMB distance priors and\n$f(z)\\sigma_8(z)$ datapoints to constrain the model parameters. Our statistical\nanalysis employs Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. The deceleration\nparameter shows that the model transitions from a decelerated phase to an\naccelerated phase of expansion. The current Hubble parameter values are\nestimated to be $H_0=67.517 \\pm 0.869$ km/s/Mpc, $H_0=67.534\\pm 0.874$\nkm/s/Mpc, and $H_0=67.533 \\pm 0.884$ km/s/Mpc using DS1, DS2 and DS3 datasets,\nrespectively. These values of $H_0$ are very close to those derived from the\nPlanck data. The effective equation of state parameter indicates an\naccelerating phase, with density parameter for vacuum energy exhibiting\nexpected values. We analyse the stability characteristics through the selection\ninformation criteria. We also perform thermodynamic analysis by studying the\nevolution of entropy in the Universe for the model and find it to be in\nagreement with the generalized second law of thermodynamics.

While the Gaia mission\nidentifies it as a black hole candidate, the absence of X-ray or radio\ndetections challenges that interpretation, and alternative exotic compact\nobjects such as boson stars have also been suggested. In this paper, we study\nwhether a boson star could account for the observed properties of the source.\nTo do so we compute the X-ray luminosity of the central dark object as a result\nof spherically symmetric (Bondi-Michel) accretion of matter, comparing our\nresults for the cases in which the dark object is a Schwarzschild black hole or\na non rotating boson star. Our model incorporates realistic interstellar medium\nproperties, ranging from hot ionized gas to dense molecular clouds. By solving\nthe governing equations numerically, we calculate mass accretion rates and\nderive the resulting Bremsstrahlung X-ray luminosities. Black holes and boson\nstars fundamentally differ by the absence of an event horizon in the latter,\nwhich directly impacts accretion dynamics as there is an accumulation of mass\nin regions closer to the boson star, which will significantly change the\nobserved X-ray emission. For the Gaia BH1 system we find that accretion onto a\nblack hole yields luminosities of $\\sim10^{27} \\ \\text{erg}\\, \\text{cm}^{-2}\\,\n\\text{s}^{-1}$ which corresponds to an X-ray flux undetectable by Chandra\nsensitivity. On the other hand, boson star accretion can produce observable\nluminosities in the order of $10^{27} \\ \\text{to} \\ 10^{41} \\ \\text{erg}\\,\n\\text{cm}^{-2}\\, \\text{s}^{-1}$.",

We demonstrate that when learning new\ninformation, LLMs exhibit a \"priming\" effect: learning a new fact can cause the\nmodel to inappropriately apply that knowledge in unrelated contexts. To\nsystematically study this phenomenon, we introduce \"Outlandish,\" a carefully\ncurated dataset of 1320 diverse text samples designed to probe how new\nknowledge permeates through an LLM's existing knowledge base. Using this\ndataset, we show that the degree of priming after learning new information can\nbe predicted by measuring the token probability of key words before learning.\nThis relationship holds robustly across different model architectures (PALM-2,\nGemma, Llama), sizes, and training stages. Finally, we develop two novel\ntechniques to modulate how new knowledge affects existing model behavior: (1) a\n``stepping-stone'' text augmentation strategy and (2) an ``ignore-k'' update\npruning method. These approaches reduce undesirable priming effects by 50-95\\%\nwhile preserving the model's ability to learn new information.

Previous attempts tackled this issue through\nthe use of auxiliary pretrained encoders or generative models on local clients,\nwhich invariably raise computational cost with increasing number modalities.\nUnlike these approaches, in this paper, we aim to address the task of unpaired\naudio and image recognition using \\texttt{FSSUAVL}, a single deep model\npretrained in FL with self-supervised contrastive learning (SSL).

    "abstract": "For large-scale multi-gateway LoRaWAN networks, this study proposes a\ncloud-edge collaborative resource allocation and decision-making method based\non edge intelligence, HEAT-LDL (HEAT-Local Distill Lyapunov), which realizes\ncollaborative decision-making between gateways and terminal nodes. HEAT-LDL\ncombines the Actor-Critic architecture and the Lyapunov optimization method to\nachieve intelligent downlink control and gateway load balancing. When the\nsignal quality is good, the network server uses the HEAT algorithm to schedule\nthe terminal nodes. To improve the efficiency of autonomous decision-making of\nterminal nodes, HEAT-LDL performs cloud-edge knowledge distillation on the HEAT\nteacher model on the terminal node side. When the downlink decision instruction\nis lost, the terminal node uses the student model and the edge decider based on\nprior knowledge and local history to make collaborative autonomous decisions.\nSimulation experiments show that compared with the optimal results of all\ncompared algorithms, HEAT-LDL improves the packet success rate and energy\nefficiency by 20.5% and 88.1%, respectively.",

    "abstract": "This work discusses a variational approach to determining the time evolution\noperator. We directly see a glimpse of how a generalization of the quantum\ngeometric tensor for unitary operators plays a central role in parameter\nevolution. We try the method with the simplest ansatz (a power series in a\ntime-independent Hamiltonian), which yields considerable improvements over a\nTaylor series. These improvements are because, unlike for a Taylor series of\n$\\exp(-iHt)$, time $t$ is not forced to appear in the same order as $H$, giving\nmore flexibility for the description. We demonstrate that our results can also\nbe employed to improve degenerate perturbation theory in a non-perturbative\nfashion. We concede that our approach described here is most useful for\nfinite-dimensional Hamiltonians. As a first example of applications to\nperturbation theory, we present AB bilayer graphene, which we downfolded to a\n2x2 model; our energy results considerably improve typical second-order\ndegenerate perturbation theory. We then demonstrate that the approach can also\nbe used to derive a non-perturbatively valid Heisenberg Hamiltonian. Here, the\napproach for a finite-size lattice yields excellent results. However, the\ncorrections are not ideal for the thermodynamic limit (they depend on the\nnumber of sites $N$). Nevertheless, the approach adds almost no additional\ntechnical complications over typical perturbative expansions of unitary\noperators, making it ready for deployment in physics questions. One should\nexpect considerably improved couplings for the degenerate perturbation theory\nof finite-size systems. More work is needed in the many-body case, and we\nsuggest a possible remedy to issues with the thermodynamic limit. Our work\nhints at how the appearance of mathematically beautiful concepts like quantum\ngeometry can indicate an opportunity to dig for approximations beyond typical\nperturbation theory",

    "abstract": "Ensuring structural reliability remains a core concern in civil engineering,\nyet the quantitative effects of quality control measures on material\nvariability and safety margins are not fully understood, especially for\nmaterials other than reinforced concrete. This study addresses this gap by\npresenting a probabilistic framework that integrates Bayesian updating,\nacceptance sampling, and operating characteristic (OC) curves to model\nconformity assessment as a probabilistic filter. In doing so, it refines prior\ndistributions of key material and execution parameters based on quality control\noutcomes, linking reductions in the coefficient of variation directly to\nadjustments in partial safety factors. Applying the framework to a masonry wall\nexample demonstrates how systematic quality control efforts, particularly those\ntargeting parameters with higher importance such as masonry unit strength and\nexecution quality-produce substantial gains in structural reliability. The\nanalysis shows that combined quality control measures can lower the partial\nsafety factor from a baseline of 1.5 to about 1.38, corresponding to an\nimprovement factor of roughly 1.09 and material savings of approximately 8%.\nConversely, controlling parameters with negligible influence, such as mortar\nproperties, provides limited benefit. These findings encourage focusing quality\ncontrol resources on the most influential parameters and integrating results\ninto semi-probabilistic design methods. By offering a transparent,\nstandards-compatible approach, the framework supports the refinement of design\nguidelines, promotes more efficient resource allocation, and enhances overall\nstructural safety in the built environment.",

    "abstract": "The use of Augmented Reality (AR) devices for surgical guidance has gained\nincreasing traction in the medical field. Traditional registration methods\noften rely on external fiducial markers to achieve high accuracy and real-time\nperformance. However, these markers introduce cumbersome calibration procedures\nand can be challenging to deploy in clinical settings. While commercial\nsolutions have attempted real-time markerless tracking using the native RGB\ncameras of AR devices, their accuracy remains questionable for medical\nguidance, primarily due to occlusions and significant outliers between the live\nsensor data and the preoperative target anatomy point cloud derived from MRI or\nCT scans. In this work, we present a markerless framework that relies only on\nthe depth sensor of AR devices and consists of two modules: a registration\nmodule for high-precision, outlier-robust target anatomy localization, and a\ntracking module for real-time pose estimation. The registration module\nintegrates depth sensor error correction, a human-in-the-loop region filtering\ntechnique, and a robust global alignment with curvature-aware feature sampling,\nfollowed by local ICP refinement, for markerless alignment of preoperative\nmodels with patient anatomy. The tracking module employs a fast and robust\nregistration algorithm that uses the initial pose from the registration module\nto estimate the target pose in real-time. We comprehensively evaluated the\nperformance of both modules through simulation and real-world measurements. The\nresults indicate that our markerless system achieves superior performance for\nregistration and comparable performance for tracking to industrial solutions.\nThe two-module design makes our system a one-stop solution for surgical\nprocedures where the target anatomy moves or stays static during surgery.",

    "abstract": "A discrete jet component (blob) ejection and its subsequent deceleration was\nobserved in the 2019/2020 outburst in the low-mass X-ray binary MAXI J1348-630.\nA first kinematic analysis of the deceleration due to an abrupt transition from\nan evacuated cavity to the interstellar medium suggested a kinetic energy\nexceeding 1046 erg, surpassing estimates of the available total ejection\nenergy. However, incorporating a transition layer with exponential density\ngrowth between the cavity and interstellar medium recently enabled a kinematic\nanalysis with much more realistic energy requirements of approximately\n$10^{44}$ erg. Here, we study the expected radiative signatures of electrons\naccelerated within the decelerating blob by introducing a model akin to the\nrelativistic blast wave model for gamma-ray bursts, considering radiative\nenergy losses and radiation drag, to simulate the deceleration of a\nrelativistically moving plasmoid. This model yields snap-shot spectral energy\ndistributions and multi-wavelength light curves from synchrotron and\nSynchrotron-Self-Compton (SSC) emission.

However,\nmulti-level FGL heterogeneity presents various client-server collaboration\nchallenges: (1) Model-level: The variation in clients for expected performance\nand scalability necessitates the deployment of heterogeneous models.\nUnfortunately, most FGL methods rigidly demand identical client models due to\nthe direct model weight aggregation on the server.

However, when employing the direct or standard method of\nperforming computations using infinitely smooth kernels, a conflict arises\nbetween the accuracy that can be theoretically attained and the numerical\nstability. In other words, when the shape parameter tends to zero, the\noperational matrix for the standard bases with infinitely smooth kernels become\nseverely ill-conditioned. This conflict can be managed applying hybrid kernels.\nThe hybrid kernels extend the approximation space and provide high flexibility\nto strike the best possible balance between accuracy and stability. In the\ncurrent study, an innovative approach using hybrid radial kernels (HRKs) is\nprovided to solve weakly singular Fredholm integral equations (WSFIEs) of the\nsecond kind in a meshless scheme. The approach employs hybrid kernels built on\ndispersed nodes as a basis within the discrete collocation technique. This\nmethod transforms the problem being studied into a linear system of algebraic\nequations. Also, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is utilized to\ncalculate the optimal parameters for the hybrid kernels, which is based on\nminimizing the maximum absolute error (MAE). We also study the error estimate\nof the suggested scheme. Lastly, we assess the accuracy and validity of the\nhybrid technique by carrying out various numerical experiments.

    "abstract": "Urban datasets such as citizen transportation modes often contain\ndisproportionately distributed classes, posing significant challenges to the\nclassification of under-represented samples using data-driven models. In the\nliterature, various resampling methods have been developed to create synthetic\ndata for minority classes (oversampling) or remove samples from majority\nclasses (undersampling) to alleviate class imbalance. However, oversampling\napproaches tend to overgeneralize minor classes that are closely clustered and\nneglect sparse regions which may contain crucial information. Conversely,\nundersampling methods potentially remove useful information on certain\nsubgroups. Hence, a resampling approach that takes the inherent distribution of\ndata into consideration is required to ensure appropriate synthetic data\ncreation. This study proposes an adaptive cluster-based synthetic minority\noversampling technique. Density-based spatial clustering is applied on minority\nclasses to identify subgroups based on their input features. The classes in\neach of these subgroups are then oversampled according to the ratio of data\npoints of their local cluster to the largest majority class. When used in\nconjunction with machine learning models such as random forest and extreme\ngradient boosting, this oversampling method results in significantly higher F1\nscores for the minority classes compared to other resampling techniques.

However, less attention has been given to the issue\nof inappropriate prior specification, which is the focus of this work. In\nconventional Bayesian modelling, there will often be a wide range of prior\ndistributions consistent with limited prior knowledge expressed by an expert.\nChoosing a single prior can lead to an inappropriate choice, possibly\nconflicting with the likelihood information. Robust Bayesian methods, where a\nclass of priors is considered instead of a single prior, can address this\nissue.

    "abstract": "Interest for studying cosmic neutrinos using deep-sea detectors has increase\nafter the discovery of a diffuse flux of cosmic neutrinos by the IceCube\ncollaboration and the possibility of wider multi-messenger studies with the\nobservations of gravitational waves. The ANTARES detector was the first\nneutrino telescope in seawater, operating successfully in the Mediterranean Sea\nfor more than a decade and a half. All challenges related to the operation in\nthe deep sea were accurately addressed by the collaboration. Deployment and\nconnection operations became smoother over time; data taking and constant\nre-calibration of the detector due to the variable environmental conditions\nwere fully automated. A wealth of results on the subject of astroparticle\nphysics, particle physics and multi-messenger astronomy have been obtained,\ndespite the relative modest size of the detector, paving the way to a new\ngeneration of larger undersea detectors. This review summarizes the efforts by\nthe ANTARES collaboration that made the possibility to operate neutrino\ntelescopes in seawater a reality and the results obtained in this endeavor.",

    "abstract": "We introduce CamMimic, an innovative algorithm tailored for dynamic video\nediting needs. It is designed to seamlessly transfer the camera motion observed\nin a given reference video onto any scene of the user's choice in a zero-shot\nmanner without requiring any additional data. Our algorithm achieves this using\na two-phase strategy by leveraging a text-to-video diffusion model. In the\nfirst phase, we develop a multi-concept learning method using a combination of\nLoRA layers and an orthogonality loss to capture and understand the underlying\nspatial-temporal characteristics of the reference video as well as the spatial\nfeatures of the user's desired scene. The second phase proposes a unique\nhomography-based refinement strategy to enhance the temporal and spatial\nalignment of the generated video. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method\nthrough experiments conducted on a dataset containing combinations of diverse\nscenes and reference videos containing a variety of camera motions. In the\nabsence of an established metric for assessing camera motion transfer between\nunrelated scenes, we propose CameraScore, a novel metric that utilizes\nhomography representations to measure camera motion similarity between the\nreference and generated videos. Extensive quantitative and qualitative\nevaluations demonstrate that our approach generates high-quality,\nmotion-enhanced videos. Additionally, a user study reveals that 70.31% of\nparticipants preferred our method for scene preservation, while 90.45% favored\nit for motion transfer. We hope this work lays the foundation for future\nadvancements in camera motion transfer across different scenes.",

The transmitted electrons are detected using a microchannel plate\n(MCP) with a phosphor screen. It is found that the transmission rate for the\ntransmitted electrons at the incident energy can reach up to 10% for an aligned\ncapillary in the beam direction, but drops to less than 1% when the tilt angle\nexceeds the geometrically allowable angle. The transmitted electrons with the\nincident energy do not move with changes in the tilt angle, so the incident\nelectrons are not guided in the insulating capillary, which is different from\nthe behavior of positive ions. In the final stage of transmission, the angular\ndistribution of the transmitted electrons within the geometrically allowable\nangle splits into two peaks along the observation angle perpendicular to the\ntilt angle. The time evolution of the transmitted complete angular distribution\nshows that when the beam is turned on, the transmission profile forms a single\npeak. As the incident charge and time accumulate, the transmission profile\nbegins to stretch in the plane perpendicular to the tilt angle and gradually\nsplits into two peaks. When the tilt angle of the nanocapillary exceeds the\ngeometrically allowable angle, this splitting tends to disappear. Simulation of\ncharge deposition in the capillary directly exposed to the beam indicates the\nformation of positive charge patches, which are not conducive to guiding,\nunlike positive ions. Based on the simulation results, we can explain our data\nand discuss the possible reasons for the splitting of the transmission angular\nprofiles.",

Many digital services and products either leverage or\nentirely rely on FOSS in their software stack. FOSS sustainability is a\nmultifaceted concept, and the impact of its decline on community products is\nless known. In this study, we sought to understand how the different aspects of\nFOSS sustainability impact software quality from a life-cycle perspective.\nSpecifically, we investigate whether and how support and incubation of FOSS\nprojects or bypassing incubation correlate with software quality outcomes. We\nselected 342 FOSS projects from the Apache Software Foundation that have either\ngraduated, retired, or bypassed their incubator program. We used 16\nsustainability metrics to examine their impact on eight software quality\nmetrics. Using Bayesian data analysis, we found that our selected\nsustainability metrics exhibit distinct relationships with software quality\nacross different project trajectories. Graduated projects showed the strongest\nsustainability-software quality (SWQ) relationship, both during and\npost-incubation. In contrast, retired projects showed weaker relationships,\ndespite receiving similar governance support. Bypassed projects, while not\noutperforming graduated ones, showed comparable sustainability-SWQ\nrelationships. While structured incubation strengthens sustainability and SWQ\nin graduated projects, retired projects struggle to maintain strong\nsustainability-SWQ relationships, indicating that additional factors internal\nand specific to projects influence sustainability. This effect was evident\namong bypassed projects; their self-reliant sustainability practices yielded\nstronger sustainability-SWQ compared to the retired ones.",

    "abstract": "Session-based recommendation (SBR) predicts the next item based on anonymous\nsessions. Traditional SBR explores user intents based on ID collaborations or\nauxiliary content. To further alleviate data sparsity and cold-start issues,\nrecent Multimodal SBR (MSBR) methods utilize simplistic pre-trained models for\nmodality learning but have limitations in semantic richness. Considering\nsemantic reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLM), we focus on the\nLLM-enhanced MSBR scenario in this paper, which leverages LLM cognition for\ncomprehensive multimodal representation generation, to enhance downstream MSBR.\nTackling this problem faces two challenges: i) how to obtain LLM cognition on\nboth transitional patterns and inherent multimodal knowledge, ii) how to align\nboth features into one unified LLM, minimize discrepancy while maximizing\nrepresentation utility. To this end, we propose a multimodal LLM-enhanced\nframework TPAD, which extends a distillation paradigm to decouple and align\ntransitional patterns for promoting MSBR. TPAD establishes parallel\nKnowledge-MLLM and Transfer-MLLM, where the former interprets item\nknowledge-reflected features and the latter extracts transition-aware features\nunderneath sessions. A transitional pattern alignment module harnessing mutual\ninformation estimation theory unites two MLLMs, alleviating distribution\ndiscrepancy and distilling transitional patterns into modal representations.\nExtensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of\nour framework.",

We study a single colloidal particle confined in a harmonic trap with\ntime-periodic stiffness that provides the engine protocol, in presence of a\nsteady linear shear flow. The nature of the flow (circular, elliptic or\nhyperbolic) is externally tunable. At long times, the work done by the flow\nfield is shown to dominate over the thermodynamic (Jarzynski) work done by the\ntrap, if there is an appreciable deviation from the circular flow. The work by\nthe time dependent trap is the sole contributor only for a perfectly circular\nflow. We also study an extended model, where a microscopic spinning particle\n(spinor) is tethered close to the colloidal particle, i.e. the working\nsubstance of the engine, such that the flow generated by the spinor influences\nthe dynamics of the colloidal particle. We simulate the system and explore the\ninfluence of such a flow on the thermodynamics of the engine.

    "abstract": "Improper configurations in software systems often create vulnerabilities,\nleaving them open to exploitation. Static architectures exacerbate this issue\nby allowing misconfigurations to persist, providing adversaries with\nopportunities to exploit them during attacks. To address this challenge, a\ndynamic proactive defense strategy known as Moving Target Defense (MTD) can be\napplied. MTD continually changes the attack surface of the system, thwarting\npotential threats. In the previous research, we developed a proof of concept\nfor a single-player MTD game model called RL-MTD, which utilizes Reinforcement\nLearning (RL) to generate dynamic secure configurations. While the model\nexhibited satisfactory performance in generating secure configurations, it\ngrappled with an unoptimized and sparse search space, leading to performance\nissues. To tackle this obstacle, this paper addresses the search space\noptimization problem by leveraging two bio-inspired search algorithms: Genetic\nAlgorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). Additionally, we extend\nour base RL-MTD model by integrating these algorithms, resulting in the\ncreation of PSO-RL andGA-RL. We compare the performance of three models: base\nRL-MTD, GA-RL, and PSO-RL, across four misconfigured SUTs in terms of\ngenerating the most secure configuration. Results show that the optimal search\nspace derived from both GA-RL and PSO-RL significantly enhances the performance\nof the base RL-MTD model compared to the version without optimized search\nspace. While both GA-RL and PSO-RL demonstrate effective search capabilities,\nPSO-RL slightly outperforms GA-RL for most SUTs. Overall, both algorithms excel\nin seeking an optimal search space which in turn improves the performance of\nthe model in generating optimal secure configuration.",

Extensive experimental results\ndemonstrate that GasEraser is effective across several leading open-source LMMs\non the GaslightingBench.

    "abstract": "Diffusion models are widely recognized for their ability to generate\nhigh-fidelity images. Despite the excellent performance and scalability of the\nDiffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture, it applies fixed compression across\ndifferent image regions during the diffusion process, disregarding the\nnaturally varying information densities present in these regions. However,\nlarge compression leads to limited local realism, while small compression\nincreases computational complexity and compromises global consistency,\nultimately impacting the quality of generated images. To address these\nlimitations, we propose dynamically compressing different image regions by\nrecognizing the importance of different regions, and introduce a novel\ntwo-stage framework designed to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of\nimage generation: (1) Dynamic VAE (DVAE) at first stage employs a hierarchical\nencoder to encode different image regions at different downsampling rates,\ntailored to their specific information densities, thereby providing more\naccurate and natural latent codes for the diffusion process. (2) Dynamic\nDiffusion Transformer (D$^2$iT) at second stage generates images by predicting\nmulti-grained noise, consisting of coarse-grained (less latent code in smooth\nregions) and fine-grained (more latent codes in detailed regions), through an\nnovel combination of the Dynamic Grain Transformer and the Dynamic Content\nTransformer. The strategy of combining rough prediction of noise with detailed\nregions correction achieves a unification of global consistency and local\nrealism.

    "abstract": "The present work explores the role of the dilaton charge $r_2$ and the plasma\nenvironment in explaining the observed images of M87* and Sgr A*. Dilaton\ncharges are associated with Kerr-Sen black holes, the stationary, axi-symmetric\nblack hole solution in the Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton-axion (EMDA) gravity which\narise in the low energy effective action of superstring theories. We\ninvestigate the impact of the background spacetime (here dilaton charge and\nspin) and the plasma environment in modifying the shape and size of the black\nhole shadow. The theoretically derived shadow is compared with the observed\nimages of M87* and Sgr A* which enables us to constrain the background\nspacetime in presence of the plasma environment. Our analysis reveals that the\nshadow of M87* favors the Kerr scenario and rules out $r_2>0.48$, while the\nshadow of Sgr A* exhibits a marginal preference towards the Kerr-Sen scenario\n(although GR is allowed within 1-$\\sigma$) and rules out $r_2>1$. Thus, large\nvalues of dilaton charge are disfavored for M87* and Sgr A* and this result\nholds good irrespective of the inhomogeneous plasma environment. In fact, the\npresence of plasma further constrains the allowed parameter space of $r_2$ and\nwithin the observed 1-$\\sigma$ interval, the present data cannot distinguish\nbetween the Kerr and the Kerr-Sen black holes with mild dilaton charges.\nMoreover, the shadows of M87* and Sgr A* rule out very dense inhomogeneous\nplasma environments surrounding these objects and hence, black holes with less\ndense plasma environments seem to be good sites to detect signatures of dilaton\ncharge. These findings not only underscore the importance of considering plasma\neffects in shadow related studies but also provide a pathway for refining\nconstraints on alternative gravitational theories using black hole\nobservations.",

    "abstract": "Understanding nanoscale electronic and thermal transport of two-dimensional\n(2D) electron systems in the quantum Hall regime, particularly in the bulk\ninsulating state, poses considerable challenges. One of the primary\ndifficulties arises from the presence of chiral edge channels, whose transport\nbehavior obscures the investigation of the insulating bulk. Using near-field\n(NF) optical and photocurrent (PC) nanoscopy, we probe real-space variations of\nthe optical and thermal dynamics of graphene in the quantum Hall regime without\nrelying on complex sample or electrode geometries. Near the charge neutrality\npoint (CNP), we detect strong optical and photothermal signals from resonant\ninter-Landau level (LL) magnetoexciton excitations between the 0th and +-1st\nLLs, which gradually weaken with increasing doping due to Pauli blocking.\nInterestingly, at higher doping levels and full integer LL fillings,\nphotothermal signals reappear across the entire sample over a ~10-micrometer\nscale, indicating unexpectedly long cooling lengths and nonlocal photothermal\nheating through the insulating bulk. This observation suggests thermal\nconductivity persists for the localized states even as electronic transport is\nsuppressed - a clear violation of the Wiedemann-Franz (WF) law. Our experiments\nprovide novel insights into nanoscale thermal and electronic transport in\nincompressible 2D gases, highlighting the roles of magnetoexcitons and chiral\nedge states in the thermo-optoelectric dynamics of Dirac quantum Hall state.",

While existing detection methods demonstrate\npromising results on benchmark datasets, they face critical limitations in\nreal-world applications. First, existing detectors typically fail to detect\nsemantic inconsistencies with the person's identity, such as implausible\nbehaviors or incompatible environmental contexts in given images. Second, these\nmethods rely heavily on low-level visual cues, making them effective for known\nforgeries but less reliable against new or unseen manipulation techniques. To\naddress these challenges, we present a novel personalized vision-language model\n(VLM) that integrates low-level visual artifact analysis and high-level\nsemantic inconsistency detection. Unlike previous VLM-based methods, our\napproach avoids resource-intensive supervised fine-tuning that often struggles\nto preserve distinct identity characteristics. Instead, we employ a lightweight\nmethod that dynamically encodes identity-specific information into specialized\nidentifier tokens. This design enables the model to learn distinct identity\ncharacteristics while maintaining robust generalization capabilities. We\nfurther enhance detection capabilities through a lightweight detection adapter\nthat extracts fine-grained information from shallow features of the vision\nencoder, preserving critical low-level evidence.

Despite the impressive progress, the research\nquestion regarding the safety vulnerability of LLM-empowered RecSys still\nremains largely under-investigated. Given the security and privacy concerns, it\nis more practical to focus on attacking the black-box RecSys, where attackers\ncan only observe the system's inputs and outputs. However, traditional attack\napproaches employing reinforcement learning (RL) agents are not effective for\nattacking LLM-empowered RecSys due to the limited capabilities in processing\ncomplex textual inputs, planning, and reasoning. On the other hand, LLMs\nprovide unprecedented opportunities to serve as attack agents to attack RecSys\nbecause of their impressive capability in simulating human-like decision-making\nprocesses. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel attack framework called\nCheatAgent by harnessing the human-like capabilities of LLMs, where an\nLLM-based agent is developed to attack LLM-Empowered RecSys. Specifically, our\nmethod first identifies the insertion position for maximum impact with minimal\ninput modification. After that, the LLM agent is designed to generate\nadversarial perturbations to insert at target positions. To further improve the\nquality of generated perturbations, we utilize the prompt tuning technique to\nimprove attacking strategies via feedback from the victim RecSys iteratively.\nExtensive experiments across three real-world datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our proposed attacking method.",

Cross-relaxation between NV and\nV$_\\mathrm{B}^-$ ensembles significantly reduces NV $T_1$, enabling\nquantitative nanoscale mapping of defect densities beyond the optical\ndiffraction limit and clear resolution of hyperfine splitting in isotopically\nenriched h$^{10}$B$^{15}$N.

We utilize Shannon's entropy to\ndetermine the optimal window size for data segmentation, ensuring each segment\ncaptures significant temporal patterns, and employ Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)\nto define graph edges based on segment similarity. A Graph Auto Encoder (GAE)\nwith a deep graph transformer encoder, decoder, and ensemble classifier is\ndeveloped to learn latent graph representations and classify faults across\nvarious categories. The GAE's performance is evaluated on the Case Western\nReserve University (CWRU) dataset, with cross-dataset generalization assessed\non the HUST dataset.

Depending on the\ndirection of eMF, the cDFT effective interactions between two LMNPs turn out to\nbecome more attractive or repulsive, which may play a critical role in ion\nseparation and nucleation processes.

We then find that the bending-compression/extension coupling generates\nlateral and rotational motion, which enhances the swimmer's manoeuvrability, as\nwell as changes in progressive velocity at a higher order of expansion, while\nthe coupling effects depend on the phase difference between the two modes.\nFinally, we demonstrate the importance of often-overlooked Lie bracket\ncontributions in computing net locomotion from a deformation gait. Our study\nsheds light on compression as a forgotten degree of freedom in swimmer\nlocomotion, with important implications for microswimmer hydrodynamics,\nincluding understanding of biological locomotion mechanisms and design of\nmicrorobots.",

    "abstract": "Environmental exposure to fluoride is a major public health concern,\nparticularly in regions with naturally elevated fluoride concentrations.\nAccurate modeling of fluoride-related health risks, such as dental fluorosis,\nrequires spatially aware learning frameworks capable of capturing both\ngeographic and semantic heterogeneity. In this work, we propose Spatially\nDirectional Dual-Attention Graph Attention Network (SDD-GAT), a novel spatial\ngraph neural network designed for fine-grained health risk prediction. SDD-GAT\nintroduces a dual-graph architecture that disentangles geographic proximity and\nattribute similarity, and incorporates a directional attention mechanism that\nexplicitly encodes spatial orientation and distance into the message passing\nprocess. To further enhance spatial coherence, we introduce a spatial\nsmoothness regularization term that enforces consistency in predictions across\nneighboring locations. We evaluate SDD-GAT on a large-scale dataset covering\nover 50,000 fluoride monitoring samples and fluorosis records across Guizhou\nProvince, China. Results show that SDD-GAT significantly outperforms\ntraditional models and state-of-the-art GNNs in both regression and\nclassification tasks, while also exhibiting improved spatial autocorrelation as\nmeasured by Moran's I.

Therefore, the adversarial strategy between\nconsumer electronic devices and DoS attackers is critical. This paper focuses\non the adversarial strategy between consumer electronic devices and DoS\nattackers in IoT-enabled RSE Systems. We first propose a remote joint\nestimation model for distributed measurements to effectively reduce consumer\nelectronic device workload and minimize data leakage risks. The Kalman filter\nis deployed on the remote estimator, and the DoS attacks with open-loop as well\nas closed-loop are considered. We further introduce advanced reinforcement\nlearning techniques, including centralized and distributed Minimax-DQN, to\naddress high-dimensional decision-making challenges in both open-loop and\nclosed-loop scenarios. Especially, the Q-network instead of the Q-table is used\nin the proposed approaches, which effectively solves the challenge of\nQ-learning. Moreover, the proposed distributed Minimax-DQN reduces the action\nspace to expedite the search for Nash Equilibrium (NE). The experimental\nresults validate that the proposed model can expeditiously restore the RSE\nerror covariance to a stable state in the presence of DoS attacks, exhibiting\nnotable attack robustness. The proposed centralized and distributed Minimax-DQN\neffectively resolves the NE in both open and closed-loop case, showcasing\nremarkable performance in terms of convergence.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with tasks that require a deep\nunderstanding of complex questions, especially when faced with long-range\ndependencies or multi-step reasoning. This work investigates the limitations of\ncurrent LLMs in question comprehension and identifies three insights: (1)\nrepeating question tokens improves comprehension by increasing attention to\nquestion regions, (2) increased backward dependencies negatively affect\nperformance due to unidirectional attentional constraints, and (3)\nrecalibrating attentional mechanisms to prioritize question-relevant regions\nimproves performance.\n  Based on these findings, we first propose a family of prompt-based strategies\n- Step-by-Step Reading (SSR), SSR+, and SSR++ - that guide LLMs to\nincrementally process question tokens and align their reasoning with the input\nstructure. These methods significantly improve performance, with SSR++\nachieving state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks: 96.66% on GSM8K,\n94.61% on ASDiv, and 76.28% on AQuA. Second, we introduce a training-free\nattention recalibration mechanism that dynamically adjusts attention\ndistributions during inference to emphasize question-relevant regions. This\nmethod improves the accuracy of LLaMA 3.1-8B on AQuA by 5.17% without changing\nmodel parameters or input prompts.\n  Taken together, our results highlight the importance of structured prompt\ndesign and attention optimization in improving LLM comprehension, providing\nlightweight yet effective tools for improving performance in various NLP tasks.",

While this\nmay sound identical to classical phase retrieval, wavefront estimation faces\nmore strict requirements regarding uniqueness as adaptive optics systems need a\nunique phase to compensate for the distorted wavefront. Existing real-time\nwavefront estimation methodologies are dominated by sensing via specialized\noptical hardware due to their high speed, but they often have a low spatial\nresolution. A computational method that can perform both fast and accurate\nwavefront estimation with a single measurement can improve resolution and bring\nnew applications such as real-time passive wavefront estimation, opening the\ndoor to a new generation of medical and defense applications.\n  In this paper, we tackle the wavefront estimation problem by observing that\nthe non-uniqueness is related to the geometry of the pupil shape.

    "abstract": "Despite the successes of language models, their evaluation remains a daunting\nchallenge for new and existing tasks. We consider the task of text\nsimplification, commonly used to improve information accessibility, where\nevaluation faces two major challenges. First, the data in existing benchmarks\nmight not reflect the capabilities of current language models on the task,\noften containing disfluent, incoherent, or simplistic examples. Second,\nexisting human ratings associated with the benchmarks often contain a high\ndegree of disagreement, resulting in inconsistent ratings; nevertheless,\nexisting metrics still have to show higher correlations with these imperfect\nratings. As a result, evaluation for the task is not reliable and does not\nreflect expected trends (e.g., more powerful models being assigned higher\nscores). We address these challenges for the task of text simplification\nthrough three contributions. First, we introduce SynthSimpliEval, a synthetic\nbenchmark for text simplification featuring simplified sentences generated by\nmodels of varying sizes. Through a pilot study, we show that human ratings on\nour benchmark exhibit high inter-annotator agreement and reflect the expected\ntrend: larger models produce higher-quality simplifications. Second, we show\nthat auto-evaluation with a panel of LLM judges (LLMs-as-a-jury) often suffices\nto obtain consistent ratings for the evaluation of text simplification. Third,\nwe demonstrate that existing learnable metrics for text simplification benefit\nfrom training on our LLMs-as-a-jury-rated synthetic data, closing the gap with\npure LLMs-as-a-jury for evaluation. Overall, through our case study on text\nsimplification, we show that a reliable evaluation requires higher quality test\ndata, which could be obtained through synthetic data and LLMs-as-a-jury\nratings.",

Using synthetic\ndatasets with controlled variations in noise levels, angles, lengths, widths,\nand colors, we analyzed the behavior of ViTs fine-tuned with LoRA. Our findings\nrevealed four key insights: First, ViTs exhibited an oblique effect showing the\nlowest angle prediction errors at 180 deg (horizontal) across all conditions.\nSecond, angle prediction errors varied by color. Errors were highest for bluish\nhues and lowest for yellowish ones. Additionally, clustering analysis of angle\nprediction errors showed that ViTs grouped colors in a way that aligned with\nhuman perceptual categories. In addition to orientation and color biases, we\nobserved phase transition phenomena. While two phase transitions occurred\nconsistently across all conditions, the training loss curves exhibited delayed\ntransitions when color was incorporated as an additional data attribute.\nFinally, we observed that attention heads in certain layers inherently develop\nspecialized capabilities, functioning as task-agnostic feature extractors\nregardless of the downstream task. These observations suggest that biases and\nproperties arise primarily from pre-training on the original dataset which\nshapes the model's foundational representations and the inherent architectural\nconstraints of the vision transformer, rather than being solely determined by\ndownstream data statistics.",

Our main technical contribution is the proof of a\nrate-immediacy tradeoff, which, in particular, implies that any tree code with\nconstant distance and non-trivial immediacy must necessarily have vanishing\nrate. By applying our rate-immediacy tradeoff to existing constructions, we\nestablish that their known rate analyses are essentially optimal. More broadly,\nour work highlights the need for fundamentally new ideas--beyond the recursive\nuse of error-correcting codes--to achieve substantial progress in explicitly\nconstructing asymptotically-good tree codes.",

    "abstract": "Humans are sensitive to suspicious coincidences when generalizing inductively\nover data, as they make assumptions as to how the data was sampled. This\nresults in smaller, more specific hypotheses being favored over more general\nones. For instance, when provided the set {Austin, Dallas, Houston}, one is\nmore likely to think that this is sampled from \"Texas Cities\" over \"US Cities\"\neven though both are compatible. Suspicious coincidence is strongly connected\nto pragmatic reasoning, and can serve as a testbed to analyze systems on their\nsensitivity towards the communicative goals of the task (i.e., figuring out the\ntrue category underlying the data). In this paper, we analyze whether\nsuspicious coincidence effects are reflected in language models' (LMs)\nbehavior. We do so in the context of two domains: 1) the number game, where\nhumans made judgments of whether a number (e.g., 4) fits a list of given\nnumbers (e.g., 16, 32, 2); and 2) by extending the number game setup to\nprominent cities. For both domains, the data is compatible with multiple\nhypotheses and we study which hypothesis is most consistent with the models'\nbehavior. On analyzing five models, we do not find strong evidence for\nsuspicious coincidences in LMs' zero-shot behavior. However, when provided\naccess to the hypotheses space via chain-of-thought or explicit prompting, LMs\nstart to show an effect resembling suspicious coincidences, sometimes even\nshowing effects consistent with humans. Our study suggests that inductive\nreasoning behavior in LMs can be enhanced with explicit access to the\nhypothesis landscape.",

    "abstract": "It was shown that light nuclei such as $^4$He, $^8$Be, and $^{12}$C can be\nwell described by RMF models, which enables a unified description for nuclei\nwith baryon numbers $A\\gtrsim4$. In this work, we propose a hybrid treatment\nfor investigating the clustering phenomenon in nuclear medium, where clusters\nranging from light nuclei (e.g., $^3$H, $^3$He, and $^4$He) to heavy ones\n(e.g., $^{12}$C, $^{16}$O, $^{40}$Ca, $^{48}$Ca, and $^{208}$Pb) can be treated\nin a unified manner. In particular, assuming a spherical Wigner-Seitz cell, the\nclusters are fixed by solving the Dirac equations imposing the\nDirichlet-Neumann boundary condition, while the nuclear medium are treated with\nThomas-Fermi approximation and take constant densities. In the presence of\nnuclear medium, the clusters eventually become unbound as density increases,\nwhile the root-mean-square charge radii increase. For clusters with different\nproton and neutron numbers $N_p \\neq N_n$, their binding energies varies with\nthe proton fraction of nuclear medium, which are less significant for clusters\nwith $N_p = N_n$. The uncertainties of density functionals on the clustering\nphenomenon are investigated as well adopting 8 different functionals. Based on\nthe obtained results, an analytical formula describing the binding energies of\nin-medium clusters is then obtained. The results presented in this work should\nbe useful to understand the clustering phenomenon in both heavy-ion collisions\nand neutron stars.",

    "abstract": "For effective image segmentation, it is crucial to employ constraints\ninformed by prior knowledge about the characteristics of the areas to be\nsegmented to yield favorable segmentation outcomes. However, the existing\nmethods have primarily focused on priors of specific properties or shapes,\nlacking consideration of the general global shape similarity from a Contour\nFlow (CF) perspective. Furthermore, naturally integrating this contour flow\nprior image segmentation model into the activation functions of deep\nconvolutional networks through mathematical methods is currently unexplored. In\nthis paper, we establish a concept of global shape similarity based on the\npremise that two shapes exhibit comparable contours. Furthermore, we\nmathematically derive a contour flow constraint that ensures the preservation\nof global shape similarity. We propose two implementations to integrate the\nconstraint with deep neural networks. Firstly, the constraint is converted to a\nshape loss, which can be seamlessly incorporated into the training phase for\nany learning-based segmentation framework. Secondly, we add the constraint into\na variational segmentation model and derive its iterative schemes for solution.\nThe scheme is then unrolled to get the architecture of the proposed CFSSnet.\nValidation experiments on diverse datasets are conducted on classic benchmark\ndeep network segmentation models. The results indicate a great improvement in\nsegmentation accuracy and shape similarity for the proposed shape loss,\nshowcasing the general adaptability of the proposed loss term regardless of\nspecific network architectures.

Accurate knowledge of this composition can\nincrease the usage of recycled material to produce steel, reducing the need for\nraw ore extraction and minimizing environmental impact by conserving natural\nresources and lowering carbon emissions. The study develops two models to\ndescribe the behavior of elements in the EAF or BOF process. A linear state\nspace model is used for elements transferring completely from scrap to steel,\nwhile a non-linear state space model is applied to elements moving into both\nsteel and slag. The Kalman filter and unscented Kalman filter are employed to\napproximate these models, respectively. Importantly, the models leverage only\ndata already collected as part of the standard production process, avoiding the\nneed for additional measurements that are often costly. This article outlines\nthe formulation of both models, the algorithms used, and discusses the\nhyperparameters involved. We provide practical suggestions on how to choose\nappropriate hyperparameters based on expert knowledge and historical data. The\nmodels are applied to real BOF data.
