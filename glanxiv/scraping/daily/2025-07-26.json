    "abstract": "To enhance our understanding of oxidation in high-entropy alloys, the early\nstages of oxidation on the surface of Al10Nb15Ta5Ti30Zr40 were studied using\ndensity functional theory and thermodynamic modeling. Surface slabs were\ngenerated from bulk configurations sampled from equilibrium using a multicell\nMonte Carlo method for phase prediction. The bulk structure was found to be a\nsingle BCC phase in good agreement with experimental observations. The oxygen\nadsorbed with a strong preference for sites with Ti and Zr and avoided sites\nwith Nb-Al and Nb-Ta. The surface was shown to be highly reactive to oxygen,\nyielding a dominating oxygen coverage of two monolayers over the temperature\nrange of 100 to 2600 K and an oxygen pressure range of 10-30 to 105 bar. Inward\noxygen diffusion at low coverage was preferred in regions rich with Zr but\nslowed with the addition of Ti and Al. Diffusion rates drastically decreased at\n1 ML, especially in the region rich with Ti and Zr, where strong metal-oxygen\nbonds were reported. Our results indicated that a high content of Ti and Zr\nincreased the reactivity of the HEA surface to oxygen. The presence of Nb also\nenhanced the resistance to oxygen adsorption, especially when partnered with Al\nand Ta. Inward oxygen diffusion was likely to occur at low coverage in regions\nrich with Zr but could be protected against with the addition of Al and Ti. The\nlimitations of the present work are discussed. This study may provide insights\nthat assist with devising short- and long-term mitigation strategies against\nmaterial degradation related to high-temperature oxidation.",

Chlorine adsorption onto the energetically favored (110) surface\nshowed preference to niobium which acted as a trapping sink on the top surface\nof the slab model.

Nickel, niobium, and tungsten\nresisted chlorine-induced dissolution from the surface model up to a 1/3\nmonolayer coverage of chlorine indicating that all constituents of this alloy\npossessed superior resistance to localized surface degradation such as\ncorrosive pitting.

Since its conception, the approach has been widely used in\napplications spanning various scientific fields. A series of extensions have\nbeen proposed over time, several of which address variable selection and\npenalized estimation, e.g., with an $\\ell_1$-penalty (LASSO). However, a\ntheoretical analysis of this popular approach in the context of Beta regression\nwith high-dimensional predictors is lacking. In this paper, we aim to close\nthis gap. A particular challenge arises from the non-convexity of the\nassociated negative log-likelihood, which we address by resorting to a\nframework for analyzing stationary points in a neighborhood of the target\nparameter. Leveraging this framework, we derive a non-asymptotic bound on the\n$\\ell_1$-error of such stationary points. In addition, we propose a debiasing\napproach to construct confidence intervals for the regression parameters. A\nproximal gradient algorithm is devised for optimizing the resulting penalized\nnegative log-likelihood function.

We propose an\nunsupervised method to debias the model's tendency to predict the EOS token\nprematurely.

Recent advances have\nshown that leveraging auxiliary datasets, such as those synthesized by\ngenerative models, can improve the accuracy of these value estimates.\nUnfortunately, such auxiliary datasets may also be biased, and existing methods\nfor using data augmentation for OPE in RL lack principled uncertainty\nquantification. In high stakes settings like healthcare, reliable uncertainty\nestimates are important for comparing policy value estimates. In this work, we\npropose two approaches to construct valid confidence intervals for OPE when\nusing data augmentation. The first provides a confidence interval over the\npolicy performance conditioned on a particular initial state $V^{\\pi}(s_0)$--\nsuch intervals are particularly important for human-centered applications. To\ndo so we introduce a new conformal prediction method for high dimensional state\nMDPs. Second, we consider the more common task of estimating the average policy\nperformance over many initial states; to do so we draw on ideas from doubly\nrobust estimation and prediction powered inference. Across simulators spanning\nrobotics, healthcare and inventory management, and a real healthcare dataset\nfrom MIMIC-IV, we find that our methods can use augmented data and still\nconsistently produce intervals that cover the ground truth values, unlike\npreviously proposed methods.",

Recent\npost-training methods achieve this by using small guidance models to modify\ntoken generation during inference. These methods typically optimize a reward\nfunction KL-regularized by the original LLM taken as the reference policy. A\ncritical limitation, however, is their dependence on a pre-trained reward\nmodel, which requires fitting to human preference feedback--a potentially\nunstable process. In contrast, we introduce PITA, a novel framework that\nintegrates preference feedback directly into the LLM's token generation,\neliminating the need for a reward model. PITA learns a small preference-based\nguidance policy to modify token probabilities at inference time without LLM\nfine-tuning, reducing computational cost and bypassing the pre-trained reward\nmodel dependency. The problem is framed as identifying an underlying preference\ndistribution, solved through stochastic search and iterative refinement of the\npreference-based guidance model. We evaluate PITA across diverse tasks,\nincluding mathematical reasoning and sentiment classification, demonstrating\nits effectiveness in aligning LLM outputs with user preferences.",

    "abstract": "This thesis develops a continuous scale measurement of similarity to\ndisinformation narratives that can serve to detect disinformation and capture\nthe nuanced, partial truths that are characteristic of it. To do so, two tools\nare developed and their methodologies are documented. The tracing tool takes\ntweets and a target narrative, rates the similarities of each to the target\nnarrative, and graphs it as a timeline. The second narrative synthesis tool\nclusters tweets above a similarity threshold and generates the dominant\nnarratives within each cluster. These tools are combined into a Tweet Narrative\nAnalysis Dashboard. The tracing tool is validated on the GLUE STS-B benchmark,\nand then the two tools are used to analyze two case studies for further\nempirical validation. The first case study uses the target narrative \"The 2020\nelection was stolen\" and analyzes a dataset of Donald Trump's tweets during\n2020. The second case study uses the target narrative, \"Transgender people are\nharmful to society\" and analyzes tens of thousands of tweets from the media\noutlets The New York Times, The Guardian, The Gateway Pundit, and Fox News.\nTogether, the empirical findings from these case studies demonstrate semantic\nsimilarity for nuanced disinformation detection, tracing, and characterization.\n  The tools developed in this thesis are hosted and can be accessed through the\npermission of the author.

By\nperforming computations directly on this 2D representation of the surface\nmanifold, it achieves significant computational efficiency gains compared to\nvolumetric simulation. Experiments with Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes\nequations (RANS) on the ShapeNet-Car and DrivAerNet-Car datasets show that our\nmethod achieves better accuracy and also reduces computational expenses in\nterms of both time and memory usage compared to existing machine learning\nmodels.

In general, if a divergent series can be fixed to converge\nin some way (it does not need to be by $\\lambda$-permutation), it is called a\n\"conditionally divergent series\".

This paper is devoted to partially answering this\nopen problem by considering a subset of $\\lambda$-permutation constraint by how\nwe can permute, named type R $\\lambda$-permutation.

This is because the\nmathematical design of certifiers is expressed at the neuron level, while their\nimplementations are optimized and executed at the tensor level. This mismatch\ncreates a semantic gap between design and implementation, making manual\nbridging both complex and expertise-intensive -- requiring deep knowledge in\nformal methods, high-performance computing, etc.\n  We propose a compiler framework that automatically translates neuron-level\nspecifications of DNN certifiers into tensor-based, layer-level\nimplementations. This is enabled by two key innovations: a novel stack-based\nintermediate representation (IR) and a shape analysis that infers the implicit\ntensor operations needed to simulate the neuron-level semantics. During\nlifting, the shape analysis creates tensors in the minimal shape required to\nperform the corresponding operations. The IR also enables domain-specific\noptimizations as rewrites. At runtime, the resulting tensor computations\nexhibit sparsity tied to the DNN architecture. This sparsity does not align\nwell with existing formats. To address this, we introduce g-BCSR, a\ndouble-compression format that represents tensors as collections of blocks of\nvarying sizes, each possibly internally sparse.\n  Using our compiler and g-BCSR, we make it easy to develop new certifiers and\nanalyze their utility across diverse DNNs.

    "abstract": "With its two stellar eclipses and two disk attenuations per binary orbit,\nV658 Carinae stands out as the first clear eclipsing Be + sdOB system. This\nrare alignment offers a unique opportunity to probe the structure and dynamics\nof a Be star disk with unprecedented detail. In this study, we present the most\ncomprehensive observational dataset and modeling effort for this system to\ndate, including optical, near-infrared, and ultraviolet spectroscopy,\nspace-based photometry, and optical polarization. Using a new ray-tracing code,\nwe apply a three-component model, consisting of an oblate, rapidly rotating Be\nstar, a symmetric circumstellar disk, and a compact stripped companion, to\nreproduce the system's light curve, polarization, and spectral features. Our\nanalysis yields precise constraints on the stellar and disk parameters,\ndetermining its status as the second known late-type Be + stripped star, and\nalso provides strong spectroscopic evidence for a tenuous circumsecondary\nenvelope. Despite the model's overall success, several key observables, such as\nthe $H_{\\alpha}$ equivalent width and the secondary attenuation, remain poorly\nreproduced, pointing to the need for more sophisticated modelling. In\nparticular, future improvements should incorporate the companion's radiative\nfeedback on the disk and account for asymmetric disk structures expected by the\ngravitational interaction with the companion. Owing to its unique geometry and\nrich diagnostics, V658 Car establishes itself as a benchmark system for Be\nstars (and rapid rotators in general), stripped stars, post-RLOF massive\nbinaries, and circumstellar disk structures.",

Using co-temporal full-disk coronal EUV images,\nmagnetograms, and continuum images from Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), we\nfound and tracked the emergence of 42 emerging single-BMR sigmoidal active\nregions (ARs) that have sunspots in both polarity domains.

As each AR emerges, it becomes either\nS-shaped (shows net right-handed magnetic twist) or Z-shaped (shows net\nleft-handed magnetic twist) in the coronal EUV images. Nineteen of the ARs\nbecome S-shaped and 23 become Z-shaped. For all 42 ARs, in agreement with\npublished MHD simulations of the emergence of a single-BMR sigmoidal AR from a\nsubsurface twisted flux rope, if the AR becomes S-shaped, the emerging BMR\npivots counterclockwise, and if the AR becomes Z-shaped, the emerging BMR\npivots clockwise.

    "abstract": "The performance of organic bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells is highly\nsensitive to both nanomorphology and energetic disorder arising from\nmicroscopic molecular packing and structural defects. However, most models used\nto understand these devices are either one-dimensional effective medium\napproximations that neglect spatial and energetic disorder or three-dimensional\nMonte Carlo simulations that are computationally intensive. In this work, we\npresent the results from a three-dimensional hybrid model capable of operating\nat both high carrier densities and incorporating the effects of energetic\ndisorder. We first generate realistic morphologies using a phase-field approach\nthat accounts for solvent evaporation during film formation. Using these\nexample morphologies, we systematically study the interplay between energetic\ndisorder and configurational disorder at carrier densities representative of\nreal device operation. This enables us to separate and visualize the impact of\nthe nanomorphology and energetic disorder on device performance. Our results\nreveal that, even when macroscopic percolation pathways remain intact,\nenergetic disorder limits performance primarily through suppressed charge\nextraction in interconnected domains. This suggest that optimizing molecular\npacking at the nanoscale is as critical as controlling phase separation at the\nmesoscale, highlighting the need for multiscale design strategies in\nnext-generation BHJ devices.",

Using daily stock data from the S&P 500 (2020-2024), we construct\ndependency networks via Vector Autoregression (VAR) and Forecast Error Variance\nDecomposition (FEVD), transforming influence relationships into a cost-based\nnetwork. Specifically, FEVD breaks down the VAR's forecast error variance to\nquantify how much each stock's shocks contribute to another's uncertainty\ninformation we invert to form influence-based edge weights in our network. By\napplying the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithm, we extract the core\ninter-stock structure and identify central stocks through degree centrality. A\ndynamic portfolio is constructed using the top-ranked stocks, with capital\nallocated based on Value at Risk (VaR). To refine stock selection, we\nincorporate forecasts from ARIMA and Neural Network Autoregressive (NNAR)\nmodels. Trading simulations over a one-year period demonstrate that the\nMST-based strategies outperform a buy-and-hold benchmark, with the tuned\nNNAR-enhanced strategy achieving a 63.74% return versus 18.00% for the\nbenchmark.

This is an instance of the classic\nbudgeted maximization problem, which admits an approximation scheme (FPTAS).\nNow assume the agent is performing these tasks on behalf of a principal, who is\nthe one to reap the rewards if the project succeeds. The principal must design\na contract to incentivize the agent. Is there still an approximation scheme? In\nthis work, our ultimate goal is an algorithm-to-contract transformation, which\ntransforms algorithms for combinatorial problems (like budgeted maximization)\nto tackle incentive constraints that arise in contract design. Our approach\ndiverges from previous works on combinatorial contract design by avoiding an\nassumption of black-box access to a demand oracle.\n  We first show how to \"lift\" the FPTAS for budgeted maximization to obtain the\nbest-possible multiplicative and additive FPTAS for the contract design\nproblem. We establish this through our \"local-global\" framework, in which the\n\"local\" step is to (approximately) solve a two-sided strengthened variant of\nthe demand problem. The \"global\" step then utilizes the local one to find the\napproximately optimal contract. We apply our framework to a host of\ncombinatorial constraints including multi-dimensional budgets, budgeted\nmatroid, and budgeted matching constraints. In all cases we achieve an\napproximation essentially matching the best approximation for the purely\nalgorithmic problem.

    "abstract": "Choice models predict which items users choose from presented options. In\nrecommendation settings, they can infer user preferences while countering\nexposure bias. In contrast with traditional univariate recommendation models,\nchoice models consider which competitors appeared with the chosen item. This\nability allows them to distinguish whether a user chose an item due to\npreference, i.e., they liked it; or competition, i.e., it was the best\navailable option. Each choice model assumes specific user behavior, e.g., the\nmultinomial logit model. However, it is currently unclear how accurately these\nassumptions capture actual user behavior, how wrong assumptions impact\ninference, and whether better models exist.\n  In this work, we propose the learned choice model for recommendation\n(LCM4Rec), a non-parametric method for estimating the choice model. By applying\nkernel density estimation, LCM4Rec infers the most likely error distribution\nthat describes the effect of inter-item cannibalization and thereby\ncharacterizes the users' choice model. Thus, it simultaneously infers what\nusers prefer and how they make choices. Our experimental results indicate that\nour method (i) can accurately recover the choice model underlying a dataset;\n(ii) provides robust user preference inference, in contrast with existing\nchoice models that are only effective when their assumptions match user\nbehavior; and (iii) is more resistant against exposure bias than existing\nchoice models. Thereby, we show that learning choice models, instead of\nassuming them, can produce more robust predictions.

    "abstract": "Ultrafast multistage electron transfer (ET) in molecular systems with\nmultiple redox centers is fundamental to photochemical energy conversion,\nincluding processes in natural photosynthesis, molecular optoelectronics, and\norganic photovoltaics. These systems often operate under nonequilibrium\nconditions, where solvent relaxation, intramolecular vibrations, and competing\nET pathways jointly determine reaction kinetics and product yields. In this\nchapter, we present a unified semiclassical framework for modeling ultrafast,\ncompetitive ET in multiredox compounds embedded in polar environments with\ncomplex relaxation dynamics. The approach constructs diabatic free energy\nsurfaces (FESs) in a multidimensional coordinate space that integrates both\npolarization and relaxation components of the environment within a unified\nrepresentation. Electron dynamics are described using a stochastic\npoint-transition method that captures the coupling between nonadiabatic quantum\ntransitions and classical nuclear motion. The formalism generalizes and unifies\nseveral established semiclassical models - including the Najbar-Tachiya,\nZusman-Beratan, and Sumi-Marcus approaches - and supports efficient simulation\nof multistage ET cascades. As an application, we investigate ultrafast charge\nseparation in donor-acceptor-acceptor (D-A1-A2) triads, showing how hot charge\nshift to a secondary acceptor can suppress nonequilibrium charge recombination.\nNumerical simulations reveal how reorganization energies, vibrational coupling,\nmolecular geometry, and bending angle collectively influence ET efficiency. The\nproposed framework offers a general and scalable tool for the rational design\nof photofunctional molecular systems.",

    "abstract": "As AI-driven dataspaces become integral to data sharing and collaborative\nanalytics, ensuring privacy, performance, and policy compliance presents\nsignificant challenges. This paper provides a comprehensive review of\nprivacy-preserving and policy-aware AI techniques, including Federated\nLearning, Differential Privacy, Trusted Execution Environments, Homomorphic\nEncryption, and Secure Multi-Party Computation, alongside strategies for\naligning AI with regulatory frameworks such as GDPR and the EU AI Act. We\npropose a novel taxonomy to classify these techniques based on privacy levels,\nperformance impacts, and compliance complexity, offering a clear framework for\npractitioners and researchers to navigate trade-offs. Key performance metrics\n-- latency, throughput, cost overhead, model utility, fairness, and\nexplainability -- are analyzed to highlight the multi-dimensional optimization\nrequired in dataspaces. The paper identifies critical research gaps, including\nthe lack of standardized privacy-performance KPIs, challenges in explainable AI\nfor federated ecosystems, and semantic policy enforcement amidst regulatory\nfragmentation. Future directions are outlined, proposing a conceptual framework\nfor policy-driven alignment, automated compliance validation, standardized\nbenchmarking, and integration with European initiatives like GAIA-X, IDS, and\nEclipse EDC. By synthesizing technical, ethical, and regulatory perspectives,\nthis work lays the groundwork for developing trustworthy, efficient, and\ncompliant AI systems in dataspaces, fostering innovation in secure and\nresponsible data-driven ecosystems.",

Previous MIT inverse problem studies have ignored skin\nand proximity effects inside coils in the forward method. In this article, the\nimproved technique incorporates these effects in the forward method.\nFurthermore, it employs the regularized Gauss-Newton algorithm to reconstruct\nthe conductivity distribution. The regularization parameter is obtained by an\nadaptive method using the two input parameters: a coefficient and an initial\nconductivity distribution.

This perspective framework\naims to create an interpretable AI system where users could examine,\nunderstand, and combine the different human preferences that influence AI\nresponses, detected through GRAPHYP's search experience networks. The goal of\nthis perspective is to envision AI systems that would not only provide answers\nbut also show users how those answers were reached, making artificial\nintelligence more transparent and trustworthy for human decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Construction throughout history typically assumes that its blueprints and\nbuilding blocks are pre-determined. However, recent work suggests that\nalternative approaches can enable new paradigms for structure formation.\nAleatory architectures, or those which rely on the properties of their granular\nbuilding blocks rather than pre-planned design or computation, have thus far\nrelied on human intervention for their creation. We imagine that robotic swarms\ncould be valuable to create such aleatory structures by manipulating and\nforming structures from entangled granular materials. To discover principles by\nwhich robotic systems can effectively manipulate soft matter, we develop a\nrobophysical model for interaction with geometrically cohesive granular media\ncomposed of u-shape particles. This robotic platform uses environmental signals\nto autonomously coordinate excavation, transport, and deposition of material.\nWe test the effect of substrate initial conditions by characterizing robot\nperformance in two different material compaction states and observe as much as\na 75% change in transported mass depending on initial substrate compressive\nloading. These discrepancies suggest the functional role that material\nproperties such as packing and cohesion/entanglement play in excavation and\nconstruction. To better understand these material properties, we develop an\napparatus for tensile testing of the geometrically cohesive substrates, which\nreveals how entangled material strength responds strongly to initial\ncompressive loading. These results explain the variation observed in robotic\nperformance and point to future directions for better understanding robotic\ninteraction mechanics with entangled materials.",

The proposed method uses a single\nsnapshot sample in which a single array of data is observed. The method is\nrooted in a weighted lifted-structured low-rank matrix recovery framework. The\nmethod involves four key steps: (i) lifting the antenna samples to form a\nlow-rank stature, then (ii) designing left and right weight matrices to reflect\nthe sample informativeness, (iii) estimating a noise-free uniform array output\nthrough completion of the weighted lifted samples, and (iv) obtaining the DOAs\nfrom the restored uniform linear array samples.\n  We study the complexity of steps (i) to (iii) above, where we analyze the\nrequired sample for the array interpolation of step (iii) for DOA estimation.\nWe demonstrate that the proposed choice of weight matrices achieves a\nnear-optimal sample complexity. This complexity aligns with the problem's\ndegree of freedom, equivalent to the number of DOAs adjusted for logarithmic\nfactors. Numerical evaluations show the proposed method's superiority against\nthe non-weighted counterpart and atomic norm minimization-based methods.\nNotably, our proposed method significantly improves, with approximately a 10 dB\nreduction in normalized mean-squared error over the non-weighted method at\nlow-noise conditions.",

Despite the progress, we are still far from the ultimate goal of\nfully automating legal tasks using artificial intelligence (AI) and natural\nlanguage processing (NLP).

    "abstract": "While naturalistic driving studies have become foundational for providing\nreal-world driver behaviour data, the existing frameworks for identifying risk\nbased on such data have two fundamental limitations: (i) they rely on\npredefined time windows and fixed thresholds to disentangle risky and normal\nepisodes of driving behaviour, and (ii) they assume stationary behavioural\ndistribution across drivers and trips. These limitations have hindered the\nability of the existing frameworks to capture behavioural nuances, adapt to\nindividual variability, or respond to stochastic fluctuations in driving\ncontexts. Thus, there is a need for a unified framework that jointly adapts\nrisk labels and model learning to per-driver behavioural dynamics, a gap this\nstudy aims to bridge. We present an adaptive and personalised risk detection\nframework, built on Belgian naturalistic driving data, integrating a rolling\ntime window with bi-level optimisation and dynamically calibrating both model\nhyperparameters and driver-specific risk thresholds at the same time. The\nframework was tested using two safety indicators, speed-weighted time headway\nand harsh driving events, and three models: Random Forest, XGBoost, and Deep\nNeural Network (DNN). Speed-weighted time headway yielded more stable and\ncontext-sensitive classifications than harsh-event counts. XGBoost maintained\nconsistent performance under changing thresholds, while the DNN excelled in\nearly-risk detection at lower thresholds but exhibited higher variability. The\nensemble calibration integrates model-specific thresholds and confidence scores\ninto a unified risk decision, balancing sensitivity and stability. Overall, the\nframework demonstrates the potential of adaptive and personalised risk\ndetection to enhance real-time safety feedback and support driver-specific\ninterventions within intelligent transport systems.",

Indeed, numerous studies have examined the\nmacroeconomic impact of power network interruptions, employing a wide variety\nof modeling methods and data parameterization techniques, which warrants\nfurther investigation. In this paper, we quantify the macroeconomic effects of\nthree significant natural hazard-induced US power outages: Hurricane Ian\n(2022), the 2021 Texas Blackouts, and Tropical Storm Isaias (2020). Our\nanalysis evaluates the sensitivity of three commonly used data parameterization\ntechniques (household interruptions, kWh lost, and satellite luminosity), along\nwith three static models (Leontief and Ghosh, critical input, and inoperability\nInput-Output). We find the mean domestic loss estimates to be US $\\$3.13$ Bn,\nUS $\\$4.18$ Bn, and US $\\$2.93$ Bn, respectively.

While the Perseus central part represents a canonical\ncool-core structure with clear signs of AGN Feedback, the outskirts, in turn,\nserve as a convincing example of a merger-perturbed system. X-ray data suggest\nthat IC310 is the main galaxy of a subcluster that merges with Perseus over the\npast $\\sim 4\\,{\\rm Gyr}$. Overall, this configuration resembles the merger\nbetween the Coma cluster and the NGC4839 group. It is statistically more likely\nto find a merging group near the apocenter of its orbit. Therefore, it is not\nsurprising that IC310 in Perseus has a relatively small velocity relative to\nthe main cluster, similarly to NGC4839 in Coma.\n  Perseus also hosts a high-velocity radio galaxy, NGC1265 (line-of-sight\nvelocity is almost twice the virial velocity of the main cluster), which is\nknown for its spectacular radio tail. Unless this galaxy has been accelerated\nby a time-variable potential associated with the merger, it has to move almost\nalong the line of sight through the entire cluster, which would be a rare, but\nnot a truly exceptional configuration. Both galaxies, IC310 and NGC1265, have\nremarkable radio tails with sharp bends that are reminiscent of a \"snake biting\nits tail\". We speculate that these curious shapes are natural consequences of\ntheir (different) orbits in Perseus. For IC310, the proximity to the apocenter\nand the reversal of its radial velocity might play a role. For NGC1265, the\nnearly line-of-sight motion coupled with the gas motions in the merging system\nmight be important.",

    "abstract": "With the evolution from 5G to 6G, ultra-reliable low-latency communication\n(URLLC) faces increasingly stringent performance requirements. Lower latency\nconstraints demand shorter channel coding lengths, which can severely degrade\ndecoding performance. The massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system\nis considered a crucial technology to address this challenge due to its\nabundant spatial degrees of freedom (DoF). While polar codes are theoretically\ncapacity-achieving in the limit of infinite code length, their practical\napplicability is limited by significant decoding latency. In this paper, we\nestablish a unified theoretical framework and propose a novel spatiotemporal\ntwo-dimensional (2-D) polar coding scheme for massive MIMO systems employing\nminimum mean square error (MMSE) receivers. The polar transform is jointly\napplied over both spatial and temporal dimensions to fully exploit the large\nspatial DoF. By leveraging the near-deterministic\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) property of MMSE detection, the\nspatial domain is modeled as a set of parallel Gaussian sub-channels. Within\nthis framework, we perform a theoretical analysis of the 2-D polarization\nbehavior using the Gaussian approximation method, and the capacity-achieving\nproperty of the proposed scheme is proved under finite blocklength constraints\nand large spatial DoF. Simulation results further demonstrate that, compared to\ntraditional time-domain polar codes, the proposed 2-D scheme can significantly\nreduce latency while guaranteeing reliability, or alternatively improve\nreliability under the same latency constraint -- offering a capacity-achieving\nand latency-efficient channel coding solution for massive MIMO systems in\nfuture 6G URLLC scenarios.",

In this paper,\nwe propose a dependability-theoretic framework for statistical\nquality-of-service (QoS) provisioning of FAS under finite blocklength (FBL)\nconstraints. Specifically, we derive new closed-form expressions for the\nlevel-crossing rate (LCR) and average fade duration (AFD) of an $N$-port FAS\nover Nakagami-$m$ fading channels. Leveraging these second-order statistics, we\ndefine two key dependability metrics such as mission reliability and mean\ntime-to-first-failure (MTTFF), to quantify the probability of uninterrupted\noperation over a defined mission duration. We further extend the classical\neffective capacity (EC) concept to incorporate mission reliability in the FBL\nregime, yielding a mission EC (mEC). To capture energy efficiency under bursty\ntraffic and latency constraints, we also develop the mission effective energy\nefficiency (mEEE) metric and formulate its maximization as a non-convex\nfractional optimization problem. This problem is then solved via a modified\nDinkelbach's method with an embedded line search.

Purpose: To develop and evaluate large language models\n(LLMs) that automatically extract PCL features from MRI/CT reports and assign\nrisk categories based on guidelines. Materials and Methods: We curated a\ntraining dataset of 6,000 abdominal MRI/CT reports (2005-2024) from 5,134\npatients that described PCLs. Labels were generated by GPT-4o using\nchain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to extract PCL and main pancreatic duct\nfeatures. Two open-source LLMs were fine-tuned using QLoRA on GPT-4o-generated\nCoT data. Features were mapped to risk categories per institutional guideline\nbased on the 2017 ACR White Paper. Evaluation was performed on 285 held-out\nhuman-annotated reports. Model outputs for 100 cases were independently\nreviewed by three radiologists. Feature extraction was evaluated using exact\nmatch accuracy, risk categorization with macro-averaged F1 score, and\nradiologist-model agreement with Fleiss' Kappa. Results: CoT fine-tuning\nimproved feature extraction accuracy for LLaMA (80% to 97%) and DeepSeek (79%\nto 98%), matching GPT-4o (97%). Risk categorization F1 scores also improved\n(LLaMA: 0.95; DeepSeek: 0.94), closely matching GPT-4o (0.97), with no\nstatistically significant differences. Radiologist inter-reader agreement was\nhigh (Fleiss' Kappa = 0.888) and showed no statistically significant difference\nwith the addition of DeepSeek-FT-CoT (Fleiss' Kappa = 0.893) or GPT-CoT\n(Fleiss' Kappa = 0.897), indicating that both models achieved agreement levels\non par with radiologists. Conclusion: Fine-tuned open-source LLMs with CoT\nsupervision enable accurate, interpretable, and efficient phenotyping for\nlarge-scale PCL research, achieving performance comparable to GPT-4o.",

    "abstract": "First-order optimization methods, such as SGD and Adam, are widely used for\ntraining large-scale deep neural networks due to their computational efficiency\nand robust performance. However, relying solely on gradient information, these\nmethods often struggle to navigate complex loss landscapes with flat regions,\nplateaus, and saddle points. Second-order methods, which use curvature\ninformation from the Hessian matrix, can address these challenges but are\ncomputationally infeasible for large models. The Dimer method, a first-order\ntechnique that constructs two closely spaced points to probe the local geometry\nof a potential energy surface, efficiently estimates curvature using only\ngradient information. Inspired by its use in molecular dynamics simulations for\nlocating saddle points, we propose Dimer-Enhanced Optimization (DEO), a novel\nframework to escape saddle points in neural network training. DEO adapts the\nDimer method to explore a broader region of the loss landscape, approximating\nthe Hessian's smallest eigenvector without computing the full matrix. By\nperiodically projecting the gradient onto the subspace orthogonal to the\nminimum curvature direction, DEO guides the optimizer away from saddle points\nand flat regions, enhancing training efficiency with non-stepwise updates.\nPreliminary experiments on a Transformer toy model show DEO achieves\ncompetitive performance compared to standard first-order methods, improving\nnavigation of complex loss landscapes.

We present a cut-cell method that\nis geometric-perturbation-robust (GPR) for the compressible two-material flows.\nBy construction, the scheme provably preserves exact interfacial pressure\nequilibrium in the presence of small interface-position errors. The key is a\nstrict consistency between the conserved variables and the geometric moments\n(i.e., the integrals of monomials) of every cut cell. We formulate auxiliary\ntransport equations, whose discrete solutions furnish evolved geometric moment,\nthese geometric moments remain perfectly synchronized with the conserved\nvariables -- even on a deforming mesh. Surpassing the classical geometric\nconservation law, our approach keeps all higher-order geometric moments\nconsistent, thereby eliminating accuracy loss due to geometric mismatches. To\nprevent the reconstruction step from destroying pressure equilibrium, we\nintroduce the notion of equilibrium-compatible (EC) reconstructions. A\ncarefully designed modification equips any conventional weighted essentially\nnon-oscillatory (WENO) reconstruction with the EC property; we detail a\nthird-order EC multi-resolution WENO (EC-MRWENO) variant. The tight coupling of\nEC-MRWENO with the evolved moments yields the first cut-cell solver that is\nsimultaneously provably GPR and genuinely high-order: it attains second-order\naccuracy precisely at material interfaces, while preserving third-order\naccuracy in smooth regions.

By focusing on the operating environment and its impact\non the observation process, we optimized the detector design and assessed its\nscientific potential. We explored the use of novel techniques to achieve the\nscience goals of the experiment. We assumed the orbit of a potential future\nmission at approximately 550 km altitude near the equatorial region with a\n20{\\deg} inclination. In such an orbit, the main background contributions for\nthis kind of detector are from different particles and radiation of cosmic\norigin and secondaries produced by their interaction in the Earth's atmospheric\nand geomagnetic environment. We studied the response of the detector in this\nbackground environment, using the Geant4 Monte Carlo simulation toolkit. We\nalso calculated other detector performance parameters to estimate its\nscientific capabilities. The detector effective area and efficiency are\ncalculated for low energy gamma-ray sources and used to estimate its\nsensitivity to short-duration transient sources. The calculation shows a better\neffective area and sensitivity by several factors compared to existing\ninstruments of similar type. A method is also developed and discussed to\nestimate the online transient-localization performance of the detector,\nsuggesting a better localization precision by about an order of magnitude than\nthose typically reported by existing gamma-ray monitors. We present here the\nsimulation study and results of an innovative detector design concept that can\nmake a significant contribution in the multi-messenger era.

Using the parsec scale\nradio images, we have classified the source morphology and identified the radio\ncore. Six of the twelve targets have core-jet morphology, four have two-sided\njet morphology, one has a complex morphology, and one is unresolved. We\ndescribe a methodology to test whether the emission from the core or the total\nemission detected in the VLBA image has sufficient flux density to cause the\nentire HI 21-cm absorption, and we estimate limits on the gas covering factor\nand velocity-integrated optical depth (VOD). We find that for seven of the\ntwelve sources, the core has sufficient flux density to cause all the HI 21-cm\nabsorption detected in the ASKAP spectrum. For three other targets, with\nprojected sizes in the range $\\rm 305-409 \\ pc$, a large fraction of the entire\nemission in the VLBA map could be occulted by the gas. For 0903+010 (NVSS\nJ090331+010846), we estimate that at least $\\approx 73\\%$ of the peak\nabsorption detected in the ASKAP spectrum could arise against the emission\ndetected in the VLBA image.

Our\napproach shifts the trace processing workload from the developer's machine to\nthe cloud, using a dedicated tracing component that captures trace data and\nforwards it to a scalable backend via WebSockets and Apache Kafka. This enables\nlong-term monitoring and collaborative analysis of target executions, e.g., to\ndetect and investigate sporadic errors.

Existing automated logging techniques focus on isolated\nsub-tasks - predicting a single log position, level, or message - and therefore\ncannot produce complete, high-quality log statements that reflect real-world\npractice in which multiple logs often appear inside one method. They also\nneglect deeper semantic dependencies among methods and consider only a narrow\nset of candidate variables, leading to superficial or incomplete logs. In this\npaper, we present PDLogger, the first end-to-end log generation technique\nexpressly designed for practical, multi-log scenarios. PDLogger operates in\nthree phases. (1) Log position prediction: block-type-aware structured prompts\nguide a large language model (LLM) to suggest candidate positions across all\ncontrol-flow blocks of a method. (2) Log generation: backward program slicing\nsupplies precise inter-procedural control and data-dependency context, while an\nexpanded variable extractor captures both member and external function\nexpressions; the enriched prompt enables the LLM to emit a full log statement\n(position, level, message, variables). (3) Log refinement: level correction and\ncontext-sensitive deduplication prune false positives and redundant logs. We\nevaluate PDLogger on 3,113 log statements drawn from two widely used Java\nprojects. Compared with the strongest prior systems, PDLogger improves\nlog-position precision by 139.0 percent, F1 by 69.2 percent, level accuracy by\n82.3 percent, variable precision by 131.8 percent, and message quality\n(BERTScore) by 65.7 percent.

In WBP, the Tanner graph of the code is unrolled with respect to\nthe iterations of the belief propagation decoder. Then, weights are assigned to\nthe edges of the resulting recurrent network and optimized offline using a\ntraining dataset. The main contribution of this paper is an adaptive WBP where\nthe weights of the decoder are determined for each received word. Two variants\nof this decoder are investigated. In the parallel WBP decoders, the weights\ntake values in a discrete set. A number of WBP decoders are run in parallel to\nsearch for the best sequence of weights in real time. In the two-stage decoder,\na small neural network is used to dynamically determine the weights of the WBP\ndecoder for each received word. The proposed adaptive decoders demonstrate\nsignificant improvements over the static counterparts in two applications. In\nthe first application, Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem, polar and quasi-cyclic\nlow-density parity-check (QC-LDPC) codes are used over an additive white\nGaussian noise channel. The results indicate that the adaptive WBP achieves bit\nerror rates (BERs) up to an order of magnitude less than the BERs of the static\nWBP at about the same decoding complexity, depending on the code, its rate, and\nthe signal-to-noise ratio. The second application is a concatenated code\ndesigned for a long-haul nonlinear optical fiber channel where the inner code\nis a QC-LDPC code and the outer code is a spatially coupled LDPC code. In this\ncase, the inner code is decoded using an adaptive WBP, while the outer code is\ndecoded using the sliding window decoder and static belief propagation. The\nresults show that the adaptive WBP provides a coding gain of 0.8 dB compared to\nthe neural normalized min-sum decoder, with about the same computational\ncomplexity and decoding latency.",

By analyzing various non-Markovian models, where\npast behavior directly influences future dynamics, we uncover new mechanisms\nand universal patterns in space exploration.\n  In the first part, we study Locally Activated Random Walks (LARWs), where\nmotion depends on the time spent at visited sites. These walks, though simply\ndefined, display rich behaviors such as dynamical trapping, aging, and\nnon-Gaussian diffusion. We identify confinement criteria, reveal a dynamical\nphase transition, and derive exact analytical results in several regimes.\n  The second part focuses on Self-Interacting Random Walks (SIRWs), where the\nwalker's own history governs future steps. Using advanced probabilistic tools,\nespecially Ray-Knight theory, we compute exact results for observables such as\nsplitting probabilities, persistence, first-passage times, number of visited\nsites, and aging effects. This includes the first exact expressions for aged\nobservables in the saturating Self-Attracting Walk (SATW) model.\n  In the third part, we propose a unified framework to describe memory effects\nin space exploration, based on the walker's tendency to reverse direction over\ntime. This approach reveals robust patterns across a wide class of\nnon-Markovian models, including fractional Brownian motion and the strongly\nself-interacting True Self-Avoiding Walk (TSAW), where we derive the first\nexact result for an aged observable in a non-saturating system.\n  Together, these results show that memory-driven systems, though complex, can\nexhibit universal structures.

    "abstract": "Medical image segmentation plays an important role in computer-aided\ndiagnosis. Traditional convolution-based U-shape segmentation architectures are\nusually limited by the local receptive field. Existing vision transformers have\nbeen widely applied to diverse medical segmentation frameworks due to their\nsuperior capabilities of capturing global contexts. Despite the advantage, the\nreal-world application of vision transformers is challenged by their non-linear\nself-attention mechanism, requiring huge computational costs. To address this\nissue, the selective state space model (SSM) Mamba has gained recognition for\nits adeptness in modeling long-range dependencies in sequential data,\nparticularly noted for its efficient memory costs. In this paper, we propose\nMambaVesselNet++, a Hybrid CNN-Mamba framework for medical image segmentation.\nOur MambaVesselNet++ is comprised of a hybrid image encoder (Hi-Encoder) and a\nbifocal fusion decoder (BF-Decoder). In Hi-Encoder, we first devise the\ntexture-aware layer to capture low-level semantic features by leveraging\nconvolutions. Then, we utilize Mamba to effectively model long-range\ndependencies with linear complexity. The Bi-Decoder adopts skip connections to\ncombine local and global information of the Hi-Encoder for the accurate\ngeneration of segmentation masks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nMambaVesselNet++ outperforms current convolution-based, transformer-based, and\nMamba-based state-of-the-arts across diverse medical 2D, 3D, and instance\nsegmentation tasks.

The rise of large language models provides\nsignificant potential for social network simulations to capture attitude\ndynamics and reproduce collective behaviors.

To address this gap, we introduce DynamiX, a novel\nlarge-scale social network simulator dedicated to dynamic social network\nmodeling. DynamiX uses a dynamic hierarchy module for selecting core agents\nwith key characteristics at each timestep, enabling accurate alignment of\nreal-world adaptive switching of user roles. Furthermore, we design distinct\ndynamic social relationship modeling strategies for different user types. For\nopinion leaders, we propose an information-stream-based link prediction method\nrecommending potential users with similar stances, simulating homogeneous\nconnections, and autonomous behavior decisions. For ordinary users, we\nconstruct an inequality-oriented behavior decision-making module, effectively\naddressing unequal social interactions and capturing the patterns of\nrelationship adjustments driven by multi-dimensional factors. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that DynamiX exhibits marked improvements in attitude\nevolution simulation and collective behavior analysis compared to static\nnetworks.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) scheme for\nmaintaining a spacecraft within a specified family of periodic orbits near the\nlibration points in cislunar space.

The Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem (CR3BP) is used to model\nthe system dynamics. First, the Pseudo-Arclength Continuation (PAC) method is\nemployed to compute the members of each orbit family. Then, the state of each\nmember is parameterized by two variables: one defining the orbit and the other\nspecifying the location along it. These computed states are then fit to a\nMultivariate Polynomial Regression (MPR) model. An NMPC framework is developed\nto generate the optimal reference trajectory and compute the corresponding\nvelocity impulses for trajectory tracking. The control system is integrated\nwith a Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) observer that estimates the spacecraft's\nrelative state. Numerical simulations are conducted for Lyapunov, halo, and\nnear-rectilinear halo orbits near L1 and L2.

Sorting-based algorithms excel with small kernels\nbut scale poorly with increasing kernel diameter, in contrast to constant-time\nmethods characterized by higher constant factors but better scalability, such\nas histogram-based approaches or the 2D wavelet matrix.\n  This paper introduces a novel algorithm, leveraging the separability of the\nsorting problem through hierarchical tiling to minimize redundant computations.\nWe propose two variants: a data-oblivious selection network that can operate\nentirely within registers, and a data-aware version utilizing random-access\nmemory.

These structures are caused by refractive scattering and are\nseparated by Airy minima. Their importance stems from their close relationship\nto the interaction potential between two $^{12}$C nuclei, which also describes\nthe molecular resonances of the compound system at lower energies. Although a\nunique deep potential was usually determined from rainbow scattering at higher\nenergies, a puzzling discrepancy persisted: the energy at which the Airy\nminimum $A1$ crosses 90$^\\circ$ was $E_{c.m.}\\approx$67 MeV for\n$^{12}$C+$^{12}$C.

This question\nremained unanswered until the discovery of the secondary rainbow in the\n$^{12}$C+$^{12}$C system. We report for the first time that the highest energy\nat which the dynamically generated Airy minimum of the secondary rainbow\ncrosses 90$^\\circ$ is about 100 MeV.

However, these\nsystems are limited by relatively short baselines, atmospheric distortions\nrequiring extensive calibration, and reduced visibility availability due to\nEarth rotation. This research proposes a complementary deep space navigation\napproach using space based interferometry, in which radio signals from the\nspacecraft are received and cross correlated onboard Geostationary Earth Orbit\n(GEO) satellites. By replacing terrestrial VLBI stations with dual GEO\nplatforms, the method significantly extends the effective baseline, removes\natmospheric phase errors, and provides almost continuous visibility to deep\nspace targets. Unlike Earth based systems, GEO based interferometry maintains\npersistent station mutual visibility, enabling higher measurement availability\nand more flexible mission support. A complete system model is presented,\nincluding the principles of dual frequency phase based angular tracking and a\nstructured error budget analysis. Theoretical results show that the GEO based\nsystem achieves a total angular error of approximately 3.73 nanoradians, within\nthe same order of magnitude as terrestrial VLBI.

The PTC is implemented\nwith an array of time-periodically modulated LC resonators at microwave\nfrequencies. Broadband white noise probes the system and reveals an LDOS\nlineshape that decomposes into absorptive and dispersive Lorentzian components\nnear the momentum gap frequency. The finite peak amplitude, which grows with\nmodulation strength, shows that the spontaneous emission rate is maximized at\nthe gap frequency. All observed features agree with classical non-Hermitian\nFloquet theory. When modulation-induced gain exceeds losses, the PTC\ntransitions to a narrow-band lasing oscillation state. These findings open a\nroute to nonequilibrium photonics and bring time-periodic LDOS engineering\ncloser to practical realization.",

    "abstract": "We put forward a new Bayesian modeling strategy for spatiotemporal count data\nthat enables efficient posterior sampling. Most previous models for such data\ndecompose logarithms of the response Poisson rates into fixed effects and\nspatial random effects, where the latter is typically assumed to follow a\nlatent Gaussian process, the conditional autoregressive model, or the intrinsic\nconditional autoregressive model. Since log-Gaussian is not conjugate to\nPoisson, such implementations must resort to either approximation methods like\nINLA or Metropolis moves on latent states in MCMC algorithms for model fitting\nand exhibit several approximation and posterior sampling challenges. Instead of\nmodeling logarithms of spatiotemporal frailties jointly as a Gaussian process,\nwe construct a spatiotemporal autoregressive gamma process guaranteed\nstationary across the time dimension. We decompose latent Poisson variables to\npermit fully conjugate Gibbs sampling of spatiotemporal frailties and design a\nsparse spatial dependence structure to get a linear computational complexity\nthat facilitates efficient posterior computation. Our model permits convenient\nBayesian predictive machinery based on posterior samples that delivers\nsatisfactory performance in predicting at new spatial locations and time\nintervals.

This paper\ninvestigates the system design for energy-saving unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)\nformations in dual-functional LAWNs, where a ground base station (GBS)\nsimultaneously wirelessly controls multiple UAV formations and performs sensing\ntasks. To enhance flight endurance, we exploit the aerodynamic upwash effects\nand propose a distributed energy-saving formation framework based on the\nadapt-then-combine (ATC) diffusion least mean square (LMS) algorithm.\nSpecifically, each UAV updates the local position estimate by invoking the LMS\nalgorithm, followed by refining it through cooperative information exchange\nwith neighbors. This enables an optimized aerodynamic structure that minimizes\nthe formation's overall energy consumption. To ensure control stability and\nfairness, we formulate a maximum linear quadratic regulator (LQR) minimization\nproblem, which is subject to both the available power budget and the required\nsensing beam pattern gain. To address this non-convex problem, we develop a\ntwo-step approach by first deriving a closed-form expression of LQR as a\nfunction of arbitrary beamformers. Subsequently, an efficient iterative\nalgorithm that integrates successive convex approximation (SCA) and\nsemidefinite relaxation (SDR) techniques is proposed to obtain a sub-optimal\ndual-functional beamforming solution.

Various KV cache compression techniques,\nincluding token eviction, quantization, and low-rank projection, have been\nproposed to mitigate this bottleneck, often complementing each other.

To further explore the field of backdoor attacks\nagainst semantic segmentation, in this paper, we propose a simple yet effective\nbackdoor attack called Contextual Segmentation Backdoor Attack (ConSeg). ConSeg\nleverages the contextual information inherent in semantic segmentation models\nto enhance backdoor performance. Our method is motivated by an intriguing\nobservation, i.e., when the target class is set as the `co-occurring' class of\nthe victim class, the victim class can be more easily `mis-segmented'. Building\nupon this insight, ConSeg mimics the contextual information of the target class\nand rebuilds it in the victim region to establish the contextual relationship\nbetween the target class and the victim class, making the attack easier. Our\nexperiments reveal that ConSeg achieves improvements in Attack Success Rate\n(ASR) with increases of 15.55\\%, compared to existing methods, while exhibiting\nresilience against state-of-the-art backdoor defenses.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present the Tokenized Sovereign Debt Conversion Mechanism\n(TSDCM), a smart-contracted instrument that, upon meeting both debt-to-GDP and\nGDP-growth thresholds, automates the retirement of sovereign debt. TSDCM\ninitiates the conversion of a portion of outstanding bonds into\nperformance-linked tokens by integrating a two-state regime-switching\njump-diffusion framework into decentralized protocols. We prove finite-time\nactivation and expected debt reduction through new propositions, establish the\nexistence and uniqueness of the underlying stochastic processes, and introduce\na main theorem that ensures a strict decline in expected debt levels. With\nsignificant tail-risk mitigation, calibration using IMF data and MATLAB Monte\nCarlo simulations shows a 20-25% decrease in expected debt-to-GDP ratios over a\nten-year period. A transparent and incentive-aligned route to sustainable\nsovereign debt management is provided by TSDCM.",

We\ndescribe the architecture and design of these agents and their communication,\nand provide implementation details including prompt strategies and workflow\norchestration. A case study illustrates AgentMesh handling a non-trivial\ndevelopment request via sequential task planning, code generation, iterative\ndebugging, and final code review.

    "abstract": "This study develops a conceptual simulation model for a tokenized recycling\nincentive system that integrates blockchain infrastructure, market-driven\npricing, behavioral economics, and carbon credit mechanisms. The model aims to\naddress the limitations of traditional recycling systems, which often rely on\nstatic government subsidies and fail to generate sustained public\nparticipation. By introducing dynamic token values linked to real-world supply\nand demand conditions, as well as incorporating non-monetary behavioral drivers\n(e.g., social norms, reputational incentives), the framework creates a\ndual-incentive structure that can adapt over time. The model uses Monte Carlo\nsimulations to estimate outcomes under a range of scenarios involving\noperational costs, carbon pricing, token volatility, and behavioral adoption\nrates. Due to the absence of real-world implementations of such integrated\nblockchain-based recycling systems, the paper remains theoretical and\nsimulation-based. It is intended as a prototype framework for future policy\nexperimentation and pilot projects. The model provides insights for\npolicymakers, urban planners, and technology developers aiming to explore\ndecentralized and market-responsive solutions to sustainable waste management.\nFuture work should focus on validating the model through field trials or\nbehavioral experiments.",

This process requires an accurate\nlensing tracer, which can be obtained either through internal reconstruction\nfrom high-resolution CMB observations or from external large-scale structure\n(LSS) surveys. Ground-based large-aperture telescopes (LATs) are crucial for\ninternal reconstruction, yet existing and planned facilities are confined to\nthe southern hemisphere, limiting effective delensing to that region. In this\nwork, we assess the impact of introducing a northern hemisphere LAT, assumed to\nbe situated near AliCPT (hence termed Ali-like LAT, or LATN), on delensing\nperformance and PGW detection, using simulations. Our baseline setup includes a\nspace-based small-aperture mission (LiteBIRD-like, SAT) and a southern LAT\n(SO-like, LATS). External LSS tracers, which have been shown to play an\nimportant role in delensing before the availability of ultra-sensitive\npolarization data, are also considered. We find that southern-hemisphere\ninternal delensing reduces the uncertainty in r by approximately 21% compared\nto the no-delensing case. Adding LATN enables full-sky internal delensing,\nachieving a further ~19% reduction--comparable to that from including LSS\ntracers (~17%). Once LATN is included, the marginal benefit of LSS tracers\ndrops to ~10%. These results highlight the significant role of LATN in\nadvancing delensing capabilities and improving PGW constraints.",

This deformation couples the fermion to the scalar\nsector, generating a renormalization group flow that terminates at a nontrivial\ninfrared fixed point described by a conformal Gross-Neveu-Yukawa model and a\ndecoupled critical vector model. By construction, the quantum field theory is\nparity invariant at zero temperature. However, we show that at sufficiently\nhigh temperatures, parity symmetry is spontaneously broken and remains so even\nin the infinite-temperature limit. Our analysis relies on both, perturbative\nrenormalization group techniques in $4\\!-\\!\\epsilon$ dimensions and functional\nrenormalization group techniques directly in 2+1 dimensions.",

    "abstract": "In causal inference, a fundamental task is to estimate the effect resulting\nfrom a specific treatment, which is often handled with inverse probability\nweighting. Despite an abundance of attention to the advancement of this task,\nmost articles have focused on linear data rather than circular data, which are\nmeasured in angles. In this article, we extend the causal inference framework\nto accommodate circular data. Specifically, two new treatment effects, average\ndirection treatment effect (ADTE) and average length treatment effect (ALTE),\nare introduced to offer a proper causal explanation for these data. As the\naverage direction and average length describe the location and concentration of\na random sample of circular data, the ADTE and ALTE measure the change in\ndirection and length between two counterfactual outcomes. With inverse\nprobability weighting, we propose estimators that exhibit ideal theoretical\nproperties, which are validated by a simulation study. To illustrate the\npractical utility of our estimator, we analyze the effect of different job\ntypes on dispatchers' sleep patterns using data from Federal Railroad\nAdministration.",

Current CL methods function within the confines\nof limited data access, without any restrictions imposed on computational\nresources. However, in real-world scenarios, the latter takes precedence as\ndeployed systems are often computationally constrained. A major drawback of\nmost CL methods is the need to retrain the entire model for each new task. The\ncomputational demands of retraining large models can be prohibitive, limiting\nthe applicability of CL in environments with limited resources. Through CLoRA,\nwe explore the applicability of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), a\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning method for class-incremental semantic\nsegmentation. CLoRA leverages a small set of parameters of the model and uses\nthe same set for learning across all tasks. Results demonstrate the efficacy of\nCLoRA, achieving performance on par with and exceeding the baseline methods.

In this work, we further elaborate this\nframework and use it to develop MR generalizations of two other RPA variants,\nnamely, particle-hole (ph) RPA with exchange (MR-RPAx) and particle-particle\nRPA (MR-ppRPA). We define these two MR generalizations by infinite order\nresummations of the generalized `ring' and `ladder' diagrams with\nantisymmetrized interaction vertices, respectively, which incorporate the\ncontributions from the active-space connected two-body Green's functions. As\nfor MR-dRPA, we derive unified sets of equations that hold at both SR and MR\nlevels for RPAx and ppRPA, respectively. We perform numerical studies of\nprototypical systems using the three MR-RPA methods and carry out a\nperturbative analysis to gain a deeper understanding of their behaviors.

    "abstract": "Vision-language tracking aims to locate the target object in the video\nsequence using a template patch and a language description provided in the\ninitial frame. To achieve robust tracking, especially in complex long-term\nscenarios that reflect real-world conditions as recently highlighted by MGIT,\nit is essential not only to characterize the target features but also to\nutilize the context features related to the target. However, the visual and\ntextual target-context cues derived from the initial prompts generally align\nonly with the initial target state. Due to their dynamic nature, target states\nare constantly changing, particularly in complex long-term sequences. It is\nintractable for these cues to continuously guide Vision-Language Trackers\n(VLTs). Furthermore, for the text prompts with diverse expressions, our\nexperiments reveal that existing VLTs struggle to discern which words pertain\nto the target or the context, complicating the utilization of textual cues. In\nthis work, we present a novel tracker named ATCTrack, which can obtain\nmultimodal cues Aligned with the dynamic target states through comprehensive\nTarget-Context feature modeling, thereby achieving robust tracking.\nSpecifically, (1) for the visual modality, we propose an effective temporal\nvisual target-context modeling approach that provides the tracker with timely\nvisual cues. (2) For the textual modality, we achieve precise target words\nidentification solely based on textual content, and design an innovative\ncontext words calibration method to adaptively utilize auxiliary context words.\n(3) We conduct extensive experiments on mainstream benchmarks and ATCTrack\nachieves a new SOTA performance.

Furthermore, to\nenhance prior retrieval from the codebook bank, DiffCode introduces a latent\ndiffusion strategy that utilizes the diffusion model's powerful mapping\ncapabilities to iteratively refine the latent feature distribution, estimating\nmore accurate HQ prior features during restoration. With the help of the\ntask-adaptive codebook bank and latent diffusion strategy, DiffCode achieves\nsuperior performance in both quantitative metrics and visual quality across\nthree MedIR tasks: MRI super-resolution, CT denoising, and PET synthesis.",

    "abstract": "Landmine removal is a slow, resource-intensive process affecting over 60\ncountries. While AI has been proposed to enhance explosive ordnance (EO)\ndetection, existing methods primarily focus on object recognition, with limited\nattention to prediction of landmine risk based on spatial pattern information.\nThis work aims to answer the following research question: How can AI be used to\npredict landmine risk from landmine patterns to improve clearance time\nefficiency? To that effect, we introduce RestoreAI, an AI system for\npattern-based risk estimation of remaining explosives. RestoreAI is the first\nAI system that leverages landmine patterns for risk prediction, improving the\naccuracy of estimating the residual risk of missing EO prior to land release.\nWe particularly focus on the implementation of three instances of RestoreAI,\nrespectively, linear, curved and Bayesian pattern deminers. First, the linear\npattern deminer uses linear landmine patterns from a principal component\nanalysis (PCA) for the landmine risk prediction. Second, the curved pattern\ndeminer uses curved landmine patterns from principal curves. Finally, the\nBayesian pattern deminer incorporates prior expert knowledge by using a\nBayesian pattern risk prediction. Evaluated on real-world landmine data,\nRestoreAI significantly boosts clearance efficiency. The top-performing\npattern-based deminers achieved a 14.37 percentage point increase in the\naverage share of cleared landmines per timestep and required 24.45% less time\nthan the best baseline deminer to locate all landmines. Interestingly, linear\nand curved pattern deminers showed no significant performance difference,\nsuggesting that more efficient linear patterns are a viable option for risk\nprediction.",

As observed\nin an MIT Social Evolution study, the in-degree and out-degree of the nodes\nshow considerable heterogeneity that varies with time. Concurrently, homophily\neffects, which explain why nodes with similar characteristics are more likely\nto connect with each other, are also time-dependent. To facilitate the\nexploration and understanding of these dynamics, we propose a novel\ndegree-corrected Cox model for directed networks, where the way for\ndegree-heterogeneity or homophily effects to change with time is left\ncompletely unspecified. Because each node has individual-specific in- and\nout-degree parameters that vary over time, the number of unknown parameters\ngrows with the number of nodes, leading to a high-dimensional estimation\nproblem. Therefore, it is highly nontrivial to make inference. We develop a\nlocal estimating equations approach to estimate the unknown parameters and\nestablish the consistency and asymptotic normality of the proposed estimators\nin the high-dimensional regime. We further propose test statistics to check\nwhether temporal variation or degree heterogeneity is present in the network\nand develop a graphically diagnostic method to evaluate goodness-of-fit for\ndynamic network models.

    "abstract": "We introduce a quantum-informed machine learning (QIML) framework for the\nlong-term dynamical behavior of high-dimensional chaotic systems. The method\ncombines a one-time, offline-trained quantum generative model with a classical\nautoregressive predictor for spatiotemporal field generation. The quantum model\nlearns a quantum prior (Q-Prior) that guides the representation of small-scale\ninteractions and improves the modeling of fine-scale dynamics. We evaluate QIML\non three representative systems: the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, the\ntwo-dimensional Kolmogorov flow, and a cross-section of fully developed\nthree-dimensional turbulent channel flow used as a realistic inflow condition.\nCompared to the classical baseline, QIML yields up to 17.25% improvement in\npredictive distribution accuracy and a 29.36% improvement in the fidelity of\nthe predicted full energy spectrum. For turbulent channel inflow, the Q-Prior\nis essential: without it, the model fails to evolve in time, while QIML\nproduces stable, physically consistent forecasts that surpass leading machine\nlearning models for PDEs, including the Fourier Neural Operator and Markov\nNeural Operator, whose errors diverge. Beyond accuracy, QIML also achieves a\nmemory advantage, compressing multi-megabyte datasets into a kilobyte-scale\nQ-Prior that captures only the invariant measure needed to guide the classical\nmodel, thus circumventing Holevo's bound by avoiding full data reconstruction.\nOur findings provide a practical and scalable pathway for integrating the\nadvantages brought by quantum devices into large-scale scientific, engineering\nmodeling and simulation.",

Such deadlocks frequently occur when multiple agents attempt to\ntraverse the same long and narrow corridor simultaneously. To address this, we\npropose a novel distributed trajectory planning framework that bridges the gap\nbetween global path and local trajectory cooperation. At the global level, a\nhomotopy-aware optimal path planning algorithm is proposed, which fully\nleverages the topological structure of the environment.

Additionally, an online replanning strategy ensures its\nadaptability to dynamic environments. Simulations and experiments validate the\neffectiveness of our approach in mitigating deadlocks.

To overcome this limitation, this paper\nintroduces the \"Think, Act, Learn\" (T-A-L) framework, a novel architecture that\nenables an embodied agent to autonomously learn and refine its policies through\ncontinuous interaction. Our framework establishes a closed-loop cycle where an\nLLM first \"thinks\" by decomposing high-level commands into actionable plans.\nThe robot then \"acts\" by executing these plans while gathering rich, multimodal\nsensory feedback. Critically, the \"learn\" module processes this feedback to\nfacilitate LLM-driven self-reflection, allowing the agent to perform causal\nanalysis on its failures and generate corrective strategies. These insights are\nstored in an experiential memory to guide future planning cycles. We\ndemonstrate through extensive experiments in both simulation and the real world\nthat our T-A-L agent significantly outperforms baseline methods, including\nopen-loop LLMs, Behavioral Cloning, and traditional Reinforcement Learning.

    "abstract": "Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for building reliable machine\nlearning models. Although negative prompt tuning has enhanced the OOD detection\ncapabilities of vision-language models, these tuned models often suffer from\nreduced generalization performance on unseen classes and styles. To address\nthis challenge, we propose a novel method called Knowledge Regularized Negative\nFeature Tuning (KR-NFT), which integrates an innovative adaptation architecture\ntermed Negative Feature Tuning (NFT) and a corresponding\nknowledge-regularization (KR) optimization strategy. Specifically, NFT applies\ndistribution-aware transformations to pre-trained text features, effectively\nseparating positive and negative features into distinct spaces. This separation\nmaximizes the distinction between in-distribution (ID) and OOD images.\nAdditionally, we introduce image-conditional learnable factors through a\nlightweight meta-network, enabling dynamic adaptation to individual images and\nmitigating sensitivity to class and style shifts. Compared to traditional\nnegative prompt tuning, NFT demonstrates superior efficiency and scalability.\nTo optimize this adaptation architecture, the KR optimization strategy is\ndesigned to enhance the discrimination between ID and OOD sets while mitigating\npre-trained knowledge forgetting. This enhances OOD detection performance on\ntrained ID classes while simultaneously improving OOD detection on unseen ID\ndatasets. Notably, when trained with few-shot samples from ImageNet dataset,\nKR-NFT not only improves ID classification accuracy and OOD detection but also\nsignificantly reduces the FPR95 by 5.44\\% under an unexplored generalization\nsetting with unseen ID categories.

To address the\nNP-hardness of QAP, some existing methods adopt projection-based relaxations\nthat embed the problem into the convex hull of the discrete domain. However,\nthese relaxations inevitably enlarge the feasible set, introducing two sources\nof error: numerical scale sensitivity and geometric misalignment between the\nrelaxed and original domains. To alleviate these errors, we propose a novel\nrelaxation framework by reformulating the projection step as a\nFrobenius-regularized Linear Assignment (FRA) problem, where a tunable\nregularization term mitigates feasible region inflation. This formulation\nenables normalization-based operations to preserve numerical scale invariance\nwithout compromising accuracy. To efficiently solve FRA, we propose the Scaling\nDoubly Stochastic Normalization (SDSN) algorithm. Building on its favorable\ncomputational properties, we develop a theoretically grounded mixed-precision\narchitecture to achieve substantial acceleration. Comprehensive CPU-based\nbenchmarks demonstrate that FRAM consistently outperforms all baseline methods\nunder identical precision settings.

This involves recognizing and interpreting the hands, face, and\nbody gestures of the signer, which pose a challenge as it involves a\ncombination of all these features. Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR)\nmethods rely on multi-stage pipelines that first extract visual features, then\nalign variable-length sequences with target glosses using CTC or HMM-based\napproaches. However, these alignment-based methods suffer from error\npropagation across stages, overfitting, and struggle with vocabulary\nscalability due to the intermediate gloss representation bottleneck. To address\nthese limitations, we propose AutoSign, an autoregressive decoder-only\ntransformer that directly translates pose sequences to natural language text,\nbypassing traditional alignment mechanisms entirely. The use of this\ndecoder-only approach allows the model to directly map between the features and\nthe glosses without the need for CTC loss while also directly learning the\ntextual dependencies in the glosses. Our approach incorporates a temporal\ncompression module using 1D CNNs to efficiently process pose sequences,\nfollowed by AraGPT2, a pre-trained Arabic decoder, to generate text (glosses).\nThrough comprehensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that hand and body\ngestures provide the most discriminative features for signer-independent CSLR.\nBy eliminating the multi-stage pipeline, AutoSign achieves substantial\nimprovements on the Isharah-1000 dataset, achieving an improvement of up to\n6.1\\% in WER score compared to the best existing method.",

    "abstract": "We use macroscopic fluctuation theory (MFT) to analyse current fluctuations\nin a non-interacting Brownian gas with one or more partially absorbing targets\nwithin a bounded domain $\\Omega \\subset \\R^d$. We proceed by coarse-graining a\ngeneralised Dean-Kawasaki equation with Robin boundary conditions at the target\nsurfaces. The exterior surface $\\partial \\Omega$ is maintained at a constant\ndensity $\\owp$. We first derive MFT equations for the optimal noise-induced\npath for a single target under a saddle-point approximation of the associated\npath integral action. We then obtain the Gaussian distribution characterising\nsmall current fluctuations by linearising the MFT equations about the\ncorresponding deterministic or noise-averaged system and solving the resulting\nstationary equations. The Robin boundary conditions are handled using the\nspectrum of a Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator defined on the target surface. We\nillustrate the theory by considering the finite interval and a circular\nannulus. In both cases we determine how the variance of the current depends on\nthe rate of absorption $\\kappa$. Finally, we extend our analysis to multiple\npartially absorbing targets. First, we obtain the general result that, in the\ncase of partially absorbing targets ($0<\\kappa<\\infty$), the covariance matrix\nfor current fluctuations supports cross correlations even in the absence of\nparticle interactions. (These cross-correlations vanish in the totally\nabsorbing limit $\\kappa\\rightarrow \\infty$.) We then explicitly calculate the\ncovariance matrix for circular targets in a 2D domain by assuming that the\ntargets are much smaller than the characteristic size $L$ of the domain\n$\\Omega$ and applying methods from singular perturbation theory.",

However, little attention has been given to the\nimmersive understanding of architectural styles and structural knowledge, which\nremains largely confined to browsing static text-image pairs. Therefore, can we\ndraw inspiration from 3D in-the-wild reconstruction techniques and use\nunconstrained photo collections to create an immersive approach for\nunderstanding the 3D structure of architectural components? To this end, we\nextend language embedded 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) and propose a novel\nframework for open-vocabulary scene understanding from unconstrained photo\ncollections. Specifically, we first render multiple appearance images from the\nsame viewpoint as the unconstrained image with the reconstructed radiance\nfield, then extract multi-appearance CLIP features and two types of language\nfeature uncertainty maps-transient and appearance uncertainty-derived from the\nmulti-appearance features to guide the subsequent optimization process. Next,\nwe propose a transient uncertainty-aware autoencoder, a multi-appearance\nlanguage field 3DGS representation, and a post-ensemble strategy to effectively\ncompress, learn, and fuse language features from multiple appearances. Finally,\nto quantitatively evaluate our method, we introduce PT-OVS, a new benchmark\ndataset for assessing open-vocabulary segmentation performance on unconstrained\nphoto collections.

In this paper, we propose FedBAP, a novel defense\nframework for mitigating backdoor attacks in FL by reducing the model's\nreliance on backdoor triggers. Specifically, first, we propose a perturbed\ntrigger generation mechanism that creates perturbation triggers precisely\nmatching backdoor triggers in location and size, ensuring strong influence on\nmodel outputs.

The experimental results demonstrate that FedBAP reduces the\nattack success rates by 0.22%-5.34%, 0.48%-6.34%, and 97.22%-97.6% under three\ntypes of backdoor attacks, respectively.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate mean-variance (MV) portfolio selection problems\nwith jumps in a regime-switching financial model. The novelty of our approach\nlies in allowing not only the market parameters -- such as the interest rate,\nappreciation rate, volatility, and jump intensity -- to depend on the market\nregime, but also in permitting stock prices to experience jumps when the market\nregime switches, in addition to the usual micro-level jumps. This modeling\nchoice is motivated by empirical observations that stock prices often exhibit\nsharp declines when the market shifts from a ``bullish'' to a ``bearish''\nregime, and vice versa. By employing the completion-of-squares technique, we\nderive the optimal portfolio strategy and the efficient frontier, both of which\nare characterized by three systems of multi-dimensional ordinary differential\nequations (ODEs). Among these, two systems are linear, while the first one is\nan $\\ell$-dimensional, fully coupled, and highly nonlinear Riccati equation. In\nthe absence of regime-switching-induced stock price shocks, these systems\nreduce to simple linear ODEs. Thus, the introduction of\nregime-switching-induced stock price shocks adds significant complexity and\nchallenges to our model. Additionally, we explore the MV problem under a\nno-shorting constraint.

    "abstract": "Industry adoption of chiplets has been increasing as a cost-effective option\nfor making larger high-performance systems. Consequently, partitioning large\nsystems into chiplets is increasingly important. In this work, we introduce\nChipletPart - a cost-driven 2.5D system partitioner that addresses the unique\nconstraints of chiplet systems, including complex objective functions, limited\nreach of inter-chiplet I/O transceivers, and the assignment of heterogeneous\nmanufacturing technologies to different chiplets. ChipletPart integrates a\nsophisticated chiplet cost model with its underlying genetic algorithm-based\ntechnology assignment and partitioning methodology, along with a simulated\nannealing-based chiplet floorplanner. Our results show that: (i) ChipletPart\nreduces chiplet cost by up to 58% (20% geometric mean) compared to\nstate-of-the-art min-cut partitioners, which often yield floorplan-infeasible\nsolutions; (ii) ChipletPart generates partitions with up to 47% (6% geometric\nmean) lower cost as compared to the prior work Floorplet; and (iii) for the\ntestcases we study, heterogeneous integration reduces cost by up to 43% (15%\ngeometric mean) compared to homogeneous implementations. Additionally, we\nexplore Bayesian optimization (BO) for finding low cost and floorplan-feasible\nchiplet solutions with technology assignments. On some testcases, our BO\nframework achieves better system cost (up to 5.3% improvement) with higher\nruntime overhead (up to 4x) compared to our GA framework. We also present case\nstudies that show how changes in packaging and inter-chiplet signaling\ntechnologies can affect partitioning solutions. Finally, we make ChipletPart,\nthe underlying chiplet cost model, and a chiplet testcase generator available\nas open-source tools for the community.",

    "abstract": "Urban flooding in arid regions poses severe risks to infrastructure and\ncommunities. Accurate, fine-scale mapping of flood extents and recovery\ntrajectories is therefore essential for improving emergency response and\nresilience planning. However, arid environments often exhibit limited spectral\ncontrast between water and adjacent surfaces, rapid hydrological dynamics, and\nhighly heterogeneous urban land covers, which challenge traditional\nflood-mapping approaches. High-resolution, daily PlanetScope imagery provides\nthe temporal and spatial detail needed. In this work, we introduce FM-LC, a\nhierarchical framework for Flood Mapping by Land Cover identification, for this\nchallenging task. Through a three-stage process, it first uses an initial\nmulti-class U-Net to segment imagery into water, vegetation, built area, and\nbare ground classes. We identify that this method has confusion between\nspectrally similar categories (e.g., water vs. vegetation). Second, by early\nchecking, the class with the major misclassified area is flagged, and a\nlightweight binary expert segmentation model is trained to distinguish the\nflagged class from the rest. Third, a Bayesian smoothing step refines\nboundaries and removes spurious noise by leveraging nearby pixel information.\nWe validate the framework on the April 2024 Dubai storm event, using pre- and\npost-rainfall PlanetScope composites. Experimental results demonstrate average\nF1-score improvements of up to 29% across all land-cover classes and notably\nsharper flood delineations, significantly outperforming conventional\nsingle-stage U-Net baselines.",

Accurate and low-complexity channel estimation is one\nof the most critical challenges for massive multiple input multiple\noutput~(MIMO) ODDM systems, mainly due to the extremely large antenna arrays\nand high-mobility environments. To overcome these challenges, this paper\naddresses the issue of channel estimation in downlink massive MIMO-ODDM systems\nand proposes a low-complexity algorithm based on memory approximate message\npassing~(MAMP) to estimate the channel state information~(CSI). Specifically,\nwe first establish the effective channel model of the massive MIMO-ODDM\nsystems, where the magnitudes of the elements in the equivalent channel vector\nfollow a Bernoulli-Gaussian distribution. Further, as the number of antennas\ngrows, the elements in the equivalent coefficient matrix tend to become\ncompletely random. Leveraging these characteristics, we utilize the MAMP method\nto determine the gains, delays, and Doppler effects of the multi-path channel,\nwhile the channel angles are estimated through the discrete Fourier transform\nmethod. Finally, numerical results show that the proposed channel estimation\nalgorithm approaches the Bayesian optimal results when the number of antennas\ntends to infinity and improves the channel estimation accuracy by about 30%\ncompared with the existing algorithms in terms of the normalized mean square\nerror.",

However, existing\nmethods often neglect the significance of foreground elements, which provide\nessential geometric references and layout information for document image\ncorrection. In this paper, we introduce Foreground-Centric Network (ForCenNet)\nto eliminate geometric distortions in document images. Specifically, we\ninitially propose a foreground-centric label generation method, which extracts\ndetailed foreground elements from an undistorted image. Then we introduce a\nforeground-centric mask mechanism to enhance the distinction between readable\nand background regions. Furthermore, we design a curvature consistency loss to\nleverage the detailed foreground labels to help the model understand the\ndistorted geometric distribution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nForCenNet achieves new state-of-the-art on four real-world benchmarks, such as\nDocUNet, DIR300, WarpDoc, and DocReal. Quantitative analysis shows that the\nproposed method effectively undistorts layout elements, such as text lines and\ntable borders.

    "abstract": "Approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) has become a quintessential\nalgorithmic problem for various other foundational data tasks for AI workloads.\nGraph-based ANNS indexes have superb empirical trade-offs in indexing cost,\nquery efficiency, and query approximation quality. Most existing graph-based\nindexes are designed for the static scenario, where there are no updates to the\ndata after the index is constructed. However, full dynamism (insertions,\ndeletions, and searches) is crucial to providing up-to-date responses in\napplications using vector databases. It is desirable that the index efficiently\nsupports updates and search queries concurrently. Existing dynamic graph-based\nindexes suffer from at least one of the following problems: (1) the query\nquality degrades as updates happen; and (2) the graph structure updates used to\nmaintain the index quality upon updates are global and thus expensive. To solve\nthese problems, we propose the CleANN system which consists of three main\ncomponents: (1) workload-aware linking of diverse search tree descendants to\ncombat distribution shift; (2)query-adaptive on-the-fly neighborhood\nconsolidation to efficiently handle deleted nodes; and (3) semi-lazy memory\ncleaning to clean up stale information in the data structure and reduce the\nwork spent by the first two components. We evaluate CleANN on 7 diverse\ndatasets on fully dynamic workloads and find that CleANN has query quality at\nleast as good as if the index had been built statically using the corresponding\ndata. In the in-memory setting using 56 hyper-threads, with all types of\nqueries running concurrently, at the same recall level, CleANN achieves 7-1200x\nthroughput improvement on million-scale real-world datasets. To the best of our\nknowledge, CleANN is the first concurrent ANNS index to achieve such efficiency\nwhile maintaining quality under full dynamism.",

In our previous work, we employed\nsingle types of 2D material and showed that even monolayer flakes can locally\ninduce high-$Q$ nanocavities in photonic crystal (PhC) waveguides through\neffective refractive index modulation.

This process enables the transformation of large-scale image-mask pairs\ninto image-flow-mask training pairs, dramatically expanding the data available\nfor network training. By training a simple encoder-decoder architecture with\nour synthesized data, we achieve new state-of-the-art performance on all public\nVOS benchmarks, demonstrating a scalable and effective solution to the data\nscarcity problem.",

When applied to modern deep learning architectures, this\nsimple probe reveals a fundamental dichotomy. On Vision Transformers (ViTs),\nthe BoC output serves as a state-of-the-art confidence score, achieving\nnear-perfect calibration with an ECE of 0.0212, an 88% improvement over a\ntemperature-scaled baseline. Conversely, on Convolutional Neural Networks\n(CNNs) like ResNet, the probe reveals a deep inconsistency between the model's\npredictions and its internal logit structure, a property missed by traditional\nmetrics. We posit that BoC is not merely a calibration method, but a new\ndiagnostic tool for understanding and exposing the differing ways that popular\narchitectures represent uncertainty.",

    "abstract": "Sleep disturbances, particularly nighttime waking, are highly prevalent in\nyoung children and can significantly disrupt not only the child's well-being\nbut also family functioning. Behavioral and environmental strategies, including\nthe regulation of light exposure, are typically recommended treatments for\nnighttime waking. Using the Homeostatic-Circadian-Light (HCL) mathematical\nmodel for sleep timing based on the interaction of the circadian rhythm, the\nhomeostatic sleep drive and external light, we analyze how external light\nschedules can influence the occurrence of nighttime waking in young children.\nWe fit the model to data for sleep homeostasis and sleep behavior in 2 - 3.5\nyear olds and identified subsets of parameter ranges that fit the data but\nindicated a susceptibility to nighttime waking. This suggests that as children\ndevelop they may exhibit more or less propensity to awaken during the night.\nNotably, parameter sets exhibiting earlier sleep timing were more susceptible\nto nighttime waking. For a model parameter set susceptible to, but not\nexhibiting, nighttime waking, we analyze how external light schedules affect\nsleep patterns. We find that low daytime light levels can induce nighttime\nsleep disruptions and extended bright-light exposure also promotes nighttime\nwaking. Further results suggest that consistent daily routines are essential;\nirregular schedules, particularly during weekends, markedly worsen the\nconsolidation of nighttime sleep. Specifically, weekend delays in morning\nlights-on and evening lights-off times result in nighttime sleep disruptions\nand can influence sleep timing during the week. These results highlight how\nexternal light, daily rhythms, and parenting routines interact to shape\nchildrens' sleep health, providing a useful framework for improving sleep\nmanagement practices.",

To\naddress these challenges, we propose an Ultra-Long Output Reinforcement\nLearning (UloRL) approach for advancing large language models' reasoning\nabilities. Specifically, we divide ultra long output decoding into short\nsegments, enabling efficient training by mitigating delays caused by long-tail\nsamples.

In\nthis paper, we derive a generalized stochastic LLG equation from first\nprinciples for spin-orbital coupled Mott insulators, explicitly incorporating\nthe coupling between electronic degrees of freedom and lattice vibrations. Our\napproach is based on the path-integral formalism formulated along the Keldysh\ncontour, which naturally accounts for dissipation and thermal fluctuations\nthrough interactions with a phonon bath and emergent stochastic noise.

This demonstrates the robustness\nand reliability of our formalism for capturing both equilibrium and\nnonequilibrium aspects of dissipative spin dynamics in strongly correlated\nsystems.

By mapping the classification results with robot\nmotion primitives, a diverse range of robot motions can be generated by\naltering the manner in which the skin sensors are interacted with. In this\npaper, we focus on a learning-based contact motion classifier employing\nrecurrent neural networks. This classifier is a pivotal factor in the success\nof this framework. Furthermore, we elucidate the requisite conditions for\nsoftware-hardware designs. Firstly, multimodal sensing and its comprehensive\nencoding significantly contribute to the enhancement of classification accuracy\nand learning stability.

    "abstract": "The microphysical properties of ice crystals are important because they\nsignificantly alter the radiative properties and spatiotemporal distributions\nof clouds, which in turn strongly affect Earth's climate. However, it is\nchallenging to measure key properties of ice crystals, such as mass or\nmorphological features. Here, we present a framework for predicting\nthree-dimensional (3D) microphysical properties of ice crystals from in situ\ntwo-dimensional (2D) imagery. First, we computationally generate synthetic ice\ncrystals using 3D modeling software along with geometric parameters estimated\nfrom the 2021 Ice Cryo-Encapsulation Balloon (ICEBall) field campaign. Then, we\nuse synthetic crystals to train machine learning (ML) models to predict\neffective density ($\\rho_{e}$), effective surface area ($A_e$), and number of\nbullets ($N_b$) from synthetic rosette imagery. When tested on unseen synthetic\nimages, we find that our ML models can predict microphysical properties with\nhigh accuracy. For $\\rho_{e}$ and $A_e$, respectively, our best-performing\nsingle view models achieved $R^2$ values of 0.99 and 0.98. For $N_b$, our best\nsingle view model achieved a balanced accuracy and F1 score of 0.91. We also\nquantify the marginal prediction improvements from incorporating a second view.\nA stereo view ResNet-18 model reduced RMSE by 40% for both $\\rho_e$ and $A_e$,\nrelative to a single view ResNet-18 model. For $N_b$, we find that a stereo\nview ResNet-18 model improved the F1 score by 8%. This work provides a novel\nML-driven framework for estimating ice microphysical properties from in situ\nimagery, which will allow for downstream constraints on microphysical\nparameterizations, such as the mass-size relationship.",

    "abstract": "Background: Muon nuclear capture is a reaction between a muon and a proton\ninside a nucleus through weak interactions. This reaction results in the\nformation of an excited nucleus, which subsequently de-excites by emitting\nseveral particles. Examination of the excited state allows for an investigation\nof the properties of nuclear excitation and particle emission in highly excited\nnuclei. Purpose: This study investigates muon nuclear capture of 27Al and\n28,29,30Si, focusing on determining the absolute production branching ratio\n(BR) following muon nuclear capture and subsequent particle emissions. By\nmeasuring the absolute production BR, we can collect valuable information on\nthe excitation energy distribution of muon nuclear capture. Methods:\nMeasurements were conducted using the in-beam activation method at two pulsed\nmuon facilities: RIKEN-RAL beamline and MLF at J-PARC. Absolute BRs were\ndetermined by measuring the number of muons irradiating the target using a\nplastic scintillator and the beta-delayed gamma-rays emitted from the produced\nnuclei using germanium detectors. Results: The absolute production branching\nratios of muon nuclear capture on 27Al and 28,29,30Si were obtained with the\nhighest accuracy to date. Predominant neutron emissions, even-odd atomic number\ndependence of particle emission probabilities, and influence of the neutron\nexcess were observed. These results were compared with previous measurements\nand theoretical models and discussed regarding the excitation energy\ndistribution, particle emission mechanism, and nuclear properties, such as\nresonance in the isovector transition. Conclusion: This study emphasizes the\nimportance of considering nuclear structure effects, even-odd effects of proton\nand neutron numbers, neutron excess, nucleon pairing effect, and particle\nemission mechanisms, in the context of the muon nuclear capture reaction.",

Existing\nmethodologies, which presuppose a smooth data manifold, are ill-equipped to\naddress such intrinsic structural flaws. In this paper, we formalize this\nproblem in the language of scheme theory and propose a rigorous resolution by\napplying the scheme-theoretic blow-up at each singular point. This procedure\nreplaces a singular point in the ambient affine scheme with its exceptional\ndivisor, which we identify as a canonical geometric space -- a projective space\nof directions -- that houses the disambiguated semantic meanings of the token.\nThis process of ``representational desingularization'' constructs a new\ngeometric landscape for embeddings.

To simulate\nrandom perturbations arising from manufacturing defects and surface wear in\nreal-world grating profiles, we propose a stochastic surface modeling framework\nmotivated by the discretization of the Wiener process. Our approach introduces\nrandomness at discrete nodes and then applies linear interpolation to construct\nthe surface, marking a novel attempt to incorporate the concepts of the Wiener\nprocess into random surface representation. Under this framework, each\nrealization of the random surface generates a Lipschitz-continuous diffraction\ngrating, mathematically represented as a sum of a baseline profile and a\nweighted linear combination of local `tent' basis functions, meanwhile\npreserving key statistics of the random surface. Building on this\nrepresentation, we introduce the Recursive Parametric Smoothing Strategy (RPSS)\nto invert the key statistics of our random surfaces. Combined with Monte Carlo\nsampling and a wavenumber continuation strategy, our reconstruction scheme\ndemonstrates effectiveness across multiple benchmark scenarios.

Both distillation approaches train small models to imitate\nspecific features of LLMs, but they all neglect basic reading education for\nsmall models on generic texts that are \\emph{unrelated} to downstream tasks. In\nthis paper, we propose basic reading distillation (BRD) which educates a small\nmodel to imitate LLMs basic reading behaviors, such as named entity\nrecognition, question raising and answering, on each sentence. After such basic\neducation, we apply the small model on various tasks including language\ninference benchmarks and BIG-bench tasks.

These query results are then\nused to create Markov chain models, allowing us to predict future states based\non the vessel's history. To fully support this process, we introduce the term\n`spatiotemporal instant' to complete the necessary structural semantics.\nAdditionally, we critique the prevailing ontological model of probability,\naccording to which probabilities are about the future. We propose an\nalternative view, where at least some probabilities are treated as being about\nactual process profiles, which better captures the dynamics of real-world\nphenomena. Finally, we demonstrate how our Markov chain-based probability\ncalculations can be seamlessly integrated back into the knowledge graph,\nenabling further analysis and decision-making.",

    "abstract": "The construction of $C^m$ conforming finite elements on simplicial meshes has\nrecently advanced through the groundbreaking work of Hu, Lin, and Wu (Found.\nComput. Math. 24, 2024). Their framework characterizes smoothness via moments\nof normal derivatives over subsimplices, leading to explicit degrees of freedom\nand unisolvence, unifying earlier constructions. However, the absence of\nexplicit basis functions has left these spaces largely inaccessible for\npractical computation. In parallel, multivariate spline theory (Chui and Lai,\nJ. Approx. Theory 60, 1990) enforces $C^m$ smoothness through linear\nconstraints on Bernstein--B\\'{e}zier coefficients, but stable, locally\nsupported bases remain elusive beyond low dimensions. Building on the geometric\ndecomposition of the simplicial lattice proposed by Chen and Huang (Math. Comp.\n93, 2024), this work develops an explicit, computable framework for smooth\nfinite elements. The degrees of freedom defined by moments of normal\nderivatives are modified to align with the dual basis of the Bernstein\npolynomials, yielding structured local bases on each simplex. Explicit basis\nconstruction is essential not merely for completeness, but for enabling\nefficient matrix assembly, global continuity, and scalable solution of\nhigh-order elliptic partial differential equations. This development closes the\ngap between theoretical existence and practical realization, making smooth\nfinite element methods accessible to broad computational applications.",

If backgrounds and targets can be simultaneously\nextracted and recombined, such synthetic data can significantly enrich\nannotated in-the-wild datasets and enhance the generalization ability of deep\nmodels. Quaternion-based RPCA (QRPCA) is a promising unsupervised paradigm for\ncolor image processing. However, in color video processing, Quaternion Singular\nValue Decomposition (QSVD) incurs high computational costs, and rank-1\nquaternion matrix fails to yield rank-1 color channels.

Moreover, we expand to uQRPCA+ by\nintroducing the Color Rank-1 Batch (CR1B) method to further process and obtain\nthe ideal low-rank background across color channels.

However, KGs storing\ngeneral factual information often lack the ability to account for important\ncontexts of the knowledge such as the status of specific patients, which are\ncrucial in precision healthcare. Meanwhile, electronic health records (EHRs)\nprovide rich personal data, including various diagnoses and medications, which\nprovide natural contexts for general KGs. In this paper, we propose HypKG, a\nframework that integrates patient information from EHRs into KGs to generate\ncontextualized knowledge representations for accurate healthcare predictions.\nUsing advanced entity-linking techniques, we connect relevant knowledge from\ngeneral KGs with patient information from EHRs, and then utilize a hypergraph\nmodel to \"contextualize\" the knowledge with the patient information. Finally,\nwe employ hypergraph transformers guided by downstream prediction tasks to\njointly learn proper contextualized representations for both KGs and patients,\nfully leveraging existing knowledge in KGs and patient contexts in EHRs. In\nexperiments using a large biomedical KG and two real-world EHR datasets, HypKG\ndemonstrates significant improvements in healthcare prediction tasks across\nmultiple evaluation metrics.

This\npaper presents a direct, empirical performance analysis of matrix\nmultiplication on a modern, consumer-grade heterogeneous platform. We\nimplemented and benchmarked three versions of the algorithm: a baseline\nsequential C++ implementation, a parallel version for its multi-core CPU using\nOpenMP, and a massively parallel version for its discrete GPU using CUDA with\nshared memory optimizations. The implementations were evaluated with square\nmatrices of varying dimensions, from 128x128 to 4096x4096.

For a 4096x4096 matrix, the GPU implementation achieved a speedup of\napproximately 593x over the sequential baseline and 45x over the optimized\nparallel CPU version.

    "abstract": "Supernovae in binary star systems involve a hydrodynamical interaction\nbetween the ejecta and a binary companion. This collision results in shock\nheating and a modified density structure for the ejecta, both of which affect\nthe light curve. As highlighted by Kasen, these considerations are particularly\nrelevant for type Ia supernovae, as the companion is expected to be Roche-lobe\nfilling at the time of the explosion. We simulate here the interaction between\ntype Ia supernova ejecta and a white dwarf donor using Athena++, finding the\nformation of a low-density wake extending to higher velocities than the\nunperturbed ejecta. Radiation hydrodynamics is then used to generate synthetic\nlight curves for the first day after the explosion for a range of viewing\nangles. We find that the hot, high-velocity, shocked ejecta yields $L>10^{40}$\nergs/s over half the sky in the first few hours. The photosphere within the\nshock-heated ejecta cools and recedes in velocity space, partially obscuring it\nfrom view, as heating from radioactive nickel becomes increasingly important in\ndriving the supernova's luminosity. By one day after the explosion, the\nluminosity measured by observers looking directly into the wake is dimmer than\nthat of a normal type Ia supernova by 15 percent due to the modified density\nstructure.",

    "abstract": "Reliability prediction is crucial for ensuring the safety and security of\nsoftware systems, especially in the context of industry practices. While\nvarious metrics and measurements are employed to assess software reliability,\nthe complexity of modern systems necessitates a deeper understanding of how\nthese metrics interact with security and safety concerns. This paper explores\nthe interplay between software reliability, safety, and security, offering a\ncomprehensive analysis of key metrics and measurement techniques used in the\nindustry for reliability prediction. We identify critical threats to software\nreliability and provide a threat estimation framework that incorporates both\nsafety and security aspects. Our findings suggest that integrating reliability\nmetrics with safety and security considerations can enhance the robustness of\nsoftware systems. Furthermore, we propose a set of actionable guidelines for\npractitioners to improve their reliability prediction models while\nsimultaneously addressing the security and safety challenges of contemporary\nsoftware applications.",

    "abstract": "Traditional combinatorial spectrum auctions mainly rely on fixed bidding and\nmatching processes, which limit participants' ability to adapt their strategies\nand often result in suboptimal social welfare in dynamic spectrum sharing\nenvironments. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approximately\ntruthful combinatorial forward auction scheme with a flexible bidding mechanism\naimed at enhancing resource efficiency and maximizing social welfare. In the\nproposed scheme, each buyer submits a combinatorial bid consisting of the base\nspectrum demand and adjustable demand ranges, enabling the auctioneer to\ndynamically optimize spectrum allocation in response to market conditions. To\nstandardize the valuation across heterogeneous frequency bands, we introduce a\nSpectrum Equivalent Mapping (SEM) coefficient. A greedy matching algorithm is\nemployed to determine winning bids by sorting buyers based on their equivalent\nunit bid prices and allocating resources within supply constraints. Simulation\nresults demonstrate that the proposed flexible bidding mechanism significantly\noutperforms existing benchmark methods, achieving notably higher social welfare\nin dynamic spectrum sharing scenarios.",
