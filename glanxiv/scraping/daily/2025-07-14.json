    "abstract": "Motile living organisms routinely probe their surroundings to adapt in\never-evolving environments. Although synthetic microswimmers offer surrogates\nfor self-propelled living entities, they often lack the complex feedback\nmechanisms that enable organisms to adapt. In this work, we present an\nexperimental platform in which light-activated colloids dispersed in a nematic\nliquid crystal can (i) switch from directed to active Brownian motion depending\non the nematic anchoring and (ii) mechanically adjust their motility in\nresponse to crowding, effectively enforcing quorum-sensing interactions. Both\nfeatures are caused by a distinctive self-propulsion mechanism as unveiled\nthrough experiments, simulations, and theory. We characterize the dynamics of a\nsingle colloid and demonstrate that its motion is captured by an active\nBrownian particle model if the nematic anchoring is homeotropic, and by\ndirected self-propulsion along the nematic director if the anchoring is planar.\nNext, we investigate the many-body dynamics, showing that it undergoes a\nclustering phase separation through effective quorum-sensing interactions. Our\nwork suggests how to create adaptive materials with life-like capabilities\nusing readily accessible properties of liquid crystals and colloids without\nexplicitly engineering any of the needed mechano-chemical feedbacks.",

This study introduces a new, lightweight, and efficient\nframework for polyp detection that combines the Local Outlier Factor (LOF)\nalgorithm for filtering noisy data with the YOLO-v11n deep learning model.\n  Study design: An experimental study leveraging deep learning and outlier\nremoval techniques across multiple public datasets.\n  Methods: The proposed approach was tested on five diverse and publicly\navailable datasets: CVC-ColonDB, CVC-ClinicDB, Kvasir-SEG, ETIS, and EndoScene.\nSince these datasets originally lacked bounding box annotations, we converted\ntheir segmentation masks into suitable detection labels. To enhance the\nrobustness and generalizability of our model, we apply 5-fold cross-validation\nand remove anomalous samples using the LOF method configured with 30 neighbors\nand a contamination ratio of 5%. Cleaned data are then fed into YOLO-v11n, a\nfast and resource-efficient object detection architecture optimized for\nreal-time applications. We train the model using a combination of modern\naugmentation strategies to improve detection accuracy under diverse conditions.\n  Results: Our approach significantly improves polyp localization performance,\nachieving a precision of 95.83%, recall of 91.85%, F1-score of 93.48%, mAP@0.5\nof 96.48%, and mAP@0.5:0.95 of 77.75%. Compared to previous YOLO-based methods,\nour model demonstrates enhanced accuracy and efficiency.\n  Conclusions: These results suggest that the proposed method is well-suited\nfor real-time colonoscopy support in clinical settings. Overall, the study\nunderscores how crucial data preprocessing and model efficiency are when\ndesigning effective AI systems for medical imaging.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive reappraisal is a key strategy in emotion regulation, involving\nreinterpretation of emotionally charged stimuli to alter affective responses.\nDespite its central role in clinical and cognitive science, real-world\nreappraisal interventions remain cognitively demanding, abstract, and primarily\nverbal. This reliance on higher-order cognitive and linguistic processes is\noften impaired in individuals with trauma or depression, limiting the\neffectiveness of standard approaches. Here, we propose a novel, visually based\naugmentation of cognitive reappraisal by integrating large-scale text-to-image\ndiffusion models into the emotional regulation process. Specifically, we\nintroduce a system in which users reinterpret emotionally negative images via\nspoken reappraisals, which are transformed into supportive, emotionally\ncongruent visualizations using stable diffusion models with a fine-tuned\nIP-adapter. This generative transformation visually instantiates users'\nreappraisals while maintaining structural similarity to the original stimuli,\nexternalizing and reinforcing regulatory intent. To test this approach, we\nconducted a within-subject experiment (N = 20) using a modified cognitive\nemotion regulation (CER) task. Participants reappraised or described aversive\nimages from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS), with or without\nAI-generated visual feedback. Results show that AI-assisted reappraisal\nsignificantly reduced negative affect compared to both non-AI and control\nconditions. Further analyses reveal that sentiment alignment between\nparticipant reappraisals and generated images correlates with affective relief,\nsuggesting that multimodal coherence enhances regulatory efficacy. These\nfindings demonstrate that generative visual input can support cogitive\nreappraisal and open new directions at the intersection of generative AI,\naffective computing, and therapeutic technology.",

As a result, applying spherically-symmetric models can result in\nsignificant biases. These biases can be mitigated by fitting a triaxial model,\nrequiring deep multiprobe data and a set of physically motivated models to\ndescribe them. Here we present a multiprobe triaxial analysis methodology based\non the data available for galaxy clusters in the Cluster Heritage project with\nXMM-Newton - Mass Assembly and Thermodynamics at Endpoint of structure\nformation (CHEX-MATE), which includes X-ray data from XMM-Newton, SZ data from\nPlanck and ACT, and WL data from Subaru. This work builds on our previous\ndevelopment of a gas-only X-ray and SZ triaxial fitting formalism in Paper I.\nWe apply our approach to the CHEX-MATE cluster PSZ2 G313.33+61.13 (Abell 1689)\nand find that it is elongated along the line of sight relative to the plane of\nsky by a factor of $\\mathcal{R}_{LP} = 1.27 \\pm 0.02$.

Our triaxial fit finds a concentration of\n$c_{200c}=8.55_{-1.61}^{+2.20}$, consistent with the spherically-symmetric\nvalue of $9.99_{-1.78}^{+2.26}$, which suggests that the unexpectedly high\nconcentration in Abell 1689 is not due to triaxiality and orientation.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in high-stakes fields\nwhere their decisions impact rights and equity. However, LLMs' judicial\nfairness and implications for social justice remain underexplored. When LLMs\nact as judges, the ability to fairly resolve judicial issues is a prerequisite\nto ensure their trustworthiness. Based on theories of judicial fairness, we\nconstruct a comprehensive framework to measure LLM fairness, leading to a\nselection of 65 labels and 161 corresponding values. Applying this framework to\nthe judicial system, we compile an extensive dataset, JudiFair, comprising\n177,100 unique case facts. To achieve robust statistical inference, we develop\nthree evaluation metrics, inconsistency, bias, and imbalanced inaccuracy, and\nintroduce a method to assess the overall fairness of multiple LLMs across\nvarious labels. Through experiments with 16 LLMs, we uncover pervasive\ninconsistency, bias, and imbalanced inaccuracy across models, underscoring\nsevere LLM judicial unfairness. Particularly, LLMs display notably more\npronounced biases on demographic labels, with slightly less bias on substance\nlabels compared to procedure ones. Interestingly, increased inconsistency\ncorrelates with reduced biases, but more accurate predictions exacerbate\nbiases. While we find that adjusting the temperature parameter can influence\nLLM fairness, model size, release date, and country of origin do not exhibit\nsignificant effects on judicial fairness. Accordingly, we introduce a publicly\navailable toolkit containing all datasets and code, designed to support future\nresearch in evaluating and improving LLM fairness.",

While the determination of the ``free''\nelements is usually guided by the constraints of some experimental setup, this\ncan make it difficult to study similarities and differences between QRTs. In\nthis work, we argue that QRTs follow from the choice of a preferred algebraic\nstructure $\\mathcal{E}$ to be preserved, thus setting the free operations as\nthe automorphisms of $\\mathcal{E}$. We illustrate our finding by determining\n$\\mathcal{E}$ for the QRTs of entanglement, Clifford stabilizerness, purity,\nimaginarity, fermionic Gaussianity, reference frames, thermodynamics and\ncoherence; showing instances where $\\mathcal{E}$ is a Lie algebra, group, ring,\nor even a simple set. This unified understanding allows us to generalize the\nconcept of stochastic local operations and classical communication (SLOCC) to\nidentify novel resource non-increasing operations for Lie-algebra based QRTs,\nthus finding a new solution to an open problem in the literature. We showcase\nthe sanity of our new set of operations by rigorously proving that they map\nfree states to free states, as well as determine more general situations where\nthese transformations strictly do not increase the resource of a state.",

In this paper, we examine 399 candidate\nsingle late-M dwarfs with $G - G_{RP} \\geq 1.4$ mag ($\\gtrsim$M6) using TESS\nlight curves. To determine rotation periods, we employed Lomb-Scargle\nPeriodograms to provide a first estimate of the period, then refined them with\na Gaussian Process approach, requiring multi-sector confirmation when\navailable. We found 133 rotation periods, ranging from 2 hours to 6 days, and\namplitudes between 0.08% and 2.71%. We find that the observed variability\nfraction in late-M dwarfs rises with the number of available TESS sectors,\napproaching an apparent ceiling of ~50%. This likely reflects a detection limit\ndetermined by viewing geometry and supports the idea that spot-induced\nvariability is common across the late-M and brown dwarf population. In our\ncomparison with previously published late-M dwarf rotation periods reported, we\nfound consistent results, confirming or updating 31 periods. Our findings\nexpand the number of previously known late-M dwarf periods under 1 day by 76%.\nCombined with published rotation periods for a broader range of spectral types,\nwe find a lower envelope on the rotation period decreasing from 5 hours at\nearly-M dwarfs to 1 hour at L, T, and Y dwarfs.",

To overcome these challenges, we employ Conditional\nValue-at-Risk (CVaR), a popular coherent risk measure, and establish its\nequivalence with the sum-least-$\\alpha$th-quantile (SL$\\alpha$Q) utility. This\nconnection enables an exact convex reformulation of the SL$\\alpha$Q\nmaximization problem, facilitating analytical tractability and precise and\ninterpretable control over cell-edge terminal performance. Utilizing Lagrangian\nduality, we provide (for the first time) parameterized closed-form solutions\nfor the optimal resource policy -- which is of waterfilling-type -- as well as\nthe associated (auxiliary) Value-at-Risk variable. We further develop a novel\ninexact dual subgradient descent algorithm of minimal complexity to determine\nglobally optimal resource policies, and we rigorously establish its\nconvergence. The resulting edge waterfilling algorithm iteratively and\nefficiently allocates resources while explicitly ensuring transmission rate\nfairness across (cell-edge) terminals.

It is a\nclassic problem in revenue management and finds applications across various\nindustries. However, the problem is usually NP-hard due to its combinatorial\nand non-linear nature. In this work, we explore how graph convolutional\nnetworks (GCNs) can be leveraged to efficiently solve constrained assortment\noptimization under the mixed multinomial logit choice model.

Due to the GCN's inherent ability to generalize\nacross inputs of varying sizes, we can use a GCN trained on small-scale\ninstances to facilitate large-scale instances. Extensive numerical experiments\ndemonstrate that given a GCN trained on small-scale instances (e.g., with 20\nproducts), the proposed policies can achieve superior performance (90%+\noptimality) on large-scale instances (with up to 2,000 products) within\nseconds, which outperform existing heuristic policies in both performance and\nefficiency.

    "abstract": "Ratchet effects can appear for particles interacting with an asymmetric\npotential under ac driving or for a thermal system in which a substrate is\nperiodically flashed. Here, we show that a new type of collective ratchet\neffect can arise for a pattern-forming system coupled to an asymmetric\nsubstrate when the interaction potential between the particles is periodically\noscillated in order to cycle the system through different patterns. We consider\nparticles with competing short-range attraction and long-range repulsion\nsubjected to time-dependent oscillations of the ratio between the attractive\nand repulsive interaction terms, which causes the system to cycle periodically\nbetween crystal and bubble states. In the presence of the substrate, this\nsystem exhibits both a positive and a reversed ratchet effect, and we show that\nthere is a maximum in the ratchet efficiency as a function of interaction\nstrength, ac drive frequency, and particle density. Our results could be\nrealized for a variety of pattern-forming systems on asymmetric substrates\nwhere the pattern type or particle interactions can be oscillated.",

We notice that the model predictions exceed\nLHAASO gamma-ray measurements at energies above 100 TeV. This excess can be\ninterpreted within a CR knee model assuming a \"local PeV CR bubble''.

Using over\n110 million posts from Parler (2018-2021), we observed that the number of\nupvotes a person received on a hate speech post was unassociated with the\namount of hate speech in their next post and posts during the next week, month,\nthree months, and six months. Between-person effects revealed an average\nnegative relationship between social approval and hate speech production at the\npost level, but this relationship was mixed at other time intervals. Social\napproval reinforcement mechanisms of online hate may operate differently on\nniche social media platforms.",

Most existing work on causal inference primarily focuses on\nevent types within the designated domain, without considering the impact of\nexogenous out-of-domain interventions. In real-world settings, these\nout-of-domain interventions can significantly alter causal dynamics. To address\nthis gap, we propose a new causal framework to define average treatment effect\n(ATE), beyond independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) data in classic\nRubin's causal framework, to capture the causal relation shift between events\nof temporal process under out-of-domain intervention. We design an unbiased ATE\nestimator, and devise a Transformer-based neural network model to handle both\nlong-range temporal dependencies and local patterns while integrating\nout-of-domain intervention information into process modeling. Extensive\nexperiments on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that our\nmethod outperforms baselines in ATE estimation and goodness-of-fit under\nout-of-domain-augmented point processes.",

    "abstract": "In the era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, cybersecurity and intrusion\ndetection systems are vital for the secure and reliable operation of IoT and\nIIoT environments. A key challenge in this domain is the scarcity of labeled\ncyberattack data, as most industrial systems operate under normal conditions.\nThis data imbalance, combined with the high cost of annotation, hinders the\neffective training of machine learning models. Moreover, the rapid detection of\nattacks is essential, especially in critical infrastructure, to prevent\nlarge-scale disruptions. To address these challenges, we propose a real-time\nintrusion detection system based on a semi-supervised contrastive learning\nframework using the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN). Our method leverages\nabundant unlabeled data to effectively distinguish between normal and attack\nbehaviors. We validate our approach on three benchmark datasets, UNSW-NB15,\nBoT-IoT, and Gas Pipeline, using only 2.20%, 1.28%, and 8% of labeled samples,\nrespectively, to simulate real-world conditions. Experimental results show that\nour method outperforms existing contrastive learning-based approaches. We\nfurther compare KAN with a traditional multilayer perceptron (MLP),\ndemonstrating KAN's superior performance in both detection accuracy and\nrobustness under limited supervision. KAN's ability to model complex\nrelationships, along with its learnable activation functions, is also explored\nand visualized, offering interpretability and the potential for rule\nextraction.

To this end, we\npost-process the simulations with ionizing radiative transfer and perform Monte\nCarlo Lyman-$\\alpha$ (Lya) transfer calculations.

In FWI,\napproximations of the inverse of the Hessian may be used as preconditioners for\nNewton-type or quasi-Newton algorithms, reducing computational costs and\nimproving recovery in deeper subsurface regions. In Bayesian UQ, Hessian\napproximations enable the construction of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\nproposals that capture the directional scalings of the posterior, enhancing the\nefficiency of MCMC. Computing the exact Hessian is intractable for large-scale\nproblems because the Hessian is accessible only through matrix-vector products,\nand performing each matrix-vector product requires costly solution of wave\nequations. Moreover, the Hessian is high-rank, which means that low-rank\nmethods, often employed in large-scale inverse problems, are inefficient. We\nadapt two existing high-rank Hessian approximations -- the point spread\nfunction method and the pseudo-differential operator probing method. Building\non an observed duality between these approaches, we develop a novel method that\nunifies their complementary strengths. We validate these methods on a synthetic\nquadratic model and on the Marmousi model. Numerical experiments show that\nthese high-rank Hessian approximations substantially reduce the computational\ncosts in FWI. In UQ, MCMC samples computed using no Hessian approximation or a\nlow-rank approximation explore the posterior slowly, providing little\nmeaningful statistical information after tens of thousands of iterations and\nunderestimating the variance. At the same time, the effective sample size is\noverestimated, providing false confidence.

For interventions targeting\nhabitual behavior (e.g., oral hygiene), effectiveness often hinges on\ndelivering support shortly before the target behavior is likely to occur.\nCurrent practice schedules decision points at a fixed interval (e.g., one hour)\nbefore user-provided behavior times, and the fixed interval is kept the same\nfor all individuals. However, this one-size-fits-all approach performs poorly\nfor individuals with irregular routines, often scheduling decision points after\nthe target behavior has already occurred, rendering interventions ineffective.\nIn this paper, we propose SigmaScheduling, a method to dynamically schedule\ndecision points based on uncertainty in predicted behavior times. When behavior\ntiming is more predictable, SigmaScheduling schedules decision points closer to\nthe predicted behavior time; when timing is less certain, SigmaScheduling\nschedules decision points earlier, increasing the likelihood of timely\nintervention.

    "abstract": "Understanding the dynamics of antibody levels is crucial for characterizing\nthe time-dependent response to immune events: either infections or\nvaccinations. The sequence and timing of these events significantly influence\nantibody level changes. Despite extensive interest in the topic in the recent\nyears and many experimental studies, the effect of immune event sequences on\nantibody levels is not well understood. Moreover, disease or vaccination\nprevalence in the population are time-dependent. This, alongside the\ncomplexities of personal antibody kinetics, makes it difficult to analyze a\nsample immune measurement from a population. As a solution, we design a\nrigorous mathematical characterization in terms of a time-inhomogeneous Markov\nchain model for event-to-event transitions coupled with a probabilistic\nframework for the post-event antibody kinetics of multiple immune events. We\ndemonstrate that this is an ideal model for immune event sequences, referred to\nas personal trajectories. This novel modeling framework surpasses the\nsusceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) characterizations by rigorously tracking\nthe probability distribution of population antibody response across time. To\nillustrate our ideas, we apply our mathematical framework to longitudinal\nsevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) data from\nindividuals with multiple documented infection and vaccination events. Our work\nis an important step towards a comprehensive understanding of antibody kinetics\nthat could lead to an effective way to analyze the protective power of natural\nimmunity or vaccination, predict missed immune events at an individual level,\nand inform booster timing recommendations.",

While recent\nstudies have introduced some methods to improve prediction performance, these\napproaches still face a significant challenge in handling long-term\nextrapolation tasks under such complex scenarios. To overcome this challenge,\nwe propose Phy-SSM, a generalizable method that integrates partial physics\nknowledge into state space models (SSMs) for long-term dynamics forecasting in\ncomplex environments. Our motivation is that SSMs can effectively capture\nlong-range dependencies in sequential data and model continuous dynamical\nsystems, while the incorporation of physics knowledge improves generalization\nability. The key challenge lies in how to seamlessly incorporate partially\nknown physics into SSMs. To achieve this, we decompose partially known system\ndynamics into known and unknown state matrices, which are integrated into a\nPhy-SSM unit. To further enhance long-term prediction performance, we introduce\na physics state regularization term to make the estimated latent states align\nwith system dynamics. Besides, we theoretically analyze the uniqueness of the\nsolutions for our method. Extensive experiments on three real-world\napplications, including vehicle motion prediction, drone state prediction, and\nCOVID-19 epidemiology forecasting, demonstrate the superior performance of\nPhy-SSM over the baselines in both long-term interpolation and extrapolation\ntasks.

    "abstract": "Storage and retrieval refer to the task of encoding an unknown quantum\nchannel $\\Lambda$ into a quantum state, known as the program state, such that\nthe channel can later be retrieved. There are two strategies for this task:\nclassical and quantum strategies. The classical strategy uses multiple queries\nto $\\Lambda$ to estimate $\\Lambda$ and retrieves the channel based on the\nestimate represented in classical bits. The classical strategy turns out to\noffer the optimal performance for the storage and retrieval of unitary\nchannels. In this work, we analyze the asymptotic performance of the classical\nand quantum strategies for the storage and retrieval of isometry channels. We\nshow that the optimal fidelity for isometry estimation is given by $F =\n1-{d(D-d)\\over n} + O(n^{-2})$, where $d$ and $D$ denote the input and output\ndimensions of the isometry, and $n$ is the number of queries. This result\nindicates that, unlike in the case of unitary channels, the classical strategy\nis suboptimal for the storage and retrieval of isometry channels, which\nrequires $n = \\Theta(\\epsilon^{-1})$ to achieve the diamond-norm error\n$\\epsilon$. We propose a more efficient quantum strategy based on port-based\nteleportation, which stores the isometry channel in a program state using only\n$n = \\Theta(1/\\sqrt{\\epsilon})$ queries, achieving a quadratic improvement over\nthe classical strategy. As an application, we extend our approach to general\nquantum channels, achieving improved program cost compared to prior results by\nGschwendtner, Bluhm, and Winter [Quantum 5, 488 (2021)].",

The LF formulation provides an alternative computational\napproach to lattice gauge theory, and has recently been investigated as a\nfuture application of quantum computers. A natural question is how quantum\nresources such as entanglement and contextuality amongst physical qubits in the\nlaboratory are utilized in LF simulations of QFTs. We use the (1+1)D\ntransverse-field Ising model to explore this question. We derive the LF energy\noperator that generates the LF dynamics of the system, which is distinct from\nthe instant-form (IF) Hamiltonian. We find that while the eigenstates of the IF\nHamiltonian exhibit pairwise entanglement between positive and negative momenta\nin IF momentum-space, the eigenstates of the LF Hamiltonian are separable in LF\nmomentum-space. We then calculate the momentum-space magic of the\nIF-momentum-space ground state and show that it always requires more magic to\nprepare than the LF-momentum-space ground state. At the quantum critical point,\ncorresponding to a massless free fermion, both LF and IF ground states are\nstabilizers, but the LF ground state is separable in LF momentum-space while\nthe IF ground state is a product of maximally entangled pairs in IF\nmomentum-space. These results show that quantum resources such as entanglement\nand magic are utilized differently by quantum simulations formulated in LF and\nIF, and that the simplicity of the LF ground state results in fewer required\nquantum resources.",

Existing weighting methods\neither assume positivity holds or produce effects that conflate interventions'\nimpacts on ultimate outcomes with their effects on intermediate treatments and\ncovariates. We propose a novel class of estimands -- cumulative cross-world\nweighted effects -- that weights potential outcome differences using propensity\nscores adapting to positivity violations cumulatively across timepoints and\nsimultaneously across both counterfactual treatment histories. This new\nestimand isolates mechanistic differences between treatment regimes, is\nidentifiable without positivity assumptions, and circumvents the limitations of\nexisting longitudinal methods. Further, our analysis reveals two fundamental\ninsights about longitudinal causal inference under positivity violations.\nFirst, while mechanistically meaningful, these effects correspond to\nnon-implementable interventions, exposing a core\ninterpretability-implementability tradeoff. Second, the identified effects\nfaithfully capture mechanistic differences only under a partial common support\nassumption; violations cause the identified functional to collapse to zero,\neven when the causal effect is non-zero. We develop doubly robust-style\nestimators that achieve asymptotic normality and parametric convergence under\nnonparametric assumptions on the nuisance estimators.

We start by analyzing the dynamics of the Pauli coefficients\ntracked in the Heisenberg picture. In addition to surprisingly generic\nconvergence features of the Pauli coefficient distributions, we find certain\nregularities that allow for extrapolation of memory and runtime requirements\nfor smaller and smaller coefficient truncation parameter $\\delta$. We then\nintroduce a framework for understanding convergence in the absence of rigorous\nerror guarantees on PPS. Combined with runtime analysis, we propose bifurcating\nquantum simulation problems broadly into two classes, based on whether there is\napparent convergence of expectation values as a function of $\\delta$. This\nserves as a way for practitioners to understand where their problem falls on\nthe frontier of classical simulability. In the case without apparent\nconvergence, PPS may still serve useful as a Monte Carlo-like estimate. Applied\nto IBM's utility-scale experiments, we show parameter regimes where both\nbehaviors are realized. Some of our key findings challenge conventional\nintuition: reducing $\\delta$ does not always improve accuracy, and deeper\nquantum circuits may actually be easier to simulate than shallower ones. The\nBlueQubit SDK implementing these methods has been released publicly, offering\nresearchers a comprehensive toolkit for evaluating this frontier classical\nsimulation approach.

While this\ncould be evidence that the primordial cold classical disk with FaintIR surfaces\nwas broader in the past by ~3 au in the sunward direction, we cannot rule out\nthe alternative explanation that these FaintIR plutinos were scattered from the\n~42.5-48 au region from the Sun and captured into the 3:2 resonance.",

While typically produced in interactions involving charged\nparticles, they could also originate from exotic sources such as annihilations\nof magnetically charged monopole-antimonopole pairs or decays of highly\naccelerated monopoles (10^{21} eV). Detecting such photons would impose\nconstraints on monopole properties. Despite strong theoretical motivations and\nextensive experimental searches, no monopoles have been observed to date. A\npossible explanation beyond high monopole masses arises from Staruszkiewicz's\nquantum theory of infrared electromagnetic fields.

An ethical (and evaluative) challenge facing FER\nalgorithms is that they tend to perform poorly for people of some races and\nskin colors. These challenges are linked to the data collection practices\nemployed in the creation of FER datasets. In this study, we audit two\nstate-of-the-art FER datasets.

It is assumed that particle-antiparticle pair creation\noccurs; however, the system is simultaneously subject to exact charge (isospin)\nconservation. To implement this constraint, we first consider the system within\nthe Grand Canonical Ensemble and then transform to the Canonical Ensemble using\na Legendre transformation. This procedure provides a formally consistent scheme\nfor incorporating the chemical potential at the microscopic level into the\nCanonical Ensemble framework. To enforce exact conservation of charge (isospin,\nN_I), we further analyze the thermodynamic properties of the system within the\nextended Canonical Ensemble, in which the chemical potential becomes a\nthermodynamic function of the temperature and conserved charge. It is shown\nthat as the temperature decreases, the system undergoes a second-order phase\ntransition to a Bose-Einstein condensate at the critical temperature T_c, but\nonly when the conserved charge is finite, N_I=const \\ne 0. In a\nparticle-antiparticle system, the condensate forms exclusively in the component\nwith the dominant particle number density, which determines the excess charge.\nWe demonstrate that the symmetry breaking of the ground state at T=0 results\nfrom a first-order phase transition associated with the formation of a\nBose-Einstein condensate. Although the transition involves symmetry breaking,\nit is not spontaneous in the strict field-theoretic sense, but is instead\ninduced by the external injection of particles. Potential experimental signals\nof Bose-Einstein condensation of pions produced in high-energy nuclear\ncollisions are briefly discussed.",

This has sparked\nsignificant investment and interest, particularly in building data centers with\nthe necessary hardware and software to develop and operate AI models and\nAI-based workflows. In this technical review article, we present energy\nconsumption scenarios of data centers and impact on GHG emissions, considering\nboth near-term projections (up to 2030) and long-term outlook (2035 and\nbeyond). We address the quintessential question of whether AI will have a net\npositive, neutral, or negative impact on CO2 emissions by 2035. Additionally,\nwe discuss AI's potential to automate, create efficient and disruptive\nworkflows across various fields related to energy production, supply and\nconsumption. In the near-term scenario, the growing demand for AI will likely\nstrain computing resources, lead to increase in electricity consumption and\ntherefore associated CO2 emissions. This is due to the power-hungry nature of\nbig data centers and the requirements for training and running of large and\ncomplex AI models, as well as the penetration of AI assistant search and\napplications for public use. However, the long-term outlook could be more\npromising. AI has the potential to be a game-changer in CO2 reduction. Its\nability to further automate and optimize processes across industries, from\nenergy production to logistics, could significantly decrease our carbon\nfootprint. This positive impact is anticipated to outweigh the initial\nemissions bump, creating value for businesses and society in areas where\ntraditional solutions have fallen short.

Emerging neuromorphic architectures aim to combine traditional\ndigital designs with the computational efficiency of analog computing and novel\ndevice technologies. A crucial problem in the rapid exploration and co-design\nof such architectures is the lack of tools for fast and accurate modeling and\nsimulation. Typical mixed-signal design tools integrate a digital simulator\nwith an analog solver like SPICE, which is prohibitively slow for large\nsystems. By contrast, behavioral modeling of analog components is faster, but\nexisting approaches are fixed to specific architectures with limited energy and\nperformance modeling. In this paper, we propose LASANA, a novel approach that\nleverages machine learning to derive data-driven surrogate models of analog\nsub-blocks in a digital backend architecture. LASANA uses SPICE-level\nsimulations of a circuit to train ML models that predict circuit energy,\nperformance, and behavior at analog/digital interfaces. Such models can provide\nenergy and performance annotation on top of existing behavioral models or\nfunction as replacements to analog simulation. We apply LASANA to an analog\ncrossbar array and a spiking neuron circuit.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have spurred interest in\nnumerous applications requiring robust long-range capabilities, essential for\nprocessing extensive input contexts and continuously generating extended\noutputs. As sequence lengths increase, the number of Key-Value (KV) pairs in\nLLMs escalates, creating a significant efficiency bottleneck. In this paper, we\npropose a new KV cache optimization paradigm called LaCache, a training-free\nmethod for efficient and accurate generative inference of LLMs. LaCache enables\nLLMs to simultaneously address both of the critical challenges in long-range\nmodeling: robust long-range capabilities and continuous generation without\nrunning out-of-memory (OOM). Specifically, LaCache integrates two key\ninnovations: (1) a ladder-shaped KV cache pattern that stores KV pairs not only\nsequentially (left-to-right within each layer) but also across layers (from\nshallow to deep), providing an extended span for capturing long-range\ndependencies under a fixed storage budget, thereby boosting long-range\ncapabilities; and (2) an iterative compaction mechanism that progressively\ncompresses older caches, freeing up space for new tokens within a fixed cache\nsize. This token distance-based dynamic compression enables more effective\ncontinuous generation under constrained cache budgets. Experiments across\nvarious tasks, benchmarks, and LLM models consistently validate LaCache's\neffectiveness in enhancing LLMs' long-range capabilities.

    "abstract": "Sex trafficking refers to the use of force, fraud, or coercion to compel an\nindividual to perform in commercial sex acts against their will. Adult service\nwebsites (ASWs) have and continue to be linked to sex trafficking, offering a\nplatform for traffickers to advertise their victims. Thus, organizations\ninvolved in the fight against sex trafficking often use ASW data when\nattempting to identify potential sex trafficking victims. A critical challenge\nin transforming ASW data into actionable insight is text analysis. Previous\nresearch using ASW data has shown that ASW ad text is important for linking\nads. However, working with this text is challenging due to its extensive use of\nemojis, poor grammar, and deliberate obfuscation to evade law enforcement\nscrutiny. We conduct a comprehensive study of language modeling approaches for\nthis application area, including simple information retrieval methods,\npre-trained transformers, and custom transformer models. We demonstrate that\ncharacteristics of ASW text data allow efficient custom transformer models to\nbe trained with relatively small GPU resources and used efficiently for\ninference on consumer hardware. Our custom models outperform fine-tuned\nvariants of well-known encoder-only transformer models, including BERT-base,\nRoBERTa, and ModernBERT, on accuracy, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC. We\ndemonstrate the use of our best-performing custom configuration on three tasks\nrelated to ASW data analysis: (i) decomposing the giant component in a graph\nrepresentation of ASW data, (ii) clustering ASW ad text, and (iii) using the\nlearned token embeddings to understand the use of emojis in the illicit context\nwe study.

However, because of the high level of\nmeasurement noise, current reconstruction methods still leave room for\nimprovement. Furthermore, reconstruction efforts typically focus only on a\nsingle aspect of the signal, such as the energy fluence or arrival time.\nBayesian inference is then a natural choice for a holistic approach to\nreconstruction, yet, this problem would be ill-posed, since the electric field\nis a continuous quantity. Information Field Theory provides the solution for\nthis by providing a statistical framework to deal with discretised fields in\nthe continuum limit. We are currently developing models for this novel approach\nto reconstructing extensive air showers. The model described here is based on\nthe best current understanding of the emission mechanisms: It uses\nparametrisations of the lateral signal strength distribution, charge-excess\ncontribution and spectral shape. Shower-to-shower fluctuations and narrowband\nRFI are modelled using Gaussian processes. Combined with a detailed detector\ndescription, this model can infer not only the electric field, but also the\nshower geometry, electromagnetic energy and position of shower maximum. Another\nbig achievement of this approach is its ability to naturally provide\nuncertainties for the reconstruction, which has been shown to be difficult in\nmore traditional methods. With such an open framework and robust computational\nmethods based in Information Field Theory, it will also be easy to incorporate\nnew insights and additional data, such as timing distributions or particle\ndetector data, in the future. This approach has a high potential to exploit the\nfull information content of a complex detector with rigorous statistical\nmethods, in a way that directly includes domain knowledge.",

First, we extend the finite,\nnonlocal quantum field theories to derive a modified Bethe--Salpeter equation\nfor heavy quark--antiquark bound states, incorporating exponential regulator\nfunctions that render all loop amplitudes UV finite. We show that nonlocal\npropagators induce characteristic shifts in the resonance mass and width, which\ncan be contrasted directly with LHC data. By fixing the nonlocal regulator\nscale in the strong sector, our framework yields a prediction of an $\\approx\n8.3\\,\\mathrm{pb}$ enhancement, in excellent agreement with the CMS measurement\nof $8.8 \\pm 1.3\\,\\mathrm{pb}$. We analyze the renormalization group flow of the\nstrong coupling near the top--pair threshold, introducing a holomorphic\ndeformation inspired by unified field--theoretic constructions. We find that\nthe modified $\\beta$-function softens the running of $\\alpha_s$, giving an\nenhancement of the threshold cross-section. Third, we present a systematic\ncomparison of charmonium, bottomonium, and toponium, quantifying differences in\nbinding energies, lifetimes, and production signatures. In particular, the top\nquark's large width precludes long-lived bound states, so that toponium appears\nonly as a transient threshold resonance.

Attempts to extend Scarf's celebrated distribution-free ordering\nrule using risk measures have led to conflicting prescriptions: CVaR-based\nmodels invariably recommend ordering less as risk aversion increases, while\nmean-standard deviation models -- paradoxically -- suggest ordering more,\nparticularly when ordering costs are high. We resolve this behavioral paradox\nthrough a coherent generalization of Scarf's distribution-free framework,\nmodeling risk aversion via distortion functionals from dual utility theory.\nDespite the generality of this class, we derive closed-form optimal ordering\nrules for any coherent risk preference. These rules uncover a consistent\nbehavioral principle: a more risk-averse newsvendor may rationally order more\nwhen overstocking is inexpensive (i.e., when the cost-to-price ratio is low),\nbut will always order less when ordering is costly. Our framework offers a more\nnuanced, managerially intuitive, and behaviorally coherent understanding of\nrisk-averse inventory decisions. It exposes the limitations of non-coherent\nmodels, delivers interpretable and easy-to-compute ordering rules grounded in\ncoherent preferences, and unifies prior work under a single, tractable\napproach.

During\ninference, the model maintains high accuracy on benign samples but\nmisclassifies poisoned samples into an attacker-specified target class.\nExisting research on backdoor attacks has explored developing triggers in the\nspatial, spectral (frequency), and semantic (feature) domains, aiming to make\nthem stealthy. While some approaches have considered designing triggers that\nare imperceptible in both spatial and spectral domains, few have incorporated\nthe semantic domain. In this paper, we propose a novel backdoor attack, termed\n3S-attack, which is stealthy across the spatial, spectral, and semantic\ndomains. The key idea is to exploit the semantic features of benign samples as\ntriggers, using Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) and a\npreliminary model for extraction. The trigger is then embedded in the spectral\ndomain, followed by pixel-level restrictions after converting the samples back\nto the spatial domain. This process minimizes the distance between poisoned and\nbenign samples, making the attack harder to detect by existing defenses and\nhuman inspection. Extensive experiments on various datasets, along with\ntheoretical analysis, demonstrate the stealthiness of 3S-attack and highlight\nthe need for stronger defenses to ensure AI security.

Just-in-time vulnerability prediction (JIT-VP)\nis a proactive approach to identifying vulnerable commits and providing early\nwarnings about potential security risks. However, we observe that current\nJIT-VP evaluations rely on an idealized setting, where the evaluation datasets\nare artificially balanced, consisting exclusively of vulnerability-introducing\nand vulnerability-fixing commits. To address this limitation, this study\nassesses the effectiveness of JIT-VP techniques under a more realistic setting\nthat includes both vulnerability-related and vulnerability-neutral commits. To\nenable a reliable evaluation, we introduce a large-scale public dataset\ncomprising over one million commits from FFmpeg and the Linux kernel. Our\nempirical analysis of eight state-of-the-art JIT-VP techniques reveals a\nsignificant decline in predictive performance when applied to real-world\nconditions; for example, the average PR-AUC on Linux drops 98% from 0.805 to\n0.016. This discrepancy is mainly attributed to the severe class imbalance in\nreal-world datasets, where vulnerability-introducing commits constitute only a\nsmall fraction of all commits. To mitigate this issue, we explore the\neffectiveness of widely adopted techniques for handling dataset imbalance,\nincluding customized loss functions, oversampling, and undersampling.\nSurprisingly, our experimental results indicate that these techniques are\nineffective in addressing the imbalance problem in JIT-VP. These findings\nunderscore the importance of realistic evaluations of JIT-VP and the need for\ndomain-specific techniques to address data imbalance in such scenarios.",

EDR-MQ is based on the insight\nthat strongly related documents often co-occur in results across diverse user\nqueries, enabling us to estimate joint probabilities between document pairs by\nmarginalizing over a collection of queries. To enable this query\nmarginalization approach, we develop Multiply Conditioned Retrieval-Augmented\nGeneration (MC-RAG), which employs conditional retrieval where subsequent\ndocument retrievals depend on previously retrieved content. By observing\nco-occurrence patterns across diverse queries, EDR-MQ estimates joint\nprobabilities between document pairs without requiring labeled training data or\npredefined taxonomies. Experimental results show that our query marginalization\napproach successfully identifies meaningful document relationships, revealing\ntopical clusters, evidence chains, and cross-domain connections that are not\napparent through traditional similarity-based methods.

    "authors": [

    ],
    "abstract": "Context. The Dust Settling Instabilty (DSI) is a member of the Resonant Drag\nInstabilities (RDI) family, and is thus related to the Streaming Instability\n(SI). Linear calculations found that the unstratified monodisperse DSI has\ngrowth rates much higher than the SI even with lower initial dust to gas\nratios. However, recent nonlinear investigation found no evidence of strong\ndust clumping at the saturation level. Aims. To investigate the nonlinear\nsaturation of the mono- and polydisperse DSI. We examine the convergence\nbehaviour wrt. both the numerical resolution and the number of species. By\ncharacterising the morphology of the dust evolution triggered by the DSI, we\ncan shed more light on its role in planetesimal formation. Methods. We perform\na suite of 2D shearing box hydro simulations with the code Idefix, both in the\nmono- and polydisperse regimes. We focus on the time evolution of the maximum\ndust density, noting the time at which the instability is triggered, as well as\nanalyse the morphology of the resultant structure. Results. In our monodisperse\nsimulations, the maximum dust density increases and the instability saturates\nearlier with higher spatial resolution, with no signs of convergence. The\npolydisperse simulations do seem to converge with the number of species and\nproduce maximum dust densities that are comparable to, albeit lower than, the\nmonodisperse simulations. Different dust species tend to form adjacent but\nseparate dust filaments, which may have implications on dust growth and further\nclumping. Conclusions. The monodisperse DSI produces dust structure at\ndensities high enough that likely leads to clumping. The polydisperse DSI\nproduces lower but comparable dust densities. Our idealised treatment suggests\nthat the DSI is important for planetesimal formation, as it suffers less than\nthe SI from including a dust size distribution.",

    "abstract": "Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) provides a framework for\ndecision-making under distributional uncertainty, yet its effectiveness can be\ncompromised by outliers in the training data. This paper introduces a\nprincipled approach to simultaneously address both challenges. We focus on\noptimizing Wasserstein-1 DRO objectives for generalized linear models with\nconvex Lipschitz loss functions, where an $\\epsilon$-fraction of the training\ndata is adversarially corrupted. Our primary contribution lies in a novel\nmodeling framework that integrates robustness against training data\ncontamination with robustness against distributional shifts, alongside an\nefficient algorithm inspired by robust statistics to solve the resulting\noptimization problem. We prove that our method achieves an estimation error of\n$O(\\sqrt{\\epsilon})$ for the true DRO objective value using only the\ncontaminated data under the bounded covariance assumption. This work\nestablishes the first rigorous guarantees, supported by efficient computation,\nfor learning under the dual challenges of data contamination and distributional\nshifts.",

In this work, we merge the approach with the so-called\nauxiliary master equation approach. As benchmark, we first show that our\napproach reproduces the results of quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) for two-orbital\nimpurity models at equilibrium with overall good accuracy, especially for\nnon-degenerate orbitals. We then use our approach as impurity solver for\ndynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) to address the case of a two-orbital,\nrealistic layered structure, recovering the strong crystal-field-driven charge\npolarization observed by solving the DMFT self-consistent cycle with QMC,\nalbeit slightly reduced. Finally, we address a prototype nonequilibrium setup\nby sandwiching this layer between metallic contacts subject to a bias voltage\ndescribed by different chemical potentials. This simplified model demonstrates\nout method's potential to access nonequilibrium steady-state behavior of\nmulti-orbital, realistic materials. These findings provide a first-step basis\nfor theoretical studies of nonequilibrium properties of multi-orbital compounds\ndirectly in the real frequency domain.",

Our analysis employs a full-band continuum\nmodel to capture the relevant physical phenomena. We focus on how electron\nenergy, magnetic field strength, and the geometric characteristics of the\nbarrier affect the transmission and conductance. We observe sharp resonant\ntunneling features emerging from quantum interference effects induced by\nmagnetic confinement. A key outcome of our study is the discovery of distinct\nresonance patterns in the conduction and valence bands. These patterns are\nclosely related to the intrinsic spin-orbit coupling in MoS$_2$ and the\nbreaking of time-reversal symmetry by the magnetic field. This results in\nsignificant spin and valley selectivity in electron transport. We demonstrate\nthat adjusting external parameters precisely controls spin-polarized and\nvalley-polarized currents. We show that a magnetic barrier can control electron\nspin and valley in MoS$_2$, making it a promising platform for energy-efficient\nspintronic and valleytronic devices.",

    "abstract": "Spectroscopic anomaly detection and isotope identification algorithms are\nintegral components in nuclear nonproliferation applications such as search\noperations. The task is especially challenging in the case of mobile detector\nsystems due to the fact that the observed gamma-ray background changes more\nthan for a static detector system, and a pretrained background model can easily\nfind itself out of domain. The result is that algorithms may exceed their\nintended false alarm rate, or sacrifice detection sensitivity in order to\nmaintain the desired false alarm rate. Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF)\nhas been shown to be a powerful tool for spectral anomaly detection and\nidentification, but, like many similar algorithms that rely on data-driven\nbackground models, in its conventional implementation it is unable to update in\nreal time to account for environmental changes that affect the background\nspectroscopic signature. We have developed a novel NMF-based algorithm that\nperiodically updates its background model to accommodate changing environmental\nconditions. The Adaptive NMF algorithm involves fewer assumptions about its\nenvironment, making it more generalizable than existing NMF-based methods while\nmaintaining or exceeding detection performance on simulated and real-world\ndatasets.",

We introduce a neural-surrogate\n(neural-network--based approximation of the posterior distribution) framework\nthat predicts the coefficients of known covariate-dependent rate functions\ndirectly from noisy, partially observed token trajectories. Our model employs a\nlightweight 1D Convolutional Residual Network trained end-to-end on\nGillespie-simulated SPN realizations, learning to invert system dynamics under\nrealistic conditions of event dropout. During inference, Monte Carlo dropout\nprovides calibrated uncertainty bounds together with point estimates. On\nsynthetic SPNs with 20% missing events, our surrogate recovers rate-function\ncoefficients with an RMSE = 0.108 and substantially runs faster than\ntraditional Bayesian approaches. These results demonstrate that data-driven,\nlikelihood-free surrogates can enable accurate, robust, and real-time parameter\nrecovery in complex, partially observed discrete-event systems.",

For turbines experiencing\nstall-flutter instability, the influence of gravity on performance metrics is\nminimal when inertial forces dominate or are comparable to gravitational\nforces. At high Froude numbers, buoyancy and weight are negligible, but their\nimpact increases at lower Froude numbers, leading to reduced performance.\nConversely, turbines operating through coupled-flutter instability seem\nunsuitable for horizontal configurations since they require high foil moment of\ninertia and mass, which amplifies the effects of buoyancy and weight, thereby\ndiminishing performance at any Froude number.",

We first\ncompute a locality graph on d-simplices, using the dihedral angle in between\nadjacent simplices as the graph weights, and then compute infinity path\ndistances in this simplex graph. This procedure gives a metric on simplices\nwhich we refer to as the largest angle path distance (LAPD). We analyze the\nproperties of LAPD under random sampling, and prove that with an appropriate\ndenoising procedure, this metric separates the manifold components with high\nprobability. We validate the proposed methodology with extensive numerical\nexperiments on both synthetic and real-world data sets. These experiments\ndemonstrate that the method is robust to noise, curvature, and small\nintersection angle, and generally out-performs other MMC algorithms. In\naddition, we provide a highly scalable implementation of the proposed\nalgorithm, which leverages approximation schemes for infinity path distance to\nachieve quasi-linear computational complexity.",

They play an important role in areas\nsuch as coding theory, optimization, and combinatorial geometry, where linear\nstructure is crucial for both theoretical insights and algorithmic\napplications. Since deciding skew-representability is computationally\nintractable, much effort has been focused on identifying necessary or\nsufficient conditions for a matroid to be skew-representable.\n  In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to studying\nskew-representability and structural properties of matroids and polymatroid\nfunctions via tensor products. We provide a characterization of\nskew-representable matroids, as well as of those representable over skew fields\nof a given prime characteristic, in terms of tensor products. As an algorithmic\nconsequence, we show that deciding skew-representability, or representability\nover a skew field of fixed prime characteristic, is co-recursively enumerable:\nthat is, certificates of non-skew-representability -- in general or over a\nfixed prime characteristic -- can be verified. We also prove that every rank-3\nmatroid admits a tensor product with any uniform matroid and give a\nconstruction yielding the unique freest tensor product in this setting.\nFinally, as an application of the tensor product framework, we give a new proof\nof Ingleton's inequality and, more importantly, derive the first known linear\nrank inequality for folded skew-representable matroids that does not follow\nfrom the common information property.",

    "abstract": "In this study we introduce a symbolic dataset composed of non-metric Iranian\nclassical music, and algorithms for structural parsing of this music, and\ngeneration of variations. The corpus comprises MIDI files and data sheets of\nDastgah Shour from Radif Mirza Abdollah, the foundational repertoire of Iranian\nclassical music. Furthermore, we apply our previously-introduced algorithm for\nparsing melodic structure (Kanani et al., 2023b)to the dataset. Unlike much\nWestern music, this type of non-metric music does not follow bar-centric\norganisation. The non-metric organisation can be captured well by our parsing\nalgorithm. We parse each tune (Gusheh) into a grammar to identify motifs and\nphrases. These grammar representations can be useful for educational and\nethnomusicological purposes. We also further develop a previously-introduced\nmethod of creating melodic variations (Kanani et al., 2023b). After parsing an\nexisting tune to produce a grammar, by applying mutations to this grammar, we\ngenerate a new grammar. Expanding this new version yields a variation of the\noriginal tune. Variations are assessed by a domain-expert listener.\nAdditionally, we conduct a statistical analysis of mutation with different\nrepresentation setups for our parsing and generation algorithms. The\noverarching conclusion is that the system successfully produces acceptable\nvariations post-mutation. While our case study focuses on Iranian classical\nmusic, the methodology can be adapted for Arabic or Turkish classical music.",

    ],
    "abstract": "Disordered pinning models are statistical mechanics models built on discrete\nrenewal processes: renewal epochs in this context are called contacts. It is\nwell known that pinning models can undergo a localization/delocalization phase\ntransition: in the localized phase the typical density of contacts is positive\nand the largest gap between contacts is at most of the order of the logarithm\nof the size $n$ of the system, whereas the system is void of contacts in the\ndelocalized phase. When disorder is absent and the phase transition is\ndiscontinuous, conditioning the contact density to be positive but smaller than\nthe minimum typical density in the localized phase has the effect of forcing to\ncreate one, and only one, macroscopic gap between two contacts, while the rest\nof the configuration keeps the characteristics of a localized state. However it\nis known that, in the presence of (bounded) disorder, this big jump phenomenon\nis no longer observed, in the sense that the largest gap in the conditioned\nsystem is $o(n)$. Under minimal integrability conditions on the disorder we\nshow that the conditioned system is localized in a very strong sense, in\nparticular the largest gap is $O(\\log n)$. The proof is achieved by exploiting\nthe improved understanding of the localized phase of disordered pinning models\ndeveloped in [34] and by establishing some refined estimates, in particular a\nquenched Local Central Limit Theorem. We also present an analysis of the effect\nof disorder on the large deviation rate function of the contact density and, as\nan important ingredient for the generality of our results, we establish a\nsmoothing inequality for pinning models under minimal integrability conditions,\nthus generalizing [11,32].",

    "abstract": "Two-fold redundant sparse arrays (TFRAs) are designed to maintain accurate\ndirection estimation even in the event of a single sensor failure, leveraging\nthe deliberate coarray redundancy infused into their design. Robust Minimum\nRedundancy Arrays (RMRAs), a specialized class of TFRAs, optimize this\nredundancy to achieve the maximum possible aperture for a given number of\nsensors. However, finding optimal RMRA configurations is an NP-hard problem,\nwith prior research reporting optimal solutions only for arrays of up to ten\nsensors. This paper presents newly discovered optimal RMRA configurations for\narray sizes 11 to 15, identified using a novel Leap-on-Success exhaustive\nsearch algorithm that efficiently reduces computational effort by terminating\nthe search upon locating optimal solutions. The robustness of these arrays was\nvalidated under all single-element failure scenarios using MATLAB simulations,\nconfirming their superior resilience compared to some existing TFRAs vulnerable\nto failures at specific sensor positions. Furthermore, near-optimal\nconfigurations for array sizes 16 to 20 are also reported, highlighting the\npotential applicability of the proposed method for larger array designs given\nsufficient computational resources. This work not only advances the\nstate-of-the-art in RMRA design but also introduces an effective search\nmethodology that can be leveraged for future explorations in array\nconfiguration optimization.",

In this\nwork, we expand these ideas to the space of Pfaffians, a wave-function that\nnaturally expresses superconducting pairings, and propose the hidden fermion\nPfaffian state (HFPS), which flexibly represents both unpaired and\nsuperconducting phases and scales to large systems with favorable asymptotic\ncomplexity. In our numerical experiments, HFPS provides state-of-the-art\nvariational accuracy in different regimes of both the attractive and repulsive\nHubbard models.

    "abstract": "Seasonally adjusted series are usually used to analyse the business cycle and\nturning points. When the irregular is too high, it is preferable to smooth the\nseries in order to analyse the trend-cycle component directly. This study\nfocuses on the real-time estimation of the trend-cycle component around shocks\nand turning points. The linear moving averages classically used for estimating\nthe trend-cycle, which are sensitive to the presence of atypical points, are\ncompared with robust non-linear methods. We also propose a methodology for\nextending the Henderson and Musgrave moving averages to take account of\nexternal information and thus construct moving averages that are robust to the\npresence of certain shocks. We describe how to estimate confidence intervals\nfor estimates derived from moving averages, thereby validating the use of these\nnew moving averages. By comparing the methods on simulated and real series, we\nshow that: building robust moving averages makes it possible to reduce\nrevisions and better model turning points around shocks, without degrading the\nestimates when no shock is observed; robust non-linear methods do not make it\npossible to extract a trend-cycle component that is satisfactory for economic\nanalysis, with sometimes significant revisions.

While NSI have been widely explored through\noscillation and scattering experiments, as well as in cosmological and\nastrophysical contexts, we focus on probing them at future lepton colliders\nlike the ILC, CLIC, and FCC-$ee$. If NSI arise from heavy mediators above the\nelectroweak scale, these colliders can offer superior sensitivity compared to\nneutrino experiments across a broad mass range. A notable outcome is that\nlepton collider data can help resolve parameter degeneracies seen in\noscillation studies.

However, interpreting\nthese lines is complicated by factors including sample and data bias, mismatch\nbetween resolved calibrations and unresolved observations, limitations in\ngeneralizing from case studies, and unresolved issues like the origin of [C II]\nemission and the so-called ``deficit.''In this series of papers, we assemble\nand analyze the most comprehensive atlas of FSL data to date. We explore their\nempirical correlations (paper I), compare them with photoionization models that\ncover multiphase gas (paper II), and discuss their physical origins and the new\nperspectives they offer for studying physical properties (paper III). The first\npaper introduces value-added catalogs of global FSL data of low- and high-z\ngalaxies compiled from the literature, covering most of the existing\nobservations, supplemented with ancillary ultraviolet to FIR information. Our\nanalysis focus on commonly used diagnostics, such as electron density,\nradiation field strength, metallicity, and electron temperature.

By examining empirical relations, we identify the contribution of\nactive galactic nuclei (AGN) to the FIR FSLs [O III]88 and [O I]63, and reveal\na bias in density measurements. FIR FSLs show good concordance with their\noptical counterparts. Our findings indicate that variations in FSL ratios are\nprimarily driven by the relative abundances of emitting ions, underscoring\ntheir value as tracers of metallicity and radiation field strength.

Otherwise, the states are locally distinguishable.\nHowever, locally indistinguishable states may find applications in information\nprocessing protocols. In this sense, locally indistinguishable states are\nuseful. On the other hand, it is usual to consider that locally distinguishable\nstates are useless. Nevertheless, recent works suggest that locally\ndistinguishable states should be given due consideration as in certain\nsituations these states can be converted to locally indistinguishable states\nunder orthogonality-preserving LOCC (OP-LOCC). Such a counterintuitive\nphenomenon motivates us to ask when the aforesaid conversion is possible and\nwhen it is not. In this work, we provide different structures of locally\ndistinguishable product and entangled states which do not allow the aforesaid\nconversion. We also provide certain structures of locally distinguishable\nstates which allow the aforesaid conversion. In this way, we classify the\nlocally distinguishable sets by introducing hierarchies among them. In a\nmultipartite system, this study becomes more involved as there exist\nmultipartite locally distinguishable sets which cannot be converted to locally\nindistinguishable sets by OP-LOCC across any bipartition.

This forms the basis for a\ntopological classification of the local causal structure in terms of the number\nof connected spacelike and timelike regions on the triangulated 2-sphere\nsurrounding the vertex. These local causal data allow us to identify regular\ncausal structures and new types of causal irregular configurations,\ngeneralizing well-known (1+1)-dimensional topologies, such as `Trousers' and\n`Yarmulkes', to higher dimensions.\n  We further investigate the dynamical implications of vertex causality by\nanalyzing the behaviour of deficit angles and the Regge action in explicit\nconfigurations. Transitions in vertex causal structure coincide with\nsingularities in the curvature and action, suggesting discrete topology change.\nCausally irregular hinges correspond to discrete conical singularities, while\nvertex causal irregularities manifest as point-like singularities.\nInterestingly, we find that vertex and hinge causality are generally\nindependent.

We first analyze the general analytical\nproperties of these objects in various contexts, including the time-evolution\noperator of non-interacting Hamiltonians and Haar-random unitaries. We then\nperform a numerical investigation of the natural super-orbitals corresponding\nto both the time-evolution operator and a time-evolved local operator, focusing\non two many-body systems: the fermionic $t\\text{-}V$ chain and an impurity\nmodel, using tensor network simulations. Our results reveal that the\n$t\\text{-}V$ model lacks a preferred super-orbital basis, while in the impurity\nmodel, the occupations of the natural orbitals for both operators decay\nexponentially at all times.

    "abstract": "Traditional Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) methods primarily focus on\nuniform brightness adjustment, often neglecting instance-level semantic\ninformation and the inherent characteristics of different features. To address\nthese limitations, we propose CWNet (Causal Wavelet Network), a novel\narchitecture that leverages wavelet transforms for causal reasoning.\nSpecifically, our approach comprises two key components: 1) Inspired by the\nconcept of intervention in causality, we adopt a causal reasoning perspective\nto reveal the underlying causal relationships in low-light enhancement. From a\nglobal perspective, we employ a metric learning strategy to ensure causal\nembeddings adhere to causal principles, separating them from non-causal\nconfounding factors while focusing on the invariance of causal factors. At the\nlocal level, we introduce an instance-level CLIP semantic loss to precisely\nmaintain causal factor consistency. 2) Based on our causal analysis, we present\na wavelet transform-based backbone network that effectively optimizes the\nrecovery of frequency information, ensuring precise enhancement tailored to the\nspecific attributes of wavelet transforms. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat CWNet significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods across\nmultiple datasets, showcasing its robust performance across diverse scenes.\nCode is available at https://github.com/bywlzts/CWNet-Causal-Wavelet-Network.",

    "abstract": "We investigate magic and its connection to entanglement in 1+1 dimensional\nrandom free fermion circuits, with a focus on hybrid free fermion dynamics that\ncan exhibit an entanglement phase transition. To quantify magic, we use the\nStabilizer R\\'enyi Entropy (SRE), which we compute numerically via a perfect\nsampling algorithm. We show that although the SRE remains extensive as the\nsystem transitions from a critical phase to an area-law (disentangled) phase,\nthe structure of magic itself undergoes a delocalization phase transition. This\ntransition is characterized using the bipartite stabilizer mutual information,\nwhich exhibits the same scaling behavior as entanglement entropy: logarithmic\nscaling in the critical phase and a finite constant in the area-law phase.\nAdditionally, we explore the dynamics of SRE. While the total SRE becomes\nextensive in $O(1)$ time, we find that in the critical phase, the relaxation\ntime to the steady-state value is parameterically longer than that in generic\nrandom circuits. The relaxation follows a universal form, with a relaxation\ntime that grows linearly with the system size, providing further evidence for\nthe critical nature of the phase.",

Remarkably, signatures of\nquantum criticality persist over an exceptionally broad range of magnetic\nfields and are well described by the formation of a quantum Griffiths phase, a\nregime in which rare spatially extended regions develop local order within a\nglobally disordered phase. This leads to a quantum phase transition governed by\nan infinite-randomness fixed point and characterized by ultraslow relaxation\ndynamics. Near the quantum critical region, transport measurements reveal\nstrongly nonlinear electrical behavior, including a current-driven reentrant\ntransition from insulating to superconducting transport, providing direct\nevidence of local superconducting order. By tilting the magnetic field, we are\nable to collapse the broad Griffiths regime into a single quantum critical\npoint, QCP, demonstrating a striking level of control over disorder induced\nquantum dynamics.

If\nthey originate from neutron stars (NSs), the existence of such ultra-long\nperiod pulsars (ULPs) challenges our current understanding of NS evolution and\nemission. In this work, we propose a new channel for disk formation based on\nNSs born in close binaries with main-sequence companion stars. Using a\nhydrodynamic simulation of supernova-companion interactions, we show that a\nnewborn NS may gravitationally capture gas as it moves through the complex\ndensity field shaped by the explosion. For a binary separation of\n$20\\rm~R_\\odot$ and a companion mass of $4\\rm~M_\\odot$, we find the occurrence\nfraction for disk formation around unbound NSs to be $\\sim10\\%$. By modeling\nthe disk evolution and its interaction with the NS, we find a bimodal\ndistribution in spin periods: canonical pulsars with $P\\lesssim10\\rm\\,s$ are\nthe ones who lack disks or whose magnetospheres never interacted with the disk,\nand ULPs with $10^3\\lesssim P<10^5\\rm\\,s$ are produced when the system\nundergoes a short-lived ``propeller'' phase during which the NS undergoes rapid\nspin-down. Such ULPs are formed under strong initial dipolar magnetic field\nstrengths $B_0\\gtrsim10^{14}\\rm\\,G$, with a formation rate of\n$10^{-4}\\rm\\,yr^{-1}$ in the Milky Way. We also find that a small population of\npulsars with moderate magnetic field strengths\n($10^{13}\\lesssim~B_0\\lesssim10^{14}\\rm\\,G$) and relatively slow initial\nperiods ($P_0\\gtrsim0.1\\rm\\,s$) evolve to $P\\sim10^2\\rm\\,s$, filling the gap\nbetween the bimodal distribution.

Using a new empirical scaling linking the [Ne v] line\nemission with AGN accretion-driven (continuum) emission, derived from a highly\ncomplete low-redshift AGN sample, we show that the [Ne v] emission in the two z\n> 5 galaxies implies total (bolometric) AGN luminosities of order\nL_bol~(4-8)x10^45 erg/s. Assuming that the radiation emitted from these systems\nis Eddington limited, the (minimal) black hole masses are of order M_BH>10^7\nM_sun. Combined with the published stellar masses of the galaxies, estimated\nfrom dedicated fitting of their spectral energy distributions, the implied\nBH-to-stellar mass ratios are of order M_BH/M_host~0.1-1. This is considerably\nhigher than what is found in the local Universe, but is consistent with the\ngeneral trend seen in some other z > 5 AGN.

In addition to the traditional AGN feedback modes, negative\n(suppressing cooling), and the new positive mode (triggering star formation),\nwe introduce two implementations of a third mode: the ejection of hot gas\nbeyond the virial radius, AGNeject1 and AGNeject2. This component addresses a\nlongstanding issue in semi-analytic models and hydrodynamical simulations: the\noverestimation of hot gas fractions in low and intermediate mass halos. FEGA25\nis calibrated via MCMC using a suite of cosmological N-body simulations YS50HR,\nYS200, and YS300, and a comprehensive set of observed stellar mass functions\nacross a wide redshift range. We find that supernova feedback dominates gas\nejection in halos with logM_{halo} < approximately 12, while AGN feedback\nbecomes increasingly important at higher halo masses. The AGNeject2 model,\nwhich activates primarily at late times, redshift < 1, reproduces a\ncharacteristic cavity, a U shaped feature in the baryon fraction at redshift\nzero, similar to trends observed in simulations like SIMBA and IllustrisTNG.\nConversely, AGNeject1 yields a smoother, redshift independent evolution. Both\nmodels preserve the stellar and cold gas components and successfully reproduce\nthe stellar to halo mass relation up to redshift 3.

We explore their\nbinding characteristics and interaction dynamics by examining the energy\nseparation between the dibaryon states and the corresponding two-baryon\nthresholds. These results contribute to a deeper understanding of single-flavor\ndibaryon states as a function of the quark masses. In the $S=0$ channel, the\n$\\Omega_{ccc}$-$\\Omega_{ccc}$ system exhibits a clear signal of a bound state,\nwhile the $\\Omega$-$\\Omega$ system lies very close to the threshold, making it\ndifficult to draw definitive conclusions.

Using $N$-body simulations, we find that the planet could be\ndynamically stable at a mutual angle inclination up to $\\sim75^\\circ$. The von\nZeipel-Lidov-Kozai (vZLK) mechanism becomes active when the mutual inclination\nis greater than 39.2$^\\circ$. High-inclination orbits exhibit coupled\noscillations in eccentricity and inclination, along with apsidal precession.\nSynthetic radial velocity (RV) modeling shows that these secular variations\nproduce measurable signatures across a broad range of timescales, from full\nvZLK cycles to observationally accessible decades. For instance, a high mutual\ninclination at 75$^\\circ$ can induce RV drifts exceeding 5 m s$^{-1}$ per\nplanetary orbit ($\\sim 1.9 \\,\\text{m s}^{-1}\\, \\text{yr}^{-1}$) in circular\nbinary configurations. The presence of eccentric vZLK further accelerates these\ndrifts, enhancing the detectability. Long-term RV observations of this system\noffer a unique pathway to dynamically constrain the orbital inclination, and\nthus determine the true mass of HD 41004 Ab. The degeneracy of mass-inclination\nis well known when using RV measurements alone. Our results highlight that HD\n41004Ab and potentially other S-type planets in compact binaries are promising\ntargets for breaking such a degeneracy by studying the dynamics induced by the\nvZLK mechanism through long-term high-precision RV monitoring.",

In a number of instances, however,\nthe exact nature of the corresponding ground states remains the subject of\nongoing debate. We show that general symmetry considerations can rule out\ncandidate states that are incompatible with the observed ferrimagnetic\nbehavior. In particular, we demonstrate that a ferrimagnetic response cannot be\nreconciled with a collinear zigzag ground state, owing to the combined\ntime-reversal and translational symmetry inherent to that configuration.\nInstead, the observed behavior is fully compatible with the symmetries of\nnoncollinear multi-$\\mathbf q$ states, such as the triple-$\\mathbf q$ discussed\nin the context of Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$. We exemplify this general result by\ncomputing the ferrimagnetic response of an extended Heisenberg-Kitaev-Gamma\nmodel with explicit sublattice symmetry breaking within linear spin-wave\ntheory. If the model realizes a triple-$\\mathbf q$ ground state, the calculated\nmagnetization curve is well consistent with the low-temperature behavior\nobserved in Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$. In this case, a finite magnetization remains\nin the zero-temperature limit as a consequence of quantum fluctuations, even if\nthe $g$-factors on the different sublattices are identical. For a zigzag ground\nstate, by contrast, the total magnetization vanishes both at zero and finite\ntemperatures, independent of possible sublattice-dependent $g$-factors, as\nexpected from the symmetry analysis. The implications of our general result for\nother Kitaev materials exhibiting ferrimagnetic behavior are also briefly\ndiscussed.",

In the limit of no bulk entanglement, the holographic encoding breaks\ndown. The oft-cited one-dimensional nature of the closed universe Hilbert space\nrepresents the limitation of the external (CFT) Hilbert space to access the\nquantum information in the closed universe, similar to the limitations imposed\non observers outside a perfectly isolated quantum lab. We advocate that the CFT\nnevertheless continues to determine the physical properties of the closed\nuniverse in this regime, showing how to interpret this relationship in terms of\na final state projection in the closed universe. We provide a dictionary\nbetween the final state wavefunction and CFT data. We propose a model of the\nemergence of an arrow of time in the universe with a given initial or final\nstate projection. Finally, we show that the conventional EFT in the closed\nuniverse, without any projection, can be recovered as a maximally ignorant\ndescription of the final state. This conventional EFT is encoded in CFT data,\nand it can be probed by computing coarse-grained observables. We provide an\nexample of one such observable.

    "abstract": "Merger trees track the hierarchical assembly of dark matter halos across\ncosmic time and serve as essential inputs for semi-analytic models of galaxy\nformation. However, conventional methods for constructing merger trees rely on\nad-hoc assumptions and are unable to incorporate environmental information.\nNguyen et al. (2024) introduced FLORAH, a generative model based on recurrent\nneural networks and normalizing flows, for modeling main progenitor branches of\nmerger trees. In this work, we extend this model, now referred to as\nFLORAH-Tree, to generate complete merger trees by representing them as graph\nstructures that capture the full branching hierarchy. We trained FLORAH-Tree on\nmerger trees extracted from the Very Small MultiDark Planck cosmological N-body\nsimulation. To validate our approach, we compared the generated merger trees\nwith both the original simulation data and with semi-analytic trees produced\nusing the Extended Press-Schechter (EPS) formalism. We show that FLORAH-Tree\naccurately reproduces key merger rate statistics across a wide range of mass\nand redshift, outperforming the conventional EPS-based approach. We demonstrate\nits utility by applying the Santa Cruz semi-analytic model (SAM) to generated\ntrees and showing that the resulting galaxy-halo scaling relations, such as the\nstellar-to-halo-mass relation and supermassive black hole mass-halo mass\nrelation, closely match those from applying the SAM to trees extracted directly\nfrom the simulation. FLORAH-Tree provides a computationally efficient method\nfor generating merger trees that maintain the statistical fidelity of N-body\nsimulations.",

    "abstract": "Consider a system of point masses in a spherical potential. In such systems\nobjects execute planar orbits covering two-dimensional rings or annuli,\nrepresented by the angular-momentum vectors, which slowly reorient due to the\npersistent weak gravitational interaction between different rings. This\nprocess, called vector resonant relaxation, is much faster than other processes\nwhich change the size/shape of the rings. The interaction is stron9gest between\nobjects with closely aligned angular-momentum vectors. In this paper, we show\nthat nearly parallel angular-momentum vectors may form stable bound pairs in\nangular-momentum space. We examine the stability of such pairs against an\nexternal massive perturber, and determine the critical separation analogous to\nthe Hill radius or tidal radius in the three-body problem, where the\nangular-momentum pairs are marginally disrupted, as a function of the\nperturber's mass, the orbital inclination, and the radial distance.\nAngular-momentum pairs or multiples closer than the critical inclination will\nremain bound and evolve together in angular-momentum-direction space under any\nexternal influence, such as anisotropic density fluctuations, or massive\nperturbers. This study has applications in various astrophysical contexts,\nincluding galactic nuclei, in particular the Milky Way's Galactic centre,\nglobular clusters, or planetary systems. In nuclear star clusters with a\ncentral super-massive black hole, we apply this criterion to the disc of young,\nmassive stars, and show that clusters in angular-momentum space may be used to\nconstrain the presence of intermediate-mass black holes or the mass of the\nnearby gaseous torus.",

Our goal here is to quantify these\nprocesses and probe their efficiency. While star formation can be traced at 10\nMyr time-scales through H$\\alpha$ emission, the signature of OB stars, and at\n100 Myr scale with UV emission, the gas surface density is traced by HI\nemission for the atomic phase. We choose to investigate feedback processes\nusing fountain effects in M101, a nearby well-observed face-on galaxy. Face-on\nstudies are very complementary to the more frequent edge-on observations of\nthese fountains in the literature. We use high-resolution data from THINGS for\nthe HI emission GALEX for UV, and SITELLE/SIGNALS IFU for the H$\\alpha$ tracer.\nWe have identified 20 new HI holes, in addition to the 52 holes found by\nKamphuis in 1993. We study in more detail the nine holes satisfying strong\ncriteria to be true fountain effects, compute their physical properties, and\nderive their energy balance. Only one small HI hole still contains H$\\alpha$\nand young stars inside, while the largest hole of 2.4 kpc and oldest age (94\nMyr) is deprived of H$\\alpha$ and UV. For face-on disks, the possibility to\nstudy simultaneously the HI shell morphology, the stellar association, and\nkinematic evidence is of primordial importance.

However, recent studies of star-forming galaxies at cosmic\nnoon have shown a decline in their rotation curve beyond a certain point,\nsuggesting a decrease of the abundance of dark matter in galactic halos during\nearlier times. In this work, we investigate the influence of cosmological\nsurface brightness dimming and loss of resolution on observations of rotation\ncurves at cosmic noon. We used a sample of 19 Lyman Break Analogs at $z \\approx\n0.2$ and artificially redshifted them as if they were at $z \\approx 2.2$. By\ncomparing both rotation curves of the observed and mocked objects, we find that\nthe asymmetry of the cosmic noon galaxies is smaller than that of the low-$z$\ngalaxies. In low-$z$ galaxies, asymmetry increases with radius and becomes\nrelevant at the external parts, where mergers and interactions cause more\ndisturbance in the galaxy's gravitational field. In contrast, cosmic-noon\ngalaxies appear smoother, smaller, and suitable for dynamical modeling -- when\nin reality, they are not. The combined effects of the cosmological bias and\nloss of resolution lead us to the conclusion that caution should be exercised\nwhen using cosmic-noon rotation curves, as they might not accurately trace the\ngravitational potential of the galaxy.",

We highlight an underexploited opportunity: LLM routing\ndata, produced when hosting platforms route diverse queries to different\nmodels, which can reveal comparative strengths across tasks. To address this,\nwe propose FusionBench, a comprehensive routing benchmark covering 14 tasks\nacross five domains with 20 open-source LLMs (8B to 671B parameters), capturing\n103M tokens and summarizing reusable thought templates from top models.\nBuilding on this, we introduce FusionFactory, a systematic fusion framework\nwith three levels: (1) query-level fusion, tailoring routers for each query\nusing both direct responses and reasoning-augmented outputs; (2) thought-level\nfusion, leveraging abstract templates derived from top-performing LLMs' answers\nto similar queries; and (3) model-level fusion, transferring capabilities\nbetween models via distillation, using top responses or highest judge scores as\ntraining data. Experiments show FusionFactory consistently outperforms the best\nindividual LLM across all 14 benchmarks, with optimal fusion configurations\nvarying by benchmark, demonstrating the value of systematic LLM fusion in\nharnessing complementary strengths and improving overall performance.",

Existing WMs primarily focus on unstructured data and\ncannot leverage the ubiquitous structured data, often represented as graphs, in\nthe digital world.

To address these challenges, we propose the\nGraph World Model (GWM), a world model that supports both unstructured and\ngraph-structured states with multi-modal information and represents diverse\ntasks as actions. The core of a GWM is a generic message-passing algorithm to\naggregate structured information, either over a unified multi-modal token space\nby converting multi-modal data into text (GWM-T) or a unified multi-modal\nembedding space by modality-specific encoders (GWM-E). Notably, GWM introduces\naction nodes to support diverse tasks, where action nodes are linked to other\nnodes via direct reference or similarity computation. Extensive experiments on\nsix tasks from diverse domains, including multi-modal generation and matching,\nrecommendation, graph prediction, multi-agent, retrieval-augmented generation,\nand planning and optimization, show that the same GWM outperforms or matches\ndomain-specific baselines' performance, benefits from multi-hop structures, and\ndemonstrates strong zero-shot/few-shot capabilities on unseen new tasks.

The resulting equations are linearly coupled across the thin\nstructure domain through physical coupling conditions.

Beyond directly answering user queries, LLMs can also\nserve as judges, assessing and comparing the quality of responses generated by\nother models. Such an evaluation capability is crucial both for benchmarking\ndifferent LLMs and for improving response quality through response ranking.\nHowever, despite the growing adoption of the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm, its\neffectiveness in coding scenarios remains underexplored due to the absence of\ndedicated benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce CodeJudgeBench, a\nbenchmark explicitly designed to evaluate the performance of LLM-as-a-Judge\nmodels across three critical coding tasks: code generation, code repair, and\nunit test generation. Through comprehensive benchmarking of 26 LLM-as-a-Judge\nmodels, we find that recent thinking models significantly outperform\nnon-thinking models on our carefully designed code judging tasks. Notably, even\nrelatively small thinking models, such as Qwen3-8B, can outperform specially\ntrained LLM-as-a-Judge models up to 70B in size. Nevertheless, all models still\nexhibit significant randomness in their judgment of coding tasks. For pairwise\njudging tasks, simply changing the order in which responses are presented can\nsubstantially impact accuracy. In addition, when judging code and unit tests\nwritten by different LLMs, LLM-as-a-Judge models also show variance in\nperformance. This sensitivity raises concerns about the reliability and\nconsistency of LLM-as-a-Judge in coding scenarios. Lastly, we study optimal\nprompting strategies for LLM-as-a-Judge. We find that using pair-wise\ncomparison outperforms scalar point-wise judging. Furthermore, retaining\ncomments and reasoning in the full, unprocessed LLM response leads to improved\njudge performance.",

Our analysis incorporates improvements to the data\nprocessing pipeline, particularly in subtracting strong radio sources in the\nprimary beam sidelobes and mitigating low-level radio frequency interference,\nyielding a 50-fold reduction in the excess variance compared to a previous\nanalysis of the north celestial pole field.

Comparison against simulated exotic 21-cm signals shows that while the\n$z=20.3$ limits begin to exclude the most extreme models predicting signals\nstronger than the EDGES detection, an order-of-magnitude improvement would\nconstrain signals compatible with EDGES.

    "abstract": "The Tolman effect is well-known in relativistic cosmology but rarely\ndiscussed outside it. That is surprising because the effect -- that systems\nextended over a varying gravitational potential exhibit temperature gradients\nwhile in thermal equilibrium -- conflicts with ordinary classical\nthermodynamics. In this paper we try to better understand this effect from a\nfoundational perspective. We make five claims. First, as Tolman knew, it was\nEinstein who first discovered the effect, and furthermore, Einstein's\nderivation helps us appreciate how robust it is. Second, the standard\ninterpretation of the effect in terms of 'local temperature' leads to the\nbreakdown of much of classical thermodynamics. Third, one can rescue\nthermodynamics by using Einstein's preferred interpretation in terms of the\n'wahre Temperatur' -- what we'll call global temperature -- but it too has some\ncosts. Fourth, the effect is perhaps best understood in terms of clocks as\nopposed to energy loss. Fifth, inspired by a proposal of Einstein's elsewhere,\nwe sketch an interpretation of the effect in terms of a third novel\ntemperature, which we call the 'wahre-local temperature'. On this view,\ntemperature -- and thermodynamics -- is defined only in relation to local\nclocks. In sum, we view the fragmentation of temperature in thermodynamics as a\nnatural and expected result of the fragmentation of time in general relativity.",

Several quick\nresponse observations suggest the lunar ejecta origin of 2024 PT$_5$, while\nrotation state and albedo, essential properties to investigate its origin, are\nnot well constrained. We performed visible to near-infrared multicolor\nphotometry of 2024 PT$_5$ from data taken using the TriColor CMOS Camera and\nSpectrograph (TriCCS) on the Seimei 3.8 m telescope during 2025 January 4-10.\nThe Seimei/TriCCS observations of 2024 PT$_5$ cover phase angles from 14 deg to\n27 deg, and were obtained in the $g$, $r$, $i$, and $z$ bands in the Pan-STARRS\nsystem. In addition, we analyzed $Y$, $J$, $H$, and $K$ photometry taken with\nthe Multi-Object Spectrograph for Infrared Exploration (MOSFIRE) on the Keck I\n10-m telescope taken on 2025 January 16-17. Our lightcurves show brightness\nvariations over time periods of several tens of minutes. We infer that 2024\nPT$_5$ is in a tumbling state and has a lightcurve amplitude of about 0.3 mag.\nVisible and near-infrared color indices of 2024 PT$_5$, $g-r=0.567\\pm0.044$,\n$r-i=0.155\\pm0.009$, $r-z=0.147\\pm0.066$, $Y-J=0.557\\pm0.046$,\n$J-H=0.672\\pm0.078$, and $H-Ks=0.148\\pm0.098$, indicate that 2024 PT$_5$ is an\nS-complex asteroid, largely consistent with previous observations. Using the\n$H$-$G$ model, we derived an absolute magnitude $H_{V,HG}$ of $27.72\\pm0.09$\nand a slope parameter $G_V$ of $0.223\\pm0.073$ in V-band. A geometric albedo of\n2024 PT$_5$ is derived to be $0.26\\pm0.07$ from the slope of its photometric\nphase curve. This albedo value is typical of the S- and Q-type NEAs. The color\nproperties of 2024 PT$_5$ derived from our observations match rock samples\ntaken from the lunar surface, which agrees with previous studies.",

We introduce Mixture-of-Recursions (MoR), a unified framework\nthat combines the two axes of efficiency inside a single Recursive Transformer.\nMoR reuses a shared stack of layers across recursion steps to achieve parameter\nefficiency, while lightweight routers enable adaptive token-level thinking by\ndynamically assigning different recursion depths to individual tokens. This\nallows MoR to focus quadratic attention computation only among tokens still\nactive at a given recursion depth, further improving memory access efficiency\nby selectively caching only their key-value pairs. Beyond these core\nmechanisms, we also propose a KV sharing variant that reuses KV pairs from the\nfirst recursion, specifically designed to decrease prefill latency and memory\nfootprint. Across model scales ranging from 135M to 1.7B parameters, MoR forms\na new Pareto frontier: at equal training FLOPs and smaller model sizes, it\nsignificantly lowers validation perplexity and improves few-shot accuracy,\nwhile delivering higher throughput compared with vanilla and existing recursive\nbaselines.

Our analysis reveals that energy extraction remains feasible even at\na spin parameter as low as 0.5, significantly below previously reported\nthresholds, and the extracted power can exceed that of the BZ process under\ncertain conditions. Furthermore, the dilatonic scalar charge $b$ and the AdS\nradius $l$ collectively contribute to lowering the spin threshold for energy\nextraction. The energy extraction process in the plunging region was further\nexamined by analyzing the permissible energy extraction region, as well as the\ncorresponding power output and efficiency. One can find that the energy\nextraction is possible even at a spin as low as 0.25. Crucially, parameter $b$\nactively lowers the energy extraction spin threshold, while parameter $l$\nexerts a counteracting effect, impeding such reduction. This trend shows a\nmarked contrast with circular orbit behavior. Additionally, both power and\nefficiency in the plunging region consistently surpass those in the circular\norbit region, indicating superior energy extraction capability in plunging\nregion.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the local behavior of 3D Filippov systems $Z=(X,Y)$,\nfocusing on the dynamics around cusp-fold singularities. These singular points,\ncharacterized by cubic contact of vector field $X$ and quadratic contact of\nvector field $Y$ on the switching manifold, are structurally unstable under\nsmall perturbations of $Z$, giving rise to significant bifurcation phenomena.\n  We analyze the bifurcations of a 3D Filippov system around an invisible\ncusp-fold singularity, providing a detailed characterization of its crossing\ndynamics under certain conditions. We classify the characteristics of the\nsingularity when it emerges generically in one-parameter families (a\ncodimension-one phenomenon), and we show that no crossing limit cycles (CLCs)\nlocally bifurcate from it in this particular scenario. When the vector fields\n$X$ and $Y$ are anti-collinear at the cusp-fold singularity, we provide\nconditions for the generic emergence of this point in two-parameter families (a\ncodimension-two phenomenon). In this case, we show that the unfolding of such a\nsingularity leads to a bifurcating CLC, which degenerates into a fold-regular\npolycycle (self-connection at a fold-regular singularity).\n  Furthermore, we numerically derive the polycycle bifurcation curve and\ncomplete the two-parameter bifurcation set for a boost converter system\npreviously studied in the literature. This allows the identification of\nparameter regions where the boost converter system exhibits a CLC in its phase\nportrait, providing a understanding of its complex dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across\ndiverse applications, yet they pose significant security risks that threaten\ntheir safe deployment in critical domains. Current security alignment\nmethodologies predominantly rely on Process Reward Models (PRMs) to evaluate\nintermediate reasoning steps, introducing substantial computational overhead\nand scalability constraints. This paper presents a novel PRM-free security\nalignment framework that leverages automated red teaming and adversarial\ntraining to achieve robust security guarantees while maintaining computational\nefficiency. Our approach systematically identifies vulnerabilities through\nsophisticated attack strategies including genetic algorithm optimization,\nmulti-agent simulation, and advanced prompt mutation techniques. The framework\nenhances model robustness via targeted adversarial training with curriculum\nlearning and adaptive regularization mechanisms. Comprehensive experimental\nevaluation across five state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrates that our method\nachieves superior security alignment performance compared to PRM-based\napproaches while reducing computational costs by 61\\%. The framework\nincorporates transparent reporting and continuous audit mechanisms that enable\niterative security improvement and regulatory compliance. Our contributions\nadvance the field of efficient LLM security alignment by democratizing access\nto robust security measures for resource-constrained organizations and\nproviding a scalable foundation for addressing evolving adversarial threats.",

For example, two common approaches to\nundergraduate QM instruction are spins-first, which focuses on the postulates\nof QM in spin systems before discussing wavefunctions, and wavefunctions-first,\nwhich focuses on the Schr\\\"odinger equation and its solutions for continuous\nfunctions in various potentials before discussing spin. These different\napproaches, along with the content variability in the textbooks used by\ninstructors, may mean students learn different things in QM classes across the\nUnited States (U.S.). In this paper, we offer a characterization of QM courses\nbased on survey responses from instructors at institutions across the U.S. With\nthe responses of 76 instructors teaching QM courses (or sequences), we present\nresults detailing their teaching methodologies, use of pedagogical resources,\nand coverage of QM topics. We find that the plurality of instructors in our\nsample are using traditional lecture, but many instructors are using\ninteractive lecture or another non-traditional method. Additionally,\ninstructors are using a wide variety of pedagogical tools (e.g., clicker\nquestions). Many instructors in our sample reported teaching single-semester\n(or single-quarter) QM courses; these instructors report similar content\ncoverage to instructors teaching first-semester (or quarter) QM courses, though\ntheir responses showed greater variability. We additionally report a comparison\nof content coverage between instructors using wavefunctions-first versus\nspins-first approaches, finding a large degree of overlap with differences in\ncoverage for a few specific topics.

In this paper, we consider estimation and inference for a\nnonparametric class of real-valued c\\`adl\\`ag functions with bounded sectional\nvariation (Gill et al., 1995), using the Highly Adaptive Lasso (HAL) (van der\nLaan, 2015; Benkeser and van der Laan, 2016; van der Laan, 2023), a flexible\nempirical risk minimizer over linear combinations of tensor products of zero-\nor higher-order spline basis functions under an L1 norm constraint. Building on\nrecent theoretical advances in asymptotic normality and uniform convergence\nrates for higher-order spline HAL estimators (van der Laan, 2023), this work\nfocuses on constructing robust confidence intervals for HAL-based conditional\nmean estimators. To address regularization bias, we propose a targeted HAL with\na debiasing step to remove bias for the conditional mean, and also consider a\nrelaxed HAL estimator to reduce bias. We also introduce both global and local\nundersmoothing strategies to adaptively select the working model, reducing bias\nrelative to variance. Combined with delta-method-based variance estimation, we\nconstruct confidence intervals for conditional means based on HAL. Through\nsimulations, we evaluate combinations of estimation and model selection\nstrategies, showing that our methods substantially reduce bias and yield\nconfidence intervals with coverage rates close to nominal levels across\nscenarios. We also provide recommendations for different estimation objectives\nand illustrate the generality of our framework by applying it to estimate\nconditional average treatment effect (CATE) functions, highlighting how\nHAL-based inference extends to other infinite-dimensional, non-pathwise\ndifferentiable parameters.",

We propose LaSDI-IT (Latent Space\nDynamics Identification for Interface Tracking), a data-driven framework that\ncombines low-dimensional latent dynamics learning with explicit interface-aware\nencoding to enable accurate and efficient modeling of physical systems\ninvolving moving material boundaries. At the core of LaSDI-IT is a revised\nauto-encoder architecture that jointly reconstructs the physical field and an\nindicator function representing material regions or phases, allowing the model\nto track complex interface evolution without requiring detailed physical models\nor mesh adaptation. The latent dynamics are learned through linear regression\nin the encoded space and generalized across parameter regimes using Gaussian\nprocess interpolation with greedy sampling. We demonstrate LaSDI-IT on the\nproblem of shock-induced pore collapse in high explosives, a process\ncharacterized by sharp temperature gradients and dynamically deforming pore\ngeometries. The method achieves relative prediction errors below 9% across the\nparameter space, accurately recovers key quantities of interest such as pore\narea and hot spot formation, and matches the performance of dense training with\nonly half the data. This latent dynamics prediction was 106 times faster than\nthe conventional high-fidelity simulation, proving its utility for multi-query\napplications.

The\ndecreasing density causes their amplitude to increase, developing into\nnonlinear waves through steepening and eventually forming shocks. To\ninvestigate the vertical evolution of this wave nonlinearity, we utilized\nmulti-wavelength data from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard the\nSolar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), covering from the photosphere to the lower\ncorona across 20 active regions. The steepening of the wave profile leads to\nthe generation of higher harmonics. We quantify this using a nonlinearity index\n(NI), defined as the ratio of the amplitude of 2nd harmonic to the fundamental\nobtained using wavelet analysis. We find a characteristic pattern: nonlinearity\nincreases from the photosphere through the lower chromosphere, peaking near the\nAIA 1700 \\r{A} formation height, and decreases at higher altitudes, notably in\nthe AIA 304 \\r{A} channel. This trend indicates progressive wave steepening and\nsubsequent energy dissipation before reaching the formation of AIA 304 \\r{A},\nconsistent with shock formation in the lower atmosphere. An additional rise in\nNI is observed at the AIA 131 \\r{A} channel, followed by a decline in AIA 171\n\\r{A}, suggesting a 2nd phase of wave nonlinearity evolution in the lower\ncorona. Based on the NI profile and the formation heights of these channels, we\nconjecture that nonlinear wave processes are most prominent between the AIA\n1700 \\r{A} and AIA 304 \\r{A} formation layers and again between AIA 131 \\r{A}\nand AIA 171 \\r{A}.",

These systems\ntypically rely on predefined logic and lack support for dialogue-based\ninteraction, making them inflexible in dynamic environments or when adapting to\ndriver intent. This paper presents Scene-Aware Conversational ADAS (SC-ADAS), a\nmodular framework that integrates Generative AI components including large\nlanguage models, vision-to-text interpretation, and structured function calling\nto enable real-time, interpretable, and adaptive driver assistance. SC-ADAS\nsupports multi-turn dialogue grounded in visual and sensor context, allowing\nnatural language recommendations and driver-confirmed ADAS control. Implemented\nin the CARLA simulator with cloud-based Generative AI, the system executes\nconfirmed user intents as structured ADAS commands without requiring model\nfine-tuning. We evaluate SC-ADAS across scene-aware, conversational, and\nrevisited multi-turn interactions, highlighting trade-offs such as increased\nlatency from vision-based context retrieval and token growth from accumulated\ndialogue history.

However, existing unlearning\nmethods mainly focus on recovering trigger patterns but fail to restore the\ncorrect semantic labels of poison samples. This limitation prevents them from\nfully eliminating the false correlation between the trigger pattern and the\ntarget label. To address this, we leverage boundary adversarial attack\ntechniques, revealing two key observations. First, poison samples exhibit\nsignificantly greater distances from decision boundaries compared to clean\nsamples, indicating they require larger adversarial perturbations to change\ntheir predictions. Second, while adversarial predicted labels for clean samples\nare uniformly distributed, those for poison samples tend to revert to their\noriginal correct labels. Moreover, the features of poison samples restore to\nclosely resemble those of corresponding clean samples after adding adversarial\nperturbations. Building upon these insights, we propose Backdoor Unlearning via\nadversaRial bouNdary analysis (BURN), a novel defense framework that integrates\nfalse correlation decoupling, progressive data refinement, and model\npurification. In the first phase, BURN employs adversarial boundary analysis to\ndetect poisoned samples based on their abnormal adversarial boundary distances,\nthen restores their correct semantic labels for fine-tuning. In the second\nphase, it employs a feedback mechanism that tracks prediction discrepancies\nbetween the original backdoored model and progressively sanitized models,\nguiding both dataset refinement and model purification.

    "abstract": "Connecting plasma processing parameters to the resultant film microstructure\nremains a fundamental challenge in materials synthesis, one that has largely\nconfined process design to empirical approaches. To bridge this gap, we develop\na predictive analysis of coupling by applying a renormalization group (RG)\nanalysis to an effective Hamiltonian for the stochastic dynamics of the\nplasma-surface interface, derived systematically from microscopic principles.\nThe central result from this formalism is the system's exhibition of asymptotic\nfreedom; the effective dimensionless coupling, $g$, between the plasma and the\ngrowing surface is found to weaken systematically at macroscopic length scales,\na finding that provides a rigorous justification for the success of\ncontinuum-level models in describing large-scale film evolution. The RG\nframework yields a non-perturbative scaling relation for the mean grain area,\n$\\langle A \\rangle \\propto \\exp(\\kappa/g)$, where $g$ itself is defined by\nfundamental parameters such as ion flux ($\\Phi$) and ion collision time\n($\\tau_{\\text{ion}}$). This relation reveals the origin of widely-observed\nempirical power-law scaling, showing it to be an effective behavior limited to\nspecific process regimes. Crucially, the model furnishes sharp, testable\npredictions, including the pressure-independence of grain size within\ncollision-dominated plasmas and a parameter-free criterion, $\\Lambda_c =\n1/(n^2-1)$, for the onset of morphological instability and faceting based on\ncrystal symmetry. This work establishes a quantitative, parameter-sparse engine\nfor predicting and ultimately controlling microstructural outcomes in thin film\nsynthesis.",

    "abstract": "Aircraft aerodynamic design optimization must account for the varying\noperating conditions along the cruise segment as opposed to designing at one\nfixed operating condition, to arrive at more realistic designs. Conventional\napproaches address this by performing a ``multi-point'' optimization that\nassumes a weighted average of the objectives at a set of sub-segments along the\ncruise segment. We argue that since such multi-point approaches are,\ninevitably, biased by the specification of the weights, they can lead to\nsub-optimal designs. Instead, we propose to optimize the aircraft design at\nmultiple sub-segments simultaneously -- that is, via multiobjective\noptimization that leads to a set of Pareto optimal solutions. However, existing\nwork in multiobjective optimization suffers from (i) lack of sample efficiency\n(that is, keeping the number of function evaluations to convergence minimal),\n(ii) scalability with input dimensions and number of objectives, and (iii) the\nability to generate a batch of iterates for synchronous parallel evaluations.\nTo overcome these limitations, we propose a novel multiobjective Bayesian\noptimization methodology that demonstrates improved sample efficiency and\naccuracy compared to the state of the art. Inspired by Thompson sampling, our\napproach leverages Gaussian process surrogates and Bayesian decision theory to\ngenerate a sequence of iterates according to the probability that they are\nPareto optimal. Our approach, named batch Pareto optimal Thompson sampling\n($q\\texttt{POTS}$), demonstrates superior empirical performance on a variety of\nsynthetic experiments as well as a $24$ dimensional two-objective aerodynamic\ndesign optimization of the NASA common research model. We also provide\nopen-source software of our methodology.",

With the developments of\nLLMs, building LLM-based agents for automatic thread investigation is a\npromising direction.

Anchoring each question to these explicit nodes and edges not only\nprovides automatic, explainable ground truth answers but also makes the\npipeline reusable and readily extensible to new logs.

This innovation provides\noutlier resistance while maintaining the highly efficient additive update\nstructure of Fast-HALS.

Our results\nreveal a distinct, non-monotonic strain dependence of both magnetic anisotropy\nenergy (MAE) and DMI, including a strain-tunable crossover between in-plane and\nout-of-plane magnetic easy axes. A remarkable enhancement of the in-plane DMI\nis observed under the combined influence of strain and strong correlations,\nwhich is unusual for pristine 2D materials and suggests a favorable regime for\nspintronic applications.Notably, even in the absence of strain, H-FeTe$_2$\nexhibits finite DMI and considerable anisotropy, which is rare for a pure 2D\nmaterial.

In this\nwork, we propose a framework for detecting falls using several complementary\nsystems: a semi-supervised federated learning-based fall detection system\n(SF2D), an indoor localization and navigation system, and a vision-based human\nfall recognition system. A wearable device and an edge device identify a fall\nscenario in the first system. On top of that, the second system uses an indoor\nlocalization technique first to localize the fall location and then navigate a\nrobot to inspect the scenario. A vision-based detection system running on an\nedge device with a mounted camera on a robot is used to recognize fallen\npeople. Each of the systems of this proposed framework achieves different\naccuracy rates. Specifically, the SF2D has a 0.81% failure rate equivalent to\n99.19% accuracy, while the vision-based fallen people detection achieves 96.3%\naccuracy. However, when we combine the accuracy of these two systems with the\naccuracy of the navigation system (95% success rate), our proposed framework\ncreates a highly reliable performance for fall detection, with an overall\naccuracy of 99.99%. Not only is the proposed framework safe for older adults,\nbut it is also a privacy-preserving solution for detecting falls.",

In outdoor scenarios, hourly estimates rely\non cues like brightness, hue, and shadow positioning, while seasonal changes\nand weather inform date estimation. However, these visual cues significantly\ndepend on geographic context, closely linking timestamp prediction to\ngeo-localization. To address this interdependence, we introduce GT-Loc, a novel\nretrieval-based method that jointly predicts the capture time (hour and month)\nand geo-location (GPS coordinates) of an image. Our approach employs separate\nencoders for images, time, and location, aligning their embeddings within a\nshared high-dimensional feature space. Recognizing the cyclical nature of time,\ninstead of conventional contrastive learning with hard positives and negatives,\nwe propose a temporal metric-learning objective providing soft targets by\nmodeling pairwise time differences over a cyclical toroidal surface. We present\nnew benchmarks demonstrating that our joint optimization surpasses previous\ntime prediction methods, even those using the ground-truth geo-location as an\ninput during inference. Additionally, our approach achieves competitive results\non standard geo-localization tasks, and the unified embedding space facilitates\ncompositional and text-based image retrieval.",

Traditional recruitment processes often encounter bottlenecks in\nresume screening and candidate shortlisting due to time and resource\nconstraints. MLAR addresses these challenges employing Large Language Models\n(LLMs) in three distinct layers: extracting key characteristics from job\npostings in the first layer, parsing applicant resume to identify education,\nexperience, skills in the second layer, and similarity matching in the third\nlayer. These features are then matched through advanced semantic algorithms to\nidentify the best candidates efficiently. Our approach integrates seamlessly\ninto existing RPA pipelines, automating resume parsing, job matching, and\ncandidate notifications. Extensive performance benchmarking shows that MLAR\noutperforms the leading RPA platforms, including UiPath and Automation\nAnywhere, in high-volume resume-processing tasks. When processing 2,400\nresumes, MLAR achieved an average processing time of 5.4 seconds per resume,\nreducing processing time by approximately 16.9% compared to Automation Anywhere\nand 17.1% compared to UiPath.

In this\npaper, we focus on effectively incorporating appropriate features from\nhigh-quality reference images, presenting a novel blind facial image\nrestoration method that considers reference selection, transfer, and\nreconstruction (RefSTAR). In terms of selection, we construct a reference\nselection (RefSel) module.

As for the transfer, due to the\ntrivial solution in vanilla cross-attention operations, a feature fusion\nparadigm is designed to force the features from the reference to be integrated.\nFinally, we propose a reference image reconstruction mechanism that further\nensures the presence of reference image features in the output image. The cycle\nconsistency loss is also redesigned in conjunction with the mask.

    "abstract": "The concept of the Web of Agents (WoA), which transforms the static,\ndocument-centric Web into an environment of autonomous agents acting on users'\nbehalf, has attracted growing interest as large language models (LLMs) become\nmore capable. However, research in this area is still fragmented across\ndifferent communities. Contemporary surveys catalog the latest LLM-powered\nframeworks, while the rich histories of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) and the\nSemantic Web are often treated as separate, legacy domains. This fragmentation\nobscures the intellectual lineage of modern systems and hinders a holistic\nunderstanding of the field's trajectory. We present the first comprehensive\nevolutionary overview of the WoA. We show that modern protocols like A2A and\nthe MCP, are direct evolutionary responses to the well-documented limitations\nof earlier standards like FIPA standards and OWL-based semantic agents. To\nsystematize this analysis, we introduce a four-axis taxonomy (semantic\nfoundation, communication paradigm, locus of intelligence, discovery\nmechanism). This framework provides a unified analytical lens for comparing\nagent architectures across all generations, revealing a clear line of descent\nwhere others have seen a disconnect. Our analysis identifies a paradigm shift\nin the 'locus of intelligence': from being encoded in external data (Semantic\nWeb) or the platform (MAS) to being embedded within the agent's core model\n(LLM). This shift is foundational to modern Agentic AI, enabling the scalable\nand adaptive systems the WoA has long envisioned. We conclude that while new\nprotocols are essential, they are insufficient for building a robust, open,\ntrustworthy ecosystem. Finally, we argue that the next research frontier lies\nin solving persistent socio-technical challenges, and we map out a new agenda\nfocused on decentralized identity, economic models, security, and governance\nfor the emerging WoA.",

The colorful minor relation enhances the\nclassical minor relation by merging color sets at contracted edges and allowing\nthe removal of colors from vertices. This framework naturally models\nalgorithmic problems involving graphs with (possibly overlapping) annotated\nvertex sets. We develop a structural theory for colorful minors by establishing\nseveral theorems characterizing $\\mathcal{H}$-colorful minor-free graphs, where\n$\\mathcal{H}$ consists either of a clique or a grid with all vertices assigned\nall colors, or of grids with colors segregated and ordered on the outer face.\nLeveraging our structural insights, we provide a complete classification -\nparameterized by the number $q$ of colors - of all colorful graphs that exhibit\nthe Erd\\H{o}s-P\\'osa property with respect to colorful minors. On the\nalgorithmic side, we provide a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm for colorful\nminor testing and a variant of the $k$-disjoint paths problem. Together with\nthe fact that the colorful minor relation forms a well-quasi-order, this\nimplies that every colorful minor-monotone parameter on colorful graphs admits\na fixed-parameter algorithm. Furthermore, we derive two algorithmic\nmeta-theorems (AMTs) whose structural conditions are linked to extensions of\ntreewidth and Hadwiger number on colorful graphs. Our results suggest how known\nAMTs can be extended to incorporate not only the structure of the input graph\nbut also the way the colored vertices are distributed in it.",

However, they often lack an explicit and systematic framework for\nquantifying the contribution of individual features. Building on the Taylor\nexpansion framework introduced by Deng et al. (2024) to unify existing local\nattribution methods, we propose a rigorous set of postulates -- \"precision\",\n\"federation\", and \"zero-discrepancy\" -- to govern Taylor term-specific\nattribution. Guided by these postulates, we introduce TaylorPODA (Taylor\nexpansion-derived imPortance-Order aDapted Attribution), which incorporates an\nadditional \"adaptation\" property. This property enables alignment with\ntask-specific goals, especially in post-hoc settings lacking ground-truth\nexplanations. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that TaylorPODA achieves\ncompetitive results against baseline methods, providing principled and\nvisualization-friendly explanations.

The model developed in this work\nuses associative memory via a transparent, explainable Hopfield neural network\nto store signals and detect similar signals which can then be used to classify\nspecies. Training is rapid ($3$\\,ms), as only one representative signal is\nrequired for each target sound within a dataset. The model is fast, taking only\n$5.4$\\,s to pre-process and classify all $10384$ publicly available bat\nrecordings, on a standard Apple MacBook Air. The model is also lightweight with\na small memory footprint of $144.09$\\,MB of RAM usage. Hence, the low\ncomputational demands make the model ideal for use on a variety of standard\npersonal devices with potential for deployment in the field via edge-processing\ndevices. It is also competitively accurate, with up to $86\\%$ precision on the\ndataset used to evaluate the model.

On the other hand MI and TMI show a more intricate\ndependence backreaction tends to strengthen correlations, while increasing\ncharge suppresses entanglement and makes the system more susceptible to\nscrambling. The analysis of the butterfly velocity indicates that both the\npresence of charge and the backreaction suppress the chaotic behavior of the\nsystem by reducing $v_B$.

Often, as is the\ncase of policy iteration for the continuous-time LQR problem, this rate\nvanishes for large initial conditions, resulting in a mixed globally linear /\nlocally exponential behavior. This is in sharp contrast with the discrete-time\nLQR problem, where there is global exponential convergence. That gap between CT\nand DT behaviors motivates the search for various generalized PLI-like\nconditions, and this talk will address that topic. Moreover, these\ngeneralizations are key to understanding the transient and asymptotic effects\nof errors in the estimation of the gradient, errors which might arise from\nadversarial attacks, wrong evaluation by an oracle, early stopping of a\nsimulation, inaccurate and very approximate digital twins, stochastic\ncomputations (algorithm ``reproducibility''), or learning by sampling from\nlimited data. We describe an ``input to state stability'' (ISS) analysis of\nthis issue.

With this\ncorpus we compare LLM actions with original human-generated clarification\nquestions, examining how both humans and LLMs act in the case of ambiguity. We\nfind that there is only a weak link between ambiguity and humans producing\nclarification questions in these dialogues, and low correlation between humans\nand LLMs. Humans hardly ever produce clarification questions for referential\nambiguity, but often do so for task-based uncertainty. Conversely, LLMs produce\nmore clarification questions for referential ambiguity, but less so for task\nuncertainty. We question if LLMs' ability to ask clarification questions is\npredicated on their recent ability to simulate reasoning, and test this with\ndifferent reasoning approaches, finding that reasoning does appear to increase\nquestion frequency and relevancy.",

One galaxy is classified\nas an AGN based on its optical spectrum, a second is identified as a possible\nX-ray AGN based on the Chandra data, and the third galaxy may host a radio AGN.\nIn optical images, a prominent dust lane crosses the southern galaxy, while\nSpitzer infrared images show a dusty bridge connecting the two brightest\ngalaxies. Chandra maps reveal a massive (2 x 10^7 M(sun)) concentration of hot\ngas between these two galaxies, as well as several other knots of hot gas and\nnon-thermal emission. The unabsorbed X-ray luminosity of the hot gas in IC 2431\nis ~ 1 x 10^42 erg/s, which is enhanced by about a factor of four relative to\nthe star formation rate, compared to other star-forming galaxies. In radio\nmaps, a bright jet/ridge of radio continuum emission extends 4 kpc from one\nnucleus. We compare the properties of IC 2431 with those of other interacting\ngalaxy systems, and discuss two different scenarios that may account for the\npeculiarities of IC 2431: ram pressure stripping of the interstellar medium\nduring a head-on collision between two galaxies, or an AGN-powered radio jet\nthat has been distorted by an interaction with interstellar gas during a tidal\nencounter between galaxies.",

However, defects during growth and transfer\nto other substrates can compromise the integrity and strength of graphene.\nSurprisingly, the literature suggests that, in certain cases, defects can\nenhance or, at most, not affect the mechanical performance of graphene. Further\nresearch is necessary to explore how defects interact within graphene structure\nand affect its properties, especially in large-area samples. In this study, we\ninvestigate the interaction between two preexisting cracks and their effect on\nthe mechanical properties of graphene using molecular dynamics simulations. The\nbehavior of zigzag and armchair graphene structures with cracks separated by\ndistances ($W_\\text{gap}$) is analyzed under tensile loading. The findings\nreveal that crack coalescence, defined as the formation of a new crack from two\nexisting crack tips, occurs for lower values of the distance between cracks,\n$W_\\text{gap}$, resulting in a decline in the strength of structures. As\n$W_\\text{gap}$ increases, the stress-strain curves shift upward, with the peak\nstress rising in the absence of crack coalescence. The effective stress\nintensity factor formulated in this study exhibits a clear upward trend with\nincreasing $W_\\text{gap}$. Furthermore, an increase in $W_\\text{gap}$ induces a\ntransition in fracture behavior from crack coalescence to independent\npropagation with intercrack undulation.

It\nis often unclear whether time delay plays a significant role in observed\nphenomena, and if it does, how long the time lag really is. This would be\ninvaluable knowledge when analyzing and modeling such systems. Hitherto, no\nuniversal method is available by which the time delay can be inferred. To\naddress this problem, we propose and demonstrate two different methods to infer\ntime delay in overdamped Langevin systems with delayed feedback. In the first\npart, we focus on the power spectral density based on the positional data and\nuse a characteristic signature of the time delay to infer the delay time. In\nlimiting cases, we establish a direct relation of the observations made for\nnonlinear time-delayed feedback forces to analytical results obtained for the\nlinear system. In other situations despite the absence of this direct relation,\nthe characteristic signature remains and can be exploited by a semiautomatic\nmethod to infer the delay time. Furthermore, it may not always desirable or\npossible to observe a system for a long time to infer dependencies and\nparameters. Thus, in the second part, we propose for the first time a probing\nmethod combined with a neural network to infer the delay time, which requires\nonly short observation time series. These proposed methods for inferring time\ndelays in stochastic systems may prove to be valuable tools for gaining deeper\ninsight into the role of delay across a wide range of applications -- from the\nbehavior of individual colloidal particles under feedback control to emergent\ncollective phenomena such as flocking and swarming.",

It leads to a promising question: Can we harness multiple\nopen-source LLMs to match or even beat the closed-source LLMs? To answer this,\nwe propose SMACS, a scalable multi-agent collaboration system (MACS) framework\nwith high performance. Specifically, for continuous integration of new LLMs and\ngeneralization to diverse questions, we first propose a Retrieval-based Prior\nSelection (RPS), which assigns a proxy performance score to each LLM to select\nthe Top-k LLMs at the instance level for any given question. Then, we propose\nan Exploration-Exploitation-Driven Posterior Enhancement (EPE), encouraging the\ngeneration of diverse responses through prior dropping and selecting the\nhigh-quality response via a hybrid posterior score. Experiments on eight\nmainstream benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our SMACS: by integrating\nfifteen open-source LLMs, SMACS outperforms leading closed-source LLMs in 2025,\ne.g., Claude-3.7-Sonnet (+12.73%), GPT-4.1(+5.36%) and GPT-o3-mini(+5.28%)\nacross multiple tasks. Remarkably, it even exceeds the average of best results\nof different datasets from both open-source LLMs (+2.86%) and closed-source\nLLMs (+2.04%), pushing the upper bound of intelligence.

    "abstract": "Conformal prediction is a distribution-free uncertainty quantification method\nthat has gained popularity in the machine learning community due to its\nfinite-sample guarantees and ease of use. Its most common variant, dubbed split\nconformal prediction, is also computationally efficient as it boils down to\ncollecting statistics of the model predictions on some calibration data not yet\nseen by the model. Nonetheless, these guarantees only hold if the calibration\nand test data are exchangeable, a condition that is difficult to verify and\noften violated in practice due to so-called distribution shifts. The literature\nis rife with methods to mitigate the loss in coverage in this non-exchangeable\nsetting, but these methods require some prior information on the type of\ndistribution shift to be expected at test time. In this work, we study this\nproblem via a new perspective, through the lens of optimal transport, and show\nthat it is possible to estimate the loss in coverage and mitigate it in case of\ndistribution shift.",

Using this concept as a lens to study\nhow GenAI tools are integrated into open-source software projects, we analyze a\ncurated sample of more than 250,000 GitHub repositories, identifying 1,292 such\nself-admissions across 156 repositories in commit messages, code comments, and\nproject documentation. Using a mixed methods approach, we derive a taxonomy of\n32 tasks, 10 content types, and 11 purposes associated with GenAI usage based\non 284 qualitatively coded mentions. We then analyze 13 documents with policies\nand usage guidelines for GenAI tools and conduct a developer survey to uncover\nthe ethical, legal, and practical concerns behind them. Our findings reveal\nthat developers actively manage how GenAI is used in their projects,\nhighlighting the need for project-level transparency, attribution, and quality\ncontrol practices in the new era of AI-assisted software development.

As we have identified that\nthe inconsistency between the numerically calculated magnetic field and\nmagnetic energy may be responsible for the loss of positivity of scalar\nvariables, we propose a physical consistency condition and implement it in\nHLL-type MHD Riemann solvers, thus alleviating the erroneous magnetic field\nsolutions breaking scalar positivity.

    "abstract": "A Leech pair is defined as a pair $(G,S)$, where $S$ is a positive definite\neven lattice without roots, equipped with a faithful action of a finite group\n$G$, such that the invariant sublattice of $S$ under the action of $G$ is\ntrivial, and the induced action of $G$ on the discriminant group of $S$ is also\ntrivial. This structure appears naturally when investigating hyperk\\\"ahler\nmanifolds and the symplectic automorphisms acting on them. An important lemma\ndue to Gaberdiel--Hohenegger--Volpato asserts that a Leech pair $(G,S)$ admits\na primitive embedding into the Leech lattice if $rank(S)+\\ell(A_S)\\le 24$.\nHowever, the original proof is incomplete, as demonstrated by a counterexample\nprovided by Marquand and Muller. They also presented a computer-assisted proof\nof the lemma for cases where $rank(S) \\le 21$. In this paper, we modify the\noriginal approach to provide a complete and conceptual proof of the lemma.",

    "abstract": "The consensus problem, briefly stated, consists of having processes in an\nasynchronous distributed system agree on a value. It is widely known that the\nconsensus problem does not have a deterministic solution that ensures both\ntermination and consistency, if there is at least one faulty process in the\nsystem. This result, known as the FLP impossibility theorem, led to several\ngeneralizations and developments in theoretical distributed computing. This\npaper argues that the FLP impossibility theorem holds even under a generalized\ndefinition of computation through oracles. Furthermore, using a theoretical\nmachinery from complex systems, this paper also posits that inconsistency may\nbe an emergent feature of consensus over distributed systems by examining how a\nsystem transitions phases. Under the same complex systems framework, this paper\nexamines paraconsistent logics, arguing that while inconsistency is not an\nemergent feature for these logics, triviality may be. Lastly, some attention is\ngiven to the possibility of developing consensus algorithms capable of\nparaconsistent reasoning.",

    "abstract": "Semantic communication represents a promising technique towards reducing\ncommunication costs, especially when dealing with image segmentation, but it\nstill lacks a balance between computational efficiency and bandwidth\nrequirements while maintaining high image segmentation accuracy, particularly\nin resource-limited environments and changing channel conditions. On the other\nhand, the more complex and larger semantic image segmentation models become,\nthe more stressed the devices are when processing data. This paper proposes a\nnovel approach to implementing semantic communication based on splitting the\nsemantic image segmentation process between a resource constrained transmitter\nand the receiver. This allows saving bandwidth by reducing the transmitted data\nwhile maintaining the accuracy of the semantic image segmentation.\nAdditionally, it reduces the computational requirements at the resource\nconstrained transmitter compared to doing all the semantic image segmentation\nin the transmitter. The proposed approach is evaluated by means of\nsimulation-based experiments in terms of different metrics such as\ncomputational resource usage, required bit rate and segmentation accuracy. The\nresults when comparing the proposal with the full semantic image segmentation\nin the transmitter show that up to 72% of the bit rate was reduced in the\ntransmission process. In addition, the computational load of the transmitter is\nreduced by more than 19%.

Based on the Binomial and\nPoisson regression models, we propose a two-step semiparametric empirical\nlikelihood approach for abundance estimation in the presence of missing\ncovariates, regardless of whether the fully observed covariates are discrete or\ncontinuous. We show that the maximum semiparametric empirical likelihood\nestimators for the underlying parameters and the abundance are asymptotically\nnormal, and more efficient than the counterpart for a completely known\nnon-missingness probability. After scaling, the empirical likelihood ratio test\nstatistic for abundance follows a limiting chi-square distribution with one\ndegree of freedom. The proposed approach is further extended to one-inflated\ncount regression models, and a score-like test is constructed to assess whether\none-inflation exists among the number of captures. Our simulation shows that,\ncompared with the previous method, the proposed method not only performs better\nin correcting bias, but also has a more accurate coverage in the presence of\nfully observed continuous covariates, although there may be a slight efficiency\nloss when the fully observed covariates are only discrete.

The Tc^onset firstly ramps up with pressure, then\nit slightly drops down after reaching the maximum Tc^onset at about 61.5 K\nunder a pressure of 9 GPa, showing a dome-like phase diagram. Hall effect\nmeasurements reveal that the dominant charge carriers are hole-like with a\nslight enhancement of charge carrier density with pressure in accompanying with\nthe increase of Tc. Our theoretical results demonstrate that the enhancement of\nTc arises from a cooperative amplification of magnetic fluctuations within and\nbetween the layers and increased metallicity under pressure. However, this\nenhancement exhibits saturation at higher pressures. These findings highlight\nthe critical role of the interplay between interlayer and intralayer electronic\ncorrelations in bilayer nickelate superconductors and point to the potential of\ntuning Tc through controlled manipulation of the electronic structure and\ninteractions.",

Analysis of capture-recapture data is often complicated by\nthe existence of one-inflation and heterogeneity problems. Simultaneously\ntaking these issues into account, existing abundance estimation methods are\nusually constructed on the basis of conditional likelihood (CL) under\none-inflated zero-truncated count models. However, the resulting\nHorvitz-Thompson-type estimators may be unstable, and the resulting Wald-type\nconfidence intervals may exhibit severe undercoverage. In this paper, we\npropose a semiparametric empirical likelihood (EL) approach to abundance\nestimation under one-inflated binomial and Poisson regression models. We show\nthat the maximum EL estimator for the abundance follows an asymptotically\nnormal distribution and that the EL ratio statistic of abundance follows a\nlimiting chi-square distribution with one degree of freedom. To facilitate\ncomputation of the EL method, we develop an expectation-maximization (EM)\nalgorithm, and establish its appealing convergence property. We also propose a\nnew score test for the existence of one-inflation and prove its asymptotic\nnormality. Our simulation studies indicate that compared with CL-based methods,\nthe maximum EL estimator has a smaller mean square error, the EL ratio\nconfidence interval has a remarkable gain in coverage probability, and the\nproposed score test is more powerful.

    "abstract": "Topological data analysis (TDA) is a relatively new field that is gaining\nrapid adoption due to its robustness and ability to effectively describe\ncomplex datasets by quantifying geometric information. In imaging contexts, TDA\ntypically models data as filtered cubical complexes from which we can extract\ndiscriminative features using persistence homology. Meanwhile, convolutional\nneural networks (CNNs) have been shown to be biased towards texture based local\nfeatures. To address this limitation, we propose a TDA feature engineering\npipeline and a simple method to integrate topological features with deep\nlearning models on remote sensing classification. Our method improves the\nperformance of a ResNet18 model on the EuroSAT dataset by 1.44% achieving\n99.33% accuracy, which surpasses all previously reported single-model\naccuracies, including those with larger architectures, such as ResNet50 (2x\nlarger) and XL Vision Transformers (197x larger). We additionally show that our\nmethod's accuracy is 1.82% higher than our ResNet18 baseline on the RESISC45\ndataset. To our knowledge, this is the first application of TDA features in\nsatellite scene classification with deep learning. This demonstrates that TDA\nfeatures can be integrated with deep learning models, even on datasets without\nexplicit topological structures, thereby increasing the applicability of TDA. A\nclean implementation of our method will be made publicly available upon\npublication.",

We have determined the HCN, HNC,\nand N2H+ isotopic ratios and the chemical age in a large sample of 23 starless\ncores located in different environments. This work uses IRAM 30m data to\nconstrain the D/H ratio of HCN, HNC, and N2H+ as well as the 14N/15N ratio of\nHCN and HNC. The observed abundances have been modeled using the chemical code\nDNAUTILUS 2.0. Deuterated compounds are detected in all of our sample cores,\nwith average DNC/HNC, DCN/HCN, and N2D+/N2H+ values of 0.054$\\pm$0.019,\n0.036$\\pm$0.033, and 0.15$\\pm$0.11, respectively. The deuterium fractions\n(Dfrac) show a weak correlation with temperature and a large scatter that\nreflects that other factors such as core evolution could also play a\nsignificant role. Our chemical model is able to reproduce all the observed\nvalues with 0.2-0.3 Myr in Taurus and 0.3-0.5 Myr in Perseus and Orion. The\n14N/15N isotopic ratio is found to be different between HCN/HC15N (430$\\pm$120)\nand HNC/H15NC (296$\\pm$64). We find no correlation between these ratios and the\ndeuterium fractions, but we report a weak correlation with temperature. The\nDfrac of HCN, HNC, and N2H+ can be used as evolutionary tracers of starless\ncores as long as the physical parameters are well constrained. The HCN/HC15N\nand HNC/H15NC ratios are not correlated with Dfrac, suggesting that the\ndetected variations are not correlated with the core evolutionary stage. The\naverage value of the HCN/HC15N ratio in our sample is significantly higher than\nthe values measured in protostars and protoplanetary disks, possibly indicating\nthat nitrogen fractionation processes are taking place during the protostellar\nphase.",

This is typically done by fitting the optimal\nkappa distribution function and interpreting its so-called q-statistics to\ncharacterize the magnetic field increments. Using this approach, recent\nfindings concluded that beyond a certain distance, the magnetic field\nincrements in the very local interstellar medium (VLISM) follow Gaussian\nstatistics, unlike those both inside the heliosphere and in the region just\nbeyond the widely accepted heliopause location, raising questions about the\nheliopause identification. This study explores this issue in detail by (1)\noptimizing the derivation of the distribution function, (2) examining whether\nand how the results depend on increment windows and time periods, and (3)\ndetermining the statistical behavior of the examined time series. Using\nmagnetic field measurements from Voyager 1, we present two independent\ntechniques and introduce a statistical framework to systematically analyze the\ndistributions of magnetic field increments. Contrary to previous findings, we\nfind that magnetic field increments in the VLISM do not follow a Gaussian\ndistribution (k to infinity) and instead are in the non-Gaussian range of kappa\nvalues (3-7, when analyzed on a 30-day statistical period). We further\ndemonstrate how erroneous, statistically induced results can arise that mimic\nGaussian-like results when mixing different structures in such analyses. Our\nresults show that Voyager 1 still travels in the intermittent magnetic field\nenvironment of the VLISM.",

We aim to investigate how the structure and nucleosynthesis\nevolve and how these processes influence the stellar fate. We computed stellar\nmodels using the GENEC code, including updated rates for\n12C({\\alpha},{\\gamma})16O and, for the three fusion reactions, new rates\nfollowing a fusion suppression scenario and new theoretical rates obtained with\nTDHF calculations. The updated 12C({\\alpha},{\\gamma})16O rates mainly impact\nthe chemical structure evolution changing the 12C/16O ratio with little effect\non the CO core mass. This variation in the 12C/16O ratio is critical for\npredicting the stellar fate, which is very sensitive to 12C abundance. The\ncombined new rates for 12C+12C and 16O+16O fusion reactions according to the\nHIN(RES) model lead to shorter C- and O-burning lifetimes, and shift the\nignition conditions to higher temperatures and densities. Theoretical TDHF\nrates primarily affect C-burning, increasing its duration and lowering the\nignition temperature. These changes alter the core chemical structure, the\ncarbon shell size and duration, and hence the compactness. They also affect\nnucleosynthesis. This work shows that accurate reaction rates for key processes\nin massive star evolution drive significant changes in stellar burning\nlifetimes, chemical evolution, and stellar fate.

A difficulty in areas such as genomics, where the\nnumber of candidate variables is vast, arises from the need for preliminary\nreduction prior to the assessment of models. The present paper considers a\nresolution using inferential separations fundamental to the Fisherian approach\nto conditional inference, namely, the sufficiency/co-sufficiency separation,\nand the ancillary/co-ancillary separation. The advantage of these separations\nis that no direction for departure from any hypothesised model is needed,\navoiding issues that would otherwise arise from using the same data for\nreduction and for model assessment. In idealised cases with no nuisance\nparameters, the separations extract all the information in the data, solely for\nthe purpose for which it is useful, without loss or redundancy. The extent to\nwhich estimation of nuisance parameters affects the idealised information\nextraction is illustrated in detail for the normal-theory linear regression\nmodel, extending immediately to a log-normal accelerated-life model for\ntime-to-event outcomes. This idealised analysis provides insight into when\nsample-splitting is likely to perform as well as, or better than, the\nco-sufficient or ancillary tests, and when it may be unreliable. The\nconsiderations involved in extending the detailed implementation to canonical\nexponential-family and more general regression models are briefly discussed.

By tracking thermodynamic parameters along streamlines, we analyze the\neffects of shock heating and subsequent expansion cooling on chemical reaction\npathways. Our results demonstrate that chemical quenching occurs when the\ncooling timescale surpasses reaction rates, leading to the formation of\ndistinct chemical products that deviate from equilibrium predictions. We show\nthat the efficiency of molecular synthesis depends on the\nobject\\textquotesingle s size and velocity, influencing the composition of the\npost-entry gas mixture. Applying our model to Titan, we demonstrate that\norganic matter can be synthesized in the present environment of Titan. Also, we\nfind that nitrogen, the dominant atmospheric component, remains stable, while\nwater vapor is efficiently removed, a result inconsistent with equilibrium\nchemistry assumptions. Moreover, we compare our simulation results with laser\nexperiments and find good agreement in chemical yields. Finally, we also\nevaluate the impact on Titan\\textquotesingle s atmosphere as a whole, showing\nthat meteoroid entry events could have played a significant role in supplying\nmolecules such as HCN during early Titan\\textquotesingle s history.",

This study systematically evaluates\nseveral DeepONet architectures for the one-dimensional consolidation problem.\nWe initially consider three architectures: a standard DeepONet with the\ncoefficient of consolidation embedded in the branch net (Models 1 and 2), and a\nphysics-inspired architecture with the coefficient embedded in the trunk net\n(Model 3). Results show that Model 3 outperforms the standard configurations\n(Models 1 and 2) but still has limitations when the target solution (excess\npore pressures) exhibits significant variation. To overcome this limitation, we\npropose a Trunknet Fourier feature-enhanced DeepONet (Model 4) that addresses\nthe identified limitations by capturing rapidly varying functions. All proposed\narchitectures achieve speedups ranging from 1.5 to 100 times over traditional\nexplicit and implicit solvers, with Model 4 being the most efficient. Larger\ncomputational savings are expected for more complex systems than the explored\n1D case, which is promising. Overall, the study highlights the potential of\nDeepONets to enable efficient, generalizable surrogate modeling in geotechnical\napplications, advancing the integration of scientific machine learning in\ngeotechnics, which is at an early stage.",

In the short time since their introduction, classical shadows\nreceived a lot of attention from the physics, quantum information, and quantum\ncomputing (including cryptography) communities. In particular there has been a\nmajor effort focused on improving the efficiency, and in particular depth, of\ngenerating the classical snapshot.\n  Existing constructions rely on a distribution of unitaries as a central\nbuilding block, and research is devoted to simplifying this family as much as\npossible. We diverge from this paradigm and show that suitable distributions\nover \\emph{states} can be used as the building block instead. Concretely, we\ncreate the snapshot by entangling the unknown input state with an independently\nprepared auxiliary state, and measuring the resulting entangled state. This\nstate-based approach allows us to consider a building block with arguably\nweaker properties that has not been studied so far in the context of classical\nshadows. Notably, our cryptographically-inspired analysis shows that for\n\\emph{efficiently computable} observables, it suffices to use\n\\emph{pseudorandom} families of states. To the best of our knowledge,\n\\emph{computational} classical shadow tomography was not considered in the\nliterature prior to our work.\n  Finally, in terms of efficiency, the online part of our method (i.e.\\ the\npart that depends on the input) is simply performing a measurement in the Bell\nbasis, which can be done in constant depth using elementary gates.",

    "abstract": "Current count-rate models for single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs)\ntypically assume an instantaneous recovery of the quantum efficiency following\ndead-time, leading to a systematic overestimation of the effective detection\nefficiency for high photon flux. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a\ngeneralized analytical count-rate model for free-running SPADs that models the\nnon-instantaneous, exponential recovery of the quantum efficiency following\ndead-time. Our model, framed within the theory of non-homogeneous Poisson\nprocesses, only requires one additional detector parameter -- the\nexponential-recovery time constant $\\tau_\\mathrm{r}$. The model accurately\npredicts detection statistics deep into the saturation regime, outperforming\nthe conventional step-function model by two orders of magnitude in terms of the\nimpinging photon rate. For extremely high photon flux, we further extend the\nmodel to capture paralyzation effects. Beyond photon flux estimation, our model\nsimplifies SPAD characterization by enabling the extraction of quantum\nefficiency $\\eta_0$, dead-time $\\tau_\\mathrm{d}$, and recovery time constant\n$\\tau_\\mathrm{r}$ from a single inter-detection interval histogram. This can be\nachieved with a simple setup, without the need for pulsed lasers or externally\ngated detectors. We anticipate broad applicability of our model in quantum key\ndistribution (QKD), time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC), LIDAR, and\nrelated areas.

In these systems,\na fraction of the laser light that is applied locally to implement gates\ntypically leaks to other atoms. We analyze the resulting crosstalk in a setup\nof two gate atoms and one neighboring third atom. We then perturbatively derive\na spin-echo-inspired gate protocol that suppresses the leading order of the\namplitude error, which dominates the crosstalk. Numerical simulations\ndemonstrate that our gate protocol improves the fidelity by two orders of\nmagnitude across a broad range of experimentally relevant parameters.

    "abstract": "Textual adapter-based tuning methods have shown significant potential in\ntransferring knowledge from pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to\ndownstream tasks. Existing works generally employ the deterministic textual\nfeature adapter to refine each category textual representation. However, due to\ninherent factors such as different attributes and contexts, there exists\nsignificant diversity in textual descriptions for each category. Such\ndescription diversity offers rich discriminative semantic knowledge that can\nbenefit downstream visual learning tasks. Obviously, traditional deterministic\nadapter model cannot adequately capture this varied semantic information. Also,\nit is desirable to exploit the inter-class relationships in VLM adapter. To\naddress these issues, we propose to exploit random graph model into VLM adapter\nand develop a novel Vertex Random Graph Adapter (VRGAdapter). VRGAdapter first\nmodels the inherent diverse descriptions of each category and inter-class\nrelationships of different categories simultaneously by leveraging a Vertex\nRandom Knowledge Graph (VRKG) model. Then, it employs probabilistic message\npropagation on VRKG to learn context-aware distribution representation for each\nclass node. Finally, it adopts a reparameterized sampling function to achieve\ntextual adapter learning. Note that, VRGAdapter provides a more general adapter\nsolution that encompasses traditional graph-based adapter as a special case. In\naddition, to enable more robust performance for downstream tasks, we also\nintroduce a new Uncertainty-guided Multi-branch Fusion (UMF) scheme that\ndynamically integrates multiple pre-trained models for ensemble prediction.\nExtensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our approach.",

To better aggregate knowledge from clients,\nensemble distillation, as a widely used and effective technique, is often\nemployed after global aggregation to enhance the performance of the global\nmodel. However, simply combining Hetero-FL and ensemble distillation does not\nalways yield promising results and can make the training process unstable. The\nreason is that existing methods primarily focus on logit distillation, which,\nwhile being model-agnostic with softmax predictions, fails to compensate for\nthe knowledge bias arising from heterogeneous models. To tackle this challenge,\nwe propose a stable and efficient Feature Distillation for model-heterogeneous\nFederated learning, dubbed FedFD, that can incorporate aligned feature\ninformation via orthogonal projection to integrate knowledge from heterogeneous\nmodels better. Specifically, a new feature-based ensemble federated knowledge\ndistillation paradigm is proposed. The global model on the server needs to\nmaintain a projection layer for each client-side model architecture to align\nthe features separately. Orthogonal techniques are employed to re-parameterize\nthe projection layer to mitigate knowledge bias from heterogeneous models and\nthus maximize the distilled knowledge.

    "abstract": "In this paper we prove a sharpened asymptotic for the growth of analytic\ntorsion of congruence quotients of\n$\\operatorname{SL}(n,\\mathbb{R})/\\operatorname{SO}(n)$ in terms of the volume.\nThe result is based on a new bound on the trace of the heat kernel in this\nsetting, allowing control of the large time behaviour of certain orbital\nintegrals, as well as a careful analysis of error terms. The result requires\nthe existence of $\\lambda$-strongly acyclic representations, which we define\nand show exists in plenitude for any $\\lambda$. The motivation is possible\napplications to torsion in the cohomology of arithmetic groups, although the\nconnection in this setting is as of yet conjectural.",

    "abstract": "Assertion-Based Verification (ABV) is critical for ensuring functional\ncorrectness in modern hardware systems. However, manually writing high-quality\nSVAs remains labor-intensive and error-prone. To bridge this gap, we propose\nAssertCoder, a novel unified framework that automatically generates\nhigh-quality SVAs directly from multimodal hardware design specifications.\nAssertCoder employs a modality-sensitive preprocessing to parse heterogeneous\nspecification formats (text, tables, diagrams, and formulas), followed by a set\nof dedicated semantic analyzers that extract structured representations aligned\nwith signal-level semantics. These representations are utilized to drive\nassertion synthesis via multi-step chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. The\nframework incorporates a mutation-based evaluation approach to assess assertion\nquality via model checking and further refine the generated assertions.\nExperimental evaluation across three real-world Register-Transfer Level (RTL)\ndesigns demonstrates AssertCoder's superior performance, achieving an average\nincrease of 8.4% in functional correctness and 5.8% in mutation detection\ncompared to existing state-of-the-art approaches.",

With the\nincreasing complexity and widespread adoption ofmodern software systems and IoT\ndevices, the daily volume of log generation has surged to tens of petabytes,\nleading to significant collection and storage costs. To address this challenge,\nlossless log compression has emerged as an effective solution, enabling\nsubstantial resource savings without compromising log information. In this\npaper, we first conduct a characterization study on extensive public log\ndatasets and identify four key observations. Building on these insights, we\npropose LogLite, a lightweight, plug-and-play, streaming lossless compression\nalgorithm designed to handle both TEXT and JSON logs throughout their life\ncycle. LogLite requires no predefined rules or pre-training and is inherently\nadaptable to evolving log structures. Our evaluation shows that, compared to\nstate-of-the-art baselines, LogLite achieves Pareto optimality in most\nscenarios, delivering an average improvement of up to 67.8% in compression\nratio and up to 2.7 $\\times$ in compression speed.",

Such method provide a unified proof\nof the smoothness for general exponents.\n  On the other hand, by exploiting the higher regularity of solutions, we\nderive a new stability condition for the Alt-Phillips problem in the negative\nexponent regime, ruling out the existence of nontrivial axially symmetric\nstable cones in low dimensions. Finally, we provide a variational criterion for\nthe stability of cones in the Alt-Phillips problem, which recovers the one for\nminimal surfaces in the singular limit as $\\gamma \\to -2$.",

    "abstract": "Motion capture (MoCap) data from wearable Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs)\nis vital for applications in sports science, but its utility is often\ncompromised by missing data. Despite numerous imputation techniques, a\nsystematic performance evaluation for IMU-derived MoCap time-series data is\nlacking. We address this gap by conducting a comprehensive comparative analysis\nof statistical, machine learning, and deep learning imputation methods. Our\nevaluation considers three distinct contexts: univariate time-series,\nmultivariate across subjects, and multivariate across kinematic angles. To\nfacilitate this benchmark, we introduce the first publicly available MoCap\ndataset designed specifically for imputation, featuring data from 53 karate\npractitioners. We simulate three controlled missingness mechanisms: missing\ncompletely at random (MCAR), block missingness, and a novel value-dependent\npattern at signal transition points. Our experiments, conducted on 39 kinematic\nvariables across all subjects, reveal that multivariate imputation frameworks\nconsistently outperform univariate approaches, particularly for complex\nmissingness. For instance, multivariate methods achieve up to a 50% mean\nabsolute error reduction (MAE from 10.8 to 5.8) compared to univariate\ntechniques for transition point missingness. Advanced models like Generative\nAdversarial Imputation Networks (GAIN) and Iterative Imputers demonstrate the\nhighest accuracy in these challenging scenarios. This work provides a critical\nbaseline for future research and offers practical recommendations for improving\nthe integrity and robustness of Mo-Cap data analysis.",

Contrary to the intuitive expectation of a positive green\npremium, we find no evidence that climate-friendly products are priced higher.\nIn some product categories, products with better climate scores are in fact\nassociated with lower prices, suggesting a negative premium, an outcome that\ngives rise to what we refer to as the green premium puzzle. We argue that\nmarket frictions such as competing consumer priorities, psychological distance\nfrom climate issues, and skepticism toward environmental labeling may suppress\nthe price signals intended to reward sustainable consumption.

Motivated by higher male infant mortality and the tendency to try again\nafter a child's death, our model allows different continuation probabilities\nafter sons and daughters. We find that a stable sex ratio at birth (SRB)\ndiffering from 1:1 can arise when these continuation probabilities differ.\nHowever, the sex ratio among last-born children (SRLB) always converges to 1:1.\nWe mathematically prove that this 1:1 SRLB is an evolutionarily stable strategy\nunder a new fitness measure based on the number of offspring in successful\nmating pairs, rather than the number of descendants in the whole population.\nOur results generalize Fisher's principle by showing that equilibrium is\nmaintained at the level of last births even when the overall SRB is biased.\nThis offers a potential explanation for the persistent slight male bias in\nhuman births, linking it to sex-specific child mortality and parental\nreproductive strategies in historical populations.",

    "abstract": "Despite advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP), models remain\nvulnerable to adversarial attacks, such as synonym substitutions. While prior\nwork has focused on improving robustness for feed-forward and convolutional\narchitectures, the robustness of recurrent networks and modern state space\nmodels (SSMs), such as S4, remains understudied. These architectures pose\nunique challenges due to their sequential processing and complex parameter\ndynamics. In this paper, we introduce a novel regularization technique based on\nGrowth Bound Matrices (GBM) to improve NLP model robustness by reducing the\nimpact of input perturbations on model outputs. We focus on computing the GBM\nfor three architectures: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), State Space models\n(S4), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Our method aims to (1) enhance\nresilience against word substitution attacks, (2) improve generalization on\nclean text, and (3) providing the first systematic analysis of SSM (S4)\nrobustness. Extensive experiments across multiple architectures and benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate that our method improves adversarial robustness by up to\n8.8% over existing baselines. These results highlight the effectiveness of our\napproach, outperforming several state-of-the-art methods in adversarial\ndefense. Codes are available at https://github.com/BouriMohammed/GBM",

    "abstract": "Quantum phase transitions are typically marked by changes in quantum\ncorrelations across various spatial scales within the system. A key challenge\nlies in the fact that experimental probes are generally restricted to diagonal\nquantities at the single-site scale, which are widely believed to be\ninsufficient for detecting phases with off-diagonal long-range order, such as\nsuperconducting states. In a striking departure from conventional expectations,\nwe show that single-site diagonal descriptors -- charge and spin fluctuations,\noccupation probabilities, and entanglement -- can capture the emergence of\noff-diagonal long-range order in the one-dimensional extended Hubbard model at\nhalf-filling. These single-site quantities display clear critical signatures of\nthe superconducting transition, preceded by a continuous breaking of\nparticle-hole symmetry, consistent with a second-order phase transition. While\nthis symmetry breaking has a negligible effect on single-site descriptors, it\nallows a direct connection between local fluctuations and nonlocal\ncorrelations.",

    "abstract": "The wide range of deformation artifacts that arise from complex light\npropagation, scattering, and depth-dependent attenuation makes the underwater\nimage restoration to remain a challenging problem. Like other single deep\nregressor networks, conventional GAN-based restoration methods struggle to\nperform well across this heterogeneous domain, since a single generator network\nis typically insufficient to capture the full range of visual degradations. In\norder to overcome this limitation, we propose xOp-GAN, a novel GAN model with\nseveral expert generator networks, each trained solely on a particular subset\nwith a certain image quality. Thus, each generator can learn to maximize its\nrestoration performance for a particular quality range. Once a xOp-GAN is\ntrained, each generator can restore the input image and the best restored image\ncan then be selected by the discriminator based on its perceptual confidence\nscore. As a result, xOP-GAN is the first GAN model with multiple generators\nwhere the discriminator is being used during the inference of the regression\ntask. Experimental results on benchmark Large Scale Underwater Image (LSUI)\ndataset demonstrates that xOp-GAN achieves PSNR levels up to 25.16 dB,\nsurpassing all single-regressor models by a large margin even, with reduced\ncomplexity.",

    "abstract": "Prompt engineering has proven to be a crucial step in leveraging pretrained\nlarge language models (LLMs) in solving various real-world tasks. Numerous\nsolutions have been proposed that seek to automate prompt engineering by using\nthe model itself to edit prompts. However, the majority of state-of-the-art\napproaches are evaluated on tasks that require minimal prompt templates and on\nvery large and highly capable LLMs. In contrast, solving complex tasks that\nrequire detailed information to be included in the prompt increases the amount\nof text that needs to be optimised. Furthermore, smaller models have been shown\nto be more sensitive to prompt design. To address these challenges, we propose\nan evolutionary search approach to automated discrete prompt optimisation\nconsisting of two phases. In the first phase, grammar-guided genetic\nprogramming is invoked to synthesise prompt-creating programmes by searching\nthe space of programmes populated by function compositions of syntactic,\ndictionary-based and LLM-based prompt-editing functions. In the second phase,\nlocal search is applied to explore the neighbourhoods of best-performing\nprogrammes in an attempt to further fine-tune their performance. Our approach\noutperforms three state-of-the-art prompt optimisation approaches,\nPromptWizard, OPRO, and RL-Prompt, on three relatively small general-purpose\nLLMs in four domain-specific challenging tasks. We also illustrate several\nexamples where these benchmark methods suffer relatively severe performance\ndegradation, while our approach improves performance in almost all task-model\ncombinations, only incurring minimal degradation when it does not.",

    "abstract": "Leveraging the vision foundation models has emerged as a mainstream paradigm\nthat improves the performance of image feature matching. However, previous\nworks have ignored the misalignment when introducing the foundation models into\nfeature matching. The misalignment arises from the discrepancy between the\nfoundation models focusing on single-image understanding and the cross-image\nunderstanding requirement of feature matching. Specifically, 1) the embeddings\nderived from commonly used foundation models exhibit discrepancies with the\noptimal embeddings required for feature matching; 2) lacking an effective\nmechanism to leverage the single-image understanding ability into cross-image\nunderstanding. A significant consequence of the misalignment is they struggle\nwhen addressing multi-instance feature matching problems. To address this, we\nintroduce a simple but effective framework, called IMD (Image feature Matching\nwith a pre-trained Diffusion model) with two parts: 1) Unlike the dominant\nsolutions employing contrastive-learning based foundation models that emphasize\nglobal semantics, we integrate the generative-based diffusion models to\neffectively capture instance-level details. 2) We leverage the prompt mechanism\nin generative model as a natural tunnel, propose a novel cross-image\ninteraction prompting module to facilitate bidirectional information\ninteraction between image pairs. To more accurately measure the misalignment,\nwe propose a new benchmark called IMIM, which focuses on multi-instance\nscenarios. Our proposed IMD establishes a new state-of-the-art in commonly\nevaluated benchmarks, and the superior improvement 12% in IMIM indicates our\nmethod efficiently mitigates the misalignment.",

SVGPR is an approximation to standard GPR, the latter of which\nsuffers severe computational scaling with N and assumes independently\ndistributed Gaussian Noise. In the Galaxy however, velocity measurements\nexhibit scatter from both observational uncertainty and the intrinsic velocity\ndispersion of the distribution function. We exploit the factorization property\nof the objective function in SVGPR to simultaneously model both the mean\nvelocity field and velocity dispersion tensor as separate Gaussian Processes.\nThis achieves a computational complexity of O(M^3) versus GPR's O(N^3), where M\n<< N is a subset of points chosen in a principled way to summarize the data.\nApplied to a sample of ~8 x 10^5 stars from the Gaia DR3 Radial Velocity\nSurvey, we construct differentiable profiles of the mean velocity and velocity\ndispersion as functions of height above the Galactic midplane. We find\nasymmetric features in all three diagonal components of the velocity dispersion\ntensor, providing evidence that the vertical dynamics of the Milky Way are in a\nstate of disequilibrium.

Yet, other formation channels - involving close binary\nevolution - have recently been proposed and could lead to similar surface\ncompositions. Here we present a non-local thermodynamic equilibrium spectral\nanalysis based on new UV and archival optical spectra of one of the hottest PG\n1159 stars, $\\text{RX J}0122.9\\text{ -}7521$. We find $T_\\text{eff} = 175$ kK\nand a surface gravity of log $g = 7.7$, and an astonishingly low O/C ratio of\n$7.3 \\times 10^{-3}$ by mass. By combining the spectroscopic surface gravity\nand Gaia parallax with a spectral energy distribution fit, we derive a mass of\n$M_\\text{spec} = 1.8^{+1.1}_{-0.7}$ $M_\\odot$. Although this spectroscopic mass\nis higher than predicted by evolutionary models, it is subject to substantial\nuncertainty. Furthermore, we find that $\\text{RX J}0122.9\\text{ -}7521$ shows\nstrongly rotationally broadened lines, suggesting that the previously reported\nphotometric period of $41$ min indeed corresponds to the rotational period of\nthis star. Our kinematic analysis shows that $\\text{RX J}0122.9\\text{ -}7521$\nbelongs to the Galactic halo, which - assuming single-star evolution - is in\nstark contrast to its relatively high mass. The rapid rotation, high mass, and\nhalo kinematics, as well as the lack of evidence for a close companion, lead us\nto believe that $\\text{RX J}0122.9\\text{ -}7521$ formed through the merger of\ntwo white dwarfs.

Path following\nis a typical use case for model predictive control (MPC), but formulating\nconstraints for obstacle avoidance is challenging in this case. Typically the\ncost and constraints of an MPC problem are defined as closed-form functions and\ntypical solvers work best with continuously differentiable functions. This is\ncontrary to spatially discrete occupancy grid maps, in which a grid's value\ndefines the cost associated with occupancy. This paper presents a way to\novercome this compatibility issue by re-formulating occupancy grid maps to\ncontinuously differentiable functions to be embedded into the MPC scheme as\nconstraints. Each obstacle is defined as a polygon -- an intersection of\nhalf-spaces. Any half-space is a linear inequality representing one edge of a\npolygon. Using AND and OR operators, the combined set of all obstacles and\ntherefore the obstacle avoidance constraints can be described. The key\ncontribution of this paper is the use of fuzzy logic to re-formulate such\nconstraints that include logical operators as inequality constraints which are\ncompatible with standard MPC formulation. The resulting MPC-based trajectory\nplanner is successfully tested in simulation. This concept is also applicable\noutside of navigation tasks to implement logical or verbal constraints in MPC.",

Such simulators are common across various scientific\ndisciplines; however, emulating their entire conditional probability\ndistribution is challenging, as it is a task traditional deterministic\nsurrogate modeling techniques are not designed for. Additionally, accurately\ncharacterizing the response distribution can require prohibitively large\ndatasets, especially for computationally expensive high-fidelity (HF)\nsimulators.

    "abstract": "Solar activity events release vast amounts of energy, including radio waves,\nX-rays, ultraviolet radiation, and energetic particles, which interact with the\nionosphere of the Earth and can disrupt radio wave propagation, affecting radio\ncommunications. They can either enhance reflections, improving long-distance\nterrestrial communications, or cause signal degradation and absorption,\nrespectively, depending on whether the increased ionization affects the upper\nor lower layers of the ionosphere. In the first case, the solar cycle modulates\nthe Maximum Usable Frequency (MUF), the highest frequency usable for radio\ncommunication between two Earth-based points. The Auger Engineering Radio Array\n(AERA) of the Pierre Auger Observatory was developed to measure the radio\nemission from extensive air showers in the $30-80$ MHz band. We examine the\nimpact of solar activity on AERA data collected over approximately 11 years. We\nreport the detection of different types of solar radio bursts and we\ninvestigate how increased solar radiation - particularly in the X-ray and\nextreme ultraviolet bands - also affects measurements in the AERA energy band.\nOur results show a remarkable correlation between the MUF and the broadband\nnoise observed in the $30-40$ MHz frequency range. Radio blackouts are also\nobserved in AERA spectrograms in coincidence with those reported by the\nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Additionally, we\nperformed a search for temporal coincidences between AERA data and independent\nobservations of solar radio burst events from the e-CALLISTO network and the\nSWAVES instrument. These findings highlight the complex interplay between solar\nactivity and radio wave propagation, which is also relevant for cosmic-ray\ndetection.",

In this paper, we focus on the\nhierarchical $k$ -median clustering problem, which bridges hierarchical and\ncentroid-based clustering while offering theoretical appeal, practical utility,\nand improved interpretability. We analyze the average sensitivity of algorithms\nfor this problem by measuring the expected change in the output when a random\ndata point is deleted.

Traditional methods struggle to preserve fine-grained,\nidentity-specific features when degradation is severe, often producing\naverage-looking faces that lack individual characteristics. To address these\nchallenges, we introduce IP-FVR, a novel method that leverages a high-quality\nreference face image as a visual prompt to provide identity conditioning during\nthe denoising process. IP-FVR incorporates semantically rich identity\ninformation from the reference image using decoupled cross-attention\nmechanisms, ensuring detailed and identity consistent results. For intra-clip\nidentity drift (within 24 frames), we introduce an identity-preserving feedback\nlearning method that combines cosine similarity-based reward signals with\nsuffix-weighted temporal aggregation. This approach effectively minimizes drift\nwithin sequences of frames. For inter-clip identity drift, we develop an\nexponential blending strategy that aligns identities across clips by\niteratively blending frames from previous clips during the denoising process.\nThis method ensures consistent identity representation across different clips.\nAdditionally, we enhance the restoration process with a multi-stream negative\nprompt, guiding the model's attention to relevant facial attributes and\nminimizing the generation of low-quality or incorrect features. Extensive\nexperiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that IP-FVR\noutperforms existing methods in both quality and identity preservation,\nshowcasing its substantial potential for practical applications in face video\nrestoration.",

We perform a systematic study of these effects in a\ncircuit QED model of qubit-oscillator system and find that the features of\ncurrent and rectification crucially depend on the qubit-oscillator coupling.\nWhile at small coupling, transport occurs via a resonant mechanism between the\nsub-systems, in the ultrastrong coupling regime the junction is a unique,\nhighly hybridized system and the current becomes largely insensitive to the\ndetuning.

In the\nnonlinear transport regime, the coupling strength determines whether the\ncurrent scales sub- or super-linearly with the temperature bias and whether the\nrectification, which increases in magnitude with the bias, is positive or\nnegative. We also find that steady-state coherence largely suppresses the\ncurrent and enhances rectification. An insight on these behaviors with respect\nto changes in the system parameters is provided by analytical approximate\nformulas.",

These theories are based on\nextensive observations of high-energy solar processes, providing substantial\ndirect evidence in the MeV energy range. Although the model is widely and\nsuccessfully used to explain high-energy cosmic phenomena, direct validation\nhas been elusive. The multi-wavelength spectra and angular profile measurements\nof the Geminga pulsar wind nebula and its pulsar halo, particularly the precise\nspectral observations by HAWC and LHAASO-KM2A in recent years, offer a rare\nopportunity to test these theories with cosmic rays energies between 1 TeV and\nseveral hundred TeV. These observations are expected to elevate the direct\ntesting of theoretical models from multi-MeV to sub-PeV energies. In this work,\na method is developed to test the diffusive shock acceleration and diffusion\npropagation model between one and several hundred TeV energies through the\nlatest spectral and morphological data of the Geminga region from HAWC and\nFermi-LAT. Our results show that the theories of diffusive shock acceleration\nand diffusion propagation are consistent with experimental observations.\nHowever, the published morphological data adopted rather wide energy bins and\ncurrently do not allow a high precision test of the inferred energy dependent\ndiffusion coefficient by observed energy spectra with DSA theory. It is\nanticipated that future HAWC and LHAASO-KM2A observations will yield\nhigher-precision results, and the confirmation of a rapidly increasing\ndiffusion coefficient above 100 TeV would serve as important evidence\nsupporting the diffusive shock acceleration and diffusion propagation theory.",

Results indicate that the\nAfriTEC model effectively captures the diurnal and seasonal behavior of TEC,\nparticularly during equinoxes, with MAE values generally below 1.5 TECU and\ncorrelation coefficients exceeding 0.80. However, discrepancies emerge during\nsolstice periods and post-sunset hours, reflecting the model's limitations in\nrepresenting complex ionospheric processes such as the Equatorial Ionization\nAnomaly (EIA).

SAFE-T\nmodels the conditional likelihood of fragment-based molecular sequences given a\nbiological prompt, enabling principled scoring of molecules across tasks such\nas virtual screening, drug-target interaction prediction, and activity cliff\ndetection. Moreover, it supports goal-directed generation by sampling from this\nlearned distribution, aligning molecular design with biological objectives. In\ncomprehensive zero-shot evaluations across predictive (LIT-PCBA, DAVIS, KIBA,\nACNet) and generative (DRUG, PMO) benchmarks, SAFE-T consistently achieves\nperformance comparable to or better than existing approaches while being\nsignificantly faster.

    "abstract": "In 1977, Borodin and Kostochka conjectured that every graph with maximum\ndegree $\\Delta \\geq 9$ is $(\\Delta-1)$-colourable, unless it contains a clique\nof size $\\Delta$. In 1999, Reed confirmed the conjecture when $\\Delta\\geq\n10^{14}$.\n  We propose different generalisations of this conjecture for digraphs, and\nprove the analogue of Reed's result for each of them. The chromatic number and\nclique number are replaced respectively by the dichromatic number and the\nbiclique number of digraphs. If $D$ is a digraph such that\n$\\min(\\tilde{\\Delta}(D),\\Delta^+(D)) = \\Delta \\geq 9$, we conjecture that $D$\nhas dichromatic number at most $\\Delta-1$, unless either (i) $D$ contains a\nbiclique of size $\\Delta$, or (ii) $D$ contains a biclique $K$ of size\n$\\Delta-2$, a directed $3$-cycle $\\vec{C_3}$ disjoint from $K$, and all\npossible arcs in both directions between $\\vec{C_3}$ and $K$. If true, this\nimplies the conjecture of Borodin and Kostochka. We prove it when $\\Delta$ is\nlarge enough, thereby generalising the result of Reed.\n  We finally give a sufficient condition for a digraph $D$ to have dichromatic\nnumber at most $\\Delta_{\\min}(D)-1$, assuming that $\\Delta_{\\min}(D)$ is large\nenough. In particular, this holds when the underlying graph of $D$ has no\nclique of size $\\Delta_{\\min}(D)$, thus yielding a third independent\ngeneralisation of Reed's result. We further give a hardness result witnessing\nthat our sufficient condition is best possible.\n  To obtain these new upper bounds on the dichromatic number, we prove a dense\ndecomposition lemma for digraphs having large maximum degree, which generalises\nto the directed setting the so-called dense decomposition of graphs due to\nMolloy and Reed. We believe this may be of independent interest, especially as\na tool in various applications.",

After almost two decades, Auger Phase I has\nended the data taking and has already delivered many outstanding physics\nresults. The Auger Observatory is currently running in Phase II, with upgraded\ndetectors for enhanced data of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). During\nPhase I, several engineering detectors were developed and tested. Some of those\ndevelopments led to new detectors, which are now part of the upgraded\nObservatory. For Phase II, the WCDs were upgraded with a surface-scintillator\ndetector, a radio detector, a small photomultiplier, and an upgraded\nelectronics board, facilitating mass-sensitive measurements for source\nidentification of UHECRs. Moreover, an underground muon detector allows for a\ndirect measurement of the muon content of air showers. The Offline framework is\nthe main software for the event reconstruction and detector simulation at the\nPierre Auger Observatory. It is continuously being developed to accommodate\nchanges in the detector and new algorithms. It allows the running of various\napplications, which are made up of individual modules, either on raw data or\nsimulations on an event-by-event basis.

Because tunnelling also enables atomic-scale spatial\nresolution in scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM), integrating STM with light\npulses has long been a key objective in ultrafast microscopy, spanning the\npicosecond and femtosecond domains, with first signatures of attosecond\ndynamics. However, while sub-cycle dynamics on the attosecond time scale are\nroutinely controlled and determined with high precision, controlling the\ndirection of attosecond currents and determining their duration have remained\nelusive in STM. Here, we induce STM tunnelling currents using two-colour laser\npulses and dynamically control their direction, relying solely on the sub-cycle\nwaveform of the pulses. Projecting our measurement data onto numerical and\nanalytical solutions of the time-dependent Schr\\\"odinger equation reveals\nnon-adiabatic tunnelling as the underlying physical mechanism, yielding a\ncurrent burst duration of 860 as. Despite working under ambient conditions but\nfree of thermal artifacts, we achieve sub-angstr\\\"om topographic sensitivity\nand a lateral spatial resolution of 2 nm. This unprecedented capability to\ndirectionally control attosecond bursts will enable triggering and imaging\nultrafast charge dynamics in atomic, molecular and condensed systems at the\nspatio-temporal microscopy frontier of lightwave electronics.",

    "abstract": "Existing asynchronous MARL methods based on MacDec-POMDP typically construct\ntraining trajectory buffers by simply sampling limited and biased data at the\nendpoints of macro-actions, and directly apply conventional MARL methods on the\nbuffers. As a result, these methods lead to an incomplete and inaccurate\nrepresentation of the macro-action execution process, along with unsuitable\ncredit assignments. To solve these problems, the Temporal Macro-action Value\nFactorization (ToMacVF) is proposed to achieve fine-grained temporal credit\nassignment for macro-action contributions. A centralized training buffer,\ncalled Macro-action Segmented Joint Experience Replay Trajectory (Mac-SJERT),\nis designed to incorporate with ToMacVF to collect accurate and complete\nmacro-action execution information, supporting a more comprehensive and precise\nrepresentation of the macro-action process. To ensure principled and\nfine-grained asynchronous value factorization, the consistency requirement\nbetween joint and individual macro-action selection called Temporal\nMacro-action based IGM (To-Mac-IGM) is formalized, proving that it generalizes\nthe synchronous cases. Based on To-Mac-IGM, a modularized ToMacVF architecture,\nwhich satisfies CTDE principle, is designed to conveniently integrate previous\nvalue factorization methods. Next, the ToMacVF algorithm is devised as an\nimplementation of the ToMacVF architecture. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat, compared to asynchronous baselines, our ToMacVF algorithm not only\nachieves optimal performance but also exhibits strong adaptability and\nrobustness across various asynchronous multi-agent experimental scenarios.",

For the herding system with\nheterogeneous groups involving herders and evaders, the behavior of the evaders\ncan only be influenced indirectly by the herders' motion, especially when the\nevaders follow an inverse dynamics model and respond solely to repulsive\ninteractions from the herders. This indirect interaction mechanism inherently\nrenders the overall system underactuated. To address this issue, we first\nconstruct separate CBFs for the dual objectives of goal reaching and collision\navoidance, which ensure both herding completion and safety guarantees. Then, we\nreformulate the underactuated herding dynamics into a control-affine structure\nand employ a backstepping approach to recursively design control inputs for the\nhierarchical barrier functions, avoiding taking derivatives of the higher-order\nsystem. Finally, we present a cooperative herding strategy based on\nbackstepping CBFs that allow herders to safely herd multiple evaders into the\ngoal region. In addition, centralized and decentralized implementations of the\nproposed algorithm are developed, further enhancing its flexibility and\napplicability. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments validate the\neffectiveness and safety of the proposed strategy in multi-robot herding.",

NGC300 is a well studied isolated, bulge-less, and low-mass disc galaxy\nideally suited for an investigation of galaxy evolution with radial gas\ninflows. To investigate the effects of radial gas inflows on the physical\nproperties of NGC300, a chemical evolution model for NGC300 is constructed by\nassuming its disc builds up progressively by infalling of metall-free gas and\noutflowing of metal-enriched gas. Radial gas inflows are also considered in the\nmodel. Our model including the radial gas inflows and an inside-out disc\nformation scenario can simultaneously reproduce the present-day observed radial\nprofiles of HI gas mass surface density, SFR surface density, sSFR, gas-phase\nand stellar metallicity. We find that, although the value of radial gas inflow\nvelocity is as low as -0.1 km/s, the radial gas inflows steepen the present-day\nradial profiles of HI gas mass surface density, SFR surface density, and\nmetallicity, but flatten the radial sSFR profile. Incorporating radial gas\ninflows significantly improves the agreement between our model predicted\npresent-day sSFR profile and the observations of NGC300.

While PI-ELMs outperform\nthe traditional Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) in speed due to their\nsingle-shot, least square optimization, this advantage comes at a cost: their\nfixed, randomly initialized input layer limits their ability to capture sharp\ngradients. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a lightweight Bayesian\nOptimization (BO) framework that, instead of adjusting each input layer\nparameter individually as in traditional backpropagation, learns a small set of\nhyperparameters defining the statistical distribution from which the input\nweights are drawn. This novel distributional optimization strategy -- combining\nBO for input layer distributional parameters with least-squares optimization\nfor output layer network parameters -- enables KAPI-ELM to preserve PI-ELM's\nspeed while matching or exceeding the expressiveness of PINNs. We validate the\nproposed methodology on several challenging forward and inverse PDE benchmarks,\nincluding a 1D singularly perturbed convection-diffusion equation, a 2D Poisson\nequation with sharp localized sources, and a time-dependent advection equation.\nNotably, KAPI-ELM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in both forward and\ninverse settings.

It has been shown that, in comparison to regular\nDNN training, training with stylized images reduces texture biases in image\nclassification and improves robustness with respect to image corruptions. In an\neffort to advance this line of research, we examine whether style transfer can\nlikewise deliver these two effects in semantic segmentation. To this end, we\nperform style transfer with style varying across artificial image areas. Those\nrandom areas are formed by a chosen number of Voronoi cells. The resulting\nstyle-transferred data is then used to train semantic segmentation DNNs with\nthe objective of reducing their dependence on texture cues while enhancing\ntheir reliance on shape-based features. In our experiments, it turns out that\nin semantic segmentation, style transfer augmentation reduces texture bias and\nstrongly increases robustness with respect to common image corruptions as well\nas adversarial attacks. These observations hold for convolutional neural\nnetworks and transformer architectures on the Cityscapes dataset as well as on\nPASCAL Context, showing the generality of the proposed method.",

To assess this, we introduce ITW-SM,\na new dataset of real and AI-generated images collected from major social media\nplatforms.

We perform 2.5-dimensional GRMHD\nsimulations using, as initial conditions, remapped massive star progenitors\npreviously evolved with a state-of-the-art stellar evolutionary codes.\nSpecifically, we adopt the Wolf-Rayet star models 12TH and 16TI from the\nWoosley \\& Heger framework, and we evolve our own Long GRB progenitor with the\nMESA code. A dipolar magnetic field is imposed, with variations in field\nstrength to explore its influence. We find that the jets are magnetically\ndominated, with their thermal and kinetic components remaining comparable\nduring propagation through the stellar envelope. The cocoon is thermally\ndominated in most cases. Jet launching is successful when the magnetic field\nhas a dipolar configuration and spin $a=0.9$, in contrast, a hybrid magnetic\nfield does not result in jet formation. We observe disk formation in cases\nwithout a magnetized jet, however, the formation of a well-defined funnel is\nnot evident and the expansion of such wind does not break the star for longer\ntimes. Our simulations show that a collapsar launches a successful,\nrelativistic jet only when a strong, large-scale dipolar field, driving a\nmagnetically arrested disk.

A\ncommon approach is based on inducing gliomas in animal models. This is followed\nby a dosage of 5-ALA to induce Protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) in the glioma and which\nfluoresces. Although these approaches excel in capturing key biomolecular and\nphysiological features of the tumour, they are inherently indeterministic. This\nlimits the scope of their use for preclinical device development, where\nconsistent and controllable tumour reproduction across multiple animals is\nneeded. Approaches using fluorescence markers in gelatine provide a simple\nreplication but fail to capture the complexities of in-vivo models.

The model was developed by injecting a PpIX solution\ninto the cortical region of a resected adult rat brain, the injection site\nsimulated a tumoral region with elevated PpIX concentration. The tumoral region\nhad a gradient of concentrations, with a peak at the centre and a decrease\ntowards the margins, akin to in-vivo gliomas. The fluorescence profile was\ncompared to in-vivo conditions using 5-ALA and correlated well with other\nreported works, achieving a correlation of R2>0.93. The model's validity was\ntested by examining the effect of the solvent, DMSO, on the Autofluorescence\n(AF) of the brain sample and the short-term effect of storage on AF was\nanalysed. Examinations confirmed the solvent did not alter AF, and the brain\nsample should be stored in Hanks Balanced Salt Solution and refrigerated to\nmaintain moisture and preserve AF.

    "abstract": "When the gravitons are created thanks to the variation of the space-time\ncurvature the multiplicity distributions quantify the probability of producing\na given number of species around the average occupation numbers of the\nunderlying multiparticle states. The multiplicities of the relic gravitons are\ninfinitely divisible and their analytical expressions encompass, in different\nregions of the physical parameters, the Poisson, Bose-Einstein, Gamma and\nPascal probability distributions. Depending upon the post-inflationary\ntimelines, the averaged multiplicities are controlled by the range of the\ncomoving frequencies and they can be much larger in the GHz region than in the\naHz domain where the temperature and polarization anisotropies of the microwave\nbackground set strict limits on the spectral energy density of the relic\ngravitons. Thanks to the absolute upper bound on the maximal frequency of the\ngravitons we can acknowledge that the averaged multiplicities are exponentially\nsuppressed above the THz, where only few pairs of gravitons are independently\ncreated from the vacuum. The statistical properties of the produced particles\ncan be finally interpreted in the light of the second-order interference\neffects and this perspective is quantitatively scrutinized by analyzing the\nassociated quantum sensitivities. For putative instruments reaching spectral\namplitudes ${\\mathcal O}(10^{-35})/\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Hz}}$ in the MHz or GHz bands,\nthe Bose-Einstein correlations could be used to probe the properties of cosmic\ngravitons and their super-Poissonian statistics. Both from the theoretical and\nobservational viewpoint it is unjustified to require the same sensitivities\n(e.g. ${\\mathcal O}(10^{-21})/\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Hz}}$) in the kHz and GHz domains.",

    "abstract": "Multimodal learning often encounters the under-optimized problem and may have\nworse performance than unimodal learning. Existing methods attribute this\nproblem to the imbalanced learning between modalities and rebalance them\nthrough gradient modulation. However, they fail to explain why the dominant\nmodality in multimodal models also underperforms that in unimodal learning. In\nthis work, we reveal the optimization conflict between the modality encoder and\nmodality fusion module in multimodal models. Specifically, we prove that the\ncross-modal fusion in multimodal models decreases the gradient passed back to\neach modality encoder compared with unimodal models. Consequently, the\nperformance of each modality in the multimodal model is inferior to that in the\nunimodal model. To this end, we propose a disentangled gradient learning (DGL)\nframework to decouple the optimization of the modality encoder and modality\nfusion module in the multimodal model. DGL truncates the gradient\nback-propagated from the multimodal loss to the modality encoder and replaces\nit with the gradient from unimodal loss. Besides, DGL removes the gradient\nback-propagated from the unimodal loss to the modality fusion module. This\nhelps eliminate the gradient interference between the modality encoder and\nmodality fusion module while ensuring their respective optimization processes.\nFinally, extensive experiments on multiple types of modalities, tasks, and\nframeworks with dense cross-modal interaction demonstrate the effectiveness and\nversatility of the proposed DGL.

While\nformal verification techniques have been extensively developed for classical\nmodels, no comparable framework exists for certifying the robustness of VQCs.\nHere, we present the first in-depth theoretical and practical study of the\nformal verification problem for VQCs. Inspired by abstract interpretation\nmethods used in deep learning, we analyze the applicability and limitations of\ninterval-based reachability techniques in the quantum setting. We show that\nquantum-specific aspects, such as state normalization, introduce inter-variable\ndependencies that challenge existing approaches. We investigate these issues by\nintroducing a novel semantic framework based on abstract interpretation, where\nthe verification problem for VQCs can be formally defined, and its complexity\nanalyzed. Finally, we demonstrate our approach on standard verification\nbenchmarks.",

    "abstract": "Proper coordination is needed to guarantee the performance of wireless\nnetworks in dense deployments. Contention-based systems suffer badly in terms\nof latency when multiple devices compete for the same resources. Coordinated\nOrthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (Co-OFDMA) is proposed for Wi-Fi\n8 to remedy this, as it enables multiple Access Points (APs) to share spectrum\nmore efficiently. However, fine-grained resource allocation, namely within\n20MHz bandwidth, is argued to be impractical due to the over-the-air scheduling\noverhead and complexity in terms of physical layer signaling. A wired backhaul\nmitigates the need for over-the-air scheduling and synchronization, and it\nallows for coordination even if APs are not in each others' range. Furthermore,\nit forms the basis for more advanced multi-AP coordination schemes like\ncoordinated beamforming and joint transmission. In this work we demonstrate the\nrealization of Wi-Fi 6 compliant fine-grained Co-OFDMA using a fiber backhaul,\nenabled by the open-source platforms openwifi and White Rabbit. We show that\nthe performance in terms of carrier frequency offset pre-compensation and time\nsynchronization between two APs exceeds related wireless standard requirements.\nFurthermore, the quality of the received constellation of the Co-OFDMA frame as\nreported by a wireless connectivity tester is better than individual frames\nsent by the APs.",

Emotional\nexpression and micro-expression research probe into understanding human\npsychological responses to emotional stimuli, thereby revealing substantial\nhidden yet authentic emotions that can be useful in the event of diagnosis and\ninterviews.

Our computational study uncovers some of the influences of\nethnic background in expression analysis, leading to an argument that the\nemotional universality hypothesis is an overgeneralization from the perspective\nof manual psychological analysis. In this research, we propose to investigate\nthe level of influence of ethnicity in a simulated micro-expression scenario.\nWe construct a cross-cultural micro-expression database and algorithmically\nannotate the ethnic labels to facilitate the investigation.

The complete REACT framework's efficacy is validated in a pipe\ninspection scenario, demonstrating safe, entanglement-free navigation and\nfull-coverage inspection. Simulation results show that REACT achieves complete\ncoverage while maintaining tether constraints and completing the total mission\n20% faster than conventional planners, despite a longer inspection time due to\nproactive avoidance of entanglement that eliminates extensive post-mission\ndisentanglement.

    "abstract": "Massive MIMO systems are moving toward increased numbers of radio frequency\nchains, higher carrier frequencies and larger bandwidths. As such,\ndigital-to-analog converters (DACs) are becoming a bottleneck in terms of\nhardware complexity and power consumption. In this work, non-linear precoding\nfor coarsely quantized downlink massive MIMO is studied. Given the NP-hard\nnature of this problem, a graph neural network (GNN) is proposed that directly\noutputs the precoded quantized vector based on the channel matrix and the\nintended transmit symbols. The model is trained in a self-supervised manner, by\ndirectly maximizing the achievable rate. To overcome the non-differentiability\nof the objective function, introduced due to the non-differentiable DAC\nfunctions, a straight-through Gumbel-softmax estimation of the gradient is\nproposed. The proposed method achieves a significant increase in achievable sum\nrate under coarse quantization. For instance, in the single-user case, the\nproposed method can achieve the same sum rate as maximum ratio transmission\n(MRT) by using one-bit DAC's as compared to 3 bits for MRT. This reduces the\nDAC's power consumption by a factor 4-7 and 3 for baseband and RF DACs\nrespectively. This, however, comes at the cost of increased digital signal\nprocessing power consumption. When accounting for this, the reduction in\noverall power consumption holds for a system bandwidth up to 3.5 MHz for\nbaseband DACs, while the RF DACs can maintain a power reduction of 2.9 for\nhigher bandwidths. Notably, indirect effects, which further reduce the power\nconsumption, such as a reduced fronthaul consumption and reduction in other\ncomponents, are not considered in this analysis.",

    "abstract": "Multimodal learning often encounters the under-optimized problem and may\nperform worse than unimodal learning. Existing approaches attribute this issue\nto imbalanced learning across modalities and tend to address it through\ngradient balancing. However, this paper argues that balanced learning is not\nthe optimal setting for multimodal learning. With bias-variance analysis, we\nprove that imbalanced dependency on each modality obeying the inverse ratio of\ntheir variances contributes to optimal performance. To this end, we propose the\nAsymmetric Representation Learning(ARL) strategy to assist multimodal learning\nvia imbalanced optimization. ARL introduces auxiliary regularizers for each\nmodality encoder to calculate their prediction variance. ARL then calculates\ncoefficients via the unimodal variance to re-weight the optimization of each\nmodality, forcing the modality dependence ratio to be inversely proportional to\nthe modality variance ratio. Moreover, to minimize the generalization error,\nARL further introduces the prediction bias of each modality and jointly\noptimizes them with multimodal loss. Notably, all auxiliary regularizers share\nparameters with the multimodal model and rely only on the modality\nrepresentation. Thus the proposed ARL strategy introduces no extra parameters\nand is independent of the structures and fusion methods of the multimodal\nmodel. Finally, extensive experiments on various datasets validate the\neffectiveness and versatility of ARL.

    "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable\ncapabilities in vision-language understanding, reasoning, and generation.\nHowever, they struggle with tasks requiring fine-grained localization and\nreasoning in high-resolution images. This constraint stems from the fact that\nMLLMs are fine-tuned with fixed image resolution to align with the pre-trained\nimage encoder used in MLLM. Consequently, feeding high-resolution images\ndirectly into MLLMs leads to poor generalization due to a train-test resolution\ndiscrepancy, while downsampling these images-although ensuring\nconsistency-compromises fine-grained visual details and ultimately degrades\nperformance. To address this challenge, we propose Extract Candidate then\nPredict (ECP), a novel training-free, task-agnostic two-stage framework\ndesigned to enhance MLLM performance on high-resolution images. The key\nintuition behind ECP is that while MLLMs struggle with high-resolution images,\ntheir predictions on downsampled images still contain implicit localization\ncues. By first identifying candidate region using the coarse prediction and\nthen predicting the final output based on candidate region, ECP effectively\npreserves fine-grained details while mitigating the challenges posed by\nhigh-resolution data.

First, we focus on analyzing the geodesics of\nparticles around the Buchdahl-inspired spacetime, together with the conserved\nquantities such as specific energy and angular momentum for massive particles\norbiting on the innermost stable circular orbits (ISCOs). We show that the\neffect of the Buchdahl parameter $\\tilde{k}$ increases as the radii of the ISCO\norbits decrease, resulting in shifting orbits toward the central object\ncompared to the Schwarzschild black hole case. We also consider astrophysical\nepicyclic oscillations and derive their general expressions using implications\nof circular motion of massive particles around the Buchdahl-inspired spacetime.\nFurther, we explore the astrophysical implications of observational\nhigher-frequency QPOs of the selected galactic microquasars of X-ray binary\nsystems to obtain the best-fit constraints on the Buchdahl-inspired spacetime\nparameters. Finally, we consider the accretion disk around the\nBuchdahl-inspired spacetime using implications of the ISCO parameters that\ndefine the accretion disk's inner edge. We explore radiation properties of the\naccretion disk and redshifted image and intensity of a lensed accretion disk\naround the Buchdahl-inspired spacetime.",

Small scale\nsurface magnetic fields and multipolar components are believed to be\nresponsible for this complexity due to the radiation mechanisms occurring close\nto the stellar surface but within the relatively small light-cylinder compared\nto the stellar radius. In this work, we use the latest NICER phase aligned\nthermal X-ray pulse profile of PSR~J0740+6620 combined with radio and\n$\\gamma$-ray pulse profiles and radio polarisation to deduce the best magnetic\nfield configuration that can simultaneously reproduce the light-curves in these\nrespective bands. We assume a polar cap model for the radio emission and use\nthe rotating vector model for the associated polarisation, a striped wind model\nfor the $\\gamma$-ray light-curves and rely on the NICER collaboration results\nfor the hot spot geometry. We demonstrate that an almost centred dipole can\naccount for the hot spot location with a magnetic obliquity of $\\alpha \\approx\n51 \\deg$ and a line of sight inclination angle of $\\zeta \\approx 82 \\deg$.\nHowever, with this geometry, the hot spot areas are three times too large. We\nfound a better solution consisting of two dipoles located just below the\nsurface in approximately antipodal positions. Our double dipole model is able\nto reproduce all the salient radio and $\\gamma$-ray characteristics of\nPSR~J0740+6620 including radio polarisation data. A double dipole solution is\nmore flexible than an off-centred dipole because of two independent magnetic\naxes and could hint at a magnetic field mostly concentrated within the crust\nand not in the core.",

In this work, we examine the minimization of functions of\nthe form f(w) + a ||w||_1, where w are the material model parameters, f is a\nmetric that quantifies the mismatch between the material model and the observed\ndata, and a is a regularization parameter that determines the sparsity of the\nsolution. We investigate both the straightforward case where f is quadratic and\nthe more complex scenario where it is non-quadratic or even non-convex.\nImportantly, we do not only focus on methods that solve the sparse regression\nproblem for a given value of the regularization parameter a, but propose\nmethods to efficiently compute the entire regularization path, facilitating the\nselection of a suitable a. Specifically, we present four algorithms and discuss\ntheir roles for automated material model discovery in mechanics: First, we\nrecapitulate a well-known coordinate descent algorithm that solves the\nminimization problem assuming that f is quadratic for a given value of a, also\nknown as the LASSO. Second, we discuss the algorithm LARS, which automatically\ndetermines the critical values of a, at which material parameters in w are set\nto zero. Third, we propose to use the proximal gradient method ISTA for\nautomated material model discovery if f is not quadratic, and fourth, we\nsuggest a pathwise extension of ISTA for computing the regularization path.

To bridge this gap, we introduce a unified\ntext-based person retrieval pipeline considering domain adaptation at both\nimage and region levels. In particular, it contains two primary components,\ni.e., Domain-aware Diffusion (DaD) for image-level adaptation and\nMulti-granularity Relation Alignment (MRA) for region-level adaptation. As the\nname implies, Domain-aware Diffusion is to migrate the distribution of images\nfrom the pretraining dataset domain to the target real-world dataset domain,\ne.g., CUHK-PEDES. Subsequently, MRA performs a meticulous region-level\nalignment by establishing correspondences between visual regions and their\ndescriptive sentences, thereby addressing disparities at a finer granularity.\nExtensive experiments show that our dual-level adaptation method has achieved\nstate-of-the-art results on the CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, and RSTPReid datasets,\noutperforming existing methodologies.

Comparisons between visual working memory and new perceptual input (e.g.,\nduring cognitive tasks) can lead to unintended memory distortions. Previous\nstudies have reported systematic memory distortions after perceptual\ncomparison, but understanding how perceptual comparison affects memory\ndistortions in real-world objects remains a challenge. Furthermore, identifying\nwhat visual features contribute to memory vulnerability presents a novel\nresearch question. Here, we propose a novel AI-driven framework that generates\nnaturalistic visual stimuli grounded in behaviorally relevant object dimensions\nto elicit similarity-induced memory biases. We use two types of stimuli --\nimage wheels created through dimension editing and dimension wheels generated\nby dimension activation values -- in three visual working memory (VWM)\nexperiments. These experiments assess memory distortions under three\nconditions: no perceptual comparison, perceptual comparison with image wheels,\nand perceptual comparison with dimension wheels. The results show that similar\ndimensions, like similar images, can also induce memory distortions.\nSpecifically, visual dimensions are more prone to distortion than semantic\ndimensions, indicating that the object dimensions of naturalistic visual\nstimuli play a significant role in the vulnerability of memory.",

In the high latitude regions, these\nconductances are enhanced by the auroral electron precipitation. The effect of\na broadband precipitating electron energy distribution, similar to the observed\nelectron distributions through particle measurements, on the conductance values\nis investigated. The new values are compared to the ones obtained from previous\nstudies, notably when considering a mono-energetic distribution. The broadband\nprecipitating electron energy distribution is modeled by a kappa distribution,\nwhich is used as an input in an electron transport model that computes the\ndensity vertical profiles of ionospheric ions. The vertical profiles of the\nPedersen and Hall conductivities are then evaluated assuming that the\nconductivities are mostly governed by the densities of H3+ and CH5+. Finally,\nthe Pedersen and Hall conductances are computed by integrating the\ncorresponding conductivities over altitude. The Pedersen and Hall conductances\nare globally higher when considering a broadband electron energy distribution\nrather than a mono-energetic distribution. In addition, the use of the direct\noutputs of an electron transport model rather than the analytical expression\npresented in Hiraki and Tao (2008) as well as a change in the electron\ncollision cross-sections also have significant impacts on the conductance\nvalues.

One of our commissioning goals\nwas to perform simultaneous dual-band VLBI observations at 86 and 258 GHz using\nreceivers with shared-optical-paths (SOP) to correct the atmospheric phase\nfluctuations using the frequency phase transfer (FPT) technique. This was\npossible together with the IRAM 30 m telescope, which has already developed\nsuch a capability. We aimed to verify the expected phase coherence and\nsensitivity improvement at the higher frequency achievable by applying FPT.\nWith the dual-band, single baseline data, we applied the FPT method, which uses\nthe lower frequency data to correct the simultaneously observed\nhigher-frequency data. We evaluate the improvement compared to the conventional\nsingle-band observing mode by analyzing the coherence factor in the higher\nfrequency data. Our results show that the phase fluctuations at the two bands\nare well correlated. After applying FPT, the interferometric phases at the\nhigher frequency vary much slower and the coherence factor is significantly\nimproved.

In this paper, we introduce an algorithm that\nconstructs QC spatially-coupled (SC) LDPC codes with large girth while keeping\nthe constraint length small. The algorithm offers a \"protograph to basegraph\"\nconstruction, focusing on finding small lifting sizes of QC codes while\navoiding short cycles. This work extends the hierarchical quasi-cyclic (HQC)\nconstruction for block LDPC codes proposed by Wang et al. to the spatially\ncoupled case. The construction is based on the cycle relevant matrix (CRM)\nderived from the periodic structure of time-invariant SC-LDPC codes.

FMCW radar utilizes a\ncontinuous chirp, while IR-UWB radar employs short pulses.

To address this challenge, we analyze the\nperformance characteristics of transformer and post-transformer LLMs. Despite\ntheir algorithmic differences, both are fundamentally limited by memory\nbandwidth under batched inference due to attention in transformers and state\nupdates in post-transformers.

At the heart of their success lies the concept of\nTN ranks, which governs the efficiency and expressivity of TN decompositions.\nHowever, unlike matrix ranks, TN ranks often lack a universal meaning and an\nintuitive interpretation, with their properties varying significantly across\ndifferent TN structures. Consequently, TN ranks are frequently treated as\nempirically tuned hyperparameters, rather than as key design parameters\ninferred from domain knowledge. The aim of this Lecture Note is therefore to\ndemystify the foundational yet frequently misunderstood concept of TN ranks\nthrough real-life examples and intuitive visualizations. We begin by\nillustrating how domain knowledge can guide the selection of TN ranks in\nwidely-used models such as the Canonical Polyadic (CP) and Tucker\ndecompositions. For more complex TN structures, we employ a self-explanatory\ngraphical approach that generalizes to tensors of arbitrary order. Such a\nperspective naturally reveals the relationship between TN ranks and the\ncorresponding ranks of tensor unfoldings (matrices), thereby circumventing\ncumbersome multi-index tensor algebra while facilitating domain-informed TN\ndesign. It is our hope that this Lecture Note will equip readers with a clear\nand unified understanding of the concept of TN rank, along with the necessary\nphysical insight and intuition to support the selection, explainability, and\ndeployment of tensor methods in both practical applications and educational\ncontexts.",

    "abstract": "Gravitational-wave (GW) detection offers a novel approach to exploring\nintermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). The GW signals from IMBH mergers mainly\nfall in the decihertz frequency band. The lunar-based GW detector, the Lunar\nGravitational-Wave Antenna (LGWA), exhibits high sensitivity in this band,\nmaking it particularly well-suited for detecting IMBHs. However, for lower-mass\nIMBHs, the late inspiral and merger signals enter the sensitive frequency range\nof ground-based GW detectors. In this work, we aim to explore how multi-band\nobservations with LGWA and the third-generation ground-based GW detector, the\nEinstein Telescope (ET), can contribute to detecting the population of IMBHs.\nWe consider three population distribution cases of IMBHs, including two\npopulation models based on astrophysical motivations and a uniform\ndistribution, and compute the signal-to-noise ratios for LGWA, ET, and their\ncombination to directly compare their capabilities in detecting IMBH mergers.\nOur results suggest that LGWA possesses strong detection capability for\nhigh-mass IMBH mergers. At redshift $z = 1$, LGWA's detection rate for IMBH\nbinaries with primary masses above $5 \\times 10^4~M_\\odot$ is largely\ninsensitive to orbital inclination and mass ratio. In contrast, ET is more\nsuited for detecting IMBH binaries with primary masses below $10^3~M_\\odot$.\nThe multi-band observation of LGWA and ET possesses strong detection\ncapabilities across the full IMBH mass spectrum. Furthermore, we find that the\nmulti-band detection can significantly and effectively recover the IMBH\npopulation distributions. In summary, we conclude that the multi-band\nobservations of LGWA and ET will provide powerful detection capabilities for\nIMBHs and are expected to significantly enhance our understanding of this\nimportant yet still poorly observed class of black holes.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge Distillation (KD) in general and feature distillation in particular\nare promising techniques for reducing the high computational demand of large\nlanguage models (LLMs). However, traditional feature KD methods typically\nassume that the teacher and the student share the same hidden size, limiting\nthe flexibility of the student's architecture. A common solution to this\nproblem involves training a linear projector to align their feature spaces, but\nthis introduces additional parameters that must be learned from scratch and\noften degrades performance on downstream tasks, especially in generative\nsettings. To address this issue, in this work, we propose a novel task-based\nfeature distillation method that enables knowledge transfer between teacher and\nstudent models with different hidden layer dimensions, without introducing any\nnew parameters. Leveraging the insight that only a subset of LLM components\ncontribute significantly to a specific downstream task, our approach identifies\nthe most task-relevant hidden units in the teacher and directly distills their\nactivations to the student. Our method is flexible and easily integrates with\nother distillation frameworks. Empirical results show consistent improvements\nover prior approaches across diverse tasks, including classification,\ninstruction-following, and summarization, achieving up to a 3\\% performance\ngain over the linear projection baseline.",

Therefore, efficient use of input\nmaterials is an essential aspect affecting the profit of such companies. This\npaper addresses an optimization problem concerning the purchase and subsequent\nmaterial processing we solved for a meat processing company. Unlike the\nmajority of existing papers, we do not concentrate on how this problem concerns\nsupply chain management, but we focus purely on the production stage. The\nproblem involves the concept of alternative ways of material processing, stock\nof material with different expiration dates, and extra constraints widely\nneglected in the current literature, namely, the minimum order quantity and the\nminimum percentage in alternatives. We prove that each of these two constraints\nmakes the problem \\mbox{$\\mathcal{NP}$-hard}, and hence we design a simple\niterative approach based on integer linear programming that allows us to solve\nreal-life instances even using an open-source integer linear programming\nsolver. Another advantage of this approach is that it mitigates numerical\nissues, caused by the extensive range of data values, we experienced with a\ncommercial solver.

This is due to the wide\nrange of applications in multidisciplinary research fields, including nonlinear\nXUV optics and ultrafast science. Nowadays, intense laser-atom interactions are\none of the primary sources of high-order harmonic generation, emitting\nradiation in the extreme ultraviolet (XUV) range. Although the scaling laws for\nXUV photon numbers have been extensively studied in the past, their dependence\non the duration of the driving laser pulse has remained largely unexplored\nexperimentally. This is because, in each of these studies, the XUV photon yield\nwas optimized according to the specific characteristics of the lasers used and\nthe corresponding XUV beamlines. In other words, there have been no systematic\nmeasurements on the dependence of XUV yield on the duration of the driving\nlaser pulse. Here, by taking advantage of the SYLOS laser system at ELI ALPS,\nwe are able to experimentally investigate this long-standing question. We found\nthat for driving laser field intensities below the saturation threshold of\nharmonic generation, the harmonic yield depends linearly on the pulse duration.\nHowever, for laser intensities near to the harmonic yield saturation, the\nharmonic yield is inversely proportional to the pulse duration.",

The effectiveness of continuous batching relies\non an accurate estimate of the memory requirements of requests. However, due to\nthe diversity in request output lengths, existing frameworks tend to adopt\naggressive or conservative schedulers, which often result in significant\noverestimation or underestimation of memory consumption. Consequently, they\nsuffer from harmful request evictions or prolonged queuing times, failing to\nachieve satisfactory throughput under strict Service Level Agreement (SLA)\nguarantees (a.k.a. goodput), across various LLM application scenarios with\ndiffering input-output length distributions.

It adapts to applications with all types of input-output\nlength distributions, balancing the trade-off between request queuing and\nharmful evictions, thereby consistently achieving better goodput. Furthermore,\nto validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheduler, we developed a\nhigh-performance LLM serving framework, LightLLM, that implements the\nPast-Future scheduler.

Our findings suggest that, on average, students in\nthe flipped cohort implemented the instructional approach insufficiently,\nexplaining the mechanism of our null results in exam performance and knowledge\nretention. This highlights the need for additional strategies to ensure that\nstudents actually benefit from a flipped curriculum.",

    "abstract": "Learning and constructing large-scale graphs has attracted attention in\nrecent decades, resulting in a rich literature that introduced various systems,\ntools, and algorithms. Grale is one of such tools that is designed for offline\nenvironments and is deployed in more than 50 different industrial settings at\nGoogle. Grale is widely applicable because of its ability to efficiently learn\nand construct a graph on datasets with multiple types of features. However, it\nis often the case that applications require the underlying data to evolve\ncontinuously and rapidly and the updated graph needs to be available with low\nlatency. Such setting make the use of Grale prohibitive. While there are\nApproximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) systems that handle dynamic updates with low\nlatency, they are mostly limited to similarities over a single embedding.\n  In this work, we introduce a system that inherits the advantages and the\nquality of Grale, and maintains a graph construction in a dynamic setting with\ntens of milliseconds of latency per request. We call the system Dynamic Grale\nUsing ScaNN (Dynamic GUS). Our system has a wide range of applications with\nover 10 deployments at Google. One of the applications is in Android Security\nand Privacy, where Dynamic Grale Using ScaNN enables capturing harmful\napplications 4 times faster, before they can reach users.",

However,\nthere is a lack of research in carousels, particularly examining how\nrecommender systems may be designed differently than the traditional\nsingle-list interfaces. One of the key elements for understanding how to design\na system for a particular interface is understanding how users browse. For\ncarousels, users may browse in a number of different ways due to the added\ncomplexity of multiple topic defined-lists and swiping to see more items.\n  Eye tracking is the key to understanding user behavior by providing valuable,\ndirect information on how users see and navigate. In this work, we provide the\nfirst extensive analysis of the eye tracking behavior in carousel recommenders\nunder the free-browsing setting. To understand how users browse, we examine the\nfollowing research questions : 1) where do users start browsing, 2) how do\nusers transition from item to item within the same carousel and across\ncarousels, and 3) how does genre preference impact transitions?\n  This work addresses a gap in the field and provides the first extensive\nempirical results of eye tracked browsing behavior in carousels for improving\nrecommenders. Taking into account the insights learned from the above\nquestions, our final contribution is to provide suggestions to help carousel\nrecommender system designers optimize their systems for user browsing behavior.\nThe most important suggestion being to reorder the ranked item positions to\naccount for browsing after swiping.These contributions aim not only to help\nimprove current systems, but also to encourage and allow the design of new user\nmodels, systems, and metrics that are better suited to the complexity of\ncarousel interfaces.",

While\ntraditional methods like block matching or optical flow struggle with intricate\ncardiac motion, modern point tracking approaches remain largely underexplored\nin this domain. This work investigates the potential of state-of-the-art (SOTA)\npoint tracking methods for ultrasound, with a focus on echocardiography.\nAlthough these novel approaches demonstrate strong performance in general\nvideos, their effectiveness and generalizability in echocardiography remain\nlimited. By analyzing cardiac motion throughout the heart cycle in real B-mode\nultrasound videos, we identify that a directional motion bias across different\nviews is affecting the existing training strategies. To mitigate this, we\nrefine the training procedure and incorporate a set of tailored augmentations\nto reduce the bias and enhance tracking robustness and generalization through\nimpartial cardiac motion. We also propose a lightweight network leveraging\nmulti-scale cost volumes from spatial context alone to challenge the advanced\nspatiotemporal point tracking models. Experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning\nwith our strategies significantly improves models' performances over their\nbaselines, even for out-of-distribution (OOD) cases. For instance, EchoTracker\nboosts overall position accuracy by 60.7% and reduces median trajectory error\nby 61.5% across heart cycle phases. Interestingly, several point tracking\nmodels fail to outperform our proposed simple model in terms of tracking\naccuracy and generalization, reflecting their limitations when applied to\nechocardiography.

After this paper was\nwritten, we became aware that the same result was achieved earlier by Kumar and\nSwamy.\n  The $k$-Edge-Connected Spanning Multi-subgraph ($k$-ECSM) problem is almost\nthe same as $k$-ECSS, except that any edge can be selected multiple times at\nthe same cost. The previous best approximation ratio for $k$-ECSM was $1+4/k$.\nOur result improves this to $1+\\frac{2}{k}$ for $k$ even and to $1+\\frac{3}{k}$\nfor $k$ odd, where for $k$ odd the computed subgraph is in fact\n$(k+1)$-edge-connected.",

    ],
    "abstract": "Identifying bias in LLMs is ongoing. Because they are still in development,\nwhat is true today may be false tomorrow. We therefore need general strategies\nfor debiasing that will outlive current models. Strategies developed for\ndebiasing human decision making offer one promising approach as they\nincorporate an LLM-style prompt intervention designed to bring latent knowledge\ninto awareness during decision making. LLMs trained on vast amounts of\ninformation contain information about potential biases, counter-arguments, and\ncontradictory evidence, but that information may only be brought to bear if\nprompted. Metacognitive prompts developed in the human decision making\nliterature are designed to achieve this, and as I demonstrate here, they show\npromise with LLMs. The prompt I focus on here is \"could you be wrong?\"\nFollowing an LLM response, this prompt leads LLMs to produce additional\ninformation, including why they answered as they did, errors, biases,\ncontradictory evidence, and alternatives, none of which were apparent in their\ninitial response. Indeed, this metaknowledge often reveals that how LLMs and\nusers interpret prompts are not aligned. Here I demonstrate this prompt using a\nset of questions taken from recent articles about LLM biases, including\nimplicit discriminatory biases and failures of metacognition. \"Could you be\nwrong\" prompts the LLM to identify its own biases and produce cogent\nmetacognitive reflection. I also present another example involving convincing\nbut incomplete information, which is readily corrected by the metacognitive\nprompt. In sum, this work argues that human psychology offers a new avenue for\nprompt engineering, leveraging a long history of effective prompt-based\nimprovements to human decision making.",

The\noptimal battery placement is not well understood by the existing literature,\nespecially regarding the influence of network topology on minimizing generation\ncosts. Our work starts with decomposing the Mixed-Integer Linear Programming\n(MILP) problem into a series of Linear Programming (LP) formulations. For power\ngrids with sufficiently large generation capacity or tree topologies, we derive\nanalytical cost expressions demonstrating that, under reasonable assumptions,\nthe weighted degree is the only topological factor for optimal battery\nplacement. We also discuss the minor impact of higher-order topological\nconditions on tree-topology networks. To find the localized nature of a single\nbattery's impact, we establish that the relative cost-saving benefit of a\nsingle battery decreases as the network scales. Furthermore, we design a\nlow-complexity algorithm for weakly-cyclic networks. Numerical experiments show\nthat our algorithm is not only approximately 100 times faster than commercial\nsolvers but also maintains high accuracy even when some theoretical assumptions\nare relaxed.",

Using the lambda algebra and the\ninvariant-theoretic formula of P.H. Chon and L.M. Ha [5], we formulate the\npreimage search as a solvable problem in linear algebra. This framework is\napplied to study key indecomposable elements in the Adams spectral sequence. As\na consequence, we show that the proof of the known result that the\nindecomposable element $d_0 \\in \\mathrm{Ext}^{4,18}_{\\mathcal A}(\\mathbb Z/2,\n\\mathbb Z/2).$ lies in the image of the fourth Singer transfer, as given by\nNguyen Sum in [17], is false. Furthermore, we provide the explicit description\nof a preimage for the indecomposable element $p_0 \\in\n\\mathrm{Ext}^{4,37}_{\\mathcal A}(\\mathbb Z/2, \\mathbb Z/2).$ This preimage had\nnot been explicitly determined in the previous work of N.H.V.

Methodologically, we\ncombine the recently proposed cavity reaction potential (CRP) approach with the\nLagrangian formulation of CC theory and derive a self-consistent CRP-CC method\nat the singles and doubles excitations level (CRP-CCSD). The CRP-CC approach is\nformally similar to implicit solvation CC models and provides access to the\nCBO-CC electronic ground state energy minimized in cavity coordinate space on a\nCC level of theory. A hierarchy of linearisation schemes (lCRP-CCSD) similar to\ncanonical CC theory systematically lifts the self-consistent nature of the\nCRP-CCSD approach and mitigates numerical cost by approximating electron\ncorrelation effects in energy minimization. We provide a thorough comparison of\nCRP-CCSD, lCRP-CCSD and CRP-Hartee-Fock methods for a cavity-modified\nMenshutkin reaction, pyridine$+$CH$_3$Br, and cavity-induced collective\nelectronic effects in microsolvation energies of selected methanol-water\nclusters.

Existing LLM-based approaches transfer knowledge\nlearned from text data to time series prediction using prompting or fine-tuning\nstrategies.

Traditional generative\nmodels based on cloud computing are difficult to meet the real-time\nrequirements of AIGC tasks in IIoT environments, and edge computing can\neffectively reduce latency through task offloading.

We present this framework alongside validation tests on synthetic\ndata and demonstrate its application to three well-studied observed binaries,\nincluding one system known for its pronounced mass discrepancy. The framework\nrecovers multiple viable solutions from distinct local minima, including one\nthat reduces the mass discrepancy. These results illustrate how methodological\nbiases, rather than evolutionary model assumptions, can contribute to the mass\ndiscrepancy problem. We further highlight that external constraints, such as\nindependent distance estimates or evolutionary models, may be necessary to\ndistinguish between degenerate solutions. Expanding this analysis to a larger\nsample will provide a more complete understanding, with forthcoming results in\nthe next paper in this series.",

However, limited by the input length of the text encoder,\nCLIP struggles on under-stream tasks with long-text inputs ($>77$ tokens). To\nremedy this issue, we propose FIX-CLIP, which includes three novel modules: (1)\nA dual-branch training pipeline that aligns short and long texts with masked\nand raw images, respectively, which boosts the long-text representation while\npreserving the short-text ability. (2) Multiple learnable regional prompts with\nunidirectional masks in Transformer layers for regional information extraction.\n(3) A hierarchical feature alignment module in the intermediate encoder layers\nto promote the consistency of multi-scale features. Furthermore, we collect 30M\nimages and utilize existing MLLMs to synthesize long-text captions for\ntraining. Extensive experiments show that FIX-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance on both long-text and short-text retrieval benchmarks.

EEG analysis focused on frequency bands\n(Theta, Gamma, Delta) and machine-learning-derived features (A0, ST4, VC9, T2).\nA double dissociation emerged: Theta and VC9 increased under cognitive load but\nnot startle, supporting their sensitivity to executive function. In contrast,\nGamma and A0 were elevated by the startle stimulus, consistent with stress\nreactivity. ST4 tracked cognitive effort and worry, while T2 negatively\ncorrelated with self-reported calmness, indicating relevance to emotional\nregulation.

In this\nwork, we investigate applying ReFT to complex reasoning tasks. However,\ndirectly using the native ReFT method, which modifies fixed representations at\nthe beginning and end of each layer, yields suboptimal performance, as these\nfixed-position representations have uncertain impact on the outputs. We observe\nthat, in complex reasoning tasks, there often exist certain critical\nrepresentations.

    "abstract": "The role of magnetic fields in the formation of dense filamentary structures\nin molecular clouds is critical for understanding the star formation process.\nThe Snake filament in or close to the Pipe Nebula s neighboring, a prominent\nexample of such structures, offers an ideal environment to study the interplay\nbetween magnetic fields and gas dynamics in the early stages of star formation.\nThis study aims to investigate how magnetic fields influence the structure and\ndynamics of the Snake filament, using both polarization data and molecular line\nobservations. Our goal is to understand the role of magnetic fields in shaping\nthe filamentary structure and explore the kinematics within the filament. We\nconducted polarization observations in the optical and near-infrared bands\nusing the 1.6 m and 60 cm telescopes at the Observatorio do Pico dos\nDias/Laboratorio Nacional de Astrof\\isica (OPD/LNA). Molecular line\nobservations of the C18O and 13CO lines were obtained using the IRAM 30m\ntelescope. We analyzed the data to characterize polarization and gas properties\nwithin the filament, with a focus on understanding the magnetic field\norientation and its relationship with the filament s structure. Our findings\nreveal that the polarization vectors align with the filament s spine,\nindicating a magnetic field structure that is predominantly parallel to the\nfilament at lower-density regions. A velocity gradient along the filament is\nobserved in both C18O and 13CO lines, with C18O tracing the denser regions of\nthe gas. The polarization efficiency decreases with increasing visual\nextinction, consistent with reduced grain alignment in higher-density regions.\nThe filament s mass-to-length ratio is below the critical value required for\ngravitational collapse, indicating stability.",

While post-training safety alignment methods have been widely\nadopted, LLMs remain vulnerable to malicious instructions that can bypass\nsafety constraints. Recent efforts have introduced inference-time safety\nreasoning (system-2 alignment), where LLMs conduct a reasoning process to\nperform safety verification before final response. We show, however, that these\nchecks are driven by ad-hoc reasoning that diverges from the structured human\nprocess, where they first discern a user's true intent, then evaluate the\nassociated risk based on the true intent. Consequently, these defenses remain\nvulnerable to sophisticated jailbreak prompts that cloak harmful goals in\nseemingly benign language. To build secure and safe LLMs, we propose a\nreasoning-based safety alignment framework, ARMOR, that replaces the ad-hoc\nchains of thought reasoning process with human-aligned, structured one. At\ninference, ARMOR (1) detects likely jailbreak strategies, (2) extracts the\nuser's core intent while discarding deceptive instructions, and (3) applies a\npolicy-grounded safety analysis to the purified request. ARMOR is evaluated on\nadaptive jailbreak attacks and multiple safety benchmarks, and a test-time\nscaling is conducted to further improve its performance. Results demonstrate\nthat ARMOR significantly enhances the robustness against state-of-the-art\nadaptive jailbreak attacks and outperforms recent reasoning-based aligned\nmodels across various safety benchmarks.",

To address this gap, this study\nproposes a trust-aware game-theoretic lane-changing decision (TGLD) framework.\nFirst, we formulate a multi-vehicle coalition game, incorporating fully\ncooperative interactions among AVs and partially cooperative behaviors from HVs\ninformed by real-time trust evaluations.

Lastly, social compatibility objectives are considered\nby minimizing disruption to surrounding vehicles and enhancing the\npredictability of AV behaviors, thereby ensuring human-friendly and\ncontext-adaptive lane-changing strategies. A human-in-the-loop experiment\nconducted in a highway on-ramp merging scenario validates our TGLD approach.\nResults show that AVs can effectively adjust strategies according to different\nHVs' trust levels and driving styles.

Our core\ninsight lies in the synchronized orchestration of I/O and computation through\nthree key innovations: 1) Dependency-Relaxed asynchronous pipeline: FlashANNS\ndecouples I/O-computation dependencies to fully overlap between GPU distance\ncalculations and SSD data transfers. 2) Warp-Level concurrent SSD access:\nFlashANNS implements a lock-free I/O stack with warp-level concurrency control,\nto reduce the latency-induced time overhead. 3) Computation-I/O balanced graph\ndegree Selection: FlashANNS selects graph degrees via lightweight\ncompute-to-I/O ratio sampling, ensuring optimal balance between computational\nload and storage access latency across different I/O bandwidth configurations.\nWe implement FlashANNS and compare it with state-of-the-art out-of-core ANNS\nsystems (SPANN, DiskANN) and a GPU-accelerated out-of-core ANNS system\n(FusionANNS). Experimental results demonstrate that at $\\geq$95\\% recall@10\naccuracy, our method achieves 2.3-5.9$\\times$ higher throughput compared to\nexisting SOTA methods with a single SSD, and further attains 2.7-12.2$\\times$\nthroughput improvement in multi-SSD configurations.",

Therefore, efficiently serving MLLMs remains a major challenge.\nCurrent tightly coupled serving architectures struggle to distinguish between\nmixed request types or adapt parallelism strategies to different inference\nstages, leading to increased time-to-first-token (TTFT) latency and poor\nresource utilization. To address this, we introduce Elastic Multimodal\nParallelism (EMP), a new serving paradigm that elastically adapts to resource\nheterogeneity across request types and inference stages. Building upon EMP, we\ndevelop ElasticMM, an MLLM serving system that (1) separates requests into\nindependent modality groups with dynamic resource allocation via a\nmodality-aware load balancer; (2) decouples inference stages and enables\nparallelism adjustment and adaptive scaling via elastic partition scheduling;\nand (3) improves inference efficiency through unified multimodal prefix caching\nand non-blocking encoding. Experiments on diverse real-world datasets show that\nElasticMM outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) serving systems, reducing TTFT by\nup to 4.2x and achieving 3.2-4.5x higher throughput while meeting service-level\nobjectives (SLOs).",

An effective spatial\nresolution of 1 mm was achieved at a planar field measurement speed of 200 Hz\nand a volumetric field measurement speed of 2 Hz, with further improvements in\nspeed anticipated by another order of magnitude.

Motion of particles within optical\ntweezer traps established itself as a probe for local viscosity, temperature as\nwell as external fields. However, complex motions of trapped particles such as\nhopping or orbiting conventionally relies on intricate structure of the optical\ntrap, which creates limitations to their applicability, in particular in\nchallenging environments such as living matter. Here we demonstrate\nexperimentally polarization-dependent hopping and orbiting of particles in an\noptical trap formed by a single Gaussian beam. This novel effect is observed\nfor subwavelength particles with sizes above approximately $\\lambda/3$, where\n$\\lambda$ is the wavelength of the trapping beam. Our theoretical analysis\nreveals that the hopping and orbiting arises via the excitation of {\\it\nhigher-order Mie resonances}. While smaller particles experiencing dipolar\noptical forces remain trapped at the beam center, larger particles experience\nquadrupole optical forces exhibiting more complex behavior. Under linearly\npolarized illumination, larger particles show {\\it bistable dynamics} hopping\nbetween two stable positions. Under circularly polarized illumination, trapped\nparticles orbit around the beam center, revealing a light-induced\nspin-to-orbital angular momentum transfer.

We propose a dual experimental design: (1)\nDynamic Prompting, which systematically varies vulnerability type, user\npersona, and prompt phrasing across structured templates; and (2) Reverse\nPrompting, which derives natural-language prompts from real vulnerable code\nsamples. We evaluate three open-source 7B-parameter models (Qwen2, Mistral,\nGemma) using static analysis to assess both the presence and correctness of\ngenerated vulnerabilities. Our results show that all models frequently generate\nthe requested vulnerabilities, though with significant performance differences.\nGemma achieves the highest correctness for memory vulnerabilities under Dynamic\nPrompting (e.g., 98.6% for buffer overflows), while Qwen2 demonstrates the most\nbalanced performance across all tasks. We find that professional personas\n(e.g., \"DevOps Engineer\") consistently elicit higher success rates than student\npersonas, and that the effectiveness of direct versus indirect phrasing is\ninverted depending on the prompting strategy. Vulnerability reproduction\naccuracy follows a non-linear pattern with code complexity, peaking in a\nmoderate range.

    "abstract": "Foundation models have achieved remarkable success in natural language\nprocessing and computer vision, demonstrating strong capabilities in modeling\ncomplex patterns. While recent efforts have explored adapting large language\nmodels (LLMs) for time-series forecasting, LLMs primarily capture\none-dimensional sequential dependencies and struggle to model the richer\nspatio-temporal (ST) correlations essential for accurate ST forecasting. In\nthis paper, we present \\textbf{ST-VFM}, a novel framework that systematically\nreprograms Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) for general-purpose spatio-temporal\nforecasting. While VFMs offer powerful spatial priors, two key challenges arise\nwhen applying them to ST tasks: (1) the lack of inherent temporal modeling\ncapacity and (2) the modality gap between visual and ST data. To address these,\nST-VFM adopts a \\emph{dual-branch architecture} that integrates raw ST inputs\nwith auxiliary ST flow inputs, where the flow encodes lightweight temporal\ndifference signals interpretable as dynamic spatial cues. To effectively\nprocess these dual-branch inputs, ST-VFM introduces two dedicated reprogramming\nstages. The \\emph{pre-VFM reprogramming} stage applies a Temporal-Aware Token\nAdapter to embed temporal context and align both branches into VFM-compatible\nfeature spaces. The \\emph{post-VFM reprogramming} stage introduces a Bilateral\nCross-Prompt Coordination module, enabling dynamic interaction between branches\nthrough prompt-based conditioning, thus enriching joint representation learning\nwithout modifying the frozen VFM backbone. Extensive experiments on ten\nspatio-temporal datasets show that ST-VFM outperforms state-of-the-art\nbaselines, demonstrating effectiveness and robustness across VFM backbones\n(e.g., DINO, CLIP, DEIT) and ablation studies, establishing it as a strong\ngeneral framework for spatio-temporal forecasting.",

    "abstract": "Investment herding, a phenomenon where households mimic the decisions of\nothers rather than relying on their own analysis, has significant effects on\nfinancial markets and household behavior. Excessive investment herding may\nreduce investments and lead to a depletion of household consumption, which is\ncalled the crowding-out effect. While existing research has qualitatively\nexamined the impact of investment herding on consumption, quantitative studies\nin this area remain limited. In this work, we investigate the optimal\ninvestment and consumption decisions of households under the impact of\ninvestment herding. We formulate an optimization problem to model how\ninvestment herding influences household decisions over time. Based on the\noptimal control theory, we solve for the analytical solutions of optimal\ninvestment and consumption decisions. We theoretically analyze the impact of\ninvestment herding on household consumption decisions and demonstrate the\nexistence of the crowding-out effect. We further explore how parameters, such\nas interest rate, excess return rate, and volatility, influence the\ncrowding-out effect. Finally, we conduct a real data test to validate our\ntheoretical analysis of the crowding-out effect. This study is crucial to\nunderstanding the impact of investment herding on household consumption and\noffering valuable insights for policymakers seeking to stimulate consumption\nand mitigate the negative effects of investment herding on economic growth.",

We improve the extended\nlinear sigma model with baryons, proposed in our previous work, by introducing\nthe flavor structures constructed from antisymmetric tensors of chiral\nrepresentations to study these physics. The parameter space of this model is\nrefined with well-reproduced nuclear matter properties at saturation density by\nthe lowest order Lagrangian, ensuring consistency with vacuum results, such as\n$f_\\pi \\approx 134 \\, \\text{MeV}$. The anticipated plateau-like behaviors of\nthe symmetry energy are predicted at intermediate densities, which is crucial\nfor the consistency of GW170817 and the neutron skin thickness of\n$\\text{Pb}^{208}$. Subsequently, neutron star structures are calculated using\nseveral parameter sets, and the results for the nuclear matter properties at\nsaturation density align with empirical values. It is found that the neutron\nstar structures are sensitive to the couplings between the iso-vector $a_0$\nmeson and nucleons and the four-vector meson couplings: small values of both\nare favorable. Meanwhile, nuclear matter properties at saturation density favor\nlarger values of the latter and are not sensitive to the former. This signifies\nthe statistical significance of neutron star observations when obtaining\nrealistic chiral effective field theories or models at various densities. The\nparameter set favored by neutron star observations also aligns the behavior of\nthe sound velocity with the conformal limit at high densities relevant to cores\nof massive stars.

It accurately reproduces the known SHARK stellar masses\nwith respective root-mean-square and median errors of only 0.085 and 0.1 dex\nover the three decades in stellar mass. Analysis of the trained network's\nparameters reveals several colour indices to be particularly effective\npredictors of stellar mass. In particular, the FUV - NUV colour emerges as a\nstrong determinant, suggesting that the network has implicitly learned to\naccount for attenuation effects in the ultraviolet bands, thereby increasing\nthe diagnostic power of this index. Traditional methods such as spectral energy\ndistribution fitting, though widely used, are often complex, computationally\nexpensive, and sensitive to model assumptions and parameter degeneracies. In\ncontrast, the neural network relies solely on easily obtained observables,\nenabling rapid and accurate stellar mass predictions at minimal computational\ncost.

    "abstract": "API calls by large language models (LLMs) offer a cutting-edge approach for\ndata analysis. However, their ability to effectively utilize tools via API\ncalls remains underexplored in knowledge-intensive domains like meteorology.\nThis paper introduces KG2data, a system that integrates knowledge graphs, LLMs,\nReAct agents, and tool-use technologies to enable intelligent data acquisition\nand query handling in the meteorological field. Using a virtual API, we\nevaluate API call accuracy across three metrics: name recognition failure,\nhallucination failure, and call correctness. KG2data achieves superior\nperformance (1.43%, 0%, 88.57%) compared to RAG2data (16%, 10%, 72.14%) and\nchat2data (7.14%, 8.57%, 71.43%). KG2data differs from typical LLM-based\nsystems by addressing their limited access to domain-specific knowledge, which\nhampers performance on complex or terminology-rich queries. By using a\nknowledge graph as persistent memory, our system enhances content retrieval,\ncomplex query handling, domain-specific reasoning, semantic relationship\nresolution, and heterogeneous data integration. It also mitigates the high cost\nof fine-tuning LLMs, making the system more adaptable to evolving domain\nknowledge and API structures. In summary, KG2data provides a novel solution for\nintelligent, knowledge-based question answering and data analysis in domains\nwith high knowledge demands.",

To lower such\ntechnical barriers, we introduce XROps, a web-based authoring system that\nallows users to create immersive analytics applications through interactive\nvisual programming, without the need for low-level scripting or coding. XROps\nenables dynamic immersive analytics authoring by allowing users to modify each\nstep of the data visualization process with immediate feedback, enabling them\nto build visualizations on-the-fly and adapt to changing environments. It also\nsupports the integration and visualization of real-time sensor data from XR\ndevices, a key feature of immersive analytics, facilitating the creation of\nvarious analysis scenarios. We evaluated the usability of XROps through a user\nstudy and demonstrate its efficacy and usefulness in several example scenarios.\nWe have released a web platform (https://vience.io/xrops) to demonstrate\nvarious examples to supplement our findings.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as\na powerful paradigm for facilitating the self-improvement of large language\nmodels (LLMs), particularly in the domain of complex reasoning tasks. However,\nprevailing on-policy RL methods often contend with significant training\ninstability and inefficiency. This is primarily due to a capacity-difficulty\nmismatch, where the complexity of training data frequently outpaces the model's\ncurrent capabilities, leading to critically sparse reward signals and stalled\nlearning progress. This challenge is particularly acute for smaller, more\nresource-efficient LLMs. To overcome this, we introduce the Guided Hybrid\nPolicy Optimization (GHPO), a novel difficulty-aware reinforcement learning\nframework. GHPO dynamically calibrates task difficulty by employing adaptive\nprompt refinement to provide targeted guidance. This unique approach adaptively\nbalances direct imitation learning for problems currently beyond the model's\nreach with exploration-based reinforcement learning for more manageable tasks,\neffectively creating a smooth and optimized learning curriculum. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that GHPO achieves an average performance gain of\napproximately 5% across six challenging mathematics benchmarks, consistently\noutperforming strong on-policy reinforcement learning and curriculum learning\nbaselines. Further analysis confirms that our framework significantly enhances\nboth training stability and final reasoning performance, thus offering a\nscalable and efficient solution for developing powerful and robust reasoning\nmodels.",

To this end, we propose a selective\noptimization framework that adaptively chooses between backpropagation on\nlow-resolution images (BP-low) and zeroth-order optimization on high-resolution\nimages (ZO-high), guided by the characteristics of the diffusion process. As\nobserved in our experiments, BP-low efficiently adapts the model to\ntarget-specific features, but suffers from structural distortions due to\nresolution mismatch. Conversely, ZO-high refines high-resolution details with\nminimal memory overhead but faces slow convergence when applied without prior\nadaptation. By complementing both methods, our framework leverages BP-low for\neffective personalization while using ZO-high to maintain structural\nconsistency, achieving memory-efficient and high-quality fine-tuning. To\nmaximize the efficacy of both BP-low and ZO-high, we introduce a timestep-aware\nprobabilistic function that dynamically selects the appropriate optimization\nstrategy based on diffusion timesteps. This function mitigates the overfitting\nfrom BP-low at high timesteps, where structural information is critical, while\nensuring ZO-high is applied more effectively as training progresses.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive\nperformance while significantly reducing memory consumption, enabling scalable,\nhigh-quality on-device personalization without increasing inference latency.",

In\nthis work, a novel solution algorithm for multi-scale and non-equilibrium flow\ntransport under an external force is developed based on the Boltzmann-BGK\nequation. The core innovation lies in the fusion of the Hermite spectral method\n(employed to characterize non-equilibrium particle distributions) with a\nmulti-scale evolution model (sourced from the unified gas-kinetic scheme),\nachieving a seamless connection between computational methods and physical\nmodels. To accommodate the properties of the spectral-collocation method, a\nseries of collocation points and weights are adapted based on the Gauss-Hermite\nquadrature. As a result, the computational efficiency of the solution algorithm\nis significantly improved (up to 50 times) while maintaining comparable\naccuracy as the classical discrete velocity method. It is demonstrated that the\nsolution algorithm effectively preserves the key structural features of\ngas-dynamic systems subjected to an external force, e.g., the well-balanced\nproperty.

    "abstract": "Our research uncovers a novel privacy risk associated with multimodal large\nlanguage models (MLLMs): the ability to infer sensitive personal attributes\nfrom audio data -- a technique we term audio private attribute profiling. This\ncapability poses a significant threat, as audio can be covertly captured\nwithout direct interaction or visibility. Moreover, compared to images and\ntext, audio carries unique characteristics, such as tone and pitch, which can\nbe exploited for more detailed profiling. However, two key challenges exist in\nunderstanding MLLM-employed private attribute profiling from audio: (1) the\nlack of audio benchmark datasets with sensitive attribute annotations and (2)\nthe limited ability of current MLLMs to infer such attributes directly from\naudio. To address these challenges, we introduce AP^2, an audio benchmark\ndataset that consists of two subsets collected and composed from real-world\ndata, and both are annotated with sensitive attribute labels. Additionally, we\npropose Gifts, a hybrid multi-agent framework that leverages the complementary\nstrengths of audio-language models (ALMs) and large language models (LLMs) to\nenhance inference capabilities. Gifts employs an LLM to guide the ALM in\ninferring sensitive attributes, then forensically analyzes and consolidates the\nALM's inferences, overcoming severe hallucinations of existing ALMs in\ngenerating long-context responses. Our evaluations demonstrate that Gifts\nsignificantly outperforms baseline approaches in inferring sensitive\nattributes. Finally, we investigate model-level and data-level defense\nstrategies to mitigate the risks of audio private attribute profiling. Our work\nvalidates the feasibility of audio-based privacy attacks using MLLMs,\nhighlighting the need for robust defenses, and provides a dataset and framework\nto facilitate future research.",

One well-studied test case in this domain is the\nbouba-kiki effect, where humans reliably associate pseudowords like \"bouba\"\nwith round shapes and \"kiki\" with jagged ones. Given the mixed evidence found\nin prior studies for this effect in VLMs, we present a comprehensive\nre-evaluation focused on two variants of CLIP, ResNet and Vision Transformer\n(ViT), given their centrality in many state-of-the-art VLMs. We apply two\ncomplementary methods closely modelled after human experiments: a prompt-based\nevaluation that uses probabilities as model preference, and we use Grad-CAM as\na novel way to interpret visual attention in shape-word matching tasks. Our\nfindings show that these models do not consistently exhibit the bouba-kiki\neffect. While ResNet shows a preference for round shapes, overall performance\nacross both models lacks the expected associations. Moreover, direct comparison\nwith prior human data on the same task shows that the models' responses fall\nmarkedly short of the robust, modality-integrated behaviour characteristic of\nhuman cognition.

These faults can cause equipment\ndamage, affect system reliability, and results in expensive repair costs. As\nelectric power systems are becoming more complex, traditional protection\nmethods face limitations and shortcomings. Faults in power systems can occur at\nanytime and anywhere, can be caused by a natural disaster or an accident, and\ntheir occurrence can be hardly predicted or avoided; therefore, it is crucial\nto accurately estimate the fault location and quickly restore service. The\ndevelopment of methods capable of accurately detecting, locating and removing\nfaults is essential (i.e. fast isolation of faults is necessary to maintain the\nsystem stability at transmission levels; accurate and fast detection and\nlocation of faults are essential for increasing reliability and customer\nsatisfaction at distribution levels). This has motivated the development of new\nand more efficient methods. Methods developed to detect and locate faults in\npower systems can be divided into two categories, conventional and artificial\nintelligence-based techniques. Although the utilization of artificial\nintelligence (AI) techniques offer tremendous potential, they are challenging\nand time consuming (i.e. many AI techniques require training data for\nprocessing).

This approach exponentially reduces the\nmotion error in a pixel-wise and frame-wise loopable manner. Despite its\nefficacy, P-BSC suffers from high computational overhead and error accumulation\ndue to its reliance on multi-frame phase calculations and weighted summations.\nInspired by P-BSC, we propose an image-sequential binomial self-compensation\n(I-BSC) to weight sum the homogeneous fringe images instead of successive phase\nframes, which generalizes the BSC concept from phase sequences to image\nsequences. I-BSC computes the arctangent function only once, resolving both\nlimitations in P-BSC. Extensive analysis, simulations, and experiments show\nthat 1) the proposed BSC outperforms existing methods in reducing motion error\nwhile achieving a quasi-single-shot frame rate, i.e., depth map frame rate\nequals to the camera's acquisition rate, enabling 3D reconstruction with high\npixel-depth-temporal resolution; 2) compared to P-BSC, our I-BSC reduces the\ncomputational complexity by one polynomial order, thereby accelerating the\ncomputational frame rate by several to dozen times, while also reaching faster\nmotion error convergence.",

A technical advantage\nof MgAl2O4 is that a continuous and flat thin film is realized on a Si\nsubstrate even when the MgAl2O4 thickness is as thin as 0.5 nm, unlike MgO,\nwhich enables us to examine the spin transport in a thinner range of the tunnel\nbarrier thickness. Our distinct finding is as follows: When the Fe/Mg/MgO\ninterface is used on the top side, the spin polarization PS of tunneling\nelectrons increases at 10 K as the total MgO/MgAl2O4 tunnel barrier thickness\n(tox = 0.47 - 1.4 nm) is increased, regardless of different thickness\ncombinations, and PS shows saturation-like behavior when tox is above 1.1 nm.\nSince this feature cannot be explained by the well-known conductivity mismatch\nin semiconductor-based ferromagnetic tunnel junctions, we propose a simple\nphenomenological tunneling model based on two different direct tunneling paths,\nwhich have higher/lower spin polarizations with longer/shorter decay lengths.\nOur numerical calculation reproduces the relationship between the spin\npolarization PS and total tunnel barrier thickness tox in the experiments,\nindicating that the dominant mechanism is an increasing contribution of the\nlower spin polarization path as tox is decreased. We discuss possible origins\nfor this phenomenon including intrinsic and extrinsic tunneling mechanisms.

    "abstract": "A broad range of applications involve signals with irregular structures that\ncan be represented as a graph. As the underlying structures can change over\ntime, the tracking dynamic graph topologies from observed signals is a\nfundamental challenge in graph signal processing (GSP), with applications in\nvarious domains, such as power systems, the brain-machine interface, and\ncommunication systems. In this paper, we propose a method for tracking dynamic\nchanges in graph topologies. Our approach builds on a representation of the\ndynamics as a graph-based nonlinear state-space model (SSM), where the\nobservations are graph signals generated through graph filtering, and the\nunderlying evolving topology serves as the latent states. In our formulation,\nthe graph Laplacian matrix is parameterized using the incidence matrix and edge\nweights, enabling a structured representation of the state. In order to track\nthe evolving topology in the resulting SSM, we develop a sparsity-aware\nextended Kalman filter (EKF) that integrates $\\ell_1$-regularized updates\nwithin the filtering process. Furthermore, a dynamic programming scheme to\nefficiently compute the Jacobian of the graph filter is introduced.

Recent studies have attempted to integrate them\nvia multimodal knowledge graphs (MKGs) to further enhance recommendation\nperformance. However, existing methods typically freeze the MKG structure\nduring training, which limits the full integration of structural information\nfrom heterogeneous graphs (e.g., KG and user-item interaction graph), and\nresults in sub-optimal performance. To address this challenge, we propose a\nnovel framework, termed Self-loop Iterative Fusion of Heterogeneous Auxiliary\nInformation for Multimodal Recommendation (SLIF-MR), which leverages item\nrepresentations from previous training epoch as feedback signals to dynamically\noptimize the heterogeneous graph structures composed of KG, multimodal item\nfeature graph, and user-item interaction graph. Through this iterative fusion\nmechanism, both user and item representations are refined, thus improving the\nfinal recommendation performance. Specifically, based on the feedback item\nrepresentations, SLIF-MR constructs an item-item correlation graph, then\nintegrated into the establishment process of heterogeneous graphs as additional\nnew structural information in a self-loop manner. Consequently, the internal\nstructures of heterogeneous graphs are updated with the feedback item\nrepresentations during training. Moreover, a semantic consistency learning\nstrategy is proposed to align heterogeneous item representations across\nmodalities.

In this paper, we investigate these challenges and show that the\nviability of PI in this setting hinges on the existence, uniqueness, and\nregularity of solutions to the Generalized Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (GHJB)\nequation solved at each iteration.

In our simulation, prey and predator agents co-evolve their innate\nreward functions, including a possibly fear-like term for observing predators,\nand learn behaviors via reinforcement learning. Surprisingly, our simulation\nrevealed that social reward for observing the same species is more important\nfor prey to survive, and fear-like negative reward for observing predators\nevolves only after acquiring social reward. We also found that the predator\nwith increased hunting ability (larger mouth) amplified fear emergence, but\nalso that fear evolution is more stable with non-evolving predators that are\nbad at chasing prey. Additionally, unlike for predators, we found that positive\nrewards evolve in opposition to fear for stationary threats, as areas with\nabundant leftover food develop around them.

Our\nexperiments prove that directly combining ParPS with the sequential update\nscheme leads to the policy updating baseline drift problem, thereby failing to\nachieve improvement. To solve the conflict between monotonic improvement and\nParPS, we propose the Optimal Marginal Deterministic Policy Gradient (OMDPG)\nalgorithm. First, we replace the sequentially computed $Q_{\\psi}^s(s,a_{1:i})$\nwith the Optimal Marginal Q (OMQ) function $\\phi_{\\psi}^*(s,a_{1:i})$ derived\nfrom Q-functions. This maintains MAAD's monotonic improvement while eliminating\nthe conflict through optimal joint action sequences instead of sequential\npolicy ratio calculations. Second, we introduce the Generalized Q Critic (GQC)\nas the critic function, employing pessimistic uncertainty-constrained loss to\noptimize different Q-value estimations.

Based on our parameter study, we\nfind that (i) the accretion feedback should be sufficiently geometrically\nconfined and the eccentricity of the post-supernova binary orbit should be\n$0.7\\lesssim e\\lesssim0.9$ to sustain a high accretion rate, and (ii) the\nviewing angle should be close to edge-on to match the low undulation amplitude\n($\\Delta L/L\\sim0.1$) of SN2022jli. Different combinations of parameters could\naccount for other supernovae like SN2022mop, SN2009ip and SN2015ap. We also\ndiscuss possible explanations for other key features of SN2022jli such as the\n$\\gamma$-ray detection at $\\sim200~\\mathrm{d}$ and the rapid optical drop at\n$\\sim250~\\mathrm{d}$. Finally, we speculate on the future evolution of the\nsystem and its relation to existing neutron star binaries.",

However, studies of protoclusters at these high redshifts\nremain limited, primarily due to small sample sizes and heterogeneous selection\ncriteria. In this work, we conduct a systematic investigation of the star\nformation and cold gas properties of member galaxies of eight massive\nprotoclusters in the COSMOS field, using the statistical and homogeneously\nselected sample from the Noema formIng Cluster survEy (NICE). Our analysis\nreveals a steep increase in the star formation rates per halo mass\n($\\Sigma_{\\rm SFR} /M_{\\rm halo}$) with redshifts in these intensively\nstar-forming protoclusters, reaching values one to two orders of magnitude\nhigher than those observed in the field at z>2. We further show that, instead\nof an enhancement of starbursts, this increase is largely driven by the\nconcentration of massive and gas-rich star-forming galaxies in the protocluster\ncores. The member galaxies still generally follow the same star formation main\nsequence as in the field, with a moderate enhancement at the low mass end.\nNotably, the most massive protocluster galaxies\n($M_\\star$>8$\\times$10$^{10}$M$_\\odot$) exhibit higher $f_{\\rm gas}$ and\n$\\tau_{\\rm gas}$ than their field counterparts, while remaining on the star\nforming main sequence.

However,\nits application in the ranking stage, especially when richer contextual\ninformation in user-item interactions is available, remains underexplored. A\nmajor challenge lies in the substantial computational cost associated with\nrepeatedly retrieving neighborhood information from billions of items stored in\ndistributed systems. This resource-intensive requirement makes it difficult to\nscale graph-based methods in practical RecSys. To bridge this gap, we first\ndemonstrate that incorporating graphs in the ranking stage improves ranking\nqualities. Notably, while the improvement is evident, we show that the\nsubstantial computational overheads entailed by graphs are prohibitively\nexpensive for real-world recommendations. In light of this, we propose a\nnon-parametric strategy that utilizes graph convolution for re-ranking only\nduring test time. Our strategy circumvents the notorious computational\noverheads from graph convolution during training, and utilizes structural\nknowledge hidden in graphs on-the-fly during testing. It can be used as a\nplug-and-play module and easily employed to enhance the ranking ability of\nvarious ranking layers of a real-world RecSys with significantly reduced\ncomputational overhead. Through comprehensive experiments across four benchmark\ndatasets with varying levels of sparsity, we demonstrate that our strategy\nyields noticeable improvements (i.e., 8.1% on average) during testing time with\nlittle to no additional computational overheads (i.e., 0.5 on average).

To solve\nthis problem, we propose the Vulnerability Mitigation System (VMS), a novel\nagent based on a Large Language Model (LLM) capable of performing penetration\ntesting without human intervention. The VMS has a two-part architecture for\nplanning and a Summarizer, which enable it to generate commands and process\nfeedback. To standardize testing, we designed two new Capture the Flag (CTF)\nbenchmarks based on the PicoCTF and OverTheWire platforms with 200 challenges.\nThese benchmarks allow us to evaluate how effectively the system functions. We\nperformed a number of experiments using various LLMs while tuning the\ntemperature and top-p parameters and found that GPT-4o performed best,\nsometimes even better than expected. The results indicate that LLMs can be\neffectively applied to many cybersecurity tasks; however, there are risks. To\nensure safe operation, we used a containerized environment. Both the VMS and\nthe benchmarks are publicly available, advancing the creation of secure,\nautonomous cybersecurity tools.",

    "abstract": "Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging plays an essential role in contemporary\nclinical diagnostics. It is increasingly integrated into advanced therapeutic\nworkflows, such as hybrid Positron Emission Tomography/Magnetic Resonance\n(PET/MR) imaging and MR-only radiation therapy. These integrated approaches are\ncritically dependent on accurate estimation of radiation attenuation, which is\ntypically facilitated by synthesizing Computed Tomography (CT) images from MR\nscans to generate attenuation maps. However, existing MR-to-CT synthesis\nmethods for whole-body imaging often suffer from poor spatial alignment between\nthe generated CT and input MR images, and insufficient image quality for\nreliable use in downstream clinical tasks. In this paper, we present a novel 3D\nWavelet Latent Diffusion Model (3D-WLDM) that addresses these limitations by\nperforming modality translation in a learned latent space. By incorporating a\nWavelet Residual Module into the encoder-decoder architecture, we enhance the\ncapture and reconstruction of fine-scale features across image and latent\nspaces. To preserve anatomical integrity during the diffusion process, we\ndisentangle structural and modality-specific characteristics and anchor the\nstructural component to prevent warping. We also introduce a Dual Skip\nConnection Attention mechanism within the diffusion model, enabling the\ngeneration of high-resolution CT images with improved representation of bony\nstructures and soft-tissue contrast.",

    "abstract": "Inductive bias is a key factor in spatial regression models, determining how\nwell a model can learn from limited data and capture spatial patterns. This\nwork revisits the inductive biases in Geographically Neural Network Weighted\nRegression (GNNWR) and identifies limitations in current approaches for\nmodeling spatial non-stationarity. While GNNWR extends traditional\nGeographically Weighted Regression by using neural networks to learn spatial\nweighting functions, existing implementations are often restricted by fixed\ndistance-based schemes and limited inductive bias. We propose to generalize\nGNNWR by incorporating concepts from convolutional neural networks, recurrent\nneural networks, and transformers, introducing local receptive fields,\nsequential context, and self-attention into spatial regression. Through\nextensive benchmarking on synthetic spatial datasets with varying\nheterogeneity, noise, and sample sizes, we show that GNNWR outperforms classic\nmethods in capturing nonlinear and complex spatial relationships. Our results\nalso reveal that model performance depends strongly on data characteristics,\nwith local models excelling in highly heterogeneous or small-sample scenarios,\nand global models performing better with larger, more homogeneous data.

In this study, we develop and analyze a compartmental model of HIV\ntransmission that incorporates both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains,\ndiagnosis status, and treatment progression, including switching to second-line\ntherapy upon detection of resistance. Basic reproduction numbers for both\nstrains are derived, and equilibrium analysis reveals the existence of a\ndisease-free state and two endemic states, where the drug-sensitive strain may\nbe eliminated while the drug-resistant strain persists. Local and global\nsensitivity analyses are performed, using partial rank correlation coefficient\n(PRCC) and Sobol methods, to identify key parameters influencing different\nmodel outcomes. We extend the model using optimal control theory to assess\nmultiple intervention strategies targeting diagnosis, treatment initiation, and\nadherence. A novel dynamic control framework is proposed to achieve the UNAIDS\n95-95-95 targets through efficient resource allocation. Numerical simulations\nvalidate the analytical results and compare the effectiveness and\ncost-efficiency of control strategies. Our findings highlight that long-term\nHIV epidemic control depends critically on prioritizing adherence-focused\ninterventions alongside efforts to expand first-line treatment coverage.",

A key focus is the\ninstantaneous reproduction number, which serves as a threshold indicator for\noutbreak persistence or elimination. When reproduction number, the disease-free\nequilibrium is attainable; otherwise, endemic conditions persist.

This paper presents a novel methodology for\ninterpreting how an LLM encodes and utilizes domain-specific knowledge, using a\nBoiling Water Reactor system as a case study. We adapted a general-purpose LLM\n(Gemma-3-1b-it) to the nuclear domain using a parameter-efficient fine-tuning\ntechnique known as Low-Rank Adaptation. By comparing the neuron activation\npatterns of the base model to those of the fine-tuned model, we identified a\nsparse set of neurons whose behavior was significantly altered during the\nadaptation process. To probe the causal role of these specialized neurons, we\nemployed a neuron silencing technique. Our results demonstrate that while\nsilencing most of these specialized neurons individually did not produce a\nstatistically significant effect, deactivating the entire group collectively\nled to a statistically significant degradation in task performance. Qualitative\nanalysis further revealed that silencing these neurons impaired the model's\nability to generate detailed, contextually accurate technical information. This\npaper provides a concrete methodology for enhancing the transparency of an\nopaque black-box model, allowing domain expertise to be traced to verifiable\nneural circuits.

These systems analyse vehicle\nvibrations and measure average traffic speeds to detect traffic events.\nHowever, these systems face difficulties in detecting early signs of\nnon-recurring traffic congestions in low-density traffic flow caused by\npresence of single-lane abnormal events. This is because average traffic speeds\ndo not decrease quickly in such events. During abnormal events, multiple\nvehicles perform spontaneous braking and abrupt lane-changes to avoid obstacles\non travel lanes. These vehicle behaviours gradually lead to traffic congestion.\nThus, frequent lane-change maneuver, performed by multiple vehicles at similar\nlocation, may suggest occurrence of congestion-inducing abnormal events. This\npaper discusses methods to identify and locate occurrence of these single-lane\nabnormal events by detecting frequent lane-change maneuver along road sections.\nWe first propose a method to locate vehicle positions along a road section and\nestimate the vehicle path. We then propose a method to detect vehicle\nlane-change maneuver by monitoring variations in spectral centroid of vehicle\nvibrations. The evaluation of our proposed methods with real traffic data for\ntwo different expressways showed 81.5% accuracy for individual vehicle path\ntracking and 83.5% accuracy in lane-change event detection.

    "abstract": "Spatial time series visualization offers scientific research pathways and\nanalytical decision-making tools across various spatiotemporal domains. Despite\nmany advanced methodologies, the seamless integration of temporal and spatial\ninformation remains a challenge. The space-time cube (STC) stands out as a\npromising approach for the synergistic presentation of spatial and temporal\ninformation, with successful applications across various spatiotemporal\ndatasets. However, the STC is plagued by well-known issues such as visual\nocclusion and depth ambiguity, which are further exacerbated when dealing with\nlarge-scale spatial time series data. In this study, we introduce a novel\ntechnical framework termed VolumeSTCube, designed for continuous spatiotemporal\nphenomena. It first leverages the concept of the STC to transform discretely\ndistributed spatial time series data into continuously volumetric data.\nSubsequently, volume rendering and surface rendering techniques are employed to\nvisualize the transformed volumetric data. Volume rendering is utilized to\nmitigate visual occlusion, while surface rendering provides pattern details by\nenhanced lighting information. Lastly, we design interactions to facilitate the\nexploration and analysis from temporal, spatial, and spatiotemporal\nperspectives. VolumeSTCube is evaluated through a computational experiment, a\nreal-world case study with one expert, and a controlled user study with twelve\nnon-experts, compared against a baseline from prior work, showing its\nsuperiority and effectiveness in largescale spatial time series analysis.",

Existing studies\nemploy the generative models to synthesize more training samples to mitigate\ndata scarcity. However, these synthetic samples are repetitive or simplistic\nand fail to provide \"crucial information\" that targets the downstream model's\nweaknesses. Additionally, these methods typically require separate training for\ndifferent objects, leading to computational inefficiencies. To address these\nissues, we propose Crucial-Diff, a domain-agnostic framework designed to\nsynthesize crucial samples. Our method integrates two key modules. The Scene\nAgnostic Feature Extractor (SAFE) utilizes a unified feature extractor to\ncapture target information. The Weakness Aware Sample Miner (WASM) generates\nhard-to-detect samples using feedback from the detection results of downstream\nmodel, which is then fused with the output of SAFE module. Together, our\nCrucial-Diff framework generates diverse, high-quality training data, achieving\na pixel-level AP of 83.63% and an F1-MAX of 78.12% on MVTec.

Compared with previous slab density functional theory\ncalculations, which use the electrostatic potential as a proxy for bonding, our\nanalytical model provides a more direct description of bonding, explicitly\nincludes screening (which is often ignored), and is based on simple,\ninterpretable, and well benchmarked parameters. We show that the magnitude of\n$|\\phi_{remote}|$ for typical semiconductor and oxide substrates is few meV,\nsimilar to the van der Waals potential of graphene. This suggests interference\nbetween the graphene and remote substrate potentials, plus interfacial\nreconstructions, must be considered when interpreting experiments on remote\nepitaxy. We use our model to interpret previous experiments from the remote\nepitaxy and related literature, highlighting connections to moire epitaxy and\nto the ordering of graphite intercalation compounds.

In this work, a sodium alginate/gelatin-based\ntriboelectric nanogenerator (SG-TENG) was developed for mechanical energy\nharvesting and real-time sensing in track and field applications. The\nSA/gelatin composite film exhibits high transparency, good flexibility, and\nuniform morphology, enabling stable triboelectric output.

Its output\ncharacteristics are closely related to mechanical parameters such as frequency,\nforce, displacement, and contact area. Furthermore, the device demonstrates\nenergy storage capability by charging capacitors under various dynamic\nconditions. Integrated into a running shoe, the SG-TENG enables self-powered\ngait monitoring and can distinguish between walking, running, and jumping.

This allows researchers to observe\nhow agent behavior aggregates into system-level outcomes and test interventions\nbefore real-world implementation. While current AI advances primarily focus on\ncreating \"digital humans\" with sophisticated individual capabilities, LPMs\ndevelop \"digital societies\" where the richness of interactions reveals emergent\nphenomena.

However,\nrecent studies on rotation-equivariant aerial object detection remain scarce.\nMost detectors rely on data augmentation to enable models to learn\napproximately rotation-equivariant features. A few detectors have constructed\nrotation-equivariant networks, but due to the breaking of strict rotation\nequivariance by typical downsampling processes, these networks only achieve\napproximately rotation-equivariant backbones. Whether strict rotation\nequivariance is necessary for aerial image object detection remains an open\nquestion. In this paper, we implement a strictly rotation-equivariant backbone\nand neck network with a more advanced network structure and compare it with\napproximately rotation-equivariant networks to quantitatively measure the\nimpact of rotation equivariance on the performance of aerial image detectors.\nAdditionally, leveraging the inherently grouped nature of rotation-equivariant\nfeatures, we propose a multi-branch head network that reduces the parameter\ncount while improving detection accuracy.

Through controlled experiments and architectural analysis,\nwe demonstrate that LLMs often articulate correct principles without reliably\napplying them--a failure rooted not in knowledge access, but in computational\nexecution. We term this phenomenon the computational \\textit{split-brain\nsyndrome}, where instruction and action pathways are geometrically and\nfunctionally dissociated. This core limitation recurs across domains, from\nmathematical operations to relational inferences, and explains why model\nbehavior remains brittle even under idealized prompting.

    "abstract": "Latent factor models that integrate data from multiple sources/studies or\nmodalities have garnered considerable attention across various disciplines.\nHowever, existing methods predominantly focus either on multi-study integration\nor multi-modality integration, rendering them insufficient for analyzing the\ndiverse modalities measured across multiple studies. To address this limitation\nand cater to practical needs, we introduce a high-dimensional generalized\nfactor model that seamlessly integrates multi-modality data from multiple\nstudies, while also accommodating additional covariates. We conduct a thorough\ninvestigation of the identifiability conditions to enhance the model's\ninterpretability. To tackle the complexity of high-dimensional nonlinear\nintegration caused by four large latent random matrices, we utilize a\nvariational lower bound to approximate the observed log-likelihood by employing\na variational posterior distribution. By profiling the variational parameters,\nwe establish the asymptotical properties of estimators for model parameters\nusing M-estimation theory. Furthermore, we devise a computationally efficient\nvariational EM algorithm to execute the estimation process and a criterion to\ndetermine the optimal number of both study-shared and study-specific factors.\nExtensive simulation studies and a real-world application show that the\nproposed method significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of\nestimation accuracy and computational efficiency.

    "abstract": "Time series forecasting is a fundamental task with broad applications, yet\nconventional methods often treat data as discrete sequences, overlooking their\norigin as noisy samples of continuous processes. Crucially, discrete noisy\nobservations cannot uniquely determine a continuous function; instead, they\ncorrespond to a family of plausible functions. Mathematically, time series can\nbe viewed as noisy observations of a continuous function family governed by a\nshared probability measure. Thus, the forecasting task can be framed as\nlearning the transition from the historical function family to the future\nfunction family. This reframing introduces two key challenges: (1) How can we\nleverage discrete historical and future observations to learn the relationships\nbetween their underlying continuous functions? (2) How can we model the\ntransition path in function space from the historical function family to the\nfuture function family? To address these challenges, we propose NeuTSFlow, a\nnovel framework that leverages Neural Operators to facilitate flow matching for\nlearning path of measure between historical and future function families. By\nparameterizing the velocity field of the flow in infinite-dimensional function\nspaces, NeuTSFlow moves beyond traditional methods that focus on dependencies\nat discrete points, directly modeling function-level features instead.\nExperiments on diverse forecasting tasks demonstrate NeuTSFlow's superior\naccuracy and robustness, validating the effectiveness of the function-family\nperspective.",

    "abstract": "Reconstructing hyperspectral images (HSI) from RGB images is a cost-effective\nsolution for various vision-based applications. However, most existing\nlearning-based hyperspectral reconstruction methods directly learn the\nRGB-to-HSI mapping using complex attention mechanisms, neglecting the inherent\nchallenge of transitioning from low-dimensional to high-dimensional\ninformation. To address this limitation, we propose a two-stage approach, MCGA,\nwhich first learns spectral patterns before estimating the mapping. In the\nfirst stage, a multi-scale VQ-VAE learns representations from heterogeneous HSI\ndatasets, extracting a Mixture of Codebooks (MoC). In the second stage, the\nRGB-to-HSI mapping is refined by querying features from the MoC to replace\nlatent HSI representations, incorporating prior knowledge rather than forcing a\ndirect high-dimensional transformation. To further enhance reconstruction\nquality, we introduce Grayscale-Aware Attention and Quantized Self-Attention,\nwhich adaptively adjust feature map intensities to meet hyperspectral\nreconstruction requirements. This physically motivated attention mechanism\nensures lightweight and efficient HSI recovery. Moreover, we propose an\nentropy-based Test-Time Adaptation strategy to improve robustness in real-world\nscenarios.

Since the kernel governs critical system operations and\nenforces isolation boundaries between user space and privileged data, any\nmechanism that modifies its behavior must meet the highest standards of safety\nand correctness. To this end, the eBPF toolchain includes a verifier, which\nstatically checks safety properties such as memory access validity, bounded\nloops, and type correctness before loading the program into the kernel.\nHowever, the existing verifier is both overly conservative in some\ncases-rejecting valid programs-and unsound in others, permitting unsafe\nbehavior that violates the intended semantics of the kernel interface.\n  To address these challenges, we introduce BeePL, a domain-specific language\nfor eBPF with a formally verified type system. The BeePL type system, along\nwith the language design, statically enforces key safety properties such as\ntype-correct memory access, safe pointer usage, absence of unbounded loops, and\nstructured control flow. These guarantees are backed by formal type soundness\nproofs, ensuring that well-typed programs satisfy the safety invariants\nrequired by the eBPF execution environment. BeePL also proves that well-typed\nsource programs meet critical eBPF-specific properties related to memory\nsafety, termination, and control flow, enabling high-level reasoning prior to\ncompilation. For properties not fully enforceable statically-such as dynamic\nbounds and undefined behavior-BeePL inserts semantics-preserving runtime checks\nduring compilation.

Previous work\n\\cite{chekuri2022covering} considered the setting when $r$ is large and\ndeveloped bi-criteria approximation algorithms, and approximation algorithms\nfor the important special case when each $f_i$ is a weighted coverage function.\nThese are fairly general models and capture several concrete and interesting\nproblems as special cases. The approximation ratios for these problem are at\nleast $\\Omega(\\log r)$ which is unavoidable when $r$ is part of the input. In\nthis paper, motivated by some recent applications, we consider the problem when\n$r$ is a \\emph{fixed constant} and obtain two main results. For covering\nmultiple submodular constraints we obtain a randomized bi-criteria\napproximation algorithm that for any given integer $\\alpha \\ge 1$ outputs a set\n$S$ such that $f_i(S) \\ge$ $(1-1/e^\\alpha -\\epsilon)b_i$ for each $i \\in [r]$\nand $\\mathbb{E}[c(S)] \\le (1+\\epsilon)\\alpha \\cdot \\sf{OPT}$.

    "abstract": "Video understanding plays a vital role in bridging low-level visual signals\nwith high-level cognitive reasoning, and is fundamental to applications such as\nautonomous driving, embodied AI, and the broader pursuit of AGI. The rapid\ndevelopment of large language models (LLMs), particularly those utilizing\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) technology, has significantly advanced video reasoning\ncapabilities. However, current approaches primarily depend on textual\ninformation for reasoning, overlooking the visual modality in the actual video\nreasoning process. In contrast, humans naturally re-examine visual content\nwhile reasoning. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel video reasoning\nparadigm: Video-Text Interleaved CoT (ViTCoT), which facilitates more intuitive\nand cognitively aligned reasoning. To the end, first, we construct the\nVideo-Text Interleaved Benchmark (ViTIB), which is created using MLLMs for\nkey-video selection and manually verified. Furthermore, we extensively explore\nthe potential of the ViTCoT paradigm in the video understanding field.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that ViTCoT significantly enhances\nperformance compared to the traditional text-only CoT paradigm and effectively\nactivates more neuron values in MLLMs.",

However, it remains unclear what mechanisms\ninside the model drive such task-level generalization. In this work, we\napproach this question through the lens of off-by-one addition (i.e., 1+1=3,\n2+2=5, 3+3=?), a two-step, counterfactual task with an unexpected +1 function\nas a second step. Leveraging circuit-style interpretability techniques such as\npath patching, we analyze the models' internal computations behind their\nnotable performance and present three key findings. First, we uncover a\nfunction induction mechanism that explains the model's generalization from\nstandard addition to off-by-one addition. This mechanism resembles the\nstructure of the induction head mechanism found in prior work and elevates it\nto a higher level of abstraction. Second, we show that the induction of the +1\nfunction is governed by multiple attention heads in parallel, each of which\nemits a distinct piece of the +1 function. Finally, we find that this function\ninduction mechanism is reused in a broader range of tasks, including synthetic\ntasks such as shifted multiple-choice QA and algorithmic tasks such as base-8\naddition.

We aim at constraining planet formation and evolution\nprocesses by statistically analysing planetary systems generated by the\nGeneration III Bern model, comparing with the correlations derived from\nobservational samples. Using synthetic planets biased to observational\ncompleteness, we find that (1) the occurrence rates of large giant planets and\nNeptune-size planets are positively correlated with [Fe/H], while small\nsub-Earths exhibit an anti-correlation. In between, for sub-Neptune and\nsuper-Earth, the occurrence rate first increases and then decreases with\nincreasing [Fe/H] with an inflection point at 0.1 dex. (2) Planets with orbital\nperiods shorter than ten days are more likely to be found around stars with\nhigher metallicity, and this tendency weakens with increasing planet radius.\n(3) Both giant planets and small planets exhibit a positive correlation between\nthe eccentricity and [Fe/H], which could be explained by the self-excitation\nand perturbation of outer giant planets. (4) The radius valley deepens and\nbecomes more prominent with increasing [Fe/H], accompanied by a lower\nsuper-Earth-to-sub-Neptune ratio. Furthermore, the average radius of the\nplanets above the valley increases with [Fe/H]. Our nominal model successfully\nreproduces many observed correlations with stellar metallicity, supporting the\ndescription of physical processes and parameters included in the Bern model.\nHowever, the dependences of orbital eccentricity and period on [Fe/H] predicted\nby the synthetic population is however significantly weaker than observed.

However, these approaches typically require computation-intensive\ntraining of a base model and a reward model, which not only incurs substantial\ncomputational overhead but may also compromise model accuracy and training\nefficiency. To address these limitations, we propose Inversion-DPO, a novel\nalignment framework that circumvents reward modeling by reformulating Direct\nPreference Optimization (DPO) with DDIM inversion for DMs. Our method conducts\nintractable posterior sampling in Diffusion-DPO with the deterministic\ninversion from winning and losing samples to noise and thus derive a new\npost-training paradigm. This paradigm eliminates the need for auxiliary reward\nmodels or inaccurate appromixation, significantly enhancing both precision and\nefficiency of training. We apply Inversion-DPO to a basic task of text-to-image\ngeneration and a challenging task of compositional image generation. Extensive\nexperiments show substantial performance improvements achieved by Inversion-DPO\ncompared to existing post-training methods and highlight the ability of the\ntrained generative models to generate high-fidelity compositionally coherent\nimages. For the post-training of compostitional image geneation, we curate a\npaired dataset consisting of 11,140 images with complex structural annotations\nand comprehensive scores, designed to enhance the compositional capabilities of\ngenerative models. Inversion-DPO explores a new avenue for efficient,\nhigh-precision alignment in diffusion models, advancing their applicability to\ncomplex realistic generation tasks.

To resolve this issue, we propose a novel framework that\nintegrates HE with advanced neural networks to secure facial data throughout\nthe inference phase.

While recent works show that base models can acquire such reasoning\ntraces via reinforcement learning or distillation from stronger models like\nDeepSeek-R1, previous works demonstrate that even short CoT prompting without\nfine-tuning is able to improve reasoning. We ask whether long CoT can be\ninduced in a base model using only prompting or minimal tuning. Using just 20\nlong CoT examples from the reasoning model \\texttt{QwQ-32B-Preview}, we lightly\nfine-tune the base model \\texttt{Qwen2.5-32B}. The resulting model outperforms\nthe much larger \\texttt{Qwen2.5-Math-72B-Instruct}, showing that a handful of\nhigh-quality examples can unlock strong reasoning capabilities. We further\nexplore using CoT data from non-reasoning models and human annotators, enhanced\nwith prompt engineering, multi-pass editing, and structural guidance. However,\nneither matches the performance of reasoning model traces, suggesting that\ncertain latent qualities of expert CoT are difficult to replicate. We analyze\nkey properties of reasoning data, such as problem difficulty, diversity, and\nanswer length, that influence reasoning distillation. While challenges remain,\nwe are optimistic that carefully curated human-written CoT, even in small\nquantities, can activate reasoning behaviors in base models.

It is commonly accepted that as one moves away from\nthe vortex's axis of an $s$-wave superconductor, the density of superconductive\nelectrons gradually increases from zero to its bulk value. However, we\ndemonstrate that this behavior is qualitatively altered in the zero-temperature\nlimit provided that the Cooper pairs comprising the superconductive liquid are\nsufficiently tightly bound. Specifically, outside the vortex core, the density\nof superconductive electrons reaches a maximum surpassing its bulk value. This\nphenomenon has electrostatic origins: since normal electrons are absent and\nthere exists a charged ionic background, the spatial variation of the charge\ndensity of superconductive electrons violates local neutrality, leading to the\ngeneration of an electric field. This electric field shrinks the vortex core\nand turns the density profile into that with a maximum, ensuring global\nneutrality. The effect is most pronounced in the limit of strong electrostatic\nscreening, where the field configurations describing the vortex attain a\nuniversal form, with the electric field screened over a length scale determined\nby the London penetration depth.",

However, WSD relies on explicit decay\nphases to track progress, while weight averaging addresses this limitation at\nthe cost of additional memory.

    "abstract": "Protecting cyberspace requires not only advanced tools but also a shift in\nhow we reason about threats, trust, and autonomy. Traditional cybersecurity\nmethods rely on manual responses and brittle heuristics. To build proactive and\nintelligent defense systems, we need integrated theoretical frameworks and\nsoftware tools. Game theory provides a rigorous foundation for modeling\nadversarial behavior, designing strategic defenses, and enabling trust in\nautonomous systems. Meanwhile, software tools process cyber data, visualize\nattack surfaces, verify compliance, and suggest mitigations. Yet a disconnect\nremains between theory and practical implementation.\n  The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) and agentic AI offers a new path to\nbridge this gap. LLM-powered agents can operationalize abstract strategies into\nreal-world decisions. Conversely, game theory can inform the reasoning and\ncoordination of these agents across complex workflows. LLMs also challenge\nclassical game-theoretic assumptions, such as perfect rationality or static\npayoffs, prompting new models aligned with cognitive and computational\nrealities. This co-evolution promises richer theoretical foundations and novel\nsolution concepts. Agentic AI also reshapes software design: systems must now\nbe modular, adaptive, and trust-aware from the outset.\n  This chapter explores the intersection of game theory, agentic AI, and\ncybersecurity. We review key game-theoretic frameworks (e.g., static, dynamic,\nBayesian, and signaling games) and solution concepts. We then examine how LLM\nagents can enhance cyber defense and introduce LLM-driven games that embed\nreasoning into AI agents. Finally, we explore multi-agent workflows and\ncoordination games, outlining how this convergence fosters secure, intelligent,\nand adaptive cyber systems.",

    "abstract": "Over the past years, we have developed GATE version 10, a major\nre-implementation of the long-standing Geant4-based Monte Carlo application for\nparticle and radiation transport simulation in medical physics. This release\nintroduces many new features and significant improvements, most notably a\nPython-based user interface replacing the legacy static input files. The new\nfunctionality of GATE version 10 is described in the part 1 companion paper.\nThe development brought significant challenges. In this paper, we present the\nsolutions that we have developed to overcome these challenges. In particular,\nwe present a modular design that robustly manages the core components of a\nsimulation: particle sources, geometry, physics processes, and data\nacquisition. The architecture consists of parts written in C++ and Python,\nwhich needed to be coupled. We explain how this framework allows for the\nprecise, time-aware generation of primary particles, a critical requirement for\naccurately modeling positron emission tomography (PET), radionuclide therapies,\nand prompt-gamma timing systems. We present how GATE 10 handles complex Geant4\nphysics settings while exposing a simple interface to the user. Furthermore, we\ndescribe the technical solutions that facilitate the seamless integration of\nadvanced physics models and variance reduction techniques. The architecture\nsupports sophisticated scoring of physical quantities (such as Linear Energy\nTransfer and Relative Biological Effectiveness) and is designed for\nmultithreaded execution. The new user interface allows researchers to script\ncomplex simulation workflows and directly couple external tools, such as\nartificial intelligence models for source generation or detector response. By\ndetailing these architectural innovations, we demonstrate how GATE 10 provides\na more powerful and flexible tool for research and innovation in medical\nphysics.",
