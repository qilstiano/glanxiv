    "abstract": "Deep learning has been successfully applied to medical image segmentation,\nenabling accurate identification of regions of interest such as organs and\nlesions. This approach works effectively across diverse datasets, including\nthose with single-image contrast, multi-contrast, and multimodal imaging data.\nTo improve human understanding of these black-box models, there is a growing\nneed for Explainable AI (XAI) techniques for model transparency and\naccountability. Previous research has primarily focused on post hoc pixel-level\nexplanations, using methods gradient-based and perturbation-based apporaches.\nThese methods rely on gradients or perturbations to explain model predictions.\nHowever, these pixel-level explanations often struggle with the complexity\ninherent in multi-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) segmentation tasks,\nand the sparsely distributed explanations have limited clinical relevance. In\nthis study, we propose using contrast-level Shapley values to explain\nstate-of-the-art models trained on standard metrics used in brain tumor\nsegmentation. Our results demonstrate that Shapley analysis provides valuable\ninsights into different models' behavior used for tumor segmentation. We\ndemonstrated a bias for U-Net towards over-weighing T1-contrast and FLAIR,\nwhile Swin-UNETR provided a cross-contrast understanding with balanced Shapley\ndistribution.",

These\nmechanisms correspond to effective torques that align or anti-align a particles\norientation with its velocity, as observed in active granular systems. In the\ncontext of motility-induced phase separation (MIPS) - a non-equilibrium\ncoexistence between a dense clustered phase and a dilute homogeneous phase -\nboth self- and anti-self-alignment are found to suppress clustering.\nSpecifically, increasing self-alignment strength first leads to flocking within\nthe dense cluster, and eventually to the emergence of a homogeneous flocking\nphase. In contrast, anti-self-alignment induces a freezing phenomenon,\nprogressively reducing particle speed until MIPS is suppressed and a\nhomogeneous phase is recovered. These results are supported by scaling\narguments and are amenable to experimental verification in high-density active\ngranular systems exhibiting self- or anti-self-alignment.",

Our findings reveal that the amplitude of\nthe mHz QPO slightly increases with photon energy, accompanied by a narrowing\nof the phase modulation profile. The phase-resolved spectroscopy indicates\nsignificant variability in the energy spectrum: both disk blackbody components\nexhibit marked variations on the QPO timescale, with the low-temperature\ncomponent demonstrating significant synchronous changes in the disk temperature\nand luminosity, showing a positive correlation between these two parameters\nthroughout the QPO cycle. This correlation supports the hypothesis that the\ndisk inner radius corresponds to the magnetospheric radius, which slightly\nvaries with the accretion rate.

So-called SN siblings\ndiscovered in the same galaxy present an opportunity to constrain the\ndependence of the properties of SNe on those of their host galaxies. To\ninvestigate whether there is a connection between sibling SNe in galaxies that\nhave hosted multiple SNe and the properties of galaxies, we have acquired\nintegrated optical spectroscopy of 59 galaxies with multiple core-collapse SNe.\nPerhaps surprisingly, a strong majority of host-galaxy spectra fall within the\ncomposite region of the Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich (BPT) diagram. We find a\nstatistically significant difference (KS test p-value = 0.044) between the\ndistributions of the [NII] $\\lambda$6583/H$\\alpha$ of galaxies that have hosted\na majority SN Ibc and those that have hosted a majority SN II, where the\nmajority SN Ibc galaxies have, on average, higher ratios. The difference\nbetween the distributions of [NII] $\\lambda$6583/H$\\alpha$ may arise from\neither increased contribution from AGN or LINERs in SN Ibc host galaxies,\ngreater metallicity for SN Ibc host galaxies, or both. When comparing the\ninferred oxygen abundance and the ionization parameter for the galaxies in the\nStar-Forming region on the BPT diagram, we find statistically significant\ndifferences between the distributions for SN Ibc hosts and SN II hosts (p=0.008\nand p=0.001, respectively), as well as SN Ib hosts and SN II hosts (p=0.030 and\np=0.006, respectively). We also compare the H$\\alpha$ equivalent width\ndistributions, also integrated across the galaxies, and find no significant\ndifference.",

For example, organizations may need to evaluate and select\ninnovation projects with risky returns. Similarly, when allocating resources to\nresearch projects, funding agencies are tasked with identifying the most\npromising proposals based on idiosyncratic criteria. Finally, in participatory\nbudgeting, a local community may need to select a subset of public projects to\nfund. Regardless of context, agents must estimate the uncertain values of a\npotentially large number of projects. Developing parsimonious methods to\ncompare these projects, and aggregating agent evaluations so that the overall\nbenefit is maximized, are critical in assembling the best project portfolio.\nUnlike in standard sorting algorithms, evaluating projects on the basis of\nuncertain long-term benefits introduces additional complexities. We propose\ncomparison rules based on Quicksort and the Bradley--Terry model, which\nconnects rankings to pairwise \"win\" probabilities. In our model, each agent\ndetermines win probabilities of a pair of projects based on his or her specific\nevaluation of the projects' long-term benefit. The win probabilities are then\nappropriately aggregated and used to rank projects. Several of the methods we\npropose perform better than the two most effective aggregation methods\ncurrently available. Additionally, our methods can be combined with sampling\ntechniques to significantly reduce the number of pairwise comparisons.

The main approaches, called BLP, AIP and BLP+AIP, handle\na PCSP by finding a solution to a relaxation of some integer program.

This\nreconceptualizes irrationality as a relative property, depending on\ndefinability depth, and replaces the binary dichotomy between countable and\nuncountable sets with a gradated spectrum of definability classes. We show that\nthe classical Continuum Hypothesis loses its force in this context: between\naleph_0 and c lies not a single cardinal jump, but a stratified sequence of\ndefinitional stages, each forming a countable yet irreducible approximation to\nthe continuum. We argue that the real line should not be seen as a completed\ntotality but as an evolving architecture of formal expressibility.

Despite significant advancements in artificial intelligence and\nsensor fusion technologies, current single-vehicle perception systems continue\nto encounter limitations, notably visual occlusions and limited long-range\ndetection capabilities. Collaborative Perception (CP), enabled by\nVehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communication, has\nemerged as a promising solution to mitigate these issues and enhance the\nreliability of autonomous systems. Beyond advancements in communication, the\ncomputer vision community is increasingly focusing on improving vehicular\nperception through collaborative approaches. However, a systematic literature\nreview that thoroughly examines existing work and reduces subjective bias is\nstill lacking. Such a systematic approach helps identify research gaps,\nrecognize common trends across studies, and inform future research directions.\nIn response, this study follows the PRISMA 2020 guidelines and includes 106\npeer-reviewed articles. These publications are analyzed based on modalities,\ncollaboration schemes, and key perception tasks. Through a comparative\nanalysis, this review illustrates how different methods address practical\nissues such as pose errors, temporal latency, communication constraints, domain\nshifts, heterogeneity, and adversarial attacks. Furthermore, it critically\nexamines evaluation methodologies, highlighting a misalignment between current\nmetrics and CP's fundamental objectives.

To alleviate\nissues with approximate unlearning, we instead propose SIFT-Masks (SIgn-Fixed\nTuning-Masks), an exact unlearning method based on model merging. SIFT-Masks\naddresses two key limitations of standard model merging: (1) merging a large\nnumber of tasks can severely harm utility; and (2) methods that boost utility\nby sharing extra information across tasks make exact unlearning prohibitively\nexpensive. SIFT-Masks solves these issues by (1) applying local masks to\nrecover task-specific performance; and (2) constraining finetuning to align\nwith a global sign vector as a lightweight approach to determine masks\nindependently before merging. Across four settings where we merge up to 500\nmodels, SIFT-Masks improves accuracy by 5-80% over naive merging and uses up to\n250x less compute for exact unlearning compared to other merging baselines.",

Starting from these premises, in the sections The deduction\nof the form of possible transformations and The Ignatowsky constant it will be\nshown that the choice between the Galilean scheme and one of the generalized\nLorentz type is in fact the only possible one. In a generalized Lorentz scheme,\nthe interactions propagate at a finite velocity VL and the form of the\ntransformations of the space-time coordinates of the events is analogous to\nthose of Lorentz; the only difference is that the limiting speed VL plays the\nrole assumed by the invariance of c, the speed of light in a vacuum, in Lorentz\ntransformations. The line of development of the arguments does not depend\ndirectly on electromagnetism, in other words we are dealing with a regulating\nprinciple for kinematics and for the set of laws of physics. The assumption\nVL=c can be assumed from the experimental datum of the invariance of c, i.e.\nfrom the validity of Maxwell's equations.

Our main result is a $\\operatorname{poly}(d,k,1/\\varepsilon) +\n{k}^{O(k)}$ time algorithm for this problem, which yields an improvement in the\nrunning time of the algorithms of [CDIZ23] and [GM24, arXiv]. We achieve this\nby providing the first local convergence algorithm for self-selection, thus\nresolving the main open question of [CDIZ23].\n  To obtain this algorithm, we reduce self-selection to a seemingly unrelated\nstatistical problem called coarsening. Coarsening occurs when one does not\nobserve the exact value of the sample but only some set (a subset of the sample\nspace) that contains the exact value. Inference from coarse samples arises in\nvarious real-world applications due to rounding by humans and algorithms,\nlimited precision of instruments, and lag in multi-agent systems.\n  Our reduction to coarsening is intuitive and relies on the geometry of the\nself-selection problem, which enables us to bypass the limitations of previous\nanalytic approaches. To demonstrate its applicability, we provide a local\nconvergence algorithm for linear regression under another self-selection\ncriterion, which is related to second-price auction data. Further, we give the\nfirst polynomial time local convergence algorithm for coarse Gaussian mean\nestimation given samples generated from a convex partition. Previously, only a\nsample-efficient algorithm was known due to Fotakis, Kalavasis, Kontonis, and\nTzamos [FKKT21, COLT'21].",

What-if analyses, which evaluate hypothetical scenarios up to the\nworst-case event, play a key role in assessing the potential impacts of extreme\nevents and guiding the development of effective safety policies. This problem\ncan be analyzed using extreme value theory. We employ the well-established\npeaks-over-threshold method and describe a comprehensive toolkit to address\nforecasting needs. We examine an \\lq\\lq out-of-sample\" variable and focus on\nits conditional probability of exceeding a high threshold, representing the\npredictive distribution of future extreme peaks. We demonstrate that the\ngeneralized Pareto approximation of the corresponding predictive density can be\nremarkably accurate. We then introduce frequentist methods and a Bayesian\napproach for estimating this predictive density, enabling the derivation of\ninformative predictive intervals. By leveraging threshold stability, we\nillustrate how predictions can be reliably extended deep into the tail of the\nunknown data distribution. We establish the asymptotic accuracy of the proposed\nestimators and, more importantly, prove that the resulting predictive inference\nis asymptotically valid. Forecasters satisfying the tail-equivalence property\nallow to recover widely used risk measures for risk assessment through point\nforecasts. This insight lays the groundwork for a new perspective that\nintegrates risk assessment into the statistical predictive toolbox. Finally, we\nextend the prediction framework to the case of linear time series. We apply the\nproposed predictive tools to two real-world datasets: summer peak temperatures\nrecorded in Milan, Italy, over the past 30 years, and daily negative\nlog-returns of the Dow Jones Industrial Average observed over 30 years.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the response of a system of hard spheres to two classes of\nperturbations over a range of densities spanning the fluid, crystalline, and\nglassy regimes within a molecular dynamics framework. Firstly, we consider the\nrelaxation of a \"thermal inhomogeneity,\" in which a central region of particles\nis given a higher temperature than its surroundings and is then allowed to\nevolve under Newtonian dynamics. In this case, the hot central \"core\" of\nparticles expands and collides with the cold surrounding material, creating a\ntransient radially-expanding \"compression wave,\" which is rapidly dissipated by\nparticle-particle collisions and interaction with periodic images at the\nboundary, leading to a rapid relaxation to equilibrium. Secondly, we consider a\nrapid compression of the spheres into a disordered glassy state at high\ndensities. Such rapidly compressed systems exhibit very slow structural\nrelaxation times, many orders of magnitude longer than thermalization times for\nsimple temperature inhomogeneities. We find that thermal relaxation of the\nvelocity distribution is determined simply by the total collision rate, whereas\nstructural relaxation requires coordinated collective motion, which is strongly\nsuppressed at high density, although some particle rearrangement nevertheless\noccurs. We further find that collisions propagate significantly faster through\nglassy systems than through crystalline systems at the same density, which\nleads to very rapid relaxation of velocity perturbations, although structural\nrelaxation remains very slow. These results extend the validity of previous\nobservations that glassy systems exhibit a hybrid character, sharing features\nwith both equilibrium and non-equilibrium systems.

The local energy cascade rate $(\\Phi_\\ell)$ at length scale $(\\ell)$\nis defined using the scale-integrated Kolmogorov-Hill (KH) equation. To\ncharacterize intermittency, we analyze the probability density functions (PDFs)\nof longitudinal and transverse velocity increments at scale $\\ell$, conditioned\non positive and negative $\\Phi_\\ell$ (local forward and inverse cascades). Our\nfindings reveal that transverse velocity increments display approximately the\nsame degree of non-Gaussianity and intermittency, in both forward or inverse\ncascade regions. The only noticeable difference is observed for longitudinal\nvelocity increments that display strong negative skewness in regions of forward\ncascade compared to small positive skewness in regions of inverse cascade. We\nrepeat the analysis for filtered velocity gradient tensor elements at scale\n$\\ell$ and obtain similar results, except that the skewness of its longitudinal\nelements is slightly negative even in regions of inverse cascade.

This estimation has been\ncarried out by taking into account a general relativistic approach, which makes\nuse of the positions on the sky of the photon sources and the frequency shift\nobservations from the water megamaser system in circular motion around the\nblack hole. Within the framework of conformal gravity, a way to eliminate the\nsingularity at r=0 from the Schwarzschild spacetime is by introducing a\nconformal factor characterized by a length scale parameter l and an integer\nparameter N. Therefore, the spacetime geometry depends on the mass of the black\nhole, and the conformal gravity parameters l and N. In this work, we estimate\nthe mass-to-distance ratio M/D and the length scale ratio l/D for fixed values\nof the integer parameter N=1,2. This method leads to posterior Gaussian\ndistribution for all the parameters, thus obtaining a most probable value for\nthe length scale parameter l, in contrast to the information extracted from\nprevious constraints based on X-ray astrophysical data, where an upper bound\nfor the parameter l has been established. Furthermore, we obtain new physical\nproperties regarding the existence of the ISCO radius for this nonsingular\nspacetime.",

    "abstract": "Josephson junctions (JJs) with non-sinusoidal current-phase relations (CPRs)\nhave gathered increasing attention, partly due to growing interest in\ntopological 2D materials. Understanding how CPR and inhomogeneities in JJs\ninfluence their response is crucial for accurate interpretation of experimental\nobservations. This Letter reports that a non-sinusoidal CPR, combined with\nasymmetries in the JJ, can break spatial symmetry and give rise to the\nJosephson diode effect (JDE) in the short junction regime. This nonreciprocity\nis shown to emerge as an intrinsic mechanism related to the maximization of the\nsupercurrent, rather than being solely driven by geometric or material\nasymmetries. Further analysis shows that JDE efficiency is strongly influenced\nby the CPR shape but is largely insensitive to junction asymmetry, making the\nobserved nonreciprocity not only a potential experimental signature of\nunconventional CPRs but also a possible method for probing their properties.",

We analyze the forgetting, i.e., loss on previously seen tasks, after\n$k$ iterations. For continual linear models, we prove that fitting a task is\nequivalent to a single stochastic gradient descent (SGD) step on a modified\nobjective. We develop novel last-iterate SGD upper bounds in the realizable\nleast squares setup, which we then leverage to derive new results for continual\nlearning. Focusing on random orderings over $T$ tasks, we establish universal\nforgetting rates, whereas existing rates depend on the problem dimensionality\nor complexity. Specifically, in continual regression with replacement, we\nimprove the best existing rate from $O((d-r)/k)$ to $O(\\min(k^{-1/4},\n\\sqrt{d-r}/k, \\sqrt{Tr}/k))$, where $d$ is the dimensionality and $r$ the\naverage task rank. Furthermore, we establish the first rate for random task\norderings without replacement. The obtained rate of $O(\\min(T^{-1/4},\n(d-r)/T))$ proves for the first time that randomization alone, with no task\nrepetition, can prevent catastrophic forgetting in sufficiently long task\nsequences.

UnCL\nenforces global consistency by dynamically weighting the contribution of each\nvoxel to the consistency loss based on its uncertainty, preserving\nhigh-uncertainty regions instead of filtering them out. Initially, UnCL\nprioritizes learning from uncertain voxels with lower penalties, encouraging\nthe model to explore challenging regions. As training progress, the penalty\nshift towards confident voxels to refine predictions and ensure global\nconsistency. Meanwhile, FeCL enhances local feature discrimination in\nimbalanced regions by introducing dual focal mechanisms and adaptive confidence\nadjustments into the contrastive principle. These mechanisms jointly\nprioritizes hard positives and negatives while focusing on uncertain sample\npairs, effectively capturing subtle lesion variations under class imbalance.\nExtensive evaluations on four diverse medical image segmentation datasets\n(ISLES'22, BraTS'19, LA, Pancreas) show DyCON's superior performance against\nSOTA methods.",

    "abstract": "Standard apodization methods suppress side lobes but increase FWHM, reducing\nlateral resolution. Grating lobes can interfere with the main lobe, introducing\nartifacts in ultrasound images. A simple mathematical apodization function is\nneeded to reduce side lobes while decreasing FWHM, thereby improving lateral\nresolution. The advantage of the new apodization function is that it performs\ncomparably to the Hanning function in suppressing the first grating lobe while\nalso reducing FWHM. This leads to improved lateral resolution and fewer\nartifacts caused by interference between side lobes and the main beam.\nSimulations using the new inverse quadratic apodization and no apodization were\nconducted with a wave pressure model. The new method was implemented using a\nrectangular function convoluted with the Fourier transform of an inverse\nquadratic. FWHM and the first side lobe amplitudes were quantified and compared\nacross apodization functions. The inverse quadratic apodization outperformed no\napodization in FWHM, with values of 0.906 mm and 1.22 mm, respectively. For\nfirst grating lobe suppression, the inverse quadratic and Hanning apodizations\nyielded -31.47 dB and -31 dB, respectively. Simulated B-mode wire phantom scans\nshowed CNR values of 1.06 (no apodization), 1.32 (Hanning), and 1.66 (inverse\nquadratic). Corresponding image sharpness values were 7.3398, 6.6009, and\n7.0039. The proposed apodization improves FWHM over rectangular and better\nsuppresses the first side lobe than Hanning. Lorentzian apodization at a= 8, a=\n15, the method yields superior CNR compared to standard apodizations, with only\na slight trade-off in sharpness.",

While existing foundation models have\ngeneral knowledge of avoiding collisions, they often lack\ntransportation-specific safety knowledge. To overcome these limitations, we\nintroduce LetsPi, a physics-informed, dual-phase, knowledge-driven framework\nfor safe, human-like trajectory planning. To prevent hallucinations and\nminimize uncertainty, this hybrid framework integrates Large Language Model\n(LLM) reasoning with physics-informed social force dynamics. LetsPi leverages\nthe LLM to analyze driving scenes and historical information, providing\nappropriate parameters and target destinations (goals) for the social force\nmodel, which then generates the future trajectory. Moreover, the dual-phase\narchitecture balances reasoning and computational efficiency through its Memory\nCollection phase and Fast Inference phase. The Memory Collection phase\nleverages the physics-informed LLM to process and refine planning results\nthrough reasoning, reflection, and memory modules, storing safe, high-quality\ndriving experiences in a memory bank. Surrogate safety measures and\nphysics-informed prompt techniques are introduced to enhance the LLM's\nknowledge of transportation safety and physical force, respectively. The Fast\nInference phase extracts similar driving experiences as few-shot examples for\nnew scenarios, while simplifying input-output requirements to enable rapid\ntrajectory planning without compromising safety. Extensive experiments using\nthe HighD dataset demonstrate that LetsPi outperforms baseline models across\nfive safety metrics.See PDF for project Github link.",

The\nfact that the total equation of state parameter after the end of the slow-roll\nera is equal to the value determined by the scalar field, has an effect on the\nduration of the $R^2$ governed slow-roll era, and it actually shortens the\nduration of the slow-roll era, by an extent which depends on the reheating\ntemperature too, after all the inflationary patches have ended.

    "abstract": "An assertion is commonly used to validate the expected programs behavior\n(e.g., if the returned value of a method equals an expected value) in software\ntesting. Although it is a recommended practice to use only one assertion in a\nsingle test to avoid code smells (e.g., Assertion Roulette), it is common to\nhave multiple assertions in a single test. One issue with tests that have\nmultiple assertions is that when the test fails at an early assertion (not the\nlast one), the test will terminate at that point, and the remaining testing\ncode will not be executed. This, in turn, can potentially reduce the code\ncoverage and the performance of techniques that rely on code coverage\ninformation (e.g., spectrum-based fault localization). We refer to such a\nscenario as early test termination. Understanding the impact of early test\ntermination on test coverage is important for software testing and debugging,\nparticularly for the techniques that rely on coverage information obtained from\nthe testing. We conducted the first empirical study on early test termination\ndue to assertion failure (i.e., early test termination) by investigating 207\nversions of 6 open-source projects. We found that a nonnegligible portion of\nthe failed tests (19.1%) is early terminated due to assertion failure. Our\nfindings indicate that early test termination harms both code coverage and the\neffectiveness of spectrum-based fault localization. For instance, after\neliminating early test termination, the line/branch coverage is improved in 55%\nof the studied versions, and improves the performance of two popular SBFL\ntechniques Ochiai and Tarantula by 15.1% and 10.7% compared to the original\nsetting (without eliminating early test termination) in terms of MFR,\nrespectively.",

    "abstract": "We study the online facility assignment problem on regular polygons, where\nall sides are of equal length. The influence of specific geometric settings has\nremained mostly unexplored, even though classical online facility assignment\nproblems have mainly dealt with linear and general metric spaces. We fill this\ngap by considering the following four basic geometric settings: equilateral\ntriangles, rectangles, regular $n$-polygons, and circles. The facilities are\nsituated at fixed positions on the boundary, and customers appear sequentially\non the boundary. A customer needs to be assigned immediately without any\ninformation about future customer arrivals. We study a natural greedy\nalgorithm. First, we study an equilateral triangle with three facilities at its\ncorners; customers can appear anywhere on the boundary. We then analyze regular\n$n$-sided polygons, obtaining a competitive ratio of $2n-1$, showing that the\nalgorithm performance degrades linearly with the number of corner points for\npolygons. For the circular configuration, the competitive ratio is $2n-1$ when\nthe distance between two adjacent facilities is the same. And the competitive\nratios are $n^2-n+1$ and $2^n - 1$ for varying distances linearly and\nexponentially respectively. Each facility has a fixed capacity proportional to\nthe geometric configuration, and customers appear only along the boundary\nedges. Our results also show that simpler geometric configurations have more\nefficient performance bounds and that spacing facilities uniformly apart\nprevent worst-case scenarios. The findings have many practical implications\nbecause large networks of facilities are best partitioned into smaller and\ngeometrically simple pieces to guarantee good overall performance.",

Using linear mixed-effects models, we develop such methods that can be\napplied to continuous, binary, or categorical incomplete data by employing\nvariational Bayesian inference to sample the posterior predictive distribution\nof the missing data. These methods specifically target high-dimensional data\nand work with the spike-and-slab prior, which automatically selects the\nvariables of importance to be in the imputation model. The individual\nregression computation is then incorporated into a variable-by-variable\nimputation algorithm. Finally, we use a calibration-based algorithm to adopt\nthese methods to multiple imputations of categorical variables. We present a\nsimulation study and illustrate on National Survey of Children's Health data to\nassess the performance of these methods in a repetitive sampling framework.",

    "abstract": "The study of exotic multi-quark states has garnered significant attention\nrecently, particularly in heavy-quark dynamics within quantum chromodynamics\n(QCD). We perform a comprehensive spectroscopic analysis of fully heavy\npentaquark states with quark configurations $cccc\\bar{c}$ and $bbbb\\bar{b}$,\nconsidering spin-parity quantum numbers $J^P = 1/2^-$, $3/2^-$, and $5/2^-$. We\nconstruct the color-spin wavefunctions to explore the internal structure and\nmixing effects in these exotic states. Using an extended form of the\nGursey-Radicati mass formula by incorporating spin-dependent interactions, we\ncalculated their mass spectra. The modification incorporates effective mass\ncontributions and hyperfine interactions to improve the predictive power for\nthese hadronic states. We systematically analyze their quantum numbers,\nincluding spin parity, isospin, and the eigenvalues of the quadratic Casimir\noperator, which characterize their symmetry properties. The calculated mass\nspectra are compared with existing theoretical predictions to assess the\nstability and possible decay channels of these states. The calculated mass\nspectra exhibit a strong dependence on the interplay between spin interactions\nand color configurations, shedding light on the binding mechanism within these\nfully heavy multiquark systems. To gain further insights into their stability\nand decay properties, we investigated their potential production modes from\n$b$-hadron decays. Our analysis identifies dominant strong decay channels,\nproviding critical theoretical benchmarks for distinguishing these states in\nfuture LHCb or EIC experiments. This study offers new insights into the role of\nheavy-quark dynamics in exotic hadron spectroscopy, serving as a stringent test\nfor effective QCD-based models and lattice QCD predictions.",

In\nthis work, we develop a stochastic algorithm based on an implicit gradient\napproach, suitable for data-intensive applications. It is well-known that for\nthe class of problems of interest, the implicit function is nonsmooth. To\ncircumvent this difficulty, we apply a smoothing technique that involves adding\nsmall random (linear) perturbations to the LL objective and then taking the\nexpectation of the implicit objective over these perturbations. This approach\ngives rise to a novel stochastic formulation that ensures the differentiability\nof the implicit function and leads to the design of a novel and efficient\ndoubly stochastic algorithm.

First, a region-controllable optimal data generation method is\nproposed leveraging Hamiltonian state transition matrices, enabling efficient\ngeneration of optimal trajectories of specified data distribution. Then, to\nobtain a lightweight and effective dataset for efficient strategy learning, an\nerror-distribution-smoothing method is incorporated to employ data filtering,\nwhich reduces dataset size by almost 90% while preserving prediction accuracy.\nTo assess the operational domain of the learned strategy, a confidence-aware\nlearning guidance strategy is proposed based on gaussian process regression,\nachieving constraint satisfaction even beyond training distributions. Numerical\nsimulations validate the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed learning\nframework in terms of data generation, data filtering and strategy learning.",

    "abstract": "Accurate brain tumor diagnosis relies on the assessment of multiple Magnetic\nResonance Imaging (MRI) sequences. However, in clinical practice, the\nacquisition of certain sequences may be affected by factors like motion\nartifacts or contrast agent contraindications, leading to suboptimal outcome,\nsuch as poor image quality. This can then affect image interpretation by\nradiologists. Synthesizing high quality MRI sequences has thus become a\ncritical research focus. Though recent advancements in controllable generative\nAI have facilitated the synthesis of diagnostic quality MRI, ensuring\nanatomical accuracy remains a significant challenge. Preserving critical\nstructural relationships between different anatomical regions is essential, as\neven minor structural or topological inconsistencies can compromise diagnostic\nvalidity. In this work, we propose BrainMRDiff, a novel topology-preserving,\nanatomy-guided diffusion model for synthesizing brain MRI, leveraging brain and\ntumor anatomies as conditioning inputs. To achieve this, we introduce two key\nmodules: Tumor+Structure Aggregation (TSA) and Topology-Guided Anatomy\nPreservation (TGAP). TSA integrates diverse anatomical structures with tumor\ninformation, forming a comprehensive conditioning mechanism for the diffusion\nprocess. TGAP enforces topological consistency during reverse denoising\ndiffusion process; both these modules ensure that the generated image respects\nanatomical integrity. Experimental results demonstrate that BrainMRDiff\nsurpasses existing baselines, achieving performance improvements of 23.33% on\nthe BraTS-AG dataset and 33.33% on the BraTS-Met dataset. Code will be made\npublicly available soon.",

For global search, the SCTS\nstrategy splits giant tours to generate diverse solutions, and the search\nprocess is guided by a comprehensive fitness evaluation function to dynamically\ncontrol feasibility and diversity to produce solutions that are both diverse\nand near-feasible. For local search, ELS incorporates tailored move operators\nwith constant-time move evaluation mechanisms, enabling efficient exploration\nof large solution neighborhoods. Experimental results demonstrate that METS\ndiscovers 31 new best-known solutions out of 40 instances in existing benchmark\nsets, achieving substantial improvements over current state-of-the-art methods.\nAdditionally, a new large-scale benchmark set based on real-world logistics\ndata is introduced to facilitate future research.",

Inspired by the\ninterpretability theory of feature attribution in neural network models, we\nobserve that not all tokens have the same contribution. Based on this\nobservation, we propose a novel token pruning framework, namely Saliency-driven\nDynamic Token Pruning (SDTP), to gradually and dynamically prune redundant\ntokens based on the input context. Specifically, a lightweight saliency-driven\nprediction module is designed to estimate the importance score of each token\nwith its hidden state, which is added to different layers of the LLM to\nhierarchically prune redundant tokens. Furthermore, a ranking-based\noptimization strategy is proposed to minimize the ranking divergence of the\nsaliency score and the predicted importance score. Extensive experiments have\nshown that our framework is generalizable to various models and datasets. By\nhierarchically pruning 65\\% of the input tokens, our method greatly reduces\n33\\% $\\sim$ 47\\% FLOPs and achieves speedup up to 1.75$\\times$ during\ninference, while maintaining comparable performance.

This study investigates how risk perception and AV\nperformance (error vs. no error) influence emotional responses and trust in\nAVs, using mediation analysis to examine the indirect effects of emotions. In\nthis study, 70 participants (42 male, 28 female) watched real-life recorded\nvideos of AVs operating with or without errors, coupled with varying levels of\nrisk information (high, low, or none). They reported their anticipated\nemotional responses using 19 discrete emotion items, and trust was assessed\nthrough dispositional, learned, and situational trust measures. Factor analysis\nidentified four key emotional components, namely hostility, confidence,\nanxiety, and loneliness, that were influenced by risk perception and AV\nperformance. The linear mixed model showed that risk perception was not a\nsignificant predictor of trust, while performance and individual differences\nwere. Mediation analysis revealed that confidence was a strong positive\nmediator, while hostile and anxious emotions negatively impacted trust.\nHowever, lonely emotions did not significantly mediate the relationship between\nAV performance and trust. The results show that real-time AV behavior is more\ninfluential on trust than pre-existing risk perceptions, indicating trust in\nAVs might be more experience-based than shaped by prior beliefs.

In this paper, we aim to\nestimate the SN rates in the local universe and fit the delay-time distribution\nof SNe Ia to put constraints on their progenitor scenarios. Methods.We\nperformed a Monte-Carlo simulation to estimate the volumetric rates with the\nnearby SN sample introduced in Paper I of the series. The rate evolution of\ncore-collapse SNe well traces the evolution of cosmic star formation history;\nwhile that of SNe Ia involves the convolution of cosmic star-formation history\nand a two-component delay-time distribution including a power law and a\nGaussian component. Results.The volumetric rates of type Ia, Ibc and II SNe are\nderived as $0.325\\pm0.040^{+0.016}_{-0.010}$,\n$0.160\\pm0.028^{+0.044}_{-0.014}$, and $0.528\\pm0.051^{+0.162}_{-0.013}$ (in\nunit of $10^{-4} yr^{-1} Mpc^{-3} h^3_{70}$), respectively. The rate of CCSNe\nis consistent with previous estimates. The newly derived local SN Ia rate is\nlarger than existing results given at redshifts 0.01 < z < 0.1, favoring an\nincreased rate from the universe at z ~ 0.1 to the local universe. A\ntwo-component model can well fit the rate variation, with the power law\ncomponent accounting for the rate evolution at larger redshifts and the\nGaussian component with a delay time of 12.63$\\pm$0.38 Gyr accounting for the\nlocal rate evolution. This delayed component with such a longer delay time\nsuggests that the progenitors of these SNe Ia were formed at around 1 Gyr after\nthe birth of the universe, which could only be explained by a double-degenerate\nprogenitor scenario. This is evidenced by the comparison with the PTF sample of\nSNe Ia at z = 0.073, which reveals that the increase in SN Ia rate at z < 0.01\nis primarily due to the SNe Ia of massive E and S0 galaxies with old stellar\npopulations.",

    "abstract": "Active Learning (AL) aims to reduce annotation costs by strategically\nselecting the most informative samples for labeling. However, most active\nlearning methods struggle in the low-budget regime where only a few labeled\nexamples are available. This issue becomes even more pronounced when annotators\nprovide noisy labels. A common AL approach for the low- and mid-budget regimes\nfocuses on maximizing the coverage of the labeled set across the entire\ndataset. We propose a novel framework called Noise-Aware Active Sampling (NAS)\nthat extends existing greedy, coverage-based active learning strategies to\nhandle noisy annotations. NAS identifies regions that remain uncovered due to\nthe selection of noisy representatives and enables resampling from these areas.\nWe introduce a simple yet effective noise filtering approach suitable for the\nlow-budget regime, which leverages the inner mechanism of NAS and can be\napplied for noise filtering before model training. On multiple computer vision\nbenchmarks, including CIFAR100 and ImageNet subsets, NAS significantly improves\nperformance for standard active learning methods across different noise types\nand rates.",

    "abstract": "Contextual multi-armed bandits are a popular choice to model sequential\ndecision-making. E.g., in a healthcare application we may perform various tests\nto asses a patient condition (exploration) and then decide on the best\ntreatment to give (exploitation). When humans design strategies, they aim for\nthe exploration to be fast, since the patient's health is at stake, and easy to\ninterpret for a physician overseeing the process. However, common bandit\nalgorithms are nothing like that: The regret caused by exploration scales with\n$\\sqrt{H}$ over $H$ rounds and decision strategies are based on opaque\nstatistical considerations. In this paper, we use an original classification\nview to meta learn interpretable and fast exploration plans for a fixed\ncollection of bandits $\\mathbb{M}$.

In such systems, the companion's stellar wind is strongly\naffected by ionisation from X-rays emitted by the compact object. A smooth,\nisotropic stellar wind model cannot account for the observed orbital variation\nin absorption column density. A stream-like photoionisation wake trailing the\nneutron star has been proposed to explain this variation. Aims. We investigated\nthe variability of the circumbinary environment at different intensity levels\nof the Vela X-1 and used a model similar to the above-mentioned stream-like\nphotoionisation wake to explain the asymmetric absorption column density\npresent in the source. Methods. The 2.0-20.0 keV MAXI/GSC spectrum was well\nmodelled with a Comptonised continuum absorbed by local and interstellar\nmaterial. Nearly 13 years of MAXI/GSC data was used to constrain the variations\nin absorption column density in Vela X-1 from orbital-phase and\nintensity-and-orbital-phase resolved spectroscopy. Results. The long-term light\ncurve of Vela X-1 shows orbit-to-orbit intensity level variations without any\napparent super-orbital periodicity. The orbital-phase resolved spectroscopy in\nmultiple intensity levels reveals asymmetric variation in absorption column\ndensity changes across the intensity levels. Conclusions. We confirm that the\norbital variation in absorption column density in Vela X-1 cannot be explained\nby a smooth stellar wind alone using long-term MAXI/GSC data. An additional\ncomponent, such as a photoionisation or accretion wake, is required. The wake\nstructure is present across intensity levels, with geometry varying by\nintensity. The long-term MAXI/GSC data enabled us to vary wake parameters and\nderive best-fit stellar wind parameters for the time-averaged intensity,\nreproducing observed absorption column density across intensity levels.\n(Abbreviated.)",

We\nassemble a dataset of publicly available diffuse emission maps at frequencies\nbetween 45 MHz and 408 MHz, along with absolute temperature data from the EDGES\nradiometer between 40 and 200 MHz. We use nested sampling to perform a joint\nBayesian analysis of these two datasets and determine posterior distributions\nof: spatially resolved diffuse components, spectral parameters for the diffuse\nemission, and calibration corrections for each observed map. Using Bayesian\nmodel comparison, we find that the low-frequency sky is optimally modelled by\ntwo emission components, each following a curved power-law spectrum. The\nspectrum for the first component has a spectral index of beta_1 = -2.633\nplus/minus 0.002 and a curvature of gamma_1 = 0.014 plus/minus 0.001, while the\nsecond has beta_2 = -2.108 plus/minus 0.008 and gamma_2 = -0.424 plus/minus\n0.008. The diffuse maps require temperature-scale corrections of 1% to 29%, and\nzero-level adjustments of a few kelvin to a few hundred kelvin. We find that\nthe Haslam 408 MHz map is well calibrated, requiring a scale correction of\n1.029 plus/minus 0.003 (about 3%) and a zero-level correction of 0.91\nplus/minus 0.05 kelvin. Posterior predictions for the sky's absolute\ntemperature are in excellent agreement with EDGES data, indicating accurate\ncalibration. The posterior sky predictions agree with observations within\nstatistical uncertainty across all frequencies.

The X-ray spectra corresponding to all\nobjects are well-fitted with a power-law spectral model, and a strong\n\"brighter-when-redder\" trend is seen, which is the properties mostly seen in\nBlazars.

    "abstract": "Humans develop certain cognitive abilities to recognize objects and their\ntransformations without explicit supervision, highlighting the importance of\nunsupervised representation learning. A fundamental challenge in unsupervised\nrepresentation learning is to separate different transformations in learned\nfeature representations. Although algebraic approaches have been explored, a\ncomprehensive theoretical framework remains underdeveloped. Existing methods\ndecompose transformations based on algebraic independence, but these methods\nprimarily focus on commutative transformations and do not extend to cases where\ntransformations are conditionally independent but noncommutative. To extend\ncurrent representation learning frameworks, we draw inspiration from Galois\ntheory, where the decomposition of groups through normal subgroups provides an\napproach for the analysis of structured transformations. Normal subgroups\nnaturally extend commutativity under certain conditions and offer a foundation\nfor the categorization of transformations, even when they do not commute. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages normal subgroups to\nenable the separation of conditionally independent transformations, even in the\nabsence of commutativity. Through experiments on geometric transformations in\nimages, we show that our method successfully categorizes conditionally\nindependent transformations, such as rotation and translation, in an\nunsupervised manner, suggesting a close link between group decomposition via\nnormal subgroups and transformation categorization in representation learning.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we have presented a method for identifying missing items known\nas gaps in the student answers by comparing them against the corresponding\nmodel answer/reference answers, automatically. The gaps can be identified at\nword, phrase or sentence level. The identified gaps are useful in providing\nfeedback to the students for formative assessment. The problem of gap\nidentification has been modelled as an alignment of a pair of directed graphs\nrepresenting a student answer and the corresponding model answer for a given\nquestion. To validate the proposed approach, the gap annotated student answers\nconsidering answers from three widely known datasets in the short answer\ngrading domain, namely, University of North Texas (UNT), SciEntsBank, and\nBeetle have been developed and this gap annotated student answers' dataset is\navailable at: https://github.com/sahuarchana7/gaps-answers-dataset. Evaluation\nmetrics used in the traditional machine learning tasks have been adopted to\nevaluate the task of gap identification. Though performance of the proposed\napproach varies across the datasets and the types of the answers, overall the\nperformance is observed to be promising.",

    "abstract": "Long video understanding has emerged as an increasingly important yet\nchallenging task in computer vision. Agent-based approaches are gaining\npopularity for processing long videos, as they can handle extended sequences\nand integrate various tools to capture fine-grained information. However,\nexisting methods still face several challenges: (1) they often rely solely on\nthe reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) without dedicated\nmechanisms to enhance reasoning in long video scenarios; and (2) they remain\nvulnerable to errors or noise from external tools. To address these issues, we\npropose a specialized chain-of-thought (CoT) process tailored for long video\nanalysis. Our proposed CoT with plan-adjust mode enables the LLM to\nincrementally plan and adapt its information-gathering strategy. We further\nincorporate heuristic uncertainty estimation of both the LLM and external tools\nto guide the CoT process. This allows the LLM to assess the reliability of\nnewly collected information, refine its collection strategy, and make more\nrobust decisions when synthesizing final answers. Empirical experiments show\nthat our uncertainty-aware CoT effectively mitigates noise from external tools,\nleading to more reliable outputs. We implement our approach in a system called\nVideoAgent2, which also includes additional modules such as general context\nacquisition and specialized tool design. Evaluation on three dedicated long\nvideo benchmarks (and their subsets) demonstrates that VideoAgent2 outperforms\nthe previous state-of-the-art agent-based method, VideoAgent, by an average of\n13.1% and achieves leading performance among all zero-shot approaches",

Recently, some CLIP-based algorithms have been developed to alleviate\nthis interference by adjusting the weights of visual classifiers. However, our\nanalysis of this class-wise prompt engineering suffers from two shortcomings\nfor DG FAS: (1) The categories of facial categories, such as real or spoof,\nhave no semantics for the CLIP model, making it difficult to learn accurate\ncategory descriptions. (2) A single form of prompt cannot portray the various\ntypes of spoofing. In this work, instead of class-wise prompts, we propose a\nnovel Content-aware Composite Prompt Engineering (CCPE) that generates\ninstance-wise composite prompts, including both fixed template and learnable\nprompts. Specifically, our CCPE constructs content-aware prompts from two\nbranches: (1) Inherent content prompt explicitly benefits from abundant\ntransferred knowledge from the instruction-based Large Language Model (LLM).\n(2) Learnable content prompts implicitly extract the most informative visual\ncontent via Q-Former. Moreover, we design a Cross-Modal Guidance Module (CGM)\nthat dynamically adjusts unimodal features for fusion to achieve better\ngeneralized FAS.

Our framework\nsupports multiple lattices (D2Q9, D2Q13, D2Q21, D2Q37, D3Q27, etc) tailored to\nvarious flow conditions. It includes collision models with polynomial and\nnumerical equilibria, a second distribution for polyatomic behavior, a\nJameson-like shock sensor, and generalizes Rohde's refinement strategy.\n  The framework's accuracy and robustness is validated across diverse\nbenchmarks, including lid-driven cavity flows, Aeolian noise, 30P30N airfoil\naerodynamics, inviscid Riemann problems, and viscous flows past a NACA airfoil\nin transonic and supersonic regimes. Modern C++ further enables our framework\nto reach GPU-native performance, while ensuring high portability, modularity,\nand ease of implementation. Notably, weakly compressible LBMs achieve\nstate-of-the-art GPU efficiency on non-uniform grids, while fully compressible\nLBMs benefit from acceleration equivalent to thousands of CPU cores in the most\ncompute-intensive cases.

In entanglement coupled cluster\ntheory, many of the attractive features of the spin-adapted closed-shell\ncoupled cluster is retained: an unambiguous definition of the cluster operator\nand a terminating Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion. The result is a\nspin-adapted coupled cluster theory for open-shell species. The model produces\nexcitation energies of a quality comparable to the closed-shell counterpart.\nAdditionally, some ionized states that cannot be modeled accurately with the\nalternative equation-of-motion approach for ionized states, can be described\nwith the entanglement coupled cluster singles and doubles model.",

These conditions\nadversely affect model training and performance, leading to segmentation\nboundaries which deviate from the true ROIs. Traditional loss functions, such\nas Binary Cross Entropy, replicate annotation biases and limit model\ngeneralization. We propose a novel, statistically driven, conditionally\nadaptive loss function (CALF) tailored to accommodate the conditions of\nimbalanced datasets in DL training.

Two key processes in multimodal recommendations\nare modality fusion and representation learning. Previous approaches in\nmodality fusion often employ simplistic attentive or pre-defined strategies at\nearly or late stages, failing to effectively handle irrelevant information\namong modalities. In representation learning, prior research has constructed\nheterogeneous and homogeneous graph structures encapsulating user-item,\nuser-user, and item-item relationships to better capture user interests and\nitem profiles. Modality fusion and representation learning were considered as\ntwo independent processes in previous work. In this paper, we reveal that these\ntwo processes are complementary and can support each other. Specifically,\npowerful representation learning enhances modality fusion, while effective\nfusion improves representation quality. Stemming from these two processes, we\nintroduce a COmposite grapH convolutional nEtwork with dual-stage fuSION for\nthe multimodal recommendation, named COHESION. Specifically, it introduces a\ndual-stage fusion strategy to reduce the impact of irrelevant information,\nrefining all modalities using ID embedding in the early stage and fusing their\nrepresentations at the late stage. It also proposes a composite graph\nconvolutional network that utilizes user-item, user-user, and item-item graphs\nto extract heterogeneous and homogeneous latent relationships within users and\nitems. Besides, it introduces a novel adaptive optimization to ensure balanced\nand reasonable representations across modalities.

The process of constructing perturbed views of the\nuser-item bipartite graph and performing contrastive learning between perturbed\nviews in a graph convolutional network (GCN) is called graph contrastive\nlearning (GCL), which aims to enhance the robustness of representation\nlearning. Although existing GCL-based models are effective, the weight\nassignment method for perturbed views has not been fully explored. A critical\nproblem in existing GCL-based models is the irrational allocation of feature\nattention. This problem limits the model's ability to effectively leverage\ncrucial features, resulting in suboptimal performance. To address this, we\npropose a Weighted Graph Contrastive Learning framework (WeightedGCL).\nSpecifically, WeightedGCL applies a robust perturbation strategy, which\nperturbs only the view of the final GCN layer. In addition, WeightedGCL\nincorporates a squeeze and excitation network (SENet) to dynamically weight the\nfeatures of the perturbed views. Our WeightedGCL strengthens the model's focus\non crucial features and reduces the impact of less relevant information.\nExtensive experiments on widely used datasets demonstrate that our WeightedGCL\nachieves significant accuracy improvements compared to competitive baselines.",

The knowledge of the magnetic field structure in host stars is\nindispensable for our understanding of the magnetospheric interaction between\nthe central stars, the circumstellar (CS) environment, and planetary\ncompanions. We intend to study the geometry of the magnetic field of HD169142.\nWe measured the mean longitudinal magnetic field from high resolution ESPaDOnS\nand HARPSpol spectra of HD169142 using the Least Square Deconvolution\ntechnique. Additionally, the spectral variability of hydrogen lines is studied\nusing dynamical spectra.\n  Our analysis of the Stokes V spectra reveals the presence of definitely\ndetected narrow Zeeman features observed using line masks with neutral iron\nlines. On two observing epochs, we also obtain marginally detected broad Zeeman\nfeatures. To explain the simultaneous appearance of narrow and broad Zeeman\nfeatures, we discuss different scenarios, including one scenario related to a\nnon-photospheric origin of the narrow Zeeman features due to magnetospheric\ninteraction with warm CS matter. In an environment such as a wind or an\naccretion disk, spectral lines may form over a relatively large volume, and the\nfield topology may therefore be complex not only in latitude and azimuth, but\nin radius as well. Dynamical plots of the Hbeta line show an intriguing very\ncomplex structure with appearing and disappearing absorption features, which\ncan be related to the complex morphology of the CS matter with asymmetric dust\nclump structures. The profiles of spectral lines belonging to different\nelements are variable, indicating the presence of chemical spots.",

In this context, reinforcement learning (RL) and\nmulti-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms emerge as promising\nsolutions. However, the urgency and importance of the problem are clear, as\nexisting RL/MARL-based routing approaches lack effective communication in run\ntime among routers, making it challenging for individual routers to adapt to\ncomplex and dynamic changing networks. More importantly, they lack the ability\nto deal with dynamically changing network topology, especially the addition of\nthe router, due to the non-scalability of their neural networks.

Through emergent\ncommunication, routers could learn how to communicate effectively to maximize\nthe optimization objectives. Meanwhile, a new Q-network and graph-based\nemergent communication are introduced to dynamically adapt to the changing\nnetwork topology without retraining while ensuring robust performance.\nExperimental results showcase DRAMA's superior performance over the traditional\nrouting algorithm and other RL/MARL-based algorithms, achieving a higher\ndelivery rate and lower latency in diverse network scenarios, including dynamic\nnetwork load and topology.

Initially, to\nenhance error distinction, ZeroED generates rich data representations using\nerror reason-aware binary features, pre-trained embeddings, and statistical\nfeatures. Then, ZeroED employs LLM to label errors holistically through\nin-context learning, guided by a two-step reasoning process for detailed error\ndetection guidelines. To reduce token costs, LLMs are applied only to\nrepresentative data selected via clustering-based sampling. High-quality\ntraining data is constructed through in-cluster label propagation and LLM\naugmentation with verification. Finally, a classifier is trained to detect all\nerrors.

We study how the\ngeometry of this structure is modified by a nontrivial band geometry, via a\ncalculation of the zero sound spectrum of a Dirac cone in two dimensions.

The compute continuum integrates\nedge and cloud resources to meet this need, balancing the low-latency demands\nof the edge with the high computational power of the cloud. However, managing\nresources in such a distributed environment presents challenges due to the\ndiversity and complexity of these systems.

The strategy of adopting distinct approaches to learn from\nhomophilic and heterophilic components in node-level tasks has been widely\ndiscussed and proven effective both theoretically and experimentally. However,\nin graph-level tasks, research on this topic remains notably scarce.

We further discover\nthe potential of PCT as tree-based planners in deliberately solving packing\nproblems of industrial significance, including large-scale packing and\ndifferent variations of BPP setting. A recursive packing method is proposed to\ndecompose large-scale packing into smaller sub-trees while a spatial ensemble\nmechanism integrates local solutions into global. For different BPP variations\nwith additional decision variables, such as lookahead, buffering, and offline\npacking, we propose a unified planning framework enabling out-of-the-box\nproblem solving. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method outperforms\nexisting online BPP baselines and is versatile in incorporating various\npractical constraints. The planning process excels across large-scale problems\nand diverse problem variations. We develop a real-world packing robot for\nindustrial warehousing, with careful designs accounting for constrained\nplacement and transportation stability. Our packing robot operates reliably and\nefficiently on unprotected pallets at 10 seconds per box. It achieves averagely\n19 boxes per pallet with 57.4% space utilization for relatively large-size\nboxes.",

Accurate and efficient scenario\ndata search is critical for both online vehicle decision-making and planning,\nand offline scenario generation and simulations, as it allows for leveraging\nthe scenario experiences to improve the overall performance. Especially with\nthe application of large language models (LLMs) and\nRetrieval-Augmented-Generation (RAG) systems in autonomous driving, urgent\nrequirements are put forward. In this paper, we introduce the Driving-RAG\nframework to address the challenges of efficient scenario data embedding,\nsearch, and applications for RAG systems. Our embedding model aligns\nfundamental scenario information and scenario distance metrics in the vector\nspace. The typical scenario sampling method combined with hierarchical\nnavigable small world can perform efficient scenario vector search to achieve\nhigh efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. In addition, the reorganization\nmechanism by graph knowledge enhances the relevance to the prompt scenarios and\naugment LLM generation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\nframework on typical trajectory planning task for complex interactive scenarios\nsuch as ramps and intersections, showcasing its advantages for RAG\napplications.",

Translating DESI BAO constraints\ninto flat $\\Lambda$CDM constraints, we observe that the LRG1 constraint remains\nthe most prominent outlier, a distinction now held jointly with ELG1, LRG2\nswitches from smaller to larger $\\Omega_m$ values relative to\nPlanck-$\\Lambda$CDM, and ELG data drive the relatively low $\\Omega_m$ in the\nfull DR2 BAO. We observe that one cannot restore $w_0 = -1$ within one $1\n\\sigma$ by removing either LRG1 or ELG1 or LRG2, but LRG2 in DR2, in contrast\nto LRG1 in DR1, now has the greatest bearing on $w_0 > -1$.

The model assumes that oscillators can\nsynchronize their dynamics, using concepts inherited from the Kuramoto model,\nwhich effectively accounts for the discrete state effects observed in Buslaev\nnets. The governing equation for oscillator dynamics incorporates four key\nfactors: deceleration caused by conflicts with neighboring oscillators and the\nsynchronization process, which induces additional acceleration or deceleration.\nNumerical analysis shows that the system exhibits both familiar properties from\nclassic Buslaev nets, such as metastable synchronization, and novel behaviors,\nincluding phase transitions as the interaction sector size changes.",

We\npresent MASS (MoErging through Adaptive Subspace Selection), a new approach\nthat closes this gap by unifying multiple fine-tuned models while retaining\nnear state-of-the-art performance across tasks. Building on the low-rank\ndecomposition of per-task updates, MASS stores only the most salient singular\ncomponents for each task and merges them into a shared model. At inference\ntime, a non-parametric, data-free router identifies which subspace (or\ncombination thereof) best explains an input's intermediate features and\nactivates the corresponding task-specific block. This procedure is fully\ntraining-free and introduces only a two-pass inference overhead plus a ~2\nstorage factor compared to a single pretrained model, irrespective of the\nnumber of tasks. We evaluate MASS on CLIP-based image classification using\nViT-B-16, ViT-B-32 and ViT-L-14 for benchmarks of 8, 14 and 20 tasks\nrespectively, establishing a new state-of-the-art.

However, due to the diversity and\ngenerativity of information in real-time GenAI, it may be incompatible to\ndirectly use existing information aging metrics to assess its timeliness. In\nthis article, we introduce a new concept called Age of Generative Information\n(AoGI) to evaluate the freshness of generative information, which takes into\naccount the information delay caused not only by sampling and transmission, but\nalso by computation. Furthermore, since real-time GenAI services are often\nsupported by mobile-edge-cloud (MEC) collaborative computing in 6G networks and\nsome of the generated information is privacy sensitive, it is recommended that\nthe identities of edge and cloud should always be verified in a zero-trust\nmanner. We introduce the concept of Age of Trust (AoT) to characterise the\ndecay process of their trust level. We also discuss the optimisations of these\nevolved information aging metrics, focusing on the impact of dynamic external\nconditions, including wireless environments and limited computational\nresources.

While previous research has focused\non point-like vortices in two dimensions and line-like vortices in three\ndimensions, quantum vortices in four spatial dimensions are expected to take\nthe form of extended vortex surfaces, thereby fundamentally enriching dynamics.\nHere, we conduct a comprehensive numerical study of 4D quantum vortices and\nturbulence. Using a special visualization method, we discovered the decay of\ntopological numbers that does not exist in low dimensions, as well as the\nhigh-dimensional counterpart of the vortex reconnection process.

The system integrates regular bus services, offering full-line\nor sectional coverage, and short-turning services. Considering the\nfast-charging technology with quick top-ups, we jointly optimize charging\nstation locations and capacities, fleet sizing, as well as routing-scheduling\nfor E-MAUs under demand uncertainty. E-MAUs can couple flexibly at different\nlocations, and their routing-scheduling decisions include sequences of\nservices, as well as charging times and locations. Methodology: The E-RCRSP is\nformulated as a path-based robust optimization model, incorporating the\npolyhedral uncertainty set. We develop a double-decomposition algorithm that\ncombines column-and-constraint generation and column generation armed with a\ntailored label-correcting approach. To improve computational efficiency and\nscalability, we propose a novel method that introduces super travel arcs and\nnetwork downsizing methodologies. Results: Computational results from real-life\ninstances, based on operational data of advanced NExT E-MAUs with cutting-edge\nbatteries provided by our industry partner, indicate that charging at both\ndepots and en-route fast-charging stations is necessary during operations.\nMoreover, our algorithm effectively scales to large-scale operational cases\ninvolving entire-day operations, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art\nmethods. Comparisons with fixed-composition buses under the same fleet\ninvestment suggest that our methods are able to achieve substantial reductions\nin passengers' costs by flexibly scheduling units.",

    "abstract": "Recently, generative recommendation has emerged as a promising paradigm,\nattracting significant research attention. The basic framework involves an item\ntokenizer, which represents each item as a sequence of codes serving as its\nidentifier, and a generative recommender that predicts the next item by\nautoregressively generating the target item identifier. However, in existing\nmethods, both the tokenizer and the recommender are typically domain-specific,\nlimiting their ability for effective transfer or adaptation to new domains. To\nthis end, we propose UTGRec, a Universal item Tokenization approach for\ntransferable Generative Recommendation. Specifically, we design a universal\nitem tokenizer for encoding rich item semantics by adapting a multimodal large\nlanguage model (MLLM). By devising tree-structured codebooks, we discretize\ncontent representations into corresponding codes for item tokenization. To\neffectively learn the universal item tokenizer on multiple domains, we\nintroduce two key techniques in our approach. For raw content reconstruction,\nwe employ dual lightweight decoders to reconstruct item text and images from\ndiscrete representations to capture general knowledge embedded in the content.\nFor collaborative knowledge integration, we assume that co-occurring items are\nsimilar and integrate collaborative signals through co-occurrence alignment and\nreconstruction. Finally, we present a joint learning framework to pre-train and\nadapt the transferable generative recommender across multiple domains.\nExtensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate the superiority of\nUTGRec compared to both traditional and generative recommendation baselines.",

OffRAC enables direct calls to\nFPGA-based accelerators without host involvement. Utilizing the stateless\nfunction abstraction of serverless computing, with applications decomposed into\nsimpler stateless functions, offloading promotes efficient acceleration and\ndistribution of computational loads across the network.

This\ndesign minimizes the implementation complexity for accelerator users while\nensuring isolation and programmability. Results show that the OffRAC approach\nreduces the latency of network calls to accelerators down to approximately 10.5\nus, as well as sustaining high application throughput up to 85Gbps,\ndemonstrating scalability and efficiency, making it compelling for the next\ngeneration of low-latency applications.",

    "abstract": "Extensive research has shown that Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems\nare vulnerable to audio adversarial attacks. Current attacks mainly focus on\nsingle-source scenarios, ignoring dual-source scenarios where two people are\nspeaking simultaneously. To bridge the gap, we propose a Selective Masking\nAdversarial attack, namely SMA attack, which ensures that one audio source is\nselected for recognition while the other audio source is muted in dual-source\nscenarios. To better adapt to the dual-source scenario, our SMA attack\nconstructs the normal dual-source audio from the muted audio and selected\naudio. SMA attack initializes the adversarial perturbation with a small\nGaussian noise and iteratively optimizes it using a selective masking\noptimization algorithm. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the SMA attack\ncan generate effective and imperceptible audio adversarial examples in the\ndual-source scenario, achieving an average success rate of attack of 100% and\nsignal-to-noise ratio of 37.15dB on Conformer-CTC, outperforming the baselines.",

In this paper, we aim to construct a complete sample of SNe in the nearby\nuniverse and provide more precise measurement of subtype fractions. Methods.We\ncarefully selected our SN sample at a distance of < 40 Mpc mainly from\nwide-field surveys conducted over the years from 2016 to 2023. Results.The\nsample contains a total of 211 SNe, including 109 SNe II, 69 SNe Ia, and 33 SNe\nIbc. With the aid of sufficient spectra, we can obtain relatively accurate\nsubtype classifications for all SNe in this sample. After corrections for the\nMalmquist bias, this volume-limited sample gives fractions of SNe Ia, SNe Ibc,\nand SNe II as $30.4^{+3.7}_{-11.5}\\%$, $16.3^{+3.7}_{-7.4}\\%$, and\n$53.3^{+9.5}_{-18.7}\\%$, respectively.In the SN Ia sample, the fraction of the\n91T-like subtype becomes relatively low (~5.4\\%), while that of the 02cx-like\nsubtype shows a moderate increase (~6.8\\%). In the SN Ibc sample, we find\nsignificant fractions of broadlined SNe Ic (~18.0\\%) and SNe Ibn (~8.8\\%). The\nfraction of 87A-like subtype is determined as ~2.3\\% for the first time,\nindicating rare explosions from blue supergiant stars. We find that SNe Ia show\na double peak number distribution in S0- and Sc-type host galaxies, which may\nserve as a straightforward evidence for the presence of \"prompt\" and \"delayed\"\nprogenitor components giving rise to SN Ia explosions. Several subtypes of SNe\nsuch as 02cx-like SNe Ia, broadlined SNe Ic, SNe IIn (and perhaps SNe Ibn) are\nfound to occur preferentially in less massive spiral galaxies, favoring their\nassociations with young stellar progenitors. Moreover, the 02cx-like subtype\nshows a trend of exploding in the outer skirt of their hosts, suggestive of\nmetal-poor progenitors.",

    "abstract": "We present a low-energy effective theory to describe the\nlocalization-delocalization transition, which occurs for wave functions of\nelectrons and holes injected individually by a voltage pulse with noninteger\nflux quantum. We find that the transition can be described by an effective\nscattering matrix in a truncated low-energy space, which is composed of two\nparts. The first part describes the infrared-divergence of the scattering\nmatrix, while the second part represents the high-energy correlation. For\nshort-tailed pulses which decay faster than Lorentzian, the scattering matrix\nexhibits solely an inverse linear divergence in the infrared limit. The\ndivergence is responsible for the dynamical orthogonality catastrophe, which\nleads to electron-hole pairs with delocalized wave functions. In contrast, the\nhigh-energy correlation can be approximated by a constant term, which leads to\nelectron-hole pairs with localized wave functions. Due to the competition\nbetween the two terms, the wave functions can undergo a\nlocalization-delocalization transition, which occurs for electrons and holes\ninjected individually by the voltage pulse. As a consequence, the\nlocalization-delocalization transitions for all short-tailed pulses can be\ndescribed by the same effective scattering matrix, suggesting that they belong\nto the same universality class. For pulses with longer tails, the scattering\nmatrix can exhibit additional infrared-divergences. We show that a Lorentzian\npulse gives rise to a logarithmic divergence, while a fractional-powered\nLorentzian pulse gives rise to a power-law divergence. The additional\ndivergence can lead to localization-delocalization transitions belonging to\ndifferent universality classes. These results demonstrate the fine-tuning\ncapabilities of the localization-delocalization transition in time-dependent\nquantum transport.",

    "abstract": "A scenario frequently encountered in real-world complex systems is the\ntemporary failure of a few components. For systems whose functionality hinges\non the collective dynamics of the interacting components, a viable approach to\ndealing with the failures is replacing the malfunctioning components with their\nbackups, so that the collective dynamics of the systems can be precisely\nmaintained for a duration long enough to resolve the problem. Here, taking the\nparadigmatic Kuramoto model as an example and considering the scenario of\noscillator failures, we propose substituting the failed oscillators with\ndigital twins trained by the data measured from the system evolution.\nSpecifically, leveraging the technique of adaptable reservoir computer (RC) in\nmachine learning, we demonstrate that a single, small-size RC is able to\nsubstitute any oscillator in the Kuramoto model such that the time evolution of\nthe synchronization order parameter of the repaired system is identical to that\nof the original system for a certain time period. The performance of adaptable\nRC is evaluated in various contexts, and it is found that the sustaining period\nis influenced by multiple factors, including the size of the training dataset,\nthe overall coupling strength of the system, and the number of substituted\noscillators. Additionally, though the synchronization order parameter diverges\nfrom the ground truth in the long-term running, the functional networks of the\noscillators are still faithfully sustained by the machine substitutions.",

Using the GLEAM\nsurvey data, we identified a sample of 4,315 sources with peak frequencies\napproximately between 72--3000 MHz, most of which are MHz-peaked-spectrum\nsources (MPS). Our analysis shows that instead of SSA, the FFA is the dominant\nmechanism in producing the spectral turnover for most of the sources in this\nsample. The index of the optically thick spectrum alpha_thick has a lower\nboundary due to the FFA, and the steeper alpha_thick indicates a complex\nmulti-absorption mechanism. In particular, the external FFA produces\nsubstantial alpha_thick, which exhibits a weak correlation with the peak\nfrequency. Future ultra-long wavelength observations would also provide data on\nthe spectrum of these sources at even lower frequencies. Determining the\nabsorption mechanism that shaped the spectrum of these sources would be a\ncrucial part of understanding their nature.",

A notable approach\nwithin this trend is not to fine-tune these models directly but instead to\nleverage In-Context Learning (ICL) methods tailored for LLMRec, denoted as\nLLM-ICL Rec. Many contemporary techniques focus on harnessing ICL content to\nenhance LLMRec performance.\n  However, optimizing LLMRec with ICL content presents unresolved challenges.\nSpecifically, two key issues stand out: (1) the limited understanding of why\nusing a few demonstrations without model fine-tuning can lead to better\nperformance compared to zero-shot recommendations. (2) the lack of evaluation\nmetrics for demonstrations in LLM-ICL Rec and the absence of the theoretical\nanalysis and practical design for optimizing the generation of ICL content for\nrecommendation contexts.\n  To address these two main issues, we propose a theoretical model, the LLM-ICL\nRecommendation Equivalent Gradient Descent model (LRGD) in this paper, which\nconnects recommendation generation with gradient descent dynamics. We\ndemonstrate that the ICL inference process in LLM aligns with the training\nprocedure of its dual model, producing token predictions equivalent to the dual\nmodel's testing outputs. Building on these theoretical insights, we propose an\nevaluation metric for assessing demonstration quality. We integrate\nperturbations and regularizations in LRGD to enhance the robustness of the\nrecommender system. To further improve demonstration effectiveness, prevent\nperformance collapse, and ensure long-term adaptability, we also propose a\ntwo-stage optimization process in practice.

Supervised fine-tuning on such reasoning\ntraces, also known as distillation, can be a cost-effective way to boost\nreasoning capabilities of student models. However, empirical observations\nreveal that these reasoning trajectories are often suboptimal, switching\nexcessively between different lines of thought, resulting in under-thinking,\nover-thinking, and even degenerate responses. We introduce Retro-Search, an\nMCTS-inspired search algorithm, for distilling higher quality reasoning paths\nfrom large reasoning models. Retro-Search retrospectively revises reasoning\npaths to discover better, yet shorter traces, which can then lead to student\nmodels with enhanced reasoning capabilities with shorter, thus faster\ninference. Our approach can enable two use cases: self-improvement, where\nmodels are fine-tuned on their own Retro-Search-ed thought traces, and\nweak-to-strong improvement, where a weaker model revises stronger model's\nthought traces via Retro-Search. For self-improving, R1-distill-7B, fine-tuned\non its own Retro-Search-ed traces, reduces the average reasoning length by\n31.2% while improving performance by 7.7% across seven math benchmarks.

This physicochemical transport provides an\nefficient alternative in numerous microscale applications where\nadvection-induced transport is infeasible. Phoretic withdrawal and injection in\ndead-end pores can be controlled by orienting salt gradients into or out of the\npore; however, the extent to which this orientation influences spatiotemporal\ntransport patterns is not thoroughly explored. In this study, we find that it\nhas a significant influence: colloidal withdrawal in solute-out mode\n($\\beta=c_\\infty/c_{\\text{pore}}<1$) is faster and shallower, whereas the\nsolute-in mode enables deeper withdrawal. Similarly, solute-out injection\nfeatures rapidly propagating wavefronts, whereas the solute-in mode ($\\beta\n>1$) promotes uniform and gradual injection. Each mode's transport is found to\nevolve and persist over different time scales. We characterize the performance\nof these modes and find that while persistence of the solute-out mode\nstrengthens with a growing electrolytic gradient [$\\sim \\ln(\\beta^{-0.4})$],\nsolute-in mode diminishes and eventually its persistence is insensitive to\n$\\beta$. We also incorporate the variable mobility model to examine the impact\nof large zeta potentials, which intensifies the transport of solute-out mode\nfurther and weakens the solute-in mode. Additionally, we investigate how\nosmotic flows of the two modes affect injection and withdrawal patterns. We\nfind that osmosis-induced mixing can counterintuitively inhibit injection\neffectiveness in solute-out mode. These insights bring attention to the\ndistinctions between different phoretic transport modes and contribute to the\nrational design and setup of electrolytic gradients in numerous microscale\napplications.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in post-development tasks\nsuch as code repair and testing. A key factor in these tasks' success is the\nmodel's deep understanding of code. However, the extent to which LLMs truly\nunderstand code remains largely unevaluated. Quantifying code comprehension is\nchallenging due to its abstract nature and the lack of a standardized metric.\nPreviously, this was assessed through developer surveys, which are not feasible\nfor evaluating LLMs. Existing LLM benchmarks focus primarily on code\ngeneration, fundamentally different from code comprehension. Additionally,\nfixed benchmarks quickly become obsolete as they become part of the training\ndata. This paper presents the first large-scale empirical investigation into\nLLMs' ability to understand code. Inspired by mutation testing, we use an LLM's\nfault-finding ability as a proxy for its deep code understanding. This approach\nis based on the insight that a model capable of identifying subtle functional\ndiscrepancies must understand the code well. We inject faults in real-world\nprograms and ask the LLM to localize them, ensuring the specifications suffice\nfor fault localization. Next, we apply semantic-preserving code mutations\n(SPMs) to the faulty programs and test whether the LLMs still locate the\nfaults, verifying their confidence in code understanding. We evaluate nine\npopular LLMs on 600,010 debugging tasks from 670 Java and 637 Python programs.\nWe find that LLMs lose the ability to debug the same bug in 78% of faulty\nprograms when SPMs are applied, indicating a shallow understanding of code and\nreliance on features irrelevant to semantics. We also find that LLMs understand\ncode earlier in the program better than later. This suggests that LLMs' code\ncomprehension remains tied to lexical and syntactic features due to\ntokenization designed for natural languages, which overlooks code semantics.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) framework that\nperforms top-down recursive planning via learned subgoals, successfully applied\nto the complex combinatorial puzzle game Sokoban. Our approach constructs a\nsix-level policy hierarchy, where each higher-level policy generates subgoals\nfor the level below. All subgoals and policies are learned end-to-end from\nscratch, without any domain knowledge. Our results show that the agent can\ngenerate long action sequences from a single high-level call. While prior work\nhas explored 2-3 level hierarchies and subgoal-based planning heuristics, we\ndemonstrate that deep recursive goal decomposition can emerge purely from\nlearning, and that such hierarchies can scale effectively to hard puzzle\ndomains.",

    "abstract": "The performance of large language models (LLMs) depends on how they are\nprompted, with choices spanning both the high-level prompting pattern (e.g.,\nZero-Shot, CoT, ReAct, ReWOO) and the specific prompt content (instructions and\nfew-shot demonstrations). Manually tuning this combination is tedious,\nerror-prone, and specific to a given LLM and task. Therefore, this paper\nproposes AutoPDL, an automated approach to discovering good LLM agent\nconfigurations. Our approach frames this as a structured AutoML problem over a\ncombinatorial space of agentic and non-agentic prompting patterns and\ndemonstrations, using successive halving to efficiently navigate this space. We\nintroduce a library implementing common prompting patterns using the PDL prompt\nprogramming language. AutoPDL solutions are human-readable, editable, and\nexecutable PDL programs that use this library. This approach also enables\nsource-to-source optimization, allowing human-in-the-loop refinement and reuse.\nEvaluations across three tasks and seven LLMs (ranging from 3B to 70B\nparameters) show consistent accuracy gains ($9.21\\pm15.46$ percentage points),\nup to 67.5pp, and reveal that selected prompting strategies vary across models\nand tasks.",

To get a high-resolution RRP, many methods\nhave been developed, such as multiple signal classification (MUSIC), orthogonal\nmatching pursuit (OMP), and a few deep learning-based approaches. Although they\nbreak through the Rayleigh resolution limit determined by radar signal\nbandwidth, these methods either get limited super-resolution capability or work\nwell just in high signal to noise ratio (SNR) scenarios. To overcome these\nlimitations, in this paper, an interpretable neural network for\nsuper-resolution RRP (DSSR-Net) is proposed by integrating the advantages of\nboth model-guided and data-driven models. Specifically, DSSR-Net is designed\nbased on a sparse representation model with dimension scaling, and then trained\non a training dataset. Through dimension scaling, DSSR-Net lifts the radar\nsignal into high-dimensional space to extract subtle features of closely spaced\nobjects and suppress the noise of the high-dimensional features. It improves\nthe super-resolving power of closely spaced objects and lowers the SNR\nrequirement of radar signals compared to existing methods. The superiority of\nthe proposed algorithm for super-resolution RRP reconstruction is verified via\nexperiments with both synthetic and measured data.",

In\nthis paper, we introduce Generalized Cox Proportional Hazards (GCPH) model, a\nnovel method for survival analysis that leverages KAN to enable a non-linear\nmapping from covariates to survival outcomes in a fully symbolic manner. GCPH\nmaintains the interpretability of traditional CPH models while allowing for the\nestimation of non-linear log-risk functions. Experiments conducted on both\nsynthetic data and various public benchmarks demonstrate that GCPH achieves\ncompetitive performance in terms of prediction accuracy and exhibits superior\ninterpretability compared to current state-of-the-art methods.",

The NinjaSat X-ray observatory promptly observed\nthe source from November 10 to 18 while the small angular separation from the\nSun hampered follow-up campaigns by other X-ray observatories. The MAXI and\nNinjaSat light curves in the 2-10 keV band showed first and second decaying\ncomponents at the early and late phases, approximated by exponential functions\nwith e-folding constants of 1.2 $\\pm$ 0.2 and 14.9 $\\pm$ 0.9 hours (1$\\sigma$\nerrors), respectively. A single blackbody model reproduces the X-ray spectrum\nwith a softening trend of its temperature decreasing from 1.8 $\\pm$ 0.1 keV to\n0.59 $\\pm$ 0.06 keV. Assuming the unknown source distance at 8 kpc, at which\nthe initial X-ray luminosity roughly corresponds to the Eddington limit, the\nshrinking blackbody radius was estimated at 5-11 km. This X-ray brightening is\ninterpreted as a superburst in a Galactic low-mass X-ray binary, which is\npowered by thermonuclear burning triggered presumably by carbon ignition close\nto the outer crust of the neutron star. The transition between two decaying\ncomponents occurred at 5.5-7.7 hours, corresponding to the thermal time scale\nof the burning layer. The ignition column density is estimated to be\n(2.8-5.1)$\\times 10^{12}$ g cm$^{-2}$.",

Under these disturbances and the independent time\nkept by the hardware clocks, our consensus-based controller enables all agents\nto steer their software-defined clocks into practical synchronization while\nachieving a common user-defined clock drift. Furthermore, we treat the drift of\neach hardware clock as an unknown parameter, which our algorithm can accurately\nestimate. The coupling of the agents is modeled by a connected, undirected, and\nstatic graph. However, each agent possesses a timer mechanism that determines\nwhen to broadcast a sample of its software time and update its own\nsoftware-time estimate. Hence, communication between agents can be directed,\nintermittent, and asynchronous. The closed-loop dynamics of the ensemble is\nmodeled using a hybrid system, where a Lyapunov-based stability analysis\ndemonstrates that a set encoding the time synchronization and clock drift\nestimation objectives is globally practically exponentially stable.

While\nrecent scaling laws have sought to understand how LLMs scale with respect to\nmodel size, pre-training data, and computational resources, we focus on\nunderstanding how model compression affects the performance of a pre-trained\nLLM on downstream tasks. We empirically examine the effects of structured model\ncompression on LLMs through over $1000$ experiments across eight models with\nsizes ranging from $0.5B$ to $14B$ parameters. Our findings indicate that the\ntest cross-entropy loss increases quadratically with the compression ratio,\nwhereas performance on downstream tasks declines only linearly. Our study\nemphasizes the importance of recovery fine-tuning in enhancing generation loss,\nshowing that the test loss of compressed LLMs can improve by up to 55% with\nrecovery fine-tuning. At higher compression ratios (up to 90%), compressed LLMs\ndemonstrate a speed increase of 60% during inference compared to their\nuncompressed counterparts, compensating for the performance degradation at this\nlevel. However, for smaller models ($\\le 7B$), the computational gains are\nlimited, peaking at just 35%.

These methods often assume perfect alignment\nbetween queries and target images, an idealized scenario rarely encountered in\npractice.

However, this design introduces information loss during inter-module\ncommunication, increases computational overhead, and can lead to compounding\nerrors. To address these challenges, recent works have proposed architectures\nthat integrate all components into an end-to-end differentiable model, enabling\nholistic system optimization. This shift emphasizes data engineering over\nsoftware integration, offering the potential to enhance system performance by\nsimply scaling up training resources. In this work, we evaluate the performance\nof a simple end-to-end driving architecture on internal driving datasets\nranging in size from 16 to 8192 hours with both open-loop metrics and\nclosed-loop simulations. Specifically, we investigate how much additional\ntraining data is needed to achieve a target performance gain, e.g., a 5%\nimprovement in motion prediction accuracy.

Finally,\nthe performance of these models was evaluated using the F1 score, 95\\%\nconfidence interval (CI) and paired-sample t-tests on our constructed dataset,\nwith the prediction results further assessed by radiologists. Using zero-shot\nprompting, the fine-tuned Llama-3-70B-Instruct model achieved the best\nperformance with the following F1 scores: 0.769 for negation errors, 0.772 for\nleft/right errors, 0.750 for interval change errors, 0.828 for transcription\nerrors, and 0.780 overall.

    "abstract": "The brain's bottom-up loop for processing speech influx involves both the\nselective attention and the encoding of specific speech information. Previous\nhuman studies have found that such attention can be represented by the cortical\ngamma-rhythm oscillations. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.\nTo address this issue, this paper proposes a neural network model that\nincorporates speech signal input, the cochlea, the thalamus, and a balanced\nexcitatory-inhibitory cortical neural network, with the aim of connecting real\nspeech signals to brain cortical responses. Using this model, we explored\nneural oscillation patterns in response to mixed speech stimuli and background\nnoise. The findings revealed that the peak of gamma oscillation decreased as\nthe frequency of the pure-tone stimuli diminished. This suggests a strong\ncorrelation and coding role of gamma oscillation peaks in auditory attention.\nSimilar results were confirmed by analyzing the rhythmic oscillations of EEG\ndata in response to pure-tone signals. Further results indicated that dynamic\ngamma oscillations are involved in the encoding capacity of continuous speech\ninput. The coding entropy of the dynamic series was found to be proportional to\nthe complexity of the content. This suggests that gamma oscillations play\nmultiple roles, not only in sustaining the bottom-up attentional state but also\nin potentially conveying specific information from external speech inputs.\nFinally, we found that enhancing the excitatory-inhibitory balance level\nproperly could improve auditory attention. This finding provides a potential\nendogenous explanation for the dynamic switching process of brain attention in\nprocessing auditory signals.",

Specifically, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is used to\ninvestigate the size effect on the melting and crystallization of Si\nnanoparticles during transportation in air. We found with the decrease in\nnanoparticle size, crystallization becomes rare, even with a low cooling rate.\nThe nucleation location of different particles is also analyzed and almost\nalways starts at a sub-surface location (below 5 {\\AA}). The atomic structure\nevolution during solidification is also monitored to provide guidance for LIFT\nprinting of Si. Our simulation results indicate that nano-confinement can lead\nto single-crystal structure formation, which may shed light on single-crystal\nadditive manufacturing.",

In both cases, we begin with labeled data from a source\ndomain and seek to generalize to a target domain where outcomes are not\nobserved. The key difference is that in causal inference, the labels --\npotential outcomes -- are selectively observed based on treatment assignment,\nintroducing bias that must be addressed through assumptions. This perspective\nreframes causal estimation as a familiar generalization problem and highlights\nhow techniques from predictive modeling, such as reweighting and domain\nadaptation, apply directly to causal tasks.

We use large language models\n(LLMs) to generate cluster names and evaluate their effectiveness through\nsemantic density, information theory, and clustering accuracy. Our results show\nthat Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) clustering on embeddings generated by a LLM,\nincreases semantic density compared to random assignment, effectively grouping\nsimilar bios. However, as clusters increase, interpretability declines, as\nmeasured by a generative LLM's ability to correctly assign bios based on\ncluster names. A logistic regression analysis confirms that classification\naccuracy depends on the semantic similarity between bios and their assigned\ncluster names, as well as their distinction from alternatives.\n  These findings reveal a \"Goldilocks zone\" where clusters remain distinct yet\ninterpretable.

Under mild conditions, we establish the\nexistence and uniqueness (up to scaling) of a global minimum, corresponding to\na unique WPGD solution. Finally, we translate these findings to explore the\noptimization landscape of GLA and shed light on how gating facilitates\ncontext-aware learning and when it is provably better than vanilla linear\nattention.",

    "abstract": "The recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have generated\nconsiderable interest in their utilization for sequential recommendation tasks.\nWhile collaborative signals from similar users are central to recommendation\nmodeling, effectively transforming these signals into a format that LLMs can\nunderstand and utilize remains challenging. The critical challenges include\nselecting relevant demonstrations from large-scale user interactions and\nensuring their alignment with LLMs' reasoning process. To address these\nchallenges, we introduce AdaptRec, a self-adaptive fram-ework that leverages\nLLMs for sequential recommendations by incorporating explicit collaborative\nsignals. AdaptRec employs a two-phase user selection mechanism -- User\nSimilarity Retrieval and Self-Adaptive User Selection -- to efficiently\nidentify relevant user sequences in large-scale datasets from multi-metric\nevaluation. We also develop a User-Based Similarity Retrieval Prompt, enabling\nthe model to actively select similar users and continuously refine its\nselection criteria during training. Using the collaborative signals from\nsimilar users, we construct a User-Contextualized Recommendation Prompt that\ntranslates their behavior sequences into natural language, explicitly\nintegrating this information into the recommendation process. Experiments\ndemonstrate AdaptRec's superior performance, with significant improvements in\nHitRatio@1 scores of 7.13\\%, 18.16\\%, and 10.41\\% across real-world datasets\nwith full fine-tuning, and even higher gains of 23.00\\%, 15.97\\%, and 17.98\\%\nin few-shot scenarios.",

    "abstract": "In 2012, Zilber used model-theoretic techniques to show that a curve of high\ngenus over an algebraically closed field is determined by its Jacobian (viewed\nonly as an abstract group with a distinguished subset for an image of the\ncurve). In this paper, we consider an analogous problem for arbitrary\n(semi)abelian varieties $A$ over algebraically closed fields $K$ with a\ndistinguished subvariety $V$. Our main result characterizes when the data\n$(A(K),+,V(K))$ (as a group with distinguished subset) determines the pair\n$(A,V)$ in the strongest reasonable sense.\n  As it turns out, the situation is best understood by developing a theory of\nfactorizations for such pairs $(A,V)$. In the final sections of the paper, we\ndevelop such a theory and prove unique factorization theorems (one for abelian\nvarieties and a weaker one for semi-abelian varieties). In this language, the\nmain theorem mentioned above (in the abelian case) says that the pair $(A,V)$\nis determined by the data $(A(K),+,V(K))$ precisely when $(A,V)$ is simple and\n$0<\\dim(V)<\\dim(A)$.",

    "abstract": "Alfv\\'enic turbulence is an effective mechanism for particle acceleration in\nstrongly magnetized, relativistic plasma. In this study, we investigate a\nscenario where turbulent plasma is influenced by a strong guide magnetic field,\nresulting in highly anisotropic turbulent fluctuations. In such cases, the\nmagnetic moments of particles are conserved, which means that acceleration can\nonly occur along the direction of the magnetic field. Consistent with previous\nanalytic studies, we find through PIC simulations of magnetically dominated\npair plasma that the momenta of accelerated particles are closely aligned with\nthe magnetic field lines. Notably, the alignment angle decreases as particle\nenergy increases, potentially limited only by the inherent curvature and\ngradients of the turbulent magnetic fluctuations. This finding has significant\nimplications for interpreting the synchrotron radiation emitted by highly\naccelerated particles.",

Additionally, we discovered\norganelle-level metabolic changes associated with diverse lysosomal storage\ndiseases. This method holds the broad potential to profile metabolic\nfingerprints of individual organelles within their native context and\nquantitatively assess their dynamic changes under different physiological and\npathological conditions, providing a high-resolution chemical cellular atlas.",
