    "abstract": "Recent works have established that AI models introduce spectral artifacts\ninto generated images and propose approaches for learning to capture them using\nlabeled data. However, the significant differences in such artifacts among\ndifferent generative models hinder these approaches from generalizing to\ngenerators not seen during training. In this work, we build upon the key idea\nthat the spectral distribution of real images constitutes both an invariant and\nhighly discriminative pattern for AI-generated image detection. To model this\nunder a self-supervised setup, we employ masked spectral learning using the\npretext task of frequency reconstruction. Since generated images constitute\nout-of-distribution samples for this model, we propose spectral reconstruction\nsimilarity to capture this divergence. Moreover, we introduce spectral context\nattention, which enables our approach to efficiently capture subtle spectral\ninconsistencies in images of any resolution. Our spectral AI-generated image\ndetection approach (SPAI) achieves a 5.5% absolute improvement in AUC over the\nprevious state-of-the-art across 13 recent generative approaches, while\nexhibiting robustness against common online perturbations.

    "abstract": "Production of energy (metabolism) and its distribution is vital for living\norganisms, both at individual level - between different functions of an\norganism, as well as between species of communities at different organizational\nlevels, including food chains. Here, a new general method for finding\ndistribution of metabolic energy between different organismal functions is\nproposed. The method is based on earlier discoveries (in two independent\nstudies, for multicellular and unicellular organisms) that metabolic allometric\nscaling is the result of natural selection guided by optimization of\ndistribution of common resources between the species of a food chain. This\ndistribution is established in such a way that it secures amount of resources\nfor each species to reproduce in sufficient quantities (sufficient for\npreservation of a food chain), while not allowing some species acquiring too\nmany resources to jeopardize existence of other species they prey on or share\ncommon resources with. The introduced method was applied to birds, including\nboth steady and short flights modes. Birds' metabolism has specifics, because\nbesides other functions, it has to compensate force of gravity during the\nflight. However, this parameter is difficult to find, while such data is\nimportant for ecological studies at population and individual levels. We\ndiscovered increase of fraction of metabolic power required to compensate force\nof gravity with mass increase, which is a principal factor, restricting maximum\npossible mass of flying animals. The obtained results show efficiency of a\nproposed method for detailed studies of animals' metabolism, physiology, and of\npopulation ecology.",

Sate-of-the-art models like Stable\nDiffusion 3 (SD3), Flux, and AuraFlow still struggle with accurate text\ndepiction, resulting in misspelled or inconsistent text. We introduce a\ntraining-free method with minimal computational overhead that significantly\nenhances text rendering quality. Specifically, we introduce an overshooting\nsampler for pretrained rectified flow (RF) models, by alternating between\nover-simulating the learned ordinary differential equation (ODE) and\nreintroducing noise. Compared to the Euler sampler, the overshooting sampler\neffectively introduces an extra Langevin dynamics term that can help correct\nthe compounding error from successive Euler steps and therefore improve the\ntext rendering. However, when the overshooting strength is high, we observe\nover-smoothing artifacts on the generated images. To address this issue, we\npropose an Attention Modulated Overshooting sampler (AMO), which adaptively\ncontrols the strength of overshooting for each image patch according to their\nattention score with the text content. AMO demonstrates a 32.3% and 35.9%\nimprovement in text rendering accuracy on SD3 and Flux without compromising\noverall image quality or increasing inference cost.

    "abstract": "Delta Debugging is a widely used family of algorithms (e.g., ddmin and\nProbDD) to automatically minimize bug-triggering test inputs, thus to\nfacilitate debugging. It takes a list of elements with each element\nrepresenting a fragment of the test input, systematically partitions the list\nat different granularities, identifies and deletes bug-irrelevant partitions.\n  Prior delta debugging algorithms assume there are no differences among the\nelements in the list, and thus treat them uniformly during partitioning.\nHowever, in practice, this assumption usually does not hold, because the size\n(referred to as weight) of the fragment represented by each element can vary\nsignificantly. For example, a single element representing 50% of the test input\nis much more likely to be bug-relevant than elements representing only 1%. This\nassumption inevitably impairs the efficiency or even effectiveness of these\ndelta debugging algorithms.\n  This paper proposes Weighted Delta Debugging (WDD), a novel concept to help\nprior delta debugging algorithms overcome the limitation mentioned above. The\nkey insight of WDD is to assign each element in the list a weight according to\nits size, and distinguish different elements based on their weights during\npartitioning. We designed two new minimization algorithms, Wddmin and WProbDD,\nby applying WDD to ddmin and ProbDD respectively. We extensively evaluated\nWddmin and WProbDD in two representative applications, HDD and Perses, on 62\nbenchmarks across two languages. The results strongly demonstrate the value of\nWDD. We firmly believe that WDD opens up a new dimension to improve test input\nminimization techniques.",

Consequently, the transformation law of temperature between inertial\nframes also remains unresolved. In this study, we introduce a kinetic\ndefinition of temperature for an ensemble of self-gravitating particles,\nassuming that temperature reflects the average spatial kinetic energy of a\nparticle. This kinetic temperature, which applies outside of equilibrium,\nnaturally reduces to the familiar special relativistic and non-relativistic\ntemperatures in appropriate limits. Moreover, it exhibits the Tolman-Ehrenfest\neffect, linking temperature to the norm of the Killing field associated with\ncoordinate time. We further demonstrate that, when particle speeds are\nnon-relativistic, the transformation law for kinetic temperature follows the\nOtt-Arzeli\\`es formula, suggesting that in this regime, a moving body appears\nhotter.

We\ncalculate the Josephson current as a function of the chemical potential\nrelative to the band edge in the superconducting region, $\\mu_S$, where the BEC\nphase is indicated by $\\mu_S <0$. The chemical potential relative to the band\nedge in the normal metal, $\\mu_N$, allows us to tune the junction between the\nSNS case ($\\mu_N>0$) and the SIS case, where the superconductors are separated\nby a tunneling barrier. We find that there are Andreev levels in the BEC\nregime, as long as there is sufficient density of states in the normal region,\ni.e. when $\\mu_N>\\Delta$, where $\\Delta$ is the amplitude of the\nsuperconducting order parameter. For 1D SNS junctions, we find the Josephson\ncurrent $I_S$ carried by these Andreev levels to be a function of the ratio\n$\\Delta/\\Delta_d$, where $\\Delta_d$ is the Andreev level spacing. At zero\ntemperature, the Josephson current has a maximum on the BCS side of the\ntransition where $\\Delta$ is maximal.

    "abstract": "The importance of drinking water distribution networks (DWDNs) as critical\nurban infrastructures has led to the development and utilization of models for\nthe analysis, design, operation, and management of DWDNs, to ensure optimal\nefficiency and water quality. In order to provide models that accurately\nrepresent real-world behavior and characteristics of an actual DWDN, model\ncalibration is an essential and crucial procedure (Alves et al., 2014).\nHowever, since DWDNs are generally large, underground networks, data\navailability for model calibration is often an issue. In this paper, we\nintroduce a novel automatic calibration methodology called Expert Systems and\nNeuro-Evolution of Augmenting Topologies (ES-NEAT). The proposed methodology\nleverages the power of Expert Systems (ES) and genetic algorithms for the\nevolution of neural network topologies to efficiently search for the optimal\nsolution of high dimensional calibration problems while maintaining moderate\ncomputational effort. One of the key strengths of ES-NEAT lies in its ability\nto achieve high accuracy even with limited availability of measurements,\naddressing the inherent uncertainty in real-world DWDNs. By integrating\nspecific knowledge provided by different stakeholders using the ES methodology,\nthe framework offers a flexible approach that adapts to the unique\ncharacteristics of each drinking water distribution network. Moreover, the\nmethodology is designed to store calibration information and transfer it in a\nstructured format for use in subsequent calibration processes, increasing\nefficiency and ensuring generalizability. The method was successfully applied\nto a benchmark network model as well as a real-case study of a DWDN in\nFlanders, Belgium.",

    "abstract": "Future communication networks are expected to connect massive distributed\nartificial intelligence (AI). Exploiting aligned priori knowledge of AI pairs,\nit is promising to convert high-dimensional data transmission into\nhighly-compressed semantic communications (SC). However, to accommodate the\nlocal data distribution and user preferences, AIs generally adapt to different\ndomains, which fundamentally distorts the SC alignment. In this paper, we\npropose a zero-forget domain adaptation (ZFDA) framework to preserve SC\nalignment. To prevent the DA from changing substantial neural parameters of AI,\nwe design sparse additive modifications (SAM) to the parameters, which can be\nefficiently stored and switched-off to restore the SC alignment. To optimize\nthe SAM, we decouple it into tractable continuous variables and a binary mask,\nand then handle the binary mask by a score-based optimization. Experimental\nevaluations on a SC system for image transmissions validate that the proposed\nframework perfectly preserves the SC alignment with almost no loss of DA\nperformance, even improved in some cases, at a cost of less than 1% of\nadditional memory.",

In this article, we investigate the consequences of random effects\nmisspecification for point prediction and prediction inference in GLMMs, a\ntopic on which there is considerably less research compared to consequences for\nparameter estimation and inference. We use theory, simulation, and a real\napplication to explore the effect of using the common normality assumption for\nthe random effects distribution when the correct specification is a mixture of\nnormal distributions, focusing on the impacts on point prediction, mean squared\nprediction errors (MSEPs), and prediction intervals. We found that the optimal\nshrinkage is different under the two random effect distributions, so is\nimpacted by misspecification. The unconditional MSEPs for the random effects\nare almost always larger under the misspecified normal random effects\ndistribution, especially when cluster sizes are small. Results for the MSEPs\nconditional on the random effects are more complicated, but they remain\ngenerally larger under the misspecified distribution when the true random\neffect is close to the mean of one of the component distributions in the true\nmixture distribution. Results for prediction intervals indicate that overall\ncoverage probability is not greatly impacted by misspecification.",

The nearby post-AGB star IRAS 17287 -- 3443 ($\\approx 0.6 M_\\odot$),\nalso within the SNR, enriches the scenario. To address this puzzle, we advance\nthe possibility that the gravitational collapse of a rotating pre-SN iron core\n($\\approx 1.2 M_\\odot$) could result in a low-mass NS. We show that angular\nmomentum conservation during the collapse of an iron core rotating at $\\approx\n45\\%$ of the Keplerian limit results in a mass loss of $\\approx 0.3 M_\\odot$,\nproducing a stable newborn NS of $\\approx 0.9 M_\\odot$. Considering the\npossible spin-down, this indicates that the NS is now slowly rotating, thus\nfulfilling the observed mass-radius relation. Additionally, the NS's surface\ntemperature ($\\approx 2 \\times 10^6$ K) aligns with canonical thermal evolution\nfor its $\\approx 4.5$ kyr age.

In addition to predicting\nreward labels, the latent-space of the SSNP is jointly trained with an\nautoencoding objective using passive data from a much larger set of objects.\nJointly training with both types of data allows the model to focus more\neffectively on generalizable features and minimizes the need for extensive\nretraining, thereby reducing computational demands.

    "abstract": "More music foundation models are recently being released, promising a\ngeneral, mostly task independent encoding of musical information. Common ways\nof adapting music foundation models to downstream tasks are probing and\nfine-tuning. These common transfer learning approaches, however, face\nchallenges. Probing might lead to suboptimal performance because the\npre-trained weights are frozen, while fine-tuning is computationally expensive\nand is prone to overfitting. Our work investigates the use of\nparameter-efficient transfer learning (PETL) for music foundation models which\nintegrates the advantage of probing and fine-tuning. We introduce three types\nof PETL methods: adapter-based methods, prompt-based methods, and\nreparameterization-based methods. These methods train only a small number of\nparameters, and therefore do not require significant computational resources.\nResults show that PETL methods outperform both probing and fine-tuning on music\nauto-tagging. On key detection and tempo estimation, they achieve similar\nresults as fine-tuning with significantly less training cost. However, the\nusefulness of the current generation of foundation model on key and tempo tasks\nis questioned by the similar results achieved by training a small model from\nscratch.

These challenges are\nfrequently encountered in modern applications, such as Likelihood-Free\nInference (LFI). In these settings, confidence sets may fail to maintain a\nconfidence level close to the nominal value. In this paper, we introduce two\nnovel methods, TRUST and TRUST++, for calibrating confidence sets to achieve\ndistribution-free conditional coverage. These methods rely entirely on\nsimulated data from the statistical model to perform calibration. Leveraging\ninsights from conformal prediction techniques adapted to the statistical\ninference context, our methods ensure both finite-sample local coverage and\nasymptotic conditional coverage as the number of simulations increases, even if\nn is small. They effectively handle nuisance parameters and provide\ncomputationally efficient uncertainty quantification for the estimated\nconfidence sets. This allows users to assess whether additional simulations are\nnecessary for robust inference. Through theoretical analysis and experiments on\nmodels with both tractable and intractable likelihoods, we demonstrate that our\nmethods outperform existing approaches, particularly in small-sample regimes.\nThis work bridges the gap between conformal prediction and statistical\ninference, offering practical tools for constructing valid confidence sets in\ncomplex models.",

We focus on\none such object: the bag, a multiset from which processes can take unspecified\nelements.\n  We present the first lock-free, strongly-linearizable implementation of a bag\nfrom interfering objects (specifically, registers, and test&set objects). This\nmay be surprising, since there are provably no such implementations of stacks\nor queues.\n  Since a bag can contain arbitrarily many elements, an unbounded amount of\nspace must be used to implement it. Hence, it makes sense to also consider a\nbag with a bound on its capacity. However, like stacks and queues, a bag with\ncapacity $b$ shared by more than $2b$ processes has no lock-free,\nstrongly-linearizable implementation from interfering objects. If we further\nrestrict a bounded bag so that only one process can insert into it, we are able\nto obtain a lock-free, strongly-linearizable implementation from $O(b + n)$\ninterfering objects, where $n$ is the number of processes.\n  Our goal is to understand the circumstances under which strongly-linearizable\nimplementations of bags exist and, more generally, to understand the power of\ninterfering objects.",

There is a set of machines of fixed capacity, each of which can process\nmultiple operations simultaneously.

Using a representative sample of 1100 participants from Germany,\nthis study examines mental models of AI.

We\npresent rankings of these projections alongside visual mappings illustrating\npublic risk-benefit tradeoffs. While many scenarios were deemed likely,\nparticipants often associated them with high risks, limited benefits, and low\noverall value. Across all scenarios, 96.4% ($r^2=96.4\\%$) of the variance in\nvalue assessment can be explained by perceived risks ($\\beta=-.504$) and\nperceived benefits ($\\beta=+.710$), with no significant relation to expected\nlikelihood.

Our proposal is inspired by Golgi's theory modeling the brain\nas a syncytial continuum, in contrast to Cajal's theory of neurons and synapses\nbeing discrete elements. While Cajal's theory has long been the dominant and\nexperimentally validated view of the nervous system, recent discoveries showed\nthat a species of marine invertebrate (ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi) may be\nbetter described by Golgi's theory. The core idea is to develop hardware that\nfunctions analogously to a syncytial network, exploiting self-assembled\nmemristive systems and combining them with CMOS technologies, interfacing with\nthe silicon back-end-of-line. In this way, a memristive self-assembled material\ncan cheaply and efficiently replace the synaptic connections between CMOS\nneuron implementations in neuromorphic hardware, enhancing the capability of\nmassively parallel computation. The fusion of CMOS circuits with a memristive\n``plexus'' allows information transfer without requiring engineered synapses,\nwhich typically consume significant area. As the first step toward this\nambitious goal, we present a simulation of a memristive network interfaced with\nspiking neural networks.

However, the\nalignment objective used to train CLIP often results in subpar visual features\nfor fine-grained tasks. In contrast, SSL-pretrained models like DINO excel at\nextracting rich visual features due to their specialized training paradigm.\nYet, these SSL models require an additional supervised linear probing step,\nwhich relies on fully labeled data which is often expensive and difficult to\nobtain at scale. In this paper, we propose a label-free prompt-tuning method\nthat leverages the rich visual features of self-supervised learning models\n(DINO) and the broad textual knowledge of large language models (LLMs) to\nlargely enhance CLIP-based image classification performance using unlabeled\nimages. Our approach unfolds in three key steps: (1) We generate robust textual\nfeature embeddings that more accurately represent object classes by leveraging\nclass-specific descriptions from LLMs, enabling more effective zero-shot\nclassification compared to CLIP's default name-specific prompts. (2) These\ntextual embeddings are then used to produce pseudo-labels to train an alignment\nmodule that integrates the complementary strengths of LLM description-based\ntextual embeddings & DINO's visual features. (3) Finally, we prompt-tune CLIP's\nvision encoder through DINO-assisted supervision using the trained alignment\nmodule. This three-step process allows us to harness the best of visual &\ntextual foundation models, resulting in a powerful and efficient approach that\nsurpasses state-of-the-art label-free classification methods.

To refine the fMRI denoising model, our\nmethod employs a 3D dense U-Net discriminator to learn both global and local\ndistinctions. To tackle potential over-smoothing, we introduce an adversarial\nloss and enhance perceptual similarity by measuring feature space distances.\nExperiments illustrate that 3D U-WGAN significantly improves image quality in\nresting-state and task preclinical fMRI data, enhancing signal-to-noise ratio\nwithout introducing excessive structural changes in existing methods.

In this work, we\npresent our observations on the influence of temperature, pressure, and seeding\nlayer parameters on the sputter growth processes of superlattice films. By\nmeasuring various material properties, we construct a pseudo-phase diagram to\nillustrate the growth of both individual and superlattice films with different\nperiodicities on technologically relevant substrates, namely SiO2 and carbon.\nThese results provide important insights into the structure, intermixing and\nelectro-optical properties of superlattice films,",

It\npreserves data privacy by keeping the data decentralized and training the model\non local devices, ensuring that raw data never leaves the user's device.\nMoreover, the integration of PEFT methods such as LoRA significantly reduces\nthe number of trainable parameters compared to fine-tuning the entire model,\nthereby minimizing communication costs and computational overhead. Despite its\npotential, the security implications of FedPEFT remain underexplored. This\npaper introduces a novel security threat to FedPEFT, termed PEFT-as-an-Attack\n(PaaA), which exposes how PEFT can be exploited as an attack vector to\ncircumvent PLMs' safety alignment and generate harmful content in response to\nmalicious prompts. Our evaluation of PaaA reveals that with less than 1% of the\nmodel's parameters set as trainable, and a small subset of clients acting\nmaliciously, the attack achieves an approximate 80% attack success rate using\nrepresentative PEFT methods such as LoRA. To mitigate this threat, we further\ninvestigate potential defense strategies, including Robust Aggregation Schemes\n(RASs) and Post-PEFT Safety Alignment (PPSA). However, our empirical analysis\nhighlights the limitations of these defenses, i.e., even the most advanced\nRASs, such as DnC and ClippedClustering, struggle to defend against PaaA in\nscenarios with highly heterogeneous data distributions. Similarly, while PPSA\ncan reduce attack success rates to below 10%, it severely degrades the model's\naccuracy on the target task.

This paper, for the first time, attempts to\nexamine its validity on modern deep models through empirical correlation\nanalyses and provide reflections on the field of neural network pruning.\nSpecifically, for a typical pruning algorithm with three stages (pertaining,\npruning, and retraining), we analyze the model performance correlation before\nand after retraining. Extensive experiments (37K models are trained) across a\nwide spectrum of models (LeNet5, VGG, ResNets, ViT, MLLM) and datasets (MNIST\nand its variants, CIFAR10/CIFAR100, ImageNet-1K, MLLM data) are conducted. The\nresults lead to a surprising conclusion: on modern deep learning models, the\nperformance before retraining is barely correlated with the performance after\nretraining. Namely, the weights selected by oracle pruning can hardly guarantee\na good performance after retraining. This further implies that existing works\nusing oracle pruning to derive pruning criteria may be groundless from the\nbeginning.

    "abstract": "The first \"seeds\" of supermassive black holes (BHs) continue to be an\noutstanding puzzle, and it is currently unclear whether the imprints of early\nseed formation survive today. Here we examine the signatures of seeding in the\nlocal Universe using five $[18~\\mathrm{Mpc}]^3$ BRAHMA simulation boxes run to\n$z=0$. They initialize $1.5\\times10^5~M_{\\odot}$ BHs using different seeding\nmodels. The first four boxes initialize BHs as heavy seeds using criteria that\ndepend on dense & metal-poor gas, Lyman-Werner radiation, gas spin, and\nenvironmental richness. The fifth box initializes BHs as descendants of lower\nmass seeds ($\\sim10^3~M_{\\odot}$) using a new stochastic seed model built in\nour previous work. We find that strong signatures of seeding survive in\n$\\sim10^5-10^6~M_{\\odot}$ local BHs hosted in $M_*\\lesssim10^{9}~M_{\\odot}$\ndwarf galaxies. The signatures survive due to two reasons: 1) there is a\nsubstantial population of local $\\sim10^5~M_{\\odot}$ BHs that are ungrown\nrelics of early seeds from $z\\sim5-10$; 2) BH growth up to $\\sim10^6~M_{\\odot}$\nis dominated by mergers all the way down to $z\\sim0$. As the contribution from\ngas accretion increases, the signatures of seeding start to weaken in more\nmassive $\\gtrsim10^6~M_{\\odot}$ BHs, and they eventually disappear for\n$\\gtrsim10^7~M_{\\odot}$ BHs. This is in contrast to high-z ($z\\gtrsim5$) BH\npopulations wherein the BH growth is fully merger dominated, which causes the\nseeding signatures to persist at least up to $\\sim10^8~M_{\\odot}$. The\ndifferent seed models predict abundances of local $\\sim10^6~M_{\\odot}$ BHs\nranging from $\\sim0.01-0.05~\\mathrm{Mpc}^{-3}$ with occupation fractions of\n$\\sim20-100\\%$ in $M_*\\sim10^{9}~M_{\\odot}$ galaxies.

While existing\nvision-language models such as CLIP can generate segmentation masks by\nleveraging coarse spatial information from Vision Transformers, they face\nchallenges in spatial localization due to their global alignment of image and\ntext features. Conversely, self-supervised visual models like DINO excel in\nfine-grained visual encoding but lack integration with language. To bridge this\ngap, we present Talk2DINO, a novel hybrid approach that combines the spatial\naccuracy of DINOv2 with the language understanding of CLIP.

At training time, we exploit the attention maps of DINOv2 to\nselectively align local visual patches with textual embeddings. We show that\nthe powerful semantic and localization abilities of Talk2DINO can enhance the\nsegmentation process, resulting in more natural and less noisy segmentations,\nand that our approach can also effectively distinguish foreground objects from\nthe background.

Therefore, the angular momentum\ntransport mechanisms are crucial for predicting the lifetime of the\nhypermassive neutron star. One such mechanism is the Tayler-Spruit dynamo, and\nrecent simulations have shown that it could grow in proto-neutron stars formed\nduring supernova explosions. We aim to investigate whether hypermassive neutron\nstars with high neutrino viscosity could be unstable to the Tayler-Spruit\ndynamo and study how magnetic fields would evolve in this context. Using a\none-zone model based on the result of a 3D GRMHD simulation, we investigate the\ntime evolution of the magnetic fields generated by the Tayler-Spruit dynamo. In\naddition, we analyze the dynamics of the 3D GRMHD simulation to determine\nwhether the dynamo is present. Our one-zone model predicts that the\nTayler-Spruit dynamo can increase the toroidal magnetic field to $ \\ge 10^{17}$\nG and the dipole field to amplitudes $\\ge 10^{16}$ G. The dynamo's growth\ntimescale depends on the initial large-scale magnetic field right after the\nmerger. In the case of a long-lived hypermassive neutron star, an initial\nmagnetic field of $\\ge 10^{12}$ G would be enough for the magnetic field to be\namplified in a few seconds. However, we show that the resolution of the current\nGRMHD simulations is insufficient to resolve the Tayler-Spruit dynamo due to\nhigh numerical dissipation at small scales. We find that the Tayler-Spruit\ndynamo could occur in hypermassive neutron stars and shorten their lifetime,\nwhich would have consequences on multi-messenger observations.",

We discovered that\nWOH G64 is a rare, massive symbiotic system formed by a RSG, which transitioned\nto a Yellow Hypergiant, and a B-star companion. The dramatic transition can be\nexplained by: a) binary interactions partially stripping the envelope, b) the\nreturn of WOH G64 to a quiescent state after an outstanding eruption exceeding\n30 years, and c) the expulsion of its outer layers due to a pre-SN superwind\nphase, indicating its imminent explosion.

The parameter $C_1$ depends on the power law index\nof the wavenumber spectrum of electron density inhomogeneities in the ionized\ninterstellar medium. Radio waves propagating through the inhomogeneous ionized\nmedium suffer multipath propagation, as a result of which the pulsed emission\nfrom a neutron star undergoes scatter broadening. Consequently, interference\nbetween the delayed copies of the scatter-broadened electric field manifests as\nscintillation. We measure a scintillation bandwidth \\nud=$149\\pm3$~Hz as well\nas a scatter-broadening timescale \\taud=$1.22\\pm0.09$~ms at 650~MHz. These two\nquantities are related through the uncertainty relation $C_1 = 2\\pi$\\nud\\taud,\nusing which we directly measure $C_1=1.2\\pm0.1$. We describe the methods\nemployed to obtain these results and discuss their implications in general, as\nwell as for the magnetar XTE~J1810\\textminus197, towards which the measurements\nhave been made. We also discuss how such, effectively in-situ, measurements of\n$C_1$ can aid in inferring the wavenumber spectrum power law index and hence\nquantitatively discriminate between the various possible scattering scenarios\nin the ionized medium. Finally, using the fact $C_1 \\sim 1$, we nominally\nconstrain the emission size to less than a few 1000~km for a screen very close\nto the magnetar, and to within the magnetosphere for all screen distances.",

Furthermore, they are typically\nfine-tuned to replicate demonstrations collected by experts under different\nsettings, thus introducing distribution bias and limiting their adaptability to\ndiverse manipulation objectives, such as efficiency, safety, and task\ncompletion. To bridge this gap, we introduce GRAPE: Generalizing Robot Policy\nvia Preference Alignment. Specifically, GRAPE aligns VLAs on a trajectory level\nand implicitly models reward from both successful and failure trials to boost\ngeneralizability to diverse tasks. Moreover, GRAPE breaks down complex\nmanipulation tasks to independent stages and automatically guides preference\nmodeling through customized spatiotemporal constraints with keypoints proposed\nby a large vision-language model. Notably, these constraints are flexible and\ncan be customized to align the model with varying objectives, such as safety,\nefficiency, or task success. We evaluate GRAPE across a diverse array of tasks\nin both real-world and simulated environments. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat GRAPE enhances the performance of state-of-the-art VLA models, increasing\nsuccess rates on in-domain and unseen manipulation tasks by 51.79% and 58.20%,\nrespectively.

    "abstract": "Data assimilation techniques are crucial for correcting the trajectory when\nmodeling complex physical systems. A recently developed data assimilation\nmethod, Latent Ensemble Score Filter (Latent-EnSF), has shown great promise in\naddressing the key limitation of EnSF for highly sparse observations in\nhigh-dimensional and nonlinear data assimilation problems. It performs data\nassimilation in a latent space for encoded states and observations in every\nassimilation step, and requires costly full dynamics to be evolved in the\noriginal space. In this paper, we introduce Latent Dynamics EnSF (LD-EnSF), a\nnovel methodology that completely avoids the full dynamics evolution and\nsignificantly accelerates the data assimilation process, which is especially\nvaluable for complex dynamical problems that require fast data assimilation in\nreal time. To accomplish this, we introduce a novel variant of Latent Dynamics\nNetworks (LDNets) to effectively capture and preserve the system's dynamics\nwithin a very low-dimensional latent space. Additionally, we propose a new\nmethod for encoding sparse observations into the latent space using Long\nShort-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which leverage not only the current step's\nobservations, as in Latent-EnSF, but also all previous steps, thereby improving\nthe accuracy and robustness of the observation encoding. We demonstrate the\nrobustness, accuracy, and efficiency of the proposed method for two challenging\ndynamical systems with highly sparse (in both space and time) and noisy\nobservations.",

We introduce a convenient\nfunctional geometric formalism that allows us to straightforwardly generalize\nknown results from finite dimensional systems to the case of continuous fields.\nWe give, at field level, full reversibility conditions for three notions of\ntime-reversal defined in the first article of this two-part series, namely T-,\nMT-, and EMT-reversibility. When the noise correlator is invertible, these\nreversibility conditions do not make reference to any generically unknown\nfunction like the stationary probability, and can thus be verified\nsystematically. Focusing on the simplest of these notions, where only the time\nvariable is flipped upon time reversal, we show that time-reversal symmetry\nbreaking is quantified by a single geometric object: the vorticity two-form,\nwhich is a two-form over the functional space $\\mathbb{F}$ to which the field\nbelongs. Reversibility then amounts to the cancellation of this vorticity\ntwo-form. This condition applies at distributional level and can thus be\ndifficult to use in practice. For fields that are defined on a spatial domain\nof dimension $d=1$, we overcome this problem by building a basis of the space\nof two-forms $\\Omega^2(\\mathbb{F})$. Reversibility is then equivalent to the\nvanishing of the vorticity's coordinates in this basis, a criterion that is\nreadily applicable to concrete examples. Furthermore, we show that this basis\nprovides a natural direct-sum decomposition of $\\Omega^2(\\mathbb{F})$, each\nsubspace of which is associated with a distinctive kind of phenomenology.

Experimental results demonstrate that UrbanCAD\noutperforms baselines in terms of photorealism.

    "abstract": "We investigate solutions to the new \"Ziggu\" family of exponential puzzles.\nThese puzzles have $p$ pieces that form $m$ mazes. We encode the puzzle state\nas an quaternary number (base $4$) with $n=m+1$ digits, where each digit gives\nthe horizontal or vertical position in one maze. We show that the number of\nstates on a shortest solution is $6 \\cdot 2^n - 3n - 5$ (OEIS A101946). This\nsolution is unique, and it is generated from the start as follows: make the\nleftmost modification that doesn't undo the previous modification. Replacing\n\"leftmost\" with \"rightmost\" instead generates the unique longest solution that\nvisits all $(3^{n+1} - 1)/2$ states (OEIS A003462). Thus, Ziggu puzzles can be\nviewed as $4$-ary, $3$-ary, or $2$-ary puzzles based on how the number of state\nencodings, valid states, or minimum states grow with each additional maze.\n  Classic Gray code puzzles (e.g., Spin-Out) provide natural comparisons. Gray\ncode puzzles with $p$ pieces have $2^p$ (OEIS A000079) or $\\lfloor \\frac{2}{3}\n\\cdot 2^p \\rfloor$ (OEIS A000975) states on their unique solution. The states\nvisited in a Gray code puzzle solution follow the binary reflected Gray code.\nWe show that Ziggu puzzles follow the quaternary reflected Gray code, as the\nshortest and longest solutions are both sublists of this order.\n  These results show how to solve Ziggu puzzles from the start. We also provide\n$O(n)$-time ranking, comparison, and successor algorithms, which give the\nstate's position along a solution, the relative order of two states, and the\nnext state, respectively. While Gray code puzzles have simpler recursive\ndescriptions and successor rules, the Ziggu puzzle has a simpler loopless\nalgorithm to generate its shortest solution. The two families share a\ncomparison function. Finally, we enrich the literature on OEIS A101946 by\nproviding a bijection between Ziggu states and $2\\times n$ Nurikabe grids.",

In the standard cosmological framework, BGWs are constrained in their\nfrequency range by the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) limit on GW amplitude,\nwhich precludes their detection at interferometer scales. However, introducing\na phase of early matter domination dilutes BGWs at higher frequencies, ensuring\ncompatibility with both the BBN and LIGO constraints on stochastic GWs.

However, real-world\nscenarios often involve large-scale datasets and numerous constraints,\npresenting significant challenges. Current methods for differentiating\noptimization problems typically rely on implicit differentiation, which\nnecessitates costly computations on the Jacobian matrices, resulting in low\nefficiency.

However, due\nto the inconvenience associated with the direct measurement of displacement\nduring dynamic loading and the high cost of displacement sensors, the use of\ndisplacement measurements often gets restricted. In recent years, indirect\nestimation of displacement from acceleration and strain data has gained\npopularity. Several researchers have developed data fusion techniques to\nestimate displacement from acceleration and strain data. However, existing data\nfusion techniques mostly rely on system properties like mode shapes or finite\nelement models and require accurate knowledge about the system for successful\nimplementation. Hence, they have the inherent limitation of their applicability\nbeing restricted to relatively simple structures where such information is\neasily available. In this article, B-spline basis functions have been used to\nformulate a Kalman filter-based algorithm for acceleration and strain data\nfusion using only elementary information about the system, such as the geometry\nand boundary conditions, which is the major advantage of this method. Also, the\nproposed algorithm enables us to monitor the full-field displacement of the\nsystem online with only a limited number of sensors. The method has been\nvalidated on a numerically generated dataset from the finite element model of a\ntapered beam subjected to dynamic excitation. Later, the proposed data fusion\ntechnique was applied to an experimental benchmark test of a wind turbine blade\nunder dynamic load to estimate the displacement time history.

    "abstract": "In the field of data-driven 3D shape analysis and generation, the estimation\nof global topological features from localized representations such as point\nclouds, voxels, and neural implicit fields is a longstanding challenge. This\npaper introduces a novel, differentiable algorithm tailored to accurately\nestimate the global topology of 3D shapes, overcoming the limitations of\ntraditional methods rooted in mesh reconstruction and topological data\nanalysis. The proposed method ensures high accuracy, efficiency, and instant\ncomputation with GPU compatibility. It begins with an efficient calculation of\nthe self-adjoint Weingarten map for point clouds and its adaptations for other\nmodalities. The curvatures are then extracted, and their integration over\ntangent differentiable Voronoi elements is utilized to estimate key topological\ninvariants, including the Euler number and Genus. Additionally, an\nauto-optimization mechanism is implemented to refine the local moving frames\nand area elements based on the integrity of topological invariants.\nExperimental results demonstrate the method's superior performance across\nvarious datasets. The robustness and differentiability of the algorithm ensure\nits seamless integration into deep learning frameworks, offering vast potential\nfor downstream tasks in 3D shape analysis.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we compare the performance of randomized classical and quantum\nneural networks (NNs) as well as classical and quantum-classical hybrid\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the task of binary image\nclassification. We use two distinct methodologies: using randomized NNs on\ndimensionality-reduced data, and applying CNNs to full image data. We evaluate\nthese approaches on three data sets of increasing complexity: an artificial\nhypercube dataset, MNIST handwritten digits and real-world industrial images.\nWe analyze correlations between classification accuracy and quantum model\nhyperparameters, including the number of trainable parameters, feature encoding\nmethods, circuit layers, entangling gate type and structure, gate entangling\npower, and measurement operators. For random quantum NNs, we compare their\nperformance against literature models. Classical and quantum/hybrid models\nachieved statistically equivalent classification accuracies across most\ndatasets, with no approach demonstrating consistent superiority. We observe\nthat quantum models show lower variance with respect to initial training\nparameters, suggesting better training stability. Among the hyperparameters\nanalyzed, only the number of trainable parameters showed a positive correlation\nwith the model performance. Around 94% of the best-performing quantum NNs had\nentangling gates, although for hybrid CNNs, models without entanglement\nperformed equally well but took longer to converge. Cross-dataset performance\nanalysis revealed limited transferability of quantum models between different\nclassification tasks. Our study provides an industry perspective on quantum\nmachine learning for practical image classification tasks, highlighting both\ncurrent limitations and potential avenues for further research in quantum\ncircuit design, entanglement utilization, and model transferability across\nvaried applications.",

To\naddress this limitation, this paper introduces VECOGEN, a novel tool that\ncombines large language models with formal verification to automate the\ngeneration of formally verified C programs. VECOGEN takes a formal\nspecification in ANSI/ISO C Specification Language, a natural language\nspecification, and a set of test cases to attempt to generate a verified\nprogram. This program-generation process consists of two steps. First, VECOGEN\ngenerates an initial set of candidate programs. Secondly, the tool iteratively\nimproves on previously generated candidates. If a candidate program meets the\nformal specification, then we are sure the program is correct. We evaluate\nVECOGEN on 15 problems presented in Codeforces competitions. On these problems,\nVECOGEN solves 13 problems. This work shows the potential of combining large\nlanguage models with formal verification to automate program generation.",

    "abstract": "Most of current computer vision-based advanced driver assistance systems\n(ADAS) perform detection and tracking of objects quite successfully under\nregular conditions. However, under adverse weather and changing lighting\nconditions, and in complex situations with many overlapping objects, these\nsystems are not completely reliable. The spectral reflectance of the different\nobjects in a driving scene beyond the visible spectrum can offer additional\ninformation to increase the reliability of these systems, especially under\nchallenging driving conditions. Furthermore, this information may be\nsignificant enough to develop vision systems that allow for a better\nunderstanding and interpretation of the whole driving scene. In this work we\nexplore the use of snapshot, video-rate hyperspectral imaging (HSI) cameras in\nADAS on the assumption that the near infrared (NIR) spectral reflectance of\ndifferent materials can help to better segment the objects in real driving\nscenarios. To do this, we have used the HSI-Drive 1.1 dataset to perform\nvarious experiments on spectral classification algorithms. However, the\ninformation retrieval of hyperspectral recordings in natural outdoor scenarios\nis challenging, mainly because of deficient colour constancy and other inherent\nshortcomings of current snapshot HSI technology, which poses some limitations\nto the development of pure spectral classifiers. In consequence, in this work\nwe analyze to what extent the spatial features codified by standard, tiny fully\nconvolutional network (FCN) models can improve the performance of HSI\nsegmentation systems for ADAS applications.\n  The abstract above is truncated due to submission limits.

Using light curve data from 27 epochs, we constructed models of the\naccretion disk.

The\nphotometric orbital cycle and the long-term cycle are consistent with a disk\ncontaining variable physical properties, including two shock regions. The disk\nencircles the more massive star and the system brightness variations align with\nthe long-term cycle at orbital phase 0.25.

    "abstract": "Geometric priors are often used to enhance 3D reconstruction. With many\nsmartphones featuring low-resolution depth sensors and the prevalence of\noff-the-shelf monocular geometry estimators, incorporating geometric priors as\nregularization signals has become common in 3D vision tasks. However, the\naccuracy of depth estimates from mobile devices is typically poor for highly\ndetailed geometry, and monocular estimators often suffer from poor multi-view\nconsistency and precision. In this work, we propose an approach for joint\nsurface depth and normal refinement of Gaussian Splatting methods for accurate\n3D reconstruction of indoor scenes. We develop supervision strategies that\nadaptively filters low-quality depth and normal estimates by comparing the\nconsistency of the priors during optimization. We mitigate regularization in\nregions where prior estimates have high uncertainty or ambiguities. Our\nfiltering strategy and optimization design demonstrate significant improvements\nin both mesh estimation and novel-view synthesis for both 3D and 2D Gaussian\nSplatting-based methods on challenging indoor room datasets. Furthermore, we\nexplore the use of alternative meshing strategies for finer geometry\nextraction.

This graph has many twins, leading us to define\n$tsat(n,K_r)$ to be the minimum number of edges in a twin-free $K_r$-saturated\ngraph on $n$ vertices. We show that $(5 +2/3)n + o(n) \\leq tsat(n,K_3) \\leq\n6n+o(n)$ and that $\\left(r+2\\right)n + o(n) \\leq tsat(n,K_r) \\leq (r+3)n+o(n)$\nfor $r \\geq 4$. We also consider a variant of this problem where we\nadditionally require the graphs to have large minimum degree. Both of these\nproblems turn out be intimately related to two other problems regarding\nmaximally independent sets of a given size in $K_3$-free graphs and\ngeneralisations of these problems to $K_r$ with $r \\geq 4$. The first problem\nis to maximise the number of maximally independent sets given the number of\nvertices and the second problem is to minimise the number of edges given the\nnumber of maximally independent sets.

    "abstract": "Visual localization, which estimates a camera's pose within a known scene, is\na long-standing challenge in vision and robotics. Recent end-to-end methods\nthat directly regress camera poses from query images have gained attention for\nfast inference. However, existing methods often struggle to generalize to\nunseen views. In this work, we aim to unleash the power of data synthesis to\npromote the generalizability of pose regression. Specifically, we lift real 2D\nimages into 3D Gaussian Splats with varying appearance and deblurring\nabilities, which are then used as a data engine to synthesize more posed\nimages. To fully leverage the synthetic data, we build a two-branch joint\ntraining pipeline, with an adversarial discriminator to bridge the syn-to-real\ngap. Experiments on established benchmarks show that our method outperforms\nstate-of-the-art end-to-end approaches, reducing translation and rotation\nerrors by 50% and 21.6% on indoor datasets, and 35.56% and 38.7% on outdoor\ndatasets. We also validate the effectiveness of our method in dynamic driving\nscenarios under varying weather conditions. Notably, as data synthesis scales\nup, our method exhibits a growing ability to interpolate and extrapolate\ntraining data for localizing unseen views. Project Page:\nhttps://ai4ce.github.io/RAP/",

Recent advances in integrated\nphotonics, specifically the development of ultra-low loss silicon nitride\n(Si$_3$N$_4$) platform, have allowed attaining performance that exceeds\nconventional legacy laser systems, including the phase noise of fiber lasers.\nThis platform can moreover be combined with monolithic integration of\npiezoelectrical materials, enabling frequency agile low noise lasers.

Here we overcome this challenge and\ndemonstrate a fully integrated laser based on the Si$_3$N$_4$ platform with\nfrequency noise lower than that of a fiber laser, while maintaining the\ncapability for high-speed modulation of the laser frequency. The laser achieves\nan output power of 30 mW with an integrated linewidth of 4.3 kHz and an\nintrinsic linewidth of 3 Hz, demonstrating phase noise performance that is on\npar with or lower than commercial fiber lasers. Frequency agility is\naccomplished via a monolithically integrated piezoelectric aluminum nitride\n(AlN) micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) actuator, which enables a flat\nfrequency actuation bandwidth extending up to 400 kHz. This combination of\nultra-low noise and frequency agility is a useful feature enabling tight laser\nlocking for frequency metrology, fiber sensing, and coherent sensing\napplications.

The\nkey idea of these methods is to incorporate reference subject information\nwithin the attention layer. However, existing methods still obtain suboptimal\nperformance when handling numerous subjects. This paper reveals two primary\nissues contributing to this deficiency. Firstly, the undesired internal\nattraction between different subjects within the target image can lead to the\nconvergence of multiple subjects into a single entity. Secondly, tokens tend to\nreference nearby tokens, which reduces the effectiveness of the attention\nmechanism when there is a significant positional difference between subjects in\nreference and target images. To address these issues, we propose a\ntraining-free diffusion model with Isolation and Reposition Attention, named\nIR-Diffusion. Specifically, Isolation Attention ensures that multiple subjects\nin the target image do not reference each other, effectively eliminating the\nsubject convergence. On the other hand, Reposition Attention involves scaling\nand repositioning subjects in both reference and target images to the same\nposition within the images. This ensures that subjects in the target image can\nbetter reference those in the reference image, thereby maintaining better\nconsistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IR-Diffusion significantly\nenhances multi-subject consistency, outperforming all existing methods in\nopen-domain scenarios.",

The traditional convergence theory for both monotone\nand nonmonotone variants replies heavily on the assumption of global Lipschitz\ncontinuity of the gradient of the smooth part of the objective function. Recent\nwork has shown that monotone proximal gradient methods converge globally only\nwhen the local (rather than global) Lipschitz continuity is assumed, provided\nthat the Kurdyka--{\\L}ojasiewicz (KL) property holds.

    "abstract": "The properties of dilute neutron matter are mostly determined by the s-wave\ntwo-body (2N) interaction, while three-body (3N) interactions are suppressed by\nthe Pauli principle. In a previous work, we showed that it can be advantageous\nto use renormalization group based effective interactions with cutoffs scaled\nwith the Fermi momentum, especially at low densities. In that case, induced 3N\ninteractions may become important. In this work, we compute the 3N interaction\ninduced by the similarity renormalization group flow of the s-wave 2N\ninteraction. We work in the momentum-space hyperspherical partial wave basis\nand investigate its convergence properties. Then we study the effect of the\ninduced 3N interaction on the equation of state of dilute neutron matter. We\nobserve that the cutoff dependence of the equation of state is strongly reduced\nwhen the effect of induced 3N interaction is included.",

This paper proposes a new coded caching problem,\nreferred to as Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-assisted\nmultiple-antenna coded caching, which is composed of a server with multiple\nantennas and some single-antenna cache-aided users. Different from the existing\nmulti-antenna coded caching problems, we introduce a passive RIS (with limited\nnumber of units) into the systems to further increase the multicast gain (i.e.,\ndegrees of freedom (DoF)) in the transmission, which is done by using\nRIS-assisted interference nulling. That is, by using RIS, we can `erase' any\npath between one transmission antenna and one receive antenna. We first propose\na new RIS-assisted interference nulling approach to search for the phase-shift\ncoefficients of RIS for the sake of interference nulling, which converges\nfaster than the state-of-the-art algorithm. After erasing some paths in each\ntime slot, the delivery can be divided into several non-overlapping groups\nincluding transmission antennas and users, where in each group the transmission\nantennas serve the contained users without suffering interference from the\ntransmissions by other groups. The division of groups for the sake of\nmaximizing the DoF could be formulated into a combinatorial optimization\nproblem.

Our pipeline introduces three innovative\ncomponents. First, the ID-refined QR integration (IDQR) seamlessly intertwines\nthe background styling with face ID, utilizing a unified Stable Diffusion\n(SD)-based framework with control networks. Second, the ID-aware QR ReShuffle\n(IDRS) effectively rectifies the conflicts between face IDs and QR patterns,\nrearranging QR modules to maintain the integrity of facial features without\ncompromising scannability. Lastly, the ID-preserved Scannability Enhancement\n(IDSE) markedly boosts scanning robustness through latent code optimization,\nstriking a delicate balance between face ID, aesthetic quality and QR\nfunctionality. In comprehensive experiments, Face2QR demonstrates remarkable\nperformance, outperforming existing approaches, particularly in preserving\nfacial recognition features within custom QR code designs.

    "abstract": "Although a significant number satellites are deemed essential for\nfacilitating diverse applications of satellite networks, aerial platforms are\nemerging as excellent alternatives for enabling reliable communications with\nfewer satellites. In scenarios with sparse satellite networks, aerial platforms\nparticipate in downlink communications, serving effectively as relays and\nproviding comparable or even superior coverage compared to a large number of\nsatellites. This paper explores the role of aerial platforms in assisting\ndownlink communications, emphasizing their potential as an alternative to dense\nsatellite networks. Firstly, we account for the space-time interconnected\nmovement of satellites in orbits by establishing a stochastic geometry\nframework based on an isotropic satellite Cox point process. Using this model,\nwe evaluate space-and-time performance metrics such as the number of orbits,\nthe number of communicable satellites, and the connectivity probability,\nprimarily assessing the geometric impact of aerial platforms. Subsequently, we\nanalyze signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) coverage probability, end-to-end\nthroughput, and association delay. Through examination of these performance\nmetrics, we explicitly demonstrate how aerial platforms enhance downlink\ncommunications by improving various key network performance metrics that would\nhave been achieved only by many satellites, thereby assessing their potential\nas an excellent alternative to dense satellite networks.",

    "abstract": "3D scene understanding has become an essential area of research with\napplications in autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality. Recently,\n3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful approach, combining\nexplicit modeling with neural adaptability to provide efficient and detailed\nscene representations. However, three major challenges remain in leveraging\n3DGS for scene understanding: 1) an imbalance between appearance and semantics,\nwhere dense Gaussian usage for fine-grained texture modeling does not align\nwith the minimal requirements for semantic attributes; 2) inconsistencies\nbetween appearance and semantics, as purely appearance-based Gaussians often\nmisrepresent object boundaries; and 3) reliance on top-down instance\nsegmentation methods, which struggle with uneven category distributions,\nleading to over- or under-segmentation. In this work, we propose\nInstanceGaussian, a method that jointly learns appearance and semantic features\nwhile adaptively aggregating instances. Our contributions include: i) a novel\nSemantic-Scaffold-GS representation balancing appearance and semantics to\nimprove feature representations and boundary delineation; ii) a progressive\nappearance-semantic joint training strategy to enhance stability and\nsegmentation accuracy; and iii) a bottom-up, category-agnostic instance\naggregation approach that addresses segmentation challenges through farthest\npoint sampling and connected component analysis. Our approach achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in category-agnostic, open-vocabulary 3D\npoint-level segmentation, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed\nrepresentation and training strategies.

The latter class of estimators can be seen as\nperturbations of the classical Black-Scholes model. The comparison between\nparametric and Hermite-based models having the same \"degrees of freedom\" is\nemphasized. The main criterion is the out-of-sample relative pricing error on a\ndataset of historical option prices on the S&P500 index. Prior to the main\nempirical study, the approximation of variance-gamma and Heston densities by\nseries of Hermite functions is studied, providing explicit expressions for the\ncoefficients of the expansion in the former case, and integral expressions\ninvolving the explicit characteristic function in the latter case. Moreover,\nthese approximations are investigated numerically on a few test cases,\nindicating that expansions in Hermite functions with few terms achieve\ncompetitive accuracy in the estimation of Heston densities and the pricing of\n(European) options, but they perform less effectively with variance-gamma\ndensities. On the other hand, the main large-scale empirical study show that\nparsimonious Hermite estimators can even outperform the Heston model in terms\nof pricing errors. These results underscore the trade-offs inherent in model\nselection and calibration, and their empirical fit in practical applications.",

Employing a user-centered design approach, we developed the\nchatbot using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, which enables\nbehavior personalization without retraining the underlying language model\n(GPT-4). The system leverages document retrieval and specialized prompts to\ntailor interactions, drawing from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and\nnarrative therapy techniques. A key challenge in the development process was\nthe difficulty of translating declarative knowledge into effective interaction\nbehaviors. In the initial phase, the chatbot was provided with declarative\nknowledge about CBT via reference textbooks and high-level conversational\ngoals. However, this approach resulted in imprecise and inefficient behavior,\nas the GPT model struggled to convert static information into dynamic and\ncontextually appropriate interactions. This highlighted the limitations of\nrelying solely on declarative knowledge to guide chatbot behavior, particularly\nin nuanced, therapeutic conversations. Over four iterations, we addressed this\nissue by gradually transitioning towards procedural knowledge, refining the\nchatbot's interaction strategies, and improving its overall effectiveness. In\nthe final evaluation, 5 participants engaged with the chatbot over five\nconsecutive days, receiving individualized CBT interventions. The Self-Report\nHabit Index (SRHI) was used to measure habit strength before and after the\nintervention, revealing a reduction in habit strength post-intervention.

    "abstract": "Currently, two optical processes are mainly used to realize single photon\nsources: deterministic transitions in a semiconductor quantum dot (QD) placed\nin a microcavity and spontaneous frequency down-conversion in materials with\nintrinsic nonlinearity. In this work, we consider another approach that\ncombines the advantages of both, such as high power with on-demand generation\nfrom QDs and the possibility of frequency tuning from nonlinear sources. For\nthis purpose, we use stimulated frequency down-conversion occurring directly in\nthe QD inside a microcavity designed not to the exciton frequency in the QD but\nto the target single photon frequency, which is set by the difference between\nthe exciton resonance and the stimulating laser energies. This down-conversion\narises from the second-order nonlinear interaction of an exciton (bright\nheavy-hole or dark) and a light-hole exciton in the stimulating laser field. We\npresent an analytical model for such a down-conversion process and evaluate its\nefficiency for a widely sought-after single photon source for the telecom\nC-band (1530-1565 nm). We show that the emission rate of down-converted single\nphotons can approach MHz. At certain conditions, this process is comparable in\nefficiency to direct emission from an InAs/GaAs QD at 920 nm, which is outside\nthe cavity mode.",

However, due to the\ncentrosymmetric nature of these crystals, spin degeneracy persists throughout\ntheir electronic band structures, limiting their potential for spintronic\napplications. By modifying the chalcogen ($X$) atoms in the TMDCs ML surface to\ncreate a higly stable Janus $MXX'$ MLs structure, we demonstrate through\ndensity-functional theory calculations that substantial spin splitting of the\nelectronic states can be achieved. Taking the Janus $1T'$ WSTe ML as a\nrepresentative case, we identify pronounced anisotropic spin-splitting bands,\nwith maximum spin splittings of 0.14 eV and 0.10 eV occurring at the highest\noccupied states and lowest unoccupied states, respectively. These significant\nband splittings give rise to canted persistent spin textures (PST) in the spin\npolarization, which differ significantly from those in commonly studied PST\nmaterials. We demonstrate that this intricate spin splitting and unique spin\ntextures stem from strong in-plane $p-d$ orbital interactions between tungsten\n(W) and the chalcogen atoms (Te and Se), driven by the reduced symmetry of the\ncrystal's point group. Further analysis using a $\\vec{k}\\cdot\\vec{p}$ model\nderived from symmetry considerations corroborates the origins of the observed\nanisotropic spin splitting and canted PST. the spin-split states are highly\nsensitive to surface imperfections caused by surface alloying effects, such as\nvariations in the chalcogen composition on the monolayer surface. These\nfindings underscore the potential of Janus $1T'$ $MXX'$ MLs as promising\ncandidates for next-generation spintronic devices.",

One of these\napplications, namely voice-based pathology, has yet to receive notable\nattention from academia and industry. Applying voice analysis to early\ndetection of fatal diseases holds much promise to improve health outcomes and\nquality of life of patients. In this paper, we propose a novel application of\nacoustic machine learning based triaging into commoditised conversational\nvirtual assistant systems to pre-screen for onset of diabetes.

Our triaging system achieved\nhit-rates of 70% and 60% for male and female older adult subjects,\nrespectively. Our proposed triaging uses 7 non-identifiable voice-based\nfeatures and can operate within resource-constrained embedded systems running\nvoice-based virtual assistants.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown exceptional performance across\nvarious Data-to-Text Generation (DTG) tasks. However, generating factually\nconsistent text in DTG remains challenging for LLMs. Despite this, in-depth\nevaluations of LLM factual consistency for DTG remain missing in the current\nliterature. This paper addresses this gap by providing an extensive evaluation\nof factual consistency in LLMs for DTG. Our evaluation covers five widely used\nDTG datasets (E2E, ViGGo, WikiTableText, DART, and WebNLG) and five prominent\nLLM families (T5, BART, OPT, BLOOM, and Llama 2). To ensure a thorough\nevaluation of factual consistency, we use four state-of-the-art automatic\nmetrics and include essential human assessments. Our extensive evaluations\nreveals three key findings regarding factual consistency in LLMs for DTG.\nFirst, Llama 2 often excels in generating factually consistent text, although\nsmaller models like T5 and BART can achieve strong factual consistency on\nlarger, lexically less-diverse datasets. Second, the average rate of change\n(AROC) indicates that increasing model size (number of model trainable\nparameters) generally enhances factual consistency of LLMs in DTG. Third, we\nobserve that source-reference divergence (i.e., when the reference text\ndiverges semantically from the source) typically reduces the factual\nconsistency of LLMs in DTG.",

We show how a multiset determining only $k$ special\ndirections, in a modular sense, gives rise to a codeword whose support can be\ncovered by $k$ concurrent lines. The reverse operation of going from a codeword\nto a multiset of points is trickier, but we describe a possible strategy and\nshow some fruitful applications.\n  Given a multiset of affine points, we use a bound on the degree of its\nso-called projection function to yield lower bounds on the number of special\ndirections, both in an ordinary and in a modular sense.\n  In the codes related to projective planes of prime order $p$, there exists an\nodd codeword, whose support is covered by 3 concurrent lines, but which is not\na linear combination of these 3 lines. We generalise this codeword to codewords\nwhose support is contained in an arbitrary number of concurrent lines.

To resolve critical features in the flow, adaptive mesh\nrefinement (AMR) is routinely employed in certain regions of the computational\ndomain, where gradients or error estimates of the solution are often considered\nas the refining criteria. In many scenarios, however, these indicators can lead\nto unnecessary refinement over a large region, making the process a matter of\ntrial and error and resulting in slow convergence of the computation. To this\nend, we propose a heuristic strategy that employs the residuals of the\ngoverning partial differential equations (PDEs) as a novel criterion to\nadaptively guide the mesh refining process. In particular, we leverage on the\nphysics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to integrate imprecise data obtained\non a coarse mesh and the governing PDEs. Once trained, PINNs are capable of\nidentifying regions of highest residuals of the Navier-Stokes/Euler equations\nand suggesting new potential vertices for the coarse mesh cells. Moreover, we\nput forth two schemes to maintain the quality of the refined mesh through the\nstrategic insertion of vertices and the implementation of Delaunay\ntriangulation. By applying the residuals-guided AMR to address a multitude of\ntypical incompressible/compressible flow problems and comparing the outcomes\nwith those of gradient-based methods, we illustrate that the former effectively\nattains a favorable balance between the computational accuracy and cost.",

However, while research has mostly\nfocused on driving the accuracy of models in nominal settings, addressing\nscenarios with difficult lighting conditions and high-speed motions remains out\nof reach due to the limitations of the sensor. This work addresses this\nchallenge with the first event camera-based TAP method. It leverages the high\ntemporal resolution and high dynamic range of event cameras for robust\nhigh-speed tracking, and the global contexts in TAP methods to handle\nasynchronous and sparse event measurements. We further extend the TAP framework\nto handle event feature variations induced by motion -- thereby addressing an\nopen challenge in purely event-based tracking -- with a novel feature-alignment\nloss which ensures the learning of motion-robust features. Our method is\ntrained with data from a new data generation pipeline and systematically\nablated across all design decisions. Our method shows strong cross-dataset\ngeneralization and performs 136% better on the average Jaccard metric than the\nbaselines.

The act of moving heavy\nmechanical structures can lead to the development of cracks, bending, and/or\ndisplacements of components from their optimal optical positions. This, in\nturn, diminishes the overall performance of the entire system for energy\ncapture. In this context, we introduce two combinatorial optimization problems\nto limit the number of tracking steps of the collector and hence the risk of\nfailure incidents and contaminant leaks. On the one hand, the Minimum Tracking\nMotion (MTM)-Problem aims at detecting the minimum number of movements while\nmaintaining the production within a given range. On the other hand, the Maximal\nEnergy Collection (MEC)-Problem aims to achieve optimal energy production\nwithin a predetermined number of movements. Both problems are solved assuming\nscenarios where the energy collection function contains any number of local\nmaximum/minimum due to optical errors of the elements in the PTCsystem. The\nMTM- and MEC-Problems are solved in O(n) time and O(n2mw*) time, respectively,\nbeing n the number of steps in the energy collection function, m the maximum\nnumber of movements of the solar structure, and w* the maximal amplitude angle\nthat the structure can cover. The advantages of the solutions are shown in\nrealistic experiments. While these problems can be solved in polynomial time,\nwe establish the NP-hardness of a slightly modified version of the MEC-Problem.\nThe proposed algorithms are generic and can be adapted to schedule solar\ntracking in other CSP systems.",

Methods and Materials: The whole\nabdomen of C57BL/6 mice was irradiated with 6 MeV electron beam. The endpoint\nwas acute intestinal toxicity quantified by histological score. Total doses\nranging from 6 to 15 Gy were evaluated. The impact of the mean dose rate (MDR)\nwas assessed in the range of 40 to 900 Gy/s. Dose per pulse (DPP) of 0.5 Gy and\n3 Gy were compared. The recombination of peroxyl radicals were simulated.\nFurther comparisons were conducted by incorporating the antioxidant amifostine.\nResults: When varying total doses with a constant MDR of 900 Gy/s, the FLASH\neffect was not observed until the dose reached 15 Gy. For a total dose of 15 Gy\nand varying MDR, the FLASH effect was observed only when MDR reached 100 Gy/s.\nFor a dose of 15 Gy and an MDR of 150 Gy/s, no significant difference in\nbiological effect was observed between low DPP and high DPP. The simulation\nresults indicated that the fraction of peroxyl radicals recombination remained\nnearly zero at conventional dose rates. For FLASH irradiation, the\nrecombination fraction increased linearly with the dose. Notably, the dose\ndelivery time corresponding to 50% change in the recombination fraction was\napproximately 300 ms. The addition of amifostine effectively eliminated the\ndifference between FLASH group and CONV group. Conclusions: The critical\nrequirement for observing the sparing effect at the biological endpoint is the\nadministration of an adequate dose within the time window of the radical\nreaction. Additionally, the important role of free radical was verified after\nintroducing antioxidants, suggesting that the generation and recombination of\nfree radicals are pivotal factors influencing the FLASH sparing effect.",

We consider a doubly-regularized RL framework that combines reward\nand parameter regularization to address these constraints within continuous\nstate-action spaces.

We provide general conditions on regularization functions,\nencompassing standard entropy regularization as a special case.

Incomplete understanding of sources of measurement uncertainty\ncan make it difficult to distinguish autofluorescence and background sources\nfrom signals of interest. Moreover, established methods for modeling\nuncertainty overlook the fact that the apparent distribution of measurements is\na convolution of the inherent the population variability (e.g., associated with\ncalibration beads or cells) and instrument induced-effects. Such issues make it\ndifficult, for example, to identify signals from small objects such as\nextracellular vesicles. To overcome such limitations, we formulate an explicit\nprobabilistic measurement model that accounts for volume and labeling\nvariation, background signals and fluorescence shot noise. Using raw data from\nroutine per-event calibration measurements, we use this model to separate the\naforementioned sources of uncertainty and demonstrate how such information can\nbe used to facilitate decision-making and instrument characterization.",

    "abstract": "Real-world traffic involves diverse road users, ranging from pedestrians to\nheavy trucks, necessitating effective road user classification for various\napplications within Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS). Traditional approaches\noften rely on intrusive and/or expensive external hardware sensors. These\nsystems typically have limited spatial coverage. In response to these\nlimitations, this work aims to investigate an unintrusive and cost-effective\nalternative for road user classification by using high-frequency (1-2 Hz)\npositional sequences. A cutting-edge solution could involve leveraging\npositioning data from 5G networks. However, this feature is currently only\nproposed in the 3GPP standard and has not yet been implemented for outdoor\napplications by 5G equipment vendors. Therefore, our approach relies on\npositional data, that is recorded under real-world conditions using Global\nNavigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and processed on distributed edge devices.\nAs a start-ing point, four types of road users are distinguished: pedestri-ans,\ncyclists, motorcycles, and passenger cars. While earlier approaches used\nclassical statistical methods, we propose Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)\nrecurrent neural networks (RNNs) as the preferred classification method, as\nthey repre-sent state-of-the-art in processing sequential data. An RNN\narchitecture for road user classification, based on selected motion\ncharacteristics derived from raw positional sequences is presented and the\ninfluence of sequence length on classifica-tion quality is examined. The\nresults of the work show that RNNs are capable of efficiently classifying road\nusers on dis-tributed devices, and can particularly differentiate between types\nof motorized vehicles, based on two- to four-minute se-quences.",

Recent advances in single-image depth estimation, brought\nabout by the rise of large foundation models and the use of synthetic training\ndata, have fueled a renewed interest in video depth. However, naively applying\na single-image depth estimator to every frame of a video disregards temporal\ncontinuity, which not only leads to flickering but may also break when camera\nmotion causes sudden changes in depth range. An obvious and principled solution\nwould be to build on top of video foundation models, but these come with their\nown limitations; including expensive training and inference, imperfect 3D\nconsistency, and stitching routines for the fixed-length (short) outputs. We\ntake a step back and demonstrate how to turn a single-image latent diffusion\nmodel (LDM) into a state-of-the-art video depth estimator. Our model, which we\ncall RollingDepth, has two main ingredients: (i) a multi-frame depth estimator\nthat is derived from a single-image LDM and maps very short video snippets\n(typically frame triplets) to depth snippets. (ii) a robust, optimization-based\nregistration algorithm that optimally assembles depth snippets sampled at\nvarious different frame rates back into a consistent video. RollingDepth is\nable to efficiently handle long videos with hundreds of frames and delivers\nmore accurate depth videos than both dedicated video depth estimators and\nhigh-performing single-frame models.

    "abstract": "An automatically differentiable, high-order non-oscillatory finite volume\nshallow water dynamic core has been constructed on a cubed sphere grid. This\ndynamic core has four advantageous properties: high order accuracy, essential\nnon-oscillation, mass conservation, and scalability. Besides, the code\ndevelopment is based on PyTorch, enabling the model to run seamlessly on both\nCPU and GPU, while naturally possessing the capability of automatic\ndifferentiation. We named the new dynamic core as High Order Prediction\nEnvironment (HOPE). The spatial reconstruction is based on the two-dimensional\ntensor product polynomial (TPP) and the genuine two-dimensional Weighted\nEssentially Non-Oscillatory scheme. A novel panel boundary approach ensures\nthat the accuracy can reach arbitrary order. These algorithms have very high\ndegree of compatibility with GPU architecture, allowing the computational\noverhead to be mitigated through the utilization of GPU. The Low Mach number\nApproximate Riemann Solver scheme is adopted as Riemann solvers to determine\nfluxes on the Gaussian points on edges. Flux across the interface between each\ncell edge is computed using Gaussian quadrature, and the tendencies of\nprognostic variables are obtained by integration all the source terms and the\nfluxes across the cell boundaries. This shallow water dynamic core exhibits\noutstanding performance in ideal shallow water test cases. In the steady-state\ngeostrophic flow, the 11th order scheme reduces errors to nearly double\nprecision round-off error even on coarse grids. Furthermore, HOPE maintains the\nRossby-Haurwitz wave over 100 days without collapse. To test the\nnon-oscillation property, we designed a cylinder dam break case, the WENO\napproach effectively suppresses non-physical oscillation, and the genuine\ntwo-dimensional reconstruction exhibits significantly better isotropy than the\ndimension-by-dimension scheme.",

    "abstract": "Forecasting accuracy in highly uncertain environments is challenging due to\nthe stochastic nature of systems. Deterministic forecasting provides only point\nestimates and cannot capture potential outcomes. Therefore, probabilistic\nforecasting has gained significant attention due to its ability to quantify\nuncertainty, where one of the approaches is to express it as a prediction\ninterval (PI), that explicitly shows upper and lower bounds of predictions\nassociated with a confidence level. High-quality PI is characterized by a high\nPI coverage probability (PICP) and a narrow PI width. In many real-world\napplications, the PI width is generally used in risk management to prepare\nresources that improve reliability and effectively manage uncertainty. A wider\nPI width results in higher costs for backup resources as decision-making\nprocesses often focus on the worst-case scenarios arising with large PI widths\nunder extreme conditions. This study aims to reduce the large PI width from the\nPI estimation method by proposing a new PI loss function that penalizes the\naverage of the large PI widths more heavily. The proposed formulation is\ncompatible with gradient-based algorithms, the standard approach to training\nneural networks (NNs), and integrating state-of-the-art NNs and existing deep\nlearning techniques. Experiments with the synthetic dataset reveal that our\nformulation significantly reduces the large PI width while effectively\nmaintaining the PICP to achieve the desired probability. The practical\nimplementation of our proposed loss function is demonstrated in solar\nirradiance forecasting, highlighting its effectiveness in minimizing the large\nPI width in data with high uncertainty and showcasing its compatibility with\nmore complex neural network models.

We present the first BNS merger simulations employing a moment-based\ngeneral-relativistic neutrino transport with five neutrino species, thus\nincluding (anti)muons and advanced muonic $\\beta$-processes, and contrast them\nwith traditional three-neutrino-species simulations. Our results show that a\nmuonic trapped-neutrino equilibrium is established, forming a different\ntrapped-neutrino hierarchy akin to the electronic equilibrium. The formation of\n(anti)muons and the muonization via muonic $\\beta$-processes enhance the\nneutrino luminosity, leading to rapid cooling in the early postmerger phase.\nSince muonic processes redirect part of the energy otherwise used for\nprotonization by electronic processes, they yield a cooler remnant and disk,\ntogether with neutrino-driven winds that are more neutron-rich. Importantly,\nthe unbound ejected mass is smaller than three-species simulations, and,\nbecause of its comparatively smaller temperature and proton fraction, it can\nenhance lanthanide production and reduce the overproduction of light\n$r$-process elements for softer equations of state. This finding underlines the\nimportance of muonic interactions and five neutrino species in long-lived BNS\nremnants.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, a wide range of mortality models has been proposed to\naddress the diverse factors influencing mortality rates, which has highlighted\nthe need to perform model selection. Traditional mortality model selection\nmethods, such as AIC and BIC, often require fitting multiple models\nindependently and ranking them based on these criteria. This process can fail\nto account for uncertainties in model selection, which can lead to overly\noptimistic prediction interval, and it disregards the potential insights from\ncombining models. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Bayesian\nmodel selection framework that integrates model selection and parameter\nestimation into the same process. This requires creating a model building\nframework that will give rise to different models by choosing different\nparametric forms for each term. Inference is performed using the reversible\njump Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, which is devised to allow for\ntransition between models of different dimensions, as is the case for the\nmodels considered here. We develop modelling frameworks for data stratified by\nage and period and for data stratified by age, period and product. Our results\nare presented in two case studies.",

This thesis investigates\nthe robustness of blockchain protocols, specifically focusing on Ethereum\nProof-of-Stake. We define robustness in terms of two critical properties:\nSafety, which ensures that the blockchain will not have permanent conflicting\nblocks, and Liveness, which guarantees the continuous addition of new reliable\nblocks.\n  Our research addresses the gap between traditional distributed systems\napproaches, which classify agents as either honest or Byzantine (i.e.,\nmalicious or faulty), and game-theoretic models that consider rational agents\ndriven by incentives. We explore how incentives impact the robustness with both\napproaches.\n  The thesis comprises three distinct analyses. First, we formalize the\nEthereum PoS protocol, defining its properties and examining potential\nvulnerabilities through a distributed systems perspective. We identify that\ncertain attacks can undermine the system's robustness. Second, we analyze the\ninactivity leak mechanism, a critical feature of Ethereum PoS, highlighting its\nrole in maintaining system liveness during network disruptions but at the cost\nof safety. Finally, we employ game-theoretic models to study the strategies of\nrational validators within Ethereum PoS, identifying conditions under which\nthese agents might deviate from the prescribed protocol to maximize their\nrewards.\n  Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the importance of\nincentive mechanisms for blockchain robustness and provide insights into\ndesigning more resilient blockchain protocols.",

Previously, observations of deuterated molecules have been\nlimited to the Galaxy, the Magellanic Clouds and (with respect to HD) to quasar\nabsorption spectra. We present the first robust detection of a deuterated\nmolecule in a starburst environment and, besides HD, the first one detected\noutside the Local Group. We therefore can constrain the deuterium\nfractionation, as observed by DCN. We observed the CMZ of the nearby starburst\ngalaxy NGC 253 covering multiple Giant Molecular Clouds (GMC) with cloud scale\nobservations ($\\sim 30$ pc) using ALMA. Via the use of the \\texttt{MADCUBA}\npackage we were able to perform LTE analysis in order to obtain deuterium\nfractionation estimates. We detect DCN in the nuclear region of the starburst\ngalaxy NGC 253 and estimate the deuterium fractionation (D/H ratio) of DCN\nwithin the GMCs of the CMZ of NGC 253. We find a range of $5 \\times 10^{-4}$ to\n$10 \\times 10^{-4}$, relatively similar to the values observed in warm Galactic\nstar-forming regions. We also determine an upper limit of D/H of $8 \\times\n10^{-5}$ from DCO\\plus within one region, closer to the cosmic value of D/H.\nOur observations of deuterated molecules within NGC 253 appear to be consistent\nwith previous galactic studies of star forming regions. This implies that\nwarmer gas temperatures increase the abundance of DCN relative to other\ndeuterated species. This study also further expands the regions, particularly\nin the extragalactic domain, in which deuterated species have been detected.",

Notably, this family includes the uniform\ndistribution on a product of Euclidean balls of varying dimensions as a key\nexample. As $n\\to\\infty$, we establish explicit growth rates for the expected\nnumber of facets, which depend in a subtle way on the the underlying model\nparameters. For the case of the uniform distribution, we further examine the\nexpected number of faces of arbitrary dimensions as well as the volume\ndifference. Our findings reveal that the family of random polytopes we\nintroduce exhibits novel interpolative properties, bridging the gap between the\nclassical extremal cases observed in the behavior of random polytopes within\nsmooth versus polytopal convex containers.",

However, the world in which we live is dynamic, characterized by\nnumerous interactions between the environment and humans or robotic agents.\nStatic semantic maps are unable to capture this information, and the naive\nsolution of rescanning the environment after every change is both costly and\nineffective in tracking e.g. objects being stored away in drawers. With Lost &\nFound we present an approach that addresses this limitation. Based solely on\negocentric recordings with corresponding hand position and camera pose\nestimates, we are able to track the 6DoF poses of the moving object within the\ndetected interaction interval. These changes are applied online to a\ntransformable scene graph that captures object-level relations. Compared to\nstate-of-the-art object pose trackers, our approach is more reliable in\nhandling the challenging egocentric viewpoint and the lack of depth\ninformation. It outperforms the second-best approach by 34% and 56% for\ntranslational and orientational error, respectively, and produces visibly\nsmoother 6DoF object trajectories. In addition, we illustrate how the acquired\ninteraction information in the dynamic scene graph can be employed in the\ncontext of robotic applications that would otherwise be unfeasible: We show how\nour method allows to command a mobile manipulator through teach & repeat, and\nhow information about prior interaction allows a mobile manipulator to retrieve\nan object hidden in a drawer.

For linear advection equations, it is inherently stable but\ngenerally not bound preserving. To satisfy discrete maximum principles and\nensure entropy stability in the nonlinear case, we use limiters adapted to the\nstructure of our locally conservative EG method. The cell averages are\nconstrained using a flux limiter, while the nodal values of the continuous\ncomponent are constrained using a clip-and-scale limiting strategy for\nantidiffusive element contributions. The design and analysis of our new\nalgorithms build on recent advances in the fields of convex limiting and\nalgebraic entropy fixes for finite element methods.

Furthermore, generalizable models for image editing with visual\ninstructions typically require quad data, i.e., a before-after image pair,\nalong with query and target images.

Given that F-theory compactifications on elliptic CY 3-folds\nare a subset, this provides a bound on the Hodge numbers of elliptic CY\n3-folds: $h^{1,1}({\\rm CY_3})\\leq 491$, $h^{1,1}({\\rm Base})\\leq 194$ which are\nsaturated by special elliptic CY 3-folds.

Firstly we examine 30 climate model simulations (using the\nssp5-8.5 scenario) from the CMIP6 archive and show that models that present a\nmore substantial AMOC decline exhibit an equatorward shift of the ascending\nbranch of the Atlantic regional Hadley circulation, resulting in a southward\ndisplacement of the ITCZ.

    "abstract": "An algorithm for planning near time-optimal trajectories for systems with an\noscillatory internal dynamics has been developed in previous work. It is based\non assembling a complete trajectory from motion primitives called jerk\nsegments, which are the time-optimal solution to an optimization problem. To\nachieve the shortest overall transition time, it is advantageous to recompute\nthese segments for different acceleration levels within the motion planning\nprocedure. This publication presents a numerical calculation method enabling\nfast and reliable calculation. This is achieved by explicitly evaluating the\noptimality conditions that arise for the problem, and further by reducing the\nevaluation of these conditions to a line-search problem on a bounded interval.\nThis reduction guarantees, that a valid solution if found after a fixed number\nof computational steps, making the calculation time constant and predictable.\nFurthermore, the algorithm does not rely on optimisation algorithms, which\nallowed its implementation on a laboratory system for measurements with the\npurpose of validating the approach.",

These are the most accurate\nmodels supporting single H100 GPU inference with large batch sizes, despite\ntraining on 45B tokens at most, far fewer than the 15T used to train Llama-70B.\nLastly, we show that lightweight alignment on these derived models allows them\nto surpass the parent model in specific capabilities.

    "abstract": "This research presents the development of a new simulation model to determine\nthe optimal order lot sizes in Material Requirements Planning, based on\npurchase volume and the temporal deterioration of items. The scientific novelty\nlies in the exhaustive enumeration of all supply strategies, considering when\nand how much raw material and/or inputs to acquire while simultaneously\nmanaging multiple factors. The developed model enables obtaining and\nvisualizing all feasible solutions, though a significant challenge arises when\ndealing with larger planning horizons. The methodology includes formulating a\nmathematical equation to calculate the total cost of all supply strategies,\ntaking into account quantity discounts and the maximum allowable shelf life of\ninventory items. The results demonstrate that the model thoroughly explores the\nentire search space and identifies the optimal solution. Validation is\nconducted using the tabu search heuristic, a widely recognized optimization\ntechnique. While the heuristic converges toward the global minimum, it requires\na significantly higher computational load. In contrast, the developed model\nidentifies the global minimum with fewer calculations, showcasing its\nefficiency and accuracy.",

In this study, we\ninvestigate the epitaxial growth of FeSn thin films on GaAs(111) substrates by\nmolecular beam epitaxy. A significant challenge in this growth process is the\ndiffusion of Ga and As from the substrate into the deposited films and the\ndiffusion of Fe into the substrate.

Through a comprehensive analysis-including reflection high\nenergy electron diffraction, high-resolution X-ray diffraction, scanning\nelectron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and vibrating sample\nmagnetometry-we demonstrate that the Sn evaporation temperature plays a\ncritical role in influencing the crystallinity, surface morphology, and\nmagnetic behaviour of the films.

Any such deviation affects not only binary dynamics and\ngravitational-wave emission but also the structure and tidal properties of\ncompact objects. In the case of neutron stars, masses, radii, and tidal\ndeformabilities can all differ significantly between different theories of\ngravity. Currently, the measurement uncertainties in neutron star radii and\ntidal deformabilities are quite large. However, much less is known about how\nthe large uncertainty in the nuclear equation of state (EOS) might affect tests\nof GR using binary neutron star mergers. Conversely, using the wrong theory of\ngravity might lead to incorrect constraints on the nuclear EOS. Here, we study\nthis problem within scalar-tensor (ST) theory. We apply the recently derived\n$\\ell = 2$ tidal Love numbers in this theory to parameter estimation of\nGW170817. Correspondingly, we test if physics beyond GR could bias measurements\nof the nuclear EOS and neutron star radii. We find that parameter inference for\nboth the GR and ST cases return consistent component masses and tidal\ndeformabilities. The radius and the EOS posteriors, however, differ between the\ntwo theories, but neither is excluded by current observational limits. This\nindicates that measurements of the nuclear EOS may be biased and that\ndeviations from GR could go undetected when analyzing current binary neutron\nstar mergers.",

The level of magnetization of\nthe plasma, as well as the geometry of these fields on compact scales, have not\nyet been fully constrained. In this paper we employ multi-frequency and\nmulti-epoch very long baseline interferometry observations of the nearby radio\ngalaxy NGC 315. We aim to derive insights into the magnetic field properties on\nsub-parsec and parsec scales by examining observational signatures such as the\nspectral index, synchrotron turnover frequency, and brightness temperature\nprofiles. This analysis is performed by considering the properties of the jet\nacceleration and collimation zone, which can be probed thanks to the source\nvicinity, as well as the inner part of the jet conical region. We observe\nremarkably steep values for the spectral index on sub-parsec scales ($\\alpha\n\\sim -2$, $S_\\nu \\propto \\nu^\\alpha$) which flatten around $\\alpha \\sim -0.8$\non parsec scales. We suggest that the observed steep values may result from\nparticles being accelerated via diffusive shock acceleration mechanisms in\nmagnetized plasma and subsequently experiencing cooling through synchrotron\nlosses. The brightness temperature of the 43 GHz cores indicates a dominance of\nthe magnetic energy at the jet base, while the cores at progressively lower\nfrequencies reveal a gradual transition towards equipartition. Based on the\nspectral index and brightness temperature along the incoming jet, and by\nemploying theoretical models, we derive that the magnetic field strength has a\nclose-to-linear dependence with distance going from parsec scales up to the jet\napex. Overall, our findings are consistent with a toroidal-dominated magnetic\nfield on all the analyzed scales.",

Machine learning-based classification approaches\nrequire large amounts of training data and are most-commonly compared through\nthree established benchmark datasets, which include the Web Of Science (WOS),\nReuters Corpus Volume 1 Version 2 (RCV1-V2) and New York Times (NYT) datasets.\nHowever, apart from the RCV1-V2 dataset which is well-documented, these\ndatasets are not accompanied with detailed description methodologies. In this\npaper, we introduce three new HTC benchmark datasets in the domain of research\npublications which comprise the titles and abstracts of papers from the Web of\nScience publication database.

Given that one of the most prominent applications of flexoelectricity\nis in nano-electro-mechanical systems (NEMS), confirming the presence and\nmagnitude of the effect at these scales is essential. This study presents the\nfirst-ever measurements of flexoelectric-generated charges (direct effect) in\nnanoscale-thickness materials, using cantilevers with a 50 nm hafnium oxide\nlayer. We confirm that the estimated flexoelectric coefficient from said\nmeasurements aligns with the values obtained from complementary experiments\nusing the flexoelectric inverse effect. Additionally, by changing the\ncantilever geometry (modifying the width of the cantilevers), we demonstrate a\n40% increase in the effective flexoelectric coefficient, explained by the\ninterplay of different flexoelectric tensor components. These findings not only\nvalidate the presence of flexoelectric effects at the nanoscale but also open\nthe possibility for full flexoelectric transduction of the motion in NEMS/MEMS\ndevices.",

The\ncontinuous treatment of visual signals minimizes the information loss for both\nimage understanding and generation while the fully AR formulation renders the\ncharacterization of the correlation between modalities straightforward. The key\nmechanism enabling Orthus to leverage these advantages lies in its\nmodality-specific heads -- one regular language modeling (LM) head predicts\ndiscrete text tokens and one diffusion head generates continuous image features\nconditioning on the output of the backbone. We devise an efficient strategy for\nbuilding Orthus -- by substituting the Vector Quantization (VQ) operation in\nthe existing unified AR model with a soft alternative, introducing a diffusion\nhead, and tuning the added modules to reconstruct images, we can create an\nOrthus-base model effortlessly (e.g., within mere 72 A100 GPU hours).\nOrthus-base can further embrace post-training to better model interleaved\nimages and texts. Empirically, Orthus surpasses competing baselines including\nShow-o and Chameleon across standard benchmarks, achieving a GenEval score of\n0.58 and an MME-P score of 1265.8 using 7B parameters.

    "abstract": "As a fundamental backbone for video generation, diffusion models are\nchallenged by low inference speed due to the sequential nature of denoising.\nPrevious methods speed up the models by caching and reusing model outputs at\nuniformly selected timesteps. However, such a strategy neglects the fact that\ndifferences among model outputs are not uniform across timesteps, which hinders\nselecting the appropriate model outputs to cache, leading to a poor balance\nbetween inference efficiency and visual quality. In this study, we introduce\nTimestep Embedding Aware Cache (TeaCache), a training-free caching approach\nthat estimates and leverages the fluctuating differences among model outputs\nacross timesteps. Rather than directly using the time-consuming model outputs,\nTeaCache focuses on model inputs, which have a strong correlation with the\nmodeloutputs while incurring negligible computational cost. TeaCache first\nmodulates the noisy inputs using the timestep embeddings to ensure their\ndifferences better approximating those of model outputs. TeaCache then\nintroduces a rescaling strategy to refine the estimated differences and\nutilizes them to indicate output caching. Experiments show that TeaCache\nachieves up to 4.41x acceleration over Open-Sora-Plan with negligible (-0.07%\nVbench score) degradation of visual quality.",

    "abstract": "Product bundling aims to organize a set of thematically related items into a\ncombined bundle for shipment facilitation and item promotion. To increase the\nexposure of fresh or overstocked products, sellers typically bundle these items\nwith popular products for inventory clearance. This specific task can be\nformulated as a long-tail product bundling scenario, which leverages the\nuser-item interactions to define the popularity of each item. The inherent\npopularity bias in the pre-extracted user feedback features and the\ninsufficient utilization of other popularity-independent knowledge may force\nthe conventional bundling methods to find more popular items, thereby\nstruggling with this long-tail bundling scenario. Through intuitive and\nempirical analysis, we navigate the core solution for this challenge, which is\nmaximally mining the popularity-free features and effectively incorporating\nthem into the bundling process. To achieve this, we propose a Distilled\nModality-Oriented Knowledge Transfer framework (DieT) to effectively counter\nthe popularity bias misintroduced by the user feedback features and adhere to\nthe original intent behind the real-world bundling behaviors. Specifically,\nDieT first proposes the Popularity-free Collaborative Distribution Modeling\nmodule (PCD) to capture the popularity-independent information from the\nbundle-item view, which is proven most effective in the long-tail bundling\nscenario to enable the directional information transfer. With the tailored\nUnbiased Bundle-aware Knowledge Transferring module (UBT), DieT can highlight\nthe significance of popularity-free features while mitigating the negative\neffects of user feedback features in the long-tail scenario via the knowledge\ndistillation paradigm. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets\ndemonstrate the superiority of DieT over a list of SOTA methods in the\nlong-tail bundling scenario.",

Our\nunified presentation of results for horizontal and vertical interleaving is\nnovel and simplifies the recognition of resembling patterns.\n  This paper's main results are syndrome-based decoders for both VILRS and\nHILRS codes. We first consider an error-only setting and then present more\ngeneral error-erasure decoders, which can handle full errors, row erasures, and\ncolumn erasures simultaneously. Here, an erasure means that parts of the row\nspace or the column space of the error are already known before decoding. We\nincorporate this knowledge directly into Berlekamp--Massey-like key equations\nand thus decode all error types jointly. The presented error-only and\nerror-erasure decoders have an average complexity in $O(sn^2)$ and\n$\\widetilde{O}(sn^2)$ in most scenarios, where $s$ is the interleaving order\nand $n$ denotes the length of the component code.\n  Errors of sum-rank weight\n$\\tau=t_{\\mathcal{F}}+t_{\\mathcal{R}}+t_{\\mathcal{C}}$ consist of\n$t_{\\mathcal{F}}$ full errors, $t_{\\mathcal{R}}$ row erasures, and\n$t_{\\mathcal{C}}$ column erasures.

Although\nthe United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6 clearly defines\ntargets for universal access to clean water and sanitation, limitations in data\ncoverage and openness impede accurate tracking of progress in many countries.\nTo bridge these gaps, this study integrates Afrobarometer survey data,\nsatellite imagery from Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2, and advanced deep learning\ntechniques using Meta's self-supervised Distillation with No Labels (DINO)\nmodel to develop a modeling framework for evaluating access to piped water and\nsewage system across diverse African regions. The modeling framework achieved\nnotable accuracy, with over 96% for piped water and 97% for sewage system\naccess classification. When combined with geospatial population data,\nvalidation against official statistics from the United Nations Joint Monitoring\nProgram demonstrated high concordance at the national scale (R2 of 0.95 for\npiped water access and R2 of 0.85 for sewage system access). The national-level\nestimates can represent SDG Indicators 6.1.1 and 6.2.1. This approach provides\npolicymakers and stakeholders with an effective, scalable, and cost-efficient\ntool to pinpoint underserved areas requiring targeted intervention. The\nmethodology developed herein can be adapted for assessing other\ninfrastructure-related SDGs, promoting enhanced monitoring and informed\ndecision-making towards achieving global sustainability objectives.",

The proposed NWD retains the\nconventional window decoder (WD) process but incorporates trainable neural\nweights. To train the weights of NWD, we introduce two novel training\nstrategies. First, we restrict the loss function to target variable nodes (VNs)\nof the window, which prunes the neural network and accordingly enhances\ntraining efficiency. Second, we employ the active learning technique with a\nnormalized loss term to prevent the training process from biasing toward\nspecific training regions. Next, we develop a systematic method to derive\nnon-uniform schedules for the NWD based on the training results. We introduce\ntrainable damping factors that reflect the relative importance of check node\n(CN) updates. By skipping updates with less importance, we can omit\n$\\mathbf{41\\%}$ of CN updates without performance degradation compared to the\nconventional WD. Lastly, we address the error propagation problem inherent in\nSC-LDPC codes by deploying a complementary weight set, which is activated when\nan error is detected in the previous window. This adaptive decoding strategy\neffectively mitigates error propagation without requiring modifications to the\ncode and decoder structures.",

While studies suggested a non-native origin of Hercules stars due\nto the distinct chemical and kinematic features, previous studies focussed\nmainly on the Fe abundances. We adopt chemical data with abundances of elements\nfrom GALAH and APOGEE to seek further chemical implications on the origin. Our\nanalysis reveals that the low alpha population of the low angular momentum\nHercules group is significantly enhanced in iron-peak (Fe, Ni, Mn) and Odd-Z\n(Na, Al) elements, and slightly deficient in alpha elements (O, Ca, Ti)\ncompared to kinematically local stars. The super enhancement in iron-peak\nelements and deficiency in alpha elements support their origin from the outer\nthin bar in the inner Galaxy. Moreover, the enhancement in Na and Al indicates\nthese stars as the youngest stars in the old sequence from the inner thick\ndisc. Hence, the origin of these stars can be related to the outer bar region.\nThese chemical signatures require the underlying dynamical mechanism that forms\nthe Hercules group to be capable of transporting stars in the inner Galaxy out\nto the SNd.

    "abstract": "Cubic gauche nitrogen (cg-N) with a three-dimensional network of N-N single\nbonds attracted lots of attentions in last decades, since it theoretically has\nfive times larger energy than TNT. While, extreme environments of high pressure\nor plasma treatment were required in traditional routes. Quite recently, in\nvacuum or protective gas environments, a one-step synthesis route relying\nsolely on heating is reported giving the highest cg-N content. However,\ncorresponding mechanism is missing, which hinders the improvement of yield and\nthe development of simpler methods. Here, by treating KN3 in different gas\nenvironments, we find that moisture can prevent the transition from KN3 to\ncg-N. In a dry air environment at 260 ~ 300{\\deg}C, KN3 decomposes into K and\nN2, and charge transfer from K to KN3 can induce cg-N. Furthermore, by grinding\nor loading pressure on the mixture of KN3 with Li, Na, K, Cs, Ca, Mg and Al, we\nfind that elements with higher electronegativity, higher pressure and\ntemperature conditions are needed to induce cg-N, while grinding alone is\nsufficient for alkali metals even without heating, thus confirming the\ncharge-transfer mechanism. These findings provide guidance for the synthesis of\ncg-N under ambient conditions through metal-catalyzed polymerization of various\nazides.",

    "abstract": "Sub-seasonal wind speed forecasts provide valuable guidance for wind power\nsystem planning and operations, yet the forecast skills of surface winds\ndecrease sharply after two weeks. However, large-scale variables exhibit\ngreater predictability on this time scale. This study explores the potential of\nleveraging non-linear relationships between 500 hPa geopotential height (Z500)\nand surface wind speed to improve sub-seasonal wind speed forecast skills in\nEurope. Our proposed framework uses a Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) or a\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN) to regress surface wind speed from Z500.\nEvaluations on ERA5 reanalysis indicate that the CNN performs better due to its\nnon-linearity. Applying these models to sub-seasonal forecasts from the\nEuropean Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, various verification\nmetrics demonstrate the advantages of non-linearity. Yet, this is partly\nexplained by the fact that these statistical models are under-dispersive since\nthey explain only a fraction of the target variable variance. Introducing\nstochastic perturbations to represent the stochasticity of the unexplained part\nfrom the signal helps compensate for this issue. Results show that the\nperturbed CNN performs better than the perturbed MLR only in the first weeks,\nwhile the perturbed MLR's performance converges towards that of the perturbed\nCNN after two weeks. The study finds that introducing stochastic perturbations\ncan address the issue of insufficient spread in these statistical models, with\nimprovements from the non-linearity varying with the lead time of the\nforecasts.",

This work proposes a\nmulti-objective black-box backdoor attack in dual domains via evolutionary\nalgorithm (LADDER), the first instance of achieving multiple attack objectives\nsimultaneously by optimizing triggers without requiring prior knowledge about\nvictim model. In particular, we formulate LADDER as a multi-objective\noptimization problem (MOP) and solve it via multi-objective evolutionary\nalgorithm (MOEA). MOEA maintains a population of triggers with trade-offs among\nattack objectives and uses non-dominated sort to drive triggers toward optimal\nsolutions. We further apply preference-based selection to MOEA to exclude\nimpractical triggers. We state that LADDER investigates a new dual-domain\nperspective for trigger stealthiness by minimizing the anomaly between clean\nand poisoned samples in the spectral domain. Lastly, the robustness against\npreprocessing operations is achieved by pushing triggers to low-frequency\nregions. Extensive experiments comprehensively showcase that LADDER achieves\nattack effectiveness of at least 99%, attack robustness with 90.23% (50.09%\nhigher than state-of-the-art attacks on average), superior natural stealthiness\n(1.12x to 196.74x improvement) and excellent spectral stealthiness (8.45x\nenhancement) as compared to current stealthy attacks by the average $l_2$-norm\nacross 5 public datasets.",

    "abstract": "Context. Binary star systems allow us to study the planet formation process\nunder extreme conditions. In the early stages, these systems contain a\ncircumbinary disk and a disk around each star. To model the interactions\nbetween these disks in the frame of one of the stars, strong fictitious forces\nmust be included in the simulations. The original Fargo and the Fargo3D codes\nfail to correctly simulate such systems if the indirect term becomes too\nstrong.\n  Aims. We present a different way to compute the indirect term which, together\nwith a tensor artificial viscosity prescription, allows the Fargo code to\nsimulate the circumbinary disks in a non-inertial frame of reference. In this\nway, the Fargo code can be used to study interactions between circumstellar and\ncircumbinary disks.\n  Results. We find that updating the indirect term becomes relevant when the\nindirect term becomes stronger than the direct gravitational forces, which\noccurs for mass ratios of $q > 5\\%$. The default artificial viscosity used in\nthe Fargo code inherently produces artificial pressure in a non-inertial frame\nof reference even in the absence of shocks. This leads to artificial mass\nejection from the Hill sphere, starting at brown dwarf masses ($q > 1\\%$).\nThese problems can be mitigated by using a tensor artificial viscosity\nformulation. For high mass ratios, $q > 1\\%$, it is also becomes important to\ninitialize the disk in the center-of-mass frame. We expect our proposed changes\nto be relevant for other grid-based hydrodynamic codes where strong indirect\nterms occur, or for codes that use artificial viscosity.",

Although effective vaccines have been developed\nto mitigate severe symptoms, certain populations, particularly the elderly and\nthose with comorbidities, remain at high risk for severe outcomes and increased\nmortality. Consequently, early identification of the severity and clinical\noutcomes of the disease in these patients is vital to prevent adverse\nprognoses. Although traditional machine learning and deep learning models have\nbeen widely employed in this area, the potential of large language models\n(LLMs) remains largely unexplored. Our research focuses primarily on\nconstructing specialized prompts and adopting multi-objective learning\nstrategies. We started by selecting serological indicators that significantly\ncorrelate with clinical outcomes and disease severity to serve as input data\nfor the model. Blood test samples often contain numerous missing values, and\ntraditional models generally rely on imputation to handle these gaps in the\ndata. In contrast, LLMs offer the advantage of robust semantic understanding.\nBy setting prompts, we can explicitly inform the model when a feature's value\nis missing, without the need for imputation. For the multi-objective learning\nstrategy, the model is designed to first predict disease severity and then\npredict clinical outcomes. Given that LLMs utilize both the input text and the\ngenerated tokens as input for generating the next token, the predicted severity\nis used as a basis for generating the clinical outcome. During the fine-tuning\nof the LLM, the two objectives influence and improve each other. Our\nexperiments were implemented based on the ChatGLM model.

In distinction to existing paradigms that merely utilize\nexternal knowledge from general KGs or static domain KGs to prompt LLM for\nenhanced domain-specific reasoning, WTS proposes an innovative\n\"LLM$\\circlearrowright$KG\" paradigm, which achieves bidirectional enhancement\nbetween specialized LLM and domain knowledge graph (DKG). The proposed paradigm\nencompasses two closely coupled components: the DKG-Augmented LLM and the\nLLM-Assisted DKG Evolution. The former retrieves question-relevant domain\nknowledge from DKG and uses it to prompt LLM to enhance the reasoning\ncapability for domain-specific tasks; the latter leverages LLM to generate new\ndomain knowledge from processed tasks and use it to evolve DKG. WTS closes the\nloop between DKG-Augmented LLM and LLM-Assisted DKG Evolution, enabling\ncontinuous improvement in the domain specialization as it progressively answers\nand learns from domain-specific questions.

The study examines how these elements are influenced by\nsuprathermal particles \\kappa and the electron-to-ion temperature $T_e/T_i$. We\nuse kinetic plasma theory coupled with the Vlasov-Maxwell model to investigate\nthe dynamics of KAWs and particles.

    "abstract": "The existence of massive white dwarfs (WDs) containing more than\nChandrasekhar's maximum mass has been suggested via the detection of peculiar\ntype Ia Supernovae. It had been crucial to directly detect those 'super' (more\nmassive)-Chandrasekhar WDs to confirm their existence. The WD's small size and\ncold internal environment have been a great disadvantage for detecting them via\nelectromagnetic surveys like GAIA and SDSS. Although many WDs are detected in\noptical observations, none of the super-Chandrasekhar WDs was observed\ndirectly. Mukhopadhyay and his group proposed a decade ago that one of the\npossibilities to explain the high mass of super-Chandrasekhar WD is to exercise\nthe existence of a strong magnetic field in the WD interior. The group also\nrecently proposed that a high magnetic field, in turn, can nontrivially deform\nthe star from a spherical shape. In the presence of rotation and obliquity\nangle, such WDs can radiate continuous gravitational waves (CGW). This opens up\nthe exciting possibility of detecting the super-Chandrasekhar WDs with the\nupcoming detector LISA. However, the gravitational wave (GW) amplitude will\ndecay with time due to electromagnetic radiation and quadrupolar radiation.\nAltogether, those decay mechanisms will set a timescale for detecting WDs via\nCGW.

The variation of the\ncontact angle classically associated with these phenomena appears to be the\nindirect result of a more authentic physical parameter, which we call the\napparent capillary range. This range depends on factors expected to affect the\ncontact angle, such as liquid-solid adhesion forces, liquid-liquid cohesion\nforces, liquid density, gravitational forces and the geometric shape of the\ncapillary section. Our main objective in this work is not to criticize the\nclassical theory, a task that has been largely accomplished, but to present a\nmore general and coherent approach, which perfectly reconciles the\nthermodynamic and mechanical points of view and makes the interpretation of\nvarious configurations clearer. This new perspective can serve as a platform to\nguide researcher's efforts toward more promising results. In the first part of\nthis work, we discuss the theoretical basis of the new formula using common\nexamples. In the second part, we introduce the more explicit form of this\nformula, thus allowing a more precise quantification of wettability by\nproviding access to the direct measurement of liquid-solid adhesive forces.

An $\\textrm{SO}(3)$-consistent\nand second-order accurate time integration scheme for accelerations, velocities\nand rate-dependent viscoelastic strain measures is adopted. To achieve high\nefficiency and geometrical flexibility, the spatial discretization is carried\nout with the isogemetric collocation (IGA-C) method, which permits bypassing\nelements integration keeping all the advantages of the isogeometric analysis\n(IGA) in terms of high-order space accuracy and geometry representation.\nMoreover, a primal formulation guarantees the minimal kinematic unknowns.

    "abstract": "Edge inference is a technology that enables real-time data processing and\nanalysis on clients near the data source. To ensure compliance with the\nService-Level Objectives (SLOs), such as a 30% latency reduction target,\ncaching is usually adopted to reduce redundant computations in inference tasks\non stream data. Due to task and data correlations, sharing cache information\namong clients can improve the inference performance. However, the\nnon-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) nature of data across\ndifferent clients and the long-tail distributions, where some classes have\nsignificantly more samples than others, will reduce cache hit ratios and\nincrease latency. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose an\nefficient inference framework, CoCa, which leverages a multi-client\ncollaborative caching mechanism to accelerate edge inference. On the client\nside, the model is pre-set with multiple cache layers to achieve a quick\ninference. During inference, the model performs sequential lookups at cache\nlayers activated by the edge server. On the server side, CoCa uses a\ntwo-dimensional global cache to periodically aggregate information from\nclients, mitigating the effects of non-IID data. For client cache allocation,\nCoCa first evaluates the importance of classes based on how frequently and\nrecently their samples have been accessed. CoCa then selects frequently\nrecurring classes to address long-tail distribution challenges. Finally, CoCa\ndynamically activates cache layers to balance lookup overhead and accuracy.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that CoCa reduces inference latency by 23.0%\nto 45.2% on the VGG, ResNet and AST models with a slight loss of accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Going beyond few-shot action recognition (FSAR), cross-domain FSAR (CDFSAR)\nhas attracted recent research interests by solving the domain gap lying in\nsource-to-target transfer learning. Existing CDFSAR methods mainly focus on\njoint training of source and target data to mitigate the side effect of domain\ngap. However, such kind of methods suffer from two limitations: First,\npair-wise joint training requires retraining deep models in case of one source\ndata and multiple target ones, which incurs heavy computation cost, especially\nfor large source and small target data. Second, pre-trained models after joint\ntraining are adopted to target domain in a straightforward manner, hardly\ntaking full potential of pre-trained models and then limiting recognition\nperformance. To overcome above limitations, this paper proposes a simple yet\neffective baseline, namely Temporal-Aware Model Tuning (TAMT) for CDFSAR.\nSpecifically, our TAMT involves a decoupled paradigm by performing pre-training\non source data and fine-tuning target data, which avoids retraining for\nmultiple target data with single source. To effectively and efficiently explore\nthe potential of pre-trained models in transferring to target domain, our TAMT\nproposes a Hierarchical Temporal Tuning Network (HTTN), whose core involves\nlocal temporal-aware adapters (TAA) and a global temporal-aware moment tuning\n(GTMT). Particularly, TAA learns few parameters to recalibrate the intermediate\nfeatures of frozen pre-trained models, enabling efficient adaptation to target\ndomains. Furthermore, GTMT helps to generate powerful video representations,\nimproving match performance on the target domain. Experiments on several widely\nused video benchmarks show our TAMT outperforms the recently proposed\ncounterparts by 13%$\\sim$31%, achieving new state-of-the-art CDFSAR results.",

    "abstract": "The binary Yarkovsky effect on the secondary asteroid (BYS) was recently\ndiscovered to influence binary asteroid systems by pushing the secondary\nasteroid toward a synchronous orbit on a short timescale. However, the binary\nYarkovsky effect on the primary (BYP) remains less understood, partly due to\nnon-linear effects from partial eclipses, but could have significant\nimplications for singly synchronous binaries. In this work, we studied the BYP\neffect by numerical methods and estimated its induced orbital drifting rates\nfor real binary asteroids. We find an empirical modified solution to estimate\nthe effective BYP: the traditional BYP formula multiplied by $(r_s /\nr_p)^(\\alpha -1 )$. We confirm that the BYP pushes the primary towards a\nsynchronous orbit where its spin equals the mean motion. The parameter $\\alpha$\nis insensitive to the ratio of the spin rate to the mean motion and decreases\nslightly with increasing thermal inertia. For small binary systems with a\ntypical thermal inertia of 200 tiu, $\\alpha$ is approximately 1.7. The BYP is\nfound to affect the mutual orbit of singly synchronous binaries with a\ntimescale typically an order of magnitude longer than that of the BYS.\n  Drift rates induced by the BYP for known small binary asteroids (primary\nradius < 1 km) range from -0.001 to -1 cm $yr^{-1}$. A comparative analysis\nwith observed orbital drift rates shows agreement for pre-impact Didymos and\n1996 FG$_3$ but discrepancies for 2001 SL$_9$ and 1999 KW$_4$, suggesting\ncomplex dynamics in these systems involving the BYP, the binary\nYarkovsky-O'Keefe-Radzievskii-Paddack (BYORP) effect, and tides. The BYP is\nchanging the mutual orbits of most discovered binary asteroids. We suggest that\nthe BYP should be considered along with BYORP and tidal effects when studying\nbinary systems' long-term dynamics.",

Unlike diffusion models, AR models enable more\nefficient and controllable generation with faster inference times, making them\nespecially suitable for data-intensive domains. Traditional 3D generative\nmodels using AR approaches often rely on ``next-token\" predictions at the voxel\nor point level.

To tackle these challenges, we introduce 3D-WAG, an AR model for 3D\nimplicit distance fields that can perform unconditional shape generation,\nclass-conditioned and also text-conditioned shape generation. Our key idea is\nto encode shapes as multi-scale wavelet token maps and use a Transformer to\npredict the ``next higher-resolution token map\" in an autoregressive manner.

    "abstract": "The 5th generation (5G) of wireless systems is being deployed with the aim to\nprovide many sets of wireless communication services, such as low data rates\nfor a massive amount of devices, broadband, low latency, and industrial\nwireless access. Such an aim is even more complex in the next generation\nwireless systems (6G) where wireless connectivity is expected to serve any\nconnected intelligent unit, such as software robots and humans interacting in\nthe metaverse, autonomous vehicles, drones, trains, or smart sensors monitoring\ncities, buildings, and the environment. Because of the wireless devices will be\norders of magnitude denser than in 5G cellular systems, and because of their\ncomplex quality of service requirements, the access to the wireless spectrum\nwill have to be appropriately shared to avoid congestion, poor quality of\nservice, or unsatisfactory communication delays. Spectrum sharing methods have\nbeen the objective of intense study through model-based approaches, such as\noptimization or game theories. However, these methods may fail when facing the\ncomplexity of the communication environments in 5G, 6G, and beyond. Recently,\nthere has been significant interest in the application and development of\ndata-driven methods, namely machine learning methods, to handle the complex\noperation of spectrum sharing. In this survey, we provide a complete overview\nof the state-of-theart of machine learning for spectrum sharing. First, we map\nthe most prominent methods that we encounter in spectrum sharing. Then, we show\nhow these machine learning methods are applied to the numerous dimensions and\nsub-problems of spectrum sharing, such as spectrum sensing, spectrum\nallocation, spectrum access, and spectrum handoff. We also highlight several\nopen questions and future trends.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a method of performing topology optimisation of transient\nheat conduction problems using the parallel-in-time method Parareal. To\naccommodate the adjoint analysis, the Parareal method was modified to store\nintermediate time steps. Preliminary tests revealed that Parareal requires many\niterations to achieve accurate results and, thus, achieves no appreciable\nspeedup. To mitigate this, a one-shot approach was used, where the time history\nis iteratively refined over the optimisation process. The method estimates\nobjectives and sensitivities by introducing cumulative objectives and\nsensitivities and solving for these using a single iteration of Parareal, after\nwhich it updates the design using the Method of Moving Asymptotes. The\nresulting method was applied to a test problem where a power mean of the\ntemperature was minimised. It achieved a peak speedup relative to a sequential\nreference method of $5\\times$ using 16 threads. The resulting designs were\nsimilar to the one found by the reference method, both in terms of objective\nvalues and qualitative appearance. The one-shot Parareal method was compared to\nthe Parallel Local-in-Time method of topology optimisation. This revealed that\nthe Parallel Local-in-Time method was unstable for the considered test problem,\nbut it achieved a peak speedup of $12\\times$ using 32 threads. It was\ndetermined that the dominant bottleneck in the one-shot Parareal method was the\ntime spent on computing coarse propagators.",

An\neffective strategy to reduce the external pressure is to add a light element M\nthat binds with H to form MHx units, acting as a chemical precompressor. We\nexemplify this idea by performing ab initio calculations of the Ac-Be-H phase\ndiagram, proving that the metallization pressure of Ac-H binaries, for which\ncritical temperatures as high as 200 K were predicted at 200 GPa, can be\nsignificantly reduced via beryllium incorporation.

In particular, fcc AcBeH8 remains dynamically stable down to\n10 GPa, where it exhibits a superconducting transition temperature Tc of 181 K.\nThe Be-H bonds are responsible for the exceptional properties of these ternary\ncompounds and allow them to remain dynamically stable close to ambient\npressure.

    "abstract": "Deploying deep neural networks (DNNs) in real-world environments poses\nchallenges due to faults that can manifest in physical hardware from radiation,\naging, and temperature fluctuations. To address this, previous works have\nfocused on protecting DNNs via activation range restriction using clipped ReLU\nand finding the optimal clipping threshold. However, this work instead focuses\non constraining DNN weights by applying saturated activation functions (SAFs):\nTanh, Arctan, and others. SAFs prevent faults from causing DNN weights to\nbecome excessively large, which can lead to model failure. These methods not\nonly enhance the robustness of DNNs against fault injections but also improve\nDNN performance by a small margin. Before deployment, DNNs are trained with\nweights constrained by SAFs. During deployment, the weights without applied SAF\nare written to mediums with faults. When read, weights with faults are applied\nwith SAFs and are used for inference. We demonstrate our proposed method across\nthree datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR100, ImageNet 2012) and across three datatypes\n(32-bit floating point (FP32), 16-bit floating point, and 8-bit fixed point).\nWe show that our method enables FP32 ResNet18 with ImageNet 2012 to operate at\na bit-error rate of 0.00001 with minor accuracy loss, while without the\nproposed method, the FP32 DNN only produces random guesses. Furthermore, to\naccelerate the training process, we demonstrate that an ImageNet 2012\npre-trained ResNet18 can be adapted to SAF by training for a few epochs with a\nslight improvement in Top-1 accuracy while still ensuring robustness against\nfault injection.",

The architecture includes tailored preprocessing and\npost-processing stages for efficient feature extraction and adherence to power\nconstraints. Trained in an unsupervised learning framework, PAPC is evaluated\nagainst the accelerated proximal gradient (APG) algorithm, showing comparable\nspectral efficiency fairness performance while significantly improving\ncomputational efficiency. Simulations demonstrate PAPC's superior performance\nover fully connected networks (FCNs) that lack pilot information, its\nscalability to large-scale CFmMIMO networks, and its computational efficiency\nimprovement over APG.

Despite the widespread use of multiple-choice\nquestions in assessments, the detection of AI cheating in MCQ-based tests has\nbeen almost unexplored, in contrast to the focus on detecting AI-cheating on\ntext-rich student outputs. In this paper, we propose a method based on the\napplication of Item Response Theory to address this gap. Our approach operates\non the assumption that artificial and human intelligence exhibit different\nresponse patterns, with AI cheating manifesting as deviations from the expected\npatterns of human responses. These deviations are modeled using Person-Fit\nStatistics. We demonstrate that this method effectively highlights the\ndifferences between human responses and those generated by premium versions of\nleading chatbots (ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini), but that it is also sensitive\nto the amount of AI cheating in the data. Furthermore, we show that the\nchatbots differ in their reasoning profiles.

However, its practical application is\nlimited by its inability to retrieve classes absent from the training set. To\naddress this limitation, the task has evolved into Zero-Shot Sketch-Based Image\nRetrieval (ZS-SBIR), where model performance is evaluated on unseen categories.\nTraditional SBIR primarily focuses on narrowing the domain gap between photo\nand sketch modalities. However, in the zero-shot setting, the model not only\nneeds to address this cross-modal discrepancy but also requires a strong\ngeneralization capability to transfer knowledge to unseen categories. To this\nend, we propose a novel framework for ZS-SBIR that employs a pair-based\nrelation-aware quadruplet loss to bridge feature gaps. By incorporating two\nnegative samples from different modalities, the approach prevents positive\nfeatures from becoming disproportionately distant from one modality while\nremaining close to another, thus enhancing inter-class separability. We also\npropose a Relation-Aware Meta-Learning Network (RAMLN) to obtain the margin, a\nhyper-parameter of cross-modal quadruplet loss, to improve the generalization\nability of the model. RAMLN leverages external memory to store feature\ninformation, which it utilizes to assign optimal margin values.

To analyze the characteristics of these candidates, we focus on\nobjects exhibiting the near-infrared photometry of VIKING or UKIDSS and the\nmid-infrared photometry of unWISE (28 objects).

Temperature\ndependent Raman and Brillouin light scattering studies reveal a significant\nshift in phonon modes across normal to incommensurate phase transition (Tn-in)\nwhich occurs ~ 488 K. In the temperature range from 900 down to 500 K, two\noptical phonon modes about 63 (B1 mode) and 54 cm-1 (A1 mode) were observed.\nThe frequency of A1 mode strongly decreases with an increase in temperature\nabove the Tn-in while the frequency of this mode almost remains constant below\nthe Tn-in. In contrast the frequency of B1 phonon mode is found to increase\nwith temperature in the range of 500 - 900 K but it does not display a\nsignificant shift below the phase transition temperature. In addition in the\nincommensurate phase a new optical phonon mode at 35 cm-1 also begins to appear\nand exhibits strong stiffening behavior with increase in temperature in the\nrange of 300 - 488 K. Moreover, the anomalous behavior of the acoustic phonon\nacross Tn-in were further probed using Brilliouin scattering. Longitudinal\nacoustic phonon mode at 41 GHz exhibits strong change in slope near Tn-in. In\naddition, the transverse acoustic modes at 28.6 and 22.4 GHz also exhibit\nstrong anomalies with minimum in frequency near Tn-in. The inelastic light\nscattering studies provide valuable information on the phase transition.",

In this work, we propose, for the first time, a fully binary and\ngradient-free training algorithm for multi-layer BNNs, eliminating the need for\nback-propagated floating-point gradients. Specifically, the proposed algorithm\nrelies on local binary error signals and binary weight updates, employing\ninteger-valued hidden weights that serve as a synaptic metaplasticity\nmechanism, thereby enhancing its neurobiological plausibility.

In more than one-third of B1919+21's single pulses,\nthe polarization position angle (PA) is found to rotate quasi-monotonically\nwith pulse longitude, by over 180 degrees or even 360 degrees. Some single\npulse PA even rotates by over 540 degrees. Most of these quasi-monotonic PA\ncurves have negative slopes with respect to pulse longitude. Oscillations of\ncircular polarization fraction accompany these PA rotations. This rapid\nrotation could be induced by a quick change of phase lag between two normal\nwave modes within an individual pulse. We propose a phenomenological model to\nreproduce the observed polarization rotations in single pulses, and calculate\nphase lags in a dipolar magnetic field of an aligned rotating pulsar, with a\ndispersion relation of orthogonal wave modes in strongly magnetized\nelectron-positron plasma. According to the dispersion relation, the weak\nfrequency dependence of observed polarization rotation requires small angles\nbetween the radio wavevector and local magnetic fields, which requires the\nradio emission height to be low, on the order of 10 times neutron star radius.",

Most studies have focused solely on effective token\nmixers, overlooking the potential relationship with normalization. To boost\ndiverse feature learning, we propose two components: a normalization module\ncalled multi-view normalization (MVN) and a token mixer called multi-view token\nmixer (MVTM). The MVN integrates three differently normalized features via\nbatch, layer, and instance normalization using a learnable weighted sum. Each\nnormalization method outputs a different distribution, generating distinct\nfeatures. Thus, the MVN is expected to offer diverse pattern information to the\ntoken mixer, resulting in beneficial synergy. The MVTM is a convolution-based\nmultiscale token mixer with local, intermediate, and global filters, and it\nincorporates stage specificity by configuring various receptive fields for the\ntoken mixer at each stage, efficiently capturing ranges of visual patterns. We\npropose a novel ViT model, multi-vision transformer (MVFormer), adopting the\nMVN and MVTM in the MetaFormer block, the generalized ViT scheme. Our MVFormer\noutperforms state-of-the-art convolution-based ViTs on image classification,\nobject detection, and instance and semantic segmentation with the same or lower\nparameters and MACs.

However, these hardware devices are vulnerable to unintended faults\ncaused by aging, temperature variance, and write errors. These faults can cause\nbit-flips in DNN weights and significantly degrade the performance of DNNs.\nThus, protection against these faults is crucial for the deployment of DNNs in\ncritical applications. Previous works have proposed error correction codes\nbased methods, however these methods often require high overheads in both\nmemory and computation. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective method\nto harden DNN weights by multiplying weights by constants before storing them\nto fault-prone medium. When used, these weights are divided back by the same\nconstants to restore the original scale. Our method is based on the observation\nthat errors from bit-flips have properties similar to additive noise, therefore\nby dividing by constants can reduce the absolute error from bit-flips. To\ndemonstrate our method, we conduct experiments across four ImageNet 2012\npre-trained models along with three different data types: 32-bit floating\npoint, 16-bit floating point, and 8-bit fixed point.

Specifically, it is shown\nthat the decision problem concerning $\\gamma_{[4R]}(G)$ is NP-complete when\nrestricted to star convex bipartite, comb convex bipartite, split and planar\ngraphs. In contrast, it is also proved that such problem can be efficiently\nsolved for threshold graphs where an exact solution is demonstrated, while for\ngraphs having an efficient dominating set, tight upper and lower bounds in\nterms of the classical domination number are given.

Previous studies on this model did not\ntake into account the frequency dependence of the opacity. We study the\nradiative reprocessing and calculate the UV-optical-NIR band spectra from a\nspherical outflow composed of pure hydrogen gas, for a time-dependent\noutflowing mass rate. Electron scattering and frequency-dependent bound-free,\nfree-free opacities are considered. The spectrum deviates from the blackbody at\nNIR and UV frequencies; in particular, it has $\\nu L_{\\nu} \\propto \\nu^{1.5}$\nat NIR frequencies, because at these frequencies the absorption optical depth\nfrom the outflow's outer edge to the so-called photon trapping radius is large\nand is frequency dependent. We apply our model to the proto-type FBOT AT2018cow\nby {the spectra} to the observed SED. The best-fit mass loss rate suggests that\nthe total outflow mass in AT2018cow is $M_{\\rm out} \\approx 5.7^{+0.4}_{-0.4}\n\\, M_{\\odot}$. If that equals the total mass lost during an explosion, and if\nthe progenitor is a blue supergiant (with a pre-explosion mass of $\\sim 20 \\,\nM_{\\odot}$), then it will suggest that the central compact remnant mass is at\nleast $\\approx \\, \\rm{14 \\, M_{\\odot}}$.

    "abstract": "Zero-shot slot filling is a well-established subtask of Natural Language\nUnderstanding (NLU). However, most existing methods primarily focus on\nsingle-turn text data, overlooking the unique complexities of conversational\ndialogue. Conversational data is highly dynamic, often involving abrupt topic\nshifts, interruptions, and implicit references that make it difficult to\ndirectly apply zero-shot slot filling techniques, even with the remarkable\ncapabilities of large language models (LLMs). This paper addresses these\nchallenges by proposing strategies for automatic data annotation with slot\ninduction and black-box knowledge distillation (KD) from a teacher LLM to a\nsmaller model, outperforming vanilla LLMs on internal datasets by 26% absolute\nincrease in F1 score. Additionally, we introduce an efficient system\narchitecture for call center product settings that surpasses off-the-shelf\nextractive models by 34% relative F1 score, enabling near real-time inference\non dialogue streams with higher accuracy, while preserving low latency.",

    "abstract": "The integration of tactile sensing into compliant soft robotic grippers\noffers a compelling pathway toward advanced robotic grasping and safer\nhuman-robot interactions. Visual-tactile sensors realize high-resolution,\nlarge-area tactile perception with affordable cameras. However, conventional\nvisual-tactile sensors rely heavily on rigid forms, sacrificing finger\ncompliance and sensing regions to achieve localized tactile feedback. Enabling\nseamless, large-area tactile sensing in soft grippers remains challenging, as\ndeformations inherent to soft structures can obstruct the optical path and\nrestrict the camera's field of view. To address these, we present Gelsight\nFlexiRay, a multimodal visual-tactile sensor designed for safe and compliant\ninteractions with substantial structural deformation through integration with\nFinray Effect grippers. First, we adopt a multi-mirror configuration, which is\nsystematically modeled and optimized based on the physical force-deformation\ncharacteristics of FRE grippers. Second, we enhanced Gelsight FlexiRay with\nhuman-like multimodal perception, including contact force and location,\nproprioception, temperature, texture, and slippage. Experiments demonstrate\nGelsight FlexiRay's robust tactile performance across diverse deformation\nstates, achieving a force measurement accuracy of 0.14 N and proprioceptive\npositioning accuracy of 0.19 mm. Compared with state of art compliant VTS, the\nFlexiRay demonstrates 5 times larger structural deformation under the same\nloads. Its expanded sensing area and ability to distinguish contact information\nand execute grasping and classification tasks highlights its potential for\nversatile, large-area multimodal tactile sensing integration within soft\nrobotic systems.

The decision making and\ntrajectory planning tasks are jointly formulated as a nonlinear programming\nproblem with an integrated objective function. However, integrating the\ndiscrete decision variables into the continuous trajectory optimization leads\nto a mixed-integer programming (MIP) problem with inherent nonlinearity and\nnonconvexity. To address the challenge in solving the problem, the original\nproblem is decomposed into two sub-stages, and a two-stage optimization (TSO)\nbased approach is presented to ensure the coherence in outcomes for the two\nstages. The optimization problem in the first stage determines the optimal\ndecision sequence that acts as an informed initialization. With the outputs\nfrom the first stage, the second stage necessitates the use of a high-fidelity\nvehicle model and strict enforcement of the collision avoidance constraints as\npart of the trajectory planning problem. We evaluate the effectiveness of our\nproposed planner across diverse multi-lane scenarios. The results demonstrate\nthat the proposed planner simultaneously generates a sequence of optimal\ndecisions and the corresponding trajectory that significantly improves driving\nperformance in terms of driving safety and traveling efficiency as compared to\nalternative methods.

In this work, we\nintroduce Fixed-points of Restoration (FiRe) priors as a new framework for\nexpanding the notion of priors in PnP to general restoration models beyond\ntraditional denoising models. The key insight behind FiRe is that smooth images\nemerge as fixed points of the composition of a degradation operator with the\ncorresponding restoration model.

The FiRe framework further enables ensemble-like combinations of\nmultiple restoration models as well as acquisition-informed restoration\nnetworks, all within a unified optimization approach.

These extensions,\nwhich are well known in the finite-dimensional setting, constitute the dynamics\nof state feedback controllers.

The design of\ndynamic state feedback controllers is divided into first introducing an\nappropriate dynamic extension and then determining a static feedback of the\nextended state, which includes the system and controller state, to meet some\ndesign objective. In the paper, the dynamic extensions are chosen such that all\ntransport velocities are homogenized on the unit spatial interval. Based on the\ndynamically extended system, a backstepping transformation allows to easily\nfind a static state feedback that assigns a general dynamics to the closed-loop\nsystem, with arbitrary in-domain couplings. This new design flexibility is also\nused to determine a feedback that achieves complete input-output decoupling in\nthe closed loop with ensured internal stability. It is shown that the\nmodularity of this dynamic feedback design allows for a straightforward\ntransfer of all results to hyperbolic PDE-ODE systems.

By extending\ntraditional lifting techniques into a non-parametric neural network framework,\nNeuroLifting benefits from the smooth loss landscape of neural networks,\nenabling efficient and parallelizable optimization.

While large language models (LLMs) have improved the efficiency of\nsynthetic audio caption generation, current approaches struggle to effectively\nextract and incorporate detailed audio information. In this paper, we propose\nan automated pipeline that integrates audio-language models for fine-grained\ncontent extraction, LLMs for synthetic caption generation, and a contrastive\nlanguage-audio pretraining (CLAP) model-based refinement process to improve the\nquality of captions. Specifically, we employ prompt chaining techniques in the\ncontent extraction stage to obtain accurate and fine-grained audio information,\nwhile we use the refinement process to mitigate potential hallucinations in the\ngenerated captions. Leveraging the AudioSet dataset and the proposed approach,\nwe create AudioSetCaps, a dataset comprising 1.9 million audio-caption pairs,\nthe largest audio-caption dataset at the time of writing. The models trained\nwith AudioSetCaps achieve state-of-the-art performance on audio-text retrieval\nwith R@1 scores of 46.3% for text-to-audio and 59.7% for audio-to-text\nretrieval and automated audio captioning with the CIDEr score of 84.8.

This paper focuses on the enhanced nuclear\nelectric dipole moment (EDM) and Schiff moment present in nuclei with octupole\ndeformation (pear-shaped nuclei). These moments, which are proportional to the\noctupole deformation, have a collective nature and are large in the intrinsic\nframe that rotates with the nucleus. However, in a state with definite angular\nmomentum and parity, $T$ and $P$ conservation forbid their expectation values\nin the laboratory frame, as nuclear rotation causes them to vanish. In nuclei\nwith octupole deformation, close opposite-parity rotational states with\nidentical spin are mixed by $T$,$P$-violating nuclear forces. This mixing\npolarises the nuclear axis along the nuclear spin, allowing moments from the\nintrinsic frame to manifest in the laboratory frame, provided the nuclear spin\n$I$ is sufficiently large. Using half-life data for $E1$ transitions from the\nNuDat database, we calculate the intrinsic nuclear EDM $d_{\\text{int}}$ for a\nrange of nuclei theorised to exhibit octupole deformation. From these values,\nwe independently estimate the intrinsic nuclear Schiff moment $S_{\\text{int}}$\nand the octupole deformation parameter $\\beta_{3}$.

However, most of them primarily adopted a\nmodel-centric approach, which simplifies graphs by converting them into\nundirected formats and emphasizes model designs. This approach is inherently\nlimited in real-world applications due to the unavoidable information loss in\nsimple undirected graphs and the model optimization challenges that arise when\nexceeding the upper bounds of this sub-optimal data representational capacity.\nAs a result, there has been a shift toward data-centric methods that prioritize\nimproving graph quality and representation. Specifically, various types of\ngraphs can be derived from naturally structured data, including heterogeneous\ngraphs, hypergraphs, and directed graphs. Among these, directed graphs offer\ndistinct advantages in topological systems by modeling causal relationships,\nand directed GNNs have been extensively studied in recent years. However, a\ncomprehensive survey of this emerging topic is still lacking. Therefore, we aim\nto provide a comprehensive review of directed graph learning, with a particular\nfocus on a data-centric perspective. Specifically, we first introduce a novel\ntaxonomy for existing studies. Subsequently, we re-examine these methods from\nthe data-centric perspective, with an emphasis on understanding and improving\ndata representation. It demonstrates that a deep understanding of directed\ngraphs and their quality plays a crucial role in model performance.\nAdditionally, we explore the diverse applications of directed GNNs across 10+\ndomains, highlighting their broad applicability.

In this paper, we present the first approach\nto generate scene-coherent typographic adversarial attacks that mislead\nadvanced LVLMs while maintaining visual naturalness through the capability of\nthe LLM-based agent. Our approach addresses three critical questions: what\nadversarial text to generate, where to place it within the scene, and how to\nintegrate it seamlessly. We propose a training-free, multi-modal LLM-driven\nscene-coherent typographic adversarial planning (SceneTAP) that employs a\nthree-stage process: scene understanding, adversarial planning, and seamless\nintegration.

Novel data, like images, may then be\ngenerated from Gaussian noise through a sequence of denoising operations. While\nthis Markov process implicitly defines a joint distribution over noise-free\ndata, it is not simple to condition the generative process on masked or partial\nimages. A number of heuristic sampling procedures have been proposed for\nsolving inverse problems with diffusion priors, but these approaches do not\ndirectly approximate the true conditional distribution imposed by inference\nqueries, and are often ineffective for large masked regions. Moreover, many of\nthese baselines cannot be applied to latent diffusion models which use image\nencodings for efficiency. We instead develop a hierarchical variational\ninference algorithm that analytically marginalizes missing features, and uses a\nrigorous variational bound to optimize a non-Gaussian Markov approximation of\nthe true diffusion posterior. Through extensive experiments with both\npixel-based and latent diffusion models of images, we show that our VIPaint\nmethod significantly outperforms previous approaches in both the plausibility\nand diversity of imputations, and is easily generalized to other inverse\nproblems like deblurring and superresolution.",

Over the\npast forty-five years, the accretion rate of Mrk~1018 changed 1000 times and\nthe maximum Eddington ratio reached 0.02. By investigating the relation between\nbroad-line properties and Eddington ratio ($L_{\\rm bol}/L_{\\rm Edd}$), we find\nstrong evidence that the full-cycle type transition is regulated by accretion.\nThere exists a turnover point in the Balmer decrement, which is observed for\nthe first time. The broad Balmer lines change from a single peak in Type\n1.0-1.2 to double peaks in Type 1.5-1.8 and the double-peak separation\ndecreases with increasing accretion rate.

While Small Language Models (SLMs) still struggle at this task,\ntool-augmented multi-step agents perform better, at the cost of relying on\nclosed-source or larger models, external data, or extensive prompt-engineering.\nThis work introduces MATATA, a novel weakly supervised end-to-end approach to\ntrain multi-step reasoning language agents for document tabular applications.\nMATATA presents an annotation-free paradigm for each agent to enhance 3.8B/8B\nSLMs. During its two-stage training, MATATA uses the final outcome of the\nmulti-step reasoning chain as weak supervision. This approach avoids having to\nindividually supervise each intermediate agent in the reasoning chain.

Experiments demonstrate that MATATA achieves\nstate-of-the-art on FinQA, and on TAT-QA among reasoning methods based on\nopen-source SLMs. Although being SLM-based, MATATA closely matches GPT-4-based\nframeworks on TabMWP.

    "abstract": "Self-supervised foundation models have recently been successfully extended to\nencode three-dimensional (3D) computed tomography (CT) images, with excellent\nperformance across several downstream tasks, such as intracranial hemorrhage\ndetection and lung cancer risk forecasting. However, as self-supervised models\nlearn from complex data distributions, questions arise concerning whether these\nembeddings capture demographic information, such as age, sex, or race. Using\nthe National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) dataset, which contains 3D CT images\nand demographic data, we evaluated a range of classifiers: softmax regression,\nlinear regression, linear support vector machine, random forest, and decision\ntree, to predict sex, race, and age of the patients in the images. Our results\nindicate that the embeddings effectively encoded age and sex information, with\na linear regression model achieving a root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.8\nyears for age prediction and a softmax regression model attaining an AUC of\n0.998 for sex classification. Race prediction was less effective, with an AUC\nof 0.878. These findings suggest a detailed exploration into the information\nencoded in self-supervised learning frameworks is needed to help ensure fair,\nresponsible, and patient privacy-protected healthcare AI.",

    "abstract": "Carbyne, a one-dimensional (1D) carbon allotrope with alternating triple and\nsingle bonds, has the highest known mechanical strength but is unstable to\nbending, limiting synthesis to short linear chains. Encapsulation within carbon\nnanotubes (CNTs) stabilizes carbyne, forming confined carbyne (CC), thus\nenabling further research concerning attractive 1D physics and materials\nproperties of carbyne. While CC has been synthesized in multi-walled CNTs\n(MWCNTs) using the arc-discharge method and in double-walled CNTs (DWCNTs) via\nhigh-temperature high-vacuum (HTHV) method, synthesis in single-walled CNTs\n(SWCNTs) has been challenging due to their fragility under such conditions. In\nthis work, we report a low-temperature method to synthesize CC inside SWCNTs\n(CC@SWCNT). By annealing SWCNTs containing ammonium deoxycholate (ADC) at\n400{\\deg}C, ADC is converted into CC without damaging the SWCNTs. Raman\nspectroscopy revealed a strong CC phonon (CC-mode) peak at 1860-1870 cm^-1,\nmuch stronger than the SWCNT G-band peak, confirming a high fraction of CC in\nthe resulting material. The Raman mapping result showed the uniformity of the\nCC-mode signal across the entire film sample, proving the high efficiency of\nthis method in synthesizing CC in every SWCNT of appropriate size. Notably, the\nCC-mode peaks of CC@SWCNT (above 1860 cm^-1) are higher than those reported in\nprevious CC@CNT samples (mostly less than 1856 cm^-1). This is attributed to\nlarger SWCNT diameters (over 0.95 nm) used in this study, compared to the\ntypical 0.6-0.8 nm range. Larger diameters result in reduced confinement,\nallowing carbyne to closely resemble free-standing carbyne while remaining\nstabilized. This low-temperature synthesis of long-chain, nearly free-standing\ncarbyne within large-diameter SWCNTs offers new opportunities for exploring 1D\nphysics and the unique properties of carbyne for potential applications.",

    "abstract": "In the context of a short video & live stream mixed recommendation scenario,\nthe live stream recommendation system (RS) decides whether to allocate at most\none live stream into the video feed for each user request. To maximize\nlong-term user engagement, it is crucial to determine an optimal live stream\npolicy for accurate live stream allocation. The inappropriate live stream\nallocation policy can significantly affect the duration of the usage app and\nuser retention, which ignores the long-term negative impact of live stream\nallocation. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely applied in\nrecommendation systems to capture long-term user engagement. However,\ntraditional RL algorithms often face divergence and instability problems, which\nrestricts the application and deployment in the large-scale industrial\nrecommendation systems, especially in the aforementioned challenging scenario.\nTo address these challenges, we propose a novel Supervised Learning-enhanced\nMulti-Group Actor Critic algorithm (SL-MGAC). Specifically, we introduce a\nsupervised learning-enhanced actor-critic framework that incorporates variance\nreduction techniques, where multi-task reward learning helps restrict\nbootstrapping error accumulation during critic learning. Additionally, we\ndesign a multi-group state decomposition module for both actor and critic\nnetworks to reduce prediction variance and improve model stability. We also\npropose a novel reward function to prevent overly greedy live stream\nallocation. Empirically, we evaluate the SL-MGAC algorithm using offline policy\nevaluation (OPE) and online A/B testing. Experimental results demonstrate that\nthe proposed method not only outperforms baseline methods under the\nplatform-level constraints but also exhibits enhanced stability in online\nrecommendation scenarios.",

Accurate prediction of dissection trajectories is crucial for better\ndecision-making, reducing intraoperative errors, and improving surgical\ntraining. Nevertheless, predicting these trajectories is challenging due to\nvariable tumor margins and dynamic visual conditions. To address this issue, we\ncreate the ESD Trajectory and Confidence Map-based Safety Margin (ETSM) dataset\nwith $1849$ short clips, focusing on submucosal dissection with a dual-arm\nrobotic system.

We evaluate our RCMNet using three distinct experimental\nsetups: in-domain evaluation, robustness assessment, and out-of-domain\nevaluation. Experimental results show that our approach excels in the\nconfidence map-based safety margin prediction task, achieving a mean absolute\nerror (MAE) of only $3.18$.

To\naddress this problem, we leverage the property of Fresnel zone that the beam\nsplit disappears for RIS elements along a single Fresnel zone and propose\nbeamforming design on the two dimensions of along and across the Fresnel zones.\nThe phase shift of RIS elements along the same Fresnel zone are designed\naligned, so that the signal reflected by these element can add up in-phase at\nthe receiver regardless of the frequency.

    "abstract": "This study addresses a critical gap in the literature regarding the use of\nSwarm Intelligence Optimization (SI) algorithms for client selection in\nFederated Learning (FL), with a focus on cybersecurity applications. Existing\nresearch primarily explores optimization techniques for centralized machine\nlearning, leaving the unique challenges of client diveristy, non-IID data\ndistributions, and adversarial noise in decentralized FL largely unexamined. To\nbridge this gap, we evaluate nine SI algorithms-Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO),\nParticle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Cuckoo Search, Bat Algorithm, Bee Colony,\nAnt Colony Optimization, Fish Swarm, Glow Worm, and Intelligent Water\nDroplet-across four experimental scenarios: fixed client participation, dynamic\nparticipation patterns, hetergeneous non-IID data distributions, and\nadversarial noise conditions. Results indicate that GWO exhibits superior\nadaptability and robustness, achieving the highest accuracy, recall and\nF1-scoress across all configurations, while PSO and Cuckoo Search also\ndemonstrate strong performance. These findings underscore the potential of SI\nalgorithms to address decentralized and adversarial FL challenges, offereing\nscalable and resilient solutions for cybersecurity applications, including\nintrusion detection in IoT and large-scale networks.",

The method is\nreferred to as Occam's control in this paper, given its simplicity and as a\ntribute to the 14th-century William of Ockham. Using the\nself-consumption-maximization application, it is proven that Occam's control is\na special case of a larger category of optimization methods called online\nconvex learning. Thus, for the first time, a theoretical upper bound is derived\nfor this control method. Furthermore, based on the theoretical insight, an\nalternative algorithm is devised on the same complexity level that outperforms\nOccam's. Practical data is used to evaluate the performance of these learning\nmethods as compared to the classical rolling-horizon linear/quadratic\nprogramming. Findings support online learning methods for residential\napplications given their low complexity and small computation, communication,\nand data footprint.

As the parameter scale of autonomous\ndriving perception models grows, traditional test-time adaptation (TTA) methods\nbecome unstable and often degrade model performance in most scenarios. To\naddress these challenges, this paper proposes two new robust methods to improve\nthe Batch Normalization with TTA for object detection in autonomous driving:\n(1) We introduce a LearnableBN layer based on Generalized-search Entropy\nMinimization (GSEM) method.

SAM has\nzero-shot generalization ability beyond other models and can provide an ideal\nframework for COD. Our network aims to enhance the single prompt strategy in\nSAM to a multiprompt strategy. To achieve this, we propose an edge gradient\nextraction module, which generates a mask containing gradient information\nregarding the boundaries of camouflaged objects. This gradient mask is then\nused as a novel boundary prompt, enhancing the segmentation process.\nThereafter, we design a box-boundary mutual guidance module, which fosters more\nprecise and comprehensive feature extraction via mutual guidance between a\nboundary prompt and a box prompt. This collaboration enhances the model's\nability to accurately detect camouflaged objects. Moreover, we employ the\ndiscrete wavelet transform to extract high-frequency features from image\nembeddings. The high-frequency features serve as a supplementary component to\nthe multiprompt system. Finally, our COMPrompter guides the network to achieve\nenhanced segmentation results, thereby advancing the development of SAM in\nterms of COD. Experimental results across COD benchmarks demonstrate that\nCOMPrompter achieves a cutting-edge performance, surpassing the current leading\nmodel by an average positive metric of 2.2% in COD10K.

    "abstract": "The fusion of camera- and LiDAR-based detections offers a promising solution\nto mitigate tracking failures in 3D multi-object tracking (MOT). However,\nexisting methods predominantly exploit camera detections to correct tracking\nfailures caused by potential LiDAR detection problems, neglecting the\nreciprocal benefit of refining camera detections using LiDAR data. This\nlimitation is rooted in their single-stage architecture, akin to single-stage\nobject detectors, lacking a dedicated trajectory refinement module to fully\nexploit the complementary multi-modal information. To this end, we introduce\nCrossTracker, a novel two-stage paradigm for online multi-modal 3D MOT.\nCrossTracker operates in a coarse-to-fine manner, initially generating coarse\ntrajectories and subsequently refining them through an independent refinement\nprocess. Specifically, CrossTracker incorporates three essential modules: i) a\nmulti-modal modeling (M^3) module that, by fusing multi-modal information\n(images, point clouds, and even plane geometry extracted from images), provides\na robust metric for subsequent trajectory generation. ii) a coarse trajectory\ngeneration (C-TG) module that generates initial coarse dual-stream\ntrajectories, and iii) a trajectory refinement (TR) module that refines coarse\ntrajectories through cross correction between camera and LiDAR streams.\nComprehensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our\nCrossTracker over its eighteen competitors, underscoring its effectiveness in\nharnessing the synergistic benefits of camera and LiDAR sensors for robust\nmulti-modal 3D MOT.",

    "abstract": "Kantor's Thesis was the first step in unifying the Chabauty-Kim and\nLawrence-Venkatesh methods via relative completion. In this work, we refine\nKantor's approach by addressing its limitations, achieving the first\nunification where a dimension inequality between local and global Galois\ncohomology implies Diophantine finiteness for curves. This results in a new\nconditional proof of Faltings' and Siegel's theorems and introduces a novel\np-adic analytic method for computing rational points on hyperbolic curves,\noffering advantages over the Chabauty-Kim and Lawrence-Venkatesh approaches.\n  Our technical contributions are threefold. First, we establish the density of\nKantor's p-adic period map. Second, our method applies to all curves of genus g\n>= 2, extending beyond the specific modular curves considered in Kantor's\nthesis. Third, we resolve the representability problem for Kantor's global\nSelmer stack. Previously, Kantor's method required additional conjectures in\np-adic Hodge theory to represent his Selmer stack--a priori a rigid analytic\nstack--in a category with a suitable dimension theory. We overcome this by\nreplacing the unipotent completions used in Kim's framework with the unipotent\nradicals of Kantor's relative completions, derived from monodromy\nrepresentations associated with the relative cohomology of a Kodaira-Parshin\nfamily.\n  Kantor's method is a step toward the Effective Faltings Problem, which seeks\nnot only to establish finiteness of rational points on hyperbolic curves but to\ncompute them explicitly. While the Lawrence-Venkatesh method is unconditional,\nit has not yet been made effective for any curve. In contrast, the Chabauty-Kim\nmethod, though conditional, has been made effective in various settings. Our\nUnipotent Chabauty-Kim-Kantor method addresses key challenges in Kantor's\nprogram and highlights its potential for both theoretical and computational\nadvances.",

As model complexity becomes sufficiently\nhigh, the performance improves with complexity again, resulting in a double\nascent Sharpe ratio curve similar to the double descent phenomenon observed in\nartificial intelligence. The underlying mechanisms involve an intricate\ninteraction between the theoretical Sharpe ratio and estimation accuracy.

Specifically, building on the local\nalgorithm of Buchbinder et al.

In $n$-vertex graphs, for adversarially ordered streams,\nour algorithm uses $O(n^{1-\\Omega(1)})$ (sub-linear) space and for randomly\nordered streams, our algorithm uses logarithmic space. Moreover, both\nalgorithms require only one pass over the input stream. With a constant number\nof passes, we give a logarithmic-space algorithm which works even on graphs\nwith unbounded degree on adversarially ordered streams. Our algorithms achieve\nany fixed constant approximation factor less than $\\frac12$. In the single-pass\nsetting, this is tight: known lower bounds show that obtaining any constant\napproximation factor greater than $\\frac12$ is impossible without using linear\nspace in adversarially ordered streams (Kapralov and Krachun, STOC'19) and\n$\\Omega(\\sqrt{n})$ space in randomly ordered streams, even on bounded degree\ngraphs (Kapralov, Khanna, and Sudan, SODA'15).\n  In terms of techniques, our algorithms partition the vertices into a small\nnumber of different types based on the structure of their local neighborhood,\nensuring that each type carries enough information about the structure to\napproximately simulate the local algorithm on a vertex with that type. We then\ndevelop tools to accurately estimate the frequency of each type.

    "abstract": "Collisionless self-gravitating systems, e.g., cold dark matter halos, harbor\nuniversal density profiles despite the intricate non-linear physics of\nhierarchical structure formation, the origin of which has been a persistent\nmystery. To solve this problem, we develop a self-consistent quasilinear theory\n(QLT) in action-angle space for the collisionless relaxation of driven,\ninhomogeneous, self-gravitating systems by perturbing the governing\nVlasov-Poisson equations. We obtain a quasilinear diffusion equation (QLDE) for\nthe secular evolution of the mean distribution function $f_0$ of a halo due to\nlinear fluctuations (induced by random perturbations in the force field) that\nare collectively dressed by self-gravity, a phenomenon described by the\nresponse matrix. Unlike previous studies, we treat collective dressing up to\nall orders. Well-known halo density profiles $\\rho(r)$ commonly observed in\n$N$-body simulations, including the $r^{-1}$ NFW cusp, an Einasto central core,\nand the $r^{-1.5}$ prompt cusp, emerge as quasi-steady state attractor\nsolutions of the QLDE. The $r^{-1}$ cusp is a constant flux steady-state\nsolution for a constantly accreting massive halo perturbed by small-scale white\nnoise fluctuations induced by substructure. It is an outcome of the universal\nnature of collisionless relaxation: lower energy particles attract more\nparticles, gain higher effective mass and get less accelerated by the\nfluctuating force field. The zero-flux steady state solution for an isolated\nhalo is an $f_0$ that is flat in energy, and the corresponding $\\rho(r)$ can\neither be cored or an $r^{-1.5}$ cusp depending on the inner boundary\ncondition. The latter forms around a central dense object, e.g., a compact\nsubhalo or a black hole. We demonstrate for the first time that these halo\nprofiles emerge as quasi-steady state attractors of collisionless relaxation\ndescribed by a self-consistent QLT.",

    "abstract": "Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are a versatile statistical framework commonly\nused in ecology to characterize behavioural patterns from animal movement data.\nIn HMMs, the observed data depend on a finite number of underlying hidden\nstates, generally interpreted as the animal's unobserved behaviour. The number\nof states is a crucial parameter, controlling the trade-off between ecological\ninterpretability of behaviours (fewer states) and the goodness of fit of the\nmodel (more states). Selecting the number of states, commonly referred to as\norder selection, is notoriously challenging. Common model selection metrics,\nsuch as AIC and BIC, often perform poorly in determining the number of states,\nparticularly when models are misspecified. Building on existing methods for\nHMMs and mixture models, we propose a double penalized likelihood maximum\nestimate (DPMLE) for the simultaneous estimation of the number of states and\nparameters of non-stationary HMMs. The DPMLE differs from traditional\ninformation criteria by using two penalty functions on the stationary\nprobabilities and state-dependent parameters. For non-stationary HMMs, forward\nand backward probabilities are used to approximate stationary probabilities.\nUsing a simulation study that includes scenarios with additional complexity in\nthe data, we compare the performance of our method with that of AIC and BIC. We\nalso illustrate how the DPMLE differs from AIC and BIC using narwhal (Monodon\nmonoceros) movement data. The proposed method outperformed AIC and BIC in\nidentifying the correct number of states under model misspecification.\nFurthermore, its capacity to handle non-stationary dynamics allowed for more\nrealistic modeling of complex movement data, offering deeper insights into\nnarwhal behaviour. Our method is a powerful tool for order selection in\nnon-stationary HMMs, with potential applications extending beyond the field of\necology.",
