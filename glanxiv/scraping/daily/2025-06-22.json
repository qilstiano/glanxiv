    "abstract": "Radiographic knee alignment (KA) measurement is important for predicting\njoint health and surgical outcomes after total knee replacement. Traditional\nmethods for KA measurements are manual, time-consuming and require long-leg\nradiographs. This study proposes a deep learning-based method to measure KA in\nanteroposterior knee radiographs via automatically localized knee anatomical\nlandmarks. Our method builds on hourglass networks and incorporates an\nattention gate structure to enhance robustness and focus on key anatomical\nfeatures. To our knowledge, this is the first deep learning-based method to\nlocalize over 100 knee anatomical landmarks to fully outline the knee shape\nwhile integrating KA measurements on both pre-operative and post-operative\nimages. It provides highly accurate and reliable anatomical varus/valgus KA\nmeasurements using the anatomical tibiofemoral angle, achieving mean absolute\ndifferences ~1{\\deg} when compared to clinical ground truth measurements.\nAgreement between automated and clinical measurements was excellent\npre-operatively (intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.97) and good\npost-operatively (ICC = 0.86). Our findings demonstrate that KA assessment can\nbe automated with high accuracy, creating opportunities for digitally enhanced\nclinical workflows.",

    "abstract": "Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have revolutionized 3D scene reconstruction\nfrom sparse image collections. Recent work has explored integrating pre-trained\nvision features, particularly from DINO, to enhance few-shot reconstruction\ncapabilities. However, the effectiveness of such approaches remains unclear,\nespecially in extreme few-shot scenarios. In this paper, we present a\nsystematic evaluation of DINO-enhanced NeRF models, comparing baseline NeRF,\nfrozen DINO features, LoRA fine-tuned features, and multi-scale feature fusion.\nSurprisingly, our experiments reveal that all DINO variants perform worse than\nthe baseline NeRF, achieving PSNR values around 12.9 to 13.0 compared to the\nbaseline's 14.71. This counterintuitive result suggests that pre-trained vision\nfeatures may not be beneficial for few-shot 3D reconstruction and may even\nintroduce harmful biases. We analyze potential causes including feature-task\nmismatch, overfitting to limited data, and integration challenges. Our findings\nchallenge common assumptions in the field and suggest that simpler\narchitectures focusing on geometric consistency may be more effective for\nfew-shot scenarios.",

While the signature coefficients are known to decay\nfactorially fast, the coefficients of the logarithimic signature generically\nonly possess geometric decay. It was conjectured by T. Lyons and N. Sidorova\nthat the only tree-reduced paths with bounded variation (BV) whose logarithmic\nsignature can have infinite radius of convergence are straight lines. This\nconjecture was confirmed in the same work for certain types of paths and the\ngeneral BV case remains unsolved.\n  The aim of the present article is to develop a deeper understanding towards\nthe Lyons-Sidorova conjecture. We prove that, if the logarithmic signature has\ninfinite radius of convergence, the signature coefficients must satisfy an\ninfinite system of rigid algebraic identities defined in terms of iterated\nintegrals along complex exponential one-forms. These iterated integral\nidentities impose strong geometric constraints on the underlying path, and in\nsome special situations, confirm the conjecture.\n  As a non-trivial application of our integral identities, we prove a\nstrengthened version of the conjecture, which asserts that if the logarithmic\nsignature of a BV path has infinite radius of convergence over all\nsub-intervals of time, the underlying path must be a straight line.\n  Our methodology relies on Cartan's path development onto the complex\nsemisimple Lie algebras $\\mathfrak{sl}_m(\\mathbb{C})$.

    "abstract": "Vision-language models (VLMs) unify computer vision and natural language\nprocessing in a single architecture capable of interpreting and describing\nimages.

This work removes both by introducing a spectral dictionary\ntoken mixer, which represents each image patch or wordpiece as a sparse\ncombination of learnable frequency atoms. Our 1.1B-parameter prototype,\nSDict-VLM, achieves BLEU-4 of 39.2, CIDEr of 127.5, and SPICE of 27.0 on\nMS-COCO captioning, along with 50.3 percent accuracy on VQAv2.

In the\ndata-driven approach, the conservation laws and boundary conditions are\nsatisfied by means of the finite element method, while the experimental data is\nused directly in numerical simulations, avoiding material models. Critically,\nwe introduce a \"weaker'\" mixed finite element formulation, which relaxes the\nregularity requirements on the approximation space for the primary field. At\nthe same time, the continuity of the normal flux component is enforced across\ninner boundaries, allowing the conservation law to be satisfied in the strong\nsense. The relaxed regularity of the approximation spaces makes it easier to\nobserve how imperfections in the datasets, such as missing or noisy data,\nresult in non-uniqueness of the solution. This can be quantified to predict the\nuncertainty of the results using methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo.\nFurthermore, this formulation provides a posteriori error indicators tailored\nfor the data-driven approach, providing confidence in the results and enabling\nefficient solution schemes via adaptive hp-refinement.

Currently, high-quality verifiers are\neither unscalable (e.g., humans) or limited in utility (e.g., tools like Lean).\nWhile LM judges and reward models have become broadly useful as general-purpose\nverifiers, a significant performance gap remains between them and oracle\nverifiers (verifiers with perfect accuracy). To help close this gap, we\nintroduce Weaver, a framework for designing a strong verifier by combining\nmultiple weak, imperfect verifiers. We find weighted ensembles of verifiers,\nwhich typically require learning from labeled data, significantly outperform\nunweighted combinations due to differences in verifier accuracies. To reduce\ndependency on labeled data, Weaver leverages weak supervision to estimate each\nverifier's accuracy and combines outputs into a unified score that better\nreflects true response quality. However, directly applying weak supervision\nalgorithms poses challenges, including inconsistent verifier output formats and\nhandling low-quality verifiers. Weaver addresses these using dataset statistics\nto normalize outputs and filter specific verifiers.

    "abstract": "The wisdom of crowds is an umbrella term for phenomena suggesting that the\ncollective judgment or decision of a large group can be more accurate than the\nindividual judgments or decisions of the group members. A well-known example\nillustrating this concept is the competition at a country fair described by\nGalton, where the median value of the individual guesses about the weight of an\nox resulted in an astonishingly accurate estimate of the actual weight. This\nphenomenon resembles classical results in probability theory and relies on\nindependent decision-making. The accuracy of the group's final decision can be\nsignificantly reduced if the final agents' opinions are driven by a few\ninfluential agents.\n  In this paper, we consider a group of agents who initially possess\nuncorrelated and unbiased noisy measurements of a common state of the world.\nAssume these agents iteratively update their estimates according to a simple\nnon-Bayesian learning rule, commonly known in mathematical sociology as the\nFrench-DeGroot dynamics or iterative opinion pooling. As a result of this\niterative distributed averaging process, each agent arrives at an asymptotic\nestimate of the state of the world, with the variance of this estimate\ndetermined by the matrix of weights the agents assign to each other. Every\nagent aims at minimizing the variance of her asymptotic estimate of the state\nof the world; however, such variance is also influenced by the weights\nallocated by other agents. To achieve the best possible estimate, the agents\nmust then solve a game-theoretic, multi-objective optimization problem defined\nby the available sets of influence weights. We characterize both the Pareto\nfrontier and the set of Nash equilibria in the resulting game. Additionally, we\nexamine asynchronous best-response dynamics for the group of agents and prove\ntheir convergence to the set of strict Nash equilibria.",

However, due to hard-to-analyze language features,\nexisting call graph construction algorithms for JavaScript are neither sound\nnor complete. Prior work shows that even advanced solutions produce false edges\nand miss valid ones. In this work, we assist these tools by identifying missed\ncall edges. Our main idea is to frame the problem as link prediction on full\nprogram graphs, using a rich representation with multiple edge types. Our\napproach, GRAPHIA, leverages recent advances in graph neural networks to model\nnon-local relationships between code elements. Concretely, we propose\nrepresenting JavaScript programs using a combination of syntactic- and\nsemantic-based edges. GRAPHIA can learn from imperfect labels, including static\ncall edges from existing tools and dynamic edges from tests, either from the\nsame or different projects. Because call graphs are sparse, standard machine\nlearning metrics like ROC are not suitable. Instead, we evaluate GRAPHIA by\nranking function definitions for each unresolved call site. We conduct a\nlarge-scale evaluation on 50 popular JavaScript libraries with 163K call edges\n(150K static and 13K dynamic). GRAPHIA builds program graphs with 6.6M\nstructural and 386K semantic edges.

The\nchallenge is to avoid the Gibbs paradox, which forbids any ordering or labeling\nof the atoms. Our key observation is that the lattice of a thermally disordered\ncondensed matter system, in either solid, liquid or gas phase, can be fully\nreconstructed from the Voronoi cells of the atoms alone, even if these Voronoi\ncells are disassembled and randomly scrambled. In the example of the\ncrystalline phase of silicon, the statistics of the Voronoi cells reveals the\nexistence of four, and only four, large facets that are present with\nprobability one for all temperatures up to the solid-liquid melting line. These\nfour largest facets, which separate nearest-neighboring atoms, can be also be\nused to reconstruct the lattice of the crystal. Hence, their collection\nsupplies the optimal representation of the configuration of the crystal. We\nconjecture that the existence of Voronoi facets that, despite their large\nthermal fluctuations, survive with probability one up to the melting\ntemperature, is the fundamental signature of the crystalline solid phase and\ntherefore key to quantifying the Gibbs measure over the entire solid phase.",

Current table\nextraction methods struggle with semantic understanding, resulting in poor\nperformance when integrated into retrieval-augmented chat applications. This\npaper identifies a key bottleneck - while structural table information can be\nextracted, the semantic relationships between tabular elements are lost,\ncausing downstream query failures. To address this, we introduce TalentMine, a\nnovel LLM-enhanced framework that transforms extracted tables into semantically\nenriched representations. Unlike conventional approaches relying on CSV or text\nlinearization, our method employs specialized multimodal reasoning to preserve\nboth structural and semantic dimensions of tabular data. Experimental\nevaluation across employee benefits document collections demonstrates\nTalentMine's superior performance, achieving 100% accuracy in query answering\ntasks compared to 0% for standard AWS Textract extraction and 40% for AWS\nTextract Visual Q&A capabilities. Our comparative analysis also reveals that\nthe Claude v3 Haiku model achieves optimal performance for talent management\napplications. The key contributions of this work include (1) a systematic\nanalysis of semantic information loss in current table extraction pipelines,\n(2) a novel LLM-based method for semantically enriched table representation,\n(3) an efficient integration framework for retrieval-augmented systems as\nend-to-end systems, and (4) comprehensive benchmarks on talent analytics tasks\nshowing substantial improvements across multiple categories.",

Knowing when and how much to trust these models is\ncritical to the safe deployment of reasoning models in real-world applications.\nTo this end, we explore uncertainty quantification of reasoning models in this\nwork. Specifically, we ask three fundamental questions: First, are reasoning\nmodels well-calibrated? Second, does deeper reasoning improve model\ncalibration? Finally, inspired by humans' innate ability to double-check their\nthought processes to verify the validity of their answers and their confidence,\nwe ask: can reasoning models improve their calibration by explicitly reasoning\nabout their chain-of-thought traces? We introduce introspective uncertainty\nquantification (UQ) to explore this direction. In extensive evaluations on SOTA\nreasoning models across a broad range of benchmarks, we find that reasoning\nmodels: (i) are typically overconfident, with self-verbalized confidence\nestimates often greater than 85% particularly for incorrect responses, (ii)\nbecome even more overconfident with deeper reasoning, and (iii) can become\nbetter calibrated through introspection (e.g., o3-Mini and DeepSeek R1) but not\nuniformly (e.g., Claude 3.7 Sonnet becomes more poorly calibrated).

    "abstract": "We summarize a recently proposed resolution of the quantum measurement\nproblem. It stems from an insight into entanglement demonstrated in a 1991\nexperiment involving photon momenta. This experiment shows that, when two\nsuperposed quantum systems A and B are entangled, the resulting\n\"pre-measurement state\" is not a paradoxical macroscopic superposition of\ncompound states of the two subsystems; for example, Schrodinger's cat is not\n\"smeared\" between dead and alive. It is instead a non-local superposition of\ncorrelations between states of the subsystems. In Schrodinger's example, an\nundecayed nucleus is correlated with a live cat, AND a decayed nucleus is\ncorrelated with a dead cat, where \"AND\" indicates the superposition on. This is\nexactly what we want. We have misinterpreted \"dyads\" |A> |B> where \"A\" and \"B\"\nare subsystems of a composite system AB. A> |B> does not mean states |A> and\n|B> both exist. It means instead |B> exists if and only |A> exists, i.e. |A>\nand |B> are correlated. It is a fact of nature that such correlations are\nnonlocally coherent: The degree of correlation between A and B depends on the\nnonlocal phase angle between the arbitrarily distant subsystems. Such coherent\ncorrelations are central to the nonlocal collapse of wave functions.",

To address these challenges, this study proposes\nan adaptive task allocation framework that strategically leverages the\nsynergistic potential of Digital Twins, Integer Programming (IP), and Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs). The multi-robot task allocation problem is formally\ndefined and solved using an IP model that accounts for task dependencies, robot\nheterogeneity, scheduling constraints, and re-planning requirements. A\nmechanism for narrative-driven schedule adaptation is introduced, in which\nunstructured natural language inputs are interpreted by an LLM, and\noptimization constraints are autonomously updated, enabling human-in-the-loop\nflexibility without manual coding. A digital twin-based system has been\ndeveloped to enable real-time synchronization between physical operations and\ntheir digital representations. This closed-loop feedback framework ensures that\nthe system remains dynamic and responsive to ongoing changes on site. A case\nstudy demonstrates both the computational efficiency of the optimization\nalgorithm and the reasoning performance of several LLMs, with top-performing\nmodels achieving over 97% accuracy in constraint and parameter extraction.

Conventional Bayesian\nmultiobject tracking (MOT) methods typically employ a detect-then-track (DTT)\napproach, where a frontend detector preprocesses raw sensor data to extract\nmeasurements for MOT. The irreversible nature of this preprocessing step can\ndiscard valuable object-related information, particularly impairing the ability\nto resolve weak or closely spaced objects. The track-before-detect (TBD)\nparadigm offers an alternative by operating directly on sensor data. However,\nexisting TBD approaches introduce simplifications to facilitate the development\nof inference methods, such as assuming known signal amplitudes or conditional\nindependence between sensor measurements given object states. These assumptions\ncan lead to suboptimal performance and limit the applicability of the resulting\nTBD methods in realistic scenarios.\n  This paper introduces a novel TBD method that is based on a comprehensive\nsignal model for sensor data. The new model accounts for sensor data\ncorrelations and amplitude fluctuations, enabling the accurate representation\nof the physics of the data-generating process in TBD. The proposed model is\nsuitable for a wide range of problems in active and passive radar, active and\npassive sonar, as well as integrated sensing and communication systems.

This poses\na challenge for such models to obtain satisfactory performance in classifying\nleaf diseases with limited samples. This work proposes a few-shot learning\nframework, Domain-adapted Expert Network (DExNet), for plant disease\nclassification that compensates for the lack of sufficient training data by\ncombining observations of a number of expert critics. It starts with extracting\nthe feature embeddings as 'observations' from nine 'critics' that are\nstate-of-the-art pre-trained CNN-based architectures. These critics are 'domain\nadapted' using a publicly available leaf disease dataset having no overlapping\nclasses with the specific downstream task of interest. The observations are\nthen passed to the 'Feature Fusion Block' and finally to a classifier network\nconsisting of Bi-LSTM layers. The proposed pipeline is evaluated on the 10\nclasses of tomato leaf images from the PlantVillage dataset, achieving\npromising accuracies of 89.06%, 92.46%, and 94.07%, respectively, for 5-shot,\n10-shot, and 15-shot classification. Furthermore, an accuracy of 98.09+-0.7%\nhas been achieved in 80-shot classification, which is only 1.2% less than\nstate-of-the-art, allowing a 94.5% reduction in the training data requirement.\nThe proposed pipeline also outperforms existing works on leaf disease\nclassification with limited data in both laboratory and real-life conditions in\nsingle-domain, mixed-domain, and cross-domain scenarios.",

In DPTV, overlap\nobscures PI boundaries, complicating the detection and accurate estimation of\nPI diameter and center position, which increases uncertainty in the\nreconstructed particle positions. In IPI, overlap reduces the usable area of\nthe interference pattern, limiting the accuracy of particle size determination.\nThis study introduces a statistical model to quantify PI overlap independently\nfrom the optical setup, source density, or PI size. The model assumes uniformly\ndistributed, uniformly sized circular PIs and is validated against experimental\ndata featuring non-uniform sizes and mild astigmatism (up to aspect ratios of\n1.66), demonstrating strong agreement. The present study reveals that the\nseeding density $\\mathcal{S}$ serves as a strong universal scaling parameter\nfor PI overlap.

In this work, we systematically investigate the\nG and 2D Raman modes of t-BLG samples with twist angles ranging from\n$\\sim$0.3$^{\\circ}$ to $\\sim$3$^{\\circ}$ using micro-Raman spectroscopy. A key\nfinding of our work is the splitting of the G mode near the magic angle due to\nmoir\\'e potential induced phonon hybridization. The linewidth of the\nlow-frequency component of the G mode (G$^-$), as well as the main component of\nthe 2D mode, exhibits enhanced broadening near the magic angle due to increased\nelectron-phonon coupling, driven by the emergence of flat electronic bands.\nAdditionally, temperature-dependent Raman measurements (6-300 K) of magic-angle\ntwisted bilayer graphene sample ($\\theta_t \\sim$ 1$^{\\circ}$) reveal an almost\ntenfold increase in phonon anharmonicity-induced temperature variation in both\ncomponents of the split G mode, as compared to Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene\nsample, further emphasizing the role of phonon hybridization in this system.\nThese studies could be important for understanding the thermal properties of\nthe twisted bilayer graphene systems.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates the synthesis of novel magnetic materials via\nhydroflux synthesis, a method that combines flux-based and hydrothermal\ntechniques. Single crystals of three novel alkali tellurate oxide-hydroxides\nwere synthesized. One, CsTeO$_3$(OH), is nonmagnetic and a new member of the\nseries ATeO$_3$(OH) (A = alkali). The other two phases contain magnetic Cu-Te\nsublattices, one of which, KCu$_2$Te$_3$O$_{8}$(OH), is structurally\nthree-dimensional and undergoes several magnetic ordering transitions; the\nother, Cs$_2$Cu$_3$Te$_2$O$_{10}$, is structurally two-dimensional and remains\nparamagnetic above T = 2K. These exploratory investigations of novel phase\nspaces reveal key factors including hydroxide concentration, precursor\nsolubility, and oxidizing power of the solution which govern the formation and\ncomposition of alkali tellurate oxide-hydroxides.",

    "abstract": "Recent discoveries of long gamma-ray bursts accompanied by kilonova emission\nprompted interest in understanding their progenitors. If these long-duration\nbursts arise from neutron star mergers, similar to short gamma-ray bursts, it\nraises the question of which physical properties govern burst duration. The\nmass of the merger stands out as a key factor, strongly influencing the\nlifetime of the merger remnant, which in turn determines the burst duration:\nlighter mergers that form long-lived remnants produce short bursts, whereas\nmore massive mergers result in short-lived remnants that collapse into black\nholes, powering longer bursts. In this paper, we compare merger rates from\ngravitational-wave observations of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA with the rates of\nkilonova-associated long and short gamma-ray bursts, to identify a\ncharacteristic total neutron star mass that separates the two burst classes at\n$1.36^{+0.08}_{-0.09}$ (median and 68\\% confidence interval) times of the\nneutron star Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff mass. This result suggests that massive\nneutron stars could survive an extended period after merger. Our findings are\nrobust against substantial observational uncertainties and model assumptions.\nMoreover, we uncover correlations among various characteristic masses tied to\ndense nuclear matter, introducing a novel and independent approach to constrain\nneutron star nuclear properties through separated and combined\ngravitational-wave and gamma-ray burst observations.",

    "abstract": "Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is an encryption scheme that not only\nencrypts data but also allows for computations to be applied directly on the\nencrypted data. While computationally expensive, FHE can enable\nprivacy-preserving neural inference in the client-server setting: a client\nencrypts their input with FHE and sends it to an untrusted server. The server\nthen runs neural inference on the encrypted data and returns the encrypted\nresults. The client decrypts the output locally, keeping both the input and\nresult private from the server. Private inference has focused on networks with\ndense inputs such as image classification, and less attention has been given to\nnetworks with sparse features. Unlike dense inputs, sparse features require\nefficient encrypted lookup operations into large embedding tables, which\npresent computational and memory constraints for FHE.\n  In this paper, we explore the challenges and opportunities when applying FHE\nto Deep Learning Recommendation Models (DLRM) from both a compiler and systems\nperspective. DLRMs utilize conventional MLPs for dense features and embedding\ntables to map sparse, categorical features to dense vector representations. We\ndevelop novel methods for performing compressed embedding lookups in order to\nreduce FHE computational costs while keeping the underlying model performant.\nOur embedding lookup improves upon a state-of-the-art approach by $77 \\times$.\nFurthermore, we present an efficient multi-embedding packing strategy that\nenables us to perform a 44 million parameter embedding lookup under FHE.\nFinally, we integrate our solutions into the open-source Orion framework and\npresent HE-LRM, an end-to-end encrypted DLRM. We evaluate HE-LRM on UCI (health\nprediction) and Criteo (click prediction), demonstrating that with the right\ncompression and packing strategies, encrypted inference for recommendation\nsystems is practical.",

Through extensive empirical analysis, we\nshow that providing general-purpose VLMs with query and normative matched\nreference images, accompanied by clinically-informed comparative prompts,\nsignificantly improves diagnostic outcomes compared to single-image baselines,\nespecially after supervised finetuning (SFT). Our contributions highlight the\nclinical relevance of comparative analysis introduce novel strategies for\nleveraging reference images in VLMs, empirically demonstrate enhanced\nperformance across multiple medical visual question answering (VQA) tasks, and\nprovide theoretical insights into the efficacy of comparative image analysis in\nmedical diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "We present a self-consistent many-body framework for computing phonon-limited\nelectronic transport from first principles, incorporating both\nbeyond-quasiparticle effects and vertex corrections. Using the recently\ndeveloped first-principles scGD0 method, we calculate spectral functions with\nnonperturbative effects such as broadening, satellites, and energy-dependent\nrenormalization. We show that the scGD0 spectral functions outperform one-shot\nG0D0 and cumulant approximations in model Hamiltonians and real materials,\neliminating unphysical spectral kinks and correctly predicting the phonon\nemission continuum. Building on this, we introduce the self-consistent ladder\nformalism for transport, which captures vertex corrections due to\nelectron-phonon interactions. This approach unifies and improves upon the two\nstate-of-the-art approaches for first-principles phonon-limited transport: the\nbubble approximation and the Boltzmann transport equation. Moreover, as a\ncharge-conserving approximation, it enables consistent calculations of the\noptical conductivity and dielectric function. We validate the developed method\nagainst numerically exact results for model Hamiltonians and apply it to real\nmaterials. Our results show quantitative agreement with the experimental dc\nconductivities in intrinsic semiconductors Si and ZnO and the SrVO3 metal, as\nwell as excellent agreement with the experimental THz optical and dielectric\nproperties of Si and ZnO. This work unifies first-principles and many-body\napproaches for studying transport, opening new directions for applying\nmany-body theory to materials with strong electron-phonon interactions.",

    "abstract": "Multilayer assemblies of metal nanoparticles can act as photonic structures,\nwhere collective plasmon resonances hybridize with cavity modes to create\nplasmon-polariton states. For sufficiently strong coupling, plasmon polaritons\nqualitatively alter the optical properties of light-matter systems, with\napplications ranging from sensing to solar energy. However, results from\nexperimental studies have raised questions about the role of nanoparticle\nstructural disorder in plasmon-polariton formation and light-matter coupling in\nplasmonic assemblies. Understanding how disorder affects optical properties has\npractical implications since methods for assembling low-defect nanoparticle\nsuperlattices are slow and scale poorly. Modeling realistic disorder requires\nlarge system sizes, which is challenging using conventional electromagnetic\nsimulations. We employ Brownian dynamics simulations to construct large-scale\nnanoparticle multilayers with controlled structural order. We investigate their\noptical response using a superposition T-matrix method with 2-D periodic\nboundary conditions. We find that while structural disorder broadens the\npolaritonic stop band and the near-field hot-spot distribution, the polariton\ndispersion and coupling strength remain unaltered. To understand effects of\nnanoparticle composition, we consider assemblies with model particles mimicking\ngold or tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) nanocrystals. Losses due to higher damping\nin ITO nanocrystals prevent their assemblies from achieving the deep strong\ncoupling of gold nanoparticle multilayers, although the former still exhibit\nultrastrong coupling. We demonstrate that while computationally efficient\nmutual polarization method calculations employing the quasistatic approximation\nmodestly overestimate the strength of the collective plasmon, they reproduce\nthe polariton dispersion relations determined by electrodynamic simulations.",

We propose a generalization of regression discontinuity designs to\nhandle complex non-Euclidean outcomes, such as networks, compositional data,\nfunctional data, and other random objects residing in geodesic metric spaces. A\nkey challenge in this setting is the absence of algebraic operations, which\nmakes it difficult to define treatment effects using simple differences. To\naddress this, we define the causal effect at the cutoff as a geodesic between\nthe local Fr\\'echet means of untreated and treated outcomes. This reduces to\nthe classical average treatment effect in the scalar case. Estimation is\ncarried out using local Fr\\'echet regression, a nonparametric method for metric\nspace-valued responses that generalizes local linear regression. We introduce a\nnew bandwidth selection procedure tailored to regression discontinuity designs,\nwhich performs competitively even in classical scalar scenarios. The proposed\ngeodesic regression discontinuity design method is supported by theory,\nincluding convergence rate guarantees, and is demonstrated in applications\nwhere causal inference is of interest in complex outcome spaces.

While\ngenerative models show promise for data augmentation, current methods mainly\nfocus on enhancing polyp diversity, often overlooking the critical issue of\nfalse positives. In this paper, we address this gap by proposing an adversarial\ndiffusion framework to synthesize high-value false positives. The extensive\nvariability of negative backgrounds presents a significant challenge in false\npositive synthesis. To overcome this, we introduce two key innovations: First,\nwe design a regional noise matching strategy to construct a negative synthesis\nspace using polyp detection datasets. This strategy trains a negative-centric\ndiffusion model by masking polyp regions, ensuring the model focuses\nexclusively on learning diverse background patterns. Second, we introduce the\nDetector-guided Adversarial Diffusion Attacker (DADA) module, which perturbs\nthe negative synthesis process to disrupt a pre-trained detector's decision,\nguiding the negative-centric diffusion model to generate high-value,\ndetector-confusing false positives instead of low-value, ordinary backgrounds.\nOur approach is the first to apply adversarial diffusion to lesion detection,\nestablishing a new paradigm for targeted false positive synthesis and paving\nthe way for more reliable clinical applications in colorectal cancer screening.\nExtensive results on public and in-house datasets verify the superiority of our\nmethod over the current state-of-the-arts, with our synthesized data improving\nthe detectors by at least 2.6% and 2.7% in F1-score, respectively, over the\nbaselines.

At the same\ntime, concerns about the concentration of power in deployed AI systems have\nsparked a keen interest in 'democratic' or 'public' AI. In this work, we bring\nthese two ideas together by proposing mechanisms for aggregated individual\nreporting (AIR), a framework for post-deployment evaluation that relies on\nindividual reports from the public. An AIR mechanism allows those who interact\nwith a specific, deployed (AI) system to report when they feel that they may\nhave experienced something problematic; these reports are then aggregated over\ntime, with the goal of evaluating the relevant system in a fine-grained manner.\nThis position paper argues that individual experiences should be understood as\nan integral part of post-deployment evaluation, and that the scope of our\nproposed aggregated individual reporting mechanism is a practical path to that\nend. On the one hand, individual reporting can identify substantively novel\ninsights about safety and performance; on the other, aggregation can be\nuniquely useful for informing action. From a normative perspective, the\npost-deployment phase completes a missing piece in the conversation about\n'democratic' AI.

In this paper, we propose a novel two-level framework\n(i.e., Consensus Inference-based Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (CI-HRL)),\nwhich delegates target localization to a high-level policy, while adopting a\nlow-level policy to manage obstacle avoidance, navigation, and formation.\nSpecifically, in the high-level policy, we develop a novel multi-agent\nreinforcement learning module, Consensus-oriented Multi-Agent Communication\n(ConsMAC), to enable agents to perceive global information and establish\nconsensus from local states by effectively aggregating neighbor messages.\nMeanwhile, we leverage an Alternative Training-based Multi-agent proximal\npolicy optimization (AT-M) and policy distillation to accomplish the low-level\ncontrol. The experimental results, including the high-fidelity\nsoftware-in-the-loop (SITL) simulations, validate that CI-HRL provides a\nsuperior solution with enhanced swarm's collaborative evasion and task\ncompletion capabilities.",

One\nreason for such an impact is LLMs' ability to make highly technical endeavors\nmore accessible to a broader audience. Accessibility has long been a goal for\nthe growing fields of quantum computing, informatics, and engineering,\nespecially as more quantum systems become publicly available via cloud\ninterfaces. Between programming quantum computers and using LLMs, the latter\nseems the more accessible task: while leveraging an LLM's fullest potential\nrequires experience with prompt engineering, any literate person can provide\nqueries and read responses. By contrast, designing and executing quantum\nprograms -- outside of those available online -- requires significant\nbackground knowledge, from selection of operations for algorithm implementation\nto configuration choices for particular hardware specifications and providers.\nCurrent research is exploring LLM utility for classical software development,\nbut there has been relatively little investigation into the same for quantum\nprogramming. Consequently, this work is a first look at how well an\nuncustomized, publicly available LLM can write straightforward quantum\ncircuits. We examine how well OpenAI's ChatGPT (GPT-4) can write quantum\ncircuits for two hardware providers: the superconducting qubit machines of IBM\nand the photonic devices of Xanadu.

    "abstract": "In recent years, significant advancements in the field of Natural Language\nProcessing (NLP) have positioned commercialized language models as\nwide-reaching, highly useful tools. In tandem, there has been an explosion of\nmultidisciplinary research examining how NLP tasks reflect, perpetuate, and\namplify social biases such as gender and racial bias. A significant gap in this\nscholarship is a detailed analysis of how queer sexualities are encoded and\n(mis)represented by both NLP systems and practitioners. Following previous work\nin the field of AI fairness, we document how sexuality is defined and\noperationalized via a survey and analysis of 55 articles that quantify\nsexuality-based NLP bias. We find that sexuality is not clearly defined in a\nmajority of the literature surveyed, indicating a reliance on assumed or\nnormative conceptions of sexual/romantic practices and identities. Further, we\nfind that methods for extracting biased outputs from NLP technologies often\nconflate gender and sexual identities, leading to monolithic conceptions of\nqueerness and thus improper quantifications of bias. With the goal of improving\nsexuality-based NLP bias analyses, we conclude with recommendations that\nencourage more thorough engagement with both queer communities and\ninterdisciplinary literature.",

    "abstract": "Multiobject tracking (MOT) is an important task in applications including\nautonomous driving, ocean sciences, and aerospace surveillance. Traditional MOT\nmethods are model-based and combine sequential Bayesian estimation with data\nassociation and an object birth model. More recent methods are fully\ndata-driven and rely on the training of neural networks. Both approaches offer\ndistinct advantages in specific settings. In particular, model-based methods\nare generally applicable across a wide range of scenarios, whereas data-driven\nMOT achieves superior performance in scenarios where abundant labeled data for\ntraining is available. A natural thought is whether a general framework can\nintegrate the two approaches. This paper introduces a hybrid method that\nutilizes neural networks to enhance specific aspects of the statistical model\nin Bayesian MOT that have been identified as overly simplistic. By doing so,\nthe performance of the prediction and update steps of Bayesian MOT is improved.\nTo ensure tractable computation, our framework uses belief propagation to avoid\nhigh-dimensional operations combined with sequential Monte Carlo methods to\nperform low-dimensional operations efficiently. The resulting method combines\nthe flexibility and robustness of model-based approaches with the capability to\nlearn complex information from data of neural networks. We evaluate the\nperformance of the proposed method based on the nuScenes autonomous driving\ndataset and demonstrate that it has state-of-the-art performance",

In this work, we propose RoboArena, a new approach for\nscalable evaluation of generalist robot policies in the real world. Instead of\nstandardizing evaluations around fixed tasks, environments, or locations, we\npropose to crowd-source evaluations across a distributed network of evaluators.\nImportantly, evaluators can freely choose the tasks and environments they\nevaluate on, enabling easy scaling of diversity, but they are required to\nperform double-blind evaluations over pairs of policies. Then, by aggregating\npreference feedback from pairwise comparisons across diverse tasks and\nenvironments, we can derive a ranking of policies. We instantiate our approach\nacross a network of evaluators at seven academic institutions using the DROID\nrobot platform. Through more than 600 pairwise real-robot evaluation episodes\nacross seven generalist policies, we demonstrate that our crowd-sourced\napproach can more accurately rank the performance of existing generalist\npolicies than conventional, centralized evaluation approaches, while being more\nscalable, resilient, and trustworthy.

Moreover, emergent continuous symmetries (U(1) or\nSU(2)) are discovered in some random measurement models in the large-$d$ (qudit\ndimension) limit. The emergent continuous symmetry allows a variety of spin\ndynamics phenomena to find their counterparts in random circuit models.",

In this scenario, the $O(10^2)$ GV hardening and $O(10)$ TV bump\nis due to the contribution of the local source, the knee is due to the maximum\nacceleration energy of protons by the Galactic source population, the second\nknee is due to the maximum acceleration energy of iron nuclei by Galactic\nsources, the dip feature between the two knees is due to the appearance of the\nextra-galactic component, the ankle comes from the transition from one\nextra-galactic component to the other, and the spectral suppression at the\nhighest energies arises from the acceleration limit of the second\nextra-galactic component.

The absorption in the core of\nMg II k line is also broader than in the chromosphere. This corresponds also to\ncounter-streaming velocities.

From 106 radio\nsources found in the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array observations in the TDF,\nwe detected 12 sources (11% detection rate) at 3.3 $\\mu$Jy rms sensitivity and\n4 mas resolution. Most detections exhibit pc-scale emission (less than 40 pc)\nwith high VLBA/VLA flux density ratios and brightness temperatures exceeding\n10$^5$ K, confirming non-thermal AGN activity. Spectral indices ($>$ -0.5)\ncorrelate with higher VLBA/VLA flux ratios, consistent with synchrotron\nemission from AGN coronae or jets. In the majority of our sources star\nformation contributes less than 50% of the total VLBA radio emission, with a\nfew cases where the emission is almost entirely AGN-driven. Although the radio\nemission from radio quiet AGN is thought to be primarily driven by star\nformation, our VLBA observations confirm that there is also often a\ncontribution at various levels from black hole driven AGN. Eight VLBA\ndetections have JWST/NIRCam counterparts, predominantly early-type,\nbulge-dominated galaxies, which we use to get an estimate of the redshift and\nstar formation rate (SFR). WISE colors indicate that VLBA detections are either\nAGN or intermediate-disk-dominated systems, while VLBA non-detections\ncorrespond to extended, star-forming galaxies.

We address this by introducing adaptive\nbacktracking (AdaBack), a per-sample curriculum learning algorithm that reveals\nonly a partial prefix of the target output during training. The supervision\nlength is adjusted dynamically for each sample based on the model's past reward\nsignal, allowing it to incrementally learn to complete reasoning chains by\nconditioning on correct partial solutions. We investigate this intermediate\nregime between SFT and RL and argue that per-sample curriculum learning is more\nthan a trade-off between efficiency and generality, it can succeed in tasks\nwith long sequences of latent dependencies where SFT and RL both fail to\ngeneralize. Using a synthetic task with latent parity constraints, we show that\nour adaptive curriculum over partial answers reliably solves problems that are\notherwise intractable.

Built from a logarithmic K\\\"ahler potential\nmodified by nilpotent constraints, SHS yields a framework that connects the\nearly universe's inflationary phase, intermediate metastable acceleration, and\na final supersymmetric fixed point.\n  We classify all viable models by imposing four essential criteria: absence of\nghosts, de Sitter metastability, smooth Minkowski transitions, and asymptotic\nsupersymmetry. The resulting scalar dynamics exhibit exponential field-space\nprofiles, $\\tau(\\varphi) \\sim e^{-\\Delta\\varphi}$, reconciling trans-Planckian\nexcursions with bounded moduli. This structure ensures finite geodesic\ndistance, stabilizes the gravitino mass, and suppresses light towers -- evading\nboth the Gravitino and Swampland Distance Conjectures. Meanwhile, the divergent\nEuclidean cost of reaching the supersymmetric endpoint realizes the AdS and\nGeneralized Swampland Distance Conjectures, confirming that the infrared\nboundary lies at infinite dynamical distance despite controlled scalar\nevolution.\n  From this behavior emerges the Supersymmetric Horizon Conjecture: that\nconsistent gravitational EFTs may begin and end with supersymmetry -- both at\nthe origin and the asymptotic edge of cosmic evolution -- not as a fine-tuned\nremnant, but as a geometric boundary condition.

However, existing Geographic\nInformation Systems (GIS)-based systems struggle to integrate and manage of\nsuch large-scale and diverse data sources. To address these challenges, this\npaper proposes G-SEED (GeoSOT-based Scalable Encoding and Extraction for Forest\nand Grassland Spatio-temporal Data), a unified encoding and management\nframework based on the hierarchical GeoSOT (Geographical coordinate global\nSubdivision grid with One dimension integer on 2n tree) grid system.

The framework incorporates adaptive grid-level selection,\ncenter-cell-based indexing, and full-coverage grid arrays to optimize spatial\nquerying and compression. Through extensive experiments on a real-world dataset\nfrom Shennongjia National Park (China), G-SEED demonstrates superior\nperformance in spatial precision control, cross-source consistency, query\nefficiency, and compression compared to mainstream methods such as Geohash and\nH3.

Such trajectories do not arise in finite-dimensional systems,\nare non-generic for countable oscillator systems, but become generic in the\ncontinual case. We prove that for a countable harmonic oscillator system, every\npoint on a non-degenerate invariant torus is a non-wandering point of the flow.\nIn contrast, for a continual system with an absolutely continuous measure, all\npoints on such a torus are wandering. Furthermore, for continual systems with a\nsingular measure, we establish sufficient conditions on the measure and torus\nthat rule out the existence of both transitive trajectories and non-wandering\npoints.

The NBP prior is an\nadaptive generalization of the horseshoe prior with tunable hyperparameters\nthat control tail behavior, enabling a flexible range of sparsity, from strong\nshrinkage to ridge-like regularization. Unlike prior work that introduced the\ngroup inverse-gamma gamma (GIGG) prior by decomposing the NBP prior into\nstructured hierarchies, we show that directly controlling the tails is\nsufficient without requiring complex hierarchical constructions. Extending the\nnon-tail adaptive grouped half-Cauchy hierarchy of Xu et al., GRASP assigns the\nNBP prior to both local and group shrinkage parameters allowing adaptive\nsparsity within and across groups. A key contribution of this work is a novel\nframework to explicitly quantify correlations among shrinkage parameters within\na group, providing deeper insights into grouped shrinkage behavior. We also\nintroduce an efficient Metropolis-Hastings sampler for hyperparameter\nestimation. Empirical results on simulated and real-world data demonstrate the\nrobustness and versatility of GRASP across grouped regression problems with\nvarying sparsity and signal-to-noise ratios.",

Ultrathin ($\\sim$10 nm) metal\ncontacts were used to optically probe regions subject to ferroelectric\nswitching; photoluminescence spectroscopy identified the emergence of a\ntransition near 2.1 eV whose intensity scaled with the non-switching\npolarization quantified via positive-up negative-down (PUND) measurements.\nAccompanying thermally stimulated depolarization current (TSDC) and modulus\nspectroscopy measurements also observed the strengthening of a state near 2.1\neV. The origin of this feature is ascribed to transitions between a nitrogen\nvacancy and another defect deeper in the bandgap. Recognizing that the impurity\nconcentration is largely fixed, strengthening of this transition indicates an\nincrease in the number of nitrogen vacancies.

We\nshow that, generically, the pre-image of a non-contraction map is not a\nhypercube, but a proper cubical subgraph, and show that this manifests as\nalterations to the geodesic structure in the bulk, which leads to the violation\nof inequalities by holographic geometries obeying the RT formula.",

This paper proposes TEM^3-Learning (Time-Efficient\nMultimodal Multi-task Learning), a novel framework that jointly optimizes\ndriver emotion recognition, driver behavior recognition, traffic context\nrecognition, and vehicle behavior recognition through a two-stage architecture.\nThe first component, the mamba-based multi-view temporal-spatial feature\nextraction subnetwork (MTS-Mamba), introduces a forward-backward temporal\nscanning mechanism and global-local spatial attention to efficiently extract\nlow-cost temporal-spatial features from multi-view sequential images. The\nsecond component, the MTL-based gated multimodal feature integrator (MGMI),\nemploys task-specific multi-gating modules to adaptively highlight the most\nrelevant modality features for each task, effectively alleviating the negative\ntransfer problem in MTL.

In this work we use mean-field theory to derive an\nexpression for the superfluid stiffness of time-reversal symmetric\nsuperconductors at zero temperature by computing the energy of the mean-field\nground state as a function of pairing momentum. We show that the quantum\ngeometric contribution to superfluid stiffness is a consequence of broken\nGalilean invariance in the interaction Hamiltonian, arising from\nmomentum-dependent form factors related to the momentum dependence of Bloch\nstates. The effects of broken Galilean invariance are not fully parametrized by\nthe quantum metric considered in previous work. We obtain general lower and\nupper bounds that apply to both continuum and lattice models and present\nnumerical calculations of the precise value in several important cases. The\nsuperfluid stiffness of superconductivity in a Landau level saturates the lower\nbound and the superfluid stiffness of the other cases we consider is close to\nthe general lower bound we derive. In multilayer rhombohedral graphene the\ngeometric contribution is shown not to be the dominant contribution to the\nsuperfluid stiffness, despite the flat band behavior in the vicinity of the\nFermi level.

Recent studies have typically focused on fusing\ncross-domain spatio-temporal data to train unified Transformer-based models.\nHowever, these models suffer from quadratic computational complexity and high\nmemory overhead, limiting their scalability and practical deployment. Inspired\nby the efficiency of Mamba, a state space model with linear time complexity, we\nexplore its potential for efficient urban spatio-temporal prediction. However,\ndirectly applying Mamba as a spatio-temporal backbone leads to negative\ntransfer and severe performance degradation.

Damba-ST retains Mamba's linear\ncomplexity advantage while significantly enhancing its adaptability to\nheterogeneous domains. Specifically, we introduce two core innovations: (1) a\ndomain-adaptive state space model that partitions the latent representation\nspace into a shared subspace for learning cross-domain commonalities and\nindependent, domain-specific subspaces for capturing intra-domain\ndiscriminative features; (2) three distinct Domain Adapters, which serve as\ndomain-aware proxies to bridge disparate domain distributions and facilitate\nthe alignment of cross-domain commonalities.

    "abstract": "Medical image analysis increasingly relies on the integration of multiple\nimaging modalities to capture complementary anatomical and functional\ninformation, enabling more accurate diagnosis and treatment planning. Achieving\naligned feature representations across these diverse modalities is therefore\nimportant for effective multimodal analysis. While contrastive language-image\npre-training (CLIP) and its variant have enabled image-text alignments, they\nrequire explicitly paired data between arbitrary two modalities, which is\ndifficult to acquire in medical contexts. To address the gap, we present\nMultimodal Medical Image Binding with Text (M\\textsuperscript{3}Bind), a novel\npre-training framework that enables seamless alignment of multiple medical\nimaging modalities through a shared text representation space without requiring\nexplicit paired data between any two medical image modalities. Specifically,\nbased on the insight that different images can naturally bind with text,\nM\\textsuperscript{3}Bind first fine-tunes pre-trained CLIP-like image-text\nmodels to align their modality-specific text embedding space while preserving\ntheir original image-text alignments. Subsequently, we distill these\nmodality-specific text encoders into a unified model, creating a shared text\nembedding space. Experiments on X-ray, CT, retina, ECG, and pathological images\non multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that M\\textsuperscript{3}Bind achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in zero-shot, few-shot classification and\ncross-modal retrieval tasks compared to its CLIP-like counterparts.

Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs), which first predict a set of\nexplainable concepts from images and then perform classification based on these\nconcepts, are increasingly being adopted for explainable medical image\nclassification. However, the inherent explainability of CBMs introduces new\nchallenges when deploying trained models to new environments. Variations in\nimaging protocols and staining methods may induce concept-level shifts, such as\nalterations in color distribution and scale.

In\nthis work, a novel framework is proposed that exclusively leverages cross-modal\nface-voice associations to determine speaker activity.

Consequently, the\nsummarized information often includes irrelevant details or inaccurate\ntimestamps. To address these issues, we propose the first large Timeline\nIntelligence Model (TIM) for open-domain TLS, which is capable of effectively\nsummarizing open-domain timelines. Specifically, we begin by presenting a\nlarge-scale TLS dataset, comprising over 1,000 news topics and more than 3,000\nannotated TLS instances. Furthermore, we propose a progressive optimization\nstrategy, which gradually enhance summarization performance. It employs\ninstruction tuning to enhance summarization and topic-irrelevant information\nfiltering capabilities. Following this, it exploits a novel dual-alignment\nreward learning method that incorporates both semantic and temporal\nperspectives, thereby improving the understanding of topic evolution\nprinciples.

    "abstract": "Architectural obfuscation - e.g., permuting hidden-state tensors, linearly\ntransforming embedding tables, or remapping tokens - has recently gained\ntraction as a lightweight substitute for heavyweight cryptography in\nprivacy-preserving large-language-model (LLM) inference. While recent work has\nshown that these techniques can be broken under dedicated reconstruction\nattacks, their impact on mechanistic interpretability has not been\nsystematically studied. In particular, it remains unclear whether scrambling a\nnetwork's internal representations truly thwarts efforts to understand how the\nmodel works, or simply relocates the same circuits to an unfamiliar coordinate\nsystem. We address this gap by analyzing a GPT-2-small model trained from\nscratch with a representative obfuscation map. Assuming the obfuscation map is\nprivate and the original basis is hidden (mirroring an honest-but-curious\nserver), we apply logit-lens attribution, causal path-patching, and\nattention-head ablation to locate and manipulate known circuits. Our findings\nreveal that obfuscation dramatically alters activation patterns within\nattention heads yet preserves the layer-wise computational graph. This\ndisconnect hampers reverse-engineering of user prompts: causal traces lose\ntheir alignment with baseline semantics, and token-level logit attributions\nbecome too noisy to reconstruct. At the same time, feed-forward and residual\npathways remain functionally intact, suggesting that obfuscation degrades\nfine-grained interpretability without compromising top-level task performance.\nThese results establish quantitative evidence that architectural obfuscation\ncan simultaneously (i) retain global model behaviour and (ii) impede\nmechanistic analyses of user-specific content. By mapping where\ninterpretability breaks down, our study provides guidance for future privacy\ndefences and for robustness-aware interpretability tooling.",

In particular,\nreachability analysis is increasingly used in Open-Source Software (OSS)\nprojects to identify reachable vulnerabilities (e.g., CVEs) through call\ngraphs, enabling a focus on exploitable risks. Performing reachability analysis\ntypically requires the vulnerable function (VF) to track the call chains from\ndownstream applications. However, such crucial information is usually\nunavailable in modern vulnerability databases like NVD. While directly\nextracting VF from modified functions in vulnerability patches is intuitive,\npatches are not always available. Moreover, our preliminary study shows that\nover 26% of VF do not exist in the modified functions. Meanwhile, simply\nignoring patches to search vulnerable functions suffers from overwhelming\nnoises and lexical gaps between descriptions and source code. Given that almost\nhalf of the vulnerabilities are equipped with patches, a holistic solution that\nhandles both scenarios with and without patches is required. To meet real-world\nneeds and automatically localize VF, we present VFArch\\=e, a dual-mode approach\ndesigned for disclosed vulnerabilities, applicable in scenarios with or without\navailable patch links.

To address this issue, this\npaper proposes a post-training optimization paradigm called the Incremental\nTraining Strategy to enhance the reasoning ability of SVLMs. Firstly, we\nconstructed a Self-Supervised Chain-of-Thought (COT) Data Construction System,\nwhich leverages multiple LVLMs with 7B parameters or more to transform original\ndata into COT data in a self-supervised manner. Our proposed Incremental\nTraining Strategy consists of four stages. Stage 1 injects domain knowledge by\nperforming Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to the pretrained model on the COT\ndata. Stage 2 aligns the COT data format by conducting a small amount of Group\nRelative Policy Optimization (GRPO) training constrained only by format rewards\non the COT data. Stage 3 enhances reasoning ability by applying GRPO training\non the COT data with constraints on both format and accuracy rewards. The\nresulting model shows significant improvement compared to the baseline. Stage 4\naddresses the limited capacity of the SVLMs and the weak ability to capture\ncomplex patterns by proposing ClipLow GRPO (CLGRPO) to constrain the capture\nspace of the training process. We conducted extensive comparative and ablation\nexperiments on the abstract semantic recognition dataset EMOSet-118K.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the\nreasoning ability of 1B SVLM.

In this study, we uncover three systematic\ndistortions in the way six popular LLMs evaluate press freedom in 180 countries\ncompared to expert assessments of the World Press Freedom Index (WPFI). The six\nLLMs exhibit a negative misalignment, consistently underestimating press\nfreedom, with individual models rating between 71% to 93% of countries as less\nfree. We also identify a paradoxical pattern we term differential misalignment:\nLLMs disproportionately underestimate press freedom in countries where it is\nstrongest. Additionally, five of the six LLMs exhibit positive home bias,\nrating their home countries' press freedoms more favorably than would be\nexpected given their negative misalignment with the human benchmark. In some\ncases, LLMs rate their home countries between 7% to 260% more positively than\nexpected.

Many of these languages can be viewed\nas high level notations of answer set programs structured to represent\ntransition systems.

We propose a new action language called BC+, which closes the\ngap between action languages and the modern ASP language.

Weakly supervised learning\nprovides a more efficient alternative by leveraging sparse and coarse\nannotations instead of dense, precise ones. However, segmentation performance\ndegradation and overfitting caused by sparse annotations remain key challenges.\nTo address these issues, we propose CmFNet, a novel 3D weakly supervised\ncross-modal medical image segmentation approach. CmFNet consists of three main\ncomponents: a modality-specific feature learning network, a cross-modal feature\nlearning network, and a hybrid-supervised learning strategy. Specifically, the\nmodality-specific feature learning network and the cross-modal feature learning\nnetwork effectively integrate complementary information from multi-modal\nimages, enhancing shared features across modalities to improve segmentation\nperformance. Additionally, the hybrid-supervised learning strategy guides\nsegmentation through scribble supervision, intra-modal regularization, and\ninter-modal consistency, modeling spatial and contextual relationships while\npromoting feature alignment. Our approach effectively mitigates overfitting,\ndelivering robust segmentation results. It excels in segmenting both\nchallenging small tumor regions and common anatomical structures. Extensive\nexperiments on a clinical cross-modal nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) dataset\n(including CT and MR imaging) and the publicly available CT Whole Abdominal\nOrgan dataset (WORD) show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art weakly\nsupervised methods.

Our\nmethod is shown to outperform a previous approach in terms of computation time.\nMoreover, the quality of the obtained partitioning is found to be comparable to\nor better than that of the baseline in all but a few cases, as measured by\n$L_Q^{}$.

X-ray diffraction examination verifies the structural integrity of\nthe synthesized heterostructures (HTs). Optical and photoluminescence spectra\nwere recorded to assess the variation in absorption and emission of the\nGa$_2$O$_3$-coated HTs in comparison to the pristine ZnO. We conducted\ncomparative density-functional theory (DFT) computations to corroborate the\nmeasured band gaps of both categories of HTs. To assess the stability of our\ndevices, the transient response to on/off light switching under zero bias has\nbeen studied. The rise time $\\tau_{r1}$ ($\\tau_{r2}$) is 2300 (500) ms and the\ndecay time $\\tau_{d1}$ ($\\tau_{d2}$) is 2700 (5000) ms have been observed for\nbare ZnO and ZnO/Ga$_2$O$_3$ HTs, respectively. A significant amount of change\nwas also observed in the electrical transport properties from bare ZnO to\nZnO/Ga$_2$O$_3$. To see the performance of device, responsivity (R) and\ndetectivity (D = 1/NEP$_B$) have been measured. It is evident from observation\nthat responsivity of a device shows maximum value in UV region while it is\nreducing with visible region for HTs. In case of detectivity, the maximum value\nreached was $145 \\times 10^{14}$ Hz$^{1/2}$/W (at ~ 200 nm) and $38 \\times\n10^{14}$ Hz$^{1/2}$/W (at 300 nm) for Ga$_2$O$_3$ coated ZnO, and bare ZnO HTs,\nrespectively. The maximum responsivity measured for the bare ZnO HTs is 7 (A/W)\nwhile that of Ga$_2$O$_3$ coated ZnO HTs is 38 (A/W).

    "abstract": "Multiple instance learning (MIL) has shown significant promise in\nhistopathology whole slide image (WSI) analysis for cancer diagnosis and\nprognosis. However, the inherent spatial heterogeneity of WSIs presents\ncritical challenges, as morphologically similar tissue types are often\ndispersed across distant anatomical regions. Conventional MIL methods struggle\nto model these scattered tissue distributions and capture cross-regional\nspatial interactions effectively. To address these limitations, we propose a\nnovel Multiple instance learning framework with Context-Aware Clustering\n(MiCo), designed to enhance cross-regional intra-tissue correlations and\nstrengthen inter-tissue semantic associations in WSIs. MiCo begins by\nclustering instances to distill discriminative morphological patterns, with\ncluster centroids serving as semantic anchors. To enhance cross-regional\nintra-tissue correlations, MiCo employs a Cluster Route module, which\ndynamically links instances of the same tissue type across distant regions via\nfeature similarity. These semantic anchors act as contextual hubs, propagating\nsemantic relationships to refine instance-level representations. To eliminate\nsemantic fragmentation and strengthen inter-tissue semantic associations, MiCo\nintegrates a Cluster Reducer module, which consolidates redundant anchors while\nenhancing information exchange between distinct semantic groups. Extensive\nexperiments on two challenging tasks across nine large-scale public cancer\ndatasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MiCo, showcasing its superiority over\nstate-of-the-art methods.

We introduce SeamGPT, an auto-regressive model\nthat generates cutting seams by mimicking professional workflows. Our key\ntechnical innovation lies in formulating surface cutting as a next token\nprediction task: sample point clouds on mesh vertices and edges, encode them as\nshape conditions, and employ a GPT-style transformer to sequentially predict\nseam segments with quantized 3D coordinates. Our approach achieves exceptional\nperformance on UV unwrapping benchmarks containing both manifold and\nnon-manifold meshes, including artist-created, and 3D-scanned models.

However, limited edge capacity makes it\nchallenging to decide which services to deploy locally versus in the cloud,\nespecially under unknown service demand and dynamic network conditions.

In this work, we propose an efficient solution\n\\emph{Dual-Hierarchy Labelling (DHL)} for distance querying on dynamic road\nnetworks from a novel perspective, which incorporates two hierarchies with\ndifferent but complementary data structures to support efficient query and\nupdate processing. Specifically, our proposed solution is comprised of three\nmain components: \\emph{query hierarchy}, \\emph{update hierarchy}, and\n\\emph{hierarchical labelling}, where \\emph{query hierarchy} enables efficient\nquery answering by exploring only a small subset of vertices in the labels of\ntwo query vertices and \\emph{update hierarchy} supports efficient maintenance\nof distance labelling under edge weight increase or decrease. We further\ndevelop dynamic algorithms to reflect dynamic changes by efficiently\nmaintaining the update hierarchy and hierarchical labelling. We also propose a\nparallel variant of our dynamic algorithms by exploiting labelling structure.\nWe evaluate our methods on 10 large road networks and it shows that our methods\nsignificantly outperform the state-of-the-art methods, i.e., achieving\nconsiderably faster construction and update time, while being consistently 2-4\ntimes faster in terms of query processing and consuming only 10\\%-20\\%\nlabelling space.",

In contrast to existing schemes optimized for a single target, an\neffective network-level approach has to ensure consistent localization accuracy\nthroughout the entire service area.

At the core of the model is a reward\nfunction - a monotone set function that maps each set of actions taken by the\nagent into an expected reward to the principal. To incentivize the agent, the\nprincipal offers a contract specifying the fraction of the reward to be paid,\nand the agent responds with their optimal action set. The goal is to compute\nthe contract that maximizes the principal's expected utility.\n  Previous work showed that when the reward function is gross substitutes (GS),\nthe optimal contract can be computed in polynomial time, but the problem is\nNP-hard for the broader class of Submodular functions. This raised the\nquestion: is GS the true boundary of tractability for the optimal contract\nproblem? We prove that tractability extends to the strictly broader class of\nUltra functions. Interestingly, GS constitutes precisely the intersection of\nUltra and Submodular functions, and our result reveals that it is Ultra - not\nSubmodular - that drives tractability, overturning the prevailing belief that\nthe submodularity component of GS is essential.

Upon termination, it guarantees that\nthe worst-case approximation error lies within a desired tolerance range,\npredefined by the decision maker, for each of the two objective functions.\nTheoretical results are derived, about the worst-case number of PF samples\nrequired to guarantee the wanted accuracy, both in general and for specific\nsampling methods from the literature. A comparative analysis, both theoretical\nand numerical, demonstrates the superiority of the proposed method with respect\nto popular ones. The approach is finally showcased in a constrained\npath-following problem for a 2-axis positioning system and in a steady-state\noptimization problem for a Continuous-flow Stirred Tank Reactor. An open demo\nimplementation of ROBBO is made available online.",

    "abstract": "Emerging crypto economies still hemorrhage digital assets because legacy\nwallets leak private keys at almost every layer of the software stack, from\nuser-space libraries to kernel memory dumps. This paper solves that twin crisis\nof security and interoperability by re-imagining key management as a\nplatform-level service anchored in ARM TrustZone through OP-TEE. Our\narchitecture fractures the traditional monolithic Trusted Application into\nper-chain modules housed in a multi-tenant TA store, finally breaking OP-TEE's\nsingle-binary ceiling. A cryptographically sealed firmware-over-the-air\npipeline welds each TA set to an Android system image, enabling hot-swap\nupdates while Verified Boot enforces rollback protection. Every package carries\na chained signature developer first, registry second so even a compromised\nsupply chain cannot smuggle malicious code past the Secure World's RSA-PSS\ngatekeeper. Inside the TEE, strict inter-TA isolation, cache partitioning, and\nGP-compliant crypto APIs ensure secrets never bleed across trust boundaries or\ntiming domains. The Rich Execution Environment can interact only via\nhardware-mediated Secure Monitor Calls, collapsing the surface exposed to\nmalware in Android space. End-users enjoy a single polished interface yet can\ninstall or retire Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, or tomorrow's chain with one tap,\nshrinking both storage footprint and audit scope. For auditors, the composition\nmodel slashes duplicated verification effort by quarantining blockchain logic\ninside narrowly scoped modules that share formally specified interfaces. Our\nthreat analysis spans six adversary layers and shows how the design neutralizes\nREE malware sniffing, OTA injection, and cross-module side channels without\nexotic hardware. A reference implementation on AOSP exports a Wallet Manager\nHAL, custom SELinux domains, and a CI/CD pipeline that vet community modules\nbefore release. The result is not merely another hardware wallet but a\nprogrammable substrate that can evolve at the velocity of the blockchain\necosystem. By welding radical extensibility to hardware-anchored assurance, the\nplatform closes the security-usability gap that has long stymied mass-market\nself-custody. We posit that modular TEEs are the missing OS primitive for Web3,\nmuch as virtual memory unlocked multi-tasking in classical computing.

Our hybrid MD/MC simulations show that the (CoNiFe)86(Al7Ti7) alloy\nexhibits the highest amount of L12 nanoprecipitates. We find that L12\nprecipitation increases the SFE, with higher Al and Ti contents leading to\ngreater increases.

This has inspired many recent works on mitigating\nmiscalibration, particularly through post-hoc recalibration methods that aim to\nobtain calibrated probabilities without sacrificing the classification\nperformance of pre-trained models. In this study, we summarize and categorize\nprevious works into three general strategies: intuitively designed methods,\nbinning-based methods, and methods based on formulations of ideal calibration.\nThrough theoretical and practical analysis, we highlight ten common limitations\nin previous approaches. To address these limitations, we propose a\nprobabilistic learning framework for calibration called h-calibration, which\ntheoretically constructs an equivalent learning formulation for canonical\ncalibration with boundedness. On this basis, we design a simple yet effective\npost-hoc calibration algorithm. Our method not only overcomes the ten\nidentified limitations but also achieves markedly better performance than\ntraditional methods, as validated by extensive experiments. We further analyze,\nboth theoretically and experimentally, the relationship and advantages of our\nlearning objective compared to traditional proper scoring rule. In summary, our\nprobabilistic framework derives an approximately equivalent differentiable\nobjective for learning error-bounded calibrated probabilities, elucidating the\ncorrespondence and convergence properties of computational statistics with\nrespect to theoretical bounds in canonical calibration. The theoretical\neffectiveness is verified on standard post-hoc calibration benchmarks by\nachieving state-of-the-art performance.

While\nLiDAR provides rich spatial information, 4D radar offers velocity measurement\nand remains robust under adverse conditions. As a result, increasing studies\nhave focused on the 4D radar-LiDAR fusion method to enhance the perception.\nHowever, the misalignment between different modalities is often overlooked. To\naddress this challenge and leverage the strengths of both modalities, we\npropose a LiDAR detection framework enhanced by 4D radar motion status and\ncross-modal uncertainty. The object movement information from 4D radar is first\ncaptured using a Dynamic Motion-Aware Encoding module during feature extraction\nto enhance 4D radar predictions. Subsequently, the instance-wise uncertainties\nof bounding boxes are estimated to mitigate the cross-modal misalignment and\nrefine the final LiDAR predictions. Extensive experiments on the View-of-Delft\n(VoD) dataset highlight the effectiveness of our method, achieving\nstate-of-the-art performance with the mAP of 74.89% in the entire area and\n88.70% within the driving corridor while maintaining a real-time inference\nspeed of 30.02 FPS.",

    "abstract": "The intrinsic non-perturbative features of string-theoretic corrections,\nparticularly those arising from T-duality, have been shown to naturally\nintroduce an effective ultraviolet (UV) cutoff into the gravitational\nframework. This cutoff, often referred to as the zero-point length in the\ncontext of path integral duality, acts as a fundamental minimal length scale\nthat regulates short-distance divergences. Using the established correspondence\nbetween T-duality and path integral duality, it has been shown that the static\nNewtonian potential becomes regularized at small distances. Building upon this\nregular behavior, we proceed to construct self-consistent, spherically\nsymmetric, and electrically neutral wormhole solutions, which remain free of\ncurvature singularities and embodies the effects of this duality-induced UV\ncompletion. We explore wormhole configurations with the aim of minimizing\nviolations of the null energy condition (NEC). In fact, solutions with a\nconstant redshift function or specific shape functions generally exhibit NEC\nviolations throughout the entire spacetime. To address this, we explore two\ndistinct thin shell constructions: (i) wormholes formed by matching an interior\nwormhole geometry to an exterior Schwarzschild vacuum spacetime, thereby\nconfining exotic matter to a localized region; and (ii) standard thin-shell\nwormholes generated by gluing two identical black hole spacetimes across a\ntimelike hypersurface situated outside their event horizons. In both cases, the\nNEC violations are minimised and restricted to a finite region, improving the\nphysical plausibility and traversability of the resulting configurations.",

Understanding these representations is\nparticularly important in complex tasks like safety evaluation. Such tasks rely\non high-level semantic information (e.g., about actions) to make decisions\nabout abstract categories (e.g., whether a situation is dangerous). In this\ncontext, it may desirable for C-XAI concepts to show some variability,\nsuggesting that the AI is capable of generalising beyond the concrete details\nof a situation. However, it is unclear whether people recognise and appreciate\nsuch generalisations and can distinguish them from other, less desirable forms\nof imprecision. This was investigated in an experimental railway safety\nscenario. Participants evaluated the performance of a simulated AI that\nevaluated whether traffic scenes involving people were dangerous. To explain\nthese decisions, the AI provided concepts in the form of similar image\nsnippets. These concepts differed in their match with the classified image,\neither regarding a highly relevant feature (i.e., relation to tracks) or a less\nrelevant feature (i.e., actions). Contrary to the hypotheses, concepts that\ngeneralised over less relevant features led to ratings that were lower than for\nprecisely matching concepts and comparable to concepts that systematically\nmisrepresented these features. Conversely, participants were highly sensitive\nto imprecisions in relevant features. These findings cast doubts on whether\npeople spontaneously recognise generalisations.

Paillier algorithm allows addition and scalar\nmultiplication operations in dencrypted state, which can effectively protect\nprivacy. However, its computational efficiency is limited by complex modulo\noperations due to the ciphertext expansion followed by encryption. To\naccelerate its decryption operation, the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) is\noften used to optimize these modulo operations, which lengthens the decryption\ncomputation chain in turn. To address this issue, we propose an eCRT-Paillier\ndecryption algorithm that shortens the decryption computation chain by\ncombining precomputed parameters and eliminating extra judgment operations\nintroduced by Montgomery modular multiplications. These two improvements reduce\n50% modular multiplications and 60% judgment operations in the postprocessing\nof the CRT-Paillier decryption algorithm. Based on these improvements, we\npropose a highly parallel full-pipeline architecture to eliminate stalls caused\nby multiplier reuse in traditional modular exponentiation operations. This\narchitecture also adopts some optimizations such as simplifying modular\nexponentiation units by dividing the exponent into segments and parallelizing\ndata flow by multi-core instantiation. Finally, a high-throughput and efficient\nPaillier accelerator named MESA was implemented on the Xilinx Virtex-7 FPGA for\nevaluation, which can complete a decryption using 2048-bit key within 0.577ms\nunder 100 MHz clock frequency.

Traditional adaptive methods, such as Adam or\nRMSprop , adapt learning dynamics using only the magnitude of gradients, often\noverlooking important geometric cues.Geometric cues refer to directional\ninformation, such as the alignment between current gradients and past updates,\nwhich reflects the local curvature and consistency of the optimization path.\nHGM addresses this by incorporating a hindsight mechanism that evaluates the\ncosine similarity between the current gradient and accumulated momentum. This\nallows it to distinguish between coherent and conflicting gradient directions,\nincreasing the learning rate when updates align and reducing it in regions of\noscillation or noise. The result is a more responsive optimizer that\naccelerates convergence in smooth regions of the loss surface while maintaining\nstability in sharper or more erratic areas. Despite this added adaptability,\nthe method preserves the computational and memory efficiency of existing\noptimizers.By more intelligently responding to the structure of the\noptimization landscape, HGM provides a simple yet effective improvement over\nexisting approaches, particularly in non-convex settings like that of deep\nneural network training.",

We hope our\nfindings can guide mechanistic studies on in-context learning, and provide a\ncall to action, to pave the way for more open-ended search algorithms for more\neffective LLM prompting.",

    "abstract": "Supporting decision-making has long been a central vision in the field of\nspatio-temporal intelligence. While prior work has improved the timeliness and\naccuracy of spatio-temporal forecasting, converting these forecasts into\nactionable strategies remains a key challenge. A main limitation is the\ndecoupling of the prediction and the downstream decision phases, which can\nsignificantly degrade the downstream efficiency. For example, in emergency\nresponse, the priority is successful resource allocation and intervention, not\njust incident prediction. To this end, it is essential to propose an Adaptive\nSpatio-Temporal Early Decision model (ASTER) that reforms the forecasting\nparadigm from event anticipation to actionable decision support. This framework\nensures that information is directly used for decision-making, thereby\nmaximizing overall effectiveness. Specifically, ASTER introduces a new\nResource-aware Spatio-Temporal interaction module (RaST) that adaptively\ncaptures long- and short-term dependencies under dynamic resource conditions,\nproducing context-aware spatiotemporal representations. To directly generate\nactionable decisions, we further design a Preference-oriented decision agent\n(Poda) based on multi-objective reinforcement learning, which transforms\npredictive signals into resource-efficient intervention strategies by deriving\noptimal actions under specific preferences and dynamic constraints.\nExperimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the\nstate-of-the-art performance of ASTER in improving both early prediction\naccuracy and resource allocation outcomes across six downstream metrics.",

    "abstract": "Many systems contain latent variables that make their dynamics partially\nunidentifiable or cause distribution shifts in the observed statistics between\noffline and online data. However, existing control techniques often assume\naccess to complete dynamics or perfect simulators with fully observable states,\nwhich are necessary to verify whether the system remains within a safe set\n(forward invariance) or safe actions are consistently feasible at all times. To\naddress this limitation, we propose a technique for designing probabilistic\nsafety certificates for systems with latent variables. A key technical enabler\nis the formulation of invariance conditions in probability space, which can be\nconstructed using observed statistics in the presence of distribution shifts\ndue to latent variables. We use this invariance condition to construct a safety\ncertificate that can be implemented efficiently in real-time control. The\nproposed safety certificate can continuously find feasible actions that control\nlong-term risk to stay within tolerance. Stochastic safe control and (causal)\nreinforcement learning have been studied in isolation until now. To the best of\nour knowledge, the proposed work is the first to use causal reinforcement\nlearning to quantify long-term risk for the design of safety certificates. This\nintegration enables safety certificates to efficiently ensure long-term safety\nin the presence of latent variables. The effectiveness of the proposed safety\ncertificate is demonstrated in numerical simulations.",

This problem is particularly limiting in\ncutting-edge brain imaging performed at field strengths >= 7T and using\nhigh-performance head gradients. Methods: To address this issue, the present\nwork proposes to fundamentally eliminate the encoding ambiguity in head\ngradients by using a unipolar z-gradient design that takes advantage of the\nsignal-free range on one side of the imaging volume. This concept is\ndemonstrated by implementation of a unipolar head gradient for operation at 7T.\nResults: Imaging in phantoms and in vivo demonstrates elimination of\nbackfolding due to encoding ambiguity. At the same time, the unipolar design\nachieves efficiency on par with conventional bipolar design, resulting in high\namplitude and slew-rate performance. Conclusion: The prospect of gradient\nsystems based on a unipolar design holds promise for all advanced neuroimaging\nthat demands high gradient performance. It will make the greatest difference at\n7T and beyond where the absence of ambiguity removes a key concern and\nconstraint in terms of RF behaviour and instrumentation.",

On rough inclines, the flow exhibits Bagnold's\nvelocity profile and follows the so-called $\\mu(I)$ local rheology. On\ninsufficiently rough or smooth inclines, however, velocity slip occurs at the\nbottom and a basal layer with strong agitation emerges below the bulk, which is\nnot predicted by the local rheology. Here, we use discrete element method\nsimulations to study detailed dynamics of the basal layer in granular flows\ndown both smooth and rough inclines. We control the roughness via a\ndimensionless parameter, $R_a$, varied systematically from 0 (flat, frictional\nplane) to near 1 (very rough plane). Three flow regimes are identified: a slip\nregime ($R_a \\lesssim 0.45$) where a dilated basal layer appears, a no-slip\nregime ($R_a \\gtrsim 0.6$) and an intermediate transition regime. In the slip\nregime, the kinematics profiles (velocity, shear rate and granular temperature)\nof the basal layer strongly deviate from Bagnold's profiles. General basal slip\nlaws are developed which express the slip velocity as a function of the local\nshear rate (or granular temperature), base roughness and slope angle. Moreover,\nthe basal layer thickness is insensitive to flow conditions but depends\nsomewhat on the inter-particle coefficient of restitution. Finally, we show\nthat the rheological properties of the basal layer do not follow the $\\mu(I)$\nrheology, but are captured by Bagnold's stress scaling and an extended kinetic\ntheory for granular flows.

    "abstract": "Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents have made significant progress in\nautomating digital tasks through the utilization of computer vision and\nlanguage models. Nevertheless, existing agent systems encounter notable\nlimitations. Firstly, they predominantly depend on trial and error decision\nmaking rather than progressive reasoning, thereby lacking the capability to\nlearn and adapt from interactive encounters. Secondly, these systems are\nassessed using overly simplistic single step accuracy metrics, which do not\nadequately reflect the intricate nature of real world GUI interactions. In this\npaper, we present CogniGUI, a cognitive framework developed to overcome these\nlimitations by enabling adaptive learning for GUI automation resembling\nhuman-like behavior. Inspired by Kahneman's Dual Process Theory, our approach\ncombines two main components: (1) an omni parser engine that conducts immediate\nhierarchical parsing of GUI elements through quick visual semantic analysis to\nidentify actionable components, and (2) a Group based Relative Policy\nOptimization (GRPO) grounding agent that assesses multiple interaction paths\nusing a unique relative reward system, promoting minimal and efficient\noperational routes. This dual-system design facilitates iterative ''exploration\nlearning mastery'' cycles, enabling the agent to enhance its strategies over\ntime based on accumulated experience. Moreover, to assess the generalization\nand adaptability of agent systems, we introduce ScreenSeek, a comprehensive\nbenchmark that includes multi application navigation, dynamic state\ntransitions, and cross interface coherence, which are often overlooked\nchallenges in current benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that\nCogniGUI surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both the current GUI grounding\nbenchmarks and our newly proposed benchmark.",

We identify the granularity of motion tokenization as a\ncritical bottleneck: fine-grained tokenization induces local dependency issues,\nwhere LLMs overemphasize short-term coherence at the expense of global semantic\nalignment, while coarse-grained tokenization sacrifices motion details. To\nresolve this issue, we propose PlanMoGPT, an LLM-based framework integrating\nprogressive planning and flow-enhanced fine-grained motion tokenization. First,\nour progressive planning mechanism leverages LLMs' autoregressive capabilities\nto hierarchically generate motion tokens by starting from sparse global plans\nand iteratively refining them into full sequences. Second, our flow-enhanced\ntokenizer doubles the downsampling resolution and expands the codebook size by\neight times, minimizing detail loss during discretization, while a\nflow-enhanced decoder recovers motion nuances. Extensive experiments on\ntext-to-motion benchmarks demonstrate that it achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance, improving FID scores by 63.8% (from 0.380 to 0.141) on\nlong-sequence generation while enhancing motion diversity by 49.9% compared to\nexisting methods.

To address\nthis, we pioneer the formal study of the First-Segment-Then-Aggregate (FSTA)\ndecomposition technique to accelerate iterative solvers. Specifically, FSTA\npreserves stable solution segments during the search, aggregates nodes within\neach segment into fixed hypernodes, and focuses the search only on unstable\nportions. Yet, a key challenge lies in identifying which segments should be\naggregated by FSTA. To this end, we then introduce Learning-to-Segment (L2Seg),\na novel neural framework to intelligently differentiate potentially stable and\nunstable portions for FSTA decomposition.

Empirical results on CVRP and\nVRPTW suggest that L2Seg accelerates state-of-the-art iterative solvers by up\nto 7x.

The proposed design enables real-time environmental\nmapping by estimating the distance between the robotic disks and the\nsurrounding tissue, thereby facilitating safer operation through advanced\ncontrol strategies. The experiment has proven that its accuracy in obstacle\ndetection can reach 0.19 mm. Fabricated using flexible printed circuit (FPC)\ntechnology, the sensor demonstrates a modular and cost-effective design with\ncompact dimensions and low noise interference. Its adaptable parameters allow\ncompatibility with various continuum robot architectures, offering a promising\nsolution for enhancing intraoperative perception and control in surgical\nrobotics.",

    "abstract": "With the increasing complexity and rapid expansion of the scale of AI systems\nin cloud platforms, the log data generated during system operation is massive,\nunstructured, and semantically ambiguous, which brings great challenges to\nfault location and system self-repair. In order to solve this problem, this\npaper proposes an intelligent log processing and automatic debugging framework\nbased on Large Language Model (LLM), named Intelligent Debugger (LLM-ID). This\nmethod is extended on the basis of the existing pre-trained Transformer model,\nand integrates a multi-stage semantic inference mechanism to realize the\ncontext understanding of system logs and the automatic reconstruction of fault\nchains. Firstly, the system log is dynamically structured, and the unsupervised\nclustering and embedding mechanism is used to extract the event template and\nsemantic schema. Subsequently, the fine-tuned LLM combined with the multi-round\nattention mechanism to perform contextual reasoning on the log sequence to\ngenerate potential fault assumptions and root cause paths. Furthermore, this\npaper introduces a reinforcement learning-based policy-guided recovery planner,\nwhich is driven by the remediation strategy generated by LLM to support dynamic\ndecision-making and adaptive debugging in the cloud environment. Compared with\nthe existing rule engine or traditional log analysis system, the proposed model\nhas stronger semantic understanding ability, continuous learning ability and\nheterogeneous environment adaptability. Experiments on the cloud platform log\ndataset show that LLM-ID improves the fault location accuracy by 16.2%, which\nis significantly better than the current mainstream methods",

    "abstract": "Next generation cellular deployments are expected to exploit the 6-24 GHz\nfrequency range 3 (FR3) and extremely large-scale multiple-input\nmultiple-output (XL-MIMO) to enable ultra-high data rates and reliability.\nHowever, the significantly enlarged antenna apertures and higher carrier\nfrequencies render the far-field and spatial stationarity assumptions in the\nexisting 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP) channel models invalid,\ngiving rise to new features such as near-field propagation and spatial\nnon-stationarity (SNS). Despite extensive prior research, incorporating these\nnew features within the standardized channel modeling framework remains an open\nissue. To address this, this paper presents a channel modeling framework for\nXL-MIMO systems that incorporates both near-field and SNS features, adopted by\n3GPP. For the near-field propagation feature, the framework models the\ndistances from the base station (BS) and user equipment to the spherical-wave\nsources associated with clusters. These distances are used to characterize\nelement-wise variations of path parameters, such as nonlinear changes in phase\nand angle. To capture the effect of SNS at the BS side, a stochastic-based\napproach is proposed to model SNS caused by incomplete scattering, by\nestablishing power attenuation factors from visibility probability and\nvisibility region to characterize antenna element-wise path power variation. In\naddition, a physical blocker-based approach is introduced to model SNS effects\ncaused by partial blockage. Finally, a simulation framework for near-field and\nSNS is developed within the structure of the existing 3GPP channel model.\nPerformance evaluations demonstrate that the near-field model captures higher\nchannel capacity potential compared to the far-field model.

Yet, despite\nits importance, only a handful of diagonalization algorithms exist, and\ncorrespondingly few families of fast-forwardable Hamiltonians have been\nidentified. This paper introduces classical optimization algorithms for\nHamiltonian diagonalization by formulating a cost function that penalizes\noff-diagonal terms and enforces unitarity via an orthogonality constraint, both\nexpressed in the Pauli operator basis. We pinpoint a class of Hamiltonians that\nhighlights severe drawbacks of existing methods, including exponential\nper-iteration cost, exponential circuit depth, or convergence to spurious\noptima. Our approach overcomes these shortcomings, achieving polynomial-time\nefficiency while provably avoiding suboptimal points. As a result, we broaden\nthe known realm of fast-forwardable systems, showing that\nquantum-diagonalizable Hamiltonians extend to cases generated by exponentially\nlarge Lie algebras. On the practical side, we also present a\nrandomized-coordinate variant that achieves a more efficient per-iteration cost\nthan the deterministic counterpart.

    "abstract": "People are commonly interested in predicting a statistical property of a\nrandom event such as mean and variance. Proper scoring rules assess the quality\nof predictions and require that the expected score gets uniquely maximized at\nthe precise prediction, in which case we call the score directly elicits the\nproperty. Previous research work has widely studied the existence and the\ncharacterization of proper scoring rules for different properties, but little\nliterature discusses the choice of proper scoring rules for applications at\nhand. In this paper, we explore a novel task, the indirect elicitation of\nproperties with parametric assumptions, where the target property is a function\nof several directly-elicitable sub-properties and the total score is a weighted\nsum of proper scoring rules for each sub-property. Because of the restriction\nto a parametric model class, different settings for the weights lead to\ndifferent constrained optimal solutions. Our goal is to figure out how the\nchoice of weights affects the estimation of the target property and which\nchoice is the best. We start it with simulation studies and observe an\ninteresting pattern: in most cases, the optimal estimation of the target\nproperty changes monotonically with the increase of each weight, and the best\nconfiguration of weights is often to set some weights as zero. To understand\nhow it happens, we first establish the elementary theoretical framework and\nthen provide deeper sufficient conditions for the case of two sub-properties\nand of more sub-properties respectively. The theory on 2-D cases perfectly\ninterprets the experimental results. In higher-dimensional situations, we\nespecially study the linear cases and suggest that more complex settings can be\nunderstood with locally mapping into linear situations or using linear\napproximations when the true values of sub-properties are close enough to the\nparametric space.",

    "abstract": "The color appearance of a pathological image is highly related to the imaging\nprotocols, the proportion of different dyes, and the scanning devices.\nComputer-aided diagnostic systems may deteriorate when facing these\ncolor-variant pathological images. In this work, we propose a stain\nnormalization method called StainPIDR. We try to eliminate this color\ndiscrepancy by decoupling the image into structure features and\nvector-quantized color features, restaining the structure features with the\ntarget color features, and decoding the stained structure features to\nnormalized pathological images. We assume that color features decoupled by\ndifferent images with the same color should be exactly the same. Under this\nassumption, we train a fixed color vector codebook to which the decoupled color\nfeatures will map. In the restaining part, we utilize the cross-attention\nmechanism to efficiently stain the structure features. As the target color\n(decoupled from a selected template image) will also affect the performance of\nstain normalization, we further design a template image selection algorithm to\nselect a template from a given dataset. In our extensive experiments, we\nvalidate the effectiveness of StainPIDR and the template image selection\nalgorithm. All the results show that our method can perform well in the stain\nnormalization task. The code of StainPIDR will be publicly available later.",

While\nspecialized network infrastructure (e.g., time-sensitive networking (TSN)\nswitches) provides deterministic data transport across the network, achieving\nstrict end-to-end timing guarantees requires equally capable end devices to\nsupport deterministic traffic. These end devices, however, often employ\ngeneral-purpose computing platforms like standard PCs, which lack native\nsupport for deterministic traffic and suffer from unpredictable delays\nintroduced by their software stack and system architecture. Although\nspecialized NICs with hardware scheduling offload can mitigate this problem,\nthe limited compatibility hinders their widespread adoption, particularly for\ncost-sensitive applications or in legacy devices.\n  To fill this gap, this paper proposes a novel software-based driver model,\nnamely KeepON, to enable the support of deterministic packet transmissions on\nend devices equipped with standard NICs. The key idea of KeepON is to have the\nNIC keep on transmitting fixed-size data chunks as placeholders, thereby\nmaintaining a predictable temporal transmission pattern. The real-time packets\ngenerated by the mission-critical application(s) will then be precisely\ninserted into this stream by replacing placeholders at the designated position\nto ensure their accurate transmission time. We implement and evaluate KeepON by\nmodifying the network driver on a Raspberry Pi using its standard NIC. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that KeepON can achieve x162 times scheduling accuracy\ncomparable to its default driver, and x2.6 times compared to hardware-based\nsolution, thus enabling precise timing control on standard commodity hardware.",

    "abstract": "Federated learning has significantly advanced distributed training of machine\nlearning models across decentralized data sources. However, existing frameworks\noften lack comprehensive solutions that combine uncertainty quantification,\ninterpretability, and robustness. To address this, we propose FedNAM+, a\nfederated learning framework that integrates Neural Additive Models (NAMs) with\na novel conformal prediction method to enable interpretable and reliable\nuncertainty estimation. Our method introduces a dynamic level adjustment\ntechnique that utilizes gradient-based sensitivity maps to identify key input\nfeatures influencing predictions. This facilitates both interpretability and\npixel-wise uncertainty estimates. Unlike traditional interpretability methods\nsuch as LIME and SHAP, which do not provide confidence intervals, FedNAM+\noffers visual insights into prediction reliability. We validate our approach\nthrough experiments on CT scan, MNIST, and CIFAR datasets, demonstrating high\nprediction accuracy with minimal loss (e.g., only 0.1% on MNIST), along with\ntransparent uncertainty measures. Visual analysis highlights variable\nuncertainty intervals, revealing low-confidence regions where model performance\ncan be improved with additional data. Compared to Monte Carlo Dropout, FedNAM+\ndelivers efficient and global uncertainty estimates with reduced computational\noverhead, making it particularly suitable for federated learning scenarios.\nOverall, FedNAM+ provides a robust, interpretable, and computationally\nefficient framework that enhances trust and transparency in decentralized\npredictive modeling.",

    "abstract": "Despite their impressive capabilities, aligned large language models (LLMs)\noften generate outputs that lack diversity. What drives this stability in the\ngeneration? We investigate this phenomenon through the lens of probability\nconcentration in the model's output distribution. To quantify this\nconcentration, we introduce the Branching Factor (BF) -- a token-invariant\nmeasure of the effective number of plausible next steps during generation. Our\nempirical analysis reveals two key findings: (1) BF often decreases as\ngeneration progresses, suggesting that LLMs become more predictable as they\ngenerate. (2) alignment tuning substantially sharpens the model's output\ndistribution from the outset, reducing BF by nearly an order of magnitude\n(e.g., from 12 to 1.2) relative to base models. This stark reduction helps\nexplain why aligned models often appear less sensitive to decoding strategies.\nBuilding on this insight, we find this stability has surprising implications\nfor complex reasoning. Aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT) models (e.g.,\nDeepSeek-distilled models), for instance, leverage this effect; by generating\nlonger reasoning chains, they push generation into later, more deterministic\n(lower BF) stages, resulting in more stable outputs. We hypothesize that\nalignment tuning does not fundamentally change a model's behavior, but instead\nsteers it toward stylistic tokens (e.g., \"Sure\") that unlock low-entropy\ntrajectories already present in the base model. This view is supported by\nnudging experiments, which show that prompting base models with such tokens can\nsimilarly reduce BF. Together, our findings establish BF as a powerful\ndiagnostic for understanding and controlling LLM outputs - clarifying how\nalignment reduces variability, how CoT promotes stable generations, and how\nbase models can be steered away from diversity.",

However, existing dynamic/mixed precision\nquantization requires retraining or special hardware, whereas post-training\nquantization (PTQ) has two limitations for resource adaptation: (i) The\nstate-of-the-art PTQ methods only provide one fixed bitwidth model, which makes\nit challenging to adapt to the dynamic resources of IoT devices; (ii) Deploying\nmultiple PTQ models with diverse bitwidths consumes large storage resources and\nswitching overheads. To this end, this paper introduces a resource-friendly\npost-training integer-nesting quantization, i.e., NestQuant, for on-device\nquantized model switching on IoT devices. The proposed NestQuant incorporates\nthe integer weight decomposition, which bit-wise splits quantized weights into\nhigher-bit and lower-bit weights of integer data types. It also contains a\ndecomposed weights nesting mechanism to optimize the higher-bit weights by\nadaptive rounding and nest them into the original quantized weights. In\ndeployment, we can send and store only one NestQuant model and switch between\nthe full-bit/part-bit model by paging in/out lower-bit weights to adapt to\nresource changes and reduce consumption. Experimental results on the\nImageNet-1K pretrained DNNs demonstrated that the NestQuant model can achieve\nhigh performance in top-1 accuracy, and reduce in terms of data transmission,\nstorage consumption, and switching overheads. In particular, the ResNet-101\nwith INT8 nesting INT6 can achieve 78.1% and 77.9% accuracy for full-bit and\npart-bit models, respectively, and reduce switching overheads by approximately\n78.1% compared with diverse bitwidths PTQ models.",

Our framework\ncomprises two key components. First, we introduced a cross-modal\n2D-selective-scan (CM-SS2D) module to establish SSM between RGB and thermal\nmodalities, which constructs cross-modal visual sequences and derives hidden\nstate representations of one modality from the other. Second, we developed a\ncross-modal state space association (CM-SSA) module that effectively integrates\nglobal associations from CM-SS2D with local spatial features extracted through\nconvolutional operations. In contrast with Transformer-based approaches, CM-SSM\nachieves linear computational complexity with respect to image resolution.\nExperimental results show that CM-SSM achieves state-of-the-art performance on\nthe CART dataset with fewer parameters and lower computational cost.

During SME, the general capabilities of LLMs can be\nnegatively affected due to the introduction of new parameters. In this paper,\nwe propose a queue-based self-correction framework (QueueEDIT) that not only\nenhances SME performance by addressing long-sequence dependency but also\nmitigates the impact of parameter bias on the general capabilities of LLMs.\nSpecifically, we first introduce a structural mapping editing loss to map the\ntriplets to the knowledge-sensitive neurons within the Transformer layers of\nLLMs. We then store the located parameters for each piece of edited knowledge\nin a queue and dynamically align previously edited parameters. In each edit, we\nselect queue parameters most relevant to the currently located parameters to\ndetermine whether previous knowledge needs realignment. Irrelevant parameters\nin the queue are frozen, and we update the parameters at the queue head to the\nLLM to ensure they do not harm general abilities. Experiments show that our\nframework significantly outperforms strong baselines across various SME\nsettings and maintains competitiveness in single-turn editing. The resulting\nLLMs also preserve high capabilities in general NLP tasks throughout the SME\nprocess.",

    "abstract": "We describe the discovery and characterization of TOI-7149~b, a 0.705 $\\pm$\n0.075 $M_J$, 1.18 $\\pm$ 0.045 $R_J$ gas giant on a $\\sim 2.65$ day period orbit\ntransiting an M4V star with a mass of 0.344 $\\pm$ 0.030~\\solmass{} and an\neffective temperature of 3363 $\\pm$ 59 K. The planet was first discovered using\nNASA's TESS mission, which we confirmed using a combination of ground-based\nphotometry, radial velocities, and speckle imaging. The planet has one of the\ndeepest transits of all known main-sequence planet hosts at $\\sim$ 12\\%\n($R_p/R_\\star\\sim 0.33$). Pushing the bounds of previous discoveries of\n\\underline{G}iant \\underline{E}xoplanets around \\underline{M}-dwarf\n\\underline{S}tars (GEMS), TOI-7149 is one of the lowest mass M-dwarfs to host a\ntransiting giant planet. We compare the sample of transiting GEMS to stars\nwithin 200 pc with a Gaia colour magnitude diagram (CMD) and find that the GEMS\nhosts are likely to be high metallicity stars. We also analyze the sample of\ntransiting giant planets using the non-parametric \\texttt{MRExo} framework to\ncompare the bulk density of warm Jupiters across stellar masses. We confirm our\nprevious result that transiting Jupiters around early M-dwarfs have similar\nmasses and densities to warm Jupiters around FGK stars, and extend this to mid\nM-dwarfs, thereby suggesting a potential commonality in their formation\nmechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how materials wear off following frictional sliding is a\nlong-standing question in tribology. In this respect, the particular case of\nthe wear of soft rubbery elastomeric materials stands apart: tire wear produces\nseveral million tonnes of abraded materials per year, bearing immense\nindustrial and environmental impact, while the soft nature of elastomers and\ntheir inability to accommodate plastic deformation before failure renders their\nwear mechanisms almost intractable. Here, we harness mechanochemical approaches\non model elastomeric materials, to reveal that mild elastomeric wear does not\nproceed from crack propagation processes, but rather from the continuous\naccumulation of diffuse damage by chain scission, extending well below the\nsurface of the material. Damage accumulates in a discontinuous manner through\nmicro-slippage events at the rough contacting asperities, with in-depth damage\nextension set by the characteristic asperity size. Surprisingly, damage grows\nthrough a slow logarithmic-like process over successive cycles, which we\ninterpret as the occurrence of stress-activated scission events in a broad\nstrand elastic energy landscape. These observations point to the probabilistic\nnature of this fatigue-like damage accumulation mechanism and allow us to\nformulate the wear rate as an integral of the damage cumulated over successive\nasperity sliding. Finally, by tuning the molecular architecture of our\nmaterials, we evidence an antagonistic relation between fracture resistance and\nwear resilience, set by the sensitivity of the material to stress fluctuations.\nRevealing the role of previously invisible subsurface damage in elastomeric\nwear, our approach should stimulate further physical-based approaches allowing\nfor the development of sustainable and wear-resilient materials.",
