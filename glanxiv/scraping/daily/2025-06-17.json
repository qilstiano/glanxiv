    "abstract": "The rapid advancements in autonomous vehicle (AV) technology promise enhanced\nsafety and operational efficiency. However, frequent lane changes and merging\nmaneuvers continue to pose significant safety risks and disrupt traffic flow.\nThis paper introduces the Minimizing Lane Change Algorithm (MLCA), a\nstate-machine-based approach designed to reduce unnecessary lane changes,\nthereby enhancing both traffic safety and efficiency. The MLCA algorithm\nprioritizes maintaining lane stability unless safety-critical conditions\nnecessitate a lane change. The algorithm's effectiveness was evaluated through\nsimulations conducted on the SUMO platform, comparing its performance against\nestablished models, including LC2017 and MOBIL. Results demonstrate substantial\nreductions in lane changes and collisions, leading to smoother traffic flow and\nimproved safety metrics. Additionally, the study highlights the MLCA's\nadaptability to various traffic densities and roadway configurations,\nshowcasing its potential for wide-scale deployment in real-world AV systems.\nFuture work aims to validate these findings in more complex scenarios using the\nCARLA simulator, which will enable the testing of the algorithm under more\ndynamic and high-fidelity conditions, such as urban traffic environments with\ndiverse road users. Moreover, the integration of cybersecurity measures for\nvehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication will be explored to ensure robust and\nsecure data exchange, further enhancing the reliability and safety of AV\noperations. This research contributes to the broader goal of developing\nintelligent traffic systems that optimize both individual vehicle performance\nand overall traffic network efficiency.",

    ],
    "abstract": "Pretraining large language models is a costly process. To make this process\nmore efficient, several methods have been proposed to optimize model\narchitecture/parametrization and hardware use. On the parametrization side,\n$\\mu P$ (Maximal Update Parametrization) parametrizes model weights and\nlearning rate (LR) in a way that makes hyperparameters (HPs) transferable with\nwidth (embedding dimension): HPs can be tuned for a small model and used for\nlarger models without additional tuning. While $\\mu$P showed impressive results\nin practice, recent empirical studies have reported conflicting observations\nwhen applied to LLMs. One limitation of the theory behind $\\mu$P is the fact\nthat input dimension (vocabulary size in LLMs) is considered fixed when taking\nthe width to infinity. This is unrealistic since vocabulary size is generally\nmuch larger than width in practice. In this work, we provide a theoretical\nanalysis of the effect of vocabulary size on training dynamics, and\nsubsequently show that as vocabulary size increases, the training dynamics\n\\emph{interpolate between the $\\mu$P regime and another regime that we call\nLarge Vocab (LV) Regime}, where optimal scaling rules are different from those\npredicted by $\\mu$P. Our analysis reveals that in the LV regime, the optimal\nembedding LR to hidden LR ratio should roughly scale as $\\Theta(\\sqrt{width})$,\nsurprisingly close to the empirical findings previously reported in the\nliterature, and different from the $\\Theta(width)$ ratio predicted by $\\mu$P.\nWe conduct several experiments to validate our theory, and pretrain a 1B model\nfrom scratch to show the benefit of our suggested scaling rule for the\nembedding LR.",

A key challenge lies in the spatial\nsparsity of hourly mobility counts across hexagonal grid cells, which limits\nthe predictive power of conventional time series models. To address this, we\npropose a lightweight and model-agnostic Spatial Neighbourhood Fusion (SPN)\ntechnique that augments each cell's features with aggregated signals from its\nimmediate H3 neighbors.

Our analysis considered linear, quadratic, and apsidal\nmotion models, with the quadratic model proving to be significantly superior in\nall model comparison statistics. We found no significant periodic signals in\nthe data. The quadratic model allows us to infer a tidal quality factor of Q' ~\n80,000 from the orbital decay rate if this is due to stellar tides. Theoretical\nconsiderations indicate that such efficient dissipation is possible due to\ninternal gravity waves in the radiative core of WASP-4, but only in our models\nwith a more evolved host star, possibly near the end of its main-sequence\nlifetime, and with a larger radius than the observed one. Our main-sequence\nmodels produce only about a third of the required dissipation (Q' ~ 200,000 -\n500,000). Therefore, the observed orbital decay can only be explained by a\nslightly larger or more evolved host, resembling the case for WASP-12.

This overlooks the fact that only a subset of tokens often contains\ncritical, task-specific information. To address this limitation, we introduce\nSupervised Fine-Tuning with Group Optimization (SFT-GO), a novel approach that\ntreats groups of tokens differently based on their importance.SFT-GO groups\ntokens in each sample based on their importance values and optimizes the LLM\nusing a weighted combination of the worst-group loss and the standard\ncross-entropy loss. This mechanism adaptively emphasizes the most challenging\ntoken groups and guides the model to better handle different group\ndistributions, thereby improving overall learning dynamics. We provide a\ntheoretical analysis of SFT-GO's convergence rate, demonstrating its\nefficiency. Empirically, we apply SFT-GO with three different token grouping\nstrategies and show that models trained with SFT-GO consistently outperform\nbaseline approaches across popular LLM benchmarks.

While previous works have explored representation learning for\nthis task, the critical challenge of training instability in sequential\nrepresentations and its detrimental impact on policy performance has been\noverlooked. This work demonstrates that Controlled Differential Equations (CDE)\nstate representation can achieve strong RL policies when two key factors are\nmet: (1) ensuring training stability through early stopping or stabilization\nmethods, and (2) enforcing acuity-aware representations by correlation\nregularization with clinical scores (SOFA, SAPS-II, OASIS). Experiments on the\nMIMIC-III sepsis cohort reveal that stable CDE autoencoder produces\nrepresentations strongly correlated with acuity scores and enables RL policies\nwith superior performance (WIS return $> 0.9$). In contrast, unstable CDE\nrepresentation leads to degraded representations and policy failure (WIS return\n$\\sim$ 0). Visualizations of the latent space show that stable CDEs not only\nseparate survivor and non-survivor trajectories but also reveal clear acuity\nscore gradients, whereas unstable training fails to capture either pattern.\nThese findings highlight practical guidelines for using CDEs to encode\nirregular medical time series in clinical RL, emphasizing the need for training\nstability in sequential representation learning.",

    "abstract": "Integrated nonlinear photonic technologies, even with state-of-the-art\nfabrication with only a few nanometer geometry variations, face significant\nchallenges in achieving wafer-scale yield of functional devices. A core\nlimitation lies in the fundamental constraints of energy and momentum\nconservation laws. Imposed by these laws, nonlinear processes are subject to\nstringent frequency and phase matching (FPM) conditions that cannot be\nsatisfied across a full wafer without requiring a combination of precise device\ndesign and active tuning. Motivated by recent theoretical and experimental\nadvances in integrated multi-timescale nonlinear systems, we revisit this\nlong-standing limitation and introduce a fundamentally relaxed and passive\nframework: nested frequency-phase matching. As a prototypical implementation,\nwe investigate on-chip multi-harmonic generation in a two-timescale lattice of\ncommercially available silicon nitride (SiN) coupled ring resonators, which we\ndirectly compare with conventional single-timescale counterparts. We observe\ndistinct and striking spatial and spectral signatures of nesting-enabled\nrelaxation of FPM. Specifically, for the first time, we observe simultaneous\nfundamental, second, third, and fourth harmonic generation, remarkable 100\npercent multi-functional device yield across the wafer, and ultra-broad\nharmonic bandwidths. Crucially, these advances are achieved without constrained\ngeometries or active tuning, establishing a scalable foundation for nonlinear\noptics with broad implications for integrated frequency conversion and\nsynchronization, self-referencing, metrology, squeezed light, and nonlinear\noptical computing.",

While various\nexperimental approaches have been proposed to probe quantum systems in curved\nspacetime, most focus on the Newtonian regime, leaving post-Newtonian effects\nsuch as frame dragging largely unexplored. In this study, we propose and\ntheoretically analyze an experimental scheme to investigate how post-Newtonian\ngravity affects quantum systems. We consider two setups: (i) a quantum clock\ninterferometry setup designed to detect the gravitational field of a rotating\nmass, and (ii) a scheme exploring whether such effects could be used to\ngenerate gravity induced entanglement. Due to the symmetry of the\nconfiguration, the proposed setup is insensitive to Newtonian gravitational\ncontributions but remains sensitive to the frame-dragging effect. Assuming the\nvalidity of the quantum equivalence principle, this approach provides insights\nnot only into the quantum nature of gravity but also into whether spacetime\nitself exhibits quantum properties. While the predicted effects appear too\nsmall to detect with current technology, our scheme offers a starting point for\nfuture experiments probing post-Newtonian quantum gravitational effects.",

    "abstract": "A key challenge in reward learning from human input is that desired agent\nbehavior often changes based on context. Traditional methods typically treat\neach new context as a separate task with its own reward function. For example,\nif a previously ignored stove becomes too hot to be around, the robot must\nlearn a new reward from scratch, even though the underlying preference for\nprioritizing safety over efficiency remains unchanged. We observe that context\ninfluences not the underlying preference itself, but rather the\n$\\textit{saliency}$--or importance--of reward features. For instance, stove\nheat affects the importance of the robot's proximity, yet the human's safety\npreference stays the same. Existing multi-task and meta IRL methods learn\ncontext-dependent representations $\\textit{implicitly}$--without distinguishing\nbetween preferences and feature importance--resulting in substantial data\nrequirements. Instead, we propose $\\textit{explicitly}$ modeling\ncontext-invariant preferences separately from context-dependent feature\nsaliency, creating modular reward representations that adapt to new contexts.\nTo achieve this, we introduce $\\textit{calibrated features}$--representations\nthat capture contextual effects on feature saliency--and present specialized\npaired comparison queries that isolate saliency from preference for efficient\nlearning. Experiments with simulated users show our method significantly\nimproves sample efficiency, requiring 10x fewer preference queries than\nbaselines to achieve equivalent reward accuracy, with up to 15% better\nperformance in low-data regimes (5-10 queries). An in-person user study (N=12)\ndemonstrates that participants can effectively teach their unique personal\ncontextual preferences using our method, enabling more adaptable and\npersonalized reward learning.",

    "abstract": "Text on historical maps contains valuable information providing georeferenced\nhistorical, political, and cultural contexts. However, text extraction from\nhistorical maps is challenging due to the lack of (1) effective methods and (2)\ntraining data. Previous approaches use ad-hoc steps tailored to only specific\nmap styles. Recent machine learning-based text spotters (e.g., for scene\nimages) have the potential to solve these challenges because of their\nflexibility in supporting various types of text instances. However, these\nmethods remain challenges in extracting precise image features for predicting\nevery sub-component (boundary points and characters) in a text instance. This\nis critical because map text can be lengthy and highly rotated with complex\nbackgrounds, posing difficulties in detecting relevant image features from a\nrough text region. This paper proposes PALETTE, an end-to-end text spotter for\nscanned historical maps of a wide variety. PALETTE introduces a novel\nhyper-local sampling module to explicitly learn localized image features around\nthe target boundary points and characters of a text instance for detection and\nrecognition. PALETTE also enables hyper-local positional embeddings to learn\nspatial interactions between boundary points and characters within and across\ntext instances. In addition, this paper presents a novel approach to\nautomatically generate synthetic map images, SynthMap+, for training text\nspotters for historical maps. The experiment shows that PALETTE with SynthMap+\noutperforms SOTA text spotters on two new benchmark datasets of historical\nmaps, particularly for long and angled text. We have deployed PALETTE with\nSynthMap+ to process over 60,000 maps in the David Rumsey Historical Map\ncollection and generated over 100 million text labels to support map searching.\nThe project is released at\nhttps://github.com/kartta-foundation/mapkurator-palette-doc.",

This model is\nstudied in a scenario assuming no dark energy, with the aim of determining\nwhether it can reproduce the universe's acceleration on its own, without the\naddition of a dark energy fluid. Bayesian statistical analysis is performed in\norder to constrain the free parameters of each scenario using SLS, SNIa, OHD,\nand BAO data samples, the last two considering newly added data points. Both\nPlanck and Riess priors for h are used and compared. In both cases, we are able\nto reproduce the late-time accelerated expansion in agreement with\nobservational data. Interesting consistencies at the transition redshift zt\nwith LCDM are found, suggesting that this might be a suitable model for\nstudying the evolution of the universe up to the present date. However, some\npathologies are detected in this model, namely a \"Big Rip\" divergence of H(z)\nat z = 1, as well as a strong dependence between the functional form of the\nbrane tension and the future evolution of the universe.",

When prompted with this embedding, the model\nreconstructs the fixed sequence exactly.

While prior research has introduced various\ndeep learning models for this purpose, many struggle to balance noise\nsuppression, perceptual quality, and speaker-specific feature preservation,\nleaving a critical research gap in their comparative performance evaluation.\nThis study benchmarks three state-of-the-art models Wave-U-Net, CMGAN, and\nU-Net, on diverse datasets such as SpEAR, VPQAD, and Clarkson datasets. These\nmodels were chosen due to their relevance in the literature and code\naccessibility. The evaluation reveals that U-Net achieves high noise\nsuppression with SNR improvements of +71.96% on SpEAR, +64.83% on VPQAD, and\n+364.2% on the Clarkson dataset. CMGAN outperforms in perceptual quality,\nattaining the highest PESQ scores of 4.04 on SpEAR and 1.46 on VPQAD, making it\nwell-suited for applications prioritizing natural and intelligible speech.\nWave-U-Net balances these attributes with improvements in speaker-specific\nfeature retention, evidenced by VeriSpeak score gains of +10.84% on SpEAR and\n+27.38% on VPQAD.

High-resolution soil\nmaps are essential for characterizing permafrost distribution, identifying\nvulnerable areas, and informing adaptation strategies. We present MISO, a\nvision-based machine learning (ML) model to produce statewide fine-scale soil\nmaps for near-surface permafrost and soil taxonomy.

Spatial cross-validation and regional analysis across Permafrost\nZones and Major Land Resource Areas (MLRAs) show that MISO generalizes better\nto remote, unseen locations and achieves higher recall than RF, which is\ncritical for monitoring permafrost thaw and related environmental processes.\nThese findings demonstrate the potential of advanced ML approaches for\nfine-scale soil mapping and provide practical guidance for future soil sampling\nand infrastructure planning in permafrost-affected landscapes.

Rare types of CCSNe characterized by\nsubstantial magnetic fields and rotation, known as magnetorotational supernovae\n(MR-SNe), are theoretically predicted to produce these elements, although\ndirect observational evidence is lacking. We suggest that this critical\nquestion be addressed through the study of some of the eleven CCSN remnants\nlocated within 10 kpc, as well as through the detection of gamma-ray emission\nfrom a future Galactic supernova. We use a two-dimensional MR-SN model to\nestimate the expected gamma flux stemming from nuclear decays in the range of a\nfew tens of keV to a few MeV. Our results indicate that an observation of\nSn-126 (Sb-126) in a remnant stands out as a signature of an\nr-process-producing supernova. Since the neutron-rich conditions that lead to\nthe production of the r-process could also enhance the production of Fe-60, the\ndetection of substantial Fe-60 (Co-60) would be indicative of favorable\nconditions for the r-process. In the case of a future supernova explosion, when\nthe evolution of the spectrum is studied over ten days to a few years, a rich\npicture emerges. At various epochs, second peak r-process isotopes such as\nSb-125, I-131, Te-132, I-132 and La-140 produce gamma-ray signals that emerge\nabove the background from explosive burning products and electron-positron\nannihilation. The weak r-process isotopes Nb-95, Ru-103, Rh-106 also have\nperiods of prominence. While MR-SNe are predicted to have a relatively small\nmain r-process contribution, third peak isotopes like Ir-194 could still be\nabove next-generation MeV gamma instrument sensitivities.",

    "abstract": "Minimal surfaces and Einstein manifolds are among the most natural structures\nin differential geometry. Whilst minimal surfaces are well understood, Einstein\nmanifolds remain far less so. This exposition synthesises together a set of\nparallels between minimal surfaces embedded in an ambient three-manifold, and\nEinstein four-manifolds. These parallels include variational formulations,\ntopological constraints, monotonicity formulae, compactness and\nepsilon-regularity theorems, and decompositions such as thick/thin and\nsheeted/non-sheeted structures. Though distinct in nature, the striking\nanalogies between them raises a profound question: might there exist\ncircumstances in which these objects are, in essence, manifestations of the\nsame underlying geometry? Drawing on foundational results such as Jensen's\ntheorem, Takahashi's theorem, and a conjecture of Song, this work suggests a\nbridge between the two structures. In particular, it shows that certain\nEinstein four-manifolds admit a minimal immersion into a higher-dimensional\nsphere. A key example of this is the embedding of $\\mathbb{CP}^{2}$ into\n$S^{7}$ via the Veronese map, where it arises as a minimal submanifold.",

A key challenge lies in the lack of reliable, scalable RL\nreward signals across diverse reasoning domains. We introduce Guru, a curated\nRL reasoning corpus of 92K verifiable examples spanning six reasoning\ndomains--Math, Code, Science, Logic, Simulation, and Tabular--each built\nthrough domain-specific reward design, deduplication, and filtering to ensure\nreliability and effectiveness for RL training. Based on Guru, we systematically\nrevisit established findings in RL for LLM reasoning and observe significant\nvariation across domains. For example, while prior work suggests that RL\nprimarily elicits existing knowledge from pretrained models, our results reveal\na more nuanced pattern: domains frequently seen during pretraining (Math, Code,\nScience) easily benefit from cross-domain RL training, while domains with\nlimited pretraining exposure (Logic, Simulation, and Tabular) require in-domain\ntraining to achieve meaningful performance gains, suggesting that RL is likely\nto facilitate genuine skill acquisition.

To\ndo so, we have created gridded convective mass flux datasets from five global\nstorm-resolving models (GSRMs). We have three principal findings. First, in\nhumid environments, mass flux increases with height from the surface through\nthe depth of the lower free troposphere, forming a ``deep-inflow\". In dry\nenvironments, mass flux decreases with height through the lower free\ntroposphere. Second, mid-tropospheric mass flux increases nonlinearly with\nincreasing lower tropospheric humidity, resembling a widely reported pickup in\ntropical precipitation. Third, increased lower tropospheric humidity is\nassociated with reduced deep convective updraft buoyancy. To interpret these\nfindings, we employ a simple three-equation parcel model with stochastic\nentrainment. The parcel model suggests that the response of convective mass\nflux to lower tropospheric humidity is governed by two mechanisms: (1)\nsurvival, in which a greater share of entraining parcels ascend rather than\ndetrain with greater humidity; and (2) dilution, in which the average\nentrainment rate among surviving parcels increases with environmental humidity.\nTogether, these two mechanisms account for the three mass flux responses to\nhumidity.",

Combining exact\ndiagonalization with semiclassical Langevin dynamics, we establish a direct\nconnection between classical trajectories characterized by fixed-point\nattractors, limit cycles, or chaos and the spectral and structural properties\nof the quantum steady state. We show that classical dynamical behavior, as\nquantified by the sign of the Lyapunov exponent, governs the level statistics\nof the steady-state density matrix: non-positive exponents associated with\nregular dynamics yield Poissonian statistics, while positive exponents arising\nfrom chaotic dynamics lead to Wigner-Dyson statistics. Strong symmetries\nconstrain the system to lower-dimensional manifolds, suppressing chaos and\nenforcing localization, while weak symmetries preserve the global structure of\nthe phase space and allow chaotic behavior to persist. To characterize\nphase-space localization, we introduce the phase-space inverse participation\nratio IPR, which defines an effective dimension D of the Husimi distribution's\nsupport. We find that the entropy scales as $S \\propto \\ln N^D$, consistently\ncapturing the classical nature of the underlying dynamics. This semiclassical\nframework, based on stochastic mixtures of coherent states, successfully\nreproduces not only observable averages but also finer features such as\nspectral correlations and localization properties. Our results demonstrate that\ndissipative quantum chaos is imprinted in the steady-state density matrix, much\nlike in closed systems, and that the interplay between dynamical regimes and\nsymmetry constraints can be systematically probed using spectral and\nphase-space diagnostics.

Speculative decoding leverages idle GPU compute by using\na lightweight drafter to propose K tokens, which the LLM verifies in parallel,\nboosting token throughput. In conventional dense LLMs, all model weights are\nfetched each iteration, so speculation adds no latency overhead. Emerging\nMixture of Experts (MoE) models activate only a subset of weights per token,\ngreatly reducing data movement. However, we show that speculation is\nineffective for MoEs: draft tokens collectively activate more weights,\nincreasing data movement and verification time by 2-3x. When token throughput\ngains fail to offset this overhead, speculation causes slowdowns up to 1.5x,\nmaking it infeasible. Even when useful, the optimal K varies by task, model,\nand even between requests and iterations. Thus, despite widespread use in dense\nLLMs, speculation remains impractical in leading MoEs.\n  We present Cascade, a utility-driven framework that selectively enables\nspeculation to avoid slowdowns and dynamically tunes K to accelerate MoE\nserving. Cascade uses a lightweight metric, speculation utility, the ratio of\ntoken gains to verification cost, which shows iteration-level locality,\nenabling periodic decisions via short test and longer set phases. For each\nrequest, Cascade disables speculation if utility drops below one during\ntesting, and when utility exceeds one, tests multiple K-values to choose the\nutility-maximizing K for the set phase. We implement Cascade in vLLM and\nevaluate it on five popular MoEs with workloads spanning code, math,\nextraction, and mixed tasks. Cascade limits slowdown to 5% (vs. 1.5x) and\nimproves throughput by 7-14% over static K, making speculative decoding\npractical for MoEs.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in domains requiring\nmoral understanding, yet their reasoning often remains shallow, and misaligned\nwith human reasoning. Unlike humans, whose moral reasoning integrates\ncontextual trade-offs, value systems, and ethical theories, LLMs often rely on\nsurface patterns, leading to biased decisions in morally and ethically complex\nscenarios. To address this gap, we present a value-grounded framework for\nevaluating and distilling structured moral reasoning in LLMs. We benchmark 12\nopen-source models across four moral datasets using a taxonomy of prompts\ngrounded in value systems, ethical theories, and cognitive reasoning\nstrategies. Our evaluation is guided by four questions: (1) Does reasoning\nimprove LLM decision-making over direct prompting? (2) Which types of\nvalue/ethical frameworks most effectively guide LLM reasoning? (3) Which\ncognitive reasoning strategies lead to better moral performance? (4) Can\nsmall-sized LLMs acquire moral competence through distillation? We find that\nprompting with explicit moral structure consistently improves accuracy and\ncoherence, with first-principles reasoning and Schwartz's + care-ethics\nscaffolds yielding the strongest gains. Furthermore, our supervised\ndistillation approach transfers moral competence from large to small models\nwithout additional inference cost. Together, our results offer a scalable path\ntoward interpretable and value-grounded models.",

Continuous data collection through mobile devices generates highly\ncomplex data: entangled multivariate time series of outcomes, exposures, and\ncovariates. Missing data is a pervasive problem in biomedical and social\nscience research, and Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) data in psychiatric\nresearch is no exception. However, the complex data structure of multivariate\ntime series and their non-stationary nature make missing data a major challenge\nfor proper inference. Additional historical information included in time series\nanalyses exacerbates the issue of missing data and also introduces problems for\nconfounding adjustment. The majority of existing imputation methods are either\ndesigned for stationary time series or for longitudinal data with limited\nfollow-up periods. The limited work on non-stationary time series either\nfocuses on missing exogenous information or ignores the complex temporal\ndependence among outcomes, exposures, and covariates.

We demonstrate the method's advantages over other widely used missing\ndata imputation strategies through simulations of both stationary and\nnon-stationary time series, subject to various missing mechanisms.

First, we observe that a KZG\ncommitment to polynomial evaluations implicitly (and without modification) also\nbinds to the Reed--Solomon (RS) codeword of its coefficients, enabling sound\nand efficient randomized verification. Second, while heavyweight encryption\nschemes such as exponential ElGamal enable compact proofs linking ciphertexts\nto the commitment, they are unnecessary for direct data recovery.\n  Exploiting these insights, we apply a lightweight hash-derived mask to the\nentire RS-extended codeword, and perform ElGamal encryption only on a\npseudorandom \\Theta(lambda) subset of symbols, where lambda is the security\nparameter (e.g., 128). Data recovery occurs by simply removing the lightweight\nmasks, with ElGamal ciphertexts serving exclusively for verification proofs. A\nheavyweight (but constant-time) zk-SNARK ensures consistency between these two\nencryption layers at sampled positions, sharply reducing bandwidth overhead and\ncomputational cost.\n  In addition, we show how a constant-time (and precomputable) zk-SNARK linking\na BLS12-381 secret key to a secp256k1 hash pre-image resolves Bitcoin's\nelliptic-curve mismatch, enabling fully off-chain execution via the Lightning\nNetwork.

They also require human grounding in multi-modal environments,\nwhich can be ad-hoc, rigid, and brittle. Neural networks are good at extracting\nrich contextual information from multi-modal data, but lack interpretable\nstructures for reasoning.\n  Objectives: CALM aims to bridge the gap between logic and neural perception,\ncreating an analog logic that can reason over multi-modal inputs. Without this\nintegration, AI systems remain either brittle or unstructured, unable to\ngeneralize robustly to real-world tasks. In CALM, symbolic predicates evaluate\nto analog truth values computed by neural networks and constrained search.\n  Methods: CALM represents each predicate using a domain tree, which\niteratively refines its analog truth value when the contextual groundings of\nits entities are determined. The iterative refinement is predicted by neural\nnetworks capable of capturing multi-modal information and is filtered through a\nsymbolic reasoning module to ensure constraint satisfaction.\n  Results: In fill-in-the-blank object placement tasks, CALM achieved 92.2%\naccuracy, outperforming classical logic (86.3%) and LLM (59.4%) baselines. It\nalso demonstrated spatial heatmap generation aligned with logical constraints\nand delicate human preferences, as shown by a human study.\n  Conclusions: CALM demonstrates the potential to reason with logic structure\nwhile aligning with preferences in multi-modal environments.

Since DMMs are fundamentally classical\ndynamical systems, their ordinary differential equations (ODEs) can be\nefficiently simulated on modern computers. This provides a unique platform to\nstudy their performance under various conditions. An aspect that has received\nlittle attention so far is how their performance is affected by the numerical\nerrors in the solution of their ODEs and the physical noise they would be\nnaturally subject to if built in hardware. Here, we analyze these two aspects\nin detail by varying the integration time step (numerical noise) and adding\nstochastic perturbations (physical noise) into the equations of DMMs. We are\nparticularly interested in understanding how noise induces a chaotic transition\nthat marks the shift from successful problem-solving to failure in these\nsystems. Our study includes an analysis of power spectra and Lyapunov exponents\ndepending on the noise strength. The results reveal a correlation between the\ninstance solvability and the sign of the ensemble averaged mean largest\nLyapunov exponent. Interestingly, we find a regime in which DMMs with positive\nmean largest Lyapunov exponents still exhibit solvability. Furthermore, the\npower spectra provide additional information about our system by distinguishing\nbetween regular behavior (peaks) and chaotic behavior (broadband spectrum).\nTherefore, power spectra could be utilized to control whether a DMM operates in\nthe optimal dynamical regime. Overall, we find that the qualitative effects of\nnumerical and physical noise are mostly similar, despite their fundamentally\ndifferent origin.",

Moreover, the multi-document setting is historically\nchallenging for benchmark creation due to the expensive cost of annotating long\ninputs.

Our novel technique operates on condensed structured seed knowledge,\nmodifying it through LLM-assisted edits to induce MD-specific reasoning\nchallenges.

We\nanalyze the behavior of popular LLMs and prompting techniques, finding that\nMDBENCH poses significant challenges for all methods, even with relatively\nshort document sets.

However, relating MWD to\nrheology requires the inversion of rheological models, for which there is no\nanalytic solution. Prior approaches assume a functional form for the MWD (such\nas a lognormal or generalized exponential distribution), minimizing the error\nwith respect to the functional form's degrees of freedom. While this is a\npowerful and robust technique for determining general polymer properties, such\nas average MWD or polydispersity, it requires former knowledge of the shape of\nthe MWD. This work presents a generalized approach to solving the inverse\nproblem directly, with no former knowledge of the MWD or assumptions regarding\nits functional form. To close the inverse problem and establish uniqueness,\nLagrange multipliers constraints on the MWD are included. The method is applied\nwith reptation-based models to a variety of polycarbonate, polyethylene and\npolystyrene polymers. For samples whose rheology are well-described by\nreptation, the predicted MWD is shown to match experimental measurements very\nwell. For samples that are not well-described by reptation, the predicted MWD\nnaturally differs from experiment. Nevertheless, the results still offer\ninsight into how reptation-described polymers differ from their counterparts.\nThis establishes the proposed inverse method as a viable practical tool for\nrheology-based characterization.",

Results show that the GPLFM\nprovides accurate acceleration response estimates at most locations, even under\nsimplifying modeling assumptions such as linear time-invariant behavior during\nthe impact phase.

    "abstract": "NGC 253, the Sculptor galaxy, is the southern, massive, star-forming disk\ngalaxy closest to the Milky Way. In this work, we present a new 103-pointing\nMUSE mosaic of this galaxy covering the majority of its star-forming disk up to\n0.75xR25. With an area of ~20x5 arcmin2 (~20x5 kpc2, projected) and a physical\nresolution of ~15 pc, this mosaic constitutes one of the largest, highest\nphysical resolution integral field spectroscopy surveys of any star-forming\ngalaxy to date. Here, we exploit the mosaic to identify a sample of ~500\nplanetary nebulae (~20 times larger than in previous studies) to build the\nplanetary nebula luminosity function (PNLF) and obtain a new estimate of the\ndistance to NGC 253. The value obtained is 17% higher than estimates returned\nby other reliable measurements, mainly obtained via the top of the red giant\nbranch method (TRGB). The PNLF also varies between the centre (r < 4 kpc) and\nthe disk of the galaxy. The distance derived from the PNLF of the outer disk is\ncomparable to that of the full sample, while the PNLF of the centre returns a\ndistance ~0.9 Mpc larger. Our analysis suggests that extinction related to the\ndust-rich interstellar medium and edge-on view of the galaxy (the average\nE(B-V) across the disk is ~0.35 mag) plays a major role in explaining both the\nlarger distance recovered from the full PNLF and the difference between the\nPNLFs in the centre and in the disk.",

Existing MIA methods often rely on diffusion\nreconstruction errors, where member images are expected to have lower\nreconstruction errors than non-member images. However, applying these methods\ndirectly to medical images faces challenges. Reconstruction error is influenced\nby inherent image difficulty, and diffusion models struggle with high-frequency\ndetail reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose a\nFrequency-Calibrated Reconstruction Error (FCRE) method for MIAs on medical\nimage diffusion models. By focusing on reconstruction errors within a specific\nmid-frequency range and excluding both high-frequency (difficult to\nreconstruct) and low-frequency (less informative) regions, our\nfrequency-selective approach mitigates the confounding factor of inherent image\ndifficulty. Specifically, we analyze the reverse diffusion process, obtain the\nmid-frequency reconstruction error, and compute the structural similarity index\nscore between the reconstructed and original images. Membership is determined\nby comparing this score to a threshold. Experiments on several medical image\ndatasets demonstrate that our FCRE method outperforms existing MIA methods.",

While the gravity wave drag is\nlongitudinally uniform in the lower thermosphere, it is more localized in the\nupper thermosphere in all the simulations. Waves from uniformly distributed\nsources increase the longitudinal variability of zonal winds in the\nthermosphere up to $\\sim$150 km. Gravity wave effects exhibit different local\ntime variations in the lower thermosphere (100--140 km) than in the upper\nthermosphere. In the upper thermosphere, gravity wave effects are stronger\nduring the day than at night. In contrast, nighttime gravity wave effects are\nstronger than the daytime ones in the lower thermosphere. Finally, a comparison\nwith ICON-MIGHTI observations shows that the model reproduces the basic\nstructure of thermospheric winds, performing better with zonal winds than with\nmeridional winds.

Cosmological simulations indicate that most of the missing baryons\nreside in cosmic filaments in the form of warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM).\nThe latter shows low surface brightness and soft X-ray emission, making it\nchallenging to detect. Until now, X-ray WHIM emission has been detected only in\nvery few individual filaments, whereas in even fewer filaments, WHIM has been\nspectroscopically analyzed. In this work, we used four Suzaku pointings to\nstudy the WHIM emission of a filament in the Shapley supercluster, connecting\nthe galaxy cluster pairs A3530/32 and A3528-N/S. We additionally employ\nXMM-Newton observations to robustly account for point sources in the filament\nand to fully characterize the neighboring clusters and their signal\ncontamination to the filament region. We report the direct imaging and\nspectroscopic detection of extended thermal WHIM emission from this single\nfilament. Our imaging analysis confirms the existence of $(21\\pm 3)\\% $ excess\nX-ray emission throughout the filament compared to the sky background at a\n$6.1\\sigma$ level. We constrain the filament gas temperature, electron density,\nand baryon overdensity to be $k_{\\text{B}}T\\approx (0.8-1.1)$ keV,\n$n_{\\text{e}}\\approx 10^{-5}$ cm$^{-3}$, and $\\delta_{\\text{b}}\\approx\n(30-40)$, respectively, at a $>3\\sigma$ detection level, in agreement with\ncosmological simulations for the first time for a single filament. Independent\nof the X-ray analysis, we also identify a spectroscopic galaxy overdensity\nthroughout the filament using the Shapley Supercluster velocity Database and\nconstrain the filament's 3D length to be 7.2 Mpc. Overall, this is the first\nX-ray spectroscopic detection of pure WHIM emission from an individual,\npristine filament without significant contamination from unresolved point\nsources and gas clumps.",

    "abstract": "Meshfree methods, including the reproducing kernel particle method (RKPM),\nhave been widely used within the computational mechanics community to model\nphysical phenomena in materials undergoing large deformations or extreme\ntopology changes. RKPM shape functions and their derivatives cannot be\naccurately integrated with the Gauss-quadrature methods widely employed for the\nfinite element method (FEM) and typically require sophisticated nodal\nintegration techniques, preventing them from easily being implemented in\nexisting FEM software. Interpolation-based methods have been developed to\naddress similar problems with isogeometric and immersed boundary methods,\nallowing these techniques to be implemented within open-source finite element\nsoftware. With interpolation-based methods, background basis functions are\nrepresented as linear combinations of Lagrange polynomial foreground basis\nfunctions defined upon a boundary-conforming foreground mesh. This work extends\nthe applications of interpolation-based methods to implement RKPM within\nopen-source finite element software. Interpolation-based RKPM is applied to\nseveral PDEs, and error convergence rates are equivalent to classic RKPM\nintegrated using high-order Gauss-quadrature schemes. The interpolation-based\nmethod is able to exploit the continuity of the RKPM basis to solve\nhigher-order PDEs, demonstrated through the biharmonic problem. The method is\nextended to multi-material problems through Heaviside enrichment schemes, using\nlocal foreground refinement to reduce geometric integration error and achieve\nhigh-order accuracy.

Our\nmotivation is the Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey, which asks federal\nemployees whether they are satisfied with their work organization.

    "abstract": "Inspired by the impressive reasoning capabilities demonstrated by\nreinforcement learning approaches like DeepSeek-R1, recent emerging research\nhas begun exploring the use of reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance\nvision-language models (VLMs) for multimodal reasoning tasks. However, most\nexisting multimodal reinforcement learning approaches remain limited to spatial\nreasoning within single-image contexts, yet still struggle to generalize to\nmore complex and real-world scenarios involving multi-image positional\nreasoning, where understanding the relationships across images is crucial. To\naddress this challenge, we propose a general reinforcement learning approach\nPeRL tailored for interleaved multimodal tasks, and a multi-stage strategy\ndesigned to enhance the exploration-exploitation trade-off, thereby improving\nlearning efficiency and task performance. Specifically, we introduce\npermutation of image sequences to simulate varied positional relationships to\nexplore more spatial and positional diversity. Furthermore, we design a rollout\nfiltering mechanism for resampling to focus on trajectories that contribute\nmost to learning optimal behaviors to exploit learned policies effectively. We\nevaluate our model on 5 widely-used multi-image benchmarks and 3 single-image\nbenchmarks. Our experiments confirm that PeRL trained model consistently\nsurpasses R1-related and interleaved VLM baselines by a large margin, achieving\nstate-of-the-art performance on multi-image benchmarks, while preserving\ncomparable performance on single-image tasks.",

In this\nwork, D. Bernoulli applies mechanical reasoning to fluids flowing through\nchannels of arbitrary shape, deriving relationships between velocity,\ncross-sectional area, and efflux under ideal conditions. He anticipates core\nresults of Hydrodynamica, including the inverse relationship between flow\nvelocity and cross-sectional area, and emphasizes the role of energy balance in\nanalyzing steady flow. The text also includes reflections on experimental\nlimitations, the influence of friction, and the boundaries of theoretical\napplicability.

    "abstract": "Many recent approaches to structured NLP tasks use an autoregressive language\nmodel $M$ to map unstructured input text $x$ to output text $y$ representing\nstructured objects (such as tuples, lists, trees, code, etc.), where the\ndesired output structure is enforced via constrained decoding. During training,\nthese approaches do not require the model to be aware of the constraints, which\nare merely implicit in the training outputs $y$. This is advantageous as it\nallows for dynamic constraints without requiring retraining, but can lead to\nlow-quality output during constrained decoding at test time. We overcome this\nproblem with Boosted Constrained Decoding (BoostCD), which combines constrained\nand unconstrained decoding in two phases: Phase 1 decodes from the base model\n$M$ twice, in constrained and unconstrained mode, obtaining two weak\npredictions. In phase 2, a learned autoregressive boosted model combines the\ntwo weak predictions into one final prediction. The mistakes made by the base\nmodel with vs. without constraints tend to be complementary, which the boosted\nmodel learns to exploit for improved performance. We demonstrate the power of\nBoostCD by applying it to closed information extraction. Our model, BoostIE,\noutperforms prior approaches both in and out of distribution, addressing\nseveral common errors identified in those approaches.",

We argue that a class of Celestial CFT$_d$\ncan be engineered via AdS$_{d+1}$-CFT$_d$ correspondence. Our argument is based\non the observation that if we zoom in near the boundary of (Euclidean)\nAdS$_{d+1}$ then the conformal isometry group of EAdS$_{d+1}$, which is\nSO$(d+2,1)$, contracts to the Poincare group ISO$(d+1,1)$. This suggests that\nthe near boundary scaling limit of a theory of \\textit{conformal} gravity on\nEAdS$_{d+1}$ should be dual to a boundary CFT$_d$ with ISO$(d+1,1)$ symmetry.\nThis dual CFT$_d$, since the symmetries match, is an example of a Celestial\nCFT$_d$. Similarly, if we have a \\textit{non-conformal} theory of gravity on\nEAdS$_{d+1}$ then the near boundary scaling limit of such a theory is dual to a\n(boundary) Celestial CFT$_d$ with \\textit{only} (SO$(d+1,1)$) Lorentz\ninvariance. Celestial CFTs with only Lorentz invariance have been recently\nstudied in the literature. Now following this logic we discuss, among other\nthings, the near boundary scaling limit of the bosonic string theory on\nEuclidean AdS$_3$ in the presence of the NS-NS B field. The AdS$_3$ part of the\nworldsheet theory is free in this limit and has been studied in the literature\nin different contexts. This limit describes a ``long string'' which wraps the\n(Euclidean) AdS$_3$ boundary and it has been argued that the space-time CFT$_2$\nwhich describes the radial fluctuations of a long string is a Liouville CFT.\nAccording to our proposal, the dual CFT$_2$ which describes the \\textit{long\nstring sector} is an example of a \\textit{Celestial} CFT$_2$ with \\textit{only}\n(SO$(3,1)$)Lorentz invariance. We do not get a full ISO$(3,1)$ invariant\nCelestial CFT$_2$ in this way because the string theory does not have target\nspace conformal invariance.",

While the exact nature of these exotic orders is often\nchallenging to comprehend in static experiments, time-resolved techniques can\noffer critical insights by disentangling coupled degrees of freedom on the\ntime-axis. In this work, we demonstrate that the nature of charge orders in two\nrepresentative kagome metals - nonmagnetic ScV6Sn6 and magnetic FeGe - which\nhas been highly controversial in static studies, can be directly deciphered in\nthe time-domain through their fundamentally distinct order parameter dynamics\nmeasured via time-resolved X-ray scattering at an X-ray free electron laser. In\nnonmagnetic ScV6Sn6, the dynamics are characterized by ultrafast melting and\ncoherent amplitudon oscillations, typical of a phonon-coupled charge order. In\nstark contrast, magnetic FeGe exhibits resilient metastable charge order\ndynamics, hitherto unobserved in any other charge-ordered system - this unique\ntime-domain behavior directly signifies an unconventional magnetism-interlocked\ncharge order state realized in this kagome magnet. Our results not only provide\na model case where unconventional nature of electronic order, hidden in\nequilibrium, is directly unraveled in the time-domain, but also pave the way\nfor future out-of-equilibrium engineering of novel quantum orders in kagome\nlattice platforms.",

Equally important, studies of individual sources provide additional\nconstraints on the properties of AGN, such as their luminosity and obscuration.\nUntil now, these constraints have not been self-consistently addressed by\nintrinsically linking emission, absorption, and reflection. Here we perform\nnumerical simulations with the ray-tracing code, RefleX, which allows us to\nself-consistently model the X-ray emission of AGN with flexible geometries for\nthe circumnuclear medium. Using the RefleX-simulated emission of an AGN\npopulation, we attempt to simultaneously reproduce the CXB and absorption\nproperties measured in the X-rays, namely the observed fraction of\n$N_{\\mathrm{H}}$ in bins of log($N_{\\mathrm{H}}$) and the fraction of absorbed\nAGN, including their redshift and luminosity evolution. We sample an intrinsic\nX-ray luminosity function and construct gradually more complex physically\nmotivated geometrical models. We examine how well each model can match all\nobservational constraints using a simulation-based inference (SBI) approach. We\nfind that, while the simple unification model can reproduce the CXB, a\nluminosity dependent dusty torus is needed to reproduce the absorption\nproperties. When adding an accretion disc, the model best matches all\nconstraints simultaneously. Our synthetic population is able to reproduce the\ndependence of the covering factor on luminosity, the AGN number counts from\nseveral surveys, and the observed correlation between reflection and\nobscuration.

If the lifetime of the EW vacuum is longer\nthan the universe's age, our vacuum is deemed long-lived, and the parameter\npoint is, in principle, allowed. If the decay rate is smaller than the\nuniverse's age, then our vacuum is unstable and the parameter point is ruled\nout. However, domain walls (DW) in the N2HDM can substantially alter this\npicture. We show in this work that inside the DW, the barrier between our\nelectroweak minimum and the deeper minimum can disappear, leading the scalar\nfields to classically roll over to the deeper minimum that nucleates inside the\nDW and then expands outside of it everywhere in the universe. We show that such\nbehavior can happen to parameter points where the lifetime of our minimum is\neven several orders of magnitude larger than the age of the universe. Such\nparameter points with a metastable EW minimum are ruled out.",

Furthermore, while an approximate $Z_2$\nsymmetry suppresses the leading-order amplitude by a factor of $1/\\tan\\beta$,\nwhich is the ratio of the two vacuum expectation values of the Higgs doublets,\nwe find the two-loop contribution unsuppressed and phenomenologically relevant\nfor $\\tan\\beta \\gtrsim 5$.

    "abstract": "The Audio Mostly (AM) conference has long been a platform for exploring the\nintersection of sound, technology, and culture. Despite growing interest in\nsonic cultures, discussions on the role of cultural diversity in sound design\nand sonification remain limited. This paper investigates the implicit biases\nand gaps within the discourse on music and sound aesthetics, challenging the\nnotion of music as a 'universal language'. Through a historical and\ncross-cultural analysis of musicology and ethnomusicology, the profound\ninfluence of cultural context on auditory perception and aesthetic appraisal is\nhighlighted. By drawing parallels between historical music practices and\ncontemporary sound design, the paper advocates for a more inclusive approach\nthat recognizes the diversity of sonic traditions. Using music as a case study,\nwe underscore broader implications for sound design and sonification,\nemphasizing the need to integrate cultural perspectives into auditory design\npractices. A reevaluation of existing frameworks in sound design and\nsonification is proposed, emphasizing the necessity of culturally informed\npractices that resonate with global audiences. Ultimately, embracing cultural\ndiversity in sound design is suggested to lead to richer, more meaningful\nauditory experiences and to foster greater inclusivity within the field.",

    "abstract": "The ability to track general whole-body motions in the real world is a useful\nway to build general-purpose humanoid robots. However, achieving this can be\nchallenging due to the temporal and kinematic diversity of the motions, the\npolicy's capability, and the difficulty of coordination of the upper and lower\nbodies. To address these issues, we propose GMT, a general and scalable\nmotion-tracking framework that trains a single unified policy to enable\nhumanoid robots to track diverse motions in the real world. GMT is built upon\ntwo core components: an Adaptive Sampling strategy and a Motion\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. The Adaptive Sampling automatically\nbalances easy and difficult motions during training. The MoE ensures better\nspecialization of different regions of the motion manifold. We show through\nextensive experiments in both simulation and the real world the effectiveness\nof GMT, achieving state-of-the-art performance across a broad spectrum of\nmotions using a unified general policy.

To address this gap,\nwe introduce OS-Harm, a new benchmark for measuring safety of computer use\nagents. OS-Harm is built on top of the OSWorld environment and aims to test\nmodels across three categories of harm: deliberate user misuse, prompt\ninjection attacks, and model misbehavior. To cover these cases, we create 150\ntasks that span several types of safety violations (harassment, copyright\ninfringement, disinformation, data exfiltration, etc.) and require the agent to\ninteract with a variety of OS applications (email client, code editor, browser,\netc.). Moreover, we propose an automated judge to evaluate both accuracy and\nsafety of agents that achieves high agreement with human annotations (0.76 and\n0.79 F1 score). We evaluate computer use agents based on a range of frontier\nmodels - such as o4-mini, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro - and provide\ninsights into their safety. In particular, all models tend to directly comply\nwith many deliberate misuse queries, are relatively vulnerable to static prompt\ninjections, and occasionally perform unsafe actions.

These limitations seriously reduce the efficacy of learning from\nexpert demonstrations, resulting in failures in object localization, grasp\nplanning, and long-horizon task execution. To address these challenges, we\npropose Causal Diffusion Policy (CDP), a novel transformer-based diffusion\nmodel that enhances action prediction by conditioning on historical action\nsequences, thereby enabling more coherent and context-aware visuomotor policy\nlearning. To further mitigate the computational cost associated with\nautoregressive inference, a caching mechanism is also introduced to store\nattention key-value pairs from previous timesteps, substantially reducing\nredundant computations during execution. Extensive experiments in both\nsimulated and real-world environments, spanning diverse 2D and 3D manipulation\ntasks, demonstrate that CDP uniquely leverages historical action sequences to\nachieve significantly higher accuracy than existing methods.

We address this gap by defining and\nquantifying optimistic MEV, a form of speculative, on-chain MEV whose detection\nand execution logic reside largely on-chain in smart contracts. As a result of\ntheir speculative nature and lack of off-chain opportunity verification,\noptimistic MEV transactions frequently decide not to execute any trades.\n  In this work, we focus on cyclic arbitrage, which we find is predominantly\nexecuted as optimistic MEV on Layer 2s. Using our multi-stage identification\npipeline on Arbitrum, Base, and Optimism, we show that in Q1 2025, transactions\nfrom cyclic arbitrage contracts account for over 50% of on-chain gas on Base\nand Optimism and 7% on Arbitrum, driven mainly by \"interaction\" probes\n(on-chain computations searching for arbitrage). This speculative probing\nindicates that cyclic arbitrage on Layer 2s is predominantly executed as\noptimistic MEV and contributes to generally keeping blocks on Base and Optimism\npersistently full. Despite consuming over half of on-chain gas, these\noptimistic MEV transactions pay less than one quarter of total gas fees.\nCross-network comparison reveals divergent success rates, differing patterns of\ncode reuse, and sensitivity to varying sequencer ordering and block production\ntimes. Finally, OLS regressions link optimistic MEV trade count to ETH\nvolatility, retail trading activity, and DEX aggregator usage. Together, these\nfindings show that optimistic MEV has become a major source of persistent\nspam-like transaction activity on Layer 2s, dominating blockspace with\nlow-value probes and reshaping the composition of on-chain activity.",

    "abstract": "Accurate and interpretable car-following models are essential for traffic\nsimulation and autonomous vehicle development. However, classical models like\nthe Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) are fundamentally limited by their\nparsimonious and single-regime structure. They fail to capture the multi-modal\nnature of human driving, where a single driving state (e.g., speed, relative\nspeed, and gap) can elicit many different driver actions. This forces the model\nto average across distinct behaviors, reducing its fidelity and making its\nparameters difficult to interpret. To overcome this, we introduce a\nregime-switching framework that allows driving behavior to be governed by\ndifferent IDM parameter sets, each corresponding to an interpretable behavioral\nmode. This design enables the model to dynamically switch between interpretable\nbehavioral modes, rather than averaging across diverse driving contexts. We\ninstantiate the framework using a Factorial Hidden Markov Model with IDM\ndynamics (FHMM-IDM), which explicitly separates intrinsic driving regimes\n(e.g., aggressive acceleration, steady-state following) from external traffic\nscenarios (e.g., free-flow, congestion, stop-and-go) through two independent\nlatent Markov processes. Bayesian inference via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\nis used to jointly estimate the regime-specific parameters, transition\ndynamics, and latent state trajectories. Experiments on the HighD dataset\ndemonstrate that FHMM-IDM uncovers interpretable structure in human driving,\neffectively disentangling internal driver actions from contextual traffic\nconditions and revealing dynamic regime-switching patterns. This framework\nprovides a tractable and principled solution to modeling context-dependent\ndriving behavior under uncertainty, offering improvements in the fidelity of\ntraffic simulations, the efficacy of safety analyses, and the development of\nmore human-centric ADAS.",

    "abstract": "Spin-orbit interaction (SOI) is a fundamental component for electrically\ndriven spin qubits and hybrid superconducting-semiconducting systems. In\nparticular, Rashba SOI (RSOI) is a key mechanism enabling all-electrical spin\nmanipulation schemes. However, in common planar systems, RSOI is weak because\nof the small mixing between heavy holes (HH) and light holes (LH), and instead\nrelies on complex strain and interface phenomena that are hard to reliably\nharness in experiment. Here, MOS-like epitaxial Ge on relaxed \\GeSn{} is\nintroduced and shown to exhibit an inherently large, highly gate-tunable RSOI\nthat is compatible with both spin qubits and hybrid devices. This large RSOI is\na consequence of the LH-like ground state in Ge. Notably, the built-in\nasymmetry of the device causes the RSOI to completely vanish at specific gate\nfields, effectively acting as an on/off SOI switch. The LH $g$-tensor is less\nanisotropic than that of state-of-the-art HH qubits, alleviating precise\nmagnetic field orientation requirements. The large in-plane $g$-factor also\nfacilitates the integration of superconductors. Moreover, the out-of-plane\n$g$-factor is strongly gate-tunable and completely vanishes at specific gate\nfields. Thus, this material system combines the large RSOI with the scalability\nof planar devices, paving the way towards robust spin qubit applications and\nenabling access to new regimes of complex spin physics.",

In this work, we revisit entropy -- a signal of\nexploration in RL -- and examine its relationship to exploratory reasoning in\nLLMs. Through empirical analysis, we uncover positive correlations between\nhigh-entropy regions and three types of exploratory reasoning actions: (1)\npivotal tokens that determine or connect logical steps, (2) reflective actions\nsuch as self-verification and correction, and (3) rare behaviors under-explored\nby the base LLMs. Motivated by this, we introduce a minimal modification to\nstandard RL with only one line of code: augmenting the advantage function with\nan entropy-based term. Unlike traditional maximum-entropy methods which\nencourage exploration by promoting uncertainty, we encourage exploration by\npromoting longer and deeper reasoning chains. Notably, our method achieves\nsignificant gains on the Pass@K metric -- an upper-bound estimator of LLM\nreasoning capabilities -- even when evaluated with extremely large K values,\npushing the boundaries of LLM reasoning.",

To\naddress this specific inefficiency, we move beyond the general principles of\nEfficacy and Efficiency to propose two new, fine-grained principles: Brevity,\nwhich advocates for eliminating redundancy, and Sufficiency, which ensures\ncritical reasoning steps are preserved. Guided by these principles, we\nintroduce LC-R1, a post-training method based on Group Relative Policy\nOptimization (GRPO).

Extensive experiments on\nmultiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that LC-R1 achieves a significant\nreduction in sequence length (~50%) with only a marginal (~2%) drop in\naccuracy, achieving a favorable trade-off point on the Pareto frontier that\nprioritizes high compression.

Each prompt is automatically routed to the most appropriate\ntext-to-image generation function, which may correspond to a distinct number of\ndenoising steps of a diffusion model, or a disparate, independent text-to-image\nmodel. Unlike uniform cost reduction techniques (e.g., distillation, model\nquantization), our approach achieves the optimal trade-off by learning to\nreserve expensive choices (e.g., 100+ denoising steps) only for a few complex\nprompts, and employ more economical choices (e.g., small distilled model) for\nless sophisticated prompts.

Allen, B{\\\"o}ttcher, Griffiths, Kohayakawa, and Morris determined the\nchromatic threshold for every $H$; in particular, they showed that if\n$\\chi(H)=r\\ge 3$, then $\\delta_\\chi(H) \\in\\{\\frac{r-3}{r-2},~\\frac{2 r-5}{2\nr-3},~\\frac{r-2}{r-1}\\}$. While the chromatic thresholds have been completely\ndetermined, rather surprisingly the structural behaviors of extremal graphs\nnear the threshold remain unexplored.\n  In this paper, we establish the stability theorems for chromatic threshold\nproblems. We prove that every $n$-vertex $H$-free graph $G$ with $\\delta(G)\\ge\n(\\delta_\\chi(H)-o(1))n$ and $\\chi(G)=\\omega(1)$ must be structurally close to\none of the extremal configurations. Furthermore, we give a stronger stability\nresult when $H$ is a clique, showing that $G$ admits a partition into\nindependent sets and a small subgraph on sublinear number of vertices. We show\nthat this small subgraph has fractional chromatic number $2+o(1)$ and is\nhomomorphic to a Kneser graph defined by subsets of a logarithmic size set;\nboth these two bounds are best possible. This is the first stability result\nthat captures the lower-order structural features of extremal graphs.\n  We also study two variations of chromatic thresholds. Replacing chromatic\nnumber by its fractional counterpart, we determine the fractional chromatic\nthresholds for all graphs. Another variation is the bounded-VC chromatic\nthresholds, which was introduced by Liu, Shangguan, Skokan, and Xu very\nrecently. Extending work of {\\L}uczak and Thomass{\\'e} on the triangle case, we\ndetermine the bounded-VC chromatic thresholds for all cliques.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in the field of quantum simulation have significantly\nexpanded the potential for applications, particularly in the context of lattice\ngauge theories (LGTs). Maintaining gauge invariance throughout a simulation\nremains a central challenge, especially for large-scale non-Abelian LGTs with\ndynamical matter, which are particularly complex in terms of engineering for\nexperiments. Gauge-symmetry breaking is inevitable in established rishon-based\nschemes for alkaline-earth-like atoms (AELAs) and controlling the magnitude of\nits effect is an open challenge. Here, we first construct a minimal model to\nquantum simulate non-Abelian LGTs ensuring that the gauge constraints are met\nand explicitly derive their unambiguous non-Abelian nature. Second, we present\na proposal for a novel gauge protection scheme using native interactions in\nAELAs enabling the simulation of toy models of non-Abelian $U(2)$ LGTs with\ndynamical fermionic matter in $(2+1)$ dimensions on large scales. Due to the\nsimplicity of the gauge protection mechanism, based on a Zeeman shift in\ncombination with superexchange interactions, our scheme can be naturally\nincluded in other rishon-based quantum simulation protocols. Third, we extend\nour approach to a fully scalable, hybrid digital-analog simulator for $U(N)$\nLGTs based on Rydberg AELA with variable rishon number. The proposed general\nmechanism for gauge protection provides a promising path towards the\nlong-awaited simulation of non-Abelian LGTs relevant to particle physics.",

    "abstract": "We study the task of bandit learning, also known as best-arm identification,\nunder the assumption that the true reward function f belongs to a known, but\narbitrary, function class F. We seek a general theory of bandit learnability,\nakin to the PAC framework for classification. Our investigation is guided by\nthe following two questions: (1) which classes F are learnable, and (2) how\nthey are learnable. For example, in the case of binary PAC classification,\nlearnability is fully determined by a combinatorial dimension - the VC\ndimension- and can be attained via a simple algorithmic principle, namely,\nempirical risk minimization (ERM). In contrast to classical learning-theoretic\nresults, our findings reveal limitations of learning in structured bandits,\noffering insights into the boundaries of bandit learnability. First, for the\nquestion of \"which\", we show that the paradigm of identifying the learnable\nclasses via a dimension-like quantity fails for bandit learning. We give a\nsimple proof demonstrating that no combinatorial dimension can characterize\nbandit learnability, even in finite classes, following a standard definition of\ndimension introduced by Ben-David et al. (2019). For the question of \"how\", we\nprove a computational hardness result: we construct a reward function class for\nwhich at most two queries are needed to find the optimal action, yet no\nalgorithm can do so in polynomial time unless RP=NP. We also prove that this\nclass admits efficient algorithms for standard algorithmic operations often\nconsidered in learning theory, such as an ERM. This implies that computational\nhardness is in this case inherent to the task of bandit learning. Beyond these\nresults, we investigate additional themes such as learning under noise,\ntrade-offs between noise models, and the relationship between query complexity\nand regret minimization.",

Addressing these gaps, this\npaper extends our prior work on the Dynamic Management of Resources (DMR)\nframework, which provides a modular and user-friendly approach to dynamic\nresource allocation. Building upon the original DMRlib reconfiguration runtime,\nthis work integrates new methodology from the Malleability Module (MaM) of the\nProteo framework, further enhancing reconfiguration capabilities with new\nspawning strategies and data redistribution methods. In this paper, we explore\nnew malleability strategies in HPC dynamic workloads, such as merging MPI\ncommunicators and asynchronous reconfigurations, which offer new opportunities\nfor dramatically reducing memory overhead. The proposed enhancements are\nrigorously evaluated on a world-class supercomputer, demonstrating improved\nresource utilization and workload efficiency.

A lifelike talking head\nrequires synchronized coordination of subject identity, lip movements, facial\nexpressions, and head poses. The absence of these synchronizations is a\nfundamental flaw, leading to unrealistic results. To address the critical issue\nof synchronization, identified as the ''devil'' in creating realistic talking\nheads, we introduce SyncTalk++, which features a Dynamic Portrait Renderer with\nGaussian Splatting to ensure consistent subject identity preservation and a\nFace-Sync Controller that aligns lip movements with speech while innovatively\nusing a 3D facial blendshape model to reconstruct accurate facial expressions.\nTo ensure natural head movements, we propose a Head-Sync Stabilizer, which\noptimizes head poses for greater stability. Additionally, SyncTalk++ enhances\nrobustness to out-of-distribution (OOD) audio by incorporating an Expression\nGenerator and a Torso Restorer, which generate speech-matched facial\nexpressions and seamless torso regions. Our approach maintains consistency and\ncontinuity in visual details across frames and significantly improves rendering\nspeed and quality, achieving up to 101 frames per second. Extensive experiments\nand user studies demonstrate that SyncTalk++ outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods in synchronization and realism.

The\naddition of these models, and their use in a new iteration of the code allows\nus to use sulphur lines to precisely estimate the sulphur abundance, even in\nthe absence of auroral lines. This approach aligns with the results from the\ndirect method, and no additional assumptions about the ionization correction\nfactor are needed, as the models directly predict the total sulphur abundance.\nWe applied this new methodology to a large sample of star-forming regions from\nthe MaNGA survey, and we explored the variation of the S/O ratio as a function\nof metallicity, making corrections for the significant contribution from\ndiffuse ionized gas, which particularly affects the [SII] emission.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we solve the long-standing problem of designing I/O-efficient\ncompressed indexes. Our solution broadly consists of generalizing suffix\nsorting and revisiting suffix tree path compression. In classic suffix trees,\npath compression works by replacing unary suffix trie paths with pairs of\npointers to $T$, which must be available in the form of some random access\noracle at query time. In our approach, instead, we (i) sort the suffix tree's\nleaves according to a more general priority function $\\pi$ (generalizing suffix\nsorting), (ii) we build a suffix tree path decomposition prioritizing the\nleftmost paths in such an order, and (iii) we path-compress the decomposition's\npaths as pointers to a small subset of the string's suffixes. At this point, we\nshow that the colexicographically-sorted array of those pointers represents a\nnew elegant, simple, and remarkably I/O-efficient compressed suffix tree. For\ninstance, by taking $\\pi$ to be the lexicographic rank of $T$'s suffixes, we\ncan compress the suffix tree topology in $O(r)$ space on top of a $n\\log\\sigma\n+ O(\\log n)$-bits text representation while essentially matching the pattern\nmatching I/O complexity of Weiner and McCreight's suffix tree. Another (more\npractical) solution is obtained by taking $\\pi$ to be the colexicographic rank\nof $T$'s prefixes and using a fully-compressed random access oracle. The\nresulting self-index allows us to locate all occurrences of a given query\npattern in less space and orders of magnitude faster than the $r$-index.",

    "abstract": "The air flows in the proximal and distal portions of the human lungs are\ninterconnected: the lower Reynolds number in the deeper generations causes a\nprogressive flow regularization, while mass conservation requires flow rate\noscillations to propagate through the airway bifurcations. To explain how these\ntwo competing effects shape the flow state in the deeper generations, we have\nperformed the first high-fidelity numerical simulations of the air flow in a\nlung model including 23 successive bifurcations of a single planar airway.\nTurbulence modelling or assumptions on flow regimes are not required. The\nchosen flow rate is stationary (steady on average), and representative of the\npeak inspiratory flow reached by adult patients breathing through therapeutical\ninhalers. As expected, advection becomes progressively less important after\neach bifurcation, until a time-dependent Stokes regime governed solely by\nviscous diffusion is established in the smallest generations. However,\nfluctuations in this regime are relatively fast and large with respect to the\nmean flow, which is in contrast with the commonly agreed picture that only the\nbreathing frequency is relevant at the scale of the alveoli. We demonstrate\nthat the characteristic frequency and amplitude of these fluctuations are\nlinked to the flow in the upper part of the bronchial tree, as they originate\nfrom the time-dependent flow splitting in the upper bifurcations. Even though\nthese fluctuations are observed here in an idealized, rigid lung model, our\nfindings suggest that the assumptions usually adopted in many of the current\nlung models might need to be revised.",

Existing methods\nare either confined to simple, predefined scenarios or restricted to\ntask-specific data distributions at training, limiting their support for\nreal-world assistance. We introduce Casper, an assistive teleoperation system\nthat leverages commonsense knowledge embedded in pre-trained visual language\nmodels (VLMs) for real-time intent inference and flexible skill execution.\nCasper incorporates an open-world perception module for a generalized\nunderstanding of novel objects and scenes, a VLM-powered intent inference\nmechanism that leverages commonsense reasoning to interpret snippets of\nteleoperated user input, and a skill library that expands the scope of prior\nassistive teleoperation systems to support diverse, long-horizon mobile\nmanipulation tasks. Extensive empirical evaluation, including human studies and\nsystem ablations, demonstrates that Casper improves task performance, reduces\nhuman cognitive load, and achieves higher user satisfaction than direct\nteleoperation and assistive teleoperation baselines.

    "abstract": "Multistep staircase avalanche photodiodes (APDs) are the solid-state analogue\nof photomultiplier tubes, owing to their deterministic amplification with\ntwofold stepwise gain via impact ionization. Yet, the stepwise impact\nionization irregularities worsen with increasing step counts, which are a major\nsource of internal noise in these APDs. Some noise models for staircase APDs\nhave been previously reported, where the excess noise factor expressions are\nbased on Friis' noise factor formula for cascade networks, erroneously\nconsidering the power gains as the gains. Excess noise factor being a key\ncomponent in staircase APDs' noise models, we formulate generalized excess\nnoise factor expressions for multilayer graded-bandgap APDs in terms of their\nlayer-wise ionization probabilities, applicable for all operating biases, which\ninclude the sub-threshold, staircase, and tunnelling breakdown regimes. We\nfurther derive simplified expressions for staircase APDs and prove that these\nexpressions match Bangera's corrections to Friis' noise factor formulas for\ncascade networks.",

    "abstract": "As technology increasingly aligns with users' personal values, traditional\nmodels of usability, focused on functionality and specifically effectiveness,\nefficiency, and satisfaction, may not fully capture how people perceive and\nevaluate it. This study investigates how the warm-glow phenomenon, the positive\nfeeling associated with doing good, shapes perceived usability. An experimental\napproach was taken in which participants evaluated a hypothetical technology\nunder conditions designed to evoke either the intrinsic (i.e., personal\nfulfillment) or extrinsic (i.e., social recognition) dimensions of warm-glow. A\nMultivariate Analysis of Variance as well as subsequent follow-up analyses\nrevealed that intrinsic warm-glow significantly enhances all dimensions of\nperceived usability, while extrinsic warm-glow selectively influences perceived\neffectiveness and satisfaction. These findings suggest that perceptions of\nusability extend beyond functionality and are shaped by how technology\nresonates with users' broader sense of purpose. We conclude by proposing that\ndesigners consider incorporating warm-glow into technology as a strategic\ndesign decision.",

    "abstract": "Cone-beam X-ray computed tomography (XCT) is an essential imaging technique\nfor generating 3D reconstructions of internal structures, with applications\nranging from medical to industrial imaging. Producing high-quality\nreconstructions typically requires many X-ray measurements; this process can be\nslow and expensive, especially for dense materials. Recent work incorporating\nartifact reduction priors within a plug-and-play (PnP) reconstruction framework\nhas shown promising results in improving image quality from sparse-view XCT\nscans while enhancing the generalizability of deep learning-based solutions.\nHowever, this method uses a 2D convolutional neural network (CNN) for artifact\nreduction, which captures only slice-independent information from the 3D\nreconstruction, limiting performance. In this paper, we propose a PnP\nreconstruction method that uses a 2.5D artifact reduction CNN as the prior.\nThis approach leverages inter-slice information from adjacent slices, capturing\nricher spatial context while remaining computationally efficient. We show that\nthis 2.5D prior not only improves the quality of reconstructions but also\nenables the model to directly suppress commonly occurring XCT artifacts (such\nas beam hardening), eliminating the need for artifact correction\npre-processing. Experiments on both experimental and synthetic cone-beam XCT\ndata demonstrate that the proposed method better preserves fine structural\ndetails, such as pore size and shape, leading to more accurate defect detection\ncompared to 2D priors. In particular, we demonstrate strong performance on\nexperimental XCT data using a 2.5D artifact reduction prior trained entirely on\nsimulated scans, highlighting the proposed method's ability to generalize\nacross domains.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the triangular instability of a Batchelor vortex subjected to\na stationary triangular strain field generated by three satellite vortices, in\nthe presence of weak axial flow. The analysis combines theoretical predictions\nwith numerical simulations. Theoretically, the instability arises from resonant\ncoupling between two quasi-neutral Kelvin modes with azimuthal wavenumbers $m$\nand $m+3$ with the background strain. Numerically, we solve the linearized\nNavier-Stokes equations around a quasi-steady base flow to identify the most\nunstable modes, and compare their growth rates and frequencies with theoretical\npredictions for a Reynolds number $Re = 10^4$ and a straining strength\n$\\epsilon = 0.008$. In the absence of axial flow, only the mode pair $(m_A,\nm_B) = (-1,2)$ (and its symmetric counterpart) is unstable. However, we show\nthat additional combinations such as $(0,3)$, $(1,4)$, and $(2,5)$, which are\notherwise strongly damped by the critical layer in the absence of axial flow,\nalso become unstable once axial flow exceeds a certain threshold, as the\ncritical layer damping is significantly reduced. Furthermore, we show that the\nmost unstable mode in the no-axial-flow case, originating from the second\nbranch of $m = -1$ and the first branch of $m = 2$, becomes less unstable as\naxial flow increases. It is eventually overtaken by a mode from the first\nbranches of both wavenumbers, which then remains the dominant unstable mode\nacross a wide range of axial flow strengths and Reynolds numbers. A\ncomprehensive instability diagram as a function of the axial flow parameter is\npresented.",

    "abstract": "Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) is essential for various\ndata-intensive applications, including recommendation systems, image retrieval,\nand machine learning. Scaling ANNS to handle billions of high-dimensional\nvectors on a single machine presents significant challenges in memory capacity\nand processing efficiency. To address these challenges, distributed vector\ndatabases leverage multiple nodes for the parallel storage and processing of\nvectors. However, existing solutions often suffer from load imbalance and high\ncommunication overhead, primarily due to traditional partition strategies that\nfail to effectively distribute the workload. In this paper, we introduce\nHarmony, a distributed ANNS system that employs a novel multi-granularity\npartition strategy, combining dimension-based and vector-based partition. This\nstrategy ensures a balanced distribution of computational load across all nodes\nwhile effectively minimizing communication costs. Furthermore, Harmony\nincorporates an early-stop pruning mechanism that leverages the monotonicity of\ndistance computations in dimension-based partition, resulting in significant\nreductions in both computational and communication overhead. We conducted\nextensive experiments on diverse real-world datasets, demonstrating that\nHarmony outperforms leading distributed vector databases, achieving 4.63 times\nthroughput on average in four nodes and 58% performance improvement over\ntraditional distribution for skewed workloads.",

The fusion\nof camera and LiDAR data addresses the limitations of individual sensors but\nrelies on precise extrinsic calibration. Recently, numerous end-to-end\ncalibration methods have been proposed; however, most predict extrinsic\nparameters in a single step and lack iterative optimization capabilities. To\naddress the increasing demand for higher accuracy, we propose a versatile\niterative framework based on surrogate diffusion. This framework can enhance\nthe performance of any calibration method without requiring architectural\nmodifications. Specifically, the initial extrinsic parameters undergo iterative\nrefinement through a denoising process, in which the original calibration\nmethod serves as a surrogate denoiser to estimate the final extrinsics at each\nstep. For comparative analysis, we selected four state-of-the-art calibration\nmethods as surrogate denoisers and compared the results of our diffusion\nprocess with those of two other iterative approaches. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that when integrated with our diffusion model, all calibration\nmethods achieve higher accuracy, improved robustness, and greater stability\ncompared to other iterative techniques and their single-step counterparts.",

Large\ngeneral-purpose models are trained for many tasks, but work best on\nhigh-frequency use cases. After training, it is hard to adapt a model to\nperform well on specific use cases underrepresented in the training corpus.\nRelying on prompt engineering or few-shot examples to maximize the output\nquality on a particular test case can be frustrating, as models can be highly\nsensitive to small changes, react in unpredicted ways or rely on a fixed system\nprompt for maintaining performance. In this work, we ask: \"Can we optimize our\ntraining protocols to both improve controllability and performance on\nunderrepresented use cases at inference time?\" We revisit the divide between\ntraining and inference techniques to improve long-tail performance while\nproviding users with a set of control levers the model is trained to be\nresponsive to. We create a detailed taxonomy of data characteristics and task\nprovenance to explicitly control generation attributes and implicitly condition\ngenerations at inference time. We fine-tune a base model to infer these markers\nautomatically, which makes them optional at inference time. This principled and\nflexible approach yields pronounced improvements in performance, especially on\nexamples from the long tail of the training distribution. While we observe an\naverage lift of 5.7% win rates in open-ended generation quality with our\nmarkers, we see over 9.1% gains in underrepresented domains.

    "abstract": "When quantum measurements are conducted over spacelike-separated regions of\nspacetime, a natural and commonly assumed physical postulate, called Einstein\ncausality, asserts that they should commute. In this paper, we provide a\ngeneralisation to L\\\"uders' rule \\`a la Aharonov-Albert in those globally\nhyperbolic spacetimes which allow unitarily equivalent Hilbert spaces to be\ndefined along Cauchy hypersurfaces, thus relying on the existence of an\ninteraction picture \\`a la Tomonaga-Schwinger. We show that under this rule,\nselective quantum measurements satisfy a state-independent anyonic commutation\nrelation over spacelike-separated (pre)compact regions. We highlight that this\npropagates to positive operator-valued measures (POVMs), where the commutation\nis necessarily bosonic. In the simplistic scenario where the measurements are\nassumed to be instantaneous, this implies quantum no-signalling for\nnon-selective measurements. We then examine Sorkin's impossible measurements\nand show that immediate contradictions can be averted as long as\ncollapse-inducing measurements are irreversible. We finish by discussing the\npossibility of extending such results beyond the interaction picture.",

We propose and experimentally\nimplement a magic-state preparation protocol to fault-tolerantly prepare a pair\nof logical magic states in a [[6,2,2]] quantum error-detecting code using only\neight physical qubits. Implementing this protocol on H1-1, a 20 qubit\ntrapped-ion quantum processor, we prepare magic states with experimental\ninfidelity $7^{+3}_{-1}\\times 10^{-5}$ with a $14.8^{+1}_{-1}\\%$ discard rate\nand use these to perform a fault-tolerant non-Clifford gate, the\ncontrolled-Hadamard (CH), with logical infidelity $\\leq 2.3^{+9}_{-9}\\times\n10^{-4}$.

Following the\nemerging trend of large-scale pretraining, we decompose interactive\nsegmentation into meta-tasks that capture different levels of information --\ncontext, object, and detail -- assigning a dedicated subnet to each level.This\ndecomposition allows each subnet to undergo scaled pretraining with independent\ndata and supervision, maximizing its effectiveness.

As a result, FocalClick-XL achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on click-based benchmarks and demonstrates\nremarkable adaptability to diverse interaction formats, including boxes,\nscribbles, and coarse masks. Beyond binary mask generation, it is also capable\nof predicting alpha mattes with fine-grained details, making it a versatile and\npowerful tool for interactive segmentation.",

However, an\nideal Ising machine would associate both types of nanodevices, and they must\noperate synergistically to support annealing: a progressive reduction of\nmachine stochasticity that allows it to settle to energy minimum. Here, we\nreport an Ising machine that combines two nanotechnologies: memristor crossbar\n-- storing multi-level couplings -- and stochastic magnetic tunnel junction\n(SMTJ), acting as thermally driven spins. Because the same read voltage that\ninterrogates the crossbar also biases the SMTJs, increasing this voltage\nautomatically lowers the effective temperature of the machine, providing an\nintrinsic, nearly circuit-free annealing technique. Operating at zero magnetic\nfield, our prototype consistently reaches the global optimum of a 24-vertex\nweighted MAX-CUT and a 10-vertex, three-color graph-coloring problem.

    "abstract": "Density Functional Theory (DFT) is the most widely used electronic structure\nmethod for predicting the properties of molecules and materials. Although DFT\nis, in principle, an exact reformulation of the Schr\\\"odinger equation,\npractical applications rely on approximations to the unknown\nexchange-correlation (XC) functional. Most existing XC functionals are\nconstructed using a limited set of increasingly complex, hand-crafted features\nthat improve accuracy at the expense of computational efficiency. Yet, no\ncurrent approximation achieves the accuracy and generality for predictive\nmodeling of laboratory experiments at chemical accuracy -- typically defined as\nerrors below 1 kcal/mol. In this work, we present Skala, a modern deep\nlearning-based XC functional that bypasses expensive hand-designed features by\nlearning representations directly from data. Skala achieves chemical accuracy\nfor atomization energies of small molecules while retaining the computational\nefficiency typical of semi-local DFT. This performance is enabled by training\non an unprecedented volume of high-accuracy reference data generated using\ncomputationally intensive wavefunction-based methods. Notably, Skala\nsystematically improves with additional training data covering diverse\nchemistry. By incorporating a modest amount of additional high-accuracy data\ntailored to chemistry beyond atomization energies, Skala achieves accuracy\ncompetitive with the best-performing hybrid functionals across general main\ngroup chemistry, at the cost of semi-local DFT. As the training dataset\ncontinues to expand, Skala is poised to further enhance the predictive power of\nfirst-principles simulations.",

    "abstract": "To ensure security of supply in the power sector, many countries are already\nusing or discussing the introduction of capacity mechanisms. Two main types of\nsuch mechanisms include capacity markets and capacity reserves. Simultaneously,\nthe expansion of variable renewable energy sources increases the need for power\nsector flexibility, for which there are promising yet often under-utilized\noptions on the demand side. In this paper, we analyze how a centralized\ncapacity market and an advanced reliability reserve with a moderately high\nactivation price affect investments in demand-side flexibility technologies. We\ndo so for a German case study of 2030, using an open-source capacity expansion\nmodel and incorporating detailed demand-side flexibility potentials across\nindustry, process heat, and district heating. We show that a centralized\ncapacity market effectively caps peak prices in the wholesale electricity\nmarket and thus reduces incentives for investments in demand-side flexibility\noptions. The advanced reliability reserve induces substantially higher\nflexibility investments while leading to similar overall electricity supply\ncosts and ensuring a similar level of security of supply. The advanced\nreliability reserve could thus create a learning environment for flexibility\ntechnologies to support the transition to climate neutral energy systems.\nAdditionally, an advanced reliability reserve could be introduced faster and is\nmore flexible than a centralized capacity market. While concrete design\nparameters are yet to be specified, we argue that policymakers should consider\nthe reliability reserve concept in upcoming decision on capacity mechanisms in\nGermany and beyond.",

This study\ndemonstrates that, for certain configurations, off-shell effects remain\nsignificant even when the width-to-mass ratios of the unstable particles are\nsufficiently small, rendering the narrow-width approximation unreliable and\nnecessitating the use of the complex mass scheme.

Our framework incorporates three key\ninnovations: (1) Half-overlapped Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) Framing: This\nreduces redundant data by approximately 25% while maintaining essential phoneme\ntransition cues. (2) Sparsity-aware Data Reduction: We exploit frame-level\nsparsity to achieve an additional 50% data reduction by combining frame\nskipping with stride-based filtering.

ASAP-FE is implemented with various\nfilter cluster sizes on edge processors, with functionality verified on FPGA\nprototypes and designs synthesized at 45 nm. Experimental results using\nTC-ResNet8, DS-CNN, and KWT-1 demonstrate that ASAP-FE reduces the average\nworkload by 62.73% while supporting real-time processing for up to 32 channels.\nCompared to a conventional fully overlapped baseline, ASAP-FE achieves less\nthan a 1% accuracy drop (e.g., 96.22% vs. 97.13% for DS-CNN), which is well\nwithin acceptable limits for edge AI. By adjusting the number of filter\nmodules, our design optimizes the trade-off between performance and energy,\nwith 15 parallel filters providing optimal performance for up to 25 channels.\nOverall, ASAP-FE offers a practical and efficient solution for multi-channel\nKWS on energy-constrained edge devices.",

Our position is\nthat a broader conception of what rigorous AI research and practice should\nentail is needed. We believe such a conception -- in addition to a more\nexpansive understanding of (1) methodological rigor -- should include aspects\nrelated to (2) what background knowledge informs what to work on (epistemic\nrigor); (3) how disciplinary, community, or personal norms, standards, or\nbeliefs influence the work (normative rigor); (4) how clearly articulated the\ntheoretical constructs under use are (conceptual rigor); (5) what is reported\nand how (reporting rigor); and (6) how well-supported the inferences from\nexisting evidence are (interpretative rigor). In doing so, we also aim to\nprovide useful language and a framework for much-needed dialogue about the AI\ncommunity's work by researchers, policymakers, journalists, and other\nstakeholders.",

Using a modified version of the\nLare2d code, we study the evolution of flare-heated coronal loops under three\nthermal transport models: classical Spitzer-Harm (SH), a flux-limited local\nmodel (FL), and the non-local Schurtz-Nicolai-Basquet (SNB) model. The SNB\nmodel is used extensively in laser-plasma studies. It has been benchmarked\nagainst accurate non-local Vlasov-Fokker-Planck models and proven to be the\nmost accurate non-local model which can be applied on fluid time-scales.\nAnalysis of the density-temperature evolution cycles near the loop apex reveals\na distinct evolutionary path for the SNB model, with higher temperatures and\nlower densities than local models. During energy deposition, the SNB model\nproduces a more localised and intense temperature peak at the apex due to heat\nflux suppression, which also reduces chromospheric evaporation and results in\nlower post-flare densities. EUV emission synthesis shows that the SNB model\nyields flare light curves with lower peak amplitudes and smoother decay phases.\nWe also find that non-local transport affects equilibrium loop conditions,\nproducing hotter and more rarefied apexes. These findings emphasise the need to\naccount for non-local conduction in dynamic solar phenomena and highlight the\npotential of the SNB model for improving the realism of flare simulations.\nFlux-limited conduction models cannot reproduce the results of non-local\ntransport covered by the SNB model.",

C 0405132, 145 (2004); CQG 26, 163001 (2009)]: (i) the\ndiscontinuity in highly damped QNMs between Schwarzschild and Kerr solutions as\n$a \\to 0$, and (ii) the unexplained spectral proximity between QNMs and\nalgebraically special (AS) frequencies, particularly the anomalous multiplet\nsplitting for Kerr $\\ell=2$, $m \\geq 0$ modes. We develop a novel method to\ncompute complete QNM spectra for Type-D black holes, solving both problems and\nestablishing a mathematical framework for boundary value problems of\ndissipative systems. Using analytic continuation of radial eigenvalue\nequations, our method eliminates the dependence on auxiliary parameters in the\nconnection formulas for confluent Heun solutions. This breakthrough overcomes\nthe long-standing challenge of calculating QNMs that cross or lie on the\nnegative imaginary axis (NIA). For Schwarzschild and Kerr spacetimes ($0 \\leq\n\\hat{n} \\leq 41$, $2 \\leq \\ell \\leq 16$), we present complete spectra validated\nthrough scattering amplitudes with errors $<10^{-10}$. The results provide\ndefinitive solutions to both open problems: (i) The inability of conventional\nmethods to compute QNMs crossing or residing on the NIA leads to apparent\ndiscontinuities in Kerr spectra as $a \\to 0$. (ii) When a QNM exactly coincides\nwith the AS frequency, an additional QNM (unconventional mode) appears nearby.\nFor the Kerr case with $\\ell=2$, overtone sequences from both unconventional\nand AS modes exhibit precisely $2\\ell+1$ branches, without multiplets or\nsupersymmetry breaking at AS frequencies. Our method confirms Leung's\nconjecture of high-$\\ell$ unconventional mode deviations from the NIA through\nthe first $\\ell=3$ calculation.

Due to their linguistic capacities, it\nis possible that LLMs are an efficient alternative to time-consuming manual\ncoding and the pre-training of supervised machine learning models. As most\nexisting research on this topic has focused on English-language responses\nrelating to non-complex topics or on single LLMs, it is unclear whether its\nfindings generalize and how the quality of these classifications compares to\nestablished methods. In this study, we investigate to what extent different\nLLMs can be used to code open-ended survey responses in other contexts, using\nGerman data on reasons for survey participation as an example. We compare\nseveral state-of-the-art LLMs and several prompting approaches, and evaluate\nthe LLMs' performance by using human expert codings. Overall performance\ndiffers greatly between LLMs, and only a fine-tuned LLM achieves satisfactory\nlevels of predictive performance. Performance differences between prompting\napproaches are conditional on the LLM used. Finally, LLMs' unequal\nclassification performance across different categories of reasons for survey\nparticipation results in different categorical distributions when not using\nfine-tuning. We discuss the implications of these findings, both for\nmethodological research on coding open-ended responses and for their\nsubstantive analysis, and for practitioners processing or substantively\nanalyzing such data. Finally, we highlight the many trade-offs researchers need\nto consider when choosing automated methods for open-ended response\nclassification in the age of LLMs. In doing so, our study contributes to the\ngrowing body of research about the conditions under which LLMs can be\nefficiently, accurately, and reliably leveraged in survey research.",

The scheme\ninvolves injecting an arbitrary quantum state and a single photon into the\nsignal and idler ports, respectively, of an interference setup that\nincorporates a third-order nonlinear medium. A nG state is conditionally\nproduced at the signal output, heralded by the detection of a single photon in\none of the idler output channels. The protocol exploits a weak cross-Kerr\ninteraction and effective single-photon nonlinearity enhanced by the weak-value\namplification. We show that by tuning the weak value of the photon number\noperator in the idler mode within experimentally feasible parameters, a wide\nvariety of nG states can be generated with high fidelity. As specific examples,\nwe demonstrate the generation of photon-added states, displaced and squeezed\nnumber states, and a continuum of intermediate nG states using coherent and\nsqueezed vacuum inputs, respectively. Furthermore, we show that the protocol\nenables the enhancement of non-Gaussianity and the enlargement of Schr\\\"odinger\ncat (SC) states when ideal SC states are used as the input. Our results provide\nan alternative route for the conditional generation of tunable nG states, with\npotential applications in quantum information processing.

Our design avoids division operations involving dynamic\nvariables and incorporate the impact of additive noise introduced by optical\namplifiers. Simulation results show that the effective denoising can be\nachieved in terms of peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) and structural\nsimilarity index measure (SSIM) even when the circuit noise at the amplifiers\nis taken into account.",

However, many of these tasks are\nalso characterized by the presence of expensive constraints whose analytical\nformulation is unknown and often defined in high-dimensional spaces where\nfeasible regions are small, irregular, and difficult to identify. In such\ncases, a substantial portion of the optimization budget may be spent just\ntrying to locate the first feasible solution, limiting the effectiveness of\nexisting methods. In this work, we present a Feasibility-Driven Trust Region\nBayesian Optimization (FuRBO) algorithm. FuRBO iteratively defines a trust\nregion from which the next candidate solution is selected, using information\nfrom both the objective and constraint surrogate models. Our adaptive strategy\nallows the trust region to shift and resize significantly between iterations,\nenabling the optimizer to rapidly refocus its search and consistently\naccelerate the discovery of feasible and good-quality solutions. We empirically\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of FuRBO through extensive testing on the full\nBBOB-constrained COCO benchmark suite and other physics-inspired benchmarks,\ncomparing it against state-of-the-art baselines for constrained black-box\noptimization across varying levels of constraint severity and problem\ndimensionalities ranging from 2 to 60.",

The success of such an interface clearly will depend on providing\nrobust abstractions and features adhering to the generic programming principles\nthat underpin the C++ programming language, without compromising on either\nperformance and portability, the core principles upon which MPI was founded.\nHowever, there is a tension between idiomatic C++ handling of types and\nlifetimes, and, MPI's loose interpretation of object lifetimes/ownership and\ninsistence on maintaining global states.\n  Instead of proposing \"yet another\" high-level C++ interface to MPI,\noverlooking or providing partial solutions to work around the key issues\nconcerning the dissonance between MPI semantics and idiomatic C++, this paper\nfocuses on the three fundamental aspects of a high-level interface: type\nsystem, object lifetimes and communication buffers, also identifying\ninconsistencies in the MPI specification. Presumptive solutions can be\nunrefined, and we hope the broader MPI and C++ communities will engage with us\nin productive exchange of ideas and concerns.",

We address this challenge through diffusion\npolicies learned in a latent action space that unifies diverse end-effector\nactions. We first show that we can learn a semantically aligned latent action\nspace for anthropomorphic robotic hands, a human hand, and a parallel jaw\ngripper using encoders trained with a contrastive loss. Second, we show that by\nusing our proposed latent action space for co-training on manipulation data\nfrom different end-effectors, we can utilize a single policy for multi-robot\ncontrol and obtain up to 25% improved manipulation success rates, indicating\nsuccessful skill transfer despite a significant embodiment gap.

Non-parametric DM methods struggle\nwith scalability and adversarial DM approaches suffer from instability and mode\ncollapse. While likelihood-based methods are a promising alternative, they\noften impose unnecessary biases through fixed priors or require explicit\ndensity models (e.g., flows) that can be challenging to train. We address this\nlimitation by introducing a novel approach to training likelihood-based DM\nusing expressive score-based prior distributions. Our key insight is that\ngradient-based DM training only requires the prior's score function -- not its\ndensity -- allowing us to train the prior via denoising score matching. This\napproach eliminates biases from fixed priors (e.g., in VAEs), enabling more\neffective use of geometry-preserving regularization, while avoiding the\nchallenge of learning an explicit prior density model (e.g., a flow-based\nprior). Our method also demonstrates better stability and computational\nefficiency compared to other diffusion-based priors (e.g., LSGM).

This paper aims to provide an overview of the state of the art of\ncomputational studies in influencer marketing by conducting a systematic\nliterature review (SLR) based on the PRISMA model. The paper analyses 69\nstudies to identify key research themes, methodologies, and future directions\nin this research field.

Key findings reveal\na strong focus on optimising commercial outcomes, with limited attention to\nregulatory compliance and ethical considerations.

We adopt the commonly used assumption that the\nproperties of disk-protostar accretion in Class I objects is similar to the\ndisk-star accretion in Class II objects. Using simultaneous observations of\nthree hydrogen recombination lines Brg, Pfg, and Bra, we derive the mean\nintrinsic line ratios, and we verified that these are constant across the\nprobed range of photospheric and accretion properties. We establish\ncorrelations between the line luminosities and accretion luminosity. We measure\nthe extinction towards the line emission regions in Class I protostars\ncomparing the observed line ratios to the Class II mean values. We then derive\nthe Class I accretion luminosities from the established Class II correlations.\nWe find that the accretion luminosity dominates the bolometric luminosity for\nthe more embedded protostars, corresponding to lower values of the bolometric\ntemperature. As the bolometric temperature increases above ~700K, there is a\nsharp drop of the contribution of the accretion from the bolometric luminosity.\nOur finding are in qualitative agreement with numerical simulations of star\nformation. We suggest that this methodology should be applied to larger and\nmore statistically significant samples of Class I objects, for a more detailed\ncomparison.

    "abstract": "Recent efforts to combine low-rank adaptation (LoRA) with mixture-of-experts\n(MoE) for adapting large language models (LLMs) to multiple tasks still exhibit\nprevailing limitations: they either swap entire attention/feed-forward layers\nfor switch experts or bolt on parallel expert branches, diluting parameter\nefficiency and task fidelity. We propose the LoRA-Mixer, a modular and\nlightweight MoE framework that integrates LoRA experts. Our core innovation\nlies in replacing the projection matrices of the attention module's\ninput/output linear layers with dynamically routed, task-specific LoRA experts.\nThis design ensures seamless compatibility with diverse foundation models,\nincluding transformers and state space models (SSMs), by leveraging their\ninherent linear projection structures. The framework supports two operational\nparadigms: (1) joint optimization of LoRA experts and routing mechanisms via a\nnovel hard-soft routing strategy, or (2) direct deployment of pre-trained,\nfrozen LoRA modules sourced from external repositories. To enable robust router\ntraining with limited data while ensuring stable routing decisions and\nmaximizing expert reuse, we introduce an adaptive Specialization Balance Loss\n(SBL) that jointly optimizes expert balance and task-specific alignment.\nExtensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets, including MedQA, CoLA,\nSST-2, GSM8K, ARC-E, ARC-C, and HumanEval, demonstrate the effectiveness of\nLoRA-Mixer. On datasets such as GSM8K, HumanEval, and MedQA, LoRA-Mixer\nachieves significant improvements of 7.61%, 4.88%, and 3.08% over the base\nmodels, respectively. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, LoRA-Mixer\nachieves additional improvements of 1.09%, 1.45%, and 1.68%, respectively,\nusing only 48% of the parameters, demonstrating its efficiency and strong\nperformance.",

In particular, biomolecular\ncondensates readily self-assemble via phase separation, but may also need to\nresist external forces to fulfil their function. Spatial localisation of\ncondensate formation can be controlled by active cores that preferentially\ndrive the production of condensate material at a particular point, while\nresistance to external forces can be facilitated by viscoelastic material\nproperties. To investigate the interplay of these two processes, we develop a\ncontinuum model of viscoelastic growth around an active core. We find that\nviscoelastic stresses restrict condensate growth, but also impart resistance to\ndeformation. We investigate the effect of different incorporation schemes on\ngrowth dynamics, and test the influence of mechanical properties on condensate\nstrength. Finally, we compare the predictions of our model to experimental data\nfrom centrosomes in C. elegans embryos, identifying a parameter regime in which\nrapid growth can be combined with appropriate mechanical strength, and studying\nhow strain-dependent material incorporation may lead to isotropic growth of\nscaffold material.

One of the promising paths\ntoward achieving this objective is the development of a co-design approach\ncombining different technology layers including device, circuits and\nalgorithms.

Specifically, our mechanisms\nfor interfacing the asynchronous GMs and SMs are organized into three key\nstages. NetRoller first harvests semantically rich and computationally\nefficient representations from the reasoning processes of LLMs using an early\nstopping mechanism, which preserves critical insights on driving context while\nmaintaining low overhead. It then applies learnable query embeddings,\nnonsensical embeddings, and positional layer embeddings to facilitate robust\nand efficient cross-modality translation. At last, it employs computationally\nefficient Query Shift and Feature Shift mechanisms to enhance the performance\nof SMs through few-epoch fine-tuning. Based on the mechanisms formalized in\nthese three stages, NetRoller enables specialized driving models to operate at\ntheir native frequencies while maintaining situational awareness of the GM.\nExperiments conducted on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that integrating GM\nthrough NetRoller significantly improves human similarity and safety in\nplanning tasks, and it also achieves noticeable precision improvements in\ndetection and mapping tasks for end-to-end autonomous driving.

    "abstract": "Recent large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive performance in\nsource-conditioned text generation but often fail to correctly provide\nfine-grained attributions for their outputs, undermining verifiability and\ntrust. Moreover, existing attribution methods do not explain how and why models\nleverage the provided source documents to generate their final responses,\nlimiting interpretability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a modular\ngeneration framework, GenerationPrograms, inspired by recent advancements in\nexecutable \"code agent\" architectures. Unlike conventional generation methods\nthat simultaneously generate outputs and attributions or rely on post-hoc\nattribution, GenerationPrograms decomposes the process into two distinct\nstages: first, creating an executable program plan composed of modular text\noperations (such as paraphrasing, compression, and fusion) explicitly tailored\nto the query, and second, executing these operations following the program's\nspecified instructions to produce the final response. Empirical evaluations\ndemonstrate that GenerationPrograms significantly improves attribution quality\nat both the document level and sentence level across two long-form\nquestion-answering tasks and a multi-document summarization task. We further\ndemonstrate that GenerationPrograms can effectively function as a post-hoc\nattribution method, outperforming traditional techniques in recovering accurate\nattributions. In addition, the interpretable programs generated by\nGenerationPrograms enable localized refinement through modular-level\nimprovements that further enhance overall attribution quality.",

While the restoration of internal symmetries has been investigated\nintensively, however, the one of spatial symmetries has only been considered\nrecently in the context of random unitary circuits. Here we present a\ncomplementary study of translation symmetry restoration in integrable systems.\nSpecifically, we consider non-interacting spinless fermions on the lattice\nprepared in non-equilibrium states invariant only under $\\nu>1$ lattice shifts\nand follow the restoration of one-site shift invariance. We do so by measuring\nthe Frobenius distance between the state on a subsystem, and its symmetrised\ncounterpart. We compute the latter exactly, using standard Gaussian methods,\nand formulate a quasiparticle picture -- involving multiplets of $\\nu$\ncorrelated quasiparticles -- to describe analytically its asymptotic behaviour.\nWe show that, differently from random unitary circuits where symmetry\nrestoration occurs abruptly for times proportional to the subsystem size, here\nsymmetry is restored smoothly and over timescales of the order of the subsystem\nsize squared.

Furthermore, we show that the\nultrafast hot-carrier contribution can coexist with the much slower\ncold-carrier contribution based on the photovoltaic effect, demonstrating that\nhot carriers can be harvested without discarding lower-energy carriers. These\nfindings highlight the potential of sub-picosecond hot-carrier extraction to\nexpand the O-E conversion bandwidth without sacrificing efficiency, bridging\nfundamental hot-carrier physics with ultrahigh-speed technological\napplications.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a model named DreamLight for universal image relighting in this\nwork, which can seamlessly composite subjects into a new background while\nmaintaining aesthetic uniformity in terms of lighting and color tone. The\nbackground can be specified by natural images (image-based relighting) or\ngenerated from unlimited text prompts (text-based relighting). Existing studies\nprimarily focus on image-based relighting, while with scant exploration into\ntext-based scenarios. Some works employ intricate disentanglement pipeline\ndesigns relying on environment maps to provide relevant information, which\ngrapples with the expensive data cost required for intrinsic decomposition and\nlight source. Other methods take this task as an image translation problem and\nperform pixel-level transformation with autoencoder architecture. While these\nmethods have achieved decent harmonization effects, they struggle to generate\nrealistic and natural light interaction effects between the foreground and\nbackground. To alleviate these challenges, we reorganize the input data into a\nunified format and leverage the semantic prior provided by the pretrained\ndiffusion model to facilitate the generation of natural results. Moreover, we\npropose a Position-Guided Light Adapter (PGLA) that condenses light information\nfrom different directions in the background into designed light query\nembeddings, and modulates the foreground with direction-biased masked\nattention. In addition, we present a post-processing module named Spectral\nForeground Fixer (SFF) to adaptively reorganize different frequency components\nof subject and relighted background, which helps enhance the consistency of\nforeground appearance. Extensive comparisons and user study demonstrate that\nour DreamLight achieves remarkable relighting performance.",

The lattice\nthermal conductivity remains quite uncertain, with theoretical and experimental\nreports varying between 218 and 1060 Wm-1K-1. It has a strong temperature\nevolution and is sensitive to strain effects and isotope concentrations. While\nthe impact of isotope scattering has been widely studied and is well\nunderstood, nuclear quantum effects and 4-phonon scattering have so far been\nneglected. Monolayer hexagonal boron nitride is composed of light elements, and\nfurther has its 3-phonon scattering phase space restricted by mirror plane\nsymmetry, so these effects may be of similar order as isotope scattering, and\nwould lead to a completely different understanding of the fundamental processes\nlimiting the lattice thermal conductivity for this system. In this work, we use\nboth classical and path-integral molecular dynamics, in conjunction with the\nTemperature Dependent Effective Potential method, to compute\ntemperature-dependent renormalized phonons including isotope scattering,\n3-phonon scattering, 4-phonon scattering and nuclear quantum effects.

Some countries promote digital tools to support reading\ndevelopment, alongside regular classroom instruction. Such tools generate rich\nlog data capturing students' behaviour and performance. This study proposes a\ndynamic cognitive diagnostic modeling (CDM) framework based on restricted\nlatent class models to trace students' time-varying skills mastery using log\nfiles from digital tools. Unlike traditional CDMs that require expert-defined\nskill-item mappings (Q-matrix), our approach jointly estimates the Q-matrix and\nlatent skill profiles, integrates log-derived covariates (e.g., reattempts,\nresponse times, counts of mastered items) and individual characteristics, and\nmodels transitions in mastery using a Bayesian estimation approach. Applied to\nreal-world data, the model demonstrates practical value in educational settings\nby effectively uncovering individual skill profiles and the skill-item\nmappings. Simulation studies confirm robust recovery of Q-matrix structures and\nlatent profiles with high accuracy under varied sample sizes, item counts and\ndifferent sparsity of Q-matrices. The framework offers a data-driven,\ntime-dependent restricted latent class modeling approach to understanding early\nreading development.",

This paper focuses on providing a comprehensive\ntheoretical characterization of asymmetric LoRA with frozen random factors.\nFirst, while existing research provides upper-bound generalization guarantees\nbased on averages over multiple experiments, the behaviour of a single\nfine-tuning run with specific random factors remains an open question.

For 29 pulsars with previously detected scattering features, our\nmeasurements of the pulse-broadening timescale are consistent with results in\nthe literature. We find that pulsars behind spiral arms show a stronger\nscattering effect due to greater density fluctuations in the arm regions. With\na properly derived dispersion measure and careful calibration, we also present\npolarization profiles for 41 pulsars in three subbands of FAST observations.",

    "abstract": "We study a two-player zero-sum game (TPZSG) in which the row player aims to\nmaximize their payoff against an adversarial column player, under an unknown\npayoff matrix estimated through bandit feedback. We propose and analyze two\nalgorithms: ETC-TPZSG, which directly applies ETC to the TPZSG setting and\nETC-TPZSG-AE, which improves upon it by incorporating an action pair\nelimination (AE) strategy that leverages the $\\varepsilon$-Nash Equilibrium\nproperty to efficiently select the optimal action pair. Our objective is to\ndemonstrate the applicability of ETC in a TPZSG setting by focusing on learning\npure strategy Nash Equilibrium. A key contribution of our work is a derivation\nof instance-dependent upper bounds on the expected regret for both algorithms,\nhas received limited attention in the literature on zero-sum games.\nParticularly, after $T$ rounds, we achieve an instance-dependent regret upper\nbounds of $O(\\Delta + \\sqrt{T})$ for ETC-TPZSG and $O(\\frac{\\log (T\n\\Delta^2)}{\\Delta})$ for ETC-TPZSG-AE, where $\\Delta$ denotes the suboptimality\ngap.

Most existing methods\ndepend on hand-crafted features, key frames like onset, apex, and offset\nframes, or deep networks limited by small-scale and low-diversity datasets. In\nthis paper, we propose an end-to-end micro-action-aware deep learning framework\nwith advantages from transformer, graph convolution, and vanilla convolution.\nIn particular, we propose a novel F5C block composed of fully-connected\nconvolution and channel correspondence convolution to directly extract\nlocal-global features from a sequence of raw frames, without the prior\nknowledge of key frames. The transformer-style fully-connected convolution is\nproposed to extract local features while maintaining global receptive fields,\nand the graph-style channel correspondence convolution is introduced to model\nthe correlations among feature patterns. Moreover, MER, optical flow\nestimation, and facial landmark detection are jointly trained by sharing the\nlocal-global features. The two latter tasks contribute to capturing facial\nsubtle action information for MER, which can alleviate the impact of\ninsufficient training data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our\nframework (i) outperforms the state-of-the-art MER methods on CASME II, SAMM,\nand SMIC benchmarks, (ii) works well for optical flow estimation and facial\nlandmark detection, and (iii) can capture facial subtle muscle actions in local\nregions associated with MEs.

Findings reveal that, while\ngeneration methods are rapidly evolving, systematic evaluation is often\noverlooked, limiting researchers ability to compare, validate, and trust\nsynthetic datasets across different domains. This systematic review underscores\nthe urgent need for robust, standardized evaluation approaches that not only\nbolster confidence in synthetic data but also guide its effective and\nresponsible implementation.

While many approaches integrate\npretrained vision-language models (VLMs) with specialized navigation\narchitectures, the fundamental question remains: can these pretrained\nembeddings alone successfully guide navigation without additional fine-tuning\nor specialized modules? We present a minimalist framework that decouples this\nquestion by training a behavior cloning policy directly on frozen\nvision-language embeddings from demonstrations collected by a privileged\nexpert. Our approach achieves a 74% success rate in navigation to\nlanguage-specified targets, compared to 100% for the state-aware expert, though\nrequiring 3.2 times more steps on average. This performance gap reveals that\npretrained embeddings effectively support basic language grounding but struggle\nwith long-horizon planning and spatial reasoning. By providing this empirical\nbaseline, we highlight both the capabilities and limitations of using\nfoundation models as drop-in representations for embodied tasks, offering\ncritical insights for robotics researchers facing practical design tradeoffs\nbetween system complexity and performance in resource-constrained scenarios.\nOur code is available at https://github.com/oadamharoon/text2nav",

The present work aims to establish a general SPH\nalgorithm for accurate and stable simulation of complex multiphase flows in\nconfigurations with open boundaries. The general scheme of weakly compressible\nSPH is adopted with special treatments implemented to ease the numerical\noscillation in the density discontinuity scenario, and the turbulent model is\nimplemented for interpretations of extreme flow conditions in high Reynolds\nnumbers. Then, the conventional open boundary condition is fine-tuned by two\nnew algorithms to guarantee the numerical stability in the inflow and the\noutflow regions. Firstly, a density relaxation is proposed to alleviate the\npressure instability in the inflow region, which improves the smoothness of the\nparticle pre-processing procedure. Secondly, the particle shifting technique\nwith adaptive damper is implemented to adjust the magnitude of correction in\nthe outflow region, which helps to suppress the velocity oscillation near the\noutlet. Validations of the proposed algorithms are carried out through four\nclassic numerical examples, presenting appealing agreements with the analytical\nsolutions and thus demonstrating the versatility in various flow conditions.\nThen, the robustness of the method is established through the turbulent\nmultiphase channel flow cases and the horizontal slug channel flow with large\ndensity ratios.

    "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown great promise but require\nsubstantial computational resources during inference. Attackers can exploit\nthis by inducing excessive output, leading to resource exhaustion and service\ndegradation. Prior energy-latency attacks aim to increase generation time by\nbroadly shifting the output token distribution away from the EOS token, but\nthey neglect the influence of token-level Part-of-Speech (POS) characteristics\non EOS and sentence-level structural patterns on output counts, limiting their\nefficacy. To address this, we propose LingoLoop, an attack designed to induce\nMLLMs to generate excessively verbose and repetitive sequences. First, we find\nthat the POS tag of a token strongly affects the likelihood of generating an\nEOS token. Based on this insight, we propose a POS-Aware Delay Mechanism to\npostpone EOS token generation by adjusting attention weights guided by POS\ninformation. Second, we identify that constraining output diversity to induce\nrepetitive loops is effective for sustained generation. We introduce a\nGenerative Path Pruning Mechanism that limits the magnitude of hidden states,\nencouraging the model to produce persistent loops. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate LingoLoop can increase generated tokens by up to 30 times and\nenergy consumption by a comparable factor on models like Qwen2.5-VL-3B,\nconsistently driving MLLMs towards their maximum generation limits. These\nfindings expose significant MLLMs' vulnerabilities, posing challenges for their\nreliable deployment. The code will be released publicly following the paper's\nacceptance.",

Challenging thermochemical properties such as\nheats of formation and total atomization energies (TAEs) are of particular\ninterest because they rigorously test the ability of computational chemistry\nmethods to accurately describe complex chemical transformations involving\nmultiple bond rearrangements. Yet, existing thermochemical datasets that\nconfidently reach this level of accuracy are limited in either size or scope.\nDatasets with highly accurate reference values include a small number of data\npoints, and larger datasets provide less accurate data or only cover a narrow\nportion of the chemical space. The existing datasets are therefore insufficient\nfor developing data-driven methods with predictive accuracy over a large\nchemical space. The Microsoft Research Accurate Chemistry Collection (MSR-ACC)\nwill address this challenge. Here, it offers the MSR-ACC/TAE25 dataset of\n76,879 total atomization energies obtained at the CCSD(T)/CBS level via the\nW1-F12 thermochemical protocol. The dataset is constructed to exhaustively\ncover chemical space for all elements up to argon by enumerating and sampling\nchemical graphs, thus avoiding bias towards any particular subspace of the\nchemical space (such as drug-like, organic, or experimentally observed\nmolecules).

These Pop III DLA\npredictions are the first to include a number of important physical effects\nsuch as Lyman-Werner (LW) feedback, reionization, and external metal enrichment\n(all of which account for three-dimensional spatial fluctuations caused by halo\nclustering). We predict the abundance of DLAs as a function of their\ncarbon-to-oxygen ratios ([C/O]). We find that our fiducial model is strongly\nruled out by the data as it contains too few high-[C/O] DLAs, which have metals\nprimarily from Pop III stars. However, increasing the delay time between Pop\nIII and metal-enriched star formation due to supernovae feedback leads to\nbetter agreement with the data. Our results suggest that DLA analogs at\n$z\\sim6$ are a promising probe of Pop III star formation for two key reasons.\nFirst, for reasonable parameter choices there are significant numbers of DLAs\nwith metals primarily originating from Pop III stars.

Furthermore, we propose a semi-automated dataset construction\nparadigm that collects user action sequences from natural interactions via RPA\ntools and then generate corresponding step and task descriptions for these\nactions with the assistance of MLLMs. This paradigm significantly reduces\nannotation time cost by a factor of over 19 times. Finally, we assess\nstate-of-the-art GUI agents using the GUI-Robust dataset, revealing their\nsubstantial performance degradation in abnormal scenarios. We anticipate that\nour work will highlight the importance of robustness in GUI agents and inspires\nmore future research in this direction.

    "abstract": "Understanding user behaviors on social media has garnered significant\nscholarly attention, enhancing our comprehension of how virtual platforms\nimpact society and empowering decision-makers. Simulating social media\nbehaviors provides a robust tool for capturing the patterns of social media\nbehaviors, testing hypotheses, and predicting the effects of various\ninterventions, ultimately contributing to a deeper understanding of social\nmedia environments. Moreover, it can overcome difficulties associated with\nutilizing real data for analysis, such as data accessibility issues, ethical\nconcerns, and the complexity of processing large and heterogeneous datasets.\nHowever, researchers and stakeholders need more flexible platforms to\ninvestigate different user behaviors by simulating different scenarios and\ncharacters, which is not possible yet. Therefore, this paper introduces\nSimSpark, an interactive system including simulation algorithms and interactive\nvisual interfaces which is capable of creating small simulated social media\nplatforms with customizable characters and social environments. We address\nthree key challenges: generating believable behaviors, validating simulation\nresults, and supporting interactive control for generation and results\nanalysis. A simulation workflow is introduced to generate believable behaviors\nof agents by utilizing large language models. A visual interface enables\nreal-time parameter adjustment and process monitoring for customizing\ngeneration settings. A set of visualizations and interactions are also designed\nto display the models' outputs for further analysis. Effectiveness is evaluated\nthrough case studies, quantitative simulation model assessments, and expert\ninterviews.",

However, existing methods often lack\nstealth, making them relatively easy to detect and remove.

Our method aims to enhance an LLM's memorization\ncapabilities on the watermarked text without altering the semantic integrity of\nthe text. As a result, the watermark is difficult to detect, blending\nseamlessly into the text with no visible markers, and is resistant to removal\ndue to its subtle, contextually appropriate substitutions that evade automated\nand manual detection. We evaluated our method using baseline datasets from\nrecent studies and seven open-source models: LLaMA-1 7B, LLaMA-3 8B, Mistral\n7B, Pythia 6.9B, as well as three smaller variants from the Pythia family\n(160M, 410M, and 1B).

Abstract Syntax\nTrees (ASTs) dominate deep learning-based code clone detection due to their\nprecise syntactic structure representation, but they inherently lack semantic\ndepth. Recent studies address this by enriching AST-based representations with\nsemantic graphs, such as Control Flow Graphs (CFGs) and Data Flow Graphs\n(DFGs). However, the effectiveness of various enriched AST-based\nrepresentations and their compatibility with different graph-based machine\nlearning techniques remains an open question, warranting further investigation\nto unlock their full potential in addressing the complexities of code clone\ndetection. In this paper, we present a comprehensive empirical study to\nrigorously evaluate the effectiveness of AST-based hybrid graph representations\nin Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based code clone detection. We systematically\ncompare various hybrid representations ((CFG, DFG, Flow-Augmented ASTs\n(FA-AST)) across multiple GNN architectures. Our experiments reveal that hybrid\nrepresentations impact GNNs differently: while AST+CFG+DFG consistently\nenhances accuracy for convolution- and attention-based models (Graph\nConvolutional Networks (GCN), Graph Attention Networks (GAT)), FA-AST\nfrequently introduces structural complexity that harms performance.

    "abstract": "Electric mobility faces several challenges, most notably the high cost of\ninfrastructure development and the underutilization of charging stations. The\nconcept of shared charging offers a promising solution. The paper explores\nsustainable urban logistics through horizontal collaboration between two fleet\noperators and addresses a scheduling problem for the shared use of charging\nstations. To tackle this, the study formulates a collaborative scheduling\nproblem as a bi-objective nonlinear integer programming model, in which each\ncompany aims to minimize its own costs, creating inherent conflicts that\nrequire trade-offs. The Balanced Bounding Box Methods (B3Ms) are introduced in\norder to efficiently derive the efficient frontier, identifying a reduced set\nof representative solutions. These methods enhance computational efficiency by\nselectively disregarding closely positioned and competing solutions, preserving\nthe diversity and representativeness of the solutions over the efficient\nfrontier. To determine the final solution and ensure balanced collaboration,\ncooperative bargaining methods are applied. Numerical case studies demonstrate\nthe viability and scalability of the developed methods, showing that the B3Ms\ncan significantly reduce computational time while maintaining the integrity of\nthe frontier. These methods, along with cooperative bargaining, provide an\neffective framework for solving various bi-objective optimization problems,\nextending beyond the collaborative scheduling problem presented here.",

However, conventional digital twins rely primarily on passive\ndata assimilation, which limits their adaptability in uncertain and dynamic\nenvironments. This paper introduces the active digital twin paradigm, based on\nactive inference. Active inference is a neuroscience-inspired, Bayesian\nframework for probabilistic reasoning and predictive modeling that unifies\ninference, decision-making, and learning under a unique, free energy\nminimization objective. By formulating the evolution of the active digital twin\nas a partially observable Markov decision process, the active inference agent\ncontinuously refines its generative model through Bayesian updates and\nforecasts future states and observations. Decision-making emerges from an\noptimization process that balances pragmatic exploitation (maximizing\ngoal-directed utility) and epistemic exploration or information gain (actively\nresolving uncertainty). Actions are dynamically planned to minimize expected\nfree energy, which quantifies both the divergence between predicted and\npreferred future observations, and the epistemic value of expected information\ngain about hidden states. This approach enables a new level of autonomy and\nresilience in digital twins, offering superior spontaneous exploration\ncapabilities.

At the first order, it is considered to be at\nhydrostatic equilibrium within the potential well. However, evidence is growing\nthat the ICM dynamics is non-negligible, is mostly turbulent in origin, and\nprovides a non-thermal pressure support to the equilibrium. In this work, we\nintend to characterise the properties of the velocity field in the ICM of a\nsimulated replica of the Virgo cluster. We first study the 3D and projected\nproperties of the ICM velocity field by computing its probability density\nfunctions (PDFs) and its statistical moments. We then estimate the non-thermal\npressure fraction from an effective turbulent Mach number, including the\nvelocity dispersion. We finally compute the velocity structure function (VSF)\nfrom projected maps of the sightline velocity. We first show that the\ncomponents of the 3D velocity field and the projected quantities along\nequivalent sightlines are anisotropic and affected by the accretion of gas from\nfilaments. Then, we compare the mean statistical moments of the 3D velocity\nfield to the mean properties of a hundred random projections. We show, in\nparticular, an almost linear relation between the standard deviation estimated\nfrom direct simulation outputs and sightline velocity dispersion projections,\ncomparable to the line broadening of X-ray atomic lines. However, this linear\nrelation does not hold between the direct simulation outputs and the standard\ndeviation of the sightline velocity projections, comparable to the line shift\nof X-ray atomic lines. We find a non-thermal pressure fraction around $6\\%$\nwithin $R_{500}$ and $9\\%$ within $R_{vir}$ from sightline velocity dispersion,\nwhich is in good agreement with direct simulation outputs.

Extensive evaluation on CIFAR-10 demonstrates that our IG-augmented\nknowledge distillation achieves 92.6% testing accuracy with a 4.1x compression\nfactor-a significant 1.1 percentage point improvement ($p<0.001$) over\nnon-distilled models (91.5%).

Well-known examples of such partial rewards include\nexplicit ratings in content recommendations, conversion signals on e-commerce\nplatforms that are partial due to delay, and the issue of censoring in medical\nproblems. One possible solution to deal with such partial rewards is to use\nsecondary rewards, such as dwelling time, clicks, and medical indicators, which\nare more densely observed. However, relying solely on such secondary rewards\ncan also lead to poor policy learning since they may not align with the target\nreward. Thus, this work studies a new and general problem of OPL where the goal\nis to learn a policy that maximizes the expected target reward by leveraging\ndensely observed secondary rewards as supplemental data. We then propose a new\nmethod called Hybrid Policy Optimization for Partially-Observed Reward (HyPeR),\nwhich effectively uses the secondary rewards in addition to the\npartially-observed target reward to achieve effective OPL despite the\nchallenging scenario. We also discuss a case where we aim to optimize not only\nthe expected target reward but also the expected secondary rewards to some\nextent; counter-intuitively, we will show that leveraging the two objectives is\nin fact advantageous also for the optimization of only the target reward. Along\nwith statistical analysis of our proposed methods, empirical evaluations on\nboth synthetic and real-world data show that HyPeR outperforms existing methods\nin various scenarios.",

However, such\nrapid pulsations are rarely reported in the hard X-ray (HXR) emission of the\nsmall solar flare. We explored the QPP patterns with fast-time variations in\nHXR and radio emissions produced in a small solar flare on 2025 January 19. By\napplying the Fast Fourier Transform, the fast-variation pulsations at a\nquasi-period of about 1 s are identified in the HXR channel of 20-80 keV, which\nwere simultaneously measured by the Hard X-ray Imager and the Konus-Wind. The\nrapid pulsations with a same quasi-period were also detected in the radio\nemission at a lower frequency range of about 40-100 MHz. The restructured HXR\nimages show that the QPP patterns mainly locate in footpoint areas that connect\nby hot plasma loops, and they appear in the flare impulsive phase. Our\nobservations suggest that the fast-variation pulsations could be associated\nwith nonthermal electrons that are periodically accelerated by the intermittent\nmagnetic reconnection, and the 1-s period may be modulated by the coalescence\ninstability between current-carrying loops and magnetic islands.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous systems are often used in changeable and unknown environments,\nwhere traditional verification may not be suitable. Runtime Verification (RV)\nchecks events performed by a system against a formal specification of its\nintended behaviour, making it highly suitable for ensuring that an autonomous\nsystem is obeying its specification at runtime. Communicating Sequential\nProcesses (CSP) is a process algebra usually used in static verification, which\ncaptures behaviour as a trace of events, making it useful for RV as well.\nFurther, CSP has more recently been used to specify autonomous and robotic\nsystems. Though CSP is supported by two extant model checkers, so far it has no\nRV tool. This paper presents Varanus, an RV tool that monitors a system against\nan oracle built from a CSP specification. This approach enables the reuse\nwithout modifications of a specification that was built, e.g during the\nsystem's design. We describe the tool, apply it to a simulated autonomous\nrobotic rover inspecting a nuclear waste store, empirically comparing its\nperformance to two other RV tools using different languages, and demonstrate\nhow it can detect violations of the specification. Varanus can synthesise a\nmonitor from a CSP process in roughly linear time, with respect to the number\nof states and transitions in the model; and checks each event in roughly\nconstant time.",

    "abstract": "Differential Evolution (DE) is a widely used evolutionary algorithm for\nblack-box optimization problems. However, in modern DE implementations, a major\nchallenge lies in the limited population diversity caused by the fixed\npopulation size enforced by the generational replacement. Population size is a\ncritical control parameter that significantly affects DE performance. Larger\npopulations inherently contain a more diverse set of individuals, thereby\nfacilitating broader exploration of the search space. Conversely, when the\nmaximum evaluation budgets is constrained, smaller populations focusing on a\nlimited number of promising candidates may be more suitable. Many\nstate-of-the-art DE variants incorporate an archive mechanism, in which a\nsubset of discarded individuals is preserved in an archive during generation\nreplacement and reused in mutation operations. However, maintaining what is\nessentially a secondary population via an archive introduces additional design\nconsiderations, such as policies for insertion, deletion, and appropriate\nsizing. To address these limitations, we propose a novel DE framework called\nUnbounded Differential Evolution (UDE), which adds all generated candidates to\nthe population without discarding any individual based on fitness. Unlike\nconventional DE, which removes inferior individuals during generational\nreplacement, UDE eliminates replacement altogether, along with the associated\ncomplexities of archive management and dynamic population sizing. UDE\nrepresents a fundamentally new approach to DE, relying solely on selection\nmechanisms and enabling a more straightforward yet powerful search algorithm.",

By\nsystematically analyzing both single-attribute imbalance and compositional\nattribute imbalance, we reveal how the rarity of attributes affects model\nperformance. To tackle these challenges, we propose adjusting the sampling\nprobability of samples based on the rarity of their compositional attributes.\nThis strategy is further integrated with various data augmentation techniques\n(such as CutMix, Fmix, and SaliencyMix) to enhance the model's ability to\nrepresent rare attributes. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate that our method effectively mitigates attribute imbalance, thereby\nimproving the robustness and fairness of deep neural networks. Our research\nhighlights the importance of modeling visual attribute distributions and\nprovides a scalable solution for long-tail image classification tasks.",

Here we present a comprehensive summary of the\nradio properties of 12 bona-fide quasi-periodic eruption sources, including a\nmix of known tidal disruption events (TDEs) and AGN-like hosts. We include a\ncombination of new dedicated radio observations and archival/previously\npublished radio observations to compile a catalogue of radio observations of\neach source in the sample. We examine the overall radio properties of the\nsample and compare to the radio properties of known TDEs, given the apparent\nlink between QPEs and TDEs. Overall we find compact, weak radio sources\nassociated with 5/12 of the QPE sources and no signatures of strong AGN\nactivity via a luminous radio jet. We find no radio variability or correlation\nbetween radio emission and the X-ray QPE properties, implying that the\nmechanism that produces the X-ray flares does not generate strong\nradio-emitting outflows. The compactness of the radio sources and lack of\ncorrelation between radio luminosity and SMBH mass is very unusual for AGN, but\nthe radio spectra and luminosities are consistent with outflows produced by a\nrecent TDE (or accretion event), in both the known TDE sources as well as the\nAGN-like sources in the sample.",

    "abstract": "In standard Reinforcement Learning (RL) settings, the interaction between the\nagent and the environment is typically modeled as a Markov Decision Process\n(MDP), which assumes that the agent observes the system state instantaneously,\nselects an action without delay, and executes it immediately. In real-world\ndynamic environments, such as cyber-physical systems, this assumption often\nbreaks down due to delays in the interaction between the agent and the system.\nThese delays can vary stochastically over time and are typically unobservable,\nmeaning they are unknown when deciding on an action. Existing methods deal with\nthis uncertainty conservatively by assuming a known fixed upper bound on the\ndelay, even if the delay is often much lower. In this work, we introduce the\ninteraction layer, a general framework that enables agents to adaptively and\nseamlessly handle unobservable and time-varying delays. Specifically, the agent\ngenerates a matrix of possible future actions to handle both unpredictable\ndelays and lost action packets sent over networks. Building on this framework,\nwe develop a model-based algorithm, Actor-Critic with Delay Adaptation (ACDA),\nwhich dynamically adjusts to delay patterns. Our method significantly\noutperforms state-of-the-art approaches across a wide range of locomotion\nbenchmark environments.",

In this work, we\nintroduce a causally faithful framework for counterfactual video generation,\nformulated as an Out-of-Distribution (OOD) prediction problem. We embed prior\ncausal knowledge by encoding the relationships specified in a causal graph into\ntext prompts and guide the generation process by optimizing these prompts using\na vision-language model (VLM)-based textual loss. This loss encourages the\nlatent space of the LDMs to capture OOD variations in the form of\ncounterfactuals, effectively steering generation toward causally meaningful\nalternatives. The proposed framework, dubbed CSVC, is agnostic to the\nunderlying video editing system and does not require access to its internal\nmechanisms or fine-tuning. We evaluate our approach using standard video\nquality metrics and counterfactual-specific criteria, such as causal\neffectiveness and minimality. Experimental results show that CSVC generates\ncausally faithful video counterfactuals within the LDM distribution via\nprompt-based causal steering, achieving state-of-the-art causal effectiveness\nwithout compromising temporal consistency or visual quality on real-world\nfacial videos. Due to its compatibility with any black-box video editing\nsystem, our framework has significant potential to generate realistic 'what if'\nhypothetical video scenarios in diverse areas such as digital media and\nhealthcare.",

Diffusion models have recently emerged as\na powerful tool for this task, combining DDIM inversion with conditional\ngeneration via classifier-free guidance (CFG).

To address this, we propose Decoupled Classifier-Free\nGuidance (DCFG), a flexible and model-agnostic framework that introduces\ngroup-wise conditioning control. DCFG builds on an attribute-split embedding\nstrategy that disentangles semantic inputs, enabling selective guidance on\nuser-defined attribute groups. For counterfactual generation, we partition\nattributes into intervened and invariant sets based on a causal graph and apply\ndistinct guidance to each. Experiments on CelebA-HQ, MIMIC-CXR, and EMBED show\nthat DCFG improves intervention fidelity, mitigates unintended changes, and\nenhances reversibility, enabling more faithful and interpretable counterfactual\nimage generation.",

    "abstract": "As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as black-box\ncomponents in real-world applications, evaluating their safety-especially under\nadversarial prompting-has become critical. Arguably, effective safety\nevaluations should be adaptive, evolving with LLM capabilities, and also cover\na broad spectrum of harmful topics and real-world scenarios to fully expose\npotential vulnerabilities. Existing manual safety benchmarks, built on\nhandcrafted adversarial prompts, are limited by their static nature and the\nintensive labor required to update them, making it difficult to keep pace with\nrapidly advancing LLMs. In contrast, automated adversarial prompt generation\noffers a promising path toward adaptive evaluation. However, current methods\noften suffer from insufficient adversarial topic coverage (topic-level\ndiversity) and weak alignment with real-world contexts. These shortcomings stem\nfrom the exploration-exploitation dilemma in black-box optimization and a lack\nof real-world contextualization, resulting in adversarial prompts that are both\ntopically narrow and scenario-repetitive. To address these issues, we propose\nReality-Oriented Safety Evaluation (ROSE), a novel framework that uses\nmulti-objective reinforcement learning to fine-tune an adversarial LLM for\ngenerating topically diverse and contextually rich adversarial prompts.\nExperiments show that ROSE outperforms existing methods in uncovering safety\nvulnerabilities in state-of-the-art LLMs, with notable improvements in\nintegrated evaluation metrics.

The components of these systems have temperatures between 6450 and\n7500 K, masses between 1.4 and 1.85 solar masses, and radii between 1.49 and\n3.05 solar radii. The residuals of these models were further analyzed using the\nFourier method to reveal the pulsational frequencies of their oscillating\ncomponents. Due to the similarity of the components of each system, the\neclipses were used as spatial filters in order to determine which member is the\npulsating star. CH Ind was found to pulsate in 46 frequencies; its primary\ncomponent is a $\\gamma$ Dor star and the secondary a $\\delta$ Sct star. The\nprimary component of V577 Oph oscillates in both the regimes of $\\gamma$ Dor\nand $\\delta$ Sct stars. Moreover, using past timings of minima, an eclipse\ntiming variation analysis was also performed for V577 Oph, resulting in the\ncalculation of the apsidal motion parameters and the existence of a third body\naround the system. Both components of CX Phe were found to be $\\delta$ Sct\nstars; its primary has three independent frequencies in the range of 14.5-17.4\nd$^{-1}$ and its secondary has two main modes of 5.19 and 7.22 d$^{-1}$. The\nanalysis of TIC 35481236 indicates the hybrid $\\delta$ Sct-$\\gamma$ Dor nature\nof its secondary component. The physical and pulsational properties of the\n$\\delta$ Sct stars of these systems were compared with those of other $\\delta$\nSct stars-members of binaries in evolutionary diagrams.",

We perform simulations with no magnetic fields, ideal\nmagnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and ambipolar diffusion, and compare the resulting\nfirst Larson cores and their associated structures, including the accretion\ndisks, their location within the larger-scale structure and the streamers\nconnecting these. We find that disks of sizes $10-100\\,{\\rm au}$ form early in\nthe simulations without magnetic fields, while there are no disks larger than\n10 au with ideal MHD. Ambipolar diffusion causes large disks to form in a\nsubset of cases (two out of six cores), and generally reduces the strength of\noutflows, which are seen to play a central role. When they are able to carry\naway significant angular momentum, they prevent the formation of a rotationally\nsupported disk. Magnetic fields strengths grow from $0.1 - 1$ mG in the\nprotostellar core to more than 10 G in the first Larson core in all simulations\nwith ideal MHD. The rotationally supported disks which form can have rotation\nspeeds $> 1$ km s$^{-1}$ even out to further than 100 au from the centre,\nbecome gravitationally unstable and form complex spiral substructures with\nToomre $Q < 1$. We conclude that the impact of magnetic fields and non-ideal\nMHD on the formation of protostellar disks is substantial in realistic\nformation scenarios from the turbulent ISM.",

    "abstract": "The distribution of consensus power is a cornerstone of decentralisation,\ninfluencing the security, resilience, and fairness of blockchain networks while\nensuring equitable impact among participants. This study provides a rigorous\nevaluation of consensus power inequality across five prominent blockchain\nnetworks - Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, Hedera, and Algorand - using data\ncollected from January 2022 to July 2024. Leveraging established economic\nmetrics, including the Gini coefficient and Theil index, the research\nquantitatively assesses how power is distributed among blockchain network\nparticipants. A robust dataset, capturing network-specific characteristics such\nas mining pools, staking patterns, and consensus nodes, forms the foundation of\nthe analysis, enabling meaningful comparisons across diverse architectures.\nThrough an in-depth comparative study, the paper identifies key disparities in\nconsensus power distribution. Hedera and Bitcoin demonstrate more balanced\npower distribution, aligning closely with the principles of decentralisation.\nEthereum and Cardano demonstrate moderate levels of inequality. However,\ncontrary to expectations, Ethereum has become more concentrated following its\ntransition to Proof-of-Stake. Meanwhile, Algorand shows a pronounced\ncentralisation of power. Moreover, the findings highlight the structural and\noperational drivers of inequality, including economic barriers, governance\nmodels, and network effects, offering actionable insights for more equitable\nnetwork design. This study establishes a methodological framework for\nevaluating blockchain consensus power inequality, emphasising the importance of\ntargeted strategies to ensure fairer power distribution and enhancing the\nsustainability of decentralised systems. Future research will build on these\nfindings by integrating additional metrics and examining the influence of\nemerging consensus mechanisms.",

In this\npaper, we propose HiLight, a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework with\nglobal adversarial guidance for large-scale TSC.

We evaluate HiLight across both\nsynthetic and real-world benchmarks, and additionally construct a large-scale\nManhattan network with diverse traffic conditions, including peak transitions,\nadverse weather, and holiday surges.

This displacement undermines the\ncritical capability of ignorance awareness, leading to undesirable behaviors\nsuch as hallucinations. To address this challenge, we introduce SEAT, a simple\nand principled fine-tuning approach that not only enables the model to\neffectively acquire new knowledge instances but also preserves its aligned\nignorance awareness. SEAT integrates two key components: (1) sparse tuning that\nconstrains activation drift, and (2) a novel entity perturbation method\ndesigned to counter knowledge entanglement.

In recent years, advancements in\nartificial intelligence have spurred the development of automatic remote\nsensing semantic segmentation methods. However, the existing semantic\nsegmentation methods focus on distinguishing spectral characteristics of\ndifferent objects while ignoring the differences in the elevation of the\ndifferent targets. This results in land cover misclassification in complex\nscenarios involving shadow occlusion and spectral confusion. In this paper, we\nintroduce a depth prompting two-dimensional (2D) remote sensing semantic\nsegmentation framework (DepthSeg). It automatically models depth/height\ninformation from 2D remote sensing images and integrates it into the semantic\nsegmentation framework to mitigate the effects of spectral confusion and shadow\nocclusion. During the feature extraction phase of DepthSeg, we introduce a\nlightweight adapter to enable cost-effective fine-tuning of the large-parameter\nvision transformer encoder pre-trained by natural images. In the depth\nprompting phase, we propose a depth prompter to model depth/height features\nexplicitly. In the semantic prediction phase, we introduce a semantic\nclassification decoder that couples the depth prompts with high-dimensional\nland-cover features, enabling accurate extraction of land-cover types.\nExperiments on the LiuZhou dataset validate the advantages of the DepthSeg\nframework in land cover mapping tasks.

As AI\nsystems increasingly shape the informational substrate upon which human\ncognition operates, they transform from passive tools into active cognitive\npartners. Building on the Extended Mind hypothesis and Heersmink's criteria for\ncognitive extension, we argue that AI systems satisfy key conditions for\ncognitive integration. These include reliability, trust, transparency,\nindividualization, and the ability to enhance and transform human mental\nfunctions. However, AI integration creates a paradox: while expanding cognitive\ncapabilities, it may simultaneously constrain thinking through sycophancy and\nbias amplification. To address these challenges, we propose seven\nevidence-based frameworks for effective human-AI cognitive integration:\nEnhanced Cognitive Scaffolding, which promotes progressive autonomy; Symbiotic\nDivision of Cognitive Labor, strategically allocating tasks based on\ncomparative strengths; Dialectical Cognitive Enhancement, countering AI\nsycophancy through productive epistemic tension; Agentic Transparency and\nControl, ensuring users understand and direct AI influence; Expertise\nDemocratization, breaking down knowledge silos; Social-Emotional Augmentation,\naddressing affective dimensions of cognitive work; and Duration-Optimized\nIntegration, managing the evolving human-AI relationship over time.

However, prior studies have shown that these models often\nincur significant computational costs due to excessive reasoning, such as\nfrequent switching between reasoning trajectories (e.g., underthinking) or\nredundant reasoning on simple questions (e.g., overthinking). In this work, we\nexpose a novel threat: adversarial inputs can be crafted to exploit excessive\nreasoning behaviors and substantially increase computational overhead without\ncompromising model utility. Therefore, we propose a novel loss framework\nconsisting of three components: (1) Priority Cross-Entropy Loss, a modification\nof the standard cross-entropy objective that emphasizes key tokens by\nleveraging the autoregressive nature of LMs; (2) Excessive Reasoning Loss,\nwhich encourages the model to initiate additional reasoning paths during\ninference; and (3) Delayed Termination Loss, which is designed to extend the\nreasoning process and defer the generation of final outputs. We optimize and\nevaluate our attack for the GSM8K and ORCA datasets on\nDeepSeek-R1-Distill-LLaMA and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen. Empirical results\ndemonstrate a 3x to 9x increase in reasoning length with comparable utility\nperformance.

Their\nfusion enables robust multiclass classification of neurological conditions.\nGrad-CAM is applied to visualize salient regions, enhancing model transparency.\nTrained on a combined dataset from BraTS 2021 and Kaggle, DGG-XNet achieved a\ntest accuracy of 91.33\\%, with precision, recall, and F1-score all exceeding\n91\\%. These results highlight DGG-XNet's potential as an effective and\ninterpretable tool for computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) of neurodegenerative and\noncological brain disorders.",

To\ntest whether this finding holds during the peak epoch of quenching, here we\npresent ALMA CO(2-1) observations of five spectroscopically confirmed\npost-starburst galaxies at z ~ 1.4 from the HeavyMetal survey. While four\ngalaxies are undetected in CO emission, we detect M_H2 ~ 10^9.7 Msun of\nmolecular gas in one system. The detected system is a close pair of massive (M*\n= 10^(11.1-11.2) Msun) post-starburst galaxies with no clear tidal features,\nlikely caught in the early stages of a major merger. These results suggest that\nmergers may be a key factor in retaining molecular gas while simultaneously\nsuppressing star formation in quenched galaxies at high redshift, possibly by\ndriving increased turbulence that decreases star formation efficiency. Unlike\nprevious studies at z < 1, we find no correlation between molecular gas mass\nand time since quenching. This may be explained by the fact that -- despite\nhaving similar UVJ colors -- all galaxies in our sample have post-burst ages\nolder than typical gas-rich quenched systems at low redshift.

Existing approaches face three key\nchallenges: 1) Excessive pre-training cost arising from multi-stage\npre-training pipelines, 2) Ineffective spatial-temporal encoding due to\nmanually split 3D rotary positional embeddings that hinder feature\ninteractions, and 3) Imprecise learning objectives in soft-label multi-instance\nretrieval, which neglect negative pair correlations. In this paper, we\nintroduce EVA02-AT, a suite of EVA02-based video-language foundation models\ntailored to egocentric video understanding tasks. EVA02-AT first efficiently\ntransfers an image-based CLIP model into a unified video encoder via a\nsingle-stage pretraining. Second, instead of applying rotary positional\nembeddings to isolated dimensions, we introduce spatial-temporal rotary\npositional embeddings along with joint attention, which can effectively encode\nboth spatial and temporal information on the entire hidden dimension. This\njoint encoding of spatial-temporal features enables the model to learn\ncross-axis relationships, which are crucial for accurately modeling motion and\ninteraction in videos. Third, focusing on multi-instance video-language\nretrieval tasks, we introduce the Symmetric Multi-Similarity (SMS) loss and a\nnovel training framework that advances all soft labels for both positive and\nnegative pairs, providing a more precise learning objective. Extensive\nexperiments on Ego4D, EPIC-Kitchens-100, and Charades-Ego under zero-shot and\nfine-tuning settings demonstrate that EVA02-AT achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance across diverse egocentric video-language tasks with fewer\nparameters.

In the noiseless ramp case, unlike the transverse\nfield XY model where DQPT always occurs for a quench crossing the single\ncritical point, there is a critical sweep velocity above which the kinks\ncorresponding to a DQPT are completely removed. Furthermore, in this case there\nare only two critical modes whose excitation probability is one-half.

A surprising result occurs when the noise intensity and\nsweep velocity are about the same order of magnitude, the number of critical\nmodes is significantly increased, signalling a region with multiple critical\nmodes.

Notably, the construction is noncommutative: interchanging\nthe matrices (i.e., considering (v,u) instead of (u,v)) can lead to\nnon-isomorphic subfactors. Focusing on the Hadamard equivalence class of the\nFourier matrix, we provide a full characterization of the resulting vertex\nmodel subfactors, along with explicit computations of their relative\ncommutants. Along the way, we conduct a detailed study of certain naturally\narising inner and outer automorphisms that play a key role in the structure of\nthese subfactors.",

    "abstract": "Ranking algorithms play a pivotal role in decision-making processes across\ndiverse domains, from search engines to job applications. When rankings\ndirectly impact individuals, ensuring fairness becomes essential, particularly\nfor groups that are marginalised or misrepresented in the data. Most of the\nexisting group fairness frameworks often rely on ensuring proportional\nrepresentation of protected groups. However, these approaches face limitations\nin accounting for the stochastic nature of ranking processes or the finite size\nof candidate pools. To this end, we present hyperFA*IR, a framework for\nassessing and enforcing fairness in rankings drawn from a finite set of\ncandidates. It relies on a generative process based on the hypergeometric\ndistribution, which models real-world scenarios by sampling without replacement\nfrom fixed group sizes. This approach improves fairness assessment when top-$k$\nselections are large relative to the pool or when protected groups are small.\nWe compare our approach to the widely used binomial model, which treats each\ndraw as independent with fixed probability, and demonstrate$-$both analytically\nand empirically$-$that our method more accurately reproduces the statistical\nproperties of sampling from a finite population. To operationalise this\nframework, we propose a Monte Carlo-based algorithm that efficiently detects\nunfair rankings by avoiding computationally expensive parameter tuning.\nFinally, we adapt our generative approach to define affirmative action policies\nby introducing weights into the sampling process.",

This work aims to develop a phenomenological approach to\nincorporate 3NF contributions into $p$-$d$ elastic scattering in free space.\nThe $p$-$d$ elastic scattering amplitude is decomposed into a 2N part,\ndescribed using 2N effective interactions, and a residual part, assumed to\nprimarily reflect 3NF contributions.

    "abstract": "Aviation training is a core link in ensuring flight safety, improving\nindustry efficiency and promoting sustainable development. It not only involves\nflight simulation but also requires the learning of a great deal of\nprofessional aviation theory knowledge. In the existing training system, the\nknowledge is mainly imparted by the the instructors. However, the number of\ninstructors is limited and the professional answers obtained from the Internet\nare not accurate enough, resulting in low training efficiency. To address this,\nwe introduced LLM, but the basic pre-trained model cannot provide accurate\nanswers to professional fields, so we fine-tuned it. Traditional Supervised\nFine-Tuning (SFT) risk generating superficially plausible but factually\nincorrect responses due to insufficient data coverage. To address this, we\nemploy Direct Preference Optimization(DPO). This paper proposes\nRetrieval-Augmented LLM Alignment via Direct Preference Optimization(RALA-DPO).\nWe select open source pre-trained LLM Qwen and adapt it to aviation theory\ntraining through DPO-based domain alignment. Simultaneously, to mitigate\nhallucinations caused by training data biases, knowledge obsolescence, or\ndomain knowledge gaps, we implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation(RAG)\ntechnology that combines generative and retrieval models. RALA-DPO effectively\nretrieves relevant information from external knowledge bases and delivers\nprecise and high-quality responses through the generative model. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that RALA-DPO can improve accuracy in response to\nprofessional aviation knowledge. With integrated RAG mechanisms, this system\ncan further improve the accuracy of answers and achieve zero-cost knowledge\nupdates simultaneously.",

By measuring the concentrations of\npathogenic materials in wastewater, WBE negates demographic biases in clinical\ntesting and healthcare demand, and may act as a leading indicator of disease\nincidence.\n  For a WBE system to be effective, it should detect the presence of a new\npathogen of concern early enough and with enough precision that it can still be\nlocalised and contained. In this study, then, we show how multiple wastewater\nsensors can be strategically placed across a wastewater system, to detect the\npresence of disease faster than if sampling was done at the wastewater\ntreatment plant only. Our approach generalises to any tree-like network and\ntakes into account the structure of the network and how the population is\ndistributed over it.\n  We show how placing sensors further upstream from the treatment plant\nimproves detection sensitivity and can inform how an outbreak is evolving in\ndifferent geographical regions. However, this improvement diminishes once\nindividual-level shedding is modelled as highly dispersed. With overdispersed\nshedding, we show using real COVID-19 cases in Scotland that broad trends in\ndisease incidence (i.e., whether the epidemic is in growth or decline) can\nstill be reasonably estimated from the wastewater signal once incidence exceeds\nabout 5 infections per day.",

A paradigmatic example consists in cyclically sheared\nsuspensions under stroboscopic observation, for which in absence of contacts\nduring a shear cycle particle trajectories are reversible and the stroboscopic\ndynamics is frozen, while contacts lead to diffusive stroboscopic motion. The\nRandom Organization Model (ROM), which is a minimal model of the transition,\nshows a transition which falls into the Conserved Directed Percolation (CDP)\nuniversality class. However, the ROM ignores hydrodynamic interactions between\nsuspended particles, which make contacts a source of long-range mechanical\nnoise that in turn can create new contacts. Here, we generalize the ROM to\ninclude long-range interactions decaying like inverse power laws of the\ndistance. Critical properties continuously depend on the decay exponent when it\nis smaller than the space dimension. Upon increasing the interaction range, the\ntransition turns convex (that is, with an order parameter exponent $\\beta >\n1$), fluctuations turn from diverging to vanishing, and hyperuniformity at the\ntransition disappears. We rationalize this critical behavior using a local\nmean-field model describing how particle contacts are created via mechanical\nnoise, showing that diffusive motion induced by long-range interactions becomes\ndominant for slowly-decaying interactions.",

However, existing methods often rely on\neither high-poly mesh modeling with post-hoc simplification or massive 3D\nGaussians, resulting in a complex pipeline or limited visual realism. In this\npaper, we demonstrate that such exhaustive modeling is unnecessary for\nachieving compelling immersive experience. We introduce ImmerseGen, a novel\nagent-guided framework for compact and photorealistic world modeling.\nImmerseGen represents scenes as hierarchical compositions of lightweight\ngeometric proxies, i.e., simplified terrain and billboard meshes, and generates\nphotorealistic appearance by synthesizing RGBA textures onto these proxies.\nSpecifically, we propose terrain-conditioned texturing for user-centric base\nworld synthesis, and RGBA asset texturing for midground and foreground scenery.\nThis reformulation offers several advantages: (i) it simplifies modeling by\nenabling agents to guide generative models in producing coherent textures that\nintegrate seamlessly with the scene; (ii) it bypasses complex geometry creation\nand decimation by directly synthesizing photorealistic textures on proxies,\npreserving visual quality without degradation; (iii) it enables compact\nrepresentations suitable for real-time rendering on mobile VR headsets. To\nautomate scene creation from text prompts, we introduce VLM-based modeling\nagents enhanced with semantic grid-based analysis for improved spatial\nreasoning and accurate asset placement. ImmerseGen further enriches scenes with\ndynamic effects and ambient audio to support multisensory immersion.\nExperiments on scene generation and live VR showcases demonstrate that\nImmerseGen achieves superior photorealism, spatial coherence and rendering\nefficiency compared to prior methods.

    "abstract": "Studying the diffuse Galactic synchrotron emission (hereafter, DGSE) at\narc-minute angular scale is important to remove the foregrounds for the\ncosmological 21-cm observations. Statistical measurements of the large-scale\nDGSE can also be used to constrain the magnetic field and the cosmic ray\nelectron density of our Galaxy's interstellar medium (ISM). Here, we have used\nthe Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) drift scan observations at $154.2 \\, {\\rm\nMHz}$ to measure the angular power spectrum $({\\cal C}_{\\ell})$ of the DGSE of\na region of the sky from right ascension (RA) $349^{\\circ}$ to $70.3^{\\circ}$\nat the fixed declination $-26.7^{\\circ}$. In this RA range, we have chosen 24\npointing centers (PCs), for which we have removed all the bright point sources\nabove $\\sim430 \\, {\\rm mJy}\\,(3\\sigma)$, and applied the Tapered Gridded\nEstimator (TGE) on residual data to estimate the ${\\cal C}_{\\ell}$. We use the\nangular multipole range $65 \\le \\ell \\le 650$ to fit the data with a model,\n${\\cal C}^M_{\\ell}=A\\times \\left(\\frac{1000}{\\ell}\\right)^{\\beta}+C$, where we\ninterpret the model as the combination of a power law $(\\propto \\ell^{-\\beta})$\nnature of the DGSE and a constant part due to the Poisson fluctuations of the\nresidual point sources. We are able to fit the model ${\\cal C}^M_{\\ell}$ for\nsix PCs centered at $\\alpha=352.5^{\\circ}, 353^{\\circ}, 357^{\\circ},\n4.5^{\\circ}, 4^{\\circ}$ and $1^{\\circ}$. We run the Markov Chain Monte Carlo\n(MCMC) ensemble sampler to get the best-fit values of the parameters $A, \\beta$\nand $C$ for these PCs. We see that the values of $A$ vary in the range $155$ to\n$400$ mK$^{2}$, whereas the $\\beta$ varies in the range $0.9$ to $1.7$. We find\nthat the value of $\\beta$ is consistent at $2-\\sigma$ level with the earlier\nmeasurement of the DGSE at similar frequency and angular scales.",

The\naim is to identify the minimal set of views that yields the most accurate 3D\nreconstruction. Instead of learning radiance fields, like NeRF or 3D Gaussian\nSplatting, from a current observation and computing uncertainty for each\ncandidate viewpoint, we introduce a novel AVS approach guided by neural\nuncertainty maps predicted by a lightweight feedforward deep neural network,\nnamed UPNet. UPNet takes a single input image of a 3D object and outputs a\npredicted uncertainty map, representing uncertainty values across all possible\ncandidate viewpoints. By leveraging heuristics derived from observing many\nnatural objects and their associated uncertainty patterns, we train UPNet to\nlearn a direct mapping from viewpoint appearance to uncertainty in the\nunderlying volumetric representations. Next, our approach aggregates all\npreviously predicted neural uncertainty maps to suppress redundant candidate\nviewpoints and effectively select the most informative one. Using these\nselected viewpoints, we train 3D neural rendering models and evaluate the\nquality of novel view synthesis against other competitive AVS methods.\nRemarkably, despite using half of the viewpoints than the upper bound, our\nmethod achieves comparable reconstruction accuracy. In addition, it\nsignificantly reduces computational overhead during AVS, achieving up to a 400\ntimes speedup along with over 50\\% reductions in CPU, RAM, and GPU usage\ncompared to baseline methods. Notably, our approach generalizes effectively to\nAVS tasks involving novel object categories, without requiring any additional\ntraining.",

This has led\nto a new quest in graph machine learning: how to build graph foundation models\ncapable of generalizing across arbitrary graphs and features? In this work, we\npresent a recipe for designing graph foundation models for node-level tasks\nfrom first principles. The key ingredient underpinning our study is a\nsystematic investigation of the symmetries that a graph foundation model must\nrespect. In a nutshell, we argue that label permutation-equivariance alongside\nfeature permutation-invariance are necessary in addition to the common node\npermutation-equivariance on each local neighborhood of the graph. To this end,\nwe first characterize the space of linear transformations that are equivariant\nto permutations of nodes and labels, and invariant to permutations of features.\nWe then prove that the resulting network is a universal approximator on\nmultisets that respect the aforementioned symmetries. Our recipe uses such\nlayers on the multiset of features induced by the local neighborhood of the\ngraph to obtain a class of graph foundation models for node property\nprediction. We validate our approach through extensive experiments on 29\nreal-world node classification datasets, demonstrating both strong zero-shot\nempirical performance and consistent improvement as the number of training\ngraphs increases.",

    "abstract": "The primary goal of bug prediction is to optimize testing efforts by focusing\non software fragments, i.e., classes, methods, commits (JIT), or lines of code,\nmost likely to be buggy. However, these predicted fragments already contain\nbugs. Thus, the current bug prediction approaches support fixing rather than\nprevention. The aim of this paper is to introduce and evaluate Ticket-Level\nPrediction (TLP), an approach to identify tickets that will introduce bugs once\nimplemented. We analyze TLP at three temporal points, each point represents a\nticket lifecycle stage: Open, In Progress, or Closed. We conjecture that: (1)\nTLP accuracy increases as tickets progress towards the closed stage due to\nimproved feature reliability over time, and (2) the predictive power of\nfeatures changes across these temporal points. Our TLP approach leverages 72\nfeatures belonging to six different families: code, developer, external\ntemperature, internal temperature, intrinsic, ticket to tickets, and JIT. Our\nTLP evaluation uses a sliding-window approach, balancing feature selection and\nthree machine-learning bug prediction classifiers on about 10,000 tickets of\ntwo Apache open-source projects. Our results show that TLP accuracy increases\nwith proximity, confirming the expected trade-off between early prediction and\naccuracy. Regarding the prediction power of feature families, no single feature\nfamily dominates across stages; developer-centric signals are most informative\nearly, whereas code and JIT metrics prevail near closure, and temperature-based\nfeatures provide complementary value throughout. Our findings complement and\nextend the literature on bug prediction at the class, method, or commit level\nby showing that defect prediction can be effectively moved upstream, offering\nopportunities for risk-aware ticket triaging and developer assignment before\nany code is written.",

While the automated drilling feature of ID substantially\nreduces noise within drilling data streams, data cleaning remains essential for\nremoving anomalies to enable accurate strata classification and prediction of\nsoil and rock properties. This study employed three machine learning\nalgorithms--IsoForest, one-class SVM, and DBSCAN--to automate the data cleaning\nprocess for ID data in rock drilling scenarios. Two data cleaning contexts were\nexamined: (1) removing anomalies in rock drilling data, and (2) removing both\nanomalies and soil drilling data in mixed rock drilling data. The analysis\nrevealed that all three machine learning algorithms outperformed traditional\nstatistical methods (the 3-sigma rule and IQR method) in both data cleaning\ntasks, achieving a good balance between true positive rate and false positive\nrate, though hyperparameter tuning was required for one-class SVM and DBSCAN.\nAmong them, IsoForest was proven to be the best-performing algorithm, capable\nof removing anomalies effectively without the need for hyperparameter\nadjustment. Furthermore, IsoForest, combined with two-cluster K-means,\nsuccessfully eliminated both soil drilling data and anomalies while preserving\nalmost all the normal data.

We present extensive\nresults on billion-scale LLMs (Llama and Qwen series) going way beyond the\nscale of existing applications of IVON. For example, we finetune a Llama-3.2-3B\nmodel on a set of commonsense reasoning tasks and improve accuracy over AdamW\nby 1.3% and reduce ECE by 5.4%, outperforming AdamW and other recent Bayesian\nmethods like Laplace-LoRA and BLoB.

These challenges are particularly pronounced when attempting\ndynamic motion or operating in environments with irregular terrain. To address\nthis challenge, this manuscript proposes a whole-body control framework for\nhumanoid robots with heavy limbs, using a model-based approach that combines a\nkino-dynamics planner and a hierarchical optimization problem. The\nkino-dynamics planner is designed as a model predictive control (MPC) scheme to\naccount for the impact of heavy limbs on mass and inertia distribution. By\nsimplifying the robot's system dynamics and constraints, the planner enables\nreal-time planning of motion and contact forces. The hierarchical optimization\nproblem is formulated using Hierarchical Quadratic Programming (HQP) to\nminimize limb control errors and ensure compliance with the policy generated by\nthe kino-dynamics planner. Experimental validation of the proposed framework\ndemonstrates its effectiveness. The humanoid robot with heavy limbs controlled\nby the proposed framework can achieve dynamic walking speeds of up to 1.2~m/s,\nrespond to external disturbances of up to 60~N, and maintain balance on\nchallenging terrains such as uneven surfaces, and outdoor environments.",

    "abstract": "The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC-AGI) presents a formidable\nchallenge for AI systems. Despite the typically low performance on ARC, the\ndeep learning paradigm remains the most effective known strategy for generating\nskillful (state-of-the-art) neural networks (NN) across varied modalities and\ntasks in vision, language etc. The deep learning paradigm has proven to be able\nto train these skillful neural networks and learn the abstractions needed in\nthese diverse domains. Our work doubles down on that and continues to leverage\nthis paradigm by incorporating on-the-fly NN training at test time. We\ndemonstrate that fully committing to deep learning's capacity to acquire novel\nabstractions yields state-of-the-art performance on ARC. Specifically, we treat\nboth the neural network and the optimizer (rather than just a pre-trained\nnetwork) as integral components of the inference process, fostering\ngeneralization to unseen tasks. Concretely, we propose a methodology for\ntraining on ARC, starting from pretrained LLMs, and enhancing their ARC\nreasoning. We also propose Test-Time Fine-Tuning (TTFT) and the Augment\nInference Reverse-Augmentation and Vote (AIRV) as effective test-time\ntechniques. We are the first to propose and show deep learning can be used\neffectively for ARC, showing boosts of up to 260% in accuracy with AIRV and a\nfurther 300% boost with TTFT. An early version of this approach secured first\nplace in the 2023 ARCathon competition, while the final version achieved the\ncurrent best score on the ARC private test-set (58%).

Motivated\nby this, we simultaneously study the dynamics of background evolution and\nstructure formation in an abstract phase space of dynamical quantities $x=H_0\nD_A/c$, $p = dx/dz$, and $f_8$. We adopt a semi-cosmographic approach, whereby\nwe do not pre-assume any specific dark energy model to integrate the dynamical\nsystem.

Our\ndatasets enjoy high scene diversity, ranging from indoor and urban settings to\nnatural and dynamic outdoor scenes. To automate annotation, we design an\nautomatic labeling pipeline, which subtly coordinates pre-trained 2D segmentors\nand large language models to facilitate the labeling. The pipeline operates in\nthree novel stages. Specifically, in the Initial Annotation Phase, we introduce\na Semantic- and Distortion-aware Refinement module, which combines object mask\nproposals from multiple 2D segmentors with LLM-verified semantic labels. These\nare then converted into mask prompts to guide SAM2 in generating\ndistortion-aware masks for subsequent frames. In the Auto-Refine Annotation\nPhase, missing or incomplete regions are corrected either by applying the SDR\nagain or resolving the discontinuities near the horizontal borders. The Manual\nRevision Phase finally incorporates LLMs and human annotators to further refine\nand validate the annotations.

However, enhancing the computational\ndensity of on-chip optical systems remains a significant challenge, primarily\ndue to the difficulties in miniaturizing and integrating key optical\ninterference components.In this work, we harness the potential of\nfabrication-constrained scattering optical computing within nanophotonic media\nto address these limitations.Central to our approach is the use of\nfabrication-aware inverse design techniques, which enable the realization of\nmanufacturable on-chip scattering structures under practical constraints.This\nresults in an ultra-compact optical neural computing architecture with an area\nof just 64 um2,representing a remarkable three orders of magnitude reduction in\nfootprint compared to traditional optical neural networks. Our prototype,\ntested on the Iris flower dataset, achieved an experimental accuracy of 86.7%,\nclosely matching the simulation benchmark.This breakthrough showcases a\npromising pathway toward ultra-dense, energy-efficient optical processors for\nscalable machine learning inference, significantly reducing both the hardware\nfootprint, latency, and power consumption of next-generation AI applications.",

To this end, we conducted a large-scale\nsurvey with over 1,000 participants. Overall, cybernetic avatars received a\nhigh level of acceptance, with physical robot avatars receiving higher\nacceptance than digital avatars. In terms of appearance, robot avatars with a\nhighly anthropomorphic robotic appearance were the most accepted, followed by\ncartoonish designs and androids. Animal-like appearances received the lowest\nlevel of acceptance. Among the tasks, providing information and guidance was\nrated as the most valued.

Here, we show\nthat all such adaptation methods can be seen as different ways of `correcting'\nthe approximate posteriors. More accurate posteriors lead to smaller\ncorrections, which in turn imply quicker adaptation. The result is obtained by\nusing a dual-perspective of the Bayesian Learning Rule of Khan and Rue (2023)\nwhere interference created during adaptation is characterized by the\nnatural-gradient mismatch over the past data.

To study this, we\nintroduce RL-Obfuscation, in which LLMs are finetuned via reinforcement\nlearning to bypass latent-space monitors while maintaining coherent\ngenerations. We apply RL-Obfuscation to LLMs ranging from 7B to 14B parameters\nand evaluate evasion success against a suite of monitors. We find that\ntoken-level latent-space monitors are highly vulnerable to this attack. More\nholistic monitors, such as max-pooling or attention-based probes, remain\nrobust. Moreover, we show that adversarial policies trained to evade a single\nstatic monitor generalise to unseen monitors of the same type.

Rather than detecting only abrupt step changes, it is crucial to\nmonitor and characterize these drift patterns. Despite its practical\nimportance, the problem of drift monitoring in image sequences has received\nlimited attention. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a novel drift\nmonitoring method based on an oblique-axis regression tree. It is particularly\neffective for monitoring drift patterns in the jump location curves present in\nthe image intensity functions. By leveraging a decision tree framework, the\nmethod captures discontinuities both in spatial image intensity and temporal\nprogression. A key advantage of this method lies in its flexibility: in the\nabsence of drift, it remains capable of detecting abrupt step changes.\nTheoretical properties and numerical performance in diverse types of simulation\nsettings indicate its broad applicability.",

One is\ncomposing the unitary operators of a few qubits to achieve general unitary\noperators on an arbitrary number of qubits, known as the approach of quantum\ncircuits. The other one focuses on preparing quantum cluster states and\nperforming the computation by measuring the states with a particular basis,\nknown as measurement-based quantum computing or one-way quantum computing. The\ntwo strategies have been proven to be equivalent to each other. This note aims\nto discuss the strategies for computing the local projections on square-lattice\ncluster states.

However, a critical paradox clouds its efficacy: RLVR-tuned\nmodels often underperform their base models on the $Pass@K$ metric for\nsolution-finding, leading to the hypothesis that RLVR merely re-weights\nexisting reasoning paths at the cost of reasoning diversity. In this work, we\nresolve this contradiction by identifying the source of the problem: the\n$Pass@K$ metric itself is a flawed measure of reasoning, as it credits correct\nfinal answers that probably arise from inaccurate or incomplete chains of\nthought (CoTs). To address this, we introduce a more precise evaluation metric,\n$CoT$-$Pass@K$, which mandates that both the reasoning path and the final\nanswer be correct. We provide a new theoretical foundation that formalizes how\nRLVR, unlike traditional RL, is uniquely structured to incentivize logical\nintegrity. Our empirical results are supportive: using $CoT$-$Pass@K$, we\nobserve that RLVR can incentivize the generalization of correct reasoning for\nall values of $K$. Furthermore, by analyzing the training dynamics, we find\nthat this enhanced reasoning capability emerges early in the training process\nand smoothly generalizes.

    "abstract": "3D visual grounding (3DVG) is a critical task in scene understanding that\naims to identify objects in 3D scenes based on text descriptions. However,\nexisting methods rely on separately pre-trained vision and text encoders,\nresulting in a significant gap between the two modalities in terms of spatial\ngeometry and semantic categories. This discrepancy often causes errors in\nobject positioning and classification. The paper proposes UniSpace-3D, which\ninnovatively introduces a unified representation space for 3DVG, effectively\nbridging the gap between visual and textual features. Specifically, UniSpace-3D\nincorporates three innovative designs: i) a unified representation encoder that\nleverages the pre-trained CLIP model to map visual and textual features into a\nunified representation space, effectively bridging the gap between the two\nmodalities; ii) a multi-modal contrastive learning module that further reduces\nthe modality gap; iii) a language-guided query selection module that utilizes\nthe positional and semantic information to identify object candidate points\naligned with textual descriptions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nUniSpace-3D outperforms baseline models by at least 2.24% on the ScanRefer and\nNr3D/Sr3D datasets. The code will be made available upon acceptance of the\npaper.",

In contrast, expert problem solvers - such as Olympiad or\nprogramming contest teams - leverage a rich tapestry of experiences: absorbing\nmentorship from coaches, developing intuition from past problems, leveraging\nknowledge of tool usage and library functionality, adapting strategies based on\nthe expertise and experiences of peers, continuously refining their reasoning\nthrough trial and error, and learning from other related problems even during\ncompetition. We introduce Xolver, a training-free multi-agent reasoning\nframework that equips a black-box LLM with a persistent, evolving memory of\nholistic experience. Xolver integrates diverse experience modalities, including\nexternal and self-retrieval, tool use, collaborative interactions, agent-driven\nevaluation, and iterative refinement. By learning from relevant strategies,\ncode fragments, and abstract reasoning patterns at inference time, Xolver\navoids generating solutions from scratch - marking a transition from isolated\ninference toward experience-aware language agents. Built on both open-weight\nand proprietary models, Xolver consistently outperforms specialized reasoning\nagents. Even with lightweight backbones (e.g., QWQ-32B), it often surpasses\nadvanced models including Qwen3-235B, Gemini 2.5 Pro, o3, and o4-mini-high.\nWith o3-mini-high, it achieves new best results on GSM8K (98.1%), AIME'24\n(94.4%), AIME'25 (93.7%), Math-500 (99.8%), and LiveCodeBench-V5 (91.6%) -\nhighlighting holistic experience learning as a key step toward generalist\nagents capable of expert-level reasoning.

In contrast, some companies keep on with their DEI strategy,\nat least so far, despite the challenging political climate.

To address these\nchallenges in the retail domain, we propose a deep learning-based approach that\nautomates key-frame identification in retail videos and provides automatic\nannotations of products and customers. Our method leverages deep neural\nnetworks to learn discriminative features by embedding video frames and\nincorporating object detection-based techniques tailored for retail\nenvironments. Experimental results showcase the superiority of our approach\nover traditional methods, achieving accuracy comparable to human annotator\nlabeling while enhancing the overall efficiency of retail video annotation.\nRemarkably, our approach leads to an average of 2 times cost savings in video\nannotation. By allowing human annotators to verify/adjust less than 5% of\ndetected frames in the video dataset, while automating the annotation process\nfor the remaining frames without reducing annotation quality, retailers can\nsignificantly reduce operational costs. The automation of key-frame detection\nenables substantial time and effort savings in retail video labeling tasks,\nproving highly valuable for diverse retail applications such as shopper journey\nanalysis, product interaction detection, and in-store security monitoring.",

Temperature profiles of accretion disks\nare known to be diagnostic of many of the physical properties of AGNs and\nquasars. Methods: Our approach involves application of the photometric\nreverberation mapping to the light curves of SBS 1520+530 obtained in the\nJohnson-Cousins V and R filters. The RM method implies that the time shift\nbetween the light curves taken in different spectral ranges determines the\nlight travel time between the AD zones with different physical conditions. In\ndetermining the time shifts, we applied a method based on some useful\nproperties of the orthogonal polynomials. Results: The variations in filter R\nlag those in filter V , with 1.25$\\pm$ 0.63 days for the inter-band time shift\naveraged between the two image components and over the three seasons. The\nobtained time lag noticeably exceeds the value following for SBS 1520+530 from\nthe classical model of optically thick geometrically thin AD. We considered two\npossible ways to resolve the discrepancy between the theory and observations.\nThe first assumes an AD temperature profile flatter than the classical one. The\nsecond way is to consider an extended optically thick scattering envelope\noriginated due to matter outflow from an AD interior. Conclusion: Both\nexplanations may be consequences of the super-Eddington accretion in SBS\n1520+530. Using bolometric luminosity estimates available for SBS 1520+530 from\nthe literature, we obtained a value of $\\approx$ 3.4 for the Eddington ratio,\nwhich indeed indicates a moderately super-Eddington accretion regime.",

Typically, these filters are learned under the supervision of\ndownstream tasks, enabling SGNNs to adapt to diverse structural patterns.\nHowever, in scenarios with limited labeled data, SGNNs often struggle to\ncapture the optimal filter shapes, resulting in degraded performance,\nespecially on graphs with heterophily. Meanwhile, the rapid progress of Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) has opened new possibilities for enhancing graph\nlearning without modifying graph structure or requiring task-specific training.\nIn this work, we propose a novel framework that leverages LLMs to estimate the\nhomophily level of a graph and uses this global structural prior to guide the\nconstruction of spectral filters. Specifically, we design a lightweight and\nplug-and-play pipeline where a small set of labeled node pairs is formatted as\nnatural language prompts for the LLM, which then predicts the graph's homophily\nratio. This estimated value informs the spectral filter basis, enabling SGNNs\nto adapt more effectively to both homophilic and heterophilic structures.\nExtensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our\nLLM-assisted spectral framework consistently improves performance over strong\nSGNN baselines.

    "abstract": "In the era of digitalization, as individuals increasingly rely on digital\nplatforms for communication and news consumption, various actors employ\nlinguistic strategies to influence public perception. While models have become\nproficient at detecting explicit patterns, which typically appear in texts as\nsingle remarks referred to as utterances, such as social media posts, malicious\nactors have shifted toward utilizing implicit influential verbal patterns\nembedded within conversations. These verbal patterns aim to mentally penetrate\nthe victim's mind in order to influence them, enabling the actor to obtain the\ndesired information through implicit means. This paper presents an improved\napproach for detecting such implicit influential patterns. Furthermore, the\nproposed model is capable of identifying the specific locations of these\ninfluential elements within a conversation. To achieve this, the existing\ndataset was augmented using the reasoning capabilities of state-of-the-art\nlanguage models. Our designed framework resulted in a 6% improvement in the\ndetection of implicit influential patterns in conversations. Moreover, this\napproach improved the multi-label classification tasks related to both the\ntechniques used for influence and the vulnerability of victims by 33% and 43%,\nrespectively.",

We present recent\nresults from our ongoing survey of near-infrared polarimetric properties of\nasteroids. Our data reveal a mineralogical link between asteroids in the\nbroader M- and K- spectral classes. In particular, M-type objects (16) Psyche,\n(55) Pandora, (135) Hertha, and (216) Kleopatra show the same\npolarimetric-phase behavior as K-type objects (89) Julia, (221) Eos, and (233)\nAsterope from visible through near-infrared light. The near-infrared behavior\nfor these objects is distinct from other classes observed to date, and shows a\ngood match to the polarimetric properties of M-type asteroid (21) Lutetia from\nthe visible to the near-infrared. The best link for these objects from\nlaboratory polarimetric phase curve measurements is to a troilite-rich\nfine-grained regolith. Our observations indicate that the M- and K-type\nspectral classes are most likely part of a continuum, with the observed\nspectral differences due to heterogeneity from partial differentiation, shock\ndarkening of the surface material, or other later evolution of the original\nparent population.

However, traditional VMC methods only optimize the wave function in\nregions of peak probability. The wave function is uncontrolled in the tails of\nthe probability distribution, which can limit the accuracy of the trained\nwavefunction approximation. To improve the approximation accuracy in the\nprobability tails, this paper interprets VMC as a gradient flow in the space of\nwave functions, followed by a projection step. From this perspective, arbitrary\nprobability distributions can be used in the projection step, allowing the user\nto prioritize accuracy in different regions of state space. Motivated by this\ntheoretical perspective, the paper tests a new weighted VMC method on the\nantiferromagnetic Heisenberg model for a periodic spin chain. Compared to\ntraditional VMC, weighted VMC reduces the error in the ground state energy by a\nfactor of 2 and it reduces the errors in the local energies away from the mode\nby large factors of $10^2$--$10^4$.",

    "abstract": "Egocentric human-object interaction (Ego-HOI) detection is crucial for\nintelligent agents to understand and assist human activities from a\nfirst-person perspective. However, progress has been hindered by the lack of\nbenchmarks and methods tailored to egocentric challenges such as severe\nhand-object occlusion. In this paper, we introduce the real-world Ego-HOI\ndetection task and the accompanying Ego-HOIBench, a new dataset with over 27K\negocentric images and explicit, fine-grained hand-verb-object triplet\nannotations across 123 categories. Ego-HOIBench covers diverse daily scenarios,\nobject types, and both single- and two-hand interactions, offering a\ncomprehensive testbed for Ego-HOI research. Benchmarking existing third-person\nHOI detectors on Ego-HOIBench reveals significant performance gaps,\nhighlighting the need for egocentric-specific solutions. To this end, we\npropose Hand Geometry and Interactivity Refinement (HGIR), a lightweight,\nplug-and-play scheme that leverages hand pose and geometric cues to enhance\ninteraction representations. Specifically, HGIR explicitly extracts global hand\ngeometric features from the estimated hand pose proposals, and further refines\ninteraction features through pose-interaction attention, enabling the model to\nfocus on subtle hand-object relationship differences even under severe\nocclusion.

Much insight has been gained by the study of\nmulti-component FQH states, where spin and pseudospin indices of the electron\ncontribute additional correlation. Traditional multi-component FQH states\ndevelop in situations where the components share the same orbital states and\nthe resulting interactions are pseudospin independent; this homo-orbital nature\nwas also crucial to their theoretical understanding. Here, we study\n\"hetero-orbital\" two-component FQH states, in which the orbital index is part\nof the pseudospin, rendering the multi-component interactions strongly SU(2)\nanisotropic in the pseudospin space. Such states, obtained in bilayer graphene\nat the isospin transition between N = 0 and N = 1 electron Landau levels, are\nmarkedly different from previous homo-orbital two-component FQH states. In\nparticular, we observe strikingly different behaviors for the parallel-flux and\nreverse-flux composite fermion states, and an anomalously strong two-component\n2/5 state over a wide range of magnetic field before it abruptly disappears at\na high field. Our findings, combined with detailed theoretical calculations,\nreveal the surprising robustness of the hetero-orbital FQH effects,\nsignificantly enriching our understanding of FQH physics in this novel regime.",

This paper tackles the challenge of downlink spatial reuse in Wi-Fi\nnetworks, specifically in scenarios involving overlapping basic service sets,\nby employing hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning (HMARL). We\ndecompose the CSR process into two phases, i.e., a polling phase and a decision\nphase, and introduce the HMARL algorithm to enable efficient CSR. To enhance\ntraining efficiency, the proposed HMARL algorithm employs a hierarchical\nstructure, where station selection and power control are determined by a high-\nand low-level policy network, respectively. Simulation results demonstrate that\nthis approach consistently outperforms baseline methods in terms of throughput\nand latency across various network topologies. Moreover, the algorithm exhibits\nrobust performance when coexisting with legacy APs. Additional experiments in a\nrepresentative topology further reveal that the carefully designed reward\nfunction not only maximizes the overall network throughput, but also improves\nfairness in transmission opportunities for APs in high-interference regions.",

The analytical form\nof the difference between the travel times of a relativistic massive particle\nand a light signal in this geometry, as well as that of two relativistic\nmassive particles, is thus obtained in the weak-field and slow-motion limit.\nThe influence of the radial lens motion on the leading-order Schwarzschild time\ndelay of relativistic massive particles is then discussed. It is found that in\nthe slow-motion limit, the radial lens motion towards the observer decreases\nthe flight time of an ultrarelativistic massive particle, when compared with\nthe case of no translational motion of the central body. Conversely, if the\nlens gets away from the detector radially under the same conditions, the\npropagation process of the particle will slow down and its flight time will\nthus increase in comparison with the Schwarzschild case.

This leads to a modification of the dark energy\nterm in the Friedmann equation, which then scales with the Hubble parameter as\n$\\rho_{\\rm DE}(t) \\propto H(t)$ when dark energy dominates the expansion of the\nUniverse. The QCD scale, $\\Lambda_{\\rm QCD} \\sim 100~{\\rm MeV}$, naturally sets\nthe energy density of DE and provides a compelling explanation for why its\nimpact on cosmic expansion becomes significant only in the recent cosmological\nepoch. Importantly, the entire framework is grounded in Standard Model (SM)\nphysics, involving no new fields or coupling constants. Key predictions of the\nmodel include: (a) A present-day DE equation of state $w_{\\rm DE} > -1$,\nasymptotically approaching the de Sitter limit $w_{\\rm DE} = -1$ in the future,\nwith the corresponding asymptotic Hubble constant $\\overline{H}$ set by\n$\\Lambda_{\\rm QCD}$. (b) At redshifts $z \\ge 0$, $w_{\\rm DE}$ can lie above or\nbelow $-1$ and may cross this boundary multiple times, behavior qualitatively\nconsistent with recent DESI observations. (c) The solution to the Friedmann\nequation in this framework can deviate from the canonical $\\Lambda$CDM form at\n$z \\ge 0$. (d) If such deviation occurs, it can be tested using cosmological\nobservations, CMB anisotropies, BAO, SNIa, and large-scale structure, which we\npropose to explore in future work.

    "abstract": "Online surgical phase recognition has drawn great attention most recently due\nto its potential downstream applications closely related to human life and\nhealth. Despite deep models have made significant advances in capturing the\ndiscriminative long-term dependency of surgical videos to achieve improved\nrecognition, they rarely account for exploring and modeling the uncertainty in\nsurgical videos, which should be crucial for reliable online surgical phase\nrecognition. We categorize the sources of uncertainty into two types, frame\nambiguity in videos and unbalanced distribution among surgical phases, which\nare inevitable in surgical videos. To address this pivot issue, we introduce a\nmeta-learning-optimized classification diffusion model (Meta-SurDiff), to take\nfull advantage of the deep generative model and meta-learning in achieving\nprecise frame-level distribution estimation for reliable online surgical phase\nrecognition. For coarse recognition caused by ambiguous video frames, we employ\na classification diffusion model to assess the confidence of recognition\nresults at a finer-grained frame-level instance. For coarse recognition caused\nby unbalanced phase distribution, we use a meta-learning based objective to\nlearn the diffusion model, thus enhancing the robustness of classification\nboundaries for different surgical phases.We establish effectiveness of\nMeta-SurDiff in online surgical phase recognition through extensive experiments\non five widely used datasets using more than four practical metrics. The\ndatasets include Cholec80, AutoLaparo, M2Cai16, OphNet, and NurViD, where\nOphNet comes from ophthalmic surgeries, NurViD is the daily care dataset, while\nthe others come from laparoscopic surgeries.

    "abstract": "Egocentric pose estimation is a fundamental capability for multi-robot\ncollaborative perception in connected autonomy, such as connected autonomous\nvehicles. During multi-robot operations, a robot needs to know the relative\npose between itself and its teammates with respect to its own coordinates.\nHowever, different robots usually observe completely different views that\ncontains similar objects, which leads to wrong pose estimation. In addition, it\nis unrealistic to allow robots to share their raw observations to detect\noverlap due to the limited communication bandwidth constraint. In this paper,\nwe introduce a novel method for Non-Overlap-Aware Egocentric Pose Estimation\n(NOPE), which performs egocentric pose estimation in a multi-robot team while\nidentifying the non-overlap views and satifying the communication bandwidth\nconstraint. NOPE is built upon an unified hierarchical learning framework that\nintegrates two levels of robot learning: (1) high-level deep graph matching for\ncorrespondence identification, which allows to identify if two views are\noverlapping or not, (2) low-level position-aware cross-attention graph learning\nfor egocentric pose estimation. To evaluate NOPE, we conduct extensive\nexperiments in both high-fidelity simulation and real-world scenarios.\nExperimental results have demonstrated that NOPE enables the novel capability\nfor non-overlapping-aware egocentric pose estimation and achieves state-of-art\nperformance compared with the existing methods.

    "abstract": "Scene graphs have emerged as a powerful tool for robots, providing a\nstructured representation of spatial and semantic relationships for advanced\ntask planning. Despite their potential, conventional 3D indoor scene graphs\nface critical limitations, particularly under- and over-segmentation of room\nlayers in structurally complex environments. Under-segmentation misclassifies\nnon-traversable areas as part of a room, often in open spaces, while\nover-segmentation fragments a single room into overlapping segments in complex\nenvironments. These issues stem from naive voxel-based map representations that\nrely solely on geometric proximity, disregarding the structural constraints of\ntraversable spaces and resulting in inconsistent room layers within scene\ngraphs. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to tackle\nsegmentation inconsistency as a challenge and address it with\nTraversability-Aware Consistent Scene Graphs (TACS-Graphs), a novel framework\nthat integrates ground robot traversability with room segmentation. By\nleveraging traversability as a key factor in defining room boundaries, the\nproposed method achieves a more semantically meaningful and topologically\ncoherent segmentation, effectively mitigating the inaccuracies of voxel-based\nscene graph approaches in complex environments. Furthermore, the enhanced\nsegmentation consistency improves loop closure detection efficiency in the\nproposed Consistent Scene Graph-leveraging Loop Closure Detection (CoSG-LCD)\nleading to higher pose estimation accuracy.

Finally, an\nEvidence Reasoning (ER) rule is introduced to fuse the output results of each\nmodality and make decisions, thereby completing the quantification of fish\nfeeding intensity. The experimental results show that the constructed MAINet\nreaches 96.76%, 96.78%, 96.79% and 96.79% in accuracy, precision, recall and\nF1-Score respectively, and its performance is significantly higher than the\ncomparison models. Compared with models that adopt single-modality,\ndual-modality fusion and different decision-making fusion methods, it also has\nobvious advantages. Meanwhile, the ablation experiments further verified the\nkey role of the proposed improvement strategy in improving the robustness and\nfeature utilization efficiency of model, which can effectively improve the\naccuracy of the quantitative results of fish feeding intensity.",

One approach is to fault-tolerantly prepare a magic state in one code\nand then switch to another, a method known as code switching. We experimentally\ndemonstrate this protocol on an ion-trap quantum processor, yielding a logical\nmagic state encoded in an error-correcting code with state-of-the-art logical\nfidelity. Our experiment is based on the first demonstration of code-switching\nbetween color codes, from the fifteen-qubit quantum Reed-Muller code to the\nseven-qubit Steane code. We prepare an encoded magic state in the Steane code\nwith $82.58\\%$ probability, with an infidelity of at most $5.1(2.7) \\times\n10^{-4}$. The reported infidelity is lower than the leading infidelity of the\nphysical operations utilized in the protocol by a factor of at least $2.7$,\nindicating the quantum processor is below the pseudo-threshold. Furthermore, we\ncreate two copies of the magic state in the same quantum processor and perform\na logical Bell basis measurement for a sample-efficient certification of the\nencoded magic state. The high-fidelity magic state can be combined with the\nalready-demonstrated fault-tolerant Clifford gates, state preparation, and\nmeasurement of the 2D color code, completing a universal set of fault-tolerant\ncomputational primitives with logical error rates equal or better than the\nphysical two-qubit error rate.",

    "abstract": "Learning an energy-based model (EBM) in the latent space of a top-down\ngenerative model offers an expressive and interpretable framework for text and\nimage generation. However, it remains unclear how this interpretability can be\nused to guide model design, improve generative quality, and reduce training\ntime. Moreover, the reliance on Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC) sampling presents\nchallenges in efficiency and sampling multimodal latent distributions. In this\nwork, we propose a novel adaptation of the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation\ntheorem for generative modeling and introduce the Thermodynamic\nKolmogorov-Arnold Model (T-KAM) to take advantage of structural and inductive\nbiases. By constraining the prior to univariate relationships, T-KAM enables\nfast and exact inference via the inverse transform method. With the low\ndimensionality of the latent space and suitable inductive biases encoded, we\ndemonstrate that importance sampling becomes a viable, unbiased, and highly\nefficient training strategy. We also introduce a training criterion using\npopulation-based LMC, which decomposes posterior sampling into a sequence of\nannealed distributions to improve multimodal exploration. T-KAM elegantly\nbalances common trade-offs in generative modeling, offering fast inference,\nhigh sample quality, and stable training, while being naturally suited to\nupcoming Zettascale Computing Co. hardware and extendable to other high-impact\nresearch directions in generative intelligence.",

This paper proposes a novel gripper, Lasso Gripper.\nInspired by traditional tools like the lasso and the uurga, Lasso Gripper\ncaptures objects by launching and retracting a string. Contrary to antipodal\ngrippers, which concentrate force on a limited area, Lasso Gripper applies\nuniform pressure along the length of the string for a more gentle grasp. The\ngripper is controlled by four motors-two for launching the string inward and\ntwo for launching it outward.

To address the\nissue of string tangling during rapid retraction, a specialized mechanism was\nincorporated. Additionally, a dynamic model was developed to estimate the\nstring's curve, providing a foundation for the kinematic analysis of the\nworkspace.

    "abstract": "Recent research has attempted to associate preference optimization (PO)\nperformance with the underlying preference datasets. In this work, our\nobservation is that the differences between the preferred response $y^+$ and\ndispreferred response $y^-$ influence what LLMs can learn, which may not match\nthe desirable differences to learn. Therefore, we use distance and reward\nmargin to quantify these differences, and combine them to get Distance\nCalibrated Reward Margin (DCRM), a metric that measures the quality of a\nresponse pair for PO. Intuitively, DCRM encourages minimal noisy differences\nand maximal desired differences. With this, we study 3 types of commonly used\npreference datasets, classified along two axes: the source of the responses and\nthe preference labeling function. We establish a general correlation between\nhigher DCRM of the training set and better learning outcome. Inspired by this,\nwe propose a best-of-$N^2$ pairing method that selects response pairs with the\nhighest DCRM.

Dual-gate and gate-all-around geometries are often employed to improve\ngate control in very short channel length transistors. This can introduce\nsignificant process complexity to the device fabrication compared to\nsingle-gate transistors. It is shown in this paper that substantial reductions\nin short channel effects are possible in single-gate field-effect transistors\nwith indium gallium zinc oxide semiconductor channels by modifying the design\nof the source and drain electrodes to possess an array of tapered tips which\nare designated as nanospike electrodes. 20-25 nm channel length FETs with\nnanospike electrodes have DIBL and other key metrics that are comparable to\nthose in much larger (70-80 nm) channel length FETs with a conventional\nsource/drain electrode design. These improvements stem from better gate control\nnear the source and drain electrode tips due to the shape of these electrodes.\nThese bottom gate FETs had a gate insulator consisting of 9 nm thick Al2O3 and\nindependent Ni gates.

    "abstract": "Traffic classification has a significant impact on maintaining the Quality of\nService (QoS) of the network. Since traditional methods heavily rely on feature\nextraction and large scale labeled data, some recent pre-trained models manage\nto reduce the dependency by utilizing different pre-training tasks to train\ngeneric representations for network packets. However, existing pre-trained\nmodels typically adopt pre-training tasks developed for image or text data,\nwhich are not tailored to traffic data. As a result, the obtained traffic\nrepresentations fail to fully reflect the information contained in the traffic,\nand may even disrupt the protocol information. To address this, we propose\nTraGe, a novel generic packet representation model for traffic classification.\nBased on the differences between the header and payload-the two fundamental\ncomponents of a network packet-we perform differentiated pre-training according\nto the byte sequence variations (continuous in the header vs. discontinuous in\nthe payload). A dynamic masking strategy is further introduced to prevent\noverfitting to fixed byte positions. Once the generic packet representation is\nobtained, TraGe can be finetuned for diverse traffic classification tasks using\nlimited labeled data. Experimental results demonstrate that TraGe significantly\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods on two traffic classification tasks, with\nup to a 6.97% performance improvement.

    "abstract": "We study the thermal and spectral properties of irradiated circumbinary disks\n(CBDs) around binary black holes (BBHs), using analytic, hydrogen-based opacity\nmodels that capture key dependencies on temperature, density, and ionization.\nWe solve the vertically hydrostatic energy balance equations with Rosseland\nmean opacities from free-free absorption, bound-free absorption, and electron\nscattering processes, combined with ionization fractions derived by the Saha\nequation. Four opacity models are considered, including a reference model with\nno physical opacity, constructed by Lee et al. (2024), and three physically\nmotivated alternatives. The midplane temperature profiles show significant\nvariation across models, while the surface temperature remains largely\nunchanged in regions dominated by viscous heating. Opacity effects become\npronounced in the outer disk, where irradiation reprocessing shapes the\nIR-optical continuum. Inclusion of bound-free opacity introduces a noticeable\nflattening and a mid-frequency peak in the spectral energy distribution. We\nalso compute spectra of a triple disk system including the CBD and two\naccreting minidisks. The high-frequency peak arises from the hot minidisks,\nwhile the low-frequency excess originates from irradiated outer CBD layers. By\ncomparing model spectra with detection limits of Subaru, JWST, and Swift, we\nfind that systems within $\\sim10$ Mpc may show detectable IR excess from the\nCBD. Our results highlight the need for accurate opacity modeling to interpret\nelectromagnetic signatures of black hole mergers and support future integration\nof opacity tables with metallicity.",

This bright-rimmed cloud appears optically\nto be one single cloud illuminated by the UV light from the excited star of IC\n1396, however our Stokes I image and 13CO(J=3-2) archival data suggest that\nthis cloud is not a simple, single structure, but appears to be composed of two\nparts on first glance; a head part with wings and a tail, and a north-west\nextension part.Since molecular clouds are generally filamentary and it seems\nlikely that the initial structures of bright-rimmed clouds are expected to be\nalso generally elongated, we examined the possibility that the structure was\ncreated from a single elongated cloud by the UV impact. We compared the cloud\nstructure with a simulation study that investigated the evolution of prolate\nclouds exposed to the UV radiation from various directions and found that this\napparent two-part structure could be reproduced in a situation where a single\nfilamentary cloud is obliquely illuminated by UV light. The magnetic field\ndirections of the cloud are different from the ambient field direction,\ndemonstrating the field reconfiguration due to the UV impact. The distortion or\npinch of the magnetic field is seen toward the cloud head, where an\nintermediate-mass star cluster is located, suggesting gravitational\ncontraction.

However, these\nmethods often struggle with action inaccuracies due to the complexity and\ndynamic nature of manipulation scenes. In this paper, we propose a\nVision-to-4D-to-Action (V-4D-A) framework that enables direct action reasoning\nfrom motion-aware 4D representations via a Gaussian Action Field (GAF). GAF\nextends 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) by incorporating learnable motion\nattributes, allowing simultaneous modeling of dynamic scenes and manipulation\nactions. To learn time-varying scene geometry and action-aware robot motion,\nGAF supports three key query types: reconstruction of the current scene,\nprediction of future frames, and estimation of initial action via robot motion.\nFurthermore, the high-quality current and future frames generated by GAF\nfacilitate manipulation action refinement through a GAF-guided diffusion model.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements, with GAF achieving\n+11.5385 dB PSNR and -0.5574 LPIPS improvements in reconstruction quality,\nwhile boosting the average success rate in robotic manipulation tasks by 10.33%\nover state-of-the-art methods.

To address this challenge, this study\nproposes an adaptive forecasting framework that integrates drift detection with\ntargeted model retraining to compensate for drift effects. The framework\nutilizes the Pruned Exact Linear Time (PELT) algorithm to identify drift points\nwithin the feature space of time series data. Once drift intervals are\ndetected, selective retraining is applied to prediction models using Multilayer\nPerceptron (MLP) and Lasso Regressor architectures, allowing the models to\nadjust to changing data patterns.

Initial baseline models were developed without\ndrift detection using extensive feature engineering. After integrating\ndrift-aware retraining, the MLP model achieved a 44% reduction in mean absolute\nerror (MAE) and a 39% increase in R^2 on the real-world dataset, while even\ngreater improvements were observed on the synthetic financial dataset.

    "abstract": "Modern deep learning is increasingly characterized by the use of open-weight\nfoundation models that can be fine-tuned on specialized datasets. This has led\nto a proliferation of expert models and adapters, often shared via platforms\nlike HuggingFace and AdapterHub. To leverage these resources, numerous model\nupcycling methods have emerged, enabling the reuse of fine-tuned models in\nmulti-task systems. A natural pipeline has thus formed to harness the benefits\nof transfer learning and amortize sunk training costs: models are pre-trained\non general data, fine-tuned on specific tasks, and then upcycled into more\ngeneral-purpose systems. A prevailing assumption is that improvements at one\nstage of this pipeline propagate downstream, leading to gains at subsequent\nsteps. In this work, we challenge that assumption by examining how expert\nfine-tuning affects model upcycling. We show that long fine-tuning of experts\nthat optimizes for their individual performance leads to degraded merging\nperformance, both for fully fine-tuned and LoRA-adapted models, and to worse\ndownstream results when LoRA adapters are upcycled into MoE layers. We trace\nthis degradation to the memorization of a small set of difficult examples that\ndominate late fine-tuning steps and are subsequently forgotten during merging.\nFinally, we demonstrate that a task-dependent aggressive early stopping\nstrategy can significantly improve upcycling performance.",

    "abstract": "Temporal Betweenness Centrality (TBC) measures how often a node appears on\noptimal temporal paths, reflecting its importance in temporal networks.\nHowever, exact computation is highly expensive, and real-world TBC\ndistributions are extremely imbalanced. The severe imbalance leads\nlearning-based models to overfit to zero-centrality nodes, resulting in\ninaccurate TBC predictions and failure to identify truly central nodes.\nExisting graph neural network (GNN) methods either fail to handle such\nimbalance or ignore temporal dependencies altogether. To address these issues,\nwe propose a scalable and inductive contrastive learning-based GNN (CLGNN) for\naccurate and efficient TBC prediction. CLGNN builds an instance graph to\npreserve path validity and temporal order, then encodes structural and temporal\nfeatures using dual aggregation, i.e., mean and edge-to-node multi-head\nattention mechanisms, enhanced by temporal path count and time encodings. A\nstability-based clustering-guided contrastive module (KContrastNet) is\nintroduced to separate high-, median-, and low-centrality nodes in\nrepresentation space, mitigating class imbalance, while a regression module\n(ValueNet) estimates TBC values. CLGNN also supports multiple optimal path\ndefinitions to accommodate diverse temporal semantics. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of CLGNN across diverse\nbenchmarks.

In order to solve the problem of evaluating the dispatchable\npotential of electric vehicle clusters, a charging station aggregation model\nwas constructed based on Minkowski summation theory, and the scattered electric\nvehicle resources were aggregated into virtual energy storage units to\nparticipate in system scheduling. Integrate price-based and incentive-based\ndemand response mechanisms to synergistically tap the potential of source-load\ntwo-side regulation; On this basis, a two-stage optimal scheduling model of\nday-ahead and intra-day is constructed. The simulation results show that the\nproposed method reduces the scale of \"preventive curtailment\" due to more\naccurate scheduling, avoids the threat of power shortage to the safety of the\npower grid, and has more advantages in the efficiency of new energy\nconsumption. At the same time, intra-day scheduling significantly reduces\neconomic penalties and operating costs by avoiding output shortages, and\nimproves the economy of the system in an uncertain forecasting environment.",

Given that the\nEmpirical Risk Minimization (ERM) principle being fundamental in the PAC theory\nand ubiquitous in practical machine learning, the recent work of\narXiv:2412.02810 studied the universal rates of ERM for binary classification\nunder the realizable setting.

Indeed, the majority of the literature on\nuniversal learning has focused on the realizable case, leaving the\nnon-realizable case barely explored.\n  In this paper, we consider the problem of universal learning by ERM for\nbinary classification under the agnostic setting, where the ''learning curve\"\nreflects the decay of the excess risk as the sample size increases. We explore\nthe possibilities of agnostic universal rates and reveal a compact trichotomy:\nthere are three possible agnostic universal rates of ERM, being either\n$e^{-n}$, $o(n^{-1/2})$, or arbitrarily slow.

Although ReuseViT\nsignificantly reduces computation, these savings do not directly translate into\nperformance gains on GPUs.

    "abstract": "The discrimination of quantum states is a central problem in quantum\ninformation science and technology. Meanwhile, partial post-selection has\nemerged as a valuable tool for quantum state engineering. In this work, we\nbring these two areas together and ask whether partial measurements can enhance\nthe discrimination performance between two unknown and non-orthogonal pure\nstates. Our framework is general: the two unknown states interact with the same\nenvironment-set in a pure state-via an arbitrary unitary transformation. A\npartial measurement is then performed on one of the output modes, modeled by an\narbitrary positive operator-valued measure (POVM). We then allow classical\ncommunication to inform the unmeasured mode of the outcome of the partial\nmeasurement on the other mode, which is subsequently measured by a POVM that is\noptimal in the sense that the probability of error is minimized. The two POVMs\nact locally, but since we allow for classical communication between the two\nmodes, we consider a scheme involving local operations and classical\ncommunication (LOCC). Under these considerations, we show that the minimum\nerror probability, averaged over all possible post-selected branches, cannot be\nreduced below the minimum error probability of discriminating the original\ninput states. In other words, prior state engineering via partial measurement\ndoes not improve the average discrimination performance. However, we also\nidentify specific post-selection outcomes under which the conditional\ndiscrimination can achieve strictly lower error probabilities than the original\noptimal measurement, illustrating that while post-selection does not improve\naverage performance, it can enable better discrimination in certain branches of\nthe post-selected ensemble.",

Seven alternative distributions, and model averaging over\nall distributional assumptions, were compared on four datasets: two were stated\npreference, one was revealed preference, and one was simulated.

Alternative distributional assumptions\noutperformed standard practice. Preference distributions and the mean\nwillingness-to-pay varied significantly across specifications, and were seldom\ncomparable to those derived from normal distributions. Model averaging offered\ndistributions allowed for greater flexibility, further gains in fit, reproduced\nunderlying distributions in simulations, and mitigated against analyst bias\narising from distribution selection.

A central challenge toward this\nend is how a sequence model encodes graphs of varying sizes and from different\ndomains. We propose representing a node as multiple random walks, such that the\nTransformer can extract node representations from sequences, which in turn form\nedge and graph representations. We develop a novel context prediction loss for\nthese random walks and theoretically analyze their expressive power in\ndistinguishing neighborhoods and graphs. We also demonstrate the pre-training\nof our model and its adaptation to downstream tasks, showcasing its potential\nas a foundation for processing and reasoning with graph-structured data.",

    "abstract": "We present a complementarity-based collision resolution algorithm for smooth,\nnon-spherical, rigid bodies. Unlike discrete surface representation approaches,\nwhich approximate surfaces using discrete elements (e.g., tessellations or\nsub-spheres) with constraints between nearby faces, edges, nodes, or\nsub-objects, our algorithm solves a recursively generated linear\ncomplementarity problem (ReLCP) to adaptively identify potential collision\nlocations during the collision resolution procedure. Despite adaptively and in\ncontrast to Newton-esque schemes, we prove conditions under which the resulting\nsolution exists and the center of mass translational and rotational dynamics\nare unique. Our ReLCP also converges to classical LCP-based collision\nresolution for sufficiently small timesteps. Because increasing the surface\nresolution in discrete representation methods necessitates subdividing geometry\ninto finer elements -- leading to a super-linear increase in the number of\ncollision constraints -- these approaches scale poorly with increased surface\nresolution. In contrast, our adaptive ReLCP framework begins with a single\nconstraint per pair of nearby bodies and introduces new constraints only when\nunconstrained motion would lead to overlap, circumventing the oversampling\nrequired by discrete methods. By requiring one to two orders of magnitude fewer\ncollision constraints to achieve the same surface resolution, we observe\n10-100x speedup in densely packed applications. We validate our ReLCP method\nagainst multisphere and single-constraint methods, comparing convergence in a\ntwo-ellipsoid collision test, scalability and performance in a compacting\nellipsoid suspension and growing bacterial colony, and stability in a taut\nchainmail network, highlighting our ability to achieve high-fidelity surface\nrepresentations without suffering from poor scalability or artificial surface\nroughness.",

Empirically studying a\nrange of attention mechanisms, we find that input-dependent sparse attention\nmodels appear to converge faster and generalize better than standard attention\nmodels, while input-agnostic sparse attention models show no such benefits -- a\nphenomenon that is robust across architectural and optimization hyperparameter\nchoices.

    "abstract": "Arguably the key issue in modelling discrete choice data is capturing\npreference heterogeneity. This can be through observed characteristics, and/or\nusing techniques for capturing random heterogeneity across respondents. On the\nlatter, in health economics, the two main approaches are the mixed multinomial\nlogit (MMNL) and the latent class (LC) model. In this paper, we revisit the\ndiscrete mixture (DM) model as a third alternative to these. The DM model is\nsimilar to LC but allows for any combination of preferences across attributes,\nrather than grouping preferences as is the case in LC. We next develop a\ngeneralised discrete mixture (GDM) model. Additional boosting parameters in the\nclass allocation component allow the model to collapse to a standard DM or LC\nstructure as best fits the data at hand. This means that the model, by\ndefinition, performs at least as well as the best of a standard DM and a LC\nmodel; or better than both. Additional benefits include that it (a) allows the\ndata to tell us the underlying correlations of preferences, (b) does not rely\non distributions as is the case for mixed logit models, meaning estimation\ntimes are reduced and it does not require assumptions on the distribution of\npreferences. Exercises on simulated data show the unlikely conditions under\nwhich a LC model would be preferred to a DM. The convention of labelling latent\nclasses, we believe, is questionable in many cases. The GDM is suitable in all\ncases. We show in empirical data that the GDM substantially outperforms LC\nmodels, granting a more detailed depiction of respondents' preferences.",

While prior work\nhas noted position order biases in LLM-driven comparisons, these biases have\nnot been systematically analyzed or linked to underlying preference structures.\nWe present the first comprehensive study of position biases across multiple\nLLMs and two distinct domains: resume comparisons, representing a realistic\nhigh-stakes context, and color selection, which isolates position effects by\nremoving confounding factors. We find strong and consistent order effects,\nincluding a quality-dependent shift: when all options are high quality, models\nfavor the first option, but when quality is lower, they favor later options. We\nalso identify two previously undocumented biases in both human and machine\ndecision-making: a centrality bias (favoring the middle position in triplewise\ncomparisons) and a name bias, where certain names are favored despite\ncontrolling for demographic signals. To separate superficial tie-breaking from\ngenuine distortions of judgment, we extend the rational choice framework to\nclassify pairwise preferences as robust, fragile, or indifferent. Using this\nframework, we show that order effects can lead models to select strictly\ninferior options, and that position biases are typically stronger than gender\nbiases. These results indicate that LLMs exhibit distinct failure modes not\ndocumented in human decision-making.

    "abstract": "Earthquake faults approximate smooth surfaces of displacement discontinuity\nin a coarse-grained linear continuum, and the beachball nodal planes of source\ninelastic strain (potency) indicate the normal vector (n-vector) of the crack\nface. This theoretical relation has been used to interpret estimated potency as\ngeometrical information of earthquake faults. We formulate an inverse analysis\nfor reconstructing a smooth, three-dimensional fault surface from a given\npotency field. The analysis is grounded on the definition of the n-vector that\nis orthogonality to a surface. It is shown from this definition that, whereas\nthe estimated n-vector field is always explained by a unique curve in two\ndimensions, the surface reconstruction from the estimated n-vector field is an\noverdetermined problem with no solution in three dimensions. We resolve this\noverdetermination by adopting the original definition of a fault surface as a\nmap that approximates a thin sheet of potency onto a displacement discontinuity\nacross a literal face. An analytical expression for this fault reconstruction\nis derived and confirmed to reproduce the original three-dimensional smooth\nsurface from a synthesized noisy n-vector field. By incorporating this result\ninto surface reconstruction based on potency density tensor inversion, we\nestimate the three-dimensional source fault geometry of the 2013 Balochistan\nearthquake. The estimated geometry is more consistent with the fault trace than\nthe quasi-two-dimensional shape reconstruction as anticipated by our numerical\nexperiments.",

Quite surprisingly, the hypergraph\nversion of subgraph counting has been almost ignored. In this work, we address\nthis gap by investigating the most basic sub-hypergraph counting problem: given\na (small) hypergraph $H$ and a (large) hypergraph $G$, compute the number of\nsub-hypergraphs of $G$ isomorphic to $H$. Formally, for a family $\\mathcal{H}$\nof hypergraphs, let #Sub($\\mathcal{H}$) be the restriction of the problem to $H\n\\in \\mathcal{H}$; the induced variant #IndSub($\\mathcal{H}$) is defined\nanalogously. Our main contribution is a complete classification of the\ncomplexity of these problems. Assuming the Exponential Time Hypothesis, we\nprove that #Sub($\\mathcal{H}$) is fixed-parameter tractable if and only if\n$\\mathcal{H}$ has bounded fractional co-independent edge-cover number, a novel\ngraph parameter we introduce. Moreover, #IndSub($\\mathcal{H}$) is\nfixed-parameter tractable if and only if $\\mathcal{H}$ has bounded fractional\nedge-cover number. Both results subsume pre-existing results for graphs as\nspecial cases. We also show that the fixed-parameter tractable cases of\n#Sub($\\mathcal{H}$) and #IndSub($\\mathcal{H}$) are unlikely to be in polynomial\ntime, unless respectively #P = P and Graph Isomorphism $\\in$ P. This shows a\nseparation with the special case of graphs, where the fixed-parameter tractable\ncases are known to actually be in polynomial time.",

    "abstract": "Predicting individuals' next locations is a core task in human mobility\nmodelling, with wide-ranging implications for urban planning, transportation,\npublic policy and personalised mobility services. Traditional approaches\nlargely depend on location embeddings learned from historical mobility\npatterns, limiting their ability to encode explicit spatial information,\nintegrate rich urban semantic context, and accommodate previously unseen\nlocations. To address these challenges, we explore the application of CaLLiPer\n-- a multimodal representation learning framework that fuses spatial\ncoordinates and semantic features of points of interest through contrastive\nlearning -- for location embedding in individual mobility prediction.\nCaLLiPer's embeddings are spatially explicit, semantically enriched, and\ninductive by design, enabling robust prediction performance even in scenarios\ninvolving emerging locations. Through extensive experiments on four public\nmobility datasets under both conventional and inductive settings, we\ndemonstrate that CaLLiPer consistently outperforms strong baselines,\nparticularly excelling in inductive scenarios. Our findings highlight the\npotential of multimodal, inductive location embeddings to advance the\ncapabilities of human mobility prediction systems. We also release the code and\ndata (https://github.com/xlwang233/Into-the-Unknown) to foster reproducibility\nand future research.",
