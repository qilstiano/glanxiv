However, all known solutions to this problem essentially\nreduce to some form of APSP, and hence take at least quadratic time, even for\nspecial object types.\n  In this work, we consider the unweighted form of the problem, for which we\ndevise subquadratic approximation algorithms for many special cases of objects,\nincluding line segments and disks. In this paradigm, we are able to devise\nalgorithms that are fundamentally different from the APSP-based approach. In\nparticular, we will give Monte Carlo randomized additive $+1$ approximation\nalgorithms running in $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(n^{\\frac32})$ time for disks as\nwell as axis-aligned line segments and rectangles, and\n$\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(n^{\\frac{11}6})$ time for line segments and\nconstant-complexity convex polygons. We will also give deterministic\nmultiplicative-additive approximation algorithms that, for any value\n$\\varepsilon>0$, guarantee a solution of size $(1+\\varepsilon)\\text{OPT}+1$\nwhile running in $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\left(\\frac{n}{\\varepsilon^2}\\right)$\ntime for disks as well as axis-aligned line segments and rectangles, and\n$\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\left(\\frac{n^{4/3}}{\\epsilon^2}\\right)$ time for line\nsegments and constant-complexity convex polygons.",

MDRC captures multi-scale features through parallel dilated\nconvolutions with varying dilation rates, while SSCA focuses on the most\nrelevant spatial regions and channel features to enhance detection accuracy and\nsuppress interference from background noise. In our experiments, the improved\nmodel outperformed state-of-the-art alternatives, improving mean Average\nPrecision (mAP) by over 14% and Intersection over Union (IoU) by approximately\n17%, demonstrating significantly improved localization accuracy for gravity\nwaves in challenging satellite imagery and contributing to more precise climate\nresearch and modeling.",

When\nintegrated over the volume of the aortic sinuses and central lumen, the local\nactivation is, respectively, 5.90 and 2.26 times higher in BMHV whereas 2.97\nand 1.39 times higher in TMHV than in BHV.

    "abstract": "This paper explores successor features for knowledge transfer in zero-sum,\ncomplete-information, and turn-based games. Prior research in single-agent\nsystems has shown that successor features can provide a ``jump start\" for\nagents when facing new tasks with varying reward structures. However, knowledge\ntransfer in games typically relies on value and equilibrium transfers, which\nheavily depends on the similarity between tasks. This reliance can lead to\nfailures when the tasks differ significantly. To address this issue, this paper\npresents an application of successor features to games and presents a novel\nalgorithm called Game Generalized Policy Improvement (GGPI), designed to\naddress Markov games in multi-agent reinforcement learning. The proposed\nalgorithm enables the transfer of learning values and policies across games. An\nupper bound of the errors for transfer is derived as a function the similarity\nof the task. Through experiments with a turn-based pursuer-evader game, we\ndemonstrate that the GGPI algorithm can generate high-reward interactions and\none-shot policy transfer. When further tested in a wider set of initial\nconditions, the GGPI algorithm achieves higher success rates with improved path\nefficiency compared to those of the baseline algorithms.",

    "abstract": "The analysis of fundus images is critical for the early detection and\ndiagnosis of retinal diseases such as Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), Glaucoma, and\nAge-related Macular Degeneration (AMD). Traditional diagnostic workflows,\nhowever, often depend on manual interpretation and are both time- and\nresource-intensive. To address these limitations, we propose an automated and\ninterpretable clinical decision support framework based on a hybrid feature\nextraction model called HOG-CNN. Our key contribution lies in the integration\nof handcrafted Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features with deep\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) representations. This fusion enables our\nmodel to capture both local texture patterns and high-level semantic features\nfrom retinal fundus images. We evaluated our model on three public benchmark\ndatasets: APTOS 2019 (for binary and multiclass DR classification), ORIGA (for\nGlaucoma detection), and IC-AMD (for AMD diagnosis); HOG-CNN demonstrates\nconsistently high performance. It achieves 98.5\\% accuracy and 99.2 AUC for\nbinary DR classification, and 94.2 AUC for five-class DR classification. On the\nIC-AMD dataset, it attains 92.8\\% accuracy, 94.8\\% precision, and 94.5 AUC,\noutperforming several state-of-the-art models.

Recent methods enhance CFM performance by\ninducing shorter and straighter trajectories but typically rely on\ncomputationally expensive mini-batch optimal transport (OT). Drawing insights\nfrom entropic optimal transport (EOT), we propose Weighted Conditional Flow\nMatching (W-CFM), a novel approach that modifies the classical CFM loss by\nweighting each training pair $(x, y)$ with a Gibbs kernel. We show that this\nweighting recovers the entropic OT coupling up to some bias in the marginals,\nand we provide the conditions under which the marginals remain nearly\nunchanged. Moreover, we establish an equivalence between W-CFM and the\nminibatch OT method in the large-batch limit, showing how our method overcomes\ncomputational and performance bottlenecks linked to batch size. Empirically, we\ntest our method on unconditional generation on various synthetic and real\ndatasets, confirming that W-CFM achieves comparable or superior sample quality,\nfidelity, and diversity to other alternative baselines while maintaining the\ncomputational efficiency of vanilla CFM.",

However, these methods often overlook\ncritical challenges, such as noisy user behavior data and data sparsity due to\nthe long-tailed distribution of these behaviors. In this paper, we propose\nMMSC, a self-supervised multi-modal relational item representation learning\nframework to address these challenges. Specifically, MMSC consists of three\nmain components: (1) a multi-modal item representation learning module that\nleverages a multi-modal foundational model and learns from item metadata, (2) a\nself-supervised behavior-based representation learning module that denoises and\nlearns from user behavior data, and (3) a hierarchical representation\naggregation mechanism that integrates item representations at both the semantic\nand task levels. Additionally, we leverage LLMs to generate augmented training\ndata, further enhancing the denoising process during training. We conduct\nextensive experiments on five real-world datasets, showing that MMSC\noutperforms existing baselines by 26.1% for substitutable recommendation and\n39.2% for complementary recommendation.

However, CLIP struggles with\npotential information misalignment in many image-text datasets and suffers from\nentangled representation. On the one hand, short captions for a single image in\ndatasets like MSCOCO may describe disjoint regions in the image, leaving the\nmodel uncertain about which visual features to retain or disregard. On the\nother hand, directly aligning long captions with images can lead to the\nretention of entangled details, preventing the model from learning\ndisentangled, atomic concepts -- ultimately limiting its generalization on\ncertain downstream tasks involving short prompts.\n  In this paper, we establish theoretical conditions that enable flexible\nalignment between textual and visual representations across varying levels of\ngranularity. Specifically, our framework ensures that a model can not only\n\\emph{preserve} cross-modal semantic information in its entirety but also\n\\emph{disentangle} visual representations to capture fine-grained textual\nconcepts. Building on this foundation, we introduce \\ours, a novel approach\nthat identifies and aligns the most relevant visual and textual representations\nin a modular manner.

However, its usefulness is greatly limited by\nartifacts from magnetic resonance (MR), especially gradient artifacts (GA) and\nballistocardiogram (BCG) artifacts, which interfere with the EEG signal. To\naddress this issue, we used a denoising autoencoder (DAR), a deep learning\nframework designed to reduce MR-related artifacts in EEG recordings. Using\npaired data that includes both artifact-contaminated and MR-corrected EEG from\nthe CWL EEG-fMRI dataset, DAR uses a 1D convolutional autoencoder to learn a\ndirect mapping from noisy to clear signal segments. Compared to traditional\nartifact removal methods like principal component analysis (PCA), independent\ncomponent analysis (ICA), average artifact subtraction (AAS), and wavelet\nthresholding, DAR shows better performance. It achieves a root-mean-squared\nerror (RMSE) of 0.0218 $\\pm$ 0.0152, a structural similarity index (SSIM) of\n0.8885 $\\pm$ 0.0913, and a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gain of 14.63 dB.\nStatistical analysis with paired t-tests confirms that these improvements are\nsignificant (p<0.001; Cohen's d>1.2). A leave-one-subject-out (LOSO)\ncross-validation protocol shows that the model generalizes well, yielding an\naverage RMSE of 0.0635 $\\pm$ 0.0110 and an SSIM of 0.6658 $\\pm$ 0.0880 across\nunseen subjects. Additionally, saliency-based visualizations demonstrate that\nDAR highlights areas with dense artifacts, which makes its decisions easier to\ninterpret.

In the framework of this Ising Network Opinion\nFormation model we analyze the influence and competition between political\nleaders, world countries and social concepts. This approach is also generalized\nto the competition between three groups of different opinions described by\nthree colors, for example Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping or USA,\nRussia, China within English, Russian and Chinese editions of Wikipedia of\nMarch 2025. We argue that this approach provides a generic description of\nopinion formation in various complex networks.",

However, this control transition places significant demands on drivers,\nrequiring them to promptly respond to takeover requests while executing\nhigh-quality interventions. To ensure safe and comfortable control transitions,\nit is essential to develop a deep understanding of the key factors influencing\nvarious takeover performance aspects. This study evaluates drivers' takeover\nperformance across three dimensions: response efficiency, user experience, and\ndriving safety - using a driving simulator experiment. EXtreme Gradient\nBoosting (XGBoost) models are used to investigate the contributions of two\ncritical factors, i.e., Situational Awareness (SA) and Spare Capacity (SC), in\npredicting various takeover performance metrics by comparing the predictive\nresults to the baseline models that rely solely on basic Driver Characteristics\n(DC). The results reveal that (i) higher SA enables drivers to respond to\ntakeover requests more quickly, particularly for reflexive responses; and (ii)\nSC shows a greater overall impact on takeover quality than SA, where higher SC\ngenerally leads to enhanced subjective rating scores and objective execution\ntrajectories. These findings highlight the distinct yet complementary roles of\nSA and SC in shaping performance components, offering valuable insights for\noptimizing human-vehicle interactions and enhancing automated driving system\ndesign.",

Specifically, we seek a cost-efficient way to\nestimate the quality of data sources (e.g. synthetically generated or filtered\nweb data, etc.) in order to make optimal decisions about resource allocation\nfor data sourcing from these sources for the stage two pre-training phase, aka\nannealing, with the goal of specializing a generalist pre-trained model to\nspecific domains. Our approach extends the usual point estimate approaches, aka\nmicro-annealing, to estimating scaling laws by performing multiple annealing\nruns of varying compute spent on data curation and training. This addresses a\nkey limitation in prior work, where reliance on point estimates for data\nscaling decisions can be misleading due to the lack of rank invariance across\ncompute scales -- a phenomenon we confirm in our experiments. By systematically\nanalyzing performance gains relative to acquisition costs, we find that scaling\ncurves can be estimated for different data sources. Such scaling laws can\ninform cost effective resource allocation across different data acquisition\nmethods (e.g. synthetic data), data sources (e.g. user or web data) and\navailable compute resources. We validate our approach through experiments on a\npre-trained model with 7 billion parameters. We adapt it to: a domain\nwell-represented in the pre-training data -- the medical domain, and a domain\nunderrepresented in the pretraining corpora -- the math domain. We show that\none can efficiently estimate the scaling behaviors of a data source by running\nmultiple annealing runs, which can lead to different conclusions, had one used\npoint estimates using the usual micro-annealing technique instead.

In case of\nan $n$-qubit system the disturbance due to depolarization and dephasing is\nidentified based on a certain complexity quantity defined as the difference of\nthe Shannon-entropy and the R\\'enyi entropy of order two. In case of the effect\nof the depolarization the quantum system is replaced by a fully separable, i.e.\nclassical state with probability $p$ while it remains unchanged with\nprobability $1-p$. Whereas dephasing is modelled by destructing the appropriate\noff-diagonal elements of the density matrix also with probability $p$. For both\ncases the state with maximal complexity marks the border between the most\nquantum and most classical limits. Furthermore we also show that many body\nsystems modelled using deformed random matrix ensembles, deformed two-body\nrandom interaction ensembles and also the system of one-dimensional\nHeisenberg-model of spins subject to a random, local magnetic field exhibiting\nmany body localization transition, the states with maximal complexity mark the\ncross-over or the transition point between integrability and full quantum\nchaos. Finally we address the question of identifying the cross-over in the\nthermalization properties within large sets of quantum chaotic states using the\nsurvival probability of an excitation of a many body system. All these results\nshow that the complexity parameter defined on a combination of the von Neumann\nentropy and the R\\'enyi entropy of 2nd order is a meaningful and informative\nparameter to detect whenever a system is in a cross-over state between the\notherwise trivial extremal cases of integrability or localization and quantum\nchaos or ergodic behavior.",

This paper presents a novel spatial-temporal-spectral Mamba\n(STSMamba) with deformable token sequence for enhanced MODIS time series\nclassification, with the following key contributions. First, to disentangle\ntemporal-spectral feature coupling, a temporal grouped stem (TGS) module is\ndesigned for initial feature learning.

    "abstract": "Strong electron correlations drive Mott insulator transitions. Yet, there\nexists no framework to classify Mott insulators by their degree of correlation.\nCuprate superconductors, with their tunable doping and rich phase diagrams,\noffer a unique platform to investigate the evolution of those interactions.\nHowever, spectroscopic access to a clean half-filled Mott-insulating state is\nlacking in compounds with the highest superconducting onset temperature. To\nfill this gap, we introduce a pristine, half-filled thallium-based cuprate\nsystem, Tl$_2$Ba$_5$Cu$_4$O$_{10+x}$ (Tl2504). Using high-resolution resonant\ninelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS), we probe long-lived magnon excitations and\nuncover a pronounced kink in the magnon dispersion, marked by a simultaneous\nchange in group velocity and lifetime broadening. Modeling the dispersion\nwithin a Hubbard-Heisenberg approach, we extract the interaction strength and\ncompare it with other cuprate systems. Our results establish a cuprate\nuniversal relation between electron-electron interaction and magnon\nzone-boundary dispersion. Superconductivity seems to be optimal at intermediate\ncorrelation strength, suggesting an optimal balance between localization and\nitinerancy.",

    "abstract": "Opportunistic interactions-the unstructured exchanges that emerge as\nindividuals become aware of each other's presence-are essential for\nrelationship building and information sharing in everyday life. Yet, fostering\neffective opportunistic interactions has proven challenging, especially at\nprofessional events that have increasingly transitioned from in person to\nonline formats. In the current paper, we offer an in-depth qualitative account\nof how people initiate opportunistic interactions in social VR. Our\nparticipants consisted of 16 individuals with ongoing experience attending\nVR-mediated events in their professional communities. We conducted extensive\nobservations with each participant during one or more events they attended. We\nalso interviewed them after every observed event, obtaining self-reflections on\ntheir attempts to navigate opportunistic interactions with others. Our analysis\nrevealed that participants sought to understand the extent to which social VR\npreserved the real-world meanings of various nonverbal cues, which we refer to\nas verisimilitude. We detailed the unique connections between a person's\nperceived verisimilitude and their social behaviors at each of the three steps\ntoward initiating opportunistic interactions: availability recognition,\nattention capture, and ice-breaking. Across these steps, the VR platform\ntypically replaces complex social mechanisms with feasible technical ones in\norder to function, thereby altering the preconditions necessary for a nonverbal\ncue's social meanings to remain intact. We identified a rich set of strategies\nthat participants developed to assess verisimilitude and act upon it, while\nalso confirming a lack of systematic knowledge guiding their practices. Based\non these findings, we provide actionable insights for social VR platform design\nthat can best support the initiation of opportunistic interactions for\nprofessional purposes.",

While machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models have shown\npromise in detecting such attacks, their opaque decision-making limits operator\ntrust and real-world applicability. This paper proposes a hybrid framework that\nintegrates lightweight ML-based attack detection with natural language\nexplanations generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). Classifiers such as\nLightGBM achieve up to 95.13% attack detection accuracy with only 0.004 s\ninference latency. Upon detecting a cyberattack, the system invokes LLMs,\nincluding GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4 Turbo, and GPT-4o mini, to generate\nhuman-readable explanation of the event. Evaluated on 100 test samples, GPT-4o\nmini with 20-shot prompting achieved 93% accuracy in identifying the attack\ntarget, a mean absolute error of 0.075 pu in estimating attack magnitude, and\n2.19 seconds mean absolute error (MAE) in estimating attack onset.

Yet,\ncatalogs of peculiar velocities are noisy, scarce and prone to various\ninterpretation biases. We aim to measure the bulk flow and the Hubble constant\ndirectly from the largest available sample of peculiar velocities, and without\nimposing a cosmological prior on the velocity field. To address these issues,\nwe analyze the Cosmicflows-4 catalog, the most extensive catalog of galaxy\npeculiar velocities, reaching a redshift $z=0.1$. Specifically, we construct a\nforward modeling approach assuming only a flat Universe, which reconstructs the\nradial and bulk flows of the velocity field directly from measurements of\npeculiar velocities. Our method accurately recovers cosmological parameters\nwithin a radius of $120\\ \\mathrm{Mpc/h}$ that can then be compared with the\npredictions from $\\Lambda{\\rm CDM}$. Apart from a $3\\sigma$ tension with\n$\\Lambda{\\rm CDM}$ on the magnitude around $120\\ \\mathrm{Mpc/h}$ associated\nwith a $4\\sigma$ tension on the supergalactic $X$ direction, we find a general\nagreement between the standard model and the observations.

    "abstract": "The IceCube South Pole Neutrino Observatory has discovered the presence of a\ndiffuse astrophysical neutrino flux at energies of TeV and beyond using\nneutrino induced muon tracks and cascade events from neutrino interactions. We\npresent two analyses sensitive to neutrino events in the energy range\n\\SI{1}{TeV} to \\SI{10}{PeV}, using more than 10 years of IceCube data. Both\nanalyses consistently reject a neutrino spectrum following a single power-law\nwith significance $>4\\,\\sigma$ in favor of a broken power law. We describe the\nmethods implemented in the two analyses, the spectral constraints obtained, and\nthe validation of the robustness of the results. Additionally, we report the\ndetection of a muon neutrino in the MESE sample with an energy of\n$11.4^{+2.46}_{-2.53} $\\,\\si{PeV}, the highest energy neutrino observed by\nIceCube to date. The results presented here show insights into the spectral\nshape of astrophysical neutrinos, which has important implications for\ninferring their production processes in a multi-messenger picture.",

Parameters for the SG model were derived from recent\natom-in-jellium predictions of the shear modulus under compression and\nexperimental data on work-hardening from rolled-bar studies. The ambient shear\nmodulus was fixed to the measured value, and the pressure-hardening parameter\nwas fitted to the atom-in-jellium predictions up to 1 TPa. The shear modulus\nmodel was still a reasonable fit beyond 25 TPa. Thermal softening was estimated\nfrom the thermal expansivity and bulk modulus. Work-hardening parameters were\nextracted by fitting the model to Knoop microhardness measurements under known\nplastic strains. The resulting model captures the observed hardening behavior\nbut predicts significantly lower flow stresses at high pressures than diamond\nanvil cell observations suggest, implying that Re may exhibit enhanced strength\nat megabar pressures.

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the critical challenge of estimating the reliability of\nan Electric Vehicle (EV) charging systems when facing risks such as\noverheating, unpredictable, weather, and cyberattacks. Traditional methods for\npredicting failures often rely on past data or limiting assumptions, making\nthem ineffective for new or less common threats that results in failure. To\nsolve this issue, we utilize the Principle of Maximum Entropy (PME), a\nstatistical tool that estimates risks even with limited information. PME works\nby balancing known constraints to create an unbiased predictions without\nguessing missing details. Using the EV charging ecosystem as a case study, we\nshow how PME models stress factors responsible for failure. Our findings reveal\na critical insight: even minor, localized stress events can trigger\ndisproportionately large drops in overall system reliability, similar to a\ndomino effect. The our PME model demonstrates how high-impact components, such\nas the power grid, are more likely to fail as stress accumulates, creating\nnetwork-wide tipping points. Beyond EVs, this approach applies to any complex\nsystem with incomplete data, such as smart grids, healthcare devices, or\nlogistics networks. By mathematically establishing an inverse relationship\nbetween uncertainty (entropy) and reliability, our work quantifies how greater\nsystem unpredictability directly degrades robustness. This offers a universal\ntool to improve decision-making under unpredictable conditions.

    "abstract": "Generative recommendation (GR) has gained increasing attention for its\npromising performance compared to traditional models. A key factor contributing\nto the success of GR is the semantic ID (SID), which converts continuous\nsemantic representations (e.g., from large language models) into discrete ID\nsequences. This enables GR models with SIDs to both incorporate semantic\ninformation and learn collaborative filtering signals, while retaining the\nbenefits of discrete decoding. However, varied modeling techniques,\nhyper-parameters, and experimental setups in existing literature make direct\ncomparisons between GR proposals challenging. Furthermore, the absence of an\nopen-source, unified framework hinders systematic benchmarking and extension,\nslowing model iteration. To address this challenge, our work introduces and\nopen-sources a framework for Generative Recommendation with semantic ID, namely\nGRID, specifically designed for modularity to facilitate easy component\nswapping and accelerate idea iteration. Using GRID, we systematically\nexperiment with and ablate different components of GR models with SIDs on\npublic benchmarks. Our comprehensive experiments with GRID reveal that many\noverlooked architectural components in GR models with SIDs substantially impact\nperformance. This offers both novel insights and validates the utility of an\nopen-source platform for robust benchmarking and GR research advancement.

The sequence alignment algorithms often involve\nsimple arithmetic operations and feature high degrees of inherent fine-grained\nand coarse-grained parallelism.

In this\npaper, we show that the excessive memory bandwidth demand of the sequence\nalignment algorithms prevents exploiting the maximum achievable throughput on\nconventional parallel machines. We then propose a memory-aware architecture to\nreduce the bandwidth demand of the sequence alignment algorithms, effectively\npushing the memory wall to extract higher throughput. The design is integrated\nat the logic layer of an emerging 3D DRAM as a processing-in-memory\narchitecture to further increase the available bandwidth.

Our numerical methodology allows us to modify\nthe droplets' interfacial properties to mimic the presence of an emulsifier\n(e.g., a surfactant), resulting in a positive disjoining pressure that\nstabilizes the droplets against coalescence. To appreciate the effects of this\ninterfacial stabilization on the RB convective dynamics, we carry out a\ncomparative study between a proper emulsion, i.e., a system where the\nstabilization mechanism is present (stabilized liquid-liquid dispersion), and a\nsystem where the stabilization mechanism is absent (non-stabilized\nliquid-liquid dispersion). The study is conducted by systematically changing\nboth the volume fraction, $\\phi$, and the Rayleigh number, Ra. We find that the\nmorphology of the two systems is dramatically different due to the different\ninterfacial properties. However, the two systems exhibit similar global heat\ntransfer properties, expressed via the Nusselt number Nu. Significant\ndifferences in heat transfer emerge at smaller scales, which we analyze via the\nNusselt number defined at mesoscales, Nu$_{\\mathrm{mes}}$. In particular,\nstabilized systems exhibit more intense mesoscale heat flux fluctuations due to\nthe persistence of fluid velocity fluctuations down to small scales, which are\ninstead dissipated in the interfacial dynamics of non-stabilized dispersions.\nFor fixed Ra, the difference in mesoscale heat flux fluctuations depends\nnon-trivially on $\\phi$, featuring a maximum in the range $0.1 < \\phi < 0.2$.\nTaken all together, our results highlight the role of interfacial physics in\nmesoscale convective heat transfer of complex fluids.",

To address this,\nparticularly under real-world experimental constraints such as limited dataset\nsize, class imbalance, and bounding-box-based segmentation, we used a publicly\navailable murine ileum MERFISH dataset to evaluate whether a minimally tuned\nvariational autoencoder (VAE) could extract informative low-dimensional\nrepresentations from cell crops of spot counts, nuclear stain, membrane stain,\nor a combination thereof.

While transcript counts (TC) generally outperformed other feature\nspaces, the VAE-derived latent spaces (LSs) captured meaningful biological\nvariation and enabled improved label recovery for specific cell types. LS2, in\nparticular, trained solely on morphological input, also exhibited moderate\npredictive power for a handful of genes in a ridge regression model. Notably,\ncombining TC with LSs through multiplex clustering led to consistent gains in\ncluster homogeneity, a trend that also held when augmenting only subsets of TC\nwith the stain-derived LS2. In contrast, CellProfiler-derived features\nunderperformed relative to LSs, highlighting the advantage of learned\nrepresentations over hand-crafted features.

    "abstract": "Contextual entropy is a psycholinguistic measure capturing the anticipated\ndifficulty of processing a word just before it is encountered. Recent studies\nhave tested for entropy-related effects as a potential complement to well-known\neffects from surprisal. For convenience, entropy is typically estimated based\non a language model's probability distribution over a word's first subword\ntoken. However, this approximation results in underestimation and potential\ndistortion of true word entropy. To address this, we generate Monte Carlo (MC)\nestimates of word entropy that allow words to span a variable number of tokens.\nRegression experiments on reading times show divergent results between\nfirst-token and MC word entropy, suggesting a need for caution in using\nfirst-token approximations of contextual entropy.",

Existing unlearning methods designed for visual data inadequately\nhandle the sequential, temporal, and high-dimensional nature of audio signals,\nleading to ineffective or incomplete speaker and accent erasure. To address\nthis, we introduce QPAudioEraser, a quantum-inspired audio unlearning\nframework.

This effort focused on the implementation of macro\ncontrol action RL, a technique in which an onboard agent is provided with\ncompiled information based on live telemetry as its observation. The agent uses\nthis information to produce high-level actions, such as adjusting attitude to\nsolar pointing, which are then translated into control algorithms and executed\nthrough lower-level instructions. Once trust in the onboard agent is\nestablished, real-time environmental information can be leveraged for faster\nresponse times and reduced reliance on ground control. The approach not only\nfocuses on developing an RL algorithm for a specific satellite but also sets a\nprecedent for integrating trusted AI into onboard systems. This research builds\non previous work in three areas: (1) RL algorithms for issuing high-level\ncommands that are translated into low-level executable instructions; (2) the\ndeployment of AI inference models interfaced with live operational systems,\nparticularly onboard spacecraft; and (3) strategies for building trust in AI\nsystems, especially for remote and autonomous applications. Existing RL\nresearch for satellite control is largely limited to simulation-based\nexperiments; in this work, these techniques are tailored by constructing a\ndigital twin of a specific spacecraft and training the RL agent to issue macro\nactions in this simulated environment. The policy of the trained agent is\ncopied to an isolated environment, where it is fed compiled information about\nthe satellite to make inference predictions, thereby demonstrating the RL\nalgorithm's validity on orbit without granting it command authority.

    "abstract": "Commercial LLM services often conceal internal reasoning traces while still\ncharging users for every generated token, including those from hidden\nintermediate steps, raising concerns of token inflation and potential\noverbilling. This gap underscores the urgent need for reliable token auditing,\nyet achieving it is far from straightforward: cryptographic verification (e.g.,\nhash-based signature) offers little assurance when providers control the entire\nexecution pipeline, while user-side prediction struggles with the inherent\nvariance of reasoning LLMs, where token usage fluctuates across domains and\nprompt styles. To bridge this gap, we present PALACE (Predictive Auditing of\nLLM APIs via Reasoning Token Count Estimation), a user-side framework that\nestimates hidden reasoning token counts from prompt-answer pairs without access\nto internal traces. PALACE introduces a GRPO-augmented adaptation module with a\nlightweight domain router, enabling dynamic calibration across diverse\nreasoning tasks and mitigating variance in token usage patterns. Experiments on\nmath, coding, medical, and general reasoning benchmarks show that PALACE\nachieves low relative error and strong prediction accuracy, supporting both\nfine-grained cost auditing and inflation detection. Taken together, PALACE\nrepresents an important first step toward standardized predictive auditing,\noffering a practical path to greater transparency, accountability, and user\ntrust.",

    "abstract": "This paper argues that explainability is only one facet of a broader ideal\nthat shapes our expectations towards artificial intelligence (AI).\nFundamentally, the issue is to what extent AI exhibits systematicity--not\nmerely in being sensitive to how thoughts are composed of recombinable\nconstituents, but in striving towards an integrated body of thought that is\nconsistent, coherent, comprehensive, and parsimoniously principled. This richer\nconception of systematicity has been obscured by the long shadow of the\n\"systematicity challenge\" to connectionism, according to which network\narchitectures are fundamentally at odds with what Fodor and colleagues termed\n\"the systematicity of thought.\" I offer a conceptual framework for thinking\nabout \"the systematicity of thought\" that distinguishes four senses of the\nphrase. I use these distinctions to defuse the perceived tension between\nsystematicity and connectionism and show that the conception of systematicity\nthat historically shaped our sense of what makes thought rational,\nauthoritative, and scientific is more demanding than the Fodorian notion. To\ndetermine whether we have reason to hold AI models to this ideal of\nsystematicity, I then argue, we must look to the rationales for systematization\nand explore to what extent they transfer to AI models. I identify five such\nrationales and apply them to AI. This brings into view the \"hard systematicity\nchallenge.\" However, the demand for systematization itself needs to be\nregulated by the rationales for systematization. This yields a dynamic\nunderstanding of the need to systematize thought, which tells us how systematic\nwe need AI models to be and when.",

This formulation supports matrix free implementations and\nenables highly parallel local solves, leading to substantial performance gains\nand excellent scalability on modern architectures. To enhance robustness in\nunder resolved or turbulent regimes, we extend the method using entropy\nvariables and a flux differencing approach to construct entropy stable and\nkinetic energy preserving variants.

We demonstrate the performance of the proposed method on benchmark\nproblems including the inviscid isentropic vortex and the Taylor Green vortex\nin both inviscid and turbulent regimes. Numerical results confirm optimal\naccuracy, improved robustness, and up to an order of magnitude speedup over\nstandard HDG methods.

    "abstract": "Modern data analysis increasingly requires identifying shared latent\nstructure across multiple high-dimensional datasets. A commonly used model\nassumes that the data matrices are noisy observations of low-rank matrices with\na shared singular subspace. In this case, two primary methods have emerged for\nestimating this shared structure, which vary in how they integrate information\nacross datasets. The first approach, termed Stack-SVD, concatenates all the\ndatasets, and then performs a singular value decomposition (SVD). The second\napproach, termed SVD-Stack, first performs an SVD separately for each dataset,\nthen aggregates the top singular vectors across these datasets, and finally\ncomputes a consensus amongst them. While these methods are widely used, they\nhave not been rigorously studied in the proportional asymptotic regime, which\nis of great practical relevance in today's world of increasing data size and\ndimensionality. This lack of theoretical understanding has led to uncertainty\nabout which method to choose and limited the ability to fully exploit their\npotential. To address these challenges, we derive exact expressions for the\nasymptotic performance and phase transitions of these two methods and develop\noptimal weighting schemes to further improve both methods. Our analysis reveals\nthat while neither method uniformly dominates the other in the unweighted case,\noptimally weighted Stack-SVD dominates optimally weighted SVD-Stack. We extend\nour analysis to accommodate multiple shared components, and provide practical\nalgorithms for estimating optimal weights from data, offering theoretical\nguidance for method selection in practical data integration problems. Extensive\nnumerical simulations and semi-synthetic experiments on genomic data\ncorroborate our theoretical findings.",

Based on this idea Bell constructed an inequality whereby\nexperimental tests could distinguish between quantum mechanics and\nlocal-realistic theories. Many experiments have since been done that are\nconsistent with quantum mechanics, disproving the concept of local realism. But\nall these tests suffered from loopholes allowing a local-realistic explanation\nof the experimental observations. In this context, of special interest is\nentanglement between different quantum objects like atoms and photons, because\nit allows one to entangle distant atoms by the interference of photons. The\nresulting space-like separation together with the almost perfect detection\nefficiency of the atoms will allow a first event-ready Bell test closing\ndetection and locality loopholes.\n  The primary goal of the present thesis was the experimental realization of\nentanglement between a single localized atom and a single spontaneously emitted\nphoton. In the experiment a single optically trapped R87 atom is excited to a\nstate which has two selected decay channels. In the following spontaneous decay\na photon is emitted coherently with equal probability into both decay channels.\nThis accounts for perfect correlations between the polarization state of the\nemitted photon and the Zeeman state of the atom after spontaneous decay.\nBecause these decay channels are spectrally and in all other degrees of freedom\nindistinguishable, the spin state of the atom is entangled with the\npolarization state of the photon. To verify entanglement, appropriate\ncorrelation measurements in complementary bases of the photon polarization and\nthe internal quantum state of the atom were performed. It is shown, that the\ngenerated atom-photon state yields an entanglement fidelity of 0.82.",

    "abstract": "We analyze the two-photon emission process of a uniformly accelerated\nUnruh-DeWitt detector interacting with a massless scalar field in Minkowski\nspacetime. Using second-order perturbation theory, we derive the exact final\nquantum state of the field and classify the emitted photon pairs according to\ntheir directional decomposition into Unruh modes: right-right (RR), left-left\n(LL), and mixed (RL/LR) channels. The RR and LL contributions produce photon\npairs within a single Rindler wedge, while RL and LR emissions generate\nentanglement across wedges. The first emission arises from a counter-rotating\n(Unruh) excitation, followed by a rotating Wigner-Weisskopf-like decay. Our\nresults reveal how acceleration imprints entanglement and thermal structure on\nthe radiation, offering new insight into quantum field theory in non-inertial\nframes and potential applications in relativistic quantum information.",

A catalogue of questions to initiate discussions with potential\nPhD students which allowed them to explore these factors was developed and\ntranslated to 8 languages. Encouraging factors toward PhD study include\ninterest and confidence in research arising from a research involvement during\nearlier studies; enthusiasm for and self-confidence in CS in addition to an\ninterest in an academic career; encouragement from external sources; and a\npositive perception towards PhD studies which can involve achieving personal\ngoals. Discouraging factors include uncertainty and lack of knowledge of the\nPhD process, a perception of lower job flexibility, and the requirement for\nlong-term commitment.

Deep learning (DL)-based segmentation\noffers promising tools for tumour delineation, yet its performance across\nheterogeneous PBT subtypes and MRI protocols remains uncertain. Methods A\nretrospective single-centre cohort of 174 paediatric patients with HGG, LGG,\nmedulloblastomas (MB), ependymomas, and other rarer subtypes was used.

    "abstract": "Quantum evolutions are often non-unitary and in such cases, they are\nfrequently regarded as lossy. Such lossiness, however, does not necessarily\npersist throughout the evolution, and there can often be intermediate\ntime-spans during which information ebbs in the environment to re-flood the\nsystem -- an event known as information backflow. This phenomenon serves as a\nwell-established and sufficient indicator of non-Markovian behavior of open\nquantum dynamics. Nevertheless, not all non-Markovian dynamics exhibit such\nbackflow. We find that when interference is allowed between two quantum\nevolutions that individually generate non-Markovianity and yet do not exhibit\ninformation backflow, it becomes possible to retrieve information from the\nenvironment. Furthermore, we show that this setup involving\ncoherently-controlled quantum operation trajectories provides enhanced\nperformance and is more robust compared to an alternate coherently-controlled\narrangement of the quantum switch.",

For this, we analyzed the signal strength variations in the\nconsidered RIS-aided networks, considering the radiative NF and FF regions, and\nderive the probability density function (PDF) of the RIS-UE distance in the NF\nregion to quantify RIS reflection gains along the user equipment (UE)\ntrajectory.

The proposed\nalgorithm uses bit error rate (BER) as a key parameter to predict the\nminimization of unnecessary HOs by using RIS-aided pathways to retain\nconnectivity with the serving base station (BS), which minimizes the\nrequirement for frequent target BS searching and ultimately optimizes the HO.\nBy restricting measurement reports and HO requests, the suggested method\nimproves spectrum efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE), especially in\ncrowded cellular networks.

We introduce here a class of\nmaterials -- superconducting altermagnets -- that can both generate and carry\npersistent {\\em spin} currents. This includes spin-polarized electrical\nsupercurrent as well as pure spin supercurrent that facilitates spin transport\nin the absence of any charge transport. A key to this remarkable property is\nthe realization that the leading superconducting instability of altermagnetic\nmetals consists of two independent condensates formed of spin-up and spin-down\nelectrons. In the non-relativistic limit the two condensates are decoupled and\ncan thus naturally support persistent currents with any spin polarization,\nincluding pure spin supercurrents realized in the charge counterflow regime. We\ndescribe a novel ``spin-current dynamo effect'' that can be used to generate\npure spin supercurrent in such systems by driving a charge current along\ncertain crystallographic directions. Away from the non-relativistic limit, when\nspin-orbit interactions and magnetic disorder are present, we find that the\nspin current generically develops spatial oscillations but, importantly, no\ndissipation or decay.

Intents -- low-level strategies or preferences for achieving a\nwriting goal -- are often vague, fluid, or even subconscious, making it\ndifficult for users to articulate and adjust them. To address this, we present\nIntentFlow, which supports the communication of dynamically evolving intents\nthroughout LLM-assisted writing. IntentFlow extracts goals and intents from\nuser prompts and presents them as editable interface components, which users\ncan revise, remove, or refine via direct manipulation or follow-up prompts.\nVisual links connect each component to the output segments it influences,\nhelping users understand model behavior. In a within-subjects study (N=12),\nparticipants using IntentFlow, compared to a chat-based baseline, expressed\ntheir intents more easily and in detail, engaged in more meaningful actions to\ncommunicate intents, such as adjusting and deleting, and produced outputs that\nbetter aligned with their evolving intents. We found that editable intent\nrepresentations help users refine and consolidate a final set of intents, which\ncan be reused across similar tasks to support consistent and transferable\nLLM-assisted writing.",

    "abstract": "In recent decades the field of quantum computation has seen remarkable\ndevelopment. While much progress has been made toward the realization of a\nfully digital, scalable, and fault tolerant quantum computer, there are still\nmany essential challenges to overcome. In the interim, direct emulation of\nquantum systems of interest can fill an important gap not only for exploring\nfundamental questions about many-body physics and the quantum to classical\ntransition, but also for potentially providing alternative methods to verify\nresults from quantum simulations. In this work we will demonstrate a method\nutilizing closed loop control of the collective magnetic moment of an ensemble\nof cold neutral atoms via non-destructive measurements to emulate various spin\nsystem Hamiltonians. By modifying the feedback control law appropriately we are\nable to generate nonlinear dynamical behavior in the ensemble, allowing us to\nexplore the physics of collective spin systems at mesoscopic scales. Moreover,\ncontrolling the number of atoms in the collective spin can potentially allow us\nto investigate these dynamics in the transition from fully quantum to the\nclassical limit. In particular, we emulate two models: the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick\n(LMG) Hamiltonian, and a closely related model, the Kicked Top. In the former\ncase, we show that our system undergoes a symmetry-breaking phase transition in\nthe expected parameter regime. In the latter, we explore two interesting\naspects: the formation of chaos, and a dynamically driven time crystal phase.\nWe will then discuss the advantages and limits of this approach.",

In\nthis work, we formulate a critical theory for a continuous transition at the\nfilling $\\nu=\\frac{2}{3}$ between the FL and a FCI* phase that hosts an\nadditional neutral sector, but has the same transport signatures as the usual\nFCI. In our framework, this corresponds to a transition from a composite Fermi\nliquid (CFL) to a superfluid* phase of the composite bosons. The Fermi liquid\nclose to the transition has an additional factor $|z_i-z_j|^6$ in its\nwavefunction.

In this\nwork, we present a general framework for studying the complexity of circuits in\ngeneric Lie groups, where penalty factors assign relative weights to different\ngenerators. Our approach constructs a metric on the coset space of quantum\nstates, induced from a (pseudo-)Riemannian norm on the space of unitary\ncircuits. The geodesics of this metric are interpreted as optimal circuits. The\nmethod builds on the formalism of (pseudo-)Riemannian submersions and connects\nnaturally to other prescriptions in the literature, including cost function\nminimization along stabilizer directions and constructions based on coadjoint\norbits. As a concrete application, we compute state complexity for states in\none- and two-dimensional CFTs. For specific choices of penalty factors, our\nprescription yields a positive-definite metric with a viable interpretation as\ncomplexity; in other cases, the resulting metric is indefinite. In the viable\nregime, we derive analytic results when a specific penalty factor is turned\noff, develop perturbative expansions for small values of the penalty factors,\nand provide numerical results in the general case.

By stacking haloes in\nbins of halo mass, redshift, mass-dependent properties such as peak height and\nconcentration, and halo formation history, we measure the shape of the\nlogarithmic slope of the density profile of dark matter haloes. Our results\nshow that the splashback depth has a strong dependence on the halo mass which\nfollows a power law $\\mathcal{D}\\propto\\left(\\log_{10}M\\right)^{2.8}$.\nProperties with strong correlation with halo mass demonstrate similar\ndependence.

We provide the\nfitting functions of the splashback depth and width in terms of halo mass,\nredshift, peak height, concentrations and halo formation time. The depth and\nwidth are therefore considered to be a long term memory tracker of haloes since\nthey depend more on accumulative physical properties, e.g., halo mass, peak\nheight and halo formation time. They are shaped primarily by the halo's\nassembly history, which exerts a stronger influence on the inner density\nprofile than short-term dynamical processes. In contrast, the splashback\nfeatures have little dependence on the short term factors such as halo mass\naccretion rate and most recent major merger time. The splashback depth and\nwidth can therefore be used to complement information gained from quantities\nlike the point of steepest slope or truncation radius to characterise the\nhalo's history and inner structure.",

By performing linear regression\nbetween these fields across multiple sky patches, we directly estimate the\nbirefringence angle at the field level. This allows us to distinguish cosmic\nbirefringence from polarization angle miscalibration and foreground\ncontamination, as the ILC responds differently to achromatic cosmic\nbirefringence and chromatic systematic effects, with its weights projecting\nspatial or harmonic dependence only onto the latter. This non-parametric,\nfield-level approach provides a novel way to probe cosmic birefringence\ndirectly in real space. When applied to realistic simulations of the\nforthcoming LiteBIRD satellite mission, our method yields constraints that are\ncompetitive with, and complementary to, existing power spectrum-based analyses.\nWhen applied to Planck Release 4 (PR4) data, we find a birefringence angle of\n$\\beta = 0.32^\\circ \\pm 0.12^\\circ$, a $2.7\\sigma$ detection that remains\nrobust against varying sky fractions.",

We provide a systematic theory derivation based on power\ncounting, which features the first comprehensive treatment of stochastic EFT\ncontributions -- these are found to significantly improve the match to data.\nOur computational pipeline utilizes the COBRA technique that expands the linear\nmatter power spectrum over a basis of principal components based on a singular\nvalue decomposition, allowing the cosmology dependence to be captured to\nsub-permille accuracy with just eight templates. This transforms the problem of\ncomputing the one-loop EFT bispectrum to a simple tensor multiplication,\nreducing the computation time to around a second per cosmology with negligible\nloss of accuracy. Using these tools, we study the cosmological information in\nthe bispectrum by analyzing PTChallenge simulations, whose gigantic volume\nprovides the most powerful test of the one-loop EFT bispectrum so far. We find\nthat the one-loop prediction provides an excellent match to the bispectrum data\nup to $k_{\\rm max}=0.15~h$ Mpc$^{-1}$, as evidenced by the precise recovery of\nthe dark matter density $\\omega_\\text{cdm}$, Hubble constant $H_0$, and mass\nfluctuation amplitude $\\sigma_8$ parameters, and the amplitude of equilateral\nprimordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) $f_{\\rm NL}^{\\rm equil}$.

Neutral\natoms in optical lattices have emerged as a leading computing platform, with\ncollisional gates offering a stable mechanism for quantum logic. However,\nprevious experiments have treated ultracold collisions as a dynamically\nfine-tuned process, which obscures the underlying quantum- geometry and\nstatistics crucial for realising intrinsically robust operations. Here, we\npropose and experimentally demonstrate a purely geometric two-qubit swap gate\nby transiently populating qubit doublon states of fermionic atoms in a\ndynamical optical lattice. The presence of these doublon states, together with\nfermionic exchange anti-symmetry, enables a two-particle quantum holonomy -- a\ngeometric evolution where dynamical phases are absent. This yields a gate\nmechanism that is intrinsically protected against fluctuations and\ninhomogeneities of the confining potentials. The resilience of the gate is\nfurther reinforced by time-reversal and chiral symmetries of the Hamiltonian.\nWe experimentally validate this exceptional protection, achieving a\nloss-corrected amplitude fidelity of $99.91(7)\\%$ measured across the entire\nsystem consisting of more than $17'000$ atom pairs.

Many approaches\nhave been proposed to mitigate or avoid the barren plateau phenomenon or, more\nbroadly, exponential concentration. However, due to the intricate interplay\nbetween quantum measurements and classical post-processing, we argue these\ntechniques often fail to circumvent concentration effects in practice.

However, validating these models remains a key challenge. We present a\nsystematic two-stage validation approach using social dilemma paradigms from\npsychological literature, first identifying the cognitive components necessary\nfor LLM agents to reproduce known human behaviors in mixed-motive settings from\ntwo landmark papers, then using the validated architecture to simulate novel\nconditions. Our model comparison of different cognitive architectures shows\nthat both persona-based individual differences and theory of mind capabilities\nare essential for replicating third-party punishment (TPP) as a costly signal\nof trustworthiness. For the second study on public goods games, this\narchitecture is able to replicate an increase in cooperation from the spread of\nreputational information through gossip. However, an additional strategic\ncomponent is necessary to replicate the additional boost in cooperation rates\nin the condition that allows both ostracism and gossip. We then test novel\npredictions for each paper with our validated generative agents. We find that\nTPP rates significantly drop in settings where punishment is anonymous, yet a\nsubstantial amount of TPP persists, suggesting that both reputational and\nintrinsic moral motivations play a role in this behavior.

At such late cooling times, both the state of matter assumed for ions\nin the treatment of element diffusion and the thickness of the outer H envelope\nbecome important considerations for modelling white dwarf cooling. Using the\nstellar evolution software Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics\n(MESA), we created a suite of white dwarf cooling models for different\ntreatments of element diffusion, as well as different values of the white dwarf\nmass and H envelope thickness parameters. Three different diffusion scenarios\nwere considered: i) the standard MESA implementation, which implicitly uses an\nideal gas approximation for the ions, ii) a custom modified implementation that\naccounts for non-ideal gas effects, and iii) no diffusion. An unbinned\nlikelihood analysis was performed to compare these cooling models to the\nobservations. This work both constrains the values of parameters important for\nmodelling white dwarf cooling and tests the implementation of element diffusion\nin MESA to late cooling times.

    "abstract": "In the era of big data and artificial intelligence, the increasing volume of\ndata and the demand to solve more and more complex computational challenges are\ntwo driving forces for improving the efficiency of data storage, processing and\nanalysis. Quantum image processing (QIP) is an interdisciplinary field between\nquantum information science and image processing, which has the potential to\nalleviate some of these challenges by leveraging the power of quantum\ncomputing. In this work, we compare and examine the compression properties of\nfour different Quantum Image Representations (QImRs): namely, Tensor Network\nRepresentation (TNR), Flexible Representation of Quantum Image (FRQI), Novel\nEnhanced Quantum Representation NEQR, and Quantum Probability Image Encoding\n(QPIE). Our simulations show that FRQI performs a higher compression of image\ninformation than TNR, NEQR, and QPIE. Furthermore, we investigate the trade-off\nbetween accuracy and memory in binary classification problems, evaluating the\nperformance of quantum kernels based on QImRs compared to the classical linear\nkernel. Our results indicate that quantum kernels provide comparable\nclassification average accuracy but require exponentially fewer resources for\nimage storage.",

    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has led to\nbreakthroughs in various applications, yet their security remains a critical\nchallenge. One pressing issue involves unsafe image-query pairs--jailbreak\ninputs specifically designed to bypass security constraints and elicit\nunintended responses from MLLMs. Compared to general multimodal data, such\nunsafe inputs are relatively sparse, which limits the diversity and richness of\ntraining samples available for developing robust defense models. Meanwhile,\nexisting guardrail-type methods rely on external modules to enforce security\nconstraints but fail to address intrinsic vulnerabilities within MLLMs.\nTraditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT), on the other hand, often over-refuses\nharmless inputs, compromising general performance. Given these challenges, we\npropose Secure Tug-of-War (SecTOW), an innovative iterative defense-attack\ntraining method to enhance the security of MLLMs. SecTOW consists of two\nmodules: a defender and an auxiliary attacker, both trained iteratively using\nreinforcement learning (GRPO). During the iterative process, the attacker\nidentifies security vulnerabilities in the defense model and expands jailbreak\ndata. The expanded data are then used to train the defender, enabling it to\naddress identified security vulnerabilities. We also design reward mechanisms\nused for GRPO to simplify the use of response labels, reducing dependence on\ncomplex generative labels and enabling the efficient use of synthetic data.\nAdditionally, a quality monitoring mechanism is used to mitigate the defender's\nover-refusal of harmless inputs and ensure the diversity of the jailbreak data\ngenerated by the attacker. Experimental results on safety-specific and general\nbenchmarks demonstrate that SecTOW significantly improves security while\npreserving general performance.",

To make our kinetic studies useful to modelers, we\nimplemented a Monte Carlo method based program to generate and optimize random\ninitial fit parameters (alpha, beta, gamma, and T0) to achieve the\nstatistically best fit. We find that indene hydrogenation follows rules similar\nto those of other PAHs, such as pentacene, coronene, and corannulene, with\nbinding energies for odd numbered hydrogenation steps ranging from 0.5 to 2 eV\nand barriers around 0.13 eV for the first, fifth, and seventh hydrogenation\nsteps. The third hydrogenation step is the rate limiting step, similar to what\nis found for other PAHs. Even numbered hydrogenation steps have lower barriers\nand lead to more stable intermediates as a result of radical recombinations.\nThe hydrogenation sequence follows a scheme that strongly depends on the PAH's\nshape, the number of aromatic rings, and the presence of five membered rings.\nFurthermore, we observe that tunneling plays an important role in the\nhydrogenation of indene at temperatures between 30 and 75 K, which corresponds\nto the temperatures of dust in PDRs.",

However, multiwavelength observations of compact\nstars in the last 50 years have not yet led to an unambiguous SQS\nidentification. This article explores whether SQSs could form in the supernova\n(SN) explosion of an evolved star (e.g., carbon-oxygen, or Wolf-Rayet)\noccurring in a binary with the companion being a neutron star (NS). The\ncollapse of the iron core of the evolved star generates a newborn NS and the SN\nexplosion. Part of the ejected matter accretes onto the NS companion as well as\nonto the newborn NS via matter fallback. The accretion occurs at hypercritical\n(highly super-Eddington) rates, transferring mass and angular momentum to the\nstars. We present numerical simulations of this scenario and demonstrate that\nthe density increase in the NS interiors during the accretion process may\ninduce quark matter deconfinement, suggesting the possibility of SQS formation.\nWe discuss the astrophysical conditions under which such a transformation may\noccur and possible consequences.",

    "abstract": "While $1+1$ dimensional growth models in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality\nclass have witnessed an explosion of activity, higher dimensional models remain\nmuch less explored. The special case of $2+1$ dimensions is particularly\ninteresting as it is, in physics parlance, neither ultraviolet nor infrared\nsuper-renormalizable. Canonical examples include the stochastic heat equation\n(SHE) with multiplicative noise and directed polymers. The models exhibit a\nweak to strong disorder transition as the inverse temperature, up to a\nlogarithmic (in the system size) scaling, crosses a critical value. While the\nsub-critical picture has been established in detail, very recently [CSZ '23]\nconstructed a scaling limit of the critical $2+1$ dimensional directed polymer\npartition function, termed as the critical $2d$ Stochastic Heat Flow (SHF), a\nrandom measure on $\\mathbb{R}^2.$ The SHF is expected to exhibit a rich\nintermittent behavior and consequently a rapid growth of its moments. The\n$h^{th}$ moment was known to grow at least as $\\exp(\\Omega(h^{2}))$ (a\nconsequence of the Gaussian correlation inequality) and at most as $\\exp(\\exp\n(O(h^2)))$. The true growth rate, however, was predicted to be $\\exp(\\exp\n(\\Theta(h)))$ in the late nineties [R '99]. In this paper we prove a lower\nbound of the $h^{th}$ moment which matches the predicted value, thereby\nexponentially improving the previous lower bound. We also obtain rather sharp\nbounds on its upper tail. The key ingredient in the proof involves establishing\na new connection of the SHF and moments thereof to the Gaussian Free Field\n(GFF) on related Feynman diagrams. This connection opens the door to the rich\nalgebraic structure of the GFF to study the SHF. Along the way we also prove a\nnew monotonicity property of the correlation kernel for the SHF as a\nconsequence of the domain Markov property of the GFF.",

It maintains the\ngeneralizability acquired from large-scale real-world videos while enhancing\nits interactivity through RL in simulation environments. Specifically, we\nintroduce two innovations: an Anchor-Guided Distribution Matching strategy,\nwhich stabilizes learning and models diverse motion patterns through\nanchor-based supervision; and a Residual-Attention Module, which obtains\nreactive behaviors from simulation environments without erasing the model's\npretrained knowledge. Moreover, we establish a comprehensive end-to-end\nevaluation benchmark, NavBench-GS, built on photorealistic 3DGS reconstructions\nof real-world scenes that incorporate physical interactions. It can\nsystematically assess the generalizability and safety of navigation foundation\nmodels. Extensive experiments show that S2E mitigates the diminishing returns\noften seen when scaling with offline data alone. We perform a thorough analysis\nof the benefits of Reinforcement Learning compared to Supervised Fine-Tuning in\nthe context of post-training for robot learning. Our findings emphasize the\ncrucial role of integrating interactive online experiences to effectively scale\nfoundation models in Robotics.",

Yet, RT simulation accuracy is often limited by insufficient\nmeasurement data and a lack of systematic validation. This paper presents\nsite-specific location calibration and validation of NYURay, NYU's in-house ray\ntracer, at upper mid-band frequencies (6.75 GHz and 16.95 GHz). We propose a\nlocation calibration algorithm that corrects GPS-induced position errors by\noptimizing transmitter-receiver (TX-RX) locations to align simulated and\nmeasured power delay profiles, improving TX-RX location accuracy by 42.3% for\nline-of-sight (LOS) and 13.5% for non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios.\nValidation across 18 TX-RX locations shows excellent RT accuracy in path loss\nprediction, with path loss exponent (PLE) deviations under 0.14. While RT\nunderestimates delay spread and angular spreads, their cumulative distributions\nremain statistically similar. The validated NYURay advances RT validation and\nprovides reliable channel statistics for 6G deployment.",

As one\nbuilding block of this method, we propose a novel point-shifting mechanism to\nintroduce perturbations in point cloud data. Recently, AI has seen an\nexponential growth. Hence, it is important to understand the decision-making\nprocess of AI algorithms when they are applied in critical areas. Our work\nfocuses on explaining AI algorithms that classify point cloud data. An\nimportant aspect of the methods used for explaining AI algorithms is their\nability to produce explanations that are easy for humans to understand. This\nallows them to analyze the AI algorithms better and make appropriate decisions\nbased on that analysis. Therefore, in this work, we intend to generate\nmeaningful explanations that can be easily interpreted by humans. The point\ncloud data we consider represents 3D objects such as cars, guitars, and\nlaptops. We make use of point cloud segmentation models to generate\nexplanations for the working of classification models. The segments are used to\nintroduce perturbations into the input point cloud data and generate saliency\nmaps. The perturbations are introduced using the novel point-shifting mechanism\nproposed in this work which ensures that the shifted points no longer influence\nthe output of the classification algorithm. In contrast to previous methods,\nthe segments used by our method are meaningful, i.e. humans can easily\ninterpret the meaning of the segments. Thus, the benefit of our method over\nother methods is its ability to produce more meaningful saliency maps. We\ncompare our method with the use of classical clustering algorithms to generate\nexplanations. We also analyze the saliency maps generated for example inputs\nusing our method to demonstrate the usefulness of the method in generating\nmeaningful explanations.",

From\ndensity functional perturbation theory (DFPT) calculations, we have found that\nFeSb2 remains dynamically stable up to 10 GPa, evidenced by positive phonon\nfrequencies. Our spin-polarised band structure shows that the node of band\ncrossing between spin-up and spin-down bands around the Fermi energy exactly\nlies at the Gamma and A-symmetry points. The Fermi crossing is mostly exhibited\nby band-24, band-25 and band-26. The non-relativistic spin-splitting (NRSS)\nalong M'-Gamma-M and A-Z-A' symmetry is attributed to the broken time-reversal\n(PT ) symmetry. There are significant changes in the band profile under applied\npressure, as one can see the shifting of the node of band-24 and band-26\ntowards the lower energy side. The NRSS exhibited by band-24 along M'-Gamma-M\nsymmetry is notably small. Although the strength of NRSS of band-26 along\nA-Z-A' symmetry is significant but reduces under applied pressure. The\nanomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) values are prominent in -1 to 1 eV range. A\nsharp peaked and positive AHC values at ambient pressure, becomes spectrally\nbroadened and negative at 10 GPa due to pressure-induced band crossings and\nredistribution of Berry curvature near the Fermi level. We have observed that\nthe values of spin hall conductivity (SHC) are around 2-2.5 times lower as\ncompared to AHC and prominent in between -1.0 eV to 1.0 eV. Our results\nestablish FeSb2 as a tunable altermagnetic candidate where pressure can\nmodulate both topological transport and dynamic stability, offering\nopportunities for strain-engineered Hall responses in compensated magnetic\nsystems.",

    "abstract": "The algebraic connectivity $a(G)$ of a graph $G$ is defined as the second\nsmallest eigenvalue of its Laplacian matrix $L(G)$. It also admits a\nvariational characterization as the minimum of a quadratic form associated with\n$L(G)$, subject to $l_2$-norm constraints. In 2024, Andrade and Dahl\ninvestigated an analogous parameter $\\gamma(G)$, defined using the\n$l_\\infty$-norm instead of the $l_2$-norm. They demonstrated that $\\gamma(G)$\ncan be computed in polynomial time using linear programming. In this article,\nwe study the combinatorial significance of $\\gamma(G)$, revealing that it can\nbe efficiently computed using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. We show\nthat $\\gamma (G)$ characterizes the connectedness of the graph $G$. We further\nestablish new bounds on $\\gamma(G)$, and analyze the graphs that attain\nextremal values. Finally, we derive an elegant formula for $\\gamma(G)$ when $G$\nis the Cartesian product of finitely many graphs. Applying this formula, we\nexplicitly compute $\\gamma(G)$ for various families of graphs, including\nhypercube graphs, Hamming graphs, and others.",

We model LRDs as\nsuper-massive stars (SMSs) surrounded by massive self-gravitating accretion\ndiscs (SMDs) that form as a consequence of gas-rich major galaxy mergers. The\nmodel provides an excellent match for numerous spectral features of LRDs, where\nthe V-shape arises from the superposition of two black bodies, and Balmer line\nbroadening is sourced by the intrinsic rotation of the SMD. No additional AGN,\nstellar wind, dust obscuration or galactic component is required.

We perform MCMC fits for two\nrepresentative LRD spectra, for which the full parameter posterior\ndistributions are determined. Allowing for a compressed SMS mass-radius\nrelation, the recovered parameters are compatible with sub-Eddington accretion\nin self-gravitating discs, and the recovered SMS masses of few $ 10^6$\nM$_{\\odot}$ imply the subsequent formation of massive black holes (BH) that\nsquarely follow the expected BH mass--galaxy mass relation.

This regime differs fundamentally from the\ntraditional case $q\\sim e^{-c/L}\\to1$, in which random tilings are locally\ngoverned by two-dimensional translation-invariant ergodic Gibbs measures. In\nthe fixed-q regime we uncover a new macroscopic phase, the waterfall\n(previously only observed experimentally), where the two-dimensional Gibbs\nstructure collapses into a one-dimensional random stepped interface that we\ncall a barcode. We prove a law of large numbers and exponential concentration,\nshowing that the random tilings converge to a deterministic waterfall profile.\nWe further conjecture an explicit correlation kernel of the one-dimensional\nbarcode process arising in the limit. Remarkably, the limit is invariant under\nshifts by $2\\mathbb{Z}$ but not by $\\mathbb{Z}$, exhibiting an emergent\nperiod-two structure absent from the original weights. Our conjectures are\nsupported by extensive numerical evidence and perfect sampling simulations. The\nkernel is built from a family of functions orthogonal in both spaces\n$\\ell^{2}(\\mathbb{Z})$ and $\\ell^{2}(\\mathbb{Z}+\\frac12)$, that may be of\nindependent interest. Our proofs adapt the spectral projection method of\nBorodin-Gorin-Rains (arXiv:0905.0679) to the regime with fixed~q. The resulting\nasymptotic analysis is substantially more involved, and leads to\nnon-self-adjoint operators.

We further strengthen Robinson's method by proving that fairly general\nvolume growth curves can be realized by stratified spaces.

Staining, also known as\nwatermarking, embeds secret behaviour into a model which can later be used to\nidentify it, while locking aims to make a model unusable unless a secret\ntrigger is inserted into input images. Unlike existing methods, our algorithms\ncan be used to stain and lock pre-trained models without requiring fine-tuning\nor retraining, and come with provable, computable guarantees bounding their\nworst-case false positive rates. The stain and lock are implemented by directly\nmodifying a small number of the model's weights and have minimal impact on the\n(unlocked) model's performance. Locked models are unlocked by inserting a small\n`trigger patch' into the corner of the input image. We present experimental\nresults showing the efficacy of our methods and demonstrating their practical\nperformance on a variety of computer vision models.",

    "abstract": "Empirical research in many social disciplines involves constructs that are\nnot directly observable, such as behaviors. To model them, constructs must be\noperationalized using their relations with indicators. Structural equation\nmodeling (SEM) is the primary approach for this purpose. In SEM, three types of\nconstructs are distinguished: latent variables, causal-formative constructs,\nand composites. To estimate the parameters of the different models, various\nestimators have been developed. Many Monte Carlo studies have examined the\nestimation performances of different estimators for the construct types. One\naspect evaluated is the consequences of construct misspecification - when the\ntrue construct type differs from the modeling choice - on parameter estimates\nand model fit. For example, parameter bias in models that misspecify latent\nvariables as composites is often attributed to the chosen estimator, although\nmodel parameters depend on different estimators, making it impossible to\nexamine the factors individually. This article aims to disentangle the issues\nof construct misspecification and parameter estimation by a comprehensive Monte\nCarlo study of all combinations between true and assumed construct types. To\nfocus on misspecification, we used the same estimator for all models, namely\nthe maximum likelihood (ML) estimator. To generalize beyond ML, we replicated\nthe simulation using another estimator. We aim to examine the role of construct\nmisspecification, not estimator choice, on the estimation performance and show\nthat misspecification leads indeed to biased path coefficient estimates.\nFurther, we evaluate whether fit measures can distinguish models with correct\nfrom those with misspecified constructs. We find that none of the criteria\nconsidered is suited for this. These findings stress the importance of\nthoughtful construct specification and the need for further research.",

Although the quality of graphene devices has also been improving,\nit remains comparatively lower. Here we report a transformative improvement in\nthe electronic quality of graphene by employing graphite gates placed in its\nimmediate proximity, at 1 nm separation. The resulting screening reduces charge\ninhomogeneity by two orders of magnitude, bringing it down to a few 10$^7$\ncm$^-2$ and limiting potential fluctuations to less than 1 meV. Quantum\nmobilities reach 10$^7$ cm$^2$/Vs, surpassing those in the highest-quality\nsemiconductor heterostructures by an order of magnitude, and the transport\nmobilities match their record. This quality enables Shubnikov-de Haas\noscillations in fields as low as 1 mT and quantum Hall plateaus below 5 mT.\nAlthough proximity screening predictably suppresses electron-electron\ninteractions, fractional quantum Hall states remain observable with their\nenergy gaps reduced only by a factor of 3-5 compared to unscreened devices,\ndemonstrating that many-body phenomena at spatial scales shorter than 10 nm\nremain robust.

The destabilizing influence of radial magnetic fields, which are\npresent locally and which may promote fragmentation via magnetic tension\neffects, is overwhelmed by magnetic elevation, which significantly reduces the\nmid-plane density.

The literature is rather rich in NP-completeness\nresults and polynomial time solvable cases. However, to the best of our\nknowledge, only a few exact algorithms have been suggested to address NP-hard\ncases. In this work, we propose exact solution methods based on integer\nprogramming for three perfect graph modification problems: minimum perfect\nediting, minimum perfect completion and the perfect sandwich problem. The\nminimum perfect editing problem inquires the smallest number of edge additions\nand deletions to make a graph perfect, while the completion problem allows only\nedge additions. In the perfect sandwich problem, only a given subset of\nnon-edges can be changed to edges, and the problem asks whether a perfect graph\ncan be obtained in this way. The proposed methods are based on the Strong\nPerfect Graph Theorem. We represent odd holes and odd antiholes as linear\ninequalities, and formulate an integer programming model to solve minimum\nperfect editing problem. To address the exponential number of constraints, we\npropose a cutting plane algorithm which relies on finding odd holes and odd\nantiholes. To enhance the practical efficiency of the cutting plane algorithm,\nwe address the expected number of odd holes and odd antiholes in random graphs.\nIn addition, we propose a heuristic algorithm to make a given graph perfect,\nwhich is used to obtain improved upper bounds for the editing and the\ncompletion problems.

In this work, we investigate the implications of a specific non-local\ngravity (NLG) theory, which modifies General Relativity by introducing\nnon-local effects that manifest as an effective dark matter component. We\nanalyze the velocity dispersion profiles of eight classical dwarf spheroidal\n(dSph) galaxies - Carina, Draco, Fornax, Leo I, Leo II, Sculptor, Sextans, and\nUrsa Minor - to test the predictions of NLG. Using the Jeans equation, we model\nthe kinematics of these galaxies and perform a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte\nCarlo analysis to constrain the parameters of the NLG kernel chosen for our\nanalysis. Our results indicate that NLG might successfully reproduce the\nobserved kinematics of dSph galaxies without requiring particle dark matter,\nproviding constraints on the scale-dependent modifications to gravity that are\ncompatible with previous studies in the literature. However, a parameter\ninconsistency remains in the cases of Fornax and Sextans galaxies that requires\nfurther attention.",

    "abstract": "Networks of phase oscillators can serve as dense associative memories if they\nincorporate higher-order coupling beyond the classical Kuramoto model's\npairwise interactions. Here we introduce a generalized Kuramoto model with\ncombined second-harmonic (pairwise) and fourth-harmonic (quartic) coupling,\ninspired by dense Hopfield memory theory. Using mean-field theory and its\ndynamical approximation, we obtain a phase diagram for dense associative memory\nmodel that exhibits a tricritical point at which the continuous onset of memory\nretrieval is supplanted by a discontinuous, hysteretic transition. In the\nquartic-dominated regime, the system supports bistable phase-locked states\ncorresponding to stored memory patterns, with a sizable energy barrier between\nmemory and incoherent states. We analytically determine this bistable region\nand show that the escape time from a memory state (due to noise) grows\nexponentially with network size, indicating robust storage. Extending the\ntheory to finite memory load, we show that higher-order couplings achieve\nsuperlinear scaling of memory capacity with system size, far exceeding the\nlimit of pairwise-only oscillators. Large-scale simulations of the oscillator\nnetwork confirm our theoretical predictions, demonstrating rapid pattern\nretrieval and robust storage of many phase patterns.

LLMs are pre-trained\non vast text data to learn general language patterns, but a subsequent\npost-training phase is critical to align them for specific real-world tasks.\nReinforcement learning (RL) is the leading post-training technique, yet its\neconomic impact remains largely underexplored and unquantified. We examine this\nquestion through the lens of the first deployment of an RL-trained LLM for\ngenerative advertising on Facebook. Integrated into Meta's Text Generation\nfeature, our model, \"AdLlama,\" powers an AI tool that helps advertisers create\nnew variations of human-written ad text. To train this model, we introduce\nreinforcement learning with performance feedback (RLPF), a post-training method\nthat uses historical ad performance data as a reward signal. In a large-scale\n10-week A/B test on Facebook spanning nearly 35,000 advertisers and 640,000 ad\nvariations, we find that AdLlama improves click-through rates by 6.7%\n(p=0.0296) compared to a supervised imitation model trained on curated ads.\nThis represents a substantial improvement in advertiser return on investment on\nFacebook. We also find that advertisers who used AdLlama generated more ad\nvariations, indicating higher satisfaction with the model's outputs. To our\nknowledge, this is the largest study to date on the use of generative AI in an\necologically valid setting, offering an important data point quantifying the\ntangible impact of RL post-training. Furthermore, the results show that RLPF is\na promising and generalizable approach for metric-driven post-training that\nbridges the gap between highly capable language models and tangible outcomes.",

The network\nincludes an Adaptive Event Feature Refinement Module (AEFRM), which improves\nevent representations through multi-scale activity modeling and spatial\nattention. In addition, we introduce a Modality-Adaptive Recalibration Module\n(MARM) and a Multi-Head Attention Gated Fusion Module (MGFM), which align and\nintegrate features across modalities using attention mechanisms and gated\nfusion strategies. Experiments on DDD17-Semantic and DSEC-Semantic datasets\nshow that EIFNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating its\neffectiveness in event-based semantic segmentation.",

    "abstract": "PDS 70c is a source of Ha emission and variable sub-mm signal. Understanding\nits emission mechanisms may enable observations of accretion rates and physical\nconditions in the circum-planetary environment. We report ALMA observations of\nPDS 70 at 145 GHz (Band 4), 343.5 GHz (Band 7) and 671 GHz (Band 9) and compare\nwith data at 97.5 GHz (Band 3), taken within two months. The radio spectrum\n(SED) is analyzed with analytic circumplanetary disk (CPD). In a novel approach\nwe include the free-free continuum from HI, metals (e.g. KI) and H-. New\ndetections in Bands 3 (tentative at 2.6sigma), 4 (5sigma), and 7 (re-detected\nat 9sigma) are consistent with optically thick thermal emission from PDS 70c\n(spectral index alpha 2+-0.2). However, a Band 9 non-detection lies 2.6sigma\nbelow an optically thick extrapolation. A viscous dusty disk is inconsistent\nwith the data, even with the inclusion of ionised jets. Interestingly, the\ncentral temperatures in such CPD models are high enough to ionise HI, with huge\nemission measures and an optically thick spectrum that marginally accounts for\nthe SED (within 3sigma of Band 9). By contrast, uniform-slab models suggest\nmuch lower emission measures to account for the Band 9 drop, with ionisation\nfractions ~1E-7 , and an outer radius of ~0.1au. Such conditions are recovered\nif the CPD interacts with a planetary magnetic field, leading to a radially\nvariable viscosity alpha(R)<~1 and central temperatures ~1E3K that regulate\nmetal ionisation. However, the H- opacity still results in an optically thick\nSED, overshooting Band 9. We find that the optically thin turnover at ~600GHz\nis only recovered if a thin shocked layer is present at the CPD surface, as\nsuggested by simulations. A photospheric shock or accretion funnels are ruled\nout as radio emission sources because their small solid angles require T~1e6K,\nwhich are unrealistic planetary shock accretion.",

    "abstract": "Recently, the field of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) has gained popularity as\nresearchers are trying to develop artificial intelligence capable of efficient\ncollective reasoning. Agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well\nin isolated tasks, yet struggle with higher-order cognition required for\nadaptive collaboration. Human teams achieve synergy not only through knowledge\nsharing, but also through recursive reasoning, structured critique, and the\nability to infer others' mental states. Current artificial systems lack these\nessential mechanisms, limiting their ability to engage in sophisticated\ncollective reasoning. This work explores cognitive processes that enable\neffective collaboration, focusing on adaptive theory of mind (ToM) and\nsystematic critical evaluation. We investigate three key questions. First, how\ndoes the ability to model others' perspectives enhance coordination and reduce\nredundant reasoning? Second, to what extent does structured critique improve\nreasoning quality by identifying logical gaps and mitigating biases? Third, the\ninterplay of these mechanisms can lead to emergent cognitive synergy, where the\ncollective intelligence of the system exceeds the sum of its parts. Through an\nempirical case study on complex decision making, we show that the integration\nof these cognitive mechanisms leads to more coherent, adaptive, and rigorous\nagent interactions. This article contributes to the field of cognitive science\nand AI research by presenting a structured framework that emulates human-like\ncollaborative reasoning MAS. It highlights the significance of dynamic ToM and\ncritical evaluation in advancing multi-agent systems' ability to tackle\ncomplex, real-world challenges.",

To tackle this, we\npropose an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm, where the BS beamformer is\ndesigned using a two-stage iterative method based on successive convex\napproximation (SCA). Additionally, two low-complexity techniques are introduced\nto further reduce the adversarys received power. Simulation results demonstrate\nthat the proposed algorithm effectively improves the covert communication rate,\nhighlighting the potential of near field RSMA-RIS integration in covert\ncommunication.",

    "abstract": "Multilingual programming, which involves using multiple programming languages\n(PLs) in a single project, is increasingly common due to its benefits. However,\nit introduces cross-language bugs (CLBs), which arise from interactions between\ndifferent PLs and are difficult to detect by single-language bug detection\ntools. This paper investigates the potential of pre-trained code language\nmodels (CodeLMs) in CLB detection. We developed CLCFinder, a cross-language\ncode identification tool, and constructed a CLB dataset involving three PL\ncombinations (Python-C/C++, Java-C/C++, and Python-Java) with nine interaction\ntypes. We fine-tuned 13 CodeLMs on this dataset and evaluated their\nperformance, analyzing the effects of dataset size, token sequence length, and\ncode comments. Results show that all CodeLMs performed poorly before\nfine-tuning, but exhibited varying degrees of performance improvement after\nfine-tuning, with UniXcoder-base achieving the best F1 score (0.7407). Notably,\nsmall fine-tuned CodeLMs tended to performe better than large ones. CodeLMs\nfine-tuned on single-language bug datasets performed poorly on CLB detection,\ndemonstrating the distinction between CLBs and single-language bugs.\nAdditionally, increasing the fine-tuning dataset size significantly improved\nperformance, while longer token sequences did not necessarily improve the model\nperformance. The impact of code comments varied across models. Some fine-tuned\nCodeLMs' performance was improved, while others showed degraded performance.",

    "abstract": "The recent advancement of autonomous agents powered by Large Language Models\n(LLMs) has demonstrated significant potential for automating tasks on mobile\ndevices through graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Despite initial progress,\nthese agents still face challenges when handling complex real-world tasks.\nThese challenges arise from a lack of knowledge about real-life mobile\napplications in LLM-based agents, which may lead to ineffective task planning\nand even cause hallucinations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel\nLLM-based agent framework called MapAgent that leverages memory constructed\nfrom historical trajectories to augment current task planning. Specifically, we\nfirst propose a trajectory-based memory mechanism that transforms task\nexecution trajectories into a reusable and structured page-memory database.\nEach page within a trajectory is extracted as a compact yet comprehensive\nsnapshot, capturing both its UI layout and functional context. Secondly, we\nintroduce a coarse-to-fine task planning approach that retrieves relevant pages\nfrom the memory database based on similarity and injects them into the LLM\nplanner to compensate for potential deficiencies in understanding real-world\napp scenarios, thereby achieving more informed and context-aware task planning.\nFinally, planned tasks are transformed into executable actions through a task\nexecutor supported by a dual-LLM architecture, ensuring effective tracking of\ntask progress.

However, optimizations for\nfitness metrics are mainly based on heuristic algorithms, which usually rely on\nhistorical execution information and lack foresight on paths that have not been\nexercised yet. Thus, those hard-to-execute paths with complex constraints would\nhinder DGF from reaching the targets, making DGF less efficient. In this paper,\nwe propose DeepGo, a predictive directed grey-box fuzzer that can combine\nhistorical and predicted information to steer DGF to reach the target site via\nan optimal path. We first propose the path transition model, which models DGF\nas a process of reaching the target site through specific path transition\nsequences. The new seed generated by mutation would cause the path transition,\nand the path corresponding to the high-reward path transition sequence\nindicates a high likelihood of reaching the target site through it. Then, to\npredict the path transitions and the corresponding rewards, we use deep neural\nnetworks to construct a Virtual Ensemble Environment (VEE), which gradually\nimitates the path transition model and predicts the rewards of path transitions\nthat have not been taken yet. To determine the optimal path, we develop a\nReinforcement Learning for Fuzzing (RLF) model to generate the transition\nsequences with the highest sequence rewards. The RLF model can combine\nhistorical and predicted path transitions to generate the optimal path\ntransition sequences, along with the policy to guide the mutation strategy of\nfuzzing. Finally, to exercise the high-reward path transition sequence, we\npropose the concept of an action group, which comprehensively optimizes the\ncritical steps of fuzzing to realize the optimal path to reach the target\nefficiently.",

    "abstract": "Networks of coupled phase oscillators are one of the most studied dynamical\nsystems with numerous applications in physics, chemistry, biology, and\nengineering. Their typical behaviour looks like a partially synchronized\ndynamic pattern, where some oscillators behave almost identically, while others\nbehave differently relative to each other. In the case of large networks, the\nproperties of these patterns can often be analysed using a kind of mean-field\napproach (called thermodynamic limit or continuum limit), where the state of\nthe system is represented by a single-particle probability density function and\nits evolution is described by a standard continuity equation. Such an\nanalytical approach allows to predict what type of network dynamics can be\nobserved for different system parameters. But it is less known that for\ndifferent partially synchronized patterns it also allows to obtain statistical\nequilibrium relations that express the dependence of some time-averaged\nobservable quantities of individual oscillators on the internal parameters of\nthese oscillators and the interaction functions between them. In this paper, we\nshow how such relations can be derived, what their typical accuracy is for\nfinite-size networks, and how they can be used to reconstruct the parameters of\nthe corresponding model. The proposed method is particularly effective for\nlarge networks, for unevenly sampled or noisy observables, and for partial\nobservations. Its possibilities are demonstrated by application to chimera\nstates in networks of phase oscillator with nonlocal coupling.",

    "abstract": "Modern analytical pipelines routinely deploy multiple deep learning and\nretrieval models that rely on approximate nearest-neighbor (ANN) indexes to\nsupport efficient similarity-based search. While many state-of-the-art\nANN-indexes are memory-based (e.g., HNSW and IVF), using multiple ANN indexes\ncreates a competition for limited GPU/CPU memory resources, which in turn\nnecessitates disk-based index structures (e.g., DiskANN or eCP). In typical\nindex implementations, the main component is a complex data structure that is\nserialized to disk and is read either fully at startup time, for memory-based\nindexes, or incrementally at query time, for disk-based indexes. To visualize\nthe index structure, or analyze its quality, complex coding is needed that is\neither embedded in the index implementation or replicates the code that reads\nthe data structure. In this paper, we consider an alternative approach that\nmaps the data structure to a file structure, using a file library, making the\nindex easily readable for any programming language and even human-readable. The\ndisadvantage is that the serialized index is verbose, leading to overhead of\nsearching through the index. The question addressed in this paper is how severe\nthis performance penalty is. To that end, this paper presents eCP-FS, a\nfile-based implementation of eCP, a well-known disk-based ANN index. A\ncomparison with state-of-the-art indexes shows that while eCP-FS is slower, the\nimplementation is nevertheless somewhat competitive even when memory is not\nconstrained. In a memory-constrained scenario, eCP-FS offers a minimal memory\nfootprint, making it ideal for resource-constrained or multi-index\nenvironments.",

Drawing on an intent perspective and historical analysis, we define\nvibe coding as a software development paradigm where humans and generative AI\nengage in collaborative flow to co-create software artifacts through natural\nlanguage dialogue, shifting the mediation of developer intent from\ndeterministic instruction to probabilistic inference. By intent mediation, we\nrefer to the fundamental process through which developers translate their\nconceptual goals into representations that computational systems can execute.\nOur results show that vibe coding reconfigures cognitive work by redistributing\nepistemic labor between humans and machines, shifting the expertise in the\nsoftware development process away from traditional areas such as design or\ntechnical implementation toward collaborative orchestration. We identify key\nopportunities, including democratization, acceleration, and systemic leverage,\nalongside risks, such as black box codebases, responsibility gaps, and\necosystem bias. We conclude with a research agenda spanning human-,\ntechnology-, and organization-centered directions to guide future\ninvestigations of this paradigm.",

To bridge this gap, we introduce MMAT-1M, the first million-scale\nmultimodal agent tuning dataset designed to support CoT, reflection, and\ndynamic tool usage. Our dataset is constructed through a novel four-stage data\nengine: 1) We first curate publicly available multimodal datasets containing\nquestion-answer pairs; 2) Then, leveraging GPT-4o, we generate rationales for\nthe original question-answer pairs and dynamically integrate API calls and\nRetrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) information through a multi-turn paradigm;\n3) Furthermore, we refine the rationales through reflection to ensure logical\nconsistency and accuracy, creating a multi-turn dialogue dataset with both\nRationale and Reflection (RR); 4) Finally, to enhance efficiency, we optionally\ncompress multi-turn dialogues into a One-turn Rationale and Reflection (ORR)\nformat. By fine-tuning open-source multimodal models on the MMAT-1M, we observe\nsignificant performance gains. For instance, the InternVL2.5-8B-RR model\nachieves an average improvement of 2.7% across eight public benchmarks and 8.8%\non the RAG benchmark Dyn-VQA, demonstrating the dataset's effectiveness in\nenhancing multimodal reasoning and tool-based capabilities.

    "abstract": "In recent years, artificial intelligence has been increasingly applied in the\nfield of medical imaging. Among these applications, fundus image analysis\npresents special challenges, including small lesion areas in certain fundus\ndiseases and subtle inter-disease differences, which can lead to reduced\nprediction accuracy and overfitting in the models. To address these challenges,\nthis paper proposes the Transformer-based model SwinECAT, which combines the\nShifted Window (Swin) Attention with the Efficient Channel Attention (ECA)\nAttention. SwinECAT leverages the Swin Attention mechanism in the Swin\nTransformer backbone to effectively capture local spatial structures and\nlong-range dependencies within fundus images. The lightweight ECA mechanism is\nincorporated to guide the SwinECAT's attention toward critical feature\nchannels, enabling more discriminative feature representation. In contrast to\nprevious studies that typically classify fundus images into 4 to 6 categories,\nthis work expands fundus disease classification to 9 distinct types, thereby\nenhancing the granularity of diagnosis. We evaluate our method on the Eye\nDisease Image Dataset (EDID) containing 16,140 fundus images for 9-category\nclassification. Experimental results demonstrate that SwinECAT achieves 88.29\\%\naccuracy, with weighted F1-score of 0.88 and macro F1-score of 0.90. The\nclassification results of our proposed model SwinECAT significantly outperform\nthe baseline Swin Transformer and multiple compared baseline models. To our\nknowledge, this represents the highest reported performance for 9-category\nclassification on this public dataset.",

In this work, we extend the quantum homogenizer to the\nnon-Markovian regime by introducing intra-ancilla interactions mediated by\nFredkin gates, and study the nature of its memory. Using entanglement measures\nand relying only on the local dynamics as a witness, we prove the model can be\nrealized with either classical or quantum memory, depending on the\ninitialization of the reservoir and the propagation of non-classical\ncorrelations within the reservoir.

Among unsupervised approaches, self-supervised\nlearning has gained traction for modeling normal behavior without the need of\nlabeled data. However, many existing methods rely on a single proxy task,\nlimiting their ability to capture meaningful patterns in normal data. Moreover,\nthey often depend on handcrafted transformations tailored specific domains,\nhindering their generalization accross diverse problems. To address these\nlimitations, we introduce NeuCoReClass AD, a self-supervised multi-task time\nseries anomaly detection framework that combines contrastive, reconstruction,\nand classification proxy tasks. Our method employs neural transformation\nlearning to generate augmented views that are informative, diverse, and\ncoherent, without requiring domain-specific knowledge. We evaluate NeuCoReClass\nAD across a wide range of benchmarks, demonstrating that it consistently\noutperforms both classical baselines and most deep-learning alternatives.\nFurthermore, it enables the characterization of distinct anomaly profiles in a\nfully unsupervised manner.",

Distributed coupled-cavity laser (DCCL) systems, as a\nrepresentative configuration, have been proposed to expand the field of view\n(FoV) and enhance safety. This paper investigates the safety assessment of\nDCCL-WPT systems through three case studies: skin safety, eye safety, and\nsmall-object intrusion sensitivity. First, we establish a safety analysis model\nto quantify irradiation levels on intruding objects in the beam path, which\nsimulates intracavity beam propagation using diffraction modeling and gain-loss\ndynamics under case-specific boundary conditions. Next, we formulate an eye\nsafety evaluation tailored for DCCL-WPT systems using a human head model to\nidentify potential exposure angles and distances. Ray tracing confirms that\nintracavity beams are not focused onto the retina, making cornea exposure the\nprimary consideration (irradiance is below 0.1 W/cm2). Numerical results\ndemonstrate that DCCL-WPT achieves: i) over 600 mW charging power under\nskin-safe conditions at 5 m distance (100 mW over 16{\\deg} FoV), and nearly 50%\nlower irradiance on intruding objects compared to single-cavity systems; ii)\n150 mW charging power under eye-safe conditions with 650 mW 1064 nm output beam\npower, far beyond the typical ~10 mW eye-safe threshold; iii) high sensitivity\nto small-object intrusion, enabling hazard mitigation. These findings\nunderscore the practicality of DCCL-WPT systems for mobile, long-distance, and\nsafe energy transfer, and lay the groundwork for future safety-aware\noptimizations in real-world deployments.",

We propose the\nquantum Koopman method (QKM), a data-driven framework that bridges this gap\nthrough transforming nonlinear dynamics into linear unitary evolution in\nhigher-dimensional observable spaces. Leveraging the Koopman operator theory to\nachieve a global linearization, our approach maps system states into a\nhierarchy of Hilbert spaces using a deep autoencoder. Within the linearized\nembedding spaces, the state representation is decomposed into modulus and phase\ncomponents, and the evolution is governed by a set of unitary Koopman operators\nthat act exclusively on the phase. These operators are constructed from\ndiagonal Hamiltonians with coefficients learned from data, a structure designed\nfor efficient implementation on quantum hardware. This architecture enables\ndirect multi-step prediction, and the operator's computational complexity\nscales logarithmically with the observable space dimension. The QKM is\nvalidated across diverse nonlinear systems. Its predictions maintain relative\nerrors below 6% for reaction-diffusion systems and shear flows, and capture key\nstatistics in 2D turbulence.

Accurately identifying the referent requires\nmultimodal understanding: integrating textual instructions, visual pointing,\nand scene context. However, existing methods often struggle to effectively\nleverage visual clues for disambiguation. We also observe that, while the\nreferent is often aligned with the head-to-fingertip line, it occasionally\naligns more closely with the wrist-to-fingertip line. Therefore, relying on a\nsingle line assumption can be overly simplistic and may lead to suboptimal\nperformance. To address this, we propose a dual-model framework, where one\nmodel learns from the head-to-fingertip direction and the other from the\nwrist-to-fingertip direction. We further introduce a Gaussian ray heatmap\nrepresentation of these lines and use them as input to provide a strong\nsupervisory signal that encourages the model to better attend to pointing cues.\nTo combine the strengths of both models, we present the CLIP-Aware Pointing\nEnsemble module, which performs a hybrid ensemble based on CLIP features.\nAdditionally, we propose an object center prediction head as an auxiliary task\nto further enhance referent localization.

Certain applications, like combinatorial optimization,\nhowever demand more than expectation values: the bit-strings themselves encode\nthe candidate solutions. While recent impossibility and threshold results\nindicate that noisy samples alone rarely beat classical heuristics, we still\nlack classical methods to replicate those noisy samples beyond the setting of\nrandom quantum circuits.\n  Focusing on problems whose objective depends only on two-body correlations\nsuch as Max-Cut, we show that Gaussian randomized rounding in the spirit of\nGoemans-Williamson applied to the circuit's two-qubit marginals-produces a\ndistribution whose expected cost is provably close to that of the noisy quantum\ndevice. For instance, for Max-Cut problems we show that for any depth-D circuit\naffected by local depolarizing noise p, our sampler achieves an approximation\nratio $1-O[(1-p)^D]$, giving ways to efficiently sample from a distribution\nthat behaves similarly to the noisy circuit for the problem at hand. Beyond\ntheory we run large-scale simulations and experiments on IBMQ hardware,\nconfirming that the rounded samples faithfully reproduce the full energy\ndistribution, and we show similar behaviour under other various noise models.\n  Our results supply a simple classical surrogate for sampling noisy\noptimization circuits, clarify the realistic power of near-term hardware for\ncombinatorial tasks, and provide a quantitative benchmark for future\nerror-mitigated or fault-tolerant demonstrations of quantum advantage.",

Specifically, the BS transmits a superposition of\nGaussian information and deterministic sensing signals. The BS aims to deliver\ninformation symbols to the CU, while the sensing receiver aims to estimate the\ntarget's direction-of-arrival (DoA) with respect to the sensing receiver by\nprocessing the echo signals. For the sensing receiver, we assume that only the\nsequences of the deterministic sensing signals and the covariance matrix of the\ninformation signals are perfectly known, whereas the specific realizations of\nthe information signals remain unavailable. Under this setup, we first derive\nthe corresponding Cram\\'er-Rao bounds (CRBs) for DoA estimation and propose\npractical estimators to accurately estimate the target's DoA. Subsequently, we\nformulate the transmit beamforming design as an optimization problem aiming to\nminimize the CRB, subject to a minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio\n(SINR) requirement at the CU and a maximum transmit power constraint at the BS.\nWhen the BS employs only Gaussian information signals, the resulting\nbeamforming optimization problem is convex, enabling the derivation of an\noptimal solution. In contrast, when both Gaussian information and deterministic\nsensing signals are transmitted, the resulting problem is non-convex and a\nlocally optimal solution is acquired by exploiting successive convex\napproximation (SCA). Finally, numerical results demonstrate that employing\nGaussian information signals leads to a notable performance degradation for\ntarget sensing and the proposed transmit beamforming design achieves a superior\nISAC performance boundary compared with various benchmark schemes.",

Emerging evidence suggests that human brain representations in both\nvision and language are well predicted by semantic feature spaces obtained from\nlarge language models (LLMs). This raises the possibility that sensory systems\nconverge in their inherent ability to transform their inputs onto shared,\nembedding-like representational space. However, it remains unclear how such a\nspace manifests in human behaviour. To investigate this, sixty-three\nparticipants performed behavioural similarity judgements separately on 100\nnatural scene images and 100 corresponding sentence captions from the Natural\nScenes Dataset. We found that visual and linguistic similarity judgements not\nonly converge at the behavioural level but also predict a remarkably similar\nnetwork of fMRI brain responses evoked by viewing the natural scene images.\nFurthermore, computational models trained to map images onto LLM-embeddings\noutperformed both category-trained and AlexNet controls in explaining the\nbehavioural similarity structure. These findings demonstrate that human visual\nand linguistic similarity judgements are grounded in a shared,\nmodality-agnostic representational structure that mirrors how the visual system\nencodes experience.

    "abstract": "Solar active regions are where sunspots are located and photospheric magnetic\nfluxes are concentrated, therefore being the sources of energetic eruptions in\nthe solar atmosphere. The detection and statistics of solar active regions have\nbeen forefront topics in solar physics. In this study, we developed a solar\nactive region detector (SARD) based on the advanced object detection model\nYOLOv8. First, we applied image processing techniques including thresholding\nand morphological operations to 6975 line-of-sight magnetograms from 2010 to\n2019 at a cadence of 12~h, obtained by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager\nonboard the Solar Dynamic Observatory. With manual refinement, we labeled 26531\nactive regions in the dataset for further training and test with the detection\nmodel. Without any overlap between the training and test sets, the superior\nperformance of SARD is demonstrated by an average precision rate as high as\n94\\%. We then performed a statistical analysis on the area and magnetic flux of\nthe detected active regions, both of which yield log-normal distributions. This\nresult sheds light on the underlying complexity and multi-scale nature of solar\nactive regions.",

We offer a new perspective on ultrasound video\nanalysis through implicit neural representations (INRs). We build on Functa, an\nINR framework in which each image is represented by a modulation vector that\nconditions a shared neural network. However, its extension to the temporal\ndomain of medical videos remains unexplored. To address this gap, we propose\nVidFuncta, a novel framework that leverages Functa to encode variable-length\nultrasound videos into compact, time-resolved representations. VidFuncta\ndisentangles each video into a static video-specific vector and a sequence of\ntime-dependent modulation vectors, capturing both temporal dynamics and\ndataset-level redundancies. Our method outperforms 2D and 3D baselines on video\nreconstruction and enables downstream tasks to directly operate on the learned\n1D modulation vectors. We validate VidFuncta on three public ultrasound video\ndatasets -- cardiac, lung, and breast -- and evaluate its downstream\nperformance on ejection fraction prediction, B-line detection, and breast\nlesion classification. These results highlight the potential of VidFuncta as a\ngeneralizable and efficient representation framework for ultrasound videos.

Existing RGB-D VSOD models\nhave different attempts to derive motion cues, in which extracting motion\ninformation explicitly from optical flow appears to be a more effective and\npromising alternative. Despite this, there remains a key issue that how to\neffectively utilize optical flow and depth to assist the RGB modality in SOD.\nPrevious methods always treat optical flow and depth equally with respect to\nmodel designs, without explicitly considering their unequal contributions in\nindividual scenarios, limiting the potential of motion and depth. To address\nthis issue and unleash the power of motion and depth, we propose a novel\nselective cross-modal fusion framework (SMFNet) for RGB-D VSOD, incorporating a\npixel-level selective fusion strategy (PSF) that achieves optimal fusion of\noptical flow and depth based on their actual contributions. Besides, we propose\na multi-dimensional selective attention module (MSAM) to integrate the fused\nfeatures derived from PSF with the remaining RGB modality at multiple\ndimensions, effectively enhancing feature representation to generate refined\nfeatures. We conduct comprehensive evaluation of SMFNet against 19\nstate-of-the-art models on both RDVS and DVisal datasets, making the evaluation\nthe most comprehensive RGB-D VSOD benchmark up to date, and it also\ndemonstrates the superiority of SMFNet over other models.

The ever-growing\ndemand for these applications has driven efforts in enhancing modulation\ncoupling strength and bandwidth towards advanced pulse-comb synthesis. However,\nthe effects of strong-coupling and high-bandwidth cavity EO modulation remain\nunderexplored, due to the lack of a general, unified model that captures this\nextreme condition. In this work, we present a universal framework for\npulse-comb synthesis under cavity EO modulation, where coupling strength and\nmodulation bandwidth far exceed the cavity's free spectral range (FSR). We show\nthat, under such intense and ultrafast driving conditions, EO-driven frequency\ncombs and pulses exhibit rich higher-order nonlinear dynamics, including\ntemporal pulse compression and comb generation with arbitrary pump detuning.\nLeveraging this framework, we reveal a direct link between the higher-order\ndynamics of EO pulse-comb generation and the band structure of synthetic\ndimension. Furthermore, we demonstrate arbitrary comb shaping via\nmachine-learning-based inverse microwave drive design, achieving a tenfold\nenhancement in cavity electro-optic comb flatness by exploring the synergistic\neffects of high-bandwidth driving and detuning-induced frequency boundaries.\nOur findings push cavity electro-optic modulation into a new frontier,\nunlocking significant potential for universal and machine-learning-programmable\nelectro-optic frequency combs, topological photonics, as well as photonic\nquantum computing in the strong-coupling and high-bandwidth regimes.",

This study compares three DCS\nanalytical models: semi-infinite, two-layer, and three-layer, focusing on their\nfitting strategies, performance, and suitability for CBFi and relative CBFi\n(rCBFi) estimation. We simulated DCS data using a four-layer slab head model\nwith the Monte Carlo eXtreme (MCX) toolkit. Multiple fitting strategies were\nevaluated: early time lag range (ETLR) fitting with fixed or variable beta for\nthe semi-infinite model, and single-distance (SD) and multi-distance (MD)\nfitting for the two- and three-layer models. Model performance was assessed\nbased on CBFi sensitivity, accuracy of CBFi and rCBFi recovery, resistance to\nsignal contamination from scalp and skull, sensitivity to assumed parameter\nerrors, and computational efficiency across source-detector separations of 20\nto 35 mm. Optimal fitting methods include ETLR with fixed beta for the\nsemi-infinite model, SD with fixed beta for the two-layer model, and MD for the\nthree-layer model. The multi-layer models achieved higher CBFi sensitivity (up\nto 100%) compared to 36.8% for the semi-infinite model.

We analyze 4,151 Ly$\\alpha$\nforest skewers extracted from LBG spectra obtained in the DESI pilot surveys in\nthe COSMOS and XMM-LSS fields. We present the first measurement of the\nLy$\\alpha$ forest auto-correlation function derived exclusively from LBG\nspectra, probing comoving separations up to 48 $h^{-1}$Mpc at an effective\nredshift of $z_\\mathrm{eff}$ = 2.70. The measured signal is consistent with\nthat from DESI DR2 quasar Ly$\\alpha$ forest spectra at a comparable redshift,\nvalidating LBGs as reliable background sources. We also measure the\ncross-correlation between the LBG Ly$\\alpha$ forest and 13,362 galaxy\npositions, showing that this observable serves as a sensitive diagnostic for\ngalaxy redshift uncertainties and systematic offsets. Finally, using synthetic\nLBG spectra and Fisher forecasts, we show that a future wide-area survey over\n5000 deg$^2$, targeting 1000 LBGs per deg$^2$ at similar signal-to-noise than\nour dataset, could enable Ly$\\alpha$ forest baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO)\nmeasurements with 0.4% precision on the isotropic BAO scale and 1.3% on the\nanisotropic (Alcock-Paczynski) scale. Combining BAO with a Ly$\\alpha$ forest\nfull-shape analysis improves the AP constraint to 0.6%. These results open a\nnew path for precision cosmology at high redshift using dense LBG samples.",

We first derive novel bounds on\nneutrino-Majoron couplings using the spectral distortions induced by neutrino\nnon-radiative two-body decay in matter, and two-dimensional likelihood analyses\nof the 24 $\\bar{\\nu}_e$ events from SN1987A.

We\npropose an unsupervised parameter estimation methodology that first finds an\napproximate general solution, followed by a spline transformation to linearly\nestimate the coefficients of the governing ordinary differential equation\n(ODE). The approximate general solution is postulated using the same functional\nform as the analytical solution of a general homogeneous, linear,\nconstant-coefficient ODE.

AutoTIR leverages a hybrid reward\nmechanism that jointly optimizes for task-specific answer correctness,\nstructured output adherence, and penalization of incorrect tool usage, thereby\nencouraging both precise reasoning and efficient tool integration. Extensive\nevaluations across diverse knowledge-intensive, mathematical, and general\nlanguage modeling tasks demonstrate that AutoTIR achieves superior overall\nperformance, significantly outperforming baselines and exhibits superior\ngeneralization in tool-use behavior. These results highlight the promise of\nreinforcement learning in building truly generalizable and scalable TIR\ncapabilities in LLMs. The code and data are available at\nhttps://github.com/weiyifan1023/AutoTIR.",

    "abstract": "When the available data for a target domain is limited, transfer learning\n(TL) methods can be used to develop models on related data-rich domains, before\ndeploying them on the target domain. However, these TL methods are typically\ndesigned with specific, static assumptions on the amount of available labeled\nand unlabeled target data. This is in contrast with many real world\napplications, where the availability of data and corresponding labels varies\nover time. Since the evaluation of the TL methods is typically also performed\nunder the same static data availability assumptions, this would lead to\nunrealistic expectations concerning their performance in real world settings.\nTo support a more realistic evaluation and comparison of TL algorithms and\nmodels, we propose a data manipulation framework that (1) simulates varying\ndata availability scenarios over time, (2) creates multiple domains through\nresampling of a given dataset and (3) introduces inter-domain variability by\napplying realistic domain transformations, e.g., creating a variety of\npotentially time-dependent covariate and concept shifts. These capabilities\nenable simulation of a large number of realistic variants of the experiments,\nin turn providing more information about the potential behavior of algorithms\nwhen deployed in dynamic settings. We demonstrate the usefulness of the\nproposed framework by performing a case study on a proprietary real-world suite\nof card payment datasets. Given the confidential nature of the case study, we\nalso illustrate the use of the framework on the publicly available Bank Account\nFraud (BAF) dataset. By providing a methodology for evaluating TL methods over\ntime and in realistic data availability scenarios, our framework facilitates\nunderstanding of the behavior of models and algorithms.

In particular, the magnetic flux\ntransport in the presence of magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence is an\nessential factor for understanding star formation. The theory of Reconnection\nDiffusion (RD), based on statistics of Alfv\\'enic turbulence, predicts a\ndependence of the diffusion coefficient of the magnetic field on the Alfv\\'enic\nMach number $M_A$. However, this theory does not consider the effects of\ncompressibility which are important in the regime of supersonic MHD turbulence.\nIn this work, we measure the diffusion coefficient of magnetic fields in\nsub-Alfv\\'enic MHD turbulence, with different sonic Mach numbers $M_S$. We\nperform numerical simulations of forced turbulence in periodic domains from the\nincompressible limit to the supersonic regime. We introduce two methods to\nextract the diffusion coefficient, based on the analysis of tracer particles.\nOur results confirm the RD assumption regarding the correspondence between the\ndiffusion of magnetic field and that of fluid Lagrangian particles. The\nmeasured diffusion rate provided by incompressible turbulence agrees with the\nsuppression predicted by the RD theory in the presence of strong magnetic\nfields: $D \\propto M_A^3$. Our simulations also indicate an increase in RD\nefficiency when the turbulence is compressible. The dependency on $M_A$ and\n$M_S$ from the simulations can be described by the relation $D \\propto\nM_A^\\alpha$, where $\\alpha(M_S) \\approx 3/(1 + M_S)$. This quantitative\ncharacterization of $D$ is critical for modeling star formation in turbulent\nmolecular clouds and evaluating the efficiency of this transport compared to\nother mechanisms.",

However, many methods treat LLMs as\nend-to-end forecasters, which often leads to a loss of numerical precision and\nforces LLMs to handle patterns beyond their intended design. Alternatively,\nmethods that attempt to align textual and time series modalities within latent\nspace frequently encounter alignment difficulty. In this paper, we propose to\ntreat LLMs not as standalone forecasters, but as semantic guidance modules\nwithin a dual-stream framework. We propose DualSG, a dual-stream framework that\nprovides explicit semantic guidance, where LLMs act as Semantic Guides to\nrefine rather than replace traditional predictions. As part of DualSG, we\nintroduce Time Series Caption, an explicit prompt format that summarizes trend\npatterns in natural language and provides interpretable context for LLMs,\nrather than relying on implicit alignment between text and time series in the\nlatent space. We also design a caption-guided fusion module that explicitly\nmodels inter-variable relationships while reducing noise and computation.\nExperiments on real-world datasets from diverse domains show that DualSG\nconsistently outperforms 15 state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating the value\nof explicitly combining numerical forecasting with semantic guidance.",

In both cases, we observe ordered magnetic fields that appear to arise\nfrom dusty circumstellar material that has been swept up by the passage of\noutflows driven by the central post-Asymptotic Giant Branch (post-AGB) star.\nCRL 618 shows a magnetic field aligned with one of the most extreme position\nangles of the outflowing bullets ejected from the central source. We\nhypothesize that polarized emission in CRL 618 may preferentially arise from\nmaterial in the walls of the dust cavity opened by the ejected bullets.\nConversely, OH231.8+4.2 shows a magnetic field that is aligned approximately\nperpendicular to the outflow direction, which may preferentially arise from an\ninfrared-bright dense clump embedded near the base of the outflow. Despite CRL\n618 being carbon-rich and OH231.8+4.2 being oxygen-rich, there is no\nsignificant difference in the polarization fractions of the two sources.

    "abstract": "We consider the investor who doesn't trade shares of his portfolio. The\ninvestor only observes the current trades made in the market with his\nsecurities to estimate the current return, variance, and risks of his unchanged\nportfolio. We show how the time series of consecutive trades made in the market\nwith the securities of the portfolio can determine the time series that model\nthe trades with the portfolio as with a single security. That establishes the\nequal description of the market-based variance of the securities and of the\nportfolio composed of these securities that account for the fluctuations of the\nvolumes of the consecutive trades. We show that Markowitz's (1952) variance\ndescribes only the approximation when all volumes of the consecutive trades\nwith securities are assumed constant. The market-based variance depends on the\ncoefficient of variation of fluctuations of volumes of trades. To emphasize\nthis dependence and to estimate possible deviation from Markowitz variance, we\nderive the Taylor series of the market-based variance up to the 2nd term by the\ncoefficient of variation, taking Markowitz variance as a zero approximation. We\nconsider three limiting cases with low and high fluctuations of the portfolio\nreturns, and with a zero covariance of trade values and volumes and show that\nthe impact of the coefficient of variation of trade volume fluctuations can\ncause Markowitz's assessment to highly undervalue or overestimate the\nmarket-based variance of the portfolio. Incorrect assessments of the variances\nof securities and of the portfolio cause wrong risk estimates, disturb optimal\nportfolio selection, and result in unexpected losses.

    "abstract": "Fantasy Premier League engages the football community in selecting the\nPremier League players who will perform best from gameweek to gameweek. Access\nto accurate performance forecasts gives participants an edge over competitors\nby guiding expectations about player outcomes and reducing uncertainty in squad\nselection. However, high-accuracy forecasts are currently limited to commercial\nservices whose inner workings are undisclosed and that rely on proprietary\ndata. This paper aims to democratize access to highly accurate forecasts of\nplayer performance by presenting OpenFPL, an open-source Fantasy Premier League\nforecasting method developed exclusively from public data. Comprising\nposition-specific ensemble models optimized on Fantasy Premier League and\nUnderstat data from four previous seasons (2020-21 to 2023-24), OpenFPL\nachieves accuracy comparable to a leading commercial service when tested\nprospectively on data from the 2024-25 season. OpenFPL also surpasses the\ncommercial benchmark for high-return players ($>$ 2 points), which are most\ninfluential for rank gains. These findings hold across one-, two-, and\nthree-gameweek forecast horizons, supporting long-term planning of transfers\nand strategies while also informing final-day decisions.",

When a single agent cannot fulfill a\ngoal, we have a merge goal that can be achieved through the collaboration of\nmultiple agents.

While\nflares have been observed for decades, stellar CMEs remain elusive. Extreme\nultraviolet (EUV) emissions are sensitive to both flares and CME-induced\ncoronal dimming. We assess the detectability of stellar CME-induced EUV dimming\nevents by adapting a known \"Sun-as-a-star\" dimming technique -- validated by\nthe Solar Dynamics Observatory's EUV Variability Experiment (EVE) -- to stellar\nconditions. We adapt the solar data to reflect a range of stellar intensities,\naccounting for intrinsic brightness, distance, and interstellar medium (ISM)\nattenuation. We generate synthetic light curves for two different missions: the\nlegacy EUV Explorer (EUVE) and the proposed ESCAPE mission. Our results\nindicate that dimming detections are well within reach. EUVE's broadband imager\nwas capable of detecting stellar CMEs -- albeit with limited spectral\n(temperature) resolution -- but that was not part of the observing plan. EUVE's\nspectroscopic survey lacked sufficient sensitivity for CME detections.\nOptimizing modern instrument design for this task would make the observation\nfully feasible. In this work, we present a tool to explore the stellar-CME\ndetection parameter space. Our tool shows that an instrument with performance\nsimilar to ESCAPE, setting a 600-second integration period, and integrating the\nspectra into bands, any star with an X-ray flux $\\geq 2.51 \\times\n10^{-12}$ergs$^{-1}$~cm$^{-2}$ should have a $\\geq 3\\sigma$ detection even for\na modest few-percent dimming profile, regardless of ISM attenuation.

    "abstract": "Short--period ($P<$1 hr orbits) detached double white dwarf binary (DWDB)\ncomponents identified with transient surveys (e.g. SDSS, ZTF) have hot surface\ntemperatures ($>$10,000 K) and observed radii a factor two larger than\ncompletely degenerate white dwarfs. We formulate tidal heating in helium\ncomposition extremely low mass white dwarf (ELM WD) components of detached\nDWDBs which reach mass transfer within a Hubble time. We combine a mass radius\nrelation which varies with surface temperature and the equilibrium tidal\nfriction model of Hut 1981, where the additional orbital energy loss from tidal\nfriction is accounted for by increases in the primary surface temperature, and\nhence increasing radius. Applying this heating model to the current sample of\nbinaries with ZTF, we predict temperature increases from the present day of up\nto $\\sim$40\\% before the onset of mass transfer. We find that helium white\ndwarfs are generically hot and large at the onset of mass transfer, even for\nthe oldest DWDBs whose components can cool to be degenerate by the present day.\nIn the population of Galactic DWDBs, we find that the onset of mass transfer\nshould occur at orbital periods as long as 1000s (17 minutes), or binary\ngravitational wave frequency of 2 mHz. This is over three times longer than\nperiods expected for degenerate WD (5 minutes). Since mass transferring DWDBs\nare progenitors for a variety of transients and stellar populations e.g. RCrB\nstars, AM CVn binaries, type .Ia supernova, the finite temperature of donor\nwhite dwarfs should be taken into account.",

Current vulnerability datasets suffer\nfrom issues including label inaccuracy rates of 20-71%, extensive duplication,\nand poor coverage of critical CWE types. These issues create a significant\n\"generalization gap\" where models achieve misleading self-testing performance\n(measured on held-out data from the same dataset for training) by exploiting\nspurious correlations rather than learning true vulnerability patterns. Our\nanalysis reveals that many models experience substantial performance drops of\nup to 33% when evaluated on independent data, with some performing close to\nrandom guessing. To address these limitations, we present a three-part\nsolution. First, we introduce a manually curated test dataset, BenchVul,\ncovering the MITRE Top 25 Most Dangerous CWEs. Second, we construct a\nhigh-quality training dataset, TitanVul, comprising 38,863 functions by\naggregating seven public sources and applying deduplication and validation\nusing a novel multi-agent LLM framework. Third, we propose a Realistic\nVulnerability Generation (RVG) framework, which synthesizes context-aware\nvulnerability examples for underrepresented but critical CWE types through\nsimulated development workflows. Our evaluation shows the strengths of each\ncomponent in closing the generalization gap. First, BenchVul shows the\nlimitations of self-testing: models trained on existing datasets, such as\nBigVul and CVEfixes, experience performance drops on BenchVul (from 0.776 to\n0.519 and from 0.713 to 0.607). Second, training models on TitanVul\ndemonstrates improved generalization, with model performance increasing from\n0.584 when evaluated on the same dataset to 0.767 when tested on BenchVul.\nThird, supplementing TitanVul with RVG-generated data yields further gains,\nincreasing model performance by 14.0% to 0.874.",

The limited\ntraining data makes it difficult to represent the data distribution of\nrealistic remote sensing scenes, which results in the notorious overfitting\nproblem. Current researchers have begun to enhance the diversity of few-shot\nnovel instances by leveraging diffusion models to solve the overfitting\nproblem. However, naively increasing the diversity of objects is insufficient,\nas surrounding contexts also play a crucial role in object detection, and in\ncases where the object diversity is sufficient, the detector tends to overfit\nto monotonous contexts. Accordingly, we propose Control Copy-Paste, a\ncontrollable diffusion-based method to enhance the performance of FSOD by\nleveraging diverse contextual information. Specifically, we seamlessly inject a\nfew-shot novel objects into images with diverse contexts by a conditional\ndiffusion model. We also develop an orientation alignment strategy to mitigate\nthe integration distortion caused by varying aspect ratios of instances.\nExperiments on the public DIOR dataset demonstrate that our method can improve\ndetection performance by an average of 10.76%.",

We build the Instruction and RAG schemes to evaluate model behaviours\nbased on their inherent knowledge and the integration of domain knowledge. Our\nresults indicate that state-of-the-art LLMs still struggle to provide accurate\nharm reduction information, and sometimes, carry out severe safety risks to\nPWUD.

To address these\nlimitations, we present HunyuanWorld 1.0, a novel framework that combines the\nbest of both worlds for generating immersive, explorable, and interactive 3D\nscenes from text and image conditions. Our approach features three key\nadvantages: 1) 360{\\deg} immersive experiences via panoramic world proxies; 2)\nmesh export capabilities for seamless compatibility with existing computer\ngraphics pipelines; 3) disentangled object representations for augmented\ninteractivity. The core of our framework is a semantically layered 3D mesh\nrepresentation that leverages panoramic images as 360{\\deg} world proxies for\nsemantic-aware world decomposition and reconstruction, enabling the generation\nof diverse 3D worlds.

Yet, in practice, analyses are often\ncomplicated by missing data. The most widely used approach to address\nmissingness is multiple imputation, which involves creating several completed\ndatasets. However, there is an ongoing debate on how to perform model selection\nin the presence of multiple imputed datasets. Simple strategies, such as\npooling models across datasets, have been shown to have suboptimal properties.\nAlthough more sophisticated methods exist, they are often difficult to\nimplement and therefore not widely applied. In contrast, two recent approaches\nmodify the regularization methods LASSO and elastic nets by defining a single\nloss function, resulting in a unified set of coefficients across imputations.\nOur key contribution is to extend this principle to the framework of\ncomponent-wise gradient boosting by proposing MIBoost, a novel algorithm that\nemploys a uniform variable-selection mechanism across imputed datasets.\nSimulation studies suggest that our approach yields prediction performance\ncomparable to that of these recently proposed methods.",

This work explores the structure of neutron-rich\nNb nuclei up to $N=68$, aiming to understand shape evolution with isospin and\nthe onset of triaxiality. Two complementary fission experiments were used: (i)\n$^{238}$U+$^9$Be at GANIL in inverse kinematics with AGATA, EXOGAM, and\nVAMOS++, allowing prompt and delayed $\\gamma$-ray spectroscopy with isotopic\nidentification; (ii) spontaneous fission of $^{252}$Cf with the Gammasphere\narray providing high-fold $\\gamma$-coincidence data.

In this paper, we propose\n$\\textbf{MixGRPO}$, a novel framework that leverages the flexibility of mixed\nsampling strategies through the integration of stochastic differential\nequations (SDE) and ordinary differential equations (ODE). This streamlines the\noptimization process within the MDP to improve efficiency and boost\nperformance. Specifically, MixGRPO introduces a sliding window mechanism, using\nSDE sampling and GRPO-guided optimization only within the window, while\napplying ODE sampling outside. This design confines sampling randomness to the\ntime-steps within the window, thereby reducing the optimization overhead, and\nallowing for more focused gradient updates to accelerate convergence.\nAdditionally, as time-steps beyond the sliding window are not involved in\noptimization, higher-order solvers are supported for sampling. So we present a\nfaster variant, termed $\\textbf{MixGRPO-Flash}$, which further improves\ntraining efficiency while achieving comparable performance. MixGRPO exhibits\nsubstantial gains across multiple dimensions of human preference alignment,\noutperforming DanceGRPO in both effectiveness and efficiency, with nearly 50%\nlower training time.

By\nleveraging the CR-Calculus framework, we successfully construct a fully\ncomplex-valued white-box transformer with theoretically derived self-attention\nand residual multi-layer perceptron modules. Furthermore, to improve the\nmodel's ability to extract discriminative features from limited wireless data,\nwe introduce Subspace Regularization, a novel regularization strategy that\nenhances feature diversity, resulting in an average performance improvement of\n19.98% across multiple sensing tasks. We extensively evaluate RF-CRATE against\nseven baselines with multiple public and self-collected datasets involving\ndifferent RF signals. The results show that RF-CRATE achieves performance on\npar with thoroughly engineered black-box models, while offering full\nmathematical interpretability.

A key contribution of our work lies in the general treatment of $\nf_1 $ and $ f_2 $, which are neither (necessarily) asymptotically small nor\nrestricted to specific forms such as periodic or localised structures.\nFurthermore, our derivation of the front position formula circumvents the\ntraditional reliance on spectral analysis, enabling us to describe front\ndynamics beyond bifurcations from stationary fronts. This approach has the\npotential to be extended to other settings in which spectral properties at\nonset preclude conventional reduction techniques.",

    "abstract": "Mobile manipulation is a critical capability for robots operating in diverse,\nreal-world environments. However, manipulating deformable objects and materials\nremains a major challenge for existing robot learning algorithms. While various\nbenchmarks have been proposed to evaluate manipulation strategies with rigid\nobjects, there is still a notable lack of standardized benchmarks that address\nmobile manipulation tasks involving deformable objects.\n  To address this gap, we introduce MoDeSuite, the first Mobile Manipulation\nDeformable Object task suite, designed specifically for robot learning.\nMoDeSuite consists of eight distinct mobile manipulation tasks covering both\nelastic objects and deformable objects, each presenting a unique challenge\ninspired by real-world robot applications. Success in these tasks requires\neffective collaboration between the robot's base and manipulator, as well as\nthe ability to exploit the deformability of the objects. To evaluate and\ndemonstrate the use of the proposed benchmark, we train two state-of-the-art\nreinforcement learning algorithms and two imitation learning algorithms,\nhighlighting the difficulties encountered and showing their performance in\nsimulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate the practical relevance of the suite by\ndeploying the trained policies directly into the real world with the Spot\nrobot, showcasing the potential for sim-to-real transfer. We expect that\nMoDeSuite will open a novel research domain in mobile manipulation involving\ndeformable objects.

A subclass of this problem, the Discretizable Distance\nGeometry Problem (DDGP), allows a recursive solution via the combinatorial\nBranch-and-Prune (BP) algorithm by exploiting specific vertex orderings in\nprotein backbones. To accommodate the inherent uncertainty in NMR data, the\ninterval Branch-and-Prune (\\textit{i}BP) algorithm was introduced,\nincorporating interval distance constraints through uniform sampling. In this\nwork, we propose two new algorithmic frameworks for solving the\nthree-dimensional interval DDGP (\\textit{i}DDGP): the interval Angular\nBranch-and-Prune (\\textit{i}ABP), and its extension, the interval Torsion-angle\nBranch-and-Prune (\\textit{i}TBP). These methods convert interval distances into\nangular constraints, enabling structured sampling over circular arcs. The\n\\textit{i}ABP method guarantees feasibility by construction and removes the\nneed for explicit constraint checking. The \\textit{i}TBP algorithm further\nincorporates known torsion angle intervals, enforcing local chirality and\nplanarity conditions critical for protein geometry. We present formal\nmathematical foundations for both methods and a systematic strategy for\ngenerating biologically meaningful \\textit{i}DDGP instances from the Protein\nData Bank (PDB) structures.

In this\nstudy, we introduce a non-coercive extortion mechanism that leverages\ncommitments to outcome-contingent payments, demonstrating how a player or\nexternal agent can extract profit by offering rewards rather than threatening\npunishment.

In particular, an important derived distribution\nfrom degree distribution is the complementary cumulative degree histogram\n(ccdh). The ccdh is a fundamental summary of graph structure, capturing, for\neach threshold $d$, the number of vertices with degree at least $d$. For\napproximating ccdh, we consider the $(\\varepsilon_D,\\varepsilon_R)$-BiCriteria\nMultiplicative Approximation, which allows for controlled multiplicative slack\nin both the domain and the range. The exact complexity of the problem was not\nknown and had been posed as an open problem in WOLA 2019 [Sublinear.info,\nProblem 98].\n  In this work, we first design an algorithm that can approximate ccdh if a\nsuitable vertex sample and an edge sample can be obtained and thus, the\nalgorithm is independent of any sublinear model. Next, we show that in the\nstreaming and query models, these samples can be obtained efficiently. On the\nother end, we establish the first lower bounds for this problem in both query\nand streaming models, and (almost) settle the complexity of the problem across\nboth the sublinear models.",

This paper pioneers\nthis direction by introducing \\textbf{AU-LLM}, a novel framework that for the\nfirst time uses LLM to detect AUs in micro-expression datasets with subtle\nintensities and the scarcity of data. We specifically address the critical\nvision-language semantic gap, the \\textbf{Enhanced Fusion Projector (EFP)}.

Building on a\nfactorization lemma, which shows that any privacy mechanism can be decomposed\ninto an extremal mechanism followed by additional randomization, we reduce the\nFisher information maximization problem to a search over extremal mechanisms.\nThe representation of extremal mechanisms requires working in infinite\ndimensional spaces and invokes advanced tools from convex and functional\nanalysis, such as Choquet's theorem. Our analysis establishes matching upper\nand lower bounds on the Fisher information in the high privacy regime ($\\alpha\n\\to 0$), and proves that the maximization problem always admits a solution for\nany $\\alpha$. As a concrete application, we consider the problem of estimating\nthe parameter of a uniform distribution on $[0, \\theta]$ under $\\alpha$ LDP.\nGuided by our theoretical findings, we design an extremal mechanism that yields\na consistent and asymptotically efficient estimator in high privacy regime.\nNumerical experiments confirm our theoretical results.",

    "abstract": "The Near-InfraRed Planet Searcher (NIRPS) is a high-resolution,\nhigh-stability near-infrared (NIR) spectrograph equipped with an AO system.\nInstalled on the ESO 3.6-m telescope, it was developed to enable radial\nvelocity (RV) measurements of low-mass exoplanets around M dwarfs and to\ncharacterise exoplanet atmospheres in the NIR. This paper provides a\ncomprehensive design overview and characterisation of the NIRPS instrument,\nreporting on its on-sky performance, and presenting its GTO programme. The\ninstrument started its operations on 1 Apr 2023 after intensive on-sky testing\nphases. The spectral range continuously covers the Y, J, and H bands from 972.4\nto 1919.6 nm. The thermal control system maintains 1 mK stability over several\nmonths. The NIRPS AO-assisted fibre link improves coupling efficiency and\noffers a unique high-angular resolution capability with a fibre acceptance of\nonly 0.4 arcsec. A high spectral resolving power of 90 000 and 75 000 is\nprovided in HA and HE modes, respectively. The overall throughput from the top\nof the atmosphere to the detector peaks at 13 percent. The RV precision,\nmeasured on the bright star Proxima with a known exoplanetary system, is 77\ncm/s. NIRPS and HARPS can be used simultaneously, offering unprecedented\nspectral coverage for spectroscopic characterisation and stellar activity\nmitigation. Modal noise can be aptly mitigated by the implementation of fibre\nstretchers and AO scanning mode. Initial results confirm that NIRPS opens new\npossibilities for RV measurements, stellar characterisation, and exoplanet\natmosphere studies with high precision and high spectral fidelity. NIRPS\ndemonstrated stable RV precision at the level of 1 m/s over several weeks. The\ninstrument high throughput offers a notable improvement over previous\nspectrographs, enhancing our ability to detect small exoplanets.",

    "abstract": "Tendon-driven robotic hands offer unparalleled dexterity for manipulation\ntasks, but learning control policies for such systems presents unique\nchallenges. Unlike joint-actuated robotic hands, tendon-driven systems lack a\ndirect one-to-one mapping between motion capture (mocap) data and tendon\ncontrols, making the learning process complex and expensive. Additionally,\nvisual tracking methods for real-world applications are prone to occlusions and\ninaccuracies, further complicating joint tracking. Wrist-wearable surface\nelectromyography (sEMG) sensors present an inexpensive, robust alternative to\ncapture hand motion. However, mapping sEMG signals to tendon control remains a\nsignificant challenge despite the availability of EMG-to-pose data sets and\nregression-based models in the existing literature.\n  We introduce the first large-scale EMG-to-Tendon Control dataset for robotic\nhands, extending the emg2pose dataset, which includes recordings from 193\nsubjects, spanning 370 hours and 29 stages with diverse gestures. This dataset\nincorporates tendon control signals derived using the MyoSuite MyoHand model,\naddressing limitations such as invalid poses in prior methods. We provide three\nbaseline regression models to demonstrate emg2tendon utility and propose a\nnovel diffusion-based regression model for predicting tendon control from sEMG\nrecordings.

In this work, we present MoR-ViT, a\nnovel vision transformer framework that, for the first time, incorporates a\ntoken-level dynamic recursion mechanism inspired by the Mixture-of-Recursions\n(MoR) paradigm. This approach enables each token to adaptively determine its\nprocessing depth, yielding a flexible and input-dependent allocation of\ncomputational resources. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K and transfer\nbenchmarks demonstrate that MoR-ViT not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy\nwith up to 70% parameter reduction and 2.5x inference acceleration, but also\noutperforms leading efficient ViT baselines such as DynamicViT and TinyViT\nunder comparable conditions.

This is demonstrated by\nfocusing on spinodal decomposition in the presence of a lattice mismatch eta,\nand by carrying out an extensive comparison between the ground-truth evolution\nsupplied by phase field simulations and the predictions of suitable\nconvolutional recurrent neural network architectures. The two tasks may then be\nperformed subsequently into a cascade framework.

    "abstract": "With the large-scale integration of electric vehicles (EVs) in the\ndistribution grid, the unpredictable nature of EV charging introduces\nconsiderable uncertainties to the grid's real-time operations. This can\nexacerbate load fluctuations, compromise power quality, and pose risks to the\ngrid's stability and security. However, due to their dual role as controllable\nloads and energy storage devices, EVs have the potential to mitigate these\nfluctuations, balance the variability of renewable energy sources, and provide\nancillary services that support grid stability. By leveraging the bidirectional\nflow of information and energy in smart grids, the adverse effects of EV\ncharging can be minimized and even converted into beneficial outcomes through\neffective real-time management strategies. This paper explores the negative\nimpacts of EV charging on the distribution system's real-time operations and\noutlines methods to transform these challenges into positive contributions.\nAdditionally, it provides an in-depth analysis of the real-time management\nsystem for EV charging, focusing on state estimation and management strategies.",

Here, we implement a Fourier method that\nemploys fast trigonometric expansions on a uniform grid with non-periodic\nboundaries using fast discrete sine transforms (DST) or/and discrete cosine\ntransforms (DCT) to solve parabolic PDEs. We implement this method in two ways:\neither using a Fourier spectral derivative or a Fourier interaction picture\napproach. These methods can treat vector fields with a combination of Dirichlet\nand/or Neumann boundary conditions in one or more space dimensions. We use them\nto solve a variety of PDEs with analytical solutions, including the Peregrine\nsolitary wave solution. For the 1D heat equation problem, our method with an\ninteraction picture is accurate up to the machine precision. A soluble example\nof an SPDE with non-periodic boundaries is also treated. We compare the results\nobtained from these algorithms with those from publicly available solvers that\nuse either polynomial spectral or finite element methods. For problems with\nsolutions that vary rapidly in space, our method outperforms the other methods\nby recording lower spatial discretization errors, as well being faster in many\ncases, due to the efficiency improvements given by fast transforms.",

Many existing solutions rely on\ncomputationally demanding deep learning models, which result in high latency\nand are unsuitable for embedded robotic devices with limited resources (such as\nintelligent vehicles/cars) where rapid detection is necessary to prevent\naccidents. This paper introduces LiteFat, a lightweight spatio-temporal graph\nlearning model designed to detect driver fatigue efficiently while maintaining\nhigh accuracy and low computational demands. LiteFat involves converting\nstreaming video data into spatio-temporal graphs (STG) using facial landmark\ndetection, which focuses on key motion patterns and reduces unnecessary data\nprocessing. LiteFat uses MobileNet to extract facial features and create a\nfeature matrix for the STG. A lightweight spatio-temporal graph neural network\nis then employed to identify signs of fatigue with minimal processing and low\nlatency. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that LiteFat performs\ncompetitively while significantly decreasing computational complexity and\nlatency as compared to current state-of-the-art methods.

Prior theoretical works hinted at\nthe key role of capability accumulation in shaping production activities and\nperformance, without however producing product-level indicators able to\nforecast corporate growth. Building on economic complexity theory and the\ncorporate growth literature, this paper examines which characteristics of a\nfirm's export basket predict future performance. We analyze a unique\nlongitudinal dataset that covers export and financial data for 12,852 Italian\nfirms. We find that firms exporting products typically exported by wealthier\ncountries -- a proxy for greater product sophistication and market value --\ntend to experience higher growth and profit per employee. Moreover, we find\nthat diversification outside of a firm's core production area is positively\nassociated with future growth, whereas diversification within the core is\nnegatively associated. This is revealed by introducing novel measures of\nin-block and out-of-block diversification, based on algorithmically-detected\nproduction blocks. Our findings suggest that growth is driven not just by how\nmany products a firm exports, but also by where these products lie within the\nproduction ecosystem, at both local and global scales.",

Deep Learning (DL) has been\nat the center of modern CPath, and while it delivers unprecedented performance,\nit is also known that DL may be affected by irrelevant details, such as those\nintroduced during scanning by different commercially available scanners. This\nmay lead to scanner bias, where the model outputs for the same tissue acquired\nby different scanners may vary. In turn, it hinders the trust of clinicians in\nCPath-based tools and their deployment in real-world clinical practices. Recent\npathology Foundation Models (FMs) promise to provide better domain\ngeneralization capabilities. In this paper, we benchmark FMs using a\nmulti-scanner dataset and show that FMs still suffer from scanner bias.\nFollowing this observation, we propose ScanGen, a contrastive loss function\napplied during task-specific fine-tuning that mitigates scanner bias, thereby\nenhancing the models' robustness to scanner variations. Our approach is applied\nto the Multiple Instance Learning task of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor\n(EGFR) mutation prediction from H\\&E-stained WSIs in lung cancer.

We\ndetect the radial velocity signal of Proxima b in the NIRPS data. All planetary\ncharacteristics are consistent with those previously derived using visible\nlight spectrographs. In addition, we find evidence of the presence of the\nsub-Earth Proxima d in the NIRPS data. When combining the data with the HARPS\nobservations taken simultaneous to NIRPS, we obtain a tentative detection of\nProxima d and parameters consistent with those measured with ESPRESSO. By\ncombining the NIRPS data with simultaneously obtained HARPS observations and\narchival data, we confirm the existence of Proxima d, and demonstrate that its\nparameters are stable over time and against change of instrument. We refine the\nplanetary parameters of Proxima b and d, and find inconclusive evidence of the\nsignal attributed to Proxima c (P = 1900 d) being present in the data. We\nmeasure Proxima b and d to have minimum masses of 1.055 $\\pm$ 0.055 Me, and\n0.260 $\\pm$ 0.038 Me, respectively. Our results show that, in the case of\nProxima, NIRPS provides more precise radial velocity data than HARPS, and a\nmore significant detection of the planetary signals. The standard deviation of\nthe residuals of NIRPS after the fit is 80 cm/s, showcasing the potential of\nNIRPS to measure precise radial velocities in the near-infrared.",

    "abstract": "Training neural networks can be challenging, especially as the complexity of\nthe problem increases. Despite using wider or deeper networks, training them\ncan be a tedious process, especially if a wrong choice of the hyperparameter is\nmade. The learning rate is one of such crucial hyperparameters, which is\nusually kept static during the training process. Learning dynamics in complex\nsystems often requires a more adaptive approach to the learning rate. This\nadaptability becomes crucial to effectively navigate varying gradients and\noptimize the learning process during the training process. In this paper, a\ndynamic learning rate scheduler (DLRS) algorithm is presented that adapts the\nlearning rate based on the loss values calculated during the training process.\nExperiments are conducted on problems related to physics-informed neural\nnetworks (PINNs) and image classification using multilayer perceptrons and\nconvolutional neural networks, respectively. The results demonstrate that the\nproposed DLRS accelerates training and improves stability.",

    "abstract": "The QCD Critical Point is a pivotal feature of the phase diagram of strongly\ninteracting matter. Signatures of the critical point are expected to manifest\nthrough the non-monotonic behavior of higher-order moments of conserved\nquantities, such as net-baryon ($\\Delta B$), net-charge ($\\Delta Q$), and\nnet-strangeness ($\\Delta S$), as a function of collision energy. These moments\nare connected to the thermodynamic susceptibilities, as well as to the\ncorrelation length developed in the system, which diverges at the critical\npoint. The non-monotonic behavior of higher-order moments and their\nvolume-independent products near the critical region supports the presence of a\ncritical point in a finite system existing for a finite time, due to their\nsensitivity to critical fluctuations. These fluctuations are believed to\nprovide key evidence in the search for the QCD Critical Point.

To tackle this, we propose AdvRF, a novel\nadversarial reconstruction feedback framework aimed at learning\ncategory-agnostic discrepancy representations.

The reconstruction model exposes residual\ndiscrepancies overlooked by the retrieval model, forcing it to improve\nlocalization accuracy, while the refined signals from the retrieval model guide\nthe reconstruction model to improve its reconstruction ability. Consequently,\nthe retrieval model localizes visual differences, while the reconstruction\nmodel encodes these differences into category-agnostic representations. This\nrepresentation is then transferred to the retrieval model through knowledge\ndistillation for efficient deployment.

CARPTDSC has two main challenges about time\nconsumption. First, it is an NP-hard problem. Second, the time-dependent\nservice costs of tasks require frequent evaluations during the search process,\nsignificantly increasing computational effort. These challenges make it\ndifficult for existing algorithms to perform efficient searches, often\nresulting in limited efficiency. To address these issues, this paper proposes a\nknowledge-guided memetic algorithm with golden section search and negatively\ncorrelated search (KGMA-GN), where two knowledge-guided strategies are\nintroduced to improve search efficiency. First, a knowledge-guided\ninitialization strategy (KGIS) is proposed to generate high-quality initial\nsolutions to speed up convergence. Second, a knowledge-guided small-step-size\nlocal search strategy (KGSLSS) is proposed to filter out invalid moves, thereby\nreducing unnecessary evaluations and saving the computation time. Experimental\nresults on five benchmark test sets, including both small- and larger-scale\ninstances, demonstrate that KGMA-GN achieves higher search efficiency than the\nstate-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the ablation study further confirms that\nthe knowledge-guided local search operators in KGSLSS can significantly reduce\nruntime compared to traditional operators, especially for the knowledge-guided\nswap operator, which achieves more than a tenfold improvement in speed.",

More the optimality\nof the measurement, the better will be the improvement in sensing the value of\nthe unknown parameter. Pertaining to the case of a two level system (qubit)\nundergoing rotation, a typical metrological task concerns the estimation of the\nangle of rotation ($\\tau$) given the information about the axis of rotation\n($\\theta,\\phi$). The method for garnering information about ($\\tau)$ is through\nmaximizing the Fisher information. In the absence of the axis-knowledge, the\noptimality of the metrological task reduces drastically. Drawing inspiration\nfrom recent works leveraging entanglement to connect closed time-like curves\nand metrology, we overcome this limitation (lack of the knowledge of the\nrotation axis) using an ancilla assisted protocol. Here, the probe and the\nancilla interact through a coherently controlled superposition of unitary\nevolutions. The quantum coherence in the initial state of the ancilla forms as\nthe resource aiding the protocol. By measuring the ancilla in the same coherent\nbasis in which it was prepared, we achieve optimal Fisher information about the\nrotation angle, independent of the axis parameters.

    "abstract": "In this study, we systematically investigate the thermal and electronic\ntransport properties of two-dimensional PbSe/PbTe monolayer heterostructure by\ncombining first-principles calculations, Boltzmann transport theory, and\nmachine learning methods. The heterostructure exhibits a unique honeycomb-like\ncorrugated and asymmetric configuration, which significantly enhances phonon\nscattering. Moreover, the relatively weak interatomic interactions in PbSe/PbTe\nlead to the formation of anti-bonding states, resulting in strong anharmonicity\nand ultimately yielding ultralow lattice thermal conductivity (${\\kappa_{\\rm\nL}}$). In the four-phonon scattering model, the ${\\kappa_{\\rm L}}$~values along\nthe $x$ and $y$ directions are as low as 0.37 and 0.31 W/mK, respectively.\nContrary to the conventional view that long mean free path acoustic phonons\ndominate heat transport, we find that optical phonons contribute approximately\n59\\% of the lattice thermal conductivity in this heterostructure. These optical\nphonons exhibit large Gr\\\"uneisen parameters, strong anharmonic scattering, and\nrelatively high group velocities, thereby playing a crucial role in the low\n${\\kappa_{\\rm L}}$ regime. Further analysis of thermoelectric performance shows\nthat at a high temperature of 800 K, the heterostructure achieves an\nexceptional dimensionless figure of merit ($ZT$) of 5.3 along the $y$\ndirection, indicating outstanding thermoelectric conversion efficiency. These\nfindings not only provide theoretical insights into the transport mechanisms of\nPbSe/PbTe monolayer heterostructure but also offer a practical design strategy\nfor developing high-performance two-dimensional layered thermoelectric\nmaterials.",

    "abstract": "Let $(X,E_X)$ and $(V,E_V)$ be finite connected graphs without loops. We\nassume that $V$ has two distinguished vertices $a,b$ and an automorphism\n$\\gamma$ which exchanges $a$ and~$b$. The $V$-edge substitution of $X$ is the\ngraph $X[V]$ where each edge $[x,y] \\in E_X$ is replaced by a copy of $V$,\nidentifying $x$ with $a$ and $y$ with $b$ or vice versa. (The latter choice\ndoes not matter; it yields isomorphic graphs.) The aim is to describe the\nspectrum of $X[V]$ in terms of the spectra of $X$ and $V$. Instead of the\nspectra of the adjacency matrices, we consider the versions which are\nnormalised by dividing each row by the row sum (the vertex degree). These are\nstochastic, reversible matrices, and our approach applies more generally to\nreversible transition matrices corresponding to arbitrary positive edge weights\ninvariant under $\\gamma$. We write $P$ for the transition matrix over $X$ and\n$Q$ for the one over $V$. Together, they induce the matrix $P_*$ over $X[V]$.\n  The main part of the spectrum of $P_*$ is the response of the natural\nfrequencies of $X$ to substituting $V$, given by a functional equation coming\nfrom a rational function induced by~$Q$. A second part comes from specific\neigenvalues of $Q$, if present. Finally, there is the part of\n$\\mathsf{spec}(P_*)$ whose eigenfunctions have $X$ as a nodal set. The results\ndepend on issues like whether $X$ has circles of even length and on the\neigenvalues of the restriction of $Q$ to $V \\setminus \\{ a,b\\}$, which are\nclassified into 4 possible types. Quite subtle is the issue of determining the\nmultiplicities of the latter as eigenvalues of $P_*$ in terms of the input.",

Existing methods can be\nroughly categorized into template matching and autoregressive methods, where\nthe former usually neglects the temporal dependencies across frames and the\nlatter tends to get biased towards the object categories during training,\nshowing weak generalizability to unseen classes. To address these issues, some\nmethods propose to adapt the video foundation model SAM2 for VOT, where the\ntracking results of each frame would be encoded as memory for conditioning the\nrest of frames in an autoregressive manner. Nevertheless, existing methods fail\nto overcome the challenges of object occlusions and distractions, and do not\nhave any measures to intercept the propagation of tracking errors. To tackle\nthem, we present a SAMITE model, built upon SAM2 with additional modules,\nincluding: (1) Prototypical Memory Bank: We propose to quantify the\nfeature-wise and position-wise correctness of each frame's tracking results,\nand select the best frames to condition subsequent frames. As the features of\noccluded and distracting objects are feature-wise and position-wise inaccurate,\ntheir scores would naturally be lower and thus can be filtered to intercept\nerror propagation; (2) Positional Prompt Generator: To further reduce the\nimpacts of distractors, we propose to generate positional mask prompts to\nprovide explicit positional clues for the target, leading to more accurate\ntracking. Extensive experiments have been conducted on six benchmarks, showing\nthe superiority of SAMITE. The code is available at\nhttps://github.com/Sam1224/SAMITE.",

These results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of embedding physics knowledge into the machine\nlearning model.

The search is based on far\nultra-violet redshift priors from HST and FUSE, and it has resulted in the\nidentification of 34 possible O VII and O VIII absorption-line systems at the\n99% confidence level, out of a search in 1,224 systems with fixed redshift\npriors. Of these, 7 O VII and 8 O VIII systems pass additional screening\ncriteria and are deemed to be associated with the warm-hot intergalactic medium\n(WHIM). We find that the cosmological baryon density associated with these\npossible detections is consistent with the value required to solve the missing\nbaryons problem. Specifically, we find that $\\Omega_{WHIM,X} /\\Omega_b =\n0.83\\pm^{3.99}_{0.62}$ from the O VII lines, at the 68% level of confidence\n(assuming 20% Solar abundances and 100% ionization fraction), or separately\n$\\Omega_{WHIM,X} /\\Omega_b = 0.79\\pm^{3.08}_{0.50}$ from the O VIII lines\n(assuming 20% Solar abundances 50% ionization fraction). We also conducted an\nextensive analysis of systematic errors affecting these estimates, and provided\nevidence of the association between the detected X-ray absorption line systems\nwith known filaments of SDSS galaxies. The results of this analysis therefore\ncontributes to the characterization of the missing baryons and it indicates\nthat they are in fact associated with the high-temperature portion of the\nwarm-hot intergalactic medium, and possibly with large-scale WHIM filaments\ntraced by galaxies, as consistently predicted by numerical simulations and by\nother independent probes.",

The\nmethod is tested on two idealized ventricular geometries exhibiting distinct\nflow regimes to assess its robustness under different hemodynamic conditions.\nBy leveraging a small number of training snapshots and focusing on the dominant\nperiodic components representing the physics of the system, the HODMD-based\nmodel accurately reconstructs the flow field over entire cardiac cycles and\nprovides reliable long-term predictions beyond the training window.

Recent X-ray polarimetry results with the Imaging X-ray\nPolarimetry Explorer have revealed it as a concealed ultraluminous X-ray\nsource. It is also the first source where pronounced orbital variability of\nX-ray polarization has been detected -- notably with only one polarization\nmaximum per orbit. Polarization caused by scattering of the source X-rays can\nonly be orbitally variable if the scattering angles change throughout the\norbit. Since this requires an asymmetrically distributed medium around the\ncompact object, the observed variability traces the intrabinary structures. The\nsingle-peaked profile further imposes constraints on the possible geometry of\nthe surrounding medium. Therefore, the X-ray polarization of Cygnus X-3 is the\nfirst opportunity to study the wind structures of high-mass X-ray binaries in\ndetail. We aim to uncover the underlying geometry through analytical modeling\nof the polarized variability. Knowledge of these structures could be extended\nto other sources with similar wind-binary interactions. We study the\nvariability caused by single scattering in the intrabinary bow shock, exploring\nboth the optically thin and optically thick limits. We consider two geometries\nof the reflecting medium, the axisymmetric parabolic bow shock and the\nparabolic cylinder shock, and determine the geometry that best matches the\nX-ray polarimetric data. We find that the peculiar properties of the data can\nonly be replicated with a cylindrical bow shock with asymmetry across the shock\ncenterline and significant optical depth.

    "abstract": "Dynamic programming (DP) is a fundamental tool used across many engineering\nfields. The main goal of DP is to solve Bellman's optimality equations for a\ngiven Markov decision process (MDP). Standard methods like policy iteration\nexploit the fixed-point nature of these equations to solve them iteratively.\nHowever, these algorithms can be computationally expensive when the\nstate-action space is large or when the problem involves long-term\ndependencies. Here we propose a new approach that unrolls and truncates policy\niterations into a learnable parametric model dubbed BellNet, which we train to\nminimize the so-termed Bellman error from random value function\ninitializations. Viewing the transition probability matrix of the MDP as the\nadjacency of a weighted directed graph, we draw insights from graph signal\nprocessing to interpret (and compactly re-parameterize) BellNet as a cascade of\nnonlinear graph filters. This fresh look facilitates a concise, transferable,\nand unifying representation of policy and value iteration, with an explicit\nhandle on complexity during inference. Preliminary experiments conducted in a\ngrid-like environment demonstrate that BellNet can effectively approximate\noptimal policies in a fraction of the iterations required by classical methods.",

This study employs angle-resolved\nphotoemission spectroscopy and first-principles calculations to elucidate the\ncharge and orbital kinetics of the anomalous two-step negative thermal\nexpansion structural phase transitions in PbTa2Se4. As the temperature\ndecreases, each transition undergoes a similar block-layer sliding, although\nthe charge transfer behaviors differ significantly. During the first\ntransition, charge is mainly transferred from the Pb 6pz orbital to an M-shaped\nband below the Fermi level, barely altering the Fermi surface. In contrast, the\nsecond transition involves modifications to both the Fermi surface and\ncharge-transfer orbitals, with charge selectively transferred from Pb 6px/py\norbitals to Ta 5dz2 orbitals and a decrease of the Fermi pockets formed by Pb\n6px/py orbitals. Furthermore, a small pressure can easily tune the base\nstructure phase among the three phases and the corresponding superconductivity.\nTherefore, our findings reveal that the orbital-selective charge transfer\ndrives the unusual structure transition in PbTa2Se4, offering new insights into\nthe NTE mechanisms and providing a unique window to study the pressure-tuned\nsuperconductivity in this metal-intercalated transition chalcogenides.",

Consequently,\ntraining-free methods, particularly patch-based approaches, have become a\npopular alternative. These methods divide an image into patches and fuse the\ndenoising paths of each patch, showing strong performance on high-resolution\ngeneration. However, we observe two critical issues for patch-based approaches,\nwhich we call ``patch-level distribution shift\" and ``increased patch\nmonotonicity.\" To address these issues, we propose Adaptive Path Tracing (APT),\na framework that combines Statistical Matching to ensure patch distributions\nremain consistent in upsampled latents and Scale-aware Scheduling to deal with\nthe patch monotonicity. As a result, APT produces clearer and more refined\ndetails in high-resolution images.

Conventional methods\noften rely on boundary particles or wall re-normalization approaches derived\nfrom applying the divergence theorem, whereas our method directly evaluates the\narea integrals for SPH kernels and gradients over triangular boundaries. This\ndirect integration strategy inherently accommodates higher-order boundary\nconditions, such as piecewise cubic fields defined via Finite Element stencils,\nenabling analytic and flexible coupling with mesh-based solvers. At the core of\nour approach is a general solution for compact polynomials of arbitrary degree\nover triangles by decomposing the boundary elements into elementary integrals\nthat can be solved with closed-form solutions. We provide a complete,\nclosed-form solution for these generalized integrals, derived by relating the\nangular components to Chebyshev polynomials and solving the resulting radial\nintegral via a numerically stable evaluation of the Gaussian hypergeometric\nfunction $_2F_1$. Our solution is robust and adaptable and works regardless of\ntriangle geometries and kernel functions. We validate the accuracy against\nhigh-precision numerical quadrature rules, as well as in problems with known\nexact solutions. We provide an open-source implementation of our general\nsolution using differentiable programming to facilitate the adoption of our\napproach to SPH and other contexts that require analytic integration over\npolygonal domains. Our analytic solution outperforms existing numerical\nquadrature rules for this problem by up to five orders of magnitude, for\nintegrals and their gradients, while providing a flexible framework to couple\narbitrary triangular meshes analytically to Lagrangian schemes, building a\nstrong foundation for addressing several grand challenges in SPH and beyond.",

Applications\nbuilt with CSM are composed of state machines that collaborate autonomously and\ncan be distributed across different layers of the continuum.

In addition to introducing\nthe CSM programming model, we present a runtime system and a comprehensive\nevaluation of our approach. This evaluation is based on three use cases: a\nstress test on a large-scale infrastructure, a surveillance system application,\nand a complex smart factory scenario, all deployed on the Grid'5000 testbed.\nOur results demonstrate a 12x increase in throughput through novel language\nfeatures in the stress test.

    "abstract": "We explore the possibility of retrieving cosmological information from 21-cm\ntomographic data at intermediate redshift. The first step in our approach\nconsists of training an encoder, composed of several three dimensional\nconvolutional layers, to cast the neutral hydrogen 3D data into a lower\ndimension latent space. Once pre-trained, the featurizer is able to generate 3D\ngrid representations which, in turn, will be mapped onto cosmology\n($\\Omega_{\\rm m}$, $\\sigma_{8}$) via likelihood-free inference. For the latter,\nwhich is framed as a density estimation problem, we consider a Bayesian\napproximation method which exploits the capacity of Masked Autoregressive Flow\nto estimate the posterior. It is found that the representations learned by the\ndeep encoder are separable in latent space. Results show that the neural\ndensity estimator, trained on the latent codes, is able to constrain cosmology\nwith a precision of $R^2 \\ge 0.91$ on all parameters and that most of the\nground truth of the instances in the test set fall within $1\\sigma$\nuncertainty. It is established that the posterior uncertainty from the density\nestimator is reasonably calibrated. We also investigate the robustness of the\nfeature extractor by using it to compress out-of-distribution dataset, that is\neither from a different simulation or from the same simulation but at different\nredshift. We find that, while trained on the latent codes corresponding to\ndifferent types of out-of-distribution dataset, the probabilistic model is\nstill reasonably capable of constraining cosmology, with $R^2 \\ge 0.80$ in\ngeneral. This highlights both the predictive power of the density estimator\nconsidered in this work and the meaningfulness of the latent codes retrieved by\nthe encoder. We believe that the approach prescribed in this proof of concept\nwill be of great use when analyzing 21-cm data from various surveys in the near\nfuture.",

We\npropose a new method using multi-band continuum reverberation mapping to\nidentify low-mass-ratio SMBHBs in active galactic nuclei. The basic principle\nis that, due to the presence of a low-density cavity between the mini-disks and\nthe circumbinary disk, the continuum emissions show a deficit at certain\nwavelengths, leading to a distinguishing feature in the relation between the\ninter-band time lag and wavelengths $\\tau(\\lambda)$. Specifically, the relation\nappears flat at short wavelengths because of the truncated sizes of the\nmini-disks and transits to a power law $\\lambda^{4/3}$ at long wavelength\nstemming from the circumbinary disk. This transition feature is distinct from\nthe uniform relation $\\lambda^{4/3}$ of the standard accretion disk around a\nsingle black hole. Using the lamp-post scenario and assuming that only the\nsecondary black hole is active in a low-mass-ratio SMBHB, we design a simple\ncontinuum reverberation model to calculate the transfer function of the\naccretion disks and the resulting $\\tau(\\lambda)$ relations for various SMBHB\norbital parameters. The transition wavelength typically can lie at UV/optical\nbands, mainly depending on the total mass and orbital separation of the SMBHB.\nWe apply our SMBHB model to the intensive multiwavelength monitoring data of\nthe SMBHB candidate PG1302-102 and find that the SMBHB model can reproduce the\ninter-band time lags. Remarkably, the inferred total mass and orbital period\nfrom the SMBHB fitting are consistent with values derived from other\nindependent methods.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) is often viewed as a powerful data analysis tool that\nis easy to learn because of its black-box nature. Yet this very nature also\nmakes it difficult to quantify confidence in predictions extracted from ML\nmodels, and more fundamentally, to understand how such models are mathematical\nabstractions of training data. The goal of this paper is to unravel these\nissues and their connections to uncertainty quantification (UQ) by pursuing a\nline of reasoning motivated by diagnostics. In such settings, prevalence - i.e.\nthe fraction of elements in class - is often of inherent interest. Here we\nanalyze the many interpretations of prevalence to derive a level-set theory of\nclassification, which shows that certain types of self-consistent ML models are\nequivalent to class-conditional probability distributions. We begin by studying\nthe properties of binary Bayes optimal classifiers, recognizing that their\nboundary sets can be reinterpreted as level-sets of pairwise density ratios. By\nparameterizing Bayes classifiers in terms of the prevalence, we then show that\nthey satisfy important monotonicity and class-switching properties that can be\nused to deduce the density ratios without direct access to the boundary sets.\nMoreover, this information is sufficient for tasks such as constructing the\nmulticlass Bayes-optimal classifier and estimating inherent uncertainty in the\nclass assignments. In the multiclass case, we use these results to deduce\nnormalization and self-consistency conditions, the latter being equivalent to\nthe law of total probability for classifiers. We also show that these are\nnecessary conditions for arbitrary ML models to have valid probabilistic\ninterpretations. Throughout we demonstrate how this analysis informs the\nbroader task of UQ for ML via an uncertainty propagation framework.",

Our model successfully reproduces the observed SED and is\nconsistent with the apastron-to-periastron flux ratio, resulting in a dip in\nemission at periastron passage and an increase during apastron.

At room temperature, the measured loss\ntangents were $\\tan\\delta_{||}^{295,\\mathrm{K}} = (4.1 \\pm 1.4) \\times 10^{-5}$\nand $\\tan\\delta_{\\perp}^{295,\\mathrm{K}} = (3.64 \\pm 0.92) \\times 10^{-5}$.\nUpon cooling to 4 K, the loss tangents improved by approximately two orders of\nmagnitude, reaching $\\tan\\delta_{||}^{4,\\mathrm{K}} = (1.56 \\pm 0.52) \\times\n10^{-7}$ and $\\tan\\delta_{\\perp}^{4,\\mathrm{K}} = (2.05 \\pm 0.79) \\times\n10^{-7}$. These cryogenic values are higher than those reported in prior\nstudies, likely due to a magnetic loss channel associated with an unidentified\nparamagnetic spin ensemble. These findings have implications for the use of\nCaWO$_4$ in applications such as spin-based quantum systems and cryogenic\nbolometry, highlighting the potential of WGMs for novel sensing applications.",

In this thesis, we construct the $\nP(\\phi)_2 $ Quantum Field Theory (QFT) model on curved surfaces and show that\nit satisfies Segal's axioms (arXiv:2403.12804). An important ingredient in this\nconstruction is the use of a local regularization procedure to define the\ninteraction as a random variable with respect to the Gaussian Free Field (GFF).\nWe provide a counterexample demonstrating that spectral truncation\nregularization violates locality (arXiv:2312.15511). We then explain how\nSegal's formalism can be extended to the gluing of surfaces with slits, which\noffers a geometric interpretation of the entanglement entropy. Using this\ninterpretation, we exploit the Polyakov anomaly formula in Conformal Field\nTheory (CFT) and apply a simple renormalization procedure to define a quantity\ncorresponding to entanglement entropy within this geometric interpretation. We\nthen show that this quantity behaves like a CFT correlation function. This\nallows us to rigorously derive an entropy calculation of Cardy and Calabrese\n(arXiv:2501.19014). Finally, Segal's formalism is also related to the\nasymptotics of zeta determinants on surfaces of large genus where the genus\ntends to infinity (arXiv:2505.01586).

Recently, Graph-Enhanced LLMs emerge as a\npromising graph learning approach that converts graph information into prompts,\nexploiting LLMs' ability to reason over both textual and structural\ninformation. Among them, text-only prompting, which converts graph information\nto prompts consisting solely of text tokens, offers a solution that relies only\non LLM tuning without requiring additional graph-specific encoders. However,\ntext-only prompting struggles on heterogeneous fraud-detection graphs:\nmulti-hop relations expand exponentially with each additional hop, leading to\nrapidly growing neighborhoods associated with dense textual information. These\nneighborhoods may overwhelm the model with long, irrelevant content in the\nprompt and suppress key signals from the target node, thereby degrading\nperformance. To address this challenge, we propose Dual Granularity Prompting\n(DGP), which mitigates information overload by preserving fine-grained textual\ndetails for the target node while summarizing neighbor information into\ncoarse-grained text prompts. DGP introduces tailored summarization strategies\nfor different data modalities, bi-level semantic abstraction for textual fields\nand statistical aggregation for numerical features, enabling effective\ncompression of verbose neighbor content into concise, informative prompts.\nExperiments across public and industrial datasets demonstrate that DGP operates\nwithin a manageable token budget while improving fraud detection performance by\nup to 6.8% (AUPRC) over state-of-the-art methods, showing the potential of\nGraph-Enhanced LLMs for fraud detection.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the evolution of spectral energy distribution (SED) and\nunderlying electron energy distribution (EED) by modeling the nearly\nsimultaneous broadband spectra of selected bright 4FGL blazars, in the context\nof a combined cooling and stochastic acceleration scenario. We find that\none-zone leptonic model with log-parabolic (LP) EED can successfully fit the\nGeV-TeV emission of blazars. The synchrotron frequency $\\nu_s$ of blazars\nmainly evolves due to variation of electron peak energy $\\gamma_{3p}$. The BL\nLac objects (BL Lacs) show a negative trend in the $\\nu_s- \\nu_s L_s$ SED\nplane, known as blazar sequence, that does not seem to be an artifact of\nDoppler boosting, but driven by the equipartition constraints. A positive\ncorrelation is found between the derived magnetic field $B$ and electron\ndensity $n_e$, whereas $n_e$ and $\\gamma_{3p}$ negatively relate, as expected\nin an equipartition scenario. The flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) deviate\nsignificantly from such a scenario, indicating their jet parameters should be\nvarying independently. The synchrotron peak frequency $\\nu_s$ and its spectral\ncurvature $b_s$ negatively correlate for all blazars, confirming the stochastic\nparticle acceleration in blazar jets. However, blazars do not show the\nsignature of hard-sphere acceleration, indicating that magnetic turbulence in\nthe jets might be soft and physical conditions might be near to steady state,\nconsistent with equipartition. Furthermore, for BL Lacs, the SED curvature\n$b_s$ and the EED curvature $r$ and nearly meet the theoretical relationship\n$r=5b_s$, whereas the FSRQs show large deviation due to poor constrain on $b_s$\ndue to presence of thermal component.",

As an example, 1-year averaged areas of\nCHs located within 30 degrees of the solar equator yield a correlation of 0.9\nwith 1-year averaged solar wind speed.

We report the\nfirst detection of weak PAH emission at 6.2, 7.7, and 8.6 microns in the\nSpitzer/IRS spectrum from 2005. The inner wall destruction in the 2022 JWST\nepoch allowed more ultraviolet photons to reach the outer disk, increasing the\nflux levels of PAH bands and enabling their detection well above the continuum.\nThe 11.2 micron PAH flux increases by a factor of three, yet its profile shape\nremains remarkably stable.

Our analysis uncovers a unique\nquasi-chain configuration within the crystal structure, characterized by\nstrongly covalent Se-Se-Se trimers that act as localized rigid units, while Rb\natoms occupy weakly bonded interstitial sites. This configuration induces\npronounced anisotropy, weak bonding, and strong anharmonicity, leading to\nsignificant rattling-like behavior of all atoms and a dominance of\nlow-frequency phonon modes. The interplay between the rigid Se trimers and the\nsoft Rb matrix results in extreme phonon anharmonicity, as evidenced by large\nGruneisen parameters and high atomic displacement parameters (ADPs). These\nfindings provide a comprehensive understanding of the low lattice thermal\nconductivity in Rb2Se3 and establish a universal framework for designing low\nlattice thermal conductivity materials through the combination of rigid\ncovalent clusters and soft ionic sublattices.",

    "abstract": "Magneto-transport properties of a two-dimensional electron gas in a chain of\nplanar quantum rings are investigated under the Rashba spin-orbit interaction\nand a transverse homogeneous magnetic field. A modulation potential function\nmodels the ring-chain periodicity along one direction and the confinement in\nthe perpendicular one. The electron energy minibands collapse into discrete\nlevels with high degeneracy at specific magnetic field values. The Rashba\neffect significantly influences the system's properties. Calculations reveal a\ntransition from diamagnetic to paramagnetic behavior in the spin-difference\norbital magnetization at high Rashba coupling strengths. This is consistent\nwith the reversal of the spin-difference persistent current observed at the\nsame Rashba values. Total and spin-difference magnetizations exhibit\noscillations linked to miniband nodes. The longitudinal magnetoconductance\ncomponent shows oscillations resembling Shubnikov-De Haas behavior, while the\ntransverse component displays a ladder-like profile reminiscent of the quantum\nHall effect. However, both phenomena are more closely associated with the\nperiodic collapse of minibands, leading to strong density-of-states\noscillations, rather than with the mechanisms behind the quantum Hall effect.\nThis highlights the rich physics of quantum topological phases in\nnanostructures with non-trivial geometry. At high Rashba coupling, this\nbehavior degrades. Spin magnetization shows pronounced oscillations, indicating\ncomplex interplay between the Zeeman and Rashba effects on spin polarization.\nThese results offer insights into experimentally relevant electronic and spin\ncharacteristics attainable in modulated semiconductor structures, contributing\nto the development of advanced 2D-based materials for magneto-transport and\nspintronics applications.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, diffusion models have been widely adopted for image\ninpainting tasks due to their powerful generative capabilities, achieving\nimpressive results. Existing multimodal inpainting methods based on diffusion\nmodels often require architectural modifications and retraining, resulting in\nhigh computational cost. In contrast, context-aware diffusion inpainting\nmethods leverage the model's inherent priors to adjust intermediate denoising\nsteps, enabling high-quality inpainting without additional training and\nsignificantly reducing computation. However, these methods lack fine-grained\ncontrol over the masked regions, often leading to semantically inconsistent or\nvisually implausible content. To address this issue, we propose GuidPaint, a\ntraining-free, class-guided image inpainting framework. By incorporating\nclassifier guidance into the denoising process, GuidPaint enables precise\ncontrol over intermediate generations within the masked areas, ensuring both\nsemantic consistency and visual realism. Furthermore, it integrates stochastic\nand deterministic sampling, allowing users to select preferred intermediate\nresults and deterministically refine them. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat GuidPaint achieves clear improvements over existing context-aware\ninpainting methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.",

S3 combines sigmoid for negative inputs with softsign for\npositive inputs, while S4 employs a smooth transition mechanism controlled by a\nsteepness parameter k. We conducted comprehensive experiments across binary\nclassification, multi-class classification, and regression tasks using three\ndifferent neural network architectures.

While multimodal large\nlanguage models (MLLMs) show strong vision-language reasoning abilities, their\neffectiveness in IAD remains limited without domain-specific adaptation. In\nthis work, we propose EMIT, a unified framework that enhances MLLMs for IAD via\ndifficulty-aware group relative policy optimization (GRPO). EMIT constructs a\nmulti-task IAD dataset and utilizes GPT-generated object text descriptions to\ncompensate for missing defective images. For few-shot anomaly detection, it\nintegrates a soft prompt and heatmap-guided contrastive embeddings derived from\npatch-level comparisons. To better handle difficult data samples, i.e., cases\nwhere the MLLM struggles to generate correct answers, we propose a\ndifficulty-aware GRPO that extends the original GRPO by incorporating a\nresponse resampling strategy to ensure the inclusion of correct answers in the\nsampled responses, as well as an advantage reweighting mechanism to strengthen\nlearning from such difficult data samples. Extensive experiments on the MMAD\nbenchmark demonstrate that EMIT significantly enhances the IAD performance of\nMLLMs, achieving an average improvement of 7.77\\% over the base model\n(InternVL3-8B) across seven tasks.",

A key step towards\nits independent verification is the development of NaI(Tl)-based detectors with\nimproved sensitivity at low energies. The majority of NaI(Tl)-based experiments\nrely on conventional photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) as single photon detectors,\nwhich present technological limitations in terms of light collection, intrinsic\nradioactivity and a high noise contribution at keV energies. ASTAROTH is an R&D\nproject developing a NaI(Tl)-based detector where the scintillation light is\nread out by silicon photomultipliers (SiPM) matrices. SiPMs exhibit high photon\ndetection efficiency, negligible radioactivity, and, most importantly, a dark\nnoise nearly two orders of magnitude lower than PMTs, when operated at\ncryogenic temperature. To this end, ASTAROTH features a custom-designed\ncryostat based on a bath of cryogenic fluid, able to safely operate the\ndetector and the read-out electronics down to about 80K. We report the first\nexperimental characterization of 360 g NaI(Tl) detector read out by a large\narea (5 cm x 5 cm) SiPM matrix. The photoelectron yield obtained with a\npreliminary configuration is 7.2 photoelectrons/keV, which is rather promising,\nalso in light of several planned developments. The signal-to-noise ratio and\nthe energy threshold attainable with SiPMs is expected to improve the\nsensitivity for dark matter searches beyond the reach of current-generation\nPMT-based detectors. This result is the first proof of the viability of this\ntechnology and sets a milestone toward the design of future large-scale\nexperiments.",

However, these box annotations require tremendous human\neffort, limiting the scale and diversity of existing tracking datasets. In this\nwork, we present a novel Self-Supervised Tracking framework named\n\\textbf{{\\tracker}}, designed to eliminate the need of box annotations.\nSpecifically, a decoupled spatio-temporal consistency training framework is\nproposed to learn rich target information across timestamps through global\nspatial localization and local temporal association. This allows for the\nsimulation of appearance and motion variations of instances in real-world\nscenarios. Furthermore, an instance contrastive loss is designed to learn\ninstance-level correspondences from a multi-view perspective, offering robust\ninstance supervision without additional labels. This new design paradigm\nenables {\\tracker} to effectively learn generic tracking representations in a\nself-supervised manner, while reducing reliance on extensive box annotations.\nExtensive experiments on nine benchmark datasets demonstrate that {\\tracker}\nsurpasses \\textit{SOTA} self-supervised tracking methods, achieving an\nimprovement of more than 25.3\\%, 20.4\\%, and 14.8\\% in AUC (AO) score on the\nGOT10K, LaSOT, TrackingNet datasets, respectively.

Fluids, vol. 26, 1983, 883) analytical solution for\nthe flow around a small sphere at low particle Reynolds number tells us that\nthe fluid-particle interaction force decomposes into a contribution from the\nlocal flow disturbance caused by the particle's boundary -- consisting of the\ndrag, Faxen, virtual-mass, and history forces -- and another contribution from\nthe stress of the background flow, termed generalized-buoyancy force. There is\nalso a consensus that, for general disperse two-phase flow, the interfacial\nforce density, resulting from averaging the fluid's and particles' equations of\nmotion, decomposes in a likewise manner. However, there has been a\nlong-standing controversy about the physical closure separating the\ngeneralized-buoyancy from the interfacial force density, especially whether or\nnot pseudo-stresses, such as the Reynolds stress, should be attributed to the\nbackground flow. Furthermore, most existing propositions for this closure\ninvolve small-particle approximations. Here, we show that all existing buoyancy\nclosures are mathematically inconsistent with at least one of three simple\nthought experiments designed to determine the roles of pseudo-stresses and\nsmall-particle approximations. We then derive the unique closure consistent\nwith these thought experiments. It fully incorporates all pseudo-stresses,\nrequires no approximation, and is supported by particle-resolved numerical\nsimulations. Remarkably, it exhibits a low-pass filter property, attenuating\nbuoyancy at short wavelengths, that prevents it from causing Hadamard\ninstabilities, constituting a first-principle-based solution to the\nlong-standing ill-posedness problem of two-fluid models. When employing the\nderived closure, even very simplistic two-fluid models are hyperbolic.",

Our results show that vacancies and antisite defects involving\nthe two cations are the dominant point defects in both materials. Our\ncalculated optical excitation and emission peaks associated with the MgGa\ndefect agree well with the experimentally observed blue luminescence peak at\nabout 2.9 eV in MgGa2O4. In MgAl2O4, the intradefect optical transition within\nthe VO-MgAl donor-acceptor defect complex is identified as a likely origin for\nthe observed 2.7 eV emission peak. Furthermore, the calculated radiative\nrecombination coefficients of MgGa and VO-MgAl are significantly higher than\ntheir nonradiative counterparts, supporting their roles as efficient\nluminescent centers. Our results regarding the optical processes of oxygen\nvacancy VO in MgGa2O4 and MgAl2O4 are also in good agreement with experimental\nresults. Based on the calculated defect thermodynamic transition levels, the\nintrinsic persistent luminescence in MgGa2O4 and MgAl2O4 may be attributed to\nelectron traps, GaMg and VO, in the former and a hole trap, MgAl, in the\nlatter.

Among these physiological signals,\nheart rate (HR) plays a central role, as it is widely used in monitoring and\nmanaging cardiovascular conditions and detecting extreme physiological events\nsuch as hypoglycemia. However, data from wearable devices often suffer from\nmissing values. To address this issue, recent studies have employed various\nimputation techniques. Traditionally, the effectiveness of these methods has\nbeen evaluated using predictive accuracy metrics such as RMSE, MAPE, and MAE,\nwhich assess numerical proximity to the original data. While informative, these\nmetrics fail to capture the complex statistical structure inherent in\nphysiological signals. This study bridges this gap by presenting a\ncomprehensive evaluation of four statistical imputation methods, linear\ninterpolation, K Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Piecewise Cubic Hermite Interpolating\nPolynomial (PCHIP), and B splines, for short term HR data gaps. We assess their\nperformance using both predictive accuracy metrics and statistical distance\nmeasures, including the Cohen Distance Test (CDT) and Jensen Shannon Distance\n(JS Distance), applied to HR data from the D1NAMO dataset and the BIG IDEAs Lab\nGlycemic Variability and Wearable Device dataset.

Furthermore we formulate JCESD as a non-convex constellation\nfitting optimization exploiting constellation affine invariance. Few pilots are\nused to achieve coarse estimation for initialization and ambiguity resolution.\nFor high-order modulations, a data augmentation mechanism utilizes the symmetry\nof quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) constellations to increase the\neffective number of samples. To address frequency-selective channels, CE\naccuracy is then enhanced via an iterative refinement strategy that leverages\nimproved SD results. Simulation results demonstrate an average throughput gain\nof 11\\% over widely used pilot-based methods in MU scenarios, highlighting the\nproposed method's potential to improve spectral efficiency.",

Incorporating a graph neural network (GNN) into steganalysis schemes\nenables the leveraging of relational data for improved detection accuracy and\nadaptability. This paper presents the first application of a Graph Neural\nNetwork (GNN), specifically the GraphSAGE architecture, for steganalysis of\ncompressed voice over IP (VoIP) speech streams. The method involves\nstraightforward graph construction from VoIP streams and employs GraphSAGE to\ncapture hierarchical steganalysis information, including both fine grained\ndetails and high level patterns, thereby achieving high detection accuracy.\nExperimental results demonstrate that the developed approach performs well in\nuncovering quantization index modulation (QIM)-based steganographic patterns in\nVoIP signals. It achieves detection accuracy exceeding 98 percent even for\nshort 0.5 second samples, and 95.17 percent accuracy under challenging\nconditions with low embedding rates, representing an improvement of 2.8 percent\nover the best performing state of the art methods. Furthermore, the model\nexhibits superior efficiency, with an average detection time as low as 0.016\nseconds for 0.5-second samples an improvement of 0.003 seconds.

    "abstract": "Embodied intelligence posits that cognitive capabilities fundamentally emerge\nfrom - and are shaped by - an agent's real-time sensorimotor interactions with\nits environment. Such adaptive behavior inherently requires continuous\ninference under uncertainty. Bayesian statistics offers a principled\nprobabilistic framework to address this challenge by representing knowledge as\nprobability distributions and updating beliefs in response to new evidence. The\ncore computational processes underlying embodied intelligence - including\nperception, action selection, learning, and even higher-level cognition - can\nbe effectively understood and modeled as forms of Bayesian inference. Despite\nthe deep conceptual connection between Bayesian statistics and embodied\nintelligence, Bayesian principles have not been widely or explicitly applied in\ntoday's embodied intelligence systems. In this work, we examine both Bayesian\nand contemporary embodied intelligence approaches through two fundamental\nlenses: search and learning - the two central themes in modern AI, as\nhighlighted in Rich Sutton's influential essay \"The Bitter Lesson\". This\nanalysis sheds light on why Bayesian inference has not played a central role in\nthe development of modern embodied intelligence. At the same time, it reveals\nthat current embodied intelligence systems remain largely confined to\nclosed-physical-world environments, and highlights the potential for Bayesian\nmethods to play a key role in extending these systems toward truly open\nphysical-world embodied intelligence.",

To bridge this gap, we create the benchmark (SafeDrive228K)\nand propose a new baseline based on VLM with knowledge graph-based\nretrieval-augmented generation (SafeDriveRAG) for visual question answering\n(VQA).

Direct preference\noptimization (DPO) is a common strategy for correcting hallucinations by\naligning model outputs with human preferences. Existing DPO strategies\ntypically treat hallucination-related preferences as fixed targets, relying on\nstatic supervision signals during training. This approach tends to overfit to\nsuperficial linguistic cues in preference data, leading to distributional\nrigidity and spurious correlations that impair grounding in causally relevant\nvisual information. To overcome this limitation, we propose TARS, a\ntoken-adaptive preference strategy that reformulates DPO as a min-max\noptimization problem. TARS maximizes token-level distributional shifts under\nsemantic constraints to simulate alignment uncertainty, and simultaneously\nminimizes the expected preference loss under these controlled perturbations.\nThis joint objective preserves causal grounding while mitigating overfitting to\npreference patterns, thereby reducing hallucinations in multimodal reasoning.\nWe evaluate TARS on multiple hallucination benchmarks and find consistently\nstrong performance. Using only 4.8k preference samples and no expert feedback,\nTARS reduces hallucination rates from 26.4% to 13.2% and decreases cognition\nvalue from 2.5 to 0.4.

    "abstract": "Portrait animation aims to synthesize talking videos from a static reference\nface, conditioned on audio and style frame cues (e.g., emotion and head poses),\nwhile ensuring precise lip synchronization and faithful reproduction of\nspeaking styles. Existing diffusion-based portrait animation methods primarily\nfocus on lip synchronization or static emotion transformation, often\noverlooking dynamic styles such as head movements. Moreover, most of these\nmethods rely on a dual U-Net architecture, which preserves identity consistency\nbut incurs additional computational overhead. To this end, we propose DiTalker,\na unified DiT-based framework for speaking style-controllable portrait\nanimation. We design a Style-Emotion Encoding Module that employs two separate\nbranches: a style branch extracting identity-specific style information (e.g.,\nhead poses and movements), and an emotion branch extracting identity-agnostic\nemotion features. We further introduce an Audio-Style Fusion Module that\ndecouples audio and speaking styles via two parallel cross-attention layers,\nusing these features to guide the animation process. To enhance the quality of\nresults, we adopt and modify two optimization constraints: one to improve lip\nsynchronization and the other to preserve fine-grained identity and background\ndetails. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of DiTalker in terms\nof lip synchronization and speaking style controllability. Project Page:\nhttps://thenameishope.github.io/DiTalker/",

We consider realistic situations where the physical model, and\nthereby the cost function of the design to be minimized depend on uncertain\nparameters. The probability distribution of the latter is itself known\nimperfectly, through a nominal law, reconstructed from a few observed samples.\nThe distributionally robust optimal design problem is an intricate bilevel\nprogram which consists in minimizing the worst value of a statistical quantity\nof the cost function (typically, its expectation) when the law of the uncertain\nparameters belongs to a certain ``ambiguity set''. We address three classes of\nsuch problems: firstly, this ambiguity set is made of the probability laws\nwhose Wasserstein distance to the nominal law is less than a given threshold;\nsecondly, the ambiguity set is based on the first- and second-order moments of\nthe actual and nominal probability laws. Eventually, a statistical quantity of\nthe cost other than its expectation is made robust with respect to the law of\nthe parameters, namely its conditional value at risk. Using techniques from\nconvex duality, we derive tractable, single-level reformulations of these\nproblems, framed over augmented sets of variables. Our methods are essentially\nagnostic of the optimal design framework; they are described in a unifying\nabstract framework, before being applied to multiple situations in\ndensity-based topology optimization and in geometric shape optimization.\nSeveral numerical examples are discussed in two and three space dimensions to\nappraise the features of the proposed techniques.",

Yet, their increasing size and complexity pose significant challenges\nfor efficient deployment on resource-constrained platforms. Hence, network\npruning has emerged as an effective way of reducing the size and computational\nrequirements of neural networks by removing redundant or unimportant\nparameters. However, a fundamental challenge with pruning consists in optimally\nremoving redundancies without degrading performance. Most existing pruning\ntechniques overlook structural dependencies across feature maps within a layer,\nresulting in suboptimal pruning decisions. In this work, we introduce LinDeps,\na novel post-pruning method, i.e., a pruning method that can be applied on top\nof any pruning technique, which systematically identifies and removes redundant\nfilters via linear dependency analysis. Particularly, LinDeps applies pivoted\nQR decomposition to feature maps to detect and prune linearly dependent\nfilters. Then, a novel signal recovery mechanism adjusts the next layer's\nkernels to preserve compatibility and performance without requiring any\nfine-tuning. Our experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet with VGG and ResNet\nbackbones demonstrate that LinDeps improves compression rates of existing\npruning techniques while preserving performances, leading to a new state of the\nart in CNN pruning. We also benchmark LinDeps in low-resource setups where no\nretraining can be performed, which shows significant pruning improvements and\ninference speedups over a state-of-the-art method. LinDeps therefore\nconstitutes an essential add-on for any current or future pruning technique.",

To\nenable efficient 3DGS, in this paper, we propose LS-Gaussian, an\nalgorithm/hardware co-design framework for lightweight streaming 3D rendering.\nLS-Gaussian is motivated by the core observation that 3DGS suffers from\nsubstantial computation redundancy and stalls. On one hand, in practical\nscenarios, high-frame-rate 3DGS is often applied in settings where a camera\nobserves and renders the same scene continuously but from slightly different\nviewpoints. Therefore, instead of rendering each frame separately, LS-Gaussian\nproposes a viewpoint transformation algorithm that leverages inter-frame\ncontinuity for efficient sparse rendering. On the other hand, as different\ntiles within an image are rendered in parallel but have imbalanced workloads,\nfrequent hardware stalls also slow down the rendering process. LS-Gaussian\npredicts the workload for each tile based on viewpoint transformation to enable\nmore balanced parallel computation and co-designs a customized 3DGS accelerator\nto support the workload-aware mapping in real-time. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that LS-Gaussian achieves 5.41x speedup over the edge GPU baseline\non average and up to 17.3x speedup with the customized accelerator, while\nincurring only minimal visual quality degradation.",

    "abstract": "The ultrathin form factor of metalenses makes them highly appealing for novel\nsensing and imaging applications. Amongst the various phase profiles, the\nhyperbolic metalens stands out for being free from spherical aberrations and\nhaving one of the highest focusing efficiencies to date. For imaging, however,\nhyperbolic metalenses present significant off-axis aberrations, severely\nrestricting the achievable field-of-view (FOV). Extending the FOV of hyperbolic\nmetalenses is thus feasible only if these aberrations can be corrected. Here,\nwe demonstrate that a Restormer neural network can be used to correct these\nsevere off-axis aberrations, enabling wide FOV imaging with a hyperbolic\nmetalens camera. Importantly, we demonstrate the feasibility of training the\nRestormer network purely on simulated datasets of spatially-varying blurred\nimages generated by the eigen-point-spread function (eigenPSF) method,\neliminating the need for time-intensive experimental data collection. This\nreference-free training ensures that Restormer learns solely to correct optical\naberrations, resulting in reconstructions that are faithful to the original\nscene. Using this method, we show that a hyperbolic metalens camera can be used\nto obtain high-quality imaging over a wide FOV of 54{\\deg} in experimentally\ncaptured scenes under diverse lighting conditions.",

    "abstract": "The Upside-Down Rayleigh-Marchenko (UD-RM) method has recently emerged as a\npowerful tool for retrieving subsurface wavefields and images free from\nartifacts caused by both internal and surface-related multiples. Its ability to\nhandle acquisition setups with large cable spacing or sparse node geometries\nmakes it particularly suitable for ocean-bottom seismic data processing.\nHowever, the widespread application of the method is limited by the high\ncomputational cost required to estimate the focusing functions, especially when\ndealing with large imaging domains. To address this limitation, a\nself-supervised learning approach is proposed to accelerate the estimation of\nthe focusing functions. Specifically, a U-Net network is trained on a small\nsubset of image points from within the target area of interest, whose focusing\nfunctions are pre-computed using the conventional iterative scheme. The network\nis tasked to predict both the up- and down-going focusing functions from an\ninitial estimate of the subsurface wavefields. Once trained, the network\ngeneralizes to remaining unseen imaging locations, enabling direct prediction\nof the focusing functions. Validation on a synthetic dataset with both dense\nand sparse receiver sampling using progressively fewer training points\ndemonstrates the method's effectiveness. In both cases, the resulting images\nclosely match those obtained from the UD-RM method with focusing functions\nretrieved by the conventional iterative approach at a much lower cost and\nsignificantly outperform mirror migration (when the same input dataset is\nused). Finally, an application to the Volve field data confirms the method's\nrobustness in practical scenarios. The proposed approach enables seismic\nimaging at a fraction of the computational cost of the conventional UD-RM\napproach while maintaining imaging quality, underscoring its potential for\nlarge-scale seismic applications.",

However, the\ntheoretical prediction for the combined branching ratio\n$\\Gamma_{e^+e^-}\\mathcal{B}_{a_2(1320)\\pi}$ for the pure $\\rho(2D)$ state is\nabout two orders of magnitude smaller than the experimental value. Resolving\nthis discrepancy and deciphering the nature of $Y(2044)$ is a primary objective\nof this work. Based on a systematic study of the mass spectrum and decay\nproperties of $\\rho$ meson states around 2 GeV within the $S$-$D$ mixing\nframework, we reanalyzed the cross section of $e^+e^-\\to a_2(1320)\\pi$, and\nfound that the aforementioned branching ratio discrepancy can be resolved.

This paper addresses these limitations by proposing a modeling\nframework for trajectory planning and decentralized vehicular control at urban\njunctions. The framework employs a bi-level structure where the upper level\ngenerates kinematically feasible reference trajectories using an efficient\ngraph search algorithm with a custom heuristic function, while the lower level\nemploys a predictive controller for trajectory tracking and optimization.\nUnlike existing approaches, our framework does not require central\ncontrollability or knowledge sharing among vehicles. The vehicle kinematics are\nexplicitly incorporated at both levels, and acceleration and steering angle are\nused as control variables. This intuitive formulation facilitates analysis of\ntraffic efficiency, environmental impacts, and motion comfort. The framework's\ndecentralized structure accommodates operational and stochastic elements, such\nas vehicles' detection range, perception uncertainties, and reaction delay,\nmaking the model suitable for safety analysis. Numerical and simulation\nexperiments across diverse scenarios demonstrate the framework's capability in\nmodeling accurate and realistic vehicular maneuvers and interactions at various\nurban junctions, including unsignalized intersections and roundabouts.",

In this work,\nwe explore the influence of urea on local structure of water and dynamics and\nrelate it to urea self-association. We correlate vibrational spectral response\nand orientational dynamics of water with concentration-dependent\nself-association of urea by looking at the interface surface area, hydrogen\nbond strength, and population of relevant donor-acceptor pairs. We compare the\nresponse of four urea force fields (KBFF, OPLS-S, OPLS-AA-D, GAFF-D3) with\nsimple point charge extented water. The KBFF model reproduces experimental IR\nspectra. Both variants of the Duffy model (OPLS-S, OPLS-AA-D) show blue shifts\nwith reasonable broadening and intense concentration-dependent responses, while\nGAFF-D3 shows random peak shifts with prominent broadening. Regarding urea\nself-aggregation, KBFF is mildly repulsive, Duffy models are attractive, and\nGAFF-D3 is neutral with high variability.

    "abstract": "Natural language processing (NLP) techniques have been widely applied in the\nrequirements engineering (RE) field to support tasks such as classification and\nambiguity detection. Although RE research is rooted in empirical investigation,\nit has paid limited attention to replicating NLP for RE (NLP4RE) studies. The\nrapidly advancing realm of NLP is creating new opportunities for efficient,\nmachine-assisted workflows, which can bring new perspectives and results to the\nforefront. Thus, we replicate and extend a previous NLP4RE study (baseline),\n\"Classifying User Requirements from Online Feedback in Small Dataset\nEnvironments using Deep Learning\", which evaluated different deep learning\nmodels for requirement classification from user reviews. We reproduced the\noriginal results using publicly released source code, thereby helping to\nstrengthen the external validity of the baseline study. We then extended the\nsetup by evaluating model performance on an external dataset and comparing\nresults to a GPT-4o zero-shot classifier. Furthermore, we prepared the\nreplication study ID-card for the baseline study, important for evaluating\nreplication readiness. Results showed diverse reproducibility levels across\ndifferent models, with Naive Bayes demonstrating perfect reproducibility. In\ncontrast, BERT and other models showed mixed results. Our findings revealed\nthat baseline deep learning models, BERT and ELMo, exhibited good\ngeneralization capabilities on an external dataset, and GPT-4o showed\nperformance comparable to traditional baseline machine learning models.\nAdditionally, our assessment confirmed the baseline study's replication\nreadiness; however missing environment setup files would have further enhanced\nreadiness. We include this missing information in our replication package and\nprovide the replication study ID-card for our study to further encourage and\nsupport the replication of our study.",

To uncover\nthis structure, latent dynamical variable models such as state-space models,\nrecurrent neural networks, neural ordinary differential equations, and Gaussian\nProcess Latent Variable Models are widely used. We propose a novel hierarchical\nstochastic differential equation (SDE) model that balances computational\nefficiency and interpretability, addressing key limitations of existing\nmethods. Our model assumes the trajectory of a manifold can be reconstructed\nfrom a sparse set of samples from the manifold trajectory. The latent space is\nmodeled using Brownian bridge SDEs, with points - specified in both time and\nvalue - sampled from a multivariate marked point process. These Brownian\nbridges define the drift of a second set of SDEs, which are then mapped to the\nobserved data. This yields a continuous, differentiable latent process capable\nof modeling arbitrarily complex time series as the number of manifold points\nincreases. We derive training and inference procedures and show that the\ncomputational cost of inference scales linearly with the length of the\nobservation data. We then validate our model on both synthetic data and neural\nrecordings to demonstrate that it accurately recovers the underlying manifold\nstructure and scales effectively with data dimensionality.",

    "abstract": "Robust deepfake detection models must be capable of generalizing to\never-evolving manipulation techniques beyond training data. A promising\nstrategy is to augment the training data with online synthesized fake images\ncontaining broadly generalizable artifacts. However, in the context of deepfake\ndetection, it is surprising that jointly training on both original and online\nsynthesized forgeries may result in degraded performance. This contradicts the\ncommon belief that incorporating more source-domain data should enhance\ndetection accuracy. Through empirical analysis, we trace this degradation to\ngradient conflicts during backpropagation which force a trade-off between\nsource domain accuracy and target domain generalization. To overcome this\nissue, we propose a Conflict-Suppressed Deepfake Detection (CS-DFD) framework\nthat explicitly mitigates the gradient conflict via two synergistic modules.\nFirst, an Update Vector Search (UVS) module searches for an alternative update\nvector near the initial gradient vector to reconcile the disparities of the\noriginal and online synthesized forgeries. By further transforming the search\nprocess into an extremum optimization problem, UVS yields the uniquely update\nvector, which maximizes the simultaneous loss reductions for each data type.\nSecond, a Conflict Gradient Reduction (CGR) module enforces a low-conflict\nfeature embedding space through a novel Conflict Descent Loss. This loss\npenalizes misaligned gradient directions and guides the learning of\nrepresentations with aligned, non-conflicting gradients. The synergy of UVS and\nCGR alleviates gradient interference in both parameter optimization and\nrepresentation learning. Experiments on multiple deepfake benchmarks\ndemonstrate that CS-DFD achieves state-of-the-art performance in both in-domain\ndetection accuracy and cross-domain generalization.",

However, most existing works focus on generating\nimages of finished foods based on the given recipes, and face two challenges to\nvisualize the cooking process. First, the appearance of ingredients changes\nvariously across cooking steps, it is difficult to generate the correct\nappearances of foods that match the textual description, leading to semantic\ninconsistency. Second, the current step might depend on the operations of\nprevious step, it is crucial to maintain the contextual coherence of images in\nsequential order. In this work, we present a cooking process visualization\nmodel, called Chain-of-Cooking. Specifically, to generate correct appearances\nof ingredients, we present a Dynamic Patch Selection Module to retrieve\npreviously generated image patches as references, which are most related to\ncurrent textual contents. Furthermore, to enhance the coherence and keep the\nrational order of generated images, we propose a Semantic Evolution Module and\na Bidirectional Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Guidance. To better utilize the\nsemantics of previous texts, the Semantic Evolution Module establishes the\nsemantical association between latent prompts and current cooking step, and\nmerges it with the latent features. Then the CoT Guidance updates the merged\nfeatures to guide the current cooking step remain coherent with the previous\nstep. Moreover, we construct a dataset named CookViz, consisting of\nintermediate image-text pairs for the cooking process. Quantitative and\nqualitative experiments show that our method outperforms existing methods in\ngenerating coherent and semantic consistent cooking process.",

    "abstract": "This work focuses on multi-floor indoor exploration, which remains an open\narea of research. Compared to traditional methods, recent learning-based\nexplorers have demonstrated significant potential due to their robust\nenvironmental learning and modeling capabilities, but most are restricted to 2D\nenvironments. In this paper, we proposed a learning-integrated topological\nexplorer, LITE, for multi-floor indoor environments. LITE decomposes the\nenvironment into a floor-stair topology, enabling seamless integration of\nlearning or non-learning-based 2D exploration methods for 3D exploration. As we\nincrementally build floor-stair topology in exploration using YOLO11-based\ninstance segmentation model, the agent can transition between floors through a\nfinite state machine. Additionally, we implement an attention-based 2D\nexploration policy that utilizes an attention mechanism to capture spatial\ndependencies between different regions, thereby determining the next global\ngoal for more efficient exploration. Extensive comparison and ablation studies\nconducted on the HM3D and MP3D datasets demonstrate that our proposed 2D\nexploration policy significantly outperforms all baseline explorers in terms of\nexploration efficiency. Furthermore, experiments in several 3D multi-floor\nenvironments indicate that our framework is compatible with various 2D\nexploration methods, facilitating effective multi-floor indoor exploration.\nFinally, we validate our method in the real world with a quadruped robot,\nhighlighting its strong generalization capabilities.",

Although\nrecent approaches predict gene expression from histology images, these methods\nrequire large external datasets, which leads to high-cost and suffers from\nsubstantial domain discrepancies that lead to poor generalization on new\nsamples. In this work, we introduce ST-DAI, a single-shot framework for 3D ST\nthat couples a cost-efficient 2.5D sampling scheme with an intra-sample\ndomain-adaptive imputation framework. First, in the cost-efficient 2.5D\nsampling stage, one reference section (central section) is fully sampled while\nother sections (adjacent sections) is sparsely sampled, thereby capturing\nvolumetric context at significantly reduced experimental cost. Second, we\npropose a single-shot 3D imputation learning method that allows us to generate\nfully sampled 3D ST from this cost-efficient 2.5D ST scheme, using only\nsample-specific training. We observe position misalignment and domain\ndiscrepancy between sections. To address those issues, we adopt a pipeline that\nfirst aligns the central section to the adjacent section, thereafter generates\ndense pseudo-supervision on the central section, and then performs Fast\nMulti-Domain Refinement (FMDR), which adapts the network to the domain of the\nadjacent section while fine-tuning only a few parameters through the use of\nParameter-Efficient Domain-Alignment Layers (PDLs). During this refinement, a\nConfidence Score Generator (CSG) reweights the pseudo-labels according to their\nestimated reliability, thereby directing imputation toward trustworthy regions.\nOur experimental results demonstrate that ST-DAI achieves gene expression\nprediction performance comparable to fully sampled approaches while\nsubstantially reducing the measurement burden.",

To extend the benefits of the 1D FRFT to\nhigher-dimensional signals, 2D FRFTs, such as the 2D separable FRFT (SFRFT),\ngyrator transform (GT), and coupled FRFT (CFRFT), have been developed. However,\nexisting 2D FRFTs suffer from several limitations: (1) a lack of theoretical\nuniformity and general applicability, (2) an inability to handle 2D\nnon-stationary signals with nonseparable terms, and (3) failure to maintain a\nconsistent 4D rotational relationship with the 2D Wigner distribution (WD),\nwhich is essential for ensuring geometric consistency and symmetry in\ntime-frequency analysis. These limitations restrict the methods' performance in\npractical applications, such as radar, communication, sonar, and optical\nimaging, in which nonseparable terms frequently arise. To address these\nchallenges, we introduce a more general definition of the 2D FRFT, termed the\n2D nonseparable FRFT (NSFRFT).

The origin of this novel\nscaling, however, has remained unresolved. In this work, we uncover the\nunderlying physical mechanism responsible for this emergent behaviour. Using\nfundamental governing equations aided by scaling arguments, we show that the\nfluid energy cascade is depleted by the polymers at a constant rate across a\nwide range of scales. This constant depletion rate acts as a second invariant,\nalongside the total energy flux, thereby setting the scaling properties of the\nspectrum.

Although traditional polynomial-based planners offer\ncomputational efficiency and smooth trajectory generation, they require expert\nknowledge to tune multiple parameters to adjust this trade-off. Moreover, even\nwith careful tuning, the resulting adjustment may fail to achieve the desired\ntrade-off. Similarly, although reinforcement learning-based planners are\nadaptable in unknown environments, they do not explicitly address the\nsafety-efficiency trade-off. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a\nDecision Transformer-based trajectory planner that leverages a single\nparameter, Return-to-Go (RTG), as a \\emph{temperature parameter} to dynamically\nadjust the safety-efficiency trade-off. In our framework, since RTG intuitively\nmeasures the safety and efficiency of a trajectory, RTG tuning does not require\nexpert knowledge. We validate our approach using Gazebo simulations in both\nstructured grid and unstructured random environments. The experimental results\ndemonstrate that our planner can dynamically adjust the safety-efficiency\ntrade-off by simply tuning the RTG parameter. Furthermore, our planner\noutperforms existing baseline methods across various RTG settings, generating\nsafer trajectories when tuned for safety and more efficient trajectories when\ntuned for efficiency.

Here, we propose a\nfractional topological phase without interaction in $(1+1)$-dimension, which is\ndriven by the Stark localization on top of topological flat bands, different\nfrom the conventional mechanism of the strongly correlated fractional\ntopological phases.

Among\nthese approaches, memory-based algorithms stand out due to their training-free\nnature and ability to leverage historical test data. However, existing\ntest-time adaptation methods are typically designed for a single domain with\nabundant data. In decentralized settings such as federated learning, applying\nthese methods individually to each client suffers from limited test data, while\ndirectly sharing a single global memory via the server prevents proper\npersonalization to each client's unique distribution. To address this, we\npropose Latte, a novel framework where each client maintains a local memory to\nstore embeddings from its own historical test data and an external memory to\nstore class prototypes from other relevant clients. During communication, each\nclient retrieves prototypes from similar clients under the server's\ncoordination to expand its memory. For local adaptation, Latte utilizes both\nembedding similarity and uncertainty to enhance model performance. Our\ntheoretical analysis shows that Latte effectively leverages in-distribution\nclients while remaining robust to out-of-distribution clients. Extensive\nexperiments on domain adaptation and corruption benchmarks validate that Latte\nachieves superior performance in decentralized settings, while introducing only\nnegligible communication and computation costs.

At the heart\nof BANG is \"Generative Exploded Dynamics\", which creates a smooth sequence of\nexploded states for an input geometry, progressively separating parts while\npreserving their geometric and semantic coherence.\n  BANG utilizes a pre-trained large-scale latent diffusion model, fine-tuned\nfor exploded dynamics with a lightweight exploded view adapter, allowing\nprecise control over the decomposition process. It also incorporates a temporal\nattention module to ensure smooth transitions and consistency across time. BANG\nenhances control with spatial prompts, such as bounding boxes and surface\nregions, enabling users to specify which parts to decompose and how. This\ninteraction can be extended with multimodal models like GPT-4, enabling\n2D-to-3D manipulations for more intuitive and creative workflows.\n  The capabilities of BANG extend to generating detailed part-level geometry,\nassociating parts with functional descriptions, and facilitating\ncomponent-aware 3D creation and manufacturing workflows.

We conducted an\nextensive simulation study, varying the effect size, sample size, number of\ncategories and distribution of the control arm probabilities.\n  Results: Our findings indicate that the choice of prior specification can\nintroduce bias in the estimation of the treatment effect, particularly when\ncontrol arm probabilities are right-skewed. The R-square prior specification\nresulted in the smallest bias and increased the likelihood of appropriately\nstopping early when there was a treatment effect. However, this specification\nexhibited larger biases when control arm probabilities were U-shaped when there\nwas an early stopping rule. Dirichlet priors with concentration parameters\nclose to zero resulted in the smallest bias when probabilities were\nright-skewed in the control arm, but were more likely to inappropriately stop\nearly for superiority when there was no treatment effect and an early stopping\nrule.\n  Conclusions: The specification of non-informative priors in Bayesian adaptive\ntrials with ordinal outcomes has implications for treatment effect estimation\nand early stopping decisions.

Existing methods\ntypically utilize all modalities (i.e., voxels, point clouds, multi-view\nimages) and train specific backbones before fusion. However, they still\nstruggle to produce generalized representations due to insufficient 3D training\ndata. Being contrastively pre-trained on web-scale image-text pairs, CLIP\ninherently produces generalized representations for a wide range of downstream\ntasks. Building upon it, we present a simple yet effective framework named\nDescribe, Adapt and Combine (DAC) by taking only multi-view images for open-set\n3DOR. DAC innovatively synergizes a CLIP model with a multi-modal large\nlanguage model (MLLM) to learn generalized 3D representations, where the MLLM\nis used for dual purposes. First, it describes the seen category information to\nalign with CLIP's training objective for adaptation during training. Second, it\nprovides external hints about unknown objects complementary to visual cues\nduring inference. To improve the synergy, we introduce an Additive-Bias\nLow-Rank adaptation (AB-LoRA), which alleviates overfitting and further\nenhances the generalization to unseen categories.

    "abstract": "As humans seek to collaborate with, learn from, and better understand\nartificial intelligence systems, developing AIs that can accurately emulate\nindividual decision-making becomes increasingly important. Chess, a\nlong-standing AI benchmark with precise skill measurement, offers an ideal\ntestbed for human-AI alignment. However, existing approaches to modeling human\nbehavior require prohibitively large amounts of data from each individual,\nmaking them impractical for new or sparsely represented users. In this work, we\nintroduce Maia4All, a framework designed to learn and adapt to individual\ndecision-making styles efficiently, even with limited data. Maia4All achieves\nthis through a two-stage optimization process: (1) an enrichment step, which\nbridges population and individual-level human behavior modeling with a\nprototype-enriched model, and (2) a democratization step, which leverages\nability levels or user prototypes to initialize and refine individual\nembeddings with minimal data. Our experimental results show that Maia4All can\naccurately predict individual moves and profile behavioral patterns with high\nfidelity, establishing a new standard for personalized human-like AI behavior\nmodeling in chess. Maia4All achieves individual human behavior modeling in\nchess with only 20 games, compared to the 5,000 games required previously,\nrepresenting a significant improvement in data efficiency. Our work provides an\nexample of how population AI systems can flexibly adapt to individual users\nusing a prototype-enriched model as a bridge. This approach extends beyond\nchess, as shown in our case study on idiosyncratic LLMs, highlighting its\npotential for broader applications in personalized AI adaptation.",

If there exists a collective strategy that guarantees a correct guess for\nany hat assignment, the game is winnable. Which games $(D,g,h)$ are winnable?\nTwo much-studied parameters: $\\mu(D)$ is the maximum integer $k$ such that\n$(D,1,k)$ is winnable, and $\\hat{\\mu}(D)$ is the supremum of $h/g$ for integer\n$h, g$ such that $(D,g,h)$ is winnable.\n  Chapter 0 is a casual, riddle-based introduction. Chapter 1 taxonomizes the\ngames, surveys all previous work, and summarizes the piece. Chapter 2 proves\nlemmata and easy cases. Chapter 3 uses \"hats as hints\" and \"admissible paths\"\nfor games on cycles. Chapter 4 generalizes several \"constructors\" and applies\nthem to tree games. Chapter 5 uses \"combinatorial prisms\" for a new angle on\nthe well-studied $K_{n,m}$ games. In chapter 6, we apply \"dependency digraphs\"\nto the continuous limit of this game. Chapter 7 collects open problems and\nminor results.\n  We show:\n  $(C_{k\\geq 4},1,h)$ is winnable if and only if: $h=3$ and $k$ is divisible by\n$3$ or equal to $4$, $h\\leq 4$ and the $h(v)$ sequence $(3,2,3)$ or $(2,3,3)$\nappears in the cycle, or the $h(v)$ sequence $(2,...,2)$ appears with no\nintervening value $>4$.\n  $(T, 1, h)$ is winnable for tree $T$ iff $T$ has a subtree $T'$ with\n$h(v)\\leq 2^{deg_{T'}(v)}$ for all $v\\in V(T')$.\n  For a digraph $D$, $\\hat{\\mu}(D)\\leq e(\\Delta^-+1)$. For a graph $G$,\n$\\hat{\\mu}(G)\\leq (\\Delta-1)^{1-\\Delta} \\Delta^{\\Delta}<e\\Delta$.\n  $(\\overrightarrow{C}_k, g, h)$ is unwinnable if $g(v_i)/h(v_i) +\ng(v_{i+1})/h(v_{i+1}) < 1$ for some $i$.\n  And much else.

The recent emergence of\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) is promising in automating the HLS debugging\nprocess.

Using the Raystation treatment planning system, robustly-optimised\ndPBT and stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) treatment plans were created\nwith a 5 mm margin allowing for intra- and inter-fraction anatomical changes.\nfollowing clinically-adopted protocols. Safe dose-escalation feasibility is\nassessed with dose metrics, tumour control (TCP) and normal tissue complication\nprobabilities (NTCP) for average and worst-case intra-fraction motion\nscenarios. Significance testing was performed using a paired student's t-test.\nResults: Dose-escalation feasibility is largely dependent on tumour size and\nproximity to critical structures. Minimal therapeutic benefit was observed for\npatients with greater than 4.5 cm tumours, however for tumours less than or\nequal to 4.5 cm dPBT TCPs of 45-90% compared to SABR TCPs of 10-40% (p<0.05).\nThe worst-case scenario dPBT TCP was comparable to SABR. Hypofractioned dPBT\nfurther improved this result to greater than 90% (p<0.05) for tumours less than\nor equal to 4.5 cm. Conclusion: Safe dPBT is feasible for patients with targets\nup to the median size and see a significant therapeutic benefit compared to the\ncurrent standard of care in SABR.

We\nevaluate the ENN architecture on three canonical benchmarks: MNIST digit\nclassification, CIFAR-10 image sequence modeling, and WikiText-103 language\nmodeling. Our empirical results demonstrate that the ENN achieves accuracy and\ngeneralization performance broadly comparable to classical RNN, GRU, and LSTM\narchitectures, with all models converging to similar accuracy and perplexity on\nthe large-scale WikiText-103 task. At the same time, the ENN offers significant\nenhancements in interpretability through observable memory dynamics. Hebbian\ntrace visualizations further reveal biologically plausible, structured memory\nformation processes, validating the potential of neuroscience-inspired\nmechanisms to inform the development of more interpretable and robust deep\nlearning models.",

To address this, we propose\nan uncertainty-aware radio map (URAM) reconstruction framework that explicitly\nleverages graph-based reasoning tailored for waypoint navigation. Our approach\nintegrates two key deep learning components: (1) a Bayesian neural network that\nestimates spatial uncertainty in real time, and (2) an attention-based\nreinforcement learning policy that performs global reasoning over a\nprobabilistic roadmap, using uncertainty estimates to plan informative and\nenergy-efficient trajectories. This graph-based reasoning enables intelligent,\nnon-myopic trajectory planning, guiding agents toward the most informative\nregions while satisfying safety constraints. Experimental results show that\nURAM improves reconstruction accuracy by up to 34% over existing baselines.",

    "abstract": "Background: The proportional odds (PO) model is the most common analytic\nmethod for ordinal outcomes in randomised controlled trials. While parameter\nestimates obtained under departures from PO can be interpreted as an average\nodds ratio, they can obscure differing treatment effects across the\ndistribution of the ordinal categories. Extensions to the PO model exist and\nthis work evaluates their performance under deviations to the PO assumption.\n  Methods: We evaluated the bias, coverage and mean square error of four\nmodeling approaches for ordinal outcomes via Monte Carlo simulation.\nSpecifically, independent logistic regression models, the PO model, and\nconstrained and unconstrained partial proportional odds (PPO) models were fit\nto simulated ordinal outcome data. The simulated data were designed to\nrepresent a hypothetical two-arm randomised trial under a range of scenarios.\nAdditionally, we report on a case study; an Australasian COVID-19 Trial that\nadopted multiple secondary ordinal endpoints.\n  Results: The PO model performed best when the data are generated under PO, as\nexpected, but can result in bias and poor coverage in the presence of non-PO,\nparticularly with increasing effect size and number of categories. The odds\nratios (ORs) estimated using the unconstrained PPO and separate logistic\nregression models in the presence of non-PO had negligible bias and good\ncoverage across most scenarios. The unconstrained PPO model under-performed\nwhen there was sparse data within some categories.\n  Conclusions: While the PO model is effective when PO holds, the unconstrained\nand constrained PPO and logistic regression models provide unbiased and\nefficient estimates under non-PO conditions.",

We\nspecifically address the case with non-convex constitutive stress relations and\nnon-degenerate Lax's shock. Under the assumptions of suitably small initial\nperturbations satisfying a zero-mass type condition, we prove that the solution\nof the system converges to a viscous shock profile with a shift, which is\npartially determined by the space-periodic perturbation.

To address the challenges posed by high\ndimensionality and nuisance parameters, we develop a conditional likelihood\nestimator that isolates and consistently estimates the reciprocity effects.

We then conducted an\ninterview study with 12 BLV participants comparing whether using our tactile\ntemplates improves mental models and understanding of charts and whether this\nunderstanding translates to novel datasets experienced through alt texts.\nThematic analysis shows that tactile models support chart type understanding\nand are the preferred learning method by BLV individuals. We also report\nparticipants' opinions on tactile chart design and their role in BLV education.",

    "abstract": "High-quality 4D light field representation with efficient angular feature\nmodeling is crucial for scene perception, as it can provide discriminative\nspatial-angular cues to identify moving targets. However, recent developments\nstill struggle to deliver reliable angular modeling in the temporal domain,\nparticularly in complex low-light scenes. In this paper, we propose a novel\nlight field epipolar-plane structure image (ESI) representation that explicitly\ndefines the geometric structure within the light field. By capitalizing on the\nabrupt changes in the angles of light rays within the epipolar plane, this\nrepresentation can enhance visual expression in low-light scenes and reduce\nredundancy in high-dimensional light fields. We further propose an\nangular-temporal interaction network (ATINet) for light field object tracking\nthat learns angular-aware representations from the geometric structural cues\nand angular-temporal interaction cues of light fields. Furthermore, ATINet can\nalso be optimized in a self-supervised manner to enhance the geometric feature\ninteraction across the temporal domain. Finally, we introduce a large-scale\nlight field low-light dataset for object tracking. Extensive experimentation\ndemonstrates that ATINet achieves state-of-the-art performance in single object\ntracking. Furthermore, we extend the proposed method to multiple object\ntracking, which also shows the effectiveness of high-quality light field\nangular-temporal modeling.",

An\noff-diagonal component of the octupolar tensor also exhibits unconventional\ndecay above the magnetic ordering temperature, roughly depending on the inverse\ntemperature to the third power. In the forced ferromagnetic phase, on the other\nhand, magneto-linear dependence dominantly appears and notably persists up to\nvery high fields.

While most\nof existing works upon dataset distillation focus on supervised datasets, we\ninstead aim to distill images and their self-supervisedly trained\nrepresentations into a distilled set.

Integrating the ability\nof large language models (LLMs) with task-oriented semantic communication is a\npotential approach.

Such tasks require organizing historical visual observations for\nlinguistic grounding, which is critical for long-sequence navigational\ndecisions. However, current agents suffer from overly detailed scene\nrepresentation and ambiguous vision-language alignment, which weaken their\ncomprehension of navigation-friendly high-level scene priors and easily lead to\nbehaviors that violate linguistic commands. To tackle these issues, we propose\na navigation policy by recursively summarizing along-the-way visual\nperceptions, which are adaptively aligned with commands to enhance linguistic\ngrounding. In particular, by structurally modeling historical trajectories as\ncompact neural grids, several Recursive Visual Imagination (RVI) techniques are\nproposed to motivate agents to focus on the regularity of visual transitions\nand semantic scene layouts, instead of dealing with misleading geometric\ndetails. Then, an Adaptive Linguistic Grounding (ALG) technique is proposed to\nalign the learned situational memories with different linguistic components\npurposefully. Such fine-grained semantic matching facilitates the accurate\nanticipation of navigation actions and progress. Our navigation policy\noutperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the challenging VLN-CE and\nObjectNav tasks, showing the superiority of our RVI and ALG techniques for VLN.",

In\ngeneral, current approaches, which rely on intra-image pixel-wise consistency\ntraining via pseudo-labeling, overlook the consistency at more comprehensive\nsemantic levels (e.g., object region) and suffer from severe discrepancy of\nextracted features resulting from an imbalanced number of labeled and unlabeled\ndata.

A dynamic attention-based gating mechanism coordinates the two\nstreams, deciding at each step how to blend structured and unstructured\nknowledge. Due to GPU constraints, we simulate the dual-decoder behavior using\nprompt-based mode control to approximate coordinated decoding in a\nsingle-stream mode.

We demonstrate Evo-DKD's effectiveness on\nuse cases including healthcare ontology refinement, semantic search\nimprovement, and cultural heritage timeline modeling.

    "abstract": "Background: Symptom rating scales in psychiatry are limited by reliance on\nself-report, and lack of predictive power. Actigraphy, a passive wearable-based\nmethod for measuring sleep and physical activity, offers objective,\nhigh-resolution behavioral data that may better reflect symptom fluctuations,\nbut most studies have focused on narrow diagnostic groups or fixed time\nwindows, limiting clinical translation. Objective: To examine whether\nactigraphy-derived sleep and activity features correlate with psychiatric\nsymptom severity in a transdiagnostic psychiatric sample, and to identify which\nfeatures are most clinically relevant across multiple temporal resolutions.\nMethods: We present a feasibility case series study with preliminary data from\neight outpatients enrolled in the DeeP-DD study, a transdiagnostic study of\ndigital phenotyping. Participants wore GENEActiv actigraphy devices and symptom\nseverity was measured using a variety of validated scales. We performed\nintra-individual Spearman correlations and inter-individual repeated measures\ncorrelations across daily, weekly, monthly, and full-duration averages.\nResults: Intra-individual analyses revealed that later rise times were\nsignificantly associated with higher weekly PHQ-9 scores in participant #7\n(\\r{ho} = 0.74, P=.0003) and participant #4 (\\r{ho} = 0.78, P=.022), as well as\nhigher weekly GAD-7 scores in participant #7 (\\r{ho} = 0.59, P=.026).\nInter-individual analyses showed that weeks with later average rise time\ncorrelated with higher PHQ-9 (r = 0.48, P=.0003) and GAD-7 scores (r = 0.38,\nP=.032). Increased light physical activity was linked to lower PHQ-9 scores\nweekly (r = -0.44, P=.001) and monthly (r = -0.53, P=.014). Conclusion:\nConsistent associations between actigraphy features and symptoms across\ntemporal scales and diagnostic groups underscore their potential utility for\nscalable, real-world clinical monitoring.",

While powerful Stein-based\ndiagnostics can detect distributional mismatches, they provide no direct\nassessment of dependence structure, often the primary inferential target in\nmultivariate problems. We introduce the Copula Discrepancy (CD), a principled\nand computationally efficient diagnostic that leverages Sklar's theorem to\nisolate and quantify the fidelity of a sample's dependence structure\nindependent of its marginals. Our theoretical framework provides the first\nstructure-aware diagnostic specifically designed for the era of approximate\ninference.

Furthermore, our robust MLE-based variant can detect\nsubtle but critical mismatches in tail dependence that remain invisible to rank\ncorrelation-based approaches, distinguishing between samples with identical\nKendall's tau but fundamentally different extreme-event behavior. With\ncomputational overhead orders of magnitude lower than existing Stein\ndiscrepancies, the CD provides both immediate practical value for MCMC\npractitioners and a theoretical foundation for the next generation of\nstructure-aware sample quality assessment.",

Instead of predicting a single deterministic output from learned queries,\nMapDiffusion iteratively refines randomly initialized queries, conditioned on a\nBEV latent grid, to generate multiple plausible map samples. This allows\naggregating samples to improve prediction accuracy and deriving uncertainty\nestimates that directly correlate with scene ambiguity. Extensive experiments\non the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that MapDiffusion achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance in online map construction, surpassing the baseline by 5% in\nsingle-sample performance. We further show that aggregating multiple samples\nconsistently improves performance along the ROC curve, validating the benefit\nof distribution modeling. Additionally, our uncertainty estimates are\nsignificantly higher in occluded areas, reinforcing their value in identifying\nregions with ambiguous sensor input. By modeling the full map distribution,\nMapDiffusion enhances the robustness and reliability of online vectorized HD\nmap construction, enabling uncertainty-aware decision-making for autonomous\nvehicles in complex environments.",

In this work, we propose\na torque-driven hierarchical rewiring strategy, inspired by the notion of\ntorque in classical mechanics, dynamically modulating message passing to\nimprove representation learning in heterophilous graphs and enhance robustness\nagainst noisy graphs. Specifically, we define an interference-aware torque\nmetric that integrates structural distance and energy scores to quantify the\nperturbation induced by edges, thereby encouraging each node to aggregate\ninformation from its nearest low-energy neighbors. We use the metric to\nhierarchically reconfigure the receptive field of each layer by judiciously\npruning high-torque edges and adding low-torque links, suppressing propagation\nnoise and boosting pertinent signals. Extensive evaluations on benchmark\ndatasets show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods on both\nheterophilous and homophilous graphs, and maintains high accuracy on noisy\ngraph.",

Due to any of these three effects, galaxies of a given\nluminosity in JWST may be interpreted as having a larger stellar mass than they\nactually do. Our results are obtained using the Pegase stellar population code,\nand are presented as the ratio of the modified star formation efficiency\nrelative to the fiducial one (which uses a Salpeter IMF and constant star\nformation rate). As an example, if the high-mass end of the IMF goes as\n$M^{-1.35}$, the star formation efficiency and inferred stellar galactic mass\ncould be lower by a factor of $\\sim 10$ than in the fiducial case. Our\nexamination (keeping the star formation rate constant) of a top-heavy IMF with\nslope $\\alpha$ leads to a simple relation that is a good approximation to the\nnumerical results, $\\epsilon(\\alpha) \\approx \\epsilon_{\\rm fid}e^{2.66(\\alpha\n-2.35)}$.

Lett.\n134, 123601 (2025) for the spectral density of a quantized cavity with a single\ndipole, exhibits a dissipative classical-quantum correspondence for bosonic\nHopfield model systems, and reveals important departures from previous\nheuristic assumptions about system-bath coupling. We identify a new criterion\nfor what we term the \"broadband\" dissipative regime of cavity-QED, where\nphenomenological models require corrections in accordance with the intrinsic\nand spatially-dependent complex phase of the QNM, and also shed light on\nfundamental limits to single-mode models in extreme coupling regimes. Using\nplasmonic and dielectric cavity examples, we show validity ranges of our QNM\nmaster equation and spectral USC calculations, and discuss prospects for\nnear-term experimental observation of broadband dissipative effects.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous agents based on large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated\nimpressive capabilities in a wide range of applications, including web\nnavigation, software development, and embodied control. While most LLMs are\nlimited in several key agentic procedures, such as reliable planning, long-term\nmemory, tool management, and multi-agent coordination, graphs can serve as a\npowerful auxiliary structure to enhance structure, continuity, and coordination\nin complex agent workflows. Given the rapid growth and fragmentation of\nresearch on Graph-augmented LLM Agents (GLA), this paper offers a timely and\ncomprehensive overview of recent advances and also highlights key directions\nfor future work. Specifically, we categorize existing GLA methods by their\nprimary functions in LLM agent systems, including planning, memory, and tool\nusage, and then analyze how graphs and graph learning algorithms contribute to\neach. For multi-agent systems, we further discuss how GLA solutions facilitate\nthe orchestration, efficiency optimization, and trustworthiness of MAS.\nFinally, we highlight key future directions to advance this field, from\nimproving structural adaptability to enabling unified, scalable, and multimodal\nGLA systems. We hope this paper can serve as a roadmap for future research on\nGLA and foster a deeper understanding of the role of graphs in LLM agent\nsystems.",

We find extensive data leakage\nand molecular redundancy across its splits, including 2D-identical ligands\nwithin and across partitions, pervasive analog overlap, and low-diversity query\nsets. In ALDH1 alone, for instance, 323 active training -- validation analog\npairs occur at ECFP4 Tanimoto similarity $\\geq 0.6$; across all targets, 2,491\n2D-identical inactives appear in both training and validation, with very few\ncorresponding actives. These overlaps allow models to succeed through scaffold\nmemorization rather than generalization, inflating enrichment factors and AUROC\nscores. These flaws are not incidental -- they are so severe that a trivial\nmemorization-based baseline with no learnable parameters can exploit them to\nmatch or exceed the reported performance of state-of-the-art deep learning and\n3D-similarity models.

While recurrent neural networks (RNNs),\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs), and Transformers have advanced in\ncapturing long-range dependencies, they struggle with achieving high accuracy\nwith very long sequences due to limited memory retention (fixed context\nwindow). State-Space Models (SSMs) leverage exponentially decaying memory\nenabling lengthy context window and so they process very long data sequences\nmore efficiently than recurrent and Transformer-based models. Unlike\ntraditional neural models like CNNs and RNNs, SSM-based models require solving\ndifferential equations through continuous integration, making training and\ninference both compute- and memory-intensive on conventional CPUs and GPUs. In\nthis paper we introduce a specialized hardware accelerator, EpochCore, for\naccelerating SSMs. EpochCore is based on systolic arrays (SAs) and is designed\nto enhance the energy efficiency and throughput of inference of SSM-based\nmodels for long-range sequence tasks. Within the SA, we propose a versatile\nprocessing element (PE) called LIMA-PE to perform traditional and specialized\nMAC operations to support traditional DNNs and SSMs. To complement the\nEpochCore microarchitecture, we propose a novel dataflow, ProDF, which enables\nhighly efficient execution of SSM-based models.
