    "abstract": "We introduce a new low-power 13-mg microactuator driven by shape-memory alloy\n(SMA) wires for underwater operation. The development of this device was\nmotivated by the recent creation of microswimmers such as the FRISHBot,\nWaterStrider, VLEIBot, VLEIBot+, and VLEIBot++. The first four of these robots,\nranging from 30 to 90 mg, function tethered to an electrical power supply while\nthe last platform is an 810-mg fully autonomous system. These five robots are\ndriven by dry SMA-based microactuators first developed for microrobotic\ncrawlers such as the SMALLBug and SMARTI. As shown in this abstract, dry\nSMA-based actuators do not operate efficiently under water due to high\nheat-transfer rates in this medium; for example, the actuators that drive the\nVLEIBot++ require about 40 mW of average power at 1 Hz in dry air while\nrequiring about 900 mW of average power at 1 Hz in water. In contrast, the\nmicroactuator presented in this abstract consumes about 150 mW of average power\nat 1 Hz in both dry air and water; additionally, it can be excited directly\nusing an onboard battery through simple power electronics implemented on a\ncustom-built printed circuit board (PCB). This technological breakthrough was\nenabled by the integration of a soft structure that encapsulates the SMA wires\nthat drive the actuator in order to passively control the rates of heat\ntransfer. The results presented here represent preliminary, yet compelling,\nexperimental evidence that the proposed actuation approach will enable the\ndevelopment of fully autonomous and controllable submersible microswimmers. To\naccomplish this objective, we will evolve the current version of the VLEIBot++\nand introduce new bioinspired underwater propulsion mechanisms.",

    ],
    "abstract": "False Data Injection (FDI) attacks pose significant threats by manipulating\nmeasurement data, leading to incorrect state estimation. Although numerous\nstudies have focused on designing DC FDI attacks, few have addressed AC FDI\nattacks due to the complexity of incorporating non-linear AC power flows in the\ndesign process. Additionally, designing a sparse AC FDI attack presents another\nchallenge because it involves solving a mixed-integer nonlinear programming\nproblem with nonconvex constraints, which is inherently difficult. This paper\nexplores the design and implementation of a sparse AC FDI attack, where the\nattacker strategically selects a minimal set of measurements to manipulate\nwhile maintaining the nonlinearity and interdependence of AC power flow\nequations. The objective is to minimize the number of altered measurements,\nthereby reducing the attack's detectability while achieving the desired state\nestimation error. The problem is formulated as a Mixed Integer Nonlinear\nProgramming (MINLP) problem. Binary variables indicate the selection of\nmeasurements to be manipulated, and continuous variables represent the\nmeasurement values. An optimization problem is designed to minimize the number\nof binary variables, translating into a sparse attack, while ensuring the\nattack remains efficient and hard to detect. The big-M method and conditional\nconstraints are utilized to handle the fixed and variable measurement\nparameters effectively. Simulation results on the standard IEEE 57-bus test\nsystem demonstrate the efficacy of the sparse AC FDI attack in terms of its\nimpact on state estimation and the minimal number of measurements required for\nsuccessful implementation.",

However, standard temporal\nschemes, such as classical Runge-Kutta (RK) methods, do not enforce these\nconstraints, leading to a loss of accuracy and stability. Projection is an\nefficient way to address this shortcoming by correcting the RK solution at the\nend of each time step. Here we introduce a novel projection method for explicit\nRK schemes, called a \\textit{quasi-orthogonal} projection method. This method\ncan be employed for systems containing a single (not necessarily convex)\ninvariant functional, for dissipative systems, and for the systems containing\nmultiple invariants. It works by projecting the orthogonal search direction(s)\ninto the solution space spanned by the RK stage derivatives. With this approach\nlinear invariants of the problem are preserved, the time step size remains\nfixed, additional computational cost is minimal, and these optimal search\ndirection(s) preserve the order of accuracy of the base RK method. This\npresents significant advantages over existing projection methods. Numerical\nresults demonstrate that these properties are observed in practice for a range\nof applications.",

It aims to solve the\nlong-standing problem of securing the power grid against stealthy attacks. The\nkey idea behind MTD is to introduce periodic/event-triggered controlled changes\nto the power grid's SCADA network/physical plant, thereby invalidating the\nknowledge attackers use for crafting stealthy attacks. In this paper, we\nprovide a comprehensive overview of this topic and classify the different ways\nin which MTD is implemented in power grids.

    "abstract": "Semi-supervised learning (SSL) commonly exhibits confirmation bias, where\nmodels disproportionately favor certain classes, leading to errors in predicted\npseudo labels that accumulate under a self-training paradigm. Unlike supervised\nsettings, which benefit from a rich, static data distribution, SSL inherently\nlacks mechanisms to correct this self-reinforced bias, necessitating debiased\ninterventions at each training step. Although the generation of debiased pseudo\nlabels has been extensively studied, their effective utilization remains\nunderexplored. Our analysis indicates that data from biased classes should have\na reduced influence on parameter updates, while more attention should be given\nto underrepresented classes. To address these challenges, we introduce TaMatch,\na unified framework for debiased training in SSL. TaMatch employs a scaling\nratio derived from both a prior target distribution and the model's learning\nstatus to estimate and correct bias at each training step. This ratio adjusts\nthe raw predictions on unlabeled data to produce debiased pseudo labels. In the\nutilization phase, these labels are differently weighted according to their\npredicted class, enhancing training equity and minimizing class bias.\nAdditionally, TaMatch dynamically adjust the target distribution in response to\nthe model's learning progress, facilitating robust handling of practical\nscenarios where the prior distribution is unknown. Empirical evaluations show\nthat TaMatch significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across\na range of challenging image classification tasks, highlighting the critical\nimportance of both the debiased generation and utilization of pseudo labels in\nSSL.",

Macroscopic properties of polymers are\ninfluenced by chain mobility in the melt and manipulating D can significantly\nimpact these properties. n this work, we present a detailed study of the static\nand dynamic behavior of fully flexible polymer chains that follow Schulz Zimm\nmolecular weight distribution of up to dispersity two using molecular dynamics\nsimulation. Static analysis shows that global conformation of test chains that\nare equal to the average molecular weight remain ideal. At small length scales,\nwe observe systematic deviation from Gaussian statistics as D increases, given\nby the structure factor plots, indicating an increased stiffness of chains in\ndisperse melts due to contributions from longer chains. We find that the\naverage entanglement time of chains decreases with dispersity, however, this is\nonly seen in systems with high D and MW, for systems with low MW and D, there\nis no change in the entanglement time. The mobility of entangled chains is\nconsiderably enhanced due to the interplay of different dynamic mechanisms,\nresulting in accelerated reptation as dispersity increases. Short chains offer\nconstraint release to the longer chains, contributing to faster dynamics and\nearly onset of disentanglement. We capture this relaxation mechanism by the\ncoherent dynamic structure factor for entangled probe chains in the melt, which\ncorresponds to the weakening of tube confinement. These findings provide\ninsights into the rich dynamic heterogeneities of highly disperse polymer\nmelts.",

Deep-ER performance was\ncompared to conventional iterative Total Generalized Variation reconstruction\nusing image and spectral quality metrics.\n  Results: Deep-ER demonstrated 600-fold faster reconstruction than\nconventional methods, providing improved spatial-spectral quality and\nmetabolite quantification with 12%-45% (P<0.05) higher signal-to-noise and\n8%-50% (P<0.05) smaller Cramer-Rao lower bounds. Metabolic images clearly\nvisualize glioma tumor heterogeneity and boundary.\n  Conclusion: Deep-ER provides efficient and robust reconstruction for\nsparse-sampled MRSI. The accelerated acquisition-reconstruction MRSI is\ncompatible with high-throughput imaging workflow. It is expected that such\nimproved performance will facilitate basic and clinical MRSI applications.",

In this paper, our goal is to verify the\nfeasibility and effectiveness of using a causality-based approach for fMRI\nfingerprinting. Specifically, we propose an innovative method that utilizes the\ncausal dynamics activities of the brain to identify the unique cognitive\npatterns of individuals (e.g., subject fingerprint) and fMRI tasks (e.g., task\nfingerprint). The key novelty of our approach stems from the development of a\ntwo-timescale linear state-space model to extract 'spatio-temporal' (aka\ncausal) signatures from an individual's fMRI time series data. To the best of\nour knowledge, we pioneer and subsequently quantify, in this paper, the concept\nof 'causal fingerprint.' Our method is well-separated from other fingerprint\nstudies as we quantify fingerprints from a cause-and-effect perspective, which\nare then incorporated with a modal decomposition and projection method to\nperform subject identification and a GNN-based (Graph Neural Network) model to\nperform task identification. Finally, we show that the experimental results and\ncomparisons with non-causality-based methods demonstrate the effectiveness of\nthe proposed methods.

    "abstract": "The bipartite matching problem is widely applied in the field of\ntransportation; e.g., to find optimal matches between supply and demand over\ntime and space. Recent efforts have been made on developing analytical formulas\nto estimate the expected matching distance in bipartite matching with randomly\ndistributed vertices in two- or higher-dimensional spaces, but no accurate\nformulas currently exist for one-dimensional problems. This paper presents a\nset of closed-form formulas, without curve-fitting, that can provide accurate\naverage distance estimates for one-dimensional random bipartite matching\nproblems (RBMP). We first focus on a lattice case and propose a new method that\nrelates the corresponding matching distance to the area size between a random\nwalk path and the x-axis. This result directly leads to a straightforward\nclosed-form formula for balanced RBMPs. For unbalanced RBMPs on a lattice, we\nfirst analyze the properties of an unbalanced random walk that can be related\nto balanced RBPMs after optimally removing a subset of unmatched points, and\nthen derive a set of approximate formulas. Additionally, we build upon an\noptimal point removal strategy to derive a set of recursive formulas that can\nprovide more accurate estimates. Then, we extend the results to three problem\nvariants, including RBMPs with periodic boundaries, uniformly distributed\npoints, and arbitrary-length line. Last, we shift our focus to regular\nnetworks, and use the one-dimensional results as building blocks to derive RBMP\nformulas. To verify the accuracy of the proposed formulas, a set of Monte-Carlo\nsimulations are generated for a variety of matching problems settings.

The algorithm finds the most probable\noffset in track length for a track-like object by comparing the measured\nionization density as a function of position with a theoretical prediction of\nthe energy loss as a function of the energy, including models of electron\nrecombination and detector response. The algorithm can be used to measure the\nenergies of particles that interact before they stop, such as charged pions\nthat are absorbed by argon nuclei. The algorithm's energy measurement\nresolutions and fractional biases are presented as functions of particle\nkinetic energy and number of track hits using samples of stopping secondary\ncharged pions in data collected by the ProtoDUNE-SP detector, and also in a\ndetailed simulation. Additional studies describe the impact of the dE/dx model\non energy measurement performance. The method described in this paper to\ncharacterize the energy measurement performance can be repeated in any LArTPC\nexperiment using stopping secondary charged pions.",

Materials were ranked as\npotential optical emitters, leading to the identification of transition-metal\nnitrogen halides (ZrNCl, TiNBr, TiNCl) and bismuth chalcohalides (BiTeCl) with\noptical coupling comparable to or exceeding MoS$_2$. Despite strong in-plane\ndipole transitions, most two-dimensional materials underperform bulk\nsemiconductors due to the absence of out-of-plane components. To elucidate\ninterband transitions, we introduced the orbital overlap tensor and established\na correlation between anomalous Born effective charges and optical coupling,\nlinking charge redistribution to transition strength. We also identified\nchalcogen-mediated $d$-$d$ transition as a key mechanism enabling optical\nresponses in transition-metal dichalcogenides. We derived an analytical\nradiative recombination model incorporating multi-valley effects and found that\nexcitonic corrections are essential for accurate lifetime predictions. Some\ndirect-gap materials exhibit dark excitons as their lowest-energy states,\nclassifying them as quasi-direct band gap semiconductors, which is critical for\ntuning excitonic recombination dynamics.",

Currently, a gap separates network manipulation from\nnetwork visualization in programming environments. Users often export network\ndata to be laid out in external interactive software, like Cytoscape and Gephi.\nWe argue the current R package ecosystem lacks an interactive layout engine\nwell integrated with common data analysis workflows.\n  Results\n  We present easylayout, an R package that bridges network manipulation and\nvisualization by leveraging interactive force simulations within the IDE itself\n(e.g., RStudio, VSCode). It is not yet another visualization library, but\ninstead aims to interconnect existing libraries and streamline their usage into\nthe R ecosystem. easylayout takes an igraph object and serializes it into a web\napplication integrated with the IDE's interface through a Shiny server. The app\nlays out the network by simulating attraction and repulsion forces. Simulation\nparameters can be adjusted in real-time. An editing mode allows moving and\nrotating nodes. The implementation aims for performance, so that even lower-end\ndevices are able to work with relatively large networks. Once the user finishes\ntweaking the layout, it is sent back to the R session to be plotted through\npopular libraries like ggraph, igraph or even the base package itself. The\ncurrent implementation focuses on the R ecosystem, but using web technologies\nmakes it easily portable to similar environments, like Python/Jupyter\nNotebooks. We expect this tool to reduce the time spent searching for suitable\nnetwork layouts, ultimately allowing researchers to generate more compelling\nfigures.\n  Availability and implementation\n  easylayout is freely available under an MIT license on GitHub\n(https://github.com/dalmolingroup/easylayout).

    "abstract": "Over the last decade, next-generation neural mass models have become\nincreasingly prominent in mathematical neuroscience. These models link\nmicroscopic dynamics with low-dimensional systems of so-called firing rate\nequations that exactly capture the collective dynamics of large populations of\nheterogeneous quadratic integrate-and-fire (QIF) neurons. A particularly\ntractable type of heterogeneity is the distribution of the QIF neurons'\nexcitability parameters, or inputs, according to a Lorentzian. While other\ndistributions -- such as those approximating Gaussian or uniform distributions\n-- admit to exact mean-field reductions, they result in more complex firing\nrate equations that are challenging to analyze, and it remains unclear whether\nthey produce comparable collective dynamics. Here, we first demonstrate why\nLorentzian heterogeneity is analytically favorable and, second, identify when\nit leads to qualitatively different collective dynamics compared to other types\nof heterogeneity. A stationary mean-field approach enables us to derive\nexplicit expressions for the distributions of the neurons' firing rates and\nvoltages in macroscopic stationary states with arbitrary heterogeneities. We\nalso explicate the exclusive relationship between Lorentzian distributed inputs\nand Lorentzian distributed voltages, whose width happens to coincide with the\npopulation firing rate. A dynamic mean-field approach for unimodal\nheterogeneities further allows us to comprehensively analyze and compare\ncollective dynamics. We find that different types of heterogeneity typically\nyield qualitatively similar dynamics. However, when gap junction coupling is\npresent, Lorentzian heterogeneity induces nonuniversal behavior, obscuring a\ndiversity-induced transition to synchrony.",

As a result, many of their behaviors\nand values for real materials remain poorly understood. Therefore, by using a\nproposed simple modification of the embedded cluster approach that reduces the\ncomputational complexity, we critically analyze the properties of\nexchange-mediated spin-lattice coupling parameters for elemental $3d$\nferromagnets (bcc Fe, fcc Ni, and fcc Co), comparing methods used for their\nextraction and relating their realistic values to symmetry considerations and\norbitally-decomposed contributions.

Theoretical\nmodels of such winds can explain observational correlations between SMBHs and\ntheir host galaxies and the powerful multi-phase outflows observed in a number\nof active galaxies. Analytic models usually assume spherical symmetry and a\nsmooth gas distribution with an adiabatic equation of state. However, the\ninterstellar medium in real galaxies is clumpy and cooling is important,\ncomplicating the analysis. We used a suite of idealised hydrodynamical\nsimulations to isolate the effects of turbulence and cooling on the development\nand global properties of AGN wind-driven outflows on kiloparsec scales. We\nmeasured the outflow velocity, mass outflow rate and momentum and energy\nloading factors as the system evolved over 1.2 Myr and estimated plausible\nobservationally derived values.\n  We find that adiabatic simulations approximately reproduce the analytical\nestimates of outflow properties independently of turbulence or clumpiness.\nHowever, cooling reduces the outflow energy rate by 1-2 orders of magnitude in\nthe smooth simulations and by up to one order of magnitude in the turbulent\nones. The interplay between cooling and turbulence depends on AGN luminosity:\nin Eddington-limited AGN, turbulence enhances the coupling between the AGN wind\nand the gas, while the opposite happens in lower-luminosity simulations. This\noccurs because dense gas clumps are resilient to low-luminosity AGN feedback\nbut get driven away by high-luminosity AGN feedback. The overall properties of\nmulti-phase outflowing gas in our simulations qualitatively agree with\nobservations of multi-phase outflows.

    "abstract": "Exemplar-Free Class Incremental Learning (EFCIL) tackles the problem of\ntraining a model on a sequence of tasks without access to past data. Existing\nstate-of-the-art methods represent classes as Gaussian distributions in the\nfeature extractor's latent space, enabling Bayes classification or training the\nclassifier by replaying pseudo features. However, we identify two critical\nissues that compromise their efficacy when the feature extractor is updated on\nincremental tasks. First, they do not consider that classes' covariance\nmatrices change and must be adapted after each task. Second, they are\nsusceptible to a task-recency bias caused by dimensionality collapse occurring\nduring training. In this work, we propose AdaGauss -- a novel method that\nadapts covariance matrices from task to task and mitigates the task-recency\nbias owing to the additional anti-collapse loss function. AdaGauss yields\nstate-of-the-art results on popular EFCIL benchmarks and datasets when training\nfrom scratch or starting from a pre-trained backbone.

A\nrecent study by McMaster, et al. showed that complex graph measures of the\nconnectome, the graphical representation of a tractogram, vary with spatial\nsampling changes, but biases introduced by anisotropic voxels in the process\nhave not been well characterized. This study uses microstructural measures\n(fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity) and white matter bundle properties\n(bundle volume, length, and surface area) to further understand the effect of\nanisotropic voxels on microstructure and tractography. Methods: The statistical\nsignificance of the selected measures derived from dMRI data were assessed by\ncomparing three white matter bundles at different spatial resolutions with 44\nsubjects from the Human Connectome Project Young Adult dataset scan/rescan data\nusing the Wilcoxon Signed Rank test. The original isotropic resolution (1.25 mm\nisotropic) was explored with six anisotropic resolutions with 0.25 mm\nincremental steps in the z dimension. Then, all generated resolutions were\nupsampled to 1.25 mm isotropic and 1 mm isotropic. Results: There were\nstatistically significant differences between at least one microstructural and\none bundle measure at every resolution (p less than or equal to 0.05, corrected\nfor multiple comparisons). Cohen's d coefficient evaluated the effect size of\nanisotropic voxels on microstructure and tractography. Conclusion: Fractional\nanisotropy and mean diffusivity cannot be recovered with basic up sampling from\nlow quality data with gold standard data. However, the bundle measures from\ntractogram become more repeatable when voxels are resampled to 1 mm isotropic.",

    "abstract": "A cluster id assignment scheme labels each cluster of a clustering with a\ndistinct id. The goal of id assignment is semantic id stability, which means\nthat, whenever possible, a cluster for the same underlying concept as that of a\nhistorical cluster should ideally receive the same id as the historical\ncluster. Semantic id stability allows the users of a clustering to refer to a\nconcept's cluster with an id that is stable across clusterings/time. This paper\ntreats the problem of evaluating the relative merits of id assignment schemes.\nIn particular, it considers a historical clustering with id assignments, and a\nnew clustering with ids assigned by a baseline and an experiment. It produces\nmetrics that characterize both the magnitude and the quality of the id\nassignment diffs between the baseline and the experiment. That happens by\ntransforming the problem of cluster id assignment into a problem of cluster\nmembership, and evaluating it with ABCDE. ABCDE is a sophisticated and scalable\ntechnique for evaluating differences in cluster membership in real-world\napplications, where billions of items are grouped into millions of clusters,\nand some items are more important than others. The paper also describes several\ngeneralizations to the basic evaluation setup for id assignment schemes. For\nexample, it is fairly straightforward to evaluate changes that simultaneously\nmutate cluster memberships and cluster ids. The ideas are generously\nillustrated with examples.",

Unlike prior attacks,\nour method is entirely passive, power-free, and inconspicuous to human\nobservers, enabling legal and stealthy deployment in public environments.\nThrough simulation, physical testbed, and controlled field evaluations, we\ndemonstrate that negative shadows can cause up to 100% off-road deviation or\ncollision rates in specific scenarios; for example, a 20-meter shadow leads to\ncomplete off-road exits at speeds above 10 mph, while 30-meter shadows trigger\nconsistent lane confusion and collisions.

While previously classified as an intermediate\npolar (IP), CJ2056 also exhibits the properties of WZ-Sge-type CVs, such as\ndwarf novae and superoutbursts. With XMM-Newton and NICER, we detected the spin\nperiod up to approximately 2 keV with 7-$\\sigma$ significance. We constrained\nits derivative to |$\\dot{P}$| < 1.8e-12 s/s after correcting for binary orbital\nmotion. The pulsed profile is characterized by a single broad peak with\napproximately 25% modulation. NuSTAR detected a four-fold increase in\nunabsorbed X-ray flux coincident with an optical flare in November 2022. The\nXMM-Newton and NICER X-ray spectra in 0.3-10 keV are best characterized by an\nabsorbed optically-thin three-temperature thermal plasma model (kT = 0.3, 1.0,\nand 4.9 keV), while the NuSTAR spectra in 3-30 keV are best fit by a\nsingle-temperature thermal plasma model (kT = 8.4 keV), both with Fe abundance\n$Z_{Fe}/Z_\\odot$ = 0.3. CJ2056 exhibits similarities to other fast-spinning\nCVs, such as low plasma temperatures, and no significant X-ray absorption at\nlow energies. As the WD's magnetic field strength is unknown, we applied both\nnon-magnetic and magnetic CV spectral models (MKCFLOW and MCVSPEC) to determine\nthe WD mass. The derived WD mass range (M = 0.7-1.0 $M_\\odot$) is above the\ncentrifugal break-up mass limit of 0.56 $M_\\odot$ and consistent with the mean\nWD mass of local CVs (M $\\approx$ 0.8-0.9 $M_\\odot$).",

However,\nML-based DDDAS are vulnerable to adversarial attacks because adversaries can\nalter the input data slightly so that the ML models predict a different result.\nIn this paper, our goal is to build a resilient edge machine learning (reML)\narchitecture that is designed to withstand adversarial attacks by performing\nData Air Gap Transformation (DAGT) to anonymize data feature spaces using deep\nneural networks and randomize the ML models used for predictions. The reML is\nbased on the Resilient DDDAS paradigm, Moving Target Defense (MTD) theory, and\nTinyML and is applied to combat adversarial attacks on ICS. Furthermore, the\nproposed approach is power-efficient and privacy-preserving and, therefore, can\nbe deployed on power-constrained devices to enhance ICS security. This approach\nenables resilient ML inference at the edge by shifting the computation from the\ncomputing-intensive platforms to the resource-constrained edge devices. The\nincorporation of TinyML with TensorFlow Lite ensures efficient resource\nutilization and, consequently, makes reML suitable for deployment in various\nindustrial control environments. Furthermore, the dynamic nature of reML,\nfacilitated by the resilient DDDAS development environment, allows for\ncontinuous adaptation and improvement in response to emerging threats. Lastly,\nwe evaluate our approach on an ICS dataset and demonstrate that reML provides a\nviable and effective solution for resilient ML inference at the edge devices.",

We\nfirst establish the existence of wedge boundaries and associated entropy\nsolutions of the inverse problem when the pressure on the wedge boundary is\nlarger than that of the incoming flow but less than a critical value, and the\ntotal variation of the incoming flow and the pressure distribution is\nsufficiently small. This is achieved by carefully constructing suitable\napproximate solutions and approximate boundaries via developing a wave-front\ntracking algorithm and the rigorous proof of their strong convergence to a\nglobal entropy solution and a wedge boundary respectively. Then we establish\nthe $L^{\\infty}$--stability of the wedge boundaries, by introducing a modified\nLyapunov functional for two different solutions with two distinct boundaries,\neach of which may contain a strong shock-front. The modified Lyapunov\nfunctional is carefully designed to control the distance between the two\nboundaries and is proved to be Lipschitz continuous with respect to the\ndifferences of the incoming flow and the pressure on the wedge, which leads to\nthe existence of the Lipschitz semigroup. Finally, when the pressure\ndistribution on the wedge boundary is sufficiently close to that of the\nincoming flow, using this semigroup, we compare two solutions of the inverse\nproblem in the respective supersonic full Euler flow and potential flow and\nprove that, at $x>0$, the distance between the two boundaries and the\ndifference of the two solutions are of the same order of $x$ multiplied by the\ncube of the perturbations of the initial boundary data in $L^\\infty\\cap BV$.",

We select CR\ntransport parameters that yield a reasonable trade off between realistic\nlarge-scale integrated properties, and galactic CR pressure profiles predicted\nby more complex models. The resulting simulations show that, at fixed halo\nmass, including CRs does not strongly impact the temperature, density, or\n(total) pressure structure of the CGM with respect to the fiducial TNG model.\nHowever, cosmic rays add significant non-thermal pressure support to the halo.\nThis suppresses the star formation activity and thus stellar masses of\ngalaxies, from dwarf to L$^\\star$ halos. The cosmic star formation rate\ndensity, stellar mass function, and stellar mass to halo mass relation are all\nreshaped by CRs. Galaxy sizes and halo-scale gas fractions are more mildly\naffected, while lower gas densities in the interstellar medium inhibit\nsupermassive black hole growth. Halo gas is also less magnetized, and less\nmetal enriched. These differences are primarily driven by suppressed gas\naccretion onto halos and galaxies, as well as weaker galactic outflows in the\npresence of CRs.

We convert images into networks of interconnected human\nunderstandable features or visual concepts. Through extensive testing on two\nnovel tasks, including ablation studies with large vocabularies and diverse\ntasks, we demonstrate the method's effectiveness. This approach enhances DNN\nresilience to OOD data and promises improved performance in various\napplications.",

    "abstract": "Infinite nuclear matter provides valuable insights into the behavior of\nnuclear systems and aids our understanding of atomic nuclei and large-scale\nstellar objects such as neutron stars. However, partly due to the large basis\nneeded to converge the system's binding energy, size-extensive methods such as\ncoupled-cluster theory struggle with long computational run times, even using\nthe nation's largest high-performance computing facilities. This research\nintroduces a novel approach to the problem. We propose using a machine learning\nmethod to predict the coupled-cluster energies of infinite matter systems in\nthe complete basis limit, leveraging only data collected using smaller basis\nsets. This method promises to deliver high-accuracy results with significantly\nreduced run times. The sequential regression extrapolation (SRE) algorithm,\nbased on Gaussian processes, was created to perform these extrapolations. By\ncombining Bayesian machine learning with a unique method of formatting the\ntraining data, we can create a powerful extrapolator that can make accurate\npredictions given very little data. The SRE algorithm successfully predicted\nthe CCD(T) energies for pure neutron matter across six densities near nuclear\nsaturation density, with an average error of 0.0083 MeV/N. The algorithm\nachieved an average error of 0.038 MeV/A for symmetric nuclear matter. These\npredictions were made with a time savings of 83.8 node hours for pure neutron\nmatter and 284 node hours for symmetric nuclear matter. Additionally, the\nsymmetry energy at these six densities was predicted with an average error of\n0.031 MeV/A and a total time savings of 368 node hours compared to the\ntraditional converged coupled-cluster calculations performed without the SRE\nalgorithm.",

The simultaneous geometric,\nkinematic, and physics constraints make this problem especially challenging.\nPrior work on rearrangement planning often relaxes some of these constraints by\nassuming dexterous hardware, prehensile manipulation, or sparsely occupied\nworkspaces. Our key insight is that by capturing these constraints into a\nunified representation, we could empower a constrained robot to tackle\ndifficult problem instances by modifying the environment in its favor. To this\nend, we introduce a Push-Traversability graph, whose vertices represent poses\nthat the robot can push objects from, and edges represent optimal,\nkinematically feasible, and stable transitions between them. Based on this\ngraph, we develop ReloPush, a graph-based planning framework that takes as\ninput a complex multi-object rearrangement task and breaks it down into a\nsequence of single-object pushing tasks. We evaluate ReloPush across a series\nof challenging scenarios, involving the rearrangement of densely cluttered\nworkspaces with up to nine objects, using a 1/10-scale robot racecar. ReloPush\nexhibits orders of magnitude faster runtimes and significantly more robust\nexecution in the real world, evidenced in lower execution times and fewer\nlosses of object contact, compared to two baselines lacking our proposed graph\nstructure.",

Smaller historical events (lower yield\nexplosions) often include only sparse observations among few modalities and can\ntherefore lack a complete set of discriminants. The covariance structures can\nalso vary significantly between such observations of event (source-type)\ncategories. Both obstacles are problematic for the ``classic'' Event\nCategorization Matrix model. Our work addresses this gap and presents a\nBayesian update to the previous Event Categorization Matrix model, termed the\nBayesian Event Categorization Matrix model, which can be trained on partial\nobservations and does not rely on a pooled covariance structure. We further\naugment the Event Categorization Matrix model with Bayesian Decision Theory so\nthat false negative or false positive rates of an event categorization can be\nreduced in an intuitive manner. To demonstrate improved categorization rates\nfor the Bayesian Event Categorization Matrix model, we compare an array of\nBayesian and classic models with multiple performance metrics using Monte Carlo\nexperiments. We use both synthetic and real data. Our Bayesian models show\nconsistent gains in overall accuracy and a lower false negative rates relative\nto the classic Event Categorization Matrix model.

The CFD\nmodel is validated by comparison with the experiments. Formation of two outward\nvortices in the melt pool is revealed. Surface-active impurities can make the\nsurface tension-temperature function non-monotonous giving raise additional\nvortices with the opposite inward flow direction. The influence of melt\nconvection on the melt pool size is not considerable in the conditions of\nselective laser melting (SLM). The flow velocity in the melt pool is around or\nless than the laser scanning speed. This means insufficient mixing in the melt\npool. One cannot expect a complete homogenization of chemical composition when\nusing powder blends in SLM. The correlation between the error of the Rosenthal\nmodel and the latent heat of fusion is carefully studied resulting an\nanalytical model for estimating the melt pool depth. In the studied SLM cases,\nthe accuracy of the developed analytical model is within 10% relative the CFD\nmodel.

Essentially exact results can be\nobtained for the out-of-equilibrium correlations in the Bose-Hubbard model in\none dimension, but higher dimensions require approximate methods.

Calculations of the\nsingle-particle correlations using this method yield values of the velocity for\ncorrelation spreading that match well with exact methods in one dimension and\nexperiments in one and two dimensions.

    "abstract": "As networks continue to expand and become more interconnected, the need for\nnovel malware detection methods becomes more pronounced. Traditional security\nmeasures are increasingly inadequate against the sophistication of modern cyber\nattacks. Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) has been pivotal in enhancing network\nsecurity, offering an in-depth analysis of network traffic that surpasses\nconventional monitoring techniques. DPI not only examines the metadata of\nnetwork packets, but also dives into the actual content being carried within\nthe packet payloads, providing a comprehensive view of the data flowing through\nnetworks. While the integration of advanced deep learning techniques with DPI\nhas introduced modern methodologies into malware detection and network traffic\nclassification, state-of-the-art supervised learning approaches are limited by\ntheir reliance on large amounts of annotated data and their inability to\ngeneralize to novel, unseen malware threats. To address these limitations, this\npaper leverages the recent advancements in self-supervised learning (SSL) and\nfew-shot learning (FSL). Our proposed self-supervised approach trains a\ntransformer via SSL to learn the embedding of packet content, including\npayload, from vast amounts of unlabeled data by masking portions of packets,\nleading to a learned representation that generalizes to various downstream\ntasks. Once the representation is extracted from the packets, they are used to\ntrain a malware detection algorithm. The representation obtained from the\ntransformer is then used to adapt the malware detector to novel types of\nattacks using few-shot learning approaches. Our experimental results\ndemonstrate that our method achieves classification accuracies of up to 94.76%\non the UNSW-NB15 dataset and 83.25% on the CIC-IoT23 dataset.",

    "abstract": "Many planets have hydrogen-dominated atmospheres, including sub-Neptune\nexoplanets, recently formed planets with primordial atmospheres, and the Solar\nSystem's giant planets. Atmospheric convection behaves differently in\nhydrogen-rich atmospheres compared to higher mean molecular weight atmospheres\ndue to compositional gradients of tracers. Previous 1D studies suggested that\ncompositional gradients of condensing tracers in hydrogen-rich atmospheres can\nentirely shut-off convection when the tracer abundance exceeds a critical\nthreshold, leading to the formation of radiative layers where the temperature\ndecreases faster with height than in convective profiles. We use 3D\nconvection-resolving simulations to determine if convection is inhibited in\nhydrogen-rich atmospheres when the tracer mixing ratio exceeds the critical\nthreshold. Three simulation sets are performed with a water vapor tracer in\nhydrogen-rich atmospheres. First, we perform simulations initialized on\nsaturated isothermal states and find that compositional gradients can\ndestabilize isothermal states, leading to rapid convective mixing. Next,\nsimulations initialized on adiabatic profiles show distinct, stable inhibition\nlayers form when the water vapor tracer exceeds the critical threshold defined\nby previous studies. Within the inhibition layers, a small amount of energy is\ntransported through condensation and re-evaporation, contrary to previous\nfindings. The thermal profile slowly relaxes to a steep radiative state, but\nradiative relaxation timescales are long. Lastly, we show that superadiabatic\ntemperature profiles can remain stable when the tracer abundance is greater\nthan the critical amount. Our results suggest stable layers driven by\ncondensation-induced convective inhibition form in hydrogen-rich atmospheres,\nincluding those of sub-Neptune exoplanets.",

In this work, we investigate how the\npopulation of LRDs and/or other UV-obscured AGN relates to the one of\nunobscured, UV-selected quasars. By comparing their number densities, we infer\nan extremely large and rapidly evolving obscured:unobscured ratio, ranging from\n$\\approx20:1$ at $z\\approx4$ to $\\approx2300:1$ at $z\\approx7$, and possibly\nextending out to very high ($\\approx10^{47}\\,\\mathrm{erg}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$)\nbolometric luminosities.

This implies that either (a) the bolometric\nluminosities of LRDs are strongly overestimated (possibly because LRDs are\ndominated by stellar galaxy light) or (b) LRDs follow different scaling\nrelations than the ones of UV-selected quasars, representing a new population\nof accreting SMBHs emerging in the early Universe. A direct comparison between\nthe clustering of LRDs and the one of faint UV-selected quasars will ultimately\nconfirm these findings, and shed light on key properties of LRDs such as their\nhost mass distribution and duty cycle.

In particular, we show that the anisotropic $\\mathbb{Z}_N$\nLaplacian models defined on the extensions of triangular and honeycomb lattices\nare equivalent when $N$ is coprime to $3$. We also point out that, in contrast\nto previous expectations, the model defined on the extension of Kagome lattice\nis robust against local perturbations if and only if $N$ is coprime to $6$.",

The James\nWebb Space Telescope (JWST) has detected faint active galactic nuclei (AGNs),\nrevealing an abundant population of accreting BHs with masses of $M_\\bullet\\sim\n10^{6-8}~M_\\odot$. This mass range overlaps with the detection scopes of\nspace-based GW interferometers and approaches the upper bounds of the predicted\nmass of seed BHs. We model BH mass assembly in light of the new JWST findings\nto investigate their formation channels and predict merger events. Two types of\nseed BHs are considered: heavy seeds ($M_\\bullet\\sim 10^{2-5}~M_\\odot$) formed\nin rare and overdense cosmic regions, and light seeds ($M_\\bullet\\sim\n10^{1-3}~M_\\odot$) formed as stellar remnants in less massive dark-matter\nhalos. The BHs grow through episodic accretion and merger events, which we\nmodel by fitting the AGN luminosity function to observational data including\nJWST-identified AGNs at $z\\sim 5$. We find that heavy seeds alone struggle to\nexplain quasars and faint JWST-selected AGNs simultaneously, requiring the more\nabundant light seeds.

    "abstract": "Crossed Andreev reflection (CAR) is a process that creates entanglement\nbetween spatially separated electrons and holes. Such entangled pairs have\npotential applications in quantum information processing, and it is therefore\nrelevant to determine how the probability for CAR can be increased. CAR\ncompetes with another non-local process called elastic cotunneling (EC), which\ndoes not create entanglement. In conventional normal\nmetal/superconductor/normal metal heterostructures, earlier theoretical work\npredicted that EC dominates over CAR. Nevertheless, we show numerically that\nwhen the Keldysh-Usadel equations are solved self-consistently in the\nsuperconductor, CAR can dominate over EC. Self-consistency is necessary both\nfor the conversion from a quasiparticle current to a supercurrent and to\ndescribe the spatial variation of the order parameter correctly. A requirement\nfor the CAR probability to surpass the EC probability is that the inverse\nproximity effect is small. Otherwise, the subvoltage density of states becomes\nlarge and EC is strengthened by quasiparticles flowing through the\nsuperconductor. Therefore, CAR becomes dominant in the non-local transport with\nincreasing interface resistance and length of the superconducting region. Our\nresults show that even the simplest possible experimental setup with easily\naccessible normal metals and superconductors can provide dominant CAR by\ndesigning the experimental parameters correctly. We also find that\nspin-splitting in the superconductor increases the subvoltage density of\nstates, and thus always favors EC over CAR. Finally, we tune the chemical\npotential in the leads such that transport is governed by electrons of one spin\ntype. This can increase the CAR probability at finite values of the\nspin-splitting compared to using a spin-degenerate voltage bias, and provides a\nway to control the spin of the conduction electrons electrically.",

Clouds are ubiquitous in exoplanets' atmospheres and play an\nimportant role in setting the opacity and chemical inventory of the atmosphere.\nUnderstanding clouds is a critical step in interpreting exoplanets'\nspectroscopic data. Aims. The aim is to model the multi-species nature of\nclouds in atmospheric retrieval studies. To this end, we develop ExoLyn - a 1D\ncloud model that balances physical consistency with computational efficiency.\nMethods. ExoLyn solves the transport equation of cloud particles and vapor\nunder cloud condensation rates that are self-consistently calculated from\nthermodynamics. ExoLyn is a standalone, open source package capable to be\ncombined with \\texttt{optool} to calculate solid opacities and with\n\\texttt{petitRADTRANS} to generate transmission or emission spectra. Results.\nWith ExoLyn we find that the compositional structure of clouds in hot Jupiter\nplanets' atmospheres is layered with a cloud dominated by magnesium-silicates\non top of an iron cloud. This finding is consistent with more complex cloud\nformation models but can be obtained with ExoLyn in only a few seconds. The\ncomposition of the cloud particles can be constrained from the spectrum, for\nexample, MgSiO3 and Mg2SiO4 components give rise to an absorption feature at 8\n- 10 um. We investigate the dependence of the cloud structure on the bulk\nelemental composition of the planet and find that SiO2-dominated clouds forms\non metal-rich planet and Fe clouds with strong extinction effect forms on\nC-rich planet.

Additionally, we observe an offset\n(10{\\deg}-40{\\deg}) of the peak metallicity to the bar major axis in\nstar-forming bars in low-mass galaxies, and more metal-rich regions outside the\nends of the bar in long bars and quenched galaxies. Furthermore, there is a\nsubtle trend of lower metallicities on the leading side of spiral arms compared\nto the trailing side. Finally, we report a spiral arm surface density feature,\nwhich could point towards a dominant bar-spiral connection and pitch angle of\n$\\alpha \\sim 25${\\deg}. We interpret these features in the context of bar\nformation and the impact of large-scale gas flows associated with their\npresence.",

We demonstrate that these hairy black holes are themselves\nunstable to the emission of large dual giant gravitons. We propose that the\nendpoint to this instability is given by Dual Dressed Black Holes (DDBH)s;\nconfigurations consisting of one, two, or three very large dual giant gravitons\nsurrounding a core $AdS$ black hole with one, two, or three $SO(6)$ chemical\npotentials equal to unity. The dual giants each live at $AdS$ radial\ncoordinates of order $\\sqrt{N}$ and each carry charge of order $N^2$. The large\nseparation makes DDBHs a very weakly interacting mix of their components and\nallows for a simple computation of their thermodynamics. We conjecture that\nDDBHs dominate the phase diagram of ${\\cal N}=4$ Yang-Mills over a range of\nenergies around the BPS plane, and provide an explicit construction of this\nphase diagram, briefly discussing the interplay with supersymmetry. We develop\nthe quantum description of dual giants around black hole backgrounds and\nexplicitly verify that DDBHs are stable to potential tunneling instabilities,\nprecisely when the chemical potentials of the core black holes equal unity.

For each group, we\ncombine the galaxy photometry into a finely-sampled composite SED, and stack\ntheir spectra. This method enables the study of more complete galaxy samples,\nincluding galaxies with very faint emission lines. We fit these composite SEDs\nwith Prospector to measure the stellar attenuation and SED-based star-formation\nrates (SFRs). We also derive emission-line properties from the spectral stacks,\nincluding Balmer decrements, dust-corrected SFRs, and metallicities. We find\nthat stellar attenuation correlates most strongly with mass, while nebular\nattenuation correlates strongly with both mass and SFR. Furthermore, the excess\nof nebular compared to stellar attenuation correlates most strongly with SFR.\nThe highest SFR group has 2 mag of excess nebular attenuation. Our results are\nconsistent with a model in which star-forming regions become more dusty as\ngalaxy mass increases. To explain the increasing excess nebular attenuation, we\nrequire a progressively larger fraction of star formation to occur in\nhighly-obscured regions with increasing SFR. This highly-obscured star\nformation could occur in dusty clumps or central starbursts. Additionally, as\neach galaxy group represents a different evolutionary stage, we study their\nlocations on the UVJ and SFR-mass diagrams.

Instrumental sensitivity to such planets is low and\nthe number of objects we will discover is strongly dependent on the underlying\nplanet mass function. In this work, we provide a physically motivated planet\nmass function by combining the efficiency of planet formation by pebble\naccretion with the observed disk mass function. Because the disk mass function\nfor M dwarfs ($0.4-0.6 \\, M_\\odot$) is bottom heavy, the initial planet mass\nfunction is also expected to be bottom-heavy, skewing towards Ganymede and Mars\nmass objects, more so for heavier initial planetary seeds.

For initial planet separations of\n$\\geq$3 local disk scale heights, we find that Ganymede and Mars mass planets\ndo not grow significantly by mergers.

In our\nenhanced-physics simulation, the galaxy develops a bistable ISM structure\n(warm, with $T \\sim 10^4$ K, and cold, with $T < 100$ K) and exhibits\nsignificantly more efficient, early, and bursty star formation than in TNG.\nNotably, the stellar disk of this MW progenitor forms extremely early, around\n$z\\sim6-7$, and exhibits chemo-kinematic properties consistent with the\nlow-metallicity population of the MW stars. The disk forms rapidly, on a\ntimescale of $\\sim$0.2 Gyr which is significantly shorter than the timescale\nimplied by the observable chemo-kinematic signatures of disk spinup, $\\sim$0.7\nGyr, due to the scatter in the age--metallicity relation. The rotational\nsupport of the gas disk and the location of the galaxy on the main sequence are\nconsistent with early disk galaxies observed by JWST and ALMA at $z\\sim4-7$,\nsuggesting that some of these galaxies could be progenitors of MW-like systems.\nRemarkably, the variation of the global star formation rate (SFR) before disk\nformation is similar to the observed SFR scatter at these early times. Our\nfindings underscore the critical role of modeling a turbulent cold ISM and\nturbulence-regulated star formation and feedback in driving early SFR\nvariability, while at the same time enabling early disk formation, without\ndestroying it with overly efficient stellar feedback.",

In this work, we study single pairs of dopants in a cylindrical\nsystem using the density-matrix renormalization group algorithm. We identify\ntwo coexisting charge configurations that couple to the spin environment in\ndifferent ways: A tightly bound configuration featuring (next-)nearest-neighbor\npairs and a stripe-like configuration of dopants on opposite sides of the\ncylinder, accompanied by a spin domain wall. Thus, we establish that the\ninterplay between stripe order and uniform pairing, central to the models'\nphases at finite doping, has its origin at the single-pair level. By\ninterpolating between the Hubbard and the related $t$-$J$ model, we are able to\nquantitatively understand discrepancies in the pairing properties of the two\nmodels through the three-site hopping term usually omitted from the $t$-$J$\nHamiltonian.

    "abstract": "Building on the success of diffusion models in visual generation, flow-based\nmodels reemerge as another prominent family of generative models that have\nachieved competitive or better performance in terms of both visual quality and\ninference speed. By learning the velocity field through flow-matching,\nflow-based models tend to produce a straighter sampling trajectory, which is\nadvantageous during the sampling process. However, unlike diffusion models for\nwhich fast samplers are well-developed, efficient sampling of flow-based\ngenerative models has been rarely explored. In this paper, we propose a\nframework called FlowTurbo to accelerate the sampling of flow-based models\nwhile still enhancing the sampling quality. Our primary observation is that the\nvelocity predictor's outputs in the flow-based models will become stable during\nthe sampling, enabling the estimation of velocity via a lightweight velocity\nrefiner. Additionally, we introduce several techniques including a pseudo\ncorrector and sample-aware compilation to further reduce inference time. Since\nFlowTurbo does not change the multi-step sampling paradigm, it can be\neffectively applied for various tasks such as image editing, inpainting, etc.\nBy integrating FlowTurbo into different flow-based models, we obtain an\nacceleration ratio of 53.1%$\\sim$58.3% on class-conditional generation and\n29.8%$\\sim$38.5% on text-to-image generation. Notably, FlowTurbo reaches an FID\nof 2.12 on ImageNet with 100 (ms / img) and FID of 3.93 with 38 (ms / img),\nachieving the real-time image generation and establishing the new\nstate-of-the-art.

However, the development\nof LMMs with 3D scene understanding capabilities has been hindered by the lack\nof large-scale 3D vision-language datasets and powerful 3D encoders. In this\npaper, we introduce a simple yet effective framework called LLaVA-3D.\nLeveraging the strong 2D visual understanding priors from LLaVA, our LLaVA-3D\nefficiently adapts LLaVA for 3D scene understanding without compromising 2D\nunderstanding capabilities. To achieve this, we utilize the 3D position\nembeddings to enhance the 2D CLIP Patches with 3D spatial context information\nand construct 3D patches. By integrating the 3D position embeddings into 2D\nLMMs and employing joint 2D and 3D vision-language instruction tuning, we\nestablish a unified architecture for both 2D visual understanding and 3D scene\nunderstanding. In contrast to previous 3D LMMs, LLaVA-3D supports decoding\naccurate 3D spatial perception outputs, e.g., 3D bounding boxes, directly from\nthese 3D patches, without relying on the time-consuming off-the-shelf 3D\nsegmentors. Experimental results show that LLaVA-3D converges 3.5x faster than\nexisting 3D LMMs when trained on 3D vision-language datasets. Moreover,\nLLaVA-3D not only achieves state-of-the-art performance across various 3D tasks\nbut also maintains comparable 2D visual understanding and vision-language\nconversation capabilities with LLaVA.",

    "abstract": "Leveraging the visual priors of pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models\noffers a promising solution to enhance zero-shot generalization in dense\nprediction tasks. However, existing methods often uncritically use the original\ndiffusion formulation, which may not be optimal due to the fundamental\ndifferences between dense prediction and image generation. In this paper, we\nprovide a systemic analysis of the diffusion formulation for the dense\nprediction, focusing on both quality and efficiency. And we find that the\noriginal parameterization type for image generation, which learns to predict\nnoise, is harmful for dense prediction; the multi-step noising/denoising\ndiffusion process is also unnecessary and challenging to optimize. Based on\nthese insights, we introduce Lotus, a diffusion-based visual foundation model\nwith a simple yet effective adaptation protocol for dense prediction.\nSpecifically, Lotus is trained to directly predict annotations instead of\nnoise, thereby avoiding harmful variance. We also reformulate the diffusion\nprocess into a single-step procedure, simplifying optimization and\nsignificantly boosting inference speed. Additionally, we introduce a novel\ntuning strategy called detail preserver, which achieves more accurate and\nfine-grained predictions. Without scaling up the training data or model\ncapacity, Lotus achieves SoTA performance in zero-shot depth and normal\nestimation across various datasets. It also enhances efficiency, being\nsignificantly faster than most existing diffusion-based methods. Lotus'\nsuperior quality and efficiency also enable a wide range of practical\napplications, such as joint estimation, single/multi-view 3D reconstruction,\netc. Project page: https://lotus3d.github.io/.",

This work develops Robot\nSee Robot Do (RSRD), a method for imitating articulated object manipulation\nfrom a single monocular RGB human demonstration given a single static\nmulti-view object scan. We first propose 4D Differentiable Part Models\n(4D-DPM), a method for recovering 3D part motion from a monocular video with\ndifferentiable rendering. This analysis-by-synthesis approach uses part-centric\nfeature fields in an iterative optimization which enables the use of geometric\nregularizers to recover 3D motions from only a single video. Given this 4D\nreconstruction, the robot replicates object trajectories by planning bimanual\narm motions that induce the demonstrated object part motion. By representing\ndemonstrations as part-centric trajectories, RSRD focuses on replicating the\ndemonstration's intended behavior while considering the robot's own\nmorphological limits, rather than attempting to reproduce the hand's motion. We\nevaluate 4D-DPM's 3D tracking accuracy on ground truth annotated 3D part\ntrajectories and RSRD's physical execution performance on 9 objects across 10\ntrials each on a bimanual YuMi robot.

    "abstract": "Proxy pattern-mixture models (PPMM) have previously been proposed as a\nmodel-based framework for assessing the potential for nonignorable nonresponse\nin sample surveys and nonignorable selection in nonprobability samples. One\ndefining feature of the PPMM is the single sensitivity parameter, $\\phi$, that\nranges from 0 to 1 and governs the degree of departure from ignorability. While\nthis sensitivity parameter is attractive in its simplicity, it may also be of\ninterest to describe departures from ignorability in terms of how the odds of\nresponse (or selection) depend on the outcome being measured. In this paper, we\nre-express the PPMM as a selection model, using the known relationship between\npattern-mixture models and selection models, in order to better understand the\nunderlying assumptions of the PPMM and the implied effect of the outcome on\nnonresponse. The selection model that corresponds to the PPMM is a quadratic\nfunction of the survey outcome and proxy variable, and the magnitude of the\neffect depends on the value of the sensitivity parameter, $\\phi$\n(missingness/selection mechanism), the differences in the proxy means and\nstandard deviations for the respondent and nonrespondent populations, and the\nstrength of the proxy, $\\rho^{(1)}$. Large values of $\\phi$ (beyond $0.5$)\noften result in unrealistic selection mechanisms, and the corresponding\nselection model can be used to establish more realistic bounds on $\\phi$.

In this\npaper, we investigate the consequences of projective algebras formed by\nnon-invertible symmetries and lattice translations in a generalized $1+1$D\nquantum XY model based on group-valued qudits. This model is specified by a\nfinite group $G$ and enjoys a projective $\\mathsf{Rep}(G)\\times Z(G)$ and\ntranslation symmetry, where symmetry operators obey a projective algebra in the\npresence of symmetry defects. For invertible symmetries, such projective\nalgebras imply Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) anomalies. However, this is not\ngenerally true for non-invertible symmetries, and we derive a condition on $G$\nfor the existence of an LSM anomaly. When this condition is not met, we prove\nan SPT-LSM theorem: any unique and gapped ground state is necessarily a\nnon-invertible weak symmetry protected topological (SPT) state with non-trivial\nentanglement, for which we construct an example fixed-point Hamiltonian. The\nprojectivity also affects the dual symmetries after gauging\n$\\mathsf{Rep}(G)\\times Z(G)$ sub-symmetries, giving rise to non-Abelian and\nnon-invertible dipole symmetries, as well as non-invertible translations.

A key contribution of this work lies in the\neffective use of synthetic data for training AI models in AR applications,\naddressing the significant challenges of obtaining real-world datasets in\nhighly dynamic satellite environments, as well as the creation of the Segmented\nAnything Model for Automatic Labelling (SAMAL), which facilitates the automatic\nannotation of real data, achieving speeds up to 20 times faster than manual\nhuman annotation. The findings demonstrate the efficacy of AI-driven AR systems\nin automating critical satellite assembly tasks, setting a foundation for\nfuture innovations in the space industry.",

    "abstract": "Self-supervised pretraining (SSP) has shown promising results in learning\nfrom large unlabeled datasets and, thus, could be useful for automated\ncardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) short-axis cine segmentation. However,\ninconsistent reports of the benefits of SSP for segmentation have made it\ndifficult to apply SSP to CMR. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate SSP\nmethods for CMR cine segmentation.\n  To this end, short-axis cine stacks of 296 subjects (90618 2D slices) were\nused for unlabeled pretraining with four SSP methods; SimCLR, positional\ncontrastive learning, DINO, and masked image modeling (MIM). Subsets of varying\nnumbers of subjects were used for supervised fine-tuning of 2D models for each\nSSP method, as well as to train a 2D baseline model from scratch. The\nfine-tuned models were compared to the baseline using the 3D Dice similarity\ncoefficient (DSC) in a test dataset of 140 subjects.\n  The SSP methods showed no performance gains with the largest supervised\nfine-tuning subset compared to the baseline (DSC = 0.89). When only 10 subjects\n(231 2D slices) are available for supervised training, SSP using MIM (DSC =\n0.86) improves over training from scratch (DSC = 0.82).\n  This study found that SSP is valuable for CMR cine segmentation when labeled\ntraining data is scarce, but does not aid state-of-the-art deep learning\nmethods when ample labeled data is available. Moreover, the choice of SSP\nmethod is important. The code is publicly available at:\nhttps://github.com/q-cardIA/ssp-cmr-cine-segmentation",

    "abstract": "Crack detection, particularly from pavement images, presents a formidable\nchallenge in the domain of computer vision due to several inherent complexities\nsuch as intensity inhomogeneity, intricate topologies, low contrast, and noisy\nbackgrounds. Automated crack detection is crucial for maintaining the\nstructural integrity of essential infrastructures, including buildings,\npavements, and bridges. Existing lightweight methods often face challenges\nincluding computational inefficiency, complex crack patterns, and difficult\nbackgrounds, leading to inaccurate detection and impracticality for real-world\napplications. To address these limitations, we propose EfficientCrackNet, a\nlightweight hybrid model combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and\ntransformers for precise crack segmentation. EfficientCrackNet integrates\ndepthwise separable convolutions (DSC) layers and MobileViT block to capture\nboth global and local features. The model employs an Edge Extraction Method\n(EEM) and for efficient crack edge detection without pretraining, and\nUltra-Lightweight Subspace Attention Module (ULSAM) to enhance feature\nextraction. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets Crack500,\nDeepCrack, and GAPs384 demonstrate that EfficientCrackNet achieves superior\nperformance compared to existing lightweight models, while requiring only 0.26M\nparameters, and 0.483 FLOPs (G). The proposed model offers an optimal balance\nbetween accuracy and computational efficiency, outperforming state-of-the-art\nlightweight models, and providing a robust and adaptable solution for\nreal-world crack segmentation.",

MBHs with masses\nin the range of $10^2 - 10^5 \\, \\rm M_\\odot$ are represented by accreting sink\nparticles without feedback. We find that the presence of NSCs boost nuclear SF\n(i.e. NSC growth) and MBH accretion by funneling gas to the central few\nparsecs. Low-mass MBHs grow more rapidly on $\\sim 600$ Myr timescales,\nexceeding their Eddington rates at peak accretion. MBH accretion and nuclear SF\nis episodic (i.e. leads to multiple stellar generations), coeval and regulated\nby SN explosions. On 40 - 60 Myr timescales the first SN of each episode\nterminates MBH accretion and nuclear SF. Without NSCs, low-mass MBHs do not\ngrow and MBH accretion and reduced nuclear SF become irregular and\nuncorrelated. This study gives the first insights into the possible\nco-evolution of MBHs and NSCs in low-mass galaxies and highlights the\nimportance of considering dense NSCs in galactic studies of MBH growth.",

A graph $G$ is called \\emph{interval\ncolorable} if it has an interval $t$-coloring for some positive integer $t$.\nLet $\\mathfrak{N}$ be the set of all interval colorable graphs. For a graph\n$G\\in \\mathfrak{N}$, we denote by $w(G)$ and $W(G)$ the minimum and maximum\nnumber of colors in an interval coloring of a graph $G$, respectively. In this\npaper we present some new sharp bounds on $W(G\\square H)$ for graphs $G$ and\n$H$ satisfying various conditions. In particular, we show that if $G,H\\in\n\\mathfrak{N}$ and $H$ is an $r$-regular graph, then $W(G\\square H)\\geq\nW(G)+W(H)+r$. We also derive a new upper bound on $W(G)$ for interval colorable\nconnected graphs with additional distance conditions. Based on these bounds, we\nimprove known lower and upper bounds on $W(C_{2n_{1}}\\square\nC_{2n_{2}}\\square\\cdots \\square C_{2n_{k}})$ for $k$-dimensional tori\n$C_{2n_{1}}\\square C_{2n_{2}}\\square\\cdots \\square C_{2n_{k}}$ and on\n$W(K_{2n_{1}}\\square K_{2n_{2}}\\square\\cdots \\square K_{2n_{k}})$ for Hamming\ngraphs $K_{2n_{1}}\\square K_{2n_{2}}\\square\\cdots \\square K_{2n_{k}}$, and\nthese new bounds coincide with each other for hypercubes.

In this paper, we describe DPK architecture and show its\nperformance from a small scale to a very large number of CPUs. The modules from\nDPK have been used for the preparation of Granite Models [1] [2].

In [21], a leapfrog\nbased local time-stepping method was proposed for the inhomogeneous wave\nequation, which applies standard leapfrog time-marching with a smaller\ntime-step inside the refined region. Here, to remove potential instability at\ncertain time-steps, a stabilized version is proposed which leads to optimal\nL2-error estimates under a CFL condition independent of the coarse-to-fine mesh\nratio.

We detect the radio halo emission to the extent of $\\sim$ 1.5\nMpc at 400 MHz, significantly larger than previously reported, along with five\ntailed galaxies in the central region. We also report the discovery of an\nunknown diffuse source 'U', at the cluster periphery, with an extent of 300\nkpc. Using the available observations, we have found that the radio spectrum of\nthe halo is well-fitted with a single power law, having a spectral index of\n$-1.36 \\pm 0.05$, indicating that it is not an ultra-steep spectrum radio halo.\nOur low-resolution (25$''$) resolved spectral map shows an overall uniform\nspectral index, with some patches of fluctuations. The X-ray and radio surface\nbrightness are morphologically co-spatial, with a slight extension along the\nnorthwest-southeast direction, seen in both maps. The radio and X-ray surface\nbrightness indicates strong positive correlations, with sub-linear correlation\nslopes ($\\sim$ 0.71). Multiple tailed galaxies and the radio halo indicate a\nhigh dynamical activity at the cluster central region.",

We propose FreeEdit, a novel approach for achieving\nsuch reference-based image editing, which can accurately reproduce the visual\nconcept from the reference image based on user-friendly language instructions.\nOur approach leverages the multi-modal instruction encoder to encode language\ninstructions to guide the editing process. This implicit way of locating the\nediting area eliminates the need for manual editing masks. To enhance the\nreconstruction of reference details, we introduce the Decoupled Residual\nReferAttention (DRRA) module. This module is designed to integrate fine-grained\nreference features extracted by a detail extractor into the image editing\nprocess in a residual way without interfering with the original self-attention.\nGiven that existing datasets are unsuitable for reference-based image editing\ntasks, particularly due to the difficulty in constructing image triplets that\ninclude a reference image, we curate a high-quality dataset, FreeBench, using a\nnewly developed twice-repainting scheme. FreeBench comprises the images before\nand after editing, detailed editing instructions, as well as a reference image\nthat maintains the identity of the edited object, encompassing tasks such as\nobject addition, replacement, and deletion. By conducting phased training on\nFreeBench followed by quality tuning, FreeEdit achieves high-quality zero-shot\nediting through convenient language instructions.

Here, we propose a graph-based communicative message passing neural\nnetwork (CMPNN) algorithm that can predict both the peak positions and absolute\nintensities corresponding to density functional theory (DFT) calculated molar\nabsorptivities in the IR domain. By modifying existing spectral loss functions,\nwe show that our method is able to predict with DFT-accuracy level the IR molar\nabsorptivities of a series of hydrocarbons containing up to ten carbon atoms\nand apply the model to a set of larger molecules. We also compare the predicted\nspectra with those generated by the direct message passing neural network\n(DMPNN).

The simulations produce hemispheric core dynamos with cycles and\ntypical magnetic field strengths around 60 kG. However, only a very small\nfraction of the magnetic energy is able to reach the surface.

While the analogous ranking function synthesis problem for\nlinear arithmetic is decidable, even checking whether a given function ranks an\ninteger loop is undecidable in the nonlinear setting. We side-step the\ndecidability barrier by working within the theory of linear integer/real rings\n(LIRR) rather than the standard model of arithmetic. We develop a termination\nanalysis that is guaranteed to succeed if a loop (expressed as a formula)\nadmits a (lexicographic) polynomial ranking function. In contrast to\ntemplate-based ranking function synthesis in real arithmetic, our completeness\nresult holds for lexicographic ranking functions of unbounded dimension and\ndegree, and effectively subsumes linear lexicographic ranking function\nsynthesis for linear integer loops.",

We\nintroduce LightAvatar, the first head avatar model based on neural light fields\n(NeLFs). LightAvatar renders an image from 3DMM parameters and a camera pose\nvia a single network forward pass, without using mesh or volume rendering. The\nproposed approach, while being conceptually appealing, poses a significant\nchallenge towards real-time efficiency and training stability. To resolve them,\nwe introduce dedicated network designs to obtain proper representations for the\nNeLF model and maintain a low FLOPs budget.

A warping field\nnetwork is introduced to correct the fitting error in the real data so that the\nmodel can learn better.

Existing\nvisual place recognition pipelines encode the \"whole\" image and search for\nmatches. This poses a fundamental challenge in matching two images of the same\nplace captured from different camera viewpoints: \"the similarity of what\noverlaps can be dominated by the dissimilarity of what does not overlap\". We\naddress this by encoding and searching for \"image segments\" instead of the\nwhole images. We propose to use open-set image segmentation to decompose an\nimage into `meaningful' entities (i.e., things and stuff). This enables us to\ncreate a novel image representation as a collection of multiple overlapping\nsubgraphs connecting a segment with its neighboring segments, dubbed\nSuperSegment. Furthermore, to efficiently encode these SuperSegments into\ncompact vector representations, we propose a novel factorized representation of\nfeature aggregation. We show that retrieving these partial representations\nleads to significantly higher recognition recall than the typical whole image\nbased retrieval. Our segments-based approach, dubbed SegVLAD, sets a new\nstate-of-the-art in place recognition on a diverse selection of benchmark\ndatasets, while being applicable to both generic and task-specialized image\nencoders.

Small-scale\napps employ short-range radios like Zigbee,BLE while large-scale apps employ\nlong-range radios like LoRa,NB-IoT. The other upcoming category of apps like\nP2P energy-trade in smart homes are termed mesoscale IoT apps. There are no\nspecialized radios for these apps. They either use short/long-range radios. To\nclose this gap, we explored mesoscale apps using the COTS IoT radios available.\nOur qualitative analysis identifies Zigbee and LoRa as potential candidates.\nOur quantitative analysis on single and multi-hop topologies showed that Zigbee\nand LoRa achieve competitive throughput at a distance of 500-1200m from the\ngateway. A fundamental finding of these analyses is that a multi-radio system\nthat can efficiently switch between Zigbee and LoRa performs better than the\nsingle-radio systems. However, instantaneously selecting and switching to a\nhigh-throughput radio during transmission is not trivial because of the erratic\nlink quality dynamics. To address this issue, we developed MARS, that uses path\nquality metrics to instantaneously select the high-throughput radio during\ntransmission. However, realizing MARS on resource-constrained end devices\nentails the challenge of obtaining instantaneous path-quality metrics.\nTraditional path quality estimation is not instantaneous due to propagation and\nqueuing delays. We overcome this challenge by showing that collecting local\npath metrics as input to our decision trees provides sufficient information to\ninstantaneously identify the high-throughput radio. The radio selector of MARS\nis powered by TAO-CART trees. The evaluation of MARS on a large-scale mesh\ntopology at two different locations shows that MARS can efficiently identify\nand switch to the high-throughput radio during transmission, leading to an\naverage throughput gain of 48.2% and 49.79% over its competitors.",

In DPSS, the input is a set,~$S$, of~$n$ items,\nwhere each item,~$x$, has a non-negative integer weight,~$w(x)$. Given a pair\nof query parameters, $(\\alpha, \\beta)$, each of which is a non-negative\nrational number, a parameterized subset sampling query on~$S$ seeks to return a\nsubset $T \\subseteq S$ such that each item $x \\in S$ is selected in~$T$,\nindependently, with probability $p_x(\\alpha, \\beta) = \\min\n\\left\\{\\frac{w(x)}{\\alpha \\sum_{x\\in S} w(x)+\\beta}, 1 \\right\\}$. More\nspecifically, the DPSS problem is defined in a dynamic setting, where the item\nset,~$S$, can be updated with insertions of new items or deletions of existing\nitems. Our first main result is an optimal algorithm for solving the DPSS\nproblem, which achieves~$O(n)$ pre-processing time, $O(1+\\mu_S(\\alpha,\\beta))$\nexpected time for each query parameterized by $(\\alpha, \\beta)$, given\non-the-fly, and $O(1)$ time for each update; here, $\\mu_S(\\alpha,\\beta)$ is the\nexpected size of the query result. At all times, the worst-case space\nconsumption of our algorithm is linear in the current number of items in~$S$.\nOur second main contribution is a hardness result for the DPSS problem when the\nitem weights are~$O(1)$-word float numbers, rather than integers. Specifically,\nwe reduce Integer Sorting to the deletion-only DPSS problem with float item\nweights. Our reduction implies that an optimal algorithm for deletion-only DPSS\nwith float item weights (achieving all the same bounds as aforementioned)\nimplies an optimal algorithm for Integer Sorting. The latter remains an\nimportant open problem.

    "abstract": "Simulating fluid flow around arbitrary shapes is key to solving various\nengineering problems. However, simulating flow physics across complex\ngeometries remains numerically challenging and computationally\nresource-intensive, particularly when using conventional PDE solvers. Machine\nlearning methods offer attractive opportunities to create fast and adaptable\nPDE solvers. However, benchmark datasets to measure the performance of such\nmethods are scarce, especially for flow physics across complex geometries. We\nintroduce FlowBench, a dataset for neural simulators with over 10K samples,\nwhich is currently larger than any publicly available flow physics dataset.\nFlowBench contains flow simulation data across complex geometries\n(\\textit{parametric vs. non-parametric}), spanning a range of flow conditions\n(\\textit{Reynolds number and Grashoff number}), capturing a diverse array of\nflow phenomena (\\textit{steady vs. transient; forced vs. free convection}), and\nfor both 2D and 3D. FlowBench contains over 10K data samples, with each sample\nthe outcome of a fully resolved, direct numerical simulation using a\nwell-validated simulator framework designed for modeling transport phenomena in\ncomplex geometries. For each sample, we include velocity, pressure, and\ntemperature field data at 3 different resolutions and several summary\nstatistics features of engineering relevance (such as coefficients of lift and\ndrag, and Nusselt numbers). %Additionally, we include masks and signed distance\nfields for each shape. We envision that FlowBench will enable evaluating the\ninterplay between complex geometry, coupled flow phenomena, and data\nsufficiency on the performance of current, and future, neural PDE solvers. We\nenumerate several evaluation metrics to help rank order the performance of\nneural PDE solvers. We benchmark the performance of several baseline methods\nincluding FNO, CNO, WNO, and DeepONet.",

However, challenges remain\ndue to multi-agent scene uncertainty and heterogeneous interaction. Current\ndense and sparse behavioral representations struggle with inefficiency and\ninconsistency in multi-agent modeling, leading to instability of collective\nbehavioral patterns when integrating prediction and planning (IPP). To address\nthis, we initiate a topological formation that serves as a compliant behavioral\nforeground to guide downstream trajectory generations. Specifically, we\nintroduce Behavioral Topology (BeTop), a pivotal topological formulation that\nexplicitly represents the consensual behavioral pattern among multi-agent\nfuture. BeTop is derived from braid theory to distill compliant interactive\ntopology from multi-agent future trajectories. A synergistic learning framework\n(BeTopNet) supervised by BeTop facilitates the consistency of behavior\nprediction and planning within the predicted topology priors. Through imitative\ncontingency learning, BeTop also effectively manages behavioral uncertainty for\nprediction and planning. Extensive verification on large-scale real-world\ndatasets, including nuPlan and WOMD, demonstrates that BeTop achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in both prediction and planning tasks. Further\nvalidations on the proposed interactive scenario benchmark showcase planning\ncompliance in interactive cases.",

If the detected GWB signal is entirely due to BBHs, a significantly\npositive redshift evolution ($\\propto(1+z)^{2.07}$) of the mass scaling\nrelation between supermassive black holes and their host galaxies is required.\nIn this case, we find that the detection probability of individual BBHs is\n$\\sim85\\%$ or 64% if using a period of 3.4-year CPTA observation data, with an\nexpectation of $\\sim1.9$ or 1.0 BBHs detectable with a signal-to-noise ratio\n$\\geq3$ or $5$, and it is expected to increase to $>95\\%$ if extending the\nobservation period to $5$ years or longer.

In this work, we point a limitation of LLMs' ability to\nperform several sub-tasks within the same context window - an in-context\nhardness of composition, pointing to an advantage for distributing a decomposed\nproblem in a multi-agent system of LLMs. The hardness of composition is\nquantified by a generation complexity metric, i.e., the number of LLM\ngenerations required to sample at least one correct solution.

Although having notably narrowed the accuracy gap with LiDAR,\nthere is still few research effort to explore the reliability in predicting\nsemantic occupancy from camera. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive\nevaluation of existing semantic occupancy prediction models from a reliability\nperspective for the first time. Despite the gradual alignment of camera-based\nmodels with LiDAR in term of accuracy, a significant reliability gap persists.\nTo addresses this concern, we propose ReliOcc, a method designed to enhance the\nreliability of camera-based occupancy networks. ReliOcc provides a\nplug-and-play scheme for existing models, which integrates hybrid uncertainty\nfrom individual voxels with sampling-based noise and relative voxels through\nmix-up learning. Besides, an uncertainty-aware calibration strategy is devised\nto further enhance model reliability in offline mode. Extensive experiments\nunder various settings demonstrate that ReliOcc significantly enhances model\nreliability while maintaining the accuracy of both geometric and semantic\npredictions.

Reference 1 showed that a phenomenological model of\nsuperconducting loop neurons eliminates the need to solve the Josephson circuit\nequations that describe synapses and dendrites. The initial goal of the model\nwas to decrease the time required for simulations, yet an additional benefit of\nthe model was increased transparency of the underlying neural circuit\noperations and conceptual clarity regarding the connection of loop neurons to\nother physical systems. Whereas the original model simplified the treatment of\nthe Josephson-junction dynamics, essentially by only considering low-pass\nversions of the dendritic outputs, the model resorted to an awkward treatment\nof spikes generated by semiconductor transmitter circuits that required\nexplicitly checking for threshold crossings and distinct treatment of time\nsteps wherein somatic threshold is reached. Here we extend that model to\nsimplify the treatment of spikes coming from somas, again making use of the\nfact that in neural systems the downstream recipients of spike events almost\nalways perform low-pass filtering. We provide comparisons between the first and\nsecond phenomenological models, quantifying the accuracy of the additional\napproximations. We identify regions of circuit parameter space in which the\nextended model works well and regions where it works poorly. For some circuit\nparameters it is possible to represent the downstream dendritic response to a\nsingle spike as well as coincidences or sequences of spikes, indicating the\nmodel is not simply a reduction to rate coding.

Specifically, we introduce a learnable cell attribution to\nthe node-edge message passing process, which better captures the spatial\ndependency of regional features. Such a strategy essentially upgrades the local\naggregation scheme from the first order (e.g., from edge to node) to a higher\norder (e.g., from volume to edge and then to node), which takes advantage of\nvolumetric information in message passing. Meanwhile, a novel feature-enhanced\nblock is designed to further improve the performance of CeGNN and relieve the\nover-smoothness problem, via treating the latent features as basis functions.\nThe extensive experiments on various PDE systems and one real-world dataset\ndemonstrate that CeGNN achieves superior performance compared with other\nbaseline models, particularly reducing the prediction error with up to 1 orders\nof magnitude on several PDE systems.",

This modification, called Sustainability Augmented Reranking (SAR),\nensures the system's recommendations align with sustainability goals.\nEvaluations using popular open-source LLMs, such as Llama-3.1-Instruct-8B and\nMistral-Instruct-7B, demonstrate that the SAR-enhanced approach consistently\nmatches or outperforms the baseline (without SAR) across most metrics,\nhighlighting the benefits of incorporating sustainability into TRS.",

For a given $\\delta>0$, the algorithm finds the largest cover of $I$\nsuch that all sets in the cover are separated by at least distance $\\delta$. We\ncall the sets in the cover the $\\delta$-connected components of I. The grouping\nrelies on an iterative procedure involving morphological dilations with\nHamilton-Jacobi-Bellman kernels on $G$ and notions of $\\delta$-thickened sets.\nWe prove that the algorithm converges in finitely many iteration steps, and we\npropose a strategy to find an optimal value for $\\delta$ based on persistence\nhomology arguments. We also introduce the concept of affinity matrices. This\nallows for grouping of $\\delta$-connected components based on their local\nproximity and alignment.\n  Among the many different applications of the algorithm, in this article, we\nfocus on illustrating that the method can efficiently identify (possibly\noverlapping) branches in complex vascular trees on retinal images. This is done\nby applying an orientation score transform to the images that allows us to view\nthem as functions from $\\mathbb{L}_2(G)$ where $G=SE(2)$, the Lie group of\nroto-translations. By applying our algorithm in this Lie group, we illustrate\nthat we obtain $\\delta$-connected components that differentiate between\ncrossing structures and that group well-aligned, nearby structures. This\ncontrasts standard connected component algorithms in $\\mathbb{R}^2$.",

    "abstract": "Resolved studies of the correlation between the radio and far-infrared (FIR)\nemission from galaxies at different frequencies can unveil the interplay\nbetween star formation and relativistic interstellar medium (ISM). Thanks to\nthe LOFAR LoTSS observations combined with the VLA, Herschel, and WISE data, we\nstudy the role of the cosmic rays and magnetic fields in the radio-FIR\ncorrelation on scales of ~> 200 pc in the nearby galaxy IC342. The thermal\nemission traced by the 22 micron emission, constitutes about 6%, 13%, and 30%\nof the observed radio emission at 0.14, 1.4, 4.8 GHz, respectively, in star\nforming regions and less in other parts. The nonthermal spectral index becomes\nflatter at frequencies lower than 1.4 GHz (a=-0.51 +- 0.09, S(nu)~ nu^(a)) than\nbetween 1.4 and 4.8 GHz (a = -1.06+- 0.19) on average and this flattening\noccurs not only in star-forming regions but also in diffuse ISM. The radio-FIR\ncorrelation holds at all radio frequencies; however, it is tighter at higher\nradio frequencies. A multi-scale analysis shows that this correlation cannot be\nmaintained on small scales due to diffusion of cosmic ray electrons (CREs). The\ncorrelation breaks on a larger scale (320 pc) at 0.14 GHz than at 1.4 GHz (200\npc) indicating that those CREs traced at lower frequencies have diffused a\nlonger path in the ISM. We find that the energy index of CREs becomes flatter\nin star forming regions in agreement with previous studies. Cooling of CREs due\nto the magnetic field is evident globally only after compensating for the\neffect of star formation activity which both accelerate CREs and amplify\nmagnetic fields. Compared with other nearby galaxies, it is shown that the\nsmallest scale of the radio-FIR correlation is proportional to the CREs\npropagation length on which the ordered magnetic field has an important effect.",

Without a focusing lens, lensless\ncameras rely on computational algorithms to recover the scenes from multiplexed\nmeasurements. However, current algorithms struggle with inaccurate forward\nimaging models and insufficient priors to reconstruct high-quality images. To\novercome these limitations, we introduce a novel two-stage approach for\nconsistent and photorealistic lensless image reconstruction. The first stage of\nour approach ensures data consistency by focusing on accurately reconstructing\nthe low-frequency content with a spatially varying deconvolution method that\nadjusts to changes in the Point Spread Function (PSF) across the camera's field\nof view. The second stage enhances photorealism by incorporating a generative\nprior from pre-trained diffusion models. By conditioning on the low-frequency\ncontent retrieved in the first stage, the diffusion model effectively\nreconstructs the high-frequency details that are typically lost in the lensless\nimaging process, while also maintaining image fidelity. Our method achieves a\nsuperior balance between data fidelity and visual quality compared to existing\nmethods, as demonstrated with two popular lensless systems, PhlatCam and\nDiffuserCam.

    "abstract": "The stark contrast in the design philosophy of an event camera makes it\nparticularly ideal for operating under high-speed, high dynamic range and\nlow-light conditions, where standard cameras underperform. Nonetheless, event\ncameras still suffer from some amount of motion blur, especially under these\nchallenging conditions, in contrary to what most think. This is attributed to\nthe limited bandwidth of the event sensor pixel, which is mostly proportional\nto the light intensity. Thus, to ensure that event cameras can truly excel in\nsuch conditions where it has an edge over standard cameras, it is crucial to\naccount for event motion blur in downstream applications, especially\nreconstruction. However, none of the recent works on reconstructing Neural\nRadiance Fields (NeRFs) from events, nor event simulators, have considered the\nfull effects of event motion blur. To this end, we propose, Deblur e-NeRF, a\nnovel method to directly and effectively reconstruct blur-minimal NeRFs from\nmotion-blurred events generated under high-speed motion or low-light\nconditions. The core component of this work is a physically-accurate pixel\nbandwidth model proposed to account for event motion blur under arbitrary speed\nand lighting conditions. We also introduce a novel threshold-normalized total\nvariation loss to improve the regularization of large textureless patches.\nExperiments on real and novel realistically simulated sequences verify our\neffectiveness. Our code, event simulator and synthetic event dataset will be\nopen-sourced.",

    "abstract": "Semantic communications (SC) is an emerging communication paradigm in which\nwireless devices can send only relevant information from a source of data while\nrelying on computing resources to regenerate missing data points. However, the\ndesign of a multi-user SC system becomes more challenging because of the\ncomputing and communication overhead required for coordination. Existing\nsolutions for learning the semantic language and performing resource allocation\noften fail to capture the computing and communication tradeoffs involved in\nmultiuser SC. To address this gap, a novel framework for decentralized\ncomputing and communication resource allocation in multiuser SC systems is\nproposed. The challenge of efficiently allocating communication and computing\nresources (for reasoning) in a decentralized manner to maximize the quality of\ntask experience for the end users is addressed through the application of\nStackelberg hyper game theory. Leveraging the concept of second-level hyper\ngames, novel analytical formulations are developed to model misperceptions of\nthe users about each other's communication and control strategies. Further,\nequilibrium analysis of the learned resource allocation protocols examines the\nconvergence of the computing and communication strategies to a local\nStackelberg equilibria, considering misperceptions. Simulation results show\nthat the proposed Stackelberg hyper game results in efficient usage of\ncommunication and computing resources while maintaining a high quality of\nexperience for the users compared to state-of-the-art that does not account for\nthe misperceptions.",

The prompt emission of GRB 240529A shows\ntwo comparable energetic episodes separated by a quiescence time of roughly 400\ns. Combining all available data on the GRB Coordinates Network, we reveal the\nsimultaneous apparent X-ray plateau and optical re-brightening around\n$10^3-10^4$ s after the burst. Rather than the energy injection from the\nmagnetar as widely invoked for similar GRBs, the multi-wavelength emissions\ncould be better explained as two shocks launched from the central engine\nseparately. The optical peak time and our numerical modeling suggest that the\ninitial bulk Lorentz factor of the later shock is roughly 50, which indicates\nthat the later jet should be accretion-driven and have a higher mass loading\nthan a typical one. The quiescence time between the two prompt emission\nepisodes may be caused by the transition between different accretion states of\na central magnetar or black hole, or the fall-back accretion process.

This forward model enables us to\ncompare explicit and implicit full-field inference with and without gradient.\nThe former is achieved by sampling the forward model through the No U-Turns\nsampler. The latter starts by compressing the data into sufficient statistics\nand uses the Neural Likelihood Estimation algorithm and the one augmented with\ngradient. We perform a full-field analysis on LSST Y10 like weak lensing\nsimulated mass maps. We show that explicit and implicit full-field inference\nyield consistent constraints. Explicit inference requires 630 000 simulations\nwith our particular sampler corresponding to 400 independent samples. Implicit\ninference requires a maximum of 101 000 simulations split into 100 000\nsimulations to build sufficient statistics (this number is not fine tuned) and\n1 000 simulations to perform inference. Additionally, we show that our way of\nexploiting the gradients does not significantly help implicit inference.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a method for improving the accuracy of mastitis risk\nassessment in cows using neural networks and video analysis. Mastitis, an\ninfection of the udder tissue, is a critical health problem for cows and can be\ndetected by examining the cow's teat. Traditionally, veterinarians assess the\nhealth of a cow's teat during the milking process, but this process is limited\nin time and can weaken the accuracy of the assessment. In commercial farms,\ncows are recorded by cameras when they are milked in the milking parlor. This\npaper uses a neural network to identify key frames in the recorded video where\nthe cow's udder appears intact. These key frames allow veterinarians to have\nmore flexible time to perform health assessments on the teat, increasing their\nefficiency and accuracy. However, there are challenges in using cow teat video\nfor mastitis risk assessment, such as complex environments, changing cow\npositions and postures, and difficulty in identifying the udder from the video.\nTo address these challenges, a fusion distance and an ensemble model are\nproposed to improve the performance (F-score) of identifying key frames from\ncow teat videos. The results show that these two approaches improve performance\ncompared to using a single distance measure or model.",

A large spin Hall\neffect is observed in materials with strong spin orbit coupling, e.g., Pt.\nRecent research suggests the existence of an orbital Hall effect, the orbital\nanalogue to the spin Hall effect, which also arises in weakly spin orbit\ncoupled materials like Ti, Mn or Cr. In Pt both effects are predicted to\ncoexist. In any of these materials, a magnetic field perpendicular to the spin\nor orbital accumulation leads to additional Hanle dephasing and thereby the\nHanle magnetoresistance (MR). To reveal the MR behavior of a material with both\nspin and orbital Hall effect, we thus study the MR of Pt thin films over a wide\nrange of thicknesses. Careful evaluation shows that the MR of our textured\nsamples is dominated by the ordinary MR rather than by the Hanle effect. We\nanalyze the intrinsic properties of Pt films deposited by different groups and\nshow that next to the resistivity also the structural properties of the film\ninfluence which MR dominates. We further show that this correlation can be\nfound in both spin Hall active materials like Pt and orbital Hall active\nmaterials, like Ti. For both materials, the crystalline samples shows a MR\nattributed to the ordinary MR, whereas we find a large Hanle MR for the samples\nwithout apparent structural order. We then provide a set of rules to\ndistinguish between the ordinary and the Hanle MR.

To address these issues,\nthe paper proposes a method to enhance knowledge learning during language model\npretraining, by enhancing elusive but important clues in text discovered by the\nlanguage model themselves. We found that larger language models pay more\nattention to non-obvious but important clues, which are often overlooked by\nsmaller language models.

We show that if the\ncorrelation matrix is known with an error $\\varepsilon$, the trace-distance\nerror also scales as $\\varepsilon$ (and vice versa). Specifically, we provide\ndistance bounds between (both pure and mixed) free-fermionic states in relation\nto their correlation matrix distance.

Importantly, we leverage our preceding\nresults to derive significant advancements in property testing and tomography\nof free-fermionic states. Property testing involves determining whether an\nunknown state is close to or far from being a free-fermionic state. We first\ndemonstrate that any algorithm capable of testing arbitrary (possibly mixed)\nfree-fermionic states would inevitably be inefficient.

However, this kind of\nbackdoor attack is limited since they require significant computational\nresources, especially as the size of LLMs increases. Besides,\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) offers an alternative but the restricted\nparameter updating may impede the alignment of triggers with target labels. In\nthis study, we first verify that backdoor attacks with PEFT may encounter\nchallenges in achieving feasible performance. To address these issues and\nimprove the effectiveness of backdoor attacks with PEFT, we propose a novel\nbackdoor attack algorithm from the weak-to-strong based on Feature\nAlignment-enhanced Knowledge Distillation (FAKD). Specifically, we poison\nsmall-scale language models through FPFT to serve as the teacher model. The\nteacher model then covertly transfers the backdoor to the large-scale student\nmodel through FAKD, which employs PEFT. Theoretical analysis reveals that FAKD\nhas the potential to augment the effectiveness of backdoor attacks. We\ndemonstrate the superior performance of FAKD on classification tasks across\nfour language models, four backdoor attack algorithms, and two different\narchitectures of teacher models. Experimental results indicate success rates\nclose to 100% for backdoor attacks targeting PEFT.",

This\ninnovative design introduces unique features to traffic flow, allowing multiple\nmodules to seamlessly join together and operate collectively. To understand the\ntraffic flow characteristics involving these vehicles and their collective\noperations, this study established a modeling framework specifically designed\nto simulate their behavior within traffic flow. The mixed traffic flow,\nincorporating arbitrarily formed trains of various modular sizes, is modeled\nand studied. Simulations are conducted under varying levels of traffic demand\nand penetration rates to examine the traffic flow dynamics in the presence of\nthese vehicles and their operations. The microscopic trajectories, MAV train\ncompositions, and macroscopic fundamental diagrams of the mixed traffic flow\nare analyzed. The simulation findings indicate that integrating MAVs and their\ncollective operations can substantially enhance capacity, with the extent of\nimprovement depending on the penetration rate in mixed traffic flow. Notably,\nthe capacity nearly doubles when the penetration rate exceeds 75%. Furthermore,\ntheir presence significantly influences and regulates the free-flow speed of\nthe mixed traffic. Particularly, when variations in operational speed limits\nexist between the MAVs and the background traffic, the mixed traffic adjusts to\nthe operating velocity of these vehicles. This study provides insights into\npotential future traffic flow systems incorporating emerging MAV technologies.",

A challenge for nonconvex trajectory\noptimization methods, such as sequential convex programming, is to find an\neffective warm-starting point to approximate the nonconvex optimization with a\nsequence of convex ones. We introduce a first-order method with filter-based\nwarm-starting for nonconvex trajectory optimization. The idea is to first\ngenerate sampled trajectories using constraint-aware particle filtering, which\nsolves the problem as an estimation problem. We then identify different locally\noptimal trajectories through agglomerative hierarchical clustering. Finally, we\nchoose the best locally optimal trajectory to warm-start the prox-linear\nmethod, a first-order method with guaranteed convergence. We demonstrate the\nproposed method on a multi-agent trajectory optimization problem with linear\ndynamics and nonconvex collision avoidance.

    "abstract": "Over the past decades, near-Earth spacecraft observations have provided\ninsights into the physics of the bow shock, suggesting that solar wind\nintrinsic turbulence influences the bow shock dynamics. On the other hand,\ntheoretical studies, based on global numerical simulations, have not yet\ninvestigated the global 3D interaction between a turbulent solar wind and a\nplanetary magnetosphere. This paper addresses this gap for the first time by\ninvestigating the global dynamics of this interaction, providing new\nperspectives on the underlying physical processes. We examine how the turbulent\nnature of the solar wind influences the 3D structure and dynamics of magnetized\nplanetary environments or magnetized Earth-like exoplanets, using the newly\ndeveloped numerical code Menura. We use the hybrid PIC model Menura to conduct\n3D simulations of the turbulent solar wind and its interaction with an\nEarth-like magnetized planet through global numerical simulations of the\nmagnetosphere and its surroundings. We show that solar wind turbulence globally\ninfluences the shape and dynamics of the bow shock, the magnetosheath\nstructures, and the ion foreshock dynamics. We show that a turbulent solar wind\ndisrupts the coherence of foreshock fluctuations, induces large fluctuations on\nthe quasi-perpendicular surface of the bow shock, facilitates the formation of\nbubble-like structures near the bow shock's nose, and modifies the properties\nof the magnetosheath region. None of these phenomena occur when comparing with\nthe case in which the solar wind is laminar. The turbulent nature of the solar\nwind impacts the 3D shape and dynamics of the bow shock, magnetosheath, and ion\nforeshock region. This influence should be considered when studying solar\nwind-planet interactions in observations and simulations. We discuss the\nrelevance of our findings for current and future missions launched into the\nheliosphere.",

    "abstract": "Image manipulation detection and localization have received considerable\nattention from the research community given the blooming of Generative Models\n(GMs). Detection methods that follow a passive approach may overfit to specific\nGMs, limiting their application in real-world scenarios, due to the growing\ndiversity of generative models. Recently, approaches based on a proactive\nframework have shown the possibility of dealing with this limitation. However,\nthese methods suffer from two main limitations, which raises concerns about\npotential vulnerabilities: i) the manipulation detector is not robust to noise\nand hence can be easily fooled; ii) the fact that they rely on fixed\nperturbations for image protection offers a predictable exploit for malicious\nattackers, enabling them to reverse-engineer and evade detection. To overcome\nthis issue we propose PADL, a new solution able to generate image-specific\nperturbations using a symmetric scheme of encoding and decoding based on\ncross-attention, which drastically reduces the possibility of reverse\nengineering, even when evaluated with adaptive attack [31]. Additionally, PADL\nis able to pinpoint manipulated areas, facilitating the identification of\nspecific regions that have undergone alterations, and has more generalization\npower than prior art on held-out generative models. Indeed, although being\ntrained only on an attribute manipulation GAN model [15], our method\ngeneralizes to a range of unseen models with diverse architectural designs,\nsuch as StarGANv2, BlendGAN, DiffAE, StableDiffusion and StableDiffusionXL.\nAdditionally, we introduce a novel evaluation protocol, which offers a fair\nevaluation of localisation performance in function of detection accuracy and\nbetter captures real-world scenarios.",

In order to perform a\ntranslation using a CAT tool, a translator uses the TM to gather translations\nsimilar to the desired segment to translate (s'). Many CAT tools offer a\nfuzzy-match algorithm to locate segments (s) in the TM that are close in\ndistance to s'. After locating two similar segments, the CAT tool will present\nparallel segments (s, t) that contain one segment in the source language along\nwith its translation in the target language. Additionally, CAT tools contain\nfuzzy-match repair (FMR) techniques that will automatically use the parallel\nsegments from the TM to create new TM entries containing a modified version of\nthe original with the idea in mind that it will be the translation of s'. Most\nFMR techniques use machine translation as a way of \"repairing\" those words that\nhave to be modified. In this article, we show that for a large part of those\nwords which are anchored, we can use other techniques that are based on machine\nlearning approaches such as Word2Vec. BERT, and even ChatGPT.

    "abstract": "Mechanical metamaterials utilize geometry to achieve exceptional mechanical\nproperties, including those not typically possible for traditional materials.\nTo achieve these properties, it is necessary to identify the proper structures\nand geometries, which is often a non-trivial and computationally expensive\nprocess. Here, we propose a Substructure Perturbation Method (SSPM) for\nsystematic design and search of these materials with programmed deformation\nmodes. We present the theoretical fundamentals and computational algorithms of\nthe SSPM, along with four design problems to investigate the effect and\nperformance of the SSPM. Results reveal the necessity of analyzing multiple\nsubstructures simultaneously in obtaining successful designs, and its\neffectiveness in speeding up numerical processes. In one design case, SSPM is\nshown to be effectively two orders of magnitude faster than another\nstate-of-art approach while using less computational resources. We also show an\nexperimental validation where the fabricated prototypes can grasp objects\nrespectively by undergoing programmed deformations under corresponding inputs.\nThe proposed SSPM provides new fundamentals and strategies for the design of\nmechanical metamaterials with advanced functionalities.",

    "abstract": "Codesign, an integral part of computer architecture referring to the\ninformation interaction in hardware-software stack, is able to boost the\nalgorithm mapping and execution in the computer hardware. This well applies to\nthe noisy intermediate-scale quantum era, where quantum algorithms and quantum\nprocessors both need to be shaped to allow for advantages in experimental\nimplementations. The state-of-the-art quantum adiabatic optimization algorithm\nfaces challenges for scaling up, where the deteriorating optimization\nperformance is not necessarily alleviated by increasing the circuit depth given\nthe noise in the hardware. The counterdiabatic term can be introduced to\naccelerate the convergence, but decomposing the unitary operator corresponding\nto the counterdiabatic terms into one and two-qubit gates may add additional\nburden to the digital circuit depth. In this work, we focus on the\ncounterdiabatic protocol with a codesigned approach to implement this algorithm\non a photonic quantum processor. The tunable Mach-Zehnder interferometer mesh\nprovides rich programmable parameters for local and global manipulation, making\nit able to perform arbitrary unitary evolutions. Accordingly, we directly\nimplement the unitary operation associated to the counterdiabatic quantum\noptimization on our processor without prior digitization. Furthermore, we\ndevelop and implement an optimized counterdiabatic method by tackling the\nhigher-order many-body interaction terms. Moreover, we benchmark the\nperformance in the case of factorization, by comparing the final success\nprobability and the convergence speed. In conclusion, we experimentally\ndemonstrate the advantages of a codesigned mapping of counterdiabatic quantum\ndynamics for quantum computing on photonic platforms.",

In order to reduce these\nconcerns, novel strategies for developing prediction models and optimization of\nflight planning, for instance through deep reinforcement learning (DRL), are\nneeded. Our goal is to develop DRL algorithms capable of enabling the\nautonomous navigation of UAVs in urban environments, taking into account the\npresence of buildings and other UAVs, optimizing the trajectories in order to\nreduce both energetic consumption and noise. This is achieved using fluid-flow\nsimulations which represent the environment in which UAVs navigate and training\nthe UAV as an agent interacting with an urban environment. In this work, we\nconsider a domain domain represented by a two-dimensional flow field with\nobstacles, ideally representing buildings, extracted from a three-dimensional\nhigh-fidelity numerical simulation. The presented methodology, using PPO+LSTM\ncells, was validated by reproducing a simple but fundamental problem in\nnavigation, namely the Zermelo's problem, which deals with a vessel navigating\nin a turbulent flow, travelling from a starting point to a target location,\noptimizing the trajectory. The current method shows a significant improvement\nwith respect to both a simple PPO and a TD3 algorithm, with a success rate (SR)\nof the PPO+LSTM trained policy of 98.7%, and a crash rate (CR) of 0.1%,\noutperforming both PPO (SR = 75.6%, CR=18.6%) and TD3 (SR=77.4% and CR=14.5%).\nThis is the first step towards DRL strategies which will guide UAVs in a\nthree-dimensional flow field using real-time signals, making the navigation\nefficient in terms of flight time and avoiding damages to the vehicle.",

    "abstract": "While style transfer techniques have been well-developed for 2D image\nstylization, the extension of these methods to 3D scenes remains relatively\nunexplored. Existing approaches demonstrate proficiency in transferring colors\nand textures but often struggle with replicating the geometry of the scenes. In\nour work, we leverage an explicit Gaussian Splatting (GS) representation and\ndirectly match the distributions of Gaussians between style and content scenes\nusing the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD). By employing the entropy-regularized\nWasserstein-2 distance, we ensure that the transformation maintains spatial\nsmoothness. Additionally, we decompose the scene stylization problem into\nsmaller chunks to enhance efficiency. This paradigm shift reframes stylization\nfrom a pure generative process driven by latent space losses to an explicit\nmatching of distributions between two Gaussian representations. Our method\nachieves high-resolution 3D stylization by faithfully transferring details from\n3D style scenes onto the content scene. Furthermore, WaSt-3D consistently\ndelivers results across diverse content and style scenes without necessitating\nany training, as it relies solely on optimization-based techniques.

The suggested approach aims to estimate the\nrequired data for sharing between units in line with as much communication\nreduction as possible. In other words, the proposed approach effectively\ndetermines which state variables should be shared (observer concept) among the\nunits during specific time intervals (event-triggered concept). This strategy\nsignificantly reduces the overall communication load. It is shown that the\nestimation error remains bounded and Zeno behavior, characterized by an endless\nnumber of transmissions occurring within a limited time frame, does not occur.\nThe proposed methodology can be systematically applied to any\ncommunication-based secondary controller in alternating current (AC)\nmicrogrids. Simulation results demonstrate a high degree of precision in\nestimating the states under the proposed approach.

As customary, Hermitian positive-definite (HPD)\nmatrices are used to model the observational sample data, and the clutter\ncovariance matrix of received dataset is estimated as geometric mean of the\nsecondary HPD matrices. Given a set of training HPD matrices with class labels,\nthat are elements of a higher-dimensional HPD matrix manifold, the LDA manifold\nprojection learns a mapping from the higher-dimensional HPD matrix manifold to\na lower-dimensional one subject to maximum discrimination. In the current\nstudy, the LDA manifold projection, with the cost function maximizing\nbetween-class distance while minimizing within-class distance, is formulated as\nan optimization problem in the Stiefel manifold.

The vehicle Re-ID task faces an important challenge,\nwhich is the high similarity between different vehicles. Existing methods use\nadditional detection or segmentation models to extract differentiated local\nfeatures. However, these methods either rely on additional annotations or\ngreatly increase the computational cost. Using attention mechanism to capture\nglobal and local features is crucial to solve the challenge of high similarity\nbetween classes in vehicle Re-ID tasks.

Specifically, the large kernel attention (LKA) utilizes\nthe advantages of self-attention and also benefits from the advantages of\nconvolution, which can extract the global and local features of the vehicle\nmore comprehensively. We also introduce hybrid channel attention (HCA) combines\nchannel attention with spatial information, so that the model can better focus\non channels and feature regions, and ignore background and other disturbing\ninformation.

The AMMORE dataset enables various potential analyses and provides an\nimportant resource for researching student math acquisition in understudied,\nreal-world, educational contexts. In experiment 1 we use a variety of\nLLM-driven approaches, including zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought\nprompting, to grade the 1% of student answers that a rule-based classifier\nfails to grade accurately. We find that the best-performing approach --\nchain-of-thought prompting -- accurately scored 92% of these edge cases,\neffectively boosting the overall accuracy of the grading from 98.7% to 99.9%.\nIn experiment 2, we aim to better understand the consequential validity of the\nimproved grading accuracy, by passing grades generated by the best-performing\nLLM-based approach to a Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) model, which estimated\nstudent mastery of specific lessons. We find that relatively modest\nimprovements in model accuracy at the individual question level can lead to\nsignificant changes in the estimation of student mastery. Where the rules-based\nclassifier currently used to grade student, answers misclassified the mastery\nstatus of 6.9% of students across their completed lessons, using the LLM\nchain-of-thought approach this misclassification rate was reduced to 2.6% of\nstudents.

    "abstract": "Emotion recognition from speech and music shares similarities due to their\nacoustic overlap, which has led to interest in transferring knowledge between\nthese domains. However, the shared acoustic cues between speech and music,\nparticularly those encoded by Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) models, remain\nlargely unexplored, given the fact that SSL models for speech and music have\nrarely been applied in cross-domain research. In this work, we revisit the\nacoustic similarity between emotion speech and music, starting with an analysis\nof the layerwise behavior of SSL models for Speech Emotion Recognition (SER)\nand Music Emotion Recognition (MER). Furthermore, we perform cross-domain\nadaptation by comparing several approaches in a two-stage fine-tuning process,\nexamining effective ways to utilize music for SER and speech for MER. Lastly,\nwe explore the acoustic similarities between emotional speech and music using\nFrechet audio distance for individual emotions, uncovering the issue of emotion\nbias in both speech and music SSL models. Our findings reveal that while speech\nand music SSL models do capture shared acoustic features, their behaviors can\nvary depending on different emotions due to their training strategies and\ndomain-specificities. Additionally, parameter-efficient fine-tuning can enhance\nSER and MER performance by leveraging knowledge from each other. This study\nprovides new insights into the acoustic similarity between emotional speech and\nmusic, and highlights the potential for cross-domain generalization to improve\nSER and MER systems.",

Considering the power load forecasting\nproblem involves not only dynamic factors like historical load variations but\nalso static factors such as climate conditions that remain constant over\nspecific periods. From the model-agnostic perspective, this paper proposes a\nparallel structure network to extract important information from both dynamic\nand static data. Firstly, based on complexity learning theory, it is\ndemonstrated that models integrated through parallel structures exhibit\nsuperior generalization abilities compared to individual base learners.\nAdditionally, the higher the independence between base learners, the stronger\nthe generalization ability of the parallel structure model. This suggests that\nthe structure of machine learning models inherently contains significant\ninformation. Building on this theoretical foundation, a parallel convolutional\nneural network (CNN)-gate recurrent unit (GRU) attention model (PCGA) is\nemployed to address the power load forecasting issue, aiming to effectively\nintegrate the influences of dynamic and static features. The CNN module is\nresponsible for capturing spatial characteristics from static data, while the\nGRU module captures long-term dependencies in dynamic time series data. The\nattention layer is designed to focus on key information from the\nspatial-temporal features extracted by the parallel CNN-GRU.

This relationship underscores the\nimportance of fostering positive emotional environments to enhance productivity\nand code craftsmanship. Conversely, the analysis reveals that negative\nsentiments correlate with an uptick in code issues, particularly increased\nduplication and heightened security risks, pointing to the detrimental effects\nof adverse emotional conditions on project health.",

    "abstract": "Discontinuous reception (DRX) is a key technology for reducing the energy\nconsumption of industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) devices. Specifically, DRX\nallows the devices to operate in a low-power mode when no data reception is\nscheduled, and its effectiveness depends on the proper configuration of the DRX\nparameters. In this paper, we characterize the DRX process departing from a\nsemi-Markov chain modeling. We detail two ways to set DRX parameters to\nminimize the device power consumption while meeting a mean delay constraint.\nThe first method exhaustively searches for the optimal configuration. In\ncontrast, the second method uses a low-complexity metaheuristic to find a\nsub-optimal configuration, thus considering ideal and practical DRX\nconfigurations. Notably, within the DRX parameters, the inactivity timer (IT)\nis a caution time that specifies how long a device remains active after the\nlast information exchange. Traditionally, a device implementing DRX will\nrestart the IT after each data reception as a precedent to a low-power mode.\nThe usual approach lies in restarting the IT whenever new data is received\nduring this cautious period, which might sometimes needlessly extend the active\ntime. Herein, we propose a more efficient method in which the transmit base\nstation (BS) explicitly indicates restarting the timer through the control\nchannel only when appropriate. The decision is taken based on the BS's\nknowledge about its buffer status. We consider Poisson and bursty traffic\nmodels, which are typical in IIoT setups, and verify the suitability of our\nproposal for reducing the energy consumption of the devices without\nsignificantly compromising the communication latency through extensive\nnumerical simulations. Specifically, energy-saving gains of up to 30% can be\nobtained regardless of the arrival rate and delay constraints.",

The\nprevailing methods adopt tile-based manners by merging numerous patches, which\nlacks efficiency and produces inconsistency. Besides, prior arts suffer from\nfuzzy depth boundaries and limited generalizability. Analyzing the fundamental\nreasons for these limitations, we model depth refinement as a noisy Poisson\nfusion problem with local inconsistency and edge deformation noises. We propose\nthe Self-distilled Depth Refinement (SDDR) framework to enforce robustness\nagainst the noises, which mainly consists of depth edge representation and\nedge-based guidance. With noisy depth predictions as input, SDDR generates\nlow-noise depth edge representations as pseudo-labels by coarse-to-fine\nself-distillation. Edge-based guidance with edge-guided gradient loss and\nedge-based fusion loss serves as the optimization objective equivalent to\nPoisson fusion. When depth maps are better refined, the labels also become more\nnoise-free. Our model can acquire strong robustness to the noises, achieving\nsignificant improvements in accuracy, edge quality, efficiency, and\ngeneralizability on five different benchmarks. Moreover, directly training\nanother model with edge labels produced by SDDR brings improvements, suggesting\nthat our method could help with training robust refinement models in future\nworks.",

We show that the eikonal and WQFT methods are equivalent and that\ncalculations can be translated freely between them.\n  Concretely, we focus on 2-into-2 scattering processes mediated by massless\nforce carriers. On the one hand, taking the classical limit of the QFT\nscattering amplitude leads to the eikonal method. On the other hand, since in\nthe classical limit the scattering particles are almost on-shell throughout the\nscattering process, the worldline, a first quantized formalism, is the most\nefficient framework to study the scattering amplitude. This is an alternate but\nequivalent formalism to the quantum field theoretic (QFT) framework. By taking\nthe classical limit of the scattering amplitude computed in the worldline, we\ncan derive the WQFT rules of Mogull, Plefka and Steinhoff. In WQFT, the Feynman\ndiagrams are reorganized into a new set of diagrams that facilitate the $\\hbar$\nexpansion. Unlike the QFT eikonal method, which works recursively in\nidentifying the eikonal phase, the worldline-based computation allows to target\nand systematically extract the classical contributions directly through a\nspecific set of WQFT diagrams. In worldline formalism the perturbative\nexpansion of the scattering amplitude is naturally organized in diagrams which\nfactorize (reducible) and diagrams which are new to that order (irreducible),\nin a one-to-one map with the structure of the amplitude in the eikonal method.\nThis opened up the possibility to investigate and prove the conjectured\nexponentiation of the eikonal phase in arXiv: 2409.12895.",

    "abstract": "Most recommender systems adopt collaborative filtering (CF) and provide\nrecommendations based on past collective interactions. Therefore, the\nperformance of CF algorithms degrades when few or no interactions are\navailable, a scenario referred to as cold-start. To address this issue,\nprevious work relies on models leveraging both collaborative data and side\ninformation on the users or items. Similar to multimodal learning, these models\naim at combining collaborative and content representations in a shared\nembedding space. In this work we propose a novel technique for multimodal\nrecommendation, relying on a multimodal Single-Branch embedding network for\nRecommendation (SiBraR). Leveraging weight-sharing, SiBraR encodes interaction\ndata as well as multimodal side information using the same single-branch\nembedding network on different modalities. This makes SiBraR effective in\nscenarios of missing modality, including cold start. Our extensive experiments\non large-scale recommendation datasets from three different recommendation\ndomains (music, movie, and e-commerce) and providing multimodal content\ninformation (audio, text, image, labels, and interactions) show that SiBraR\nsignificantly outperforms CF as well as state-of-the-art content-based RSs in\ncold-start scenarios, and is competitive in warm scenarios. We show that\nSiBraR's recommendations are accurate in missing modality scenarios, and that\nthe model is able to map different modalities to the same region of the shared\nembedding space, hence reducing the modality gap.",

In this work, it is shown that if the medium\neffects are incorporated through a density-dependent Bag pressure in the Grand\nCanonical ensemble, then the Euler relation is violated. If Euler relation is\nused then the minimum of energy per baryon does not occur at zero pressure. In\norder to overcome this inconsistency, we propose the medium effect of the\nstrange quark matter in the form of chemical potential dependent Bag pressure\nin the grand Canonical ensemble. The density dependent Bag pressure which has\nbeen used in Grand Canonical ensemble so far can however be used in Canonical\nensemble without violating the laws of thermodynamics. These prescriptions will\nobey the Euler relation as well as the minimum energy per baryon will coincide\nwith the zero of pressure and hence can be considered to be self consistent.\nThese equations of state in the Grand Canonical ensemble can be further used to\nconstruct the Mass-Radius and other structural properties of the strange quark\nstars as well as hybrid stars.

In order to unravel the underlying mechanism\nfor this unusual dependence, we performed theoretical investigations by\ncombining the density functional theory (DFT) and the unbiased functional\nrenormalization group (FRG). Our DFT calculations show that the Fermi pockets\nare essentially unchanged with increasing pressure (above 14 GPa), but the\nbandwidth is enlarged, and particularly the interlayer hopping integral between\nthe nickel $3d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbitals is enhanced. From the DFT band structure,\nwe construct the bilayer tight-binding model in terms of the nickel\n$3d_{3z^2-r^2}$ and $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals. On this basis, we investigate the\nsuperconductivity induced by correlation effects by FRG calculations. We find\nconsistently $s_\\pm$-wave pairing triggered by spin fluctuations, but the\nlatter are weakened by pressure and lead to a decreasing transition temperature\nversus pressure, in qualitatively agreement with the experiment. We emphasize\nthat the itinerancy of the $d$-orbitals is important and captured naturally in\nour FRG calculations, and we argue that the unusual pressure dependence would\nbe unnatural, if not impossible, in the otherwise local-moment picture of the\nnickel $d$-orbitals. This sheds lights on the pertinent microscopic description\nof, and more importantly the mechanism of superconductivity in\nLa$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$.",

The temporal\nshape of individual pulses is often modelled as 'fast rise exponential decay'\n(FRED). Here, we introduce a novel fitting function to quantify pulse\nasymmetry. We conduct a light curve and a time-resolved spectral analysis on 61\npulses from 22 GRBs detected by the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor. Contrary to\nprevious claims, we find that only $\\sim 50\\%$ of pulse lightcurves in our\nsample show a FRED shape, while about $25\\%$ have a symmetric lightcurve, and\nthe other $25\\%$ have a mixed shape. Furthermore, our analysis reveals a clear\ntrend: in multi-pulse bursts, the initial pulse tends to exhibit the most\nsymmetric light curve, while subsequent pulses become increasingly asymmetric,\nadopting a more FRED-like shape. Additionally, we correlate the temporal and\nspectral shapes of the pulses. By fitting the spectra with the classical \"Band\"\nfunction, we find a moderate positive Spearman correlation index of 0.23\nbetween pulse asymmetry and the low-energy spectral index $\\alpha_{\\max}$ (the\nmaximum value across all time bins covering an individual pulse). Thus, during\nGRB light curves, the pulses tend to get more asymmetric and spectrally softer\nwith time. We interpret this as a transition in the dominant emission mechanism\nfrom photospheric (symmetric-like and hard) to non-thermal emission above the\nphotosphere and show that this interpretation aligns with a GRB jet Lorentz\nfactor of the order of a few 10s in many cases.",

    "abstract": "Recently, a nonlinear stability theory has been developed for wave trains in\nreaction-diffusion systems relying on pure $L^\\infty$-estimates. In the absence\nof localization of perturbations, it exploits diffusive decay caused by\nsmoothing together with spatio-temporal phase modulation. In this paper, we\nadvance this theory beyond the parabolic setting and propose a scheme designed\nfor general dissipative semilinear problems. We present our method in the\ncontext of the FitzHugh-Nagumo system. The lack of parabolicity and\nlocalization complicates mode filtration in $L^\\infty$-spaces using the\nFloquet-Bloch transform. Instead, we employ the inverse Laplace representation\nof the semigroup generated by the linearization to uncover high-frequency\ndamping, while leveraging a novel link to the Floquet-Bloch representation for\nthe smoothing low-frequency part. Another challenge arises in controlling\nregularity in the quasilinear iteration scheme for the modulated perturbation.\nWe address this by extending the method of nonlinear damping estimates to\nnonlocalized perturbations using uniformly local Sobolev norms.",

We identify three\nscaling regimes corresponding to varying task difficulties: hard, easy, and\nsuper easy tasks. For easy and super-easy target functions, which lie in the\nreproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) defined by the initial infinite-width\nNeural Tangent Kernel (NTK), the scaling exponents remain unchanged between\nfeature learning and kernel regime models. For hard tasks, defined as those\noutside the RKHS of the initial NTK, we demonstrate both analytically and\nempirically that feature learning can improve scaling with training time and\ncompute, nearly doubling the exponent for hard tasks. This leads to a different\ncompute optimal strategy to scale parameters and training time in the feature\nlearning regime. We support our finding that feature learning improves the\nscaling law for hard tasks but not for easy and super-easy tasks with\nexperiments of nonlinear MLPs fitting functions with power-law Fourier spectra\non the circle and CNNs learning vision tasks.",

The\nfocus is on the limit of small, practically spherical droplets of several tens\nof micrometers or less. This may occur when the liquid is sprayed over a hot\nsubstrate, or just be a late life stage of an initially large Leidenfrost\ndroplet. A rigorous numerically-assisted analysis is carried out within\nverifiable assumptions such as quasi-stationarities and small\nReynolds/P\\'{e}clet numbers. It is considered that the droplet is surrounded by\nits pure vapor. Simple fitting formulas of our numerical data for the forces\nand evaporation rates are preliminarily obtained, all respecting the asymptotic\nbehaviors (also investigated) in the limits of small and large levitation\nheights. They are subsequently used within a system of ODEs to study the\ndroplet dynamics and take-off (drastic height increase as the droplet\nvaporizes). A previously known quasi-stationary inverse-square root law for the\ndroplet height as a function of its radius (at the root of the take-off) is\nrecovered, although we point out different prefactors in the two limits.\nDeviations of a dynamic nature therefrom are uncovered as the droplet radius\nfurther decreases due to evaporation, improving the agreement with experiment.\nFurthermore, we reveal that, if initially large enough, the droplets vanish at\na universal finite height (just dependent on the superheat and fluid\nproperties).

In this work, we\ndemonstrate the potential of large language models (LLMs) to act as gradient\npriors in a zero-shot setting. We examine the property by considering lossless\ngradient compression -- a critical application in distributed learning -- that\ndepends heavily on precise probability modeling. To achieve this, we introduce\nLM-GC, a novel method that integrates LLMs with arithmetic coding. Our\ntechnique converts plain gradients into text-like formats, enhancing token\nefficiency by up to 38 times compared to their plain representations. We ensure\nthat this data conversion maintains a close alignment with the structure of\nplain gradients and the symbols commonly recognized by LLMs. Our experiments\nindicate that LM-GC surpasses existing state-of-the-art lossless compression\nmethods, improving compression rates by 10% up to 17.2% across various datasets\nand architectures. Additionally, our approach shows promising compatibility\nwith lossy compression techniques such as quantization and sparsification.\nThese findings highlight the significant potential of LLMs as a model for\neffectively handling gradients.

Thus, we explain the\nexperimentally observed trends in term of the combination of disorder and\nstrain governing the process. Finally, and perhaps most amazingly, we\ndemonstrate atomically abrupt $\\alpha$/$\\gamma$ interfaces paradoxically\nself-organized out of the stochastic disorder.",

In this work, we introduce BeanCounter, a public dataset consisting\nof more than 159B tokens extracted from businesses' disclosures. We show that\nthis data is indeed novel: less than 0.1% of BeanCounter appears in Common\nCrawl-based datasets and it is an order of magnitude larger than datasets\nrelying on similar sources. Given the data's provenance, we hypothesize that\nBeanCounter is comparatively more factual and less toxic than web-based\ndatasets. Exploring this hypothesis, we find that many demographic identities\noccur with similar prevalence in BeanCounter but with significantly less toxic\ncontext relative to other datasets. To demonstrate the utility of BeanCounter,\nwe evaluate and compare two LLMs continually pre-trained on BeanCounter with\ntheir base models. We find an 18-33% reduction in toxic generation and improved\nperformance within the finance domain for the continually pretrained models.\nCollectively, our work suggests that BeanCounter is a novel source of\nlow-toxicity and high-quality domain-specific data with sufficient scale to\ntrain multi-billion parameter LLMs.",

However, optimizing the KL\ndivergence can be challenging for the student and often leads to sub-optimal\nsolutions. We further show that gradients induced by KL divergence scale with\nthe magnitude of the teacher logits, thereby diminishing updates on\nlow-probability channels. This imbalance weakens the transfer of inter-class\ninformation and in turn limits the performance improvements achievable by the\nstudent. To mitigate this issue, we propose a plug-and-play auxiliary ranking\nloss based on Kendall's $\\tau$ coefficient that can be seamlessly integrated\ninto any logit-based distillation framework. It supplies inter-class relational\ninformation while rebalancing gradients toward low-probability channels.

Extensive experiments on\nCIFAR-100, ImageNet, and COCO datasets, as well as various CNN and ViT\nteacher-student architecture combinations, demonstrate that our plug-and-play\nranking loss consistently boosts the performance of multiple distillation\nbaselines.

[1] wherein by working directly with principal stretches the entire\neigenstructure of constitutive and geometric/initial stiffness terms were found\nin closed-form, giving fresh insights into exact convexity conditions of highly\nnon-convex functions in discrete settings. Consequently, owing to these tangent\neigenvalues an analytic tangent stabilisation was proposed bypassing incumbent\nnumerical approaches routinely used in nonlinear finite element analysis. This\nformulation appears to be extremely robust for quasi-static simulation of\ncomplex deformations even with no load increments and time stepping while still\ncapturing instabilities automatically in ways that are infeasible for\npath-following techniques in practice. In this work, we generalise the notion\nof tangent stabilised elasticity to virtually all known invariant formulations\nof nonlinear elasticity. We show that, closed-form eigen-decomposition of\ntangents is easily available irrespective of invariant formulation or integrity\nbasis. In particular, we work out closed-form tangent eigensystems for\nisotropic Total Lagrangian deformation gradient (F )-based and right\nCauchy-Green (C)-based as well as Updated Lagrangian left Cauchy-Green\n(b)-based formulations and present their exact convexity conditions postulated\nin terms of their corresponding tangent and initial stiffness eigenvalues. In\naddition, we introduce the notion of geometrically stabilised polyconvex large\nstrain elasticity for models that are materially stable but exhibit geometric\ninstabilities for whom we construct their initial stiffness in a\nspectrally-decomposed form analytically. We further extend this framework to\nthe case of transverse isotropy where once again, closed-form tangent\neigensystems are found for common transversely isotropic invariants.",

In the Central Region, e-scooter\nintroduction was associated with significant substitution effects, showing a\n23.87% reduction in combined bus and metro boardings, suggesting e-scooters\nreplace short public transport trips in high-density areas. The Intermediate\nRegion showed strong complementary effects, with a 33.6% increase in public\ntransport boardings and 4.08% increase in alightings, indicating e-scooters\nsuccessfully serve as first/last-mile connectors that enhance transit\naccessibility. The Peripheral Region exhibited no significant effects. Metro\nservices experienced stronger impacts than bus services, with metro boardings\nincreasing 9.77\\% in the Intermediate Region. Our findings advance\nunderstanding of micromobility-transit interactions by demonstrating that both\nsubstitution and complementarity can coexist within the same urban system,\ndepending on local accessibility conditions. These results highlight the need\nfor spatially differentiated mobility policies that recognize e-scooters'\nvariable roles across urban environments.",

However, current learnable prompt tokens are primarily used\nfor the single phase of adapting to tasks (i.e., adapting prompt), easily\nleading to overfitting risks. In this work, we propose a novel Cascade Prompt\nLearning CasPL framework to enable prompt learning to serve both generic and\nspecific expertise (i.e., boosting and adapting prompt) simultaneously.\nSpecifically, CasPL is a new learning paradigm comprising two distinct phases\nof learnable prompts: the first boosting prompt is crafted to extract\ndomain-general knowledge from a senior larger CLIP teacher model by aligning\ntheir predicted logits using extensive unlabeled domain images. The second\nadapting prompt is then cascaded with the frozen first set to fine-tune the\ndownstream tasks, following the approaches employed in prior research. In this\nmanner, CasPL can effectively capture both domain-general and task-specific\nrepresentations into explicitly different gradual groups of prompts, thus\npotentially alleviating overfitting issues in the target domain. It's worth\nnoting that CasPL serves as a plug-and-play module that can seamlessly\nintegrate into any existing prompt learning approach. CasPL achieves a\nsignificantly better balance between performance and inference speed, which is\nespecially beneficial for deploying smaller VLM models in resource-constrained\nenvironments. Compared to the previous state-of-the-art method PromptSRC, CasPL\nshows an average improvement of 1.85% for base classes, 3.44% for novel\nclasses, and 2.72% for the harmonic mean over 11 image classification datasets.\nCode is publicly available at: https://github.com/megvii-research/CasPL.",

    "abstract": "For single image defocus deblurring, acquiring well-aligned training pairs\n(or training triplets), i.e., a defocus blurry image, an all-in-focus sharp\nimage (and a defocus blur map), is a challenging task for developing effective\ndeblurring models. Existing image defocus deblurring methods typically rely on\ntraining data collected by specialized imaging equipment, with the assumption\nthat these pairs or triplets are perfectly aligned. However, in practical\nscenarios involving the collection of real-world data, direct acquisition of\ntraining triplets is infeasible, and training pairs inevitably encounter\nspatial misalignment issues. In this work, we introduce a reblurring-guided\nlearning framework for single image defocus deblurring, enabling the learning\nof a deblurring network even with misaligned training pairs. By reconstructing\nspatially variant isotropic blur kernels, our reblurring module ensures spatial\nconsistency between the deblurred image, the reblurred image and the input\nblurry image, thereby addressing the misalignment issue while effectively\nextracting sharp textures from the all-in-focus sharp image. Moreover,\nspatially variant blur can be derived from the reblurring module, and serve as\npseudo supervision for defocus blur map during training, interestingly\ntransforming training pairs into training triplets. To leverage this pseudo\nsupervision, we propose a lightweight defocus blur estimator coupled with a\nfusion block, which enhances deblurring performance through seamless\nintegration with state-of-the-art deblurring networks. Additionally, we have\ncollected a new dataset for single image defocus deblurring (SDD) with typical\nmisalignments, which not only validates our proposed method but also serves as\na benchmark for future research.",

We show that the predominant fraction of the kinetic\nenergy of the precession-driven fluid flow is contained only within a few\nlarge-scale modes.\n  The most striking observation shown by simulations and experiments is the\ntransition from a flow dominated by large-scale structures to a more turbulent\nbehaviour with the small-scale fluctuations becoming increasingly important. At\na fixed rotation frequency (parametrized by the Reynolds number, ${\\rm{Re}}$)\nthis transition occurs when a critical precession ratio is exceeded and\nconsists of a two-stage collapse of the directly driven flow going along with a\nmassive modification of the azimuthal circulation (the zonal flow) and the\nappearance of an axisymmetric double-roll mode limited to a narrow range of\nprecession ratios. A similar behaviour is found in experiments which make it\npossible to follow the transition up to Reynolds numbers of ${\\rm{Re}}\\approx\n2\\times 10^6$.

    "abstract": "Hot subdwarfs are compact blue evolved objects, burning helium in their cores\nsurrounded by a tiny hydrogen envelope. Most models agree on a common envelope\nbinary evolution scenario in the Red Giant phase. However, the binarity rate\nfor these objects is yet unsolved. We aim to develop a novel classification\nmethod for identifying hot subdwarf binaries within large datasets using\nArtificial Intelligence methods and Gaia DR3 data. The results will be compared\nwith those obtained previously using VOSA (Virtual Observatory Sed Analyzer) on\ncoincident samples. The methods include several machine learning techniques. We\nused Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify 3084 hot subdwarf stars based on\ntheir color-magnitude properties. Of these, 2815 objects have Gaia Data Release\n3 BP/RP spectra, which were classified using Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) and\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The findings demonstrate a high agreement\nlevel (70-90%) with VOSA's classification, indicating that machine learning\nmethods effectively classify sources with an accuracy comparable to human\ninspection or non-AI techniques. SVM in a radial basis function achieves 70.97%\nreproducibility for binary targets using photometry. CNN reaches 84.94% for\nbinary detection using spectroscopy. We also found that the single-binary\ndifferences are especially observable on the infrared flux in our GDR3 BP/BR\nspectra, at wavelengths larger than 700 nm. We found that all our methods are\neffective in discerning between single and binary systems and are consistent\nwith the results previously obtained with VOSA. In global terms, considering\nall quality metrics, CNN is the method that provides the best accuracy. The\nmethods are also effective for detecting peculiarities in the spectra. Further\nresearch is needed to refine our techniques and enhance automated\nclassification reliability, especially for large-scale surveys.",

Typically, they either neglect to exploit the\npotential of existing extensive pretrained models, limiting their generative\ncapacity, or they necessitate a dozens of forward passes starting from random\nnoises, compromising inference efficiency. In this paper, we present DoSSR, a\nDomain Shift diffusion-based SR model that capitalizes on the generative powers\nof pretrained diffusion models while significantly enhancing efficiency by\ninitiating the diffusion process with low-resolution (LR) images. At the core\nof our approach is a domain shift equation that integrates seamlessly with\nexisting diffusion models.

Moreover, we advance our\nmethod by transitioning the discrete shift process to a continuous formulation,\ntermed as DoS-SDEs. This advancement leads to the fast and customized solvers\nthat further enhance sampling efficiency. Empirical results demonstrate that\nour proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on synthetic and\nreal-world datasets, while notably requiring only 5 sampling steps.

Allowing only stacks, only queues, or both, the minimum number of\nrequired parts is the graph's stack number $sn(G)$, queue number $qn(G)$, and\nmixed number $mn(G)$, respectively.\n  Already in 1992, Heath and Rosenberg asked whether $qn(G)$ is bounded in\nterms of $sn(G)$, that is, whether stacks \"can be transformed into\" queues.\nThis is equivalent to bipartite $3$-stack graphs having bounded queue number\n(Dujmovi\\'c and Wood, 2005). Recently, Alam et al. asked whether $qn(G)$ is\nbounded in terms of $mn(G)$, which we show to also be equivalent to the\nprevious questions.\n  We approach the problem by considering separated linear layouts of bipartite\ngraphs.

Current\nmulti-modal approaches struggle with data heterogeneity and missing data. This\nstudy aims to overcome these limitations by developing a novel transformer\nmodel for multi-stain integration that can handle missing data during training\nas well as inference. Methods: We propose UNICORN (UNiversal modality\nIntegration Network for CORonary classificatioN) a multi-modal transformer\ncapable of processing multi-stain histopathology for atherosclerosis severity\nclass prediction. The architecture comprises a two-stage, end-to-end trainable\nmodel with specialized modules utilizing transformer self-attention blocks. The\ninitial stage employs domain-specific expert modules to extract features from\neach modality. In the subsequent stage, an aggregation expert module integrates\nthese features by learning the interactions between the different data\nmodalities. Results: Evaluation was performed using a multi-class dataset of\natherosclerotic lesions from the Munich Cardiovascular Studies Biobank\n(MISSION), using over 4,000 paired multi-stain whole slide images (WSIs) from\n170 deceased individuals on 7 prespecified segments of the coronary tree, each\nstained according to four histopathological protocols. UNICORN achieved a\nclassification accuracy of 0.67, outperforming other state-of-the-art models.\nThe model effectively identifies relevant tissue phenotypes across stainings\nand implicitly models disease progression.

Recently, a scenario has been suggested that predicts,\namong other processes, a long-term ablation of the surface layers of RGs during\ntheir repetitive passages through the Galactic jet (Zaja\\v{c}ek et al., 2020).\nIn this study, we perform detailed three-dimensional numerical modelling of\nthis phenomenon. We calculate the ablation rate of the surface layers of a RG\norbiting the supermassive black hole (SMBH) as it passes through the nuclear\njet. In particular, we model the jet-star interaction for approximately 10\npassages for the closer orbital distance of $10^{-3}\\,\\text{pc}$ and 2 passages\nfor $10^{-2}\\,\\text{pc}$. We find that the mass loss due to ablation by the jet\nbehaves with time as $\\Delta M_{\\star}\\propto \\sqrt{t}$ and the total ablated\nmass during a single active galactic nucleus (AGN) phase ($10^5$ years) is\n$\\sim 10^{-4}\\,M_{\\odot}$. We arrive at similar rates of the stellar ablation\nfor the relatively smaller jet luminosity $10^{42}\\,\\text{erg}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$\nas in the previous analytical calculations. For larger jet luminosities of\n$10^{44}$ and $10^{48}\\,\\text{erg}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$, the ablation rates inferred\nfrom $\\sim 10$ interactions as well as extrapolated power-law fits are\nsignificantly lower than analytical values. Overall, the mass ablation rate per\ninteraction and the extrapolated cumulative mass loss during the jet activity\nare comparable to the stellar-wind mass loss. For the smallest orbital distance\nof $10^{-3}\\,\\text{pc}$, we also track the thermal behaviour of the stellar\nsurface layer, whose temperature appears to grow rapidly during the first 10\npassages from $\\sim 3600\\,{\\rm K}$ (spectral type M) to $\\sim 8500\\,{\\rm K}$\n(spectral type A).

The original design proposed by\nWilson, developed without the benefit of modern computational fluid dynamics\n(CFD), was inadequate for generating a sufficiently large undisturbed zone or\nachieving a uniform flow along the centerline, necessitating further\nrefinement. Consequently, significant modifications were implemented to enhance\nPMD's performance, resulting in an expanded undisturbed zone and a uniform\ncenterline flow that facilitate the measurements of nonequilibrium\nde-excitation.} A general design method is introduced, combining theoretical\nanalysis and numerical simulations to tailor the flow conditions for various\nresearch objectives. The implementation involves considerations of the shock\ntube conditions, PMD configuration, and the effective measurement zone. The\ninterplay between shock tube conditions and airfoil geometry generates diverse\nde-excitation patterns. The shock tube test time, transition onset location,\nand radiance intensity determine the effective measurement zone. An example\nutilizing N2 as the test gas demonstrates the method, achieving one-dimensional\nflow with thermal nonequilibrium and chemical freezing along the centerline,\nvalidating the method's effectiveness. An effective measurement zone of 200 mm\nis obtained under this condition, and the primary constraint under\nhigh-enthalpy conditions is the limited shock tube test time due to the high\nshock velocity and low fill pressure.",

We\nfocused on magnetically active regions outside sunspots (e.g., plages and\nnetwork) close to the solar disk center. We studied how the AIA and HMI\nparameters change with distance from the active region perimeter. The AIA 1600\nemission typically decreases with increasing (more horizontal) inclination. For\nall inclinations, AIA 1600 emission increases with increasing magnetic field\nstrength until saturating at some peak intensity, which depends on the cosine\nof the inclination, with horizontal regions saturating at lower intensities. In\naddition, we find that activity clusters have a narrow boundary (< 2\narcseconds) in which the AIA 1600 intensity, magnetic field strength, and\ninclination distributions and relations differ significantly from those in the\ninner layers. This study demonstrates the significant effect that magnetic\nfield inclination and activity cluster border regions have on chromospheric\nemissions.

Frequently, broad conclusions are simply derived from\nmean performance values. In this paper, we argue that this common practice is\noften a misleading simplification as it ignores performance variability. Our\ncontribution is threefold. (1) Analyzing all MICCAI segmentation papers (n =\n221) published in 2023, we first observe that more than 50% of papers do not\nassess performance variability at all. Moreover, only one (0.5%) paper reported\nconfidence intervals (CIs) for model performance. (2) To address the reporting\nbottleneck, we show that the unreported standard deviation (SD) in segmentation\npapers can be approximated by a second-order polynomial function of the mean\nDice similarity coefficient (DSC). Based on external validation data from 56\nprevious MICCAI challenges, we demonstrate that this approximation can\naccurately reconstruct the CI of a method using information provided in\npublications. (3) Finally, we reconstructed 95% CIs around the mean DSC of\nMICCAI 2023 segmentation papers. The median CI width was 0.03 which is three\ntimes larger than the median performance gap between the first and second\nranked method. For more than 60% of papers, the mean performance of the\nsecond-ranked method was within the CI of the first-ranked method. We conclude\nthat current publications typically do not provide sufficient evidence to\nsupport which models could potentially be translated into clinical practice.",

Specifically owing to\nneighboring regions of the same pixel position in different sub-aperture images\nexhibit similar structural relationships we design a lightweight CNN-based\nfeature extraction module (namely DGCE) to extract local features better\nthrough feature modulation.

In\nthis study, we adapt the Deep Variational Bayes Filter (DVBF) to the FEMIN\nframework, incorporating a probabilistic approach to provide qualitative\ninsights into prediction confidence during FEMIN simulations.

As a consequence, we find that in bipartite\nsystem modeled by commuting factors in Haag duality, a) all states have\ninfinite single-shot entanglement if and only if the local factors are not of\ntype I, b) type III factors are characterized by LOCC transitions of arbitrary\nprecision between any two pure states, and c) the latter holds even without\nclassical communication for type III$_{1}$ factors.

    "abstract": "Automated damage detection is an integral component of each structural health\nmonitoring (SHM) system. Typically, measurements from various sensors are\ncollected and reduced to damage-sensitive features, and diagnostic values are\ngenerated by statistically evaluating the features. Since changes in data do\nnot only result from damage, it is necessary to determine the confounding\nfactors (environmental or operational variables) and to remove their effects\nfrom the measurements or features. Many existing methods for correcting\nconfounding effects are based on different types of mean regression. This\nneglects potential changes in higher-order statistical moments, but in\nparticular, the output covariances are essential for generating reliable\ndiagnostics for damage detection. This article presents an approach to\nexplicitly quantify the changes in the covariance, using conditional covariance\nmatrices based on a non-parametric, kernel-based estimator. The method is\napplied to the Munich Test Bridge and the KW51 Railway Bridge in Leuven,\ncovering both raw sensor measurements (acceleration, strain, inclination) and\nextracted damage-sensitive features (natural frequencies). The results show\nthat covariances between different vibration or inclination sensors can\nsignificantly change due to temperature changes, and the same is true for\nnatural frequencies. To highlight the advantages, it is explained how\nconditional covariances can be combined with standard approaches for damage\ndetection, such as the Mahalanobis distance and principal component analysis.\nAs a result, more reliable diagnostic values can be generated with fewer false\nalarms.",

The analysis focused on\ndetecting trends at annual and monthly time scales, employing both ordinary\nleast squares, robust S-estimator regression, and Mann-Kendall and Sen's slope\nmethods. Then hierarchical clustering using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) was\napplied to the monthly data to analyze the intra-annual pattern similarity of\ntrends within and across the groups. Two different regions of Europe were\nchosen because of the different climate and temperature trends, namely the\nNorthern UK (smaller trends) and the North-West Italian Alps (larger trends).\nThe main novelty of the work is to show that stations having similar locations\nand altitudes have similar monthly slopes by quantifying them using DTW and\nclustering. These results reveal the nonrandomness of different trends along\nthe year and among different parts of Europe, with a modest influence of\naltitude in wintertime. The findings revealed that group average trends were\nclose to the NOAA values for the areas in Italy and the UK, confirming the\nvalidity of analyzing a small number of stations. More interestingly,\nintra-annual patterns were detected commonly at the stations of each of the\ngroups, and clearly different between them Hierarchical clustering in\ncombination with DTW showed consistent similarity between monthly patterns of\nmeans and trends within the group of stations and inconsistent similarity\nbetween patterns across groups.

The fusion mechanism leverages the strengths of each\nmodality while minimizing their weaknesses. Moreover, in practice, camera-LiDAR\nfusion models utilize pre-trained backbones for efficient training. However, we\nargue that directly loading single-modal pre-trained camera and LiDAR backbones\ninto camera-LiDAR fusion models introduces similar feature redundancy across\nmodalities due to the nature of the fusion mechanism. Unfortunately, existing\npruning methods are developed explicitly for single-modal models, and thus,\nthey struggle to effectively identify these specific redundant parameters in\ncamera-LiDAR fusion models. In this paper, to address the issue above on\ncamera-LiDAR fusion models, we propose a novelty pruning framework Alternative\nModality Masking Pruning (AlterMOMA), which employs alternative masking on each\nmodality and identifies the redundant parameters. Specifically, when one\nmodality parameters are masked (deactivated), the absence of features from the\nmasked backbone compels the model to reactivate previous redundant features of\nthe other modality backbone. Therefore, these redundant features and relevant\nredundant parameters can be identified via the reactivation process. The\nredundant parameters can be pruned by our proposed importance score evaluation\nfunction, Alternative Evaluation (AlterEva), which is based on the observation\nof the loss changes when certain modality parameters are activated and\ndeactivated.

Yet,\nnanostructuring crystalline YIG and manipulating its magnetism in a\nnon-destructive way is an outstanding challenge, and so far mostly limited to\ntwo-dimensional capabilities. Here, we show that irradiation of single-crystal\nYIG films with a focused UV laser drives a stable, giant enhancement of the\nperpendicular magnetic anisotropy, preserving the crystalline quality. This\nmodulation is highly confined at the nanoscale in both the lateral and vertical\ndirections, and its extension within the volume can be finely tuned with a\ncontinuous depth-control. By harnessing these three-dimensional anisotropy\nprofiles, we demonstrate a large tuning of the spin-wave band structure, volume\nspatial localization, and non-reciprocity, realizing proof-of-principle 3D\nmagnonic crystals. This straightforward, single-step, laser nanofabrication of\nthree-dimensional magnetic systems based on crystalline YIG thin films opens\nthe way to design novel functions in magnonic and magneto-optic devices.",

Given the detected objects and their bounding boxes, two methods are\nproposed to detect the pick and place tasks which transform the initial scene\ninto the final scene.

The performed pick and place tasks are then derived from analyzing the\nexperiments with both scenes.

Building on this intuition, we leverage Jacobians\ndefined in a one-ring neighborhood as a coarse representation of the\ndeformation. Using this as the input to our neural network, we apply a series\nof MLPs combined with feature smoothing to learn the Jacobian corresponding to\nthe detail-preserving deformation, from which the embedding is recovered by the\nstandard Poisson solve. Crucially, by removing the dependence on a global\nencoding, every \\textit{point} becomes a training example, making the\nsupervision particularly lightweight. Moreover, when trained on a class of\nshapes, our approach demonstrates remarkable generalization across different\nobject categories.

Steiner mincut is a well-studied concept,\nwhich provides a generalization to both (s,t)-mincut (when $|S|=2$) and global\nmincut (when $|S|=n$). Here, we address the problem of designing a compact data\nstructure that can efficiently report a Steiner mincut and its capacity after\nthe failure of any edge in $G$; such a data structure is known as a\n\\textit{Sensitivity Oracle} for Steiner mincut.\n  In the area of minimum cuts, although many Sensitivity Oracles have been\ndesigned in unweighted graphs, however, in weighted graphs, Sensitivity Oracles\nexist only for (s,t)-mincut [Annals of Operations Research 1991, NETWORKS 2019,\nICALP 2024], which is just a special case of Steiner mincut. Here, we\ngeneralize this result to any arbitrary set $S\\subseteq V$.\n  1. Sensitivity Oracle: Assuming the capacity of every edge is known,\n  a. there is an ${\\mathcal O}(n)$ space data structure that can report the\ncapacity of Steiner mincut in ${\\mathcal O}(1)$ time and\n  b. there is an ${\\mathcal O}(n(n-|S|+1))$ space data structure that can\nreport a Steiner mincut in ${\\mathcal O}(n)$ time after the failure of any edge\nin $G$.\n  2. Lower Bound: We show that any data structure that, after the failure of\nany edge, can report a Steiner mincut or its capacity must occupy $\\Omega(n^2)$\nbits of space in the worst case, irrespective of the size of the Steiner set.\n  The lower bound in (2) shows that the assumption in (1) is essential to break\nthe $\\Omega(n^2)$ lower bound on space. For $|S|=n-k$ for any constant $k\\ge\n0$, it occupies only ${\\mathcal O}(n)$ space. So, we also present the first\nSensitivity Oracle occupying ${\\mathcal O}(n)$ space for global mincut.",

This makes the computation of the Casimir-Polder (CP)\ninteraction between a polarizable particle and a dielectric wedge challenging.\nThis geometry is a prototype for the effect of edges on fluctuation-induced\ninteractions, and hence it is important to employ new methods for this problem.\nUsing a recently developed multiple scattering expansion [T. Emig and G.\nBimonte, Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 200401 (2023)], here we implement a basis-free\nnumerical evaluation of this expansion to obtain precise estimates of the CP\npotential for a wedge over a wide range of dielectric constants. A remarkable\nfinding is that the CP potential for a dielectric wedge with a smoothed edge is\nclosely related to the potential of a sharp wedge made of a perfect electric\nconductor. The latter potential is known exactly, making this relation\nparticularly useful in practice.",

Based on\nthis, we propose a novel paradigm called Parallel Gated Network (PGN) as the\nnew successor to RNN. PGN directly captures information from previous time\nsteps through the designed Historical Information Extraction (HIE) layer and\nleverages gated mechanisms to select and fuse it with the current time step\ninformation. This reduces the information propagation path to $\\mathcal{O}(1)$,\neffectively addressing the limitations of RNN. To enhance PGN's performance in\nlong-range time series forecasting tasks, we propose a novel temporal modeling\nframework called Temporal PGN (TPGN). TPGN incorporates two branches to\ncomprehensively capture the semantic information of time series. One branch\nutilizes PGN to capture long-term periodic patterns while preserving their\nlocal characteristics. The other branch employs patches to capture short-term\ninformation and aggregate the global representation of the series. TPGN\nachieves a theoretical complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{L})$, ensuring\nefficiency in its operations. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and high efficiency of\nTPGN, further confirming the effectiveness of PGN as the new successor to RNN\nin long-range time series forecasting.

This study employs an iterative research approach in developing a\nCustom GPT with the aim of achieving more reliable results and testing whether\nit can provide design students with constructive feedback. The findings\ninclude: First,through several rounds of iterations the inter-reliability\nbetween GPT and human raters reached a level that is generally accepted by\neducators. This indicates that by providing accurate prompts to GPT,and\ncontinuously iterating to build a Custom GPT, it can be used to effectively\ngrade students' design assignments, serving as a reliable complement to human\nraters. Second, the intra-reliability of GPT's scoring at different times is\nbetween 0.65 and 0.78.

    "abstract": "Sea ice is a mushy layer, a porous material whose properties depend on the\nrelative proportions of solid and liquid. The growth of sea ice is governed by\nheat transfer through the ice together with appropriate boundary conditions at\nthe interfaces with the atmosphere and ocean. The salinity of sea ice has a\nlarge effect on its thermal properties so might naively be expected to have a\nlarge effect on its growth rate. However, previous studies observed a low\nsensitivity throughout the winter growth season. The goal of this study is to\nidentify the controlling physical mechanisms that explain this observation. We\ndevelop a simplified quasi-static framework by applying a similarity\ntransformation to the underlying heat equation and neglecting the explicit time\ndependence. We find three key processes controlling the sensitivity of growth\nrate to salinity. First, the trade-off between thermal conductivity and\n(latent) heat capacity leads to low sensitivity to salinity even at moderately\nhigh salinity and brine volume fraction. Second, the feedback on the\ntemperature profile reduces the sensitivity relative to models that assume a\nlinear profile, such as zero-layer Semtner models. Third, thicker ice has the\nopposite sensitivity of growth rate to salinity compared to thinner ice,\nsensitivities that counteract each other as the ice grows. Beyond its use in\ndiagnosing these sensitivities, we show that the quasi-static approach offers a\nvaluable sea-ice model of intermediate complexity between zero-layer Semtner\nmodels and full partial-differential-equation-based models such as\nMaykut-Untersteiner/Bitz-Lipscomb and mushy-layer models.",

    "abstract": "The origin of the most luminous subclass of the fast blue optical transients\n(LFBOTs) is still unknown. We present an X-ray spectral analysis of\nAT2018cow-the LFBOT archetype-using NuSTAR, Swift, and XMM-Newton data. The\nsource spectrum can be explained by the presence of a slim accretion disk, and\nwe find that the mass accretion rate decreases to sub-Eddington levels >~ 200\ndays after the source's discovery. Applying our slim disk model to data\nobtained at multiple observational epochs, we constrain the mass of the central\ncompact object in AT2018cow to be log(M_BH/Msun)=2.4+0.6/-0.1 at the 68%\nconfidence level. Our mass measurement is independent from, but consistent\nwith, the results from previously employed methods. The mass constraint is\nconsistent with both the tidal disruption and the black hole-star merger\nscenarios, if the latter model can be extrapolated to the measured black hole\nmass. Our work provides evidence for an accreting intermediate-mass black hole\n(10^2--10^6 Msun) as the central engine in AT2018cow, and, by extension, in\nLFBOT sources similar to AT2018cow.",

Most of the techniques for effecting a nanoMRI\ngradient use small permanent magnets. Here, we present a switchable magnetic\nfield gradient on a tip, which is designed to provide a local and controllable\nmagnetic field with a high gradient on the nanometer scale. We incorporate the\ngradient field with a nanoscale magnetic resonance sensor, a single\nnitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond, to provide high-resolution magnetic\nresonance imaging. The device is a metal microwire deposited along a quartz\ntip, with the current flowing along the tip inducing a magnetic field around\nits apex. This field can be manipulated throughout a measurement by controlling\nthe current along the wire. We achieved gradients as high as 1\n$\\mathrm{\\mu}\\text{T/nm}$ at fields weaker than 200 $\\mathrm{\\mu}\\text{T}$.\nSuch a gradient can facilitate electron spin mapping with 1 nm resolution using\nsingle NV sensors, allowing for nanoscale imaging of electrons. The ability to\nswitch the current on and off and to position the device with high precision\novercomes limitations such as limited emitter contrast and the flexibility in\nsample preparation. Moreover, we show that proximity of the metallic tip to the\nsensor modifies the Rabi power in a spatially dependent manner, providing\nregions with enhanced ($\\times$3.5) and decreased Rabi power.

However, they do not\nexplicitly account for edit operations with different costs. In response, we\npropose GRAPHEDX, a neural GED estimator that can work with general costs\nspecified for the four edit operations, viz., edge deletion, edge addition,\nnode deletion and node addition. We first present GED as a quadratic assignment\nproblem (QAP) that incorporates these four costs. Then, we represent each graph\nas a set of node and edge embeddings and use them to design a family of neural\nset divergence surrogates. We replace the QAP terms corresponding to each\noperation with their surrogates. Computing such neural set divergence require\naligning nodes and edges of the two graphs. We learn these alignments using a\nGumbel-Sinkhorn permutation generator, additionally ensuring that the node and\nedge alignments are consistent with each other. Moreover, these alignments are\ncognizant of both the presence and absence of edges between node-pairs.\nExperiments on several datasets, under a variety of edit cost settings, show\nthat GRAPHEDX consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods and heuristics\nin terms of prediction error.",

    "abstract": "Stereopsis has widespread appeal in robotics as it is the predominant way by\nwhich living beings perceive depth to navigate our 3D world. Event cameras are\nnovel bio-inspired sensors that detect per-pixel brightness changes\nasynchronously, with very high temporal resolution and high dynamic range,\nenabling machine perception in high-speed motion and broad illumination\nconditions. The high temporal precision also benefits stereo matching, making\ndisparity (depth) estimation a popular research area for event cameras ever\nsince its inception. Over the last 30 years, the field has evolved rapidly,\nfrom low-latency, low-power circuit design to current deep learning (DL)\napproaches driven by the computer vision community. The bibliography is vast\nand difficult to navigate for non-experts due its highly interdisciplinary\nnature. Past surveys have addressed distinct aspects of this topic, in the\ncontext of applications, or focusing only on a specific class of techniques,\nbut have overlooked stereo datasets. This survey provides a comprehensive\noverview, covering both instantaneous stereo and long-term methods suitable for\nsimultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), along with theoretical and\nempirical comparisons. It is the first to extensively review DL methods as well\nas stereo datasets, even providing practical suggestions for creating new\nbenchmarks to advance the field. The main advantages and challenges faced by\nevent-based stereo depth estimation are also discussed. Despite significant\nprogress, challenges remain in achieving optimal performance in not only\naccuracy but also efficiency, a cornerstone of event-based computing. We\nidentify several gaps and propose future research directions. We hope this\nsurvey inspires future research in this area, by serving as an accessible entry\npoint for newcomers, as well as a practical guide for seasoned researchers in\nthe community.",

The current literature proposes the so-called adjusted\nExpected Shortfall as a solution. This risk measure is the supremum of Expected\nShortfalls for all possible levels, adjusted with a function $g$, the so-called\ntarget risk profile. We generalize this idea by using a family of risk measures\nwhich allows for more choices than Expected Shortfalls, leading to the concept\nof adjusted risk measures. An adjusted risk measure quantifies the minimal\namount of capital that has to added to a financial position $X$ to ensure that\neach risk measure out of the chosen family is smaller or equal to the target\nrisk profile $g(p)$ for the corresponding level $p\\in[0,1]$. We discuss a\nvariety of assumptions such that desirable properties for risk measures are\nsatisfied in this setup. From a theoretical point of view, our main\ncontribution is the analysis of equivalent assumptions such that an adjusted\nrisk measure is positive homogeneous and subadditive. Furthermore, we show that\nthese conditions hold for several adjusted risk measures beyond the adjusted\nExpected Shortfall. In addition, we derive their dual representations.

A challenge lies in\ninferring the positions of other unknown robots based on the positions of\nanchors.

Based on existing solutions,\nthis study proposes a novel meta-heuristic algorithm - Improved Beluga Whale\nOptimization Algorithm (IBWO) to address the localization problem of SRSs,\nfocusing on enhancing the accuracy of localization results.

Specifically, we test the\nlocalization accuracy of robots under different proportions of anchors,\ndifferent communication radius of robots, and different total number of robots.\nCompared to the traditional multilateration method and four other localization\nmethods based on meta-heuristic algorithms, the localization accuracy of this\nmethod is consistently superior.",

Measurements were performed using alpha\nparticles from a 241Am laboratory source and proton and carbon ion beams from a\nsynchrotron accelerator. The particle count rate upper limit is determined by\noverlapping per-pixel particle signals, identifiable by the hits per pixel\ncounter > 2, indicating the need to decrease acquisition time. On the other\nhand, the lower limit is the time required to collect the particle deposited\ncharge while maintaining spectral properties. Different acquisition times were\nevaluated for an AdvaPIX Timepix3 detector (500 um Silicon sensor) with\nstandard per-pixel DAC settings and a Minipix Timepix2 detector (300 um Silicon\nsensor) with standard and customized settings the pulse shaping parameter and\nthreshold. For AdvaPIX Timepix3, spectra remained accurate down to 100 us frame\nacquisition time; at 10 us, loss of collected charge occurred, suggesting\neither avoiding this acquisition time or applying a correction. Timepix2\nallowed acquisition times down to 100 ns for single particle track measurements\neven for high energy loss, enabled by a new Timepix2 feature delaying shutter\nclosure until full particle charge collection. This work represents the first\nmeasurement utilizing Timepix-chips pixel detectors in an accelerator beam of\nclinical energy and intensity without the need to decrease the beam current.\nThis is made possible by exploiting the short shutter feature in Timepix2 and a\ncustomized per-pixel energy calibration of the Timepix2 detector with a larger\ndischarging signal value which allowed for a shorter time-over-threshold (ToT)\nsignal. These customized settings extend the operation of the pixel detectors\nto higher event rates up to 10^9 particles/cm^2/s.",

In this paper, we introduce the Prototype based Masked\nAudio Model~(PMAM) algorithm for self-supervised representation learning in\nSED, to better exploit unlabeled data.

We show that FACTORSIM\noutperforms existing methods in generating simulations regarding prompt\nalignment (e.g., accuracy), zero-shot transfer abilities, and human evaluation.\nWe also demonstrate its effectiveness in generating robotic tasks.",

    "abstract": "This paper studies a novel training-free energy beam focusing approach for a\nnear-field wireless power transfer (WPT) system with extremely large-scale\nantenna array (ELAA). In particular, we focus on the setup with one access\npoint (AP) equipped with an extremely large-scale uniform planar array (UPA)\nserving multiple single-antenna energy receivers (ERs), in which the\nline-of-sight (LoS) dominated wireless channels are dependent on the relative\npositions of ERs and exhibit spatial non-stationarity. Different from\nconventional designs relying on training and feedback, we present a novel\nenergy beam focusing design assisted by wireless radar sensing based on a\ntwo-stage transmission protocol. In the first stage, the AP performs wireless\nradar sensing to identify the ERs' visibility regions (VRs) and estimate their\nthree-dimension (3D) positions for constructing the corresponding channel state\ninformation (CSI). In the second stage, the AP implements the transmit energy\nbeam focusing based on the constructed CSI to efficiently charge these ERs.\nUnder this setup, we first minimize the sensing duration in the first stage,\nwhile guaranteeing a specific accuracy threshold for position estimation. Next,\nwe optimize the energy beamformers at the AP in the second stage to maximize\nthe weighted harvested energy among all ERs subject to the maximum transmit\npower constraint. In this approach, the time resource allocation between the\ntwo stages is properly designed to optimize the ultimate energy transfer\nperformance. Numerical results show that the proposed design performs close to\nthe performance upper bound with perfect VR and CSI and significantly\noutperforms other benchmark schemes.",

Furthermore they revealed the effects of the electric\ncharge of the black hole on the surrounding plasma. Since their results mainly\nrely on non-relativistic analyses, we study the same subject through\nrelativistic analyses in this paper. By investigating a test particle in the\nSchwarzschild spacetime, we find that if initial velocities of protons and\nelectrons far from a black hole follow the Maxwell distribution, the black hole\ncan acquire electric charge whose value depends on the ratio of temperature of\nthe proton and that of the electron. We also show that if the black hole\nacquires the electric charge, the radii of the innermost stable circular orbit\n(ISCO) and the specific energy of a charged particle on ISCO can be very\ndifferent from those of a neutral particle. In contrast to the result obtained\nby Zajacek et al, we find that the ISCO radii of a proton and an electron are\nnecessarily larger than that of a neutral test particle as long as the black\nhole acquires the charge. The large ISCO radius might lead to a larger angular\ndiameter of a black hole shadow and a different estimate of the released energy\ndue to the accretion of plasma from the estimate based on the assumption of\nelectric neutrality of the central black hole.",

    "abstract": "Widely distributed misinformation shared across social media channels is a\npressing issue that poses a significant threat to many aspects of society's\nwell-being. Inaccurate shared information causes confusion, can adversely\naffect mental health, and can lead to mis-informed decision-making. Therefore,\nit is important to implement proactive measures to intervene and curb the\nspread of misinformation where possible. This has prompted scholars to\ninvestigate a variety of intervention strategies for misinformation sharing on\nsocial media. This study explores the typology of intervention strategies for\naddressing misinformation sharing on social media, identifying 4 important\nclusters - cognition-based, automated-based, information-based, and\nhybrid-based. The literature selection process utilized the PRISMA method to\nensure a systematic and comprehensive analysis of relevant literature while\nmaintaining transparency and reproducibility. A total of 139 articles published\nfrom 2013-2023 were then analyzed. Meanwhile, bibliometric analyses were\nconducted using performance analysis and science mapping techniques for the\ntypology development. A comparative analysis of the typology was conducted to\nreveal patterns and evolution in the field. This provides valuable insights for\nboth theory and practical applications. Overall, the study concludes that\nscholarly contributions to scientific research and publication help to address\nresearch gaps and expand knowledge in this field. Understanding the evolution\nof intervention strategies for misinformation sharing on social media can\nsupport future research that contributes to the development of more effective\nand sustainable solutions to this persistent problem.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have gained prominence\nin various visual and multimodal tasks, yet the deployment of VLMs on\ndownstream application platforms remains challenging due to their prohibitive\nrequirements of training samples and computing resources. Fine-tuning and\nquantization of VLMs can substantially reduce the sample and computation costs,\nwhich are in urgent need. There are two prevailing paradigms in quantization,\nQuantization-Aware Training (QAT) can effectively quantize large-scale VLMs but\nincur a huge training cost, while low-bit Post-Training Quantization (PTQ)\nsuffers from a notable performance drop. We propose a method that balances\nfine-tuning and quantization named ``Prompt for Quantization'' (P4Q), in which\nwe design a lightweight architecture to leverage contrastive loss supervision\nto enhance the recognition performance of a PTQ model. Our method can\neffectively reduce the gap between image features and text features caused by\nlow-bit quantization, based on learnable prompts to reorganize textual\nrepresentations and a low-bit adapter to realign the distributions of image and\ntext features. We also introduce a distillation loss based on cosine similarity\npredictions to distill the quantized model using a full-precision teacher.\nExtensive experimental results demonstrate that our P4Q method outperforms\nprior arts, even achieving comparable results to its full-precision\ncounterparts. For instance, our 8-bit P4Q can theoretically compress the\nCLIP-ViT/B-32 by 4 $\\times$ while achieving 66.94\\% Top-1 accuracy,\noutperforming the learnable prompt fine-tuned full-precision model by 2.24\\%\nwith negligible additional parameters on the ImageNet dataset.",

This work proposes using conditional normalizing\nflows as discrete-time models to learn stochastic dynamics. Normalizing flows\nlearn the probability density function (PDF) of the states explicitly, given\nprior states and control inputs. In addition to standard least squares (LSQ)\nobjectives, this work derives a marginal log-likelihood (MLL) objective based\non the explicit PDF and Markov chain simulations. In a reactor study, the\nnormalizing flow MPC reduces the setpoint error in open and closed-loop cases\nto half that of a nominal controller.

Previous work has presented\ndifferentially private algorithms for many graph problems that can handle\ninsertions only or deletions only (called partially dynamic algorithms) and\nobtained some hardness results for the fully dynamic setting. The only\nalgorithms in the latter setting were for the edge count, given by\nFichtenberger, Henzinger, and Ost (ESA 21), and for releasing the values of all\ngraph cuts, given by Fichtenberger, Henzinger, and Upadhyay (ICML 23). We\nprovide the first differentially private and fully dynamic graph algorithms for\nseveral other fundamental graph statistics (including the triangle count, the\nnumber of connected components, the size of the maximum matching, and the\ndegree histogram), analyze their error and show strong lower bounds on the\nerror for all algorithms in this setting. We study two variants of edge\ndifferential privacy for fully dynamic graph algorithms: event-level and\nitem-level. We give upper and lower bounds on the error of both event-level and\nitem-level fully dynamic algorithms for several fundamental graph problems. No\nfully dynamic algorithms that are private at the item-level (the more stringent\nof the two notions) were known before. In the case of item-level privacy, for\nseveral problems, our algorithms match our lower bounds.",

Meanwhile, most VADs cannot cope with cross-dataset validation for\nnew target domains, and few-shot methods must laboriously rely on model-tuning\nfrom the target domain to complete domain adaptation. To address these\nproblems, we propose a novel VAD method with a motion-guided memory module to\nachieve cross-dataset validation with zero-shot. First, we add Gaussian blur to\nthe raw appearance images, thereby constructing the global pseudo-anomaly,\nwhich serves as the input to the network. Then, we propose multi-scale residual\nchannel attention to deblur the pseudo-anomaly in normal samples. Next, memory\nitems are obtained by recording the motion features in the training phase,\nwhich are used to retrieve the motion features from the raw information in the\ntesting phase. Lastly, our method can ignore the blurred real anomaly through\nattention and rely on motion memory items to increase the normality gap between\nnormal and abnormal motion.

To\nbridge this gap, we conduct a comprehensive study of subjective and objective\nQoE evaluations for live video streaming. For the subjective QoE study, we\nintroduce the first live video streaming QoE dataset, TaoLive QoE, which\nconsists of $42$ source videos collected from real live broadcasts and $1,155$\ncorresponding distorted ones degraded due to a variety of streaming\ndistortions, including conventional streaming distortions such as compression,\nstalling, as well as live streaming-specific distortions like frame skipping,\nvariable frame rate, etc. Subsequently, a human study was conducted to derive\nsubjective QoE scores of videos in the TaoLive QoE dataset. For the objective\nQoE study, we benchmark existing QoE models on the TaoLive QoE dataset as well\nas publicly available QoE datasets for VoD scenarios, highlighting that current\nmodels struggle to accurately assess video QoE, particularly for live content.\nHence, we propose an end-to-end QoE evaluation model, Tao-QoE, which integrates\nmulti-scale semantic features and optical flow-based motion features to\npredicting a retrospective QoE score, eliminating reliance on statistical\nquality of service (QoS) features.",

    "abstract": "Adversarial training has achieved remarkable advancements in defending\nagainst adversarial attacks. Among them, fast adversarial training (FAT) is\ngaining attention for its ability to achieve competitive robustness with fewer\ncomputing resources. Existing FAT methods typically employ a uniform strategy\nthat optimizes all training data equally without considering the influence of\ndifferent examples, which leads to an imbalanced optimization. However, this\nimbalance remains unexplored in the field of FAT. In this paper, we conduct a\ncomprehensive study of the imbalance issue in FAT and observe an obvious class\ndisparity regarding their performances. This disparity could be embodied from a\nperspective of alignment between clean and robust accuracy. Based on the\nanalysis, we mainly attribute the observed misalignment and disparity to the\nimbalanced optimization in FAT, which motivates us to optimize different\ntraining data adaptively to enhance robustness. Specifically, we take disparity\nand misalignment into consideration. First, we introduce self-knowledge guided\nregularization, which assigns differentiated regularization weights to each\nclass based on its training state, alleviating class disparity. Additionally,\nwe propose self-knowledge guided label relaxation, which adjusts label\nrelaxation according to the training accuracy, alleviating the misalignment and\nimproving robustness. By combining these methods, we formulate the\nSelf-Knowledge Guided FAT (SKG-FAT), leveraging naturally generated knowledge\nduring training to enhance the adversarial robustness without compromising\ntraining efficiency. Extensive experiments on four standard datasets\ndemonstrate that the SKG-FAT improves the robustness and preserves competitive\nclean accuracy, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods.",

To fill this gap, which is mainly\ncaused by security reasons, we present the first industrial-scale publicly\navailable multimodal banking dataset, MBD, that contains information on more\nthan 2M corporate clients of a large bank. Clients are represented by several\ndata sources: 950M bank transactions, 1B geo position events, 5M embeddings of\ndialogues with technical support, and monthly aggregated purchases of four bank\nproducts.

Traditional data retrieval methods such as sequential\nsearch and index-based retrieval often fail when handling intricate and\ninterconnected data structures, resulting in incomplete or misleading outputs.\nTo overcome these limitations, we introduce Structured-GraphRAG, a versatile\nframework designed to enhance information retrieval across structured datasets\nin natural language queries. Structured-GraphRAG utilizes multiple knowledge\ngraphs, which represent data in a structured format and capture complex\nrelationships between entities, enabling a more nuanced and comprehensive\nretrieval of information. This graph-based approach reduces the risk of errors\nin language model outputs by grounding responses in a structured format,\nthereby enhancing the reliability of results. We demonstrate the effectiveness\nof Structured-GraphRAG by comparing its performance with that of a recently\npublished method using traditional retrieval-augmented generation. Our findings\nshow that Structured-GraphRAG significantly improves query processing\nefficiency and reduces response times. While our case study focuses on soccer\ndata, the framework's design is broadly applicable, offering a powerful tool\nfor data analysis and enhancing language model applications across various\nstructured domains.",

In particular, while a\nlogarithmic divergence of the deflection angle is known to occur as the closest\ndistance $r_0$ of an incident light trajectory around a black hole approaches a\ndouble root, a stronger power-law (nonlogarithmic) divergence is found as $r_0$\napproaches a triple root especially in a wormhole. In addition, the effective\npotential in terms of the proper distance from the throat is constructed, with\nwhich one can see how the light rays can either travel within a single\nspacetime, where both the source and the observers are located, or pass from\nthe source through the throat into another spacetime where different observers\nreside.

Despite the remarkable\npotential of diffusion models in image generation, current diffusion-based SFR\nmodels struggle with generalization to real-world faces. To address this\nlimitation, we outline three key objectives for SFR: (1) promoting diversity\nacross identities (inter-class diversity), (2) ensuring diversity within each\nidentity by injecting various facial attributes (intra-class diversity), and\n(3) maintaining identity consistency within each identity group (intra-class\nidentity preservation). Inspired by these goals, we introduce a\ndiffusion-fueled SFR model termed $\\text{ID}^3$. $\\text{ID}^3$ employs an\nID-preserving loss to generate diverse yet identity-consistent facial\nappearances. Theoretically, we show that minimizing this loss is equivalent to\nmaximizing the lower bound of an adjusted conditional log-likelihood over\nID-preserving data. This equivalence motivates an ID-preserving sampling\nalgorithm, which operates over an adjusted gradient vector field, enabling the\ngeneration of fake face recognition datasets that approximate the distribution\nof real-world faces.

We find the inference\nof local electronic properties to improve significantly when training models on\naugmented data that appropriately expose local functional features.

Our model is grounded in the theory of planned\nbehavior -- a well-established conceptual framework in social psychology that\nlinks intrinsic beliefs to behavior. By incorporating temporal biases in social\nperception and individual differences in decision-making processes into our\nmodel, we find that the interplay between internal and external drivers of\nbehavior can produce diverse outcomes, ranging from partial participation in\ncollective action to rapid or delayed cascades of action-taking. These distinct\noutcomes are preceded by transient dynamics that are qualitatively similar to\none another, which, just as in real-world scenarios, makes it difficult to\npredict long-term collective dynamics from early observations.

Recent research on multi-distribution learning,\nfocusing on binary loss and finite VC dimension classes, has shown near-optimal\nsample complexity that is achieved with oracle efficient algorithms. That is,\nthese algorithms are computationally efficient given an efficient ERM for the\nclass. Unlike in classical PAC learning, where the optimal sample complexity is\nachieved with deterministic predictors, current multi-distribution learning\nalgorithms output randomized predictors. This raises the question: can these\nalgorithms be derandomized to produce a deterministic predictor for multiple\ndistributions? Through a reduction to discrepancy minimization, we show that\nderandomizing multi-distribution learning is computationally hard, even when\nERM is computationally efficient. On the positive side, we identify a\nstructural condition enabling an efficient black-box reduction, converting\nexisting randomized multi-distribution predictors into deterministic ones.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion models are cutting-edge generative models adept at producing\ndiverse, high-quality images. Despite their effectiveness, these models often\nrequire significant computational resources owing to their numerous sequential\ndenoising steps and the significant inference cost of each step. Recently,\nNeural Architecture Search (NAS) techniques have been employed to automatically\nsearch for faster generation processes. However, NAS for diffusion is\ninherently time-consuming as it requires estimating thousands of diffusion\nmodels to search for the optimal one. In this paper, we introduce Flexiffusion,\na novel training-free NAS paradigm designed to accelerate diffusion models by\nconcurrently optimizing generation steps and network structures. Specifically,\nwe partition the generation process into isometric step segments, each\nsequentially composed of a full step, multiple partial steps, and several null\nsteps. The full step computes all network blocks, while the partial step\ninvolves part of the blocks, and the null step entails no computation.\nFlexiffusion autonomously explores flexible step combinations for each segment,\nsubstantially reducing search costs and enabling greater acceleration compared\nto the state-of-the-art (SOTA) method for diffusion models. Our searched models\nreported speedup factors of $2.6\\times$ and $1.5\\times$ for the original\nLDM-4-G and the SOTA, respectively. The factors for Stable Diffusion V1.5 and\nthe SOTA are $5.1\\times$ and $2.0\\times$. We also verified the performance of\nFlexiffusion on multiple datasets, and positive experiment results indicate\nthat Flexiffusion can effectively reduce redundancy in diffusion models.",

One major advantage of LDMs is their\nability to operate in a compressed latent space, allowing for more efficient\ntraining and deployment. However, despite these advantages, challenges with\nLDMs still remain. For example, it has been observed that LDMs often generate\nhigh-frequency details and complex compositions imperfectly. We hypothesize\nthat one reason for these flaws is due to the fact that all pre- and\npost-training of LDMs are done in latent space, which is typically $8 \\times 8$\nlower spatial-resolution than the output images.

However, these solutions often sacrifice accuracy\nfor speed to a great extent, and also have the problems of complex training\nprocess and structural limitations. Thus, we propose a general model\ncompression framework for efficient transformer object tracking, named\nCompressTracker, to reduce model size while preserving tracking accuracy. Our\napproach features a novel stage division strategy that segments the transformer\nlayers of the teacher model into distinct stages to break the limitation of\nmodel structure. Additionally, we also design a unique replacement training\ntechnique that randomly substitutes specific stages in the student model with\nthose from the teacher model, as opposed to training the student model in\nisolation. Replacement training enhances the student model's ability to\nreplicate the teacher model's behavior and simplifies the training process. To\nfurther forcing student model to emulate teacher model, we incorporate\nprediction guidance and stage-wise feature mimicking to provide additional\nsupervision during the teacher model's compression process. CompressTracker is\nstructurally agnostic, making it compatible with any transformer architecture.\nWe conduct a series of experiment to verify the effectiveness and\ngeneralizability of our CompressTracker.

With the advancement of\nLarge Language Models (LLMs), researchers have proposed an increasing number of\nLLM-based software testing techniques, particularly in the area of test case\ngeneration. Despite the growing interest, limited efforts have been made to\nthoroughly evaluate the actual capabilities of LLMs in this task.\n  In this paper, we introduce TestBench, a benchmark for class-level LLM-based\ntest case generation. We construct a dataset of 108 Java programs from 9\nreal-world, large-scale projects on GitHub, each representing a different\nthematic domain. We then design three distinct types of prompts based on\ncontext descriptions, including self-contained context, full context, and\nsimple context. Besides, we propose a fine-grained evaluation framework that\nconsiders five aspects of test cases: syntactic correctness, compilation\ncorrectness, test correctness, code coverage rate, and defect detection rate.\nFurthermore, we propose a heuristic algorithm to repair erroneous test cases\ngenerated by LLMs. We evaluate CodeLlama-13b, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 on the\nTestBench, and our experimental results indicate that larger models demonstrate\na greater ability to effectively utilize contextual information, thus\ngenerating higher-quality test cases. Smaller models may struggle with the\nnoise introduced by the extensive information contained within the full\ncontext. However, when using the simplified version, namely the simple context,\nwhich is derived from the full context via abstract syntax tree analysis, the\nperformance of these models improves significantly. Our analysis highlights the\ncurrent progress and pinpoints future directions to further enhance the\neffectiveness of models by handling contextual information for test case\ngeneration.",

Here, we focus on cat qubits stabilized by two-photon\ndissipation, where pairs of photons are added and removed from a harmonic\noscillator by an auxiliary, lossy buffer mode. This process requires a large\nloss rate and strong nonlinearities of the buffer mode that must not degrade\nthe coherence and linearity of the oscillator. In this work, we show how to\novercome this challenge by coloring the loss environment of the buffer mode\nwith a multi-pole filter and optimizing the circuit to take into account\nadditional inductances in the buffer mode. Using these techniques, we achieve\nnear-ideal enhancement of cat-qubit bit-flip times with increasing photon\nnumber, reaching over $0.1$ seconds with a mean photon number of only $4$.\nConcurrently, our cat qubit remains highly phase coherent, with phase-flip\ntimes corresponding to an effective lifetime of $T_{1,\\text{eff}} \\simeq 70$\n$\\mu$s, comparable with the bare oscillator lifetime. We achieve this\nperformance even in the presence of an ancilla transmon, used for reading out\nthe cat qubit states, by engineering a tunable oscillator-ancilla dispersive\ncoupling. Furthermore, the low nonlinearity of the harmonic oscillator mode\nallows us to perform pulsed cat-qubit stabilization, an important control\nprimitive, where the stabilization can remain off for a significant fraction\n(e.g., two thirds) of a $3~\\mathrm{\\mu s}$ cycle without degrading bit-flip\ntimes.

Recently, meta-learning techniques have demonstrated\nsuperior results in OSDG, effectively orchestrating the meta-train and -test\ntasks by employing varied random categories and predefined domain partition\nstrategies. These approaches prioritize a well-designed training schedule over\ntraditional methods that focus primarily on data augmentation and the\nenhancement of discriminative feature learning.

Working with the\nreal-singlet-extended Standard Model, we utilize recent lattice simulations to\nconfirm the existence of first-order phase transitions across the free\nparameter space. For the first time, we account for several important two-loop\ncorrections in the high-temperature expansion for determining thermal\nparameters, including the bubble wall velocity in the local thermal equilibrium\napproximation. We find that the requirement of completing bubble nucleation\nimposes stringent bounds on the new scalar boson mass. Moreover, the prospects\nfor detection by LISA require first-order phase transitions in a two-step phase\ntransition, which display strong sensitivity to the portal coupling between the\nHiggs and the singlet. Interestingly, signals from di-Higgs boson production at\nthe HL-LHC probe parameter regions that significantly overlap with the\nLISA-sensitive region, indicating the possibility of accounting for both\nsignals if detected.

Specifically, we augment the baselines\nwith two additional mask choices (i.e., medium mask and low mask) as our core\ninsight is that the recovery process of an object can manifest in diverse ways.\nPrevious high-masking schemes focus on capturing the global representation but\nlack the fine-grained recovery capability, so that the generated pre-trained\nweights tend to play a limited role in the fine-tuning process. With the\nsupport of the proposed TPM, available methods can exhibit more flexible and\naccurate completion capabilities, enabling the potential autoencoder in the\npre-training stage to consider multiple representations of a single 3D object.\nIn addition, an SVM-guided weight selection module is proposed to fill the\nencoder parameters for downstream networks with the optimal weight during the\nfine-tuning stage, maximizing linear accuracy and facilitating the acquisition\nof intricate representations for new objects.

The transformer architecture utilizes an attention\nmechanism, enabling the proposed method to adeptly model the temporal dynamics\nof user mobility by effectively capturing long-range dependencies within the\ninput data.

In RLHF and DPO, a regularization term is used\nduring the preference optimization process to prevent the policy model from\ndeviating too far from the reference model's distribution, thereby avoiding the\ngeneration of anomalous responses. When the reference model is already\nwell-aligned with the given data or only requires slight adjustments, this\napproach can produce a well-aligned model. However, if the reference model is\nnot aligned with the given data and requires significant deviation from its\ncurrent state, a regularization term may actually hinder the model alignment.\nIn this study, we propose \\textbf{Modulated Intervention Preference\nOptimization (MIPO)} to address this issue. MIPO modulates the degree of\nintervention from the reference model based on how well the given data is\naligned with it. If the data is well-aligned, the intervention is increased to\nprevent the policy model from diverging significantly from reference model.\nConversely, if the alignment is poor, the interference is reduced to facilitate\nmore extensive training. We compare the performance of MIPO and DPO using\nMistral-7B and Llama3-8B in Alpaca Eval 2.0 and MT-Bench.

In this paper we present a grating spectroscopy of a\nGalactic SNR G292.0+1.8, which is claimed to be a Type Ib/c remnant in a binary\nsystem according to recent studies. If G292.0+1.8 was experienced a strong\nmass-loss via binary interactions before its explosion, an oxygen-rich material\nproduced in the He-burning layer is expected to be observed in the central\nbelt-like structure formed by shock-heated CSM. Using the Reflection Grating\nSpectrometer onboard XMM-Newton, we detect N VII Ly$\\alpha$ line (0.50 keV) for\nthe first time in G292.0+1.8 and find that the abundance ratio of nitrogen to\noxygen is significantly lower (N/O$=0.5\\pm0.1$) than the solar value. This low\nN/O suggests that the progenitor of experienced strong mass-loss and ended up\nto a Wolf-Rayet (WR) star exposing the He-burning layer at the pre-supernova.\nComparing our result and the evolution models of single stars and binaries, we\nconclude that the progenitor of G292.0+1.8 experienced strong mass-loss enough\nto occur a Type Ib/c supernova. Our finding is another crucial piece of\nevidence for a stripped-envelope supernova such as Type Ib/c as the origin of\nG292.0+1.8.",

Time compositing methods compare a series of co-registered images and\nretrieve only those pixels that have comparatively lesser cloud cover for the\nresultant image. Two different approaches of time compositing were tested. The\nfirst method recoded the clouds to value 0 on all the constituent images and\nran a 'max' function. The second method directly ran a 'min' function without\nrecoding on all the images for the resultant image. The 'max' function gave a\nhighly mottled image while the 'min' function gave a superior quality image\nwith smoother texture. Persistent clouds on all constituent images were\nretained in both methods, but they were readily identifiable and easily\nextractable in the 'max' function image as they were recoded to 0, while that\nin the 'min' function appeared with varying DN values. Hence a hybrid technique\nwas created which recodes the clouds to value 255 and runs a 'min' function.\nThis method preserved the quality of the 'min' function and the advantage of\nretrieving clouds as in the 'max' function image.

Although some prompting methods, such as Chain-of-Thought, can\nimprove the reasoning ability of LLMs to some extent, they suffer from an\nunfaithful issue where derived conclusions may not align with the generated\nreasoning chain. To address this issue, some studies employ the approach of\npropositional logic to further enhance logical reasoning abilities of LLMs.\nHowever, the potential omissions in the extraction of logical expressions in\nthese methods can cause information loss in the logical reasoning process,\nthereby generating incorrect results. To this end, we propose Logic-of-Thought\n(LoT) prompting which employs propositional logic to generate expanded logical\ninformation descriptions and utilizes them as an additional augmentation to\noriginal contexts, thereby ensuring information completeness and enhancing\nlogical reasoning ability. LoT is orthogonal to existing prompting methods and\ncan be seamlessly integrated with them. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nLoT boosts the performance of various prompting methods with a striking margin\nacross five logical reasoning tasks. In particular, LoT enhances\nChain-of-Thought's performance on the ReClor dataset by +4.35%, improves\nChain-of-Thought with Self-Consistency's performance on the RuleTaker dataset\nby +3.52%, and boosts performance of Tree-of-Thoughts on the ProofWriter\ndataset by +8%.",

In this work, we look at low-rank\nadaptation method from the lens of data privacy. We show theoretically that the\nlow-rank adaptation used in LoRA is equivalent to fine-tuning adapters with\nnoisy batch gradients - just like what DPSGD algorithm does. We also quantify\nthe variance of the injected noise as a decreasing function of adaptation rank.\nBy establishing a Berry-Esseen type bound on the total variation distance\nbetween the injected noise distribution and a Gaussian noise distribution with\nthe same variance, we show that the dynamics of low-rank adaptation is very\nclose to when DPSGD is performed w.r.t the adapters.

Most existing methods use\nindependent image-text encoding and apply complex hand-crafted modules or\nencoder-decoder architectures for modal interaction and query reasoning.\nHowever, their performance significantly drops when dealing with complex\ntextual expressions. This is because the former paradigm only utilizes limited\ndownstream data to fit the multi-modal feature fusion. Therefore, it is only\neffective when the textual expressions are relatively simple. In contrast,\ngiven the wide diversity of textual expressions and the uniqueness of\ndownstream training data, the existing fusion module, which extracts multimodal\ncontent from a visual-linguistic context, has not been fully investigated. In\nthis paper, we present a simple yet robust transformer-based framework, SimVG,\nfor visual grounding. Specifically, we decouple visual-linguistic feature\nfusion from downstream tasks by leveraging existing multimodal pre-trained\nmodels and incorporating additional object tokens to facilitate deep\nintegration of downstream and pre-training tasks. Furthermore, we design a\ndynamic weight-balance distillation method in the multi-branch synchronous\nlearning process to enhance the representation capability of the simpler\nbranch. This branch only consists of a lightweight MLP, which simplifies the\nstructure and improves reasoning speed. Experiments on six widely used VG\ndatasets, i.e., RefCOCO/+/g, ReferIt, Flickr30K, and GRefCOCO, demonstrate the\nsuperiority of SimVG. Finally, the proposed method not only achieves\nimprovements in efficiency and convergence speed but also attains new\nstate-of-the-art performance on these benchmarks.

Pre-training data typically combines\ninformation from multiple domains. To maximize performance when integrating\ndata from various domains, determining the optimal data proportion is\nessential. However, state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs rarely disclose details about\ntheir pre-training data, making it difficult for researchers to identify ideal\ndata proportions. In this paper, we introduce a new topic, \\textit{data\nproportion detection}, which enables the automatic estimation of pre-training\ndata proportions by analyzing the generated outputs of LLMs. We provide\nrigorous theoretical proofs, practical algorithms, and preliminary experimental\nresults for data proportion detection.

Since LLM alignment\nheavily relies on reward models for optimization or evaluation, neglecting the\nquality of reward models may cause unreliable results or even misalignment.\nDespite the vital role reward models play in alignment, previous works have\nconsistently overlooked their performance and used off-the-shelf reward models\narbitrarily without verification, rendering the reward model ``\\emph{an\nelephant in the room}''. To this end, this work first investigates the quality\nof the widely-used preference dataset, HH-RLHF, and curates a clean version,\nCHH-RLHF. Based on CHH-RLHF, we benchmark the accuracy of a broad range of\nreward models used in previous alignment works, unveiling the unreliability of\nusing them both for optimization and evaluation. Furthermore, we systematically\nstudy the impact of reward model quality on alignment performance in three\nreward utilization paradigms. Extensive experiments reveal that better reward\nmodels perform as better human preference proxies. This work aims to awaken\npeople to notice this huge elephant in alignment research. We call attention to\nthe following issues: (1) The reward model needs to be rigorously evaluated,\nwhether for alignment optimization or evaluation.

    "abstract": "Spoken language is often, if not always, understood in a context formed by\nthe identity of the speaker. For example, we can easily make sense of an\nutterance such as \"I'm going to have a manicure this weekend\" or \"The first\ntime I got pregnant I had a hard time\" when spoken by a woman, but it would be\nharder to understand when it is spoken by a man. Previous event-related\npotential (ERP) studies have shown mixed results regarding the\nneurophysiological responses to such speaker-content mismatches, with some\nreporting an N400 effect and others a P600 effect. In an electroencephalography\n(EEG) experiment involving 64 participants, we used social and biological\nmismatches as test cases to demonstrate how these distinct ERP patterns reflect\ndifferent aspects of rational inference. We showed that when the mismatch\ninvolves social stereotypes (e.g., men getting a manicure), listeners can\narrive at a \"literal\" interpretation by integrating the content with their\nsocial knowledge, though this integration requires additional effort due to\nstereotype violations-resulting in an N400 effect. In contrast, when the\nmismatch involves biological knowledge (e.g., men getting pregnant), a\n\"literal\" interpretation becomes impossible, leading listeners to treat the\ninput as potentially containing errors and engage in correction\nprocesses-resulting in a P600 effect. Supporting this rational inference\nframework, we found that the social N400 effect decreased as a function of the\nlistener's personality trait of openness (as more open-minded individuals\nmaintain more flexible social expectations), while the biological P600 effect\nremained robust (as biological constraints are recognized regardless of\nindividual personalities). Our findings help to reconcile the empirical\ninconsistencies and show how rational inference shapes speaker-contextualized\nlanguage comprehension.",

Existing\napproaches, such as the integration of hint condition diagrams via auxiliary\nnetworks (e.g., ControlNet), have made strides towards addressing this issue.\nHowever, diffusion models often fall short in tasks requiring controlled text\ngeneration, such as specifying particular fonts or producing text in small\nfonts. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for multilingual visual\ntext creation, named JoyType, designed to maintain the font style of text\nduring the image generation process. Our methodology begins with assembling a\ntraining dataset, JoyType-1M, comprising 1 million pairs of data. Each pair\nincludes an image, its description, and glyph instructions corresponding to the\nfont style within the image. We then developed a text control network, Font\nControlNet, tasked with extracting font style information to steer the image\ngeneration. To further enhance our model's ability to maintain font style,\nnotably in generating small-font text, we incorporated a multi-layer OCR-aware\nloss into the diffusion process. This enhancement allows JoyType to direct text\nrendering using low-level descriptors. Our evaluations, based on both visual\nand accuracy metrics, demonstrate that JoyType significantly outperforms\nexisting state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, JoyType can function as a\nplugin, facilitating the creation of varied image styles in conjunction with\nother stable diffusion models on HuggingFace and CivitAI.

In particular,\nwe partition the clients into heterogeneous clusters, where the data labels\namong different clients within a cluster are unbalanced while the data labels\namong different clusters are balanced. The cluster heads collect distilled data\nfrom the corresponding cluster members, and conduct model training in\ncollaboration with the server.

We perform a comprehensive analysis of the\nconvergence behavior, communication overhead, and computational complexity of\nthe proposed HFLDD.

From this spot, the spike\nclassification concept commences. Previously, researchers classified spikes\nmanually. The manual classification was not precise enough as it involves\nextensive analysis. Consequently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) was introduced\ninto neuroscience to assist clinicians in classifying spikes correctly.

With language as a medium, our method\nadaptively integrates social events into forecasting models, aligning news\ncontent with time series fluctuations to provide richer insights. Specifically,\nwe utilize LLM-based agents to iteratively filter out irrelevant news and\nemploy human-like reasoning to evaluate predictions. This enables the model to\nanalyze complex events, such as unexpected incidents and shifts in social\nbehavior, and continuously refine the selection logic of news and the\nrobustness of the agent's output. By integrating selected news events with time\nseries data, we fine-tune a pre-trained LLM to predict sequences of digits in\ntime series. The results demonstrate significant improvements in forecasting\naccuracy, suggesting a potential paradigm shift in time series forecasting\nthrough the effective utilization of unstructured news data.",

The current semantic communication systems are\ngenerally modeled as an Auto-Encoder (AE). AE lacks a deep integration of AI\nprinciples with communication strategies due to its inability to effectively\ncapture channel dynamics. This gap makes it difficult to justify the need for\njoint source-channel coding (JSCC) and to explain why performance improves.\nThis paper begins by exploring lossless and lossy communication, highlighting\nthat the inclusion of data distortion distinguishes semantic communication from\nclassical communication. It breaks the conditions for the separation theorem to\nhold and explains why the amount of data transferred by semantic communication\nis less. Therefore, employing JSCC becomes imperative for achieving optimal\nsemantic communication. Moreover, a Variational Source-Channel Coding (VSCC)\nmethod is proposed for constructing semantic communication systems based on\ndata distortion theory, integrating variational inference and channel\ncharacteristics. Using a deep learning network, we develop a semantic\ncommunication system employing the VSCC method and demonstrate its capability\nfor semantic transmission. We also establish semantic communication systems of\nequivalent complexity employing the AE method and the VAE method. Experimental\nresults reveal that the VSCC model offers superior interpretability compared to\nAE model, as it clearly captures the semantic features of the transmitted data,\nrepresented as the variance of latent variables in our experiments. In\naddition, VSCC model exhibits superior semantic transmission capabilities\ncompared to VAE model.

Meanwhile, tremendous efforts\nhave been made in the realm of machine learning to establish the nonlinear\nmapping between neuroimaging data and phenotypic traits. However, the absence\nof neuroscience insight in the current approaches poses significant challenges\nin understanding cognitive behavior from transient neural activities. To\naddress this challenge, we put the spotlight on the coupling mechanism of\nstructural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) by formulating\nsuch network neuroscience question into an expressive graph representation\nlearning problem for high-order topology. Specifically, we introduce the\nconcept of topological detour to characterize how a ubiquitous instance of FC\n(direct link) is supported by neural pathways (detour) physically wired by SC,\nwhich forms a cyclic loop interacted by brain structure and function. In the\nclich\\'e of machine learning, the multi-hop detour pathway underlying SC-FC\ncoupling allows us to devise a novel multi-head self-attention mechanism within\nTransformer to capture multi-modal feature representation from paired graphs of\nSC and FC. Taken together, we propose a biological-inspired deep model, coined\nas NeuroPath, to find putative connectomic feature representations from the\nunprecedented amount of neuroimages, which can be plugged into various\ndownstream applications such as task recognition and disease diagnosis.

The simulation shows the build up of a pre-eruption\ncoronal magnetic field that is close to the nonlinear force-free field (NLFFF)\nextrapolation, and it subsequently develops multiple eruptions. The\nsheared/twisted field lines of the pre-eruption magnetic field show qualitative\nagreement with the brightening loops in the SDO Atmospheric Imaging Assembly\n(AIA) hot passband images.

To address the challenge, we introduce HaloScope, a novel\nlearning framework that leverages the unlabeled LLM generations in the wild for\nhallucination detection. Such unlabeled data arises freely upon deploying LLMs\nin the open world, and consists of both truthful and hallucinated information.\nTo harness the unlabeled data, we present an automated membership estimation\nscore for distinguishing between truthful and untruthful generations within\nunlabeled mixture data, thereby enabling the training of a binary truthfulness\nclassifier on top.

    "abstract": "Many medical image segmentation methods have achieved impressive results.\nYet, most existing methods do not take into account the shape-intensity prior\ninformation. This may lead to implausible segmentation results, in particular\nfor images of unseen datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to\nincorporate joint shape-intensity prior information into the segmentation\nnetwork. Specifically, we first train a segmentation network (regarded as the\nteacher network) on class-wise averaged training images to extract valuable\nshape-intensity information, which is then transferred to a student\nsegmentation network with the same network architecture as the teacher via\nknowledge distillation. In this way, the student network regarded as the final\nsegmentation model can effectively integrate the shape-intensity prior\ninformation, yielding more accurate segmentation results. Despite its\nsimplicity, experiments on five medical image segmentation tasks of different\nmodalities demonstrate that the proposed Shape-Intensity Knowledge Distillation\n(SIKD) consistently improves several baseline models (including recent MaxStyle\nand SAMed) under intra-dataset evaluation, and significantly improves the\ncross-dataset generalization ability.

Current methods typically rely on uncertainty estimation in deep\nensembles to detect anomalies, assuming that ensemble learners should agree on\nnormal samples while exhibiting disagreement on unseen anomalies in the output\nspace. However, these methods may suffer from inadequate disagreement on\nanomalies or diminished agreement on normal samples. To tackle these issues, we\npropose D2UE, a Diversified Dual-space Uncertainty Estimation framework for\nmedical anomaly detection. To effectively balance agreement and disagreement\nfor anomaly detection, we propose Redundancy-Aware Repulsion (RAR), which uses\na similarity kernel that remains invariant to both isotropic scaling and\northogonal transformations, explicitly promoting diversity in learners' feature\nspace. Moreover, to accentuate anomalous regions, we develop Dual-Space\nUncertainty (DSU), which utilizes the ensemble's uncertainty in input and\noutput spaces. In input space, we first calculate gradients of reconstruction\nerror with respect to input images. The gradients are then integrated with\nreconstruction outputs to estimate uncertainty for inputs, enabling effective\nanomaly discrimination even when output space disagreement is minimal.

Instead of developing a new importance criterion, MaskLLM explicitly\nmodels N:M patterns as a learnable distribution through Gumbel Softmax\nsampling. This approach facilitates end-to-end training on large-scale datasets\nand offers two notable advantages: 1) High-quality Masks - our method\neffectively scales to large datasets and learns accurate masks; 2)\nTransferability - the probabilistic modeling of mask distribution enables the\ntransfer learning of sparsity across domains or tasks.

Existing adversarial\ntraining methods apply perturbations of the same magnitude across all users to\nenhance system robustness against attacks. Yet, in reality, we find that\nattacks often affect only a subset of users who are vulnerable. These\nperturbations of indiscriminate magnitude make it difficult to balance\neffective protection for vulnerable users without degrading recommendation\nquality for those who are not affected. To address this issue, our research\ndelves into understanding user vulnerability. Considering that poisoning\nattacks pollute the training data, we note that the higher degree to which a\nrecommender system fits users' training data correlates with an increased\nlikelihood of users incorporating attack information, indicating their\nvulnerability. Leveraging these insights, we introduce the Vulnerability-aware\nAdversarial Training (VAT), designed to defend against poisoning attacks in\nrecommender systems. VAT employs a novel vulnerability-aware function to\nestimate users' vulnerability based on the degree to which the system fits\nthem. Guided by this estimation, VAT applies perturbations of adaptive\nmagnitude to each user, not only reducing the success ratio of attacks but also\npreserving, and potentially enhancing, the quality of recommendations.\nComprehensive experiments confirm VAT's superior defensive capabilities across\ndifferent recommendation models and against various types of attacks.",

While the challenges of applying GNNs\nfor node classification when class labels display strong heterophily are well\nunderstood, it is unclear how heterophily affects GNN performance in other\nimportant graph learning tasks where class labels are not available. In this\nwork, we focus on the link prediction task and systematically analyze the\nimpact of heterophily in node features on GNN performance. Theoretically, we\nfirst introduce formal definitions of homophilic and heterophilic link\nprediction tasks, and present a theoretical framework that highlights the\ndifferent optimizations needed for the respective tasks. We then analyze how\ndifferent link prediction encoders and decoders adapt to varying levels of\nfeature homophily and introduce designs for improved performance.

We extend and tailor the\nt-splitting variant of PMR specifically for the interior of a Kerr black hole\non the axis of rotation, focusing on a minimally-coupled massless scalar field\nin the physically-motivated Unruh state. The method addresses unique challenges\nin the black hole interior that do not occur outside. In particular, while the\ninfinite sum over multipolar number l converges in the black hole exterior, it\ndiverges in the interior, necessitating the subtraction of a so-called\nintermediate divergence which includes introducing an additional \"small\" split\nin the direction of the polar angle. This procedure is outlined and justified,\nalong with the standard PMR method's counterterms subtraction. We apply this\nmethod to calculate the renormalized energy-momentum fluxes $\\langle\nT_{uu}\\rangle^U_\\text{ren}$, $\\langle T_{vv}\\rangle^U_\\text{ren}$ (where u and\nv are the standard Eddington coordinates) and the renormalized field square\n$\\langle \\Phi^2\\rangle^U_\\text{ren}$ throughout the black hole interior,\nspanning from (just off) the event horizon to (just off) the inner horizon.\nSpecial emphasis is placed on the inner horizon vicinity, where our t-splitting\nresults for the fluxes asymptote to those obtained directly at the inner\nhorizon using a different method in a previous work.

In this\npaper, we decompose ranking relevance into content-based and engagement-based\naspects, and we propose to leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for both label\nand feature generation in model training, primarily aiming to improve the\nmodel's predictive capability for content-based relevance. Additionally, we\nintroduce different sigmoid transformations on the LLM outputs to polarize\nrelevance scores in labeling, enhancing the model's ability to balance\ncontent-based and engagement-based relevances and thus prioritize highly\nrelevant items overall. Comprehensive online tests and offline evaluations are\nalso conducted for the proposed design.

    "abstract": "Despite advancements in Neural Implicit models for 3D surface reconstruction,\nhandling dynamic environments with interactions between arbitrary rigid,\nnon-rigid, or deformable entities remains challenging. The generic\nreconstruction methods adaptable to such dynamic scenes often require\nadditional inputs like depth or optical flow or rely on pre-trained image\nfeatures for reasonable outcomes. These methods typically use latent codes to\ncapture frame-by-frame deformations. Another set of dynamic scene\nreconstruction methods, are entity-specific, mostly focusing on humans, and\nrelies on template models. In contrast, some template-free methods bypass these\nrequirements and adopt traditional LBS (Linear Blend Skinning) weights for a\ndetailed representation of deformable object motions, although they involve\ncomplex optimizations leading to lengthy training times. To this end, as a\nremedy, this paper introduces TFS-NeRF, a template-free 3D semantic NeRF for\ndynamic scenes captured from sparse or single-view RGB videos, featuring\ninteractions among two entities and more time-efficient than other LBS-based\napproaches. Our framework uses an Invertible Neural Network (INN) for LBS\nprediction, simplifying the training process. By disentangling the motions of\ninteracting entities and optimizing per-entity skinning weights, our method\nefficiently generates accurate, semantically separable geometries. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our approach produces high-quality reconstructions\nof both deformable and non-deformable objects in complex interactions, with\nimproved training efficiency compared to existing methods.",

    "abstract": "The rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened up new\nopportunities across various domains and applications; yet it also presents\nchallenges related to potential misuse. To mitigate such risks, red teaming has\nbeen employed as a proactive security measure to probe language models for\nharmful outputs via jailbreak attacks. However, current jailbreak attack\napproaches are single-turn with explicit malicious queries that do not fully\ncapture the complexity of real-world interactions. In reality, users can engage\nin multi-turn interactions with LLM-based chat assistants, allowing them to\nconceal their true intentions in a more covert manner. To bridge this gap, we,\nfirst, propose a new jailbreak approach, RED QUEEN ATTACK. This method\nconstructs a multi-turn scenario, concealing the malicious intent under the\nguise of preventing harm. We craft 40 scenarios that vary in turns and select\n14 harmful categories to generate 56k multi-turn attack data points. We conduct\ncomprehensive experiments on the RED QUEEN ATTACK with four representative LLM\nfamilies of different sizes. Our experiments reveal that all LLMs are\nvulnerable to RED QUEEN ATTACK, reaching 87.62% attack success rate on GPT-4o\nand 75.4% on Llama3-70B. Further analysis reveals that larger models are more\nsusceptible to the RED QUEEN ATTACK, with multi-turn structures and concealment\nstrategies contributing to its success. To prioritize safety, we introduce a\nstraightforward mitigation strategy called RED QUEEN GUARD, which aligns LLMs\nto effectively counter adversarial attacks. This approach reduces the attack\nsuccess rate to below 1% while maintaining the model's performance across\nstandard benchmarks.

    "abstract": "Few-shot Segmentation (FSS) aims to segment the interested objects in the\nquery image with just a handful of labeled samples (i.e., support images).\nPrevious schemes would leverage the similarity between support-query pixel\npairs to construct the pixel-level semantic correlation. However, in remote\nsensing scenarios with extreme intra-class variations and cluttered\nbackgrounds, such pixel-level correlations may produce tremendous mismatches,\nresulting in semantic ambiguity between the query foreground (FG) and\nbackground (BG) pixels. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel Agent Mining\nTransformer (AgMTR), which adaptively mines a set of local-aware agents to\nconstruct agent-level semantic correlation. Compared with pixel-level\nsemantics, the given agents are equipped with local-contextual information and\npossess a broader receptive field. At this point, different query pixels can\nselectively aggregate the fine-grained local semantics of different agents,\nthereby enhancing the semantic clarity between query FG and BG pixels.\nConcretely, the Agent Learning Encoder (ALE) is first proposed to erect the\noptimal transport plan that arranges different agents to aggregate support\nsemantics under different local regions. Then, for further optimizing the\nagents, the Agent Aggregation Decoder (AAD) and the Semantic Alignment Decoder\n(SAD) are constructed to break through the limited support set for mining\nvaluable class-specific semantics from unlabeled data sources and the query\nimage itself, respectively. Extensive experiments on the remote sensing\nbenchmark iSAID indicate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance.

Recently, SR methods have been developed that not\nonly increase resolution while preserving the original image information but\nalso enhance the perceived quality. However, evaluating the quality of SR\nimages generated from low-quality sources, such as SR-enhanced broadcast\ncontent, is challenging due to the need to consider both distortions and\nimprovements. Additionally, assessing SR image quality without original\nhigh-quality sources presents another significant challenge.

In this work, we\nintroduce a new IQA dataset for SR broadcast images in both 2K and 4K\nresolutions.

Recent\ntheoretical work established lower bounds for stochastic fluctuations in cells\nfor broad classes of cellular processes by analyzing the dynamics of reaction\nmotifs that are embedded within a larger network with arbitrary interactions\nand dynamics. For example, a class of generalized assembly processes in which\ntwo co-regulated subunits irreversibly form a complex was shown to exhibit an\nunavoidable trade-off between assembly efficiency and subunit fluctuations:\nRegardless of rate constants and details of feedback control, subunit\nfluctuations were shown to diverge as the assembly efficiency approaches 100%.\nIn contrast, other work has reported how efficient assembly processes work as\nstochastic noise filters or can achieve robust adaptation through integral\ncontrol. While all of these results are technically correct their seemingly\ncontradictory conclusions raise the question of how broadly applicable the\npreviously reported efficiency-fluctuation trade-off is. Here, we show that a\nmuch broader class of assembly processes than previously considered is subject\nto an efficiency-fluctuation trade-off which diverges in the high efficiency\nregime. We find the proposed noise filtering property of efficient assembly\nprocesses corresponds to a singular limit of this class of systems.\nAdditionally, we show that combining feedback control with distinct subunit\nsynthesis rates is a necessary condition to overcome the generalized\nefficiency-fluctuation trade-off. Through numerical examples, we show that\nbiomolecular integral controllers are one of several realizations of such\ncontrol. How small a change to joint subunit control is sufficient to avoid\ndiverging fluctuations in the high-efficiency limit remains an open question.",

    "abstract": "Accurate traffic prediction faces significant challenges, necessitating a\ndeep understanding of both temporal and spatial cues and their complex\ninteractions across multiple variables. Recent advancements in traffic\nprediction systems are primarily due to the development of complex\nsequence-centric models. However, existing approaches often embed multiple\nvariables and spatial relationships at each time step, which may hinder\neffective variable-centric learning, ultimately leading to performance\ndegradation in traditional traffic prediction tasks. To overcome these\nlimitations, we introduce variable-centric and prior knowledge-centric modeling\ntechniques. Specifically, we propose a Heterogeneous Mixture of Experts (TITAN)\nmodel for traffic flow prediction. TITAN initially consists of three experts\nfocused on sequence-centric modeling. Then, designed a low-rank adaptive\nmethod, TITAN simultaneously enables variable-centric modeling. Furthermore, we\nsupervise the gating process using a prior knowledge-centric modeling strategy\nto ensure accurate routing. Experiments on two public traffic network datasets,\nMETR-LA and PEMS-BAY, demonstrate that TITAN effectively captures\nvariable-centric dependencies while ensuring accurate routing. Consequently, it\nachieves improvements in all evaluation metrics, ranging from approximately\n4.37\\% to 11.53\\%, compared to previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) models.

However, it is common\npractice in imitation learning for cameras to be fixed in place, resulting in\nissues like occlusion and limited field of view. Furthermore, cameras are often\nplaced in broad, general locations, without an effective viewpoint specific to\nthe robot's task. In this work, we investigate the utility of active vision\n(AV) for imitation learning and manipulation, in which, in addition to the\nmanipulation policy, the robot learns an AV policy from human demonstrations to\ndynamically change the robot's camera viewpoint to obtain better information\nabout its environment and the given task. We introduce AV-ALOHA, a new bimanual\nteleoperation robot system with AV, an extension of the ALOHA 2 robot system,\nincorporating an additional 7-DoF robot arm that only carries a stereo camera\nand is solely tasked with finding the best viewpoint. This camera streams\nstereo video to an operator wearing a virtual reality (VR) headset, allowing\nthe operator to control the camera pose using head and body movements. The\nsystem provides an immersive teleoperation experience, with bimanual\nfirst-person control, enabling the operator to dynamically explore and search\nthe scene and simultaneously interact with the environment. We conduct\nimitation learning experiments of our system both in real-world and in\nsimulation, across a variety of tasks that emphasize viewpoint planning.
