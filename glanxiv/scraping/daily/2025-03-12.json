    "abstract": "In 2021, Brock, Elkies, and Jordan generalized the theory of periodic\ncontinued fractions (PCFs) over $\\mathbb{Z}$ to the ring of integers in a\nnumber field. In particular, they considered the case where the number field is\nan intermediate field of the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-extension over $\\mathbb{Q}$ and\nasked whether a $(N, \\ell)$-type PCF for $X_n = 2\\cos(2\\pi/2^{n+2})$ exists. In\nthis paper, we construct $(1,2)$ and $(0,3)$-type PCFs for $X_n$ for all\n$n\\geq1$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first explicit construction\nof type (0,3) continued fractions for all $n\\geq1$. To obtain such results, for\neach type, we construct a bijection between a certain subset of the group of\nrelative units in each layer of the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-extension and the set of\nPCFs for $X_n$. While our result confirms the existence of such PCFs for all\n$n\\geq1$ in types $(1,2)$ and $(0,3)$, determining all PCFs remains an open\nproblem. The bijections constructed in our result translate this problem into\nthe study of the subsets of the relative units. As a second main result, we\ngive explicit bounds for the logarithms of the relative units corresponding to\n$(1,2)$ or $(0,3)$-type PCFs for $X_n$. These bounds allow us to explain\ninteresting phenomena observed in the distribution of such points.",

    "abstract": "We present a work optimal algorithm for parallel fully batch-dynamic maximal\nmatching against an oblivious adversary. In particular it processes batches of\nupdates (either insertions or deletions of edges) in constant expected\namortized work per edge update, and in $O(\\log^3 m)$ depth per batch whp, where\n$m$ is the maximum number of edges in the graph over time. This greatly\nimproves on the recent result by Ghaffari and Trygub (2024) that requires\n$O(\\log^9 m)$ amortized work per update and $O(\\log^4 m )$ depth per batch,\nboth whp. The algorithm can also be used for hyperedge maximal matching. For\nhypergraphs with rank $r$ (maximum cardinality of any edge) the algorithm\nsupports batches of insertions and deletions with $O(r^3)$ expected amortized\nwork per edge update, and $O(\\log^3 m)$ depth per batch whp. This is a factor\nof $O(r)$ work off of the best sequential algorithm, Assadi and Solomon (2021),\nwhich uses $O(r^2)$ work per update. Ghaffari and Trygub's parallel\nbatch-dynamic algorithm on hypergraphs requires $O(r^8 \\log^9 m)$ amortized\nwork per edge update whp. We leverage ideas from the prior algorithms but\nintroduce substantial new ideas. Furthermore, our algorithm is relatively\nsimple, perhaps even simpler than the sequential hyperedge algorithm. We also\npresent the first work-efficient algorithm for maximal matching on hypergraphs.\nFor a hypergraph with total cardinality $m'$ (i.e., sum over the cardinality of\neach edge), the algorithm runs in $O(m')$ work in expectation and $O(\\log^2 m)$\ndepth whp. The algorithm also has some properties that allow us to use it as a\nsubroutine in the dynamic algorithm to select random edges in the graph to add\nto the matching.",

Recently, personalization or on-device model fine-tuning\nhas shown that adaptation of ASR models towards target user speech improves\ntheir performance over rare words or accented speech. Despite these gains,\nfine-tuning on user data (target domain) risks the personalized model to forget\nknowledge about its original training distribution (source domain) i.e.\ncatastrophic forgetting, leading to subpar general ASR performance. A simple\nand efficient approach to combat catastrophic forgetting is to measure\nforgetting via a validation set that represents the source domain distribution.\nHowever, such validation sets are large and impractical for mobile devices.\nTowards this, we propose a novel method to subsample a substantially large\nvalidation set into a smaller one while maintaining the ability to estimate\nforgetting. We demonstrate the efficacy of such a dataset in mitigating\nforgetting by utilizing it to dynamically determine the number of ideal\nfine-tuning epochs. When measuring the deviations in per user fine-tuning\nepochs against a 50x larger validation set (oracle), our method achieves a\nlower mean-absolute-error (3.39) compared to randomly selected subsets of the\nsame size (3.78-8.65).

However, the performance of\ndata-driven EO applications is heavily influenced by the data collection and\ntransmission processes, where limited satellite bandwidth and latency\nconstraints can hinder the full transmission of original data to the receivers.\nTo address this issue, adopting the concepts of Semantic Communication (SC)\noffers a promising solution by prioritizing the transmission of essential data\nsemantics over raw information.

Semantic losses are estimated by\nevaluating the accuracy of EO applications using four task-oriented ML models,\nEfficientViT, MobileViT, ResNet50-DINO, and ResNet8-KD, on lossy image datasets\nunder varying channel conditions and compression ratios.

The 2011 i2b2 challenge involves coreference\nresolution in medical documents. Concept mentions have been annotated in\nclinical texts, and the mentions that co-refer in each document are to be\nlinked by coreference chains. Normally, there are two ways of constructing a\nsystem to automatically discover co-referent links. One is to manually build\nrules for co-reference resolution, and the other category of approaches is to\nuse machine learning systems to learn automatically from training datasets and\nthen perform the resolution task on testing datasets. Results: Experiments show\nthe existing co-reference resolution systems are able to find some of the\nco-referent links, and our rule based system performs well finding the majority\nof the co-referent links. Our system achieved 89.6% overall performance on\nmultiple medical datasets. Conclusion: The experiment results show that\nmanually crafted rules based on observation of training data is a valid way to\naccomplish high performance in this coreference resolution task for the\ncritical biomedical domain.",

Determining the\ncomposition using standard geophysical methods has been a challenge. The\noscillations of atmospheric neutrinos, influenced by their weak interactions\nwith terrestrial matter, offer a new way to gather valuable information about\nthe Earth's internal structure and, in particular, to constrain the core\ncomposition. If neutrinos had as yet unknown non-standard interactions (NSI),\nthis could affect their propagation in matter and consequently impact studies\nof Earth's composition using neutrino oscillation tomography. This study\nfocuses on scalar-mediated NSI and their potential impact on atmospheric\nneutrino oscillations, which could obscure information about the hydrogen\ncontent in the outer core. In turn, compositional uncertainties could affect\nthe characterization of NSI parameters. The analysis is based on a Monte-Carlo\nsimulation of the energy distribution and azimuthal angles of\nneutrino-generated $\\mu$ events. Using a model of the Earth consisting of 55\nconcentric shells with constant densities determined from the PREM, we evaluate\nthe effect on the number of events due to changes in the outer core composition\n(Z/A)$_{oc}$ and the NSI strength parameter $\\epsilon$.

Among\nthese, Density Matrix Embedding Theory (DMET) is an efficient approach that\nenforces self-consistency at the level of one-particle reduced density matrices\n(1-RDMs), facilitating applications across diverse quantum systems. However,\nconventional DMET is constrained by the requirement that the global 1-RDM\n(low-level descriptor) be an orthogonal projector, limiting flexibility in bath\nconstruction and potentially impeding accuracy in strongly correlated regimes.\nIn this work, we introduce a generalized DMET framework in which the low-level\ndescriptor can be an arbitrary 1-RDM and the bath construction is based on\noptimizing a quantitative criterion related to the maximal disentanglement\nbetween different fragments. This yields an alternative yet controllable bath\nspace construction for generic 1-RDMs, lifting a key limitation of conventional\nDMET. We demonstrate its consistency with conventional DMET in appropriate\nlimits and exploring its implications for bath construction, downfolding\n(impurity Hamiltonian construction), low-level solvers, and adaptive\nfragmentation.

Recent works introduce self-supervised cross-modal\nknowledge distillation (KD) as a way to transfer these powerful generalization\ncapabilities into 3D LiDAR-based models. However, they either rely on highly\ncomplex distillation losses, pseudo-semantic maps, or limit KD to features\nuseful for semantic segmentation only. In this work, we propose\nCleverDistiller, a self-supervised, cross-modal 2D-to-3D KD framework\nintroducing a set of simple yet effective design choices: Unlike contrastive\napproaches relying on complex loss design choices, our method employs a direct\nfeature similarity loss in combination with a multi layer perceptron (MLP)\nprojection head to allow the 3D network to learn complex semantic dependencies\nthroughout the projection. Crucially, our approach does not depend on\npseudo-semantic maps, allowing for direct knowledge transfer from a VFM without\nexplicit semantic supervision. Additionally, we introduce the auxiliary\nself-supervised spatial task of occupancy prediction to enhance the semantic\nknowledge, obtained from a VFM through KD, with 3D spatial reasoning\ncapabilities. Experiments on standard autonomous driving benchmarks for\n2D-to-3D KD demonstrate that CleverDistiller achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance in both semantic segmentation and 3D object detection (3DOD) by up\nto 10% mIoU, especially when fine tuning on really low data amounts, showing\nthe effectiveness of our simple yet powerful KD strategy",

While prior works use large\nlanguage models (LLMs) or vision-language models (VLMs) to generate rewards,\nthese approaches are largely limited to simple tasks with well-defined rewards,\nsuch as pick-and-place. This limitation arises because LLMs struggle to\ninterpret complex scenes compressed into text or code due to their restricted\ninput modality, while VLM-based rewards, though better at visual perception,\nremain limited by their less expressive output modality.

    "abstract": "A well-known expression for the saturation throughput of heterogeneous\ntransmitting nodes in a wireless network using p-CSMA, derived from Renewal\nTheory, implicitly assumes that all transmitting nodes are in range of, and\ntherefore conflicting with, each other. This expression, as well as simple\nmodifications of it, does not correctly capture the saturation throughput\nvalues when an arbitrary topology is specified for the conflict graph between\ntransmitting links. For example, we show numerically that calculations based on\nrenewal theory can underestimate throughput by 48-62% for large packet sizes\nwhen the conflict graph is represented by a star topology. This is problematic\nbecause real-world wireless networks, such as wireless IoT mesh networks, are\noften deployed over a large area, resulting in non-complete conflict graphs.\n  To address this gap, we present a computational approach based on a novel\nMarkov chain formulation that yields the exact saturation throughput for each\nnode in the general network case for any given set of access probabilities, as\nwell as a more compact expression for the special case where the packet length\nis twice the slot length. Using our approach, we show how the transmit\nprobabilities could be optimized to maximize weighted utility functions of the\nsaturation throughput values. This would allow a wireless system designer to\nset transmit probabilities to achieve desired throughput trade-offs in any\ngiven deployment.",

We investigate the effectiveness of DINO\nrepresentations and slot-based methods for multi-object instance retrieval. Our\nfindings reveal that DINO representations excel at capturing global object\nattributes such as object shape and size, but struggle with object-level\ndetails like colour, whereas slot-based representations struggle at both global\nand object-level understanding.

This study investigates the challenges faced by human\nRemote Drivers (RDs) during remote driving, particularly focusing on the\nidentification and classification of human performance-related challenges\nthrough a comprehensive analysis of real-world remote driving data Las Vegas.\nFor this purpose, a total of 183 RD performance-related Safety Driver (SD)\ninterventions were analyzed and classified using an introduced severity\nclassification. As it is essential to prevent the need for SD interventions,\nthis study identified and analyzed harsh driving events to detect an increased\nlikelihood of interventions by the SD. In addition, the results of the\nsubjective RD questionnaire are used to evaluate whether the objective metrics\nfrom SD interventions and harsh driving events can also be confirmed by the RDs\nand whether additional challenges can be uncovered. The analysis reveals\nlearning curves, showing a significant decrease in SD interventions as RD\nexperience increases. Early phases of remote driving experience, especially\nbelow 200 km of experience, showed the highest frequency of safety-related\nevents, including braking late for traffic signs and responding impatiently to\nother traffic participants. Over time, RDs follow defined rules for improving\ntheir control, with experience leading to less harsh braking, acceleration, and\nsteering maneuvers. The study contributes to understanding the requirements of\nRDS, emphasizing the importance of targeted training to address human\nperformance limitations. It further highlights the need for system improvements\nto address challenges like latency and the limited haptic feedback replaced by\nvisual feedback, which affect the RDs' perception and vehicle control.",

As-made materials were characterized using\nvarious techniques, including XRPD, SEM, TEM, XAS, and XPS. Detailed\ninvestigation of the local atomic structure of the synthesized Bi2Te3 and\nSb2Te3 powder samples was conducted through synchrotron radiation XAS\nexperiments. The sintered TE materials exhibited low thermal conductivity,\nachieving the highest TE figure-of-merit values of 0.7 (573 K) and 0.9 (523 K)\nfor n-type Bi2Te3 and p-type Sb2Te3, respectively, shifted significantly to the\nhigh-temperature region when compared to earlier reports, highlighting their\npotential for power generation applications. The scalable, energyand\ntime-efficient synthetic method developed, along with the demonstration of its\npotential for TE materials, opens the door for a wider application of these\nmaterials with minimal environmental impact.",

    "abstract": "Spatially varying electric fields are prevalent throughout nature and\ntechnology, arising from heterogeneity inherent to all physical systems.\nInhomogeneous electric fields can originate naturally, such as in nanoporous\nmaterials and biological membranes, or be engineered, e.g., with patterned\nelectrodes or layered van der Waals heterostructures. While uniform fields\ncause free ions to migrate, for polar fluids they simply act to reorient the\nconstituent molecules. In contrast, electric field gradients (EFGs) induce a\ndielectrophoretic force, offering exquisite electrokinetic control of a fluid,\neven in the absence of free charge carriers. EFGs, therefore, offer vast\npotential for optimizing fluid behavior under confinement, such as in\nnanoporous electrodes, nanofluidic devices, and chemical separation materials.\nYet, EFGs remain largely unexplored at the microscopic level owing to the\nabsence of a rigorous, first principles theoretical treatment of\nelectrostrictive effects. By integrating state-of-the-art advances in liquid\nstate theory and deep learning, we reveal how EFGs modulate fluid structure and\ncapillary phenomena. We demonstrate, from first principles, that\ndielectrophoretic coupling enables tunable control over the liquid-gas phase\ntransition, capillary condensation, and fluid uptake into porous media. Our\nfindings establish \"dielectrocapillarity'' -- the use of EFGs to control\nconfined fluids -- as a powerful tool for controlling volumetric capacity in\nnanopores, which holds immense potential for optimizing energy storage in\nsupercapacitors, selective gas separation, and tunable hysteresis in\nneuromorphic nanofluidic devices.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we explore the dynamic relationship between income inequality\nand economic mobility through a pairing of a population-scale partial\ndifferential equation (PDE) model and an associated individual-based stochastic\ndifferential equation (SDE) model. We focus on two fundamental mechanisms of\nincome growth: (1) that annual growth is percentile-dependent, and (2) that\nthere is intrinsic variability from one individual to the next. Under these two\nassumptions, we show that increased economic mobility does not necessarily\nimply decreased income inequality. In fact, we show that the mechanism that\ndirectly enhances mobility, intrinsic variability, simultaneously increases\ninequality.\n  Using Growth Incidence Curves, and other summary statistics like mean income\nand the Gini coefficient, we calibrate our model to US Census data (1968-2021)\nand show that there are multiple parameter settings that produce the same\ngrowth in inequality over time. Strikingly, these parameter settings produce\ndramatically different mobility outcomes. Naturally, the greater disparity\nthere is between annual percentage growth in the upper and lower income levels,\nthe less ability there is for individuals to climb the percentile ranks over a\nfixed period of time. However, more than this, the model shows that whatever\nmobility does exist, it decreases substantially over time. In other words,\nwhile it may remain true that opportunity to reach the upper ranks\nmathematically persists in the long run, that long run gets longer and longer\nevery year.",

Speech\npredominantly dictates the coarse motion trends of the lip region, while\nspecific styles determine the details of lip motion and the overall facial\nexpressions. Prior works lack fine-grained learning in style modeling and do\nnot adequately consider style biases across varying speech conditions, which\nreduce the accuracy of style modeling and hamper the adaptation capability to\nunseen speakers. To address this, we propose a novel framework, StyleSpeaker,\nwhich explicitly extracts speaking styles based on speaker characteristics\nwhile accounting for style biases caused by different speeches. Specifically,\nwe utilize a style encoder to capture speakers' styles from facial motions and\nenhance them according to motion preferences elicited by varying speech\nconditions. The enhanced styles are then integrated into the coarse motion\nfeatures via a style infusion module, which employs a set of style primitives\nto learn fine-grained style representation. Throughout training, we maintain\nthis set of style primitives to comprehensively model the entire style space.\nHence, StyleSpeaker possesses robust style modeling capability for seen\nspeakers and can rapidly adapt to unseen speakers without fine-tuning.\nAdditionally, we design a trend loss and a local contrastive loss to improve\nthe synchronization between synthesized motions and speeches.

Despite a host\nof challenges, ROLSES-1 managed to collect a small amount of data over\nfractions of one day during cruise phase and two days on the lunar surface with\nfour monopole stacer antennas that were in a non-ideal deployment. All antennas\nrecorded shortwave radio transmissions breaking through the Earth's ionosphere\n-- or terrestrial technosignatures -- from spectral and raw waveform data.\nThese technosignatures appear to be modulated by density fluctuations in the\nEarth's ionosphere and could be used as markers when searching for\nextraterrestrial intelligence from habitable exoplanets. After data reduction\nand marshaling a host of statistical and sampling techniques, five minutes of\nraw waveforms from the least noisy antenna were used to generate covariances\nconstraining both the antenna parameters and the amplitude of the low-frequency\nisotropic galactic spectrum. ROLSES- 2 and LuSEE-Night, both lunar radio\ntelescopes launching later in the decade, will have significant upgrades from\nROLSES-1 and will be set to take unprecedented measurements of the\nlow-frequency sky, lunar surface, and constrain the cosmological 21-cm signal.\nROLSES-1 represents a trailblazer for lunar radio telescopes, and many of the\nstatistical tools and data reduction techniques presented in this work will be\ninvaluable for upcoming lunar radio telescope missions.",

Initially all individuals represent different types. The basic\nquestion is: what is the time $T_N$ until one type takes over the population?\nThis time is known as consensus time in computer science and as total\ncoalescent time in evolutionary biology. For the complete graph, it is known\nthat $T_N$ is quadratic in $N$ for db and bd. For the cycle, we prove that\n$T_N$ is cubic in $N$ for db and bd.

Next, we examined some key challenges in Machine Learning,\nsuch as models learning too much from specific examples (overfitting), not\nlearning enough (underfitting), and reflecting biases in the data used. Moving\nbeyond centralized systems, we looked at decentralized Machine Learning and its\nbenefits, like keeping data private, getting answers faster, and using a wider\nvariety of data sources.

    "abstract": "Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved remarkable success in standard RGB\nimage processing tasks. However, applying ViTs to multi-channel imaging (MCI)\ndata, e.g., for medical and remote sensing applications, remains a challenge.\nIn particular, MCI data often consist of layers acquired from different\nmodalities. Directly training ViTs on such data can obscure complementary\ninformation and impair the performance. In this paper, we introduce a simple\nyet effective pretraining framework for large-scale MCI datasets. Our method,\nnamed Isolated Channel ViT (IC-ViT), patchifies image channels individually and\nthereby enables pretraining for multimodal multi-channel tasks. We show that\nthis channel-wise patchifying is a key technique for MCI processing. More\nimportantly, one can pretrain the IC-ViT on single channels and finetune it on\ndownstream multi-channel datasets. This pretraining framework captures\ndependencies between patches as well as channels and produces robust feature\nrepresentation. Experiments on various tasks and benchmarks, including JUMP-CP\nand CHAMMI for cell microscopy imaging, and So2Sat-LCZ42 for satellite imaging,\nshow that the proposed IC-ViT delivers 4-14 percentage points of performance\nimprovement over existing channel-adaptive approaches. Further, its efficient\ntraining makes it a suitable candidate for large-scale pretraining of\nfoundation models on heterogeneous data.",

    "abstract": "This paper offers a new privacy approach for the growing ecosystem of\nservices -- ranging from open banking to healthcare -- dependent on sensitive\npersonal data sharing between individuals and third parties. While these\nservices offer significant benefits, individuals want control over their data,\ntransparency regarding how their data is used, and accountability from third\nparties for misuse. However, existing legal and technical mechanisms are\ninadequate for supporting these needs. A comprehensive approach to the modern\nprivacy challenges of accountable third-party data sharing requires a closer\nalignment of technical system architecture and legal institutional design. In\norder to achieve this privacy alignment, we extend traditional security threat\nmodeling and analysis to encompass a broader range of privacy notions than has\nbeen typically considered. In particular, we introduce the concept of\ncovert-accountability, which addresses the risk from adversaries that may act\ndishonestly but nevertheless face potential identification and legal\nconsequences. As a concrete instance of this design approach, we present the\nOTrace protocol, designed to provide traceable, accountable, consumer-control\nin third-party data sharing ecosystems. OTrace empowers consumers with the\nknowledge of who has their data, what it is being used for, what consent or\nother legal terms apply, and whom it is being shared with.

Unlike traditional methods that rely on expert\ndemonstrations or human-annotated datasets, Vi-LAD performs knowledge\ndistillation and fine-tuning at the intermediate layer representation level\n(i.e., attention maps) by leveraging the backbone of a pre-trained\nvision-action model. These attention maps highlight key navigational regions in\na given scene, which serve as implicit guidance for socially aware motion\nplanning. Vi-LAD fine-tunes a transformer-based model using intermediate\nattention maps extracted from the pre-trained vision-action model, combined\nwith attention-like semantic maps constructed from a large VLM. To achieve\nthis, we introduce a novel attention-level distillation loss that fuses\nknowledge from both sources, generating augmented attention maps with enhanced\nsocial awareness.

To support this growth,\ncloud providers offer ML services to ease the integration of ML components in\nsoftware systems. The evolving business requirements and the popularity of ML\nservices have led practitioners of all skill levels to implement, and maintain\nML service-based systems. However, they may not always adhere to optimal design\nand usage practices for ML cloud services, resulting in common misuse which\ncould significantly degrade the quality of ML service-based systems and\nadversely affect their maintenance and evolution. Though much research has been\nconducted on ML service misuse, a consistent terminology and specification for\nthese misuses remain absent. We therefore conduct in this paper a\ncomprehensive, multi-vocal empirical study exploring the prevalence of ML cloud\nservice misuses in practice. We propose a catalog of 20 ML cloud service\nmisuses, most of which have not been studied in prior research. To achieve\nthis, we conducted a) a systematic literature review of studies on ML misuses,\nb) a gray literature review of the official documentation provided by major\ncloud providers, c) an empirical analysis of a curated set of 377 ML\nservice-based systems on GitHub, and d) a survey with 50 ML practitioners. Our\nresults show that ML service misuses are common in both open-source projects\nand industry, often stemming from a lack of understanding of service\ncapabilities, and insufficient documentation. This emphasizes the importance of\nongoing education in best practices for ML services, which is the focus of this\npaper, while also highlighting the need for tools to automatically detect and\nrefactor ML misuses.",

    "abstract": "When time-propagating a wave packet representing a molecular system\ninteracting with strong attosecond laser pulses, one needs to use an approach\nthat is capable of describing intricate coupled electronic-nuclear events that\nrequire departure from the conventional adiabatic Born-Oppenheimer (BO)\napproximation. Hence, the propagation should be carried out simultaneously for\nthe electrons and nuclei, treating both particle types on an equal footing\n\\emph{without} invoking the BO approximation. In such calculations, in order to\nachieve high accuracy, the wave packet needs to be expanded in basis functions\nthat explicitly depend on interparticle distances, such as all-particle\nexplicitly correlated Gaussians (ECGs). In our previous work, we employed basis\nsets consisting of ECGs with optimizable complex exponential parameters to fit\ntime-dependent wave functions obtained from grid-based propagations of two\nmodel systems: a nucleus in a Morse potential and an electron in a\ncentral-field Coulomb-like potential, subjected to intense laser pulses. In\nthis work, we present a proof-of-principle study of the time propagation of\nlinear combinations of ECGs for these two models using Rothe's method. It is\nshown that the approach very closely reproduce the virtually exact results of\ngrid-based propagation for both systems. This provides further evidence that\nECGs constitute a viable alternative to purely grid-based simulations of\ncoupled nuclear-electronic dynamics driven by intense laser pulses.",

    "abstract": "Selective inference aims at providing valid inference after a data-driven\nselection of models or hypotheses. It is essential to avoid overconfident\nresults and replicability issues. While significant advances have been made in\nthis area for standard regression models, relatively little attention has been\ngiven to linear mixed models (LMMs), which are widely used for analyzing\nclustered or longitudinal data. This paper reviews the existing selective\ninference approaches developed for LMMs, focusing on selection of fixed\neffects, where the random effects structure is given. We present these methods\nin detail and, through comparative simulations, assess their practical\nperformance and computational feasibility under varying data structures. In\naddition, we apply them to a real-world biological dataset to examine how\nmethod choice can impact inference in practice. Our findings highlight an\nexisting trade-off between computational complexity and statistical power and\nemphasize the scarcity of methods that perform well as the number of variables\nincreases. In such scenarios, basic sample splitting emerges as the most\nreliable approach.",

In the sublinear-time regime, the relaxed problem of\napproximate counting has been explored within two prominent query frameworks:\nthe standard model, which permits degree, neighbor, and pair queries, and the\nstrictly more powerful augmented model, which additionally allows for uniform\nedge sampling. Currently, in the standard model, (optimal) results have been\nestablished only for approximately counting edges, stars, and cliques, all of\nwhich have a radius of one. This contrasts sharply with the state of affairs in\nthe augmented model, where algorithmic results (some of which are optimal) are\nknown for any input motif, leading to a disparity which we term the ``scope\ngap\" between the two models.\n  In this work, we make significant progress in bridging this gap. Our approach\ndraws inspiration from recent advancements in the augmented model and utilizes\na framework centered on counting by uniform sampling, thus allowing us to\nestablish new results in the standard model and simplify on previous results.\n  In particular, our first, and main, contribution is a new algorithm in the\nstandard model for approximately counting any Hamiltonian motif in sublinear\ntime. Our second contribution is a variant of our algorithm that enables nearly\nuniform sampling of these motifs, a capability previously limited in the\nstandard model to edges and cliques. Our third contribution is to introduce\neven simpler algorithms for stars and cliques by exploiting their radius-one\nproperty. As a result, we simplify all previously known algorithms in the\nstandard model for stars (Gonen, Ron, Shavitt (SODA 2010)), triangles (Eden,\nLevi, Ron Seshadhri (FOCS 2015)) and cliques (Eden, Ron, Seshadri (STOC 2018)).",

In this paper, we present a novel\nmethod that integrates graph representation learning with vision-language\nmodels (VLMs) to deliver explainable DR diagnosis.

In recent years,\nPhysics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a promising framework\nthat can capture the intricate dynamics of viral infection and reliably predict\nits future progression. However, despite notable advances, the application of\nPINNs in disease modeling remains limited. Standard PINNs are effective in\nsimulating disease dynamics through forward modeling but often face challenges\nin estimating key biological parameters from sparse or noisy experimental data\nwhen applied in an inverse framework. To overcome these limitations, a recent\nextension known as Disease Informed Neural Networks (DINNs) has emerged,\noffering a more robust approach to parameter estimation tasks. In this work, we\napply this DINNs technique on a recently proposed hepatitis B virus (HBV)\ninfection dynamics model to predict infection transmission within the liver.\nThis model consists of four compartments: uninfected and infected hepatocytes,\nrcDNA-containing capsids, and free viruses. Leveraging the power of DINNs, we\nstudy the impacts of (i) variations in parameter range, (ii) experimental noise\nin data, (iii) sample sizes, (iv) network architecture and (v) learning rate.\nWe employ this methodology in experimental data collected from nine\nHBV-infected chimpanzees and observe that it reliably estimates the model\nparameters. DINNs can capture infection dynamics and predict their future\nprogression even when data of some compartments of the system are missing.\nAdditionally, it identifies the influential model parameters that determine\nwhether the HBV infection is cleared or persists within the host.",

    "abstract": "In ``On restricting to one-loop order the radiative effects in quantum\ngravity\" (Brandt, Frenkel, and McKeon, 2020) \\cite{Brandt2020}, a Lagrange\nmultiplier (LM) field is introduced into the Einstein-Hilbert action, removing\nall multi-loop graviton diagrams and confining quantum-gravity corrections to\njust one loop. The resulting one-loop effective action carries a term\nproportional to {$\\ln(\\mu/\\Lambda)$}, which they suggest could be\nexperimentally determined, hinting at direct measurements of quantum-gravity\neffects. We {demonstrate}, however, that {$\\mu$ and $\\Lambda$} emerge from a\nchosen renormalization scheme, not from physical observables, implying that\n{$\\ln(\\mu/\\Lambda)$} signals a finite UV cutoff in this ``LM renormalization\nscheme.'' Although Newton's constant remains fixed (no running of {$G_N$}), the\nresulting logarithmic dependence encodes a limited domain of validity for\nGeneral Relativity (GR) in four dimensions, thereby demonstrating explicitly\nthat 4D GR behaves as an effective field theory (EFT) for energies below the\ncutoff. {Using the Appelquist-Carazzone decoupling theorem, we prove\nmathematically that this framework has a well-defined low-energy limit.} We\nthen illustrate how this truncated, renormalized gravity sector can be\nconsistently unified with the Standard Model (SM), yielding a finite and\nrenormalized EFT encompassing both gravity and particle physics up to a scale\n{$\\Lambda_{\\text{grav}}$}. As such, we term this unification as the USMEG-EFT\n(Unified Standard Model with Emergent Gravity-EFT) framework.

    "abstract": "Equality reasoning is ubiquitous and purely abstract: sameness or difference\nmay be evaluated no matter the nature of the underlying objects. As a result,\nsame-different (SD) tasks have been extensively studied as a starting point for\nunderstanding abstract reasoning in humans and across animal species. With the\nrise of neural networks that exhibit striking apparent proficiency for\nabstractions, equality reasoning in these models has also gained interest. Yet\ndespite extensive study, conclusions about equality reasoning vary widely and\nwith little consensus. To clarify the underlying principles in learning SD\ntasks, we develop a theory of equality reasoning in multi-layer perceptrons\n(MLP). Following observations in comparative psychology, we propose a spectrum\nof behavior that ranges from conceptual to perceptual outcomes. Conceptual\nbehavior is characterized by task-specific representations, efficient learning,\nand insensitivity to spurious perceptual details. Perceptual behavior is\ncharacterized by strong sensitivity to spurious perceptual details, accompanied\nby the need for exhaustive training to learn the task. We develop a\nmathematical theory to show that an MLP's behavior is driven by learning\nrichness. Rich-regime MLPs exhibit conceptual behavior, whereas lazy-regime\nMLPs exhibit perceptual behavior. We validate our theoretical findings in\nvision SD experiments, showing that rich feature learning promotes success by\nencouraging hallmarks of conceptual behavior. Overall, our work identifies\nfeature learning richness as a key parameter modulating equality reasoning, and\nsuggests that equality reasoning in humans and animals may similarly depend on\nlearning richness in neural circuits.",

To address these challenges,\nthis paper introduces the Gromov-Wasserstein Scoring Model Merging (GW-SMM)\nmethod, which merges models based on feature distribution similarities measured\nvia the Gromov-Wasserstein distance. Our approach begins by extracting features\nfrom student responses using individual models, capturing both item-specific\ncontext and unique learned representations. The Gromov-Wasserstein distance\nthen quantifies the similarity between these feature distributions, identifying\nthe most compatible models for merging. Models exhibiting the smallest pairwise\ndistances, typically in pairs or trios, are merged by combining only the shared\nlayers preceding the classification head. This strategy results in a unified\nfeature extractor while preserving separate classification heads for\nitem-specific scoring. We validated our approach against human expert knowledge\nand a GPT-o1-based merging method. GW-SMM consistently outperformed both,\nachieving a higher micro F1 score, macro F1 score, exact match accuracy, and\nper-label accuracy. The improvements in micro F1 and per-label accuracy were\nstatistically significant compared to GPT-o1-based merging (p=0.04, p=0.01).\nAdditionally, GW-SMM reduced storage requirements by half without compromising\nmuch accuracy, demonstrating its computational efficiency alongside reliable\nscoring performance.",

As a result, current searches may be missing a significant\nfraction of the astrophysical population, and the detected NSBH population may\nbe significantly suppressed or biased. Here we report the most sensitive search\nfor NSBH binaries to date by including spin-precession for the first time. We\nanalyze data from the entirety of the third LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA gravitational-wave\nobserving run and show that when accounting for spin-precession, our search is\nup to 100% more sensitive than the search techniques currently adopted by the\nLIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration (for systems with strong precessional effects).\nThis allows us to more tightly constrain the rate of NSBH mergers in the local\nUniverse. Firstly, we focus on a precessing subpopulation of NSBH mergers; the\nlack of observed candidates allows us to place an upper limit on the merger\nrate of $R_{90} = 79\\, \\mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ with 90% confidence.\nSecondly, we tighten the overall rate of NSBH mergers; we show that if there is\nno preferred direction of component spin, the rate of NSBH mergers is on\naverage 16% smaller than previously believed.

In this approach, we analyze the effect of the dark\nmatter mass, the dark matter-dark energy interaction strength and the dark\nmatter self-interaction on the cosmological parameters. Further, within\n$\\mathcal{Q}_{\\rm CDM}$ we investigate the possible alleviation of the Hubble\ntension and the $S_8$ anomaly and the nature of dark energy.",

    "abstract": "Electromechanics in fluids describes the response of the number density to\nelectric fields, and thus provides a powerful means by which to control the\nbehavior of liquids. While continuum approaches have proven successful in\ndescribing electromechanical phenomena in macroscopic bodies, their use is\nquestionable when relevant length scales become comparable to a system's\nnatural correlation lengths, as commonly occurs in, e.g., biological systems,\nnanopores, and microfluidics. Here, we present a first principles theory for\nelectromechanical phenomena in fluids. Our approach is based on the recently\nproposed hyperdensity functional theory [Samm\\\"uller et al, Phys. Rev. Lett.\n133, 098201 (2024)] in which we treat the charge density as an observable of\nthe system, with the intrinsic Helmholtz free energy functional dependent upon\nboth density and electrostatic potential. Expressions for the coupling between\nnumber and charge densities emerge naturally in this formalism, avoiding the\nneed to construct density-dependent and spatially-varying material parameters\nsuch as the dielectric constant. Furthermore, we make our theory practical by\nderiving a connection between hyperdensity functional theory and local\nmolecular field theory, which facilitates machine learning explicit\nrepresentations for the free energy functionals of systems with short-ranged\nelectrostatic interactions, with long-ranged effects accounted for in a\nwell-controlled mean field fashion.",

While successful, these have limitations: geometric complexes scale\npoorly with data size, and Mapper graphs can be hard to tune and only contain\nlow dimensional information. In this paper, we propose to study the problem of\nlearning covers in its own right, and from the perspective of optimization. We\ndescribe a method for learning topologically-faithful covers of geometric\ndatasets, and show that the simplicial complexes thus obtained can outperform\nstandard topological inference approaches in terms of size, and Mapper-type\nalgorithms in terms of representation of large-scale topology.",

Our approach leverages\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) with Low-Rank\nAdaptation (LoRA), enabling each client (school) to train locally while sharing\nonly optimized model updates. To address data heterogeneity, we implement an\nadaptive weighted aggregation strategy that considers both client performance\nand data volume. We benchmark our model against two state-of-the-art FL methods\nand a centralized learning baseline using NGSS-aligned multi-label science\nassessment data from nine middle schools. Results show that our model achieves\nthe highest accuracy (94.5%) among FL approaches, and performs within 0.5-1.0\npercentage points of the centralized model on these metrics. Additionally, it\nachieves comparable rubric-level scoring accuracy, with only a 1.3% difference\nin rubric match and a lower score deviation (MAE), highlighting its\neffectiveness in preserving both prediction quality and interpretability.",

    "abstract": "In Amazon robotic warehouses, the destination-to-chute mapping problem is\ncrucial for efficient package sorting. Often, however, this problem is\ncomplicated by uncertain and dynamic package induction rates, which can lead to\nincreased package recirculation. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a\nDistributionally Robust Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (DRMARL) framework\nthat learns a destination-to-chute mapping policy that is resilient to\nadversarial variations in induction rates. Specifically, DRMARL relies on group\ndistributionally robust optimization (DRO) to learn a policy that performs well\nnot only on average but also on each individual subpopulation of induction\nrates within the group that capture, for example, different seasonality or\noperation modes of the system. This approach is then combined with a novel\ncontextual bandit-based predictor of the worst-case induction distribution for\neach state-action pair, significantly reducing the cost of exploration and\nthereby increasing the learning efficiency and scalability of our framework.\nExtensive simulations demonstrate that DRMARL achieves robust chute mapping in\nthe presence of varying induction distributions, reducing package recirculation\nby an average of 80\\% in the simulation scenario.",

    "abstract": "Event, or neuromorphic cameras, offer a novel encoding of natural scenes by\nasynchronously reporting significant changes in brightness, known as events,\nwith improved dynamic range, temporal resolution and lower data bandwidth when\ncompared to conventional cameras. However, their adoption in domain-specific\nresearch tasks is hindered in part by limited commercial availability, lack of\nexisting datasets, and challenges related to predicting the impact of their\nnonlinear optical encoding, unique noise model and tensor-based data processing\nrequirements. To address these challenges, we introduce Synthetic Events for\nNeural Processing and Integration (SENPI) in Python, a PyTorch-based library\nfor simulating and processing event camera data. SENPI includes a\ndifferentiable digital twin that converts intensity-based data into event\nrepresentations, allowing for evaluation of event camera performance while\nhandling the non-smooth and nonlinear nature of the forward model The library\nalso supports modules for event-based I/O, manipulation, filtering and\nvisualization, creating efficient and scalable workflows for both synthetic and\nreal event-based data. We demonstrate SENPI's ability to produce realistic\nevent-based data by comparing synthetic outputs to real event camera data and\nuse these results to draw conclusions on the properties and utility of\nevent-based perception. Additionally, we showcase SENPI's use in exploring\nevent camera behavior under varying noise conditions and optimizing event\ncontrast threshold for improved encoding under target conditions.

This phenomenon facilitates the precise\ndetection of incredibly slow speeds of light, which is widely used in quantum\ngate operations, state transfer, and quantum memory implementations, etc. To\nthe best of our knowledge, this is the first time we have proposed the\nexistence of a light-dragging effect in a magnomechanical system (MMS). The\norigin of this crucial element stems from nonlinear dipole and magnetostrictive\ninteractions in MMS. Magnomechanical characteristics such as magnon-photon and\nmagnon-phonon couplings have a strong impact on both refractive and group index\nprofile spectra. We also explore that lateral light drag shows a strong\ndependence on detuning by altering the amplitude and direction of the\ntranslational velocity. This enabled us to alter the light's propagation within\nthe magnomechanical system from superluminal to subluminal and vice versa by\nadjusting the probe's detuning.

    "abstract": "This study presents the first automated classifier designed to determine\nwhether a pair of iris images originates from monozygotic individuals,\naddressing a previously untackled problem in biometric recognition. In\nDaugman-style iris recognition, the textures of the left and right irises of\nthe same person are traditionally considered as being as different as the\nirises of two unrelated persons. However, previous research indicates that\nhumans can detect that two iris images are from different eyes of the same\nperson, or eyes of monozygotic twins, with an accuracy of about 80%. In this\nwork, we employ a Siamese network architecture and contrastive learning to\ncategorize a pair of iris images as coming from monozygotic or non-monozygotic\nirises. This could potentially be applied, for example, as a fast, noninvasive\ntest to determine if twins are monozygotic or non-monozygotic. We construct a\ndataset comprising both synthetic monozygotic pairs (images of different irises\nof the same individual) and natural monozygotic pairs (images of different\nimages from persons who are identical twins), in addition to non-monozygotic\npairs from unrelated individuals, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of the\nmodel's capabilities. To gain deeper insights into the learned representations,\nwe train and analyze three variants of the model using (1) the original input\nimages, (2) iris-only images (masking everything but the iris region), and (3)\nnon-iris-only images (masking the iris region). This comparison reveals that\nboth iris texture and surrounding ocular structure contain information useful\nfor the model to classify the image pairs as monozygotic or non-monozygotic.\nOur approach achieves accuracy levels using the full iris image that exceed\nthose previously reported for human classification of monozygotic iris pairs.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we prove a KAM theorem in a-posteriori format, using the\nparameterization method to look invariant tori in non-autonomous Hamiltonian\nsystems with $n$ degrees of freedom that depend periodically or\nquasi-periodically (QP) on time, with $\\ell$ external frequencies. Such a\nsystem is described by a Hamiltonian function in the $2n$-dimensional phase\nspace, $\\mathscr{M}$, that depends also on $\\ell$ angles, $\\varphi\\in\n\\mathbb{T}^\\ell$. We take advantage of the fibbered structure of the extended\nphase space $\\mathscr{M} \\times \\mathbb{T}^\\ell$. As a result of our approach,\nthe parameterization of tori requires the last $\\ell$ variables, to be precise\n$\\varphi$, while the first $2n$ components are determined by an invariance\nequation. This reduction decreases the dimension of the problem where the\nunknown is a parameterization from $2(n+\\ell)$ to $2n$. We employ a\nquasi-Newton method, in order to prove the KAM theorem. This iterative method\nbegins with an initial parameterization of an approximately invariant torus,\nmeaning it approximately satisfies the invariance equation. The approximation\nis refined by applying corrections that reduce quadratically the invariance\nequation error. This process converges to a torus in a complex strip of size\n$\\rho_\\infty$, provided suitable Diophantine $(\\gamma,\\tau)$ conditions and a\nnon-degeneracy condition on the torsion are met. Given the nature of the proof,\nthis provides a numerical method that can be effectively implemented on a\ncomputer, the details are given in the companion paper [CHP25]. This approach\nleverages precision and efficiency to compute invariant tori.",

This paper\naims to, through mobile diaries, understand cancer survivors' emotional states\nand key variables related to just-in-time intervention opportunities, including\nthe desire to regulate emotions and the availability to engage in\ninterventions. Although emotion analysis tools show potential for recognizing\nemotions from text, current methods lack the contextual understanding necessary\nto interpret brief mobile diary narratives.

CALLM demonstrates strong performance with balanced\naccuracies reaching 72.96% for positive affect, 73.29% for negative affect,\n73.72% for emotion regulation desire, and 60.09% for intervention availability,\noutperforming language model baselines.

Unlike the prevailing approach to sensitivity\nanalysis after matching, there is a closed form expression for the limiting\nworst-case distribution when matching with multiple controls. Moreover, the\napproach admits a closed form for its design sensitivity, a measure used to\ncompare competing test statistics and research designs, for matching with\nmultiple controls, whereas the conventional approach generally only does so for\npair matching. The tilted sensitivity analysis improves design sensitivity\nunder a host of generative models.

Specifically,\nmetal-pollution has been observed to be rare in white dwarfs more massive than\n$\\approx$0.7 $M_{\\odot}$. Our population synthesis model invokes episodic\naccretion of planetary debris onto a synthetic population of white dwarfs. We\nfind that the observed difference can be explained in the regime where most\ndebris disks last for $10^4$$-$$10^6$ years. This is broadly consistent with\nobservational estimates that disk lifetimes are on the order 10$^5$$-$10$^7$\nyears. We also invoke an alternate model which explores an upper limit on\nplanetary system formation and survival around the intermediate-mass\nprogenitors of the more massive white dwarfs. In this scenario, we find an\nupper limit on the polluted white dwarf mass of $M_{\\rm\nwd}<0.72^{+0.07}_{-0.03}$ M$_{\\odot}$. This implies an empirical maximum\nprogenitor mass of $M_{\\rm ZAMS}^{\\rm max}=2.9^{+0.7}_{-0.3}$ M$_{\\odot}$.

    "abstract": "Knowledge graph reasoning (KGR), which answers complex, logical queries over\nlarge knowledge graphs (KGs), represents an important artificial intelligence\ntask with a range of applications. Many KGs require extensive domain expertise\nand engineering effort to build and are hence considered proprietary within\norganizations and enterprises. Yet, spurred by their commercial and research\npotential, there is a growing trend to make KGR systems, (partially) built upon\nprivate KGs, publicly available through reasoning APIs.\n  The inherent tension between maintaining the confidentiality of KGs while\nensuring the accessibility to KGR systems motivates our study of KG extraction\nattacks: the adversary aims to \"steal\" the private segments of the backend KG,\nleveraging solely black-box access to the KGR API. Specifically, we present\nKGX, an attack that extracts confidential sub-KGs with high fidelity under\nlimited query budgets. At a high level, KGX progressively and adaptively\nqueries the KGR API and integrates the query responses to reconstruct the\nprivate sub-KG. This extraction remains viable even if any query responses\nrelated to the private sub-KG are filtered. We validate the efficacy of KGX\nagainst both experimental and real-world KGR APIs. Interestingly, we find that\ntypical countermeasures (e.g., injecting noise into query responses) are often\nineffective against KGX. Our findings suggest the need for a more principled\napproach to developing and deploying KGR systems, as well as devising new\ndefenses against KG extraction attacks.",

Traditional\nModel-Based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) approaches learn predictive models of\nenvironment dynamics from queried trajectories and then use these models to\nsimulate rollouts for policy optimization. However, such methods do not account\nfor the underlying causal mechanisms that govern the environment, and thus\ninadvertently capture spurious correlations, making them sensitive to\ndistributional shifts and limiting their ability to generalize. The same\nnaturally holds for model-free approaches. In this work, we introduce Causal\nModel-Based Policy Optimization (C-MBPO), a novel framework that integrates\ncausal learning into the MBRL pipeline to achieve more robust, explainable, and\ngeneralizable policy learning algorithms.\n  Our approach centers on first inferring a Causal Markov Decision Process\n(C-MDP) by learning a local Structural Causal Model (SCM) of both the state and\nreward transition dynamics from trajectories gathered online. C-MDPs differ\nfrom classic MDPs in that we can decompose causal dependencies in the\nenvironment dynamics via specifying an associated Causal Bayesian Network.\nC-MDPs allow for targeted interventions and counterfactual reasoning, enabling\nthe agent to distinguish between mere statistical correlations and causal\nrelationships. The learned SCM is then used to simulate counterfactual\non-policy transitions and rewards under hypothetical actions (or\n``interventions\"), thereby guiding policy optimization more effectively. The\nresulting policy learned by C-MBPO can be shown to be robust to a class of\ndistributional shifts that affect spurious, non-causal relationships in the\ndynamics.

Evaluation\ndemonstrates that MoE-Gen achieves 8-31x higher throughput compared to\nstate-of-the-art systems employing model-based batching (FlexGen,\nMoE-Lightning, DeepSpeed), and offers even greater throughput improvements over\ncontinuous batching systems (e.g., vLLM and Ollama) on popular MoE models\n(DeepSeek and Mixtral) across offline inference tasks.

Here we\nfocus on the band-gap's modulation by external electric fields and uncover the\neffect of band dispersion on the gap renormalization. We employ the Green's\nfunction formalism using the real-time Dyson expansion to account for dynamical\ncorrelations induced by photodoping. The many-body formalism captures the\ndynamics of systems with long-range interactions, carrier mobility, and\nvariable electron and hole effective mass. We also demonstrate that mean-field\nsimulations based on the Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian, which lacks dynamical\ncorrelations, yields a qualitatively incorrect picture of band-gap\nrenormalization. We find the trend that increasing effective mass, thus\ndecreasing mobility, leads to as much as a 6\\% enhancement in band-gap\nrenormalization. Further, the renormalization is strongly dependent on the\ndegree of photodoping. As the screening induced by free electrons and holes\neffectively reduces any long-range and interband interactions for highly\nexcited systems, we show that there is a specific turnover point with minimal\nband-gap. We further demonstrate that the optical gap renormalization follows\nthe same trend though its magnitude is altered by the Moss-Burstein effect.",

In recent years, deep neural networks (DNNs) have\ngreatly enhanced the performance of TSC models in these critical domains.\nHowever, DNNs are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where attackers can covertly\nimplant triggers into models to induce malicious outcomes. Existing backdoor\nattacks targeting DNN-based TSC models remain elementary. In particular, early\nmethods borrow trigger designs from computer vision, which are ineffective for\ntime series data. More recent approaches utilize generative models for trigger\ngeneration, but at the cost of significant computational complexity. In this\nwork, we analyze the limitations of existing attacks and introduce an enhanced\nmethod, FreqBack. Drawing inspiration from the fact that DNN models inherently\ncapture frequency domain features in time series data, we identify that\nimproper perturbations in the frequency domain are the root cause of\nineffective attacks. To address this, we propose to generate triggers both\neffectively and efficiently, guided by frequency analysis. FreqBack exhibits\nsubstantial performance across five models and eight datasets, achieving an\nimpressive attack success rate of over 90%, while maintaining less than a 3%\ndrop in model accuracy on clean data.",

According to many formation\nscenarios, the second population (2P) originated within a compact and denser\nregion embedded in a more extended first population (1P) system. As a result,\n2P binaries should be disrupted at a larger rate than 1P binaries. For this\nreason, binary systems offer valuable insight into the environments in which\nthese stellar populations formed and evolved. In this research, we analyze the\nfraction of binaries among 1P and 2P M dwarfs in the outer region of NGC 288\nusing Hubble Space Telescope data. We combine our results with those from a\nprevious work, where we inferred the fraction of 1P and 2P binaries in the\ncluster center. In the outer region, we find a predominance of 1P binaries\n($97^{+1}_{-3}\\%$) compared to 2P binaries ($3\\pm1\\%$) corresponding to an\nincidence of binaries with a mass ratio (i.e., the ratio between the masses of\nthe primary and secondary star) greater than 0.5 equal to $6.4\\pm 1.7\\%$ for\nthe 1P population and $0.3\\pm 0.2\\%$ for the 2P population.

We thus unveil the\nessential microscopic ingredients of the $d$-electron-based kagome metals that,\nwhile distinct from the atomic orbitals of the $f$-electron-based heavy fermion\nmaterials, are responsible for a shared phenomenology between the two types of\nsystems. Our findings provide a new window to uncover and interconnect the\nessential and yet diverse microscopic building blocks in disparate families of\nquantum materials that drive a convergence towards a universal understanding in\nthe regime of amplified quantum fluctuations.",

    "abstract": "In the most precise distance ladder determination of $H_0$, the observed\nnear-infrared (NIR) fluxes of Cepheids are corrected for dust, assuming that\nthe extinction law in large, star-forming spiral hosts of Type Ia supernovae\n(SN Ia) is similar to the Milky Way's average value of $R_V \\approx 3.1$.\nIntriguingly, studies of SNe Ia often point to lower values for their hosts\n($R_V \\sim 2$). Ambiguities related to $R_V$ may limit future efforts to\nmeasure $H_0$ beyond $\\sim 1\\%$ precision. To better resolve extragalactic\nextinction laws, we directly measure the wavelength-dependent absorption of\nbackground galaxies seen in HST and JWST images (0.5--2.7 $\\mu$m). We take the\nfollowing steps: (i) subtract foreground stars to measure accurate photometry\nof background galaxies with a tool, $\\texttt{SPHOT}$; (ii) measure their\nredshifts and spectroscopic features with Keck/DEIMOS; (iii) determine their\nintrinsic spectral energy distributions from the empirical templates which\nmatch the absorption lines and breaks in observed spectroscopic features, and\n(iv) measure $R_V$ by fitting the extinction model to the difference between\nthe template and the observed SEDs. The above steps are tested with artificial\ndatasets to insure they accurately recover the input $R_V$. We apply this set\nof steps to a first case, NGC 5584, a SN Ia host and a calibrator of the Hubble\nconstant. The estimated value of $R_V$ for NGC 5584,\n$R_V=3.59^{+0.99}_{-0.62}(\\text{stat})\\pm0.19(\\text{syst})$, is consistent with\nthe MW-like extinction law, and it is $\\gtrsim 3.5\\sigma$ away from $R_V=2$ as\nfavored by SN Ia. If additional hosts show similar results, it would suggest\nthat SN Ia extinction may not be solely due to mean interstellar dust. We are\nnow undertaking a statistical study of 5-10 SH0ES hosts to determine the\ndistribution of host extinction laws.",

    "abstract": "High-fidelity entanglement shared between distant quantum systems is an\nessential resource for quantum communication and computation. Entanglement\ndistillation addresses this need by converting multiple noisy Bell pairs into\nfewer higher-fidelity pairs, using only local quantum operations and classical\ncommunication. However, this approach typically requires a substantial overhead\nin the number of qubits. To bypass this hurdle, we propose to leverage the\nhigh-dimensional Hilbert space of a single pair of bosonic systems to store a\nlarge amount of entanglement, replacing the need for multi-qubit systems. To\ndistill entanglement in such a setup, we devise a new entanglement distillation\nprotocol, tailored for bosonic systems. The protocol converts a\nhighly-entangled noisy state between two bosonic systems into a\nlower-dimensional but high-fidelity entangled state, using only local bosonic\noperations. We show that our protocol significantly enhances the fidelity of\nthe entangled state in the presence of naturally occurring loss and dephasing\nerrors.

These artifacts in the\ndata are not corrected in the JWST data pipeline, and significantly impact the\nscience that can be achieved at a single-pixel level. We present WICKED (WIggle\nCorrector Kit for NIRSpEc Data), a tool designed to empirically remove wiggles.\nWICKED uses the Fast Fourier Transform to identify wiggle-affected spaxels\nacross the data cube. Spectra are modeled with a mix of integrated aperture and\nannular templates, a power-law, and a second-degree polynomial. The method\nworks across all medium- and high-resolution NIRSpec gratings: F070LP, F100LP,\nF170LP, and F290LP. WICKED can recover the true overall spectral shape up to a\nfactor of 3.5x better compared to uncorrected spectra. It recovers the\nequivalent width of absorption lines within 5% of the true value-~3x better\nthan uncorrected spectra and ~2x better than other methods. WICKED\nsignificantly improves kinematic measurements, recovering the line-of-sight\nvelocity (LOSV) within 1% of the true value -- more than 100x better than\nuncorrected spectra at S/N ~40. As a case study, we applied WICKED to\nG235H/F170LP IFU data of the elliptical galaxy NGC5128, finding good agreement\nwith previous studies. In wiggle-affected regions, the uncorrected spectrum\nshowed stellar LOSV and velocity dispersion differences compared to the\nWICKED-cleaned spectrum, of ~17x and ~36x larger than the estimated\nuncertainties, respectively. Wiggles in NIRSpec IFU data can introduce severe\nbiases in spectral shape, line measurements, and kinematics to values larger\nthan the typical uncertainties.

One way to assess the presence of atmospheres on rocky\nexoplanets is to measure their dayside emission as they are eclipsed by their\nhost stars. Here, we present Spitzer observations of the 4.5 $\\mu$m secondary\neclipses of the rocky super-Earth TOI-431 b, whose mass and radius indicate an\nEarth-like bulk composition (3.07 $\\pm$ 0.35 M$_{\\oplus}$, 1.28 $\\pm$ 0.04\nR$_{\\oplus}$). Exposed to more than 2000 times the irradiation of Earth,\ndayside temperatures of up to 2400K are expected if the planet is a dark\nbare-rock without a significant atmosphere. Intriguingly, despite the strong\nstellar insolation, we measure a secondary eclipse depth of only 33 $\\pm$ 22\nppm, which corresponds to a dayside brightness temperature of\n$1520_{-390}^{+360}$K. This notably low eclipse depth disagrees with the dark\nbare-rock scenario at the 2.5$\\sigma$ level, and suggests either that the\nplanet is surrounded by an atmosphere, or that it is a bare-rock with a highly\nreflective surface. In the atmosphere scenario, the low dayside emission\nimplies the efficient redistribution of heat to the nightside, or by molecular\nabsorption in the 4-5 $\\mu$m bandpass. In the bare-rock scenario, a surface\ncomposition made of a high-albedo mineral species such as ultramafic rock can\nlead to reduced thermal emission consistent with low eclipse depth measurement.\nFollow-up spectroscopic observations with the James Webb Space Telescope hold\nthe key to constraining the nature of the planet.",

    "abstract": "We present a model for interacting electrons in a continuum band structure\nthat resembles a ``trashcan'', with a flat bottom of radius $k_b$ beyond which\nthe dispersion increases rapidly with velocity $v$. The form factors of the\nBloch wavefunctions can be well-approximated by the Girvin-MacDonald-Platzman\nalgebra, which encodes the uniform Berry curvature. We demonstrate how this\nmodel captures the salient features of the low-energy Hamiltonian for\nelectron-doped pristine $n$-layer rhombohedral graphene (R$n$G) for appropriate\nvalues of the displacement field, and provide corresponding expressions for\n$k_b$. In the regime where the Fermi wavevector is close to $k_b$, we\nanalytically solve the Hartree-Fock equations for a gapped Wigner crystal in\nseveral limits of the model. We introduce a new method, the sliver-patch\napproximation, which extends the previous few-patch approaches and is crucial\nin both differentiating even vs odd Chern numbers of the ground state and\ngapping the Hartree-Fock solution. A key parameter is the Berry flux\n$\\varphi_{\\text{BZ}}$ enclosed by the (flat) bottom of the band. We\nanalytically show that there is a ferromagnetic coupling between the signs of\n$\\varphi_{\\text{BZ}}$ and the Chern number $C$ of the putative Wigner crystal.\nWe also study the competition between the $C=0$ and $1$ solutions as a function\nof the interaction potential for parameters relevant to R$n$G. By exhaustive\ncomparison to numerical Hartree-Fock calculations, we demonstrate how the\nanalytic results capture qualitative trends of the phase diagram, as well as\nquantitative details such as the enhancement of the effective velocity. Our\nanalysis paves the way for an analytic and numerical examination of the\nstability and competition beyond mean-field theory of the Wigner crystals in\nthis model.",

To accurately characterise the sub-halo mass component, we\ncalibrate the Faber-Jackson scaling relation based on the stellar kinematics of\n14 bright cluster galaxies. We build several lens models, with different\ncluster total mass parametrisations, to assess the statistical and systematic\nuncertainties on the predicted values of the position and magnification of the\nobserved and future multiple images of SN Requiem and SN Encore. Our reference\nbest-fit lens model reproduces the observed positions of the multiple images\nwith a root-mean-square offset of 0\".36, and the multiple image positions of\nthe SNe and their host galaxy with a remarkable mean precision of only 0\".05.\nWe measure a projected total mass of $M(<60~ \\rm kpc) = 2.89_{-0.03}^{+0.04}\n\\times 10^{13} M_{\\odot}$, consistent with that independently derived from the\nChandra X-ray analysis. We demonstrate the reliability of the new lens model by\nreconstructing the extended surface-brightness distribution of the multiple\nimages of the host galaxy. The discrepancy between our model-predicted\nmagnification values with those from previous studies, critical for\nunderstanding the intrinsic properties of the SNe and their host galaxy,\nunderscores the need to combine cutting-edge observations with detailed lens\nmodelling.",

Moreover, path-integral methods are developed to study\nthermal Green's functions (with an arbitrary number of points) in generic\ntheories, which cover both the real-time and imaginary-time formalism. It is\nshown that, while the average angular momentum, like the chemical potentials,\ndoes not contribute positively to the Euclidean action, its negative\ncontributions can be compensated by some other contributions that are instead\npositive, at least in some cases. As an application of the developed general\nformalism, it is shown that the production of particles weakly coupled to a\nrotating plasma can be significantly enhanced compared to the non-rotating\ncase.

    "abstract": "Using gravitational waves to probe the geometry of the ringing remnant black\nhole formed in a binary black hole coalescence is a well-established way to\ntest Einstein's theory of general relativity. However, doing so requires\nknowledge of when the predictions of black hole perturbation theory, i.e.,\nquasi-normal modes (QNMs), are a valid description of the emitted gravitational\nwave as well as what the amplitudes of these excitations are. In this work, we\ndevelop an algorithm to systematically extract QNMs from the ringdown of black\nhole merger simulations. Our algorithm improves upon previous ones in three\nways: it fits over the two-sphere, enabling a complete model of the strain; it\nperforms a reverse-search in time for QNMs using a more robust nonlinear least\nsquares routine called \\texttt{VarPro}; and it checks the variance of QNM\namplitudes, which we refer to as ``stability'', over an interval matching the\nnatural time scale of each QNM. Using this algorithm, we not only demonstrate\nthe stability of a multitude of QNMs and their overtones across the parameter\nspace of quasi-circular, non-precessing binary black holes, but we also\nidentify new quadratic QNMs that may be detectable in the near future using\nground-based interferometers. Furthermore, we provide evidence which suggests\nthat the source of remnant black hole perturbations is roughly independent of\nthe overtone index in a given angular harmonic across binary parameter space,\nat least for overtones with $n\\lesssim2$. This finding may hint at the\nspatiotemporal structure of ringdown perturbations in black hole coalescences,\nas well as the regime of validity of perturbation theory in the ringdown of\nthese events.

One of our key\nfindings is that a small level of user ignorance universally improves traffic,\nregardless of the network composition. Further, there is an optimal level of\nignorance which, in our model, causes the self-interested user behavior to\ncoincide with the optimum. Many features of our model can be understood\nanalytically, including the optimal level of user ignorance and the existence\nof critical scaling near the percolation threshold for fast links, where the\npotential benefit of user ignorance is greatest.",

A\nrepresentative example is the Haldane-Hubbard model at half filling. Although\nthe compensated collinear magnetic ground state was previously recognized as\nantiferromagnetism, we show that sublattice currents induce spin splitting in\nthe bands and therefore turn it into an odd-parity ALM.

It has been demonstrated in the literature that\nsuch special-purpose solvers can outperform traditional CMOS architectures by\norders of magnitude with respect to timing metrics on synthetic problems.\nHowever, they face challenges with constrained problems such as the quadratic\nassignment problem (QAP), where mapping to binary formulations such as QUBO\nintroduces overhead and limits parallelism. In-memory computing (IMC) devices,\nsuch as memristor-based analog Ising machines, offer significant speedups and\nefficiency gains over traditional CPU-based solvers, particularly for solving\ncombinatorial optimization problems. In this work, we present a novel local\nsearch heuristic designed for IMC hardware to tackle the QAP. Our approach\nenables massive parallelism that allows for computing of full neighbourhoods\nsimultaneously to make update decisions. We ensure binary solutions remain\nfeasible by selecting local moves that lead to neighbouring feasible solutions,\nleveraging feasible-space search heuristics and the underlying structure of a\ngiven problem. Our approach is compatible with both digital computers and\nanalog hardware. We demonstrate its effectiveness in CPU implementations by\ncomparing it with state-of-the-art heuristics for solving the QAP.",

    "abstract": "Despite the potential of federated learning in medical applications,\ninconsistent imaging quality across institutions-stemming from lower-quality\ndata from a minority of clients-biases federated models toward more common\nhigh-quality images. This raises significant fairness concerns. Existing fair\nfederated learning methods have demonstrated some effectiveness in solving this\nproblem by aligning a single 0th- or 1st-order state of convergence (e.g.,\ntraining loss or sharpness). However, we argue in this work that fairness based\non such a single state is still not an adequate surrogate for fairness during\ntesting, as these single metrics fail to fully capture the convergence\ncharacteristics, making them suboptimal for guiding fair learning. To address\nthis limitation, we develop a generalized framework. Specifically, we propose\nassessing convergence using multiple states, defined as sharpness or perturbed\nloss computed at varying search distances. Building on this comprehensive\nassessment, we propose promoting fairness for these states across clients to\nachieve our ultimate fairness objective. This is accomplished through the\nproposed method, FedISM+. In FedISM+, the search distance evolves over time,\nprogressively focusing on different states. We then incorporate two components\nin local training and global aggregation to ensure cross-client fairness for\neach state. This gradually makes convergence equitable for all states, thereby\nimproving fairness during testing. Our empirical evaluations, performed on the\nwell-known RSNA ICH and ISIC 2019 datasets, demonstrate the superiority of\nFedISM+ over existing state-of-the-art methods for fair federated learning.

This new approach, called tradecraft prompting,\ncenters on encoding the on-the-ground knowledge of threat modelers within the\nprompts that drive a generative AI-based threat modeling system. Auspex employs\ntradecraft prompts in two processing stages. The first stage centers on\ningesting and processing system architecture information using prompts that\nencode threat modeling tradecraft knowledge pertaining to system decomposition\nand description. The second stage centers on chaining the resulting system\nanalysis through a collection of prompts that encode tradecraft knowledge on\nthreat identification, classification, and mitigation. The two-stage process\nyields a threat matrix for a system that specifies threat scenarios, threat\ntypes, information security categorizations and potential mitigations. Auspex\nproduces formalized threat model output in minutes, relative to the weeks or\nmonths a manual process takes. More broadly, the focus on bespoke tradecraft\nprompting, as opposed to fine-tuning or agent-based add-ons, makes Auspex a\nlightweight, flexible, modular, and extensible foundational system capable of\naddressing the complexity, resource, and standardization limitations of both\nexisting manual and automated threat modeling processes. In this connection, we\nestablish the baseline value of Auspex to threat modelers through an evaluation\nprocedure based on feedback collected from cybersecurity subject matter experts\nmeasuring the quality and utility of threat models generated by Auspex on real\nbanking systems.

However, the lengthy\nsampling time of the denoising process remains a significant bottleneck in\npractical applications. Previous methods either ignore the statistical\nrelationships between adjacent steps or rely on attention or feature similarity\nbetween them, which often only works with specific network structures. To\naddress this issue, we discover a new statistical relationship in the\ntransition operator between adjacent steps, focusing on the relationship of the\noutputs from the network. This relationship does not impose any requirements on\nthe network structure. Based on this observation, we propose a novel\ntraining-free acceleration method called LTC-Accel, which uses the identified\nrelationship to estimate the current transition operator based on adjacent\nsteps. Due to no specific assumptions regarding the network structure,\nLTC-Accel is applicable to almost all diffusion-based methods and orthogonal to\nalmost all existing acceleration techniques, making it easy to combine with\nthem. Experimental results demonstrate that LTC-Accel significantly speeds up\nsampling in text-to-image and text-to-video synthesis while maintaining\ncompetitive sample quality. Specifically, LTC-Accel achieves a speedup of\n1.67-fold in Stable Diffusion v2 and a speedup of 1.55-fold in video generation\nmodels. When combined with distillation models, LTC-Accel achieves a remarkable\n10-fold speedup in video generation, allowing real-time generation of more than\n16FPS.",

The SGMD is based on the upper conversion via\nembedding and down conversion via diagonal averaging principle (DAP) inherited\nfrom the singular spectrum analysis (SSA).

In\norder to overcome these disadvantages, the inverse step for embedding is\nexplored with binary Diophantine equation in number theory. The contributions\nof this work lie in three aspects: firstly, the pulling back theorem is\nproposed and proved, which state the general formula for converting the\ncomponent of trajectory matrix to the component of time sequence for the\ngeneral representation of time sequence and for any time delay $\\tau\\ge 1$;\nsecondly a unified framework for decomposing both the deterministic and random\ntime sequences into multiple modes is presented and explained; finally, the\nguidance of configuring the time delay is suggested, namely the time delay\nshould be selected in a limited range via balancing the efficiency of matrix\ncomputation and accuracy of state estimation.

This work develops the first\nend-to-end theoretical framework for deterministic ODE-based samplers that\nestablishes near-minimax optimal guarantees under mild assumptions on target\ndata distributions. Specifically, focusing on subgaussian distributions with\n$\\beta$-H\\\"older smooth densities for $\\beta\\leq 2$, we propose a smooth\nregularized score estimator that simultaneously controls both the $L^2$ score\nerror and the associated mean Jacobian error.

Short-pulse operation potentially reduces\nbreakdown risks, as experimentally demonstrated by achieving a gradient\nexceeding 350 MV/m. However, the short pulse duration causes the cavity to\noperate in a transient regime where the electromagnetic field deviates from the\nconventional steady-state condition. To investigate the effects of deviations\nfrom steady-state operation, the time-dependent spatial evolution of the cavity\nfields was examined using both 9-ns and 50-ns RF pulses. The 50-ns pulse served\nas a reference to characterize the cavity behavior under a fully filled\nsteady-state condition. Beam dynamics simulations were conducted to explore the\nimpact of transient RF effects on beam kinetic energy, transverse emittance,\nand bunch length; these simulations employed a new dynamic field mapping\napproach to model transient RF fields.",

    "abstract": "A Thorin process is a stochastic process with independent and stationary\nincrements whose laws are weak limits of finite convolutions of gamma\ndistributions. Many popular L\\'evy processes fall under this class. The Thorin\nclass can be characterized by a representing triplet that conveys more\ninformation on the process compared to the L\\'evy triplet. In this paper we\ninvestigate some relationships between the Thorin structure and the process\nproperties, and find that the support of the Thorin measure characterizes the\nexistence of the critical exponential moment, as well as the asymptotic\nequivalence between the L\\'evy tail function and the complementary distribution\nfunction. Furthermore, it is illustrated how univariate Brownian subordination\nwith respect to Thorin subordinators produces Thorin processes whose\nrepresenting measure is given by a pushforward with respect to a hyperbolic\nfunction, leading to arguably easier formulae compared to the Bochner integral\ndetermining the L\\'evy measure. We provide a full account of the theory of\nmultivariate Thorin processes, starting from the Thorin--Bondesson\nrepresentation for the characteristic exponent, and highlight the roles of the\nThorin measure in the analysis of density functions, moments, path variation\nand subordination. Various old and new examples are discussed. We finally\ndetail a treatment of subordination of gamma processes with respect to negative\nbinomial subordinators which is made possible by the Thorin-Bondesson\nrepresentation.",

In this work,\nwe build a model of the BMS transformation that maps a binary black hole's\ninspiral frame to the remnant black hole's canonical rest frame.

We then identified the most informative firing patterns of SA-II\nand HFA afferents, which indicate that average durations of 3-4 s of firing\nprovide sufficient discriminative information. Those two subtypes also exhibit\nrobust tolerance to spike-timing shifts of up to 10-20 ms, varying with touch\nexpressions due to their specific firing properties. Greater shifts in\nspike-timing, however, can change a firing pattern's envelope to resemble that\nof another expression and drastically compromise an afferent's discrimination\ncapacity. Altogether, the findings indicate that SA-II and HFA afferents\ndifferentiate the skin contact of social touch at time scales relevant for such\ninteractions, which are 1-2 orders of magnitude longer than those for\nnon-social touch.",

    "abstract": "The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) and quantum annealing\nare two of the most popular quantum optimization heuristics. While QAOA is\nknown to be able to approximate quantum annealing, the approximation requires\nQAOA angles to vanish with the problem size $n$, whereas optimized QAOA angles\nare observed to be size-independent for small $n$ and constant in the\ninfinite-size limit. This fact led to a folklore belief that QAOA has a\nmechanism that is fundamentally different from quantum annealing. In this work,\nwe provide evidence against this by analytically showing that QAOA energy\napproximates that of quantum annealing under two conditions, namely that angles\nvary smoothly from one layer to the next and that the sum is bounded by a\nconstant. These conditions are known to hold for near-optimal QAOA angles\nempirically. Our results are enabled by novel formulae for QAOA energy with\nconstant sum of angles and arbitrary depth and the series expansion of energy\nin sum of angles, which we obtain using the saddle-point method, which may be\nof independent interest. While our results are limited to the\nSherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model, we show numerically that the expansion\nholds for random 2SAT and expect our main results to generalize to other\nconstraint satisfaction problems. A corollary of our results is a quadratic\nimprovement for the bound on depth required to compile Trotterized quantum\nannealing of the SK model.",

The existence and\nevolutionary behaviors of these components could place strong implication on\nphysical models, such as ejecta composition and dissipation processes. Although\nnumerous GRBs have been found to exhibit one or two spectral components,\nreports of GRBs containing all three components remain rare. In this letter,\nbased on the joint observations of GRB 240825A from multiple gamma-ray\ntelescopes, we conduct a comprehensive temporal and spectral analysis to\nidentify the presence and evolution of all three components. The bulk Lorentz\nfactor of this bright and relatively short-duration burst is independently\ncalculated using the thermal and hard non-thermal components, supporting a jet\npenetration scenario. The multi-segment broken powerlaw feature observed in the\nflux light curves suggests the presence of an early afterglow in the keV-MeV\nband and hints at a possible two-jet structure.

The minimum of the energy dispersion indicates a decoupling of\nthe energy gap from the order parameter, and the compressibility kinks occur\nwhen the energy gap approaches zero.

Within the quantum algorithms\nproposed for problems in excited state quantum chemistry, subspace-based\nquantum algorithms, including quantum subspace expansion (QSE), quantum\nequation of motion (qEOM) and quantum self-consistent equation-of-motion\n(q-sc-EOM), are promising for pre-fault-tolerant quantum devices. The working\nequation of QSE and qEOM requires solving a generalized eigenvalue equation\nwith associated matrix elements measured on a quantum computer. Our\nquantitative analysis of the QSE method shows that the errors in eigenvalues\nincrease drastically with an increase in the condition number of the overlap\nmatrix when a generalized eigenvalue equation is solved in the presence of\nstatistical sampling errors. This makes such methods unstable to errors that\nare unavoidable when using quantum computers. Further, at very high condition\nnumbers of overlap matrix, the QSE's working equation could not be solved\nwithout any additional steps in the presence of sampling errors as it becomes\nill-conditioned. It was possible to use the thresholding technique in this case\nto solve the equation, but the solutions achieved had missing excited states,\nwhich may be a problem for future chemical studies.

    "abstract": "Solving medical imaging data scarcity through semantic image generation has\nattracted significant attention in recent years. However, existing methods\nprimarily focus on generating whole-organ or large-tissue structures, showing\nlimited effectiveness for organs with fine-grained structure. Due to stringent\ntopological consistency, fragile coronary features, and complex 3D\nmorphological heterogeneity in cardiac imaging, accurately reconstructing\nfine-grained anatomical details of the heart remains a great challenge. To\naddress this problem, in this paper, we propose the Fine-grained Cardiac image\nSynthesis(FCaS) framework, established on 3D template conditional diffusion\nmodel. FCaS achieves precise cardiac structure generation using Template-guided\nConditional Diffusion Model (TCDM) through bidirectional mechanisms, which\nprovides the fine-grained topological structure information of target image\nthrough the guidance of template. Meanwhile, we design a deformable Mask\nGeneration Module (MGM) to mitigate the scarcity of high-quality and diverse\nreference mask in the generation process. Furthermore, to alleviate the\nconfusion caused by imprecise synthetic images, we propose a Confidence-aware\nAdaptive Learning (CAL) strategy to facilitate the pre-training of downstream\nsegmentation tasks. Specifically, we introduce the Skip-Sampling Variance (SSV)\nestimation to obtain confidence maps, which are subsequently employed to\nrectify the pre-training on downstream tasks. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat images generated from FCaS achieves state-of-the-art performance in\ntopological consistency and visual quality, which significantly facilitates the\ndownstream tasks as well.

While unrolled DNN\narchitectures provide a robust image formation approach via data-consistency\nlayers, embedding non-uniform fast Fourier transform operators in a DNN can\nbecome impractical to train at large scale, e.g in 2D MRI with a large number\nof coils, or for higher-dimensional imaging. Plug-and-play approaches that\nalternate a learned denoiser blind to the measurement setting with a\ndata-consistency step are not affected by this limitation but their highly\niterative nature implies slow reconstruction. To address this scalability\nchallenge, we leverage the R2D2 paradigm that was recently introduced to enable\nultra-fast reconstruction for large-scale Fourier imaging in radio astronomy.\nR2D2's reconstruction is formed as a series of residual images iteratively\nestimated as outputs of DNN modules taking the previous iteration's data\nresidual as input. The method can be interpreted as a learned version of the\nMatching Pursuit algorithm. A series of R2D2 DNN modules were sequentially\ntrained in a supervised manner on the fastMRI dataset and validated for 2D\nmulti-coil MRI in simulation and on real data, targeting highly under-sampled\nradial k-space sampling. Results suggest that a series with only few DNNs\nachieves superior reconstruction quality over its unrolled incarnation R2D2-Net\n(whose training is also much less scalable), and over the state-of-the-art\ndiffusion-based \"Decomposed Diffusion Sampler\" approach (also characterised by\na slower reconstruction process).",

Adding dissipation, we also\nexperimentally test Bell's general argument for the ensuing energy spectra,\nwhich is at the basis of any model of cosmic ray acceleration. On the one hand,\nour work effectively opens the window to the study of high energy astrophysics\nwith cold atoms, offering new capabilities for the understanding of phenomena\nsuch as diffusive acceleration at collisionless shocks.

We calculate the Stokes parameters for a range of coronal\nconditions using CHIANTI (for intensities) and P-CORONA (for intensities and\npolarization), and use P-CORONA and a realistic global MHD simulation to show\nthat the reduced models provide accurate results, typically to within 5% those\nobtained with larger models. Reduced models provide a significant decrease\n(over three orders of magnitude) in the computational time in\nspectropolarimetric calculations.

    "abstract": "Human pose estimation (HPE) detects the positions of human body joints for\nvarious applications. Compared to using cameras, HPE using radio frequency (RF)\nsignals is non-intrusive and more robust to adverse conditions, exploiting the\nsignal variations caused by human interference. However, existing studies focus\non single-domain HPE confined by domain-specific confounders, which cannot\ngeneralize to new domains and result in diminished HPE performance.\nSpecifically, the signal variations caused by different human body parts are\nentangled, containing subject-specific confounders. RF signals are also\nintertwined with environmental noise, involving environment-specific\nconfounders. In this paper, we propose GenHPE, a 3D HPE approach that generates\ncounterfactual RF signals to eliminate domain-specific confounders. GenHPE\ntrains generative models conditioned on human skeleton labels, learning how\nhuman body parts and confounders interfere with RF signals. We manipulate\nskeleton labels (i.e., removing body parts) as counterfactual conditions for\ngenerative models to synthesize counterfactual RF signals. The differences\nbetween counterfactual signals approximately eliminate domain-specific\nconfounders and regularize an encoder-decoder model to learn domain-independent\nrepresentations. Such representations help GenHPE generalize to new\nsubjects/environments for cross-domain 3D HPE. We evaluate GenHPE on three\npublic datasets from WiFi, ultra-wideband, and millimeter wave. Experimental\nresults show that GenHPE outperforms state-of-the-art methods and reduces\nestimation errors by up to 52.2mm for cross-subject HPE and 10.6mm for\ncross-environment HPE.",

Using electrical transport and magnetization measurements\nup to 50 GPa, we show that such a strange-metal phase is formed in pressurized\nkagome ferromagnet CrNiAs. In contrast to other kagome materials, a linear\nsuppression of the Curie temperature is found, with the ferromagnetic quantum\ncritical point at $p_{\\rm{c}} \\approx 12.5$ GPa. Remarkably, from $p_{\\rm{c}}$\nup to the highest measured pressure, characteristic strange-metal behavior is\nobserved, whereas magnetic field reinstates the Fermi liquid. Electronic\nstructure calculations reveal robust weakly dispersive bands persisting\nunchanged beyond $p_{\\rm{c}}$, possibly at the origin of the $T$-linear\nelectrical resistance.

We also generate rules that can be automatically\nimproved via an amendment process in order to generate the first Sci-Fi\ninspired constitutions for promoting ethical behavior in AIs and robots in the\nreal world. Our first finding is that modern LLMs paired with constitutions\nturn out to be well-aligned with human values (95.8%), contrary to unsettling\ndecisions typically made in Sci-Fi (only 21.2% alignment).

    "abstract": "Safe autonomous exploration of unknown environments is an essential skill for\nmobile robots to effectively and adaptively perform environmental mapping for\ndiverse critical tasks. Due to its simplicity, most existing exploration\nmethods rely on the standard frontier-based exploration strategy, which directs\na robot to the boundary between the known safe and the unknown unexplored\nspaces to acquire new information about the environment. This typically follows\na recurrent persistent planning strategy, first selecting an informative\nfrontier viewpoint, then moving the robot toward the selected viewpoint until\nreaching it, and repeating these steps until termination. However, exploration\nwith persistent planning may lack adaptivity to continuously updated maps,\nwhereas highly adaptive exploration with online planning often suffers from\nhigh computational costs and potential issues with livelocks. In this paper, as\nan alternative to less-adaptive persistent planning and costly online planning,\nwe introduce a new proactive preventive replanning strategy for effective\nexploration using the immediately available actionable information at a\nviewpoint to avoid redundant, uninformative last-mile exploration motion. We\nalso use the actionable information of a viewpoint as a systematic termination\ncriterion for exploration. To close the gap between perception and action, we\nperform safe and informative path planning that minimizes the risk of collision\nwith detected obstacles and the distance to unexplored regions, and we apply\naction-aware viewpoint selection with maximal information utility per total\nnavigation cost. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our action-aware proactive\nexploration method in numerical simulations and hardware experiments.",

Given the substantial amount of papers recently published on the\ntopic, it may be challenging for researchers and practitioners to get a\ncomplete overview of the state-of-the-art.\n  We present a systematic literature review (SLR) featuring 119 papers\nconcerning the automation of code review tasks. We provide: (i) a\ncategorization of the code review tasks automated in the literature; (ii) an\noverview of the under-the-hood techniques used for the automation, including\nthe datasets used for training data-driven techniques; (iii) publicly available\ntechniques and datasets used for their evaluation, with a description of the\nevaluation metrics usually adopted for each task.\n  The SLR is concluded by a discussion of the current limitations of the\nstate-of-the-art, with insights for future research directions.",

    "abstract": "Visual Mamba networks (ViMs) extend the selective state space model (Mamba)\nto various vision tasks and demonstrate significant potential. As a promising\ncompression technique, vector quantization (VQ) decomposes network weights into\ncodebooks and assignments, significantly reducing memory usage and\ncomputational latency, thereby enabling the deployment of ViMs on edge devices.\nAlthough existing VQ methods have achieved extremely low-bit quantization\n(e.g., 3-bit, 2-bit, and 1-bit) in convolutional neural networks and\nTransformer-based networks, directly applying these methods to ViMs results in\nunsatisfactory accuracy. We identify several key challenges: 1) The weights of\nMamba-based blocks in ViMs contain numerous outliers, significantly amplifying\nquantization errors. 2) When applied to ViMs, the latest VQ methods suffer from\nexcessive memory consumption, lengthy calibration procedures, and suboptimal\nperformance in the search for optimal codewords. In this paper, we propose\nViM-VQ, an efficient post-training vector quantization method tailored for\nViMs. ViM-VQ consists of two innovative components: 1) a fast convex\ncombination optimization algorithm that efficiently updates both the convex\ncombinations and the convex hulls to search for optimal codewords, and 2) an\nincremental vector quantization strategy that incrementally confirms optimal\ncodewords to mitigate truncation errors. Experimental results demonstrate that\nViM-VQ achieves state-of-the-art performance in low-bit quantization across\nvarious visual tasks.",

    "abstract": "The online randomized primal-dual method has widespread applications in\nonline algorithm design and analysis. A key challenge is identifying an\nappropriate function space, $F$, in which we search for an optimal updating\nfunction $f \\in F$ that yields the best possible lower bound on the\ncompetitiveness of a given algorithm. The choice of $F$ must balance two\ncompeting objectives: on one hand, it should impose sufficient simplifying\nconditions on $f$ to facilitate worst-case analysis and establish a valid lower\nbound; on the other hand, it should remain general enough to offer a broad\nselection of candidate functions. The tradeoff is that any additional\nconstraints on $f$ that can facilitate competitive analysis may also lead to a\nsuboptimal choice, weakening the resulting lower bound.\n  To address this challenge, we propose an auxiliary-LP-based framework capable\nof effectively approximating the best possible competitiveness achievable when\napplying the randomized primal-dual method to different function spaces.\nSpecifically, we examine the framework introduced by Huang and Zhang (STOC\n2020), which analyzes Stochastic Balance for vertex-weighted online matching\nwith stochastic rewards. Our approach yields both lower and upper bounds on the\nbest possible competitiveness attainable using the randomized primal-dual\nmethod for different choices of ${F}$. Notably, we establish that Stochastic\nBalance achieves a competitiveness of at least $0.5796$ for the problem (under\nequal vanishing probabilities), improving upon the previous bound of $0.576$ by\nHuang and Zhang (STOC 2020). Meanwhile, our analysis yields an upper bound of\n$0.5810$ for a function space strictly larger than that considered in Huang and\nZhang (STOC 2020).",

In PA imaging applications with strong acoustic\nattenuation, such as through human skull bone, the broadband PA waves generated\nby nanoseconds laser pulses are significantly reduced in bandwidth during their\npropagation to a detector. As high-frequency PA signal components are not\ntransmitted through skull, we propose to not generate them by increasing\nexcitation pulse duration.

As a matter of fact, the cost for collecting genomic data is\nhigh, which sometimes makes genomic data unavailable in testing samples. A\ncommon way of tackling such incompleteness is to generate the genomic\nrepresentations from the pathology images. Nevertheless, such strategy still\nfaces the following two challenges: (1) The gigapixel whole slide images (WSIs)\nare huge and thus hard for representation. (2) It is difficult to generate the\ngenomic embeddings with diverse function categories in a unified generative\nframework. To address the above challenges, we propose a Conditional Latent\nDifferentiation Variational AutoEncoder (LD-CVAE) for robust multimodal\nsurvival prediction, even with missing genomic data. Specifically, a\nVariational Information Bottleneck Transformer (VIB-Trans) module is proposed\nto learn compressed pathological representations from the gigapixel WSIs. To\ngenerate different functional genomic features, we develop a novel Latent\nDifferentiation Variational AutoEncoder (LD-VAE) to learn the common and\nspecific posteriors for the genomic embeddings with diverse functions. Finally,\nwe use the product-of-experts technique to integrate the genomic common\nposterior and image posterior for the joint latent distribution estimation in\nLD-CVAE.

Recent studies indicate that the\nheterogeneity of tumor microenvironment (TME) highly affects the distribution\nof NPs across tumors. Hence, it has become a research hotspot to generate the\nNPs distribution by the aid of multi-modal TME components. However, the\ndistribution divergence among multi-modal TME components may cause side effects\ni.e., the best uni-modal model may outperform the joint generative model. To\naddress the above issues, we propose a \\textbf{D}ivergence-\\textbf{A}ware\n\\textbf{M}ulti-\\textbf{M}odal \\textbf{Diffusion} model (i.e.,\n\\textbf{DAMM-Diffusion}) to adaptively generate the prediction results from\nuni-modal and multi-modal branches in a unified network. In detail, the\nuni-modal branch is composed of the U-Net architecture while the multi-modal\nbranch extends it by introducing two novel fusion modules i.e., Multi-Modal\nFusion Module (MMFM) and Uncertainty-Aware Fusion Module (UAFM). Specifically,\nthe MMFM is proposed to fuse features from multiple modalities, while the UAFM\nmodule is introduced to learn the uncertainty map for cross-attention\ncomputation. Following the individual prediction results from each branch, the\nDivergence-Aware Multi-Modal Predictor (DAMMP) module is proposed to assess the\nconsistency of multi-modal data with the uncertainty map, which determines\nwhether the final prediction results come from multi-modal or uni-modal\npredictions. We predict the NPs distribution given the TME components of tumor\nvessels and cell nuclei, and the experimental results show that DAMM-Diffusion\ncan generate the distribution of NPs with higher accuracy than the comparing\nmethods. Additional results on the multi-modal brain image synthesis task\nfurther validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

However, the gap between the training resources (data\nand computation) of the BAMBI models and the LLMs is not fully reflected in\ntheir performance: despite LLMs' massive training, their performance is not\nmuch better than that of BAMBI models.

Our approach offers two key advantages: it works independently of the\nchosen norm while providing the precision needed to classify diverse\nconvergence behaviors, including previously hard-to-characterize rates like\nfractional-power and linearithmic convergence. P-order also systematically\naccommodates weaker continuity conditions by naturally connecting mathematical\nassumptions to appropriate Taylor approximation forms.\n  To enhance practical analysis, we develop two important subclasses, QUP-order\nand UP-order, which work effectively under different smoothness conditions. We\ndemonstrate P-order's practical value through three applications: (1) refining\nfixed-point iteration analysis with minimal smoothness requirements (mere\ndifferentiability suffices where classical analysis required stronger\nconditions), (2) identifying previously unreported convergence rates for\nNewton's method and gradient descent algorithms, and (3) providing a unified\nanalysis of $K$-point methods under $C^{K-1,\\nu}$ (i.e., with H\\\"older\ncontinuous $(K-1)$th derivatives), yielding a new characteristic rate\n$q_{K}(\\nu)$.\n  Our P-order framework provides researchers and practitioners with a sharper,\nmore comprehensive toolbox for convergence analysis, particularly valuable when\nclassical assumptions fail or when analyzing complex convergence behaviors in\nmodern computational applications.",

    "abstract": "We consider the classical $k$-Center problem in undirected graphs. The\nproblem is known to have a polynomial-time 2-approximation. There are even\n$(2+\\varepsilon)$-approximations running in near-linear time. The conventional\nwisdom is that the problem is closed, as $(2-\\varepsilon)$-approximation is\nNP-hard when $k$ is part of the input, and for constant $k\\geq 2$ it requires\n$n^{k-o(1)}$ time under SETH.\n  Our first set of results show that one can beat the multiplicative factor of\n$2$ in undirected unweighted graphs if one is willing to allow additional small\nadditive error, obtaining $(2-\\varepsilon,O(1))$ approximations. We provide\nseveral algorithms that achieve such approximations for all integers $k$ with\nrunning time $O(n^{k-\\delta})$ for $\\delta>0$. For instance, for every $k\\geq\n2$, we obtain an $O(mn + n^{k/2+1})$ time $(2 - \\frac{1}{2k-1}, 1 -\n\\frac{1}{2k-1})$-approximation to $k$-Center. For $2$-Center we also obtain an\n$\\tilde{O}(mn^{\\omega/3})$ time $(5/3,2/3)$-approximation algorithm. Notably,\nthe running time of this $2$-Center algorithm is faster than the time needed to\ncompute APSP.\n  Our second set of results are strong fine-grained lower bounds for\n$k$-Center. We show that our $(3/2,O(1))$-approximation algorithm is optimal,\nunder SETH, as any $(3/2-\\varepsilon,O(1))$-approximation algorithm requires\n$n^{k-o(1)}$ time. We also give a time/approximation trade-off: under SETH, for\nany integer $t\\geq 1$, $n^{k/t^2-1-o(1)}$ time is needed for any\n$(2-1/(2t-1),O(1))$-approximation algorithm for $k$-Center. This explains why\nour $(2-\\varepsilon,O(1))$ approximation algorithms have $k$ appearing in the\nexponent of the running time. Our reductions also imply that, assuming ETH, the\napproximation ratio 2 of the known near-linear time algorithms cannot be\nimproved by any algorithm whose running time is a polynomial independent of\n$k$, even if one allows additive error.",

We introduce a hybrid\napproach that combines the strengths of neural reconstruction with\nphysics-based rendering. This method enables the virtual placement of\ntraditional mesh-based dynamic agents at arbitrary locations, adjustments to\nenvironmental conditions, and rendering from novel camera viewpoints. Our\napproach significantly enhances novel view synthesis quality -- especially for\nroad surfaces and lane markings -- while maintaining interactive frame rates\nthrough our novel training method, NeRF2GS. This technique leverages the\nsuperior generalization capabilities of NeRF-based methods and the real-time\nrendering speed of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). We achieve this by training a\ncustomized NeRF model on the original images with depth regularization derived\nfrom a noisy LiDAR point cloud, then using it as a teacher model for 3DGS\ntraining. This process ensures accurate depth, surface normals, and camera\nappearance modeling as supervision. With our block-based training\nparallelization, the method can handle large-scale reconstructions (greater\nthan or equal to 100,000 square meters) and predict segmentation masks, surface\nnormals, and depth maps. During simulation, it supports a rasterization-based\nrendering backend with depth-based composition and multiple camera models for\nreal-time camera simulation, as well as a ray-traced backend for precise LiDAR\nsimulation.",

Previous studies have typically\nfocused on either enhancing the visual quality of synthesized images at the\nexpense of sampling efficiency or dramatically accelerating sampling without\nimproving the base model's generative capacity. Moreover, nearly all inference\nmethods have not been able to ensure stable performance simultaneously on both\ndiffusion models (DMs) and visual autoregressive models (ARMs). In this paper,\nwe introduce a novel plug-and-play inference paradigm, CoRe^2, which comprises\nthree subprocesses: Collect, Reflect, and Refine. CoRe^2 first collects\nclassifier-free guidance (CFG) trajectories, and then use collected data to\ntrain a weak model that reflects the easy-to-learn contents while reducing\nnumber of function evaluations during inference by half. Subsequently, CoRe^2\nemploys weak-to-strong guidance to refine the conditional output, thereby\nimproving the model's capacity to generate high-frequency and realistic\ncontent, which is difficult for the base model to capture. To the best of our\nknowledge, CoRe^2 is the first to demonstrate both efficiency and effectiveness\nacross a wide range of DMs, including SDXL, SD3.5, and FLUX, as well as ARMs\nlike LlamaGen. It has exhibited significant performance improvements on HPD v2,\nPick-of-Pic, Drawbench, GenEval, and T2I-Compbench. Furthermore, CoRe^2 can be\nseamlessly integrated with the state-of-the-art Z-Sampling, outperforming it by\n0.3 and 0.16 on PickScore and AES, while achieving 5.64s time saving using\nSD3.5.Code is released at https://github.com/xie-lab-ml/CoRe/tree/main.",

The paper studies the\nfollowing problem: for what values of $k>d/2$ does the random $d$-regular graph\nhave a $k$-star decomposition (asymptotically almost surely, provided that the\nnumber of edges is divisible by $k$)?\n  Delcourt, Greenhill, Isaev, Lidick\\'y, and Postle proposed the following\nconjecture. It is easy to see that a $k$-star decomposition necessitates the\nexistence of an independent set of density $1-d/(2k)$. So let\n$k^{\\mathrm{ind}}_d$ be the largest $k$ for which the random $d$-regular graph\na.a.s. contains an independent set of this density. Clearly, $k$-star\ndecompositions cannot exist for $k>k^{\\mathrm{ind}}_d$. The conjecture suggests\nthat this is essentially the only restriction: there is a threshold $k^\\star_d$\nsuch that $k$-star decompositions exist if and only if $k \\leq k^\\star_d$, and\nit (basically) coincides with the other threshold, i.e., $k^\\star_d \\approx\nk^{\\mathrm{ind}}_d$.\n  We confirm this conjecture for sufficiently large $d$ by showing that a\n$k$-star decomposition exists if $d/2< k < k^{\\mathrm{ind}}_d$.

    "abstract": "Deep neural network (DNN) models have shown remarkable success in many\nreal-world scenarios, such as object detection and classification.\nUnfortunately, these models are not yet widely adopted in health monitoring due\nto exceptionally high requirements for model robustness and deployment in\nhighly resource-constrained devices. In particular, the acquisition of\nbiosignals, such as electrocardiogram (ECG), is subject to large variations\nbetween training and deployment, necessitating domain generalization (DG) for\nrobust classification quality across sensors and patients. The continuous\nmonitoring of ECG also requires the execution of DNN models in convenient\nwearable devices, which is achieved by specialized ECG accelerators with small\nform factor and ultra-low power consumption. However, combining DG capabilities\nwith ECG accelerators remains a challenge. This article provides a\ncomprehensive overview of ECG accelerators and DG methods and discusses the\nimplication of the combination of both domains, such that multi-domain ECG\nmonitoring is enabled with emerging algorithm-hardware co-optimized systems.\nWithin this context, an approach based on correction layers is proposed to\ndeploy DG capabilities on the edge. Here, the DNN fine-tuning for unknown\ndomains is limited to a single layer, while the remaining DNN model remains\nunmodified. Thus, computational complexity (CC) for DG is reduced with minimal\nmemory overhead compared to conventional fine-tuning of the whole DNN model.\nThe DNN model-dependent CC is reduced by more than 2.5x compared to DNN\nfine-tuning at an average increase of F1 score by more than 20% on the\ngeneralized target domain. In summary, this article provides a novel\nperspective on robust DNN classification on the edge for health monitoring\napplications.",

    "abstract": "Understanding brain wave patterns is fundamental to uncovering neural\ninformation processing mechanisms, making quantifying complexity across brain\nstates an important line of investigation. We present a comprehensive analysis\nof the complexity of electroencephalography (EEG) signals, integrating data\nfrom seven distinct states experienced by participants undergoing general\nanesthesia, and resting-state recordings from individuals with inattentive-type\nADHD alongside healthy control groups. Departing from prior studies that\nprimarily focus on EEG amplitude dynamics, we adopt a novel relative phase\napproach to extract patterns of information flow directionality based on EEG\nphase dynamics. We quantify the complexity of these relative phase\ndirectionality patterns across various states using permutation entropy (PE)\nand statistical complexity measure within ordinal pattern framework. Our\nanalysis: (i) PE is inversely correlated with the level of consciousness during\ngeneral anesthesia, reflecting a dynamic interplay between anesthetic depth and\nshifts in directional information flow; (ii) healthy subjects consistently show\nhigher PE than inADHD participants; (iii) when mapped onto the\ncomplexity-entropy causality plane, all brain states, regardless of condition\nor individual differences, align along a single curve, suggesting an underlying\nuniversal pattern in brain dynamics; and (iv) brain data consistently exhibit\nhigher complexity than standard stochastic processes, likely due to greater\nmultifractal scaling. These findings highlight that neural information\npropagation, as captured by EEG relative phase dynamics, is governed by\nself-organizing principles that are fundamentally more complex than the\nstochastic processes. Our EEG relative phase-based characterization provides\nnew insight into the complexity of neural information flow directionality.",

Although previous research has\nsought to adapt the successes of generative modelling in homogeneous modalities\nto the tabular domain, defining an effective generator for tabular data remains\nan open problem. One major reason is that the evaluation criteria inherited\nfrom other modalities often fail to adequately assess whether tabular\ngenerative models effectively capture or utilise the unique structural\ninformation encoded in tabular data.

Focusing on this family of models\nwith range-$q$ terms, our investigation furnishes an exhaustive understanding\nof the fractured Hilbert space utilizing the enumerative combinatorics and\ntransfer matrix methods. This further allows us to get insight into the\nfreezing transition in this family of models with the help of the\ngeneralization of Catalan numbers introduced by Frey and Sellers for $q>1$,\nfurther revealing that increasing the range of constraints drives the\ntransition to transpire at lower filling fractions as $n_c = 1/(q+1)$. This\ndistinct fragmentation structure also yields the emergence of ground states at\nmultiple fillings; further, the ground state exhibits signatures of criticality\nwith logarithmic scaling of entanglement entropy. Thereafter, our investigation\nexemplifies that the above transition has a profound impact on the\nthermalization of bulk and boundary autocorrelators at long times, which\nincludes an intricate filling-dependent inhomogeneous long-time autocorrelation\nprofiles across the chain in OBCs. Finally, we probe the effect of the same on\nthe transport at intermediate times in PBCs, restricting ourselves to models up\nto range-3 constraints. This investigation discloses a vast range of anomalous\ntransport possibilities, ranging from size-stretched exponential relaxation\nthrough superdiffusive to subdiffusive behaviors akin to the fragmentation\nstructure supported by the filling fraction and range of constraints.

In this work, we study the scaling laws of\nsystematic generalization with monolingual VLMs for multilingual tasks,\nfocusing on the impact of model size and seen training samples. We propose\nFlorenz, a monolingual encoder-decoder VLM with 0.4B to 11.2B parameters\ncombining the pre-trained VLM Florence-2 and the large language model Gemma-2.\nFlorenz is trained with varying compute budgets on a synthetic dataset that\nfeatures intentionally incomplete language coverage for image captioning, thus,\ntesting generalization from the fully covered translation task. We show that\nnot only does indirectly learning unseen task-language pairs adhere to a\nscaling law, but also that with our data generation pipeline and the proposed\nFlorenz model family, image captioning abilities can emerge in a specific\nlanguage even when only data for the translation task is available. Fine-tuning\non a mix of downstream datasets yields competitive performance and demonstrates\npromising scaling trends in multimodal machine translation (Multi30K, CoMMuTE),\nlexical disambiguation (CoMMuTE), and image captioning (Multi30K, XM3600, COCO\nKarpathy).",

Traditional flight controllers model a large part of the forces but\ndo not take so called residual forces into account. A reason for this is that\naccurately computing the residual forces can be computationally expensive.\nIncremental Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion (INDI) is a method that computes the\ndifference between different sensor measurements in order to estimate these\nresidual forces. The main issue with INDI is it's reliance on special sensor\nmeasurements which can be very noisy. Recent work has also shown that residual\nforces can be predicted using learning-based methods. In this work, we\ndemonstrate that a learning algorithm can predict a smoother version of INDI\noutputs without requiring additional sensor measurements. In addition, we\nintroduce a new method that combines learning based predictions with INDI. We\nalso adapt the two approaches to work on quadrotors carrying a slung-type\npayload.

However, synthesizing\nrealistic surface details still poses great challenges, and enhancing the\ngeometry fidelity of existing lower-quality 3D meshes (instead of\nimage/text-to-3D generation) remains an open problem. In this paper, we\nintroduce SuperCarver, a 3D geometry super-resolution pipeline for\nsupplementing texture-consistent surface details onto a given coarse mesh. We\nstart by rendering the original textured mesh into the image domain from\nmultiple viewpoints. To achieve detail boosting, we construct a deterministic\nprior-guided normal diffusion model, which is fine-tuned on a carefully curated\ndataset of paired detail-lacking and detail-rich normal map renderings. To\nupdate mesh surfaces from potentially imperfect normal map predictions, we\ndesign a noise-resistant inverse rendering scheme through deformable distance\nfield. Experiments demonstrate that our SuperCarver is capable of generating\nrealistic and expressive surface details depicted by the actual texture\nappearance, making it a powerful tool to both upgrade historical low-quality 3D\nassets and reduce the workload of sculpting high-poly meshes.",

In this paper, we develop a 2D multiscale numerical\nmodel based on the finite element method to assess the impact of HE on the LRC\nperformance in fractured rock masses under cyclic gas pressurisation. Within\nthis framework, a large-scale model is used to simulate the deformation and\ndamage evolution of both fractured rock and an LRC under in-situ stresses and\ninternal gas pressurisation, while a small-scale model captures HE in the steel\nlining of the LRC. Our simulations reveal that damage in the rock, concrete,\nand steel degradation is strongly affected by pre-existing fractures and\nin-situ stresses. Our results also reveal the presence of a strong positive\nfeedback between hydrogen concentration and stress redistribution in the steel\nlining. Moreover, a comparison between models with and without considering HE\nilluminates that hydrogen concentration significantly contributes to steel\ndegradation, particularly during the long-term LRC operation, highlighting the\ncritical role of HE in the safety and performance of the LRC. The findings and\ninsights obtained from our work have important implications for the design\noptimisation and performance assessment of LRCs for sustainable underground\nhydrogen storage.",

Often, the\nconditions that give rise to simple diffusion are violated, and many systems,\nsuch as biomolecules inside cells, microswimmers, or particles in turbulent\nflows, undergo anomalous diffusion, featuring an MSD that grows following a\npower law with an exponent $\\alpha$. Precisely determining this exponent and\nthe generalised diffusion coefficient provides valuable information on the\nsystems under consideration, but it is a very challenging task when only a few\nshort trajectories are available, which is common in non-equilibrium and living\nsystems. Estimating the exponent becomes overwhelmingly difficult when the\ndiffusive dynamics switches between different behaviours, characterised by\ndifferent exponents $\\alpha$ or diffusion coefficients $K$. We develop a method\nbased on recurrent neural networks that successfully estimates the anomalous\ndiffusion exponents and generalised diffusion coefficients of individual\ntrajectories that switch between multiple diffusive states.

Through Raman spectroscopy,\nthe phase transition from carbon $sp^3$ to $sp^2$ hybridization was identified,\nprimarily associated with the formation of dumbbell-shaped interstitial\ndefects.

    "abstract": "Semi-supervised learning utilizes insights from unlabeled data to improve\nmodel generalization, thereby reducing reliance on large labeled datasets. Most\nexisting studies focus on limited samples and fail to capture the overall data\ndistribution. We contend that combining distributional information with\ndetailed information is crucial for achieving more robust and accurate\nsegmentation results. On the one hand, with its robust generative capabilities,\ndiffusion models (DM) learn data distribution effectively. However, it\nstruggles with fine detail capture, leading to generated images with misleading\ndetails. Combining DM with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) enables the\nformer to learn data distribution while the latter corrects fine details. While\ncapturing complete high-frequency details by CNNs requires substantial\ncomputational resources and is susceptible to local noise. On the other hand,\ngiven that both labeled and unlabeled data come from the same distribution, we\nbelieve that regions in unlabeled data similar to overall class semantics to\nlabeled data are likely to belong to the same class, while regions with minimal\nsimilarity are less likely to. This work introduces a semi-supervised medical\nimage segmentation framework from the distribution perspective (Diff-CL).\nFirstly, we propose a cross-pseudo-supervision learning mechanism between\ndiffusion and convolution segmentation networks.

The strong seasonal heterogeneity in the southern TP, primarily\ndriven by radiation and agricultural activities, is reflected in the first\nmode, which accounts for 46.34% of the variance.

In\nsummary, ForAug provides a valuable tool for analyzing and mitigating biases,\nenabling the development of more robust and reliable computer vision models.\nOur code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/tobna/ForAug.",

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive performance in\nsynthesizing novel views after training on a given set of viewpoints. However,\nits rendering quality deteriorates when the synthesized view deviates\nsignificantly from the training views. This decline occurs due to (1) the\nmodel's difficulty in generalizing to out-of-distribution scenarios and (2)\nchallenges in interpolating fine details caused by substantial resolution\nchanges and occlusions. A notable case of this limitation is close-up view\ngeneration--producing views that are significantly closer to the object than\nthose in the training set. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel approach\nfor close-up view generation based by progressively training the 3DGS model\nwith self-generated data. Our solution is based on three key ideas. First, we\nleverage the See3D model, a recently introduced 3D-aware generative model, to\nenhance the details of rendered views. Second, we propose a strategy to\nprogressively expand the ``trust regions'' of the 3DGS model and update a set\nof reference views for See3D. Finally, we introduce a fine-tuning strategy to\ncarefully update the 3DGS model with training data generated from the above\nschemes. We further define metrics for close-up views evaluation to facilitate\nbetter research on this problem. By conducting evaluations on specifically\nselected scenarios for close-up views, our proposed approach demonstrates a\nclear advantage over competitive solutions.",

    "abstract": "In XR downlink transmission, energy-efficient power scheduling (EEPS) is\nessential for conserving power resource while delivering large data packets\nwithin hard-latency constraints. Traditional constrained reinforcement learning\n(CRL) algorithms show promise in EEPS but still struggle with non-convex\nstochastic constraints, non-stationary data traffic, and sparse delayed packet\ndropout feedback (rewards) in XR. To overcome these challenges, this paper\nmodels the EEPS in XR as a dynamic parameter-constrained Markov decision\nprocess (DP-CMDP) with a varying transition function linked to the\nnon-stationary data traffic and solves it by a proposed context-aware\nconstrained reinforcement learning (CACRL) algorithm, which consists of a\ncontext inference (CI) module and a CRL module. The CI module trains an encoder\nand multiple potential networks to characterize the current transition function\nand reshape the packet dropout rewards according to the context, transforming\nthe original DP-CMDP into a general CMDP with immediate dense rewards. The CRL\nmodule employs a policy network to make EEPS decisions under this CMDP and\noptimizes the policy using a constrained stochastic successive convex\napproximation (CSSCA) method, which is better suited for non-convex stochastic\nconstraints. Finally, theoretical analyses provide deep insights into the CADAC\nalgorithm, while extensive simulations demonstrate that it outperforms advanced\nbaselines in both power conservation and satisfying packet dropout constraints.",

A longstanding challenge in video\nunderstanding--particularly for long-term or real-time applications--stems from\nthe substantial computational overhead caused by the extensive length of visual\ntokens. To address this, VideoScan employs a single semantic carrier token to\nrepresent each frame, progressively reducing computational and memory overhead\nduring its two-phase inference process: prefilling and decoding. The embedding\nof the semantic carrier token is derived from an optimized aggregation of\nframe-level visual features, ensuring compact yet semantically rich\nrepresentations. Critically, the corresponding key-value pairs are trained to\nretain contextual semantics from prior frames, enabling efficient memory\nmanagement without sacrificing temporal coherence. During inference, the visual\ntokens of each frame are processed only once during the prefilling phase and\nsubsequently discarded in the decoding stage, eliminating redundant\ncomputations. This design ensures efficient VLM inference even under stringent\nreal-time constraints. Comprehensive experiments on diverse offline and online\nbenchmarks demonstrate that LLaVA-Video, supported by our method, achieves up\nto $\\sim 5\\times$ and $1.29\\times$ speedups compared to its original version\nand previous efficient streaming video understanding approaches, respectively.\nCrucially, these improvements are attained while maintaining competitive\nperformance and ensuring stable GPU memory consumption (consistently $\\sim\n18$GB, independent of video duration).",

Traditional recommender\nsystems usually focus only on fixed and simple recommendation scenarios, making\nit difficult to generalize to new and unseen recommendation tasks in an\ninteractive paradigm. Recently, the advancement of large language models (LLMs)\nhas revolutionized the foundational architecture of RecSys, driving their\nevolution into more intelligent and interactive personalized recommendation\nassistants. However, most existing studies rely on fixed task-specific prompt\ntemplates to generate recommendations and evaluate the performance of\npersonalized assistants, which limits the comprehensive assessments of their\ncapabilities.

    "abstract": "OJ 287, a nearby blazar, has exhibited remarkable variability in its optical\nlight curve since 1888, characterized by ~12-year quasi-periodic outbursts.\nThese events are attributed to the orbital dynamics of a supermassive binary\nblack hole system at the heart of the blazar. This study explores the role of\nmagnetic reconnection and the formation of plasmoid chains in driving the\nenergetic processes responsible for OJ 287's variability. We propose that the\npassage of the secondary black hole through the magnetic field of the primary\nblack hole's accretion disk triggers magnetic reconnection, which contributes\nto the observed X-ray and radio emission features in OJ 287. We explore the\nconnection between binary black hole interactions, accretion disk dynamics, and\nthe formation of plasmoid chains as the secondary black hole passes through the\nmagnetic field forest from the accretion disk and the jet of the primary. Our\napproach relies on numerical simulations to understand the formation of\nplasmoid chains resulting from black hole interactions and accretion disk\ndynamics. Based on such results, we employ simulation outcomes to examine the\npotential contribution to observed emissions, validating our assumptions about\nplasmoid chain creation. With this idea, we aim to establish a direct link\nbetween numerical simulations and observed emission, particularly in the case\nof OJ 287. Our findings confirm that the formation of plasmoid chains coincides\nwith specific anomalous emission events observed in OJ 287. Notably, the radio\nemission patterns cannot be explained by a single blob model, as the necessary\nsize to mitigate synchrotron self-absorption would be too large. This\nhighlights the complexity of the emission processes and suggests that plasmoid\nchains could contribute to additional emission components beyond the steady\njet.",

Currently, in the field of pig behavior\nrecognition, the lack of publicly available behavioral datasets not only limits\nthe development of innovative algorithms but also hampers model robustness and\nalgorithm optimization.This paper proposes a dataset containing 13 pig\nbehaviors that significantly impact welfare.Based on this dataset, this paper\nproposes a spatial-temporal perception and enhancement networks based on the\nattention mechanism to model the spatiotemporal features of pig behaviors and\ntheir associated interaction areas in video data. The network is composed of a\nspatiotemporal perception network and a spatiotemporal feature enhancement\nnetwork. The spatiotemporal perception network is responsible for establishing\nconnections between the pigs and the key regions of their behaviors in the\nvideo data. The spatiotemporal feature enhancement network further strengthens\nthe important spatial features of individual pigs and captures the long-term\ndependencies of the spatiotemporal features of individual behaviors by\nremodeling these connections, thereby enhancing the model's perception of\nspatiotemporal changes in pig behaviors. Experimental results demonstrate that\non the dataset established in this paper, our proposed model achieves a MAP\nscore of 75.92%, which is an 8.17% improvement over the best-performing\ntraditional model.

We formulate the\nknowledge consolidation by introducing Depth-aware Representation Fusion (DaRF)\nand Structure-aware Contrastive Hashing (SCH). DaRF adaptively integrates\nshallow and deep representations into blended features, and SCH incorporates\nimage fingerprints to enhance the adaptability of positive/negative pairings.\nThese blended features further facilitate OOD detection and content-based\nrecommendation, contributing to a secure AI-driven healthcare environment.\nMoreover, we present a content-guided ranking to improve the robustness and\nreproducibility of retrieval results. Our comprehensive assessments demonstrate\nthat the proposed method could effectively recognise OOD samples and\nsignificantly outperform existing approaches in medical image retrieval\n(p<0.05). In particular, our method achieves a 5.6-38.9% improvement in mean\nAverage Precision on the anatomical radiology dataset.",

The interactions involved in the predicted trajectories of\nagents, also called post-interactions, have rarely been considered in\ntrajectory prediction models. To this end, we propose a coarse-to-fine\nTransformer for multimodal trajectory prediction, i.e., Pioformer, which\nexplicitly extracts the post-interaction features to enhance the prediction\naccuracy. Specifically, we first build a Coarse Trajectory Network to generate\ncoarse trajectories based on the observed trajectories and lane segments, in\nwhich the low-order interaction features are extracted with the graph neural\nnetworks. Next, we build a hypergraph neural network-based Trajectory Proposal\nNetwork to generate trajectory proposals, where the high-order interaction\nfeatures are learned by the hypergraphs. Finally, the trajectory proposals are\nsent to the Proposal Refinement Network for further refinement. The observed\ntrajectories and trajectory proposals are concatenated together as the inputs\nof the Proposal Refinement Network, in which the post-interaction features are\nlearned by combining the previous interaction features and trajectory\nconsistency features. Moreover, we propose a three-stage training scheme to\nfacilitate the learning process. Extensive experiments on the Argoverse 1\ndataset demonstrate the superiority of our method.

Moreover,\nthe most appropriate evaluation metric of MIA, the True Positive Rate at low\nFalse Positive Rate lacks interpretability. We claim that the incorporation of\nFew-Shot Learning techniques to the MIA field and a proper qualitative and\nquantitative privacy evaluation measure should deal with these issues.

A cylindrical stirrer moves along a circular path at constant\nspeed to stir the fluid, with an initially quiescent domain marked by a passive\ndye in the lower half, facilitating the analysis of dye interface evolution and\nmixing dynamics. We first examine the mixing process in Newtonian fluids,\nidentifying three key mechanisms: interface stretching and folding around the\nstirrer's path, diffusion across streamlines, and dye advection and interface\nstretching due to vortex shedding. Introducing yield stress into the system\nleads to notable localization effects in mixing, manifesting through three\nmechanisms: advection of vortices within a finite distance of the stirrer,\nvortex entrapment near the stirrer, and complete suppression of vortex shedding\nat high yield stresses. Based on these mechanisms, we classify three distinct\nmixing regimes in yield-stress fluids: (i) Regime SE, where shed vortices\nescape the central region, (ii) Regime ST, where shed vortices remain trapped\nnear the stirrer, and (iii) Regime NS, where no vortex shedding occurs. These\nregimes are quantitatively distinguished through spectral analysis of energy\noscillations, revealing transitions and the critical Bingham and Reynolds\nnumbers. The transitions are captured through effective Reynolds numbers,\nsupporting a hypothesis that mixing regime transitions in yield-stress fluids\nshare fundamental characteristics with bluff-body flow dynamics. The findings\nprovide a mechanistic framework for understanding and predicting mixing\nbehaviors in yield-stress fluids, suggesting that the localization mechanisms\nand mixing regimes observed here are archetypal for stirred-tank applications.",

Further more, while existing frameworks\nwith most simple chain-like structures, they struggle with complex non-linear\narchitectures.

In experiments\ncomparing against expert-designed strategies like DeepSeek's DualPipe, our\nframework achieves comparable or superior performance, reducing computational\nbubbles by half under the same memory constraints. The framework's versatility\nextends beyond throughput optimization to incorporate hardware utilization\nmaximization, memory capacity constraints, and other considerations or\npotential strategies.

A critical trade-off\nexists between the temporal resolution (the decision window length used to\ncompute these correlations) and the AAD accuracy.

Given a set of multi-view RGB images\nof human-object interactions, our method reconstructs animatable templates of\nthe human and object as separate sets of Gaussians simultaneously. Different\nfrom existing work, which focuses on human reconstruction and ignores objects\nas background, our method explicitly reconstructs both humans and objects,\nthereby allowing for controllable renderings of novel human object interactions\nin different poses from novel-camera viewpoints. During reconstruction, we\nconstrain the Gaussians that generate rendered images to be a linear function\nof a set of canonical Gaussians. By simply changing the parameters of the\nlinear deformation functions after training, our method can generate renderings\nof novel human-object interaction in novel poses from novel camera viewpoints.\nWe learn the 3D Gaussian properties of the canonical Gaussians on the\nunderlying 2D manifold of the canonical human and object templates. This in\nturns requires a canonical object template with a fixed UV unwrapping. To\ndefine such an object template, we use a feature based representation to track\nthe object across the multi-view sequence. We further propose an occlusion\naware photometric loss that allows for reconstructions under significant\nocclusions. Several experiments on two human-object datasets - BEHAVE and\nDNA-Rendering - demonstrate that our method allows for high-quality\nreconstruction of human and object templates under significant occlusion and\nthe synthesis of controllable renderings of novel human-object interactions in\nnovel human poses from novel camera views.",

This anonymization approach,\nhowever, significantly complicates the analysis of blockchain data. To address\nthis problem, heuristic-based clustering algorithms as an effective way of\nlinking all addresses controlled by the same entity have been presented in the\nliterature. In this paper, considering the particular features of the Extended\nUnspent Transaction Outputs accounting model introduced by the Cardano\nblockchain, two new clustering heuristics are proposed for clustering the\nCardano payment addresses. Applying these heuristics and employing the\nUnionFind algorithm, we efficiently cluster all the addresses that have\nappeared on the Cardano blockchain from September 2017 to January 2023, where\neach cluster represents a distinct entity. The results show that each\nmedium-sized entity in the Cardano network owns and controls 9.67 payment\naddresses on average. The results also confirm that a power law distribution is\nfitted to the distribution of entity sizes recognized using our proposed\nheuristics.",

The deformed relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov\ntheory in continuum (DRHBc) is capable of providing proper descriptions for\nexotic nuclei by simultaneously including deformation and continuum effects.\nThe mass table of even-$Z$ nuclei with $8\\le Z\\le 120$ has been established\nbased on the DRHBc theory [ADNDT 158, 101661 (2024)]. \\textbf{Purpose:} This\nwork aims to systematically estimate the masses of odd-$Z$ nuclei based on the\navailable DRHBc results of even-$Z$ nuclei, thereby providing a pseudo DRHBc\nmass table for all nuclei with $8\\le Z\\le 120$. This mass table can then be\nemployed in the $r$-process studies to investigate the influence of deformation\non $r$-process. \\textbf{Method:} The mass of an odd nucleus is expressed as a\nfunction of the masses and odd-even mass differences of its neighboring even\nnuclei, with the odd-even mass difference approximated by the average pairing\ngap. The $r$-process simulations are carried out using the site-independent\nclassical $r$-process model based on the waiting-point approximation.\n\\textbf{Results and Conclusions:} The approximation of the odd-even mass\ndifference with the average pairing gap is validated to be effective, by\nreproducing the masses of even-$Z$ odd-$N$ nuclei calculated by DRHBc.\nCombining the DRHBc masses of even-$Z$ nuclei and the estimated masses of\nodd-$Z$, a pseudo DRHBc mass table is established, with the root-mean-square\n(rms) deviation from available mass data $\\sigma=1.50$ MeV. This pseudo DRHBc\nmass table is applied to the $r$-process simulation, and the impact of nuclear\ndeformation effects is analyzed. The deformation effects can influence the\n$r$-process path and thus affect the $r$-process abundance. In particular, the\nnuclear shape transitions can even lead to the discontinuity of the $r$-process\npath.",

These shifts arise from user\ncompetition, resource constraints, and adaptive user responses. While prior\nresearch on Algorithmic Recourse has explored its effects on both systems and\nusers, the impact of resource constraints and competition over time remains\nunderexplored.

To address this issue, feature selection methods are widely adopted to\nidentify and remove less important features. However, existing approaches face\ntwo major challenges: (1) they often require complex hyperparameter (Hp)\ntuning, making them difficult to employ in practice, and (2) they fail to\nproduce well-separated feature importance scores, which complicates\nstraightforward feature removal.

Notably, it\ncan generate well-separated feature importance scores and estimate the\nperformance without retraining the model, while introducing only a single Hp.\nExperiments on four public datasets show that our approach outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods in feature selection for model retraining.

Due to digitalisation, they have\nbecome a viable alternative to traditional surveys in application areas such as\npolitical science. One limitation, however, is their dependency on data to\ntrain the model for question selection. Often, such training data (i.e., user\ninteractions) are unavailable a priori. To address this problem, we (i) test\nwhether Large Language Models (LLM) can accurately generate such interaction\ndata and (ii) explore if these synthetic data can be used to pre-train the\nstatistical model of an adaptive political survey. To evaluate this approach,\nwe utilise existing data from the Swiss Voting Advice Application (VAA)\nSmartvote in two ways: First, we compare the distribution of LLM-generated\nsynthetic data to the real distribution to assess its similarity. Second, we\ncompare the performance of an adaptive questionnaire that is randomly\ninitialised with one pre-trained on synthetic data to assess their suitability\nfor training. We benchmark these results against an \"oracle\" questionnaire with\nperfect prior knowledge. We find that an off-the-shelf LLM (GPT-4) accurately\ngenerates answers to the Smartvote questionnaire from the perspective of\ndifferent Swiss parties. Furthermore, we demonstrate that initialising the\nstatistical model with synthetic data can (i) significantly reduce the error in\npredicting user responses and (ii) increase the candidate recommendation\naccuracy of the VAA.

To\naddress this gap, we study the design of steering rewards in Mean-Field Games\n(MFGs) with density-independent transitions, where both the transition dynamics\nand intrinsic reward functions are unknown. This setting presents non-trivial\nchallenges, as the mediator must incentivize the agents to explore for its\nmodel learning under uncertainty, while simultaneously steer them to converge\nto desired behaviors without incurring excessive incentive payments. Assuming\nagents exhibit no(-adaptive) regret behaviors, we contribute novel optimistic\nexploration algorithms. Theoretically, we establish sub-linear regret\nguarantees for the cumulative gaps between the agents' behaviors and the\ndesired ones. In terms of the steering cost, we demonstrate that our total\nincentive payments incur only sub-linear excess, competing with a baseline\nsteering strategy that stabilizes the target policy as an equilibrium.

We show that the lattice QCD results for the nucleon gravitational\nform factors at $m_\\pi=170$~MeV, available for space-like momentum transfer\nsquared up to 2GeV, are explained in a natural way within the meson dominance\napproach. We carry out the proper Raman spin decomposition of the\nenergy-momentum tensor and in each spin channel use a minimum number of\nresonances consistent with the perturbative QCD short-distance constraints.\nThese constraints are related to the super-convergence sum rules, following\nfrom the asymptotic perturbative QCD fall-off of the form factors. The value of\nthe nucleon $D$-term following from the fits is -3.0(4). Next, we obtain the\ntwo-dimensional transverse gravitational densities of the nucleon in the\ntransverse coordinate $b$. With the super-convergence sum rules, we derive new\nsum rules for these densities at the origin and for their derivatives,\ninvolving logarithmic weighting in the corresponding spectral density\nintegrals. From analysis of the threshold behavior in the time-like region and\nthe properties of the $\\pi\\pi \\to N\\bar{N}$ reaction, we infer the behavior of\nthe transverse densities at asymptotically large coordinates.

Recent studies have revealed that\nLarge Language Models (LLMs), with their powerful in-contextual modeling\ncapabilities, hold significant potential for TSF. However, existing LLM-based\nmethods usually perform suboptimally because they neglect the inherent\ncharacteristics of time series data. Unlike the textual data used in LLM\npre-training, the time series data is semantically sparse and comprises\ndistinctive temporal patterns. To address this problem, we propose LLM-PS to\nempower the LLM for TSF by learning the fundamental \\textit{Patterns} and\nmeaningful \\textit{Semantics} from time series data. Our LLM-PS incorporates a\nnew multi-scale convolutional neural network adept at capturing both short-term\nfluctuations and long-term trends within the time series. Meanwhile, we\nintroduce a time-to-text module for extracting valuable semantics across\ncontinuous time intervals rather than isolated time points. By integrating\nthese patterns and semantics, LLM-PS effectively models temporal dependencies,\nenabling a deep comprehension of time series and delivering accurate forecasts.\nIntensive experimental results demonstrate that LLM-PS achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in both short- and long-term forecasting tasks, as\nwell as in few- and zero-shot settings.",

    "abstract": "Blind Face Restoration (BFR) addresses the challenge of reconstructing\ndegraded low-quality (LQ) facial images into high-quality (HQ) outputs.\nConventional approaches predominantly rely on learning feature representations\nfrom ground-truth (GT) data; however, inherent imperfections in GT datasets\nconstrain restoration performance to the mean quality level of the training\ndata, rather than attaining maximally attainable visual quality. To overcome\nthis limitation, we propose a novel framework that incorporates an Image\nQuality Prior (IQP) derived from No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA)\nmodels to guide the restoration process toward optimal HQ reconstructions. Our\nmethodology synergizes this IQP with a learned codebook prior through two\ncritical innovations: (1) During codebook learning, we devise a dual-branch\ncodebook architecture that disentangles feature extraction into universal\nstructural components and HQ-specific attributes, ensuring comprehensive\nrepresentation of both common and high-quality facial characteristics. (2) In\nthe codebook lookup stage, we implement a quality-conditioned Transformer-based\nframework. NR-IQA-derived quality scores act as dynamic conditioning signals to\nsteer restoration toward the highest feasible quality standard. This\nscore-conditioned paradigm enables plug-and-play enhancement of existing BFR\narchitectures without modifying the original structure. We also formulate a\ndiscrete representation-based quality optimization strategy that circumvents\nover-optimization artifacts prevalent in continuous latent space approaches.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art\ntechniques across multiple benchmarks. Besides, our quality-conditioned\nframework demonstrates consistent performance improvements when integrated with\nprior BFR models. The code will be released.",

    "abstract": "The inference process of modern large language models (LLMs) demands\nprohibitive computational resources, rendering them infeasible for deployment\non consumer-grade devices. To address this limitation, recent studies propose\ndistributed LLM inference frameworks, which employ split learning principles to\nenable collaborative LLM inference on resource-constrained hardware. However,\ndistributing LLM layers across participants requires the transmission of\nintermediate outputs, which may introduce privacy risks to the original input\nprompts - a critical issue that has yet to be thoroughly explored in the\nliterature.\n  In this paper, we rigorously examine the privacy vulnerabilities of\ndistributed LLM inference frameworks by designing and evaluating three prompt\ninference attacks aimed at reconstructing input prompts from intermediate LLM\noutputs. These attacks are developed under various query and data constraints\nto reflect diverse real-world LLM service scenarios. Specifically, the first\nattack assumes an unlimited query budget and access to an auxiliary dataset\nsharing the same distribution as the target prompts. The second attack also\nleverages unlimited queries but uses an auxiliary dataset with a distribution\ndiffering from the target prompts. The third attack operates under the most\nrestrictive scenario, with limited query budgets and no auxiliary dataset\navailable. We evaluate these attacks on a range of LLMs, including\nstate-of-the-art models such as Llama-3.2 and Phi-3.5, as well as widely-used\nmodels like GPT-2 and BERT for comparative analysis. Our experiments show that\nthe first two attacks achieve reconstruction accuracies exceeding 90%, while\nthe third achieves accuracies typically above 50%, even under stringent\nconstraints.

We proceed by\nproposing and comparing various direct and model-based \"crowd size signature\nplots,\" which summarize the forecasting performance of k-average forecasts as a\nfunction of k, where k is the number of forecasts in the average. We then\nestimate the equicorrelation model for growth and inflation forecast errors by\nchoosing model parameters to minimize the divergence between direct and\nmodel-based signature plots. The results indicate near-perfect equicorrelation\nmodel fit for both growth and inflation, which we explicate by showing\nanalytically that, under conditions, the direct and fitted equicorrelation\nmodel-based signature plots are identical at a particular model parameter\nconfiguration, which we characterize. We find that the gains from\ndiversification are greater for inflation forecasts than for growth forecasts,\nbut that both gains nevertheless decrease quite quickly, so that fewer SPF\nrespondents than currently used may be adequate.",

In this work, we follow this theme\nby exploring the relationship between vibronic dynamics and the corresponding\nspin polarization of the nonequilibrium charge current in a molecular junction.\nWe employ the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) approach, which, since it\nis numerically exact and treats the vibrational degrees of freedom quantum\nmechanically, extends previous analyses of similar models that relied on\napproximate transport methods. We find significant spin polarization of the\ncharge current in the off-resonant, low-voltage regime, where the vibrations\nmust be treated quantum mechanically. Furthermore, we are able to connect the\nspin polarization in the charge transport to a corresponding polarization of\nthe vibrational dynamics, which manifests itself in the vibrational angular\nmomentum and excitation. Our analysis covers multiple molecule-lead couplings,\ntemperatures, orbital energies, and spin-orbit couplings, demonstrating that\nthe vibrationally assisted spin polarization is robust across a broad range of\nparameters.",

To this end, we propose LEGIBLE, a novel\napproach, following a multi-step process, which starts by mining rules from a\ndeep RL policy, constituting a partially symbolic representation. These rules\ndescribe which decisions the RL policy makes and which it avoids making. In the\nsecond step, we generalize the mined rules using domain knowledge expressed as\nmetamorphic relations. We adapt these relations from software testing to RL to\nspecify expected changes of actions in response to changes in observations. The\nthird step is evaluating generalized rules to determine which generalizations\nimprove performance when enforced. These improvements show weaknesses in the\npolicy, where it has not learned the general rules and thus can be improved by\nrule guidance.

We adapted the IR softness\ndiagram to consider very high-excitation lines, such as [Ne V] 14.3,24.3 $\\mu$m\nor [O IV] 25.9$\\mu$m. The measured emission-line ratios were included as inputs\nfor the code HCm-Teff-IR, in order to provide a quantification for both the\nionization and the $\\alpha_{\\rm OX}$ parameters. The latter is sensitive to the\nspectral shape of the incident continuum in AGN. We applied this to a large AGN\nsample including different spectral types with available Spitzer/IRS,\nHerschel/PACS and/or SOFIA/FIFI-LS mid-IR spectroscopic observations.

The\ninclusion of very high-excitation lines in HCm-Teff-IR, to derive both\n$\\alpha_{\\rm OX}$ and $U$ for the studied sample, points to a bimodal\ndistribution of galaxies. One of the peaks is characterized by relatively\nharder values of $\\alpha_{\\rm OX}$ around -1.4 in combination with low values\nfor log $U$ around -2.4, while the other peak shows a softer $\\alpha_{\\rm OX}$\naround -1.7 and high values of log $U$ around-1.5. This result is consistent\nwith the existence of two very marked AGN populations., one with a softer\nionizing continuum, possibly dominated by a radiatively efficient accretion\ndisk in bright Seyfert nuclei.

    "abstract": "Dust grains embedded in gas flow give rise to a class of hydrodynamic\ninstabilities, called resonant drag instabilities. These instabilities have\npredominantly been studied for single grain sizes, in which case they are found\nto grow fast. Nonlinear simulations indicate that strong dust overdensities can\nform, aiding the formation of planetesimals. In reality, however, there is\ngoing to be a distribution of dust sizes, which potentially has important\nconsequences. We study two different resonant drag instabilities, the streaming\ninstability and the settling instability, taking into account a continuous\nspectrum of grain sizes, to determine whether these instabilities survive in\nthe polydisperse regime and how the resulting growth rates compare to the\nmonodisperse case. We solve the linear equations for a polydisperse fluid in an\nunstratified shearing box to recover the streaming instability and, for\napproximate stratification, the settling instability, in all cases focusing on\nsmall dust-to-gas ratios. Size distributions of realistic width turn the\nsingular perturbation of the monodisperse limit into a regular perturbation due\nto the fact that the backreaction on the gas involves an integration over the\nresonance. The contribution of the resonance to the integral can be negative,\nas in the case of the streaming instability, which as a result does not survive\nin the polydisperse regime, or positive, which is the case in the settling\ninstability. The latter therefore has a polydisperse counterpart, with growth\nrates that can be comparable to the monodisperse case. Wide size distributions\nin almost all cases remove the resonant nature of drag instabilities. This can\nlead to reduced growth, as is the case in large parts of parameter space for\nthe settling instability, or complete stabilisation, as is the case for the\nstreaming instability.",

    "abstract": "In the context of global urbanization and motorization, traffic congestion\nhas become a significant issue, severely affecting the quality of life,\nenvironment, and economy. This paper puts forward a single-agent reinforcement\nlearning (RL)-based regional traffic signal control (TSC) model. Different from\nmulti - agent systems, this model can coordinate traffic signals across a large\narea, with the goals of alleviating regional traffic congestion and minimizing\nthe total travel time. The TSC environment is precisely defined through\nspecific state space, action space, and reward functions. The state space\nconsists of the current congestion state, which is represented by the queue\nlengths of each link, and the current signal phase scheme of intersections. The\naction space is designed to select an intersection first and then adjust its\nphase split. Two reward functions are meticulously crafted. One focuses on\nalleviating congestion and the other aims to minimize the total travel time\nwhile considering the congestion level. The experiments are carried out with\nthe SUMO traffic simulation software. The performance of the TSC model is\nevaluated by comparing it with a base case where no signal-timing adjustments\nare made. The results show that the model can effectively control congestion.\nFor example, the queuing length is significantly reduced in the scenarios\ntested. Moreover, when the reward is set to both alleviate congestion and\nminimize the total travel time, the average travel time is remarkably\ndecreased, which indicates that the model can effectively improve traffic\nconditions. This research provides a new approach for large-scale regional\ntraffic signal control and offers valuable insights for future urban traffic\nmanagement.",

    "abstract": "Flow-based Transformer models have achieved state-of-the-art image generation\nperformance, but often suffer from high inference latency and computational\ncost due to their large parameter sizes. To improve inference efficiency\nwithout compromising quality, we propose Bridged Progressive Rectified Flow\nTransformers (NAMI), which decompose the generation process across temporal,\nspatial, and architectural demensions. We divide the rectified flow into\ndifferent stages according to resolution, and use a BridgeFlow module to\nconnect them. Fewer Transformer layers are used at low-resolution stages to\ngenerate image layouts and concept contours, and more layers are progressively\nadded as the resolution increases. Experiments demonstrate that our approach\nachieves fast convergence and reduces inference time while ensuring generation\nquality. The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows: (1) We\nintroduce Bridged Progressive Rectified Flow Transformers that enable\nmulti-resolution training, accelerating model convergence; (2) NAMI leverages\npiecewise flow and spatial cascading of Diffusion Transformer (DiT) to rapidly\ngenerate images, reducing inference time by 64% for generating 1024 resolution\nimages; (3) We propose a BridgeFlow module to align flows between different\nstages; (4) We propose the NAMI-1K benchmark to evaluate human preference\nperformance, aiming to mitigate distributional bias and comprehensively assess\nmodel effectiveness. The results show that our model is competitive with\nstate-of-the-art models.",

    "abstract": "Computer agents powered by vision-language models (VLMs) have significantly\nadvanced human-computer interaction, enabling users to perform complex tasks\nthrough natural language instructions. However, these agents are vulnerable to\ncontext deception attacks, an emerging threat where adversaries embed\nmisleading content into the agent's operational environment, such as a pop-up\nwindow containing deceptive instructions. Existing defenses, such as\ninstructing agents to ignore deceptive elements, have proven largely\nineffective. As the first systematic study on protecting computer agents, we\nintroduce textbf{in-context defense}, leveraging in-context learning and\nchain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to counter such attacks. Our approach involves\naugmenting the agent's context with a small set of carefully curated exemplars\ncontaining both malicious environments and corresponding defensive responses.\nThese exemplars guide the agent to first perform explicit defensive reasoning\nbefore action planning, reducing susceptibility to deceptive attacks.\nExperiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, reducing attack\nsuccess rates by 91.2% on pop-up window attacks, 74.6% on average on\nenvironment injection attacks, while achieving 100% successful defenses against\ndistracting advertisements. Our findings highlight that (1) defensive reasoning\nmust precede action planning for optimal performance, and (2) a minimal number\nof exemplars (fewer than three) is sufficient to induce an agent's defensive\nbehavior.",

This paradigm shift, driven by a commitment\nto animal welfare, encourages a broader range of natural behaviors through\nabiotic and biotic interactions. This laudable progression nonetheless\nintroduces challenges for population monitoring, adapting daily animal care,\nand automating data collection for long-term research studies. This paper\npresents an IoT-enabled wireless smart feeding station tailored to Goodman's\nmouse lemurs (Microcebus lehilahytsara). System design integrates a precise\nRadio Frequency Identification (RFID) reader to identify the animals' implanted\nRFID chip simultaneously recording body weight and visit duration. Leveraging\nsophisticated electronic controls, the station can selectively activate a\ntrapping mechanism for individuals with specific tags when needed. Collected\ndata or events like a successful capture are forwarded over the Long Range Wide\nArea Network (LoRaWAN) to a web server and provided to the animal caretakers.\nTo validate functionality and reliability under harsh conditions of a tropical\nclimate, the feeding station was tested in the semi-natural Masoala rainforest\nbiome at Zoo Zurich over two months. The station detected an animal's RFID chip\nwhen visiting the box with 98.68 % reliability, a LoRaWAN transmission\nreliability of 97.99 %, and a deviation in weighing accuracy below 0.41 g.\nBeyond its immediate application, this system addresses the challenges of\nautomated population monitoring advancing minimally intrusive animal care and\nresearch on species behavior and ecology.",

While in-plane (within the\nCuO plane) uniaxial stress enhances superconductivity and suppresses stripe\norder, the effects of $c$-axis compression (perpendicular to the CuO plane)\nremains largely unexplored. Here, we use muon spin rotation ($\\mu$SR) and AC\nsusceptibility with an in situ piezoelectric stress device to investigate the\nspin-stripe order and superconductivity in LBCO-0.115 under $c$-axis\ncompression. The measurements reveal a gradual suppression of the\nsuperconducting transition temperature ($T_{\\rm c}$) with increasing $c$-axis\nstress, in stark contrast to the strong enhancement observed under in-plane\nstress. We further show that while in-plane stress rapidly reduces both the\nmagnetic volume fraction ($V_{\\rm m}$) and the spin-stripe ordering temperature\n($T_{\\rm so}$), $c$-axis compression has no effect, with $V_{\\rm m}$ and\n$T_{\\rm so}$ exhibiting an almost unchanged behavior up to the highest applied\nstress of 0.21 GPa.

We propose to integrate\nthese possibilities with existing approaches, such as agent-based models, which\nopens up new modeling spaces including rich citizen models which are able to\nalso represent social interactions.\n  Finally, we put forward some thoughts about a vision of a \"social AI in a\ncity ecosystem\" that adds relevant citizen models to state-of-the-art\nstructural and process models.

First, data assimilation was performed\non two typical airfoils with high angle-of-attack separated flows to obtain a\nhigh-fidelity flow field dataset. Based on this dataset, a white-box model was\ndeveloped using symbolic regression to modify the production term of the SA\nmodel. To validate the effectiveness of the modified model, multiple\nrepresentative airfoils and wings, such as the SC1095 airfoil, DU91-W2-250\nairfoil, and ONERA-M6 wing, were selected as test cases. A wide range of flow\nconditions was considered, including subsonic to transonic regimes, Reynolds\nnumbers ranging from hundreds of thousands to tens of millions, and angles of\nattack varying from small to large. The results indicate that the modified\nmodel significantly improves the prediction accuracy of separated flows while\nmaintaining the predictive capability for attached flows. It notably enhances\nthe reproduction of separated vortex structures and flow separation locations,\nreducing the mean relative error in lift prediction at stall angles by 69.2%\nand improving computational accuracy by more than three times. Furthermore,\nvalidation using a zero-pressure-gradient flat plate case confirms the modified\nmodel's ability to accurately predict the turbulent boundary layer velocity\nprofile and skin friction coefficient distribution.

Traditional studies mainly focus\non BERT-based models to assess the semantic relevance between queries and\nproducts. However, the discriminative paradigm and limited knowledge capacity\nof these approaches restrict their ability to comprehend the relevance between\nqueries and products fully. With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models\n(LLMs), recent research has begun to explore their application to industrial\nsearch systems, as LLMs provide extensive world knowledge and flexible\noptimization for reasoning processes. Nonetheless, directly leveraging LLMs for\nrelevance prediction tasks introduces new challenges, including a high demand\nfor data quality, the necessity for meticulous optimization of reasoning\nprocesses, and an optimistic bias that can result in over-recall. To overcome\nthe above problems, this paper proposes a novel framework called the LLM-based\nRElevance Framework (LREF) aimed at enhancing e-commerce search relevance. The\nframework comprises three main stages: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with Data\nSelection, Multiple Chain of Thought (Multi-CoT) tuning, and Direct Preference\nOptimization (DPO) for de-biasing. We evaluate the performance of the framework\nthrough a series of offline experiments on large-scale real-world datasets, as\nwell as online A/B testing. The results indicate significant improvements in\nboth offline and online metrics. Ultimately, the model was deployed in a\nwell-known e-commerce application, yielding substantial commercial benefits.",

Our method is training-free,\nmodifying only the backward diffusion process, allowing it to be used on any\npretrained ControlNet. Using this process, we show that segmentation models\ntrained with guided synthetic data outperform those trained on non-guided\nsynthetic data.

    "abstract": "Advanced end-to-end autonomous driving systems predict other vehicles'\nmotions and plan ego vehicle's trajectory. The world model that can foresee the\noutcome of the trajectory has been used to evaluate the autonomous driving\nsystem. However, existing world models predominantly emphasize the trajectory\nof the ego vehicle and leave other vehicles uncontrollable. This limitation\nhinders their ability to realistically simulate the interaction between the ego\nvehicle and the driving scenario. In this paper, we propose a driving World\nModel named EOT-WM, unifying Ego-Other vehicle Trajectories in videos for\ndriving simulation. Specifically, it remains a challenge to match multiple\ntrajectories in the BEV space with each vehicle in the video to control the\nvideo generation. We first project ego-other vehicle trajectories in the BEV\nspace into the image coordinate for vehicle-trajectory match via pixel\npositions. Then, trajectory videos are encoded by the Spatial-Temporal\nVariational Auto Encoder to align with driving video latents spatially and\ntemporally in the unified visual space. A trajectory-injected diffusion\nTransformer is further designed to denoise the noisy video latents for video\ngeneration with the guidance of ego-other vehicle trajectories. In addition, we\npropose a metric based on control latent similarity to evaluate the\ncontrollability of trajectories. Extensive experiments are conducted on the\nnuScenes dataset, and the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art\nmethod by 30% in FID and 55% in FVD. The model can also predict unseen driving\nscenes with self-produced trajectories.",

Using job postings from\n596 US public firms that recruited explicitly for GenAI skills (2022-2024), we\nanalyze how GenAI adoption shifts the demand for workers' domain-specific as\nwell as higher-order (domain-agnostic) skills.

Data corruption is unavoidable due to factors such as\nrandom noise, compression artifacts, or environmental conditions in real-world\ndeployment, drastically crippling the entire federated system. To address these\nissues, this paper introduces a novel Robust Asymmetric Heterogeneous Federated\nLearning (RAHFL) framework. We propose a Diversity-enhanced supervised\nContrastive Learning technique to enhance the resilience and adaptability of\nlocal models on various data corruption patterns. Its basic idea is to utilize\ncomplex augmented samples obtained by the mixed-data augmentation strategy for\nsupervised contrastive learning, thereby enhancing the ability of the model to\nlearn robust and diverse feature representations. Furthermore, we design an\nAsymmetric Heterogeneous Federated Learning strategy to resist corrupt feedback\nfrom external clients. The strategy allows clients to perform selective one-way\nlearning during collaborative learning phase, enabling clients to refrain from\nincorporating lower-quality information from less robust or underperforming\ncollaborators. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and\nrobustness of our approach in diverse, challenging federated learning\nenvironments.

The method uncovers feature correlations, captures\ntemporal evolution patterns, and enables precise anomaly detection in\nenvironmental systems.We validated Time-EAPCR's high accuracy and robustness\nacross four publicly available environmental datasets. Experimental results\nshow that the method efficiently handles multi-source data, improves detection\naccuracy, and excels across various scenarios with strong adaptability and\ngeneralisation.

    "abstract": "Image quality scoring and interpreting are two fundamental components of\nImage Quality Assessment (IQA). The former quantifies image quality, while the\nlatter enables descriptive question answering about image quality.\nTraditionally, these two tasks have been addressed independently. However, from\nthe perspective of the Human Visual System (HVS) and the Perception-Decision\nIntegration Model, they are inherently interconnected: interpreting serves as\nthe foundation for scoring, while scoring provides an abstract summary of\ninterpreting. Thus, unifying these capabilities within a single model is both\nintuitive and logically coherent. In this paper, we propose Q-SiT (Quality\nScoring and Interpreting joint Teaching), a unified framework that enables\nlarge multimodal models (LMMs) to learn both image quality scoring and\ninterpreting simultaneously. We achieve this by transforming conventional IQA\ndatasets into learnable question-answering datasets and incorporating\nhuman-annotated quality interpreting data for training. Furthermore, we\nintroduce an efficient scoring & interpreting balance strategy, which first\ndetermines the optimal data mix ratio on lightweight LMMs and then maps this\nratio to primary LMMs for fine-tuning adjustment. This strategy not only\nmitigates task interference and enhances cross-task knowledge transfer but also\nsignificantly reduces computational costs compared to direct optimization on\nfull-scale LMMs. With this joint learning framework and corresponding training\nstrategy, we develop Q-SiT, the first model capable of simultaneously\nperforming image quality scoring and interpreting tasks, along with its\nlightweight variant, Q-SiT-mini. Experimental results demonstrate that Q-SiT\nachieves strong performance in both tasks with superior generalization IQA\nabilities.Project page at https://github.com/Q-Future/Q-SiT.",

This includes the automated selection\nof high-performance model parameters for upload, thereby enhancing the overall\ntraining process. However, it entails significant risks of privacy leakage.\nExisting studies have attempted to mitigate these risks by utilizing\ndifferential privacy. Nevertheless, these studies present two major\nlimitations: (1) The integration of differential privacy into personalized\nfederated learning lacks sufficient personalization, leading to the\nintroduction of excessive noise into the model. (2) It fails to adequately\ncontrol the spatial scope of model update information, resulting in a\nsuboptimal balance between data privacy and model effectiveness in differential\nprivacy federated learning. In this paper, we propose a differentially private\npersonalized federated learning approach that employs dynamically sparsified\nclient updates through reparameterization and adaptive norm(DP-pFedDSU).\nReparameterization training effectively selects personalized client update\ninformation, thereby reducing the quantity of updates. This approach minimizes\nthe introduction of noise to the greatest extent possible. Additionally,\ndynamic adaptive norm refers to controlling the norm space of model updates\nduring the training process, mitigating the negative impact of clipping on the\nupdate information. These strategies substantially enhance the effective\nintegration of differential privacy and personalized federated learning.\nExperimental results on EMNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that our\nproposed scheme achieves superior performance and is well-suited for more\ncomplex personalized federated learning scenarios.",

Above these intensities, the numbers of absorbed photons and\nexcited electrons saturate due to the depletion of one-photon absorption\nchannels, with renewed increases beyond $1~\\mathrm{TW/cm^2}$ for\n$\\mathrm{Cs_3Sb}$ and $5~\\mathrm{TW/cm^2}$ for $\\mathrm{Cs_2Te}$ where\nmulti-photon absorption appears. Finally, the analysis of the occupation\ndensity in $\\mathrm{Cs_3Sb}$ reveals the onset of tunnel ionization at\nintensities above $10~\\mathrm{TW/cm^2}$. Our findings provide new insights into\nthe nonlinear optical properties of $\\mathrm{Cs_3Sb}$ and $\\mathrm{Cs_2Te}$,\ncontributing to the optimization of these materials for the development of\nnext-generation photoinjectors.",

Unlike previous\ngeometric-primitive-based methods that rely on the detection of corners, our\nmethod focuses on edge detection as the primary mechanism for roof\nreconstruction, while utilizing geometric relationships to define corners and\nfaces. We adapt the YOLOv8 OBB model, originally designed for rotated object\ndetection, to extract roof edges effectively. Our method demonstrates\nrobustness against noise and occlusion, leading to precise vectorized\nrepresentations of building roofs. Experiments conducted on the SGA and\nMelville datasets highlight the method's effectiveness. At the raster level,\nour model outperforms the state-of-the-art foundation segmentation model (SAM),\nachieving a mIoU between 0.85 and 1 for most samples and an ovIoU close to\n0.97. At the vector level, evaluation using the Hausdorff distance, PolyS\nmetric, and our raster-vector-metric demonstrates significant improvements\nafter polygonization, with a close approximation to the reference data. The\nmethod successfully handles diverse roof structures and refines edge gaps, even\non complex roof structures of new, excluded from training datasets. Our\nfindings underscore the potential of this approach to address challenges in\nautomatic roof structure vectorization, supporting various applications such as\nurban terrain reconstruction.",

    "abstract": "Bimanual robotic manipulation is an emerging and critical topic in the\nrobotics community. Previous works primarily rely on integrated control models\nthat take the perceptions and states of both arms as inputs to directly predict\ntheir actions. However, we think bimanual manipulation involves not only\ncoordinated tasks but also various uncoordinated tasks that do not require\nexplicit cooperation during execution, such as grasping objects with the\nclosest hand, which integrated control frameworks ignore to consider due to\ntheir enforced cooperation in the early inputs. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel decoupled interaction framework that considers the characteristics of\ndifferent tasks in bimanual manipulation. The key insight of our framework is\nto assign an independent model to each arm to enhance the learning of\nuncoordinated tasks, while introducing a selective interaction module that\nadaptively learns weights from its own arm to improve the learning of\ncoordinated tasks. Extensive experiments on seven tasks in the RoboTwin dataset\ndemonstrate that: (1) Our framework achieves outstanding performance, with a\n23.5% boost over the SOTA method. (2) Our framework is flexible and can be\nseamlessly integrated into existing methods. (3) Our framework can be\neffectively extended to multi-agent manipulation tasks, achieving a 28% boost\nover the integrated control SOTA. (4) The performance boost stems from the\ndecoupled design itself, surpassing the SOTA by 16.5% in success rate with only\n1/6 of the model size.",

    "abstract": "Incomplete multi-view clustering (IMVC) has garnered increasing attention in\nrecent years due to the common issue of missing data in multi-view datasets.\nThe primary approach to address this challenge involves recovering the missing\nviews before applying conventional multi-view clustering methods. Although\nimputation-based IMVC methods have achieved significant improvements, they\nstill encounter notable limitations: 1) heavy reliance on paired data for\ntraining the data recovery module, which is impractical in real scenarios with\nhigh missing data rates; 2) the generated data often lacks diversity and\ndiscriminability, resulting in suboptimal clustering results. To address these\nshortcomings, we propose a novel IMVC method called Diffusion Contrastive\nGeneration (DCG). Motivated by the consistency between the diffusion and\nclustering processes, DCG learns the distribution characteristics to enhance\nclustering by applying forward diffusion and reverse denoising processes to\nintra-view data. By performing contrastive learning on a limited set of paired\nmulti-view samples, DCG can align the generated views with the real views,\nfacilitating accurate recovery of views across arbitrary missing view\nscenarios. Additionally, DCG integrates instance-level and category-level\ninteractive learning to exploit the consistent and complementary information\navailable in multi-view data, achieving robust and end-to-end clustering.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art\napproaches.

High-frequency-peaked BL Lacs (HBLs) and extreme\nhigh-frequency-peaked BL Lacs (EHBLs) are especially interesting because the\npolarimetric properties of their synchrotron emission, extending up to the\nX-ray band, can be fully tracked by sensitive polarimetric measurements. We\ninvestigated the polarization properties of the synchrotron emission of these\nsources, starting directly from relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of\nrecollimated relativistic jets. To bridge the gap between fluid and kinetic\nscales, we elaborated a post-processing code based on the Lagrangian\nmacroparticle approach, which models the spectral evolution and emission of\nnonthermal particles within the jet given the local fluid conditions. When\ncomparing our results with early particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations, we find\nthat shocks formed through jet recollimation are primarily superluminal,\nlimiting particle acceleration in a laminar flow. However, recent PIC\nsimulations suggest that acceleration can occur in the presence of small-scale\nturbulence or inhomogeneities even in a superluminal configuration. In this\ncase, we reproduce the observed polarization chromaticity (i.e., the\npolarization degree increases with frequency), along with a stable polarization\nangle between the X-ray and optical bands. This study sheds light on the role\nof recollimation shocks in blazar jets and supports the energy-stratified shock\nmodel as a plausible explanation for IXPE observations.",

    "abstract": "This paper examines the number of communication modes, that is, the degrees\nof freedom (DoF) in a wireless line-of-sight channel comprising a small\ncontinuous linear intelligent antenna array in the near field of a large one.\nThe framework allows for any orientations between the arrays and any positions\nin a two-dimensional space assuming that the transmitting array is placed at\nthe origin. Therefore, apart from the length of the two continuous arrays, four\nkey parameters determine the DoF and are hence considered in the analysis: the\nCartesian coordinates of the center of the receiving array and two angles that\nmodel the rotation of each array around its center. The paper starts with the\ncalculation of the deterministic DoF for a generic geometric setting, which\nextends beyond the widely studied paraxial case. Subsequently, a stochastic\ngeometry framework is proposed to study the statistical DoF, as a first step\ntowards the investigation of the system-level performance in near field\nnetworks. Numerical results applied to millimeter wave networks reveal the\nlarge number of DoF provided by near-field communications and unveil key\nsystem-level insights. A comparison of the proposed method with the singular\nvalue decomposition-based method is illustrated to validate the model.",

The\nincorporation of advanced language understanding techniques has substantially\nimproved the dialogue fluency of such systems. However, while modern language\nmodels demonstrate strong proficiency in interpreting user preferences\narticulated through natural conversation, they frequently encounter challenges\nin effectively utilizing collective behavioral patterns - a crucial element for\ngenerating relevant suggestions. To mitigate this limitation, this work\npresents a novel probabilistic framework that synergizes behavioral patterns\nwith conversational interactions through latent preference modeling. The\nproposed method establishes a dual-channel alignment mechanism where implicit\npreference representations learned from collective user interactions serve as a\nconnecting mechanism between behavioral data and linguistic expressions.\nSpecifically, the framework first derives latent preference representations\nthrough established collaborative filtering techniques, then employs these\nrepresentations to jointly refine both the linguistic preference expressions\nand behavioral patterns through an adaptive fusion process. Comprehensive\nevaluations across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior\nperformance of the proposed approach compared to various state-of-the-art\nbaseline methods, particularly in aligning conversational interactions with\ncollaborative behavioral signals.",

Recent\nadvancements in trajectory planning have leveraged vision-language models\n(VLMs) to extract contextual information for robots operating in real-world\nenvironments. While these methods achieve satisfying performance, they do not\nexplicitly model human activities. Such activities influence surrounding\nobjects and reshape spatial constraints. This paper presents a novel approach\nto trajectory planning that integrates human preferences, activities, and\nspatial context through an enriched 3D scene graph (3DSG) representation. By\nincorporating activity-based relationships, our method captures the spatial\nimpact of human actions, leading to more context-sensitive trajectory\nadaptation. Preliminary results demonstrate that our approach effectively\nassigns costs to spaces influenced by human activities, ensuring that the robot\ntrajectory remains contextually appropriate and sensitive to the ongoing\nenvironment.

The pairs overlap and\ncannot be distinguished as separate dipoles. The HR-EBSD-measured\nautocorrelation functions of the strain and rotation components follow the\nexpected logarithmic law for distances smaller than the screening distances and\nbecome zero for larger distances, which is confirmed by the Monte Carlo\nsimulations.

In small-world networks, the\nprevalence follows a Gompertz-like curve, while in fractal networks it evolves\naccording to Avrami-type dynamics, which is typical of spatially constrained\nsystems. These regimes define distinct universality classes that remain robust\nacross arbitrary transmission rates. Notably, our approach provides explicit\nanalytical formulas for the global epidemic prevalence and class-specific\nscaling relations capturing its dependence on the transmission rate. We show\nthat the commonly assumed early exponential growth occurs only in small-world\nnetworks, where it corresponds to the short-time approximation of the Gompertz\nfunction. In contrast, this exponential phase is entirely absent in fractal\nnetworks, where spreading is markedly slower and governed by different\nmechanisms.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated unprecedented generative\ncapabilities, yet their alignment with human values remains critical for\nensuring helpful and harmless deployments. While Reinforcement Learning from\nHuman Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for aligning LLMs with\nhuman preferences, its reliance on complex reward modeling introduces inherent\ntrade-offs in computational efficiency and training stability. In this context,\nDirect Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently gained prominence as a\nstreamlined alternative that directly optimizes LLMs using human preferences,\nthereby circumventing the need for explicit reward modeling. Owing to its\ntheoretical elegance and computational efficiency, DPO has rapidly attracted\nsubstantial research efforts exploring its various implementations and\napplications. However, this field currently lacks systematic organization and\ncomparative analysis. In this survey, we conduct a comprehensive overview of\nDPO and introduce a novel taxonomy, categorizing previous works into four key\ndimensions: data strategy, learning framework, constraint mechanism, and model\nproperty. We further present a rigorous empirical analysis of DPO variants\nacross standardized benchmarks. Additionally, we discuss real-world\napplications, open challenges, and future directions for DPO. This work\ndelivers both a conceptual framework for understanding DPO and practical\nguidance for practitioners, aiming to advance robust and generalizable\nalignment paradigms.

To address this gap, we\npropose FaVChat, the first VMLLM specifically designed for fine-grained facial\nvideo understanding. To facilitate its training, we construct a large-scale\nfacial video dataset comprising over 60k videos, with the majority annotated\nwith 83 fine-grained facial attributes. These attributes are incorporated to\nenrich GPT-4o-generated captions, yielding 60k high-quality video-summary pairs\nand an additional 170k fine-grained question-answering (QA) pairs. To\neffectively capture rich facial clues, we propose a hybrid model architecture\ncomposed of a general visual encoder, a dedicated facial encoder, and a\nmixture-of-experts-enhanced adapter for adaptive fusion of multi-source visual\nfeatures. To mitigate information loss during feature transformation, we\nextract multi-granularity representations from the facial encoder and integrate\nthem into the subsequent LLM. This design enhances the model's ability to\ncomprehend and respond to questions involving diverse levels of visual details.\nWe employ a progressive training paradigm, transitioning from video\nsummarization to a high-quality subset of video QA, gradually increasing task\ncomplexity to enhance the model's fine-grained visual perception.

    "abstract": "We introduce Reangle-A-Video, a unified framework for generating synchronized\nmulti-view videos from a single input video. Unlike mainstream approaches that\ntrain multi-view video diffusion models on large-scale 4D datasets, our method\nreframes the multi-view video generation task as video-to-videos translation,\nleveraging publicly available image and video diffusion priors. In essence,\nReangle-A-Video operates in two stages. (1) Multi-View Motion Learning: An\nimage-to-video diffusion transformer is synchronously fine-tuned in a\nself-supervised manner to distill view-invariant motion from a set of warped\nvideos. (2) Multi-View Consistent Image-to-Images Translation: The first frame\nof the input video is warped and inpainted into various camera perspectives\nunder an inference-time cross-view consistency guidance using DUSt3R,\ngenerating multi-view consistent starting images. Extensive experiments on\nstatic view transport and dynamic camera control show that Reangle-A-Video\nsurpasses existing methods, establishing a new solution for multi-view video\ngeneration. We will publicly release our code and data. Project page:\nhttps://hyeonho99.github.io/reangle-a-video/",

Current long-context vision-language models~(LVLMs) suffer\nfrom information loss due to compression and brute-force downsampling. While\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods mitigate this issue, their\napplicability is limited due to explicit query dependency. To overcome this\nchallenge, we introduce a novel memory-enhanced RAG-based approach called\nMemVid, which is inspired by the cognitive memory of human beings. Our approach\noperates in four basic steps: 1) memorizing holistic video information, 2)\nreasoning about the task's information needs based on memory, 3) retrieving\ncritical moments based on the information needs, and 4) focusing on the\nretrieved moments to produce the final answer. To enhance the system's\nmemory-grounded reasoning capabilities while achieving optimal end-to-end\nperformance, we propose a curriculum learning strategy. This approach begins\nwith supervised learning on well-annotated reasoning results, then\nprogressively explores and reinforces more plausible reasoning outcomes through\nreinforcement learning. We perform extensive evaluations on popular LVU\nbenchmarks, including MLVU, VideoMME and LVBench.

However, a disparity between virtual and real nodes persists,\ncomplicating the application of learning patterns derived from virtual nodes to\nactual unobserved ones. To address these limitations, this paper presents a\nPhysics-Guided Increment Training Strategy (PGITS). Specifically, we design a\ndynamic graph generation module to incorporate the advection and diffusion\nprocesses of airborne particles as physical knowledge into the graph structure,\ndynamically adjusting the adjacency matrix to reflect physical interactions\nbetween nodes. By using physics principles as a bridge between virtual and real\nnodes, this strategy ensures the features of virtual nodes and their pseudo\nlabels are closer to actual nodes.

Additionally,\nwe propose a task affinity (TA) metric to capture the dynamic correlation among\ntasks, thereby promoting task knowledge sharing to accelerate training and\nimprove the generalization ability of the model in different scenarios. To\noptimize resource allocation, we formulate a two-layer optimization problem to\njointly optimize UAV transmission power, computation frequency, bandwidth\nallocation, and UAV-EV associations. For the inner problem, we derive\nclosed-form solutions for transmission power, computation frequency, and\nbandwidth allocation and apply a block coordinate descent method for\noptimization.

First, we use a simple idealised system to analyse\nthe effect of observation-error correlations on the spectral characteristics of\nthe solution. Next, we assess the relevance of these results in a more\nrealistic setting in which simulated alongtrack (nadir) altimeter observations\nwith correlated errors are assimilated in a global ocean model using a\nthree-dimensional variational assimilation (3D-Var) method. Correlated\nobservation errors are modelled in the 3D-Var system using a diffusion\noperator. When the correlation length scale of observation error is small\ncompared to that of background error, inflating the observation-error variances\ncan mitigate most of the negative effects from neglecting the observation-error\ncorrelations. Accounting for observation-error correlations in this situation\nstill outperforms variance inflation since it allows small-scale information in\nthe observations to be more effectively extracted and does not affect the\nconvergence of the minimization. Conversely, when the correlation length scale\nof observation error is large compared to that of background error, the effect\nof observation-error correlations cannot be properly approximated with variance\ninflation. However, the correlation model needs to be constructed carefully to\nensure the minimization problem is adequately conditioned so that a robust\nsolution can be obtained. Practical ways to achieve this are discussed.",

Our 19 epochs of spectral observations, spanning 1.2\nyears with intervals as short as 1 day, provide the most comprehensive cadence\ncoverage for monitoring HI absorption to date. We identified two significant\ndetections of tiny-scale atomic structure (TSAS) with spatial scales ranging\nfrom a lower limit of $\\sim$11 au to an upper limit of 165 au, both exhibiting\nintegrated signal-to-noise ratios exceeding 5.0. We find a relationship between\nlinear size and optical depth variation in the cold neutral medium (CNM)\ncomponent hosting the TSAS, described by a power-law relationship,\n$\\Delta\\tau_{\\rm int} = \\Delta\\tau_0 (\\Delta L)^{(\\alpha-2)/2}$, with $\\alpha =\n4.1 \\pm 0.4$. This is the first observational evidence explicitly connecting\nTSAS to turbulence in CNM. This power-law index is significantly steeper than\npreviously reported values for the CNM, where $\\alpha$ ranges from 2.3 to 2.9,\nbut similar to those observed in the warm ionized gas. Additionally, we observe\nno significant variation in $\\alpha$ across the entire range of spatial scales\ntraced in our study, indicating that turbulence may be cascading down and\ndissipating at smaller scales. While there is no precise proper motion\nmeasurement for this pulsar, our estimates for the turbulence dissipation in\nthe CNM place the lower and upper limits at less than 0.03 au and 0.4 au,\nrespectively.",

Changing atmospheric conditions due to climate and weather\npatterns, particularly variation in cloud cover, can significantly affect the\nspectrum in ways that complicate the understanding of a planet's baseline\natmospheric properties. Variable cloud cover and cloud properties affect the\ndetectability of atmospheric constituents, and also greatly influence the\nradiative transfer that determines a planet's spectrum. This has considerable\nimplications for direct imaging observations of potentially habitable\nexoplanets and thus it is critical to study and characterize the effects of\nclouds on their spectra. Clouds have been extensively modeled before and their\neffects have been incorporated across climate frameworks spanning a spectrum of\ncomplexity. Given the challenges associated with modeling clouds, we adopt a\nnovel approach in this work to study the effects of clouds by using real-time\ncloud data from Earth observations. Treating Earth as an exoplanet and using\ndetailed observations from the MERRA 2 data collection, we quantify the effects\nof cloud variability on the spectrum as well as on the detectability of\natmospheric constituents, specifically biomarkers like O2, O3 and H2O. The\ncoverage and vertical position of clouds significantly affects the SNRs of\nthese gases and subsequently their detectability in exo-Earth atmospheres.\nMoreover, we show that variations in the amount of cloud cover will potentially\nconfound efforts to retrieve a stable baseline atmosphere for a planet.

This research extends the Chain\nof Draft (CoD) method to software engineering, designing and evaluating\nmultiple CoD variants tailored for code tasks. Through comprehensive\nexperiments on all 300 samples from the SWE-bench benchmark, we found that all\nCoD variants used significantly fewer tokens than Chain of Thought (CoT), with\nBaseline CoD being most efficient at 55.4% of CoT's tokens.

Existing methods often overfit to the source image structure,\nlimiting their ability to adapt to the substantial structural modifications\ndemanded by new interactions.

The\ncapability for effectively treating the disorders, including both diagonal and\noff-diagonal disorders, is indispensable for quantum transport simulation of\nrealistic device materials. In this work, we report a self-consistent\nnonequilibrium mean-field quantum transport approach, by combining the\nauxiliary coherent potential approximation (ACPA) and non-equilibrium Green's\nfunction method, for calculating the phonon transport through disordered\nmaterial structures with the force-constant disorders (including the\nAnderson-type disorder). The nonequilibrium vertex correction (NVC) is derived\nin an extended local degree of freedom to account for both the multiple\ndisorder scattering by force-constant disorder and the nonequilibrium quantum\nstatistics. We have tested ACPA-NVC method with the fluctuation-dissipation\ntheorem at the equilibrium and obtained very good agreement with supercell\ncalculations for the phonon transmission. To demonstrate the applicability, we\napply ACPA-NVC to calculate the thermal conductance for the disordered Ni/Pt\ninterface, and important effects of force-constant disorder are revealed.\nACPA-NVC method provides an effective quantum transport approach for simulating\ndisordered nanoscale devices, and the generalization to simulate disordered\nnanoelectronic device is straightforward.",

AdvAD\ninnovatively conceptualizes attacking as a non-parametric diffusion process by\ntheoretically exploring basic modeling approach rather than using the denoising\nor generation abilities of regular diffusion models requiring neural networks.\nAt each step, much subtler yet effective adversarial guidance is crafted using\nonly the attacked model without any additional network, which gradually leads\nthe end of diffusion process from the original image to a desired imperceptible\nadversarial example.

    "abstract": "Given two subsets $A, B \\subseteq \\mathbb{F}_p$ and a binary relation\n$\\mathcal{R} \\subseteq A \\times B$, the restricted sumset of $A, B$ with\nrespect to $\\mathcal{R}$ is defined as $A +_{\\mathcal{R}} B = \\{ a+b \\colon\n(a,b) \\notin \\mathcal{R} \\}$. When $\\mathcal{R}$ is taken as the equality\nrelation, determining the minimum value of $|A +_{\\mathcal{R}} B|$ is the\nfamous Erd\\H{o}s--Heilbronn problem, which was solved separately by Dias da\nSilva, Hamidoune and Alon, Nathanson and Ruzsa. Lev later conjectured that if\n$A, B \\subseteq \\mathbb{F}_p$ with $|A| + |B| \\le p$ and $\\mathcal{R}$ is a\nmatching between subsets of $A$ and $B$, then $|A +_{\\mathcal{R}} B| \\ge |A| +\n|B| - 3$.\n  We confirm this conjecture in the case where $|A| + |B| \\le (1-\\varepsilon)p$\nfor any $\\varepsilon > 0$, provided that $p > p_0$ for some sufficiently large\n$p_0$ depending only on $\\varepsilon$. Our proof builds on a recent work by\nBollob\\'as, Leader, and Tiba, and a rectifiability argument developed by Green\nand Ruzsa. Furthermore, our method extends to cases when $\\mathcal{R}$ is a\ndegree-bounded relation, either on both sides $A$ and $B$ or solely on the\nsmaller set.\n  In addition, we construct subsets $A \\subseteq \\mathbb{F}_p$ with $|A| =\n\\frac{6p}{11} - O(1)$ such that $|A +_{\\mathcal{R}} A| = p-3$ for any prime\nnumber $p$, where $\\mathcal{R}$ is a matching on $A$. This extends an earlier\nconstruction by Lev and highlights a distinction between the combinatorial\nnotion of the restricted sumset and the classcial Erd\\H{o}s--Heilbronn problem,\nwhere $|A +_{\\mathcal{R}} A| \\ge p$ holds given $\\mathcal{R} = \\{(a,a) \\colon a\n\\in A\\}$ is the equality relation on $A$ and $|A| \\ge \\frac{p+3}{2}$.",

    "abstract": "The rapid rise of Language Models (LMs) has expanded the capabilities of\nnatural language processing, powering applications from text generation to\ncomplex decision-making. While state-of-the-art LMs often boast hundreds of\nbillions of parameters and are primarily deployed in data centers, recent\ntrends show a growing focus on compact models-typically under 10 billion\nparameters-enabled by techniques such as quantization and other model\ncompression techniques. This shift paves the way for LMs on edge devices,\noffering potential benefits such as enhanced privacy, reduced latency, and\nimproved data sovereignty. However, the inherent complexity of even these\nsmaller models, combined with the limited computing resources of edge hardware,\nraises critical questions about the practical trade-offs in executing LM\ninference outside the cloud. To address these challenges, we present a\ncomprehensive evaluation of generative LM inference on representative CPU-based\nand GPU-accelerated edge devices. Our study measures key performance\nindicators-including memory usage, inference speed, and energy\nconsumption-across various device configurations. Additionally, we examine\nthroughput-energy trade-offs, cost considerations, and usability, alongside an\nassessment of qualitative model performance. While quantization helps mitigate\nmemory overhead, it does not fully eliminate resource bottlenecks, especially\nfor larger models. Our findings quantify the memory and energy constraints that\nmust be considered for practical real-world deployments, offering concrete\ninsights into the trade-offs between model size, inference performance, and\nefficiency. The exploration of LMs at the edge is still in its early stages. We\nhope this study provides a foundation for future research, guiding the\nrefinement of models, the enhancement of inference efficiency, and the\nadvancement of edge-centric AI systems.",

Conventional data-driven methods often lack physical\nplausibility, while physics-based models are limited by incomplete system\nknowledge. To address this, we integrate domain knowledge into deep learning\nusing constraints to enforce monotonicity, bound output values between 1 and 0\n(representing healthy to failed states), and ensure consistency between signal\nenergy trends and health indicator estimates. This eliminates the need for\ncomplex loss term balancing. We implement constraint-guided gradient descent\nwithin an autoencoder architecture, creating a constrained autoencoder.\nHowever, the framework is adaptable to other architectures. Using\ntime-frequency representations of accelerometer signals from the Pronostia\ndataset, our constrained model generates smoother, more reliable degradation\nprofiles compared to conventional methods, aligning with expected physical\nbehavior. Performance is assessed using three metrics: trendability,\nrobustness, and consistency. Compared to a conventional baseline, the\nconstrained model improves all three. Another baseline, incorporating\nmonotonicity via a soft-ranking loss function, outperforms in trendability but\nfalls short in robustness and consistency. An ablation study confirms that the\nmonotonicity constraint enhances trendability, the boundary constraint ensures\nconsistency, and the energy-health consistency constraint improves robustness.\nThese findings highlight the effectiveness of constraint-guided deep learning\nin producing reliable, physically meaningful health indicators, offering a\npromising direction for future prognostic applications.",

Existing methods typically train from\nscratch, overlooking the potential of base models, and often resort to data\nstorage to prevent forgetting. Moreover, because RF-CCD encompasses both\ncontinual learning and novel class discovery, previous approaches have\nstruggled to effectively integrate advanced techniques from these fields,\nresulting in less convincing comparisons and failing to reveal the unique\nchallenges posed by RF-CCD.

To mitigate representation\ndegradation, we propose a straightforward yet highly effective baseline method.\nThis method first utilizes prior knowledge of known categories to estimate the\nnumber of novel classes. It then acquires representations using a model\nspecifically trained on the base classes, generates high-quality pseudo-labels\nthrough k-means clustering, and trains only the classifier layer.

    "abstract": "As artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) continues to evolve,\nvideo-to-audio (V2A) generation has emerged as a key area with promising\napplications in multimedia editing, augmented reality, and automated content\ncreation. While Transformer and Diffusion models have advanced audio\ngeneration, a significant challenge persists in extracting precise semantic\ninformation from videos, as current models often lose sequential context by\nrelying solely on frame-based features. To address this, we present TA-V2A, a\nmethod that integrates language, audio, and video features to improve semantic\nrepresentation in latent space. By incorporating large language models for\nenhanced video comprehension, our approach leverages text guidance to enrich\nsemantic expression. Our diffusion model-based system utilizes automated text\nmodulation to enhance inference quality and efficiency, providing personalized\ncontrol through text-guided interfaces. This integration enhances semantic\nexpression while ensuring temporal alignment, leading to more accurate and\ncoherent video-to-audio generation.",

ECF integrates biological pathway-based abstractions with expert\nknowledge, optimized with quasi-rules derived from clinical trial data to\novercome the limitations of traditional methods.\n  Methods: ECF employs a disease pathogenesis graph to encode domain knowledge,\nreducing the parameter space through mechanistic functions and sparse network\nstructures. Optimization may be performed using a loss function inspired by the\nThurstone-Mosteller model, focusing on pairwise regimen comparisons. A pilot\nstudy was conducted for acne vulgaris to evaluate ECF's ability in both tested\nand untested comparisons.\n  Results: In the acne vulgaris case study, the ECF-based model achieved 76%\naccuracy in predicting both tested and untested regimen outcomes, demonstrating\nstatistically comparable performance across clinical trial data and expert\ndermatologist consensus (p = 0.977).

This\nidea leads to our novel backdoor attack framework, Concept Confusion Attack\n(C^2 ATTACK), which leverages internal concepts in the model's reasoning as\n\"triggers\" without introducing explicit external modifications. By avoiding the\nuse of real triggers and directly activating or deactivating specific concepts\nin latent spaces, our approach enhances stealth, making detection by existing\ndefenses significantly harder. Using CLIP as a case study, experimental results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of C^2 ATTACK, achieving high attack success\nrates while maintaining robustness against advanced defenses.",

    "abstract": "Several backbone models pre-trained on general domain datasets can encode a\nsentence into a widely useful embedding. Such sentence embeddings can be\nfurther enhanced by domain adaptation that adapts a backbone model to a\nspecific domain. However, domain adaptation for low-resource languages like\nJapanese is often difficult due to the scarcity of large-scale labeled\ndatasets. To overcome this, this paper introduces SDJC (Self-supervised Domain\nadaptation for Japanese sentence embeddings with Contrastive learning) that\nutilizes a data generator to generate sentences, which have the same syntactic\nstructure to a sentence in an unlabeled specific domain corpus but convey\ndifferent semantic meanings. Generated sentences are then used to boost\ncontrastive learning that adapts a backbone model to accurately discriminate\nsentences in the specific domain. In addition, the components of SDJC like a\nbackbone model and a method to adapt it need to be carefully selected, but no\nbenchmark dataset is available for Japanese. Thus, a comprehensive Japanese STS\n(Semantic Textual Similarity) benchmark dataset is constructed by combining\ndatasets machine-translated from English with existing datasets. The\nexperimental results validates the effectiveness of SDJC on two domain-specific\ndownstream tasks as well as the usefulness of the constructed dataset.\nDatasets, codes and backbone models adapted by SDJC are available on our github\nrepository https://github.com/ccilab-doshisha/SDJC.",

    "abstract": "With the growing demand for dynamic real-time applications, online admission\ncontrol for time-critical event-triggered (ET) traffic in Time-Sensitive\nNetworking (TSN) has become a critical challenge. The main issue lies in\ndynamically allocating bandwidth with real-time guarantees in response to\ntraffic changes while also meeting the requirements for rapid response,\nscalability, and high resource utilization in online scenarios. To address this\nchallenge, we propose an online admission control method for ET traffic based\non the TSN/ATS+CBS (asynchronous traffic shaper and credit-based shaper)\narchitecture. This method provides a flexible framework for real-time\nguaranteed online admission control, supporting dynamic bandwidth allocation\nand reclamation at runtime without requiring global reconfiguration, thus\nimproving scalability. Within this framework, we further integrate a novel\nstrategy based on network calculus (NC) theory for efficient and\nhigh-utilization bandwidth reallocation. On the one hand, the strategy focuses\non adaptively balancing residual bandwidth with deadline awareness to prevent\nbottleneck egress ports, thereby improving admission capacity. On the other\nhand, it employs a non-trivial analytical result to reduce the search space,\naccelerating the solving process. Experimental results from both large-scale\nsynthetic and realistic test cases show that, compared to the state-of-the-art,\nour method achieves an average 56% increase in admitted flows and an average\n92% reduction in admission time. Additionally, it postpones the occurrence of\nbottleneck egress ports and the first rejection of admission requests, thereby\nenhancing adaptability.",

Low - order models have limitations in describing strong nonlinear\nand high - frequency dispersion effects. Thus, it is proposed to improve the\nmodeling accuracy of water wave dynamics on long - time scales through high -\norder correction models. By making small - parameter corrections to the\n$abcd-$system, then performing approximate estimations, the fifth - order BBM\nequation is finally derived.For local well - posedness, the equation is first\ntransformed into an equivalent integral equation form. With the help of\nmultilinear estimates and the contraction mapping principle, it is proved that\nwhen $s\\geq1$, for a given initial value $\\eta_{0}\\in H^{s}(\\mathbb{R})$, the\nequation has a local solution $\\eta \\in C([0, T];H^{s})$, and the solution\ndepends continuously on the initial value. Meanwhile, the maximum existence\ntime of the solution and its growth restriction are given.For global well -\nposedness, when $s\\geq2$, through energy estimates and local theory, combined\nwith conservation laws, it is proved that the initial - value problem of the\nequation is globally well - posed in $H^{s}(\\mathbb{R})$.

    "abstract": "Sequentially grasping multiple objects with multi-fingered hands is common in\ndaily life, where humans can fully leverage the dexterity of their hands to\nenclose multiple objects. However, the diversity of object geometries and the\ncomplex contact interactions required for high-DOF hands to grasp one object\nwhile enclosing another make sequential multi-object grasping challenging for\nrobots. In this paper, we propose SeqMultiGrasp, a system for sequentially\ngrasping objects with a four-fingered Allegro Hand. We focus on sequentially\ngrasping two objects, ensuring that the hand fully encloses one object before\nlifting it and then grasps the second object without dropping the first. Our\nsystem first synthesizes single-object grasp candidates, where each grasp is\nconstrained to use only a subset of the hand's links. These grasps are then\nvalidated in a physics simulator to ensure stability and feasibility. Next, we\nmerge the validated single-object grasp poses to construct multi-object grasp\nconfigurations. For real-world deployment, we train a diffusion model\nconditioned on point clouds to propose grasp poses, followed by a\nheuristic-based execution strategy. We test our system using $8 \\times 8$\nobject combinations in simulation and $6 \\times 3$ object combinations in real.\nOur diffusion-based grasp model obtains an average success rate of 65.8% over\n1,600 simulation trials and 56.7% over 90 real-world trials, suggesting that it\nis a promising approach for sequential multi-object grasping with\nmulti-fingered hands.

A grid-free\nalgorithm is further developed to effectively train the residual network,\nresulting in a feasible PAD obeying necessary normalization and boundary\nconditions.

    "abstract": "Flow matching has emerged as a powerful framework for generative modeling,\noffering computational advantages over diffusion models by leveraging\ndeterministic Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) instead of stochastic\ndynamics. While prior work established the worst case optimality of standard\nflow matching under Wasserstein distances, the theoretical guarantees for\nhigher-order flow matching - which incorporates acceleration terms to refine\nsample trajectories - remain unexplored. In this paper, we bridge this gap by\nproving that higher-order flow matching preserves worst case optimality as a\ndistribution estimator. We derive upper bounds on the estimation error for\nsecond-order flow matching, demonstrating that the convergence rates depend\npolynomially on the smoothness of the target distribution (quantified via Besov\nspaces) and key parameters of the ODE dynamics. Our analysis employs neural\nnetwork approximations with carefully controlled depth, width, and sparsity to\nbound acceleration errors across both small and large time intervals,\nultimately unifying these results into a general worst case optimal bound for\nall time steps.",

In this study, we\ninvestigated the underlying latent subspaces of safe and jailbroken states by\nextracting hidden activations from a LLM. Inspired by attractor dynamics in\nneuroscience, we hypothesized that LLM activations settle into semi stable\nstates that can be identified and perturbed to induce state transitions. Using\ndimensionality reduction techniques, we projected activations from safe and\njailbroken responses to reveal latent subspaces in lower dimensional spaces. We\nthen derived a perturbation vector that when applied to safe representations,\nshifted the model towards a jailbreak state. Our results demonstrate that this\ncausal intervention results in statistically significant jailbreak responses in\na subset of prompts. Next, we probed how these perturbations propagate through\nthe model's layers, testing whether the induced state change remains localized\nor cascades throughout the network.

While the global spatiotemporal distribution of the\nnet flux (the sum of all contributions) can be inferred from atmospheric CO$_2$\nconcentrations through flux inversion, attributing the net flux to its\nindividual components remains challenging. The advent of solar-induced\nfluorescence (SIF) satellite observations provides an opportunity to isolate\nnatural components by anchoring gross primary productivity (GPP), the\nphotosynthetic component of the net flux. Here, we introduce a novel\nstatistical flux-inversion framework that simultaneously assimilates\nobservations of SIF and CO$_2$ concentration, extending WOMBAT v2.0 (WOllongong\nMethodology for Bayesian Assimilation of Trace-gases, version 2.0) with a\nhierarchical model of spatiotemporal dependence between GPP and SIF processes.\nWe call the new framework WOMBAT v2.S, and we apply it to SIF and CO$_2$ data\nfrom NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) satellite and other\ninstruments to estimate natural fluxes over the globe during a recent six-year\nperiod. In a simulation experiment that matches OCO-2's retrieval\ncharacteristics, the inclusion of SIF improves accuracy and uncertainty\nquantification of component flux estimates. Comparing estimates from WOMBAT\nv2.S, v2.0, and the independent FLUXCOM initiative, we observe that linking GPP\nto SIF has little effect on net flux, as expected, but leads to spatial\nredistribution and more realistic seasonal structure in natural flux\ncomponents.",

This is enabled by the interplay of\ninteractions based on frictional contact and dynamic chemical bridging. These\ntwo interactions lead to novel rheology with several well-delineated shear\nthinning and thickening regimes, which enable stress-activated memories\nassociated with opposite time-dependent trends. As a result, in response to\ndifferent stress levels, the suspension can evolve by either softening or\nstiffening and is trainable, exhibiting targeted viscosity and energy\ndissipation with repeated low-velocity impact. Such behavior, usually\nassociated with mechanical metamaterials, suggests that dense suspensions with\nmultiple memories can be viewed as trainable rheological metafluids.",

Autoradiography studies with phosphor imaging were\nconducted on 113 mice-borne tumors from 10 cancer cell lines. An observable,\nreferred to as the effective diffusion length, Leff, was extracted from images\nof histological slices obtained using phosphor screens. The tumor and\nAlpha-DaRT source activities were measured after excision with a gamma counter\nto estimate the probability of Lead-212 clearance from the tumor by the blood,\nPleak(Pb). The measured values of Leff are in the range of 0.2-0.7 mm across\ndifferent tumor types and sizes. Pleak(Pb) is between 10% and 90% for all\nmeasured tumors, and it generally decreases in magnitude and spread for larger\ntumors. The measured values of Leff and Pleak(Pb) and associated dose\ncalculations indicate that hexagonal Alpha-DaRT source lattices of ~4 mm\nspacing with muCi-scale Radium-224 activities can lead to effective coverage of\nthe tumor volume with therapeutic dose levels, with considerable margin to\ncompensate for local variations in diffusion and leakage.",

    "abstract": "Evolution is the process of optimal adaptation of biological populations to\ntheir living environments. This is expressed via the concept of fitness,\ndefined as relative reproductive success. However, it has been pointed out that\nthis definition is incomplete and logically circular. To address this issue,\nseveral authors have called for new ways to specify fitness explicitly in terms\nof the relationship between phenotypes and their environment. Here, we show\nthat fitness, defined as the likelihood function that follows from mapping\npopulation dynamics to Bayesian learning, provides a general solution to this\nproblem. We show how probabilistic models of fitness can easily be constructed\nin this way, and how their averages acquire meaning as information. We also\nshow how this approach leads to powerful tools to analyze challenging problems\nof evolution in variable environments, game theory, and selection in\ngroup-structured populations. The approach is general and creates an explicit\nbridge between population dynamics under selection, statistical learning\ntheory, and emerging models of artificial intelligence.",

Existing backdoor attacks against GNNs use fixed-pattern\ntriggers and lack reasonable trigger constraints, overlooking individual graph\ncharacteristics and rendering insufficient evasiveness. To tackle the above\nissues, we propose ABARC, the first Adaptive Backdoor Attack with Reasonable\nConstraints, applying to both graph-level and node-level tasks in GNNs. For\ngraph-level tasks, we propose a subgraph backdoor attack independent of the\ngraph's topology. It dynamically selects trigger nodes for each target graph\nand modifies node features with constraints based on graph similarity, feature\nrange, and feature type. For node-level tasks, our attack begins with an\nanalysis of node features, followed by selecting and modifying trigger\nfeatures, which are then constrained by node similarity, feature range, and\nfeature type. Furthermore, an adaptive edge-pruning mechanism is designed to\nreduce the impact of neighbors on target nodes, ensuring a high attack success\nrate (ASR). Experimental results show that even with reasonable constraints for\nattack evasiveness, our attack achieves a high ASR while incurring a marginal\nclean accuracy drop (CAD).

For comparison, the\nbirth and death of path bins are also modeled using a Poisson distribution and\na Markov chain. Simulation results demonstrate that deep neural networks offer\nhighly accurate predictions for the lifespan (including death) of MPC path bins\nin the considered GA propagation scenario.",

    "abstract": "Gaussian splatting has emerged as a powerful tool for high-fidelity\nreconstruction of dynamic scenes. However, existing methods primarily rely on\nimplicit motion representations, such as encoding motions into neural networks\nor per-Gaussian parameters, which makes it difficult to further manipulate the\nreconstructed motions. This lack of explicit controllability limits existing\nmethods to replaying recorded motions only, which hinders a wider application\nin robotics. To address this, we propose Motion Blender Gaussian Splatting\n(MBGS), a novel framework that uses motion graphs as an explicit and sparse\nmotion representation. The motion of a graph's links is propagated to\nindividual Gaussians via dual quaternion skinning, with learnable weight\npainting functions that determine the influence of each link. The motion graphs\nand 3D Gaussians are jointly optimized from input videos via differentiable\nrendering. Experiments show that MBGS achieves state-of-the-art performance on\nthe highly challenging iPhone dataset while being competitive on HyperNeRF. We\ndemonstrate the application potential of our method in animating novel object\nposes, synthesizing real robot demonstrations, and predicting robot actions\nthrough visual planning.

The\nLED system of the far detector uses two Ultra-Violet (UV) LEDs, which are\neffective in calibrating all of PMTs at once.

The properties of all functioning\nPhoto-Multiplier-Tubes (PMTs) to detect the neutrino events in the far\ndetector, such as gain, its dependence of supplied High Voltage (HV), and\nPeak-to-Valley (PV) were calibrated. To achieve a good energy resolution for\nphysics events, up to 10% of the relative gain adjustment is required for all\nfunctioning PMTs. This will be achieved using the measured HV curves and the\nLED calibration. The Peak-to-Valley (PV) ratio values are the similar to those\nfrom the production company, which distinguish the single photo-electron signal\nfrom the pedestal.

    "abstract": "Knowledge distillation is a technique to imitate a performance that a deep\nlearning model has, but reduce the size on another model. It applies the\noutputs of a model to train another model having comparable accuracy. These two\ndistinct models are similar to the way information is delivered in human\nsociety, with one acting as the \"teacher\" and the other as the \"student\".\nSoftmax plays a role in comparing logits generated by models with each other by\nconverting probability distributions. It delivers the logits of a teacher to a\nstudent with compression through a parameter named temperature. Tuning this\nvariable reinforces the distillation performance. Although only this parameter\nhelps with the interaction of logits, it is not clear how temperatures promote\ninformation transfer. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to calculate\nthe temperature. Our method only refers to the maximum logit generated by a\nteacher model, which reduces computational time against state-of-the-art\nmethods. Our method shows a promising result in different student and teacher\nmodels on a standard benchmark dataset. Algorithms using temperature can obtain\nthe improvement by plugging in this dynamic approach. Furthermore, the\napproximation of the distillation process converges to a correlation of logits\nby both models. This reinforces the previous argument that the distillation\nconveys the relevance of logits. We report that this approximating algorithm\nyields a higher temperature compared to the commonly used static values in\ntesting.",

    "abstract": "Integration of Inverter-based Resources (IBRs) such as solar-powered plants\nwhich lack the intrinsic characteristics such as the inertial response of the\ntraditional synchronous-generator (SG) based sources presents a new challenge\nin the form of analyzing the grid stability under their presence. For example,\nsolar power is available for approximately from 9 AM-5 PM. However, the result\nof the rise in power consumption after 6 PM and the reverting back to the\nnon-renewable source of power generation during that period puts immense stress\non the grid, testing the ramp limitations of the SGs. Failure to meet the\nrequired power demand due to SG ramp limitations leads to failure of the power\ngrid and other catastrophes. Numerous mitigation techniques exist in order to\naddress the ramping issues with adding the energy storage elements (ESE) to the\ngrid being one. ESEs have higher ramping capabilities compared to the\ntraditional SGs. Also, the ESEs can store the energy and supply it to the grid\nwhen required making them extremely responsive to high ramp situations.\nHowever, the rate of degradation of the ESEs is faster than the SGs. This\nraises an important issue of addressing the degradation of the ESEs while\nmeeting the required power demand objectives and constraints. This work\nproposes a battery degradation-aware model predictive energy management\nstrategy and it is tested via a numerical simulation on multiple physical\nsystems such as Shipboard Power Systems (SPS). Moreover, the risk arising due\nto the fault in the IBR is also studied by means of a numerical simulation.\nOverall, the goal of this study is to make the existing power grid more robust,\nresilient, and risk-free from component degradation and eventual failures.",

To explore the best UAV AVL approach in such condition, we\nproposed this benchmark. Firstly, a large-scale Low-altitude Multi-view dataset\ncalled AnyVisLoc was constructed. This dataset includes 18,000 images captured\nat multiple scenes and altitudes, along with 2.5D reference maps containing\naerial photogrammetry maps and historical satellite maps. Secondly, a unified\nframework was proposed to integrate the state-of-the-art AVL approaches and\ncomprehensively test their performance.

This baseline achieved a 74.1% localization\naccuracy within 5m under Low-altitude, Multi-view conditions. In addition, a\nnovel retrieval metric called PDM@K was introduced to better align with the\ncharacteristics of the UAV AVL task.

However, the practical use of open-source\nLLMs is hindered by high resource requirements, making deployment expensive and\nlimiting widespread development. The collaborative inference is a promising\nsolution for this problem, in which users collaborate by each hosting a subset\nof layers and transmitting intermediate activation. Many companies are building\ncollaborative inference platforms to reduce LLM serving costs, leveraging\nusers' underutilized GPUs. Despite widespread interest in collaborative\ninference within academia and industry, the privacy risks associated with LLM\ncollaborative inference have not been well studied. This is largely because of\nthe challenge posed by inverting LLM activation due to its strong\nnon-linearity.\n  In this paper, to validate the severity of privacy threats in LLM\ncollaborative inference, we introduce the concept of prompt inversion attack\n(PIA), where a malicious participant intends to recover the input prompt\nthrough the activation transmitted by its previous participant. Extensive\nexperiments show that our PIA method substantially outperforms existing\nbaselines. For example, our method achieves an 88.4\\% token accuracy on the\nSkytrax dataset with the Llama-65B model when inverting the maximum number of\ntransformer layers, while the best baseline method only achieves 22.8\\%\naccuracy.

    "abstract": "Natural and lifelike locomotion remains a fundamental challenge for humanoid\nrobots to interact with human society. However, previous methods either neglect\nmotion naturalness or rely on unstable and ambiguous style rewards. In this\npaper, we propose a novel Generative Motion Prior (GMP) that provides\nfine-grained motion-level supervision for the task of natural humanoid robot\nlocomotion. To leverage natural human motions, we first employ whole-body\nmotion retargeting to effectively transfer them to the robot. Subsequently, we\ntrain a generative model offline to predict future natural reference motions\nfor the robot based on a conditional variational auto-encoder. During policy\ntraining, the generative motion prior serves as a frozen online motion\ngenerator, delivering precise and comprehensive supervision at the trajectory\nlevel, including joint angles and keypoint positions. The generative motion\nprior significantly enhances training stability and improves interpretability\nby offering detailed and dense guidance throughout the learning process.\nExperimental results in both simulation and real-world environments demonstrate\nthat our method achieves superior motion naturalness compared to existing\napproaches.

Recent methods are inspired by prompt\nlearning using pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP), leveraging\ndegradation-aware prompts to facilitate weather-free image restoration,\nyielding significant improvements. In this work, we propose CyclicPrompt, an\ninnovative cyclic prompt approach designed to enhance the effectiveness,\nadaptability, and generalizability of UAWR. CyclicPrompt Comprises two key\ncomponents: 1) a composite context prompt that integrates weather-related\ninformation and context-aware representations into the network to guide\nrestoration. This prompt differs from previous methods by marrying learnable\ninput-conditional vectors with weather-specific knowledge, thereby improving\nadaptability across various degradations. 2) The erase-and-paste mechanism,\nafter the initial guided restoration, substitutes weather-specific knowledge\nwith constrained restoration priors, inducing high-quality weather-free\nconcepts into the composite prompt to further fine-tune the restoration\nprocess. Therefore, we can form a cyclic \"Prompt-Restore-Prompt\" pipeline that\nadeptly harnesses weather-specific knowledge, textual contexts, and reliable\ntextures. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets validate\nthe superior performance of CyclicPrompt. The code is available at:\nhttps://github.com/RongxinL/CyclicPrompt.",

The\nliterature also considers finetuning an LLM on existing content and studies the\nbehavior of few-shot pretrained LLM (Llama, GPT3.5) vis-\\`a-vis few-shot\nfinetuned LLM (Llama2-7b) by evaluating their performance based on accuracy,\nfactual grounding, and toxicity. Our preliminary results exhibit more than 80%\nRouge-1 F1 for the generated content. This implied 87%- 88% of instances\naccepted as is or curated with minor edits by data stewards. By automatically\ngenerating descriptions for tables and columns in most accurate way, the\nresearch attempts to provide an overall framework for enterprises to\neffectively scale metadata curation and enrich its data catalog thereby vastly\nimproving the data catalog searchability and overall usability.",

    "abstract": "Static analysis is a powerful technique for bug detection in critical systems\nlike operating system kernels. However, designing and implementing static\nanalyzers is challenging, time-consuming, and typically limited to predefined\nbug patterns. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for static\nanalysis, directly applying them to scan large systems remains impractical due\nto computational constraints and contextual limitations.\n  We present KNighter, the first approach that unlocks scalable LLM-based\nstatic analysis by automatically synthesizing static analyzers from historical\nbug patterns. Rather than using LLMs to directly analyze massive systems, our\nkey insight is leveraging LLMs to generate specialized static analyzers guided\nby historical patch knowledge. KNighter implements this vision through a\nmulti-stage synthesis pipeline that validates checker correctness against\noriginal patches and employs an automated refinement process to iteratively\nreduce false positives. Our evaluation on the Linux kernel demonstrates that\nKNighter generates high-precision checkers capable of detecting diverse bug\npatterns overlooked by existing human-written analyzers. To date,\nKNighter-synthesized checkers have discovered 92 new, critical, long-latent\nbugs (average 4.3 years) in the Linux kernel; 77 are confirmed, 57 fixed, and\n30 have been assigned CVE numbers. This work establishes an entirely new\nparadigm for scalable, reliable, and traceable LLM-based static analysis for\nreal-world systems via checker synthesis.",

To address these challenges, we introduce DistJoin, a join\ncardinality estimator based on efficient distribution prediction using\nmulti-autoregressive models. Our contributions are threefold: (1) We propose a\nmethod to estimate join cardinality by leveraging the probability distributions\nof individual tables in a decoupled manner.

(3) We demonstrate\nthat an existing similar approach suffers from variance accumulation issues by\nformal variance analysis. To mitigate this problem, DistJoin employs a\nselectivity-based approach to infer join cardinality, effectively reducing\nvariance. In summary, DistJoin not only represents the first data-driven method\nto support both equi and non-equi joins simultaneously but also demonstrates\nsuperior accuracy while enabling fast and flexible updates. The experimental\nresults demonstrate that DistJoin achieves the highest accuracy, robustness to\ndata updates, generality, and comparable update and inference speed relative to\nexisting methods.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise as language\nunderstanding and decision making tools, and they have permeated various\naspects of our everyday life. However, their widespread availability also comes\nwith novel risks, such as generating harmful, unethical, or offensive content,\nvia an attack called jailbreaking. Despite extensive efforts from LLM\ndevelopers to align LLMs using human feedback, they are still susceptible to\njailbreak attacks. To tackle this issue, researchers often employ red-teaming\nto understand and investigate jailbreak prompts. However, existing red-teaming\napproaches lack effectiveness, scalability, or both. To address these issues,\nwe propose JBFuzz, a novel effective, automated, and scalable red-teaming\ntechnique for jailbreaking LLMs.\n  JBFuzz is inspired by the success of fuzzing for detecting\nbugs/vulnerabilities in software. We overcome three challenges related to\neffectiveness and scalability by devising novel seed prompts, a lightweight\nmutation engine, and a lightweight and accurate evaluator for guiding the\nfuzzer. Assimilating all three solutions results in a potent fuzzer that only\nrequires black-box access to the target LLM. We perform extensive experimental\nevaluation of JBFuzz using nine popular and widely-used LLMs. We find that\nJBFuzz successfully jailbreaks all LLMs for various harmful/unethical\nquestions, with an average attack success rate of 99%. We also find that JBFuzz\nis extremely efficient as it jailbreaks a given LLM for a given question in 60\nseconds on average. Our work highlights the susceptibility of the\nstate-of-the-art LLMs to jailbreak attacks even after safety alignment, and\nserves as a valuable red-teaming tool for LLM developers.",

    "abstract": "In many health policy settings, adaptive interventions target a population of\nclusters (e.g., schools), with the ultimate intent of impacting outcomes at the\nlevel of individuals within the clusters. Health policy researchers can use\nclustered, sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trials (SMARTs) to\nanswer important scientific questions concerning clustered adaptive\ninterventions. A common primary aim is to compare the mean of a nested,\nend-of-study outcome between two clustered adaptive interventions. However,\nexisting methods are not suitable when the primary outcome in a clustered SMART\nis nested and longitudinal (e.g., repeated outcome measures nested within\nmental healthcare providers, and mental healthcare providers nested within\nschools). This manuscript proposes a three-level marginal mean modeling and\nestimation approach for comparing adaptive interventions in a clustered SMART.\nThe proposed method enables policy analysts to answer a wider array of\nscientific questions in the marginal comparison of clustered adaptive\ninterventions. Further, relative to using an existing two-level method with a\nnested end-of-study outcome, the proposed method benefits from improved\nstatistical efficiency. With this approach, we examine longitudinal comparisons\nof adaptive interventions for improving school-based mental healthcare and\ncontrast its performance with existing approaches for studying static\nend-of-study outcomes. Methods were motivated by the Adaptive School-Based\nImplementation of CBT (ASIC) study, a clustered SMART designed to construct an\nadaptive health policy to improve the adoption of evidence-based CBT by mental\nhealthcare professionals in high schools across Michigan.",

In this work, we introduce LCoW, a framework for Learning language\nmodels to Contextualize complex Web pages into a more comprehensible form,\nthereby enhancing decision making by LLM agents. LCoW decouples web page\nunderstanding from decision making by training a separate contextualization\nmodule to transform complex web pages into comprehensible format, which are\nthen utilized by the decision-making agent. We demonstrate that our\ncontextualization module effectively integrates with LLM agents of various\nscales to significantly enhance their decision-making capabilities in web\nautomation tasks.

We uncover an interesting \"all-something-nothing\" phase\ntransition. Specifically, we show that as the average degree $\\lambda$\nsurpasses the critical threshold of $1/k$, the inference problem undergoes a\ntransition from almost exact recovery (\"all\" phase) to partial recovery\n(\"something\" phase). Moreover, as $\\lambda$ tends to infinity, the accuracy of\nrecovery diminishes to zero, leading to the onset of the \"nothing\" phase. This\nfinding complements the recent result by Mossel, Niles-Weed, Sohn, Sun, and\nZadik who established that for certain sufficiently dense graphs, the problem\nundergoes an \"all-or-nothing\" phase transition, jumping from near-perfect to\nnear-zero recovery. In addition, we characterize the recovery accuracy of a\nlinear-time iterative pruning algorithm and show that it achieves almost exact\nrecovery when $\\lambda < 1/k$. A key component of our analysis is a two-step\ncycle construction: we first build trees through local neighborhood exploration\nand then connect them by sprinkling using reserved edges.

    "abstract": "NLP research has increasingly focused on subjective tasks such as emotion\nanalysis. However, existing emotion benchmarks suffer from two major\nshortcomings: (1) they largely rely on keyword-based emotion recognition,\noverlooking crucial cultural dimensions required for deeper emotion\nunderstanding, and (2) many are created by translating English-annotated data\ninto other languages, leading to potentially unreliable evaluation. To address\nthese issues, we introduce Cultural Lenses on Emotion (CuLEmo), the first\nbenchmark designed to evaluate culture-aware emotion prediction across six\nlanguages: Amharic, Arabic, English, German, Hindi, and Spanish. CuLEmo\ncomprises 400 crafted questions per language, each requiring nuanced cultural\nreasoning and understanding. We use this benchmark to evaluate several\nstate-of-the-art LLMs on culture-aware emotion prediction and sentiment\nanalysis tasks. Our findings reveal that (1) emotion conceptualizations vary\nsignificantly across languages and cultures, (2) LLMs performance likewise\nvaries by language and cultural context, and (3) prompting in English with\nexplicit country context often outperforms in-language prompts for\nculture-aware emotion and sentiment understanding. The dataset and evaluation\ncode are publicly available.",

    "abstract": "Despite the impressive performance of current vision-based facial action unit\n(AU) detection approaches, they are heavily susceptible to the variations\nacross different domains and the cross-domain AU detection methods are\nunder-explored. In response to this challenge, we propose a decoupled doubly\ncontrastive adaptation (D$^2$CA) approach to learn a purified AU representation\nthat is semantically aligned for the source and target domains. Specifically,\nwe decompose latent representations into AU-relevant and AU-irrelevant\ncomponents, with the objective of exclusively facilitating adaptation within\nthe AU-relevant subspace. To achieve the feature decoupling, D$^2$CA is trained\nto disentangle AU and domain factors by assessing the quality of synthesized\nfaces in cross-domain scenarios when either AU or domain attributes are\nmodified. To further strengthen feature decoupling, particularly in scenarios\nwith limited AU data diversity, D$^2$CA employs a doubly contrastive learning\nmechanism comprising image and feature-level contrastive learning to ensure the\nquality of synthesized faces and mitigate feature ambiguities. This new\nframework leads to an automatically learned, dedicated separation of\nAU-relevant and domain-relevant factors, and it enables intuitive,\nscale-specific control of the cross-domain facial image synthesis. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate the efficacy of D$^2$CA in successfully decoupling AU\nand domain factors, yielding visually pleasing cross-domain synthesized facial\nimages. Meanwhile, D$^2$CA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art\ncross-domain AU detection approaches, achieving an average F1 score improvement\nof 6\\%-14\\% across various cross-domain scenarios.",

It diverges from the traditional FL framework in two ways: 1) it\nleverages discrete rankings instead of gradient updates, significantly reducing\ncommunication costs and limiting the potential space for malicious updates, and\n2) it uses majority voting on the server side to establish the global ranking,\nensuring that individual updates have minimal influence since each client\ncontributes only a single vote. These features enhance the system's scalability\nand position FRL as a promising paradigm for FL training.\n  However, our analysis reveals that FRL is not inherently robust, as certain\nedges are particularly vulnerable to poisoning attacks. Through a theoretical\ninvestigation, we prove the existence of these vulnerable edges and establish a\nlower bound and an upper bound for identifying them in each layer. Based on\nthis finding, we introduce a novel local model poisoning attack against FRL,\nnamely the Vulnerable Edge Manipulation (VEM) attack. The VEM attack focuses on\nidentifying and perturbing the most vulnerable edges in each layer and\nleveraging an optimization-based approach to maximize the attack's impact.\nThrough extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our\nattack achieves an overall 53.23% attack impact and is 3.7x more impactful than\nexisting methods.

While automatic AU detection systems leveraging deep\nlearning have progressed, they often overfit to specific datasets and\nindividual features, limiting their cross-domain applicability. To overcome\nthese limitations, we propose a doubly adaptive dropout approach for\ncross-domain AU detection, which enhances the robustness of convolutional\nfeature maps and spatial tokens against domain shifts. This approach includes a\nChannel Drop Unit (CD-Unit) and a Token Drop Unit (TD-Unit), which work\ntogether to reduce domain-specific noise at both the channel and token levels.\nThe CD-Unit preserves domain-agnostic local patterns in feature maps, while the\nTD-Unit helps the model identify AU relationships generalizable across domains.\nAn auxiliary domain classifier, integrated at each layer, guides the selective\nomission of domain-sensitive features. To prevent excessive feature dropout, a\nprogressive training strategy is used, allowing for selective exclusion of\nsensitive features at any model layer. Our method consistently outperforms\nexisting techniques in cross-domain AU detection, as demonstrated by extensive\nexperimental evaluations. Visualizations of attention maps also highlight clear\nand meaningful patterns related to both individual and combined AUs, further\nvalidating the approach's effectiveness.",

However, a notable drawback of DNN models\nlies in their susceptibility to adversarial attacks, wherein minor input\nperturbations can deceive them. A primary challenge revolves around the\ndevelopment of accurate, resilient, and compact DNN models suitable for\ndeployment on resource-constrained edge devices. This paper presents the\noutcomes of a compact DNN model that exhibits resilience against both black-box\nand white-box adversarial attacks. This work has achieved this resilience\nthrough training with the QKeras quantization-aware training framework. The\nstudy explores the potential of QKeras and an adversarial robustness technique,\nJacobian Regularization (JR), to co-optimize the DNN architecture through\nper-layer JR methodology. As a result, this paper has devised a DNN model\nemploying this co-optimization strategy based on Stochastic Ternary\nQuantization (STQ). Its performance was compared against existing DNN models in\nthe face of various white-box and black-box attacks. The experimental findings\nrevealed that, the proposed DNN model had small footprint and on average, it\nexhibited better performance than Quanos and DS-CNN MLCommons/TinyML (MLC/T)\nbenchmarks when challenged with white-box and black-box attacks, respectively,\non the CIFAR-10 image and Google Speech Commands audio datasets.",

Sustained limit cycle oscillations (OSC) emerge when driven\nby B-fields at room-temperature, forming robust Rydberg dissipative time\ncrystals (DTC). These driven-dissipative Rydberg DTC have recently been shown\nto develop an effective transition centered at the OSC frequency (-10dB\nbandwidth of ~1.7kHz, centered at 9.8kHz). Weak RF signals injected within this\nemergent transition perturb and emerge on the OSC spectrum, from which\nsensitive and high-resolution sensing of E-fields (~1.6-2.3 uVcm-1Hz-1/2) near\nthe OSC frequencies can be achieved. In this article, it is demonstrated that\nDC and AC Stark fields in the sub-kHz regime can be used effectively to shift\n(DC) or modulate (AC) the OSC frequency of Rydberg DTC at room-temperature. The\nAC-Stark driven modulation of the OSC is shown as an effective technique to\nsense weak AC E-fields in the sub-kHz regime. With a modest setup, a\nsensitivity of ~7.8 uVcm-1Hz-1/2 for AC signals at 300Hz (~8.7x improvement\nover state-of-art Rydberg atom techniques), and high-resolution detection to as\nlow as sub-Hz is demonstrated.

However, existing approaches inadequately\naddress the dual objectives of debloating: maintaining functionality by\npreserving essential features and enhancing security by reducing security\nissues. Specifically, current software debloating techniques often rely on\ninput-based analysis, using user inputs as proxies for the specifications of\ndesired features. However, these approaches frequently overfit provided inputs,\nleading to functionality loss and potential security vulnerabilities. To\naddress these limitations, we propose LEADER, a program debloating framework\nenhanced by Large Language Models (LLMs), which leverages their semantic\nunderstanding, generative capabilities, and decision-making strengths. LEADER\nmainly consists of two modules: (1) a documentation-guided test augmentation\nmodule designed to preserve functionality, which leverages LLMs to comprehend\nprogram documentation and generates sufficient tests to cover the desired\nfeatures comprehensively, and (2) a multi-advisor-aided program debloating\nmodule that employs a neuro-symbolic pipeline to ensure that the security of\nthe software can be perceived during debloating. This module combines\ndebloating and security advisors for analysis and employs an LLM as a\ndecision-maker to eliminate undesired code securely. Extensive evaluations on\nwidely used benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of LEADER. These results\ndemonstrate that LEADER surpasses the state-of-the-art tool CovA in\nfunctionality and security.

    "abstract": "Gait synchronization in pedestrians is influenced by biomechanical,\nenvironmental, and cognitive factors. Studying gait in ecological settings\nprovides insights often missed in controlled experiments. This study tackles\nthe challenges of assessing gait coordination in real-world interactions using\na dataset of uninstructed pedestrian trajectories recorded in an underground\npedestrian street network. The data are annotated for group relations,\ninteraction levels, and physical contact. The main goals of our study is to\ndevise a method to identify gait synchronisation from trajectory data and to\nprovide an in-depth analysis of social factors affecting gait synchronisation\nin pedestrian groups. To that end, we first propose a method to extract gait\nresiduals from pedestrian trajectories, which capture motion of the body caused\nby gait-induced oscillations. We thereafter apply a suite of analytical\ntechniques spanning both frequency and nonlinear domains. Frequency-based\nmethods, including the Gait Synchronisation Index and Cross Wavelet Coherence,\nquantify the alignment of oscillatory patterns in gait. Complementary nonlinear\nmeasures, such as Lyapunov exponents, determinism, and recurrence\nquantification metrics, offer deeper insights into the dynamical stability and\npredictability of coupled gaits. Results show that higher social interaction\nand closer distances enhance gait synchronization, reducing stride frequency\nvariation and increasing stability. Additionally, triad formation and relative\npositioning are shown to influence synchronisation. Overall, our findings\nsuggest that social interactions shape pedestrian gait coordination, with\ninteraction level and distance being key factors.",

The first tier functions as a\ndistributed software cache implemented using solid-state devices~(NVMes) and\nthe second tier consists of multiple hard disks~(HDDs). We describe an online\nlearning algorithm that manages data movement between the tiers. The software\nis hybrid, i.e. both distributed and multi-threaded. The end-to-end performance\nmodel of the two-tier system was developed using queuing networks and\nbehavioral models of storage devices. We identified significant parameters that\naffect the performance of storage devices and created behavioral models for\neach device. The performance of the software was evaluated on a many-core\ncluster using non-trivial read/write workloads. The paper provides examples to\nillustrate the use of these models.",

    "abstract": "Generative diffusion models offer a natural choice for data augmentation when\ntraining complex vision models. However, ensuring reliability of their\ngenerative content as augmentation samples remains an open challenge. Despite a\nnumber of techniques utilizing generative images to strengthen model training,\nit remains unclear how to utilize the combination of natural and generative\nimages as a rich supervisory signal for effective model induction. In this\nregard, we propose a text-to-image (T2I) data augmentation method, named\nDiffCoRe-Mix, that computes a set of generative counterparts for a training\nsample with an explicitly constrained diffusion model that leverages\nsample-based context and negative prompting for a reliable augmentation sample\ngeneration. To preserve key semantic axes, we also filter out undesired\ngenerative samples in our augmentation process. To that end, we propose a\nhard-cosine filtration in the embedding space of CLIP. Our approach\nsystematically mixes the natural and generative images at pixel and patch\nlevels. We extensively evaluate our technique on ImageNet-1K,Tiny ImageNet-200,\nCIFAR-100, Flowers102, CUB-Birds, Stanford Cars, and Caltech datasets,\ndemonstrating a notable increase in performance across the board, achieving up\nto $\\sim 3\\%$ absolute gain for top-1 accuracy over the state-of-the-art\nmethods, while showing comparable computational overhead.

    "abstract": "In the information retrieval (IR) domain, evaluation plays a crucial role in\noptimizing search experiences and supporting diverse user intents. In the\nrecent LLM era, research has been conducted to automate document relevance\nlabels, as these labels have traditionally been assigned by crowd-sourced\nworkers - a process that is both time and consuming and costly. This study\nfocuses on LLM-generated usefulness labels, a crucial evaluation metric that\nconsiders the user's search intents and task objectives, an aspect where\nrelevance falls short. Our experiment utilizes task-level, query-level, and\ndocument-level features along with user search behavior signals, which are\nessential in defining the usefulness of a document. Our research finds that (i)\npre-trained LLMs can generate moderate usefulness labels by understanding the\ncomprehensive search task session, (ii) pre-trained LLMs perform better\njudgement in short search sessions when provided with search session contexts.\nAdditionally, we investigated whether LLMs can capture the unique divergence\nbetween relevance and usefulness, along with conducting an ablation study to\nidentify the most critical metrics for accurate usefulness label generation. In\nconclusion, this work explores LLM-generated usefulness labels by evaluating\ncritical metrics and optimizing for practicality in real-world settings.",

    "abstract": "An edge-coloured path is rainbow if all of its edges have distinct colours.\nLet $G$ be a connected graph. The rainbow connection number of $G$, denoted by\n$rc(G)$, is the minimum number of colours in an edge-colouring of $G$ such\nthat, any two vertices are connected by a rainbow path. The strong rainbow\nconnection number of $G$, denoted by $src(G)$, is the minimum number of colours\nin an edge-colouring of $G$ such that, any two vertices are connected by a\nrainbow geodesic (i.e., a path of shortest length). These two notions of\nconnectivity of graphs were introduced by Chartrand, Johns, McKeon and Zhang in\n2008. In this paper, we introduce the list rainbow connection number\n$rc^\\ell(G)$, and the list strong rainbow connection number $src^\\ell(G)$.\nThese two parameters are the versions of $rc(G)$ and $src(G)$ that involve list\nedge-colourings. Among our results, we will determine the list rainbow\nconnection number and list strong rainbow connection number of some specific\ngraphs. We will also characterise all pairs of positive integers $a$ and $b$\nsuch that, there exists a connected graph $G$ with $src(G)=a$ and\n$src^\\ell(G)=b$, and similarly for the pair $rc^\\ell$ and $src^\\ell$. Finally,\nwe propose the question of whether or not we have $rc(G)=rc^\\ell(G)$, for all\nconnected graphs $G$.",
