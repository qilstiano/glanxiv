    "abstract": "Social identity theory (SIT) and social categorization theory (SCT) are two\nfacets of the social identity approach (SIA) to understanding social phenomena.\nSIT and SCT are models that describe and explain how people interact with one\nanother socially, connecting the individual to the group through an\nunderstanding of underlying psychological mechanisms and intergroup behaviour.\nSIT, originally developed in the 1970s, and SCT, a later, more general\noffshoot, have been broadly applied to a range of social phenomena among\npeople. The rise of increasingly social machines embedded in daily life has\nspurned efforts on understanding whether and how artificial agents can and do\nparticipate in SIA activities. As agents like social robots and chatbots\npowered by sophisticated large language models (LLMs) advance, understanding\nthe real and potential roles of these technologies as social entities is\ncrucial. Here, I provide a primer on SIA and extrapolate, through case studies\nand imagined examples, how SIT and SCT can apply to artificial social agents. I\nemphasize that not all human models and sub-theories will apply. I further\nargue that, given the emerging competence of these machines and our tendency to\nbe taken in by them, we experts may need to don the hat of the uncanny killjoy,\nfor our own good.",

    "abstract": "Whether and how to govern AI is no longer a question of technical regulation.\nIt is a question of constitutional authority. Across jurisdictions, algorithmic\nsystems now perform functions once reserved to public institutions: allocating\nwelfare, determining legal status, mediating access to housing, employment, and\nhealthcare. These are not merely administrative operations. They are acts of\nrule. Yet the dominant models of AI governance fail to confront this reality.\nThe European approach centers on rights-based oversight, presenting its\nregulatory framework as a principled defense of human dignity. The American\nmodel relies on decentralized experimentation, treating fragmentation as a\nproxy for democratic legitimacy. Both, in different ways, evade the structural\nquestion: who authorizes algorithmic power, through what institutions, and on\nwhat terms. This Article offers an alternative. Drawing from early modern\nReformed political thought, it reconstructs a constitutional framework grounded\nin covenantal authority and the right of lawful resistance. It argues that\nalgorithmic governance must rest on three principles. First, that all public\npower must be lawfully delegated through participatory authorization. Second,\nthat authority must be structured across representative communities with the\nstanding to consent, contest, or refuse. Third, that individuals retain a\nconstitutional right to resist systems that impose orthodoxy or erode the\ndomain of conscience. These principles are then operationalized through\ndoctrinal analysis of federalism, nondelegation, compelled speech, and\nstructural accountability. On this view, the legitimacy of algorithmic\ngovernance turns not on procedural safeguards or policy design, but on whether\nit reflects a constitutional order in which power is authorized by the\ngoverned, constrained by law, and answerable to those it affects.",

In\nthis work, we derive from first principles the three proposed clusters in this\nregion, refine the membership list and cluster ages, and, for the first time,\nexamine the 3D structure, motion, and origin of the clusters. Using clustering\nof Gaia data in 3D position + 2D velocity space, supplemented by available\nSDSS-V radial velocities, we find the clusters of ages 10, 15.8, and 20 Myr\nwith members numbering 140, 469, and 184, respectively. All three clusters\noverlap currently in 3D space. Tracing their previous location, based on\npresent-day motions, shows that each cluster originated in its own distinct\nregion and exhibited no influence on each other's formation. Two of the\nclusters trace their origin to different areas within the Cam OB1 association,\nwith the oldest cluster tracing its origins to the near edge of the Perseus\narm, in the direction of the Per OB1 or Cas 0B6 associations.

We identify an analogous issue, search-time\ncontamination (STC), in evaluating search-based LLM agents which use tools to\ngather information from online sources when answering user queries. STC occurs\nwhen the retrieval step surfaces a source containing the test question (or a\nnear-duplicate) alongside its answer, enabling agents to copy rather than\ngenuinely infer or reason, undermining benchmark integrity. We find that\nHuggingFace, an online platform hosting evaluation datasets, appears among\nretrieved sources in search based agent logs. Consequently, agents often\nexplicitly acknowledge discovering question answer pairs from HuggingFace\nwithin their reasoning chains. On three commonly used capability benchmarks:\nHumanity's Last Exam (HLE), SimpleQA, and GPQA, we demonstrate that for\napproximately 3% of questions, search-based agents directly find the datasets\nwith ground truth labels on HuggingFace. When millions of evaluation queries\ntarget the same benchmark, even small, repeated leaks can accelerate the\nbenchmark's obsolescence, shortening its intended lifecycle. After HuggingFace\nis blocked, we observe a drop in accuracy on the contaminated subset of\napproximately 15%. We further show through ablation experiments that publicly\naccessible evaluation datasets on HuggingFace may not be the sole source of\nSTC. To this end, we conclude by proposing best practices for benchmark design\nand result reporting to address this novel form of leakage and ensure\ntrustworthy evaluation of search-based LLM agents. To facilitate the auditing\nof evaluation results, we also publicly release the complete logs from our\nexperiments.",

Unlike prior motion transfer methods that rely\non explicit skeletal poses and heuristic cross-identity adjustments, our\napproach encodes multi-granular motion directly from a single image into a\ncompact set of four disentangled latent tokens -- one for facial expression,\none for body pose, and one for each hand. These motion latents are both highly\nexpressive and identity-agnostic, enabling high-fidelity, detailed\ncross-identity motion transfer across subjects with diverse identities, poses,\nand spatial configurations. To achieve this, we introduce a self-supervised,\nend-to-end framework that jointly learns the motion encoder and latent\nrepresentation alongside a DiT-based video generative model, trained on\nlarge-scale, diverse human motion datasets. Motion-identity disentanglement is\nenforced via 2D spatial and color augmentations, as well as synthetic 3D\nrenderings of cross-identity subject pairs under shared poses. Furthermore, we\nguide motion token learning with auxiliary decoders that promote fine-grained,\nsemantically aligned, and depth-aware motion embeddings. Extensive experiments\nshow that X-UniMotion outperforms state-of-the-art methods, producing highly\nexpressive animations with superior motion fidelity and identity preservation.",

Mobile\nhealth (mHealth) interventions, particularly Just-in-Time Adaptive\nInterventions (JITAIs), offer a promising avenue for scalable, personalized\nphysical activity (PA) promotion. However, developing and evaluating such\ninterventions at scale, while integrating robust behavioral science, presents\nmethodological hurdles. The PEARL study was the first large-scale, four-arm\nrandomized controlled trial to assess a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm,\ninformed by health behavior change theory, to personalize the content and\ntiming of PA nudges via a Fitbit app.\n  We enrolled and randomized 13,463 Fitbit users into four study arms: control,\nrandom, fixed, and RL. The control arm received no nudges. The other three arms\nreceived nudges from a bank of 155 nudges based on behavioral science\nprinciples. The random arm received nudges selected at random. The fixed arm\nreceived nudges based on a pre-set logic from survey responses about PA\nbarriers. The RL group received nudges selected by an adaptive RL algorithm. We\nincluded 7,711 participants in primary analyses (mean age 42.1, 86.3% female,\nbaseline steps 5,618.2).\n  We observed an increase in PA for the RL group compared to all other groups\nfrom baseline to 1 and 2 months. The RL group had significantly increased\naverage daily step count at 1 month compared to all other groups: control (+296\nsteps, p=0.0002), random (+218 steps, p=0.005), and fixed (+238 steps,\np=0.002). At 2 months, the RL group sustained a significant increase compared\nto the control group (+210 steps, p=0.0122). Generalized estimating equation\nmodels also revealed a sustained increase in daily steps in the RL group vs.\ncontrol (+208 steps, p=0.002).

In this setting, the Monge problem admits an explicit upper bound\ngiven by an optimization over the stabilizer subgroup of the reference\ndistribution. The reduced problem's dimension scales with that of the\nstabilizing subgroup and, in the tractable cases we study, is either zero or\nfinite. Under mild regularity conditions, a simple algebraic certificate,\nverified at an optimizer of the reduced problem, ensures tightness of the upper\nbound for both the Monge and Kantorovich formulations, with the optimal map\nrealized by a single group element.

Focusing on steady-state transport, we study the system's behavior\nunder combined unitary and nonunitary (dephasing and dissipative) effects using\nthe Lindblad quantum master equation. After validating our optimization scheme\non short chains, we extend the study to larger systems where we identify\nsystematic patterns in energy profiles. Our analysis reveals that different\ntypes of energy landscape enhance transport, depending on whether inter-site\ntunneling couplings in the chain are short- or long-range, the existence of\nenvironmental interactions, and the temperature of the environment. Our\nclassification and insights of optimal energy landscapes offer guidance for\ndesigning efficient transport systems for electronic, photovoltaic and quantum\ncommunication applications.",

Recent advances in machine learning (ML) methods offer automated\napproaches for spectral typing, which are becoming increasingly important as\nlarge spectroscopic surveys such as Gaia, SDSS, and SPHEREx generate datasets\ncontaining millions of spectra. We investigate the application of ML in\nspectral type classification on low-resolution (R $\\sim$ 120) near-infrared\nspectra of M0--T9 dwarfs obtained with the SpeX instrument on the NASA Infrared\nTelescope Facility. We specifically aim to classify the gravity- and\nmetallicity-dependent subclasses for late-type dwarfs. We used binned fluxes as\ninput features and compared the efficacy of spectral type estimators built\nusing Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbor\n(KNN) models. We tested the influence of different normalizations and analyzed\nthe relative importance of different spectral regions for surface gravity and\nmetallicity subclass classification.

We have a valuation function\n$v:2^U \\to \\mathbb{R}_+$, where $U$ is the set of all items, where $v(S)$\nspecifies the value obtained from set $S$ of items. The entirety of current\nwork on budget-feasible mechanisms has focused on the single-dimensional\nsetting, wherein each player holds a single item $e$ and incurs a private cost\n$c_e$ for supplying item $e$.\n  We introduce multidimensional budget feasible mechanism design: the universe\n$U$ is now partitioned into item-sets $\\{G_i\\}$ held by the different players,\nand each player $i$ incurs a private cost $c_i(S_i)$ for supplying the set\n$S_i\\subseteq G_i$ of items. A budget-feasible mechanism is a mechanism that is\ntruthful, and where the total payment made to the players is at most some given\nbudget $B$. The goal is to devise a budget-feasible mechanism that procures a\nset of items of large value. We obtain the first approximation guarantees for\nmultidimensional budget feasible mechanism design.\n  Our contributions are threefold. First, we prove an impossibility result\nshowing that the standard benchmark used in single-dimensional budget-feasible\nmechanism design, namely the algorithmic optimum is inadequate in that no\nbudget-feasible mechanism can achieve good approximation relative to this. We\nidentify that the chief underlying issue here is that there could be a\nmonopolist which prevents a budget-feasible mechanism from obtaining good\nguarantees.

    "abstract": "Log parsing is an essential task in log analysis, and many tools have been\ndesigned to accomplish it. Existing log parsers can be categorized into\nstatistic-based and semantic-based approaches. In comparison to semantic-based\nparsers, existing statistic-based parsers tend to be more efficient, require\nlower computational costs, and be more privacy-preserving thanks to on-premise\ndeployment, but often fall short in their accuracy (e.g., grouping or parsing\naccuracy) and generalizability. Therefore, it became a common belief that\nstatistic-based parsers cannot be as effective as semantic-based parsers since\nthe latter could take advantage of external knowledge supported by pretrained\nlanguage models. Our work, however, challenges this belief with a novel\nstatistic-based parser, PIPLUP. PIPLUP eliminates the pre-assumption of the\nposition of constant tokens for log grouping and relies on data-insensitive\nparameters to overcome the generalizability challenge, allowing \"plug and play\"\non given log files. According to our experiments on an open-sourced large log\ndataset, PIPLUP shows promising accuracy and generalizability with the\ndata-insensitive default parameter set. PIPLUP not only outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art statistic-based log parsers, Drain and its variants, but also\nobtains a competitive performance compared to the best unsupervised\nsemantic-based log parser (i.e., LUNAR). Further, PIPLUP exhibits low time\nconsumption without GPU acceleration and external API usage; our simple,\nefficient, and effective approach makes it more practical in real-world\nadoptions, especially when costs and privacy are of major concerns.",

We leveraged pattern type\ndifferences in task performance and in fixation-related potentials (FRPs) as\nrecorded by electroencephalography (EEG) during the task. Our findings indicate\nthat only the largest tested LLMs (~70 billion parameters) achieve\nhuman-comparable accuracy, with Qwen-2.5-72B and DeepSeek-R1-70B also showing\nsimilarities with the human pattern-specific difficulty profile. Critically,\nevery LLM tested forms representations that distinctly cluster the abstract\npattern categories within their intermediate layers, although the strength of\nthis clustering scales with their performance on the task. Moderate positive\ncorrelations were observed between the representational geometries of\ntask-optimal LLM layers and human frontal FRPs. These results consistently\ndiverged from comparisons with other EEG measures (response-locked ERPs and\nresting EEG), suggesting a potential shared representational space for abstract\npatterns.

This formulation provides\nmeaningful intermediate rewards, and is straightforward to implement once a\nreference is available. Both the reference trajectories and CLF shaping are\nused only during training, resulting in a lightweight policy at deployment. We\nvalidate our method both in simulation and through extensive real-world\nexperiments on a Unitree G1 robot.

    "abstract": "Parameterizing radiative transfer in means navigating trade-offs between\nphysical accuracy and conceptual clarity. However, currently available schemes\nsit at the extremes of this spectrum: correlated-k schemes are fast and\naccurate but rely on lookup tables which obscure the underlying physics and\nmake such schemes difficult to modify, while gray radiation schemes are\nconceptually straightforward but introduce significant biases in atmospheric\ncirculation. Here we introduce a Simple Spectral Model (SSM) for clear-sky\nlongwave radiative transfer which bridges this `clarity-accuracy' gap. The SSM\naccomplishes this by representing the spectral structure of H$_{2}$O and\nCO$_{2}$ absorption using analytic fits at reference conditions, then uses\nsimple functional forms to extend these fits to different atmospheric\nconditions. This, coupled to a simple, two-stream solver, yields a system of\nsix equations and ten physically-meaningful parameters which can solve for\nclear-sky longwave fluxes given atmospheric profiles of temperature and\nhumidity. When implemented in an idealized aquaplanet GCM, the SSM produces\nzonal-mean climate states which accurately mimic the results using a benchmark\ncorrelated-k code. The SSM also alleviates the significant zonal-mean climate\nbiases associated with using gray radiation, including an improved\nrepresentation of radiative cooling profiles, tropopause structure, jet\ndynamics, and Hadley Cell characteristics both in control climates and in\nresponse to uniform warming. This work demonstrates that even a simple spectral\nrepresentation of atmospheric absorption suffices to capture the essential\nphysics of longwave radiative transfer, and the SSM promises to be a valuable\ntool both for idealized climate modeling, and for teaching radiative transfer\nin the classroom.",

Traditional methods, such\nas Delphi studies, consensus conferences, and systematic guideline synthesis,\noffer structure but face limitations including high panel burden, interpretive\noversimplification, and suppression of conditional nuance. These challenges are\nnow exacerbated by information overload, fragmentation of the evidence base,\nand increasing reliance on publicly available sources that lack expert\nfiltering. This study introduces and evaluates a Human-AI Hybrid Delphi\n(HAH-Delphi) framework designed to augment expert consensus development by\nintegrating a generative AI model (Gemini 2.5 Pro), small panels of senior\nhuman experts, and structured facilitation. The HAH-Delphi was tested in three\nphases: retrospective replication, prospective comparison, and applied\ndeployment in two applied domains (endurance training and resistance and mixed\ncardio/strength training). The AI replicated 95% of published expert consensus\nconclusions in Phase I and showed 95% directional agreement with senior human\nexperts in Phase II, though it lacked experiential and pragmatic nuance. In\nPhase III, compact panels of six senior experts achieved >90% consensus\ncoverage and reached thematic saturation before the final participant. The AI\nprovided consistent, literature-grounded scaffolding that supported divergence\nresolution and accelerated saturation. The HAH-Delphi framework offers a\nflexible, scalable approach for generating high-quality, context-sensitive\nconsensus.

Traditional model-based verification techniques are limited\nin scalability and require access to low-dimensional state models, while\nmodel-free methods often lack reliability guarantees. This paper addresses\nthese limitations by introducing a framework for calibrated safety prediction\nin end-to-end vision-controlled systems, where neither the state-transition\nmodel nor the observation model is accessible. Building on the foundation of\nworld models, we leverage variational autoencoders and recurrent predictors to\nforecast future latent trajectories from raw image sequences and estimate the\nprobability of satisfying safety properties. We distinguish between monolithic\nand composite prediction pipelines and introduce a calibration mechanism to\nquantify prediction confidence. In long-horizon predictions from\nhigh-dimensional observations, the forecasted inputs to the safety evaluator\ncan deviate significantly from the training distribution due to compounding\nprediction errors and changing environmental conditions, leading to\nmiscalibrated risk estimates. To address this, we incorporate unsupervised\ndomain adaptation to ensure robustness of safety evaluation under distribution\nshift in predictions without requiring manual labels. Our formulation provides\ntheoretical calibration guarantees and supports practical evaluation across\nlong prediction horizons. Experimental results on three benchmarks show that\nour UDA-equipped evaluators maintain high accuracy and substantially lower\nfalse positive rates under distribution shift.

Through a\nstatistical analysis of O$^{6+}$, this work provides a comprehensive analysis\nof the velocity and temperature of O$^{6+}$ from 0.3 au to 1 au. The study\nfinds that the O$^{6+}$ relative drift, normalized to the local Alfv\\'en speed,\nand its temperature compared to protons, both decrease with distance from the\nSun and show some speed dependence. The O$^{6+}$ temperature is well fit by a\nsingle temperature adiabatic profile across all wind speeds, suggesting there\nis no significant heating at these heliocentric distances. This is in contrast\nto what is observed for protons and He$^{2+}$. Alfv\\'enic fluctuations, with\nfull 180$^{\\circ}$ field rotation, create momentary negative differential\nstreaming where the speed of O$^{6+}$ trails the protons.

Individuals can strategically adapt to the information gathered\nabout classifiers, which in turn may require algorithms to be re-trained. Which\ncollective dynamics will result from users' adaptation and algorithms'\nretraining? We apply evolutionary game theory to address this question. Our\nframework provides a mathematically rigorous way of treating the problem of\nfeedback loops between collectives of users and institutions, allowing to test\ninterventions to mitigate the adverse effects of strategic adaptation. As a\ncase study, we consider institutions deploying algorithms for credit lending.\nWe consider several scenarios, each representing different interaction\nparadigms. When algorithms are not robust against strategic manipulation, we\nare able to capture previous challenges discussed in the strategic\nclassification literature, whereby users either pay excessive costs to meet the\ninstitutions' expectations (leading to high social costs) or game the algorithm\n(e.g., provide fake information). From this baseline setting, we test the role\nof improving gaming detection and providing algorithmic recourse. We show that\nincreased detection capabilities reduce social costs and could lead to users'\nimprovement; when perfect classifiers are not feasible (likely to occur in\npractice), algorithmic recourse can steer the dynamics towards high users'\nimprovement rates. The speed at which the institutions re-adapt to the user's\npopulation plays a role in the final outcome. Finally, we explore a scenario\nwhere strict institutions provide actionable recourse to their unsuccessful\nusers and observe cycling dynamics so far unnoticed in the literature.",

Three experiments were conducted: i) analyzing\nconversational data from healthy vs. depressed subjects (DIAC-WOZ dataset) to\ncompare mapping patterns, ii) applying the method to the GoEmotions dataset and\niii) comparing human-written text with large language model (LLM) responses to\nassess differences in inferred brain activation. Emotional intensity was scored\nvia lexical analysis. Results showed neuroanatomically plausible mappings with\nhigh spatial specificity. Depressed subjects exhibited greater limbic\nengagement tied to negative affect. Discrete emotions were successfully\ndifferentiated. LLM-generated text matched humans in basic emotion distribution\nbut lacked nuanced activation in empathy and self-referential regions (medial\nprefrontal and posterior cingulate cortex).

However, these networks face a critical challenge in continuous\nlearning: catastrophic forgetting, where previously acquired knowledge is\noverwritten when new tasks are learned. This limitation contrasts with the\nhuman brain's ability to retain and integrate both old and new knowledge, aided\nby processes like memory consolidation during sleep through the replay of\nlearned information. To address this challenge in RNNs, here we propose a\nsleep-like replay consolidation (SRC) algorithm for EP-trained RNNs.

In class-incremental learning with SRC\nimplemented after each new task training, the EP-trained multilayer RNN model\n(MRNN-EP) performed significantly better compared to feedforward networks\nincorporating several well-established regularization techniques.

Whereas \\'etendue is conventionally used to characterise the\nthroughput of entire optical systems, the optogeometric factor is localised to\nthe level of a single detector pixel, providing a new way to link scene\nradiance to the radiant flux actually collected by that pixel.\n  Although examples are drawn from infrared thermography, the formulation is\ngeneral and applies equally to visible, ultraviolet, and Xray imaging systems.\n  The underlying radiometric principle is well established: classical\nradiometry already relates radiance, area, and solid angle. The new\ncontribution of this work is to isolate that pixel level term, to name it as\n$F_{\\mathrm{opg}}$, and to derive its explicit forms. In this way,\n$F_{\\mathrm{opg}}$ acts as a compact and universal descriptor of pixel level\nradiometric throughput.\n  The present study builds on an earlier quantitative thermography equation\nthat already expressed the radiant flux collected by an individual pixel. In\nthat formulation, the scene based form of the optogeometric factor was present\nonly implicitly, embedded in the derivation. Here, $F_{\\mathrm{opg}}$ is made\nexplicit as an independent radiometric quantity, providing a more transparent\nand general framework that links pixel level geometry to radiometric\nthroughput.\n  Two formulations of $F_{\\mathrm{opg}}$ are derived: a scene based form,\nexpressed through the pixel footprint area and instantaneous field of view, and\na sensor based form, expressed through the pixel pitch and optical $f$number.\nThey coincide numerically under the paraxial approximation and other conditions\ndiscussed in this work.",

Using two cold EoSs,\ncombined with four parametrizations of the finite-temperature part of the EoS,\nwe find that the threshold mass is insensitive to realistic variations of the\nthermal prescription, at sub-percent accuracy. We report on the thermal\nproperties and ejecta of mergers with masses just above the threshold mass,\ni.e., which experience a single core-bounce before collapsing.

This study aims to model the expected luminosities of the first\nfour Balmer series transitions from Pop. III star-forming halos and assess\ntheir detectability with JWST/NIRSpec across $5 \\leq z \\leq 11$. We use the\nsemi-analytical code A-SLOTH with merger trees constructed from the extended\nPress-Schechter (EPS) formalism and cosmological N-body simulations targeting\nMilky Way-like halos and the halo population in a 8~Mpc$/h$ box. Predicted\nfluxes are compared to JWST detection limits derived from the Exposure Time\nCalculator (ETC) assuming a 10,000 s NIRSpec exposure at a signal-to-noise\nratio of 5. For our default model parameters, Pop.

The\nfluxes in the other Balmer series lines are weaker than H$\\alpha$ and hence are\nalso not detectable. Among the model parameters that we explore, the ionizing\nphoton escape fraction $f_{\\mathrm{esc,III}}$ has the strongest effect on Pop.\nIII Balmer series fluxes when changed: reducing $f_\\mathrm{esc,III}$ from 0.9\nto 0.1 increases the fluxes by $\\gtrsim$1 order of magnitude. However, even in\nthis case, the lines remain undetectable.\n  Balmer series lines powered by emission from Pop. III stars will be\nundetectable by JWST without strong lensing ($\\mu \\gtrsim 10$).

In MS$^2$ analysis, peptide fragment ion probability\nprediction plays a critical role, enhancing the accuracy of peptide\nidentification from mass spectra as a complement to the intensity information.\nCurrent approaches rely on global statistics of fragmentation, which assumes\nthat a fragment's probability is uniform across all peptides.

To address this gap, we present Pep2Prob, the\nfirst comprehensive dataset and benchmark designed for peptide-specific\nfragment ion probability prediction. The proposed dataset contains fragment ion\nprobability statistics for 608,780 unique precursors (each precursor is a pair\nof peptide sequence and charge state), summarized from more than 183 million\nhigh-quality, high-resolution, HCD MS$^2$ spectra with validated peptide\nassignments and fragmentation annotations.

    "abstract": "Synaptic pruning in biological brains removes weak connections to improve\nefficiency. In contrast, dropout regularization in artificial neural networks\nrandomly deactivates neurons without considering activity-dependent pruning. We\npropose a magnitude-based synaptic pruning method that better reflects biology\nby progressively removing low-importance connections during training.\nIntegrated directly into the training loop as a dropout replacement, our\napproach computes weight importance from absolute magnitudes across layers and\napplies a cubic schedule to gradually increase global sparsity. At fixed\nintervals, pruning masks permanently remove low-importance weights while\nmaintaining gradient flow for active ones, eliminating the need for separate\npruning and fine-tuning phases. Experiments on multiple time series forecasting\nmodels including RNN, LSTM, and Patch Time Series Transformer across four\ndatasets show consistent gains. Our method ranked best overall, with\nstatistically significant improvements confirmed by Friedman tests (p < 0.01).\nIn financial forecasting, it reduced Mean Absolute Error by up to 20% over\nmodels with no or standard dropout, and up to 52% in select transformer models.\nThis dynamic pruning mechanism advances regularization by coupling weight\nelimination with progressive sparsification, offering easy integration into\ndiverse architectures. Its strong performance, especially in financial time\nseries forecasting, highlights its potential as a practical alternative to\nconventional dropout techniques.",

Violations of this assumption\ncan impair the estimation and hypothesis testing of the mediation effect in\nconventional approaches. This study addresses the non-normality issue by\nexplicitly modelling skewed and heavy-tailed error terms within the Bayesian\nmediation framework. Building on the work of Fern\\'andez and Steel (1998), this\nstudy introduces a novel family of distributions, termed the Centred Two-Piece\nStudent $t$ Distribution (CTPT). The new distribution incorporates a skewness\nparameter into the Student t distribution and centres it to have a mean of\nzero, enabling flexible modelling of error terms in Bayesian regression and\nmediation analysis. A class of standard improper priors is employed, and\nconditions for the existence of the posterior distribution and posterior\nmoments are established, while enabling inference on both skewness and tail\nparameters. Simulation studies are conducted to examine parameter recovery\naccuracy and statistical power in testing mediation effects. Compared to\ntraditional Bayesian and frequentist methods, particularly bootstrap-based\napproaches, our method gives greater statistical power when correctly\nspecified, while maintaining robustness against model misspecification.

Existing vision-only methods for 3D\nsemantic occupancy prediction commonly rely on dense 3D voxels, which incur\nhigh communication costs, or 2D planar features, which require accurate depth\nestimation or additional supervision, limiting their applicability to\ncollaborative scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose the first\napproach leveraging sparse 3D semantic Gaussian splatting for collaborative 3D\nsemantic occupancy prediction. By sharing and fusing intermediate Gaussian\nprimitives, our method provides three benefits: a neighborhood-based\ncross-agent fusion that removes duplicates and suppresses noisy or inconsistent\nGaussians; a joint encoding of geometry and semantics in each primitive, which\nreduces reliance on depth supervision and allows simple rigid alignment; and\nsparse, object-centric messages that preserve structural information while\nreducing communication volume. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our\napproach outperforms single-agent perception and baseline collaborative methods\nby +8.42 and +3.28 points in mIoU, and +5.11 and +22.41 points in IoU,\nrespectively.

We present multiple parametric cut patterns to show that\nrigidity can be increased both under symmetric and asymmetric loads.

To address this gap, we propose a new benchmark, KnowDR-REC,\ncharacterized by three key features: Firstly, it is built upon real-world\nknowledge, requiring fine-grained multimodal reasoning across text and image.\nSecondly, the dataset includes elaborately constructed negative samples via\nfine-grained expression editing, designed to evaluate a model's robustness and\nanti-hallucination ability.

We evaluate\n16 state-of-the-art multimodal models on KnowDR-REC, with experimental results\nshowing that existing MLLMs still struggle with knowledge-driven visual\ngrounding tasks. Furthermore, we observe a decoupling between textual\nunderstanding and visual grounding in MLLMs, where many models are\nsignificantly influenced by memorized shortcut correlations, which severely\naffect their behavior on our benchmark and hinder genuine multimodal reasoning.\nWe anticipate that the proposed benchmark will inspire future research towards\ndeveloping more robust, interpretable, and knowledge-intensive visual grounding\nframeworks, driving the development of more reliable and robust multimodal\nsystems for complex real-world scenarios.",

This survey provides an overview of\nexisting studies that use aspects of decision-making in path planning,\npresenting the research strands for Exploration Path Planning and Informative\nPath Planning, and focusing on characteristics of how data have been modeled\nand understood.

    "abstract": "Reasoning-augmented search agents such as Search-R1, trained via\nreinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), demonstrate remarkable\ncapabilities in multi-step information retrieval from external knowledge\nsources. These agents address the limitations of their parametric memory by\ndynamically gathering relevant facts to address complex reasoning tasks.\nHowever, existing approaches suffer from a fundamental architectural\nlimitation: they process search queries strictly sequentially, even when\nhandling inherently parallelizable and logically independent comparisons. This\nsequential bottleneck significantly constrains computational efficiency,\nparticularly for queries that require multiple entity comparisons. To address\nthis critical limitation, we propose ParallelSearch, a novel reinforcement\nlearning framework that empowers large language models (LLMs) to recognize\nparallelizable query structures and execute multiple search operations\nconcurrently. Our approach introduces dedicated reward functions that\nincentivize the identification of independent query components while preserving\nanswer accuracy through jointly considering correctness, query decomposition\nquality, and parallel execution benefits. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate\nthat ParallelSearch outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by an average\nperformance gain of 2.9% across seven question-answering benchmarks. Notably,\non parallelizable questions, our method achieves a 12.7% performance\nimprovement while requiring only 69.6% of the LLM calls compared to sequential\napproaches.",

Recent investigations have shown that the locking of\nphase shifts is central to resonant-exchange scattering at low energies.\nMoreover, phase-shift locking causes an unexpected behavior, namely the\nresonant-exchange cross section over a broad range of energies is largely\ndictated by $s$-wave scattering, whose influence extends high above the\n$s$-wave Wigner regime. Here, we generalize our previous treatment to higher\nenergies and derive an analytical expression for the resonant-exchange cross\nsection which depends on a few parameters and accounts not only for the locking\nof phase shifts, but also for their gradual unlocking with increased energy. We\nfind good agreement between the computed (fully quantal) cross sections and\nthose obtained with our expression, which we illustrate in great detail for the\ncase of resonant charge-transfer in ion-atom collisions.",

Amongst them, the contact-interaction model, while\nnon-renormalizable, implements confinement, satisfies Lorentz covariance and\ncorrectly describes chiral symmetry and its dynamical breaking pattern.\nOriginal studies focused on the light hadron sector in the isospin limit and\nwere thereafter extended to heavy mesons and baryons.

Utilizing historical data from the Volve\n(wells PF14, PF12) and Norne (well E1H) oil fields, this study investigates the\nefficacy of various predictive algorithms-namely Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM),\nBidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and eXtreme Gradient\nBoosting (XGBoost) - in forecasting historical oil production rates (OPR_H).\nAll the models achieved \"out-of-sample\" production forecasts for an upcoming\nfuture timeframe.

The PI-based feature selection effectively reduced input\ndimensionality compared to conventional numerical simulation workflows.

    "abstract": "The ability to rapidly adapt to novel and unforeseen environmental changes is\na cornerstone of artificial general intelligence (AGI), yet it remains a\ncritical blind spot in most existing AI benchmarks. Traditional evaluation\nlargely focuses on optimizing performance within fixed environments, failing to\nassess systems' flexibility and generalization capabilities when faced with\neven subtle rule or structural modifications. Addressing this gap, I introduce\nthe Othello AI Arena, a novel benchmark framework designed to evaluate\nintelligent systems based on their capacity for limited-time adaptation to\nunseen environments. Our platform poses a meta-learning challenge: participants\nmust develop systems that can analyze the specific configuration and rules of a\nnovel Othello board within a strict time limit (60 seconds) and generate a\ntailored, high-performing strategy for that unique environment. With this,\nevaluation of the meta-level intelligence can be separated from the task-level\nstrategy performance. The Arena features a diverse set of game stages,\nincluding public stages for development and private stages with structural and\nrule variations designed to test genuine adaptive and generalization\ncapabilities. Implemented as an accessible web-based platform, the Arena\nprovides real-time visualization, automated evaluation using multi-dimensional\nmetrics, and comprehensive logging for post-hoc analysis. Initial observations\nfrom pilot tests and preliminary student engagements highlight fascinating\npatterns in adaptation approaches, ranging from rapid parameter tuning to\nrudimentary environmental model learning through simulation. The Othello AI\nArena offers a unique educational tool and a valuable research benchmark for\nfostering and evaluating the crucial skill of rapid, intelligent adaptation in\nAI systems.",

    "abstract": "Recommender systems play a critical role in enhancing user experience by\nproviding personalized suggestions based on user preferences. Traditional\napproaches often rely on explicit numerical ratings or assume access to fully\nranked lists of items. However, ratings frequently fail to capture true\npreferences due to users' behavioral biases and subjective interpretations of\nrating scales, while eliciting full rankings is demanding and impractical. To\novercome these limitations, we propose a generalized utility-based framework\nthat learns preferences from simple and intuitive pairwise comparisons. Our\napproach is model-agnostic and designed to optimize for arbitrary,\ntask-specific utility functions, allowing the system's objective to be\nexplicitly aligned with the definition of a high-quality outcome in any given\napplication. A central contribution of our work is a novel utility-based active\nsampling strategy for preference elicitation. This method selects queries that\nare expected to provide the greatest improvement to the utility of the final\nrecommended outcome. We ground our preference model in the probabilistic\nPlackett-Luce framework for pairwise data. To demonstrate the versatility of\nour approach, we present two distinct experiments: first, an implementation\nusing matrix factorization for a classic movie recommendation task, and second,\nan implementation using a neural network for a complex candidate selection\nscenario in university admissions. Experimental results demonstrate that our\nframework provides a more accurate, data-efficient, and user-centric paradigm\nfor personalized ranking.",

While vision-language\nmodels (VLMs) recently have dramatically improved the semantic accuracy of\npseudo-labels, their geometric quality, particularly bounding box precision,\nremains commonly neglected. To address this issue, we propose a High Box\nQuality Open-Vocabulary 3D Detection (HQ-OV3D) framework, dedicated to generate\nand refine high-quality pseudo-labels for open-vocabulary classes. The\nframework comprises two key components: an Intra-Modality Cross-Validated\n(IMCV) Proposal Generator that utilizes cross-modality geometric consistency to\ngenerate high-quality initial 3D proposals, and an Annotated-Class Assisted\n(ACA) Denoiser that progressively refines 3D proposals by leveraging geometric\npriors from annotated categories through a DDIM-based denoising mechanism.\nCompared to the state-of-the-art method, training with pseudo-labels generated\nby our approach achieves a 7.37% improvement in mAP on novel classes,\ndemonstrating the superior quality of the pseudo-labels produced by our\nframework.

However, this condition excludes many practical\nsettings characterized by strong censorship, where p is less than or equal to\none-half. To address this bothering limitation, we propose a modification that\nincorporates a tuning parameter. This parameter, greater than one, assigns\nappropriate weights to the estimators, thereby extending the applicability of\nthe method to the entire censoring range, where p is between zero and one.\nUnder suitable regularity conditions, we establish the consistency and\nasymptotic normality of the proposed estimators. Extensive simulation studies\nreveal a clear improvement over existing methods in terms of bias and mean\nsquared error, particularly in the strong censoring situation. These results\nhighlight the significant practical and theoretical impact of our approach,\noffering a more flexible and accurate framework for tail index estimation under\ncensoring.

Methods: 3D transesophageal echocardiographic images of two\npatients with regurgitant LAVVs were identified from an institutional database.\nCustom code in SlicerHeart was used to segment leaflets, define the annulus,\nand generate patient-specific valve molds. Silicone valve models were\nfabricated and tested in a pulse duplicator under simulated physiological\nconditions. Five unrepaired valves were analyzed for manufacturing consistency,\nand multiple surgical repair techniques were compared for two patient-specific\nmodels. Results: Manufacturing variability was low in annular metrics (CV for\nannular circumference: 2.1; commissural distance: 4.1; annulus height: 14.7)\nbut higher in leaflet closure metrics (billow height: 11.1%; billow volume:\n18.9%; tenting height: 45.9%; tenting volume: 73.5%). In Patient 1, cleft\nclosure and an Alfieri stitch both eliminated the regurgitant orifice area, but\nthe Alfieri stitch resulted in elevated mean pressure gradient (17 mmHg vs. 4-9\nmmHg for other repairs) and deteriorated with repeated loading. In Patient 2,\nno repair eliminated regurgitation entirely; however, combining an 11 mm patch\naugmentation with commissuroplasty reduced regurgitant area to 0.147 cm2, the\nsmallest observed among tested strategies. Conclusion: This study demonstrates\nthe feasibility of a dynamic physical simulation platform for preclinical LAVV\nrepair evaluation.

    "abstract": "Effective personalized learning in computer science education depends on\naccurately modeling what students know and what they need to learn. While\nKnowledge Components (KCs) provide a foundation for such modeling, automated KC\nextraction from student code is inherently challenging due to insufficient\nexplainability of discovered KCs and the open-endedness of programming problems\nwith significant structural variability across student solutions and complex\ninteractions among programming concepts. In this work, we propose a novel,\nexplainable framework for automated KC discovery through pattern-based KCs:\nrecurring structural patterns within student code that capture the specific\nprogramming patterns and language constructs that students must master. Toward\nthis, we train a Variational Autoencoder to generate important representative\npatterns from student code guided by an explainable, attention-based code\nrepresentation model that identifies important correct and incorrect pattern\nimplementations from student code. These patterns are then clustered to form\npattern-based KCs. We evaluate our KCs using two well-established methods\ninformed by Cognitive Science: learning curve analysis and Deep Knowledge\nTracing (DKT). Experimental results demonstrate meaningful learning\ntrajectories and significant improvements in DKT predictive performance over\ntraditional KT methods. This work advances knowledge modeling in CS education\nby providing an automated, scalable, and explainable framework for identifying\ngranular code patterns and algorithmic constructs, essential for student\nlearning.",

    "abstract": "Traffic is a significant source of global carbon emissions. In this paper, we\nstudy how carbon pricing can be used to guide traffic towards equilibria that\nrespect given emission budgets. In particular, we consider a general\nmulti-commodity flow model with flow-dependent externalities. These\nexternalities may represent carbon emissions, entering a priced area, or the\ntraversal of paths regulated by tradable credit schemes.\n  We provide a complete characterization of all flows that can be attained as\nWardrop equilibria when assigning a single price to each externality. More\nprecisely, we show that every externality budget achievable by any feasible\nflow in the network can also be achieved as a Wardrop equilibrium by setting\nappropriate prices. For extremal and Pareto-minimal budgets, we show that there\nare prices such that all equilibria respect the budgets. Although the proofs of\nexistence of these particular prices rely on fixed-point arguments and are\nnon-constructive, we show that in the case where the equilibrium minimizes a\nconvex potential, the prices can be obtained as Lagrange multipliers of a\nsuitable convex program. In the case of a single externality, we prove that the\ntotal externality caused by the traffic flow is decreasing in the price. For\nincreasing, continuous, and piecewise affine travel time functions with a\nsingle externality, we give an output-polynomial algorithm that computes all\nequilibria implementable by pricing the externality. Even though there are\nnetworks where the output size is exponential in the input size, we show that\nthe minimal price obeying a given budget can be computed in polynomial time.\nThis allows the efficient computation of the market price of tradable credit\nschemes. Overall, our results show that carbon pricing is a viable and (under\nmild assumptions) tractable approach to achieve all feasible emission goals in\ntraffic networks.",

In this\nwork, we address these challenges and introduce DQInit, a method that adapts\nvalue function initialization to DRL. DQInit reuses compact tabular Q-values\nextracted from previously solved tasks as a transferable knowledge base. It\nemploys a knownness-based mechanism to softly integrate these transferred\nvalues into underexplored regions and gradually shift toward the agent's\nlearned estimates, avoiding the limitations of fixed time decay. Our approach\noffers a novel perspective on knowledge transfer in DRL by relying solely on\nvalue estimates rather than policies or demonstrations, effectively combining\nthe strengths of jumpstart RL and policy distillation while mitigating their\ndrawbacks.

In loop quenches, SPT phases can survive even out of equilibrium, thus\nevading the dynamical violation of their protecting symmetry. Moreover, we\ndemonstrate that employing loop quenches allows to detect the equilibrium\ntopology via measurable dynamical quantities. Focusing on chiral-SPT phases, we\nintroduce the Loschmidt chirality amplitude as a key observable that encodes\nthe equilibrium topological invariant. We exemplify our method for\nchiral-symmetric one-dimensional two-band insulators and propose a pump-probe\nmeasurement scheme which allows to extract the amplitude in question.

    "abstract": "Conventional methods for modeling thermocatalytic systems are typically based\non the Kohn-Sham density functional theory (KS-DFT), neglecting the\ninhomogeneous distributions of gas molecules in the reactive environment.\nHowever, industrial reactions often take place at high temperature and\npressure, where the local densities of gas molecules near the catalyst surface\ncan reach hundreds of times their bulk values. To assess the environmental\nimpacts on surface composition and reaction kinetics, we integrate KS-DFT\ncalculations for predicting surface bonding energy with classical DFT to\nevaluate gas distribution and the grand potential of the entire reactive\nsystem. This multiscale approach accounts for both bond formation and\nnon-bonded interactions of gas molecules with the catalyst surface and reveals\nthat the surface composition is determined not only by chemisorption but also\nby the accessibility of surface sites and their interactions with the\nsurrounding molecules in the gas phase. This theoretical procedure was employed\nto establish the relationship between surface coverage, gas-phase composition,\nand bulk phase thermodynamic conditions with thermocatalytic hydrogenation of\nCO2 as a benchmark. The computational framework opens new avenues for studying\nadsorption and coverage on catalytic surfaces under industrially relevant\nconditions.",

In particular, the earlier emergence\nof stronger magnetic fields in more massive WDs, compared to older, less\nmassive, and less magnetic ones, can be explained by this framework. This is\nbecause the magnetic boundary at the onset of WD cooling lies deeper in less\nmassive WDs, resulting in a slower and weaker evolution of the surface magnetic\nfield due to increasing electrical conductivity over time. We further show that\nmany of the magnetic field strengths observed across different WD samples can\nbe reproduced if the deep-seated field generated during the main sequence is\ncomparable to predictions from magnetohydrodynamic simulations of\ncore-convective dynamos, or if equipartition provides a valid scaling for the\nmain-sequence dynamo.

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have exhibited state-of-the-art performance\nacross wide-range of domains such as recommender systems, material design, and\ndrug repurposing. Yet message-passing GNNs suffer from over-squashing --\nexponential compression of long-range information from distant nodes -- which\nlimits expressivity. Rewiring techniques can ease this bottleneck; but their\npractical impacts are unclear due to the lack of a direct empirical\nover-squashing metric. We propose a rigorous, topology-focused method for\nassessing over-squashing between node pairs using the decay rate of their\nmutual sensitivity. We then extend these pairwise assessments to four\ngraph-level statistics (prevalence, intensity, variability, extremity).\nCoupling these metrics with a within-graph causal design, we quantify how\nrewiring strategies affect over-squashing on diverse graph- and\nnode-classification benchmarks. Our extensive empirical analyses show that most\ngraph classification datasets suffer from over-squashing (but to various\nextents), and rewiring effectively mitigates it -- though the degree of\nmitigation, and its translation into performance gains, varies by dataset and\nmethod. We also found that over-squashing is less notable in node\nclassification datasets, where rewiring often increases over-squashing, and\nperformance variations are uncorrelated with over-squashing changes. These\nfindings suggest that rewiring is most beneficial when over-squashing is both\nsubstantial and corrected with restraint -- while overly aggressive rewiring,\nor rewiring applied to minimally over-squashed graphs, is unlikely to help and\nmay even harm performance. Our plug-and-play diagnostic tool lets practitioners\ndecide -- before any training -- whether rewiring is likely to pay off.",

    "abstract": "Luminous Red Novae (LRNe) are transients associated with mass ejection during\nstellar mergers and common envelope evolution (CEE). LRNe have the potential to\nilluminate the poorly understood phases of binary evolution leading up to the\nCEE, during the mass ejection phase, and in the immediate aftermath. However,\nthe mechanism responsible for powering LRN light curves and the origin of their\nobserved diversity remain open questions. Here, we perform two-dimensional\nmoving-mesh radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of LRNe that take into account\nhydrogen recombination and relevant opacities. We study a typical high-mass\nstellar merger, which dynamically ejects 2 $M_\\odot$ with a characteristic\nvelocity of 410 km/s. This ejecta collides with 2.7 $M_\\odot$ of equatorially\nconcentrated circumbinary material (CBM) left behind from a prior phase of\nnon-conservative runaway mass transfer. We find that the resulting light curve\nis composed of a short, blue peak followed by a redder, predominantly\nshock-powered plateau with luminosities reaching up to $10^{41}$ erg/s and\ndurations up to 200 days. These luminosities are significantly higher, and the\ndurations much longer, than those produced by a simple spherical ejection of\nthe same mass. They also depend in a complex way on the radial distribution of\nthe CBM. The shock is embedded in the ejecta and its observational signatures\nduring the optically-thick phase are largely hidden. Our results are broadly\ncompatible with observations of the brightest extragalactic LRNe and pave the\nway for the transformation of LRNe into powerful probes of binary evolution.",

To address this\nissue, we introduce two complementary methods that exploit temporal\nconsistency: 1) Temporal Self-Consistency Voting, a training-free, test-time\ndecoding strategy that aggregates predictions across denoising steps to select\nthe most consistent output; and 2) a post-training method termed Temporal\nConsistency Reinforcement, which uses Temporal Semantic Entropy (TSE), a\nmeasure of semantic stability across intermediate predictions, as a reward\nsignal to encourage stable generations.

    "abstract": "There is a growing demand for deploying large generative AI models on mobile\ndevices. For recent popular video generative models, however, the Variational\nAutoEncoder (VAE) represents one of the major computational bottlenecks. Both\nlarge parameter sizes and mismatched kernels cause out-of-memory errors or\nextremely slow inference on mobile devices. To address this, we propose a\nlow-cost solution that efficiently transfers widely used video VAEs to mobile\ndevices. (1) We analyze redundancy in existing VAE architectures and get\nempirical design insights. By integrating 3D depthwise separable convolutions\ninto our model, we significantly reduce the number of parameters. (2) We\nobserve that the upsampling techniques in mainstream video VAEs are poorly\nsuited to mobile hardware and form the main bottleneck. In response, we propose\na decoupled 3D pixel shuffle scheme that slashes end-to-end delay. Building\nupon these, we develop a universal mobile-oriented VAE decoder, Turbo-VAED. (3)\nWe propose an efficient VAE decoder training method. Since only the decoder is\nused during deployment, we distill it to Turbo-VAED instead of retraining the\nfull VAE, enabling fast mobile adaptation with minimal performance loss. To our\nknowledge, our method enables real-time 720p video VAE decoding on mobile\ndevices for the first time. This approach is widely applicable to most video\nVAEs. When integrated into four representative models, with training cost as\nlow as $95, it accelerates original VAEs by up to 84.5x at 720p resolution on\nGPUs, uses as low as 17.5% of original parameter count, and retains 96.9% of\nthe original reconstruction quality. Compared to mobile-optimized VAEs,\nTurbo-VAED achieves a 2.9x speedup in FPS and better reconstruction quality on\nthe iPhone 16 Pro. The code and models will soon be available at\nhttps://github.com/hustvl/Turbo-VAED.",

    "abstract": "Adaptive experimental designs have gained popularity in clinical trials and\nonline experiments. Unlike traditional, fixed experimental designs, adaptive\ndesigns can dynamically adjust treatment randomization probabilities and other\ndesign features in response to data accumulated sequentially during the\nexperiment. These adaptations are useful to achieve diverse objectives,\nincluding reducing uncertainty in the estimation of causal estimands or\nincreasing participants' chances of receiving better treatments during the\nexperiment. At the end of the experiment, it is often desirable to answer\ncausal questions from the observed data. However, the adaptive nature of such\nexperiments and the resulting dependence among observations pose significant\nchallenges to providing valid statistical inference and efficient estimation of\ncausal estimands. Building upon the Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimator\n(TMLE) framework tailored for adaptive designs (van der Laan, 2008), we\nintroduce a new Adaptive-Design-Likelihood-based TMLE (ADL-TMLE) to estimate a\nwide class of causal estimands from adaptive experiment data, including the\naverage treatment effect as our primary example. We establish asymptotic\nnormality and semiparametric efficiency of ADL-TMLE under relaxed positivity\nand design stabilization assumptions for adaptive experiments. Motivated by\nthese results, we further propose a novel adaptive design aimed at minimizing\nthe variance of the estimator based on data generated under that design.\nSimulations show that ADL-TMLE demonstrates superior variance-reduction\nperformance across different types of adaptive experiments, and that the\nproposed adaptive design attains lower variance than the standard\nefficiency-oriented adaptive design. Finally, we generalize our framework to\nbroader settings, including those with longitudinal structures.",

    "abstract": "Quantum resources are certain features of the quantum world that provide\nadvantages in certain information-theoretic, thermodynamic, or any other useful\noperational tasks that are outside the realm of what classical theories can\nachieve. Quantum resource theories provide us with an elegant framework for\nstudying these resources quantitatively and rigorously. While numerous\nstate-based quantum resource theories have already been investigated, and to\nsome extent, measurement-based resource theories have also been explored,\ninstrument-based resource theories remain largely unexplored, with only a few\nnotable exceptions. As quantum instruments are devices that provide both the\nclassical outcomes of induced measurements and the post-measurement quantum\nstates, they are quite important, especially for scenarios where multiple\nparties sequentially act on a quantum system. In this work, we study several\ninstrument-based resource theories, namely (1) the resource theory of\ninformation preservability, (2) the resource theory of (strong) entanglement\npreservability, (3) the resource theory of (strong) incompatibility\npreservability, (4) the resource theory of traditional incompatibility, and (5)\nthe resource theory of parallel incompatibility. Furthermore, we outline the\nhierarchies of these instrument-based resources and provide measures to\nquantify them.

We then cross-correlate (\"cross\") the putative PV signal between\ndifferent, independent patches of sky, and there find no detection of parity\nviolation. The two measurements are in significant tension: while the cross has\nsomewhat larger error bars than the auto, this is not sufficient to explain the\ndiscrepancy.

We aim to identify and classify BCs using high-precision astrometric\nand kinematic data, and to investigate their physical properties, mutual\ngravitational interactions, and formation rates. Methods. We used a\ncomprehensive star cluster catalog that contains 4,084 high-quality clusters.\nBased on spatial and kinematic proximity, we identified 400 cluster pairs\ninvolving 686 unique clusters. These pairs were classified into three types:\nprimordial BCs, systems formed through tidal capture or resonant trapping, and\nhyperbolic encounter pairs. For each system, we calculated the tidal factor to\nquantify the strength of mutual tidal interaction. Additionally, we constructed\nmulti-cluster systems by identifying transitive connections among cluster\npairs. Results. Among the 400 identified cluster pairs, nearly 60.8% (243\npairs) are probably primordial BCs, exhibiting both similar ages and motions.\nThis supports a scenario where they formed together in the same giant molecular\ncloud. We find that 82.5% of the cluster pairs have strong mutual tidal forces.\nIn addition, 278 star clusters are identified as members of 82 multi-cluster\nsystems, including 27 newly reported groups. Cross-matching with the literature\nconfirms the recovery of previously reported systems and leads to the discovery\nof 268 new cluster pairs. In our sample, about 16.8% of star clusters are\ninvolved in some type of interaction with another cluster, and 9.94% of star\nclusters are likely born in primordial BCs. Conclusions. Our results provide a\ncomprehensive, homogeneously identified sample of Galactic BCs. The high\nfraction of primordial BCs and their mutual tidal interaction suggest that\ncluster formation in pairs is a main outcome of star formation. This work\noffers new observational constraints on the formation and dynamical evolution\nof multiple star cluster systems.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are increasingly\ndeployed in real-world applications requiring complex, long-horizon workflows.\nHowever, existing benchmarks predominantly focus on atomic tasks that are\nself-contained and independent, failing to capture the long-term contextual\ndependencies and multi-interaction coordination required in realistic\nscenarios. To address this gap, we introduce OdysseyBench, a comprehensive\nbenchmark for evaluating LLM agents on long-horizon workflows across diverse\noffice applications including Word, Excel, PDF, Email, and Calendar. Our\nbenchmark comprises two complementary splits: OdysseyBench+ with 300 tasks\nderived from real-world use cases, and OdysseyBench-Neo with 302 newly\nsynthesized complex tasks. Each task requires agent to identify essential\ninformation from long-horizon interaction histories and perform multi-step\nreasoning across various applications. To enable scalable benchmark creation,\nwe propose HomerAgents, a multi-agent framework that automates the generation\nof long-horizon workflow benchmarks through systematic environment exploration,\ntask generation, and dialogue synthesis. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates\nthat OdysseyBench effectively challenges state-of-the-art LLM agents, providing\nmore accurate assessment of their capabilities in complex, real-world contexts\ncompared to existing atomic task benchmarks. We believe that OdysseyBench will\nserve as a valuable resource for advancing the development and evaluation of\nLLM agents in real-world productivity scenarios. In addition, we release\nOdysseyBench and HomerAgents to foster research along this line.",

    "abstract": "Vision-language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities as\ncomputer-use agents (CUAs) capable of automating diverse computer tasks.

As these agents will increasingly mediate digital\ninteractions and execute consequential decisions on our behalf, the research\ncommunity needs access to open CUA frameworks to study their capabilities,\nlimitations, and risks. To bridge this gap, we propose OpenCUA, a comprehensive\nopen-source framework for scaling CUA data and foundation models. Our framework\nconsists of: (1) an annotation infrastructure that seamlessly captures human\ncomputer-use demonstrations; (2) AgentNet, the first large-scale computer-use\ntask dataset spanning 3 operating systems and 200+ applications and websites;\n(3) a scalable pipeline that transforms demonstrations into state-action pairs\nwith reflective long Chain-of-Thought reasoning that sustain robust performance\ngains as data scales. Our end-to-end agent models demonstrate strong\nperformance across CUA benchmarks. In particular, OpenCUA-32B achieves an\naverage success rate of 34.8% on OSWorld-Verified, establishing a new\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) among open-source models and surpassing OpenAI CUA\n(GPT-4o).

The\nsolid-state environment allows for a high density of electron and nuclear spins\nwith the potential to form registers for coherent information processing.\nHowever, it is challenging to reliably address individual spins at nanometer\nseparations where interactions are large. Rare-earth ions offer a unique\nsolution, as their narrow homogeneous optical linewidth allows frequency-domain\nresolution of a large number of emitters without regard to their spatial\nseparation. In this work, we realize coherent optical and spin control of a\npair of interacting Er$^{3+}$ ions, together with a nearby nuclear spin\nancilla. We demonstrate two-qubit electron-electron gates and use them to\nperform repeated quantum non-demolition measurements on one of the Er$^{3+}$\nions. We also demonstrate electron-nuclear gates to allow coherent storage and\nretrieval of qubit information in a nuclear spin, and show that the nuclear\nspin coherence survives readout of the electron spin.

It has since been found that\nsimilar apparent artifacts are also present in the $x-\\lambda$ direction, i.e.,\nacross adjacent slit positions. This is difficult (although not impossible) to\ncorrect with the previous matrix inversion method due to the time variation\nbetween slit positions. We have therefore devised a new method which addresses\nboth $x-\\lambda$ and $y-\\lambda$ artifacts simultaneously by applying\nwavelength dependent shifts at each $x-y$ plane of the spectral cube. This\npaper demonstrates the SPICE data issue, describes the new method, and shows a\ncomparison with the previous one. We explore the time variation of the\ncorrection parameters for the SPICE data and show a clear orbit dependence. The\nresults of the method are significantly higher quality derived Doppler signals,\nwhich we estimate at less than $\\sim$ 5 km/s uncertainty for brighter lines in\nthe absence of other systematics.

We examine the\nmetallicity-dependent dynamical properties of high-[Mg/Fe] stars in the bar\nregion, using samples of low- and high-[Mg/Fe] stars from APOGEE DR17,\ncomplemented by the PIGS catalogue of [Fe/H] $ < -1 $ stars. The mean\nGalactocentric rotational velocity $ \\overline V_\\phi(R) $ is nearly\ncylindrical for both low- and high-[Mg/Fe] stars across the bulge and outer\nbar. $\\overline V_\\phi(R)$ of high-[Mg/Fe] stars with [Fe/H] $ \\ge -0.6 $ is\nsimilar within errors to low-[Mg/Fe] stars in the bulge, and $ 10-20\\% $ lower\nin the outer bar. The mean radial velocity field of these stars exhibits a\nquadrupole pattern similar to low-[Mg/Fe] stars. Orbit integrations in\nrealistic barred Galactic potentials show that these model-independent\nproperties correspond to a peanut bulge in the orbital density distributions\nfor high-[Mg/Fe] stars with [Fe/H] $ \\ge -0.6 $, transitioning toward a more\nspheroidal structure at lower metallicities. Additionally, $ \\overline V_\\phi$\n([Fe/H]) increases steeply as metallicity rises from about [Fe/H] $ \\sim -1.3\n$, resembling the spin-up observed at larger Galactic radii.

Our results strengthen the case that the bulk of the\nhigh-[Mg/Fe] component in the bar region evolved from an alpha-enhanced disc,\nwhile metal-poor stars with [Fe/H] $ < -1 $ trace a more turbulent origin.",

To this\npoint, the term efficiency has been quantified through applications to Spectral\nEfficiency (SE) and Energy Efficiency (EE). In this paper we introduce a new\nsystem metric called Radio Resource Utilization Efficiency (RUE). This metric\nquantifies the efficiency of the available radio resources (Spectrum, Access\nMethod, Time Slots, Data Symbols, etc.) used to deliver future 6G demands. We\ncompare the system performance of Typical Cellular and Cell-Free Massive MIMO\ndeployments as a vehicle to demonstrate the need for this new metric. We begin\nby providing a concise treatment of items impacting SE by introducing three\ncategories: 5G Radio Resources, Practical Limitations (such as channel matrix\nrank deficiency) and Implementation Losses (SINR degradation). For the example\nRadio Access Technology configuration analyzed, we show 5G yields an RUE of 47%\n(revealing significant room for improvement when defining 6G). Practical\nlimitation assumptions are compared to 5G Multi-User MIMO (MU-MIMO)\nmeasurements conducted in a commercialized deployment. SE losses are\ncharacterized to offer guidance to advanced algorithms employing Machine\nLearning (ML) based techniques.

The analysis begins with a\nsimple quadratic game from which we derive tight convergence conditions through\nthe lens of linear control theory. Then, we provide a quasidominance condition\nfor general convex games. Our results demonstrate that this condition is\nstringent since when this condition is not satisfied, the asynchronous games\nmay fail to converge. We propose both first- and zeroth-order learning\nalgorithms for asynchronous games, depending on the type of available feedback,\nand analyze their last-iterate convergence rates. Numerical experiments are\npresented on economic market problems to verify our results.",

While\nnumerous benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate their code generation\nabilities, these benchmarks face several critical limitations. First, they\noften rely on manual annotations, which are time-consuming and difficult to\nscale across different programming languages and problem complexities. Second,\nmost existing benchmarks focus primarily on Python, while the few multilingual\nbenchmarks suffer from limited difficulty and uneven language distribution. To\naddress these challenges, we propose AutoCodeGen, an automated method for\ngenerating high-difficulty multilingual code generation datasets without manual\nannotations. AutoCodeGen ensures the correctness and completeness of test cases\nby generating test inputs with LLMs and obtaining test outputs through a\nmultilingual sandbox, while achieving high data quality through reverse-order\nproblem generation and multiple filtering steps. Using this novel method, we\nintroduce AutoCodeBench, a large-scale code generation benchmark comprising\n3,920 problems evenly distributed across 20 programming languages. It is\nspecifically designed to evaluate LLMs on challenging, diverse, and practical\nmultilingual tasks. We evaluate over 30 leading open-source and proprietary\nLLMs on AutoCodeBench and its simplified version AutoCodeBench-Lite. The\nresults show that even the most advanced LLMs struggle with the complexity,\ndiversity, and multilingual nature of these tasks. Besides, we introduce\nAutoCodeBench-Complete, specifically designed for base models to assess their\nfew-shot code generation capabilities.

A recent line of work mitigates this by using\nsymbolic solvers: the model directly generates a formal program that a geometry\nsolver can execute. However, this direct program generation lacks intermediate\nreasoning, making the decision process opaque and prone to errors. In this\nwork, we explore a new approach that integrates Chain-of-Thought (CoT) with\nformal language. The model interleaves natural language reasoning with\nincremental emission of solver-executable code, producing a hybrid reasoning\ntrace in which critical derivations are expressed in formal language. To teach\nthis behavior at scale, we combine (1) supervised fine-tuning on an 11K newly\ndeveloped synthetic dataset with interleaved natural language reasoning and\nautomatic formalization, and (2) solver-in-the-loop reinforcement learning that\njointly optimizes both the CoT narrative and the resulting program through\noutcome-based rewards. Built on Qwen2.5-VL-7B, our new model, named\nGF-Reasoner, achieves up to 15% accuracy improvements on standard GPS\nbenchmarks, surpassing both 7B-scale peers and the much larger model\nQwen2.5-VL-72B. By exploiting high-order geometric knowledge and offloading\nsymbolic computation to the solver, the generated reasoning traces are\nnoticeably shorter and cleaner.

    "abstract": "We introduce Chi-Geometry - a library that generates graph data for testing\nand benchmarking GNNs' ability to predict chirality. Chi-Geometry generates\nsynthetic graph samples with (i) user-specified geometric and topological\ntraits to isolate certain types of samples and (ii) randomized node positions\nand species to minimize extraneous correlations. Each generated graph contains\nexactly one chiral center labeled either R or S, while all other nodes are\nlabeled N/A (non-chiral). The generated samples are then combined into a\ncohesive dataset that can be used to assess a GNN's ability to predict\nchirality as a node classification task. Chi-Geometry allows more interpretable\nand less confounding benchmarking of GNNs for prediction of chirality in the\ngraph samples which can guide the design of new GNN architectures with improved\npredictive performance. We illustrate Chi-Geometry's efficacy by using it to\ngenerate synthetic datasets for benchmarking various state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nGNN architectures. The conclusions of these benchmarking results guided our\ndesign of two new GNN architectures. The first GNN architecture established\nall-to-all connections in the graph to accurately predict chirality across all\nchallenging configurations where previously tested SOTA models failed, but at a\ncomputational cost (both for training and inference) that grows quadratically\nwith the number of graph nodes. The second GNN architecture avoids all-to-all\nconnections by introducing a virtual node in the original graph structure of\nthe data, which restores the linear scaling of training and inference\ncomputational cost with respect to the number of nodes in the graph, while\nstill ensuring competitive accuracy in detecting chirality with respect to SOTA\nGNN architectures.",

To address these challenges, we\npropose a novel retrieval framework named SPARC(Soft Probabilistic Adaptive\nRetrieval Model via Codebooks). Our contribution is two folds. First, the\nframework utilizes Residual Quantized Variational Autoencoder (RQ-VAE) to\nconstruct a discretized interest space. It achieves joint training of the\nRQ-VAE with the industrial large scale recommendation model, mining\nbehavior-aware interests that can perceive user feedback and evolve\ndynamically. Secondly, a probabilistic interest module that predicts the\nprobability distribution over the entire dynamic and discrete interest space.\nThis facilitates an efficient \"soft-search\" strategy during online inference,\nrevolutionizing the retrieval paradigm from \"passive matching\" to \"proactive\nexploration\" and thereby effectively promoting interest discovery.

Unfortunately, MLLM-based\noutdoor health monitoring also faces significant challenges: I) sensor data\ncontains input noise stemming from sensor data acquisition and fluctuation\nnoise caused by sudden changes in physiological signals due to dynamic outdoor\nenvironments, thus degrading the training performance; ii) current transformer\nbased MLLMs struggle to achieve robust multimodal fusion, as they lack a design\nfor fusing the noisy modality; iii) modalities with varying noise levels hinder\naccurate recovery of missing data from fluctuating distributions. To combat\nthese challenges, we propose an uncertainty-aware multimodal fusion framework,\nnamed DUAL-Health, for outdoor health monitoring in dynamic and noisy\nenvironments. First, to assess the impact of noise, we accurately quantify\nmodality uncertainty caused by input and fluctuation noise with current and\ntemporal features.

While promising, such methods often\nunderperform in practice compared to well-tuned ID-based baselines like SASRec.\nIn this paper, we identify two key limitations holding back generative\napproaches: the lack of collaborative signal in item tokenization, and\ninefficiencies in the commonly used encoder-decoder architecture. To address\nthese issues, we introduce COSETTE, a contrastive tokenization method that\nintegrates collaborative information directly into the learned item\nrepresentations, jointly optimizing for both content reconstruction and\nrecommendation relevance. Additionally, we propose MARIUS, a lightweight,\naudio-inspired generative model that decouples timeline modeling from item\ndecoding. MARIUS reduces inference cost while improving recommendation\naccuracy. Experiments on standard sequential recommendation benchmarks show\nthat our approach narrows, or even eliminates, the performance gap between\ngenerative and modern ID-based models, while retaining the benefits of the\ngenerative paradigm.",

    "abstract": "While proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) is widely used for model\nreduction, its standard form does not take into account any parametric model\nstructure. Extensions to POD have been proposed to address this, but these\neither require large amounts of solution data, lack online adaptivity, or have\nlimited approximation accuracy. We circumvent these limitations by instead\nassigning weights to the snapshot matrix columns, and updating these whenever\nthe model is evaluated at a new point in the parameter space. We derive an a\nposteriori error bound that depends on these snapshot weights, show how these\nweights can be chosen to tighten the error bound, and present an algorithm to\ncompute the corresponding reduced basis efficiently. We show how this weighted\nPOD approach can be used to naturally generalize the calculation of reduced\nbasis derivatives to situations with multidimensional parameter spaces and\nsnapshots at multiple locations in the parameter space. Lastly, we cover how\nthese approaches can be implemented within an optimization algorithm, without\nthe need for an offline training phase. The proposed weighted POD methods with\nand without reduced basis derivatives are applied to a gradient-based shell\nthickness optimization problem with 105 design parameters and a time-dependent\npartial differential equation. The numerical solutions obtained for this\nproblem attain errors that are several orders of magnitude smaller when using\nweighted POD than those computed with regular POD and Grassmann manifold\ninterpolation, while having comparable wall times per query and requiring fewer\nhigh-dimensional model snapshots to reach an optimal solution.",

    "abstract": "We present a measurement of the non-Gaussian four-point correlation function\n(4PCF) from the DESI DR1 Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) sample. For the\ngravitationally induced parity-even 4PCF, we detect a signal with a\nsignificance of 14.7$\\sigma$ using our fiducial setup. We assess the robustness\nof this detection through a series of validation tests, including auto- and\ncross-correlation analyses, sky partitioning across multiple patch\ncombinations, and variations in radial scale cuts. Due to the low completeness\nof the sample, we find that differences in fiber assignment implementation\nschemes can significantly impact estimation of the covariance and introduce\nbiases in the data vector. After correcting for these effects, all tests yield\nconsistent results. This is one of the first measurements of the connected 4PCF\non the DESI LRG sample: the good agreement between the simulation and the data\nimplies that the amplitude of the density fluctuation inferred from the\nconnected 4PCF is consistent with the Planck $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology. The\nmethodology and diagnostic framework established in this work provide a\nfoundation for interpreting parity-odd 4PCF.",

The state-of-the-art for predicting missing links in the\nhard case of a network without node attributes uses model stacking or neural\nnetwork techniques. It remains unknown which approach is best, and whether or\nhow the best choice of algorithm depends on the input network's\ncharacteristics. We answer these questions systematically using a large,\nstructurally diverse benchmark of 550 real-world networks under two standard\naccuracy measures (AUC and Top-k), comparing four stacking algorithms with 42\ntopological link predictors, two of which we introduce here, and two graph\nneural network algorithms. We show that no algorithm is best across all input\nnetworks, all algorithms perform well on most social networks, and few perform\nwell on economic and biological networks. Overall, model stacking with a random\nforest is both highly scalable and surpasses on AUC or is competitive with\ngraph neural networks on Top-k accuracy. But, algorithm performance depends\nstrongly on network characteristics like the degree distribution, triangle\ndensity, and degree assortativity. We introduce a meta-learning algorithm that\nexploits this variability to optimize link predictions for individual networks\nby selecting the best algorithm to apply, which we show outperforms all\nstate-of-the-art algorithms and scales to large networks.",

Like any field-deployed, safety-critical asset,\nit can fail, triggering cascading disruptions. Many failures originate as\nsubtle anomalies that evolve over time, often not visually apparent in\nmonitored signals. Conventional approaches, which rely on clear signal changes,\nstruggle to detect them early. Early identification of failure types is\nessential to improve maintenance planning, minimising downtime and revenue\nloss. Leveraging deep neural networks, we propose a predictive maintenance\nframework that classifies anomalies well before they escalate into failures.\nValidated on 10 CVCM failure cases across different installations, the method\nis ISO-17359 compliant and outperforms conventional techniques, achieving\n99.31% overall accuracy with detection within 1% of anomaly onset. Through\nconformal prediction, we provide uncertainty estimates, reaching 99% confidence\nwith consistent coverage across classes.

Moreover, less complex deep learning models are desired for practical\nusage, as well as for deployment on portable devices. In or-der to fill the\nabove gaps, we, in this study, proposed a light-weight and unified decoding\nmodel for cross-BCI-paradigm classification. The proposed model starts with a\ntempo-spatial convolution. It is followed by a multi-scale local feature\nselec-tion module, aiming to extract local features shared across BCI paradigms\nand generate weighted features. Finally, a mul-ti-dimensional global feature\nextraction module is designed, in which multi-dimensional global features are\nextracted from the weighted features and fused with the weighted features to\nform high-level feature representations associated with BCI para-digms. The\nresults, evaluated on a mixture of three classical BCI paradigms (i.e., MI,\nSSVEP, and P300), demon-strate that the proposed model achieves 88.39%, 82.36%,\n80.01%, and 0.8092 for accuracy, macro-precision, mac-ro-recall, and\nmacro-F1-score, respectively, significantly out-performing the compared models.\nThis study pro-vides a feasible solution for cross-BCI-paradigm\nclassifica-tion.

    "abstract": "Although large language models (LLMs) hold significant promise in\npsychotherapy, their direct application in patient-facing scenarios raises\nethical and safety concerns. Therefore, this work shifts towards developing an\nLLM as a supervisor to train real therapists. In addition to the privacy of\nclinical therapist training data, a fundamental contradiction complicates the\ntraining of therapeutic behaviors: clear feedback standards are necessary to\nensure a controlled training system, yet there is no absolute \"gold standard\"\nfor appropriate therapeutic behaviors in practice. In contrast, many common\ntherapeutic mistakes are universal and identifiable, making them effective\ntriggers for targeted feedback that can serve as clearer evidence. Motivated by\nthis, we create a novel therapist-training paradigm: (1) guidelines for\nmistaken behaviors and targeted correction strategies are first established as\nstandards; (2) a human-in-the-loop dialogue-feedback dataset is then\nconstructed, where a mistake-prone agent intentionally makes standard mistakes\nduring interviews naturally, and a supervisor agent locates and identifies\nmistakes and provides targeted feedback; (3) after fine-tuning on this dataset,\nthe final supervisor model is provided for real therapist training. The\ndetailed experimental results of automated, human and downstream assessments\ndemonstrate that models fine-tuned on our dataset MATE, can provide\nhigh-quality feedback according to the clinical guideline, showing significant\npotential for the therapist training scenario.",

This situation raises the question whether\nthe simulation results are physically meaningful. We demonstrate that, in fact,\nthe two truncation schemes correspond to two well-defined, distinct unitary\nevolutions whose generators are defined on different subsets of the\ninfinite-dimensional Fock space. This is a consequence of the fact that the\ngeneralized squeezing Hamiltonian is not self-adjoint on states with finite\nexcitations, but possesses multiple self-adjoint extensions. Furthermore, we\npresent results on the spectrum of the squeezing operators corresponding to\neven and odd truncation size that elucidate the properties of the two different\nself-adjoint extensions corresponding to the even and odd truncation scheme. To\nmake the squeezing operator applicable to a physical system, we must regularize\nit by other terms that depend on the specifics of the experimental\nimplementation. We show that the addition of a Kerr interaction term in the\nHamiltonian leads to uniquely converging simulations, with no dependence on the\nparity of the truncation size, and demonstrate that the Kerr term indeed\nrenders the Hamiltonian self-adjoint and thus physically interpretable.",

Most\nstudied in short-lived and small-bodied species, cycles frequently appear to be\ndriven by density-dependent feedbacks. However, compelling evidence of cycles\n-- often more qualitative than quantitative -- also exists in large mammals.\nAmong ungulates, both density-dependent vital rates and 'cohort effects'\n(lasting impacts of birth conditions on fecundity and survival) exist, but the\nimplications of such feedbacks for oscillatory population dynamics have not\nbeen explored. Here, we present a synthetic model of ungulate population\ndynamics, parameterized for barren-ground caribou (Rangifer tarandus\ngroenlandicus) and motivated by extensive Indigenous knowledge suggesting\ndecades-long fluctuations in abundance. Caribou herds are theorized to be\nsubject to both cohort effects and density dependence, and we linked these\nendogenous factors with environmental stochasticity to understand cycling.\nUsing wavelet analysis, we characterized periodic phenomena and performed\nsensitivity analyses to clarify the drivers and characteristics of population\ncycles. We found that cohort effects, predominantly those impacting survival,\ncan produce long-period oscillatory behavior across a wide range of\nenvironments and demographic structures. Our modeling framework is\ngeneralizable to other long-lived, large-bodied species with complex\ndemography, and collectively, these efforts broaden the scope of inquiry into\nproximal drivers of population cycling.",

    "abstract": "Serving disaggregated large language models has been widely adopted in\nindustrial practice for enhanced performance. However, too many tokens\ngenerated in decoding phase, i.e., occupying the resources for a long time,\nessentially hamper the cloud from achieving a higher throughput. Meanwhile, due\nto limited on-device resources, the time to first token (TTFT), i.e., the\nlatency of prefill phase, increases dramatically with the growth on prompt\nlength. In order to concur with such a bottleneck on resources, i.e., long\noccupation in cloud and limited on-device computing capacity, we propose to\nseparate large language model between cloud and devices. That is, the cloud\nhelps a portion of the content for each device, only in its prefill phase.\nSpecifically, after receiving the first token from the cloud, decoupling with\nits own prefill, the device responds to the user immediately for a lower TTFT.\nThen, the following tokens from cloud are presented via a speed controller for\nsmoothed TPOT (the time per output token), until the device catches up with the\nprogress. On-device prefill is then amortized using received tokens while the\nresource usage in cloud is controlled. Moreover, during cloud prefill, the\nprompt can be refined, using those intermediate data already generated, to\nfurther speed up on-device inference. We implement such a scheme P/D-Device,\nand confirm its superiority over other alternatives. We further propose an\nalgorithm to decide the best settings. Real-trace experiments show that TTFT\ndecreases at least 60%, maximum TPOT is about tens of milliseconds, and cloud\nthroughput increases by up to 15x.",

Due to their\ncharacteristics including world knowledge and generalizability, artistic style\nand creativity, and multimodal integration, we envision that GenAI may benefit\na variety of cartographic design decisions, from mapmaking (e.g.,\nconceptualization, data preparation, map design, and map evaluation) to map use\n(such as map reading, interpretation, and analysis). This paper discusses\nseveral important topics regarding why and how GenAI benefits cartography with\ncase studies including symbolization, map evaluation, and map reading. Despite\nits unprecedented potential, we identify key scenarios where GenAI may not be\nsuitable, such as tasks that require a deep understanding of cartographic\nknowledge or prioritize precision and reliability. We also emphasize the need\nto consider ethical and social implications, such as concerns related to\nhallucination, reproducibility, bias, copyright, and explainability.

    "abstract": "Passenger waiting time prediction plays a critical role in enhancing both\nridesharing user experience and platform efficiency. While most existing\nresearch focuses on post-request waiting time prediction with knowing the\nmatched driver information, pre-request waiting time prediction (i.e., before\nsubmitting a ride request and without matching a driver) is also important, as\nit enables passengers to plan their trips more effectively and enhance the\nexperience of both passengers and drivers. However, it has not been fully\nstudied by existing works. In this paper, we take the first step toward\nunderstanding the predictability and explainability of pre-request passenger\nwaiting time in ridesharing systems. Particularly, we conduct an in-depth\ndata-driven study to investigate the impact of demand&supply dynamics on\npassenger waiting time. Based on this analysis and feature engineering, we\npropose FiXGBoost, a novel feature interaction-based XGBoost model designed to\npredict waiting time without knowing the assigned driver information. We\nfurther perform an importance analysis to quantify the contribution of each\nfactor. Experiments on a large-scale real-world ridesharing dataset including\nover 30 million trip records show that our FiXGBoost can achieve a good\nperformance for pre-request passenger waiting time prediction with high\nexplainability.",

    "abstract": "SQL query rewriting aims to reformulate a query into a more efficient form\nwhile preserving equivalence. Most existing methods rely on predefined rewrite\nrules. However, such rule-based approaches face fundamental limitations: (1)\nfixed rule sets generalize poorly to novel query patterns and struggle with\ncomplex queries; (2) a wide range of effective rewriting strategies cannot be\nfully captured by declarative rules. To overcome these issues, we propose using\nlarge language models (LLMs) to generate rewrites. LLMs can capture complex\nstrategies, such as evaluation reordering and CTE rewriting. Despite this\npotential, directly applying LLMs often results in performance regressions or\nnon-equivalent rewrites due to a lack of execution awareness and semantic\ngrounding. To address these challenges, We present E3-Rewrite, an LLM-based SQL\nrewriting framework that produces executable, equivalent, and efficient\nqueries. It integrates two core components: a context construction module and a\nreinforcement learning framework. First, the context module leverages execution\nplans and retrieved demonstrations to build bottleneck-aware prompts that guide\ninference-time rewriting. Second, we design a reward function targeting\nexecutability, equivalence, and efficiency, evaluated via syntax checks,\nequivalence verification, and cost estimation. Third, to ensure stable\nmulti-objective learning, we adopt a staged curriculum that first emphasizes\nexecutability and equivalence, then gradually incorporates efficiency. Across\nmultiple SQL benchmarks, our experiments demonstrate that E3-Rewrite can\nshorten query execution time by as much as 25.6% relative to leading baselines,\nwhile also producing up to 24.4% more rewrites that meet strict equivalence\ncriteria. These gains extend to challenging query patterns that prior\napproaches could not effectively optimize.",

    "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) become more integrated into societal systems,\nthe risk of them perpetuating and amplifying harmful biases becomes a critical\nsafety concern. Traditional methods for mitigating bias often rely on data\nfiltering or post-hoc output moderation, which treat the model as an opaque\nblack box. In this work, we introduce a complete, end-to-end system that uses\ntechniques from mechanistic interpretability to both identify and actively\nmitigate bias directly within a model's internal workings. Our method involves\ntwo primary stages. First, we train linear \"probes\" on the internal activations\nof a model to detect the latent representations of various biases (e.g.,\ngender, race, age). Our experiments on \\texttt{gpt2-large} demonstrate that\nthese probes can identify biased content with near-perfect accuracy, revealing\nthat bias representations become most salient in the model's later layers.\nSecond, we leverage these findings to compute \"steering vectors\" by contrasting\nthe model's activation patterns for biased and neutral statements. By adding\nthese vectors during inference, we can actively steer the model's generative\nprocess away from producing harmful, stereotypical, or biased content in\nreal-time. We demonstrate the efficacy of this activation steering technique,\nshowing that it successfully alters biased completions toward more neutral\nalternatives.

Several mean-teacher (MT) based semi-supervised methods utilize\nconsistency regularization to effectively leverage valuable information from\nunlabeled data. However, these methods often heavily rely on the student model\nand overlook the potential impact of cognitive biases within the model.\nFurthermore, some methods employ co-training using pseudo-labels derived from\ndifferent inputs, yet generating high-confidence pseudo-labels from perturbed\ninputs during training remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we\npropose an Uncertainty-aware Cross-training framework for semi-supervised\nmedical image Segmentation (UC-Seg). Our UC-Seg framework incorporates two\ndistinct subnets to effectively explore and leverage the correlation between\nthem, thereby mitigating cognitive biases within the model. Specifically, we\npresent a Cross-subnet Consistency Preservation (CCP) strategy to enhance\nfeature representation capability and ensure feature consistency across the two\nsubnets. This strategy enables each subnet to correct its own biases and learn\nshared semantics from both labeled and unlabeled data. Additionally, we propose\nan Uncertainty-aware Pseudo-label Generation (UPG) component that leverages\nsegmentation results and corresponding uncertainty maps from both subnets to\ngenerate high-confidence pseudo-labels. We extensively evaluate the proposed\nUC-Seg on various medical image segmentation tasks involving different modality\nimages, such as MRI, CT, ultrasound, colonoscopy, and so on.

Unlike\nShubnikov-de Haas oscillations, which appear at magnetic fields $ > 7$ T and\ndiminish quickly as the temperature rises, these $B$-periodic oscillations\nemerge at low fields and persist up to 10 K.

Increasing the carrier density through electrostatic gating\nresults in a systematic reduction in both the amplitude and frequency of the\noscillations, with complete suppression beyond a certain gate voltage. We\nattribute these oscillations to the Altshuler-Aronov-Spivak effect, likely\narising from naturally formed closed-loop paths due to the interconnected\nquasi-one-dimensional conduction channels along SrTiO$_3$ domain walls.

In fact, achieving\nperfect decomposition of illumination and reflectance components proves to be\nquite challenging, with some residuals still existing after decomposition. In\nthis paper, we formally name these residuals as inter-component residuals\n(ICR), which has been largely underestimated by previous methods.

To address this issue, we propose\na novel Inter-correction Retinex model (IRetinex) to alleviate ICR during the\ndecomposition and enhancement stage. In the decomposition stage, we leverage\ninter-component residual reduction module to reduce the feature similarity\nbetween illumination and reflectance components. In the enhancement stage, we\nutilize the feature similarity between the two components to detect and\nmitigate the impact of ICR within each enhancement unit.

In this work, we present a\nframework that autonomously generates realistic and diverse robotic emotional\nexpressions based on expert human demonstrations captured in Mixed Reality\n(MR). Our system enables experts to teleoperate a virtual robot from a\nfirst-person perspective, capturing their facial expressions, head movements,\nand upper-body gestures, and mapping these behaviors onto corresponding robotic\ncomponents including eyes, ears, neck, and arms. Leveraging a\nflow-matching-based generative process, our model learns to produce coherent\nand varied behaviors in real-time in response to moving objects, conditioned\nexplicitly on given emotional states.

    "abstract": "Context. Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have traditionally been classified by\nduration into long (LGRBs) and short (SGRBs), with the former believed to\noriginate from massive star collapses and the latter from compact binary\nmergers. However, events such as the SGRB 200826A (coming from a collapsar) and\nthe LGRBs 211211A and 230307A (associated with a merger) suggest that\nduration-based classification could be sometimes misleading. Recently, the\nminimum variability timescale (MVT) has emerged as a key metric for classifying\nGRBs.\n  Aims. We calculate the MVT, defined as the full width at half maximum (FWHM)\nof the narrowest pulse in the light curve, using an independent dataset from\nFermi/GBM and we compare our results with other MVT definitions. We update the\nMVT-T90 plane and analyse peculiar events like long-duration merger candidates\n211211A, 230307A, and other short GRBs with extended emission (SEE-GRBs). We\nalso examine extragalactic magnetar giant flares (MGFs) and explore possible\nnew correlations with peak energy.\n  Methods. We used the MEPSA algorithm to identify the shortest pulse in each\nGRB light curve and measure its FWHM. We calculated the MVT for around 3700\nGRBs, 177 of which with spectroscopically known redshift.\n  Results. SEE-GRBs and SGRBs share similar MVTs (from few tens to a few\nhundreds of ms), indicating a common progenitor, while extragalactic MGFs\nexhibit even shorter values (from few ms to few tens of ms). Our MVT estimation\nmethod consistently yields higher values than another existing technique, the\nlatter aligning with the pulse rise time. For LGRBs, we confirmed the\ncorrelations of MVT with peak luminosity and Lorentz factor.\n  Conclusions. We confirmed that, although MVT alone cannot determine the GRB\nprogenitor, it is a valuable tool when combined with other indicators, helping\nto flag long-duration mergers and distinguish MGFs from typical SGRBs.",

To address these challenges, we introduce MSQ, a\nnovel quantization method that compresses the motion sequence into multi-scale\ndiscrete tokens across spatial and temporal dimensions. MSQ employs distinct\nencoders to capture body parts at varying spatial granularities and temporally\ninterpolates the encoded features into multiple scales before quantizing them\ninto discrete tokens. Building on this representation, we establish a\ngenerative mask modeling model to effectively support motion editing, motion\ncontrol, and conditional motion generation. Through quantitative and\nqualitative analysis, we show that our quantization method enables the seamless\ncomposition of motion tokens without requiring specialized design or\nre-training.

Despite\nadvancements in video comprehension, the substantial computational demands of\nlong video sequences lead current video LLMs (Vid-LLMs) to employ compression\nstrategies at both the inter-frame level (e.g., uniform sampling of video\nframes) and intra-frame level (e.g., condensing all visual tokens of each frame\ninto a limited number). However, this approach often neglects the uneven\ntemporal distribution of critical information across frames, risking the\nomission of keyframes that contain essential temporal and semantic details. To\ntackle these challenges, we propose KFFocus, a method designed to efficiently\ncompress video tokens and emphasize the informative context present within\nvideo frames. We substitute uniform sampling with a refined approach inspired\nby classic video compression principles to identify and capture keyframes based\non their temporal redundancy. By assigning varying condensation ratios to\nframes based on their contextual relevance, KFFocus efficiently reduces token\nredundancy while preserving informative content details. Additionally, we\nintroduce a spatiotemporal modeling module that encodes both the temporal\nrelationships between video frames and the spatial structure within each frame,\nthus providing Vid-LLMs with a nuanced understanding of spatial-temporal\ndynamics.

For $p$-type doping,\nthe calculated electrical conductivities ($\\sigma$), hole mobilities ($\\mu$),\nSeebeck coefficients ($S$), and power factors (PFs) of CuGaTe$_2$ and\nCuInTe$_2$ show excellent agreement with experimental data. At fixed\ntemperature and hole concentration, as $X$ varies from S to Te, the hole\nmobility increases markedly due to progressively weaker polar--optical--phonon\nscattering, reflecting the reduced ionic contribution to the dielectric\nresponse in compounds with heavier chalcogens. Combined with smaller transport\neffective masses, Cu$M$Te$_2$ compounds therefore exhibit high $\\sigma$ and\nlarge PFs.

We\ncompare the survival probabilities of Gaia and GW progenitor binaries as a\nfunction of natal kick strength and pre-supernova binary parameters, and map\nout the parameter space and kick strength required to disrupt the progenitor\nbinaries leading to low-mass BHs in Gaia systems more frequently than those in\nGW systems.",

    "abstract": "This work focuses on Hierarchical Inference (HI) in edge intelligence\nsystems, where a compact Local-ML model on an end-device works in conjunction\nwith a high-accuracy Remote-ML model on an edge-server. HI aims to reduce\nlatency, improve accuracy, and lower bandwidth usage by first using the\nLocal-ML model for inference and offloading to the Remote-ML only when the\nlocal inference is likely incorrect. A critical challenge in HI is estimating\nthe likelihood of the local inference being incorrect, especially when data\ndistributions and offloading costs change over time -- a problem we term\nHierarchical Inference Learning (HIL). We introduce a novel approach to HIL by\nmodeling the probability of correct inference by the Local-ML as an increasing\nfunction of the model's confidence measure, a structure motivated by empirical\nobservations but previously unexploited. We propose two policies, HI-LCB and\nHI-LCB-lite, based on the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) framework. We\ndemonstrate that both policies achieve order-optimal regret of $O(\\log T)$, a\nsignificant improvement over existing HIL policies with $O(T^{2/3})$ regret\nguarantees. Notably, HI-LCB-lite has an $O(1)$ per-sample computational\ncomplexity, making it well-suited for deployment on devices with severe\nresource limitations. Simulations using real-world datasets confirm that our\npolicies outperform existing state-of-the-art HIL methods.",

In this\nwork, we introduce Rational Inverse Reasoning (RIR), a framework for inferring\nthese latent programs through a hierarchical generative model of behavior. RIR\nframes few-shot imitation as Bayesian program induction: a vision-language\nmodel iteratively proposes structured symbolic task hypotheses, while a\nplanner-in-the-loop inference scheme scores each by the likelihood of the\nobserved demonstration under that hypothesis. This loop yields a posterior over\nconcise, executable programs. We evaluate RIR on a suite of continuous\nmanipulation tasks designed to test one-shot and few-shot generalization across\nvariations in object pose, count, geometry, and layout. With as little as one\ndemonstration, RIR infers the intended task structure and generalizes to novel\nsettings, outperforming state-of-the-art vision-language model baselines.",

This study designs and\ncalibrates a Urban Theory-Informed Spatio-Temporal Attention Model for\nPredicting Post-Disaster Commercial Land Use Change (Urban-STA4CLC) to predict\nboth the yearly decline and expansion of commercial land use at census block\nlevel under cumulative impact of disasters on human activities over two years.\nGuided by urban theories, Urban-STA4CLC integrates both spatial and temporal\nattention mechanisms with three theory-informed modules. Resilience theory\nguides a disaster-aware temporal attention module that captures visitation\ndynamics. Spatial economic theory informs a multi-relational spatial attention\nmodule for inter-block representation. Diffusion theory contributes a\nregularization term that constrains land use transitions. The model performs\nsignificantly better than non-theoretical baselines in predicting commercial\nland use change under the scenario of recurrent hurricanes, with around 19%\nimprovement in F1 score (0.8763). The effectiveness of the theory-guided\nmodules was further validated through ablation studies.

While\ntraditional change detection methods have been employed to detect changes from\nbi-temporal images, these approaches typically require expert knowledge for\naccurate interpretation.

However, existing CDVQA methods have\nbeen developed under the assumption that training and testing datasets share\nsimilar distributions. This assumption does not hold in real-world\napplications, where domain shifts often occur. In this paper, the CDVQA task is\nrevisited with a focus on addressing domain shift.

    "abstract": "Lightcone distribution amplitudes for a light baryon can be extracted through\nthe simulation of the quasi-distribution amplitudes (quasi-DAs) on the lattice.\nWe implement the hybrid renormalization for the quasi DAs of light baryons.\nLattice simulations are performed using $N_f = 2+1$ stout-smeared clover\nfermions and a tree-level Symanzik-improved gauge action, with three lattice\nspacings of ${0.105, 0.077, 0.052}$ fm. By analyzing zero-momentum matrix\nelements for different lattice spacings, we extract the linear divergence\nassociated with the Wilson-line self-energy. Matching to perturbative matrix\nelements in the $\\overline{\\text{MS}}$ scheme yields the residual\nself-renormalization factors. Using these factors, we renormalize the quasi-DAs\nwithin the hybrid scheme, which combines self-renormalization at large\nseparations and the ratio scheme at short distances. The renormalized results\ndemonstrate effective cancellation of linear divergences and yield smooth,\ncontinuum-like coordinate-space distributions suitable for subsequent Fourier\ntransformation and perturbative matching. These results establish the viability\nof both self and hybrid renormalization frameworks for light baryon quasi-DAs,\nproviding a robust foundation for LaMET-based determinations of light-cone\ndistribution amplitudes.",

    "abstract": "A major challenge in understanding the initiation and evolution of coronal\nmass ejections (CMEs) is measuring the magnetic field of the magnetic flux\nropes (MFRs) that drive CMEs. Recent developments in radio imaging spectroscopy\nhave paved the way for diagnosing the CMEs' magnetic field using\ngyrosynchrotron radiation. We present magnetic field measurements of a CME\nassociated with an X5-class flare by combining radio imaging spectroscopy data\nin microwaves (1--18 GHz) and meter-wave (20--88 MHz), obtained by the Owens\nValley Radio Observatory's Expanded Owens Valley Solar Array (EOVSA) and Long\nWavelength Array (OVRO-LWA), respectively. EOVSA observations reveal that the\nmicrowave source, observed in the low corona during the initiation phase of the\neruption, outlines the bottom of the rising MFR-hosting CME bubble seen in\nextreme ultraviolet and expands as the bubble evolves. As the MFR erupts into\nthe middle corona and appears as a white light CME, its meter-wave counterpart,\nobserved by OVRO-LWA, displays a similar morphology. For the first time, using\ngyrosynchrotron spectral diagnostics, we obtain magnetic field measurements of\nthe erupting MFR in both the low and middle corona, corresponding to coronal\nheights of 0.02 and 1.83 $R_{\\odot}$. The magnetic field strength is found to\nbe around 300 G at 0.02 $R_{\\odot}$ during the CME initiation, and about 0.6 G\nnear the leading edge of the CME when it propagates to 1.83 $R_{\\odot}$. These\nresults provide critical new insights into the magnetic structure of the CME\nand its evolution during the early stages of its eruption.",

    "abstract": "In the framework of mutually unbiased bases (MUBs), a measurement in one\nbasis gives \\emph{no information} about the outcomes of measurements in another\nbasis. Here, we relax the no-information condition by allowing the $d$ outcomes\nto be predicted according to a predefined probability distribution\n$q=(q_0,\\cdots,q_{d-1})$. The notion of mutual unbiasedness, however, is\npreserved by requiring that the extracted information is the same for any\npreparation and any measurement; regardless of which state from which basis is\nchosen to prepare the system, the outcomes of measuring the system with respect\nto the other basis generate the same probability distribution. In the light of\nthis, we define the notion of \\emph{mutually equi-biased bases} (MEBs) such\nthat within each basis the states are equi-biased with respect to the states of\nthe other basis and that the bases are mutually equi-biased with respect to\neach other. For $d=2,3$, we derive a complete set of $d+1$ MEBs. The mutual\nequi-biasedness imposes nontrivial constraints on the distribution $q$, leading\nfor $d=3$ to the restriction $1/3\\le\\mu \\le 1/2$ where\n$\\mu=\\sum_{k=0}^{2}q_k^2$. To capture the incompatibility of the measurements\nin MEBs, we derive an inequality for the probabilities of projective\nmeasurements in a qudit system, which yields an associated entropic uncertainty\ninequality. Finally, we construct a class of positive maps and their associated\nentanglement witnesses based on MEBs. While an entanglement witness constructed\nfrom MUBs is generally finer than one based on MEBs when both use the same\nnumber of bases, for certain values of the index $\\mu$, employing a larger set\nof MEBs can yield a finer witness. We illustrate this behavior using isotropic\nstates of a $3\\times 3$ system.",

However, building a unified\nspeech understanding and generation model still faces the following challenges:\n(1) Due to the huge modality gap between speech tokens and text tokens,\nextending text LLMs to unified speech LLMs relies on large-scale paired data\nfor fine-tuning, and (2) Generation and understanding tasks prefer information\nat different levels, e.g., generation benefits from detailed acoustic features,\nwhile understanding favors high-level semantics. This divergence leads to\ndifficult performance optimization in one unified model. To solve these\nchallenges, in this paper, we present two key insights in speech tokenization\nand speech language modeling. Specifically, we first propose an\nUnderstanding-driven Speech Tokenizer (USTokenizer), which extracts high-level\nsemantic information essential for accomplishing understanding tasks using text\nLLMs. In this way, USToken enjoys better modality commonality with text, which\nreduces the difficulty of modality alignment in adapting text LLMs to speech\nLLMs. Secondly, we present DualSpeechLM, a dual-token modeling framework that\nconcurrently models USToken as input and acoustic token as output within a\nunified, end-to-end framework, seamlessly integrating speech understanding and\ngeneration capabilities. Furthermore, we propose a novel semantic supervision\nloss and a Chain-of-Condition (CoC) strategy to stabilize model training and\nenhance speech generation performance. Experimental results demonstrate that\nour proposed approach effectively fosters a complementary relationship between\nunderstanding and generation tasks, highlighting the promising strategy of\nmutually enhancing both tasks in one unified model.",

We present the Semantic Units Framework, a\nnovel, domain-agnostic semantic modelling approach applied here to ecological\ndata and knowledge in compliance with the FAIR (Findable, Accessible,\nInteroperable, Reusable) and CLEAR (Cognitively interoperable, semantically\nLinked, contextually Explorable, easily Accessible, human-Readable and\n-interpretable) Principles. The framework models data and knowledge as modular,\nlogic-aware semantic units: single propositions (statement units) or coherent\ngroups of propositions (compound units). Statement units can model\nmeasurements, observations, or universal relationships, including causal ones,\nand link to methods and evidence. Compound units group related statement units\ninto reusable, semantically coherent knowledge objects. Implemented using RDF,\nOWL, and knowledge graphs, semantic units can be serialized as FAIR Digital\nObjects with persistent identifiers, provenance, and semantic interoperability.\nWe show how universal statement units build ecological causal networks, which\ncan be composed into causal maps and perspective-specific subnetworks. These\nsupport causal reasoning, confounder detection (back-door), effect\nidentification with unobserved confounders (front-door), application of\ndo-calculus, and alignment with Bayesian networks, structural equation models,\nand structural causal models. By linking fine-grained empirical data to\nhigh-level causal reasoning, the Semantic Units Framework provides a foundation\nfor ecological knowledge synthesis, evidence annotation, cross-domain\nintegration, reproducible workflows, and AI-ready ecological research.",

    "abstract": "Recently, we can observe a significant increase of the phishing attacks in\nthe Internet. In a typical phishing attack, the attacker sets up a malicious\nwebsite that looks similar to the legitimate website in order to obtain the\nend-users' information. This may cause the leakage of the sensitive information\nand the financial loss for the end-users. To avoid such attacks, the early\ndetection of these websites' URLs is vital and necessary. Previous researchers\nhave proposed many machine learning algorithms to distinguish the phishing URLs\nfrom the legitimate ones. In this paper, we would like to enhance these machine\nlearning algorithms from the perspective of feature selection. We propose a\nnovel method to incorporate the keyword features with the traditional features.\nThis method is applied on multiple traditional machine learning algorithms and\nthe experimental results have shown this method is useful and effective. On\naverage, this method can reduce the classification error by 30% for the large\ndataset. Moreover, its enhancement is more significant for the small dataset.\nIn addition, this method extracts the information from the URL and does not\nrely on the additional information provided by the third-part service. The best\nresult for the machine learning algorithm using our proposed method has\nachieved the accuracy of 99.68%.",

    "abstract": "The growing digitalization and the rapid adoption of high-powered\nInternet-of-Things (IoT)-enabled devices (e.g., EV charging stations) have\nincreased the vulnerability of power grids to cyber threats. In particular, the\nso-called Load Altering Attacks (LAAs) can trigger rapid frequency fluctuations\nand potentially destabilize the power grid. This paper aims to bridge the gap\nbetween academic research and practical application by using open-source\ndatasets released by grid operators. It investigates various LAA scenarios on a\nreal-world transmission network, namely the Great Britain (GB)-36 Zone model\nreleased by the UK's National Electricity System Operator (NESO). It evaluates\nthe threshold of LAA severity that the grid can tolerate before triggering\ncascading effects. Additionally, it explores how Battery Energy Storage Systems\n(BESS) based fast frequency response services can mitigate or prevent such\nimpacts. Simulations are conducted using DIgSILENT PowerFactory to ensure\nrealistic system representation. The analysis provides several useful insights\nto grid operators on the LAA impact, such as the influence of the relative\nlocations of BESS and LAA, as well as how delays in attack execution can\ninfluence the overall system response.",

In this case,\nconventional initiation approaches relying solely on a fixed-angle wedge may\nengender risks of initiation failure, which necessitates extra initiation\nassistance measures. In this study, ODW initiation over a finite wedge with\nlocal energy deposition is numerically investigated to assess the thermal\neffects of plasma-based initiation assistance techniques. Particular emphasis\nis put on the effects of forms and magnitudes of energy deposition on\ninitiation modes and flow field structures of ODWs. The results demonstrate\nthat on-wedge initiation of ODWs fails at a low Mach number without any energy\ndepositions. In contrast, both continuous and pulsatile local energy\ndepositions can effectively initiate ODWs, leading to sustainable detonation on\nthe finite wedge. As continuous energy deposition power or pulsatile single\npulse energy increases, several key detonation initiation modes emerge\nsequentially. Analysis of the spatiotemporal evolution of the primary wave\nstructures under single-pulse energy deposition reveals the minimum pulse\nrepetition frequency required for sustainable on-wedge detonation, which is\nsubsequently verified through multi-pulse energy deposition simulations.\nNevertheless, it is found that sustainable on-wedge detonation can be achieved\nby pulsatile energy deposition with an average power consumption of less than\n10% of that required for continuous energy deposition while maintaining a same\ninitiation length, suggesting that the pulsatile one is an efficient way of\nenergy deposition for initiation assistance of ODWs on finite wedges under\nextreme flight conditions.",

While head-rotation\nprediction algorithms could, in principle, reproduce this behavior, they\ntypically focus on visually salient stimuli and overlook the cognitive motives\nthat guide head rotation. This yields agents that look at conspicuous objects\nwhile overlooking obstacles or task-relevant cues, diminishing realism in a\nvirtual environment. We introduce SCORE, a Symbolic Cognitive Reasoning\nframework for Embodied Head Rotation, a data-agnostic framework that produces\ncontext-aware head movements without task-specific training or hand-tuned\nheuristics. A controlled VR study (N=20) identifies five motivational drivers\nof human head movements: Interest, Information Seeking, Safety, Social Schema,\nand Habit. SCORE encodes these drivers as symbolic predicates, perceives the\nscene with a Vision-Language Model (VLM), and plans head poses with a Large\nLanguage Model (LLM). The framework employs a hybrid workflow: the VLM-LLM\nreasoning is executed offline, after which a lightweight FastVLM performs\nonline validation to suppress hallucinations while maintaining responsiveness\nto scene dynamics. The result is an agent that predicts not only where to look\nbut also why, generalizing to unseen scenes and multi-agent crowds while\nretaining behavioral plausibility.",

    "abstract": "Light field display is one of the technologies providing 3D immersive\nvisualization. However, a light field display generates only a limited number\nof light rays which results in finite angular and spatial resolutions.\nTherefore, 3D content can be shown with high quality only within a narrow depth\nrange notated as Depth of Field (DoF) around the display screen. Outside this\nrange, due to the appearance of aliasing artifacts, the quality degrades\nproportionally to the distance from the screen. One solution to mitigate the\nartifacts is depth of field rendering which blurs the content in the distorted\nregions, but can result in the removal of scene details. This research focuses\non proposing a DoF Aware Scene Complexity (DASC) metric that characterizes 3D\ncontent based on geometrical and positional factors considering the light field\ndisplay's DoF. In this research, we also evaluate the observers' preference\nacross different level of blurriness caused by DoF rendering ranging from\nsharp, aliased scenes to overly smoothed alias-free scenes. We have conducted\nthis study over multiple scenes that we created to account for different types\nof content.

To solve these challenges, we propose LPGNet, a\nLightweight network with Parallel attention and Gated fusion for multimodal\nERC. The main part of LPGNet is the Lightweight Parallel Interaction Attention\n(LPIA) module. This module replaces traditional stacked Transformer layers with\nparallel dot-product attention, which can model both within-modality and\nbetween-modality relationships more efficiently. To improve emotional feature\nlearning, LPGNet also uses a dual-gated fusion method. This method filters and\ncombines features from different input types in a flexible and dynamic way. In\naddition, LPGNet removes speaker embeddings completely, which allows the model\nto work independently of speaker identity. Experiments on the IEMOCAP dataset\nshow that LPGNet reaches over 87% accuracy and F1-score in 4-class emotion\nclassification.

However, existing approaches manifest two critical\nlimitations in complex scenarios: (1) Over-reconstruction occurs when\npersistent large Gaussians cannot meet adaptive splitting thresholds during\ndensity control. This is exacerbated by conflicting gradient directions that\nprevent effective splitting of these Gaussians; (2) Over-densification of\nGaussians occurs in regions with aligned gradient aggregation, leading to\nredundant component proliferation. This redundancy significantly increases\nmemory overhead due to unnecessary data retention. We present\nGradient-Direction-Aware Gaussian Splatting (GDAGS), a gradient-direction-aware\nadaptive density control framework to address these challenges. Our key\ninnovations: the gradient coherence ratio (GCR), computed through normalized\ngradient vector norms, which explicitly discriminates Gaussians with concordant\nversus conflicting gradient directions; and a nonlinear dynamic weighting\nmechanism leverages the GCR to enable gradient-direction-aware density control.\nSpecifically, GDAGS prioritizes conflicting-gradient Gaussians during splitting\noperations to enhance geometric details while suppressing redundant\nconcordant-direction Gaussians. Conversely, in cloning processes, GDAGS\npromotes concordant-direction Gaussian densification for structural completion\nwhile preventing conflicting-direction Gaussian overpopulation.

    "abstract": "LiDAR-based Place Recognition (LPR) remains a critical task in Embodied\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) and Autonomous Driving, primarily addressing\nlocalization challenges in GPS-denied environments and supporting loop closure\ndetection. Existing approaches reduce place recognition to a Euclidean\ndistance-based metric learning task, neglecting the feature space's intrinsic\nstructures and intra-class variances. Such Euclidean-centric formulation\ninherently limits the model's capacity to capture nonlinear data distributions,\nleading to suboptimal performance in complex environments and temporal-varying\nscenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel cross-view network\nbased on an innovative fusion paradigm. Our framework introduces a\npseudo-global information guidance mechanism that coordinates multi-modal\nbranches to perform feature learning within a unified semantic space.\nConcurrently, we propose a Manifold Adaptation and Pairwise Variance-Locality\nLearning Metric that constructs a Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrix to\ncompute Mahalanobis distance, superseding traditional Euclidean distance\nmetrics. This geometric formulation enables the model to accurately\ncharacterize intrinsic data distributions and capture complex inter-class\ndependencies within the feature space. Experimental results demonstrate that\nthe proposed algorithm achieves competitive performance, particularly excelling\nin complex environmental conditions.",

    "abstract": "Over the past decade, the demand for communication devices has increased\namong individuals with mobility and speech impairments. Eye-gaze tracking has\nemerged as a promising solution for hands-free communication; however,\ntraditional appearance-based interfaces often face challenges such as accuracy\nissues, involuntary eye movements, and difficulties with extensive command\nsets. This work presents a multimodal appearance-based gaze-controlled virtual\nkeyboard that utilises deep learning in conjunction with standard camera\nhardware, incorporating both synchronous and asynchronous modes for command\nselection. The virtual keyboard application supports menu-based selection with\nnine commands, enabling users to spell and type up to 56 English characters,\nincluding uppercase and lowercase letters, punctuation, and a delete function\nfor corrections. The proposed system was evaluated with twenty able-bodied\nparticipants who completed specially designed typing tasks using three input\nmodalities: (i) a mouse, (ii) an eye-tracker, and (iii) an unmodified webcam.\nTyping performance was measured in terms of speed and information transfer rate\n(ITR) at both command and letter levels. Average typing speeds were 18.3+-5.31\nletters/min (mouse), 12.60+-2.99letters/min (eye-tracker, synchronous), 10.94\n+- 1.89 letters/min (webcam, synchronous), 11.15 +- 2.90 letters/min\n(eye-tracker, asynchronous), and 7.86 +- 1.69 letters/min (webcam,\nasynchronous). ITRs were approximately 80.29 +- 15.72 bits/min (command level)\nand 63.56 +- 11 bits/min (letter level) with webcam in synchronous mode. The\nsystem demonstrated good usability and low workload with webcam input,\nhighlighting its user-centred design and promise as an accessible communication\ntool in low-resource settings.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the barren plateau (BP) phenomenon in variational quantum\nalgorithms using a statistical approach. Using Gaussian function models, we\nidentify three distinct types of BPs. The first type, which we called\nlocalized-dip BPs, occurs in landscapes that are mostly flat but contain a dip\npoint where the gradient is large in a small region around the minimum. The\nsecond type, called localized-gorge BPs, which are somewhat similar to the\nlocalized-dip BPs but contain a gorge line. The third type, called\neverywhere-flat BPs, appears when the entire landscape is uniformly flat with\nalmost vanishing gradients, making optimization significantly more difficult.\nAfter illustrating these behaviors in the Gaussian function models, we extend\nthe analysis to the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). We consider two\ntypes of ans\\\"atze: the hardware-efficient ansatz and the random Pauli ansatz.\nFor both ans\\\"atze, we only observe the everywhere-flat BPs. Using our\nstatistical approach, we searched for localized-dip and localized-gorge BPs but\nfound no evidence of such features in the examples studied, suggesting that\neverywhere-flat BPs dominate in these ans\\\"atze. Our method effectively probes\nlandscape features by capturing the gradient scaling across parameter space,\nmaking it a useful tool for diagnosing BPs in variational algorithms. To\nmitigate BPs in the VQE, we employ a genetic algorithm (GA) to optimize the\nrandom gates generated in the ans\\\"atze, thereby reshaping the cost function\nlandscape to enhance the optimization efficiency. A comparison with an\nunoptimized ansatz shows how the ansatz design can improve the scalability and\nreliability of variational quantum algorithms.",

It resolves the fundamental\nstructural incompatibility between standard positivity-preserving limiters and\nglobal DF enforcement in the central discontinuous Galerkin (CDG) framework.\nThe method integrates a novel positivity-limiting strategy, a modified\ndissipation mechanism guided by convex decomposition, and an auxiliary\nevolution equation for the magnetic field, which are designed based on rigorous\ntheoretical analysis. Notably, we provide a rigorous proof of positivity\npreservation for the updated cell averages under an explicit CFL-type\ncondition. The proof leverages the geometric quasi-linearization (GQL)\ntechnique, which reformulates the nonlinear positivity constraint into an\nequivalent linear form. This enables the derivation of flux-based inequalities\nand technical estimates under the global DF constraint. To suppress nonphysical\noscillations near shocks, we develop a compact, non-intrusive\nconvex-oscillation-suppressing (COS) procedure based on the entropy function.\nThe COS process acts only on non-magnetic variables, avoids costly\ncharacteristic decomposition, and maintains both the globally DF property and\nhigh-order accuracy. Several challenging experiments -- including low\nplasma-beta MHD jets with Mach numbers up to 1,000,000 -- demonstrate the\nproposed method robustness, high-order accuracy, non-oscillatory behavior, and\nits ability to preserve both positivity and globally DF structures under\nextreme conditions.",

To address this, we construct attention\nnetworks from time-series data for the United States and China, each a key\neconomic power in the West and the East, respectively. We reveal a strong\nmacroscale correlation between urban attention and Gross Domestic Product\n(GDP). At the mesoscale, community detection of attention networks shows that\nhigh-GDP cities consistently act as core nodes within their communities and\noccupy strategic geographic positions. At the microscale, structural hole\ntheory identifies these cities as key connectors between communities, with\ninfluence proportional to economic output. Overlapping community detection\nfurther reveals tightly connected urban clusters, prompting us to introduce\ngeographic and topic-based metrics, which show that closely linked cities are\nspatially proximate and topically coherent. Of course, not all patterns were\nconsistent across regions. A notable distinction emerged in the relationship\nbetween population size and urban attention, which was evident in the United\nStates but absent in China. Building on these insights, we integrate key\nvariables reflecting GDP, geography, and scenic resources into regression model\nto cross-verify the influence of economic and geographic factors on collective\nuser attention, and unexpectedly discover that a composite index of population,\naccess, and scenery fails to account for cross-city variations in attention.\nOur study bridges the gap between economic prosperity and geographic centrality\nin shaping urban attention landscapes.",

Unlike InfiniBand, the\nlast major standardization effort in high-performance networking over two\ndecades ago, UE leverages the expansive Ethernet ecosystem and the 1,000x gains\nin computational efficiency per moved bit to deliver a new era of\nhigh-performance networking.",

Using a twisted gold nanorod dimer and tightly focused\ncircularly polarized optical vortex beams carrying spin and orbital angular\nmomenta of the same sign, we measure spectrally and spatially resolved chiral\ndichroism signals that persist even where spin optical chirality vanishes,\nrevealing a quadrupole-mediated chiral interaction driven by OAM.

By re-examining the outputs of autoregressive models, we observed\nthat some segments exhibit parallelizable structures, which we term intrinsic\nparallelism. Decoding each parallelizable branch simultaneously (i.e. parallel\ndecoding) can significantly improve the overall inference speed of LLMs. In\nthis paper, we propose an Adaptive Serial-Parallel Decoding (ASPD), which\naddresses two core challenges: automated construction of parallelizable data\nand efficient parallel decoding mechanism.

To empower efficient\nadaptive serial-parallel decoding, we implement a Hybrid Decoding Engine which\nenables seamless transitions between serial and parallel decoding modes while\nmaintaining a reusable KV cache, maximizing computational efficiency.

    "abstract": "One of the fastest-growing domains in AI is healthcare. Given its importance,\nit has been the interest of many researchers to deploy ML models into the\never-demanding healthcare domain to aid doctors and increase accessibility.\nDelivering reliable models, however, demands a sizable amount of data, and the\nrecent COVID-19 pandemic served as a reminder of the rampant and scary nature\nof healthcare that makes training models difficult. To alleviate such scarcity,\nmany published works attempted to synthesize radiological cough data to train\nbetter COVID-19 detection models on the respective radiological data. To\naccommodate the time sensitivity expected during a pandemic, this work focuses\non detecting COVID-19 through coughs using synthetic data to improve the\naccuracy of the classifier. The work begins by training a CNN on a balanced\nsubset of the Coughvid dataset, establishing a baseline classification test\naccuracy of 72%. The paper demonstrates how an Auxiliary Classification GAN\n(ACGAN) may be trained to conditionally generate novel synthetic Mel\nSpectrograms of both healthy and COVID-19 coughs. These coughs are used to\naugment the training dataset of the CNN classifier, allowing it to reach a new\ntest accuracy of 75%. The work highlights the expected messiness and\ninconsistency in training and offers insights into detecting and handling such\nshortcomings.",

Unlike previous\nmethods that struggle with speaker variability or long gap lengths, PGDI can\naccurately reconstruct gaps of up to one second in length while preserving\nspeaker identity, prosody, and environmental factors such as reverberation.\nCentral to this approach is classifier guidance, specifically phoneme-level\nguidance, which substantially improves reconstruction fidelity. PGDI operates\nin a speaker-independent manner and maintains robustness even when long\nsegments are completely masked by strong transient noise, making it well-suited\nfor real-world applications, such as fireworks, door slams, hammer strikes, and\nconstruction noise. Through extensive experiments across diverse speakers and\ngap lengths, we demonstrate PGDI's superior inpainting performance and its\nability to handle challenging acoustic conditions. We consider both scenarios,\nwith and without access to the transcript during inference, showing that while\nthe availability of text further enhances performance, the model remains\neffective even in its absence.

    "abstract": "Functions of bound Kerr geodesic motion play a central role in many\ncalculations in relativistic astrophysics, ranging from gravitational-wave\ngeneration to self-force and radiation-reaction modeling. Although these\nfunctions can be expressed as a Fourier series using the geodesic fundamental\nfrequencies, reconstructing them in coordinate time is challenging due to the\ncoupling of the radial and polar motions. In this paper, we compare two\nstrategies for performing such reconstructions and their ability to estimate\nhigh-order coordinate-time derivatives of the orbital functional. The first\nmethod maps Fourier coefficients from Mino to coordinate time; the second\nmethod fits a sampled time series of the function to a truncated\ncoordinate-time Fourier series. While the latter method is prone to\noverfitting, it yields more accurate reconstructions and derivatives than the\nmapping, but completely misrepresents the harmonic content of the orbital\nfunctional. For the purpose of accurate coordinate-time derivative estimation,\nwe propose a hybrid method: fit for the Mino-time coefficients, differentiate\nwith respect to Mino time, then convert to coordinate time. Applied to the mass\nquadrupole of a generic Kerr geodesic, this hybrid method recovers the sixth\nderivative with a fractional residual $\\sim10^{-6}$ using only two harmonics.\nFor orbital functionals that depend explicitly on the geodesic orbit expressed\nin Boyer--Lindquist coordinates, we also provide a recursive procedure for\ncomputing coordinate-time derivatives using exact analytic expressions. These\nresults offer a general framework for accurately evaluating high-order time\nderivatives along Kerr geodesic worldlines, with direct relevance to\napplications such as extreme-mass-ratio inspiral kludge waveform modeling,\nwhere such derivatives are key ingredients for precise gravitational-wave\npredictions.",

    "abstract": "The growing deployment of large language models (LLMs) across diverse\ncultural contexts necessitates a better understanding of how the\novergeneralization of less documented cultures within LLMs' representations\nimpacts their cultural understanding. Prior work only performs extrinsic\nevaluation of LLMs' cultural competence, without accounting for how LLMs'\ninternal mechanisms lead to cultural (mis)representation. To bridge this gap,\nwe propose Culturescope, the first mechanistic interpretability-based method\nthat probes the internal representations of LLMs to elicit the underlying\ncultural knowledge space. CultureScope utilizes a patching method to extract\nthe cultural knowledge. We introduce a cultural flattening score as a measure\nof the intrinsic cultural biases. Additionally, we study how LLMs internalize\nWestern-dominance bias and cultural flattening, which allows us to trace how\ncultural biases emerge within LLMs. Our experimental results reveal that LLMs\nencode Western-dominance bias and cultural flattening in their cultural\nknowledge space. We find that low-resource cultures are less susceptible to\ncultural biases, likely due to their limited training resources. Our work\nprovides a foundation for future research on mitigating cultural biases and\nenhancing LLMs' cultural understanding. Our codes and data used for experiments\nare publicly available.",

We focus on the Kretschmann, Ricci, and Weyl curvature scalars,\nanalyzing their dependence on baryon density and radial coordinate for varying\nvalues of $\\alpha$. Our results indicate that EMSG can significantly alter the\ncurvature profiles of neutron stars. In particular, the magnitude of both Weyl\nand Kretschmann scalars increases (decreases) for a positive (negative) EMSG\nparameter, with the former exhibiting a larger dependence. Similarly, the\nsurface curvature (SC) is notably affected by $\\alpha$. Interestingly, we\nfurther observe distinct discontinuities in the curvature profiles at\nhadron-quark phase transitions, especially in the soft and intermediate HQPT\nmodels. These signatures may provide observable imprints of exotic core phases\nin neutron stars.",

The critical point of the superradiant phase\ntransition in the infinite-size Dicke-Stark model was analytically derived\nusing the mean-field approach and confirmed with numerical calculation. Under\nthermal equilibrium conditions, analyses of the negativity, zero-time-delay\ntwo-photon correlation function, and atom-spin squeezing parameters in the\nfinite-size Dicke-Stark model reveal that as the coupling strength increases,\nthe light field undergoes a transition from photon bunching to anti-bunching\nand then back to bunching. The Stark field can modulate both the maximum and\nminimum values of the two-photon correlation function and their corresponding\ncoupling strengths. At low temperatures, the system exhibits entanglement and\nspin squeezing. As temperature rises, entanglement gradually diminishes, while\nstrong coupling facilitates the preservation of entanglement in the system\nstate. Atom-spin squeezing spin squeezing is highly sensitive to temperature\nand vanishes rapidly with increasing temperature.

A cutset $S$ of $G$ is defined to be\nthe set of vertices in $G$ whose removal disconnects the graph. An $R_g$ cutset\nof $G$ is a cutset whose removal disconnects the graph in such a way that each\nconnected component has at least $g+1$ vertices.

    "abstract": "We use cosmological hydrodynamic simulations (IllustrisTNG and SIMBA) to\nexplore the redshift, luminosity, and black hole mass dependence of the quasar\nhalo occupation distribution (HOD). In both simulations, we find that the\nquasar activity is quenched at a characteristic halo mass ($\\sim 10^{13}\nM_{\\odot}$) scale affecting the nature of its occupation distribution function.\nWe note that the quenching is more pronounced at low redshifts for quasars\nselected through a luminosity threshold. We show that a very significant bias\n(a factor of $\\sim 10-50$ in the central occupation and $\\sim 10-70\\%$ in the\nsatellite occupation fraction) is introduced in the reconstruction of quasar\nhost halo mass distributions from the observed two-point-correlation function,\nif the HOD modeling does not account for the quenching effect in the central\noccupation function. While there is strong suppression of the occupation\nfraction of central quasars, the satellite occupation still follows a power-law\nlike behavior. Our results show that the global satellite fraction of quasars\nincreases monotonically from high to low redshifts, with $20-40 \\%$ of the\nquasars being satellite at intermediate redshifts, consistent with previous\nclustering based estimates. In addition, our study reveals that while the\noccupation function of quasars depends on redshift, luminosity, and feedback\nmodes, there is hardly any evolution in the supermassive black hole (SMBH;\nmass-selected sample) occupation. The SMBH HOD over the entire parameter space\nis well-modeled by a power-law and a step function similar to what has been\nfound for galaxies and low-luminosity active galactic nuclei.",

Data from Scopus covers articles\npublished before (2020-2021) and after (2022-2023) the war's onset. Statistical\nanalysis revealed a small but significant correlation between APC amounts and\ncitation impact, though the effect size was minimal, suggesting higher APCs did\nnot substantially boost citations. APC waivers offered by major publishers such\nas Springer and Elsevier since 2022 have led to only a slight increase in\narticles authored solely by Ukrainian scholars in their journals. Despite these\nwaivers, MDPI and Aluna Publishing House maintained the largest shares of such\npublications, likely due to low rejection rates, fast publication, and - in\nAluna's case - reduced APCs for Ukrainian authors. Between 2020 and 2023, the\nnumber of articles authored solely by Ukrainian scholars in foreign journals\nfell by 25.7%, and total APC spending declined by 24.6%, from EUR 1.24 million\nto EUR 0.93 million.

Ensuring\ngenuine equity in scholarly communication requires alternative publishing\nmodels beyond APC-based Gold OA, guaranteeing equal opportunities to publish\nregardless of institutional or national affiliation.

    "abstract": "This study examines how scale economies in the operation of shared autonomous\nvehicles (SAVs) affect the efficiency of a transportation system where SAVs\ncoexist with normal vehicles (NVs). We develop a bottleneck model where\ncommuters choose their departure times and mode of travel between SAVs and NVs,\nand analyze equilibria under three SAV-fare scenarios: marginal-cost pricing,\naverage-cost pricing, and unregulated monopoly pricing. Marginal-cost pricing\nreduces commuting costs but results in financial deficits for the service\nprovider. Average-cost pricing ensures financial sustainability but has\ncontrasting effects depending on the timing of implementation due to the\nexistence of multiple equilibria: when implemented too early, it discourages\nadoption of SAVs and increases commuting costs; when introduced after SAV\nadoption reaches the monopoly equilibrium level, it promotes high adoption and\nachieves substantial cost reductions without a deficit. We also show that\nexpanding road capacity may increase commuting costs under average-cost\npricing, demonstrating the Downs--Thomson paradox in transportation systems\nwith SAVs. We next examine two optimal policies that improve social cost,\nincluding the operator's profit: the first-best policy that combines\nmarginal-cost pricing with congestion tolls, and the second-best policy that\nrelies on fare regulation alone. Our analysis shows that these policies can\nlimit excessive adoption by discouraging overuse of SAVs. This suggests that\npromoting SAV adoption does not always lower social cost.",

    "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) generates vast amounts of heterogeneous data,\nranging from sensor readings to log alerts and images, that pose challenges to\nstorage and data transmission in resource-constrained environments. In this\ncontext, lossless data compression techniques, like Arithmetic Coding, offer an\neffective solution owing to their high compression ratio. However, the standard\nArithmetic Coding technique is computationally intensive, leading to high\nmemory and processing overhead. This paper proposes an optimized version of\nArithmetic coding for the IoT environment that incorporates three improvements\nusing Iterative and Iteration Optimizations for minimizing redundant\ncomputations and achieving faster convergence; Principal Component\nAnalysis(PCA) for dimensionality reduction and identifying key features; and\nlastly, Cardinality reduction for grouping similar probabilities to improve the\ncompression efficiency. The proposed method was evaluated on a dataset of\nimages and demonstrated significant reductions in the time to compress, CPU\nutilization, and memory consumption, and preserves data integrity as seen\nthrough the low RMSE values. The optimized version of the Arithmetic Coding\nalgorithm achieves an impressive compression ratio of 814:1 and 101 ms to\ncompress a single image. This makes the optimized algorithm suitable for\nreal-time applications and resource-constrained environments for efficient data\ntransmission and storage.",

    "abstract": "Additive manufacturing (AM; 3D Printing), a process which creates a part\nlayer-by-layer, has the potential to improve upon conventional lightweight\nmirror manufacturing techniques, including subtractive (milling), formative\n(casting) and fabricative (bonding) manufacturing. Increased mass reduction\nwhilst maintaining mechanical performance can be achieved through the creation\nof intricate lattice geometries, which are impossible to manufacture\nconventionally. Further, part consolidation can be introduced to reduce the\nnumber of interfaces and thereby points of failure. AM design optimisation\nusing computational tools has been extensively covered in existing literature.\nHowever, additional research, specifically evaluation of the optical surface,\nis required to qualify these results before these advantages can be realised.\nThis paper outlines the development & metrology of an AM mirror for a CubeSat\nplatform with a targeted mass reduction of 60% compared to an equivalent solid\nbody. This project aims to incorporate recent developments in AM mirror design,\nwith a focus on manufacture, testing & evaluation. This is achieved through a\nsimplified design process of a Cassegrain telescope primary mirror mounted\nwithin a 3U CubeSat chassis. The mirror geometry is annular with an external\ndiameter of 84 mm and an internal diameter of 32 mm; the optical prescription\nis flat for ease of manufacture. Prototypes were printed in AlSi10Mg, a\nlow-cost aluminium alloy commonly used in metal additive manufacturing. They\nwere then machined and single-point diamond turned to achieve a reflective\nsurface. Both quantitative & qualitative evaluations of the optical surface\nwere conducted to assess the effect of hot isostatic pressing (HIP) on the\noptical surface quality. The results indicated that HIP reduced surface\nporosity; however, it also increased surface roughness and, consequently,\noptical scatter.",

While most prior works\nfocus on opinion evolution surrounding specific isolated events or the views\nwithin a country, ours is the first to model the large-scale attitude evolution\nof a population representing an entire country towards another -- US citizens'\nperspectives towards China. To tackle the challenges of this broad scenario, we\npropose a framework that integrates media data collection, user profile\ncreation, and cognitive architecture for opinion updates to successfully\nreproduce the real trend of US attitudes towards China over a 20-year period\nfrom 2005 to today.

The simulation results, beyond\nvalidating our framework architecture, also reveal the impact of biased framing\nand selection bias in shaping attitudes. Overall, our work contributes to a new\nparadigm for LLM-based modeling of cognitive behaviors in a large-scale,\nlong-term, cross-border social context, providing insights into the formation\nof international biases and offering valuable implications for media consumers\nto better understand the factors shaping their perspectives, and ultimately\ncontributing to the larger social need for bias reduction and cross-cultural\ntolerance.",

To simultaneously address these issues, we\npropose EditMF, a training-free fingerprinting paradigm that achieves highly\nimperceptible fingerprint embedding with minimal computational overhead.\nOwnership bits are mapped to compact, semantically coherent triples drawn from\nan encrypted artificial knowledge base (e.g., virtual author-novel-protagonist\nfacts). Causal tracing localizes the minimal set of layers influencing each\ntriple, and a zero-space update injects the fingerprint without perturbing\nunrelated knowledge. Verification requires only a single black-box query and\nsucceeds when the model returns the exact pre-embedded protagonist. Empirical\nresults on LLaMA and Qwen families show that EditMF combines high\nimperceptibility with negligible model's performance loss, while delivering\nrobustness far beyond LoRA-based fingerprinting and approaching that of SFT\nembeddings.

As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly common, AI's\nability to recognize and respond to human emotions is crucial for effective\nhuman-AI interactions.

However, the emotional intelligence of AI,\nparticularly multimodal large language models (MLLMs), remains largely\nunexplored. This study evaluates the emotion recognition abilities of MLLMs\nusing the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) and its multiracial\ncounterpart (MRMET), and compares their performance against human participants.\nResults show that, on average, MLLMs outperform humans in accurately\nidentifying emotions across both tests.

Moreover, a collaborative\napproach (augmented intelligence) that combines human and MLLM predictions\nachieves greater accuracy than either humans or MLLMs alone.

However, conventional Transformer models\nare often hindered by their large number of parameters and their limited\nability to capture non-stationary features in data through smoothing.\nSimilarly, MLP models struggle to manage multi-channel dependencies\neffectively. To address these limitations, we propose a novel, lightweight time\nseries prediction model, WaveTS-B. This model combines wavelet transforms with\nMLP to capture both periodic and non-stationary characteristics of data in the\nwavelet domain. Building on this foundation, we propose a channel clustering\nstrategy that incorporates a Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework, utilizing a\ngating mechanism and expert network to handle multi-channel dependencies\nefficiently. We propose WaveTS-M, an advanced model tailored for multi-channel\ntime series prediction. Empirical evaluation across eight real-world time\nseries datasets demonstrates that our WaveTS series models achieve\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with significantly fewer parameters.\nNotably, WaveTS-M shows substantial improvements on multi-channel datasets,\nhighlighting its effectiveness.",

    "abstract": "This work presents a novel framework for No-Reference Image Quality\nAssessment (NR-IQA) founded on the analysis of directional image curvature.\nWithin this framework, we define a measure of Anisotropic Texture Richness\n(ATR), which is computed at the pixel level using two tunable thresholds -- one\npermissive and one restrictive -- that quantify orthogonal texture suppression.\nWhen its parameters are optimized for a specific artifact, the resulting ATR\nscore serves as a high-performance quality metric, achieving Spearman\ncorrelations with human perception of approximately -0.93 for Gaussian blur and\n-0.95 for white noise on the LIVE dataset. The primary contribution is a\ntwo-stage system that leverages the differential response of ATR to various\ndistortions. First, the system utilizes the signature from two specialist ATR\nconfigurations to classify the primary artifact type (blur vs. noise) with over\n97% accuracy. Second, following classification, it employs a dedicated\nregression model mapping the relevant ATR score to a quality rating to quantify\nthe degradation. On a combined dataset, the complete system predicts human\nscores with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.892 and a Root Mean Square\nError (RMSE) of 5.17 DMOS points. This error corresponds to just 7.4% of the\ndataset's total quality range, demonstrating high predictive accuracy. This\nestablishes our framework as a robust, dual-purpose tool for the classification\nand subsequent quantification of image degradation.",

In-memory computing\narchitectures are proposed to avoid the Von Neumann bottleneck. However, both\ndigital/binary-based and analogue in-memory computing architectures suffer from\nvarious limitations, which significantly degrade the performance and energy\nefficiency gains. This work proposes OISMA, a novel in-memory computing\narchitecture that utilizes the computational simplicity of a quasi-stochastic\ncomputing domain (Bent-Pyramid system), while keeping the same efficiency,\nscalability, and productivity of digital memories. OISMA converts normal memory\nread operations into in-situ stochastic multiplication operations with a\nnegligible cost. An accumulation periphery then accumulates the output\nmultiplication bitstreams, achieving the matrix multiplication functionality.\nExtensive matrix multiplication benchmarking was conducted to analyze the\naccuracy of the Bent-Pyramid system, using matrix dimensions ranging from 4x4\nto 512x512. The accuracy results show a significant decrease in the average\nrelative Frobenius error, from 9.42% (for 4x4) to 1.81% (for 512x512), compared\nto 64-bit double precision floating-point format. A 1T1R OISMA array of 4 KB\ncapacity was implemented using a commercial 180nm technology node and in-house\nRRAM technology. At 50 MHz, OISMA achieves 0.891 TOPS/W and 3.98 GOPS/mm2 for\nenergy and area efficiency, respectively, occupying an effective computing area\nof 0.804241 mm2. Scaling OISMA from 180nm to 22nm technology shows a\nsignificant improvement of two orders of magnitude in energy efficiency and one\norder of magnitude in area efficiency, compared to dense matrix multiplication\nin-memory computing architectures.",

    "abstract": "We propose a universal physical mechanism for the emergence of 1/f\nfluctuations, observed across a wide range of systems. In particular, we verify\nthis on acoustic cases. The mechanism is based on amplitude modulation (AM) and\ndemodulation (DM), where the 1/f spectral law arises not in the raw waveform\nbut in its demodulated amplitude envelope. Two distinct yet complementary\nprocesses generate the required AM: (i) stochastic synchronization among\noscillators, modeled via an extended Kuramoto framework that captures perpetual\nsynchronization-desynchronization cycles, and (ii) frequency-selective\nresonance, modeled by spectral accumulation of eigenmodes in acoustic or\nstructural environments. Numerical simulations demonstrate that both\nmechanisms, acting separately or in combination, robustly produce 1/f spectra\nover several decades when DM is applied, and that the classical Kuramoto\ncritical point is not necessary for their emergence. We demonstrate the\ncross-domain relevance of this AM/DM framework through analyses of musical\nperformances, seismic records, and astrophysical time series, revealing a\ncommon underlying structure.

    "abstract": "In this paper, the evaporation of neighbouring multi-component droplets or\nrivulets - often found in applications such as inkjet printing, spray cooling,\nand pesticide delivery - is studied numerically and theoretically. The\nproximity induces a shielding effect that reduces individual evaporation rates\nand disrupts the symmetry of both the concentration profile and the flow field\nin the liquids. We examine how the symmetry of flow and concentration fields is\naffected by key parameters, namely the contact angle, the inter-droplet (or\ninter-rivulet) distance, and the magnitude of surface tension gradient forces\n(i.e. the Marangoni number). We focus on binary mixtures, such as water and\n1,2-hexanediol, where only one component evaporates and evaporation is slow,\nthereby allowing simplifications to the governing equations. To manage the\ncomplexity of the full three-dimensional droplet problem, we begin with a\ntwo-dimensional model of neighbouring rivulets. Solving the complete transient\nequations for rivulets with pinned contact lines and fixed inter-rivulet\ndistance reveals that the asymmetry - quantified by the position of the\ninterfacial stagnation point of the flow - diminishes over time. Using a\nvalidated quasi-stationary model, we find, with increasing contact angle and\ninter-rivulet distance, that the stagnation point migrates closer to the\ncentre, yet it remains unaffected by the Marangoni number. A simplified\nlubrication model applied to droplets shows similar dependencies on contact\nangle and distance, although here the stagnation point appears to vary with the\nMarangoni number. We attribute this dependence to the additional azimuthal flow\nin droplets, leading to a non-linear evolution of the concentration and\ntherefore a non-trivial dependence of the symmetry on the Marangoni number.",

However, their regional-scale influence on hillslope\nprocesses remains poorly understood due to limited observational coverage and\nthe masking effects of long-wavelength post-seismic signals. This knowledge gap\nconstrains our ability to assess post-seismic landslide hazards, particularly\nsince actively deforming hillslopes may evolve into rapid failures, especially\nunder the influence of meteorological factors following a major earthquake.\nThis study addresses this gap by analyzing slope instability across\napproximately 66,800sq.km of southeastern T\\\"urkiye in the aftermath of the\nFebruary 6, 2023, Kahramanmara\\c{s} earthquake sequence. We used Sentinel-1\nInSAR time series spanning three years before and one year after the\nearthquakes and applied a convolution-based filtering method to isolate\nlocalized surface deformation from broader tectonic signals. Given the\nchallenge of validating deformation anomalies at a regional scale without\nin-situ measurements, we cross-checked these locations using high-resolution\noptical imagery and assigned confidence levels based on observable surface\nfeatures indicative of slow-moving landslides. The resulting inventories were\nfurther enriched by expert-based assessments. Our results show that the total\narea affected by slow-moving landslides increased from 12.36sq.km to\n159.38sq.km, reflecting a more than 12-fold rise. While a substantial number of\nslopes were newly activated (348), others became stabilized (28) or shifted to\ndifferent deformation states (20). These findings highlight the complex\nresponse of hillslopes to seismic forcing and emphasize the importance of\nlong-term monitoring to capture the full spectrum of earthquake-induced\nlandslide behavior.",

    "abstract": "Semantic segmentation is fundamental to vision systems requiring pixel-level\nscene understanding, yet deploying it on resource-constrained devices demands\nefficient architectures. Although existing methods achieve real-time inference\nthrough lightweight designs, we reveal their inherent limitation: misalignment\nbetween class representations and image features caused by a per-pixel\nclassification paradigm. With experimental analysis, we find that this paradigm\nresults in a highly challenging assumption for efficient scenarios: Image pixel\nfeatures should not vary for the same category in different images. To address\nthis dilemma, we propose a coupled dual-branch offset learning paradigm that\nexplicitly learns feature and class offsets to dynamically refine both class\nrepresentations and spatial image features. Based on the proposed paradigm, we\nconstruct an efficient semantic segmentation network, OffSeg. Notably, the\noffset learning paradigm can be adopted to existing methods with no additional\narchitectural changes. Extensive experiments on four datasets, including\nADE20K, Cityscapes, COCO-Stuff-164K, and Pascal Context, demonstrate consistent\nimprovements with negligible parameters. For instance, on the ADE20K dataset,\nour proposed offset learning paradigm improves SegFormer-B0, SegNeXt-T, and\nMask2Former-Tiny by 2.7%, 1.9%, and 2.6% mIoU, respectively, with only 0.1-0.2M\nadditional parameters required.",

    "abstract": "Face aging or de-aging with generative AI has gained significant attention\nfor its applications in such fields like forensics, security, and media.\nHowever, most state of the art methods rely on conditional Generative\nAdversarial Networks (GANs), Diffusion-based models, or Visual Language Models\n(VLMs) to age or de-age faces based on predefined age categories and\nconditioning via loss functions, fine-tuning, or text prompts. The reliance on\nsuch conditioning leads to complex training requirements, increased data needs,\nand challenges in generating consistent results. Additionally, identity\npreservation is rarely taken into accountor evaluated on a single face\nrecognition system without any control or guarantees on whether identity would\nbe preserved in a generated aged/de-aged face. In this paper, we propose to\nsynthesize aged and de-aged faces via editing latent space of StyleGAN2 using a\nsimple support vector modeling of aging/de-aging direction and several feature\nselection approaches. By using two state-of-the-art face recognition systems,\nwe empirically find the identity preserving subspace within the StyleGAN2\nlatent space, so that an apparent age of a given face can changed while\npreserving the identity. We then propose a simple yet practical formula for\nestimating the limits on aging/de-aging parameters that ensures identity\npreservation for a given input face. Using our method and estimated parameters\nwe have generated a public dataset of synthetic faces at different ages that\ncan be used for benchmarking cross-age face recognition, age assurance systems,\nor systems for detection of synthetic images.

    "abstract": "An attributed hypergraph comprises nodes with attributes and hyperedges that\nconnect varying numbers of nodes. Attributed hypergraph node and hyperedge\nembedding (AHNEE) maps nodes and hyperedges to compact vectors for use in\nimportant tasks such as node classification, hyperedge link prediction, and\nhyperedge classification. Generating high-quality embeddings is challenging due\nto the complexity of attributed hypergraphs and the need to embed both nodes\nand hyperedges, especially in large-scale data. Existing solutions often fall\nshort by focusing only on nodes or lacking native support for attributed\nhypergraphs, leading to inferior quality, and struggle with scalability on\nlarge attributed hypergraphs.\n  We propose SAHE, an efficient and effective approach that unifies node and\nhyperedge embeddings for AHNEE computation, advancing the state of the art via\ncomprehensive embedding formulations and algorithmic designs. First, we\nintroduce two higher-order similarity measures, HMS-N and HMS-E, to capture\nsimilarities between node pairs and hyperedge pairs, respectively. These\nmeasures consider multi-hop connections and global topology within an extended\nhypergraph that incorporates attribute-based hyperedges. SAHE formulates the\nAHNEE objective to jointly preserve all-pair HMS-N and HMS-N similarities.\nDirect optimization is computationally expensive, so we analyze and unify core\napproximations of all-pair HMS-N and HMS-N to solve them simultaneously. To\nenhance efficiency, we design several non-trivial optimizations that avoid\niteratively materializing large dense matrices while maintaining high-quality\nresults. Extensive experiments on diverse attributed hypergraphs and 3\ndownstream tasks, compared against 11 baselines, show that SAHE consistently\noutperforms existing methods in embedding quality and is up to orders of\nmagnitude faster.",

By studying chemical insertion of solid,\nliquid and gaseous Na at low and high temperatures (LT, HT) as well as using\nelectrochemical insertion at 25 degree Celsius into uncoated and coated HOPG,\nit became clear that insertion equilibrium requires HT. On decreasing chemical\nintercalation temperature from HT (500 degree Celsius) to LT (25 degree\nCelsius), thermodynamic control was found to change to diffusion control and\nfinally to interfacial control. For the electrochemical insertion, coating\n(TiO2) proved advisable (to avoid co-intercalation) and efficient in reducing\nthe interfacial resistance. Measured saturation values were found to be not\nhigher than about 1 mol %. Towards room temperature higher equilibrium values\ncannot be excluded but would in view of the very low driving force kinetically\nbe very difficult to reach. The reversible cell voltage of the saturated\ncomposition (versus alkali metal) is distinctly lower than for the analogous\ncells using lithium (Li) or potassium (K). Detailed transmission electron\nmicroscopy (TEM) studies reveal the unexpected fact that at HT Na predominantly\nenters HOPG in the form of two-sided intercalation sandwiching carbon layers\n(bilayers), while at LT more highly aggregated layers appear to a comparable\ndegree, accompanied with the formation of higher-dimensional crystal\nimperfections. The reasons for this peculiar feature and the non-monotonic\nthermodynamics in the sequence Li-Na-K-Rb-Cs are discussed not only from an\nenergetic but also from an entropic point of view.",

On\nthe other hand it has been shown that Steady State Free Precession (SSFP)\nexperiments which depart from this scheme can, under certain conditions, endow\n13C and 15N small molecule NMR with comparable sensitivity and resolution. SSFP\nis one of the earliest and most widely used NMR pulse sequences, yet its\nanalyses have focused on isolated spin-half ensembles such as water. The\npresent study demonstrates that significant deviations from such isolated\nspin-half behavior may occur when SSFP is applied in the presence of spin-spin\ncouplings. Even in the simplest case supporting such couplings, a single 13C J\ncoupled to a 1H, departures from the isolated spin-half behavior arise in the\n13C SSFP response, both in the absence and in the presence of 1H spin\ndecoupling. In the former case deviations are produced by the differential\nrelaxation of antiphase two-spin terms generated by the pulse train; in the\nlatter case, magnified interferences may arise between the SSFP pulses and the\ncoherent perturbation arising upon 1H decoupling. Although both phenomena are\nalso known in FT NMR, the spectral distortions that they will originate may be\nmuch larger in the SSFP case, particularly if interpulse delays in large flip\nangle SSFP pulse trains resonate with the coupling perturbations. The origins\nof these effects are here analyzed for heteronuclear spin-half systems and\ncorroborated with 13C NMR SSFP experiments recorded under different conditions.\nAdditional considerations aimed at magnifying or suppressing these effects, as\nwell as extensions to more complex scenarios, are also briefly discussed.",

The basic\nidea of PSRs is to evaluate the cost function at different parameter shifts,\nthen use specific coefficients to combine them linearly to obtain the exact\nderivatives. In this work, we propose an extended parameter shift rule (EPSR)\nwhich generalizes a broad range of existing PSRs and has the following two\nadvantages. First, EPSR offers an infinite number of possible parameter shifts,\nallowing the selection of the optimal parameter shifts to minimize the final\nderivative variance and thereby obtaining the more accurate derivative\nestimates with limited quantum resources. Second, EPSR extends the scope of the\nPSRs in the sense that EPSR can handle arbitrary Hermitian operator $H$ in gate\n$U(x) = \\exp (iHx)$ in the parameterized quantum circuits, while existing PSRs\nare valid only for simple Hermitian generators $H$ such as simple Pauli words.\nAdditionally, we show that the widely used ``general PSR'', introduced by\nWierichs et al. (2022), is a special case of our EPSR, and we prove that it\nyields globally optimal shifts for minimizing the derivative variance under the\nweighted-shot scheme. Finally, through numerical simulations, we demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of EPSR and show that the usage of the optimal parameter\nshifts indeed leads to more accurate derivative estimates.",

MARTA\noperates in cooperative multi-agent settings where agents may lose the ability\nto execute their intended actions.

At the heart of MARTA is a novel\nadversarial Markov game in which an adversary -- modelled via \\emph{Markov\nswitching controls} -- learns to disable agents in high-risk state regions,\nwhile the remaining agents are trained to \\emph{jointly} best-respond to such\ntargeted malfunctions. To ensure practicality, MARTA enforces a malfunction\nbudget, constraining the adversary to a fixed number of failures and learning\nrobust policies accordingly. We provide theoretical guarantees that MARTA\nconverges to a Markov perfect equilibrium, ensuring agents optimally counteract\nworst-case faults.

We address two quantum state generation problems:\ntrajectory-level recovery of pure state ensembles and ensemble-average recovery\nof mixed states. For trajectory-level recovery, we establish that quantum score\nmatching is mathematically equivalent to learning unitary generators for the\nreverse process. For ensemble-average recovery, we introduce local Petz\nrecovery maps for states with finite correlation length and classical shadow\nreconstruction for general states, both with rigorous error bounds. Our\nframework establishes Petz recovery maps as quantum generalizations of reverse\nFokker-Planck equations, providing a rigorous bridge between quantum recovery\nchannels and classical stochastic reversals. This work enables new approaches\nto quantum state generation with potential applications in quantum information\nscience.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have achieved remarkable\nprogress in dynamic human reconstruction and rendering. Part-based rendering\nparadigms, guided by human segmentation, allow for flexible parameter\nallocation based on structural complexity, thereby enhancing representational\nefficiency. However, existing methods still struggle with complex pose\nvariations, often producing unnatural transitions at part boundaries and\nfailing to reconstruct occluded regions accurately in monocular settings. We\npropose MonoPartNeRF, a novel framework for monocular dynamic human rendering\nthat ensures smooth transitions and robust occlusion recovery. First, we build\na bidirectional deformation model that combines rigid and non-rigid\ntransformations to establish a continuous, reversible mapping between\nobservation and canonical spaces. Sampling points are projected into a\nparameterized surface-time space (u, v, t) to better capture non-rigid motion.\nA consistency loss further suppresses deformation-induced artifacts and\ndiscontinuities. We introduce a part-based pose embedding mechanism that\ndecomposes global pose vectors into local joint embeddings based on body\nregions. This is combined with keyframe pose retrieval and interpolation, along\nthree orthogonal directions, to guide pose-aware feature sampling. A learnable\nappearance code is integrated via attention to model dynamic texture changes\neffectively. Experiments on the ZJU-MoCap and MonoCap datasets demonstrate that\nour method significantly outperforms prior approaches under complex pose and\nocclusion conditions, achieving superior joint alignment, texture fidelity, and\nstructural continuity.",

Besides\nit addresses several limitations of the legacy linear MMSE solutions, for\nexample, by being independent of other reference signals and particularly by\njointly processing MIMO layers and differently precoded channels with unknown\nprecoding at the receiver. ReQuestNet comprises of two sub-units, CoarseNet\nfollowed by RefinementNet. CoarseNet performs per PRG, per transmit-receive\n(Tx-Rx) stream channel estimation, while RefinementNet refines the CoarseNet\nchannel estimate by incorporating correlations across differently precoded\nPRGs, and correlation across multiple input multiple output (MIMO) channel\nspatial dimensions (cross-MIMO). Simulation results demonstrate that ReQuestNet\nsignificantly outperforms genie minimum mean squared error (MMSE) CE across a\nwide range of channel conditions, delay-Doppler profiles, achieving up to 10dB\ngain at high SNRs.

In this paper, we investigate the privacy-protected\nRAG scenario for the first time, where entities in KGs are anonymous for LLMs,\nthus preventing them from accessing entity semantics. Due to the loss of\nsemantics of entities, previous RAG systems cannot retrieve question-relevant\nknowledge from KGs by matching questions with the meaningless identifiers of\nanonymous entities. To realize an effective RAG system in this scenario, two\nkey challenges must be addressed: (1) How can anonymous entities be converted\ninto retrievable information. (2) How to retrieve question-relevant anonymous\nentities. Hence, we propose a novel ARoG framework including relation-centric\nabstraction and structure-oriented abstraction strategies. For challenge (1),\nthe first strategy abstracts entities into high-level concepts by dynamically\ncapturing the semantics of their adjacent relations. It supplements meaningful\nsemantics which can further support the retrieval process. For challenge (2),\nthe second strategy transforms unstructured natural language questions into\nstructured abstract concept paths. These paths can be more effectively aligned\nwith the abstracted concepts in KGs, thereby improving retrieval performance.\nTo guide LLMs to effectively retrieve knowledge from KGs, the two strategies\nstrictly protect privacy from being exposed to LLMs. Experiments on three\ndatasets demonstrate that ARoG achieves strong performance and\nprivacy-robustness.",

    "abstract": "Animal pose estimation is a fundamental task in computer vision, with growing\nimportance in ecological monitoring, behavioral analysis, and intelligent\nlivestock management. Compared to human pose estimation, animal pose estimation\nis more challenging due to high interspecies morphological diversity, complex\nbody structures, and limited annotated data. In this work, we introduce\nDiffPose-Animal, a novel diffusion-based framework for top-down animal pose\nestimation. Unlike traditional heatmap regression methods, DiffPose-Animal\nreformulates pose estimation as a denoising process under the generative\nframework of diffusion models. To enhance semantic guidance during keypoint\ngeneration, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to extract both global\nanatomical priors and local keypoint-wise semantics based on species-specific\nprompts. These textual priors are encoded and fused with image features via\ncross-attention modules to provide biologically meaningful constraints\nthroughout the denoising process. Additionally, a diffusion-based keypoint\ndecoder is designed to progressively refine pose predictions, improving\nrobustness to occlusion and annotation sparsity. Extensive experiments on\npublic animal pose datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization\ncapability of our method, especially under challenging scenarios with diverse\nspecies, cluttered backgrounds, and incomplete keypoints.",

Fast imaging based on unfocused transmits has disadvantages\nsuch as motion decorrelation and limited harmonic imaging capabilities. This\nwork introduces a patient-adaptive focused transmit scheme that has the ability\nto drastically reduce the number of transmits needed to produce a high-quality\nultrasound image. The method relies on posterior sampling with a temporal\ndiffusion model to perceive and reconstruct the anatomy based on partial\nobservations, while subsequently taking an action to acquire the most\ninformative transmits. This active perception modality outperforms random and\nequispaced subsampling on the 2D EchoNet-Dynamic dataset and a 3D Philips\ndataset, where we actively select focused elevation planes. Furthermore, we\nshow it achieves better performance in terms of generalized contrast-to-noise\nratio when compared to the same number of diverging waves transmits on three\nin-house echocardiograms.

However, real-world scenarios are more complex, often requiring\nthe recognition of an object in a cluttered scene based on a vague, free-form\ndescription. To this end, we present ROOMELSA, a new benchmark designed to\nevaluate a system's ability to interpret natural language. Specifically,\nROOMELSA attends to a specific region within a panoramic room image and\naccurately retrieves the corresponding 3D model from a large database. In\naddition, ROOMELSA includes over 1,600 apartment scenes, nearly 5,200 rooms,\nand more than 44,000 targeted queries. Empirically, while coarse object\nretrieval is largely solved, only one top-performing model consistently ranked\nthe correct match first across nearly all test cases. Notably, a lightweight\nCLIP-based model also performed well, although it struggled with subtle\nvariations in materials, part structures, and contextual cues, resulting in\noccasional errors. These findings highlight the importance of tightly\nintegrating visual and language understanding.

These functionals are derived from the support measures\narising in connection with the general Steiner formula due to Hug, Last, and\nWeil, and offer new tools for extracting geometric information beyond classical\nfractal dimensions. The basic contents are constructed from the support\nmeasures of the set itself, while the support contents arise from those of its\nparallel sets. Associated scaling exponents characterize the asymptotic\nbehavior of these measures as the resolution parameter tends to zero. We\nestablish a fundamental connection between the maximum of the basic scaling\nexponents and the outer Minkowski dimension. The proof relies on the novel\nnotion of outer box dimension. Furthermore, we explore how support contents\nsupply aggregated information on geometric features that is provided separately\nby the basic contents, and how they relate to fractal curvatures and complex\ndimensions. Our results provide a deeper understanding of which geometric\naspects actually contribute to fractal invariants such as the (outer) Minkowski\ncontent. We provide some illustrative examples.",

The\nhybrid technology of these two ingredients is expected to be a powerful tool to\nsolve complex problems in many branches of science and engineering such as\ncombinatorial optimization problems and accelerate the creation of\nnext-generation technologies. In this work, we develop an algorithm to solve a\nblack-box optimization problem by improving Factorization Machine Annealing\n(FMA) such that the training of a machine learning model called Factorization\nMachine is performed not by a full dataset but by a subdataset which is sampled\nfrom a full dataset: Subsampling Factorization Machine Annealing (SFMA).\nAccording to such a probabilistic training process, the performance of FMA on\nexploring a solution space gets enhanced. As a result, SFMA exhibits balanced\nperformance of exploration and exploitation which we call\nexploitation-exploration functionality. We conduct numerical benchmarking tests\nto compare the performance of SFMA with that of FMA. Consequently, SFMA\ncertainly exhibits the exploration-exploitation functionality and outperforms\nFMA in speed and accuracy. In addition, the performance of SFMA can be further\nimproved by sequentially using two subsampling datasets with different sizes\nsuch that the size of the latter dataset is substantially smaller than the\nformer. Such a substantial reduction not only enhances the exploration\nperformance of SFMA but also enables us to run it with correspondingly low\ncomputational cost even for a large-scale problem. These results indicate the\neffectiveness of SFMA in a certain class of black-box optimization problems of\nsignificant size: the potential scalability of SFMA in solving large-scale\nproblems with correspondingly low computational cost.",

In this paper, we propose a novel\nframework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as offline judges to\nassess the quality of podcast recommendations in a scalable and interpretable\nmanner. Our two-stage profile-aware approach first constructs natural-language\nuser profiles distilled from 90 days of listening history. These profiles\nsummarize both topical interests and behavioral patterns, serving as compact,\ninterpretable representations of user preferences. Rather than prompting the\nLLM with raw data, we use these profiles to provide high-level, semantically\nrich context-enabling the LLM to reason more effectively about alignment\nbetween a user's interests and recommended episodes. This reduces input\ncomplexity and improves interpretability. The LLM is then prompted to deliver\nfine-grained pointwise and pairwise judgments based on the profile-episode\nmatch. In a controlled study with 47 participants, our profile-aware judge\nmatched human judgments with high fidelity and outperformed or matched a\nvariant using raw listening histories.

    "abstract": "In semi-supervised learning (SSL) for enhancing the performance of graph\nneural networks (GNNs) with unlabeled data, introducing mutually independent\ndecision factors for cross-validation is regarded as an effective strategy to\nalleviate pseudo-label confirmation bias and training collapse. However,\nobtaining such factors is challenging in practice: additional and valid\ninformation sources are inherently scarce, and even when such sources are\navailable, their independence from the original source cannot be guaranteed. To\naddress this challenge, In this paper we propose a Differentiated Factor\nConsistency Semi-supervised Framework (DiFac), which derives differentiated\nfactors from a single information source and enforces their consistency. During\npre-training, the model learns to extract these factors; in training, it\niteratively removes samples with conflicting factors and ranks pseudo-labels\nbased on the shortest stave principle, selecting the top candidate samples to\nreduce overconfidence commonly observed in confidence-based or ensemble-based\nmethods. Our framework can also incorporate additional information sources. In\nthis work, we leverage the large multimodal language model to introduce latent\ntextual knowledge as auxiliary decision factors, and we design a accountability\nscoring mechanism to mitigate additional erroneous judgments introduced by\nthese auxiliary factors. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate\nthat DiFac consistently improves robustness and generalization in low-label\nregimes, outperforming other baseline methods.",

When interpreted as arising from AGN broad-line regions, inferred black\nhole masses from local scaling relations exceed expectations given their\nstellar masses, challenging models of early black hole-galaxy co-evolution.\nHowever, radiative transfer effects in dense media may also impact the\nformation of hydrogen emission lines. We model three scattering processes\nshaping hydrogen line profiles: resonance scattering by hydrogen in the $n=2$\nstate, Raman scattering of UV radiation by ground-state hydrogen, and Thomson\nscattering by free electrons. Using 3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer\nsimulations with multi-branching resonance transitions, we examine their\nimprint on line shapes and ratios. Resonance scattering produces strong\ndeviations from Case B flux ratios, clear differences between H$\\alpha$ and\nH$\\beta$, and encodes gas kinematics in line profiles but cannot broaden\nH$\\beta$ due to conversion to Pa$\\alpha$.

    "abstract": "Large-scale solar eruptions are generally accepted to have coronal magnetic\nflux ropes as their core structures. Recent studies found that the solar\neruptions could be initiated by a sequence of flux feeding processes, during\nwith chromospheric fibrils rise and merge with the pre-existing coronal flux\nrope. Further theoretical analyses have demonstrated that the normal flux\nfeeding, i.e. the axial magnetic flux within the fibril is in the same\ndirection as that in the flux rope, results in the accumulation of the total\naxial flux within the flux rope, so as to initiate the eruption. If the\ndirections of the axial flux in the fibril and the flux rope are opposite, it\nis termed inverse flux feeding, whose influence on coronal flux ropes, however,\nis still unclear. In this paper, we use a 2.5-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic\nmodel to simulate the evolution of coronal flux ropes associated with inverse\nflux feeding. It is found that inverse flux feeding is also efficient in\ncausing solar eruptions: although the total signed axial magnetic flux of the\nrope decreases after inverse flux feeding, the total unsigned axial flux can\naccumulate; the eruption occurs if the unsigned axial flux of the rope reaches\na critical value, which is almost the same as the threshold for normal flux\nfeeding. The total axial currents within the rope are also similar during the\nonset of the eruptions caused by both normal and inverse flux feeding. Our\nsimulation results suggest that it is the unsigned axial magnetic flux rather\nthan the signed axial flux that regulates the onset of coronal flux rope\neruptions.",

Furthermore,\ndetectors fine-tuned on emulated videos achieve comparable performance to those\ntrained on actual shared media.

The detection significance of the candidate\noptical signal identified in those data lies between 2.9 and 3.5 $\\sigma$,\ndepending on the statistical test employed. The pulsed signal has a duty cycle\nof $\\approx 1/32$, and the de-reddened pulsed magnitude in the V band is $(26.0\n\\pm 0.6)$ mag. At a distance of 1.7 kpc, this corresponds to a conversion\nefficiency of $\\sim 3 \\times 10^{-6}$ of the pulsar's spin-down power into\npulsed optical luminosity, comparable to values observed in young, isolated\npulsars like the Crab, but 50-100 times lower than in disk-accreting\nmillisecond pulsars.

    "abstract": "Kernel methods are versatile tools for function approximation and surrogate\nmodeling. In particular, greedy techniques offer computational efficiency and\nreliability through inherent sparsity and provable convergence. Inspired by the\nsuccess of deep neural networks and structured deep kernel networks, we\nconsider deep, multilayer kernels for greedy approximation. This multilayer\nstructure, consisting of linear kernel layers and optimizable kernel activation\nfunction layers in an alternating fashion, increases the expressiveness of the\nkernels and thus of the resulting approximants. Compared to standard kernels,\ndeep kernels are able to adapt kernel intrinsic shape parameters automatically,\nincorporate transformations of the input space and induce a data-dependent\nreproducing kernel Hilbert space. For this, deep kernels need to be pretrained\nusing a specifically tailored optimization objective. In this work, we not only\nintroduce deep kernel greedy models, but also present numerical investigations\nand comparisons with neural networks, which clearly show the advantages in\nterms of approximation accuracies. As applications we consider the\napproximation of model problems, the prediction of breakthrough curves for\nreactive flow through porous media and the approximation of solutions for\nparametrized ordinary differential equation systems.",

    "abstract": "Random-effects meta-analysis is widely used for synthesizing results across\nstudies, but the implicit assumption of normality in study-specific aggregate\ndata is often violated. Such violations can lead to biased estimates and\nmisleading conclusions, especially in meta-analyses with small studies or rare\nevents. A prominent example occurs with the log-odds ratio, which exhibits bias\nthat depends on the within-study sample sizes. We first show that conventional\nmethods assuming normality fail to eliminate such biases, even as the number of\nstudies increases. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a generalized\nlinear mixed-effects model that uses only aggregate data, accommodating a wide\nrange of outcome types, including binomial, Poisson, gamma, and other members\nof the exponential family, without requiring individual participant data. To\nenable valid interval estimation when the number of studies is small, we\nfurther propose a simple Bartlett correction for the test statistics. The\nproposed method yields consistent point estimators without relying on the\nnormality assumption and achieves accurate interval coverage across diverse\noutcome types. It is particularly applicable in clinical and epidemiological\nresearch where only summary data are available, making it a practical\nalternative to conventional approaches. Simulation studies and applications to\nthree published meta-analyses with binary, Poisson, and gamma outcomes\ndemonstrate that the method provides reliable inference and maintains nominal\ncoverage, thereby supporting sound decision-making and guideline development\nwhen only aggregate data are available.",

The parameter represents the non-causal association\nbetween exposure and outcome due to unobserved confounding, which is modeled as\na Gaussian copula.

Given the expected maximum mass values for neutron stars, this object\nwas identified as a black hole, and, with the secondary component being a\nneutron star, the detection was classified as a neutron star-black hole merger.\nHowever, due to the low signal-to-noise ratio and the known waveform degeneracy\nbetween the spin and mass ratio in the employed gravitational-wave models,\nGW230529_181500 could also be interpreted as a merger of two heavy ($\\gtrsim 2\n\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$) neutron stars with high spins.

    "abstract": "Route recommendation (RR) is a core task of route planning in the Amap app,\nwith the goal of recommending the optimal route among candidate routes to\nusers. Unlike traditional recommendation methods, insights into the local\nquality of routes and comparisons between candidate routes are crucial for\nenhancing recommendation performance but often overlooked in previous studies.\nTo achieve these, we propose a novel model called Comprehensive Comparison\nNetwork (CCN). CCN not only uses query-level features (e.g. user features) and\nitem-level features (e.g. route features, item embedding) that are common in\ntraditional recommendations, but also introduces comparison-level features\nwhich describe the non-overlapping segments between different routes to capture\nthe local quality of routes. The key component Comprehensive Comparison Block\n(CCB) in CCN is designed to enable comparisons between routes. CCB includes a\nComprehensive Comparison Operator (CCO) and a multi-scenario MLP, which can\nupdate the representations of candidate routes based on a comprehensive\ncomparison. By stacking multiple CCBs, CCN can determine the final scores of\ncandidate routes and recommend the optimal one to the user. Additionally, since\nroutes directly affect the costs and risks experienced by users, the RR model\nmust be interpretable for online deployment. Therefore, we designed an\ninterpretable pair scoring network to achieve interpretability. Both offline\nand online experiments demonstrate that CCN significantly improves RR\nperformance and exhibits strong interpretability. CCN has been fully deployed\nin the Amap app for over a year, providing stable and optimal benefits for\nroute recommendations.",

Numerous methods have been\nproposed to handle ANNS efficiently, while graph-based indexes have gained\nprominence due to their high accuracy and efficiency. However, the indexing\noverhead of graph-based indexes remains substantial. With exponential growth in\ndata volume and increasing demands for dynamic index adjustments, this overhead\ncontinues to escalate, posing a critical challenge. In this paper, we introduce\nTagore, a fast library accelerated by GPUs for graph indexing, which has\npowerful capabilities of constructing refinement-based graph indexes such as\nNSG and Vamana. We first introduce GNN-Descent, a GPU-specific algorithm for\nefficient k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) graph initialization. GNN-Descent speeds up\nthe similarity comparison by a two-phase descent procedure and enables highly\nparallelized neighbor updates. Next, aiming to support various k-NN graph\npruning strategies, we formulate a universal computing procedure termed CFS and\ndevise two generalized GPU kernels for parallel processing complex dependencies\nin neighbor relationships. For large-scale datasets exceeding GPU memory\ncapacity, we propose an asynchronous GPU-CPU-disk indexing framework with a\ncluster-aware caching mechanism to minimize the I/O pressure on the disk.\nExtensive experiments on 7 real-world datasets exhibit that Tagore achieves\n1.32x-112.79x speedup while maintaining the index quality.",

To rigorously assess the reranker performance in\nterms of noise resilience, relevance disambiguation, and factual consistency,\nwe develop three types of question-context-answer (Q-C-A) pairs, i.e., Noisy\nContexts (NC), Semantically Similar but Logically Irrelevant Contexts (SSLI),\nand Counterfactual Contexts (CC). Through systematic evaluation of 13 widely\nused rerankers on five families of LLMs, we provide detailed insights into\ntheir relative strengths and limitations.

We measured the colour gradients for 33 PSBs, 332 quiescent galaxies\n(QGs), and 1136 star-forming gaaxies (SFGs) by using COSMOS $HST$/ACS\n$I_{F814W}$-band and COSMOS-DASH $HST$/WFC3 $H_{F160W}$-band data.

Only PSBs with\n$\\log{C_{A}} > 0.6$ show positive gradients, which suggests that their central\nasymmetric features are caused by disturbed distribution of relatively young\nstars near the centre. The colour gradients are also closely related with\nhalf-light radius rather than stellar mass for all the populations. The\npositive colour gradients and very small sizes of those PSBs with high $C_A$\nsuggest that a nuclear starburst caused by gas-rich major merger occurred in\nthe recent past. On the other hand, similarly massive PSBs with $\\log C_A <\n0.6$ show the negative colour gradients, heavier dust extinction, and larger\nsizes, and their origins may be different from those PSBs with high $C_A$.",

As a\ncorollary, any $T$-round Congested Clique algorithm can be compiled into an\nalgorithm that completes in $T^2 n^{o(1)}$ rounds in this model.\n  Our compiler obtains resilience to node crashes by coding information across\nthe network, where we leverage locally-decodable codes (LDCs) to maintain a low\ncomplexity overhead, as these allow recovering the information needed at each\ncomputational step by querying only small parts of the codeword.\n  The main technical contribution is that because erasures occur in known\nlocations, which correspond to crashed nodes, we can derandomize classical LDC\nconstructions by deterministically selecting query sets that avoid sufficiently\nmany erasures. Moreover, when decoding multiple codewords in parallel, our\nderandomization load-balances the queries per-node, thereby preventing\ncongestion and maintaining a low round complexity.\n  Deterministic decoding of LDCs presents a new challenge: the adversary can\ntarget precisely the (few) nodes that are queried for decoding a certain\ncodeword. We overcome this issue via an adaptive doubling strategy: if a\ndecoding attempt for a codeword fails, the node doubles the number of its\ndecoding attempts. Similarly, when the adversary crashes the decoding node\nitself, we replace it dynamically with two other non-crashed nodes. By\ncarefully combining these two doubling processes, we overcome the challenges\nposed by the combination of a deterministic LDC with a worst case pattern of\ncrashes.",

    "abstract": "Structured light beams with engineered topological properties offer a\npowerful means to control spin angular momentum (SAM) and optical chirality,\nkey quantities shaped by spin-orbit interaction (SOI) in light. Such effects\nare typically regarded as emerging only through light-matter interactions.\nHere, we show that higher-order Poincar\\'e modes, carrying a tunable\nPancharatnam topological charge $\\ell_p$, enable precise control of SOI purely\nfrom the intrinsic topology of the light field, without requiring any material\ninterface. In doing so, we reveal a free-space paraxial optical Hall effect,\nwhere modulation of $\\ell_p$ drives spatial separation of circular polarization\nstates - a direct signature of SOI in a regime previously thought immune to\nsuch behaviour. Our analysis identifies two propagation-induced topological\nmechanisms underlying this effect: differential Gouy phase shifts between\northogonal components, and radial divergence of the beam envelope. These\nresults overturn the common view that spin-orbit effects in free space require\nnon-paraxial conditions, and establish a broadly tunable route to generating\nand controlling chirality and SAM without tight focusing. This approach\nprovides new opportunities for optical manipulation, chiral sensing, and\nhigh-dimensional photonic information processing.",

    "abstract": "Endogenous security in next-generation wireless communication systems\nattracts increasing attentions in recent years. A typical solution to\nendogenous security problems is the quantum key distribution (QKD), where\nunconditional security can be achieved thanks to the inherent properties of\nquantum mechanics. Continuous variable-quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) enjoys\nhigh secret key rate (SKR) and good compatibility with existing optical\ncommunication infrastructure. Traditional CV-QKD usually employ coherent\nreceivers to detect coherent states, whose detection performance is restricted\nto the standard quantum limit. In this paper, we employ a generalized Kennedy\nreceiver called CD-Kennedy receiver to enhance the detection performance of\ncoherent states in turbulent channels, where equal-gain combining (EGC) method\nis used to combine the output of CD-Kennedy receivers. Besides, we derive the\nSKR of a post-selection based CV-QKD protocol using both CD-Kennedy receiver\nand homodyne receiver with EGC in turbulent channels. We further propose an\nequivalent transmittance method to facilitate the calculation of both the\nbit-error rate (BER) and SKR. Numerical results show that the CD-Kennedy\nreceiver can outperform the homodyne receiver in turbulent channels in terms of\nboth BER and SKR performance. We find that BER and SKR performance advantage of\nCD-Kennedy receiver over homodyne receiver demonstrate opposite trends as the\naverage transmittance increases, which indicates that two separate system\nsettings should be employed for communication and key distribution purposes.\nBesides, we also demonstrate that the SKR performance of a CD-Kennedy receiver\nis much robust than that of a homodyne receiver in turbulent channels.",

To preserve semantic\nfidelity during the lay language generation process, Magical introduces a\nSemantic Invariance Constraint to mitigate semantic subspace shifts on matrix\n$A$.

    "abstract": "The real-time prediction of chaotic systems requires a nonlinear-reduced\norder model (ROM) to forecast the dynamics, and a stream of data from sensors\nto update the ROM. Data-driven ROMs are typically built with a two-step\nstrategy: data compression in a lower-dimensional latent space, and prediction\nof the temporal dynamics on it. To achieve real-time prediction, however, there\nare two challenges to overcome: (i) ROMs of chaotic systems can become\nnumerically unstable; and (ii) sensors' data are sparse, i.e., partial, and\nnoisy. To overcome these challenges, we propose a three-step strategy: (i) a\nconvolutional autoencoder (CAE) compresses the system's state onto a\nlower-dimensional latent space; (ii) a latent ROM (echo state network, ESN),\nwhich is formulated as a state-space model, predicts the temporal evolution on\nthe latent space; and (iii) sequential data assimilation based on the Ensemble\nKalman filter (EnKF) adaptively corrects the latent ROM by assimilating noisy\nand sparse measurements. This provides a numerically stable method\n(DA-CAE-ESN), which corrects itself every time that data becomes available from\nsensors. The DA-CAE-ESN is tested on spatio-temporally chaotic partial\ndifferential equations: the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and a\ntwo-dimensional Navier-Stokes equation (Kolmogorov flow). We show that the\nmethod provides accurate and stable forecasts across different levels of noise,\nsparsity, and sampling rates. As a by-product, the DA-CAE-ESN acts as a\nlocalization strategy that mitigates spurious correlations, which arise when\napplying the EnKF to high-dimensional systems. The DA-CAE-ESN provides a\nnumerically stable method to perform real-time predictions, which opens\nopportunities for deploying data-driven latent models.",

This model contains a key\nconceptual issue that obscures a robust system. This system can link to the\nEnergy Based Cobb-Douglas equation.\n  The key conceptual problem is the belief that $\\lambda$, the symbol for\ngrowth in Garrett 2011 would disprove the model if it was not constant.\nHowever, $\\lambda$ cannot be a constant in an economic model, because\n$\\lambda$, with dimension [$\\frac{E}{\\$ \\; GWP}$], represents the aggregate\nefficiency of all of the more than 359 million firms (and by extension,\nhouseholds) making products globally. To clarify it, I define this aggregate\nproduction function distribution as $\\Lambda(t) \\equiv \\sum {\\lambda_i(t) \\cdot\n\\frac{P_i}{GWP}}$, and with light algebra assign a version of the Energy Based\nCobb-Douglas (EBDC) function to $\\lambda$.\n  There are various falsified speculations in the body of work that appear to\nmostly follow from the original issue. The 50 year stable relation of $W$ to\n$E$ is close, but the trend is not flat. The form and degree to which the \"long\narm of history\" speculation may be true remains to be fully considered, but is\nfalsified in the form presented. The speculation in Garrett 2022 that\n$\\frac{dE}{dt}\\rightarrow0$ can cause real GDP to go to zero by inflation is\nfalsified. By generating a dataset going back to -14,000 CE, the speculative\n$W$ curve appears largely confirmed. The $E$ curve is quite far off prior to\n1970 back to 1 CE due to overestimation of pre-industrial energy.\n  By correcting and improving on the foundation issue of Garrett's yeoman\neffort, improving $E$ and some equation presentation formalism, a robust\nthermodynamic model of the global economy emerges that is straightforward and\npractical.",

    "abstract": "Unlike conventional magnetic states, which lack degeneracy, the spiral spin\nliquid (SSL) fluctuates among degenerate spiral configurations, with\nground-state wave vectors forming a continuous contour or surface in reciprocal\nspace. At low temperatures, the field-induced crossover from the polarized\nferromagnetic state to the SSL results in a large entropy increase and\ndecalescence, indicating its potential for magnetic cooling. However, magnetic\ncooling using a SSL has yet to be reported. Here, we investigate the\nmagnetocaloric effect and cooling performance of single-crystal GdZnPO, a\nspin-7/2 honeycomb-lattice SSL candidate, under a magnetic field $H$ $<$\n$H_\\mathrm{c}$ ($\\mu_0H_\\mathrm{c}$ $\\sim$ 12 T) applied perpendicular to the\nhoneycomb plane and below the crossover temperature ($\\sim$2 K). For $H$ $\\geq$\n$H_\\mathrm{c}$, GdZnPO enters a polarized non-degenerate ferromagnetic state.\nOur results demonstrate that GdZnPO exhibits a giant low-temperature\nmagnetocaloric effect near $H_\\mathrm{c}$, surpassing other magnetocaloric\nmaterials. This giant magnetocaloric effect is well-explained by the frustrated\nhoneycomb spin model of GdZnPO, suggesting the stability of the SSL below\n$H_\\mathrm{c}$ down to very low temperatures. Additionally, its magnetic\ncooling performance remains robust up to at least 4.5 K, making GdZnPO a\npromising candidate for magnetic refrigeration down to $\\sim$36 mK through\ncycling the applied magnetic field within a narrow range.",

However, existing methods suffer from\nthe superficial elicitation problem: LLMs can only be steered to mimic shallow\nand unstable stylistic patterns, failing to embody the desired traits precisely\nand consistently across diverse tasks like humans. To address this challenge,\nwe propose IROTE, a novel in-context method for stable and transferable trait\nelicitation. Drawing on psychological theories suggesting that traits are\nformed through identity-related reflection, our method automatically generates\nand optimizes a textual self-reflection within prompts, which comprises\nself-perceived experience, to stimulate LLMs' trait-driven behavior. The\noptimization is performed by iteratively maximizing an information-theoretic\nobjective that enhances the connections between LLMs' behavior and the target\ntrait, while reducing noisy redundancy in reflection without any fine-tuning,\nleading to evocative and compact trait reflection. Extensive experiments across\nthree human trait systems manifest that one single IROTE-generated\nself-reflection can induce LLMs' stable impersonation of the target trait\nacross diverse downstream tasks beyond simple questionnaire answering,\nconsistently outperforming existing strong baselines.",

In ecology, stochastic state-space models in discrete time are most\noften used to describe the imperfectly observed dynamics of population sizes or\nanimal movement. However, several studies have observed identifiability issues\nwhen state-space models are fitted to simulated or real data, and it is not\ncurrently clear whether those are due to data limitations or more fundamental\nmodel non-identifiability. To investigate such theoretical identifiability, a\nsuitable exhaustive summary is required, defined as a vector of parameter\ncombinations which fully determines the model. Previous work on exhaustive\nsummaries has used expectations of the stochastic process, so that noise\nparameters are unaccounted for. In this paper, we build an exhaustive summary\nusing the spectral density of the observed process, which fully accounts for\nall mean and variance parameters. This diagnostic is applied to contrasted\necological models and we show that they are generally theoretically\nidentifiable, unless some model compartements are unobserved.

In contrast, the primary bar in NGC 7716 is too weak to be\nclassified as a barred galaxy, while its nuclear disk and nuclear bar are\nunusually large, possibly due to tidal interactions or the weakness of the\nprimary bar.

During inference, PF2MP\nmodulates the flow matching vector field via the learned potential field,\nenabling safe motion generation.

    "abstract": "Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models build upon vision-language\nfoundations, and have achieved promising results and exhibit the possibility of\ntask generalization in robot manipulation. However, due to the heterogeneity of\ntactile sensors and the difficulty of acquiring tactile data, current VLA\nmodels significantly overlook the importance of tactile perception and fail in\ncontact-rich tasks. To address this issue, this paper proposes OmniVTLA, a\nnovel architecture involving tactile sensing. Specifically, our contributions\nare threefold. First, our OmniVTLA features a dual-path tactile encoder\nframework. This framework enhances tactile perception across diverse\nvision-based and force-based tactile sensors by using a pretrained vision\ntransformer (ViT) and a semantically-aligned tactile ViT (SA-ViT). Second, we\nintroduce ObjTac, a comprehensive force-based tactile dataset capturing\ntextual, visual, and tactile information for 56 objects across 10 categories.\nWith 135K tri-modal samples, ObjTac supplements existing visuo-tactile\ndatasets. Third, leveraging this dataset, we train a semantically-aligned\ntactile encoder to learn a unified tactile representation, serving as a better\ninitialization for OmniVTLA. Real-world experiments demonstrate substantial\nimprovements over state-of-the-art VLA baselines, achieving 96.9% success rates\nwith grippers, (21.9% higher over baseline) and 100% success rates with\ndexterous hands (6.2% higher over baseline) in pick-and-place tasks. Besides,\nOmniVTLA significantly reduces task completion time and generates smoother\ntrajectories through tactile sensing compared to existing VLA.

Existing deep segmentation\nnetworks typically weight all pixels equally under cross-entropy (CE) loss,\noverlooking the fact that sub-regions of lens structures are inhomogeneous\n(e.g., some regions perform better than others) and that boundary regions often\nsuffer from poor segmentation calibration at the pixel level. Clinically,\nexperts annotate different sub-regions of lens structures with varying\nconfidence levels, considering factors such as sub-region proportions,\nambiguous boundaries, and lens structure shapes. Motivated by this observation,\nwe propose an Adaptive Confidence-Wise (ACW) loss to group each lens structure\nsub-region into different confidence sub-regions via a confidence threshold\nfrom the unique region aspect, aiming to exploit the potential of expert\nannotation confidence prior. Specifically, ACW clusters each target region into\nlow-confidence and high-confidence groups and then applies a region-weighted\nloss to reweigh each confidence group. Moreover, we design an adaptive\nconfidence threshold optimization algorithm to adjust the confidence threshold\nof ACW dynamically. Additionally, to better quantify the miscalibration errors\nin boundary region segmentation, we propose a new metric, termed Boundary\nExpected Calibration Error (BECE). Extensive experiments on a clinical lens\nstructure AS-OCT dataset and other multi-structure datasets demonstrate that\nour ACW significantly outperforms competitive segmentation loss methods across\ndifferent deep segmentation networks (e.g., MedSAM).

    "abstract": "Criticality is a fundamental notion in graph theory that has been studied\ncontinually since its introduction in the early 50s by Dirac. A graph is called\n$k$-vertex-critical ($k$-edge-critical) if it is $k$-chromatic but removing any\nvertex (edge) lowers the chromatic number to $k-1$. A set of edges in a graph\nis called critical if its removal reduces the chromatic number of the graph.\n  In 1970, Dirac conjectured a rather strong distinction between the notions of\nvertex- and edge-criticality, namely that for every $k\\ge 4$ there exists a\n$k$-vertex-critical graph that does not have any critical edges. This\nconjecture was proved for $k\\ge 5$ by Jensen in 2002 and remains open only for\n$k=4$. A much stronger version of Dirac's conjecture was proposed by Erd\\H{o}s\nin 1985: Let $k\\ge 4$ be fixed, and let $f_k(n)$ denote the largest integer\nsuch that there exists a $k$-vertex-critical graph of order $n$ in which no set\nof at most $f_k(n)$ edges is critical. Is it true that $f_k(n)\\rightarrow\n\\infty$ for $n\\rightarrow \\infty$?\n  Strengthening previous partial results, we solve this problem affirmatively\nfor all $k>4$, proving that $$f_k(n)=\\Omega(n^{1/3}).$$ This leaves only the\ncase $k=4$ open. We also show that a stronger lower bound of order $\\sqrt{n}$\nholds along an infinite sequence of numbers $n$. Finally, we provide a first\nnon-trivial upper bound on the functions $f_k$ by proving that\n$$f_k(n)=O\\left(\\frac{n}{(\\log n)^{\\Omega(1)}}\\right)$$ for every $k\\ge 4$. Our\nproof of the lower bound on $f_k(n)$ involves an intricate analysis of the\nstructure of proper colorings of a modification of an earlier construction due\nto Jensen, combined with a gluing operation that creates new vertex-critical\ngraphs without small critical edge sets from given such graphs. The upper bound\nis obtained using a variant of Szemer\\'{e}di's regularity lemma due to Conlon\nand Fox.",

Bailouts are considered only when an externality threshold is met.\nWith quadratic implementation costs, the static problem yields a simple\n''threshold--linear--cap'' (TLC) policy: zero below a lower activation point,\nlinear in the middle, and flat at an upper cap. We characterize a knife-edge\nfor a complete no bailout regime, either because the consent cap blocks all\nproposals or because the political cost of funds exceeds the maximum marginal\nbenefit of relief. Comparative statics are transparent: increasing the\npolitical cost shifts activation upward; tightening the consent cap lowers the\nupper plateau; joint institutional changes move the two kinks in predictable\nways. The WRD mechanism is observation ally equivalent to TLC rules obtained\nfrom screening models, yet attributes the same geometry to representation\ndesign rather than private information.

Quantum Machine Learning\n(QML), which integrates quantum computing with machine learning techniques,\npresents powerful new tools for data processing and pattern recognition. This\npaper proposes a hybrid recommendation system that combines Quantum Hopfield\nAssociative Memory (QHAM) with deep neural networks to improve the extraction\nand classification on the MovieLens 1M dataset.

The system was trained using the MSE loss over 35 epochs in an ideal\nenvironment, achieving an ROC value of 0.9795, an accuracy of 0.8841, and an\nF-1 Score of 0.8786. Trained with the same number of epochs in a noisy\nenvironment using a custom Qiskit AER noise model incorporating bit-flip and\nreadout errors with the same probabilities as in real quantum hardware, it\nachieves an ROC of 0.9177, an accuracy of 0.8013, and an F-1 Score equal to\n0.7866, demonstrating consistent performance.\n  Additionally, we were able to optimize the qubit overhead present in previous\nQHAM architectures by efficiently updating only one random targeted qubit.

    "abstract": "Training a single model for multilingual, multi-task speech processing (MSP)\nis severely hampered by conflicting objectives between tasks like speech\nrecognition and translation. While multi-objective optimization (MOO) aims to\nalign gradient updates, its effectiveness diminishes as the number of tasks\ngrows, making it difficult to find a common descent direction. This raises a\nfundamental question: should highly conflicting objectives be optimized jointly\nor separated into a hierarchical structure? To address this question, this\npaper investigates three multi-objective MSP formulations, which we refer to as\n\\textbf{objective soup recipes}. These formulations apply multi-objective\noptimization at different optimization levels to mitigate potential conflicts\namong all objectives. To ensure efficiency, we introduce a lightweight\nlayer-selection mechanism that computes the conflict-avoiding gradient using\nonly the most problematic layers, minimizing computational and memory overhead.\nExtensive experiments on CoVoST v2, LibriSpeech, and AISHELL-1 reveal that a\nbi-level recipe separating recognition and translation tasks consistently\noutperforms standard flat optimization. Our work demonstrates that hierarchical\nMOO is a more effective and scalable approach for building state-of-the-art MSP\nmodels.

This approach enforces peer-to-peer consistency among students and\npreserves historical knowledge by aligning each student with the GWM.

    "abstract": "A childhood observation of Thakur Anukulchandra that \"one and one can only be\ntwo ones, not simply two\" motivates a precise inquiry: what, exactly, is\nasserted when we pass from two concrete individuals to the numeral \"2\"? This\npaper does not challenge the arithmetic theorem 1+1=2, but rather analyzes what\nthis equation means when applied to physical objects. We answer with two\ncomplementary, rigorous treatments. Mathematician's proof. We model aggregation\nby the free commutative monoid of multisets M(U) over a universe of individuals\nU, so that delta_a + delta_b literally encodes two ones with individuality\npreserved. Numerals arise only after a declared classification q:U->T\n(coarse-graining) via the pushforward q*:M(U)->M(T) and the unique counting\nhomomorphism to N. The non-injectivity of q* isolates the exact locus of\ninformation loss. Physicist's proof. We represent physical systems by\nworldtubes, states, and observables, and define a composite operation that\npreserves labelled constituents. We prove the Non-Identity Addition Theorem:\nA+B = X+X iff A=B=X; hence a pair of distinct objects cannot equal a doubled\ncopy. The numeral \"2\" appears only as the readout of a typed count observable\nafter an explicit classification, not as a statement of physical identity.\nConclusion. In reality, one plus one is two ones; \"1+1=2\" is the value of a\ncounting map applied after coarse graining. This clarifies the separation\nbetween identity-preserving aggregation and counting, reconciles everyday\narithmetic with physical non-identity, and makes explicit the modeling choice\nthat every act of counting entails. Our analysis has implications for the\nphilosophy of mathematics, measurement theory, and information theoretic\napproaches to classification.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the expected excess risk of in-context learning (ICL)\nfor multiclass classification. We formalize each task as a sequence of labeled\nexamples followed by a query input; a pretrained model then estimates the\nquery's conditional class probabilities. The expected excess risk is defined as\nthe average truncated Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the predicted\nand true conditional class distributions over a specified family of tasks. We\nestablish a new oracle inequality for this risk, based on KL divergence, in\nmulticlass classification. This yields tight upper and lower bounds for\ntransformer-based models, showing that the ICL estimator achieves the minimax\noptimal rate (up to logarithmic factors) for conditional probability\nestimation. From a technical standpoint, our results introduce a novel method\nfor controlling generalization error via uniform empirical entropy. We further\ndemonstrate that multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) can also perform ICL and attain\nthe same optimal rate (up to logarithmic factors) under suitable assumptions,\nsuggesting that effective ICL need not be exclusive to transformer\narchitectures.",

In this\nwork, we introduce AMRG (Automatic Mammography Report Generation), the first\nend-to-end framework for generating narrative mammography reports using large\nvision-language models (VLMs). Building upon MedGemma-4B-it-a\ndomain-specialized, instruction-tuned VLM-we employ a parameter-efficient\nfine-tuning (PEFT) strategy via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), enabling\nlightweight adaptation with minimal computational overhead. We train and\nevaluate AMRG on DMID, a publicly available dataset of paired high-resolution\nmammograms and diagnostic reports. This work establishes the first reproducible\nbenchmark for mammography report generation, addressing a longstanding gap in\nmultimodal clinical AI. We systematically explore LoRA hyperparameter\nconfigurations and conduct comparative experiments across multiple VLM\nbackbones, including both domain-specific and general-purpose models under a\nunified tuning protocol. Our framework demonstrates strong performance across\nboth language generation and clinical metrics, achieving a ROUGE-L score of\n0.5691, METEOR of 0.6152, CIDEr of 0.5818, and BI-RADS accuracy of 0.5582.\nQualitative analysis further highlights improved diagnostic consistency and\nreduced hallucinations.

    "abstract": "The lithium-dip observed in mid-F dwarfs remains a long-standing challenge\nfor stellar evolution models. We present high-precision stellar parameters and\nA(Li) for 22 new comoving pairs, primarily located on the hotter side of the\nLi-Dip. Combined with pairs from the C3PO catalog, our sample includes 124\nstars with Teff between 6000 and 7300 K, encompassing and extending slightly\nbeyond the Li-Dip. Among them, 49 comoving pairs (98 stars) have both\ncomponents within the temperature range of interest. Using this expanded set of\ncomoving pairs observed with high-resolution spectroscopy, we show that\nrotational spin-down is the dominant process responsible for Li depletion in\nthe Li-Dip. First, within comoving pairs, the star with v sin i > 12 km/s shows\nhigher A(Li) than its more slowly rotating companion within the Li-Dip,\nindicating that rotation-dependent mixing drives lithium depletion. Second, we\nobserve a correlation between A(Li) and v sin i: fast rotators retain higher\nA(Li) with less scatter, while slow rotators show lower A(Li) and greater\ndispersion. Third, among slow rotators, A(Li) varies widely, suggesting that\ndifferences in initial rotation rates and spin-down histories influence how\nmuch Li is depleted. Some stars may have formed as fast rotators and spun down\nrapidly, leading to more Li depletion, while others may have started as slow\nrotators and retained more of their initial Li. These results demonstrate that\nrotational induced mixing plays an important role in shaping the Li-Dip beyond\nthe effects of stellar age and mass.",

However, existing methods face\nlimitations in simultaneously satisfying three essential criteria for\ngeneralizable watermarking: 1) invisibility (imperceptible hide of watermarks),\n2) robustness (reliable watermark recovery under diverse conditions), and 3)\nbroad applicability (low latency in watermarking process). To address these\nlimitations, we propose a Hierarchical Watermark Learning (HiWL), a two-stage\noptimization that enable a watermarking model to simultaneously achieve three\ncriteria. In the first stage, distribution alignment learning is designed to\nestablish a common latent space with two constraints: 1) visual consistency\nbetween watermarked and non-watermarked images, and 2) information invariance\nacross watermark latent representations. In this way, multi-modal inputs\nincluding watermark message (binary codes) and cover images (RGB pixels) can be\nwell represented, ensuring the invisibility of watermarks and robustness in\nwatermarking process thereby. The second stage employs generalized watermark\nrepresentation learning to establish a disentanglement policy for separating\nwatermarks from image content in RGB space. In particular, it strongly\npenalizes substantial fluctuations in separated RGB watermarks corresponding to\nidentical messages. Consequently, HiWL effectively learns generalizable\nlatent-space watermark representations while maintaining broad applicability.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed method. In\nparticular, it achieves 7.6\\% higher accuracy in watermark extraction than\nexisting methods, while maintaining extremely low latency (100K images\nprocessed in 8s).",

The distance to M16, derived from the\nparallaxes of the members, is about 1.7 kpc. The ages of members, estimated by\ncomparing their color-magnitude diagram with theoretical isochrones, range from\n1 Myr to 4 Myr. This star-forming region is composed of an open cluster (NGC\n6611) and a distributed population. This cluster shows a clear pattern of\nexpansion and rotation. Some of the distributed population are spatially\nassociated with the gas pillars located at the ridge of H II bubble. In\nparticular, several stars moving away from the cluster are physically\nassociated with the northeastern pillar. In addition, their younger ages\nsupport the idea that the formation of these stars was triggered by the\nfeedback from massive stars in NGC 6611. On the other hand, the other stars do\nnot show systematic radial or stream motions; therefore, they likely formed\nthrough spontaneous star formation events.

    "abstract": "Language models have shown strong capabilities across a wide range of tasks\nin software engineering, such as code generation, yet they suffer from\nhallucinations. While hallucinations have been studied independently in natural\nlanguage and code generation, their occurrence in tasks involving code changes\nwhich have a structurally complex and context-dependent format of code remains\nlargely unexplored. This paper presents the first comprehensive analysis of\nhallucinations in two critical tasks involving code change to natural language\ngeneration: commit message generation and code review comment generation. We\nquantify the prevalence of hallucinations in recent language models and explore\na range of metric-based approaches to automatically detect them. Our findings\nreveal that approximately 50\\% of generated code reviews and 20\\% of generated\ncommit messages contain hallucinations. Whilst commonly used metrics are weak\ndetectors on their own, combining multiple metrics substantially improves\nperformance. Notably, model confidence and feature attribution metrics\neffectively contribute to hallucination detection, showing promise for\ninference-time detection.\\footnote{All code and data will be released upon\nacceptance.",

    "abstract": "Most prior unsupervised domain adaptation approaches for medical image\nsegmentation are narrowly tailored to either the source-accessible setting,\nwhere adaptation is guided by source-target alignment, or the source-free\nsetting, which typically resorts to implicit supervision mechanisms such as\npseudo-labeling and model distillation. This substantial divergence in\nmethodological designs between the two settings reveals an inherent flaw: the\nlack of an explicit, structured construction of anatomical knowledge that\nnaturally generalizes across domains and settings. To bridge this longstanding\ndivide, we introduce a unified, semantically grounded framework that supports\nboth source-accessible and source-free adaptation. Fundamentally distinct from\nall prior works, our framework's adaptability emerges naturally as a direct\nconsequence of the model architecture, without the need for any handcrafted\nadaptation strategies. Specifically, our model learns a domain-agnostic\nprobabilistic manifold as a global space of anatomical regularities, mirroring\nhow humans establish visual understanding. Thus, the structural content in each\nimage can be interpreted as a canonical anatomy retrieved from the manifold and\na spatial transformation capturing individual-specific geometry. This\ndisentangled, interpretable formulation enables semantically meaningful\nprediction with intrinsic adaptability. Extensive experiments on challenging\ncardiac and abdominal datasets show that our framework achieves\nstate-of-the-art results in both settings, with source-free performance closely\napproaching its source-accessible counterpart, a level of consistency rarely\nobserved in prior works. Beyond quantitative improvement, we demonstrate strong\ninterpretability of the proposed framework via manifold traversal for smooth\nshape manipulation.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge distillation is a long-established technique for knowledge\ntransfer, and has regained attention in the context of the recent emergence of\nlarge vision-language models (VLMs). However, vision-language knowledge\ndistillation often requires sufficient training data to achieve robust\ngeneralization on amples with ambiguous or boundary-adjacent representations,\nwhich are associated with high predictive uncertainty. Critically, collecting\nsuch large-scale, task-specific data for training is often impractical in\nreal-world scenarios. To address this major challenge arising from the\nentanglement of uncertainty and cross-modal feature representation, we propose\nAligned Manifold Entropy for Robust Vision-Language Distillation (AME), aiming\nto achieve robust generalization under real-world conditions. AME applies\nentropy minimization over a reconfigured shared manifold, where multi-modal\ndata (i.e., image and text) are bridged through a pair of projection functions,\nconducive to structural compression for cross-modal feature representations.\nThis enables robust knowledge distillation under low-data regimes, while\nrequiring no architectural modifications to the backbone. As a result, it can\nserve as a plug-and-play module compatible with a wide range of vision-language\ndistillation frameworks. Notably, our theoretical analysis reveals that\nintegrating knowledge distillation with entropy minimization over the shared\nmanifold leads to a tighter generalization error bound. Extensive experiments\nacross diverse distillation architectures and training settings demonstrate\nthat AME consistently facilitates robust knowledge distillation, resulting in\nsuperior generalization performance across a wide spectrum of downstream tasks.",

MiGrATe operates via a mixed-policy group construction procedure that\ncombines on-policy sampling with two off-policy data selection techniques:\ngreedy sampling, which selects top-performing past completions, and\nneighborhood sampling (NS), which generates completions structurally similar to\nhigh-reward ones. Together, these components bias the policy gradient towards\nexploitation of promising regions in solution space, while preserving\nexploration through on-policy sampling. We evaluate MiGrATe on three\nchallenging domains-word search, molecule optimization, and hypothesis+program\ninduction on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC)-and find that it\nconsistently outperforms both inference-only and TTT baselines, demonstrating\nthe potential of online TTT as a solution for complex search tasks without\nexternal supervision.",

    "abstract": "Despite the rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs), their application\nin agriculture remains limited due to the lack of domain-specific models,\ncurated datasets, and robust evaluation frameworks. To address these\nchallenges, we propose AgriGPT, a domain-specialized LLM ecosystem for\nagricultural usage. At its core, we design a multi-agent scalable data engine\nthat systematically compiles credible data sources into Agri-342K, a\nhigh-quality, standardized question-answer (QA) dataset. Trained on this\ndataset, AgriGPT supports a broad range of agricultural stakeholders, from\npractitioners to policy-makers. To enhance factual grounding, we employ\nTri-RAG, a three-channel Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework combining\ndense retrieval, sparse retrieval, and multi-hop knowledge graph reasoning,\nthereby improving the LLM's reasoning reliability. For comprehensive\nevaluation, we introduce AgriBench-13K, a benchmark suite comprising 13 tasks\nwith varying types and complexities. Experiments demonstrate that AgriGPT\nsignificantly outperforms general-purpose LLMs on both domain adaptation and\nreasoning. Beyond the model itself, AgriGPT represents a modular and extensible\nLLM ecosystem for agriculture, comprising structured data construction,\nretrieval-enhanced generation, and domain-specific evaluation. This work\nprovides a generalizable framework for developing scientific and\nindustry-specialized LLMs. All models, datasets, and code will be released to\nempower agricultural communities, especially in underserved regions, and to\npromote open, impactful research.",

From one observation of each star, our search\nalgorithm identified a total of 285 spectral peaks with line widths slightly\nlarger than the instrument's point-spread function. After eliminating false\npositives (including cosmic rays, instrumental artifacts, and terrestrial\nairglow lines, we identified 8 sources worthy of follow-up observations. We\nthen analyzed all 1,835 additional observations of these follow-up targets,\nlooking for recurring signals. We found 1 additional unexplained candidate in\nthis followup search, but no candidate spikes which repeated at the same\nwavelength as one of the initial candidates at a later time. Further analysis\nidentified one candidate as a likely faint airglow line. The remaining seven\ncandidates continued to defy all false positive categories, including\ninterference by LiDAR satellites and adaptive optics lasers from neighboring\nobservatories. However, observations of other stars on the same night showed\nidentical spectral spikes (in the telescope's reference frame) for four of\nthese seven candidates -- indicating an as-yet unknown terrestrial source. This\nleaves 3 final candidates which currently defy the prosaic explanations\nexamined thus far, show no indication of a terrestrial origin and therefore\nwarrant further investigation.

Furthermore, the effective rank of the model's weights tends to\ndecline during training, and this drop is accelerated when the model is\nreparameterized into a low-rank structure.

    "abstract": "Realizing low-cost communication in robotic mixed reality (RoboMR) systems\npresents a challenge, due to the necessity of uploading high-resolution images\nthrough wireless channels. This paper proposes Gaussian splatting (GS) RoboMR\n(GSMR), which enables the simulator to opportunistically render a\nphoto-realistic view from the robot's pose by calling ``memory'' from a GS\nmodel, thus reducing the need for excessive image uploads. However, the GS\nmodel may involve discrepancies compared to the actual environments. To this\nend, a GS cross-layer optimization (GSCLO) framework is further proposed, which\njointly optimizes content switching (i.e., deciding whether to upload image or\nnot) and power allocation (i.e., adjusting to content profiles) across\ndifferent frames by minimizing a newly derived GSMR loss function. The GSCLO\nproblem is addressed by an accelerated penalty optimization (APO) algorithm\nthat reduces computational complexity by over $10$x compared to traditional\nbranch-and-bound and search algorithms. Moreover, variants of GSCLO are\npresented to achieve robust, low-power, and multi-robot GSMR. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that the proposed GSMR paradigm and GSCLO method\nachieve significant improvements over existing benchmarks on both wheeled and\nlegged robots in terms of diverse metrics in various scenarios.

This paper presents a multi-scale\njoint perimeter control and route guidance (MSJC) framework for controlling\ntraffic in large-scale networks. The network is first partitioned into several\nsubnetworks (regions) with traffic in each region governed by its macroscopic\nfundamental diagram (MFD), which forms the macroscale network (upper level).\nEach subnetwork, comprised of actual road links and signalized intersections,\nforms the microscale network (lower level). At the upper level, a joint\nperimeter control and route guidance model solves the region-based inflow rate\nand hyper-path flows to control the accumulation of each region and thus\nmaximize the throughput of each region. At the lower level, a perimeter control\nstrategy integrated with a backpressure policy determines the optimal signal\nphases of the intersections at the regional boundary. At the same time, a route\nchoice model for vehicles is constructed to meet hyper-path flows and ensure\nthe intra-region homogeneity of traffic density.

To resolve these\nchallenges, we develop a novel Hierarchical Visual Prompt Learning (HVPL) model\nthat overcomes catastrophic forgetting of previous categories from both\nframe-level and video-level perspectives. Specifically, to mitigate forgetting\nat the frame level, we devise a task-specific frame prompt and an orthogonal\ngradient correction (OGC) module. The OGC module helps the frame prompt encode\ntask-specific global instance information for new classes in each individual\nframe by projecting its gradients onto the orthogonal feature space of old\nclasses. Furthermore, to address forgetting at the video level, we design a\ntask-specific video prompt and a video context decoder. This decoder first\nembeds structural inter-class relationships across frames into the frame prompt\nfeatures, and then propagates task-specific global video contexts from the\nframe prompt features to the video prompt. Through rigorous comparisons, our\nHVPL model proves to be more effective than baseline approaches. The code is\navailable at https://github.com/JiahuaDong/HVPL.",

First,\nto train the deblurring model, we extract the sharp clues from the video and\ntake them as misalignment labels of neighboring blurry frames. Second, to\nimprove the model's ability, we propose a novel Self-Enhanced Video Deblurring\n(SEVD) method to create higher-quality paired video data. Third, we propose a\nSelf-Constrained Spatial Consistency Maintenance (SCSCM) method to regularize\nthe model, preventing position shifts between the output and input frames.\nMoreover, we construct a synthetic and a real-world handheld video dataset for\nhandheld video deblurring. Extensive experiments on these two and other common\nreal-world datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms\nexisting self-supervised ones. The code and datasets are publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/cshonglei/SelfHVD.",

    "abstract": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been widely used in various visual\nrecognition tasks due to their remarkable generalization capabilities. As these\nmodels grow in size and complexity, fine-tuning becomes costly, emphasizing the\nneed to reuse adaptation knowledge from 'weaker' models to efficiently enhance\n'stronger' ones. However, existing adaptation transfer methods exhibit limited\ntransferability across models due to their model-specific design and high\ncomputational demands. To tackle this, we propose Transferable Model-agnostic\nadapter (TransMiter), a light-weight adapter that improves vision-language\nmodels 'without backpropagation'. TransMiter captures the knowledge gap between\npre-trained and fine-tuned VLMs, in an 'unsupervised' manner. Once trained,\nthis knowledge can be seamlessly transferred across different models without\nthe need for backpropagation. Moreover, TransMiter consists of only a few\nlayers, inducing a negligible additional inference cost. Notably, supplementing\nthe process with a few labeled data further yields additional performance gain,\noften surpassing a fine-tuned stronger model, with a marginal training cost.\nExperimental results and analyses demonstrate that TransMiter effectively and\nefficiently transfers adaptation knowledge while preserving generalization\nabilities across VLMs of different sizes and architectures in visual\nrecognition tasks.",

They are expected to exist in half-Heusler correlated topological\nsemimetals. However, the emergence of hole carriers, which alter the chemical\npotential away from the quadratic-band-touching points is not yet understood.\nHere, we investigated the electronic structure of YPtBi and GdPtBi through ab\ninitio many-body perturbation GW theory combined with dynamical mean-field\ntheory and revealed that the correlation effects of 4$d$ or 4$f$ electrons can\nlead to the formation of hole carriers. In YPtBi, the weakly correlated Y-4$d$\nelectrons constitute the topological bands, and the quadratic-band-touching\npoint is at the Fermi level at high temperatures. At low temperatures, enhanced\ncorrelations of Y-4$d$ renormalize the topological bands, leading to the\nformation of hole pocket. In GdPtBi, the strongly correlated Gd-4$f$ electrons\nform the Hubbard-like bands originate from self-energy effects associated with\na topological singularity. These local bands encompass itinerant 4$f$ bands,\nwhich hybridize with topological bands to induce pronounced hole bands. This\nconcerted effect reduces the hole doping, bringing the chemical potential\ncloser to the quadratic-band-touching points as the temperature is lowered. The\ntemperature-induced Lifshitz transition should be responsible for the large\nhole bands observed in both topological semimetals in angle-resolved\nphotoemission spectroscopy measurements at low temperatures. Our findings\nindicate that the integration of correlated fermions within a topological\nframework can modulate the energy landscape of topological bands.",

    "abstract": "Reconstructing the density matrix of the quantum state of photons through a\ntomographically complete set of measurements, known as quantum state\ntomography, is an essential task in nearly all applications of quantum science\nand technology, from quantum sensing to quantum communications. Recent advances\nin optical metasurfaces enable the design of ultra-thin nanostructured optical\nelements performing such state tomography tasks, promising greater simplicity,\nminiaturization, and scalability. However, reported metasurfaces on this goal\nwere limited to a small Hilbert dimension, e.g., polarization qubits or spatial\nqudits with only a few states. When scaling up to higher-dimensional qudit\ntomography problems, especially those involving spatial qudits, a natural\nquestion arises: whether a metasurface with randomized nanostructures is\nsufficient to perform such qudit tomography, achieving optimal conditions. In\nthis work, we attempt to answer this question through a set of numerical\nexperiments with random metasurfaces, utilizing large-scale simulations of over\n11,000 distinct metasurfaces each exceeding 200 wavelengths in size. We show\nthat with sufficient redundancy in the number of detectors, random metasurfaces\nperform reasonably well in quantum photonic spatial qudit tomography encoded in\nHermite-Gaussian states for up to approximately 10 states.

Sparsity\nin features or target data of the training dataset can be handled using various\ninterpolation methods, such as linear or polynomial interpolation, spline,\nmoving average, or can be simply imputed. Interpolation methods usually perform\nwell with Strict Sense Stationary (SSS) data. In this study, we show that an\napproximately 62\\% sparse dataset with hourly load data of a power plant can be\nutilized for load forecasting assuming the data is Wide Sense Stationary (WSS),\nif augmented with Gaussian interpolation. More specifically, we perform\nstatistical analysis on the data, and train multiple machine learning and deep\nlearning models on the dataset. By comparing the performance of these models,\nwe empirically demonstrate that Gaussian interpolation is a suitable option for\ndealing with load forecasting problems. Additionally, we demonstrate that Long\nShort-term Memory (LSTM)-based neural network model offers the best performance\namong a diverse set of classical and neural network-based models.",

Although DETR-based methods have\nrecently emerged as the mainstream framework for HOI detection, they still\nsuffer from a key limitation: Randomly initialized queries lack explicit\nsemantics, leading to suboptimal detection performance. To address this\nchallenge, we propose QueryCraft, a novel plug-and-play HOI detection framework\nthat incorporates semantic priors and guided feature learning through\ntransformer-based query initialization. Central to our approach is\n\\textbf{ACTOR} (\\textbf{A}ction-aware \\textbf{C}ross-modal\n\\textbf{T}ransf\\textbf{OR}mer), a cross-modal Transformer encoder that jointly\nattends to visual regions and textual prompts to extract action-relevant\nfeatures. Rather than merely aligning modalities, ACTOR leverages\nlanguage-guided attention to infer interaction semantics and produce\nsemantically meaningful query representations. To further enhance object-level\nquery quality, we introduce a \\textbf{P}erceptual \\textbf{D}istilled\n\\textbf{Q}uery \\textbf{D}ecoder (\\textbf{PDQD}), which distills object category\nawareness from a pre-trained detector to serve as object query initiation. This\ndual-branch query initialization enables the model to generate more\ninterpretable and effective queries for HOI detection.

We propose a hierarchical traffic signal coordination and\ncontrol scheme that integrates model-based optimization with reinforcement\nlearning. The system consists of: (i) a High-Level Coordinator (HLC) that\nselects coordination strategies based on observed and predicted demand; (ii) a\nCorridor Coordinator that derives phase constraints from the selected\nstrategy-either Max-Flow Coordination (MFC) or Green-Wave Coordination (GWC);\nand (iii) Hybrid Signal Agents (HSAs) that determine signal phases via\nreinforcement learning with action masking to enforce feasibility. Hierarchical\nreinforcement learning with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is used to train\nHSA and HLC policies. At the lower level, three HSA policies-MFC-aware,\nGWC-aware, and pure agent control (PAC) are trained in conjunction with their\nrespective coordination strategies. At the higher level, the HLC is trained to\ndynamically switch strategies using a multi-objective reward balancing\ncorridor-level and network-wide performance. The proposed scheme was developed\nand evaluated on a SUMO-RLlib platform. Case results show that hybrid MFC\nmaximizes throughput under heavy demand; hybrid GWC consistently minimizes\narterial stops and maintains progression across diverse traffic conditions but\ncan reduce network-wide efficiency; and PAC improves network-wide travel time\nin moderate demand but is less effective under heavy demand.

Existing methods use fixed Chain-of-Thought\n(CoT) reasoning with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) but suffer from catastrophic\nforgetting, poor adaptability, and limited generalization across domain tasks.\nIn this paper, we propose DocThinker, a rule-based Reinforcement Learning (RL)\nframework for dynamic inference-time reasoning.

Concretely, we first build a ground-aware 3D world coordinate system\nand perform motion editing directly in the 3D space. Trajectory control is\nimplemented by unprojecting edited 2D trajectories into 3D with focal-length\ncalibration and coordinate transformation, followed by speed alignment and\norientation adjustment; actions are supplied by a motion bank or generated via\ntext-to-motion methods. Then, based on modern text-to-video diffusion\ntransformer models, we inject the subject as tokens for full attention,\nconcatenate the background along the channel dimension, and add motion\n(trajectory and action) control signals by addition. Such a design opens up the\npossibility for us to generate realistic videos of anyone doing anything\nanywhere.

Furthermore, the G-Parity combined with\nthe SU(3) gives us a clear picture of the role played by each meson in the kaon\ncondensation. Numerical results show that the presence of anti-kaons severely\ncompromises the stiffening of the EOS by breaking the SU(6) symmetry.",

    "abstract": "Current methods for content safety in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as\nSupervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback\n(RLHF), often rely on multi-stage training pipelines and lack fine-grained,\npost-deployment controllability. To address these limitations, we propose a\nunified co-training framework that efficiently integrates multiple safety\nbehaviors: positive (lawful/prosocial), negative (unfiltered/risk-prone) and\nrejective (refusal-oriented/conservative) within a single SFT stage. Notably,\neach behavior is dynamically activated via a simple system-level instruction,\nor magic token, enabling stealthy and efficient behavioral switching at\ninference time. This flexibility supports diverse deployment scenarios, such as\npositive for safe user interaction, negative for internal red-teaming, and\nrejective for context-aware refusals triggered by upstream moderation signals.\nThis co-training strategy induces a distinct Safety Alignment Margin in the\noutput space, characterized by well-separated response distributions\ncorresponding to each safety mode. The existence of this margin provides\nempirical evidence for the model's safety robustness and enables unprecedented\nfine-grained control. Experiments show that our method matches the safety\nalignment quality of SFT+DPO, with our 8B model notably surpassing DeepSeek-R1\n(671B) in safety performance, while significantly reducing both training\ncomplexity and deployment costs. This work presents a scalable, efficient, and\nhighly controllable solution for LLM content safety.",

Over the past\ntwo decades, efforts to extend the gKYP lemma from LTI systems to linear\nparameter varying (LPV) systems have been hindered by the intricate\ntime-frequency inter-modulation effect between the input signal and the\ntime-varying scheduling parameter. A key element in this framework is the\nfrequency-dependent Integral Quadratic Constraint (IQC) function, which enables\ntime-domain interpretation of the gKYP lemma, as demonstrated by Iwasaki et al\nin their companion 2005 System and Control Letter paper. The non-negativity\nproperty of this IQC function plays a crucial role in characterizing system\nbehavior under frequency-limited inputs. In this paper, we first demonstrate\nthrough a counterexample that the IQC non-negativity property may fail for LPV\nsystems, thereby invalidating existing results that rely on this assumption. To\naddress this issue, we propose a reformulation strategy that replaces the\noriginal frequency range with an enlarged one, thereby restoring the\nnon-negativity property for LPV systems. Moreover, we establish that the\nminimal required expansion depends on the interaction(or gap) between the\nsystem poles and the original frequency range, as well as a set of\ncontrollability Gramians. Building upon this results, an extension of gKYP\nlemma is presented, which allows us to conduct finite-frequency analysis of LPV\nsystems in a direct and reliable manner. The potential and efficiency compared\nto existing results are demonstrated through numerical examples.",

    "abstract": "A very few three-dimensional (3D) periodic orbits of general three-body\nproblem (with three finite masses) have been discovered since Newton mentioned\nit in 1680s. Using a high-accuracy numerical strategy we discovered 10,059\nthree-dimensional periodic orbits of the three-body problem in the cases of\n$m_{1}=m_{2}=1$ and $m_{3}=0.1n$ where $1\\leq n\\leq 20$ is an integer, among\nwhich 1,996 (about 20\\%) are linearly stable. Note that our approach is valid\nfor arbitrary mass $m_{3}$ so that in theory we can gain an arbitrarily large\namount of 3D periodic orbits of the three-body problem. In the case of three\nequal masses, we discovered twenty-one 3D ``choerographical'' periodic orbits\nwhose three bodies move periodically in a single closed orbit. It is very\ninteresting that, in the case of two equal masses, we discovered 273\nthree-dimensional periodic orbits with the two bodies ($m_{1}=m_{2}=1$) moving\nalong a single closed orbit and the third ($m_{3}\\neq 1$) along a different\none: we name them ``piano-trio'' orbits, like a trio for two violins and one\npiano. To the best of our knowledge, all of these 3D periodic orbits have never\nbeen reported, indicating the novelty of this work. The large amount of these\nnew 3D periodic orbits are helpful for us to have better understandings about\nchaotic properties of the famous three-body problem, which ``are, so to say,\nthe only opening through which we can try to penetrate in a place which, up to\nnow, was supposed to be inaccessible'', as pointed out by Poincar\\'e, the\nfounder of chaos theory.",

Specifically, the noisy nanopore channel (NNC) with\nthe Scrappie pore model generates average output levels via i.i.d. geometric\nsample duplications corrupted by i.i.d. Gaussian noise (NNC-Scrappie).\nSimplified message passing algorithms are derived for efficient soft decoding\nof nanopore signals using NNC-Scrappie. Previously, evaluation of this channel\nmodel was limited by the lack of DNA storage datasets with nanopore signals\nincluded. This is solved by deriving an achievable rate based on the dynamic\ntime-warping (DTW) algorithm that can be applied to genomic sequencing datasets\nsubject to constraints that make the resulting rate applicable to DNA storage.\nUsing a publicly-available dataset from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), it\nis demonstrated that coding over multiple DNA strands of $100$ bases in length\nand decoding with the NNC-Scrappie decoder can achieve rates of at least\n$0.64-1.18$ bits per base, depending on the channel quality of the nanopore\nthat is chosen in the sequencing device per channel-use, and $0.96$ bits per\nbase on average assuming uniformly chosen nanopores.

Alt-hough existing algorithms have explored automated LV\nquantification, they can struggle to capture generic visual representations due\nto the normally small training datasets.

However,\nVFMs represented by the segment anything model (SAM) are usually suitable for\nsegmentation but incapable of identifying key anatomical points, which are\ncritical in LV indicator measurements. In this paper, we propose a novel\nframework named AutoSAME, combining the powerful visual understanding of SAM\nwith seg-mentation and landmark localization tasks simultaneously.\nConsequently, the framework mimics the operation of cardiac sonographers,\nachieving LV indi-cator measurements consistent with clinical guidelines.

The gap mainly stems from the\ndiscrepancy between 1) high-quality (HQ) and low-quality (LQ) images and 2)\nsynthesized and real-world images. The vanilla diffusion model is trained on\nimages with no or less degradations, whereas BFR handles moderately to severely\ndegraded images. Additionally, LQ images used for training are synthesized by a\nnaive degradation model with limited degradation patterns, which fails to\nsimulate complex and unknown degradations in real-world scenarios. In this\nwork, we use a unified network FLIPNET that switches between two modes to\nresolve specific gaps. In Restoration mode, the model gradually integrates\nBFR-oriented features and face embeddings from LQ images to achieve authentic\nand faithful face restoration. In Degradation mode, the model synthesizes\nreal-world like degraded images based on the knowledge learned from real-world\ndegradation datasets.

    "abstract": "Federated learning enables distributed training with private data of clients,\nbut its convergence is hindered by data and system heterogeneity in realistic\ncommunication scenarios. Most existing system heterogeneous FL schemes utilize\nglobal pruning or ensemble distillation, yet they often overlook typical\nconstraints required for communication efficiency. Meanwhile, deep ensembles\ncan aggregate predictions from individually trained models to improve\nperformance, but current ensemble-based FL methods fall short in fully\ncapturing the diversity of model predictions. In this work, we propose SHEFL, a\nglobal ensemble-based federated learning framework suited for clients with\ndiverse computational capacities. We allocate different numbers of global\nmodels to clients based on their available resources. We further introduce a\nnovel aggregation scheme that accounts for bias between clients with different\ncomputational capabilities. To reduce the computational burden of training deep\nensembles and mitigate data bias, we dynamically adjust the resource ratio\nacross clients - aggressively reducing the influence of underpowered clients in\nconstrained scenarios, while increasing their weight in the opposite case.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively addresses\ncomputational heterogeneity, significantly improving both fairness and overall\nperformance compared to existing approaches.",

    "abstract": "Spatiotemporal prediction plays a critical role in numerous real-world\napplications such as urban planning, transportation optimization, disaster\nresponse, and pandemic control. In recent years, researchers have made\nsignificant progress by developing advanced deep learning models for\nspatiotemporal prediction. However, most existing models are deterministic,\ni.e., predicting only the expected mean values without quantifying uncertainty,\nleading to potentially unreliable and inaccurate outcomes. While recent studies\nhave introduced probabilistic models to quantify uncertainty, they typically\nfocus on a single phenomenon (e.g., taxi, bike, crime, or traffic crashes),\nthereby neglecting the inherent correlations among heterogeneous urban\nphenomena. To address the research gap, we propose a novel Graph Neural Network\nwith Uncertainty Quantification, termed UQGNN for multivariate spatiotemporal\nprediction. UQGNN introduces two key innovations: (i) an Interaction-aware\nSpatiotemporal Embedding Module that integrates a multivariate diffusion graph\nconvolutional network and an interaction-aware temporal convolutional network\nto effectively capture complex spatial and temporal interaction patterns, and\n(ii) a multivariate probabilistic prediction module designed to estimate both\nexpected mean values and associated uncertainties. Extensive experiments on\nfour real-world multivariate spatiotemporal datasets from Shenzhen, New York\nCity, and Chicago demonstrate that UQGNN consistently outperforms\nstate-of-the-art baselines in both prediction accuracy and uncertainty\nquantification. For example, on the Shenzhen dataset, UQGNN achieves a 5%\nimprovement in both prediction accuracy and uncertainty quantification.",

Log\nlevel choice is an integral, yet tricky part of the logging activity as it\ncontrols log verbosity and therefore influences systems' observability and\nperformance. Recent advances in ML-based log level prediction have leveraged\nlarge language models (LLMs) to propose log level predictors (LLPs) that\ndemonstrated promising performance improvements (AUC between 0.64 and 0.8).\nNevertheless, current LLM-based LLPs rely on randomly selected in-context\nexamples, overlooking the structure and the diverse logging practices within\nmodern software projects.

Recent filtering methods often suffer\nfrom point clustering or noise retaining issues. In this paper, we propose\nHybrid Point Cloud Filtering ($\\textbf{HybridPF}$) that considers both\nshort-range and long-range filtering trajectories when removing noise. It is\nwell established that short range scores, given by $\\nabla_{x}\\log p(x_t)$, may\nprovide the necessary displacements to move noisy points to the underlying\nclean surface. By contrast, long range velocity flows approximate constant\ndisplacements directed from a high noise variant patch $x_0$ towards the\ncorresponding clean surface $x_1$. Here, noisy patches $x_t$ are viewed as\nintermediate states between the high noise variant and the clean patches. Our\nintuition is that long range information from velocity flow models can guide\nthe short range scores to align more closely with the clean points. In turn,\nscore models generally provide a quicker convergence to the clean surface.\nSpecifically, we devise two parallel modules, the ShortModule and LongModule,\neach consisting of an Encoder-Decoder pair to respectively account for\nshort-range scores and long-range flows. We find that short-range scores,\nguided by long-range features, yield filtered point clouds with good point\ndistributions and convergence near the clean surface. We design a joint loss\nfunction to simultaneously train the ShortModule and LongModule, in an\nend-to-end manner. Finally, we identify a key weakness in current displacement\nbased methods, limitations on the decoder architecture, and propose a dynamic\ngraph convolutional decoder to improve the inference process.

Our\nstudy shows that well-controlled bias can significantly accelerate local SGD in\nheterogeneous environments, achieving comparable or even higher accuracy than\nsynchronous SGD with data-parallelism within the same time budget. This\nfundamental parallelization strategy can be readily extended to diverse\nheterogeneous environments, including cloud platforms and multi-node\nhigh-performance computing clusters.",

This estimation involves summing the\ncontributions of each tetrahedron using a direct triple integral over its\nvolume. Although this method does not achieve the same level of accuracy as the\nclassical polyhedral approach, it offers a reasonable degree of precision,\nexpresses the potential in analytical form, significantly reduces computational\ntime, and, due to the simplified algebraic manipulation of the potential,\nfacilitates the analysis of the asteroid's internal structural composition.",

This research addresses this challenge of data scarcity by\nleveraging parallel textline images - pairs of original Kindai text and their\ncounterparts in contemporary Japanese fonts - to augment training datasets. We\nintroduce a distance-based objective function that minimizes the gap between\nself-attention features of the parallel image pairs. Specifically, we explore\nEuclidean distance and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) as domain adaptation\nmetrics. Experimental results demonstrate that our method reduces the character\nerror rate (CER) by 2.23% and 3.94% over a Transformer-based OCR baseline when\nusing Euclidean distance and MMD, respectively. Furthermore, our approach\nimproves the discriminative quality of self-attention representations, leading\nto more effective OCR performance for historical documents.",

    "abstract": "While relativistic magnetic reconnection in pair plasmas has emerged in\nrecent years as a candidate for the origin of radiation from extreme\nastrophysical environments, the corresponding subrelativistic pair plasma\nregime has remained less explored, leaving open the question of how\nrelativistic physics affects reconnection. In this paper, we investigate the\ndifferences between these regimes by contrasting 2D particle-in-cell\nsimulations of reconnection in pair plasmas with relativistic magnetization\n($\\sigma \\gg 1$) and subrelativistic magnetization ($\\sigma < 1$). By utilizing\nunprecedentedly large domain sizes and outflow boundary conditions, we\ndemonstrate that lowering the magnetization results in a change in the\nreconnection geometry from a plasmoid chain to a Petschek geometry, where\nlaminar exhausts bounded by slow-mode shocks emanate from a single diffusion\nregion. We attribute this change to the reduced plasmoid production rate in the\nlow-$\\sigma$ case: when the secondary tearing rate is sufficiently low,\nplasmoids are too few in number to prevent the system from relaxing into a\nstable Petschek configuration. This geometric change also affects particle\nenergization: we show that while high-$\\sigma$ plasmoid chains generate\npower-law energy spectra, low-$\\sigma$ Petschek exhausts merely heat incoming\nplasma and yield negligible nonthermal acceleration. These results have\nimplications for predicting the global current sheet geometry and the resulting\nenergy spectrum in a variety of systems.",
