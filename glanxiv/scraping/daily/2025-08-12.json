    "abstract": "Social identity theory (SIT) and social categorization theory (SCT) are two\nfacets of the social identity approach (SIA) to understanding social phenomena.\nSIT and SCT are models that describe and explain how people interact with one\nanother socially, connecting the individual to the group through an\nunderstanding of underlying psychological mechanisms and intergroup behaviour.\nSIT, originally developed in the 1970s, and SCT, a later, more general\noffshoot, have been broadly applied to a range of social phenomena among\npeople. The rise of increasingly social machines embedded in daily life has\nspurned efforts on understanding whether and how artificial agents can and do\nparticipate in SIA activities. As agents like social robots and chatbots\npowered by sophisticated large language models (LLMs) advance, understanding\nthe real and potential roles of these technologies as social entities is\ncrucial. Here, I provide a primer on SIA and extrapolate, through case studies\nand imagined examples, how SIT and SCT can apply to artificial social agents. I\nemphasize that not all human models and sub-theories will apply. I further\nargue that, given the emerging competence of these machines and our tendency to\nbe taken in by them, we experts may need to don the hat of the uncanny killjoy,\nfor our own good.",

    "abstract": "Whether and how to govern AI is no longer a question of technical regulation.\nIt is a question of constitutional authority. Across jurisdictions, algorithmic\nsystems now perform functions once reserved to public institutions: allocating\nwelfare, determining legal status, mediating access to housing, employment, and\nhealthcare. These are not merely administrative operations. They are acts of\nrule. Yet the dominant models of AI governance fail to confront this reality.\nThe European approach centers on rights-based oversight, presenting its\nregulatory framework as a principled defense of human dignity. The American\nmodel relies on decentralized experimentation, treating fragmentation as a\nproxy for democratic legitimacy. Both, in different ways, evade the structural\nquestion: who authorizes algorithmic power, through what institutions, and on\nwhat terms. This Article offers an alternative. Drawing from early modern\nReformed political thought, it reconstructs a constitutional framework grounded\nin covenantal authority and the right of lawful resistance. It argues that\nalgorithmic governance must rest on three principles. First, that all public\npower must be lawfully delegated through participatory authorization. Second,\nthat authority must be structured across representative communities with the\nstanding to consent, contest, or refuse. Third, that individuals retain a\nconstitutional right to resist systems that impose orthodoxy or erode the\ndomain of conscience. These principles are then operationalized through\ndoctrinal analysis of federalism, nondelegation, compelled speech, and\nstructural accountability. On this view, the legitimacy of algorithmic\ngovernance turns not on procedural safeguards or policy design, but on whether\nit reflects a constitutional order in which power is authorized by the\ngoverned, constrained by law, and answerable to those it affects.",

In\nthis work, we derive from first principles the three proposed clusters in this\nregion, refine the membership list and cluster ages, and, for the first time,\nexamine the 3D structure, motion, and origin of the clusters. Using clustering\nof Gaia data in 3D position + 2D velocity space, supplemented by available\nSDSS-V radial velocities, we find the clusters of ages 10, 15.8, and 20 Myr\nwith members numbering 140, 469, and 184, respectively. All three clusters\noverlap currently in 3D space. Tracing their previous location, based on\npresent-day motions, shows that each cluster originated in its own distinct\nregion and exhibited no influence on each other's formation. Two of the\nclusters trace their origin to different areas within the Cam OB1 association,\nwith the oldest cluster tracing its origins to the near edge of the Perseus\narm, in the direction of the Per OB1 or Cas 0B6 associations.

We identify an analogous issue, search-time\ncontamination (STC), in evaluating search-based LLM agents which use tools to\ngather information from online sources when answering user queries. STC occurs\nwhen the retrieval step surfaces a source containing the test question (or a\nnear-duplicate) alongside its answer, enabling agents to copy rather than\ngenuinely infer or reason, undermining benchmark integrity. We find that\nHuggingFace, an online platform hosting evaluation datasets, appears among\nretrieved sources in search based agent logs. Consequently, agents often\nexplicitly acknowledge discovering question answer pairs from HuggingFace\nwithin their reasoning chains. On three commonly used capability benchmarks:\nHumanity's Last Exam (HLE), SimpleQA, and GPQA, we demonstrate that for\napproximately 3% of questions, search-based agents directly find the datasets\nwith ground truth labels on HuggingFace. When millions of evaluation queries\ntarget the same benchmark, even small, repeated leaks can accelerate the\nbenchmark's obsolescence, shortening its intended lifecycle. After HuggingFace\nis blocked, we observe a drop in accuracy on the contaminated subset of\napproximately 15%. We further show through ablation experiments that publicly\naccessible evaluation datasets on HuggingFace may not be the sole source of\nSTC. To this end, we conclude by proposing best practices for benchmark design\nand result reporting to address this novel form of leakage and ensure\ntrustworthy evaluation of search-based LLM agents. To facilitate the auditing\nof evaluation results, we also publicly release the complete logs from our\nexperiments.",

Unlike prior motion transfer methods that rely\non explicit skeletal poses and heuristic cross-identity adjustments, our\napproach encodes multi-granular motion directly from a single image into a\ncompact set of four disentangled latent tokens -- one for facial expression,\none for body pose, and one for each hand. These motion latents are both highly\nexpressive and identity-agnostic, enabling high-fidelity, detailed\ncross-identity motion transfer across subjects with diverse identities, poses,\nand spatial configurations. To achieve this, we introduce a self-supervised,\nend-to-end framework that jointly learns the motion encoder and latent\nrepresentation alongside a DiT-based video generative model, trained on\nlarge-scale, diverse human motion datasets. Motion-identity disentanglement is\nenforced via 2D spatial and color augmentations, as well as synthetic 3D\nrenderings of cross-identity subject pairs under shared poses. Furthermore, we\nguide motion token learning with auxiliary decoders that promote fine-grained,\nsemantically aligned, and depth-aware motion embeddings. Extensive experiments\nshow that X-UniMotion outperforms state-of-the-art methods, producing highly\nexpressive animations with superior motion fidelity and identity preservation.",

    "abstract": "Consistent physical inactivity poses a major global health challenge. Mobile\nhealth (mHealth) interventions, particularly Just-in-Time Adaptive\nInterventions (JITAIs), offer a promising avenue for scalable, personalized\nphysical activity (PA) promotion. However, developing and evaluating such\ninterventions at scale, while integrating robust behavioral science, presents\nmethodological hurdles. The PEARL study was the first large-scale, four-arm\nrandomized controlled trial to assess a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm,\ninformed by health behavior change theory, to personalize the content and\ntiming of PA nudges via a Fitbit app.\n  We enrolled and randomized 13,463 Fitbit users into four study arms: control,\nrandom, fixed, and RL. The control arm received no nudges. The other three arms\nreceived nudges from a bank of 155 nudges based on behavioral science\nprinciples. The random arm received nudges selected at random. The fixed arm\nreceived nudges based on a pre-set logic from survey responses about PA\nbarriers. The RL group received nudges selected by an adaptive RL algorithm. We\nincluded 7,711 participants in primary analyses (mean age 42.1, 86.3% female,\nbaseline steps 5,618.2).\n  We observed an increase in PA for the RL group compared to all other groups\nfrom baseline to 1 and 2 months. The RL group had significantly increased\naverage daily step count at 1 month compared to all other groups: control (+296\nsteps, p=0.0002), random (+218 steps, p=0.005), and fixed (+238 steps,\np=0.002). At 2 months, the RL group sustained a significant increase compared\nto the control group (+210 steps, p=0.0122). Generalized estimating equation\nmodels also revealed a sustained increase in daily steps in the RL group vs.\ncontrol (+208 steps, p=0.002).

In this setting, the Monge problem admits an explicit upper bound\ngiven by an optimization over the stabilizer subgroup of the reference\ndistribution. The reduced problem's dimension scales with that of the\nstabilizing subgroup and, in the tractable cases we study, is either zero or\nfinite. Under mild regularity conditions, a simple algebraic certificate,\nverified at an optimizer of the reduced problem, ensures tightness of the upper\nbound for both the Monge and Kantorovich formulations, with the optimal map\nrealized by a single group element.

Focusing on steady-state transport, we study the system's behavior\nunder combined unitary and nonunitary (dephasing and dissipative) effects using\nthe Lindblad quantum master equation. After validating our optimization scheme\non short chains, we extend the study to larger systems where we identify\nsystematic patterns in energy profiles. Our analysis reveals that different\ntypes of energy landscape enhance transport, depending on whether inter-site\ntunneling couplings in the chain are short- or long-range, the existence of\nenvironmental interactions, and the temperature of the environment.

Currently, the\nclassification of these sources remains heavily reliant on visual inspection of\nspectral features, equivalent width measurements, or narrow-/wide-band spectral\nindices. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) methods offer automated\napproaches for spectral typing, which are becoming increasingly important as\nlarge spectroscopic surveys such as Gaia, SDSS, and SPHEREx generate datasets\ncontaining millions of spectra. We investigate the application of ML in\nspectral type classification on low-resolution (R $\\sim$ 120) near-infrared\nspectra of M0--T9 dwarfs obtained with the SpeX instrument on the NASA Infrared\nTelescope Facility. We specifically aim to classify the gravity- and\nmetallicity-dependent subclasses for late-type dwarfs. We used binned fluxes as\ninput features and compared the efficacy of spectral type estimators built\nusing Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbor\n(KNN) models. We tested the influence of different normalizations and analyzed\nthe relative importance of different spectral regions for surface gravity and\nmetallicity subclass classification. Our best-performing model (using KNN)\nclassifies 95.5 $\\pm$ 0.6% of sources to within $\\pm$1 SpT, and assigns surface\ngravity and metallicity subclasses with 89.5 $\\pm$ 0.9% accuracy.

We have a valuation function\n$v:2^U \\to \\mathbb{R}_+$, where $U$ is the set of all items, where $v(S)$\nspecifies the value obtained from set $S$ of items. The entirety of current\nwork on budget-feasible mechanisms has focused on the single-dimensional\nsetting, wherein each player holds a single item $e$ and incurs a private cost\n$c_e$ for supplying item $e$.\n  We introduce multidimensional budget feasible mechanism design: the universe\n$U$ is now partitioned into item-sets $\\{G_i\\}$ held by the different players,\nand each player $i$ incurs a private cost $c_i(S_i)$ for supplying the set\n$S_i\\subseteq G_i$ of items. A budget-feasible mechanism is a mechanism that is\ntruthful, and where the total payment made to the players is at most some given\nbudget $B$. The goal is to devise a budget-feasible mechanism that procures a\nset of items of large value. We obtain the first approximation guarantees for\nmultidimensional budget feasible mechanism design.\n  Our contributions are threefold. First, we prove an impossibility result\nshowing that the standard benchmark used in single-dimensional budget-feasible\nmechanism design, namely the algorithmic optimum is inadequate in that no\nbudget-feasible mechanism can achieve good approximation relative to this. We\nidentify that the chief underlying issue here is that there could be a\nmonopolist which prevents a budget-feasible mechanism from obtaining good\nguarantees. Second, we devise an alternate benchmark, $OPT_{Bench}$, that\nallows for meaningful approximation guarantees, thereby yielding a metric for\ncomparing mechanisms.

    "abstract": "Log parsing is an essential task in log analysis, and many tools have been\ndesigned to accomplish it. Existing log parsers can be categorized into\nstatistic-based and semantic-based approaches. In comparison to semantic-based\nparsers, existing statistic-based parsers tend to be more efficient, require\nlower computational costs, and be more privacy-preserving thanks to on-premise\ndeployment, but often fall short in their accuracy (e.g., grouping or parsing\naccuracy) and generalizability. Therefore, it became a common belief that\nstatistic-based parsers cannot be as effective as semantic-based parsers since\nthe latter could take advantage of external knowledge supported by pretrained\nlanguage models. Our work, however, challenges this belief with a novel\nstatistic-based parser, PIPLUP. PIPLUP eliminates the pre-assumption of the\nposition of constant tokens for log grouping and relies on data-insensitive\nparameters to overcome the generalizability challenge, allowing \"plug and play\"\non given log files. According to our experiments on an open-sourced large log\ndataset, PIPLUP shows promising accuracy and generalizability with the\ndata-insensitive default parameter set. PIPLUP not only outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art statistic-based log parsers, Drain and its variants, but also\nobtains a competitive performance compared to the best unsupervised\nsemantic-based log parser (i.e., LUNAR). Further, PIPLUP exhibits low time\nconsumption without GPU acceleration and external API usage; our simple,\nefficient, and effective approach makes it more practical in real-world\nadoptions, especially when costs and privacy are of major concerns.",

Critically,\nevery LLM tested forms representations that distinctly cluster the abstract\npattern categories within their intermediate layers, although the strength of\nthis clustering scales with their performance on the task. Moderate positive\ncorrelations were observed between the representational geometries of\ntask-optimal LLM layers and human frontal FRPs. These results consistently\ndiverged from comparisons with other EEG measures (response-locked ERPs and\nresting EEG), suggesting a potential shared representational space for abstract\npatterns.

This formulation provides\nmeaningful intermediate rewards, and is straightforward to implement once a\nreference is available. Both the reference trajectories and CLF shaping are\nused only during training, resulting in a lightweight policy at deployment. We\nvalidate our method both in simulation and through extensive real-world\nexperiments on a Unitree G1 robot.

    "abstract": "Parameterizing radiative transfer in means navigating trade-offs between\nphysical accuracy and conceptual clarity. However, currently available schemes\nsit at the extremes of this spectrum: correlated-k schemes are fast and\naccurate but rely on lookup tables which obscure the underlying physics and\nmake such schemes difficult to modify, while gray radiation schemes are\nconceptually straightforward but introduce significant biases in atmospheric\ncirculation. Here we introduce a Simple Spectral Model (SSM) for clear-sky\nlongwave radiative transfer which bridges this `clarity-accuracy' gap. The SSM\naccomplishes this by representing the spectral structure of H$_{2}$O and\nCO$_{2}$ absorption using analytic fits at reference conditions, then uses\nsimple functional forms to extend these fits to different atmospheric\nconditions. This, coupled to a simple, two-stream solver, yields a system of\nsix equations and ten physically-meaningful parameters which can solve for\nclear-sky longwave fluxes given atmospheric profiles of temperature and\nhumidity. When implemented in an idealized aquaplanet GCM, the SSM produces\nzonal-mean climate states which accurately mimic the results using a benchmark\ncorrelated-k code. The SSM also alleviates the significant zonal-mean climate\nbiases associated with using gray radiation, including an improved\nrepresentation of radiative cooling profiles, tropopause structure, jet\ndynamics, and Hadley Cell characteristics both in control climates and in\nresponse to uniform warming. This work demonstrates that even a simple spectral\nrepresentation of atmospheric absorption suffices to capture the essential\nphysics of longwave radiative transfer, and the SSM promises to be a valuable\ntool both for idealized climate modeling, and for teaching radiative transfer\nin the classroom.",

Traditional methods, such\nas Delphi studies, consensus conferences, and systematic guideline synthesis,\noffer structure but face limitations including high panel burden, interpretive\noversimplification, and suppression of conditional nuance. These challenges are\nnow exacerbated by information overload, fragmentation of the evidence base,\nand increasing reliance on publicly available sources that lack expert\nfiltering. This study introduces and evaluates a Human-AI Hybrid Delphi\n(HAH-Delphi) framework designed to augment expert consensus development by\nintegrating a generative AI model (Gemini 2.5 Pro), small panels of senior\nhuman experts, and structured facilitation. The HAH-Delphi was tested in three\nphases: retrospective replication, prospective comparison, and applied\ndeployment in two applied domains (endurance training and resistance and mixed\ncardio/strength training). The AI replicated 95% of published expert consensus\nconclusions in Phase I and showed 95% directional agreement with senior human\nexperts in Phase II, though it lacked experiential and pragmatic nuance. In\nPhase III, compact panels of six senior experts achieved >90% consensus\ncoverage and reached thematic saturation before the final participant. The AI\nprovided consistent, literature-grounded scaffolding that supported divergence\nresolution and accelerated saturation. The HAH-Delphi framework offers a\nflexible, scalable approach for generating high-quality, context-sensitive\nconsensus.

Traditional model-based verification techniques are limited\nin scalability and require access to low-dimensional state models, while\nmodel-free methods often lack reliability guarantees. This paper addresses\nthese limitations by introducing a framework for calibrated safety prediction\nin end-to-end vision-controlled systems, where neither the state-transition\nmodel nor the observation model is accessible. Building on the foundation of\nworld models, we leverage variational autoencoders and recurrent predictors to\nforecast future latent trajectories from raw image sequences and estimate the\nprobability of satisfying safety properties. We distinguish between monolithic\nand composite prediction pipelines and introduce a calibration mechanism to\nquantify prediction confidence. In long-horizon predictions from\nhigh-dimensional observations, the forecasted inputs to the safety evaluator\ncan deviate significantly from the training distribution due to compounding\nprediction errors and changing environmental conditions, leading to\nmiscalibrated risk estimates. To address this, we incorporate unsupervised\ndomain adaptation to ensure robustness of safety evaluation under distribution\nshift in predictions without requiring manual labels. Our formulation provides\ntheoretical calibration guarantees and supports practical evaluation across\nlong prediction horizons. Experimental results on three benchmarks show that\nour UDA-equipped evaluators maintain high accuracy and substantially lower\nfalse positive rates under distribution shift.

Through a\nstatistical analysis of O$^{6+}$, this work provides a comprehensive analysis\nof the velocity and temperature of O$^{6+}$ from 0.3 au to 1 au. The study\nfinds that the O$^{6+}$ relative drift, normalized to the local Alfv\\'en speed,\nand its temperature compared to protons, both decrease with distance from the\nSun and show some speed dependence. The O$^{6+}$ temperature is well fit by a\nsingle temperature adiabatic profile across all wind speeds, suggesting there\nis no significant heating at these heliocentric distances. This is in contrast\nto what is observed for protons and He$^{2+}$. Alfv\\'enic fluctuations, with\nfull 180$^{\\circ}$ field rotation, create momentary negative differential\nstreaming where the speed of O$^{6+}$ trails the protons.

Individuals can strategically adapt to the information gathered\nabout classifiers, which in turn may require algorithms to be re-trained. Which\ncollective dynamics will result from users' adaptation and algorithms'\nretraining? We apply evolutionary game theory to address this question. Our\nframework provides a mathematically rigorous way of treating the problem of\nfeedback loops between collectives of users and institutions, allowing to test\ninterventions to mitigate the adverse effects of strategic adaptation. As a\ncase study, we consider institutions deploying algorithms for credit lending.\nWe consider several scenarios, each representing different interaction\nparadigms. When algorithms are not robust against strategic manipulation, we\nare able to capture previous challenges discussed in the strategic\nclassification literature, whereby users either pay excessive costs to meet the\ninstitutions' expectations (leading to high social costs) or game the algorithm\n(e.g., provide fake information). From this baseline setting, we test the role\nof improving gaming detection and providing algorithmic recourse. We show that\nincreased detection capabilities reduce social costs and could lead to users'\nimprovement; when perfect classifiers are not feasible (likely to occur in\npractice), algorithmic recourse can steer the dynamics towards high users'\nimprovement rates. The speed at which the institutions re-adapt to the user's\npopulation plays a role in the final outcome.

Three experiments were conducted: i) analyzing\nconversational data from healthy vs. depressed subjects (DIAC-WOZ dataset) to\ncompare mapping patterns, ii) applying the method to the GoEmotions dataset and\niii) comparing human-written text with large language model (LLM) responses to\nassess differences in inferred brain activation. Emotional intensity was scored\nvia lexical analysis. Results showed neuroanatomically plausible mappings with\nhigh spatial specificity. Depressed subjects exhibited greater limbic\nengagement tied to negative affect. Discrete emotions were successfully\ndifferentiated. LLM-generated text matched humans in basic emotion distribution\nbut lacked nuanced activation in empathy and self-referential regions (medial\nprefrontal and posterior cingulate cortex).

However, these networks face a critical challenge in continuous\nlearning: catastrophic forgetting, where previously acquired knowledge is\noverwritten when new tasks are learned. This limitation contrasts with the\nhuman brain's ability to retain and integrate both old and new knowledge, aided\nby processes like memory consolidation during sleep through the replay of\nlearned information. To address this challenge in RNNs, here we propose a\nsleep-like replay consolidation (SRC) algorithm for EP-trained RNNs.

In class-incremental learning with SRC\nimplemented after each new task training, the EP-trained multilayer RNN model\n(MRNN-EP) performed significantly better compared to feedforward networks\nincorporating several well-established regularization techniques.

Whereas \\'etendue is conventionally used to characterise the\nthroughput of entire optical systems, the optogeometric factor is localised to\nthe level of a single detector pixel, providing a new way to link scene\nradiance to the radiant flux actually collected by that pixel.\n  Although examples are drawn from infrared thermography, the formulation is\ngeneral and applies equally to visible, ultraviolet, and Xray imaging systems.\n  The underlying radiometric principle is well established: classical\nradiometry already relates radiance, area, and solid angle. The new\ncontribution of this work is to isolate that pixel level term, to name it as\n$F_{\\mathrm{opg}}$, and to derive its explicit forms. In this way,\n$F_{\\mathrm{opg}}$ acts as a compact and universal descriptor of pixel level\nradiometric throughput.\n  The present study builds on an earlier quantitative thermography equation\nthat already expressed the radiant flux collected by an individual pixel. In\nthat formulation, the scene based form of the optogeometric factor was present\nonly implicitly, embedded in the derivation. Here, $F_{\\mathrm{opg}}$ is made\nexplicit as an independent radiometric quantity, providing a more transparent\nand general framework that links pixel level geometry to radiometric\nthroughput.\n  Two formulations of $F_{\\mathrm{opg}}$ are derived: a scene based form,\nexpressed through the pixel footprint area and instantaneous field of view, and\na sensor based form, expressed through the pixel pitch and optical $f$number.\nThey coincide numerically under the paraxial approximation and other conditions\ndiscussed in this work.",

This study aims to model the expected luminosities of the first\nfour Balmer series transitions from Pop. III star-forming halos and assess\ntheir detectability with JWST/NIRSpec across $5 \\leq z \\leq 11$. We use the\nsemi-analytical code A-SLOTH with merger trees constructed from the extended\nPress-Schechter (EPS) formalism and cosmological N-body simulations targeting\nMilky Way-like halos and the halo population in a 8~Mpc$/h$ box. Predicted\nfluxes are compared to JWST detection limits derived from the Exposure Time\nCalculator (ETC) assuming a 10,000 s NIRSpec exposure at a signal-to-noise\nratio of 5. For our default model parameters, Pop.

Among the model parameters that we explore, the ionizing\nphoton escape fraction $f_{\\mathrm{esc,III}}$ has the strongest effect on Pop.\nIII Balmer series fluxes when changed: reducing $f_\\mathrm{esc,III}$ from 0.9\nto 0.1 increases the fluxes by $\\gtrsim$1 order of magnitude. However, even in\nthis case, the lines remain undetectable.\n  Balmer series lines powered by emission from Pop. III stars will be\nundetectable by JWST without strong lensing ($\\mu \\gtrsim 10$).

In MS$^2$ analysis, peptide fragment ion probability\nprediction plays a critical role, enhancing the accuracy of peptide\nidentification from mass spectra as a complement to the intensity information.\nCurrent approaches rely on global statistics of fragmentation, which assumes\nthat a fragment's probability is uniform across all peptides.

To address this gap, we present Pep2Prob, the\nfirst comprehensive dataset and benchmark designed for peptide-specific\nfragment ion probability prediction. The proposed dataset contains fragment ion\nprobability statistics for 608,780 unique precursors (each precursor is a pair\nof peptide sequence and charge state), summarized from more than 183 million\nhigh-quality, high-resolution, HCD MS$^2$ spectra with validated peptide\nassignments and fragmentation annotations.

    "abstract": "Synaptic pruning in biological brains removes weak connections to improve\nefficiency. In contrast, dropout regularization in artificial neural networks\nrandomly deactivates neurons without considering activity-dependent pruning. We\npropose a magnitude-based synaptic pruning method that better reflects biology\nby progressively removing low-importance connections during training.\nIntegrated directly into the training loop as a dropout replacement, our\napproach computes weight importance from absolute magnitudes across layers and\napplies a cubic schedule to gradually increase global sparsity. At fixed\nintervals, pruning masks permanently remove low-importance weights while\nmaintaining gradient flow for active ones, eliminating the need for separate\npruning and fine-tuning phases. Experiments on multiple time series forecasting\nmodels including RNN, LSTM, and Patch Time Series Transformer across four\ndatasets show consistent gains. Our method ranked best overall, with\nstatistically significant improvements confirmed by Friedman tests (p < 0.01).\nIn financial forecasting, it reduced Mean Absolute Error by up to 20% over\nmodels with no or standard dropout, and up to 52% in select transformer models.\nThis dynamic pruning mechanism advances regularization by coupling weight\nelimination with progressive sparsification, offering easy integration into\ndiverse architectures. Its strong performance, especially in financial time\nseries forecasting, highlights its potential as a practical alternative to\nconventional dropout techniques.",

Violations of this assumption\ncan impair the estimation and hypothesis testing of the mediation effect in\nconventional approaches. This study addresses the non-normality issue by\nexplicitly modelling skewed and heavy-tailed error terms within the Bayesian\nmediation framework. Building on the work of Fern\\'andez and Steel (1998), this\nstudy introduces a novel family of distributions, termed the Centred Two-Piece\nStudent $t$ Distribution (CTPT). The new distribution incorporates a skewness\nparameter into the Student t distribution and centres it to have a mean of\nzero, enabling flexible modelling of error terms in Bayesian regression and\nmediation analysis. A class of standard improper priors is employed, and\nconditions for the existence of the posterior distribution and posterior\nmoments are established, while enabling inference on both skewness and tail\nparameters. Simulation studies are conducted to examine parameter recovery\naccuracy and statistical power in testing mediation effects. Compared to\ntraditional Bayesian and frequentist methods, particularly bootstrap-based\napproaches, our method gives greater statistical power when correctly\nspecified, while maintaining robustness against model misspecification. The\napplication of the proposed approach is illustrated through real data analysis.\nAdditionally, we have developed an R package FlexBayesMed to implement our\nmethods in linear regression and mediation analysis, available at\nhttps://github.com/Zongyu-Li/FlexBayesMed.",

Existing vision-only methods for 3D\nsemantic occupancy prediction commonly rely on dense 3D voxels, which incur\nhigh communication costs, or 2D planar features, which require accurate depth\nestimation or additional supervision, limiting their applicability to\ncollaborative scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose the first\napproach leveraging sparse 3D semantic Gaussian splatting for collaborative 3D\nsemantic occupancy prediction. By sharing and fusing intermediate Gaussian\nprimitives, our method provides three benefits: a neighborhood-based\ncross-agent fusion that removes duplicates and suppresses noisy or inconsistent\nGaussians; a joint encoding of geometry and semantics in each primitive, which\nreduces reliance on depth supervision and allows simple rigid alignment; and\nsparse, object-centric messages that preserve structural information while\nreducing communication volume. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our\napproach outperforms single-agent perception and baseline collaborative methods\nby +8.42 and +3.28 points in mIoU, and +5.11 and +22.41 points in IoU,\nrespectively.

We present multiple parametric cut patterns to show that\nrigidity can be increased both under symmetric and asymmetric loads.

Moreover, the distance\nbetween the supports also plays a crucial role, namely, the rigidity gain\nvanishes when the supports are too far apart.

To address this gap, we propose a new benchmark, KnowDR-REC,\ncharacterized by three key features: Firstly, it is built upon real-world\nknowledge, requiring fine-grained multimodal reasoning across text and image.\nSecondly, the dataset includes elaborately constructed negative samples via\nfine-grained expression editing, designed to evaluate a model's robustness and\nanti-hallucination ability. Lastly, we introduce three novel evaluation metrics\nto systematically explore the model's internal reasoning process. We evaluate\n16 state-of-the-art multimodal models on KnowDR-REC, with experimental results\nshowing that existing MLLMs still struggle with knowledge-driven visual\ngrounding tasks. Furthermore, we observe a decoupling between textual\nunderstanding and visual grounding in MLLMs, where many models are\nsignificantly influenced by memorized shortcut correlations, which severely\naffect their behavior on our benchmark and hinder genuine multimodal reasoning.\nWe anticipate that the proposed benchmark will inspire future research towards\ndeveloping more robust, interpretable, and knowledge-intensive visual grounding\nframeworks, driving the development of more reliable and robust multimodal\nsystems for complex real-world scenarios.",

Such decisions influence the\nfuture behavior of the UAV, which is expressed as the path plan. Thus,\ndecision-making in path planning is an enabling technique for deploying\nautonomous UAVs in real-world applications. This survey provides an overview of\nexisting studies that use aspects of decision-making in path planning,\npresenting the research strands for Exploration Path Planning and Informative\nPath Planning, and focusing on characteristics of how data have been modeled\nand understood.

    "abstract": "Reasoning-augmented search agents such as Search-R1, trained via\nreinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), demonstrate remarkable\ncapabilities in multi-step information retrieval from external knowledge\nsources. These agents address the limitations of their parametric memory by\ndynamically gathering relevant facts to address complex reasoning tasks.\nHowever, existing approaches suffer from a fundamental architectural\nlimitation: they process search queries strictly sequentially, even when\nhandling inherently parallelizable and logically independent comparisons. This\nsequential bottleneck significantly constrains computational efficiency,\nparticularly for queries that require multiple entity comparisons. To address\nthis critical limitation, we propose ParallelSearch, a novel reinforcement\nlearning framework that empowers large language models (LLMs) to recognize\nparallelizable query structures and execute multiple search operations\nconcurrently. Our approach introduces dedicated reward functions that\nincentivize the identification of independent query components while preserving\nanswer accuracy through jointly considering correctness, query decomposition\nquality, and parallel execution benefits. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate\nthat ParallelSearch outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by an average\nperformance gain of 2.9% across seven question-answering benchmarks. Notably,\non parallelizable questions, our method achieves a 12.7% performance\nimprovement while requiring only 69.6% of the LLM calls compared to sequential\napproaches.",

Here, we generalize our previous treatment to higher\nenergies and derive an analytical expression for the resonant-exchange cross\nsection which depends on a few parameters and accounts not only for the locking\nof phase shifts, but also for their gradual unlocking with increased energy.

    "abstract": "The ability to rapidly adapt to novel and unforeseen environmental changes is\na cornerstone of artificial general intelligence (AGI), yet it remains a\ncritical blind spot in most existing AI benchmarks. Traditional evaluation\nlargely focuses on optimizing performance within fixed environments, failing to\nassess systems' flexibility and generalization capabilities when faced with\neven subtle rule or structural modifications. Addressing this gap, I introduce\nthe Othello AI Arena, a novel benchmark framework designed to evaluate\nintelligent systems based on their capacity for limited-time adaptation to\nunseen environments. Our platform poses a meta-learning challenge: participants\nmust develop systems that can analyze the specific configuration and rules of a\nnovel Othello board within a strict time limit (60 seconds) and generate a\ntailored, high-performing strategy for that unique environment. With this,\nevaluation of the meta-level intelligence can be separated from the task-level\nstrategy performance. The Arena features a diverse set of game stages,\nincluding public stages for development and private stages with structural and\nrule variations designed to test genuine adaptive and generalization\ncapabilities. Implemented as an accessible web-based platform, the Arena\nprovides real-time visualization, automated evaluation using multi-dimensional\nmetrics, and comprehensive logging for post-hoc analysis. Initial observations\nfrom pilot tests and preliminary student engagements highlight fascinating\npatterns in adaptation approaches, ranging from rapid parameter tuning to\nrudimentary environmental model learning through simulation. The Othello AI\nArena offers a unique educational tool and a valuable research benchmark for\nfostering and evaluating the crucial skill of rapid, intelligent adaptation in\nAI systems.",

    "abstract": "Recommender systems play a critical role in enhancing user experience by\nproviding personalized suggestions based on user preferences. Traditional\napproaches often rely on explicit numerical ratings or assume access to fully\nranked lists of items. However, ratings frequently fail to capture true\npreferences due to users' behavioral biases and subjective interpretations of\nrating scales, while eliciting full rankings is demanding and impractical. To\novercome these limitations, we propose a generalized utility-based framework\nthat learns preferences from simple and intuitive pairwise comparisons. Our\napproach is model-agnostic and designed to optimize for arbitrary,\ntask-specific utility functions, allowing the system's objective to be\nexplicitly aligned with the definition of a high-quality outcome in any given\napplication. A central contribution of our work is a novel utility-based active\nsampling strategy for preference elicitation. This method selects queries that\nare expected to provide the greatest improvement to the utility of the final\nrecommended outcome. We ground our preference model in the probabilistic\nPlackett-Luce framework for pairwise data. To demonstrate the versatility of\nour approach, we present two distinct experiments: first, an implementation\nusing matrix factorization for a classic movie recommendation task, and second,\nan implementation using a neural network for a complex candidate selection\nscenario in university admissions. Experimental results demonstrate that our\nframework provides a more accurate, data-efficient, and user-centric paradigm\nfor personalized ranking.",

While vision-language\nmodels (VLMs) recently have dramatically improved the semantic accuracy of\npseudo-labels, their geometric quality, particularly bounding box precision,\nremains commonly neglected. To address this issue, we propose a High Box\nQuality Open-Vocabulary 3D Detection (HQ-OV3D) framework, dedicated to generate\nand refine high-quality pseudo-labels for open-vocabulary classes. The\nframework comprises two key components: an Intra-Modality Cross-Validated\n(IMCV) Proposal Generator that utilizes cross-modality geometric consistency to\ngenerate high-quality initial 3D proposals, and an Annotated-Class Assisted\n(ACA) Denoiser that progressively refines 3D proposals by leveraging geometric\npriors from annotated categories through a DDIM-based denoising mechanism.\nCompared to the state-of-the-art method, training with pseudo-labels generated\nby our approach achieves a 7.37% improvement in mAP on novel classes,\ndemonstrating the superior quality of the pseudo-labels produced by our\nframework.

To address this bothering limitation, we propose a modification that\nincorporates a tuning parameter. This parameter, greater than one, assigns\nappropriate weights to the estimators, thereby extending the applicability of\nthe method to the entire censoring range, where p is between zero and one.\nUnder suitable regularity conditions, we establish the consistency and\nasymptotic normality of the proposed estimators. Extensive simulation studies\nreveal a clear improvement over existing methods in terms of bias and mean\nsquared error, particularly in the strong censoring situation. These results\nhighlight the significant practical and theoretical impact of our approach,\noffering a more flexible and accurate framework for tail index estimation under\ncensoring.

Methods: 3D transesophageal echocardiographic images of two\npatients with regurgitant LAVVs were identified from an institutional database.\nCustom code in SlicerHeart was used to segment leaflets, define the annulus,\nand generate patient-specific valve molds. Silicone valve models were\nfabricated and tested in a pulse duplicator under simulated physiological\nconditions. Five unrepaired valves were analyzed for manufacturing consistency,\nand multiple surgical repair techniques were compared for two patient-specific\nmodels. Results: Manufacturing variability was low in annular metrics (CV for\nannular circumference: 2.1; commissural distance: 4.1; annulus height: 14.7)\nbut higher in leaflet closure metrics (billow height: 11.1%; billow volume:\n18.9%; tenting height: 45.9%; tenting volume: 73.5%). In Patient 1, cleft\nclosure and an Alfieri stitch both eliminated the regurgitant orifice area, but\nthe Alfieri stitch resulted in elevated mean pressure gradient (17 mmHg vs. 4-9\nmmHg for other repairs) and deteriorated with repeated loading. In Patient 2,\nno repair eliminated regurgitation entirely; however, combining an 11 mm patch\naugmentation with commissuroplasty reduced regurgitant area to 0.147 cm2, the\nsmallest observed among tested strategies. Conclusion: This study demonstrates\nthe feasibility of a dynamic physical simulation platform for preclinical LAVV\nrepair evaluation. This proof-of-concept work highlights the platform potential\nfor refining repair strategies before clinical application, which may be\nparticularly relevant in small and heterogeneous populations with congenital\nheart disease.",

We compare our simulated polarization products with current\nobservational data from Very Large Array (VLA) and LOw Frequency ARay (LOFAR),\nas well as continuing investigations from our previous work, such as the\ndetectability of the Laing Garrington effect. We also studied the variation of\nmean fractional polarization with cluster mass and jet power. We produce\nsimulated Stokes Q and U channel images and using the Rotation Measure (RM)\nsynthesis technique we create RM maps. These data provide insight into what we\nshould expect of current and future high-resolution polarimetric studies of\nactive galactic nucleus (AGN) outflows as we were able to probe the limitations\nof the RM synthesis technique by comparing it with the RM map direct from our\nsimulations. Highlights of our study include clear reproduction of polarization\nenhancements towards the edges of radio lobes for suitable conditions and a\ndemonstration that complex lobe morphologies with multiple emission and Faraday\nactive regions interspersed as might be expected in some pole-on or perhaps\nprecessing sources should be distinguishable in observations with current\ntechnology. Given that the UPP is our most representative general cluster\natmosphere, these numerical simulations, and the polarimetric properties\nderived from them, represent the most realistic yet for spherically symmetric\natmospheres.",

In this work, we propose a novel,\nexplainable framework for automated KC discovery through pattern-based KCs:\nrecurring structural patterns within student code that capture the specific\nprogramming patterns and language constructs that students must master. Toward\nthis, we train a Variational Autoencoder to generate important representative\npatterns from student code guided by an explainable, attention-based code\nrepresentation model that identifies important correct and incorrect pattern\nimplementations from student code. These patterns are then clustered to form\npattern-based KCs. We evaluate our KCs using two well-established methods\ninformed by Cognitive Science: learning curve analysis and Deep Knowledge\nTracing (DKT). Experimental results demonstrate meaningful learning\ntrajectories and significant improvements in DKT predictive performance over\ntraditional KT methods.

In this paper, we\nstudy how carbon pricing can be used to guide traffic towards equilibria that\nrespect given emission budgets. In particular, we consider a general\nmulti-commodity flow model with flow-dependent externalities. These\nexternalities may represent carbon emissions, entering a priced area, or the\ntraversal of paths regulated by tradable credit schemes.\n  We provide a complete characterization of all flows that can be attained as\nWardrop equilibria when assigning a single price to each externality. More\nprecisely, we show that every externality budget achievable by any feasible\nflow in the network can also be achieved as a Wardrop equilibrium by setting\nappropriate prices. For extremal and Pareto-minimal budgets, we show that there\nare prices such that all equilibria respect the budgets. Although the proofs of\nexistence of these particular prices rely on fixed-point arguments and are\nnon-constructive, we show that in the case where the equilibrium minimizes a\nconvex potential, the prices can be obtained as Lagrange multipliers of a\nsuitable convex program. In the case of a single externality, we prove that the\ntotal externality caused by the traffic flow is decreasing in the price. For\nincreasing, continuous, and piecewise affine travel time functions with a\nsingle externality, we give an output-polynomial algorithm that computes all\nequilibria implementable by pricing the externality. Even though there are\nnetworks where the output size is exponential in the input size, we show that\nthe minimal price obeying a given budget can be computed in polynomial time.\nThis allows the efficient computation of the market price of tradable credit\nschemes. Overall, our results show that carbon pricing is a viable and (under\nmild assumptions) tractable approach to achieve all feasible emission goals in\ntraffic networks.",

In this\nwork, we address these challenges and introduce DQInit, a method that adapts\nvalue function initialization to DRL. DQInit reuses compact tabular Q-values\nextracted from previously solved tasks as a transferable knowledge base. It\nemploys a knownness-based mechanism to softly integrate these transferred\nvalues into underexplored regions and gradually shift toward the agent's\nlearned estimates, avoiding the limitations of fixed time decay. Our approach\noffers a novel perspective on knowledge transfer in DRL by relying solely on\nvalue estimates rather than policies or demonstrations, effectively combining\nthe strengths of jumpstart RL and policy distillation while mitigating their\ndrawbacks.

In particular, the earlier emergence\nof stronger magnetic fields in more massive WDs, compared to older, less\nmassive, and less magnetic ones, can be explained by this framework. This is\nbecause the magnetic boundary at the onset of WD cooling lies deeper in less\nmassive WDs, resulting in a slower and weaker evolution of the surface magnetic\nfield due to increasing electrical conductivity over time. We further show that\nmany of the magnetic field strengths observed across different WD samples can\nbe reproduced if the deep-seated field generated during the main sequence is\ncomparable to predictions from magnetohydrodynamic simulations of\ncore-convective dynamos, or if equipartition provides a valid scaling for the\nmain-sequence dynamo.

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have exhibited state-of-the-art performance\nacross wide-range of domains such as recommender systems, material design, and\ndrug repurposing. Yet message-passing GNNs suffer from over-squashing --\nexponential compression of long-range information from distant nodes -- which\nlimits expressivity. Rewiring techniques can ease this bottleneck; but their\npractical impacts are unclear due to the lack of a direct empirical\nover-squashing metric. We propose a rigorous, topology-focused method for\nassessing over-squashing between node pairs using the decay rate of their\nmutual sensitivity. We then extend these pairwise assessments to four\ngraph-level statistics (prevalence, intensity, variability, extremity).\nCoupling these metrics with a within-graph causal design, we quantify how\nrewiring strategies affect over-squashing on diverse graph- and\nnode-classification benchmarks. Our extensive empirical analyses show that most\ngraph classification datasets suffer from over-squashing (but to various\nextents), and rewiring effectively mitigates it -- though the degree of\nmitigation, and its translation into performance gains, varies by dataset and\nmethod. We also found that over-squashing is less notable in node\nclassification datasets, where rewiring often increases over-squashing, and\nperformance variations are uncorrelated with over-squashing changes. These\nfindings suggest that rewiring is most beneficial when over-squashing is both\nsubstantial and corrected with restraint -- while overly aggressive rewiring,\nor rewiring applied to minimally over-squashed graphs, is unlikely to help and\nmay even harm performance. Our plug-and-play diagnostic tool lets practitioners\ndecide -- before any training -- whether rewiring is likely to pay off.",

We elucidate two false obstacles that have been believed to\nprevent wave CDM haloes from collapsing into black holes (namely \"maximum\nstable mass\" and \"bosenova\") and point out that general-relativistic\ninstabilities (e.g., the non-axisymmetric instability numerically found in\nspinning scalar-field boson stars) could serve as the concrete mechanisms for\ndirect-collapse black holes (DCBHs) born from wave dark matter. Once the MBHs\nformed, star formation bursts in and around the accretion flows, characteristic\nof a special mode in compact regions of high gravitational accelerations.",

    "abstract": "Luminous Red Novae (LRNe) are transients associated with mass ejection during\nstellar mergers and common envelope evolution (CEE). LRNe have the potential to\nilluminate the poorly understood phases of binary evolution leading up to the\nCEE, during the mass ejection phase, and in the immediate aftermath. However,\nthe mechanism responsible for powering LRN light curves and the origin of their\nobserved diversity remain open questions. Here, we perform two-dimensional\nmoving-mesh radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of LRNe that take into account\nhydrogen recombination and relevant opacities. We study a typical high-mass\nstellar merger, which dynamically ejects 2 $M_\\odot$ with a characteristic\nvelocity of 410 km/s. This ejecta collides with 2.7 $M_\\odot$ of equatorially\nconcentrated circumbinary material (CBM) left behind from a prior phase of\nnon-conservative runaway mass transfer. We find that the resulting light curve\nis composed of a short, blue peak followed by a redder, predominantly\nshock-powered plateau with luminosities reaching up to $10^{41}$ erg/s and\ndurations up to 200 days. These luminosities are significantly higher, and the\ndurations much longer, than those produced by a simple spherical ejection of\nthe same mass. They also depend in a complex way on the radial distribution of\nthe CBM. The shock is embedded in the ejecta and its observational signatures\nduring the optically-thick phase are largely hidden. Our results are broadly\ncompatible with observations of the brightest extragalactic LRNe and pave the\nway for the transformation of LRNe into powerful probes of binary evolution.",

It could also be partially due to a small number\nof hot low-metallicity Wolf-Rayet stars ionizing the gas; a small fraction (a\nfew percent) of the ionization could come from an intermediate-mass black hole.\nOur spectroscopy also revealed four 14 micron continuum sources, $\\gtrsim\n30-100$ pc in diameter, three of which were not previously identified.

To address this\nissue, we introduce two complementary methods that exploit temporal\nconsistency: 1) Temporal Self-Consistency Voting, a training-free, test-time\ndecoding strategy that aggregates predictions across denoising steps to select\nthe most consistent output; and 2) a post-training method termed Temporal\nConsistency Reinforcement, which uses Temporal Semantic Entropy (TSE), a\nmeasure of semantic stability across intermediate predictions, as a reward\nsignal to encourage stable generations.

    "abstract": "There is a growing demand for deploying large generative AI models on mobile\ndevices. For recent popular video generative models, however, the Variational\nAutoEncoder (VAE) represents one of the major computational bottlenecks. Both\nlarge parameter sizes and mismatched kernels cause out-of-memory errors or\nextremely slow inference on mobile devices. To address this, we propose a\nlow-cost solution that efficiently transfers widely used video VAEs to mobile\ndevices. (1) We analyze redundancy in existing VAE architectures and get\nempirical design insights. By integrating 3D depthwise separable convolutions\ninto our model, we significantly reduce the number of parameters. (2) We\nobserve that the upsampling techniques in mainstream video VAEs are poorly\nsuited to mobile hardware and form the main bottleneck. In response, we propose\na decoupled 3D pixel shuffle scheme that slashes end-to-end delay. Building\nupon these, we develop a universal mobile-oriented VAE decoder, Turbo-VAED. (3)\nWe propose an efficient VAE decoder training method. Since only the decoder is\nused during deployment, we distill it to Turbo-VAED instead of retraining the\nfull VAE, enabling fast mobile adaptation with minimal performance loss. To our\nknowledge, our method enables real-time 720p video VAE decoding on mobile\ndevices for the first time. This approach is widely applicable to most video\nVAEs. When integrated into four representative models, with training cost as\nlow as $95, it accelerates original VAEs by up to 84.5x at 720p resolution on\nGPUs, uses as low as 17.5% of original parameter count, and retains 96.9% of\nthe original reconstruction quality. Compared to mobile-optimized VAEs,\nTurbo-VAED achieves a 2.9x speedup in FPS and better reconstruction quality on\nthe iPhone 16 Pro. The code and models will soon be available at\nhttps://github.com/hustvl/Turbo-VAED.",

    "abstract": "Adaptive experimental designs have gained popularity in clinical trials and\nonline experiments. Unlike traditional, fixed experimental designs, adaptive\ndesigns can dynamically adjust treatment randomization probabilities and other\ndesign features in response to data accumulated sequentially during the\nexperiment. These adaptations are useful to achieve diverse objectives,\nincluding reducing uncertainty in the estimation of causal estimands or\nincreasing participants' chances of receiving better treatments during the\nexperiment. At the end of the experiment, it is often desirable to answer\ncausal questions from the observed data. However, the adaptive nature of such\nexperiments and the resulting dependence among observations pose significant\nchallenges to providing valid statistical inference and efficient estimation of\ncausal estimands. Building upon the Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimator\n(TMLE) framework tailored for adaptive designs (van der Laan, 2008), we\nintroduce a new Adaptive-Design-Likelihood-based TMLE (ADL-TMLE) to estimate a\nwide class of causal estimands from adaptive experiment data, including the\naverage treatment effect as our primary example. We establish asymptotic\nnormality and semiparametric efficiency of ADL-TMLE under relaxed positivity\nand design stabilization assumptions for adaptive experiments. Motivated by\nthese results, we further propose a novel adaptive design aimed at minimizing\nthe variance of the estimator based on data generated under that design.\nSimulations show that ADL-TMLE demonstrates superior variance-reduction\nperformance across different types of adaptive experiments, and that the\nproposed adaptive design attains lower variance than the standard\nefficiency-oriented adaptive design. Finally, we generalize our framework to\nbroader settings, including those with longitudinal structures.",

Quantum resource theories provide us with an elegant framework for\nstudying these resources quantitatively and rigorously. While numerous\nstate-based quantum resource theories have already been investigated, and to\nsome extent, measurement-based resource theories have also been explored,\ninstrument-based resource theories remain largely unexplored, with only a few\nnotable exceptions. As quantum instruments are devices that provide both the\nclassical outcomes of induced measurements and the post-measurement quantum\nstates, they are quite important, especially for scenarios where multiple\nparties sequentially act on a quantum system. In this work, we study several\ninstrument-based resource theories, namely (1) the resource theory of\ninformation preservability, (2) the resource theory of (strong) entanglement\npreservability, (3) the resource theory of (strong) incompatibility\npreservability, (4) the resource theory of traditional incompatibility, and (5)\nthe resource theory of parallel incompatibility.

We aim to identify and classify BCs using high-precision astrometric\nand kinematic data, and to investigate their physical properties, mutual\ngravitational interactions, and formation rates. Methods. We used a\ncomprehensive star cluster catalog that contains 4,084 high-quality clusters.\nBased on spatial and kinematic proximity, we identified 400 cluster pairs\ninvolving 686 unique clusters. These pairs were classified into three types:\nprimordial BCs, systems formed through tidal capture or resonant trapping, and\nhyperbolic encounter pairs. For each system, we calculated the tidal factor to\nquantify the strength of mutual tidal interaction. Additionally, we constructed\nmulti-cluster systems by identifying transitive connections among cluster\npairs. Results. Among the 400 identified cluster pairs, nearly 60.8% (243\npairs) are probably primordial BCs, exhibiting both similar ages and motions.\nThis supports a scenario where they formed together in the same giant molecular\ncloud. We find that 82.5% of the cluster pairs have strong mutual tidal forces.\nIn addition, 278 star clusters are identified as members of 82 multi-cluster\nsystems, including 27 newly reported groups. Cross-matching with the literature\nconfirms the recovery of previously reported systems and leads to the discovery\nof 268 new cluster pairs. In our sample, about 16.8% of star clusters are\ninvolved in some type of interaction with another cluster, and 9.94% of star\nclusters are likely born in primordial BCs. Conclusions. Our results provide a\ncomprehensive, homogeneously identified sample of Galactic BCs. The high\nfraction of primordial BCs and their mutual tidal interaction suggest that\ncluster formation in pairs is a main outcome of star formation. This work\noffers new observational constraints on the formation and dynamical evolution\nof multiple star cluster systems.",

As tasks grow more challenging, the\nlogic structures embedded in natural language instructions becomes increasingly\nintricate. However, how well LLMs perform on such logic-rich instructions\nremains under-explored. We propose LogicIFGen and LogicIFEval. LogicIFGen is a\nscalable, automated framework for generating verifiable instructions from code\nfunctions, which can naturally express rich logic such as conditionals,\nnesting, recursion, and function calls. We further curate a collection of\ncomplex code functions and use LogicIFGen to construct LogicIFEval, a benchmark\ncomprising 426 verifiable logic-rich instructions. Our experiments demonstrate\nthat current state-of-the-art LLMs still struggle to correctly follow the\ninstructions in LogicIFEval. Most LLMs can only follow fewer than 60% of the\ninstructions, revealing significant deficiencies in the instruction-following\nability. Code and Benchmark: https://github.com/mianzhang/LogicIF",

    "abstract": "Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are increasingly\ndeployed in real-world applications requiring complex, long-horizon workflows.\nHowever, existing benchmarks predominantly focus on atomic tasks that are\nself-contained and independent, failing to capture the long-term contextual\ndependencies and multi-interaction coordination required in realistic\nscenarios. To address this gap, we introduce OdysseyBench, a comprehensive\nbenchmark for evaluating LLM agents on long-horizon workflows across diverse\noffice applications including Word, Excel, PDF, Email, and Calendar. Our\nbenchmark comprises two complementary splits: OdysseyBench+ with 300 tasks\nderived from real-world use cases, and OdysseyBench-Neo with 302 newly\nsynthesized complex tasks. Each task requires agent to identify essential\ninformation from long-horizon interaction histories and perform multi-step\nreasoning across various applications. To enable scalable benchmark creation,\nwe propose HomerAgents, a multi-agent framework that automates the generation\nof long-horizon workflow benchmarks through systematic environment exploration,\ntask generation, and dialogue synthesis. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates\nthat OdysseyBench effectively challenges state-of-the-art LLM agents, providing\nmore accurate assessment of their capabilities in complex, real-world contexts\ncompared to existing atomic task benchmarks. We believe that OdysseyBench will\nserve as a valuable resource for advancing the development and evaluation of\nLLM agents in real-world productivity scenarios.

To bridge this gap, we propose OpenCUA, a comprehensive\nopen-source framework for scaling CUA data and foundation models. Our framework\nconsists of: (1) an annotation infrastructure that seamlessly captures human\ncomputer-use demonstrations; (2) AgentNet, the first large-scale computer-use\ntask dataset spanning 3 operating systems and 200+ applications and websites;\n(3) a scalable pipeline that transforms demonstrations into state-action pairs\nwith reflective long Chain-of-Thought reasoning that sustain robust performance\ngains as data scales. Our end-to-end agent models demonstrate strong\nperformance across CUA benchmarks. In particular, OpenCUA-32B achieves an\naverage success rate of 34.8% on OSWorld-Verified, establishing a new\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) among open-source models and surpassing OpenAI CUA\n(GPT-4o).

We demonstrate two-qubit electron-electron gates and use them to\nperform repeated quantum non-demolition measurements on one of the Er$^{3+}$\nions.

It has since been found that\nsimilar apparent artifacts are also present in the $x-\\lambda$ direction, i.e.,\nacross adjacent slit positions. This is difficult (although not impossible) to\ncorrect with the previous matrix inversion method due to the time variation\nbetween slit positions. We have therefore devised a new method which addresses\nboth $x-\\lambda$ and $y-\\lambda$ artifacts simultaneously by applying\nwavelength dependent shifts at each $x-y$ plane of the spectral cube. This\npaper demonstrates the SPICE data issue, describes the new method, and shows a\ncomparison with the previous one. We explore the time variation of the\ncorrection parameters for the SPICE data and show a clear orbit dependence. The\nresults of the method are significantly higher quality derived Doppler signals,\nwhich we estimate at less than $\\sim$ 5 km/s uncertainty for brighter lines in\nthe absence of other systematics.

We examine the\nmetallicity-dependent dynamical properties of high-[Mg/Fe] stars in the bar\nregion, using samples of low- and high-[Mg/Fe] stars from APOGEE DR17,\ncomplemented by the PIGS catalogue of [Fe/H] $ < -1 $ stars. The mean\nGalactocentric rotational velocity $ \\overline V_\\phi(R) $ is nearly\ncylindrical for both low- and high-[Mg/Fe] stars across the bulge and outer\nbar. $\\overline V_\\phi(R)$ of high-[Mg/Fe] stars with [Fe/H] $ \\ge -0.6 $ is\nsimilar within errors to low-[Mg/Fe] stars in the bulge, and $ 10-20\\% $ lower\nin the outer bar. The mean radial velocity field of these stars exhibits a\nquadrupole pattern similar to low-[Mg/Fe] stars. Orbit integrations in\nrealistic barred Galactic potentials show that these model-independent\nproperties correspond to a peanut bulge in the orbital density distributions\nfor high-[Mg/Fe] stars with [Fe/H] $ \\ge -0.6 $, transitioning toward a more\nspheroidal structure at lower metallicities. Additionally, $ \\overline V_\\phi$\n([Fe/H]) increases steeply as metallicity rises from about [Fe/H] $ \\sim -1.3\n$, resembling the spin-up observed at larger Galactic radii. This is\naccompanied by a transition in the dominant orbit families, from co- and\ncounter-rotating cloud A and $ \\rm x_4 $ orbits at low metallicities to\nco-rotating bar-supporting $ \\rm x_1 $ family tree, box, and cloud A orbits at\nsolar metallicity. Our results strengthen the case that the bulk of the\nhigh-[Mg/Fe] component in the bar region evolved from an alpha-enhanced disc,\nwhile metal-poor stars with [Fe/H] $ < -1 $ trace a more turbulent origin.",

To this\npoint, the term efficiency has been quantified through applications to Spectral\nEfficiency (SE) and Energy Efficiency (EE). In this paper we introduce a new\nsystem metric called Radio Resource Utilization Efficiency (RUE). This metric\nquantifies the efficiency of the available radio resources (Spectrum, Access\nMethod, Time Slots, Data Symbols, etc.) used to deliver future 6G demands. We\ncompare the system performance of Typical Cellular and Cell-Free Massive MIMO\ndeployments as a vehicle to demonstrate the need for this new metric. We begin\nby providing a concise treatment of items impacting SE by introducing three\ncategories: 5G Radio Resources, Practical Limitations (such as channel matrix\nrank deficiency) and Implementation Losses (SINR degradation). For the example\nRadio Access Technology configuration analyzed, we show 5G yields an RUE of 47%\n(revealing significant room for improvement when defining 6G). Practical\nlimitation assumptions are compared to 5G Multi-User MIMO (MU-MIMO)\nmeasurements conducted in a commercialized deployment. SE losses are\ncharacterized to offer guidance to advanced algorithms employing Machine\nLearning (ML) based techniques.

Mapping different galaxy line\nemissions, such as the HI $21$-cm and CO rotational lines via LIM, can reveal\ncomplementary information about the bias with which the line emitters trace the\nunderlying matter distribution and how different astrophysical phenomena affect\nthe clustering pattern of these signals. The stage where the structures in the\ncosmic web merge to form a single connected structure is known as the\npercolation transition. Using mock HI $21$-cm and CO($1-0$) LIM signals in the\npost-reionisation universe, we explore the connectivity of structures through\npercolation analysis and compare it with that of the underlying galaxy\ndistribution. We probe the relative contributions of voids, filaments, and\nsheets to the galaxy density and line intensity maps using a morphological\nmeasure known as the local dimension. The CO($1-0$) map exhibits an increased\nfilamentary behaviour and larger contribution from sheets than the $21$-cm map.\nWe attempt to explain such an emission of the CO($1-0$) line from biased\nenvironments. The upcoming SKA-Mid will produce tomographic intensity maps of\nthe $21$-cm signal at $z \\lesssim 3$ in Band-1. CO maps can be produced at\nthese redshifts in phase 2 of SKA-Mid, where the frequency coverage is expected\nto increase up to $\\sim 50$ GHz. We present forecasts for the recovery of the\nlocal dimensions of these intensity maps contaminated by instrumental noise,\nconsidering SKA-Mid observations.",

While\nnumerous benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate their code generation\nabilities, these benchmarks face several critical limitations. First, they\noften rely on manual annotations, which are time-consuming and difficult to\nscale across different programming languages and problem complexities. Second,\nmost existing benchmarks focus primarily on Python, while the few multilingual\nbenchmarks suffer from limited difficulty and uneven language distribution. To\naddress these challenges, we propose AutoCodeGen, an automated method for\ngenerating high-difficulty multilingual code generation datasets without manual\nannotations. AutoCodeGen ensures the correctness and completeness of test cases\nby generating test inputs with LLMs and obtaining test outputs through a\nmultilingual sandbox, while achieving high data quality through reverse-order\nproblem generation and multiple filtering steps. Using this novel method, we\nintroduce AutoCodeBench, a large-scale code generation benchmark comprising\n3,920 problems evenly distributed across 20 programming languages. It is\nspecifically designed to evaluate LLMs on challenging, diverse, and practical\nmultilingual tasks. We evaluate over 30 leading open-source and proprietary\nLLMs on AutoCodeBench and its simplified version AutoCodeBench-Lite. The\nresults show that even the most advanced LLMs struggle with the complexity,\ndiversity, and multilingual nature of these tasks. Besides, we introduce\nAutoCodeBench-Complete, specifically designed for base models to assess their\nfew-shot code generation capabilities. We hope the AutoCodeBench series will\nserve as a valuable resource and inspire the community to focus on more\nchallenging and practical multilingual code generation scenarios.",

In this\nwork, we explore a new approach that integrates Chain-of-Thought (CoT) with\nformal language. The model interleaves natural language reasoning with\nincremental emission of solver-executable code, producing a hybrid reasoning\ntrace in which critical derivations are expressed in formal language. To teach\nthis behavior at scale, we combine (1) supervised fine-tuning on an 11K newly\ndeveloped synthetic dataset with interleaved natural language reasoning and\nautomatic formalization, and (2) solver-in-the-loop reinforcement learning that\njointly optimizes both the CoT narrative and the resulting program through\noutcome-based rewards. Built on Qwen2.5-VL-7B, our new model, named\nGF-Reasoner, achieves up to 15% accuracy improvements on standard GPS\nbenchmarks, surpassing both 7B-scale peers and the much larger model\nQwen2.5-VL-72B. By exploiting high-order geometric knowledge and offloading\nsymbolic computation to the solver, the generated reasoning traces are\nnoticeably shorter and cleaner. Furthermore, we present a comprehensive\nanalysis of method design choices (e.g., reasoning paradigms, data synthesis,\ntraining epochs, etc.), providing actionable insights for future research.",

    "abstract": "We introduce Chi-Geometry - a library that generates graph data for testing\nand benchmarking GNNs' ability to predict chirality. Chi-Geometry generates\nsynthetic graph samples with (i) user-specified geometric and topological\ntraits to isolate certain types of samples and (ii) randomized node positions\nand species to minimize extraneous correlations. Each generated graph contains\nexactly one chiral center labeled either R or S, while all other nodes are\nlabeled N/A (non-chiral). The generated samples are then combined into a\ncohesive dataset that can be used to assess a GNN's ability to predict\nchirality as a node classification task. Chi-Geometry allows more interpretable\nand less confounding benchmarking of GNNs for prediction of chirality in the\ngraph samples which can guide the design of new GNN architectures with improved\npredictive performance. We illustrate Chi-Geometry's efficacy by using it to\ngenerate synthetic datasets for benchmarking various state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nGNN architectures. The conclusions of these benchmarking results guided our\ndesign of two new GNN architectures. The first GNN architecture established\nall-to-all connections in the graph to accurately predict chirality across all\nchallenging configurations where previously tested SOTA models failed, but at a\ncomputational cost (both for training and inference) that grows quadratically\nwith the number of graph nodes. The second GNN architecture avoids all-to-all\nconnections by introducing a virtual node in the original graph structure of\nthe data, which restores the linear scaling of training and inference\ncomputational cost with respect to the number of nodes in the graph, while\nstill ensuring competitive accuracy in detecting chirality with respect to SOTA\nGNN architectures.",

Conventional outdoor monitoring\nrelies on static multimodal deep learning frameworks, which requires extensive\ndata training from scratch and fails to capture subtle health status changes.\nMultimodal large language models (MLLMs) emerge as a promising alternative,\nutilizing only small datasets to fine-tune pre-trained information-rich models\nfor enabling powerful health status monitoring. Unfortunately, MLLM-based\noutdoor health monitoring also faces significant challenges: I) sensor data\ncontains input noise stemming from sensor data acquisition and fluctuation\nnoise caused by sudden changes in physiological signals due to dynamic outdoor\nenvironments, thus degrading the training performance; ii) current transformer\nbased MLLMs struggle to achieve robust multimodal fusion, as they lack a design\nfor fusing the noisy modality; iii) modalities with varying noise levels hinder\naccurate recovery of missing data from fluctuating distributions. To combat\nthese challenges, we propose an uncertainty-aware multimodal fusion framework,\nnamed DUAL-Health, for outdoor health monitoring in dynamic and noisy\nenvironments. First, to assess the impact of noise, we accurately quantify\nmodality uncertainty caused by input and fluctuation noise with current and\ntemporal features. Second, to empower efficient muitimodal fusion with\nlow-quality modalities,we customize the fusion weight for each modality based\non quantified and calibrated uncertainty. Third, to enhance data recovery from\nfluctuating noisy modalities, we align modality distributions within a common\nsemantic space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our DUAL-Health\noutperforms state-of-the-art baselines in detection accuracy and robustness.",

To address\nthese issues, we introduce COSETTE, a contrastive tokenization method that\nintegrates collaborative information directly into the learned item\nrepresentations, jointly optimizing for both content reconstruction and\nrecommendation relevance. Additionally, we propose MARIUS, a lightweight,\naudio-inspired generative model that decouples timeline modeling from item\ndecoding.

Extensions to POD have been proposed to address this, but these\neither require large amounts of solution data, lack online adaptivity, or have\nlimited approximation accuracy. We circumvent these limitations by instead\nassigning weights to the snapshot matrix columns, and updating these whenever\nthe model is evaluated at a new point in the parameter space. We derive an a\nposteriori error bound that depends on these snapshot weights, show how these\nweights can be chosen to tighten the error bound, and present an algorithm to\ncompute the corresponding reduced basis efficiently. We show how this weighted\nPOD approach can be used to naturally generalize the calculation of reduced\nbasis derivatives to situations with multidimensional parameter spaces and\nsnapshots at multiple locations in the parameter space. Lastly, we cover how\nthese approaches can be implemented within an optimization algorithm, without\nthe need for an offline training phase. The proposed weighted POD methods with\nand without reduced basis derivatives are applied to a gradient-based shell\nthickness optimization problem with 105 design parameters and a time-dependent\npartial differential equation. The numerical solutions obtained for this\nproblem attain errors that are several orders of magnitude smaller when using\nweighted POD than those computed with regular POD and Grassmann manifold\ninterpolation, while having comparable wall times per query and requiring fewer\nhigh-dimensional model snapshots to reach an optimal solution.",

It uses a vision-language model (VLM) to process\nimages and language instructions,extracting fused vision-language embeddings.\nIn parallel, it converts depth maps into point clouds and employs a customized\npoint encoder, called Point Embedding Network, to generate 3D geometric\nembeddings independently. These produced embeddings are then concatenated and\nprocessed by our proposed spatial-aware action expert, called 3D-enhanced\nAction Expert, which combines information from different sensor modalities to\nproduce precise action sequences. Through extensive experiments in both\nsimulation and real-world environments, GeoVLA demonstrates superior\nperformance and robustness. It achieves state-of-the-art results in the LIBERO\nand ManiSkill2 simulation benchmarks and shows remarkable robustness in\nreal-world tasks requiring height adaptability, scale awareness and viewpoint\ninvariance.",

For the\ngravitationally induced parity-even 4PCF, we detect a signal with a\nsignificance of 14.7$\\sigma$ using our fiducial setup. We assess the robustness\nof this detection through a series of validation tests, including auto- and\ncross-correlation analyses, sky partitioning across multiple patch\ncombinations, and variations in radial scale cuts. Due to the low completeness\nof the sample, we find that differences in fiber assignment implementation\nschemes can significantly impact estimation of the covariance and introduce\nbiases in the data vector. After correcting for these effects, all tests yield\nconsistent results. This is one of the first measurements of the connected 4PCF\non the DESI LRG sample: the good agreement between the simulation and the data\nimplies that the amplitude of the density fluctuation inferred from the\nconnected 4PCF is consistent with the Planck $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology.

The state-of-the-art for predicting missing links in the\nhard case of a network without node attributes uses model stacking or neural\nnetwork techniques. It remains unknown which approach is best, and whether or\nhow the best choice of algorithm depends on the input network's\ncharacteristics. We answer these questions systematically using a large,\nstructurally diverse benchmark of 550 real-world networks under two standard\naccuracy measures (AUC and Top-k), comparing four stacking algorithms with 42\ntopological link predictors, two of which we introduce here, and two graph\nneural network algorithms. We show that no algorithm is best across all input\nnetworks, all algorithms perform well on most social networks, and few perform\nwell on economic and biological networks. Overall, model stacking with a random\nforest is both highly scalable and surpasses on AUC or is competitive with\ngraph neural networks on Top-k accuracy. But, algorithm performance depends\nstrongly on network characteristics like the degree distribution, triangle\ndensity, and degree assortativity. We introduce a meta-learning algorithm that\nexploits this variability to optimize link predictions for individual networks\nby selecting the best algorithm to apply, which we show outperforms all\nstate-of-the-art algorithms and scales to large networks.",

A critical\ninnovation is the incorporation of a human-in-the-loop mechanism, which enables\nthe identification of actual normal and anomalous instances from\npseudo-labeling results generated by AI. This collected data allows the\nframework to define an adaptive threshold tailored to different environments,\nensuring that the system remains effective as the definition of 'normal' shifts\nacross various settings. Implemented within a lab-based framework that\nsimulates real-world conditions, our approach allows rigorous testing and\nrefinement of VAD algorithms with a new metric.

This requires the redevelopment of the\nmodel when applying it to a new BCI paradigm, resulting in repeated costs and\neffort. Moreover, less complex deep learning models are desired for practical\nusage, as well as for deployment on portable devices. In or-der to fill the\nabove gaps, we, in this study, proposed a light-weight and unified decoding\nmodel for cross-BCI-paradigm classification. The proposed model starts with a\ntempo-spatial convolution. It is followed by a multi-scale local feature\nselec-tion module, aiming to extract local features shared across BCI paradigms\nand generate weighted features. Finally, a mul-ti-dimensional global feature\nextraction module is designed, in which multi-dimensional global features are\nextracted from the weighted features and fused with the weighted features to\nform high-level feature representations associated with BCI para-digms. The\nresults, evaluated on a mixture of three classical BCI paradigms (i.e., MI,\nSSVEP, and P300), demon-strate that the proposed model achieves 88.39%, 82.36%,\n80.01%, and 0.8092 for accuracy, macro-precision, mac-ro-recall, and\nmacro-F1-score, respectively, significantly out-performing the compared models.\nThis study pro-vides a feasible solution for cross-BCI-paradigm\nclassifica-tion.

    "abstract": "Academia is profoundly influenced by faculty hiring networks, which serve as\ncritical conduits for knowledge dissemination and the formation of\ncollaborative research initiatives. While extensive research in various\ndisciplines has revealed the institutional hierarchies inherent in these\nnetworks, their impacts within GIScience remain underexplored. To fill this\ngap, this study analyzes the placement patterns of 946 GIScience faculty\nworldwide by mapping the connections between PhD-granting institutions and\ncurrent faculty affiliations. Our dataset, which is compiled from\nvolunteer-contributed information, is the most comprehensive collection\navailable in this field. While there may be some limitations in its\nrepresentativeness, its scope and depth provide a unique and valuable\nperspective on the global placement patterns of GIScience faculty. Our analysis\nreveals several influential programs in placing GIScience faculty, with hiring\nconcentrated in the western countries. We examined the diversity index to\nassess the representation of regions and institutions within the global\nGIScience faculty network. We observe significant internal retention at both\nthe continental and country levels, and a high level of non-self-hired ratio at\nthe institutional level. Over time, research themes have also evolved, with\ngrowing research clusters emphasis on spatial data analytics, cartography and\ngeovisualization, geocomputation, and environmental sciences, etc. These\nresults illuminate the influence of hiring practices on global knowledge\ndissemination and contribute to promoting academic equity within GIScience and\nGeography.",

    "abstract": "Although large language models (LLMs) hold significant promise in\npsychotherapy, their direct application in patient-facing scenarios raises\nethical and safety concerns. Therefore, this work shifts towards developing an\nLLM as a supervisor to train real therapists. In addition to the privacy of\nclinical therapist training data, a fundamental contradiction complicates the\ntraining of therapeutic behaviors: clear feedback standards are necessary to\nensure a controlled training system, yet there is no absolute \"gold standard\"\nfor appropriate therapeutic behaviors in practice. In contrast, many common\ntherapeutic mistakes are universal and identifiable, making them effective\ntriggers for targeted feedback that can serve as clearer evidence. Motivated by\nthis, we create a novel therapist-training paradigm: (1) guidelines for\nmistaken behaviors and targeted correction strategies are first established as\nstandards; (2) a human-in-the-loop dialogue-feedback dataset is then\nconstructed, where a mistake-prone agent intentionally makes standard mistakes\nduring interviews naturally, and a supervisor agent locates and identifies\nmistakes and provides targeted feedback; (3) after fine-tuning on this dataset,\nthe final supervisor model is provided for real therapist training. The\ndetailed experimental results of automated, human and downstream assessments\ndemonstrate that models fine-tuned on our dataset MATE, can provide\nhigh-quality feedback according to the clinical guideline, showing significant\npotential for the therapist training scenario.",

This situation raises the question whether\nthe simulation results are physically meaningful. We demonstrate that, in fact,\nthe two truncation schemes correspond to two well-defined, distinct unitary\nevolutions whose generators are defined on different subsets of the\ninfinite-dimensional Fock space. This is a consequence of the fact that the\ngeneralized squeezing Hamiltonian is not self-adjoint on states with finite\nexcitations, but possesses multiple self-adjoint extensions. Furthermore, we\npresent results on the spectrum of the squeezing operators corresponding to\neven and odd truncation size that elucidate the properties of the two different\nself-adjoint extensions corresponding to the even and odd truncation scheme. To\nmake the squeezing operator applicable to a physical system, we must regularize\nit by other terms that depend on the specifics of the experimental\nimplementation. We show that the addition of a Kerr interaction term in the\nHamiltonian leads to uniquely converging simulations, with no dependence on the\nparity of the truncation size, and demonstrate that the Kerr term indeed\nrenders the Hamiltonian self-adjoint and thus physically interpretable.",

Most\nstudied in short-lived and small-bodied species, cycles frequently appear to be\ndriven by density-dependent feedbacks. However, compelling evidence of cycles\n-- often more qualitative than quantitative -- also exists in large mammals.\nAmong ungulates, both density-dependent vital rates and 'cohort effects'\n(lasting impacts of birth conditions on fecundity and survival) exist, but the\nimplications of such feedbacks for oscillatory population dynamics have not\nbeen explored. Here, we present a synthetic model of ungulate population\ndynamics, parameterized for barren-ground caribou (Rangifer tarandus\ngroenlandicus) and motivated by extensive Indigenous knowledge suggesting\ndecades-long fluctuations in abundance. Caribou herds are theorized to be\nsubject to both cohort effects and density dependence, and we linked these\nendogenous factors with environmental stochasticity to understand cycling.\nUsing wavelet analysis, we characterized periodic phenomena and performed\nsensitivity analyses to clarify the drivers and characteristics of population\ncycles. We found that cohort effects, predominantly those impacting survival,\ncan produce long-period oscillatory behavior across a wide range of\nenvironments and demographic structures.

    "abstract": "Serving disaggregated large language models has been widely adopted in\nindustrial practice for enhanced performance. However, too many tokens\ngenerated in decoding phase, i.e., occupying the resources for a long time,\nessentially hamper the cloud from achieving a higher throughput. Meanwhile, due\nto limited on-device resources, the time to first token (TTFT), i.e., the\nlatency of prefill phase, increases dramatically with the growth on prompt\nlength. In order to concur with such a bottleneck on resources, i.e., long\noccupation in cloud and limited on-device computing capacity, we propose to\nseparate large language model between cloud and devices. That is, the cloud\nhelps a portion of the content for each device, only in its prefill phase.\nSpecifically, after receiving the first token from the cloud, decoupling with\nits own prefill, the device responds to the user immediately for a lower TTFT.\nThen, the following tokens from cloud are presented via a speed controller for\nsmoothed TPOT (the time per output token), until the device catches up with the\nprogress. On-device prefill is then amortized using received tokens while the\nresource usage in cloud is controlled. Moreover, during cloud prefill, the\nprompt can be refined, using those intermediate data already generated, to\nfurther speed up on-device inference. We implement such a scheme P/D-Device,\nand confirm its superiority over other alternatives. We further propose an\nalgorithm to decide the best settings. Real-trace experiments show that TTFT\ndecreases at least 60%, maximum TPOT is about tens of milliseconds, and cloud\nthroughput increases by up to 15x.",

While most existing\nresearch focuses on post-request waiting time prediction with knowing the\nmatched driver information, pre-request waiting time prediction (i.e., before\nsubmitting a ride request and without matching a driver) is also important, as\nit enables passengers to plan their trips more effectively and enhance the\nexperience of both passengers and drivers. However, it has not been fully\nstudied by existing works. In this paper, we take the first step toward\nunderstanding the predictability and explainability of pre-request passenger\nwaiting time in ridesharing systems. Particularly, we conduct an in-depth\ndata-driven study to investigate the impact of demand&supply dynamics on\npassenger waiting time. Based on this analysis and feature engineering, we\npropose FiXGBoost, a novel feature interaction-based XGBoost model designed to\npredict waiting time without knowing the assigned driver information. We\nfurther perform an importance analysis to quantify the contribution of each\nfactor.

However, such rule-based approaches face fundamental limitations: (1)\nfixed rule sets generalize poorly to novel query patterns and struggle with\ncomplex queries; (2) a wide range of effective rewriting strategies cannot be\nfully captured by declarative rules. To overcome these issues, we propose using\nlarge language models (LLMs) to generate rewrites. LLMs can capture complex\nstrategies, such as evaluation reordering and CTE rewriting. Despite this\npotential, directly applying LLMs often results in performance regressions or\nnon-equivalent rewrites due to a lack of execution awareness and semantic\ngrounding. To address these challenges, We present E3-Rewrite, an LLM-based SQL\nrewriting framework that produces executable, equivalent, and efficient\nqueries. It integrates two core components: a context construction module and a\nreinforcement learning framework. First, the context module leverages execution\nplans and retrieved demonstrations to build bottleneck-aware prompts that guide\ninference-time rewriting. Second, we design a reward function targeting\nexecutability, equivalence, and efficiency, evaluated via syntax checks,\nequivalence verification, and cost estimation. Third, to ensure stable\nmulti-objective learning, we adopt a staged curriculum that first emphasizes\nexecutability and equivalence, then gradually incorporates efficiency. Across\nmultiple SQL benchmarks, our experiments demonstrate that E3-Rewrite can\nshorten query execution time by as much as 25.6% relative to leading baselines,\nwhile also producing up to 24.4% more rewrites that meet strict equivalence\ncriteria. These gains extend to challenging query patterns that prior\napproaches could not effectively optimize.",

    "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) become more integrated into societal systems,\nthe risk of them perpetuating and amplifying harmful biases becomes a critical\nsafety concern. Traditional methods for mitigating bias often rely on data\nfiltering or post-hoc output moderation, which treat the model as an opaque\nblack box. In this work, we introduce a complete, end-to-end system that uses\ntechniques from mechanistic interpretability to both identify and actively\nmitigate bias directly within a model's internal workings. Our method involves\ntwo primary stages. First, we train linear \"probes\" on the internal activations\nof a model to detect the latent representations of various biases (e.g.,\ngender, race, age). Our experiments on \\texttt{gpt2-large} demonstrate that\nthese probes can identify biased content with near-perfect accuracy, revealing\nthat bias representations become most salient in the model's later layers.\nSecond, we leverage these findings to compute \"steering vectors\" by contrasting\nthe model's activation patterns for biased and neutral statements. By adding\nthese vectors during inference, we can actively steer the model's generative\nprocess away from producing harmful, stereotypical, or biased content in\nreal-time. We demonstrate the efficacy of this activation steering technique,\nshowing that it successfully alters biased completions toward more neutral\nalternatives.

    "abstract": "Semi-supervised learning has gained considerable popularity in medical image\nsegmentation tasks due to its capability to reduce reliance on expert-examined\nannotations. Several mean-teacher (MT) based semi-supervised methods utilize\nconsistency regularization to effectively leverage valuable information from\nunlabeled data. However, these methods often heavily rely on the student model\nand overlook the potential impact of cognitive biases within the model.\nFurthermore, some methods employ co-training using pseudo-labels derived from\ndifferent inputs, yet generating high-confidence pseudo-labels from perturbed\ninputs during training remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we\npropose an Uncertainty-aware Cross-training framework for semi-supervised\nmedical image Segmentation (UC-Seg). Our UC-Seg framework incorporates two\ndistinct subnets to effectively explore and leverage the correlation between\nthem, thereby mitigating cognitive biases within the model. Specifically, we\npresent a Cross-subnet Consistency Preservation (CCP) strategy to enhance\nfeature representation capability and ensure feature consistency across the two\nsubnets. This strategy enables each subnet to correct its own biases and learn\nshared semantics from both labeled and unlabeled data. Additionally, we propose\nan Uncertainty-aware Pseudo-label Generation (UPG) component that leverages\nsegmentation results and corresponding uncertainty maps from both subnets to\ngenerate high-confidence pseudo-labels. We extensively evaluate the proposed\nUC-Seg on various medical image segmentation tasks involving different modality\nimages, such as MRI, CT, ultrasound, colonoscopy, and so on. The results\ndemonstrate that our method achieves superior segmentation accuracy and\ngeneralization performance compared to other state-of-the-art semi-supervised\nmethods.

We show that the\nanisotropic interband optical conductivity gives a clear signature of\nimbalanced nodes by exciting electrons at two different chemical potentials at\nnear zero frequency indicating, and the difference between these two chemical\npotentials is the direct measure of the energy imbalance. Subsequently, we also\ninvestigate the intraband DC conductivity by using the semi-classical Boltzmann\ntransport theory which reveals that contrary to the tilted Dirac materials,\ntilt can convert semi-Dirac material from semimetallic phase to metallic phase.\nFurthermore, we periodically drive the system by external time-periodic\nperturbation to open up topological gap at those nodes.

In the\ncase of fast battery charging, the associated optimal control problem becomes\ncomputationally challenging when detailed battery models are used. A recent\nheuristic optimization-free algorithm can significantly reduce the\ncomputational cost and provide an approximate solution, consistent with many\nheuristic input profiles in practice. These heuristic solutions have several\nspecial properties: They follow a bang-ride pattern that always activates a\nconstraint and applies the maximum feasible input. This work investigates when\nthe above properties arise in the optimal input, and ultimately, when the\nheuristic input profiles satisfy necessary optimality conditions. By exploiting\nPontryagin's maximum principle (PMP), we show that the optimal control is\nbang-ride under regularity conditions on constraint switching and local\ncontrollability of the system. Moreover, the special type of bang-ride\nbehavior, i.e., applying the maximum feasible input, arises under the\nmonotonicity of the system, objective function, and restricted sensitivity of\nthe constraints.

These\nmethods decompose images into mutually independent illumination and reflectance\ncomponents, allows each component to be enhanced separately. In fact, achieving\nperfect decomposition of illumination and reflectance components proves to be\nquite challenging, with some residuals still existing after decomposition. In\nthis paper, we formally name these residuals as inter-component residuals\n(ICR), which has been largely underestimated by previous methods. In our\ninvestigation, ICR not only affects the accuracy of the decomposition but also\ncauses enhanced components to deviate from the ideal outcome, ultimately\nreducing the final synthesized image quality. To address this issue, we propose\na novel Inter-correction Retinex model (IRetinex) to alleviate ICR during the\ndecomposition and enhancement stage. In the decomposition stage, we leverage\ninter-component residual reduction module to reduce the feature similarity\nbetween illumination and reflectance components. In the enhancement stage, we\nutilize the feature similarity between the two components to detect and\nmitigate the impact of ICR within each enhancement unit.

    "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) with large effective receptive field\n(ERF), still in their early stages, have demonstrated promising effectiveness\nwhile constrained by high parameters and FLOPs costs and disrupted\nasymptotically Gaussian distribution (AGD) of ERF. This paper proposes an\nalternative paradigm: rather than merely employing extremely large ERF, it is\nmore effective and efficient to expand the ERF while maintaining AGD of ERF by\nproper combination of smaller kernels, such as $7\\times{7}$, $9\\times{9}$,\n$11\\times{11}$. This paper introduces a Three-layer Receptive Field Aggregator\nand designs a Layer Operator as the fundamental operator from the perspective\nof receptive field. The ERF can be expanded to the level of existing\nlarge-kernel ConvNets through the stack of proposed modules while maintaining\nAGD of ERF. Using these designs, we propose a universal model for ConvNet of\nany scale, termed UniConvNet. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K, COCO2017,\nand ADE20K demonstrate that UniConvNet outperforms state-of-the-art CNNs and\nViTs across various vision recognition tasks for both lightweight and\nlarge-scale models with comparable throughput. Surprisingly, UniConvNet-T\nachieves $84.2\\%$ ImageNet top-1 accuracy with $30M$ parameters and $5.1G$\nFLOPs. UniConvNet-XL also shows competitive scalability to big data and large\nmodels, acquiring $88.4\\%$ top-1 accuracy on ImageNet.

    "abstract": "Context. Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have traditionally been classified by\nduration into long (LGRBs) and short (SGRBs), with the former believed to\noriginate from massive star collapses and the latter from compact binary\nmergers. However, events such as the SGRB 200826A (coming from a collapsar) and\nthe LGRBs 211211A and 230307A (associated with a merger) suggest that\nduration-based classification could be sometimes misleading. Recently, the\nminimum variability timescale (MVT) has emerged as a key metric for classifying\nGRBs.\n  Aims. We calculate the MVT, defined as the full width at half maximum (FWHM)\nof the narrowest pulse in the light curve, using an independent dataset from\nFermi/GBM and we compare our results with other MVT definitions. We update the\nMVT-T90 plane and analyse peculiar events like long-duration merger candidates\n211211A, 230307A, and other short GRBs with extended emission (SEE-GRBs). We\nalso examine extragalactic magnetar giant flares (MGFs) and explore possible\nnew correlations with peak energy.\n  Methods. We used the MEPSA algorithm to identify the shortest pulse in each\nGRB light curve and measure its FWHM. We calculated the MVT for around 3700\nGRBs, 177 of which with spectroscopically known redshift.\n  Results. SEE-GRBs and SGRBs share similar MVTs (from few tens to a few\nhundreds of ms), indicating a common progenitor, while extragalactic MGFs\nexhibit even shorter values (from few ms to few tens of ms). Our MVT estimation\nmethod consistently yields higher values than another existing technique, the\nlatter aligning with the pulse rise time. For LGRBs, we confirmed the\ncorrelations of MVT with peak luminosity and Lorentz factor.\n  Conclusions. We confirmed that, although MVT alone cannot determine the GRB\nprogenitor, it is a valuable tool when combined with other indicators, helping\nto flag long-duration mergers and distinguish MGFs from typical SGRBs.",

Despite\nadvancements in video comprehension, the substantial computational demands of\nlong video sequences lead current video LLMs (Vid-LLMs) to employ compression\nstrategies at both the inter-frame level (e.g., uniform sampling of video\nframes) and intra-frame level (e.g., condensing all visual tokens of each frame\ninto a limited number). However, this approach often neglects the uneven\ntemporal distribution of critical information across frames, risking the\nomission of keyframes that contain essential temporal and semantic details. To\ntackle these challenges, we propose KFFocus, a method designed to efficiently\ncompress video tokens and emphasize the informative context present within\nvideo frames. We substitute uniform sampling with a refined approach inspired\nby classic video compression principles to identify and capture keyframes based\non their temporal redundancy. By assigning varying condensation ratios to\nframes based on their contextual relevance, KFFocus efficiently reduces token\nredundancy while preserving informative content details. Additionally, we\nintroduce a spatiotemporal modeling module that encodes both the temporal\nrelationships between video frames and the spatial structure within each frame,\nthus providing Vid-LLMs with a nuanced understanding of spatial-temporal\ndynamics.

For $p$-type doping,\nthe calculated electrical conductivities ($\\sigma$), hole mobilities ($\\mu$),\nSeebeck coefficients ($S$), and power factors (PFs) of CuGaTe$_2$ and\nCuInTe$_2$ show excellent agreement with experimental data. At fixed\ntemperature and hole concentration, as $X$ varies from S to Te, the hole\nmobility increases markedly due to progressively weaker polar--optical--phonon\nscattering, reflecting the reduced ionic contribution to the dielectric\nresponse in compounds with heavier chalcogens. Combined with smaller transport\neffective masses, Cu$M$Te$_2$ compounds therefore exhibit high $\\sigma$ and\nlarge PFs.

In this context, color recommendation involves\nsuggesting appropriate colors to complete or refine a design when one or more\ncolors are missing or require alteration. Traditional methods often struggled\nwith these challenges due to the complex nature of color design and the limited\ndata availability. In this study, we explored the use of pretrained Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) and their commonsense reasoning capabilities for color\nrecommendation, raising the question: Can pretrained LLMs serve as superior\ndesigners for color recommendation tasks? To investigate this, we developed a\nrobust, rigorously validated pipeline, ColorGPT, that was built by\nsystematically testing multiple color representations and applying effective\nprompt engineering techniques. Our approach primarily targeted color palette\ncompletion by recommending colors based on a set of given colors and\naccompanying context. Moreover, our method can be extended to full palette\ngeneration, producing an entire color palette corresponding to a provided\ntextual description. Experimental results demonstrated that our LLM-based\npipeline outperformed existing methods in terms of color suggestion accuracy\nand the distribution of colors in the color palette completion task. For the\nfull palette generation task, our approach also yielded improvements in color\ndiversity and similarity compared to current techniques.",

    "abstract": "Gaia has recently revealed a population of over 20 compact objects in wide\nastrometric binaries, while LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) have observed around 100\ncompact object binaries as gravitational-wave (GW) mergers. Despite belonging\nto different systems, the compact objects discovered by both Gaia and the LVK\nfollow a multimodal mass distribution, with a global maximum at neutron star\n(NS) masses ($\\sim 1$-$2\\,M_\\odot$) and a secondary local maximum at black hole\n(BH) masses $\\sim10\\,M_\\odot$. However, the relative dearth of objects, or\n``mass gap,\" between these modes is more pronounced among the wide binaries\nobserved by Gaia compared to the GW population, with $9^{+10}_{-6}\\%$ of GW\ncomponent masses falling between $2.5$--$5\\,M_\\odot$ compared to $\\lesssim5\\%$\nof Gaia compact objects. We explore whether this discrepancy can be explained\nby the natal kicks received by low-mass BHs. GW progenitor binaries may be more\nlikely to survive natal kicks, because the newborn BH has a more massive\ncompanion and/or is in a tighter binary than Gaia progenitor binaries. We\ncompare the survival probabilities of Gaia and GW progenitor binaries as a\nfunction of natal kick strength and pre-supernova binary parameters, and map\nout the parameter space and kick strength required to disrupt the progenitor\nbinaries leading to low-mass BHs in Gaia systems more frequently than those in\nGW systems.",

HI aims to reduce\nlatency, improve accuracy, and lower bandwidth usage by first using the\nLocal-ML model for inference and offloading to the Remote-ML only when the\nlocal inference is likely incorrect. A critical challenge in HI is estimating\nthe likelihood of the local inference being incorrect, especially when data\ndistributions and offloading costs change over time -- a problem we term\nHierarchical Inference Learning (HIL). We introduce a novel approach to HIL by\nmodeling the probability of correct inference by the Local-ML as an increasing\nfunction of the model's confidence measure, a structure motivated by empirical\nobservations but previously unexploited. We propose two policies, HI-LCB and\nHI-LCB-lite, based on the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) framework. We\ndemonstrate that both policies achieve order-optimal regret of $O(\\log T)$, a\nsignificant improvement over existing HIL policies with $O(T^{2/3})$ regret\nguarantees. Notably, HI-LCB-lite has an $O(1)$ per-sample computational\ncomplexity, making it well-suited for deployment on devices with severe\nresource limitations.

In this\nwork, we introduce Rational Inverse Reasoning (RIR), a framework for inferring\nthese latent programs through a hierarchical generative model of behavior.

This loop yields a posterior over\nconcise, executable programs. We evaluate RIR on a suite of continuous\nmanipulation tasks designed to test one-shot and few-shot generalization across\nvariations in object pose, count, geometry, and layout.

Indeed, we argue that\nferroelectric devices, particularly HfO2-based, are an elegant solution to\nrealize possibly arbitrary time constants in a single scaled memory device,\nwhich paves the way for temporal and brain-inspired computing in hardware. Here\nwe present a ferroelectric capacitor stack realizing volatile memory due to its\nunique interface configuration. We provide electrical characterization of the\ndevice to motivate its use for realizing time constants in hardware, followed\nby an investigation of the electronic mechanisms and their possible relation to\nthe observed retention times to facilitate further modeling of the retention\nprocess in HfO2-based ferroelectric capacitors. In the presented device,\ninternal electric fields stabilize one polarization of the ferroelectric film,\nopening the possibility for unipolar operation with millisecond retention for\nthe unstable polarization state. We show a dependence of the retention on both\nthe polarization as well as the electrical stimuli, allowing us to exploit a\nrange of time scales in a single device. Further, the intentionally defective\ninterface in the presented material stack allows an insight into the interplay\nbetween retention loss in HfO2-based ferroelectric devices and the internal\nbias field, which we relate to the interface composition and the role of oxygen\nvacancies as a possible source of the internal bias fields.",

    "abstract": "A major challenge in understanding the initiation and evolution of coronal\nmass ejections (CMEs) is measuring the magnetic field of the magnetic flux\nropes (MFRs) that drive CMEs. Recent developments in radio imaging spectroscopy\nhave paved the way for diagnosing the CMEs' magnetic field using\ngyrosynchrotron radiation. We present magnetic field measurements of a CME\nassociated with an X5-class flare by combining radio imaging spectroscopy data\nin microwaves (1--18 GHz) and meter-wave (20--88 MHz), obtained by the Owens\nValley Radio Observatory's Expanded Owens Valley Solar Array (EOVSA) and Long\nWavelength Array (OVRO-LWA), respectively. EOVSA observations reveal that the\nmicrowave source, observed in the low corona during the initiation phase of the\neruption, outlines the bottom of the rising MFR-hosting CME bubble seen in\nextreme ultraviolet and expands as the bubble evolves. As the MFR erupts into\nthe middle corona and appears as a white light CME, its meter-wave counterpart,\nobserved by OVRO-LWA, displays a similar morphology. For the first time, using\ngyrosynchrotron spectral diagnostics, we obtain magnetic field measurements of\nthe erupting MFR in both the low and middle corona, corresponding to coronal\nheights of 0.02 and 1.83 $R_{\\odot}$. The magnetic field strength is found to\nbe around 300 G at 0.02 $R_{\\odot}$ during the CME initiation, and about 0.6 G\nnear the leading edge of the CME when it propagates to 1.83 $R_{\\odot}$. These\nresults provide critical new insights into the magnetic structure of the CME\nand its evolution during the early stages of its eruption.",

    "abstract": "In the framework of mutually unbiased bases (MUBs), a measurement in one\nbasis gives \\emph{no information} about the outcomes of measurements in another\nbasis. Here, we relax the no-information condition by allowing the $d$ outcomes\nto be predicted according to a predefined probability distribution\n$q=(q_0,\\cdots,q_{d-1})$. The notion of mutual unbiasedness, however, is\npreserved by requiring that the extracted information is the same for any\npreparation and any measurement; regardless of which state from which basis is\nchosen to prepare the system, the outcomes of measuring the system with respect\nto the other basis generate the same probability distribution. In the light of\nthis, we define the notion of \\emph{mutually equi-biased bases} (MEBs) such\nthat within each basis the states are equi-biased with respect to the states of\nthe other basis and that the bases are mutually equi-biased with respect to\neach other. For $d=2,3$, we derive a complete set of $d+1$ MEBs. The mutual\nequi-biasedness imposes nontrivial constraints on the distribution $q$, leading\nfor $d=3$ to the restriction $1/3\\le\\mu \\le 1/2$ where\n$\\mu=\\sum_{k=0}^{2}q_k^2$. To capture the incompatibility of the measurements\nin MEBs, we derive an inequality for the probabilities of projective\nmeasurements in a qudit system, which yields an associated entropic uncertainty\ninequality. Finally, we construct a class of positive maps and their associated\nentanglement witnesses based on MEBs. While an entanglement witness constructed\nfrom MUBs is generally finer than one based on MEBs when both use the same\nnumber of bases, for certain values of the index $\\mu$, employing a larger set\nof MEBs can yield a finer witness. We illustrate this behavior using isotropic\nstates of a $3\\times 3$ system.",

Specifically, we first propose an\nUnderstanding-driven Speech Tokenizer (USTokenizer), which extracts high-level\nsemantic information essential for accomplishing understanding tasks using text\nLLMs. In this way, USToken enjoys better modality commonality with text, which\nreduces the difficulty of modality alignment in adapting text LLMs to speech\nLLMs. Secondly, we present DualSpeechLM, a dual-token modeling framework that\nconcurrently models USToken as input and acoustic token as output within a\nunified, end-to-end framework, seamlessly integrating speech understanding and\ngeneration capabilities. Furthermore, we propose a novel semantic supervision\nloss and a Chain-of-Condition (CoC) strategy to stabilize model training and\nenhance speech generation performance. Experimental results demonstrate that\nour proposed approach effectively fosters a complementary relationship between\nunderstanding and generation tasks, highlighting the promising strategy of\nmutually enhancing both tasks in one unified model.",

The framework models data and knowledge as modular,\nlogic-aware semantic units: single propositions (statement units) or coherent\ngroups of propositions (compound units). Statement units can model\nmeasurements, observations, or universal relationships, including causal ones,\nand link to methods and evidence. Compound units group related statement units\ninto reusable, semantically coherent knowledge objects. Implemented using RDF,\nOWL, and knowledge graphs, semantic units can be serialized as FAIR Digital\nObjects with persistent identifiers, provenance, and semantic interoperability.\nWe show how universal statement units build ecological causal networks, which\ncan be composed into causal maps and perspective-specific subnetworks. These\nsupport causal reasoning, confounder detection (back-door), effect\nidentification with unobserved confounders (front-door), application of\ndo-calculus, and alignment with Bayesian networks, structural equation models,\nand structural causal models. By linking fine-grained empirical data to\nhigh-level causal reasoning, the Semantic Units Framework provides a foundation\nfor ecological knowledge synthesis, evidence annotation, cross-domain\nintegration, reproducible workflows, and AI-ready ecological research.",

    "abstract": "Recently, we can observe a significant increase of the phishing attacks in\nthe Internet. In a typical phishing attack, the attacker sets up a malicious\nwebsite that looks similar to the legitimate website in order to obtain the\nend-users' information. This may cause the leakage of the sensitive information\nand the financial loss for the end-users. To avoid such attacks, the early\ndetection of these websites' URLs is vital and necessary. Previous researchers\nhave proposed many machine learning algorithms to distinguish the phishing URLs\nfrom the legitimate ones. In this paper, we would like to enhance these machine\nlearning algorithms from the perspective of feature selection. We propose a\nnovel method to incorporate the keyword features with the traditional features.\nThis method is applied on multiple traditional machine learning algorithms and\nthe experimental results have shown this method is useful and effective. On\naverage, this method can reduce the classification error by 30% for the large\ndataset. Moreover, its enhancement is more significant for the small dataset.\nIn addition, this method extracts the information from the URL and does not\nrely on the additional information provided by the third-part service.

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of estimating the finite population mean $\\bar{Y}$ of\nan outcome variable $Y$ using data from a nonprobability sample and auxiliary\ninformation from a probability sample. Existing double robust (DR) estimators\nof this mean $\\bar{Y}$ require the estimation of two nuisance functions: the\nconditional probability of selection into the nonprobability sample given\ncovariates $X$ that are observed in both samples, and the conditional\nexpectation of $Y$ given $X$. These nuisance functions can be estimated using\nparametric models, but the resulting estimator of $\\bar{Y}$ will typically be\nbiased if both parametric models are misspecified. It would therefore be\nadvantageous to be able to use more flexible data-adaptive / machine-learning\nestimators of the nuisance functions. Here, we develop a general framework for\nthe valid use of DR estimators of $\\bar{Y}$ when the design of the probability\nsample uses sampling without replacement at the first stage and data-adaptive /\nmachine-learning estimators are used for the nuisance functions. We prove that\nseveral DR estimators of $\\bar{Y}$, including targeted maximum likelihood\nestimators, are asymptotically normally distributed when the estimators of the\nnuisance functions converge faster than the $n^{1/4}$ rate and cross-fitting is\nused. We present a simulation study that demonstrates good performance of these\nDR estimators compared to the corresponding DR estimators that rely on at least\none correctly specified parametric model.",

In this case,\nconventional initiation approaches relying solely on a fixed-angle wedge may\nengender risks of initiation failure, which necessitates extra initiation\nassistance measures. In this study, ODW initiation over a finite wedge with\nlocal energy deposition is numerically investigated to assess the thermal\neffects of plasma-based initiation assistance techniques. Particular emphasis\nis put on the effects of forms and magnitudes of energy deposition on\ninitiation modes and flow field structures of ODWs. The results demonstrate\nthat on-wedge initiation of ODWs fails at a low Mach number without any energy\ndepositions. In contrast, both continuous and pulsatile local energy\ndepositions can effectively initiate ODWs, leading to sustainable detonation on\nthe finite wedge. As continuous energy deposition power or pulsatile single\npulse energy increases, several key detonation initiation modes emerge\nsequentially. Analysis of the spatiotemporal evolution of the primary wave\nstructures under single-pulse energy deposition reveals the minimum pulse\nrepetition frequency required for sustainable on-wedge detonation, which is\nsubsequently verified through multi-pulse energy deposition simulations.\nNevertheless, it is found that sustainable on-wedge detonation can be achieved\nby pulsatile energy deposition with an average power consumption of less than\n10% of that required for continuous energy deposition while maintaining a same\ninitiation length, suggesting that the pulsatile one is an efficient way of\nenergy deposition for initiation assistance of ODWs on finite wedges under\nextreme flight conditions.",

The model is\nbased on a hidden sector scalar potential motivated by broken scale invariance,\nfor which analytic Q-ball solutions and numerical simulations of condensate\nfragmentation exist. We show that this potential can produce superheavy Q-balls\nduring the radiation-dominated era. As an example, we show that it is possible\nto produce Q-balls of mass $ \\sim \\,10^{6} \\, M_{\\odot}$ and diameter $\\sim$\n100 light years, with a number density $\\sim 1$ per galaxy. Such early-forming\nsuperheavy Q-balls could play a role in galaxy and supermassive black hole\n(SMBH) formation. We also show that it is possible to form smaller mass Q-balls\nwith large numbers per galaxy volume, that could form SMBH by merging.

While head-rotation\nprediction algorithms could, in principle, reproduce this behavior, they\ntypically focus on visually salient stimuli and overlook the cognitive motives\nthat guide head rotation. This yields agents that look at conspicuous objects\nwhile overlooking obstacles or task-relevant cues, diminishing realism in a\nvirtual environment. We introduce SCORE, a Symbolic Cognitive Reasoning\nframework for Embodied Head Rotation, a data-agnostic framework that produces\ncontext-aware head movements without task-specific training or hand-tuned\nheuristics. A controlled VR study (N=20) identifies five motivational drivers\nof human head movements: Interest, Information Seeking, Safety, Social Schema,\nand Habit. SCORE encodes these drivers as symbolic predicates, perceives the\nscene with a Vision-Language Model (VLM), and plans head poses with a Large\nLanguage Model (LLM). The framework employs a hybrid workflow: the VLM-LLM\nreasoning is executed offline, after which a lightweight FastVLM performs\nonline validation to suppress hallucinations while maintaining responsiveness\nto scene dynamics. The result is an agent that predicts not only where to look\nbut also why, generalizing to unseen scenes and multi-agent crowds while\nretaining behavioral plausibility.",

    "abstract": "Light field display is one of the technologies providing 3D immersive\nvisualization. However, a light field display generates only a limited number\nof light rays which results in finite angular and spatial resolutions.\nTherefore, 3D content can be shown with high quality only within a narrow depth\nrange notated as Depth of Field (DoF) around the display screen. Outside this\nrange, due to the appearance of aliasing artifacts, the quality degrades\nproportionally to the distance from the screen. One solution to mitigate the\nartifacts is depth of field rendering which blurs the content in the distorted\nregions, but can result in the removal of scene details. This research focuses\non proposing a DoF Aware Scene Complexity (DASC) metric that characterizes 3D\ncontent based on geometrical and positional factors considering the light field\ndisplay's DoF. In this research, we also evaluate the observers' preference\nacross different level of blurriness caused by DoF rendering ranging from\nsharp, aliased scenes to overly smoothed alias-free scenes.

These problems reduce their ability to generalize in\nreal-world conversations. To solve these challenges, we propose LPGNet, a\nLightweight network with Parallel attention and Gated fusion for multimodal\nERC. The main part of LPGNet is the Lightweight Parallel Interaction Attention\n(LPIA) module. This module replaces traditional stacked Transformer layers with\nparallel dot-product attention, which can model both within-modality and\nbetween-modality relationships more efficiently. To improve emotional feature\nlearning, LPGNet also uses a dual-gated fusion method. This method filters and\ncombines features from different input types in a flexible and dynamic way. In\naddition, LPGNet removes speaker embeddings completely, which allows the model\nto work independently of speaker identity. Experiments on the IEMOCAP dataset\nshow that LPGNet reaches over 87% accuracy and F1-score in 4-class emotion\nclassification.

This effect becomes significant only when\nNP-hydrogel interactions are sufficiently strong and US pulses are long enough\nto disrupt these interactions, following a \"stick-and-release\" mechanism.\n  These findings reconcile previously conflicting experimental observations and\nexplain why acoustic enhancement is observed in some studies but not others.\nOverall, our study provides a molecular-level explanation for US-enhanced NP\ndiffusion in hydrogels and establishes design principles for optimizing\ntherapeutic US protocols in drug delivery applications.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has significantly advanced\nnovel view synthesis through explicit scene representation, enabling real-time\nphotorealistic rendering. However, existing approaches manifest two critical\nlimitations in complex scenarios: (1) Over-reconstruction occurs when\npersistent large Gaussians cannot meet adaptive splitting thresholds during\ndensity control. This is exacerbated by conflicting gradient directions that\nprevent effective splitting of these Gaussians; (2) Over-densification of\nGaussians occurs in regions with aligned gradient aggregation, leading to\nredundant component proliferation. This redundancy significantly increases\nmemory overhead due to unnecessary data retention. We present\nGradient-Direction-Aware Gaussian Splatting (GDAGS), a gradient-direction-aware\nadaptive density control framework to address these challenges. Our key\ninnovations: the gradient coherence ratio (GCR), computed through normalized\ngradient vector norms, which explicitly discriminates Gaussians with concordant\nversus conflicting gradient directions; and a nonlinear dynamic weighting\nmechanism leverages the GCR to enable gradient-direction-aware density control.\nSpecifically, GDAGS prioritizes conflicting-gradient Gaussians during splitting\noperations to enhance geometric details while suppressing redundant\nconcordant-direction Gaussians. Conversely, in cloning processes, GDAGS\npromotes concordant-direction Gaussian densification for structural completion\nwhile preventing conflicting-direction Gaussian overpopulation. Comprehensive\nevaluations across diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate that GDAGS\nachieves superior rendering quality while effectively mitigating\nover-reconstruction, suppressing over-densification, and constructing compact\nscene representations with 50\\% reduced memory consumption through optimized\nGaussians utilization.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the barren plateau (BP) phenomenon in variational quantum\nalgorithms using a statistical approach. Using Gaussian function models, we\nidentify three distinct types of BPs. The first type, which we called\nlocalized-dip BPs, occurs in landscapes that are mostly flat but contain a dip\npoint where the gradient is large in a small region around the minimum. The\nsecond type, called localized-gorge BPs, which are somewhat similar to the\nlocalized-dip BPs but contain a gorge line. The third type, called\neverywhere-flat BPs, appears when the entire landscape is uniformly flat with\nalmost vanishing gradients, making optimization significantly more difficult.\nAfter illustrating these behaviors in the Gaussian function models, we extend\nthe analysis to the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). We consider two\ntypes of ans\\\"atze: the hardware-efficient ansatz and the random Pauli ansatz.\nFor both ans\\\"atze, we only observe the everywhere-flat BPs. Using our\nstatistical approach, we searched for localized-dip and localized-gorge BPs but\nfound no evidence of such features in the examples studied, suggesting that\neverywhere-flat BPs dominate in these ans\\\"atze. Our method effectively probes\nlandscape features by capturing the gradient scaling across parameter space,\nmaking it a useful tool for diagnosing BPs in variational algorithms. To\nmitigate BPs in the VQE, we employ a genetic algorithm (GA) to optimize the\nrandom gates generated in the ans\\\"atze, thereby reshaping the cost function\nlandscape to enhance the optimization efficiency. A comparison with an\nunoptimized ansatz shows how the ansatz design can improve the scalability and\nreliability of variational quantum algorithms.",

It resolves the fundamental\nstructural incompatibility between standard positivity-preserving limiters and\nglobal DF enforcement in the central discontinuous Galerkin (CDG) framework.\nThe method integrates a novel positivity-limiting strategy, a modified\ndissipation mechanism guided by convex decomposition, and an auxiliary\nevolution equation for the magnetic field, which are designed based on rigorous\ntheoretical analysis. Notably, we provide a rigorous proof of positivity\npreservation for the updated cell averages under an explicit CFL-type\ncondition. The proof leverages the geometric quasi-linearization (GQL)\ntechnique, which reformulates the nonlinear positivity constraint into an\nequivalent linear form. This enables the derivation of flux-based inequalities\nand technical estimates under the global DF constraint. To suppress nonphysical\noscillations near shocks, we develop a compact, non-intrusive\nconvex-oscillation-suppressing (COS) procedure based on the entropy function.\nThe COS process acts only on non-magnetic variables, avoids costly\ncharacteristic decomposition, and maintains both the globally DF property and\nhigh-order accuracy. Several challenging experiments -- including low\nplasma-beta MHD jets with Mach numbers up to 1,000,000 -- demonstrate the\nproposed method robustness, high-order accuracy, non-oscillatory behavior, and\nits ability to preserve both positivity and globally DF structures under\nextreme conditions.",

    "abstract": "Complex networks are commonly used to explore human behavior. However,\nprevious studies largely overlooked the geographical and economic factors\nembedded in collective attention. To address this, we construct attention\nnetworks from time-series data for the United States and China, each a key\neconomic power in the West and the East, respectively. We reveal a strong\nmacroscale correlation between urban attention and Gross Domestic Product\n(GDP). At the mesoscale, community detection of attention networks shows that\nhigh-GDP cities consistently act as core nodes within their communities and\noccupy strategic geographic positions. At the microscale, structural hole\ntheory identifies these cities as key connectors between communities, with\ninfluence proportional to economic output. Overlapping community detection\nfurther reveals tightly connected urban clusters, prompting us to introduce\ngeographic and topic-based metrics, which show that closely linked cities are\nspatially proximate and topically coherent. Of course, not all patterns were\nconsistent across regions. A notable distinction emerged in the relationship\nbetween population size and urban attention, which was evident in the United\nStates but absent in China. Building on these insights, we integrate key\nvariables reflecting GDP, geography, and scenic resources into regression model\nto cross-verify the influence of economic and geographic factors on collective\nuser attention, and unexpectedly discover that a composite index of population,\naccess, and scenery fails to account for cross-city variations in attention.\nOur study bridges the gap between economic prosperity and geographic centrality\nin shaping urban attention landscapes.",

Using a twisted gold nanorod dimer and tightly focused\ncircularly polarized optical vortex beams carrying spin and orbital angular\nmomenta of the same sign, we measure spectrally and spatially resolved chiral\ndichroism signals that persist even where spin optical chirality vanishes,\nrevealing a quadrupole-mediated chiral interaction driven by OAM.

    "abstract": "The increasing scale and complexity of large language models (LLMs) pose\nsignificant inference latency challenges, primarily due to their autoregressive\ndecoding paradigm characterized by the sequential nature of next-token\nprediction. By re-examining the outputs of autoregressive models, we observed\nthat some segments exhibit parallelizable structures, which we term intrinsic\nparallelism. Decoding each parallelizable branch simultaneously (i.e. parallel\ndecoding) can significantly improve the overall inference speed of LLMs. In\nthis paper, we propose an Adaptive Serial-Parallel Decoding (ASPD), which\naddresses two core challenges: automated construction of parallelizable data\nand efficient parallel decoding mechanism. More specifically, we introduce a\nnon-invasive pipeline that automatically extracts and validates parallelizable\nstructures from the responses of autoregressive models. To empower efficient\nadaptive serial-parallel decoding, we implement a Hybrid Decoding Engine which\nenables seamless transitions between serial and parallel decoding modes while\nmaintaining a reusable KV cache, maximizing computational efficiency. Extensive\nevaluations across General Tasks, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Mathematical\nReasoning, demonstrate that ASPD achieves unprecedented performance in both\neffectiveness and efficiency.

    "abstract": "The quest for higher wireless carrier frequencies spanning the\nmillimeter-wave (mmWave) and Terahertz (THz) bands heralds substantial\nenhancements in data throughput and spectral efficiency for next-generation\nwireless networks. However, these gains come at the cost of severe path loss\nand a heightened risk of beam misalignment due to user mobility, especially\npronounced in near-field communication. Traditional solutions rely on extremely\ndirectional beamforming and frequent beam updates via beam management, but such\ntechniques impose formidable computational and signaling overhead. In response,\nwe propose a novel approach termed trajectory-adaptive beam shaping (TABS) that\neliminates the need for real-time beam management by shaping the\nelectromagnetic wavefront to follow the user's predefined trajectory. Drawing\ninspiration from self-accelerating beams in optics, TABS concentrates energy\nalong pre-defined curved paths corresponding to the user's motion without\nrequiring real-time beam reconfiguration. We further introduce a dedicated\nquantitative metric to characterize performance under the TABS framework.\nComprehensive simulations substantiate the superiority of TABS in terms of link\nperformance, overhead reduction, and implementation complexity.",

PGDI operates\nin a speaker-independent manner and maintains robustness even when long\nsegments are completely masked by strong transient noise, making it well-suited\nfor real-world applications, such as fireworks, door slams, hammer strikes, and\nconstruction noise. Through extensive experiments across diverse speakers and\ngap lengths, we demonstrate PGDI's superior inpainting performance and its\nability to handle challenging acoustic conditions.

    "abstract": "Functions of bound Kerr geodesic motion play a central role in many\ncalculations in relativistic astrophysics, ranging from gravitational-wave\ngeneration to self-force and radiation-reaction modeling. Although these\nfunctions can be expressed as a Fourier series using the geodesic fundamental\nfrequencies, reconstructing them in coordinate time is challenging due to the\ncoupling of the radial and polar motions. In this paper, we compare two\nstrategies for performing such reconstructions and their ability to estimate\nhigh-order coordinate-time derivatives of the orbital functional. The first\nmethod maps Fourier coefficients from Mino to coordinate time; the second\nmethod fits a sampled time series of the function to a truncated\ncoordinate-time Fourier series. While the latter method is prone to\noverfitting, it yields more accurate reconstructions and derivatives than the\nmapping, but completely misrepresents the harmonic content of the orbital\nfunctional. For the purpose of accurate coordinate-time derivative estimation,\nwe propose a hybrid method: fit for the Mino-time coefficients, differentiate\nwith respect to Mino time, then convert to coordinate time. Applied to the mass\nquadrupole of a generic Kerr geodesic, this hybrid method recovers the sixth\nderivative with a fractional residual $\\sim10^{-6}$ using only two harmonics.\nFor orbital functionals that depend explicitly on the geodesic orbit expressed\nin Boyer--Lindquist coordinates, we also provide a recursive procedure for\ncomputing coordinate-time derivatives using exact analytic expressions. These\nresults offer a general framework for accurately evaluating high-order time\nderivatives along Kerr geodesic worldlines, with direct relevance to\napplications such as extreme-mass-ratio inspiral kludge waveform modeling,\nwhere such derivatives are key ingredients for precise gravitational-wave\npredictions.",

Empirical research on quality defects in natural language\nrequirements relies heavily on datasets, ideally as realistic and\nrepresentative as possible. However, such datasets are often inaccessible,\nsmall, or lack sufficient detail. This paper introduces QuRE (Quality in\nRequirements), a new dataset comprising 2,111 industrial requirements that have\nbeen annotated through a real-world review process. Previously used for over\nfive years as part of an industrial contract, this dataset is now being\nreleased to the research community. In this work, we furthermore provide\ndescriptive statistics on the dataset, including measures such as lexical\ndiversity and readability, and compare it to existing requirements datasets and\nsynthetically generated requirements. In contrast to synthetic datasets, QuRE\nis linguistically similar to existing ones. However, this dataset comes with a\ndetailed context description, and its labels have been created and used\nsystematically and extensively in an industrial context over a period of close\nto a decade. Our goal is to foster transparency, comparability, and empirical\nrigor by supporting the development of a common gold standard for requirements\nquality datasets. This, in turn, will enable more sound and collaborative\nresearch efforts in the field.",

Neutron stars, with their extreme densities and strong\ngravitational fields, provide an ideal laboratory for testing General\nRelativity (GR) in the high-curvature regime and for exploring possible\ndeviations via modified gravity. EMSG extends GR by including nonlinear terms\ninvolving the energy-momentum tensor, characterized by a coupling parameter\n$\\alpha$. We focus on the Kretschmann, Ricci, and Weyl curvature scalars,\nanalyzing their dependence on baryon density and radial coordinate for varying\nvalues of $\\alpha$. Our results indicate that EMSG can significantly alter the\ncurvature profiles of neutron stars. In particular, the magnitude of both Weyl\nand Kretschmann scalars increases (decreases) for a positive (negative) EMSG\nparameter, with the former exhibiting a larger dependence. Similarly, the\nsurface curvature (SC) is notably affected by $\\alpha$. Interestingly, we\nfurther observe distinct discontinuities in the curvature profiles at\nhadron-quark phase transitions, especially in the soft and intermediate HQPT\nmodels. These signatures may provide observable imprints of exotic core phases\nin neutron stars.",

Under\nthermal equilibrium conditions, analyses of the negativity, zero-time-delay\ntwo-photon correlation function, and atom-spin squeezing parameters in the\nfinite-size Dicke-Stark model reveal that as the coupling strength increases,\nthe light field undergoes a transition from photon bunching to anti-bunching\nand then back to bunching. The Stark field can modulate both the maximum and\nminimum values of the two-photon correlation function and their corresponding\ncoupling strengths. At low temperatures, the system exhibits entanglement and\nspin squeezing. As temperature rises, entanglement gradually diminishes, while\nstrong coupling facilitates the preservation of entanglement in the system\nstate. Atom-spin squeezing spin squeezing is highly sensitive to temperature\nand vanishes rapidly with increasing temperature.

We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of BiasGym in reducing real-world stereotypes (e.g., people from\nItaly being `reckless drivers') and in probing fictional associations (e.g.,\npeople from a fictional country having `blue skin'), showing its utility for\nboth safety interventions and interpretability research.",

    "abstract": "Sharpening is a widely adopted technique to improve video quality, which can\neffectively emphasize textures and alleviate blurring. However, increasing the\nsharpening level comes with a higher video bitrate, resulting in degraded\nQuality of Service (QoS). Furthermore, the video quality does not necessarily\nimprove with increasing sharpening levels, leading to issues such as\nover-sharpening. Clearly, it is essential to figure out how to boost video\nquality with a proper sharpening level while also controlling bandwidth costs\neffectively. This paper thus proposes a novel Frequency-assisted Sharpening\nlevel Prediction model (FreqSP). We first label each video with the sharpening\nlevel correlating to the optimal bitrate and quality tradeoff as ground truth.\nThen taking uncompressed source videos as inputs, the proposed FreqSP leverages\nintricate CNN features and high-frequency components to estimate the optimal\nsharpening level.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a novel compression framework, TFZ, that preserves\nthe topology of 2D symmetric and asymmetric second-order tensor fields defined\non flat triangular meshes. A tensor field assigns a tensor - a\nmulti-dimensional array of numbers - to each point in space. Tensor fields,\nsuch as the stress and strain tensors, and the Riemann curvature tensor, are\nessential to both science and engineering. The topology of tensor fields\ncaptures the core structure of data, and is useful in various disciplines, such\nas graphics (for manipulating shapes and textures) and neuroscience (for\nanalyzing brain structures from diffusion MRI). Lossy data compression may\ndistort the topology of tensor fields, thus hindering downstream analysis and\nvisualization tasks. TFZ ensures that certain topological features are\npreserved during lossy compression. Specifically, TFZ preserves degenerate\npoints essential to the topology of symmetric tensor fields and retains\neigenvector and eigenvalue graphs that represent the topology of asymmetric\ntensor fields. TFZ scans through each cell, preserving the local topology of\neach cell, and thereby ensuring certain global topological guarantees.

    "abstract": "We use cosmological hydrodynamic simulations (IllustrisTNG and SIMBA) to\nexplore the redshift, luminosity, and black hole mass dependence of the quasar\nhalo occupation distribution (HOD). In both simulations, we find that the\nquasar activity is quenched at a characteristic halo mass ($\\sim 10^{13}\nM_{\\odot}$) scale affecting the nature of its occupation distribution function.\nWe note that the quenching is more pronounced at low redshifts for quasars\nselected through a luminosity threshold. We show that a very significant bias\n(a factor of $\\sim 10-50$ in the central occupation and $\\sim 10-70\\%$ in the\nsatellite occupation fraction) is introduced in the reconstruction of quasar\nhost halo mass distributions from the observed two-point-correlation function,\nif the HOD modeling does not account for the quenching effect in the central\noccupation function. While there is strong suppression of the occupation\nfraction of central quasars, the satellite occupation still follows a power-law\nlike behavior. Our results show that the global satellite fraction of quasars\nincreases monotonically from high to low redshifts, with $20-40 \\%$ of the\nquasars being satellite at intermediate redshifts, consistent with previous\nclustering based estimates. In addition, our study reveals that while the\noccupation function of quasars depends on redshift, luminosity, and feedback\nmodes, there is hardly any evolution in the supermassive black hole (SMBH;\nmass-selected sample) occupation. The SMBH HOD over the entire parameter space\nis well-modeled by a power-law and a step function similar to what has been\nfound for galaxies and low-luminosity active galactic nuclei.",

Data from Scopus covers articles\npublished before (2020-2021) and after (2022-2023) the war's onset. Statistical\nanalysis revealed a small but significant correlation between APC amounts and\ncitation impact, though the effect size was minimal, suggesting higher APCs did\nnot substantially boost citations. APC waivers offered by major publishers such\nas Springer and Elsevier since 2022 have led to only a slight increase in\narticles authored solely by Ukrainian scholars in their journals. Despite these\nwaivers, MDPI and Aluna Publishing House maintained the largest shares of such\npublications, likely due to low rejection rates, fast publication, and - in\nAluna's case - reduced APCs for Ukrainian authors. Between 2020 and 2023, the\nnumber of articles authored solely by Ukrainian scholars in foreign journals\nfell by 25.7%, and total APC spending declined by 24.6%, from EUR 1.24 million\nto EUR 0.93 million.

We develop a bottleneck model where\ncommuters choose their departure times and mode of travel between SAVs and NVs,\nand analyze equilibria under three SAV-fare scenarios: marginal-cost pricing,\naverage-cost pricing, and unregulated monopoly pricing. Marginal-cost pricing\nreduces commuting costs but results in financial deficits for the service\nprovider. Average-cost pricing ensures financial sustainability but has\ncontrasting effects depending on the timing of implementation due to the\nexistence of multiple equilibria: when implemented too early, it discourages\nadoption of SAVs and increases commuting costs; when introduced after SAV\nadoption reaches the monopoly equilibrium level, it promotes high adoption and\nachieves substantial cost reductions without a deficit. We also show that\nexpanding road capacity may increase commuting costs under average-cost\npricing, demonstrating the Downs--Thomson paradox in transportation systems\nwith SAVs. We next examine two optimal policies that improve social cost,\nincluding the operator's profit: the first-best policy that combines\nmarginal-cost pricing with congestion tolls, and the second-best policy that\nrelies on fare regulation alone. Our analysis shows that these policies can\nlimit excessive adoption by discouraging overuse of SAVs. This suggests that\npromoting SAV adoption does not always lower social cost.",

Comparing outputs from successive models,\nGPT-5 Thinking moves far beyond the plug-and-chug tendencies seen earlier: on a\nclassic elevator problem it works symbolically, notes when variables cancel,\nand verifies results; attempts to prompt novice-like behavior mainly affect\ntone, not method. On representation translation, the model scores 24/26 (92.3%)\non TUG-Kv4.0. In a card-sorting proxy using two of my comprehensive finals (60\nitems), its categories reflect solution method rather than surface features.\nSolving those same exams, it attains 27/30 and 25/30, with most misses in\nruler-based ray tracing and circuit interpretation. On epistemology, five\nindependent CLASS runs yield 100\\% favorable, indicating a simulated\nexpert-like stance. Framed as a \"boiling frog\" problem, the paper argues for a\ndecisive jump: retire credit-bearing unsupervised closed-response online\nassessments; grade process evidence; use paper, whiteboarding; shift weight to\nmodeling, data, and authentic labs; require transparent, citable AI use;\nrebuild problem types; and lean on research-based instruction and peer\nlearning. The opportunity is to foreground what AI cannot substitute for:\nmodeling the world, arguing from evidence, and making principled\napproximations.",

The MHONGOOSE\nsurvey has mapped atomic hydrogen emission in $30$ nearby dwarf and spiral\ngalaxies. Each galaxy is imaged at multiple resolution levels with\nunprecedented dynamic range in spatial resolution (from $\\sim 10''$ to $ 90''$)\nand HI sensitivity, with the latter varying by almost a factor of $30$ across\nall resolution scales. We use radial weighting functions to combine kinematic\nmodels from all resolution levels. The weights are derived from the residuals\nof model fits to a set of simulated galaxy observations with known rotation\ncurves and geometries. We obtain combined (weighted and smoothed) inclination\nand position angle profiles for each galaxy. These suppress the sharp, often\nunphysical radial fluctuations arising in single-resolution profiles. We then\nfit the rotation speed and velocity dispersion profiles at each resolution\nlevel with the geometric profiles fixed to the combined profiles, finally\ncombining these using the same weighting and smoothing approach. The combined\nrotation curves utilise all of the available information and have smaller\ntypical errors compared to those obtained using a single resolution level,\nparticularly near the centres and outer edges of models. This initial\ndemonstration is promising; there is scope to further refine the process to use\nsuch information-rich observations to their full potential.",

The proposed method was evaluated on a dataset of\nimages and demonstrated significant reductions in the time to compress, CPU\nutilization, and memory consumption, and preserves data integrity as seen\nthrough the low RMSE values. The optimized version of the Arithmetic Coding\nalgorithm achieves an impressive compression ratio of 814:1 and 101 ms to\ncompress a single image.

This project aims to incorporate recent developments in AM mirror design,\nwith a focus on manufacture, testing & evaluation.

The mirror geometry is annular with an external\ndiameter of 84 mm and an internal diameter of 32 mm; the optical prescription\nis flat for ease of manufacture. Prototypes were printed in AlSi10Mg, a\nlow-cost aluminium alloy commonly used in metal additive manufacturing. They\nwere then machined and single-point diamond turned to achieve a reflective\nsurface. Both quantitative & qualitative evaluations of the optical surface\nwere conducted to assess the effect of hot isostatic pressing (HIP) on the\noptical surface quality.

While most prior works\nfocus on opinion evolution surrounding specific isolated events or the views\nwithin a country, ours is the first to model the large-scale attitude evolution\nof a population representing an entire country towards another -- US citizens'\nperspectives towards China. To tackle the challenges of this broad scenario, we\npropose a framework that integrates media data collection, user profile\ncreation, and cognitive architecture for opinion updates to successfully\nreproduce the real trend of US attitudes towards China over a 20-year period\nfrom 2005 to today.

The simulation results, beyond\nvalidating our framework architecture, also reveal the impact of biased framing\nand selection bias in shaping attitudes. Overall, our work contributes to a new\nparadigm for LLM-based modeling of cognitive behaviors in a large-scale,\nlong-term, cross-border social context, providing insights into the formation\nof international biases and offering valuable implications for media consumers\nto better understand the factors shaping their perspectives, and ultimately\ncontributing to the larger social need for bias reduction and cross-cultural\ntolerance.",

To simultaneously address these issues, we\npropose EditMF, a training-free fingerprinting paradigm that achieves highly\nimperceptible fingerprint embedding with minimal computational overhead.\nOwnership bits are mapped to compact, semantically coherent triples drawn from\nan encrypted artificial knowledge base (e.g., virtual author-novel-protagonist\nfacts). Causal tracing localizes the minimal set of layers influencing each\ntriple, and a zero-space update injects the fingerprint without perturbing\nunrelated knowledge. Verification requires only a single black-box query and\nsucceeds when the model returns the exact pre-embedded protagonist. Empirical\nresults on LLaMA and Qwen families show that EditMF combines high\nimperceptibility with negligible model's performance loss, while delivering\nrobustness far beyond LoRA-based fingerprinting and approaching that of SFT\nembeddings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EditMF is an effective and\nlow-overhead solution for secure LLM ownership verification.",

As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly common, AI's\nability to recognize and respond to human emotions is crucial for effective\nhuman-AI interactions.

However, the emotional intelligence of AI,\nparticularly multimodal large language models (MLLMs), remains largely\nunexplored. This study evaluates the emotion recognition abilities of MLLMs\nusing the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) and its multiracial\ncounterpart (MRMET), and compares their performance against human participants.\nResults show that, on average, MLLMs outperform humans in accurately\nidentifying emotions across both tests.

Yet when we\naggregate independent human decisions to simulate collective intelligence,\nhuman groups significantly surpass the performance of aggregated MLLM\npredictions, highlighting the wisdom of the crowd. Moreover, a collaborative\napproach (augmented intelligence) that combines human and MLLM predictions\nachieves greater accuracy than either humans or MLLMs alone.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained on fixed snapshots of the\nweb, which means that their knowledge becomes stale and their predictions risk\ntemporal leakage: relying on information that lies in the future relative to a\nquery. We tackle this problem by pre-training from scratch a set of GPT-style\nexperts on disjoint two-year slices of a 2013-2024 corpus and combining them\nthrough TiMoE, a Time-aware Mixture of Language Experts. At inference time,\nTiMoE masks all experts whose training window ends after the query timestamp\nand merges the remaining log-probabilities in a shared space, guaranteeing\nstrict causal validity while retaining the breadth of multi-period knowledge.\nWe also release TSQA, a 10k-question benchmark whose alternatives are\nexplicitly labelled as past, future or irrelevant, allowing fine-grained\nmeasurement of temporal hallucinations. Experiments on eight standard NLP tasks\nplus TSQA show that a co-adapted TiMoE variant matches or exceeds the best\nsingle-period expert and cuts future-knowledge errors by up to 15%. Our results\ndemonstrate that modular, time-segmented pre-training paired with causal\nrouting is a simple yet effective path toward LLMs that stay chronologically\ngrounded without sacrificing general performance much.

    "abstract": "This work presents a novel framework for No-Reference Image Quality\nAssessment (NR-IQA) founded on the analysis of directional image curvature.\nWithin this framework, we define a measure of Anisotropic Texture Richness\n(ATR), which is computed at the pixel level using two tunable thresholds -- one\npermissive and one restrictive -- that quantify orthogonal texture suppression.\nWhen its parameters are optimized for a specific artifact, the resulting ATR\nscore serves as a high-performance quality metric, achieving Spearman\ncorrelations with human perception of approximately -0.93 for Gaussian blur and\n-0.95 for white noise on the LIVE dataset. The primary contribution is a\ntwo-stage system that leverages the differential response of ATR to various\ndistortions. First, the system utilizes the signature from two specialist ATR\nconfigurations to classify the primary artifact type (blur vs. noise) with over\n97% accuracy. Second, following classification, it employs a dedicated\nregression model mapping the relevant ATR score to a quality rating to quantify\nthe degradation. On a combined dataset, the complete system predicts human\nscores with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.892 and a Root Mean Square\nError (RMSE) of 5.17 DMOS points. This error corresponds to just 7.4% of the\ndataset's total quality range, demonstrating high predictive accuracy. This\nestablishes our framework as a robust, dual-purpose tool for the classification\nand subsequent quantification of image degradation.",

In-memory computing\narchitectures are proposed to avoid the Von Neumann bottleneck. However, both\ndigital/binary-based and analogue in-memory computing architectures suffer from\nvarious limitations, which significantly degrade the performance and energy\nefficiency gains. This work proposes OISMA, a novel in-memory computing\narchitecture that utilizes the computational simplicity of a quasi-stochastic\ncomputing domain (Bent-Pyramid system), while keeping the same efficiency,\nscalability, and productivity of digital memories. OISMA converts normal memory\nread operations into in-situ stochastic multiplication operations with a\nnegligible cost. An accumulation periphery then accumulates the output\nmultiplication bitstreams, achieving the matrix multiplication functionality.\nExtensive matrix multiplication benchmarking was conducted to analyze the\naccuracy of the Bent-Pyramid system, using matrix dimensions ranging from 4x4\nto 512x512. The accuracy results show a significant decrease in the average\nrelative Frobenius error, from 9.42% (for 4x4) to 1.81% (for 512x512), compared\nto 64-bit double precision floating-point format. A 1T1R OISMA array of 4 KB\ncapacity was implemented using a commercial 180nm technology node and in-house\nRRAM technology. At 50 MHz, OISMA achieves 0.891 TOPS/W and 3.98 GOPS/mm2 for\nenergy and area efficiency, respectively, occupying an effective computing area\nof 0.804241 mm2. Scaling OISMA from 180nm to 22nm technology shows a\nsignificant improvement of two orders of magnitude in energy efficiency and one\norder of magnitude in area efficiency, compared to dense matrix multiplication\nin-memory computing architectures.",

    "abstract": "We propose a universal physical mechanism for the emergence of 1/f\nfluctuations, observed across a wide range of systems. In particular, we verify\nthis on acoustic cases. The mechanism is based on amplitude modulation (AM) and\ndemodulation (DM), where the 1/f spectral law arises not in the raw waveform\nbut in its demodulated amplitude envelope. Two distinct yet complementary\nprocesses generate the required AM: (i) stochastic synchronization among\noscillators, modeled via an extended Kuramoto framework that captures perpetual\nsynchronization-desynchronization cycles, and (ii) frequency-selective\nresonance, modeled by spectral accumulation of eigenmodes in acoustic or\nstructural environments. Numerical simulations demonstrate that both\nmechanisms, acting separately or in combination, robustly produce 1/f spectra\nover several decades when DM is applied, and that the classical Kuramoto\ncritical point is not necessary for their emergence. We demonstrate the\ncross-domain relevance of this AM/DM framework through analyses of musical\nperformances, seismic records, and astrophysical time series, revealing a\ncommon underlying structure. This work establishes demodulation as a general\nroute to 1/f fluctuations, providing a simple and scalable explanation for its\nubiquity in both natural and engineered systems.\n  Keywords: 1/f fluctuation, amplitude modulation, synchronization, resonance,\nKuramoto model, music, natural noise, demodulation",

    "abstract": "In this paper, the evaporation of neighbouring multi-component droplets or\nrivulets - often found in applications such as inkjet printing, spray cooling,\nand pesticide delivery - is studied numerically and theoretically. The\nproximity induces a shielding effect that reduces individual evaporation rates\nand disrupts the symmetry of both the concentration profile and the flow field\nin the liquids. We examine how the symmetry of flow and concentration fields is\naffected by key parameters, namely the contact angle, the inter-droplet (or\ninter-rivulet) distance, and the magnitude of surface tension gradient forces\n(i.e. the Marangoni number). We focus on binary mixtures, such as water and\n1,2-hexanediol, where only one component evaporates and evaporation is slow,\nthereby allowing simplifications to the governing equations. To manage the\ncomplexity of the full three-dimensional droplet problem, we begin with a\ntwo-dimensional model of neighbouring rivulets. Solving the complete transient\nequations for rivulets with pinned contact lines and fixed inter-rivulet\ndistance reveals that the asymmetry - quantified by the position of the\ninterfacial stagnation point of the flow - diminishes over time. Using a\nvalidated quasi-stationary model, we find, with increasing contact angle and\ninter-rivulet distance, that the stagnation point migrates closer to the\ncentre, yet it remains unaffected by the Marangoni number. A simplified\nlubrication model applied to droplets shows similar dependencies on contact\nangle and distance, although here the stagnation point appears to vary with the\nMarangoni number. We attribute this dependence to the additional azimuthal flow\nin droplets, leading to a non-linear evolution of the concentration and\ntherefore a non-trivial dependence of the symmetry on the Marangoni number.",

However, their regional-scale influence on hillslope\nprocesses remains poorly understood due to limited observational coverage and\nthe masking effects of long-wavelength post-seismic signals. This knowledge gap\nconstrains our ability to assess post-seismic landslide hazards, particularly\nsince actively deforming hillslopes may evolve into rapid failures, especially\nunder the influence of meteorological factors following a major earthquake.\nThis study addresses this gap by analyzing slope instability across\napproximately 66,800sq.km of southeastern T\\\"urkiye in the aftermath of the\nFebruary 6, 2023, Kahramanmara\\c{s} earthquake sequence. We used Sentinel-1\nInSAR time series spanning three years before and one year after the\nearthquakes and applied a convolution-based filtering method to isolate\nlocalized surface deformation from broader tectonic signals. Given the\nchallenge of validating deformation anomalies at a regional scale without\nin-situ measurements, we cross-checked these locations using high-resolution\noptical imagery and assigned confidence levels based on observable surface\nfeatures indicative of slow-moving landslides. The resulting inventories were\nfurther enriched by expert-based assessments. Our results show that the total\narea affected by slow-moving landslides increased from 12.36sq.km to\n159.38sq.km, reflecting a more than 12-fold rise. While a substantial number of\nslopes were newly activated (348), others became stabilized (28) or shifted to\ndifferent deformation states (20). These findings highlight the complex\nresponse of hillslopes to seismic forcing and emphasize the importance of\nlong-term monitoring to capture the full spectrum of earthquake-induced\nlandslide behavior.",

To effectively\nidentify root alarms, it is essential to learn relation among the alarms for\naccurate and faster resolution. In this work we propose a novel unsupervised\nalarm relation learning technique Temporal Optimization (TempOpt) that is\npractical and overcomes the limitations of an existing class of alarm\nrelational learning method-temporal dependency methods. Experiments have been\ncarried on real-world network datasets, that demonstrate the improved quality\nof alarm relations learned by TempOpt as compared to temporal dependency\nmethod.",

Recent methods\nbased on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) enable efficient single-concept\ncustomization by injecting lightweight, concept-specific adapters into\npre-trained diffusion models. However, combining multiple LoRA modules for\nmulti-concept generation often leads to identity missing and visual feature\nleakage. In this work, we identify two key issues behind these failures: (1)\ntoken-wise interference among different LoRA modules, and (2) spatial\nmisalignment between the attention map of a rare token and its corresponding\nconcept-specific region. To address these issues, we propose Token-Aware LoRA\n(TARA), which introduces a token mask to explicitly constrain each module to\nfocus on its associated rare token to avoid interference, and a training\nobjective that encourages the spatial attention of a rare token to align with\nits concept region. Our method enables training-free multi-concept composition\nby directly injecting multiple independently trained TARA modules at inference\ntime. Experimental results demonstrate that TARA enables efficient\nmulti-concept inference and effectively preserving the visual identity of each\nconcept by avoiding mutual interference between LoRA modules.

Although existing methods achieve real-time inference\nthrough lightweight designs, we reveal their inherent limitation: misalignment\nbetween class representations and image features caused by a per-pixel\nclassification paradigm. With experimental analysis, we find that this paradigm\nresults in a highly challenging assumption for efficient scenarios: Image pixel\nfeatures should not vary for the same category in different images. To address\nthis dilemma, we propose a coupled dual-branch offset learning paradigm that\nexplicitly learns feature and class offsets to dynamically refine both class\nrepresentations and spatial image features. Based on the proposed paradigm, we\nconstruct an efficient semantic segmentation network, OffSeg.

    "abstract": "Face aging or de-aging with generative AI has gained significant attention\nfor its applications in such fields like forensics, security, and media.\nHowever, most state of the art methods rely on conditional Generative\nAdversarial Networks (GANs), Diffusion-based models, or Visual Language Models\n(VLMs) to age or de-age faces based on predefined age categories and\nconditioning via loss functions, fine-tuning, or text prompts. The reliance on\nsuch conditioning leads to complex training requirements, increased data needs,\nand challenges in generating consistent results. Additionally, identity\npreservation is rarely taken into accountor evaluated on a single face\nrecognition system without any control or guarantees on whether identity would\nbe preserved in a generated aged/de-aged face. In this paper, we propose to\nsynthesize aged and de-aged faces via editing latent space of StyleGAN2 using a\nsimple support vector modeling of aging/de-aging direction and several feature\nselection approaches. By using two state-of-the-art face recognition systems,\nwe empirically find the identity preserving subspace within the StyleGAN2\nlatent space, so that an apparent age of a given face can changed while\npreserving the identity. We then propose a simple yet practical formula for\nestimating the limits on aging/de-aging parameters that ensures identity\npreservation for a given input face. Using our method and estimated parameters\nwe have generated a public dataset of synthetic faces at different ages that\ncan be used for benchmarking cross-age face recognition, age assurance systems,\nor systems for detection of synthetic images.

Attributed hypergraph node and hyperedge\nembedding (AHNEE) maps nodes and hyperedges to compact vectors for use in\nimportant tasks such as node classification, hyperedge link prediction, and\nhyperedge classification. Generating high-quality embeddings is challenging due\nto the complexity of attributed hypergraphs and the need to embed both nodes\nand hyperedges, especially in large-scale data. Existing solutions often fall\nshort by focusing only on nodes or lacking native support for attributed\nhypergraphs, leading to inferior quality, and struggle with scalability on\nlarge attributed hypergraphs.\n  We propose SAHE, an efficient and effective approach that unifies node and\nhyperedge embeddings for AHNEE computation, advancing the state of the art via\ncomprehensive embedding formulations and algorithmic designs. First, we\nintroduce two higher-order similarity measures, HMS-N and HMS-E, to capture\nsimilarities between node pairs and hyperedge pairs, respectively. These\nmeasures consider multi-hop connections and global topology within an extended\nhypergraph that incorporates attribute-based hyperedges. SAHE formulates the\nAHNEE objective to jointly preserve all-pair HMS-N and HMS-N similarities.\nDirect optimization is computationally expensive, so we analyze and unify core\napproximations of all-pair HMS-N and HMS-N to solve them simultaneously. To\nenhance efficiency, we design several non-trivial optimizations that avoid\niteratively materializing large dense matrices while maintaining high-quality\nresults. Extensive experiments on diverse attributed hypergraphs and 3\ndownstream tasks, compared against 11 baselines, show that SAHE consistently\noutperforms existing methods in embedding quality and is up to orders of\nmagnitude faster.",

By studying chemical insertion of solid,\nliquid and gaseous Na at low and high temperatures (LT, HT) as well as using\nelectrochemical insertion at 25 degree Celsius into uncoated and coated HOPG,\nit became clear that insertion equilibrium requires HT. On decreasing chemical\nintercalation temperature from HT (500 degree Celsius) to LT (25 degree\nCelsius), thermodynamic control was found to change to diffusion control and\nfinally to interfacial control. For the electrochemical insertion, coating\n(TiO2) proved advisable (to avoid co-intercalation) and efficient in reducing\nthe interfacial resistance. Measured saturation values were found to be not\nhigher than about 1 mol %. Towards room temperature higher equilibrium values\ncannot be excluded but would in view of the very low driving force kinetically\nbe very difficult to reach. The reversible cell voltage of the saturated\ncomposition (versus alkali metal) is distinctly lower than for the analogous\ncells using lithium (Li) or potassium (K). Detailed transmission electron\nmicroscopy (TEM) studies reveal the unexpected fact that at HT Na predominantly\nenters HOPG in the form of two-sided intercalation sandwiching carbon layers\n(bilayers), while at LT more highly aggregated layers appear to a comparable\ndegree, accompanied with the formation of higher-dimensional crystal\nimperfections.

SSFP\nis one of the earliest and most widely used NMR pulse sequences, yet its\nanalyses have focused on isolated spin-half ensembles such as water. The\npresent study demonstrates that significant deviations from such isolated\nspin-half behavior may occur when SSFP is applied in the presence of spin-spin\ncouplings. Even in the simplest case supporting such couplings, a single 13C J\ncoupled to a 1H, departures from the isolated spin-half behavior arise in the\n13C SSFP response, both in the absence and in the presence of 1H spin\ndecoupling. In the former case deviations are produced by the differential\nrelaxation of antiphase two-spin terms generated by the pulse train; in the\nlatter case, magnified interferences may arise between the SSFP pulses and the\ncoherent perturbation arising upon 1H decoupling. Although both phenomena are\nalso known in FT NMR, the spectral distortions that they will originate may be\nmuch larger in the SSFP case, particularly if interpulse delays in large flip\nangle SSFP pulse trains resonate with the coupling perturbations. The origins\nof these effects are here analyzed for heteronuclear spin-half systems and\ncorroborated with 13C NMR SSFP experiments recorded under different conditions.\nAdditional considerations aimed at magnifying or suppressing these effects, as\nwell as extensions to more complex scenarios, are also briefly discussed.",

In this work, we propose an extended parameter shift rule (EPSR)\nwhich generalizes a broad range of existing PSRs and has the following two\nadvantages. First, EPSR offers an infinite number of possible parameter shifts,\nallowing the selection of the optimal parameter shifts to minimize the final\nderivative variance and thereby obtaining the more accurate derivative\nestimates with limited quantum resources. Second, EPSR extends the scope of the\nPSRs in the sense that EPSR can handle arbitrary Hermitian operator $H$ in gate\n$U(x) = \\exp (iHx)$ in the parameterized quantum circuits, while existing PSRs\nare valid only for simple Hermitian generators $H$ such as simple Pauli words.\nAdditionally, we show that the widely used ``general PSR'', introduced by\nWierichs et al. (2022), is a special case of our EPSR, and we prove that it\nyields globally optimal shifts for minimizing the derivative variance under the\nweighted-shot scheme. Finally, through numerical simulations, we demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of EPSR and show that the usage of the optimal parameter\nshifts indeed leads to more accurate derivative estimates.",

However, in real-world\ndeployments, failures of computational components are inevitable, presenting a\ncritical challenge: ensuring that multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)\npolicies remain effective even when some agents malfunction. We propose the\nMulti-Agent Robust Training Algorithm (MARTA), a plug-and-play framework for\ntraining MARL agents to be resilient to potentially severe faults. MARTA\noperates in cooperative multi-agent settings where agents may lose the ability\nto execute their intended actions. It learns to identify failure scenarios that\nare especially detrimental to system performance and equips agents with\nstrategies to mitigate their impact. At the heart of MARTA is a novel\nadversarial Markov game in which an adversary -- modelled via \\emph{Markov\nswitching controls} -- learns to disable agents in high-risk state regions,\nwhile the remaining agents are trained to \\emph{jointly} best-respond to such\ntargeted malfunctions. To ensure practicality, MARTA enforces a malfunction\nbudget, constraining the adversary to a fixed number of failures and learning\nrobust policies accordingly. We provide theoretical guarantees that MARTA\nconverges to a Markov perfect equilibrium, ensuring agents optimally counteract\nworst-case faults. Empirically, we show that MARTA achieves state-of-the-art\nfault-tolerant performance across benchmark environments, including Multi-Agent\nParticle World and Level-Based Foraging.",

Part-based rendering\nparadigms, guided by human segmentation, allow for flexible parameter\nallocation based on structural complexity, thereby enhancing representational\nefficiency. However, existing methods still struggle with complex pose\nvariations, often producing unnatural transitions at part boundaries and\nfailing to reconstruct occluded regions accurately in monocular settings. We\npropose MonoPartNeRF, a novel framework for monocular dynamic human rendering\nthat ensures smooth transitions and robust occlusion recovery. First, we build\na bidirectional deformation model that combines rigid and non-rigid\ntransformations to establish a continuous, reversible mapping between\nobservation and canonical spaces. Sampling points are projected into a\nparameterized surface-time space (u, v, t) to better capture non-rigid motion.\nA consistency loss further suppresses deformation-induced artifacts and\ndiscontinuities. We introduce a part-based pose embedding mechanism that\ndecomposes global pose vectors into local joint embeddings based on body\nregions. This is combined with keyframe pose retrieval and interpolation, along\nthree orthogonal directions, to guide pose-aware feature sampling. A learnable\nappearance code is integrated via attention to model dynamic texture changes\neffectively.

ReQuestNet comprises of two sub-units, CoarseNet\nfollowed by RefinementNet. CoarseNet performs per PRG, per transmit-receive\n(Tx-Rx) stream channel estimation, while RefinementNet refines the CoarseNet\nchannel estimate by incorporating correlations across differently precoded\nPRGs, and correlation across multiple input multiple output (MIMO) channel\nspatial dimensions (cross-MIMO).

In this paper, we investigate the privacy-protected\nRAG scenario for the first time, where entities in KGs are anonymous for LLMs,\nthus preventing them from accessing entity semantics. Due to the loss of\nsemantics of entities, previous RAG systems cannot retrieve question-relevant\nknowledge from KGs by matching questions with the meaningless identifiers of\nanonymous entities. To realize an effective RAG system in this scenario, two\nkey challenges must be addressed: (1) How can anonymous entities be converted\ninto retrievable information. (2) How to retrieve question-relevant anonymous\nentities. Hence, we propose a novel ARoG framework including relation-centric\nabstraction and structure-oriented abstraction strategies. For challenge (1),\nthe first strategy abstracts entities into high-level concepts by dynamically\ncapturing the semantics of their adjacent relations. It supplements meaningful\nsemantics which can further support the retrieval process. For challenge (2),\nthe second strategy transforms unstructured natural language questions into\nstructured abstract concept paths. These paths can be more effectively aligned\nwith the abstracted concepts in KGs, thereby improving retrieval performance.\nTo guide LLMs to effectively retrieve knowledge from KGs, the two strategies\nstrictly protect privacy from being exposed to LLMs. Experiments on three\ndatasets demonstrate that ARoG achieves strong performance and\nprivacy-robustness.",

Compared to human pose estimation, animal pose estimation\nis more challenging due to high interspecies morphological diversity, complex\nbody structures, and limited annotated data. In this work, we introduce\nDiffPose-Animal, a novel diffusion-based framework for top-down animal pose\nestimation. Unlike traditional heatmap regression methods, DiffPose-Animal\nreformulates pose estimation as a denoising process under the generative\nframework of diffusion models. To enhance semantic guidance during keypoint\ngeneration, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to extract both global\nanatomical priors and local keypoint-wise semantics based on species-specific\nprompts. These textual priors are encoded and fused with image features via\ncross-attention modules to provide biologically meaningful constraints\nthroughout the denoising process. Additionally, a diffusion-based keypoint\ndecoder is designed to progressively refine pose predictions, improving\nrobustness to occlusion and annotation sparsity. Extensive experiments on\npublic animal pose datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization\ncapability of our method, especially under challenging scenarios with diverse\nspecies, cluttered backgrounds, and incomplete keypoints.",

This\nwork introduces a patient-adaptive focused transmit scheme that has the ability\nto drastically reduce the number of transmits needed to produce a high-quality\nultrasound image. The method relies on posterior sampling with a temporal\ndiffusion model to perceive and reconstruct the anatomy based on partial\nobservations, while subsequently taking an action to acquire the most\ninformative transmits.

Furthermore, we\nshow it achieves better performance in terms of generalized contrast-to-noise\nratio when compared to the same number of diverging waves transmits on three\nin-house echocardiograms.

However, real-world scenarios are more complex, often requiring\nthe recognition of an object in a cluttered scene based on a vague, free-form\ndescription. To this end, we present ROOMELSA, a new benchmark designed to\nevaluate a system's ability to interpret natural language. Specifically,\nROOMELSA attends to a specific region within a panoramic room image and\naccurately retrieves the corresponding 3D model from a large database. In\naddition, ROOMELSA includes over 1,600 apartment scenes, nearly 5,200 rooms,\nand more than 44,000 targeted queries. Empirically, while coarse object\nretrieval is largely solved, only one top-performing model consistently ranked\nthe correct match first across nearly all test cases. Notably, a lightweight\nCLIP-based model also performed well, although it struggled with subtle\nvariations in materials, part structures, and contextual cues, resulting in\noccasional errors. These findings highlight the importance of tightly\nintegrating visual and language understanding. By bridging the gap between\nscene-level grounding and fine-grained 3D retrieval, ROOMELSA establishes a new\nbenchmark for advancing robust, real-world 3D recognition systems.",

The basic contents are constructed from the support\nmeasures of the set itself, while the support contents arise from those of its\nparallel sets. Associated scaling exponents characterize the asymptotic\nbehavior of these measures as the resolution parameter tends to zero. We\nestablish a fundamental connection between the maximum of the basic scaling\nexponents and the outer Minkowski dimension. The proof relies on the novel\nnotion of outer box dimension. Furthermore, we explore how support contents\nsupply aggregated information on geometric features that is provided separately\nby the basic contents, and how they relate to fractal curvatures and complex\ndimensions. Our results provide a deeper understanding of which geometric\naspects actually contribute to fractal invariants such as the (outer) Minkowski\ncontent. We provide some illustrative examples.",

The\nhybrid technology of these two ingredients is expected to be a powerful tool to\nsolve complex problems in many branches of science and engineering such as\ncombinatorial optimization problems and accelerate the creation of\nnext-generation technologies. In this work, we develop an algorithm to solve a\nblack-box optimization problem by improving Factorization Machine Annealing\n(FMA) such that the training of a machine learning model called Factorization\nMachine is performed not by a full dataset but by a subdataset which is sampled\nfrom a full dataset: Subsampling Factorization Machine Annealing (SFMA).\nAccording to such a probabilistic training process, the performance of FMA on\nexploring a solution space gets enhanced. As a result, SFMA exhibits balanced\nperformance of exploration and exploitation which we call\nexploitation-exploration functionality. We conduct numerical benchmarking tests\nto compare the performance of SFMA with that of FMA. Consequently, SFMA\ncertainly exhibits the exploration-exploitation functionality and outperforms\nFMA in speed and accuracy. In addition, the performance of SFMA can be further\nimproved by sequentially using two subsampling datasets with different sizes\nsuch that the size of the latter dataset is substantially smaller than the\nformer. Such a substantial reduction not only enhances the exploration\nperformance of SFMA but also enables us to run it with correspondingly low\ncomputational cost even for a large-scale problem.

Our two-stage profile-aware approach first constructs natural-language\nuser profiles distilled from 90 days of listening history.

Rather than prompting the\nLLM with raw data, we use these profiles to provide high-level, semantically\nrich context-enabling the LLM to reason more effectively about alignment\nbetween a user's interests and recommended episodes. This reduces input\ncomplexity and improves interpretability. The LLM is then prompted to deliver\nfine-grained pointwise and pairwise judgments based on the profile-episode\nmatch. In a controlled study with 47 participants, our profile-aware judge\nmatched human judgments with high fidelity and outperformed or matched a\nvariant using raw listening histories.

    "abstract": "A Multi-Reflection Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometer (MR-ToF-MS) has been\ncommissioned at the Ion-Guide Isotope Separator On-Line (IGISOL) facility. It\nconsists of six electrode pairs that form a nearly energy-isochronous potential\nand a pulsed drift-tube to trap the ions between the electrodes. Time-of-flight\npeak widths down to 22 ns full-width at half-maximum and mass-resolving powers\nof $\\approx 1.5 \\times 10^5$ within 20 ms have been demonstrated. The obtained\ntime-focus and mass-resolving power depend sensitively on the trapping energy,\nenergy spread and the number of revolutions of the ions. The mass-resolving\npower is affected by the temporal and energy spread of the ions entering the\nMR-ToF-MS, and fluctuations in the electrode voltages due to temperature\nvariations. The longitudinal emittance corresponding to the temporal and energy\nspread of $^{39}$K is estimated to be 175 eVns based on the data, close to the\nexpected 186(10) eVns. The time-of-flight temperature sensitivity is found to\nbe -5.55(30) ppm/K. In addition to atomic mass measurements of short-lived\nexotic nuclides, the MR-ToF-MS can be used as a fast mass separator for various\nother experiments at IGISOL and as an ion counter for laser spectroscopy and\nyield measurements.",

    "abstract": "Augmented Reality (AR) systems are increasingly integrating foundation\nmodels, such as Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), to provide more\ncontext-aware and adaptive user experiences. This integration has led to the\ndevelopment of AR agents to support intelligent, goal-directed interactions in\nreal-world environments. While current AR agents effectively support immediate\ntasks, they struggle with complex multi-step scenarios that require\nunderstanding and leveraging user's long-term experiences and preferences. This\nlimitation stems from their inability to capture, retain, and reason over\nhistorical user interactions in spatiotemporal contexts. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a conceptual framework for memory-augmented AR agents\nthat can provide personalized task assistance by learning from and adapting to\nuser-specific experiences over time. Our framework consists of four\ninterconnected modules: (1) Perception Module for multimodal sensor processing,\n(2) Memory Module for persistent spatiotemporal experience storage, (3)\nSpatiotemporal Reasoning Module for synthesizing past and present contexts, and\n(4) Actuator Module for effective AR communication. We further present an\nimplementation roadmap, a future evaluation strategy, a potential target\napplication and use cases to demonstrate the practical applicability of our\nframework across diverse domains.

    "abstract": "In semi-supervised learning (SSL) for enhancing the performance of graph\nneural networks (GNNs) with unlabeled data, introducing mutually independent\ndecision factors for cross-validation is regarded as an effective strategy to\nalleviate pseudo-label confirmation bias and training collapse. However,\nobtaining such factors is challenging in practice: additional and valid\ninformation sources are inherently scarce, and even when such sources are\navailable, their independence from the original source cannot be guaranteed. To\naddress this challenge, In this paper we propose a Differentiated Factor\nConsistency Semi-supervised Framework (DiFac), which derives differentiated\nfactors from a single information source and enforces their consistency. During\npre-training, the model learns to extract these factors; in training, it\niteratively removes samples with conflicting factors and ranks pseudo-labels\nbased on the shortest stave principle, selecting the top candidate samples to\nreduce overconfidence commonly observed in confidence-based or ensemble-based\nmethods. Our framework can also incorporate additional information sources. In\nthis work, we leverage the large multimodal language model to introduce latent\ntextual knowledge as auxiliary decision factors, and we design a accountability\nscoring mechanism to mitigate additional erroneous judgments introduced by\nthese auxiliary factors. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate\nthat DiFac consistently improves robustness and generalization in low-label\nregimes, outperforming other baseline methods.",

When interpreted as arising from AGN broad-line regions, inferred black\nhole masses from local scaling relations exceed expectations given their\nstellar masses, challenging models of early black hole-galaxy co-evolution.\nHowever, radiative transfer effects in dense media may also impact the\nformation of hydrogen emission lines. We model three scattering processes\nshaping hydrogen line profiles: resonance scattering by hydrogen in the $n=2$\nstate, Raman scattering of UV radiation by ground-state hydrogen, and Thomson\nscattering by free electrons. Using 3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer\nsimulations with multi-branching resonance transitions, we examine their\nimprint on line shapes and ratios. Resonance scattering produces strong\ndeviations from Case B flux ratios, clear differences between H$\\alpha$ and\nH$\\beta$, and encodes gas kinematics in line profiles but cannot broaden\nH$\\beta$ due to conversion to Pa$\\alpha$. While Raman scattering can yield\nbroad wings, scattering of UV continuum is disfavored given the absence of\nstrong FWHM variations across transitions.

Recent studies found that the solar\neruptions could be initiated by a sequence of flux feeding processes, during\nwith chromospheric fibrils rise and merge with the pre-existing coronal flux\nrope. Further theoretical analyses have demonstrated that the normal flux\nfeeding, i.e. the axial magnetic flux within the fibril is in the same\ndirection as that in the flux rope, results in the accumulation of the total\naxial flux within the flux rope, so as to initiate the eruption. If the\ndirections of the axial flux in the fibril and the flux rope are opposite, it\nis termed inverse flux feeding, whose influence on coronal flux ropes, however,\nis still unclear. In this paper, we use a 2.5-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic\nmodel to simulate the evolution of coronal flux ropes associated with inverse\nflux feeding. It is found that inverse flux feeding is also efficient in\ncausing solar eruptions: although the total signed axial magnetic flux of the\nrope decreases after inverse flux feeding, the total unsigned axial flux can\naccumulate; the eruption occurs if the unsigned axial flux of the rope reaches\na critical value, which is almost the same as the threshold for normal flux\nfeeding. The total axial currents within the rope are also similar during the\nonset of the eruptions caused by both normal and inverse flux feeding. Our\nsimulation results suggest that it is the unsigned axial magnetic flux rather\nthan the signed axial flux that regulates the onset of coronal flux rope\neruptions.",

Our population-based analysis of 6,440,000 residents of Victoria,\nAustralia reveal strong indirect effects during the Delta outbreak\n(September-November 2021). By modelling a non-vaccination counterfactual, we\nconservatively estimate 316,000 infections were averted (95\\% BCI: 232k-406k),\nas well as 33,500 hospitalizations (95\\% BCI: 22.2k-46.2k), and 4,900 deaths\n(95\\% BCI: 2.9k-7.3k). These are 4.0, 7.5, and 8.0 times higher, respectively,\nthan observed. Half of the averted infections and around one-quarter of\nhospitalizations and deaths were attributable to indirect protection.\nHomogeneous vaccination across LGAs could have reduced outcomes by\napproximately 25\\%.",

In this work, we present optical observations of the redback\nmillisecond pulsar PSR J2339-0533, obtained with the SiFAP2 photometer mounted\non the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo. Data accumulated during the campaign with\nthe longest exposure time (12 hr) suggest that its $\\sim$18 mag optical\ncounterpart exhibits pulsations at the neutron star's spin frequency. This\ncandidate signal was identified by folding the optical time series using the\npulsar ephemeris derived from nearly simultaneous observations with the 64-m\nMurriyang (Parkes) radio telescope. The detection significance of the candidate\noptical signal identified in those data lies between 2.9 and 3.5 $\\sigma$,\ndepending on the statistical test employed. The pulsed signal has a duty cycle\nof $\\approx 1/32$, and the de-reddened pulsed magnitude in the V band is $(26.0\n\\pm 0.6)$ mag. At a distance of 1.7 kpc, this corresponds to a conversion\nefficiency of $\\sim 3 \\times 10^{-6}$ of the pulsar's spin-down power into\npulsed optical luminosity, comparable to values observed in young, isolated\npulsars like the Crab, but 50-100 times lower than in disk-accreting\nmillisecond pulsars. If confirmed, these findings suggest that optical\npulsations arise independently of an accretion disk and support the notion that\nsuch disks boost the optical emission efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Random-effects meta-analysis is widely used for synthesizing results across\nstudies, but the implicit assumption of normality in study-specific aggregate\ndata is often violated. Such violations can lead to biased estimates and\nmisleading conclusions, especially in meta-analyses with small studies or rare\nevents. A prominent example occurs with the log-odds ratio, which exhibits bias\nthat depends on the within-study sample sizes. We first show that conventional\nmethods assuming normality fail to eliminate such biases, even as the number of\nstudies increases. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a generalized\nlinear mixed-effects model that uses only aggregate data, accommodating a wide\nrange of outcome types, including binomial, Poisson, gamma, and other members\nof the exponential family, without requiring individual participant data. To\nenable valid interval estimation when the number of studies is small, we\nfurther propose a simple Bartlett correction for the test statistics. The\nproposed method yields consistent point estimators without relying on the\nnormality assumption and achieves accurate interval coverage across diverse\noutcome types. It is particularly applicable in clinical and epidemiological\nresearch where only summary data are available, making it a practical\nalternative to conventional approaches. Simulation studies and applications to\nthree published meta-analyses with binary, Poisson, and gamma outcomes\ndemonstrate that the method provides reliable inference and maintains nominal\ncoverage, thereby supporting sound decision-making and guideline development\nwhen only aggregate data are available.",

    "abstract": "We consider the quantum creation of a universe with flat spatial sections and\nthe topology of a 3-torus, taking into account the effect of Casimir energy. We\nshow that the corresponding instantons are singular. Since these instantons\ndescribe universes originating in a state of infinite energy, we argue that\nthey cannot be interpreted as quantum creation from `nothing'. If quantum\ncorrections to the energy-momentum tensor are neglected, the spacetime of the\ntoroidal universe reduces to de Sitter space with appropriate periodic\nidentifications. Contrary to previous claims in the literature, this spacetime\nis geodesically incomplete. We argue that this spacetime describes a classical\nuniverse originating at a singularity, and not a quantum origin. We conclude\nthat the quantum creation of a toroidal universe from nothing cannot be\ndescribed in the context of semiclassical quantum gravity -- it is either\nimpossible, or it depends essentially on Planck-scale physics. We therefore see\nno reasonable way to compare the probability of creation of a toroidal\nuniverse, if it is possible at all, with that of a spherical universe.",

Unlike traditional recommendation methods, insights into the local\nquality of routes and comparisons between candidate routes are crucial for\nenhancing recommendation performance but often overlooked in previous studies.\nTo achieve these, we propose a novel model called Comprehensive Comparison\nNetwork (CCN). CCN not only uses query-level features (e.g. user features) and\nitem-level features (e.g. route features, item embedding) that are common in\ntraditional recommendations, but also introduces comparison-level features\nwhich describe the non-overlapping segments between different routes to capture\nthe local quality of routes. The key component Comprehensive Comparison Block\n(CCB) in CCN is designed to enable comparisons between routes. CCB includes a\nComprehensive Comparison Operator (CCO) and a multi-scenario MLP, which can\nupdate the representations of candidate routes based on a comprehensive\ncomparison. By stacking multiple CCBs, CCN can determine the final scores of\ncandidate routes and recommend the optimal one to the user. Additionally, since\nroutes directly affect the costs and risks experienced by users, the RR model\nmust be interpretable for online deployment. Therefore, we designed an\ninterpretable pair scoring network to achieve interpretability. Both offline\nand online experiments demonstrate that CCN significantly improves RR\nperformance and exhibits strong interpretability.

Moreover, when decoding multiple codewords in parallel, our\nderandomization load-balances the queries per-node, thereby preventing\ncongestion and maintaining a low round complexity.\n  Deterministic decoding of LDCs presents a new challenge: the adversary can\ntarget precisely the (few) nodes that are queried for decoding a certain\ncodeword. We overcome this issue via an adaptive doubling strategy: if a\ndecoding attempt for a codeword fails, the node doubles the number of its\ndecoding attempts. Similarly, when the adversary crashes the decoding node\nitself, we replace it dynamically with two other non-crashed nodes. By\ncarefully combining these two doubling processes, we overcome the challenges\nposed by the combination of a deterministic LDC with a worst case pattern of\ncrashes.",

    "abstract": "The classical majority-logic decoder proposed by Reed for Reed-Muller codes\nRM(r, m) of order r and length 2^m, unfolds in r+1 sequential steps, decoding\nmessage symbols from highest to lowest degree. Several follow-up decoding\nalgorithms reduced the number of steps, but for a limited set of parameters, or\nat the expense of reduced performance, or relying on the existence of some\ncombinatorial structures. We show that any one-step majority-logic decoder-that\nis, a decoder performing all majority votes in one step simultaneously without\nsequential processing-can correct at most d_min/4 errors for all values of r\nand m, where d_min denotes the code's minimum distance. We then introduce a new\nhard-decision decoder that completes the decoding in a single step and attains\nthis error-correction limit. It applies to all r and m, and can be viewed as a\nparallel realization of Reed's original algorithm, decoding all message symbols\nsimultaneously. Remarkably, we also prove that the decoder is optimum in the\nerasure setting: it recovers the message from any erasure pattern of up to\nd_min-1 symbols-the theoretical limit. To our knowledge, this is the first\n1-step decoder for RM codes that achieves both optimal erasure correction and\nthe maximum one-step error correction capability.",

In this work, under the realistic bounded\nsupport assumption, we prove the first polynomial discretization complexity for\nmulti-step and one-step RF-based models with a deterministic sampler\nsimultaneously. For the multi-step setting, inspired by the predictor-corrector\nframework of diffusion models, we introduce a Langevin process as a corrector\nand show that RF-based models can achieve better polynomial discretization\ncomplexity than diffusion models. To achieve this result, we conduct a detailed\nanalysis of the RF-based model and explain why it is better than previous\npopular models, such as variance preserving (VP) and variance exploding\n(VE)-based models. Based on the observation of multi-step RF-based models, we\nfurther provide the first polynomial discretization complexity result for\none-step RF-based models, improving upon prior results for one-step\ndiffusion-based models.

    "abstract": "Endogenous security in next-generation wireless communication systems\nattracts increasing attentions in recent years. A typical solution to\nendogenous security problems is the quantum key distribution (QKD), where\nunconditional security can be achieved thanks to the inherent properties of\nquantum mechanics. Continuous variable-quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) enjoys\nhigh secret key rate (SKR) and good compatibility with existing optical\ncommunication infrastructure. Traditional CV-QKD usually employ coherent\nreceivers to detect coherent states, whose detection performance is restricted\nto the standard quantum limit. In this paper, we employ a generalized Kennedy\nreceiver called CD-Kennedy receiver to enhance the detection performance of\ncoherent states in turbulent channels, where equal-gain combining (EGC) method\nis used to combine the output of CD-Kennedy receivers. Besides, we derive the\nSKR of a post-selection based CV-QKD protocol using both CD-Kennedy receiver\nand homodyne receiver with EGC in turbulent channels. We further propose an\nequivalent transmittance method to facilitate the calculation of both the\nbit-error rate (BER) and SKR. Numerical results show that the CD-Kennedy\nreceiver can outperform the homodyne receiver in turbulent channels in terms of\nboth BER and SKR performance. We find that BER and SKR performance advantage of\nCD-Kennedy receiver over homodyne receiver demonstrate opposite trends as the\naverage transmittance increases, which indicates that two separate system\nsettings should be employed for communication and key distribution purposes.\nBesides, we also demonstrate that the SKR performance of a CD-Kennedy receiver\nis much robust than that of a homodyne receiver in turbulent channels.",

    "abstract": "The real-time prediction of chaotic systems requires a nonlinear-reduced\norder model (ROM) to forecast the dynamics, and a stream of data from sensors\nto update the ROM. Data-driven ROMs are typically built with a two-step\nstrategy: data compression in a lower-dimensional latent space, and prediction\nof the temporal dynamics on it. To achieve real-time prediction, however, there\nare two challenges to overcome: (i) ROMs of chaotic systems can become\nnumerically unstable; and (ii) sensors' data are sparse, i.e., partial, and\nnoisy. To overcome these challenges, we propose a three-step strategy: (i) a\nconvolutional autoencoder (CAE) compresses the system's state onto a\nlower-dimensional latent space; (ii) a latent ROM (echo state network, ESN),\nwhich is formulated as a state-space model, predicts the temporal evolution on\nthe latent space; and (iii) sequential data assimilation based on the Ensemble\nKalman filter (EnKF) adaptively corrects the latent ROM by assimilating noisy\nand sparse measurements. This provides a numerically stable method\n(DA-CAE-ESN), which corrects itself every time that data becomes available from\nsensors. The DA-CAE-ESN is tested on spatio-temporally chaotic partial\ndifferential equations: the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and a\ntwo-dimensional Navier-Stokes equation (Kolmogorov flow). We show that the\nmethod provides accurate and stable forecasts across different levels of noise,\nsparsity, and sampling rates. As a by-product, the DA-CAE-ESN acts as a\nlocalization strategy that mitigates spurious correlations, which arise when\napplying the EnKF to high-dimensional systems. The DA-CAE-ESN provides a\nnumerically stable method to perform real-time predictions, which opens\nopportunities for deploying data-driven latent models.",

However, the interpretability of\ncomplex models remains a challenge, which limits their utility in medical\napplications. Recently, model-agnostic methods have been proposed to measure\nconditional variable importance and accommodate complex non-linear models.\nHowever, they often lack power when dealing with highly correlated data, a\ncommon problem in medical imaging. We introduce Hierarchical-CPI, a\nmodel-agnostic variable importance measure that frames the inference problem as\nthe discovery of groups of variables that are jointly predictive of the\noutcome. By exploring subgroups along a hierarchical tree, it remains\ncomputationally tractable, yet also enjoys explicit family-wise error rate\ncontrol. Moreover, we address the issue of vanishing conditional importance\nunder high correlation with a tree-based importance allocation mechanism. We\nbenchmarked Hierarchical-CPI against state-of-the-art variable importance\nmethods. Its effectiveness is demonstrated in two neuroimaging datasets:\nclassifying dementia diagnoses from MRI data (ADNI dataset) and analyzing the\nBerger effect on EEG data (TDBRAIN dataset), identifying biologically plausible\nvariables.",

    "abstract": "In a series of papers, Garrett, et al, presents a thermodynamic economic\nmodel first laid out in \"Are there basic physical constraints on future\nanthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide?\". This model contains a key\nconceptual issue that obscures a robust system. This system can link to the\nEnergy Based Cobb-Douglas equation.\n  The key conceptual problem is the belief that $\\lambda$, the symbol for\ngrowth in Garrett 2011 would disprove the model if it was not constant.\nHowever, $\\lambda$ cannot be a constant in an economic model, because\n$\\lambda$, with dimension [$\\frac{E}{\\$ \\; GWP}$], represents the aggregate\nefficiency of all of the more than 359 million firms (and by extension,\nhouseholds) making products globally. To clarify it, I define this aggregate\nproduction function distribution as $\\Lambda(t) \\equiv \\sum {\\lambda_i(t) \\cdot\n\\frac{P_i}{GWP}}$, and with light algebra assign a version of the Energy Based\nCobb-Douglas (EBDC) function to $\\lambda$.\n  There are various falsified speculations in the body of work that appear to\nmostly follow from the original issue. The 50 year stable relation of $W$ to\n$E$ is close, but the trend is not flat. The form and degree to which the \"long\narm of history\" speculation may be true remains to be fully considered, but is\nfalsified in the form presented. The speculation in Garrett 2022 that\n$\\frac{dE}{dt}\\rightarrow0$ can cause real GDP to go to zero by inflation is\nfalsified. By generating a dataset going back to -14,000 CE, the speculative\n$W$ curve appears largely confirmed. The $E$ curve is quite far off prior to\n1970 back to 1 CE due to overestimation of pre-industrial energy.\n  By correcting and improving on the foundation issue of Garrett's yeoman\neffort, improving $E$ and some equation presentation formalism, a robust\nthermodynamic model of the global economy emerges that is straightforward and\npractical.",

At low temperatures, the field-induced crossover from the polarized\nferromagnetic state to the SSL results in a large entropy increase and\ndecalescence, indicating its potential for magnetic cooling. However, magnetic\ncooling using a SSL has yet to be reported. Here, we investigate the\nmagnetocaloric effect and cooling performance of single-crystal GdZnPO, a\nspin-7/2 honeycomb-lattice SSL candidate, under a magnetic field $H$ $<$\n$H_\\mathrm{c}$ ($\\mu_0H_\\mathrm{c}$ $\\sim$ 12 T) applied perpendicular to the\nhoneycomb plane and below the crossover temperature ($\\sim$2 K).

This giant magnetocaloric effect is well-explained by the frustrated\nhoneycomb spin model of GdZnPO, suggesting the stability of the SSL below\n$H_\\mathrm{c}$ down to very low temperatures.

To address this challenge,\nwe propose IROTE, a novel in-context method for stable and transferable trait\nelicitation. Drawing on psychological theories suggesting that traits are\nformed through identity-related reflection, our method automatically generates\nand optimizes a textual self-reflection within prompts, which comprises\nself-perceived experience, to stimulate LLMs' trait-driven behavior. The\noptimization is performed by iteratively maximizing an information-theoretic\nobjective that enhances the connections between LLMs' behavior and the target\ntrait, while reducing noisy redundancy in reflection without any fine-tuning,\nleading to evocative and compact trait reflection. Extensive experiments across\nthree human trait systems manifest that one single IROTE-generated\nself-reflection can induce LLMs' stable impersonation of the target trait\nacross diverse downstream tasks beyond simple questionnaire answering,\nconsistently outperforming existing strong baselines.",

We used data from the\narchive of round-the-clock monitoring observations on the third (stationary)\nbeam pattern of the Large Phased Array radio telescope (LPA LPI) at a frequency\nof 111 MHz, which has an unsatisfactory connection of the local quartz time\nstandards to the reference scale (UTC). To compensate for the resulting errors,\nwe applied an algorithm previously developed by us, which uses Pulsar Timescale\nas an intermediate reference scale to compute corrections to the pulses Times\nof Arrival (TOAs) measured by the local clocks and to switch to UTC. Analyzing\na ten-year observational data set we substantially refined the rotational and\nastrometric parameters of 12 pulsars. The spin frequencies $\\nu$ and their\nfirst derivatives $\\dot\\nu$ were determined with accuracies of $10^{-10}$ Hz\nand $10^{-19}$ s$^{-2}$, respectively, which is 5-6 orders of magnitude better\nthan the values quoted in the catalogue. The coordinates are determined with\naccuracies ranging from units to tens of arcseconds.",

We\nalso measure the bar length and strength using Pan-STARRs images and identify a\nnuclear ring in NGC 6951 and a nuclear bar in NGC 7716 from HST/PC images. Our\nresults indicate that NGC 6951 hosts a slow, long, and strong bar, which likely\nevolved through interactions with the dark matter halo and contributed to the\nformation of both the nuclear disk and ring. We also find hints of a rapidly\nrotating oval structure within the primary bar, although it is not clearly seen\nin the imaging data. In contrast, the primary bar in NGC 7716 is too weak to be\nclassified as a barred galaxy, while its nuclear disk and nuclear bar are\nunusually large, possibly due to tidal interactions or the weakness of the\nprimary bar. These findings suggest that slow bars may be more observed in\ngalaxies with nuclear structures and highlight the often underappreciated role\nof galaxy interactions in bar evolution.",

    "abstract": "Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models build upon vision-language\nfoundations, and have achieved promising results and exhibit the possibility of\ntask generalization in robot manipulation. However, due to the heterogeneity of\ntactile sensors and the difficulty of acquiring tactile data, current VLA\nmodels significantly overlook the importance of tactile perception and fail in\ncontact-rich tasks. To address this issue, this paper proposes OmniVTLA, a\nnovel architecture involving tactile sensing. Specifically, our contributions\nare threefold. First, our OmniVTLA features a dual-path tactile encoder\nframework. This framework enhances tactile perception across diverse\nvision-based and force-based tactile sensors by using a pretrained vision\ntransformer (ViT) and a semantically-aligned tactile ViT (SA-ViT). Second, we\nintroduce ObjTac, a comprehensive force-based tactile dataset capturing\ntextual, visual, and tactile information for 56 objects across 10 categories.\nWith 135K tri-modal samples, ObjTac supplements existing visuo-tactile\ndatasets. Third, leveraging this dataset, we train a semantically-aligned\ntactile encoder to learn a unified tactile representation, serving as a better\ninitialization for OmniVTLA. Real-world experiments demonstrate substantial\nimprovements over state-of-the-art VLA baselines, achieving 96.9% success rates\nwith grippers, (21.9% higher over baseline) and 100% success rates with\ndexterous hands (6.2% higher over baseline) in pick-and-place tasks. Besides,\nOmniVTLA significantly reduces task completion time and generates smoother\ntrajectories through tactile sensing compared to existing VLA.

    "abstract": "Precise lens structure segmentation is essential for the design of\nintraocular lenses (IOLs) in cataract surgery. Existing deep segmentation\nnetworks typically weight all pixels equally under cross-entropy (CE) loss,\noverlooking the fact that sub-regions of lens structures are inhomogeneous\n(e.g., some regions perform better than others) and that boundary regions often\nsuffer from poor segmentation calibration at the pixel level. Clinically,\nexperts annotate different sub-regions of lens structures with varying\nconfidence levels, considering factors such as sub-region proportions,\nambiguous boundaries, and lens structure shapes. Motivated by this observation,\nwe propose an Adaptive Confidence-Wise (ACW) loss to group each lens structure\nsub-region into different confidence sub-regions via a confidence threshold\nfrom the unique region aspect, aiming to exploit the potential of expert\nannotation confidence prior. Specifically, ACW clusters each target region into\nlow-confidence and high-confidence groups and then applies a region-weighted\nloss to reweigh each confidence group. Moreover, we design an adaptive\nconfidence threshold optimization algorithm to adjust the confidence threshold\nof ACW dynamically. Additionally, to better quantify the miscalibration errors\nin boundary region segmentation, we propose a new metric, termed Boundary\nExpected Calibration Error (BECE). Extensive experiments on a clinical lens\nstructure AS-OCT dataset and other multi-structure datasets demonstrate that\nour ACW significantly outperforms competitive segmentation loss methods across\ndifferent deep segmentation networks (e.g., MedSAM).

    "abstract": "Criticality is a fundamental notion in graph theory that has been studied\ncontinually since its introduction in the early 50s by Dirac. A graph is called\n$k$-vertex-critical ($k$-edge-critical) if it is $k$-chromatic but removing any\nvertex (edge) lowers the chromatic number to $k-1$. A set of edges in a graph\nis called critical if its removal reduces the chromatic number of the graph.\n  In 1970, Dirac conjectured a rather strong distinction between the notions of\nvertex- and edge-criticality, namely that for every $k\\ge 4$ there exists a\n$k$-vertex-critical graph that does not have any critical edges. This\nconjecture was proved for $k\\ge 5$ by Jensen in 2002 and remains open only for\n$k=4$. A much stronger version of Dirac's conjecture was proposed by Erd\\H{o}s\nin 1985: Let $k\\ge 4$ be fixed, and let $f_k(n)$ denote the largest integer\nsuch that there exists a $k$-vertex-critical graph of order $n$ in which no set\nof at most $f_k(n)$ edges is critical. Is it true that $f_k(n)\\rightarrow\n\\infty$ for $n\\rightarrow \\infty$?\n  Strengthening previous partial results, we solve this problem affirmatively\nfor all $k>4$, proving that $$f_k(n)=\\Omega(n^{1/3}).$$ This leaves only the\ncase $k=4$ open. We also show that a stronger lower bound of order $\\sqrt{n}$\nholds along an infinite sequence of numbers $n$. Finally, we provide a first\nnon-trivial upper bound on the functions $f_k$ by proving that\n$$f_k(n)=O\\left(\\frac{n}{(\\log n)^{\\Omega(1)}}\\right)$$ for every $k\\ge 4$. Our\nproof of the lower bound on $f_k(n)$ involves an intricate analysis of the\nstructure of proper colorings of a modification of an earlier construction due\nto Jensen, combined with a gluing operation that creates new vertex-critical\ngraphs without small critical edge sets from given such graphs. The upper bound\nis obtained using a variant of Szemer\\'{e}di's regularity lemma due to Conlon\nand Fox.",

Hence, there is a pressing need for a systematic investigation of the\nbanding video quality assessment problem for advanced video codecs. Given that\nthe existing publicly available datasets for studying banding artifacts are\nlimited to still picture data only, which cannot account for temporal banding\ndynamics, we have created a first-of-a-kind open video dataset, dubbed\nLIVE-YT-Banding, which consists of 160 videos generated by four different\ncompression parameters using the AV1 video codec.

To demonstrate the\nvalue of this new resources, we tested and compared a variety of models that\ndetect banding occurrences, and measure their impact on perceived quality.\nAmong these, we introduce an effective and efficient new no-reference (NR)\nvideo quality evaluator which we call CBAND.

This corresponds to an\nincrease by more than an order of magnitude in the number of MS stars with\ndetection of solar-like oscillations from TESS. Nearly 40% of our new\ndetections are prime HWO targets, enabling systematic asteroseismic age\ndeterminations relevant for interpreting atmospheric biosignatures. Our\nanalysis confirms that 20-s cadence data yields lower high-frequency noise\nlevels compared to 120-s data. Moreover, the precise stellar parameters\nobtained through asteroseismology establish these bright stars as benchmarks\nfor seismic investigations and provide useful constraints for refining stellar\nevolution models and for complementary analyses in interferometry,\nspectroscopy, and exoplanet characterisation.",

We characterize a knife-edge\nfor a complete no bailout regime, either because the consent cap blocks all\nproposals or because the political cost of funds exceeds the maximum marginal\nbenefit of relief. Comparative statics are transparent: increasing the\npolitical cost shifts activation upward; tightening the consent cap lowers the\nupper plateau; joint institutional changes move the two kinks in predictable\nways.

However, ultrasound deformable registration\nremains highly challenging, especially under large deformation. The inherently\nlow contrast, heavy noise and ambiguous tissue boundaries in ultrasound images\nseverely hinder reliable feature extraction and correspondence matching.\nExisting methods often suffer from poor anatomical alignment and lack physical\ninterpretability. To address the problem, we propose PADReg, a physics-aware\ndeformable registration framework guided by contact force. PADReg leverages\nsynchronized contact force measured by robotic ultrasound systems as a physical\nprior to constrain the registration.

The recent\nsuccess of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LLMs raises the question of how to deploy\nthem efficiently, considering their underlying structure. During the inference\nin MoE LLMs, only a small part of the experts is selected to process a given\ntoken. Moreover, in practice, the experts' load is highly imbalanced. For\nefficient deployment, one has to distribute the model across a large number of\nservers using a model placement algorithm. Thus, to improve cluster\nutilization, the model placement algorithm has to take into account the network\ntopology. This work focuses on the efficient topology-aware placement of the\npre-trained MoE LLMs in the inference stage. We propose an integer linear\nprogram (ILP) that determines the optimal placement of experts, minimizing the\nexpected number of transmissions. Due to the internal structure, this\noptimization problem can be solved with a standard ILP solver.

This raises a\nfundamental question: should highly conflicting objectives be optimized jointly\nor separated into a hierarchical structure? To address this question, this\npaper investigates three multi-objective MSP formulations, which we refer to as\n\\textbf{objective soup recipes}.

An\nanalyzing agent identifies common error patterns resulting from the current\nprompt via topic modeling, and a generation agent revises the prompt to\ndirectly address these key deficiencies. This refinement process is guided by a\ngenetic algorithm framework, which simulates natural selection by evolving\ncandidate prompts through operations such as crossover and mutation to\nprogressively optimize model performance. Extensive numerical experiments\nconducted on public benchmark datasets suggest the superior performance of\nGreenTEA against human-engineered prompts and existing state-of-the-arts for\nautomatic prompt optimization, covering logical and quantitative reasoning,\ncommonsense, and ethical decision-making.",

    "abstract": "A childhood observation of Thakur Anukulchandra that \"one and one can only be\ntwo ones, not simply two\" motivates a precise inquiry: what, exactly, is\nasserted when we pass from two concrete individuals to the numeral \"2\"? This\npaper does not challenge the arithmetic theorem 1+1=2, but rather analyzes what\nthis equation means when applied to physical objects. We answer with two\ncomplementary, rigorous treatments. Mathematician's proof. We model aggregation\nby the free commutative monoid of multisets M(U) over a universe of individuals\nU, so that delta_a + delta_b literally encodes two ones with individuality\npreserved. Numerals arise only after a declared classification q:U->T\n(coarse-graining) via the pushforward q*:M(U)->M(T) and the unique counting\nhomomorphism to N. The non-injectivity of q* isolates the exact locus of\ninformation loss. Physicist's proof. We represent physical systems by\nworldtubes, states, and observables, and define a composite operation that\npreserves labelled constituents. We prove the Non-Identity Addition Theorem:\nA+B = X+X iff A=B=X; hence a pair of distinct objects cannot equal a doubled\ncopy. The numeral \"2\" appears only as the readout of a typed count observable\nafter an explicit classification, not as a statement of physical identity.\nConclusion. In reality, one plus one is two ones; \"1+1=2\" is the value of a\ncounting map applied after coarse graining. This clarifies the separation\nbetween identity-preserving aggregation and counting, reconciles everyday\narithmetic with physical non-identity, and makes explicit the modeling choice\nthat every act of counting entails. Our analysis has implications for the\nphilosophy of mathematics, measurement theory, and information theoretic\napproaches to classification.",

We present high-precision stellar parameters and\nA(Li) for 22 new comoving pairs, primarily located on the hotter side of the\nLi-Dip. Combined with pairs from the C3PO catalog, our sample includes 124\nstars with Teff between 6000 and 7300 K, encompassing and extending slightly\nbeyond the Li-Dip. Among them, 49 comoving pairs (98 stars) have both\ncomponents within the temperature range of interest. Using this expanded set of\ncomoving pairs observed with high-resolution spectroscopy, we show that\nrotational spin-down is the dominant process responsible for Li depletion in\nthe Li-Dip. First, within comoving pairs, the star with v sin i > 12 km/s shows\nhigher A(Li) than its more slowly rotating companion within the Li-Dip,\nindicating that rotation-dependent mixing drives lithium depletion. Second, we\nobserve a correlation between A(Li) and v sin i: fast rotators retain higher\nA(Li) with less scatter, while slow rotators show lower A(Li) and greater\ndispersion. Third, among slow rotators, A(Li) varies widely, suggesting that\ndifferences in initial rotation rates and spin-down histories influence how\nmuch Li is depleted. Some stars may have formed as fast rotators and spun down\nrapidly, leading to more Li depletion, while others may have started as slow\nrotators and retained more of their initial Li.

However, existing methods face\nlimitations in simultaneously satisfying three essential criteria for\ngeneralizable watermarking: 1) invisibility (imperceptible hide of watermarks),\n2) robustness (reliable watermark recovery under diverse conditions), and 3)\nbroad applicability (low latency in watermarking process). To address these\nlimitations, we propose a Hierarchical Watermark Learning (HiWL), a two-stage\noptimization that enable a watermarking model to simultaneously achieve three\ncriteria. In the first stage, distribution alignment learning is designed to\nestablish a common latent space with two constraints: 1) visual consistency\nbetween watermarked and non-watermarked images, and 2) information invariance\nacross watermark latent representations. In this way, multi-modal inputs\nincluding watermark message (binary codes) and cover images (RGB pixels) can be\nwell represented, ensuring the invisibility of watermarks and robustness in\nwatermarking process thereby. The second stage employs generalized watermark\nrepresentation learning to establish a disentanglement policy for separating\nwatermarks from image content in RGB space. In particular, it strongly\npenalizes substantial fluctuations in separated RGB watermarks corresponding to\nidentical messages. Consequently, HiWL effectively learns generalizable\nlatent-space watermark representations while maintaining broad applicability.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed method.

This substantial divergence in\nmethodological designs between the two settings reveals an inherent flaw: the\nlack of an explicit, structured construction of anatomical knowledge that\nnaturally generalizes across domains and settings. To bridge this longstanding\ndivide, we introduce a unified, semantically grounded framework that supports\nboth source-accessible and source-free adaptation. Fundamentally distinct from\nall prior works, our framework's adaptability emerges naturally as a direct\nconsequence of the model architecture, without the need for any handcrafted\nadaptation strategies. Specifically, our model learns a domain-agnostic\nprobabilistic manifold as a global space of anatomical regularities, mirroring\nhow humans establish visual understanding. Thus, the structural content in each\nimage can be interpreted as a canonical anatomy retrieved from the manifold and\na spatial transformation capturing individual-specific geometry. This\ndisentangled, interpretable formulation enables semantically meaningful\nprediction with intrinsic adaptability. Extensive experiments on challenging\ncardiac and abdominal datasets show that our framework achieves\nstate-of-the-art results in both settings, with source-free performance closely\napproaching its source-accessible counterpart, a level of consistency rarely\nobserved in prior works.

Our proposed approach revolves around fine-tuning\nquantized large language models, specifically Orca~2, with low-rank adapters\n(LoRA) and multilingual Transformer-based models, such as XLM-R and mT5.

    "abstract": "Knowledge distillation is a long-established technique for knowledge\ntransfer, and has regained attention in the context of the recent emergence of\nlarge vision-language models (VLMs). However, vision-language knowledge\ndistillation often requires sufficient training data to achieve robust\ngeneralization on amples with ambiguous or boundary-adjacent representations,\nwhich are associated with high predictive uncertainty. Critically, collecting\nsuch large-scale, task-specific data for training is often impractical in\nreal-world scenarios. To address this major challenge arising from the\nentanglement of uncertainty and cross-modal feature representation, we propose\nAligned Manifold Entropy for Robust Vision-Language Distillation (AME), aiming\nto achieve robust generalization under real-world conditions. AME applies\nentropy minimization over a reconfigured shared manifold, where multi-modal\ndata (i.e., image and text) are bridged through a pair of projection functions,\nconducive to structural compression for cross-modal feature representations.\nThis enables robust knowledge distillation under low-data regimes, while\nrequiring no architectural modifications to the backbone. As a result, it can\nserve as a plug-and-play module compatible with a wide range of vision-language\ndistillation frameworks. Notably, our theoretical analysis reveals that\nintegrating knowledge distillation with entropy minimization over the shared\nmanifold leads to a tighter generalization error bound. Extensive experiments\nacross diverse distillation architectures and training settings demonstrate\nthat AME consistently facilitates robust knowledge distillation, resulting in\nsuperior generalization performance across a wide spectrum of downstream tasks.",

Our codebase\noffers two key functionalities: (1) automated generation of unlimited\ntraining/testing cases with configurable difficulty levels, and (2) integrated\nverification modules for objective response evaluation. These features make\nInternBootcamp fundamental infrastructure for RL-based model optimization,\nsynthetic data generation, and model evaluation. Although manually developing\nsuch a framework with enormous task coverage is extremely cumbersome, we\naccelerate the development procedure through an automated agent workflow\nsupplemented by manual validation protocols, which enables the task scope to\nexpand rapidly. % With these bootcamps, we further establish Bootcamp-EVAL, an\nautomatically generated benchmark for comprehensive performance assessment.\nEvaluation reveals that frontier models still underperform in many reasoning\ntasks, while training with InternBootcamp provides an effective way to\nsignificantly improve performance, leading to our 32B model that achieves\nstate-of-the-art results on Bootcamp-EVAL and excels on other established\nbenchmarks. In particular, we validate that consistent performance gains come\nfrom including more training tasks, namely \\textbf{task scaling}, over two\norders of magnitude, offering a promising route towards capable reasoning\ngeneralist.",

    "abstract": "Semantic text classification requires the understanding of the contextual\nsignificance of specific tokens rather than surface-level patterns or keywords\n(as in rule-based or statistical text classification), making large language\nmodels (LLMs) well-suited for this task. However, semantic classification\napplications in industry, like customer intent detection or semantic role\nlabeling, tend to be highly specialized. They require annotation by domain\nexperts in contrast to general-purpose corpora for pretraining. Further, they\ntypically require high inference throughputs which limits the model size from\nlatency and cost perspectives. Thus, for a range of specialized classification\ntasks, the preferred solution is to develop customized classifiers by\nfinetuning smaller language models (e.g., mini-encoders, small language\nmodels).\n  In this work, we develop a token-driven sparse finetuning strategy to adapt\nsmall language models to specialized classification tasks. We identify and\nfinetune a small sensitive subset of model parameters by leveraging\ntask-specific token constructs in the finetuning dataset, while leaving most of\nthe pretrained weights unchanged. Unlike adapter approaches such as low rank\nadaptation (LoRA), we do not introduce additional parameters to the model. Our\napproach identifies highly relevant semantic tokens (case study in the\nAppendix) and outperforms end-to-end finetuning, LoRA, layer selection, and\nprefix tuning on five diverse semantic classification tasks. We achieve greater\nstability and half the training costs vs. end-to-end finetuning.",

This paper proposes Gaussian splatting (GS) RoboMR\n(GSMR), which enables the simulator to opportunistically render a\nphoto-realistic view from the robot's pose by calling ``memory'' from a GS\nmodel, thus reducing the need for excessive image uploads. However, the GS\nmodel may involve discrepancies compared to the actual environments. To this\nend, a GS cross-layer optimization (GSCLO) framework is further proposed, which\njointly optimizes content switching (i.e., deciding whether to upload image or\nnot) and power allocation (i.e., adjusting to content profiles) across\ndifferent frames by minimizing a newly derived GSMR loss function. The GSCLO\nproblem is addressed by an accelerated penalty optimization (APO) algorithm\nthat reduces computational complexity by over $10$x compared to traditional\nbranch-and-bound and search algorithms. Moreover, variants of GSCLO are\npresented to achieve robust, low-power, and multi-robot GSMR. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that the proposed GSMR paradigm and GSCLO method\nachieve significant improvements over existing benchmarks on both wheeled and\nlegged robots in terms of diverse metrics in various scenarios.

    "abstract": "Shrinking CMOS interconnect dimensions to the nanometer scale intensifies\nelectron scattering at surfaces, interfaces, and grain boundaries, causing\nsevere conductivity loss and challenging copper-based designs. Here we present\na momentum-resolved relaxation time framework that integrates density\nfunctional theory with the semiclassical Boltzmann transport equation to\npredict size-dependent resistivity in metallic thin films. Electron phonon\ninteractions are computed from first principles, and anisotropic surface and\ngrain boundary scattering is captured through a momentum dependent mean free\npath, allowing relaxation times to vary spatially and directionally without\nempirical fitting. Applied to isotropic (Cu, Ag, Au) and anisotropic (W,\nTi$_2$GeC) metals, the model achieves excellent agreement with experiments and\nuncovers the critical role of crystallographic anisotropy in transport. We\nfurther identify layered MAX phase compounds as promising ultrathin\ninterconnects. This work provides a predictive, physically rigorous, and\ncomputationally efficient route to designing high-performance conductors for\nnext generation nanoelectronics.",

This evolving complexity poses significant\nchallenges in designing communication networks to satisfy the growing\nquality-of-service and time sensitivity of mobile applications in dynamic\nenvironments. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as fundamental deep\nlearning (DL) models for complex communication networks. GNNs not only augment\nthe extraction of features over network topologies but also enhance scalability\nand facilitate distributed computation. However, most existing GNNs follow a\ntraditional passive learning framework, which may fail to meet the needs of\nincreasingly diverse wireless systems. This survey proposes the employment of\nagentic artificial intelligence (AI) to organize and integrate GNNs, enabling\nscenario- and task-aware implementation towards edge general intelligence. To\ncomprehend the full capability of GNNs, we holistically review recent\napplications of GNNs in wireless communications and networking. Specifically,\nwe focus on the alignment between graph representations and network topologies,\nand between neural architectures and wireless tasks. We first provide an\noverview of GNNs based on prominent neural architectures, followed by the\nconcept of agentic GNNs. Then, we summarize and compare GNN applications for\nconventional systems and emerging technologies, including physical, MAC, and\nnetwork layer designs, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC),\nreconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) and cell-free network architecture.

This decoder first\nembeds structural inter-class relationships across frames into the frame prompt\nfeatures, and then propagates task-specific global video contexts from the\nframe prompt features to the video prompt.

They are expected to exist in half-Heusler correlated topological\nsemimetals. However, the emergence of hole carriers, which alter the chemical\npotential away from the quadratic-band-touching points is not yet understood.\nHere, we investigated the electronic structure of YPtBi and GdPtBi through ab\ninitio many-body perturbation GW theory combined with dynamical mean-field\ntheory and revealed that the correlation effects of 4$d$ or 4$f$ electrons can\nlead to the formation of hole carriers. In YPtBi, the weakly correlated Y-4$d$\nelectrons constitute the topological bands, and the quadratic-band-touching\npoint is at the Fermi level at high temperatures. At low temperatures, enhanced\ncorrelations of Y-4$d$ renormalize the topological bands, leading to the\nformation of hole pocket. In GdPtBi, the strongly correlated Gd-4$f$ electrons\nform the Hubbard-like bands originate from self-energy effects associated with\na topological singularity. These local bands encompass itinerant 4$f$ bands,\nwhich hybridize with topological bands to induce pronounced hole bands. This\nconcerted effect reduces the hole doping, bringing the chemical potential\ncloser to the quadratic-band-touching points as the temperature is lowered. The\ntemperature-induced Lifshitz transition should be responsible for the large\nhole bands observed in both topological semimetals in angle-resolved\nphotoemission spectroscopy measurements at low temperatures.

Recent advances\nin optical metasurfaces enable the design of ultra-thin nanostructured optical\nelements performing such state tomography tasks, promising greater simplicity,\nminiaturization, and scalability. However, reported metasurfaces on this goal\nwere limited to a small Hilbert dimension, e.g., polarization qubits or spatial\nqudits with only a few states. When scaling up to higher-dimensional qudit\ntomography problems, especially those involving spatial qudits, a natural\nquestion arises: whether a metasurface with randomized nanostructures is\nsufficient to perform such qudit tomography, achieving optimal conditions. In\nthis work, we attempt to answer this question through a set of numerical\nexperiments with random metasurfaces, utilizing large-scale simulations of over\n11,000 distinct metasurfaces each exceeding 200 wavelengths in size.

    "abstract": "We present a comprehensive spectro-temporal analysis of GRS $1915+105$\nobserved with AstroSat during June, $2017$. A detailed study of the temporal\nproperties reveals the appearance of an `unknown' variability class ($\\tau$)\nduring $\\rho \\rightarrow \\kappa$ class transition of the source. This new\n`unknown' class ($\\tau$) is characterized by the irregular repetition of low\ncount `dips' along with the adjacent `flare' like features in between two\nsuccessive steady count rate durations, resulting in uniform `$C$' shaped\ndistribution in the color-color diagram. A detailed comparative study of the\nvariability properties between the $\\tau$ class and other known variability\nclasses of GRS $1915+105$ indicates it as a distinct variability class of the\nsource. Further, we find evidence of the presence of possible HFQPO features at\n$\\sim 71$ Hz with quality factor $\\sim 13$, rms amplitude $\\sim 4.69\\%$, and\nsignificance $3\\sigma$, respectively. In addition, a harmonic-like feature at\n$\\sim 152$ Hz is also seen with quality factor $\\sim 21$, rms amplitude $\\sim\n5.75\\%$ and significance $\\sim 4.7\\sigma$. The energy-dependent power spectral\nstudy reveals that the fundamental HFQPO and its harmonic are present in $3-15$\nkeV and $3-6$ keV energy ranges, respectively. Moreover, the wide-band\n($0.7-50$ keV) spectral modelling comprising of thermal Comptonization\ncomponent indicates the presence of a cool ($kT_{\\rm e}\\sim 1.7$ keV) and\noptically thick (optical depth $\\sim 14$) Comptonizing `corona', which seems to\nbe responsible in regulating the HFQPO features in GRS $1915$+$105$. Finally,\nwe find the bolometric luminosity ($L_{\\rm bol}$) to be about $42\\% L_{\\rm\nEdd}$ within $1-100$ keV, indicating the sub-Eddington accretion regime of the\nsource.",

    "abstract": "In digital substations, security events pose significant challenges to the\nsustained operation of power systems. To mitigate these challenges, the\nimplementation of robust defense strategies is critically important. A thorough\nprocess of anomaly identification and detection in information and\ncommunication technology (ICT) frameworks is crucial to ensure secure and\nreliable communication and coordination between interconnected devices within\ndigital substations. Hence, this paper addresses the critical cybersecurity\nchallenges confronting IEC61850-based digital substations within modern smart\ngrids, where the integration of advanced communication protocols, e.g., generic\nobject-oriented substation event (GOOSE), has enhanced energy management and\nintroduced significant vulnerabilities to cyberattacks. Focusing on the\nlimitations of traditional anomaly detection systems (ADSs) in detecting\nthreats, this research proposes a transformative approach by leveraging\ngenerative AI (GenAI) to develop robust ADSs. The primary contributions include\nthe suggested advanced adversarial traffic mutation (AATM) technique to\ngenerate synthesized and balanced datasets for GOOSE messages, ensuring\nprotocol compliance and enabling realistic zero-day attack pattern creation to\naddress data scarcity. Then, the implementation of GenAI-based ADSs\nincorporating the task-oriented dialogue (ToD) processes has been explored for\nimproved detection of attack patterns. Finally, a comparison of the GenAI-based\nADS with machine learning (ML)-based ADSs has been implemented to showcase the\noutperformance of the GenAI-based frameworks considering the AATM-generated\nGOOSE datasets and standard/advanced performance evaluation metrics.",

Although DETR-based methods have\nrecently emerged as the mainstream framework for HOI detection, they still\nsuffer from a key limitation: Randomly initialized queries lack explicit\nsemantics, leading to suboptimal detection performance. To address this\nchallenge, we propose QueryCraft, a novel plug-and-play HOI detection framework\nthat incorporates semantic priors and guided feature learning through\ntransformer-based query initialization. Central to our approach is\n\\textbf{ACTOR} (\\textbf{A}ction-aware \\textbf{C}ross-modal\n\\textbf{T}ransf\\textbf{OR}mer), a cross-modal Transformer encoder that jointly\nattends to visual regions and textual prompts to extract action-relevant\nfeatures. Rather than merely aligning modalities, ACTOR leverages\nlanguage-guided attention to infer interaction semantics and produce\nsemantically meaningful query representations. To further enhance object-level\nquery quality, we introduce a \\textbf{P}erceptual \\textbf{D}istilled\n\\textbf{Q}uery \\textbf{D}ecoder (\\textbf{PDQD}), which distills object category\nawareness from a pre-trained detector to serve as object query initiation. This\ndual-branch query initialization enables the model to generate more\ninterpretable and effective queries for HOI detection. Extensive experiments on\nHICO-Det and V-COCO benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance and strong generalization. Code will be released\nupon publication.",

We propose a hierarchical traffic signal coordination and\ncontrol scheme that integrates model-based optimization with reinforcement\nlearning. The system consists of: (i) a High-Level Coordinator (HLC) that\nselects coordination strategies based on observed and predicted demand; (ii) a\nCorridor Coordinator that derives phase constraints from the selected\nstrategy-either Max-Flow Coordination (MFC) or Green-Wave Coordination (GWC);\nand (iii) Hybrid Signal Agents (HSAs) that determine signal phases via\nreinforcement learning with action masking to enforce feasibility. Hierarchical\nreinforcement learning with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is used to train\nHSA and HLC policies. At the lower level, three HSA policies-MFC-aware,\nGWC-aware, and pure agent control (PAC) are trained in conjunction with their\nrespective coordination strategies. At the higher level, the HLC is trained to\ndynamically switch strategies using a multi-objective reward balancing\ncorridor-level and network-wide performance. The proposed scheme was developed\nand evaluated on a SUMO-RLlib platform. Case results show that hybrid MFC\nmaximizes throughput under heavy demand; hybrid GWC consistently minimizes\narterial stops and maintains progression across diverse traffic conditions but\ncan reduce network-wide efficiency; and PAC improves network-wide travel time\nin moderate demand but is less effective under heavy demand.

Existing methods use fixed Chain-of-Thought\n(CoT) reasoning with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) but suffer from catastrophic\nforgetting, poor adaptability, and limited generalization across domain tasks.\nIn this paper, we propose DocThinker, a rule-based Reinforcement Learning (RL)\nframework for dynamic inference-time reasoning.

Recently, leveraging the\ncontextual understanding capabilities of Speech LLM to achieve contextual\nbiasing by injecting contextual information through prompts have emerged as a\nresearch hotspot.However, the direct information injection method via prompts\nrelies on the internal attention mechanism of the model, making it impossible\nto explicitly control the extent of information injection. To address this\nlimitation, we propose a joint decoding method to control the contextual\ninformation. This approach enables explicit control over the injected\ncontextual information and achieving superior recognition performance.\nAdditionally, Our method can also be used for sensitive word suppression\nrecognition.Furthermore, experimental results show that even Speech LLM not\npre-trained on long contextual data can acquire long contextual capabilities\nthrough our method.",

    "abstract": "As the social implementation of AI has been steadily progressing, research\nand development related to AI security has also been increasing. However,\nexisting studies have been limited to organizing related techniques, attacks,\ndefenses, and risks in terms of specific domains or AI elements. Thus, it\nextremely difficult to understand the relationships among them and how negative\nimpacts on stakeholders are brought about. In this paper, we argue that the\nknowledge, technologies, and social impacts related to AI security should be\nholistically organized to help understand relationships among them. To this\nend, we first develop an AI security map that holistically organizes\ninterrelationships among elements related to AI security as well as negative\nimpacts on information systems and stakeholders. This map consists of the two\naspects, namely the information system aspect (ISA) and the external influence\naspect (EIA). The elements that AI should fulfill within information systems\nare classified under the ISA. The EIA includes elements that affect\nstakeholders as a result of AI being attacked or misused. For each element,\ncorresponding negative impacts are identified. By referring to the AI security\nmap, one can understand the potential negative impacts, along with their causes\nand countermeasures. Additionally, our map helps clarify how the negative\nimpacts on AI-based systems relate to those on stakeholders. We show some\nfindings newly obtained by referring to our map.

To address these limitations, we propose a\nunified co-training framework that efficiently integrates multiple safety\nbehaviors: positive (lawful/prosocial), negative (unfiltered/risk-prone) and\nrejective (refusal-oriented/conservative) within a single SFT stage. Notably,\neach behavior is dynamically activated via a simple system-level instruction,\nor magic token, enabling stealthy and efficient behavioral switching at\ninference time. This flexibility supports diverse deployment scenarios, such as\npositive for safe user interaction, negative for internal red-teaming, and\nrejective for context-aware refusals triggered by upstream moderation signals.\nThis co-training strategy induces a distinct Safety Alignment Margin in the\noutput space, characterized by well-separated response distributions\ncorresponding to each safety mode. The existence of this margin provides\nempirical evidence for the model's safety robustness and enables unprecedented\nfine-grained control. Experiments show that our method matches the safety\nalignment quality of SFT+DPO, with our 8B model notably surpassing DeepSeek-R1\n(671B) in safety performance, while significantly reducing both training\ncomplexity and deployment costs.

Over the past\ntwo decades, efforts to extend the gKYP lemma from LTI systems to linear\nparameter varying (LPV) systems have been hindered by the intricate\ntime-frequency inter-modulation effect between the input signal and the\ntime-varying scheduling parameter. A key element in this framework is the\nfrequency-dependent Integral Quadratic Constraint (IQC) function, which enables\ntime-domain interpretation of the gKYP lemma, as demonstrated by Iwasaki et al\nin their companion 2005 System and Control Letter paper. The non-negativity\nproperty of this IQC function plays a crucial role in characterizing system\nbehavior under frequency-limited inputs. In this paper, we first demonstrate\nthrough a counterexample that the IQC non-negativity property may fail for LPV\nsystems, thereby invalidating existing results that rely on this assumption. To\naddress this issue, we propose a reformulation strategy that replaces the\noriginal frequency range with an enlarged one, thereby restoring the\nnon-negativity property for LPV systems. Moreover, we establish that the\nminimal required expansion depends on the interaction(or gap) between the\nsystem poles and the original frequency range, as well as a set of\ncontrollability Gramians. Building upon this results, an extension of gKYP\nlemma is presented, which allows us to conduct finite-frequency analysis of LPV\nsystems in a direct and reliable manner. The potential and efficiency compared\nto existing results are demonstrated through numerical examples.",

Note that our approach is valid\nfor arbitrary mass $m_{3}$ so that in theory we can gain an arbitrarily large\namount of 3D periodic orbits of the three-body problem. In the case of three\nequal masses, we discovered twenty-one 3D ``choerographical'' periodic orbits\nwhose three bodies move periodically in a single closed orbit. It is very\ninteresting that, in the case of two equal masses, we discovered 273\nthree-dimensional periodic orbits with the two bodies ($m_{1}=m_{2}=1$) moving\nalong a single closed orbit and the third ($m_{3}\\neq 1$) along a different\none: we name them ``piano-trio'' orbits, like a trio for two violins and one\npiano. To the best of our knowledge, all of these 3D periodic orbits have never\nbeen reported, indicating the novelty of this work. The large amount of these\nnew 3D periodic orbits are helpful for us to have better understandings about\nchaotic properties of the famous three-body problem, which ``are, so to say,\nthe only opening through which we can try to penetrate in a place which, up to\nnow, was supposed to be inaccessible'', as pointed out by Poincar\\'e, the\nfounder of chaos theory.",

    "abstract": "Although diffusion prior is rising as a powerful solution for blind face\nrestoration (BFR), the inherent gap between the vanilla diffusion model and BFR\nsettings hinders its seamless adaptation. The gap mainly stems from the\ndiscrepancy between 1) high-quality (HQ) and low-quality (LQ) images and 2)\nsynthesized and real-world images. The vanilla diffusion model is trained on\nimages with no or less degradations, whereas BFR handles moderately to severely\ndegraded images. Additionally, LQ images used for training are synthesized by a\nnaive degradation model with limited degradation patterns, which fails to\nsimulate complex and unknown degradations in real-world scenarios. In this\nwork, we use a unified network FLIPNET that switches between two modes to\nresolve specific gaps. In Restoration mode, the model gradually integrates\nBFR-oriented features and face embeddings from LQ images to achieve authentic\nand faithful face restoration. In Degradation mode, the model synthesizes\nreal-world like degraded images based on the knowledge learned from real-world\ndegradation datasets. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets show that our\nmodel 1) outperforms previous diffusion prior based BFR methods in terms of\nauthenticity and fidelity, and 2) outperforms the naive degradation model in\nmodeling the real-world degradations.",

    "abstract": "Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks (UWSNs) represent a promising technology\nthat enables diverse underwater applications through acoustic communication.\nHowever, it encounters significant challenges including harsh communication\nenvironments, limited energy supply, and restricted signal transmission. This\npaper aims to provide efficient and reliable communication in underwater\nnetworks with limited energy and communication resources by optimizing the\nscheduling of communication links and adjusting transmission parameters (e.g.,\ntransmit power and transmission rate). The efficient and reliable communication\nmulti-objective optimization problem (ERCMOP) is formulated as a decentralized\npartially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP). A Traffic Load-Aware\nResource Management (TARM) strategy based on deep multi-agent reinforcement\nlearning (MARL) is presented to address this problem. Specifically, a traffic\nload-aware mechanism that leverages the overhear information from neighboring\nnodes is designed to mitigate the disparity between partial observations and\nglobal states. Moreover, by incorporating a solution space optimization\nalgorithm, the number of candidate solutions for the deep MARL-based\ndecision-making model can be effectively reduced, thereby optimizing the\ncomputational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate the adaptability of\nTARM in various scenarios with different transmission demands and collision\nprobabilities, while also validating the effectiveness of the proposed approach\nin supporting efficient and reliable communication in underwater networks with\nlimited resources.",

Based on a sample of luminous\nand very soft X-ray sources that are argued to be supercritical accretion\nsystems viewed close to edge-on, we identified the optical counterparts for\nsome of them and compared the optical properties with those of ultraluminous\nX-ray sources (ULXs), which are supposed to be supercritical accretion systems\nviewed close to face-on. The optical luminosity is found in a wide range, with\nthe absolute visual magnitude ranging from dimmer than -1.2 in some sources to\nabout -7 in one case. Most sources show a power-law like spectrum while four of\nthem display a blackbody shape. One of them shows an optical spectrum\nresembling a B type main sequence, suggesting that it may be a Be white dwarf\nsystem. Strong variability in flux at timescales as short as 10 days are\nrevealed, indicating that some of these sources are powered by accretion onto\ncompact objects.

In recent years, researchers have made\nsignificant progress by developing advanced deep learning models for\nspatiotemporal prediction. However, most existing models are deterministic,\ni.e., predicting only the expected mean values without quantifying uncertainty,\nleading to potentially unreliable and inaccurate outcomes. While recent studies\nhave introduced probabilistic models to quantify uncertainty, they typically\nfocus on a single phenomenon (e.g., taxi, bike, crime, or traffic crashes),\nthereby neglecting the inherent correlations among heterogeneous urban\nphenomena. To address the research gap, we propose a novel Graph Neural Network\nwith Uncertainty Quantification, termed UQGNN for multivariate spatiotemporal\nprediction. UQGNN introduces two key innovations: (i) an Interaction-aware\nSpatiotemporal Embedding Module that integrates a multivariate diffusion graph\nconvolutional network and an interaction-aware temporal convolutional network\nto effectively capture complex spatial and temporal interaction patterns, and\n(ii) a multivariate probabilistic prediction module designed to estimate both\nexpected mean values and associated uncertainties. Extensive experiments on\nfour real-world multivariate spatiotemporal datasets from Shenzhen, New York\nCity, and Chicago demonstrate that UQGNN consistently outperforms\nstate-of-the-art baselines in both prediction accuracy and uncertainty\nquantification.

    "abstract": "Achieving accurate traffic prediction is a fundamental but crucial task in\nthe development of current intelligent transportation systems.Most of the\nmainstream methods that have made breakthroughs in traffic prediction rely on\nspatio-temporal graph neural networks, spatio-temporal attention mechanisms,\netc. The main challenges of the existing deep learning approaches are that they\neither depend on a complete traffic network structure or require intricate\nmodel designs to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies. These\nlimitations pose significant challenges for the efficient deployment and\noperation of deep learning models on large-scale datasets. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a cost-effective graph-free Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)\nbased model M3-Net for traffic prediction. Our proposed model not only employs\ntime series and spatio-temporal embeddings for efficient feature processing but\nalso first introduces a novel MLP-Mixer architecture with a mixture of experts\n(MoE) mechanism. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real datasets\ndemonstrate the superiority of the proposed model in terms of prediction\nperformance and lightweight deployment.",

    "abstract": "Point cloud capture processes are error-prone and introduce noisy artifacts\nthat necessitate filtering/denoising. Recent filtering methods often suffer\nfrom point clustering or noise retaining issues. In this paper, we propose\nHybrid Point Cloud Filtering ($\\textbf{HybridPF}$) that considers both\nshort-range and long-range filtering trajectories when removing noise. It is\nwell established that short range scores, given by $\\nabla_{x}\\log p(x_t)$, may\nprovide the necessary displacements to move noisy points to the underlying\nclean surface. By contrast, long range velocity flows approximate constant\ndisplacements directed from a high noise variant patch $x_0$ towards the\ncorresponding clean surface $x_1$. Here, noisy patches $x_t$ are viewed as\nintermediate states between the high noise variant and the clean patches. Our\nintuition is that long range information from velocity flow models can guide\nthe short range scores to align more closely with the clean points. In turn,\nscore models generally provide a quicker convergence to the clean surface.\nSpecifically, we devise two parallel modules, the ShortModule and LongModule,\neach consisting of an Encoder-Decoder pair to respectively account for\nshort-range scores and long-range flows. We find that short-range scores,\nguided by long-range features, yield filtered point clouds with good point\ndistributions and convergence near the clean surface. We design a joint loss\nfunction to simultaneously train the ShortModule and LongModule, in an\nend-to-end manner. Finally, we identify a key weakness in current displacement\nbased methods, limitations on the decoder architecture, and propose a dynamic\ngraph convolutional decoder to improve the inference process. Comprehensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our HybridPF achieves state-of-the-art results\nwhile enabling faster inference speed.",

In this paper, we investigate the\ndifferences between these regimes by contrasting 2D particle-in-cell\nsimulations of reconnection in pair plasmas with relativistic magnetization\n($\\sigma \\gg 1$) and subrelativistic magnetization ($\\sigma < 1$). By utilizing\nunprecedentedly large domain sizes and outflow boundary conditions, we\ndemonstrate that lowering the magnetization results in a change in the\nreconnection geometry from a plasmoid chain to a Petschek geometry, where\nlaminar exhausts bounded by slow-mode shocks emanate from a single diffusion\nregion. We attribute this change to the reduced plasmoid production rate in the\nlow-$\\sigma$ case: when the secondary tearing rate is sufficiently low,\nplasmoids are too few in number to prevent the system from relaxing into a\nstable Petschek configuration. This geometric change also affects particle\nenergization: we show that while high-$\\sigma$ plasmoid chains generate\npower-law energy spectra, low-$\\sigma$ Petschek exhausts merely heat incoming\nplasma and yield negligible nonthermal acceleration.

To the best of our knowledge, this study\nmakes the first attempt to present a thorough characterization and analysis of\nApple Silicon for on-device inference.",
