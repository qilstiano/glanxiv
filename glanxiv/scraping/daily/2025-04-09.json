    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated capabilities in code\ngeneration, potentially boosting developer productivity. However, their\nwidespread adoption remains limited by high computational costs, significant\nenergy demands, and security risks such as data leakage and adversarial\nattacks. As a lighter-weight alternative, Small Language Models (SLMs) offer\nfaster inference, lower deployment overhead, and better adaptability to\ndomain-specific tasks, making them an attractive option for real-world\napplications. While prior research has benchmarked LLMs on competitive\nprogramming tasks, such evaluations often focus narrowly on metrics like Elo\nscores or pass rates, overlooking deeper insights into model behavior, failure\npatterns, and problem diversity. Furthermore, the potential of SLMs to tackle\ncomplex tasks such as competitive programming remains underexplored. In this\nstudy, we benchmark five open SLMs - LLAMA 3.2 3B, GEMMA 2 9B, GEMMA 3 12B,\nDEEPSEEK-R1 14B, and PHI-4 14B - across 280 Codeforces problems spanning Elo\nratings from 800 to 2100 and covering 36 distinct topics. All models were\ntasked with generating Python solutions. PHI-4 14B achieved the best\nperformance among SLMs, with a pass@3 of 63.6%, approaching the proprietary\nO3-MINI-HIGH (86.8%). In addition, we evaluated PHI-4 14B on C++ and found that\ncombining outputs from both Python and C++ increases its aggregated pass@3 to\n73.6%. A qualitative analysis of PHI-4 14B's incorrect outputs revealed that\nsome failures were due to minor implementation issues - such as handling edge\ncases or correcting variable initialization - rather than deeper reasoning\nflaws.",

Our study incorporates a general $(n,m)$ Lennard-Jones two-body\npotential and a long-range repulsive Axilrod-Teller-Muto (ATM) three-body\npotential. The two-body lattice sums and their meromorphic continuations are\nevaluated to full precision using super-exponentially convergent series\nexpansions. Furthermore, we introduce a novel approach to computing three-body\nlattice sums by converting the multi-dimensional sum into an integral involving\nproducts of Epstein zeta functions. This enables us to evaluate three-body\nlattice sums and their meromorphic continuations to machine precision within\nminutes on a standard laptop. Using our computational framework, we analyze the\nstability of cuboidal lattice phases relative to the close-packed fcc structure\nalong a Bain transformation path for varying ATM coupling strengths. We\nanalytically demonstrate that the ATM cohesive energy exhibits an extremum at\nthe bcc phase and show numerically that it corresponds to a minimum for\nrepulsive three-body forces along the Bain path. Our results indicate that\nstrong repulsive three-body interactions can destabilize the fcc phase and\nrender bcc energetically favorable for soft LJ potentials. However, even in\nthis scenario, the bcc phase remains susceptible to further cuboidal\ndistortions. These results suggest that the stability of the bcc phase is,\nbesides vibrational, temperature, and pressure effects, strongly influenced by\nhigher than two-body forces. Because of the wrong short-range behavior of the\ntriple-dipole ATM model the LJ potential is limited to exponents $n>9$ for the\nrepulsive wall, otherwise one observes distortion into a set of linear chains\ncollapsing to the origin.",

Although\nObjaverse represents the largest available 3D asset collection, its utility is\nlimited by the predominance of low-quality models. To address this limitation,\nwe manually annotate 10,000 3D objects with detailed attributes, including\naesthetic quality scores, texture color classifications, multi-object\ncomposition flags, transparency characteristics, etc. Then, we trained a neural\nnetwork capable of annotating the tags for the rest of the Objaverse dataset.\nThrough experiments and a user study on generation results, we demonstrate that\nmodels pre-trained on our quality-focused subset achieve better performance\nthan those trained on the larger dataset of Objaverse in image-to-3D generation\ntasks. In addition, by comparing multiple subsets of training data filtered by\nour tags, our results show that the higher the data quality, the faster the\ntraining loss converges. These findings suggest that careful curation and rich\nannotation can compensate for the raw dataset size, potentially offering a more\nefficient path to develop 3D generative models.

Eventually, the demon's memory needs to be erased. The erasure costs\nthe same work as extracted previously, hence there is no violation of the\nsecond law. Though widely accepted, the fictitious memory invoked in the thesis\nhas drawn multiple criticisms, with debates persisting over the demon's\nnecessity.

During this recovery phase,\nwe detect two emission lines at 0.7 and 1 keV, along with three absorption\nlines whose energies decreased to 1.57, 2.64, and 3.64 keV. Given the nature of\nthe helium white-dwarf companion, these absorption lines during the aftermath\nmay originate from an accretion flow, but only if the accretion environment is\nsignificantly contaminated by nuclear ashes from the superburst. This provides\nevidence of temporary metal enhancement in the accreted material due to strong\nwind loss. Moreover, we suggest that the absorption features observed during\nthe short X-ray bursts and in the superburst aftermath share a common origin in\nheavy nuclear ashes enriched with elements like Si, Ar, Ca, or Ti, either from\nthe burst wind or from an accretion flow contaminated by the burst wind.",

All bursts showed clear signs of photospheric radius\nexpansion, where the neutron star (NS) photosphere expanded more than 50 km\nabove the surface. One of the bursts produced a super-expansion with a\nblackbody emission radius of 902 km for the first time with NICER. We searched\nfor burst oscillations in all 15 bursts and found evidence of a coherent\noscillation at 716 Hz in a burst, with a 2.9$\\sigma$ detection level based on\nMonte Carlo simulations. If confirmed with future observations, 4U 1820-30\nwould become the fastest-spinning NS known in X-ray binary systems. The\nfractional rms amplitude of the candidate burst oscillation was found to be\n5.8% in the energy range of 3-10 keV. Following the variable persistent model\nfrom burst time-resolved spectroscopy, an anti-correlation is seen between the\nmaximum scaling factor value and the (pre-burst) persistent flux. We detected a\nlow value of ionization at the peak of each burst based on reflection modeling\nof burst spectra. A partially interacting inner accretion disk or a weakly\nionized outer disk may cause the observed ionization dip during the\nphotospheric radius expansion phase.",

By utilizing [OI] 63 $\\mu$m line\nobservations from Herschel/PACS and constructing a detailed dust SED using\nHerschel and Spitzer archival imaging data, we show that the [CII] line\nemission is well explained by a photodissociation region (PDR) model, in which\nthe emission arises from the surfaces of molecular clouds exposed to far-UV\nradiation fields $\\sim 5\\cdot10^3$ times the local interstellar radiation field\n(G$_0$).

By\nmatching derived PDR parameters to the observed far-IR line and continuum\nintensities we derive cloud size-scales and find that typical cloud radii in\nJ1000 are $\\sim$3.5 pc perhaps indicating an ISM that is highly fractured due\nto intense star formation activity.

In this article, we address large-scale multi-class\nclassification problems with general error rate guarantees to enhance\nalgorithmic trustworthiness. To this end, we first introduce a notion of\ngroup-wise classification, which unifies the common class-wise and overall\nclassifications as special cases. We then develop a unified algorithmic\nframework for the general group-wise classification that consists of three\nsteps: Pre-classification, Selective $p$-value construction, and large-scale\nPost-classification decisions (PSP). Theoretically, PSP is distribution-free\nand provides valid finite-sample guarantees for controlling general group-wise\nfalse decision rates at target levels. To show the power of PSP, we demonstrate\nthat the step of post-classification decisions never degrades the power of\npre-classification, provided that pre-classification has been sufficiently\npowerful to meet the target error levels. Additionally, we further establish\ngeneral power optimality theories for PSP from both non-asymptotic and\nasymptotic perspectives.

Traditional W2SG methods rely on passive\nlearning, where a weak teacher provides noisy demonstrations to train a strong\nstudent. This hinders students from employing their knowledge during training\nand reaching their full potential. In this work, we introduce Alice\n(pro{A}ctive {l}earning w{i}th tea{c}her's D{e}monstrations), a framework that\nleverages complementary knowledge between teacher and student to enhance the\nlearning process. We probe the knowledge base of the teacher model by eliciting\ntheir uncertainty, and then use these insights together with teachers'\nresponses as demonstrations to guide student models in self-generating improved\nresponses for supervision. In addition, for situations with significant\ncapability gaps between teacher and student models, we introduce cascade Alice,\nwhich employs a hierarchical training approach where weak teachers initially\nsupervise intermediate models, who then guide stronger models in sequence.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the\nW2SG performance, yielding substantial improvements in three key tasks compared\nto the original W2SG: knowledge-based reasoning (+4.0%), mathematical reasoning\n(+22.62%), and logical reasoning (+12.11%).

We identify their host galaxies, examine their radio properties as\nwell as their environment, and classify their morphologies as FR I (4), FR II\n(8), intermediate FR I/II (2), and hybrid (1). The combined ~40 deg^2 ASKAP\nimage of the Sculptor field, which is centred near the starburst galaxy NGC\n253, has a resolution of 13\" and an rms sensitivity of >10 microJy/beam. The\nlargest GRGs in our sample are ASKAP J0057-2428 (zphot = 0.238), ASKAP\nJ0059-2352 (zphot = 0.735) and ASKAP J0107-2347 (zphot = 0.312), for which we\nestimate linear projected sizes of 2.7, 3.5 and 3.8 Mpc, respectively. In total\nwe catalog 232 extended radio galaxies of which 77 (33%) are larger than 0.7\nMpc and 35 (15%) are larger than 1 Mpc. The radio galaxy densities are 5.8\ndeg^-2 (total) and 0.9 (1.9) deg^-2 for those larger than 1 (0.7) Mpc, similar\nto previous results. Furthermore, we present the ASKAP discovery of a head-tail\nradio galaxy, a double-lobe radio galaxy with a spiral host, and radio emission\nfrom several galaxy clusters. As the ASKAP observations were originally\nconducted to search for a radio counterpart to the gravitational wave detection\nGW190814 (z ~ 0.05), we highlight possible host galaxies in our sample.",

In this study, we\ndeveloped a completely automated system to detect regions of interest (ROIs) in\nwhole slide images (WSI) of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), to reduce time analysis\nand assist pathologists in making more accurate decisions. The proposed\napproach is based on an efficient texture descriptor named dominant rotated\nlocal binary pattern (DRLBP) and color transformation to reveal and exploit the\nimmense texture variability at the microscopic high magnifications level.\nThereby, the DRLBPs retain the structural information and utilize the magnitude\nvalues in a local neighborhood for more discriminative power. For the\nclassification of the relevant ROIs, feature extraction of WSIs patches was\nperformed on the color channels separately to form the histograms. Next, we\nused the most frequently occurring patterns as a feature selection step to\ndiscard non-informative features. The performances of different classifiers on\na set of 1800 kidney cancer patches originating from 12 whole slide images were\ncompared and evaluated. Furthermore, the small size of the image dataset allows\nto investigate deep learning approach based on transfer learning for image\npatches classification by using deep features and fine-tuning methods. High\nrecognition accuracy was obtained and the classifiers are efficient, the best\nprecision result was 99.17% achieved with SVM. Moreover, transfer learning\nmodels perform well with comparable performance, and the highest precision\nusing ResNet-50 reached 98.50%.

    "abstract": "A growing trend in financial technology (fintech) is the use of mobile phone\ndata and machine learning (ML) to provide credit scores- and subsequently,\nopportunities to access loans- to groups left out of traditional banking. This\npaper draws on interview data with leaders, investors, and data scientists at\nfintech companies developing ML-based alternative lending apps in low- and\nmiddle-income countries to explore financial inclusion and gender implications.\nMore specifically, it examines how the underlying logics, design choices, and\nmanagement decisions of ML-based alternative lending tools by fintechs embed or\nchallenge gender biases, and consequently influence gender equity in access to\nfinance. Findings reveal developers follow 'gender blind' approaches, grounded\nin beliefs that ML is objective and data reflects the truth. This leads to a\nlack of grappling with the ways data, features for creditworthiness, and access\nto apps are gendered. Overall, tools increase access to finance, but not gender\nequitably: Interviewees report less women access loans and receive lower\namounts than men, despite being better repayers. Fintechs identify demand- and\nsupply-side reasons for gender differences, but frame them as outside their\nresponsibility. However, that women are observed as better repayers reveals a\nmarket inefficiency and potential discriminatory effect, further linked to\nprofit optimization objectives. This research introduces the concept of encoded\ngender norms, whereby without explicit attention to the gendered nature of data\nand algorithmic design, AI tools reproduce existing inequalities. In doing so,\nthey reinforce gender norms as self-fulfilling prophecies. The idea that AI is\ninherently objective and, when left alone, 'fair', is seductive and misleading.\nIn reality, algorithms reflect the perspectives, priorities, and values of the\npeople and institutions that design them.",

Specifically, our approach first\nemploys a Transformer-based feature extractor to compute multi-scale patch\nembeddings, capturing both global structural information and local texture\ndetails. The extracted feature embeddings are then fed into an MoE gating\nnetwork, which assigns adaptive weights to multiple diffusion-based denoisers,\neach specializing in different brain MRI characteristics, such as centrum\nsemiovale, sulcal and gyral cortex, and grey-white matter junction. The final\noutput is produced by aggregating the denoised results from these specialized\nexperts according to dynamically assigned gating probabilities. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that MoEDiff-SR outperforms existing state-of-the-art\nmethods in terms of quantitative image quality metrics, perceptual fidelity,\nand computational efficiency. Difference maps from each expert further\nhighlight their distinct specializations, confirming the effective\nregion-specific denoising capability and the interpretability of expert\ncontributions. Additionally, clinical evaluation validates its superior\ndiagnostic capability in identifying subtle pathological features, emphasizing\nits practical relevance in clinical neuroimaging.

    "abstract": "The modal dispersion of waveguides often limits integrated photonic devices\nto operation with a single polarization state. This presents a challenge for\nsensing and spectroscopy applications, which often require polarization\ndiversity over wide bandwidths with high throughput. Here, we show that an\nunmodified thermally-driven silicon photonic Fourier transform spectrometer\nexhibits a polarization-separating effect in the frequency domain, even though\nonly one polarization-insensitive detector is used. Using this effect, we\nexperimentally demonstrate a simple on-chip spectrometer capable of extracting\ntwo-polarization spectra over a wide 1480-1630 nm bandwidth with a greater than\n20 dB polarization extinction ratio. These specifications would be highly\nchallenging to achieve using existing, conventional on-chip\npolarization-splitting techniques. We additionally demonstrate several\nimprovements in calibration and testing that improve the performance of on-chip\nFourier transform spectrometers even in the single-polarization case. The\n\"interferometric modal splitting\" principle which this spectrometer exemplifies\nis general to various on-chip spectrometer architectures, other spatial modes,\nand technologies other than thermally-driven Fourier transform spectrometers.\nInterferometric mode splitting shows promise as a general approach for robust\nand fundamentally broadband detection of orthogonal modes in guided-wave\nsensing.",

    "abstract": "At high red-shifts, the distribution of angular separations between galaxies\nin clusters is in tension with the standard cosmological model. The JWST data\nat even higher red-shifts have exacerbated this tension. However, Zwick Tired\nLight (TL) model fits well with these high red shift data, bringing the TL\nmodel back into the spotlight. In the TL model, red-shift is attributed to the\nenergy loss of photons during propagation. However, some argue that this\nhypothesis cannot explain the shape and primordial nature of the cosmic\nmicrowave background (CMB). Assuming that the CMB source is the microwave\nradiation from galaxies, we show that the TL model can produce a CMB spectrum\nconsistent with the COBE FIRAS data. The TL model predicts a finite optical\npath per Hubble radius, which defines an opaque region, a sphere with radius of\n240 Mpc (red shift 0.051) centred on the Milky Way, within this region, the\ngalaxy's microwave radiation superposition behaves like a black body.\nAdditionally, the TL scenario (microwave radiation superposition) allows us to\ndetermine the angular size of the CMB temperature fluctuations, in agreement\nwith the observed CMB power spectrum, and provides insight into the\nSunyaev-Zeldovich effect.",

Following the definition of boundary and initial\nconditions, the discrete approximation and relevant measures to increase its\nnumerical robustness are described. In the second part, the different methods\nare applied to hydrodynamic and aerodynamic flow applications from maritime\nengineering, each relying on Shear Stress Transport (SST) strategies for\nturbulence modeling that require the distance to the nearest wall at different\nprocedural points. The hydrodynamic behavior of a model scale bulk carrier\ncruising at ReL=7.246E+6 and Fn = 0.142 is investigated on the influence of the\nwall distance formulation for predicting resistance and propulsion behavior in\nconjunction with statistical turbulence modeling method. It is shown that the\ndifferent wall distance modeling barely influences relevant integral\nhydrodynamic quantities such as drag, trim, and sinkage, and related errors are\nin the range of O(0.1%) and, therefore, significantly below typical modeling,\ndiscretization, and approximation errors. Subsequently, the wall distance\nmethods were investigated for the aerodynamic analysis of a full-scale feeder\nship at ReL = 5E+08. A hybrid averaged/filtered approach, in line with the\nImproved Delayed Detached Eddy Simulation (IDDES) model, is utilized, and the\nresults indicate an improved sensitivity to the choice of the wall distance\nmodel.",

    "abstract": "Interactive visualization of embedding projections is a useful technique for\nunderstanding data and evaluating machine learning models. Labeling data within\nthese visualizations is critical for interpretation, as labels provide an\noverview of the projection and guide user navigation. However, most methods for\nproducing labels require clustering the points, which can be computationally\nexpensive as the number of points grows. In this paper, we describe an\nefficient clustering approach using kernel density estimation in the projected\n2D space instead of points. This algorithm can produce high-quality cluster\nregions from a 2D density map in a few hundred milliseconds, orders of\nmagnitude faster than current approaches.

Our approach is well interpretable and has\nstrong task-specific optimization capabilities. By modeling dynamic instruction\nselection as a sequential decision-making process, we use RL to train our\nselection strategy.

However, the\nhysteretic onset of this instability, observed for sufficiently low-viscosity\ndrops, has so far eluded theoretical understanding -- including simulations\nthat have struggled in this regime owing to charge-density-steepening effects\ndriven by surface convection. Here, we conduct a numerical study of the\nleaky-dielectric model in a simplified two-dimensional setting involving a\ncircular drop, considering arbitrary viscosity ratios and field strengths. As\nthe viscosity of the drop is decreased relative to the suspending fluid, the\npitchfork bifurcation marking the onset of drop rotation is found to transition\nfrom supercritical to subcritical, giving rise to a field-strength interval of\nbistability. In this subcritical regime, the critical field is always large\nenough that, at the bifurcation, the symmetric base-state solution exhibits\nequatorial charge-density blowup singularities of the type recently described\nby Peng et al. (Phys. Rev. Fluids, 9 083701, 2024).

However, as tasks grow more complex, NNs often require large\nnumbers of trainable parameters, which increases computational and energy\ndemands. Variational quantum circuits (VQCs) offer a promising alternative:\nthey leverage quantum mechanics to capture intricate relationships and\ntypically need fewer parameters. In this work, we evaluate NNs and VQCs on\nsimple supervised and reinforcement learning tasks, examining models with\ndifferent parameter sizes. We simulate VQCs and execute selected parts of the\ntraining process on real quantum hardware to approximate actual training times.\nOur results show that VQCs can match NNs in performance while using\nsignificantly fewer parameters, despite longer training durations. As quantum\ntechnology and algorithms advance, and VQC architectures improve, we posit that\nVQCs could become advantageous for certain machine learning tasks.",

The denominator\n$B(x)$ is just the product of the linear equations defining the facets of $C$.\nWe will see that the numerator $A(x)$ is given by the adjoint polynomial of the\ndual cone $C^{\\vee}$. The adjoint was originally defined by Warren, who used it\nto construct barycentric coordinates in general polytopes. Confirming the\nintuition that the job of the numerator is to cancel unwanted poles outside the\npolytope, we will see that the adjoint is the unique polynomial of minimal\ndegree whose hypersurface contains the residual arrangement of non-face\nintersections of supporting hyperplanes of $C$.",

The analysis was motivated by reports of\nelevated cancer diagnoses within the Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM)\ncommunity, specifically targeting NHL cases due to initial media focus and data\ncollection through the Torchlight Initiative. The methodology integrates\nsimulation-based estimation of expected diagnoses using incomplete data and\nexpert knowledge on the underlying population. Statistical tests, including the\nStandardized Incidence Ratio (SIR) and a nonparametric Sign Test, were used to\nevaluate both the rate of diagnosis and age at diagnosis. The results\ndemonstrate a statistically significant increase in NHL diagnoses among\nmissileers in the later decades, with observed rates surpassing expected\nbenchmarks. The study also finds that the median age of diagnosis is\nsignificantly younger for the study population compared to national averages.\nKey methodological contributions include estimating the population size and\nservice start ages when comprehensive cohort data is unavailable, incorporating\nuncertainty quantification, and applying multiple hypothesis testing to\nidentify temporal patterns. While the study acknowledges limitations such as\nsmall sample size and estimation uncertainty, as well as recognizing the study\nsubjects as self-reported diagnoses, the findings highlight the effectiveness\nof these statistical techniques in identifying significant deviations from\nexpected rates.

In particular, the\nspace-time method is conforming and is of Galerkin-type, i.e., trial and test\nspaces are equal. We consider a tensor-product approach with respect to time\nand space, using piecewise polynomial, continuous trial and test functions. In\nthis case, we state the global linear system and efficient direct space-time\nsolvers based on exploiting the Kronecker structure of the global system\nmatrix. This leads to the Bartels-Stewart method and the fast diagonalization\nmethod. Both methods result in solving a sequence of spatial subproblems. In\nparticular, the fast diagonalization method allows for solving the spatial\nsubproblems in parallel, i.e., a time parallelization is possible. Numerical\nexamples for a two-dimensional spatial domain illustrate convergence in\nspace-time norms and show the potential of the proposed solvers.",

We conducted two online studies ($N=600$ total\nparticipants); each replicated two robots with different embodiments, Furhat\nand Pepper. In our first study, grounded in expectation theory, participants\nwere divided into two groups, one primed with positive and the other with\nnegative expectations regarding the robot's performance, establishing distinct\nexpectation frameworks. This validation study aimed to verify whether the\nvideos could reliably establish low and high-expectation profiles. In the\nsecond study, participants were primed using the validated videos and then\nviewed a new scenario in which the robot failed at a task. Half viewed a\nversion where the robot explained its failure, while the other half received no\nexplanation. We found that explanations significantly improved user perceptions\nof Furhat, especially when participants were primed to have lower expectations.\nExplanations boosted satisfaction and enhanced the robot's perceived\nexpressiveness, indicating that effectively communicating the cause of errors\ncan help repair user trust. By contrast, Pepper's explanations produced minimal\nimpact on user attitudes, suggesting that a robot's embodiment and style of\ninteraction could determine whether explanations can successfully offset\nnegative impressions. Together, these findings underscore the need to consider\nusers' expectations when tailoring explanation strategies in HRI.

Pre-main sequence (PMS) stars have a larger scatter\nin $\\log(L_{\\rm X}/L_*)$ than main-sequence stars, are observed to have\nsaturated levels of X-ray emission, and do not follow the rotation-activity\nrelation. We investigate how PMS stars evolve in the rotation-activity plane\nand the timescale over which the X-ray rotation-activity relation emerges.\nUsing observational data of $\\sim$600 stars from four PMS clusters, stellar\ninternal structure models, a rotational evolution model, and observed X-ray\nluminosity trends with age, we simulate the evolution of the PMS stars in the\nrotation-activity plane up to ages of 100 Myr. Our model reproduces the\nrotation-activity relation found for main-sequence stars, with higher-mass\nstars beginning to form the unsaturated regime from around 10 Myr. After\n$\\sim$25 Myr, the gradient of the unsaturated regime matches that found for\nmain-sequence stars.

Absolute pose regression offers a solution to this task by\ntraining a neural network, directly regressing the camera pose from image\nfeatures. While an attractive solution in terms of memory and compute\nefficiency, absolute pose regression's predictions are inaccurate and\nunreliable outside the training domain. In this work, we propose a novel method\nfor quantifying the epistemic uncertainty of an absolute pose regression model\nby estimating the likelihood of observations within a variational framework.\nBeyond providing a measure of confidence in predictions, our approach offers a\nunified model that also handles observation ambiguities, probabilistically\nlocalizing the camera in the presence of repetitive structures.

However, these agents often exploit spurious correlations in\nthe training data, resulting in brittle behaviours that fail to generalize to\nnew or slightly modified environments. To address this, we introduce the Causal\nObject-centric Model Extraction Tool (COMET), a novel algorithm designed to\nlearn the exact interpretable causal world models (CWMs). COMET first extracts\nobject-centric state descriptions from observations and identifies the\nenvironment's internal states related to the depicted objects' properties.\nUsing symbolic regression, it models object-centric transitions and derives\ncausal relationships governing object dynamics. COMET further incorporates\nlarge language models (LLMs) for semantic inference, annotating causal\nvariables to enhance interpretability.\n  By leveraging these capabilities, COMET constructs CWMs that align with the\ntrue causal structure of the environment, enabling agents to focus on\ntask-relevant features. The extracted CWMs mitigate the danger of shortcuts,\npermitting the development of RL systems capable of better planning and\ndecision-making across dynamic scenarios. Our results, validated in Atari\nenvironments such as Pong and Freeway, demonstrate the accuracy and robustness\nof COMET, highlighting its potential to bridge the gap between object-centric\nreasoning and causal inference in reinforcement learning.",

While many existing CL methods\nincrementally store additional learned structures, such as Low-Rank Adaptation\n(LoRA) adapters or prompts and sometimes even preserve features from previous\nsamples to maintain performance.

A\nthree-compartment VERDICT model for renal tumours was fitted to the dMRI data\nusing a self-supervised deep neural network, and ROIs were drawn by an\nexperienced uroradiologist. An economical acquisition protocol for future\nstudies with larger patient cohorts was optimised using a recursive feature\nselection approach. The VERDICT model described the diffusion data in renal\ntumours more accurately than IVIM or ADC. Combined with self-supervised deep\nlearning, VERDICT identified significant differences in the intracellular\nvolume fraction between cancerous and normal tissue, and in the vascular volume\nfraction between vascular and non-vascular. The feature selector yields a 4\nb-value acquisition of b = [70,150,1000,2000], with a duration of 14 minutes.",

    "abstract": "This study presents a multi-stage approach to mental health classification by\nleveraging traditional machine learning algorithms, deep learning\narchitectures, and transformer-based models. A novel data set was curated and\nutilized to evaluate the performance of various methods, starting with\nconventional classifiers and advancing through neural networks. To broaden the\narchitectural scope, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) such as LSTM and GRU were\nalso evaluated to explore their effectiveness in modeling sequential patterns\nin the data. Subsequently, transformer models such as BERT were fine-tuned to\nassess the impact of contextual embeddings in this domain. Beyond these\nbaseline evaluations, the core contribution of this study lies in a novel\ntraining strategy involving a dual-model architecture composed of a teacher and\na student network. Unlike standard distillation techniques, this method does\nnot rely on soft label transfer; instead, it facilitates information flow\nthrough both the teacher model's output and its latent representations by\nmodifying the loss function. The experimental results highlight the\neffectiveness of each modeling stage and demonstrate that the proposed loss\nfunction and teacher-student interaction significantly enhance the model's\nlearning capacity in mental health prediction tasks.",

The\naim of this work is to predict which stars are most likely to host an\nEarth-like planet (ELP) to avoid blind searches, minimises detection times, and\nthus maximises the number of detections. Using a previous study on correlations\nbetween the presence of an ELP and the properties of its system, we trained a\nRandom Forest to recognise and classify systems as 'hosting an ELP' or 'not\nhosting an ELP'. The Random Forest was trained and tested on populations of\nsynthetic planetary systems derived from the Bern model, and then applied to\nreal observed systems. The tests conducted on the machine learning (ML) model\nyield precision scores of up to 0.99, indicating that 99% of the systems\nidentified by the model as having ELPs possess at least one. Among the few real\nobserved systems that have been tested, 44 have been selected as having a high\nprobability of hosting an ELP, and a quick study of the stability of these\nsystems confirms that the presence of an Earth-like planet within them would\nleave them stable. The excellent results obtained from the tests conducted on\nthe ML model demonstrate its ability to recognise the typical architectures of\nsystems with or without ELPs within populations derived from the Bern model. If\nwe assume that the Bern model adequately describes the architecture of real\nsystems, then such a tool can prove indispensable in the search for Earth-like\nplanets. A similar approach could be applied to other planetary system\nformation models to validate those predictions.",

    "abstract": "Relocalization, the process of re-establishing a robot's position within an\nenvironment, is crucial for ensuring accurate navigation and task execution\nwhen external positioning information, such as GPS, is unavailable or has been\nlost. Subterranean environments present significant challenges for\nrelocalization due to limited external positioning information, poor lighting\nthat affects camera localization, irregular and often non-distinct surfaces,\nand dust, which can introduce noise and occlusion in sensor data. In this work,\nwe propose a robust, computationally friendly framework for relocalization\nthrough point cloud registration utilizing a prior point cloud map. The\nframework employs Intrinsic Shape Signatures (ISS) to select feature points in\nboth the target and prior point clouds. The Fast Point Feature Histogram (FPFH)\nalgorithm is utilized to create descriptors for these feature points, and\nmatching these descriptors yields correspondences between the point clouds. A\n3D transformation is estimated using the matched points, which initializes a\nNormal Distribution Transform (NDT) registration. The transformation result\nfrom NDT is further refined using the Iterative Closest Point (ICP)\nregistration algorithm. This framework enhances registration accuracy even in\nchallenging conditions, such as dust interference and significant initial\ntransformations between the target and source, making it suitable for\nautonomous robots operating in underground mines and tunnels.

    "abstract": "Stabilizer R\\'enyi entropies (SREs) probe the non-stabilizerness (or magic)\nof many-body systems and quantum computers. Here, we introduce the mutual\nvon-Neumann SRE and magic capacity, which can be efficiently computed in time\n$O(N\\chi^3)$ for matrix product states (MPSs) of bond dimension $\\chi$. We find\nthat mutual SRE characterizes the critical point of ground states of the\ntransverse-field Ising model, independently of the chosen local basis. Then, we\nrelate the magic capacity to the anti-flatness of the Pauli spectrum, which\nquantifies the complexity of computing SREs. The magic capacity characterizes\ntransitions in the ground state of the Heisenberg and Ising model, randomness\nof Clifford+T circuits, and distinguishes typical and atypical states. Finally,\nwe make progress on numerical techniques: we design two improved Monte-Carlo\nalgorithms to compute the mutual $2$-SRE, overcoming limitations of previous\napproaches based on local update. We also give improved statevector simulation\nmethods for Bell sampling and SREs with $O(8^{N/2})$ time and $O(2^N)$ memory,\nwhich we demonstrate for $24$ qubits. Our work uncovers improved approaches to\nstudy the complexity of quantum many-body systems.",

    "abstract": "Humans have the ability to utilize visual cues, such as lip movements and\nvisual scenes, to enhance auditory perception, particularly in noisy\nenvironments. However, current Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) or\nAudio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) models often struggle in noisy\nscenarios. To solve this task, we propose a model that improves transcription\nby correlating noise sources to visual cues. Unlike works that rely on lip\nmotion and require the speaker's visibility, we exploit broader visual\ninformation from the environment. This allows our model to naturally filter\nspeech from noise and improve transcription, much like humans do in noisy\nscenarios. Our method re-purposes pretrained speech and visual encoders,\nlinking them with multi-headed attention. This approach enables the\ntranscription of speech and the prediction of noise labels in video inputs. We\nintroduce a scalable pipeline to develop audio-visual datasets, where visual\ncues correlate to noise in the audio. We show significant improvements over\nexisting audio-only models in noisy scenarios. Results also highlight that\nvisual cues play a vital role in improved transcription accuracy.",

Magnetic webs are naturally expected\nin parts of radiative zones that were formerly convective, retaining memory of\nextinguished dynamos. For instance, red giants with moderate masses $M\\gtrsim\n1.3M_\\odot$ likely contain a magnetic web deposited on the main sequence during\nthe retreat of the central convective zone. The web couples the helium core to\nthe hydrogen envelope of the evolving red giant and thus reduces spin-up of the\ncontracting core. The magnetic field and the resulting slower rotation of the\ncore are both consistent with asteroseismic observations, as we illustrate with\na stellar evolution model with mass $1.6M_\\odot$. Evolved massive stars host\nmore complicated patterns of convective zones that may leave behind many webs,\ntransporting angular momentum towards the surface. Efficient web formation\nlikely results in most massive stars dying with magnetized and slowly rotating\ncores.",

This challenges the conventional notion of the event horizon as a causal\nboundary common to all degrees of freedom. However, certain solutions in these\ntheories exhibit \\emph{universal horizons} -- surfaces capable of trapping\nsignals of arbitrarily high speed, thereby restoring the notion of black hole.\nPrevious studies have extensively characterised universal horizons in settings\nwhere Lorentz violation is encoded via a hypersurface-orthogonal \\ae{}ther. In\nthis work, we explore the possibility of extending this concept to more general\ncases where hypersurface orthogonality is relaxed. To do so, we construct a\ncandidate trapping surface and analyse its causal properties using a general\nmodel for Lorentz-violating matter. We find that, in addition to the standard\nconditions associated to universal horizons, a local vanishing of the\n\\ae{}ther's twist is also necessary. We then provide an explicit example of\nsuch a universal horizon by suitably deforming the \\ae{}ther flow in a stealth\nKerr solution recently found in Einstein--\\ae{}ther theory. Moreover, we\nanalyse the behaviour of trajectories which are not analytical at the universal\nhorizon and discuss the implications of our findings for Hawking radiation.\nWhile our analysis is motivated by Einstein-\\ae{t}her gravity, our results\napply to broader classes of Lorentz-violating theories, further supporting the\nrelevance of black hole phenomenology in these frameworks.",

In this work, we show that a model that\nincorporates both initiation and elongation steps is essential for describing\ntrends in IVT kinetics in conditions relevant to RNA manufacturing. In contrast\nto previous reports, we find that the IVT reaction can be either initiation- or\nelongation-limited depending on solution conditions.

Polymerase-polymerase\ninteractions during elongation are incorporated into our modeling framework and\nfound to have nonzero but unidentifiable effects on macroscopic transcription\nrates.

Informally, a variable is\nsaid to be implied integer if its integrality is enforced implicitly by\nintegrality of other variables and the constraints of a problem. In this work\nwe formalize the definition of implied integrality by taking a polyhedral\nperspective. Our main result characterizes implied integrality as occurring\nwhen a subset of integer variables is fixed to integer values and the\npolyhedron on the remaining variables is integral. While integral polyhedra are\nwell-understood theoretically, existing detection methods infer implied\nintegrality only for one variable at a time. We introduce new detection methods\nbased on the detection of integral polyhedra, extending existing techniques to\nmultiple variables. Additionally, we discuss the computational complexity of\nrecognizing implied integers. We conduct experiments using a new detection\nmethod that uses totally unimodular submatrices to identify implied\nintegrality. For the MIPLIB 2017 collection dataset our results indicate that,\non average, 18.8% of the variables are classified as implied integer after\npresolving, compared to just 3.3% identified by state-of-the-art techniques.\nMoreover, we are able to reduce the average percentage of variables whose\nintegrality needs to be enforced after presolving from 70.2% to 59.0%.",

Despite the various formalizations of FAs in proof assistants\nsuch as Coq and Isabelle/HOL, these formalizations often fall short in terms of\napplicability to real-world scenarios. A more pragmatic approach involves the\nformalization of symbolic FAs and FTs, where transition labels are symbolic and\npotentially infinite. While the formalization of symbolic FAs has been explored\nin the work of CertiStr, the formalization of symbolic FTs in interactive proof\nassistants remains largely unexplored due to the increased complexity\nchallenges.

Face-LLaVA achieves superior\nresults compared to existing open-source MLLMs and competitive performance\ncompared to commercial solutions. Our model output also receives a higher\nreasoning rating by GPT under a zero-shot setting across all the tasks.

To expedite model exploration, we introduce an\nefficient and accurate variational Bayesian approach that learns the population\nposterior with a normalizing flow and serves as a drop-in replacement for\nexisting samplers. With hardware acceleration, inference takes just seconds for\nthe current set of black-hole mergers and readily scales to larger catalogs.\nThe trained posteriors provide an arbitrary number of independent samples with\nexact probability densities, unlike established stochastic sampling algorithms,\nwhile requiring up to three orders of magnitude fewer likelihood evaluations\nand as few as $\\mathcal{O}(10^3)$. Provided the posterior support is covered,\ndiscrepancies can be addressed with smoothed importance sampling, which\nquantifies a goodness-of-fit metric for the variational approximation while\nalso estimating the evidence for Bayesian model selection. Neural variational\ninference thus enables interactive development, analysis, and comparison of\npopulation models, making it a useful tool for astrophysical interpretation of\ncurrent and future gravitational-wave observations.",

At higher\nredshifts, the slopes are $-0.13 \\pm 0.15$ and $0.37 \\pm 0.36$ for $8 < z < 9$\nand $9 < z < 10$, respectively. At fixed galaxy mass, the size evolution for\nstar-forming galaxies follows $R_e \\propto (1+z)^{-\\beta}$, with $\\beta = 1.21\n\\pm 0.05$. For quiescent galaxies, the slope is steeper $\\alpha\\sim 0.5$-$0.8$\nat $2 < z < 5$, and $\\beta=0.81\\pm0.26$. We find that the size-mass relation is\nconsistent between UV and optical at $z < 8$ for star-forming galaxies.\nHowever, we observe a decrease in the slope from UV to optical at $z > 8$, with\na tentative negative slope in the optical at $8 < z < 9$, suggesting a complex\ninterplay between intrinsic galaxy properties and observational effects such as\ndust attenuation.

The key discovery of this work is the following. The Stoner\ninstability possesses an RG fixed point that preserves the U(2) symmetry. For\n$\\alpha<1$, this fixed point is attractive, indicating a continuous transition.\nConversely, for $\\alpha>1$, the fixed point becomes repulsive, and without\nfine-tuning, there is runaway RG flow, resulting in a discontinuous transition.\nThe U(1) $\\times$ U(1) symmetric system, with $\\mu^+\\neq \\mu^-$, exhibits\nricher physics.

If confirmed, these observations could revolutionize our understanding of\ncosmic-ray production and propagation and/or serve as compelling indirect\nevidence for dark matter. Given that the detection of cosmic $\\overline{\\rm D}$\nis already at the limit of AMS-02 sensitivity, explaining the observation of\n${}^3\\overline{\\rm He}$ even within the standard coalescence framework poses a\nsignificant challenge. It has recently been shown that a previously overlooked\nmechanism within the Standard Model of particle physics-namely, the production\nof antihelion via the displaced-vertex decay of $\\bar{\\Lambda}_b^0$\nbaryons-could substantially enhance the ${}^3\\overline{\\rm He}$ flux arising\nfrom dark matter-induced processes.

We explore an analytical toy\nmodel that links the rapid change in absorption lines to the evolution of the\nionization parameter and the photosphere radius, and suggest that $\\sim\n10^{-3}M_\\odot$ ejected per eruption with expansion velocities up to $v_{\\rm\nmax}\\sim 0.15c$, can reproduce the absorption features.

Brute-force calculation of the optimal set of included channels is\nexponentially infeasible as the number of channels grows, and approximate\nmethods are required. In this work, we present a data-driven framework for\nattempting to find near-optimal sets of included detector channels. The\nframework leverages non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to learn the\nbehavior of gamma spectra across the detector, and clusters\nsimilarly-performing detector channels together. Performance comparisons are\nthen made between spectra with channel clusters removed, which is more feasible\nthan brute force. The framework is general and can be applied to arbitrary,\nuser-defined performance metrics depending on the application. We apply this\nframework to optimizing gamma spectra measured by H3D M400 CdZnTe\nspectrometers, which exhibit variable performance across their crystal volumes.\nIn particular, we show several examples optimizing various performance metrics\nfor uranium and plutonium gamma spectra in nondestructive assay for nuclear\nsafeguards, and explore trends in performance vs.\\ parameters such as\nclustering algorithm type. We also compare the NMF+clustering pipeline to\nseveral non-machine-learning algorithms, including several greedy algorithms.\nOverall, we find that the NMF+clustering pipeline tends to find the\nbest-performing set of detector voxels, significantly improving over the\nun-optimized spectra, but that a greedy accumulation of spectra segmented by\ndetector depth can in some cases give similar performance improvements in much\nless computation time.",

Most research has focused on developing unsupervised mechanisms\nthat separate objects into discrete slots in the representation space,\nevaluated using unsupervised object discovery.

Despite their potential,\nassistance games have only been explored in simple settings. Scaling them to\nmore complex environments is difficult because it requires both solving\nintractable decision-making problems under uncertainty and accurately modeling\nhuman users' behavior. We present the first scalable approach to solving\nassistance games and apply it to a new, challenging Minecraft-based assistance\ngame with over $10^{400}$ possible goals. Our approach, AssistanceZero, extends\nAlphaZero with a neural network that predicts human actions and rewards,\nenabling it to plan under uncertainty. We show that AssistanceZero outperforms\nmodel-free RL algorithms and imitation learning in the Minecraft-based\nassistance game. In a human study, our AssistanceZero-trained assistant\nsignificantly reduces the number of actions participants take to complete\nbuilding tasks in Minecraft.

    "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as an effective paradigm for\ngenerating contextually accurate answers by integrating Large Language Models\n(LLMs) with retrieval mechanisms. However, in legal contexts, users frequently\nreference norms by their labels or nicknames (e.g., Article 5 of the\nConstitution or Consumer Defense Code (CDC)), rather than by their content,\nposing challenges for traditional RAG approaches that rely solely on semantic\nembeddings of text. Furthermore, legal texts themselves heavily rely on\nexplicit cross-references (e.g., \"pursuant to Article 34\") that function as\npointers. Both scenarios pose challenges for traditional RAG approaches that\nrely solely on semantic embeddings of text, often failing to retrieve the\nnecessary referenced content. This paper introduces Poly-Vector Retrieval, a\nmethod assigning multiple distinct embeddings to each legal provision: one\nembedding captures the content (the full text), another captures the label (the\nidentifier or proper name), and optionally additional embeddings capture\nalternative denominations. Inspired by Frege's distinction between Sense and\nReference, this poly-vector retrieval approach treats labels, identifiers and\nreference markers as rigid designators and content embeddings as carriers of\nsemantic substance. Experiments on the Brazilian Federal Constitution\ndemonstrate that Poly-Vector Retrieval significantly improves retrieval\naccuracy for label-centric queries and potential to resolve internal and\nexternal cross-references, without compromising performance on purely semantic\nqueries. The study discusses philosophical and practical implications of\nexplicitly separating reference from content in vector embeddings and proposes\nfuture research directions for applying this approach to broader legal datasets\nand other domains characterized by explicit reference identifiers.",

Going beyond final accuracy,\nwe propose a deductive consistency metric to analyze chain-of-thought output\nfrom language models (LMs).Formally, deductive reasoning involves two subtasks:\nunderstanding a set of input premises and inferring the conclusions that follow\nfrom them. The proposed metric studies LMs' performance on these subtasks, with\nthe goal of explaining LMs' reasoning errors on novel problems: how well do LMs\nunderstand input premises with increasing context lengths, and how well can\nthey infer conclusions over multiple reasoning hops? Since existing benchmarks\nmay be memorized, we develop a pipeline to evaluate LMs' deductive consistency\non novel, perturbed versions of benchmark problems. On novel grade school math\nproblems (GSM-8k), we find that LMs are fairly robust to increasing number of\ninput premises, but suffer significant accuracy decay as the number of\nreasoning hops is increased. Interestingly, these errors are masked in the\noriginal benchmark as all models achieve near 100% accuracy. As we increase the\nnumber of solution steps using a synthetic dataset, prediction over multiple\nhops still remains the major source of error compared to understanding input\npremises. Other factors, such as shifts in language style or natural\npropagation of early errors do not explain the trends. Our analysis provides a\nnew view to characterize LM reasoning -- as computations over a window of input\npremises and reasoning hops -- that can provide unified evaluation across\nproblem domains.",

In\nparticular, recent improvements in generative AI have made it difficult for\npeople to distinguish between human-generated and AI-generated art. In this\nresearch, we consider the potential utility of various types of Machine\nLearning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models in distinguishing AI-generated\nartwork from human-generated artwork. We focus on three challenging artistic\nstyles, namely, baroque, cubism, and expressionism. The learning models we test\nare Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multilayer\nPerceptron (MLP), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Our best experimental\nresults yield a multiclass accuracy of 0.8208 over six classes, and an\nimpressive accuracy of 0.9758 for the binary classification problem of\ndistinguishing AI-generated from human-generated art.",

    "abstract": "Despite significant efforts, the realization of the hybrid quantum-classical\nalgorithms has predominantly been confined to proof-of-principles, mainly due\nto the hardware noise. With fault-tolerant implementation being a long-term\ngoal, going beyond small molecules with existing error mitigation (EM)\ntechniques with current noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) devices has\nbeen a challenge. That being said, statistical learning methods are promising\napproaches to learning the noise and its subsequent mitigation. We devise a\ngraph neural network and regression-based machine learning (ML) architecture\nfor practical realization of EM techniques for molecular Hamiltonian without\nthe requirement of the exponential overhead. Given the short coherence time of\nthe quantum hardware, the ML model is trained with either ideal or mitigated\nexpectation values over a judiciously chosen ensemble of shallow sub-circuits\nadhering to the native hardware architecture. The hardware connectivity network\nis mapped to a directed graph which encodes the information of the native gate\nnoise profile to generate the features for the neural network. The training\ndata is generated on-the-fly during ansatz construction thus removing the\ncomputational overhead. We demonstrate orders of magnitude improvements in\npredicted energy over a few strongly correlated molecules.",

In this\nwork, we investigate the connection between Lyman Continuum (LyC) escape and\nthe conditions of the Circumgalactic Medium (CGM), as probed by Ly$\\alpha$\nhalos (LAHs) in emission. We use Ly$\\alpha$ and UV continuum imaging data from\nthe Lyman alpha and Continuum Origins Survey (LaCOS), targeting 42 nearby ($z\n\\simeq 0.3$), star-forming galaxies with LyC observations (escape fractions of\n$f_{\\rm esc}^{\\rm LyC} \\simeq 0.01-0.49$). LaCOS galaxies show extended\nLy$\\alpha$ emission ubiquitously, with LyC emitters (LCEs) having more compact\nLy$\\alpha$ morphologies than non-LCEs, and Ly$\\alpha$ spatial offsets that do\nnot exceed the extent of the UV continuum. We model the diffuse LAHs using a\ncombined S\\'ersic plus exponential 2D profile, and find that the characteristic\nscale length of the Ly$\\alpha$ halo is ten times larger than the UV, on\naverage. We unveil a significant anti-correlation between $f_{\\rm esc}^{\\rm\nLyC}$ and the Ly$\\alpha$ Halo Fraction (HF, or contribution of the halo to the\ntotal Ly$\\alpha$ luminosity), that we propose as a new LyC indicator. Our\nobservations show that halo scale lengths and HFs both scale positively with\nthe optical depth of the neutral gas in the ISM, revealing a picture in which\nLy$\\alpha$ and LyC photons in LCEs either emerge directly from the central\nstarbursts or escape isotropically and, in the case of Ly$\\alpha$, minimize the\nnumber of scattering interactions in a less-extended CGM. The properties of\nLAHs in LaCOS resemble those of LAHs at $z \\geq 3$, suggesting a lack of\nevolution in the $f_{\\rm esc}^{\\rm LyC}$ predictors that rely on the spatial\nproperties of Ly$\\alpha$, and ensuring the applicability of these indicators to\nobservations of high-redshift galaxies.",

    "abstract": "The winds of massive stars remove a significant fraction of their mass,\nstrongly impacting their evolution. As a star evolves, the rate at which it\nloses mass changes. In stellar evolution codes, different mass-loss recipes are\nemployed for different evolutionary stages. The choice of the recipes is\nuser-dependent and the conditions for switching between them are poorly\ndefined. Focusing on hot stars, we aim to produce a physically motivated,\nempirically calibrated mass-loss recipe suitable for a wide range of\nmetallicities. We want to provide a ready-to-use universal recipe that\neliminates the need for switching between recipes for hot stars during stellar\nevolution calculations. We compile a sample of hot stars with reliable stellar\nand wind parameters in the Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds. The sample is used\nto determine the dependence of the mass-loss rate on the basic stellar\nparameters. We find that independent of evolutionary stage and temperature, the\nwind mass-loss rate is a function of the electron-scattering Eddington\nparameter ($\\Gamma_e$) and metallicity (Z), being in line with expectations of\nradiation-driven wind theory. Our derived scaling relation provides an adequate\n($\\Delta$log($\\dot{M}$/(M$_\\odot$/yr)) = 0.43) and broadly applicable mass-loss\nrecipe for hot stars. The newly derived mass-loss recipe covers nearly the\nentire parameter space of hot stars with UV radiation-driven winds and\neliminates the need for interpolation between mass-loss formulae at different\nevolutionary stages when applied in stellar evolution models. Examples of\nstellar evolution calculations using our new recipe reveal that the predictions\non the ionizing fluxes and final fates of massive stars, especially at low\nmetallicity, differ significantly from models that use the standard mass-loss\nrates, impacting our understanding of stellar populations at low metallicity\nand in the young Universe.",

Based on our optical spectroscopy, we can constrain the mass\nand effective temperature of the white dwarf to be ~1.1 Msol and 16 100 K,\nrespectively. The overall intrinsic flux level of the source is unusually high,\nsuggesting that there remains significant residual emission from the accretion\ndisc and/or the white dwarf even ten years after the 2014 outburst.

The core challenge of this task is how to construct\na generalized feature space for novel categories with limited data on the basis\nof the base category space, which could adapt the learned detection model to\nunknown scenarios. However, limited by insufficient samples for novel\ncategories, two issues still exist: (1) the features of the novel category are\neasily implicitly represented by the features of the base category, leading to\ninseparable classifier boundaries, (2) novel categories with fewer data are not\nenough to fully represent the distribution, where the model fine-tuning is\nprone to overfitting. To address these issues, we introduce the side\ninformation to alleviate the negative influences derived from the feature space\nand sample viewpoints and formulate a novel generalized feature representation\nlearning method for FSOD. Specifically, we first utilize embedding side\ninformation to construct a knowledge matrix to quantify the semantic\nrelationship between the base and novel categories. Then, to strengthen the\ndiscrimination between semantically similar categories, we further develop\ncontextual semantic supervised contrastive learning which embeds side\ninformation. Furthermore, to prevent overfitting problems caused by sparse\nsamples, a side-information guided region-aware masked module is introduced to\naugment the diversity of samples, which finds and abandons biased information\nthat discriminates between similar categories via counterfactual explanation,\nand refines the discriminative representation space further. Extensive\nexperiments using ResNet and ViT backbones on PASCAL VOC, MS COCO, LVIS V1,\nFSOD-1K, and FSVOD-500 benchmarks demonstrate that our model outperforms the\nprevious state-of-the-art methods, significantly improving the ability of FSOD\nin most shots/splits.",

This forcing is subject to large uncertainties as cloud\nadjustments have not only complex dependence on background conditions, but also\ntemporal fluctuations, especially those driven by diel variations in solar\nheating. However, direct observations of such diel changes are still limited.\nHere, we present observational evidence of substantial diel changes in the\ncloud adjustments to aerosols within ship tracks, linear lines of polluted\nclouds captured in satellite images. We developed a novel method to\nautomatically determine the age of each ship-track segment and analyze cloud\nadjustments to aerosols. We show that more aged polluted clouds with extended\nnighttime exposure exhibit higher increases in cloud fraction. By contrast,\nliquid water path adjustments follow a non-monotonic pattern: they generally\ndecrease with time before reversing trend in clouds formed at nighttime. Most\nof these diel contrasts are statistically significant and likely stem from\ndifferences in solar heating and cloud precipitation. The increase in cloud\nfraction adjustment suggests a larger aerosol effective radiative forcing, -0.1\nto -0.4 W per meter squared, than the estimate without considering temporal\nvariations, while the temporal changes in liquid water path adjustments may\npartially offset it.

This (meta-)concept is connected to\nintermediate concepts by a possibilistic rule-based system. The probability of\neach intermediate concept for the input instance is inferred using a neural\nnetwork. The connection between the low-level perception task and the\nhigh-level reasoning task lies in the transformation of neural network outputs\nmodeled by probability distributions (through softmax activation) into\npossibility distributions. The use of intermediate concepts is valuable for the\nexplanation purpose: using the rule-based system, the classification of an\ninput instance as an element of the (meta-)concept can be justified by the fact\nthat intermediate concepts have been recognized.\n  From the technical side, our contribution consists of the design of efficient\nmethods for defining the matrix relation and the equation system associated\nwith a possibilistic rule-based system.

Joint speech-text modeling\nis a promising direction to achieve this. However, the effectiveness of recent\nspeech tokens for joint modeling remains underexplored. To address this, we\nintroduce Text-Aligned Speech Tokenization and Embedding (TASTE), a method that\ndirectly addresses the modality gap by aligning speech token with the\ncorresponding text transcription during the tokenization stage. We propose a\nmethod that can achieve this through a attention-based aggregation mechanism\nand with speech reconstruction as the training objective. We conduct extensive\nexperiments and show that TASTE can preserve essential paralinguistic\ninformation while dramatically reducing the token sequence length. With TASTE,\nwe perform straightforward joint spoken language modeling by using Low-Rank\nAdaptation on the pre-trained text LLM. Experimental results show that\nTASTE-based SLMs perform comparable to previous work on SALMON and StoryCloze;\nwhile significantly outperform other pre-trained SLMs on speech continuation\nacross subjective and objective evaluations. To our knowledge, TASTE is the\nfirst end-to-end approach that utilizes a reconstruction objective to\nautomatically learn a text-aligned speech tokenization and embedding suitable\nfor spoken language modeling.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in large language models have significantly improved\ntheir reasoning abilities, particularly through techniques involving search and\nbacktracking. Backtracking naturally scales test-time compute by enabling\nsequential, linearized exploration via long chain-of-thought (CoT) generation.\nHowever, this is not the only strategy for scaling test-time compute: parallel\nsampling with best-of-n selection provides an alternative that generates\ndiverse solutions simultaneously. Despite the growing adoption of sequential\nsearch, its advantages over parallel sampling--especially under a fixed compute\nbudget remain poorly understood. In this paper, we systematically compare these\ntwo approaches on two challenging reasoning tasks: CountDown and Sudoku.\nSurprisingly, we find that sequential search underperforms parallel sampling on\nCountDown but outperforms it on Sudoku, suggesting that backtracking is not\nuniversally beneficial. We identify two factors that can cause backtracking to\ndegrade performance: (1) training on fixed search traces can lock models into\nsuboptimal strategies, and (2) explicit CoT supervision can discourage\n\"implicit\" (non-verbalized) reasoning. Extending our analysis to reinforcement\nlearning (RL), we show that models with backtracking capabilities benefit\nsignificantly from RL fine-tuning, while models without backtracking see\nlimited, mixed gains. Together, these findings challenge the assumption that\nbacktracking universally enhances LLM reasoning, instead revealing a complex\ninteraction between task structure, training data, model scale, and learning\nparadigm.",

In particular, laser-based OWC networks can provide terabits per\nsecond (Tbps) aggregate data rates. However, the emerging OWC networks require\na high number of optical access points (APs), each AP corresponding to an\noptical cell, to provide uniform coverage for multiple users. Therefore,\ninter-cell interference (ICI) and multi-user interference (MUI) are crucial\nissues that must be managed efficiently to provide high spectral efficiency. In\nradio frequency (RF) networks, rate splitting (RS) is proposed as a\ntransmission scheme to serve multiple users simultaneously following a certain\nstrategy. It was shown that RS provides high data rates compared to orthogonal\nand non-orthogonal interference management schemes. Considering the high\ndensity of OWC networks, the application of RS within each optical cell might\nnot be practical due to severe ICI. In this paper, a new strategy is derived\nreferred to as blind interference alignment-rate splitting (BIA-RS) to fully\ncoordinate the transmission among the optical APs, while determining the\nprecoding matrices of multiple groups of users formed beforehand. Therefore, RS\ncan be implemented within each group to manage MUI. The proposed BIA-RS scheme\nrequires two layers of power allocation to achieve high performance. Given\nthat, a max-min fractional optimization problem is formulated to optimally\ndistribute the power budget among the groups and the messages intended to the\nusers of each group. Finally, a power allocation algorithm is designed with\nmultiple Lagrangian multipliers to provide practical and sub-optimal solutions.\nThe results show the high performance of the proposed scheme compared to other\ncounterpart schemes.",

Our\nprocedure avoids expensive encoding of the constraints to word equations and,\ninstead, reduces the problem to checking conflicts on positions satisfying an\ninteger constraint obtained from the Parikh image of a polynomial-sized finite\nautomaton with a special structure. By the reduction to counting, solving\nposition constraints becomes NP-complete and for some cases even falls into\nPTime.

This work allows them to\nexcel also on position constraints, which used to be their weakness. Besides\nthe efficiency gains, we show that our framework may be extended to solve a\nlarge fragment of not-contains (in NExpTime), for which decidability has been\nlong open, and gives a hope to solve the general problem.

    "abstract": "Performance gap across classes remains a persistent challenge in machine\nlearning, often attributed to variations in class hardness. One way to quantify\nclass hardness is through sample complexity - the minimum number of samples\nrequired to effectively learn a given class. Sample complexity theory suggests\nthat class hardness is driven by differences in the amount of data required for\ngeneralization. That is, harder classes need substantially more samples to\nachieve generalization. Therefore, hardness-based resampling is a promising\napproach to mitigate these performance disparities. While resampling has been\nstudied extensively in data-imbalanced settings, its impact on balanced\ndatasets remains unexplored.\n  This raises the fundamental question whether resampling is effective because\nit addresses data imbalance or hardness imbalance. We begin addressing this\nquestion by introducing class imbalance into balanced datasets and evaluate its\neffect on performance disparities. We oversample hard classes and undersample\neasy classes to bring hard classes closer to their sample complexity\nrequirements while maintaining a constant dataset size for fairness. We\nestimate class-level hardness using the Area Under the Margin (AUM) hardness\nestimator and leverage it to compute resampling ratios. Using these ratios, we\nperform hardness-based resampling on the well-known CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100\ndatasets.\n  Contrary to theoretical expectations, our results show that hardness-based\nresampling does not meaningfully affect class-wise performance disparities. To\nexplain this discrepancy, we conduct detailed analyses to identify key\nchallenges unique to hardness-based imbalance, distinguishing it from\ntraditional data-based imbalance. Our insights help explain why theoretical\nsample complexity expectations fail to translate into practical performance\ngains and we provide guidelines for future research.",

To address this challenge, we propose a novel\nframework for distilling large model priors, eliminating the need for text\nguidance during inference while dramatically reducing model size.

Our method achieves a favorable\ntrade-off between computational efficiency and fusion quality. The distilled\nnetwork, requiring only 10% of the parameters and inference time of the teacher\nnetwork, retains 90% of its performance and outperforms existing SOTA methods.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

    "abstract": "When a quantum system is prepared in its many-body ground state, it can be\nadiabatically driven to another ground state by changing its control parameter.\nHowever, relying on adiabaticity is experimentally unjustified. Moreover, the\ntarget value of the control parameter may occur outside the experimentally\naccessible range. The indicated target state, however, can still be reached\nwithin a clever protocol of temporal changes of the control parameter provided\nits decomposition into some basis is known. It turns out that such a protocol\ncan be obtained in the framework of the optimal control theory. In this paper,\nwe show how to apply such an optimization scheme to small quantum systems\ntreating interaction strength as the control parameter. We believe that the\nproposed approach can be creatively extended to various complex quantum\nsystems.",

As the field\nmatures, the need for rigorous microarchitectures, and corresponding\nperformance and cost analysis, become critical for evaluating secure schemes\nand for enabling their future adoption.\n  In ShadowBinding, we present effective microarchitectures for two\nstate-of-the-art secure schemes, uncovering and mitigating fundamental\nmicroarchitectural limitations within the analyzed schemes, and provide\nimportant design characteristics. We uncover that Speculative Taint Tracking's\n(STT's) rename-based taint computation must be completed in a single cycle,\ncreating an expensive dependency chain which greatly limits performance for\nwider processor cores.

    "abstract": "Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) is crucial for deploying reliable Deep\nLearning (DL) models in high-stakes applications. Recently, General Type-2\nFuzzy Logic Systems (GT2-FLSs) have been proven to be effective for UQ,\noffering Prediction Intervals (PIs) to capture uncertainty. However, existing\nmethods often struggle with computational efficiency and adaptability, as\ngenerating PIs for new coverage levels $(\\phi_d)$ typically requires retraining\nthe model. Moreover, methods that directly estimate the entire conditional\ndistribution for UQ are computationally expensive, limiting their scalability\nin real-world scenarios. This study addresses these challenges by proposing a\nblueprint calibration strategy for GT2-FLSs, enabling efficient adaptation to\nany desired $\\phi_d$ without retraining. By exploring the relationship between\n$\\alpha$-plane type reduced sets and uncertainty coverage, we develop two\ncalibration methods: a lookup table-based approach and a derivative-free\noptimization algorithm. These methods allow GT2-FLSs to produce accurate and\nreliable PIs while significantly reducing computational overhead. Experimental\nresults on high-dimensional datasets demonstrate that the calibrated GT2-FLS\nachieves superior performance in UQ, highlighting its potential for scalable\nand practical applications.",

Existing methods\non code watermarking, leveraging the idea from the backdoor research, embed\nstealthy triggers as watermarks.Despite their high resilience against dilution\nattacks and backdoor detections, the robustness has not been fully evaluated.\nTo fill this gap, we propose DeCoMa, a dual-channel approach to Detect and\npurify Code dataset waterMarks.To overcome the high barrier created by the\nstealthy and hidden nature of code watermarks, DeCoMa leverages dual-channel\nconstraints on code to generalize and map code samples into standardized\ntemplates. Subsequently, DeCoMa extracts hidden watermarks by identifying\noutlier associations between paired elements within the standardized templates.\nFinally, DeCoMa purifies the watermarked dataset by removing all samples\ncontaining the detected watermark, enabling the silent appropriation of\nprotected code. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness\nand efficiency of DeCoMa, covering 14 types of code watermarks and 3\nrepresentative intelligent code tasks (a total of 14 scenarios). Experimental\nresults demonstrate that DeCoMa achieves a stable recall of 100% in 14 code\nwatermark detection scenarios, significantly outperforming the baselines.\nAdditionally, DeCoMa effectively attacks code watermarks with embedding rates\nas low as 0.1%, while maintaining comparable model performance after training\non the purified dataset. Furthermore, as DeCoMa requires no model training for\ndetection, it achieves substantially higher efficiency than all baselines, with\na speedup ranging from 31.5 to 130.9X.

Teleoperated robots offer a promising solution,\nbut conventional motion-mapping teleoperation imposes unnatural movement\nconstraints on operators, leading to muscle fatigue and reduced usability. This\npaper presents a novel teleoperation framework that leverages action\nrecognition to enable intuitive remote robot control. Using our simplified\nSpatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (S-ST-GCN), the system recognizes\nhuman actions and executes corresponding preset robot trajectories, eliminating\nthe need for direct motion synchronization. A finite-state machine (FSM) is\nintegrated to enhance reliability by filtering out misclassified actions.

This proof-of-concept study\nhighlights the potential of teleoperation with action recognition for enabling\ncaregivers to remotely assist older adults during activities of daily living\n(ADLs). Future work will focus on improving the S-ST-GCN's recognition accuracy\nand generalization, integrating advanced motion planning techniques to further\nenhance robotic autonomy in older adult care, and conducting a user study to\nevaluate the system's telepresence and ease of control.",

    "abstract": "Finding new materials with previously unknown atomic structure or materials\nwith optimal set of properties for a specific application greatly benefits from\ncomputational modeling. Recently, such screening has been dramatically\naccelerated by the invent of universal machine-learning interatomic potentials\nthat offer first principles accuracy at orders of magnitude lower computational\ncost. Their application to the screening of defects with desired properties or\nto finding new stable compounds with high density of defects, however, has not\nbeen explored. Here, we show that the universal machine-learning interatomic\npotentials have reached sufficient accuracy to enable large-scale screening of\ndefective materials. We carried out vacancy calculations for 86 259 materials\nin the Materials Project database and analyzed the formation energies in terms\nof oxidation numbers. We further demonstrate the application of these models\nfor finding new materials at or below the convex hull of known materials and\nfor simulated etching of low-dimensional materials.",

    "abstract": "Our understanding of galaxy properties and evolution is contingent on knowing\nthe initial mass function (IMF), and yet to date, the IMF is constrained only\nto local galaxies. Individual stars are now becoming routinely detected at\ncosmological distances, where luminous stars such as supergiants in background\ngalaxies strongly lensed by galaxy clusters are temporarily further magnified\nby huge factors (up to $10^{4}$) by intracluster stars, thus being detected as\ntransients. The detection rate of these events depends on the abundance of\nluminous stars in the background galaxy and is thus sensitive to the IMF and\nthe star-formation history (SFH), especially for the blue supergiants detected\nas transients in the rest-frame ultraviolet/optical filters. As a proof of\nconcept, we use simple SFH and IMF models constrained by spectral energy\ndistributions (SEDs) to see how well we can predict the {\\it HST} and {\\it\nJWST} transient detection rate in a lensed arc dubbed ``Spock'' ($z = 1.0054$).\nWe find that demanding a simultaneous fit of the SED and the transient\ndetection rate places constraints on the IMF, independent of the assumed simple\nSFH model. We conclude our likelihood analysis indicates that the data\ndefinitively prefers the ``Spock'' galaxy to have a Salpeter IMF ($\\alpha =\n2.35$) rather than a Top-heavy IMF ($\\alpha = 1$) -- which is thought to be the\ncase in the early universe -- with no clear excess of supergiants above the\nstandard IMF.",

In this paper, we address\nthese challenges by systematically evaluating and optimizing machine learning\n(ML) models for MetS prediction, leveraging advanced data balancing techniques\nand counterfactual analysis. Multiple ML models, including XGBoost, Random\nForest, TabNet, etc., were trained and compared under various data balancing\ntechniques such as random oversampling (ROS), SMOTE, ADASYN, and CTGAN.\nAdditionally, we introduce MetaBoost, a novel hybrid framework that integrates\nSMOTE, ADASYN, and CTGAN, optimizing synthetic data generation through weighted\naveraging and iterative weight tuning to enhance the model's performance\n(achieving up to a 1.87% accuracy improvement over individual balancing\ntechniques). A comprehensive counterfactual analysis is conducted to quantify\nthe feature-level changes required to shift individuals from high-risk to\nlow-risk categories. The results indicate that blood glucose (50.3%) and\ntriglycerides (46.7%) were the most frequently modified features, highlighting\ntheir clinical significance in MetS risk reduction. Additionally, probabilistic\nanalysis shows elevated blood glucose (85.5% likelihood) and triglycerides\n(74.9% posterior probability) as the strongest predictors.

In this\nbrief note we investigate whether alternative chiral boundary field contents\nmay be allowed by anomaly cancellation once supersymmetry is dropped. Even\nthen, anomaly inflow places stringent constraints on the gauge group $G$ and\nmatter content of the boundary worldvolume theory, which we determine\nexplicitly. We find the most general solution to these constraints in the case\nwhere all matter fields are of the same chirality, for all simple Lie algebras\nexcept $\\mathfrak{sp}_2$, $\\mathfrak{su}_{n\\leq5}$, and $\\mathfrak{so}_{n}$\nwith $7\\leq n\\leq 12$, and find no solutions other than the supersymmetric\n$E_8$ boundary of Ho\\v{r}ava and Witten.

Therefore, it could in principle describe the low-energy theory of a novel\nnonsupersymmetric M-theory boundary condition, different from the\nHo\\v{r}ava-Witten proposal.

Abbasi et al. presented a unified\napproach to obtain EPASes (i.e., $(1+\\epsilon)$-approximations running in time\nFPT in $k$ and $\\epsilon$) for $k$-Clustering in metrics of bounded scatter\ndimension. However, a seemingly inherent limitation of their approach was that\nit could only handle clustering objectives where each point was assigned to the\nclosest chosen center. They explicitly asked, if there exist EPASes for\nconstrained $k$-Clustering in metrics of bounded scatter dimension.\n  We present a unified framework which yields EPASes capacitated and fair\n$k$-Median/Means in metrics of bounded algorithmic scatter dimension. Our\nframework exploits coresets for such constrained clustering problems in a novel\nmanner, and notably requires only coresets of size $(k\\log n/\\epsilon)^{O(1)}$,\nwhich are usually constuctible even in general metrics. Note that due to\nexisting lower bounds it is impossible to obtain such an EPAS for Capacitated\n$k$-Center, thus essentially answering the complete spectrum of the question.\n  Our results on capacitated and fair $k$-Median/Means provide the first EPASes\nfor these problems in broad families of metric spaces.

    "abstract": "Automated extraction of plant morphological traits is crucial for supporting\ncrop breeding and agricultural management through high-throughput field\nphenotyping (HTFP). Solutions based on multi-view RGB images are attractive due\nto their scalability and affordability, enabling volumetric measurements that\n2D approaches cannot directly capture. While advanced methods like Neural\nRadiance Fields (NeRFs) have shown promise, their application has been limited\nto counting or extracting traits from only a few plants or organs. Furthermore,\naccurately measuring complex structures like individual wheat heads-essential\nfor studying crop yields-remains particularly challenging due to occlusions and\nthe dense arrangement of crop canopies in field conditions. The recent\ndevelopment of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offers a promising alternative for\nHTFP due to its high-quality reconstructions and explicit point-based\nrepresentation. In this paper, we present Wheat3DGS, a novel approach that\nleverages 3DGS and the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for precise 3D instance\nsegmentation and morphological measurement of hundreds of wheat heads\nautomatically, representing the first application of 3DGS to HTFP. We validate\nthe accuracy of wheat head extraction against high-resolution laser scan data,\nobtaining per-instance mean absolute percentage errors of 15.1%, 18.3%, and\n40.2% for length, width, and volume. We provide additional comparisons to\nNeRF-based approaches and traditional Muti-View Stereo (MVS), demonstrating\nsuperior results. Our approach enables rapid, non-destructive measurements of\nkey yield-related traits at scale, with significant implications for\naccelerating crop breeding and improving our understanding of wheat\ndevelopment.",

    "abstract": "In order to achieve low latency, high throughput, and partition tolerance,\nmodern databases forgo strong transaction isolation for weak isolation\nguarantees. However, several production databases have been found to suffer\nfrom isolation bugs, breaking their data-consistency contract. Black-box\ntesting is a prominent technique for detecting isolation bugs, by checking\nwhether histories of database transactions adhere to a prescribed isolation\nlevel.\n  Testing databases on realistic workloads of large size requires isolation\ntesters to be as efficient as possible, a requirement that has initiated a\nstudy of the complexity of isolation testing. Although testing strong isolation\nhas been known to be NP-complete, weak isolation levels were recently shown to\nbe testable in polynomial time, which has propelled the scalability of testing\ntools. However, existing testers have a large polynomial complexity,\nrestricting testing to workloads of only moderate size, which is not typical of\nlarge-scale databases.\n  In this work, we develop AWDIT, a highly-efficient and provably optimal\ntester for weak database isolation. Given a history $H$ of size $n$ and $k$\nsessions, AWDIT tests whether H satisfies the most common weak isolation levels\nof Read Committed (RC), Read Atomic (RA), and Causal Consistency (CC) in time\n$O(n^{3/2})$, $O(n^{3/2})$, and $O(n \\cdot k)$, respectively, improving\nsignificantly over the state of the art. Moreover, we prove that AWDIT is\nessentially optimal, in the sense that there is a conditional lower bound of\n$n^{3/2}$ for any weak isolation level between RC and CC. Our experiments show\nthat AWDIT is significantly faster than existing, highly optimized testers;\ne.g., for the $\\sim$20% largest histories, AWDIT obtains an average speedup of\n$245\\times$, $193\\times$, and $62\\times$ for RC, RA, and CC, respectively, over\nthe best baseline.",

Most\nexisting literature is devoted to framelet systems that only use one dilation\nmatrix as the sampling factor. To keep some key properties such as\ndirectionality, a framelet system often has a high redundancy rate. To reduce\nredundancy, a one-dimensional tight framelet with mixed dilation factors has\nbeen introduced for image processing. Though such tight framelets offer good\nperformance in practice, their theoretical properties are far from being well\nunderstood. In this paper, we will systematically investigate framelets with\nmixed dilation factors, with arbitrary multiplicity in arbitrary dimensions.

From orbital fitting of multi-epoch radial velocities\nwe find a 221-day period. We also find an eccentricity of $e=0.52$, which is\nunexpectedly high as tides are expected to have circularised the orbit\nefficiently during the presumed recent mass transfer. The formation of a\ncircumbinary disk during the mass transfer phase or the presence of an unseen\ntertiary companion might explain the orbit's high eccentricity. We determined\nphysical parameters for both stars by fitting the spectra of the disentangled\nbinary components and multi-band photometry. The stripped nature of the donor\nstar is affirmed by its high luminosity at a low inferred mass ($\\lesssim 1\n\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$) and imprints of CNO-processed material in the surface\nabundances. The donor's relatively large radius and cool temperature\n($T_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 13.5 \\pm 0.5$ kK) suggest that it has only recently ceased\nmass transfer. Evolutionary models assuming a 5-6 $\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$ progenitor\ncan reproduce these parameters and imply that the binary is currently evolving\ntowards a stage where the donor becomes a subdwarf orbiting a Be star. The\nremarkably high eccentricity of HIP 15429 challenges standard tidal evolution\nmodels, suggesting either inefficient tidal dissipation or external influences,\nsuch as a tertiary companion or circumbinary disk. This underscores the need to\nidentify and characterise more post-mass transfer binaries to benchmark and\nrefine theoretical models of binary evolution.",

Some studies have also explored the issue of\nprompt brittleness and proposed methods to quantify performance variations;\nhowever, no simple solution has been found to address this challenge.

On structured networks, however,\nthe number of equations can be reduced to a manageable size which is amendable\nto simulations and analysis.

This is dual to most existing computational strategies, which define\nsets through some combination of generator vectors, and usually discretize the\nsystem dynamics.

    "abstract": "The recently proposed Forgetting Transformer (FoX) incorporates a forget gate\ninto softmax attention and has shown consistently better or on-par performance\ncompared to the standard RoPE-based Transformer. Notably, many attention heads\nin FoX tend to forget quickly, causing their output at each timestep to rely\nprimarily on local context. Based on this observation, we propose Adaptive\nComputation Pruning (ACP) for FoX, a method that dynamically prunes\ncomputations involving input-output dependencies that are strongly decayed by\nthe forget gate. In particular, our method performs provably safe pruning via a\ndynamically set pruning threshold that guarantees the pruned attention weights\nare negligible. We apply ACP to language model pretraining with FoX and show it\nconsistently reduces the number of FLOPs and memory accesses in softmax\nattention by around 70% across different model sizes and context lengths,\nresulting in a roughly 50% to 70% reduction in attention runtime (or a\n2-3$\\times$ speedup) and a roughly 10% to 40% increase in end-to-end training\nthroughput. Furthermore, longer context lengths yield greater computational\nsavings. All these speed improvements are achieved without any performance\ndegradation.

In the\nsupercritical range, the uniqueness problem is much more complicated, even on\nthe planar case $n=1$. One of the famous results was shown by Andrews in (J.\nAmer. Math.

In this paper, we study the same uniqueness\nproblem in the full supercritical range $p\\in(-2n-5,-n-1)$ for all higher\ndimensional cases $n\\geq2$. We will prove that for $p\\in(-2n-5,-n-1)$, the\nunique strongly symmetric solution is given by the unit sphere ${\\S}^n$. The\nuniqueness range $(-2n-5,-n-1)$ is optimal due to our recent preprint (arXiv:\n2104.07426), where non-spherical strongly symmetric solutions have been\nconstructed for all $p\\in(-\\infty,-2n-5)$.

To help characterize\nthe underlying mechanics associated with viscous erosion and crater formation,\nexperimental measurements using regolith simulants and subsonic, non-reacting\nflows were completed using compressed air in a splitter plate, plume cratering\nsetup. More specifically, these investigations examined the underlying effects\nof bulk density, cohesion, and exhaust flow characteristics on viscous erosion\nrates and crater formation using Lunar highlands simulant (LHS-1), Lunar mare\nsimulant (LMS-1), LHS-1D (Dust) simulants, and 40-80 um glass beads in\natmosphere.

Measurements show that increasing bulk density, especially from an\nuncompacted to a slightly compacted state, decreases erosion rate by as much as\n50%. While cohesion of granular material can mitigate erosion rates to some\nextent, higher levels of cohesion above 1,000 Pa may actually increase viscous\nerosion rates due to particle clumping.

We also presented\nanother algorithm that uses smaller memory but costs an extra $d^\\frac{1}{4}$\nin complexity. Consider the Grover operator, the unitary operator used in\nGrover's algorithm. It contains an oracle that uses a $\\pm 1$ phase for each\ncandidate for the search space. Previous work has demonstrated that when we\nsubstitute the oracle in Grover operator with generic phases, it ended up being\na good mean value estimator in some mathematical notion.

This paper\nintroduces and evaluates an automated high-frequency trading strategy for\nbattery energy storage systems trading on the intraday market for power while\nexplicitly considering the dynamics of the limit order book, market rules, and\ntechnical parameters. The standard rolling intrinsic strategy is adapted for\ncontinuous intraday electricity markets and solved using a dynamic programming\napproximation that is two to three orders of magnitude faster than an exact\nmixed-integer linear programming solution. A detailed backtest over a full year\nof German order book data demonstrates that the proposed dynamic programming\nformulation does not reduce trading profits and enables the policy to react to\nevery relevant order book update, enabling realistic rapid backtesting. Our\nresults show the significant revenue potential of high-frequency trading: our\npolicy earns 58% more than when re-optimizing only once every hour and 14% more\nthan when re-optimizing once per minute, highlighting that profits critically\ndepend on trading speed.

These models approximate low-dimensional\nmarginals or query workloads; crucially, they require the training data to be\npre-discretized, i.e., continuous values need to first be partitioned into\nbins. However, as the range of values (or their domain) is often inferred\ndirectly from the training data, with the number of bins and bin edges\ntypically defined arbitrarily, this approach can ultimately break end-to-end DP\nguarantees and may not always yield optimal utility.\n  In this paper, we present an extensive measurement study of four\ndiscretization strategies in the context of DP marginal generative models. More\nprecisely, we design DP versions of three discretizers (uniform, quantile, and\nk-means) and reimplement the PrivTree algorithm. We find that optimizing both\nthe choice of discretizer and bin count can improve utility, on average, by\nalmost 30% across six DP marginal models, compared to the default strategy and\nnumber of bins, with PrivTree being the best-performing discretizer in the\nmajority of cases. We demonstrate that, while DP generative models with\nnon-private discretization remain vulnerable to membership inference attacks,\napplying DP during discretization effectively mitigates this risk.

This often leads to incorrect redshift assignments when\nrelying on a single emission line, due to noise spikes or contamination from\nnon-target emission lines, commonly referred to as redshift interlopers. We\npropose a machine learning approach to correct the impact of interlopers at the\nlevel of measured summary statistics, focusing on the power spectrum monopole\nand line interlopers as a proof of concept. To model interloper effects, we use\nhalo catalogs from the Quijote simulations as proxies for galaxies, displacing\na fraction of halos by the distance corresponding to the redshift offset\nbetween target and interloper galaxies. This yields contaminated catalogs with\nvarying interloper fractions across a wide range of cosmologies from the\nQuijote suite. We train a neural network on the power spectrum monopole, alone\nor combined with the bispectrum monopole, from contaminated mocks to estimate\nthe interloper fraction and reconstruct the cleaned power spectrum. We evaluate\nperformance in two settings: one with fixed cosmology and another where\ncosmological parameters vary under broad priors. In the fixed case, the network\nrecovers the interloper fraction and corrects the power spectrum to better than\n1% accuracy. When cosmology varies, performance degrades, but adding bispectrum\ninformation significantly improves results, reducing the interloper fraction\nerror by 40-60%. We also study the method's performance as a function of the\nsize of the training set and find that optimal strategies depend on the\ncorrelation between target and interloper samples: bispectrum information aids\nperformance when target and interloper galaxies are uncorrelated, while tighter\npriors are more effective when the two are strongly correlated.",

The required modelling is\nstraightforward in Newtonian gravity -- where the tide can be represented in\nterms of a sum involving the star's oscillation modes -- but not yet fully\ndeveloped in general relativity -- where the mode-sum approach is problematic.\nAs a step towards more realistic models, we are motivated to explore the\npost-Newtonian (pN) approach to the problem (noting that the modes should still\nprovide an adequate basis for a tidal expansion up to 2pN order). Specifically,\nin this paper we develop the pN framework for neutron star oscillations and\nexplore to what extent the results remain robust for stars in the strong-field\nregime. Our numerical results show that the model is accurate for low-mass\nstars ($\\lesssim 0.8M_{\\odot}$), but becomes problematic for more massive\nstars. However, we demonstrate that the main issues can be resolved (at the\ncost of abandoning the consistency of the pN expansion) allowing us to extend\nthe calculation into the neutron star regime. For canonical neutron stars\n($\\approx 1.4M_\\odot$) our adjusted formulation provides the fundamental mode\nof the star with an accuracy comparable to that of the relativistic Cowling\napproximation. For lower mass stars, our approach is significantly better.",

In the Earth Observation\nfield, satellite failure or cloud occlusion frequently results in missing\ntime-steps, introducing uncertainties in the predicted output and causing a\ndecline in predictive performance. While many studies address missing\ntime-steps through data augmentation to improve model robustness, the\nuncertainty arising at the input level is commonly overlooked. To address this\ngap, we introduce Monte Carlo Temporal Dropout (MC-TD), a method that\nexplicitly accounts for input-level uncertainty by randomly dropping time-steps\nduring inference using a predefined dropout ratio, thereby simulating the\neffect of missing data. To bypass the need for costly searches for the optimal\ndropout ratio, we extend this approach with Monte Carlo Concrete Temporal\nDropout (MC-ConcTD), a method that learns the optimal dropout distribution\ndirectly. Both MC-TD and MC-ConcTD are applied during inference, leveraging\nMonte Carlo sampling for uncertainty quantification. Experiments on three EO\ntime-series datasets demonstrate that MC-ConcTD improves predictive performance\nand uncertainty calibration compared to existing approaches. Additionally, we\nhighlight the advantages of adaptive dropout tuning over manual selection,\nmaking uncertainty quantification more robust and accessible for EO\napplications.",

The possibility of equatorial superrotation has been\nstudied in a range of planetary atmospheres, including Earth-like ones, with\nthe objective of understanding the underlying dynamical processes. However, the\nbroader impact that this dramatic circulation change would have on the climate\nsystem is practically unexplored. This is the question we address here. We\nperform idealized GCM simulations with an imposed equatorial torque to\ninvestigate how a forced superrotating atmosphere affects surface temperature\nand the water cycle. We show that these effects are quite large and directly\nrelated to the global circulation changes, which extend beyond the tropical\natmosphere. Using tools including a forcing/feedback analysis and a moist\nenergy balance model, we argue that the dominant mechanism is changes in\natmospheric energy transport, driven in particular by the collapse of the\nmeridional overturning circulation, and to a smaller extent by the appearance\nof an equatorial jet, and the concomitant redistribution of moisture in the\ntropics, leading to a much weaker relative humidity gradient which has strong\nradiative effects.",

The key idea is to divide the original network into\nmultiple subnetworks with a shared overlap part, producing training sets\nconsisting of the subnetworks and a test set with the node pairs between the\nsubnetworks. This train-test split provides the basis for a network\ncross-validation procedure that can be applied on a wide range of model\nselection and parameter tuning problems for networks. The method is\ncomputationally efficient for large networks as it uses smaller subnetworks for\nthe training step. We provide methodological details and theoretical guarantees\nfor several model selection and parameter tuning tasks using NETCROP. Numerical\nresults demonstrate that NETCROP performs accurate cross-validation on a\ndiverse set of network model selection and parameter tuning problems. The\nresults also indicate that NETCROP is computationally much faster while being\noften more accurate than the existing methods for network cross-validation.",

In this work, we propose and analyze\na Measurement Device Independent (MDI) protocol designed to distribute keys\namong three users in a pairwise manner. Each user randomly selects a basis,\nencodes bit values in the phase of coherent states, and sends the resulting\npulses to a central measurement unit (MU) composed of three beam splitters and\nthree photon detectors. When the three pulses arrive simultaneously at the MU\nand under the condition of successful detection of photons, a key bit is\ndistributed to at least one pair of users.

Consequently, the capacity of quantum\ndevices to amplify the privacy of a weak source of randomness, in cases\nunattainable by classical methods, constitutes a practical advantage. One of\nthe theoretical models of such weak sources are the so-called Santha-Vazirani\n(SV) sources; however, finding natural sources satisfying the SV model is a\nparamount challenge. In this article, we take three significant steps on the\nway to simplify this hard task. We begin with an in-depth analysis of the\nmathematical background for estimating the quality of a weak randomness source\nby providing a set of axioms that systematize the possible approaches to such\nestimation. We then develop software (SVTest) to estimate the parameter\ncharacterizing the source's randomness. The software is general-purpose, i.e.,\nit can test the randomness of any target sequence of bits. Later, we apply the\nsoftware to test seismic events (earthquakes and local noise) as potential\nsources of randomness. Our results demonstrate that seismic phenomena are\npossible sources of randomness, depending on the choice of discretization.\nTherefore, our work provides strong evidence of the potential of geophysical\nphenomena as a source of cryptographic resources, building an unprecedented\nbridge between both fields.",

Here, we analyze the different error processes that arise during readout\nusing a double-latched scheme in a germanium double quantum dot hole spin qubit\nsystem.

However, most existing methods are trained with image triplets of\nsketch, reference, and ground truth that are semantically and spatially\nwell-aligned, while real-world references and sketches often exhibit\nsubstantial misalignment. This mismatch in data distribution between training\nand inference leads to overfitting, consequently resulting in spatial artifacts\nand significant degradation in overall colorization quality, limiting potential\napplications of current methods for general purposes. To address this\nlimitation, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the \\textbf{carrier}, defined as\nthe latent representation facilitating information transfer from reference to\nsketch. Based on this analysis, we propose a novel workflow that dynamically\nadapts the carrier to optimize distinct aspects of colorization. Specifically,\nfor spatially misaligned artifacts, we introduce a split cross-attention\nmechanism with spatial masks, enabling region-specific reference injection\nwithin the diffusion process. To mitigate semantic neglect of sketches, we\nemploy dedicated background and style encoders to transfer detailed reference\ninformation in the latent feature space, achieving enhanced spatial control and\nricher detail synthesis. Furthermore, we propose character-mask merging and\nbackground bleaching as preprocessing steps to improve foreground-background\nintegration and background generation.

Instruments like\nVLT/SPHERE are state of the art in high-contrast imaging, but their spectral\nresolution (R=50) limits them to basic characterization of close companions.\nThese systems can detect planets down to 5-10 Mjup at 10 AU from their stars.\nDetection limits are mainly constrained by speckle noise, which dominates over\nphoton and detector noise at short separations, even with advanced differential\nimaging. Space-based high-contrast imaging is also limited by image stability.\nSpeckle noise can, however, be mitigated through molecular mapping, a technique\nthat leverages high-resolution spectroscopic data.\n  AIMS: We aim to predict detection limits in spectro-imaging after molecular\nmapping, analyzing how photon and detector noise propagate and comparing\npredictions with real data to assess performance losses from instrumental\neffects. We also propose mitigation strategies and validate our model using\nobservations.\n  METHODS: We analyzed JWST/MIRI/MRS data with FastCurves, an numerical tool,\nand compared results to outputs from the MIRI simulator. We also applied\nprincipal component analysis (PCA) to identify and isolate systematic effects,\nwith and without molecular mapping.\n  RESULTS: We studied various systematic effects and their impacts on signal\nand noise. PCA helped highlight and reduce straylight, fringes, and aliasing.\nWe further compared observed and modeled companion spectra.\n  CONCLUSIONS: FastCurves was improved to account for systematics and validated\nwith real data. In high-flux regimes, systematics impose contrast limits even\nwith molecular mapping. Our approach could benefit other instruments and inform\nthe planning of future facilities like ELT/ANDES and ELT/PCS.",

The implementation provides a simple API extension for specifying the\nnumerical precision for individual kernels, and thus allows for testing the\neffect of low and mixed precision on the accuracy of the solution. To showcase\nthis, we study the impact of precision on the overall convergence order and\nactual accuracy of the method as achieved for four common hyperbolic PDE\nsystems and five relevant scenarios that feature an analytic solution. For all\nscenarios, we also assess how sensitive each kernel of the ADER-DG algorithm is\nto using double, single or even half precision. This addresses the question\nwhere thoughtful adoption of mixed precision can mitigate hurtful effects of\nlow precision on the overall simulation.",

    "abstract": "We explore entanglement harvesting using two Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detectors\nlinearly coupled to the scalar density of a massless spin-1/2 field in 1+1\nSchwarzschild spacetime. We consider different vacua, including the Boulware,\nHartle-Hawking-Israel (HHI), and Unruh vacua, and investigate various\nconfigurations of detector trajectories. We find that the transition rate of\nthe static UDW detector exhibits the expected Planckian behavior in the HHI\nstate, while the Unruh state leads to the Helmholtz free energy density of a\nfermionic thermal bath. We demonstrate that the near-horizon entanglement\nproperties for static detectors in the HHI state have similar behaviour to\nthose in Minkowski vacua for uniformly accelerated detectors in Rindler\nspacetime. We further consider a different interaction Hamiltonian which breaks\nlocal Lorentz symmetry and find that the transition rate of the static detector\nstill exhibits Planckian behavior in the HHI state, while in the Unruh state,\nit leads to the Helmholtz free energy density of a bosonic or fermionic thermal\nbath corresponding to the static or conformal 2-bein in interaction,\nrespectively. We observe that the anti-Hawking effect enhances the entanglement\nbetween the two detectors while the gravitational redshift and Hawking\nradiation decrease it. In particular, due to the presence of the anti-Hawking\neffect, the mutual information and concurrence near the event horizon can be\nnon-zero even for static detectors with static 2-bein, which is in contrast\nwith the case of the scalar field.

Nevertheless, inspired by\nculture theories, we identify two key challenges faced by these datasets: (1)\nRepresentativeness: These corpora fail to fully capture the target culture's\ncore characteristics with redundancy, causing computation waste; (2)\nDistinctiveness: They struggle to distinguish the unique nuances of a given\nculture from shared patterns across other relevant ones, hindering precise\ncultural modeling. To handle these challenges, we introduce CAReDiO, a novel\ncultural data construction framework. Specifically, CAReDiO utilizes powerful\nLLMs to automatically generate cultural conversation data, where both the\nqueries and responses are further optimized by maximizing representativeness\nand distinctiveness. Using CAReDiO, we construct a small yet effective dataset,\ncovering five cultures, and compare it with several recent cultural corpora.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our method generates more effective data\nand enables cultural alignment with as few as 100 training samples, enhancing\nboth performance and efficiency.",

While existing datasets for AVEL predominantly comprise\nlandscape-oriented long videos with clean and simple audio context, short\nvideos have become the primary format of online video content due to the the\nproliferation of smartphones. Short videos are characterized by\nportrait-oriented framing and layered audio compositions (e.g., overlapping\nsound effects, voiceovers, and music), which brings unique challenges\nunaddressed by conventional methods. To this end, we introduce AVE-PM, the\nfirst AVEL dataset specifically designed for portrait mode short videos,\ncomprising 25,335 clips that span 86 fine-grained categories with frame-level\nannotations. Beyond dataset creation, our empirical analysis shows that\nstate-of-the-art AVEL methods suffer an average 18.66% performance drop during\ncross-mode evaluation. Further analysis reveals two key challenges of different\nvideo formats: 1) spatial bias from portrait-oriented framing introduces\ndistinct domain priors, and 2) noisy audio composition compromise the\nreliability of audio modality. To address these issues, we investigate optimal\npreprocessing recipes and the impact of background music for AVEL on portrait\nmode videos.

An SBOM is a list of components used\nin software, including details such as component names, versions, and licenses.\nUsing SBOMs, developers can quickly identify software components and assess\nwhether their software depends on vulnerable libraries. Numerous tools support\nsoftware dependency management through SBOMs, which can be broadly categorized\ninto two types: tools that generate SBOMs and tools that utilize SBOMs. A\nsubstantial collection of accurate SBOMs is required to evaluate tools that\nutilize SBOMs. However, there is no publicly available dataset specifically\ndesigned for this purpose, and research on SBOM consumption tools remains\nlimited.

    "abstract": "In this study, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from bananas was extracted and\nfunctionalized and used for the first time as a homeotropic alignment layer for\nliquid crystals (LCs). Our research was aimed at extracting and investigating\nDNA from bananas via the synthesis and study of DNA complexes with various\nsurfactants to examine the usefulness of such a complex as an alignment layer\nin electro-optical transducers. We proposed a simple and eco-friendly synthesis\nof the DNA complexes isolated from bananas with surfactants, so we transformed\nthe DNA isolated from bananas into a functionalized alignment layer. A\nbiopolymer alignment layer like deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from a banana\ncomplexed with a cationic surfactant is an excellent alternative to a commonly\nused but toxic polyimide alignment layer. DNA-based materials are promising for\nphotonic applications and biosensors because of their excellent optical and\nphysical properties, biodegradability, and low production cost. The novelty of\nthe research lies in the potential use of these materials as biodegradable\nbiopolymer alignment layers for optical devices instead of conventional\npolymers, which are usually harmful for the environment.",

A\nnatural challenge for its description is to shed light on anomalous behaviours\nobserved in a variety of low-dimensional systems. We use a synergistic\ncombination of experimental and mathematical modelling to explore the transport\nproperties of the electrical discharge observed within a micro-gap based sensor\nimmersed in fluids with different insulating properties. Data from laboratory\nexperiments are collected and used to inform and calibrate four mathematical\nmodels that comprise partial differential equations describing different kinds\nof transport, including anomalous diffusion: the Gaussian Model with Time\nDependent Diffusion Coefficient, the Porous Medium Equation, the\nKardar-Parisi-Zhang Equation and the Telegrapher Equation. Performance analysis\nof the models through data fitting reveals that the Gaussian Model with a\nTime-Dependent Diffusion Coefficient most effectively describes the observed\nphenomena. This model proves particularly valuable in characterizing the\ntransport properties of electrical discharges when the micro-electrodes are\nimmersed in a wide range of insulating as well as conductive fluids. Indeed, it\ncan suitably reproduce a range of behaviours spanning from clogging to bursts,\nallowing accurate and quite general fluid classification.

Currently, the analysis of XPS data is almost\nexclusively based on the main emission peak of a given element and the rest of\nthe spectrum is discarded. This makes quantitative chemical state analyses by\npeak fitting prone to substantial error, especially in light of incomplete and\nflawed reference literature. However, most elements give rise to multiple\nemission peaks in the x-ray energy range, which are virtually never analyzed.\nFor samples with an inhomogeneous depth distribution of chemical states, these\npeaks show different but interdependent ratios of signal components, as they\ncorrespond to different information depths. In this work, we show that\nself-consistent fitting of all emission peaks lends additional reliability to\nthe depth profiling of chemical states by angular-resolved (AR-)XPS. We\ndemonstrate this using a natively oxidized thin film of the topological\ncrystalline insulator tin telluride (SnTe).

Using\nscanning near-field optical microscopy (SNOM), we directly visualize adjacent\nABAC and ABCB stacking orders with intrinsic and opposite electric\npolarizations. Our gate-dependent SNOM measurements reveal distinct optical\nresponse that systematically changes upon carrier doping and unconventional\ninterplay between DW sliding and electric polarizations, which are supported by\ndensity functional theory (DFT) calculations. Independent corroboration through\nKelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) and Raman spectroscopy confirms the polar\nnature and their polarization directions.

Methods Our first\nobjective was to compare three methods,Youden index, point closest to the (0,1)\ncorner on the receiving operator characteristic curve (ER), and concordance\nprobability, to find the optimal cut-offs for two biomarkers, using empirical\nand non-empirical approaches.

Although O-RAN specifications\nmandate offline training and validation to prevent the deployment of untrained\nor inadequately tested models, operational conflicts can still arise under\ndynamic and context-dependent conditions.This work proposes a scheduler-based\nconflict mitigation framework to address these challenges without requiring\ntraining xApps together or further xApp re-training. By examining an indirect\nconflict involving power and resource block allocation xApps and employing an\nAdvantage Actor-Critic (A2C) approach to train both xApps and the scheduler, we\nillustrate that a straightforward A2C-based scheduler improves performance\nrelative to independently deployed xApps and conflicting cases.

These findings highlight the\ncontext-dependent nature of conflicts in automated network management, as two\nxApps may conflict under certain conditions but coexist under others.\nConsequently, the ability to dynamically update and adapt the scheduler to\naccommodate diverse operational intents is vital for future network\ndeployments.

While existing methods rely on multi-frame image sequences to\nidentify moving objects, single-image MOS is critical for applications like\nmotion intention prediction and handling camera frame drops. However,\nsegmenting moving objects from a single image remains challenging for existing\nmethods due to the absence of temporal cues. To address this gap, we propose\nMovSAM, the first framework for single-image moving object segmentation. MovSAM\nleverages a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) enhanced with\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to search the moving object and generate text\nprompts based on deep thinking for segmentation. These prompts are cross-fused\nwith visual features from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and a\nVision-Language Model (VLM), enabling logic-driven moving object segmentation.\nThe segmentation results then undergo a deep thinking refinement loop, allowing\nMovSAM to iteratively improve its understanding of the scene context and\ninter-object relationships with logical reasoning. This innovative approach\nenables MovSAM to segment moving objects in single images by considering scene\nunderstanding. We implement MovSAM in the real world to validate its practical\napplication and effectiveness for autonomous driving scenarios where the\nmulti-frame methods fail. Furthermore, despite the inherent advantage of\nmulti-frame methods in utilizing temporal information, MovSAM achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance across public MOS benchmarks, reaching 92.5\\% on\nJ\\&F.

At the critical point, the cascade\nbegins as a critical branching process, where each failing node (element)\ntriggers, on average, the failure of one other node. As nodes continue to fail,\nthe network becomes increasingly fragile and the branching factor grows. If the\nfailure process does not reach extinction during its critical phase, the\nnetwork undergoes an abrupt collapse. Here, we implement the analogy between\nthis dynamic and birth-death processes to derive new analytical results and\nsignificantly optimize numerical calculations.

The\nantikaon condensate is the most studied and plausible candidate among meson\ncondensates. However, little is known about the exact interaction mechanisms\nbetween antikaons and mediator mesons. In this work, we investigate these\ninteractions by, for the first time, employing SU(3) flavor symmetry to study\nantikaon condensation in dense matter. We determine hadron couplings in the\nmesonic sector using SU(3) flavour symmetry. Among the three key parameters we\ncalculate $\\theta_v$, the mixing angle between the octet meson $\\omega_8$ and\nthe singlet meson $\\phi_1$; the ratio of the octet to singlet couplings $z$;\nand leave the weight factor that balances the symmetric and antisymmetric\ncouplings $\\alpha_v$ as a free parameter to explore its impact on the system.\nUsing this approach, we derive the couplings for antikaon interactions with\nboth singlet and octet mesons in the nonet vector meson family and examine the\ncorresponding implications for dense matter featuring antikaon condensation.\nOur findings reveal that the equation of state for dense matter becomes\nprogressively stiffer with increasing values of $\\alpha_v$, which delays the\nonset of antikaon condensation and increases the maximum achievable mass of\nneutron stars.",

It regulates concurrent access to database data by following a\nspecific sequence of acquiring and releasing locks during transaction\nexecution, thereby ensuring transaction isolation. However, in strict 2PL,\ntransactions must wait for conflicting transactions to commit and release their\nlocks, which reduces concurrency and system throughput. We have observed this\nissue is exacerbated in high-contented workloads at Tencent, where lock\ncontention can severely degrade system performance. While existing\noptimizations demonstrate some effectiveness in high-contention scenarios,\ntheir performance remains insufficient, as they suffer from lock contention and\nwaiting in hotspot access.\n  This paper presents optimizations in lock management implemented in Tencent's\ndatabase, TXSQL, with a particular focus on high-contention scenarios. First,\nwe discuss our motivations and the journey toward general lock optimization,\nwhich includes lightweight lock management, a copy-free active transaction\nlist, and queue locking mechanisms that effectively enhance concurrency.\nSecond, we introduce a hotspot-aware approach that enables certain highly\nconflicting transactions to switch to a group locking method, which groups\nconflicting transactions at a specific hotspot, allowing them to execute\nserially in an uncommitted state within a conflict group without the need for\nlocking, thereby reducing lock contention. Our evaluation shows that under\nhigh-contented workloads, TXSQL achieves performance improvements of up to 6.5x\nand up to 22.3x compared to state-of-the-art methods and systems, respectively.",

In the\nsupercritical regime, the mixing is governed by the inter-community jumps, and\nthe random walk exhibits a metastable behavior: at first it collapses to a\nlocal equilibrium, then, on a larger timescale, it can be effectively described\nas a mean-field process on the $m$ communities, with a decay to equilibrium\nwhich is asymptotically smooth and exponential. Finally, for the critical\nregime, we show a sort of interpolation of the two above-mentioned behaviors.\nAlthough the metastable behavior shown in the supercritical regime appears\nnatural from a heuristic standpoint, a substantial part of our analysis can be\nread as a control on the homogenization of the underlying random environment.",

The same for the maximum. It is natural to\nask, are there any other times adapted to $X$ exhibiting this \"symmetric\nsplitting\"? It appears that the phenomenon is most conveniently couched in\nterms of (what may be called) the noise structure of $X$.

In this work, we present a novel\ndesign for a continuous-wave diamond-based maser oscillator operating at about\n14.5 GHz and moderate cryogenic temperatures (about 180 K), achieving output\npower levels exceeding -30 dBm (1 microW). This performance represents a\ntwo-orders-of-magnitude improvement over previous diamond or ruby-based maser\noscillators.Our system integrates a high-Q (about 2460) compact metallic\nmicrowave cavity with optically pumped (111)-oriented NV-rich diamond crystals.\nThe cavity supports efficient light coupling and thermal dissipation, enabling\nsustained high-power optical excitation (>1 W) using cost-effective green LEDs.\nWe demonstrate stable maser operation with good spectral quality and validate\nits output through both frequency- and time-domain analysis with phase noise\ndata when operated in \"free running\" mode. Additionally, we provide phase noise\nestimations based on Leeson's model and show that, when coupled to a high-Q\nexternal resonator, such masers could approach thermally limited phase noise\nlevels. These predictions suggest strong potential for diamond masers to\noutperform traditional ruby-based or similar maser systems, especially given\ntheir ability to operate at higher temperatures using rugged, He-free Stirling\ncoolers. Despite current limitations related to frequency stability and jitter,\nthis work establishes diamond-based masers as promising candidates for\nnext-generation ultra-low phase noise microwave oscillators.

    "abstract": "The goal of spectral estimation is to estimate the frequencies and amplitudes\nof a nonharmonic Fourier sum given noisy time samples. This paper introduces\nthe Gradient-MUSIC algorithm, which is a novel nonconvex optimization\nreformulation of the classical MUSIC algorithm. Under the assumption that\n$m\\Delta\\geq 8\\pi$, where $\\pi/m$ is the Nyquist rate and $\\Delta$ is the\nminimum separation of the frequencies normalized to be in $[0,2\\pi)$, we\nprovide a thorough geometric analysis of the objective functions generated by\nthe algorithm. Gradient-MUSIC thresholds the objective function on a set that\nis as coarse as possible and locates a set of suitable initialization for\ngradient descent. Although the objective function is nonconvex, gradient\ndescent converges exponentially fast to the desired local minima, which are the\nestimated frequencies of the signal. For deterministic $\\ell^p$ perturbations\nand any $p\\in [1,\\infty]$, Gradient-MUSIC estimates the frequencies and\namplitudes at the minimax optimal rate in terms of the noise level and $m$. For\nexample, if the noise has $\\ell^\\infty$ norm at most $\\epsilon$, then the\nfrequencies and amplitudes are recovered up to error at most $C\\epsilon/m$ and\n$C\\epsilon$, respectively, which are optimal in $\\epsilon$ and $m$. Aside from\nlogarithmic factors, Gradient-MUSIC is optimal for white noise and matches the\nrate achieved by nonlinear least squares for various families of nonstationary\nindependent Gaussian noise. Our results show that classical MUSIC is equally\noptimal, but it requires an expensive search on a thin grid, whereas\nGradient-MUSIC is always computationally more efficient, especially for small\nnoise.

Additionally, we propose\nFully-Orthogonal and Semi-Orthogonal multiple access schemes to facilitate SBC\nalongside primary communication.

To address the partial DLI\ninherent in Semi-Orthogonal schemes, successive interference cancellation (SIC)\nis employed at the receiver, enhancing SBC reliability. To tackle channel\nestimation challenges in SBC within the SR system, we implement non-coherent\ndetection techniques at the receiver.

To tackle this issue, we propose\nZeroth-order Intrinsic-dimensional Prompt-tuning (ZIP), a novel approach that\nenables efficient and robust prompt optimization in a purely black-box setting.\nThe key idea of ZIP is to reduce the problem dimensionality and the variance of\nzeroth-order gradient estimates, such that the training is done fast with far\nless queries. We achieve this by re-parameterizing prompts in low-rank\nrepresentations and designing intrinsic-dimensional clipping of estimated\ngradients. We evaluate ZIP on 13+ vision-language tasks in standard benchmarks\nand show that it achieves an average improvement of approximately 6% in\nfew-shot accuracy and 48% in query efficiency compared to the best-performing\nalternative BBPT methods, establishing a new state of the art. Our ablation\nanalysis further shows that the proposed clipping mechanism is robust and\nnearly optimal, without the need to manually select the clipping threshold,\nmatching the result of expensive hyperparameter search.",

With the goal of providing an assistive tool, we developed an\nautomated pipeline for predicting fetal orientation from ultrasound videos\nacquired following a simple blind sweep protocol. Leveraging on a pre-trained\nhead detection and segmentation model, this is achieved by first determining\nthe fetal presentation (cephalic or breech) with a template matching approach,\nfollowed by the fetal lie (facing left or right) by analyzing the spatial\ndistribution of segmented brain anatomies. Evaluation on a dataset of\nthird-trimester ultrasound scans demonstrated the promising accuracy of our\npipeline.

A novel approach, Adaptive locally linear\nembedding(ALLE), is introduced to address this limitation by incorporating a\ndynamic, data-driven metric that enhances topological preservation. This method\nredefines the concept of proximity by focusing on topological neighborhood\ninclusion rather than fixed distances.

Our calculations primarily\nfocus on obtaining the masses of the first three resonances, that is, the\nground state (1S), the first orbital excited state (1P), and the first radial\nexcited state (2S), for the mentioned baryons. We additionally determine the\nresidues of these baryons, which serve as key parameters for studying their\npossible decay channels and interactions with other particles. To achieve\nhigher accuracy compared to previous studies, we consider nonperturbative\noperators up to eight mass dimensions. We present our calculated outcomes in\ntwo distinct energy schemes, referred to as pole and $\\mathrm{\\overline{MS}}$.\nGiven the absence of experimental data for these states, we compare our results\nwith previous theoretical calculations that are reported in relevant studies\nemploying various approaches. These results may provide valuable insights for\nexperimental groups searching for the triply heavy baryons.",

To tackle these tasks, agents can bootstrap themselves by\nlearning task-specific skills online through interaction with the web\nenvironment. In this work, we demonstrate that programs are an effective\nrepresentation for skills. We propose agent skill induction (ASI), which allows\nagents to adapt themselves by inducing, verifying, and utilizing program-based\nskills on the fly. We start with an evaluation on the WebArena agent benchmark\nand show that ASI outperforms the static baseline agent and its text-skill\ncounterpart by 23.5% and 11.3% in success rate, mainly thanks to the\nprogrammatic verification guarantee during the induction phase. ASI also\nimproves efficiency by reducing 10.7-15.3% of the steps over baselines, by\ncomposing primitive actions (e.g., click) into higher-level skills (e.g.,\nsearch product). We then highlight the efficacy of ASI in remaining efficient\nand accurate under scaled-up web activities. Finally, we examine the\ngeneralizability of induced skills when transferring between websites, and find\nthat ASI can effectively reuse common skills, while also updating incompatible\nskills to versatile website changes.",

    "abstract": "We propose a framework which generalizes \"decision making with structured\nobservations\" by allowing robust (i.e. multivalued) models. In this framework,\neach model associates each decision with a convex set of probability\ndistributions over outcomes. Nature can choose distributions out of this set in\nan arbitrary (adversarial) manner, that can be nonoblivious and depend on past\nhistory. The resulting framework offers much greater generality than classical\nbandits and reinforcement learning, since the realizability assumption becomes\nmuch weaker and more realistic. We then derive a theory of regret bounds for\nthis framework. Although our lower and upper bounds are not tight, they are\nsufficient to fully characterize power-law learnability. We demonstrate this\ntheory in two special cases: robust linear bandits and tabular robust online\nreinforcement learning. In both cases, we derive regret bounds that improve\nstate-of-the-art (except that we do not address computational efficiency).",

This Koopman model predicts the overall economic\noperational cost and key system outputs, based on accessible partial state\nmeasurements. By leveraging this learned model, a constrained economic\npredictive control scheme is developed. Despite time-varying parameters\ninvolved in the formulated model, the formulated optimization problem\nassociated with the economic predictive control design is convex, and it can be\nsolved efficiently during online control implementations.

Methods apply it to relighting by separating radiance into BRDF\nparameters and lighting, yet produce inferior relighting quality with artifacts\nand unnatural indirect illumination due to the limited capability of each\nGaussian, which has constant material parameters and normal, alongside the\nabsence of physical constraints for indirect lighting. In this paper, we\npresent a novel framework called Spatially-vayring Gaussian Inverse Rendering\n(SVG-IR), aimed at enhancing both NVS and relighting quality. To this end, we\npropose a new representation-Spatially-varying Gaussian (SVG)-that allows\nper-Gaussian spatially varying parameters.

    "abstract": "The use of amyloid-beta (A$\\beta$) clearance to support regulatory approvals\nof drugs in Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains controversial. We evaluate\nA$\\beta$ as a potential trial-level surrogate endpoint for clinical function in\nAD using a meta-analysis. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) reporting data on\nthe effectiveness of anti- A$\\beta$ monoclonal antibodies (MABs) on A$\\beta$\nand clinical outcomes were identified through a literature review. A Bayesian\nbivariate meta-analysis was used to evaluate surrogate relationships between\nthe treatment effects on A$\\beta$ and clinical function, with the intercept,\nslope and variance quantifying the trial level association. The analysis was\nperformed using RCT data both collectively across all MABs and separately for\neach MAB through subgroup analysis. The latter analysis was extended by\napplying Bayesian hierarchical models to borrow information across treatments.\nWe identified 23 RCTs with 39 treatment contrasts for seven MABs. The\nassociation between treatment effects on A$\\beta$ and Clinical Dementia Rating\n- Sum of Boxes (CDR-SOB) across all MABs was strong: with intercept of -0.03\n(95% credible intervals: -0.16, 0.11), slope of 1.41 (0.60, 2.21) and variance\nof 0.02 (0.00, 0.05). For individual treatments, the surrogate relationships\nwere suboptimal, displaying large uncertainty. The use of hierarchical models\nconsiderably reduced the uncertainty around key parameters, narrowing the\nintervals for the slopes by an average of 71% (range: 51%-95%) and for the\nvariances by 28% (7%-65%). Our results suggest that A$\\beta$ is a potential\nsurrogate endpoint for CDR-SOB when assuming a common surrogate relationship\nacross all MABs. When allowing for information-sharing, the surrogate\nrelationships improved, but only for lecanemab and aducanumab was the\nimprovement sufficient to support a surrogate relationship.",

Our investigations reveal that these costs primarily stem\nfrom the \\emph{static} inference paradigm, which inevitably introduces\nredundant computation in certain \\emph{diffusion timesteps} and \\emph{spatial\nregions}. To overcome this inefficiency, we propose \\textbf{Dy}namic\n\\textbf{Di}ffusion \\textbf{T}ransformer (DyDiT), an architecture that\n\\emph{dynamically} adjusts its computation along both \\emph{timestep} and\n\\emph{spatial} dimensions. Specifically, we introduce a \\emph{Timestep-wise\nDynamic Width} (TDW) approach that adapts model width conditioned on the\ngeneration timesteps. In addition, we design a \\emph{Spatial-wise Dynamic\nToken} (SDT) strategy to avoid redundant computation at unnecessary spatial\nlocations. TDW and SDT can be seamlessly integrated into DiT and significantly\naccelerates the generation process. Building on these designs, we further\nenhance DyDiT in three key aspects. First, DyDiT is integrated seamlessly with\nflow matching-based generation, enhancing its versatility. Furthermore, we\nenhance DyDiT to tackle more complex visual generation tasks, including video\ngeneration and text-to-image generation, thereby broadening its real-world\napplications. Finally, to address the high cost of full fine-tuning and\ndemocratize technology access, we investigate the feasibility of training DyDiT\nin a parameter-efficient manner and introduce timestep-based dynamic LoRA\n(TD-LoRA).

We aim to utilize high-angular resolution molecular line data from ALMA\nto identify hot cores, with a particular focus on weak-emission candidates, and\nto provide one of the largest samples of hot core candidates. We propose to use\nspectral stacking and imaging techniques of complex organic molecules (COMs) in\nthe ALMA-ATOMS survey, including line identification & weights, segmentation of\nline datacubes, resampling, stacking and normalization, moment 0 maps, and data\nanalysis, to search for hot core candidates. We classify cores with dense\nemission of CH3OH and at least one molecule from the other six molecules as hot\ncore candidates. In addition to the existing sample of 60 strong hot cores from\nthe ALMA-ATOMS survey, we have detected 40 new weak candidates through\nstacking. All hot core candidates display compact emission from at least one of\nthe other six COM species. For the strong sample, the stacking method provides\nmolecular column density estimates that are consistent with previous fitting\nresults. For the newly identified weak candidates, all species except CH3CHO\nshow compact emission in the stacked image, which cannot be fully resolved\nspatially. These weak candidates exhibit column densities of COMs that are\napproximately one order of magnitude lower than those of the strong sample. The\nentire hot core sample, including the weak candidates, reveals tight\ncorrelations between the compact emission of CH3OH and other COM species,\nsuggesting they may share a similar chemical environment for COMs, with CH3OH\npotentially acting as a precursor for other COMs. The molecular line stacking\ntechnique is used to identify hot core candidates in this work, leading to the\nidentification of 40 new hot core candidates.",

Typically, such evaluation is performed through perturbation,\nwherein high- or low-relevance regions of the input image are manipulated to\nexamine the change in prediction. In this work, we introduce a novel approach,\nwhich harnesses image generation models to perform targeted perturbation.\nSpecifically, we focus on inpainting only the high-relevance pixels of an input\nimage to modify the model's predictions while preserving image fidelity.

    "abstract": "Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models achieve a favorable trade-off between\nperformance and inference efficiency by activating only a subset of experts.\nHowever, the memory overhead of storing all experts remains a major limitation,\nespecially in large-scale MoE models such as DeepSeek-R1(671B). In this study,\nwe investigate domain specialization and expert redundancy in large-scale MoE\nmodels and uncover a consistent behavior we term few-shot expert localization,\nwith only a few in-domain demonstrations, the model consistently activates a\nsparse and stable subset of experts on tasks within the same domain. Building\non this observation, we propose a simple yet effective pruning framework,\nEASY-EP, that leverages a few domain-specific demonstrations to identify and\nretain only the most relevant experts. EASY-EP comprises two key components:\noutput-aware expert importance assessment and expert-level token contribution\nestimation. The former evaluates the importance of each expert for the current\ntoken by considering the gating scores and L2 norm of the outputs of activated\nexperts, while the latter assesses the contribution of tokens based on\nrepresentation similarities before and after routed experts. Experiments on\nDeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-V3-0324 show that our method can achieve comparable\nperformances and $2.99\\times$ throughput under the same memory budget with full\nmodel with only half the experts.",

    "abstract": "The environmental impact of aviation has been a focus of significant research\nfor several decades. While there is a broad consensus among stakeholders on\nreducing carbon emissions, leading to efforts to improve route efficiency in\nair traffic management, the impact of non-carbon emissions like contrails has\nsparked a different debate. Some organizations have already moved to\npre-operational trials for contrail avoidance through flight re-routing, with\nrecent industry projects fast-tracking these operational strategies.\n  This paper addresses the practical challenges of implementing contrail-aware\nrouting. Building on our previous research, which enables the generation of\nwind-optimal 4D trajectories using grid-like cost functions, we utilize the TOP\ntool and the OpenAP aircraft performance model to analyze the trade-offs\nbetween fuel consumption and contrail avoidance. We also examine the impact of\nweather forecast uncertainty on contrail mitigation, the effects on airspace\ncapacity and network operations, and the implications for aviation regulatory\nframeworks.\n  To investigate these challenges, we reconstructed a dataset from OpenSky\ndata, encompassing all flight trajectories over Europe on a day with\nsignificant contrail potential. Our data-driven analysis highlights the\npotential difficulties in implementing contrail-optimal routing in practice,\nparticularly concerning uncertainties in weather forecasts, impacts on airspace\ncapacity, and questions of responsibility for optimal routing.\n  Overall, we argue that contrail-optimal routing should be approached with\ncaution, as its implementation may not be as straightforward as some\nstakeholders suggest.",

This study introduces the FARSI approach\n(Fast, Accessible, Reliable, Secure, Informative) as a framework to enhance the\ntranslation of intricate statistical findings into actionable insights for\npolicymakers and stakeholders. We apply this framework in a real-world case\nstudy on chronic disease monitoring in Italy.\n  Methods. The FARSI framework outlines key principles for developing\nuser-friendly tools that improve the translation of statistical results. We\napplied these principles to create an open-access web application using R\nShiny, designed to communicate chronic disease prevalence estimates from a\nBayesian spatio-temporal logistic model. The case study highlights the\nimportance of an intuitive design for fast accessibility, validated data and\nexpert feedback for reliability, aggregated data for security, and insights\ninto prevalence population subgroups, which were previously unobservable, for\ninformativeness.\n  Results. The web application enables stakeholders to explore disease\nprevalence across populations and geographical area through dynamic\nvisualizations. It facilitates public health monitoring by, for instance,\nidentifying disparities at the local level and assessing risk factors such as\nsmoking. Its user-friendly interface enhances accessibility, making statistical\nfindings more actionable. Conclusions.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a new evaluation metric called Domain Independence\n(DI) and Attenuation of Domain-Specific Information (ADSI) which is\nspecifically designed for domain-generalized semantic segmentation in\nautomotive images. DI measures the presence of domain-specific information: a\nlower DI value indicates strong domain dependence, while a higher DI value\nsuggests greater domain independence. This makes it roughly where\ndomain-specific information exists and up to which frequency range it is\npresent. As a result, it becomes possible to effectively suppress only the\nregions in the image that contain domain-specific information, enabling feature\nextraction independent of the domain. ADSI uses a Butterworth filter to remove\nthe low-frequency components of images that contain inherent domain-specific\ninformation such as sensor characteristics and lighting conditions. However,\nsince low-frequency components also contain important information such as\ncolor, we should not remove them completely. Thus, a scalar value (ranging from\n0 to 1) is multiplied by the low-frequency components to retain essential\ninformation. This helps the model learn more domain-independent features. In\nexperiments, GTA5 (synthetic dataset) was used as training images, and a\nreal-world dataset was used for evaluation, and the proposed method\noutperformed conventional approaches. Similarly, in experiments that the\nCityscapes (real-world dataset) was used for training and various environment\ndatasets such as rain and nighttime were used for evaluation, the proposed\nmethod demonstrated its robustness under nighttime conditions.",

We then\nstudy how galaxy assembly bias emerges from the interplay of halo assembly bias\n-- the dependence of halo clustering on properties other than mass -- and\noccupancy variation -- the correlation between galaxy occupation and secondary\nhalo properties -- and provide an analytical expression that predicts the\namount of galaxy assembly bias caused by any halo property. This expression\nfacilitates understanding the dependence of galaxy assembly bias on halo\nproperties and enables the straightforward incorporation of this effect into\nhalo model approaches.",

    "abstract": "Over the past few decades, many works have studied the evolutionary dynamics\nof continuous games. However, previous works have primarily focused on\ntwo-player games with pairwise interactions. Indeed, group interactions rather\nthan pairwise interactions are usually found in real situations. The public\ngoods game serves as a paradigm of multi-player interactions. Notably, various\ntypes of benefit functions are typically considered in public goods games,\nincluding linear, saturating, and sigmoid functions. Thus far, the evolutionary\ndynamics of cooperation in continuous public goods games with these benefit\nfunctions remain unknown in structured populations. In this paper, we consider\nthe continuous public goods game in structured populations. By employing the\npair approximation approach, we derive the analytical expressions for invasion\nfitness. Furthermore, we explore the adaptive dynamics of cooperative\ninvestments in the game with various benefit functions. First, for the linear\npublic goods game, we find that there is no singular strategy, and the\ncooperative investments evolve to either the maximum or minimum depending on\nthe benefit-to-cost ratio. Subsequently, we examine the game with saturating\nbenefit functions and demonstrate the potential existence of an evolutionarily\nstable strategy (ESS). Additionally, for the game with the sigmoid benefit\nfunction, we observe that the evolutionary outcomes are closely related to the\nthreshold value. When the threshold is small, a unique ESS emerges. For\nintermediate threshold values, both the ESS and repellor singular strategies\ncan coexist. When the threshold value is large, a unique repellor displays.\nFinally, we perform individual-based simulations to validate our theoretical\nresults.",

In this paper, we propose a novel ``FedMerge'' approach that can\ncreate a personalized model per client by simply merging multiple global models\nwith automatically optimized and customized weights. In FedMerge, a few global\nmodels can serve many non-IID clients, even without further local finetuning.\nWe formulate this problem as a joint optimization of global models and the\nmerging weights for each client. Unlike existing FL approaches where the server\nbroadcasts one or multiple global models to all clients, the server only needs\nto send a customized, merged model to each client. Moreover, instead of\nperiodically interrupting the local training and re-initializing it to a global\nmodel, the merged model aligns better with each client's task and data\ndistribution, smoothening the local-global gap between consecutive rounds\ncaused by client drift. We evaluate FedMerge on three different non-IID\nsettings applied to different domains with diverse tasks and data types, in\nwhich FedMerge consistently outperforms existing FL approaches, including\nclustering-based and mixture-of-experts (MoE) based methods.",

    "abstract": "Neural representations for video (NeRV) have gained considerable attention\nfor their strong performance across various video tasks. However, existing NeRV\nmethods often struggle to capture fine spatial details, resulting in vague\nreconstructions. In this paper, we present a Frequency Separation and\nAugmentation based Neural Representation for video (FANeRV), which addresses\nthese limitations with its core Wavelet Frequency Upgrade Block. This block\nexplicitly separates input frames into high and low-frequency components using\ndiscrete wavelet transform, followed by targeted enhancement using specialized\nmodules. Finally, a specially designed gated network effectively fuses these\nfrequency components for optimal reconstruction. Additionally, convolutional\nresidual enhancement blocks are integrated into the later stages of the network\nto balance parameter distribution and improve the restoration of high-frequency\ndetails. Experimental results demonstrate that FANeRV significantly improves\nreconstruction performance and excels in multiple tasks, including video\ncompression, inpainting, and interpolation, outperforming existing NeRV\nmethods.",

In this work, we address the problem of\nmulti-object orientation control in text-to-image diffusion models. This\nenables the generation of diverse multi-object scenes with precise orientation\ncontrol for each object. The key idea is to condition the diffusion model with\na set of orientation-aware \\textbf{compass} tokens, one for each object, along\nwith text tokens. A light-weight encoder network predicts these compass tokens\ntaking object orientation as the input. The model is trained on a synthetic\ndataset of procedurally generated scenes, each containing one or two 3D assets\non a plain background. However, direct training this framework results in poor\norientation control as well as leads to entanglement among objects. To mitigate\nthis, we intervene in the generation process and constrain the cross-attention\nmaps of each compass token to its corresponding object regions. The trained\nmodel is able to achieve precise orientation control for a) complex objects not\nseen during training and b) multi-object scenes with more than two objects,\nindicating strong generalization capabilities. Further, when combined with\npersonalization methods, our method precisely controls the orientation of the\nnew object in diverse contexts.

Both methods achieve accurate\n8-bit on-chip inference, closely approximating 32-bit floating-point\nperformance.

Our proposed\nsolution leverages a large-scale multi-dataset supervised pretraining approach\ninspired by the MultiTalent method. We train a Resenc L network on a\ncomprehensive collection of datasets covering various anatomical and\npathological structures, which equips the model with a robust understanding of\nbrain anatomy and pathology. Following this, the model is fine-tuned on\nmsTBI-specific data to optimize its performance for the unique characteristics\nof T1-weighted MRI scans and outperforms the baseline without pretraining up to\n2 Dice points.",

Attention sink occurs when an excessive amount of\nattention is allocated to the [CLS] token, distorting the model's ability to\neffectively process image patches. To address this, we introduce a\nlayer-aligned encoder-decoder architecture, where the encoder utilizes\nself-attention to process image patches, while the decoder uses cross-attention\nto focus on the [CLS] token. Unlike traditional encoder-decoder framework,\nwhere the decoder depends solely on high-level encoder representations, EDIT\nallows the decoder to extract information starting from low-level features,\nprogressively refining the representation layer by layer. EDIT is naturally\ninterpretable demonstrated through sequential attention maps, illustrating the\nrefined, layer-by-layer focus on key image features. Experiments on ImageNet-1k\nand ImageNet-21k, along with transfer learning tasks, show that EDIT achieves\nconsistent performance improvements over DeiT3 models.

It is expected that these states are related to\nMajorana bound states (MBSs) in longer chains and that the tunable nature of\nthis setup makes it a promising platform to study MBSs. However, realistic\nsystems can only host highly, but not perfectly, localized near-zero-energy\nstates, called imperfect PMMs. It has been shown that these imperfect PMMs can\nevolve into trivial states unrelated to MBSs when the chain is extended. Such\nstates are called false PMMs, whereas PMMs that evolve into MBSs in long chains\nare called true PMMs. Here, using a microscopic model of QD-superconductor\narrays, we consider properties of false PMMs and the circumstances under which\nthey appear. In two-site systems, we find that the origin of many false PMMs\ncan be related to zero-energy states occurring in the absence of\nsuperconductivity and we use this analytic understanding to characterize the\nfalse PMMs that are typical for different regions of parameter space. In\nthree-site systems, we show that false PMMs can occur via the same mechanism as\nfor two-site systems, but we also find them in regions of parameter space where\nthey are not predicted to exist, thus hinting that the physics of false PMMs\ncan be richer in longer chains. Finally, we demonstrate that the PMMs most\nstable to perturbations in chemical potential and with the largest excitation\ngaps appear in a region of parameter space that also has a large ratio of false\nto true PMMs.",

Since outdoor environments represent the primary application\nscenario for mobile communications, this paper presents the first comprehensive\nreview and summary of multi-scenario and multi-frequency channel\ncharacteristics based on extensive outdoor new mid-band channel measurement\ndata, including UMa, UMi, and O2I. Specifically, a survey of the progress of\nthe channel characteristics is presented, such as path loss, delay spread,\nangular spread, channel sparsity, capacity and near-field spatial\nnon-stationary characteristics. Then, considering that satellite communication\nwill be an important component of future communication systems, we examine the\nimpact of clutter loss in air-ground communications. Our analysis of the\nfrequency dependence of mid-band clutter loss suggests that its impact is not\nsignificant. Additionally, given that penetration loss is frequency-dependent,\nwe summarize its variation within the FR3 band. Based on experimental results,\ncomparisons with the standard model reveal that while the 3GPP TR 38.901 model\nremains a useful reference for penetration loss in wood and glass, it shows\nsignificant deviations for concrete and glass, indicating the need for further\nrefinement. In summary, the findings of this survey provide both empirical data\nand theoretical support for the deployment of mid-band in future communication\nsystems, as well as guidance for optimizing mid-band base station deployment in\nthe outdoor environment.

    "abstract": "Predicting competitive outcomes typically requires fitting dynamical models\nto data, from which interaction strengths and coexistence indicators such as\ninvasion criteria can be produced. Methods that allow to propagate parameter\nuncertainty are particularly indicated. These should ideally allow for\ncompetition between and within species at various life-stages, and make the\nbest out of multiple data sources, each of which can be relatively scarce by\nstatistical standards. Here, we embed a mathematical model of stage-structured\ncompetition between two species, producing analytical invasion criteria, into a\ntwo-species Integrated Population Model. The community-level IPM allows to\ncombine counts, capture-recapture, and fecundity data into a single statistical\nframework, and the Bayesian formulation of the IPM fully propagates parameter\nuncertainty into invasion criteria. Model fitting demonstrates that we can\ncorrectly predict coexistence through reciprocal invasion when present, but\nthat interaction strengths are not always estimable, depending on the prior\nchosen. Our competitive exclusion scenario is shown to be harder to identify,\nalthough our model allows to at least flag this scenario as uncertain rather\nthan mistakenly present it as coexistence. Our results confirm the importance\nof accounting for uncertainty in the prediction of competitive outcomes.",

However, the discovery of a metal-rich subpopulation in the\nGalactic disc, kinematically colder and more rotationally supported, challenges\nthis classical view. Understanding the age of these metal-rich RR Lyrae stars\nis crucial for constraining their formation pathways and assessing what\nGalactic populations they are tracing. In this work, we leverage the\nunprecedented astrometric precision of Gaia DR3 to infer the age distribution\nof metal-rich RR Lyrae stars through a kinematic comparison with O-rich Mira\nvariables. Mira variables, with their well-established period-age relation,\nserve as a natural clock, allowing us to transfer age information to RR Lyrae\nstars via their phase-space properties. By applying this approach across\ndifferent metallicity bins, we find that the most metal-rich RR Lyrae stars\n($[\\rm Fe/H] > -0.5$) exhibit kinematics consistent with a population\nsignificantly younger ($\\approx 6-7$ Gyr) than typically assumed for RR Lyrae\nstars. In contrast, those with $-1 < [\\rm Fe/H] < -0.5$ show properties more\naligned with older ($\\approx 9-11$ Gyr) populations. Interestingly, we also\nfind evidence of a possible double age populations for the most metal-rich RR\nLyrae, one younger with ages between 3 and 6 Gyr, and another one older ranging\nfrom 8 to 11 Gyr. These results provide strong evidence that metal-rich RR\nLyrae stars in the Galactic field do not exclusively trace ancient populations.\nThis finding challenges the current model of RR Lyrae formation and supports\nalternative formation scenarios, such as binary evolution.",

This paper addresses this\nshortcoming by proposing a robust evaluation protocol specifically designed to\nassess the quality of self-supervised features for 3D scene understanding. Our\nprotocol uses multi-resolution feature sampling of hierarchical models to\ncreate rich point-level representations that capture the semantic capabilities\nof the model and, hence, are suitable for evaluation with linear probing and\nnearest-neighbor methods. Furthermore, we introduce the first self-supervised\nmodel that performs similarly to supervised models when only off-the-shelf\nfeatures are used in a linear probing setup. In particular, our model is\ntrained natively in 3D with a novel self-supervised approach based on a Masked\nScene Modeling objective, which reconstructs deep features of masked patches in\na bottom-up manner and is specifically tailored to hierarchical 3D models. Our\nexperiments not only demonstrate that our method achieves competitive\nperformance to supervised models, but also surpasses existing self-supervised\napproaches by a large margin.

Unifying both tasks in a\nshared model is promising since it can enhance user modeling and item\nunderstanding. Previous approaches mainly follow a discriminative paradigm,\nutilizing shared encoders to process input features and task-specific heads to\nperform each task. However, this paradigm encounters two key challenges:\ngradient conflict and manual design complexity. From the information theory\nperspective, these challenges potentially both stem from the same issue -- low\nmutual information between the input features and task-specific outputs during\nthe optimization process.\n  To tackle these issues, we propose GenSR, a novel generative paradigm for\nunifying search and recommendation (S&R), which leverages task-specific prompts\nto partition the model's parameter space into subspaces, thereby enhancing\nmutual information. To construct effective subspaces for each task, GenSR first\nprepares informative representations for each subspace and then optimizes both\nsubspaces in one unified model. Specifically, GenSR consists of two main\nmodules: (1) Dual Representation Learning, which independently models\ncollaborative and semantic historical information to derive expressive item\nrepresentations; and (2) S&R Task Unifying, which utilizes contrastive learning\ntogether with instruction tuning to generate task-specific outputs effectively.\nExtensive experiments on two public datasets show GenSR outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods across S&R tasks.

G31 is one of\nthe few sources showing a clear hourglass morphology of the magnetic field on\nscales between 1000 au and a few 100 au in previous interferometric\nobservations.

By performing the displacement and squeezing\ntransformations, the system can be reduced to a standard linearized\noptomechanical system with normalized driving detuning and linearized-coupling\nstrength, in which the optical and mechanical modes are, respectively, coupled\nto an optical vacuum bath and a mechanical heat bath. We focus on the\nentanglement generation in the single stable regime of the system.

In addition, the Kerr nonlinearity can extend the stable region,\nenabling considerable entanglement generation in the blue sideband-parameter\nregion. We also investigate the dependence of the entanglement generation on\nthe average thermal phonon occupation of the mechanical bath and the optical\ndriving amplitude. It is found that the presence of the Kerr nonlinearity\nallows the generation of optomechanical entanglement even when the thermal\nphonon occupation of the mechanical bath is as high as 3000.

    "abstract": "Direct numerical simulations of a uniform flow past a fixed spherical droplet\nare performed to investigate the parameter range within which the axisymmetric\nflow becomes unstable due to an external flow bifurcation. The hydrodynamics is\ngoverned by three dimensionless numbers: the viscosity ratio, $\\mu^\\ast$, and\nthe external and internal Reynolds numbers, $\\Rey^e$ and $\\Rey^i$,\nrespectively. The drop-to-fluid density ratio is related to these parameters as\n$\\rho^\\ast=\\mu^\\ast \\Rey^i/\\Rey^e$. This study focuses on highly viscous\ndroplets with $\\mu^\\ast \\geq 5$, where wake instability is driven by the\nvorticity flux transferred from the droplet surface into the surrounding fluid.\nBy analysing the wake structure, we confirm that the onset of the external\nbifurcation is linked to the tilting of the azimuthal vorticity, $\\omega_\\phi$,\nin the wake and that the bifurcation occurs once the isocontours of\n$\\omega_\\phi$ align nearly perpendicular to the symmetry axis. We propose an\nempirical criterion for predicting the onset of the external bifurcation,\nformulated in terms of the maximum vorticity on the external side of the\ndroplet surface. This criterion is applicable for sufficiently high $\\Rey^i$\nand holds over a wide range of $\\mu^\\ast$ and $\\Rey^e$. Additionally, we\nexamine the bifurcation sequence for two specific external Reynolds numbers,\n$\\Rey^e=300$ and $\\Rey^e=500$, and show that, beyond a critical viscosity\nratio, the axisymmetric wake first transitions to a steady planar-symmetric\nstate before undergoing a secondary Hopf bifurcation. Finally, we highlight the\ninfluence of $\\Rey^i$ on external bifurcation and show that, at moderate\n$\\Rey^i$, wake instability may set in at a lower vorticity threshold than\npredicted by our criterion. These findings provide new insights into the\nexternal flow bifurcation of viscous droplets.",

Most practical implementations for detecting these races use\ntimestamps to infer causality between events and detect races based on these\ntimestamps. Such an algorithm updates timestamps (stored in vector clocks) at\nevery event in the execution, and is known to induce excessive overhead. Random\nsampling has emerged as a promising algorithmic paradigm to offset this\noverhead. It offers the promise of making sound race detection scalable. In\nthis work we consider the task of designing an efficient sampling based race\ndetector with low overhead for timestamping when the number of sampled events\nis much smaller than the total events in an execution. To solve this problem,\nwe propose (1) a new notion of freshness timestamp, (2) a new data structure to\nstore timestamps, and (3) an algorithm that uses a combination of them to\nreduce the cost of timestamping in sampling based race detection. Further, we\nprove that our algorithm is close to optimal -- the number of vector clock\ntraversals is bounded by the number of sampled events and number of threads,\nand further, on any given dynamic execution, the cost of timestamping due to\nour algorithm is close to the amount of work any timestamping-based algorithm\nmust perform on that execution, that is it is instance optimal.

As\npre-trained prompts become valuable assets, combining multiple source prompts\noffers a promising approach to enhance generalization for new tasks by\nleveraging complementary knowledge.

To address this, we propose HGPrompt, a dynamic framework that learns\noptimal ensemble weights. These weights are optimized by jointly maximizing an\ninformation-theoretic metric for transferability and minimizing gradient\nconflicts via a novel regularization strategy.

Experimental results reveal that the\nproposed method significantly outperforms traditional RL algorithms in safety,\nefficiency, and comfort. Specifically, it reduces the collision rate by up to\n92.17%, while the safety model accounts for merely 27% of the main model's\nparameters.",

While work at the intersection of NLP and cybersecurity has the\npotential to create safer NLP for all, accidental oversights can result in\ntangible harm (e.g., breaches of privacy or proliferation of malicious models).\nIn this emerging field, however, the research ethics of NLP have not yet faced\nmany of the long-standing conundrums pertinent to cybersecurity, until now.

    "abstract": "A novel fertility model based on Thom's nonlinear differential equations of\nmorphogenesis is presented, utilizing a three-dimensional catastrophe surface\nto capture the interaction between latent non-catastrophic fertility factors\nand catastrophic shocks. The model incorporates key socioeconomic and\nenvironmental variables and is applicable at macro-, meso-, and\nmicro-demographic levels, addressing global fertility declines, regional\npopulation disparities, and micro-level phenomena such as teenage pregnancies.\nThis approach enables a comprehensive analysis of reproductive health at\naggregate, sub-national, and age-group-specific levels. An agent-based model\nfor teenage pregnancy is described to illustrate how latent factors -- such as\neducation, contraceptive use, and parental guidance -- interact with\ncatastrophic shocks like socioeconomic deprivation, violence, and substance\nabuse. The bifurcation set analysis shows how minor shifts in socioeconomic\nconditions can lead to significant changes in fertility rates, revealing\ncritical points in fertility transitions. By integrating Thom's morphogenesis\nequations with traditional fertility theory, this paper proposes a\ngroundbreaking approach to understanding fertility dynamics, offering valuable\ninsights for the development of public health policies that address both stable\nfertility patterns and abrupt demographic shifts.",

To generate long-form, high-quality\ncaptions, many recent studies have employed multimodal large language models\n(MLLMs). However, current MLLMs often produce captions that lack fine-grained\ndetails or suffer from hallucinations, a challenge that persists in both\nopen-source and closed-source models. Inspired by Feature-Integration theory,\nwhich suggests that attention must focus on specific regions to integrate\nvisual information effectively, we propose a \\textbf{divide-then-aggregate}\nstrategy. Our method first divides the image into semantic and spatial patches\nto extract fine-grained details, enhancing the model's local perception of the\nimage. These local details are then hierarchically aggregated to generate a\ncomprehensive global description. To address hallucinations and inconsistencies\nin the generated captions, we apply a semantic-level filtering process during\nhierarchical aggregation.

    "abstract": "The quantum dots (QD) interface in solution can play significant roles in\nelectron transfer dynamics for quantum dots-sensitized solar cells and\ndifferent biological, environmental, and industrial systems. Here, we predict\nan avenue to identify the contribution of the quantum dots interface created\nstatic electric field on the nonlinear optical response (NLO) due to four-wave\nmixing (FWM), especially for the nanoparticles where surface contribution is\nhigh. We implement a way to disentangle the FWM response in QDs originating\nfrom the three incoming oscillating laser fields (NLOoscillating) and a\ncontribution (NLOstatic) arising from the three oscillating laser fields and\nthe static electric field caused by the interface. Advanced two-dimensional\nelectronic spectroscopy (2DES) employs phase-resolved heterodyne techniques\nwhere FWM response is measured in a particular phase-matched direction, and the\nresponse is distinctively phase sensitive. Theoretical analysis shows\nalteration in the interface can introduce phase variation in the NLOstatic\nsignal, resulting in a distinct change in the 2D-spectra. Our studies establish\na range of ionic strength, which can be important to untwine the usual NLO\nsignal (NLOoscillating) from the NLO (NLOstatic) contributed by the interface\nof quantum dots. This analysis may open up the possibility to study the\ndifferent kinds of dynamics occurring specifically in the interface and also\nwill pave the path towards different ion interactions through phase change in\n2D spectra, and enormous scope will be employing deep learning-assisted phase\nrecognition.",

Using relativistic atomic structure methods, we computed DR rate\ncoefficients under conditions typical of these environments.

The DR resonance features were identified by comparing theoretical\nresonance energies, estimated as the difference between NIST excitation\nenergies and Dirac binding energies, with dominant autoionizing states\nconfirmed through analysis of autoionization rates. Our results highlight the\ncritical role of low-lying DR resonances in shaping rate coefficients at\nkilonova temperatures ($\\sim 10^4$ K) and regulating charge-state\ndistributions. Pronounced near-threshold DR resonances significantly influence\nthe evolving ionization states and opacity of neutron star merger ejecta.\nComparisons with previous studies emphasize the necessity of including high-$n$\nRydberg states for accurate DR rate coefficients, especially for complex heavy\nions with dense energy levels.

    "abstract": "3D human pose lifting is a promising research area that leverages estimated\nand ground-truth 2D human pose data for training. While existing approaches\nprimarily aim to enhance the performance of estimated 2D poses, they often\nstruggle when applied to ground-truth 2D pose data. We observe that achieving\naccurate 3D pose reconstruction from ground-truth 2D poses requires precise\nmodeling of local pose structures, alongside the ability to extract robust\nglobal spatio-temporal features. To address these challenges, we propose a\nnovel Hyper-GCN and Shuffle Mamba (HGMamba) block, which processes input data\nthrough two parallel streams: Hyper-GCN and Shuffle-Mamba. The Hyper-GCN stream\nmodels the human body structure as hypergraphs with varying levels of\ngranularity to effectively capture local joint dependencies. Meanwhile, the\nShuffle Mamba stream leverages a state space model to perform spatio-temporal\nscanning across all joints, enabling the establishment of global dependencies.\nBy adaptively fusing these two representations, HGMamba achieves strong global\nfeature modeling while excelling at local structure modeling. We stack multiple\nHGMamba blocks to create three variants of our model, allowing users to select\nthe most suitable configuration based on the desired speed-accuracy trade-off.\nExtensive evaluations on the Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

First, our\nbehavior-semantic alignment module disentangles modality-agnostic behavioral\npatterns from noisy modality-specific features through contrastive codebook\nlearning, ensuring semantic IDs are inherently tied to recommendation tasks.\nSecond, we design a discretized similarity reweighting mechanism that\ndynamically adjusts self-attention scores using quantized semantic\nrelationships, preserving multi-modal synergies while avoiding invasive\nmodifications to the sequence modeling architecture.

To this end, we introduce Image Restoration Transformer Tailored Layer\nNormalization~(i-LN), a surprisingly simple drop-in replacement for\nconventional LayerNorm. We propose to normalize features in a holistic manner\nacross the entire spatio-channel dimension, preserving spatial relationships\namong individual tokens. Additionally, we introduce an input-adaptive rescaling\nstrategy that maintains the feature range flexibility required by individual\ninputs. Together, these modifications effectively contribute to preserving\nlow-level feature statistics of inputs throughout IR Transformers. Experimental\nresults verify that this combined strategy enhances both the stability and\nperformance of IR Transformers across various IR tasks.",

Employing the\nprobability flow equivalence technique, we rigorously derive an entropy\nproduction decomposition formula and demonstrate that the entropy production,\n$\\Delta s_\\mathrm{tot}$, satisfies the integral fluctuation theorem $\\langle\n\\exp[ -\\Delta s_\\mathrm{tot} + B_\\mathrm{act}] \\rangle = 1$ and the generalized\nsecond law of thermodynamics $\\langle \\Delta s_\\mathrm{tot}\\rangle \\geq\\langle\nB_\\mathrm{act}\\rangle$, where $B_\\mathrm{act}$ is a path-dependent random\nvariable associated with the active fluctuations. Our result holds generally\nfor arbitrary initial conditions, encompassing both steady-state and transient\nfinite-time regimes. In the limiting case where active fluctuations are absent\n(i.e., $B_\\mathrm{act} \\equiv 0$), the theorem reduces to the well-established\nresults in stochastic thermodynamics. Building on the theoretical foundation,\nwe propose a deep learning-based methodology to efficiently compute the entropy\nproduction, utilizing the L\\'{e}vy score function we proposed. To illustrate\nthe validity of this approach, we apply it to two representative systems: a\nBrownian particle in a periodic active bath and an active polymer system\nconsisting of an active Brownian particle cross-linker interacting with passive\nBrownian beads. Our results provide a unified framework for analyzing entropy\nproduction in active matter systems while offering practical computational\ntools for investigating complex nonequilibrium behaviors.",

To achieve this, we\nintroduce a custom regression-by-classification loss function that combines the\ncross-entropy and Wasserstein losses, and demonstrate that it outperforms both\ndirect regression and prior binary classification. FACT successfully classifies\npoint-cloud pairs registered with both the classical ICP and GeoTransformer,\nwhile other choices, such as standard point-cloud-quality metrics and\nregistration residuals are shown to be poor choices for predicting\nmisalignment.

While the deformation of the spokes in this `hub-and-spoke'\nkirigami are approximately cylindrical (i.e.~zero Gaussian curvature and hence\nsmall elastic strain), this is not the case in the central hub. The central hub\nis deformed radially because of continuity with the spokes but, because of its\nown circular symmetry, it must develop Gaussian curvature, and hence strain.

However, their safety\nimplications remain underexplored. While prior work has exposed critical\nvulnerabilities in unimodal reasoning models, MLRMs introduce distinct risks\nfrom cross-modal reasoning pathways. This work presents the first systematic\nsafety analysis of MLRMs through large-scale empirical studies comparing MLRMs\nwith their base MLLMs. Our experiments reveal three critical findings: (1) The\nReasoning Tax: Acquiring reasoning capabilities catastrophically degrades\ninherited safety alignment. MLRMs exhibit 37.44% higher jailbreaking success\nrates than base MLLMs under adversarial attacks. (2) Safety Blind Spots: While\nsafety degradation is pervasive, certain scenarios (e.g., Illegal Activity)\nsuffer 25 times higher attack rates -- far exceeding the average 3.4 times\nincrease, revealing scenario-specific vulnerabilities with alarming cross-model\nand datasets consistency. (3) Emergent Self-Correction: Despite tight\nreasoning-answer safety coupling, MLRMs demonstrate nascent self-correction --\n16.9% of jailbroken reasoning steps are overridden by safe answers, hinting at\nintrinsic safeguards. These findings underscore the urgency of scenario-aware\nsafety auditing and mechanisms to amplify MLRMs' self-correction potential. To\ncatalyze research, we open-source OpenSafeMLRM, the first toolkit for MLRM\nsafety evaluation, providing unified interface for mainstream models, datasets,\nand jailbreaking methods.

    "abstract": "As an interesting subclass of gamma-ray burst (GRB), Type IL GRB (such as GRB\n211211A and GRB 230307A) features a long-duration prompt emission but\noriginating from compact binary merger. The \"long duration\" emisison of Type IL\nGRB are dominately composed of the main burst, rather than the extended\nemission,differentiating them from the traditional \"long-short\" GRB (e.g., GRB\n060614). Previous study has reported several Type IL GRBs by visual inspection\nof their light curves. In this work, we established a detailed criterion to\nidentify Type IL GRBs by light curve, and then systematically searched the\narchival Fermi/GBM data with this criterion, resulting in a sample of 5 type IL\nGRBs from January 1, 2014 to January 1, 2024, i.e. GRB 230307A, GRB 211211A,\nGRB 200914A, GRB 200311A and GRB 170228A. Apart from the light curve pattern,\nwe find that the temporal and spectral properties of these 5 GRBs also support\nthis classification. Interestingly, we find that the energy ratio between\nextended emission and main emission is almost constant (~0.7, with small\nscattering) for these GRBs, which have strong implication on the mechanism of\nType IL burst. We discuss theoretical models to interpret the progenitor,\ncentral engine, and extended emission of these Type IL bursts.",

In contrast to most evaluation studies, which\ngenerally report $\\text{PM}_{2.5}$ levels below $150~\\mu\\text{g/m}^3$, our\nstudy observed hourly average $\\text{PM}_{2.5}$ concentrations ranging from\n$6-611~\\mu\\text{g/m}^3$ (mean value of $137~\\mu\\text{g/m}^3$), with relative\nhumidity between $25-95\\%$ (mean value of $72\\%$), and temperature varying from\n$6-29^\\circ$C (mean value of $16^\\circ$C). We evaluate three LCS models (SPS30,\nPMS7003, HPMA115C0-004) in outdoor conditions during the winter season in New\nDelhi, India, deployed alongside a reference-grade beta attenuation monitor\n(BAM). The results indicate a strong correlation between LCS and BAM\nmeasurements (${R^2} > 90\\%$). The RMSE increases with increasing PM\nconcentration and humidity levels but the narrow $95\\%$ confidence interval\nrange of LCS as a function of the reference BAM suggests the importance of LCS\nin air pollution monitoring.

We present robust estimates\nof major close-pair fractions and merger rates at $0.2 < z < 0.9$ in the Deep\nExtragalactic VIsible Legacy Survey (DEVILS). We identify major mergers by\nselecting close-pairs with a projected spatial separation $r_{\\mathrm{sep}} <\n20$ h$^{-1}$ kpc and a radial velocity separation $v_{\\mathrm{sep}} < 500$ km\ns$^{-1}$. For galaxies with stellar masses of log$_{10}$($M_\\star$/$M_\\odot$) =\n10.66 $\\pm$ 0.25 dex, we find a major close-pair fraction of $\\approx 0.021$ at\n$0.2 < z < 0.34$ using a highly complete, unbiased spectroscopic sample.

To date, this\ntechnique is predominantly manual, time-consuming, and subjective.

This approach enables systematic identification\nof waste while maintaining the semantic understanding necessary for qualitative\nanalysis. We develop our approach using 50 business process models, for which\nwe collect and publish manual ground-truth labels. Our evaluation, comparing\nzero-shot baselines with more structured prompts reveals (a) a consistent\nbenefit of structured prompting and (b) promising performance for both tasks.\nWe discuss the potential for LLMs to augment human expertise in qualitative\nprocess analysis while reducing the time and subjectivity inherent in manual\napproaches.",

It delivers\nrealistic and detailed results through a collection of explicit 3D Gaussian\nprimitives, each carrying opacity and view-dependent color. However, efficient\nrendering of many transparent primitives remains a significant challenge.\nExisting approaches either rasterize the Gaussians with approximate per-view\nsorting or rely on high-end RTX GPUs. This paper proposes a stochastic\nray-tracing method to render 3D clouds of transparent primitives. Instead of\nprocessing all ray-Gaussian intersections in sequential order, each ray\ntraverses the acceleration structure only once, randomly accepting and shading\na single intersection (or $N$ intersections, using a simple extension). This\napproach minimizes shading time and avoids primitive sorting along the ray,\nthereby minimizing register usage and maximizing parallelism even on low-end\nGPUs. The cost of rays through the Gaussian asset is comparable to that of\nstandard mesh-intersection rays. The shading is unbiased and has low variance,\nas our stochastic acceptance achieves importance sampling based on accumulated\nweight.

A tiny drop of one liquid, suspended within another, may be set\ninto motion aligned with an imposed thermal gradient, as influenced by\nthermocapillary action stemming from the gradients in interfacial tension due\nto the local variations in temperature. In real-world situations, however, such\ndrops do not remain in isolation, as they interact with their neighboring\nentities, including other drops in proximity as well as a nearby solid\nboundary, setting up a complex interplay between the confinement-mediated\ninteractions and the three-dimensional nature of the droplet dynamics. In this\nstudy, we present numerical solutions for the migration dynamics of a tightly\nconfined drop couple, incorporating deformable interfaces, film flow, and\nMarangoni effects in the presence of dynamically evolving thermocapillary\nstresses induced by an imposed uniform temperature gradient. Unlike prior\ninvestigations, our work highlights the influence of the confinement towards\norchestrating non-trivial features of drop migration, as dictated by an\nintricate coupling of the thermal and flow fields amidst the interferences of\nthe domain boundaries. The study reveals that hydrodynamic interactions\nresulting from a juxtaposition of these influences deform the drops in a unique\nmanner as compared to the characteristics evidenced by previously reported\nstudies, causing a distortion of the local thermal fields around them. This, in\nturn, leads to changes in the local thermocapillary stress, affecting the local\nshear gradient in a manner that alters the local flow field in accordance with\nensuring the interfacial stress balance.",

For instance, given an MC and a deterministic\nfinite automaton (DFA), a simple but practically useful model checking problem\nasks for the probability of traces on the MC that are accepted by the DFA. A\nstandard approach to solving this problem constructs a product MC of the given\nMC and DFA, reducing the task to a simple reachability probability problem on\nthe resulting product MC.\n  In this paper, on top of our recent development of coalgebraic framework, we\nfirst present a no-go theorem for product constructions, showing a case when we\ncannot do product constructions for model checking. Specifically, we show that\nthere are no coalgebraic product MCs of MCs and nondeterministic finite\nautomata for computing the probability of the accepting traces. This no-go\ntheorem is established via a characterisation of natural transformations\nbetween certain functors that determine the type of branching, including\nnondeterministic or probabilistic branching.\n  Second, we present a coalgebraic product construction of MCs and multiset\nfinite automata (MFAs) as a new instance within our framework. This\nconstruction addresses a model checking problem that asks for the expected\nnumber of accepting runs on MFAs over traces of MCs.

    "abstract": "Sequential recommender systems (SRSs) excel in capturing users' dynamic\ninterests, thus playing a key role in various industrial applications. The\npopularity of SRSs has also driven emerging research on their security aspects,\nwhere data poisoning attack for targeted item promotion is a typical example.\nExisting attack mechanisms primarily focus on increasing the ranks of target\nitems in the recommendation list by injecting carefully crafted interactions\n(i.e., poisoning sequences), which comes at the cost of demoting users' real\npreferences. Consequently, noticeable recommendation accuracy drops are\nobserved, restricting the stealthiness of the attack. Additionally, the\ngenerated poisoning sequences are prone to substantial repetition of target\nitems, which is a result of the unitary objective of boosting their overall\nexposure and lack of effective diversity regularizations. Such homogeneity not\nonly compromises the authenticity of these sequences, but also limits the\nattack effectiveness, as it ignores the opportunity to establish sequential\ndependencies between the target and many more items in the SRS. To address the\nissues outlined, we propose a Diversity-aware Dual-promotion Sequential\nPoisoning attack method named DDSP for SRSs. Specifically, by theoretically\nrevealing the conflict between recommendation and existing attack objectives,\nwe design a revamped attack objective that promotes the target item while\nmaintaining the relevance of preferred items in a user's ranking list. We\nfurther develop a diversity-aware, auto-regressive poisoning sequence\ngenerator, where a re-ranking method is in place to sequentially pick the\noptimal items by integrating diversity constraints.",

With impressive accuracy in prediction\nacross a range of diseases, LLMs have the potential to revolutionize clinical\npre-screening and decision-making for various medical conditions. In this work,\nwe study the diagnostic capability of LLMs for Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) with\nreal world patients data.

We notice an interesting pattern in\ndisease diagnosis and find an unexpected \\textit{misalignment between\nprediction and explanation}.

The study is\nbased on a stochastic scenario in which the coherent, unitary evolution of the\nsystem is randomly interrupted by a Poisson-driven pulse sequence. In the\nabsence of an external pulse, the system undergoes coherent, unitary evolution\nrestricted to the subspace spanned by the first level (level $1$) and the\nsecond level (level $2$). The application of a pulse induces transitions\nbetween the second and the third level (level $3$), thereby introducing\nnon-unitary effects that perturb the otherwise isolated two-level dynamics. The\npulses are assumed to have infinitesimal duration, with strengths modeled as\nrandom variables that are uncorrelated across different pulses. A\nrepresentative model for the stochastically-averaged transition (super)operator\nmimicking the dynamics induced by the application of pulses allows for an\nanalytical derivation of the matrix elements of the averaged density operator.\nWhen the system is initially in level $1$, we obtain in particular the temporal\nbehavior of the stay-put probability, that is, the probability $P_1(t)$ that\nthe system is still in level $1$ at time $t$. As a function of time, the\nquantity $P_1(t)$ exhibits a coherence-to-decoherence crossover behavior. At\nshort times $t \\ll 1/\\lambda$, where $\\lambda$ is the average frequency at\nwhich pulses are applied to the system, coherent dynamics dominate.\nConsequently, $P_1(t)$ displays pronounced Rabi-like oscillations.

For example, a piggyback attack can\nmaliciously alter the meaning of watermarked text-transforming it into hate\nspeech-while preserving the original watermark, thereby damaging the reputation\nof the LLM provider. We identify two core challenges that make defending\nagainst spoofing difficult: (1) the need for watermarks to be both sensitive to\nsemantic-distorting changes and insensitive to semantic-preserving edits, and\n(2) the contradiction between the need to detect global semantic shifts and the\nlocal, auto-regressive nature of most watermarking schemes.

Current DG approaches\nare confined to acquiring robust representations with continuous features,\nspecifically training at the pixel level. However, this DG paradigm may\nstruggle to mitigate distribution gaps in dealing with a large space of\ncontinuous features, rendering it susceptible to pixel details that exhibit\nspurious correlations or noise. In this paper, we first theoretically\ndemonstrate that the domain gaps in continuous representation learning can be\nreduced by the discretization process. Based on this inspiring finding, we\nintroduce a novel learning paradigm for DG, termed Discrete Domain\nGeneralization (DDG). DDG proposes to use a codebook to quantize the feature\nmap into discrete codewords, aligning semantic-equivalent information in a\nshared discrete representation space that prioritizes semantic-level\ninformation over pixel-level intricacies. By learning at the semantic level,\nDDG diminishes the number of latent features, optimizing the utilization of the\nrepresentation space and alleviating the risks associated with the wide-ranging\nspace of continuous features. Extensive experiments across widely employed\nbenchmarks in DG demonstrate DDG's superior performance compared to\nstate-of-the-art approaches, underscoring its potential to reduce the\ndistribution gaps and enhance the model's generalizability.",

In the naturally-formed\nPtTe/PtTe$_2$ heterostructure, we observe a giant Rashba spin splitting with\nRashba coefficient of $\\alpha_{R}$ = 1.8 eV$\\cdot$$\\AA$, as revealed by spin-\nand angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements. Our work\ndemonstrates a convenient and effective pathway for achieving pronounced Rashba\nsplitting in centrosymmetric TMDC thin films by creating TMMC/TMDC\nheterostructure, thereby extending their potential applications to spintronics.",

    "abstract": "Reducing wealth inequality is a global challenge, and the problems of\ncapitalism stem from the enclosure of the commons and the breakdown of the\ncommunity. According to previous studies by Polanyi, Karatani, and Graeber,\neconomic modes can be divided into capitalist market economy (enclosure and\nexchange), power economy (de-enclosure and redistribution), gift economy\n(obligation to return and reciprocity), and concession economy (de-obligation\nto return). The concession economy reflects Graeber's baseline communism (from\neach according to their abilities, to each according to their needs) and\nDeguchi's We-turn philosophy (the \"I\" as an individual has a \"fundamental\nincapability\" and the subject of physical action, responsibility, and freedom\nis \"We\" as a multi-agent system, including the \"I\"). In this study, we\nconstructed novel network models for these four modes and compared their\nproperties (cluster coefficient, graph density, reciprocity, assortativity,\ncentrality, and Gini coefficient). From the calculation results, it became\nclear that the market economy leads to inequality; the power economy mitigates\ninequality but cannot eliminate it; the gift and concession economies lead to a\nhealthy and equal economy; and the concession economy, free from the ties of\nobligation to return, is possible without guaranteeing reciprocity. We intend\nto promote the transformation from a capitalist economy to a concession economy\nthrough activities that disseminate baseline communism and the We-turn\nphilosophy that promotes concession, that is, developing a cooperative platform\nto support concession through information technology and empirical research\nthrough fieldwork.",

    "abstract": "Existing learning models often exhibit poor generalization when deployed\nacross diverse scenarios. It is primarily due to that the underlying reference\nframe of the data varies with the deployment environment and settings. However,\ndespite that data of each scenario has a distinct reference frame, its\ngeneration generally follows common underlying physical rules. Based on this\nunderstanding, this article proposes a deep learning framework named analogical\nlearning (AL), which implicitly retrieves the reference frame information\nassociated with a scenario and then to make accurate prediction by relative\nanalogy with other scenarios. Specifically, we design a bipartite neural\nnetwork called Mateformer. Its first part captures the relativity within\nmultiple latent feature spaces between the input data and a small amount of\nembedded data from the studied scenario, while its second part uses this\nrelativity to guide the nonlinear analogy. We apply AL to the typical\nmulti-scenario learning problem of intelligent wireless localization in\ncellular networks. Extensive experiments validate AL's superiority across three\nkey dimensions. First, it achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in single-scenario\nbenchmarks. Second, it demonstrates stable transferability between different\nscenarios, avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Finally, and most importantly, it\nrobustly adapts to new, unseen scenarios--including dynamic weather and traffic\nconditions--without any tuning.

Anchored in a Glocalized design approach, this tool\nsupports pre-service teachers (PSTs) in Ghana by embedding localized\nlinguistic, cultural, and curricular content within globally aligned principles\nof ethical and responsible AI use. The model utilizes structured, preloaded\ndatasets-including Ghana's National Teacher Education Curriculum Framework\n(NTECF), UNESCO's (2023) AI guidelines, and culturally responsive pedagogies-to\noffer curriculum-aligned, linguistically adaptive, and pedagogically grounded\nlearning support.

The\ndesign incorporates the Culture and Context-Aware Framework, GenAI-CRSciA, and\nframeworks addressing GenAI neocolonialism to ensure equity, curriculum\nfidelity, and local relevance.

    "abstract": "Although multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit remarkable\nreasoning capabilities on complex multimodal understanding tasks, they still\nsuffer from the notorious hallucination issue: generating outputs misaligned\nwith obvious visual or factual evidence. Currently, training-based solutions,\nlike direct preference optimization (DPO), leverage paired preference data to\nsuppress hallucinations. However, they risk sacrificing general reasoning\ncapabilities due to the likelihood displacement. Meanwhile, training-free\nsolutions, like contrastive decoding, achieve this goal by subtracting the\nestimated hallucination pattern from a distorted input. Yet, these handcrafted\nperturbations (e.g., add noise to images) may poorly capture authentic\nhallucination patterns. To avoid these weaknesses of existing methods, and\nrealize robust hallucination mitigation (i.e., maintaining general reasoning\nperformance), we propose a novel framework: Decoupling Contrastive Decoding\n(DCD). Specifically, DCD decouples the learning of positive and negative\nsamples in preference datasets, and trains separate positive and negative image\nprojections within the MLLM. The negative projection implicitly models real\nhallucination patterns, which enables vision-aware negative images in the\ncontrastive decoding inference stage. Our DCD alleviates likelihood\ndisplacement by avoiding pairwise optimization and generalizes robustly without\nhandcrafted degradation. Extensive ablations across hallucination benchmarks\nand general reasoning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of DCD, i.e., it\nmatches DPO's hallucination suppression while preserving general capabilities\nand outperforms the handcrafted contrastive decoding methods.",

These approaches struggle to efficiently\ncapture the complex connections in real-world knowledge graphs, thereby\nlimiting their overall performance. To address this issue, we propose a\nstructure-aware multimodal Diffusion model for multimodal knowledge graph\nCompletion (DiffusionCom). DiffusionCom innovatively approaches the problem\nfrom the perspective of generative models, modeling the association between the\n$(head, relation)$ pair and candidate tail entities as their joint probability\ndistribution $p((head, relation), (tail))$, and framing the MKGC task as a\nprocess of gradually generating the joint probability distribution from noise.\nFurthermore, to fully leverage the structural information in MKGs, we propose\nStructure-MKGformer, an adaptive and structure-aware multimodal knowledge\nrepresentation learning method, as the encoder for DiffusionCom.\nStructure-MKGformer captures rich structural information through a multimodal\ngraph attention network (MGAT) and adaptively fuses it with entity\nrepresentations, thereby enhancing the structural awareness of these\nrepresentations. This design effectively addresses the limitations of existing\nMKGC methods, particularly those based on multimodal pre-trained models, in\nutilizing structural information. DiffusionCom is trained using both generative\nand discriminative losses for the generator, while the feature extractor is\noptimized exclusively with discriminative loss.

Our new method successfully reproduces the previous one-loop results\nwithin the in-in formalism when the expansion parameter is small and deviates\nsignificantly as the parameter increases, indicating that our results extend\nbeyond the one-loop in-in formalism.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a unified framework, integrating information theory and\nstatistical mechanics, to connect metric failure in high-dimensional data with\nemergence in complex systems. We propose the \"Information Dilution Theorem,\"\ndemonstrating that as dimensionality ($d$) increases, the mutual information\nefficiency between geometric metrics (e.g., Euclidean distance) and system\nstates decays approximately as $O(1/d)$. This decay arises from the mismatch\nbetween linearly growing system entropy and sublinearly growing metric entropy,\nexplaining the mechanism behind distance concentration. Building on this, we\nintroduce information structural complexity ($C(S)$) based on the mutual\ninformation matrix spectrum and interaction encoding capacity ($C'$) derived\nfrom information bottleneck theory. The \"Emergence Critical Theorem\" states\nthat when $C(S)$ exceeds $C'$, new global features inevitably emerge,\nsatisfying a predefined mutual information threshold. This provides an\noperational criterion for self-organization and phase transitions. We discuss\npotential applications in physics, biology, and deep learning, suggesting\npotential directions like MI-based manifold learning (UMAP+) and offering a\nquantitative foundation for analyzing emergence across disciplines.",

In this\nwork, we show that this approach still suffers from fragile co-adaptation:\nwhere a core mechanism of MAP-Elites, creating stepping stones through\nsolutions that migrate from one niche to another, is disrupted. We suggest that\nthis disruption occurs because the body mutations that move an offspring to a\nnew morphological niche break the robots' fragile brain-body co-adaptation and\nthus significantly decrease the performance of those potential solutions --\nreducing their likelihood of outcompeting an existing elite in that new niche.\nWe utilize a technique, we call Pollination, that periodically replaces the\ncontrollers of certain solutions with a distilled controller with better\ngeneralization across morphologies to reduce fragile brain-body co-adaptation\nand thus promote MAP-Elites migrations. Pollination increases the success of\nbody mutations and the number of migrations, resulting in better\nquality-diversity metrics.

    "abstract": "Optical coherence elastography (OCE) is a powerful non-invasive imaging\ntechnique for high-resolution assessment of tissue elasticity and\nviscoelasticity. Accurate characterization of viscoelastic properties requires\nestimating shear wave speed (SWS) across multiple frequencies, as dispersion\ninduces frequency-dependent variations in wave speed. This study introduces a\nnovel multi-frequency reverberant OCE (MFR-OCE) approach to enhance\nviscoelastic tissue characterization by simultaneously capturing shear wave\ndynamics over multiple frequencies. We present the theoretical framework,\nexperimental setup, and validation of MFR-OCE through simulations and\nexperiments on gelatin phantoms, ex vivo porcine cornea, and ex vivo bovine\nliver. Simulation results demonstrate that MFR-OCE estimates SWS with errors\nbelow 4% relative to ground truth, and phantom experimental results show that\nMFR-OCE and single-frequency OCE also yield closely matching SWS estimates,\nwith differences below 3%. Furthermore, the frequency-dependent dispersion\ncoefficients extracted from biological tissues and phantoms align with the\ntheoretical viscoelastic power law model. The gelatin phantoms exhibit a low\nviscoelastic behavior with an exponent of 0.13 for the power law fit of SWS,\nwhile the ex vivo porcine cornea demonstrates intermediate viscoelastic\nbehavior, with a power law exponent of 0.33. The liver tissue shows significant\nfrequency dependence, with a power law exponent of 0.51. These findings\ndemonstrate that MFR-OCE enables a more comprehensive understanding of tissue\nmechanics and holds the potential for improving diagnostic accuracy in clinical\napplications.",

We present the study of nuclear dynamics at extremely large\ninternal momenta in the deuteron dominated by the nuclear core. It is\ndemonstrated that the paradigm shift in the description of the deuteron\nconsisting of proton and neutron to the description of the deuteron as a\npseudo-vector composite system in which proton and neutron is observed in high\nenergy electro-disintegration processes results in the emergence of a new\nstructure. We demonstrate that this new structure can exist only if it emerges\nfrom pre-existing non-nucleonic component in the deuteron. The study of the\ndynamics of the predicted new structure is presented focusing on the question\nif it allows to understand the anomaly observed in the recent experiment at\nJefferson Lab that probed deuteron structure at internal momenta above 800\nMeV/c.",

    "abstract": "One of the oldest problems in physics is that of calculating the motion of\n$N$ particles under a specified mutual force: the $N$-body problem. Much is\nknown about this problem if the specified force is non-relativistic gravity,\nand considerable progress has been made by considering the problem in one\nspatial dimension. Here, I review what is known about the relativistic\ngravitational $N$-body problem. Reduction to one spatial dimension has the\nfeature of the absence of gravitational radiation, thereby allowing for a clear\ncomparison between the physics of one-dimensional relativistic and\nnon-relativistic self-gravitating systems. After describing how to obtain a\nrelativistic theory of gravity coupled to $N$ point particles, I discuss in\nturn the two-body, three-body, four-body, and $N$-body problems. Quite general\nexact solutions can be obtained for the two-body problem, unlike the situation\nin general relativity in three spatial dimensions for which only highly\nspecified solutions exist. The three-body problem exhibits mild forms of chaos,\nand provides one of the first theoretical settings in which relativistic chaos\ncan be studied. For $N\\geq 4$, other interesting features emerge. Relativistic\nself-gravitating systems have a number of interesting problems awaiting further\ninvestigation, providing us with a new frontier for exploring relativistic\nmany-body systems.",

    "abstract": "We find that the response length of reasoning LLMs, whether trained by\nreinforcement learning or supervised learning, drastically increases for\nill-posed questions with missing premises (MiP), ending up with redundant and\nineffective thinking. This newly introduced scenario exacerbates the general\noverthinking issue to a large extent, which we name as the MiP-Overthinking.\nSuch failures are against the ``test-time scaling law'' but have been widely\nobserved on multiple datasets we curated with MiP, indicating the harm of cheap\noverthinking and a lack of critical thinking. Surprisingly, LLMs not\nspecifically trained for reasoning exhibit much better performance on the MiP\nscenario, producing much shorter responses that quickly identify ill-posed\nqueries. This implies a critical flaw of the current training recipe for\nreasoning LLMs, which does not encourage efficient thinking adequately, leading\nto the abuse of thinking patterns. To further investigate the reasons behind\nsuch failures, we conduct fine-grained analyses of the reasoning length,\noverthinking patterns, and location of critical thinking on different types of\nLLMs. Moreover, our extended ablation study reveals that the overthinking is\ncontagious through the distillation of reasoning models' responses.

    "abstract": "Motion retargeting seeks to faithfully replicate the spatio-temporal motion\ncharacteristics of a source character onto a target character with a different\nbody shape. Apart from motion semantics preservation, ensuring geometric\nplausibility and maintaining temporal consistency are also crucial for\neffective motion retargeting. However, many existing methods prioritize either\ngeometric plausibility or temporal consistency. Neglecting geometric\nplausibility results in interpenetration while neglecting temporal consistency\nleads to motion jitter. In this paper, we propose a novel sequence-to-sequence\nmodel for seamless Spatial-Temporal aware motion Retargeting (STaR), with\npenetration and consistency constraints. STaR consists of two modules: (1) a\nspatial module that incorporates dense shape representation and a novel limb\npenetration constraint to ensure geometric plausibility while preserving motion\nsemantics, and (2) a temporal module that utilizes a temporal transformer and a\nnovel temporal consistency constraint to predict the entire motion sequence at\nonce while enforcing multi-level trajectory smoothness. The seamless\ncombination of the two modules helps us achieve a good balance between the\nsemantic, geometric, and temporal targets. Extensive experiments on the Mixamo\nand ScanRet datasets demonstrate that our method produces plausible and\ncoherent motions while significantly reducing interpenetration rates compared\nwith other approaches.

    "abstract": "Estimating item difficulty through field-testing is often resource-intensive\nand time-consuming. As such, there is strong motivation to develop methods that\ncan predict item difficulty at scale using only the item content. Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) represent a new frontier for this goal. The present\nresearch examines the feasibility of using an LLM to predict item difficulty\nfor K-5 mathematics and reading assessment items (N = 5170). Two estimation\napproaches were implemented: (a) a direct estimation method that prompted the\nLLM to assign a single difficulty rating to each item, and (b) a feature-based\nstrategy where the LLM extracted multiple cognitive and linguistic features,\nwhich were then used in ensemble tree-based models (random forests and gradient\nboosting) to predict difficulty. Overall, direct LLM estimates showed moderate\nto strong correlations with true item difficulties. However, their accuracy\nvaried by grade level, often performing worse for early grades. In contrast,\nthe feature-based method yielded stronger predictive accuracy, with\ncorrelations as high as r = 0.87 and lower error estimates compared to both\ndirect LLM predictions and baseline regressors. These findings highlight the\npromise of LLMs in streamlining item development and reducing reliance on\nextensive field testing and underscore the importance of structured feature\nextraction. We provide a seven-step workflow for testing professionals who\nwould want to implement a similar item difficulty estimation approach with\ntheir item pool.",
